"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 1/15/2015. Pours hazy deep golden color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, banana, white grape, wheat, bread, light clove, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Okay aromas with solid balance of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt notes; with decent strength. A bit too fruity/slightly metallic in the nose. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, banana, white grape, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Light yeast spice/wheat tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, banana, white, grape, wheat, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a solid pale wheat ale style. All around good robustness and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"An underrated Hefe...subtly complex and worth a try..."

"Wish they sold it here in southwest Ohio! Was brought some from Vermont a month ago! One of my staples when I'm back that way to visit family.  Nice light wheat hefe."

"Overall:  More hefeweizen than pale ale.  Nice Bavarian yeast flavor and easy to drink."

"Very Smooth and great taste."

"A solid wheat beer. Easy drinkability,  Pretty good depth for a beer that is also pretty easy to find."

"One of my favorites Harpoon offerings. Excellent Hefeweizen beer and wonderful flavors. Nice and light and highly drinkable."

"06/12 - Rate Beer does not do this brew justice. A 26? Time for me to re-evaluate RB. It's got a fresh, clean taste with a great balance. I could drink this all day long. Lemon takes it into July/August mode."

"Overall: This one should NOT be labeled a hefeweizen. I know BA categorizes it as an American Pale Wheat, and that is certainly what it is, but Harpoon calling this one a hefeweizen is a shame. This beer is abysmal as a hefeweizen and passable as an American Pale Wheat, but even then, it pales in comparison to better offerings including Goose Island 312 and Bell's Oberon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is light on the palate, grainy, and almost lager-like. I get little trace of any clove or banana or bubblegum notes as I'd expect. Instead, I would consider this more of a basic wheat beer. As a hefeweizen, this one just falls short on most levels. Nonetheless, this remains drinkable and easygoing, and would make a a solid session drink or a fine starter beer for future craft beer fans."

"Pours a cloudy straw color with a half finger of head that dissipates quickly. The nose has only fairly faint wheat notes. The body is slightly heartier than most wheats. The finish is slightly bitter, but there is a something sweet on the finish as well."

"O - Not a huge fan of most wheat beers, and this was no different. Not offensive, was certainly drinkable, just very, very low on taste. I've certainly had worse, but I won't buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this example is way below what I have come to expect from both German and American brewers of this style, such as Paulander's Hefe-Weizen amd Sierra Nevada's Kellerweis Hefeweizen."

"Taste has a good bit of tart raspberry in it and is quite pleasant. The wheat taste is nice and crisp. The tartness is much more than what the smell would suggest. Mouthfeel is alright and drinkability is good. Perfect for a hot summer day or a bbq."

"Pours a hazy orange with a huge frothy white head. Has a strong wheat smell, some malt and spice, sweet and citrus. Taste has the spice up front with the citrus at the end. Strong on the palette, nice flavors, balanced nicely. Overall a nice beer, could be a bit smoother, but an enjoyable beer."
""
""
"O - This is a solid Hefe. Nothing stands out as best in class, but it's very drinkable, and serves as a great, refreshing brew on a warm afternoon. I recommend drinking this outside as much as possible."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite one-dimensional, but a nice pale wheat ale. Very wheat-centered, with fruity yeast and very light spice. Extremely drinkable as well"

"o - Overall not my favorite pale wheat, or beer from Harpoon, but decent. Nose was pretty nice but the taste had a little too much pepper or spice in it. Probably would just stick with their IPA next time."

"This a bit of a disappointment. The yeast adds some bubblegum and banana, but the rest of the beer is rather flavorless. It's also a bit grainy which detracts from the overall flavor. I definitely wouldn't buy this beer again. There are far better beers out there that are actual Hefeweizens."

"O – This beer is alright. It has the skeleton of a pale wheat ale, but nothing really stands out. It’s also far too plain and light for my taste. The mouthfeel lacks that creaminess that good wheat ales possess. I know that it’s only semantics, but Harpoon has no business calling this a hefeweizen. American pale wheat ales should not have the clove and banana aromas or flavors that good German hefeweizens have, so it’s not fair to put them in the same category. Also, if they were trying to make a hefeweizen instead of an American pale wheat ale, they failed miserably. This is a decent beer, especially for the summer, but I probably won’t seek it out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Doesn't really taste like a wheat beer to me. The flavours are way too subtle. Either way, it's pretty boring and I wouldn't pick this up again."

""

"I suppose I like my hefeweizens to have some taste to them. A little clove or banana esters would have been nice with this one. It's a decent beer for warm weather, but it's too tasteless for my liking. Personally, I don't like this trend in commercial beers of brewing hefeweizens without the estery goodness. I see that one of The Bros' reviewed this in 2001 and he said it was one of the best examples of an American wheat. The recipe must have changed from 11 years ago. This is not a good representation of a hefeweizen and should be avoided if you want to enjoy and appreciate the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd have this again."
"I believe this is a well done rendition of a hefeweizen and something I would purchase again. A tad pricey though"
""
""
"This beer pours up with an enormous head with lots of lacing. Color is a hazy straw color with a strong smell of wheat. Mouthfeel is a pretty thin and the taste is uncomplex with a little bit of hoppiness. Not bad, but nothing extra-special here either."

"O: Yeah, I'd drink again on a hot, summer, Texas day. I wouldn't turn it down but, I probably wouldn't buy it. It drinks very fast due to the lack of flavors. Blue Moon has more of a wheat taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great summer beer to have more than one of because it is easy to drink, refreshing and has some thirst-quenching properties."

"Overall - This is a nice unfiltered beer. I enjoy Shiner's verison more but they don't do the cloudy goodness like this one."
""
""
""
""

"Harpoon again delivers another solid beer. The UFO Hefeweizen is a solid Hefeweizen with good flavor. The unfiltered Hefeweizen gives it the smooth yet unique flavor that UFO beers provide. Again I enjoy drinking this during the summer while grilling out. It is light enough that you can just enjoy the smooth flavor with just about any dish in the summer."

"Poured from a bottle into a weisse glass, the beer is a pale, unfiltered, hazy, yellowish coloring with a frothy, light, foamy white head that starts strong but settles into a bubbly film. Signs of strong carbonation throughout the beer's body, and nothing left along the glass as you go. Aromas of bread, clove, banana, and some light peppering. The beer's flavors are mild, and the body is smooth, but slightly sharp at the end from the carbonation. Palate of slight citrus highlights along the banana bread backbone, with some spicy notes throughout the keep it clean. The aftertaste is more of the spicing, and again it's a bit sharp from the effervescent and carbonated body. The finish is quick and clean. Easy enough to drink, that's for sure."

"Overall: Slightly below average American Pale Wheat Ale. Not really distinguishable or memorable a beer. Not so bad that I would turn it away, but there are plenty others in the style I would go to first."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a clear yellow with 1 finger head and lasting lace. The aroma is of banana, dough, and vanilla. The flavor is subdued banana and mild lemon with a cake background. The mouthfeel is light-medium and smooth. Harpoon UFO Hefeweizen is a good beer. Recommended."

"This beer tastes like a sweet malt liquor and is really crappy. Most any beer is better than this unless it's a malt liquor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's lacking a lot of flavor.. either because my bottle is old or this beer is just very simple."
""
""

"Overall- the light tastes that are there and are palatable make this beer effortless because once its sitting in your mouth its going down easy and quick."

"Haven't had Harpoon in quite awhile so I thought I'd give it a try. I really like the label. Poured into my Duvel tulip. Nice fluffy head and inviting citrus aroma. Nice wheat flavor with not much hops. Tiny bit of banana clove which may be more noticeable in a fresher bottle. Nice light clean taste which was very easy to drink would enjoy a sixer in the summer."
"O-A run of the mill APWA, could use some more hops but a easy drinker and rather sessionable."
"Light bodied with medium carbonation. Good overall but much better hefes available so not something I'm likely to go back to."
"Overall, this is a nice beer. It has its problems, but it's a solid brew."
"Not really a bad beer, just not the best hefe out there."
"It pours a light murky orange color with a foamy white head. The smell is mostly and surprisingly caramel and butter with just a hint of citrus and wheat. The taste is mostly lemon and wheat with just a hint of orange. The beer is light with lots of prickly carbonation and a dry finish. This is a pretty good American hefe, better than the UFO white at least."
"Final Thoughts: A very fine beer. Not the best, but a great whack at hefes. I'm not the biggest fan of them, and I can tell you this is a pretty good whack at the style. Nice yeastiness, which I am a fan of. Not the best ever, but a good one."
"The pour is a cloudy pale yellow with a nice lasting white head. A faint and quickly vanishing aroma of sweet ripe fruit, and some light banana notes. Taste is wheat, some maltiness , very faint fruity notes, but mostly a wheat flavor. Light body and ok carbonation and watery mouth feel. The finish is light malt, wheat, some light sweet spices ending is mostly wheat with some grassy notes. Overall an ok yet refreshing light summer brew. There are better Hefe’s out there"
"It had a murky yellow/orange color with a small head; little lacing. Very strong lemon and citrus taste, too strong in my opinion but it might be enjoyable by those looking for strong spicy flavors in their hefes. Refreshing mouthfeel, special for a hot summer day."
"M- Great bubbly feel to this and it went down great and i felt it the whole way which i like. AWESOME aftertaste too!"
"Overall a good brew! Seems a little lighter than some other hefe's, but they are very easy to drink, yet still has enough kick from the wheat."
"Overall a decent beer but nothing too special."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Mouthfeel is crisp and rich enough. On the whole, a pretty average beer. Not bad for accompanying food. Better without the chilled glass though."
"Poured a 1"" white head. Hazy lemon yellow color. Slight smell of spice. Very little in the taste beyond standard BMCs. In fact quite watery. Had I not known this was a Hefe I might have missed those attributes entirely. Still, it's an easy drinking beer and a nice cold refreshment on a summer day."
"Overall-I just let this beer sit in the heat for about 20 minutes after drinking about 6oz and ended up pouring it out. Stay away from this horseshit beer."
"The beer had a great appearance at first with a nice head and color. The taste was just bland and almost too watery. Nothing about the smell, taste, or mouthfeel stood out. Lacking in carbonation. Mouthfeel was too light. Taste for a split second was typical of the style, but it would quickly disappear and taste like a watered down hefe. I felt like this beer is among the most boring beers I've ever tasted."
"I have never been a very big fan of wheat beers but this beer is the exception. The UFO Hefeweizen has an indescribably smooth and refreshing taste. This organic beer is so fresh and easily fits the bill, especially on those hot summer days. I would recommend this beer to anyone regardless of whether you like wheat beers."
"Overall: Very good American wheat beer. Very flavorful and clean beer that’s got the perfect mix of spices and malts to make a beer with great color aroma and taste"
"Overall, not too impressed with this wheaty. lacks a broader dimension of flavors, which for this beer are consistent(dusty, chalky, lemon, grain), just not appetizing. Doesn't come close to touching the trademark wheats of Weihenstephan, Hacker-Pschorr, and Paulaner, but very drinkable."
"Overall I enjoy this beer. Its not too bold like some German hefeweizens, and it has a great balance between the flavors from the yeast, malt and citrus. It's not trying to be anything too fancy, which I think makes it a great hefeweizen for a summer afternoon."
"O: Decent beer, but nothing special."
"there is nothing that special about ufo. It's just over all a nice wheat crisp beer. Good beer for warm weather. The smell has a slight vanilla citrus. The color is a cloudy golden, like a good wheat beer should be. There seems to be some slight citrus flavors but they are so faint you have to really concentrate to catch em. But over all this is a nice crisp fresh beer."
"The mouthfeel is what I'd expect. Carbonation is in effect without being spritzy. The body is appropriately light and crisp, which make it refreshing and drinkable."
"D - Very drinkable. Overall crisp and fairly well balanced. Feels a touch empty and could have used a bit more flavor."
"overall this beer is not bad on a hot summer day....but i think maybe it should be like a dollar cheaper..."
"D - Good but not special. An easy drinker but it seems like I could drink an average wheat beer over an average lager any day. Refreshing."
"Overall Drinkablity - Not as good as I remember it. Pretty stale, even though the freshness date is 7/15/11 (3 months away)."
"This beer is much like the UFO White. Both have basically the same characteristics. Both are wheat beers and they both look pretty much identical from the pour. The main difference is that the UFO Hefeweizen doesn't have the citrus like the White has. I found that the flavor of this one fell apart when comparing the two of them together. The Hefe was just overall on the bland side. Not much stood out other than it being a smooth wheat beer. Personally I prefer the White over this one any day."
"Very worthy but I kinda like my beers a little stronger"
"To be honest, this is one of my favorite American pale wheat ales. It is definitely not a real Hefeweizen, despite what the label says, and I think this is a good thing. I had this for the first time a few years ago and I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, it got placed on my ""beers I enjoy but don't buy often because they're super easy to get"" list. Today was a warm, sunny day, and it seemed like a perfect choice. As I mentioned in the ""taste"" section, this beer is wonderfully unoffensive. Just drink it and enjoy the sun."
"This is one of my favorite hefe beers. This is another unfiltered hefe, but it is smooth with a lot of flavor. Definitely a summer beer. I hate when they serve this beer with an orange, this is not a cheap beer. Pouring into a glass is a must to bring out all of the aromas."
"Poured a medium yellow with an average sized white creamy head that lasted throughout and had good lacing. The aroma was mild of a earthy yeast, cereal malts and a nice hint of citrus. It tasted very yeasty in the begining and finished with a yeasty/malty flavor that had strong hints of citrus and clove with the flavor staying with you for only a short while. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and watery yet creamy in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall a very nice refreshing wheat ale, could see myself drinking a few on a nice spring day with a slice of lemon."
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, somewhat sweet and sticky on the palate. Drinks okay, but this is pretty average from top to bottom."
"If it's there I'll drink it but wouldn't purchase separately with an abundant selection of other hefes around."
"Good one finger head of white foam, leaving a good heaping of clinging lace in it's trail. Color is a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells like roasted wheat, malt, and some citrus. Taste is well balanced flavors of roasted wheat, oats, corn, and some rice. There is also a goodly amount of malt and hops in the finish. Much better than a soft drink in fullness, and creaminess. Good tingle from the carbonation. Crisp and smooth enough to drink plenty. Much better than a yard work beer."
"OVERALL GRADE: C-"
"I owe that jerk Alien a La Fin Du Monde for showing me this beer. It's a rather friendly Hefeweizen that shakes your hand with with warm feelings. I was hoping for a hug, but a strong grip and a warm smile is just as nice sometimes."
"D- Meh it went down pretty good once you choke past the awful taste."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Slight haze on the tawny-gold body. Three-finger head lasts and laces well. Lemon oil, spicy yeast, and maybe a trace of banana in the aroma. Flavor is lemon, resin, yeast, slight banana-honey flavors at times. Light-medium body is soft, frothy, dryish, and not as acidic as I expected (good). Although I stand by my decree against labeling American Wheats as Hefeweizens, this one stands slightly above that crowd; I believe mainly on the basis of the hop flavors and slight esters that seem to dampen the acerbic citric-yeast tartness that overpowers most AW's."
"Served in an english pint glass at The Black Rose in Boston. Hazy Golden in color. Light citrus aroma. Good lacing but very little head. Citrus taste but not overpowering. Smooth finish. Excellent drinkability. Would definitely order this beer again."
"D: This is a good session beer, characteristics of a hefeweizen are lacking, not exactly what you would expect. I would have a few if I was watching Sunday football all day!"
" I'll have this beer again."
"This is a very light bodied beer and it doesn't have a mouthfeel of an unfiltered ale. Finishes quickly without any real lingering flavor. If I was drinking this blind I most likely would have pegged it as a Munich Helles Lager or something along those lines. Clean malt body, not a lot of hop bitterness, a bit of spiciness on the finish."
"D- You could drink a hundred of these. Very tasty."
"D - Very drinkable. A very good example of an American-styled hefe that drinks more like a lager. Lack of bittering hops to clean the palate on the finish might start making the lingering banana a bit much after a few of these, but it's a subtle taste rather than dominating like it is in the Flying Dog. Need to try with a lemon wedge to see how that affects the finish. This could well make my short list of hot summer day beers."
"D- Easy to drink, but watery. Slightly above your average beer on drinkability. Very light."
"On an ending note: Harpoon needs to properly name this beer. It should just be labelled a wheat beer and not a hefe. Calling it a hefe is a bit misleading, there just isn't enough ester character in this beer to call it a hefeweizen."
"D- I could put down a sixer of this no problem. Actually this became my beer of choice this year tailgating. Harpoon I feel gave up a little on this beer...just a little more love and this could be the beer they want it to be."
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours a golden lemon color with a white head and a bit of lacing. The nose is some slightly-tart wheat plus some lemon, orange, and a bit of the Harpoon yeast. The taste is a bit plain with just very mild citrus and a bit of light grain. Light body and the carbonation carries off many of the flavors before they really develop. Drinks fairly well; nice and crisp."
"Drinkability: Well, it did the trick with a fish stick and vegetable meal, but, it's not great wheat beer. It's too carbonated and the label is a misnomer. But - it's an okay beer. Good appearance, but that's about it."
"O: easy and pleasant to drink. Very good for thirst quenching or to accompany mildly flavored foods; not bold or complex enough to hold interest as a sipper."
"Overall: good representation for the style and I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be enjoyable or at the very least tolerable."
"Overall, this was a boring, bland beer. Easy to drink and inexpensive. It doesnt taste ""bad", but there just isnt much flavor to it. I guess I'd buy this for a warm weather party/outting where I'd be drinking for several hours."
"Acceptable, easy to make a newbie drink. Lack-luster for someone looking for more."
"D- Very refreshing for a hot day or just whenever and decent for the style. I have revisited several times and I dont see why I wont again."
"Good head retention and lacing through out session."
"This was a club favorite of the wheat beers. I do plan on buying more and I do hope that the local store restocks, because they did run out. I must not be the only one who likes this."
"I can't say I liked this at all, there was very little flavor other than lemon. I'm not sure I've ever had a more watery beer."
"."
"Drinkability: Light and refreshing, I wish the yeast hadn't mixed in so I didn't taste so sour but all in all its a good beer for summer just no a favorite of mine with that yeast mixed in."
"D: Its refreshing and drinkable; would make a decent summertime beach / pool beer."
"My first review here so, let's see how it goes. First introduced to this on Cape Cod a few weeks ago. Poured into a Guinness pint glass (from St. James Gate). Appearance is good cloudy Hef-like, smells of citrusy-lemon, taste is decent, a bit sharp with a little bite, mouthfeel is good, unfiltered comes through and it is potentially a good session brew (especially during summer months)"
"On the grounds of being labeled a Hefeweizen, this beer did not deliver. It has the right appearance, and the aroma was almost on par for the style (though it strayed a bit). The mouthfeel was very carbonated which is typical, and medium to light bodied. That's where it ends. The taste of the beer (IMO the most important part) was that of a skunky lager. It had MUCH more hop presence than should be found in any beer claiming to be a Hefeweizen and it totally lacked the banana and clove character of the style. If you want a REAL Hefe from a domestic brewery, go pick up Sierra Nevada's Kellerweis."
"the drinkability is good. it's quenching and has a good flavor, if a little muted. i think i would have given this higher marks if they didn't call it a hefeweizen. this is a respectable american wheat beer, not anything i'd reach for when i'm in the mood for a hefe though. it's missing most of that banana/clove character that's the hallmark of a good one. a good beer for the summertime though."
"D- There's no flavor to get in the way. Absolutely no flavor at all..."
"Good representation of a unfilitered Hefe, which is one of my favorite styles to drink on a humid day such as this one..."
"All in all, it's a very middle of the road option for style. It's not very distinctive at all. I'd like more flavor."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a cloudy yellow without much head or lacing. Smells of faint lemon and wheat, very mild smell. The taste has very mild bitterness without the taste of hops, some lemon and wheat. Smooth mouthfeel. I could drink these on a warm day, but certainly nothing special."
"Cloudy blonde with corn silk highlights when backlit and a slight, creamy eggshell head. Mild wheat malt aroma with a little lemon zest and bubblegum. Dry and citrusy up front with tangy wheat malt and faint soft banana sweetness in the mosty dry finish. A think a softer, creamier texture would bump the enjoyment of this one up a notch for me. Prickly, slightly harsh carbonation. A tad rough drinking for the style but not really bad either."
"Drinkability: It's not bad. I could have this again, but there are others I would drink before this."
"Gulp gulp gone. Beer is thin and watery, drinks about like water too. Its pretty boring. Mild bitterness at the back from some grain, what's the ABV on this? 5.1% yeah right. This is an NA beer if I've ever had one."
"This beer does not seem to be true to style. I find it to be unbalanced and lacking any kind of complexity. Reminds me more of an adjunct grain lager than anything else. I don't get it.."
"Drinkability: It's not bad. I could have this again, but there are others I would drink before this."
"Looks nice. Pale golden body, hazy. Bubbles speed from the bottom of the glass to the thick, pillowy head, that leaves some lacing behind as my glass empties - quite quickly I might add. Aroma is very bready and light, accompanied by a slight whisp of vanilla. Very refreshing, but the taste it just a bit thin - very bready with barely noticeable hints of banana and vanilla. Light bodied, easy drinker. Very ""wheaty"" all around."
"Hazy yellow, not quite cloudy, with a fluffy, bright white cap. Clumpy lacing clung to the glass as the head diminished. Lemony aroma with some wheat. Low bitterness with the same citrus and wheat character as in the aroma, maybe a bit more crackery. Slight sourness from the wheat and a little bit of lingering spice. Quite dry, medium to light bodied with ample carbonation. Decent for an APWA, but there's just not a lot here that makes me want to come back to it."
"D- A really refreshing beer, a great summer time beer. I would not turn this one down on a hot day."
"Overall, very drinkable and refreshing, however a little muted on flavor. A nice Hefe in any case."
"Pours a completely hazed, deep straw yellow. Small, white, micro bubbled ring of a head. Smell is pure and bready, a bit more nose than other pale wheat ales I've tried. Taste is clean, straight to the point wheat, some pleasant bitterness following. Melon-like notes are detected. Carbonated well, but this is a tasty, pretty smooth drinking brew."
"D: At least this one isn't offensive. It's just boring. A good session beer if someone just wants something light and moderately refreshing. This is probably a good starter beer for new craft beer drinkers, or anyone looking for something different other than BMC. For me, there are better wheat beers out there, both imports and American craft varieties."
"I found this bottled brew being served at a most popular venue in Litchfield, CT, the enigmatic, Bohemian Pizza. This brew is a very hazy tan-straw color with a big white cover and decent signs of lace. The aroma says light lemon bread with a little fruit nougat and sweet clove. The flavor comes on with bubblegum sweet wheat and tangy citrus. It has a lively feel with tasteful carbonation in a medium-light body. Very fresh and crisp feeling, nice for a cold and very easy drinking brew. The flavor factor is fine, the feel is good, but it's up to the best in this class at all. Worth a try for sure, but the little that I drink these kinds of brews I would prefer to start with a Hoegaarden and move up from there."
"D- A really refreshing beer; a great summer time beer."
"Harpoon UFO hefeweizen poured yellow, and there was no head, it was also very cloudy. There wasnt much of a smell. It had a good taste, it was lighter, but still semi hoppy. It was easy to drink, and I would go back for another one, certinly would be nice on a hot summer day."
"Overall its drinkability increases from being poured from a tap, the greater carbonation is were the difference lies. It greatly complements the wheat and citrus flavor by having more peppy moutfeel."
"Drinkability was easy. On a hot day after being in the heat, almost too easy :D. I would definitely spend the dollars on this again."
"Yummy beer. I like it when paired with a lemony food. I made a lemon pepper chicken with white rice and it was a great pairing. Good stuff."
"D - In the bottle I think this beer has a great drinkability factor, on tap, it was a lot thicker (not in a good stout kind of way). Would like to try it again on tap. Going to the Harpoon Brewery today, I will try it there."
"Drinkability - two or three at the most, a good evening beer."
"D- Seems like a good beer to me, great beer to help beat the summer heat"
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a weizen glass. A pale hazy gold in color with a big fizzy white head. Sweet cloves are on the nose. The taste follows, not much bannana or fruitiness here. A highly carbonated light bodied brew that is a summertime quaffer. IMO just another Pale wheat ale."
"I loved it. Can you tell?"
"Not a bad offering from Harpoon, an old favorite, that has been explored by me many a times and thus has fallen out of my rotation as a regular buy. It's a good Hefeweisen, a bit above average if you ask me. Yellow and fruity, Harpoon brews this well and consistent so you know what you are getting when you buy it. They charge a fair price for it, relatively cost effective for a micro brew, I recommend it if you've never had it, buy a 6 pack and enjoy."
"Cheers."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is low."
"Unfiltered wheat beer, once served in a weizen glass, has slightly cloudy golden color, thin layer of foam, some sediment in the bottle; Smell: Wheat and lemon; Taste: Predominantly wheat, biscuity malts and floral hops; Mouthfeel: Dry, medium bitterness and slightly spicy, medium body and high carbonation; Drinkability: Acceptable but nothing new."
"I thought this beer looked good and the smell was fantastic. It has a nice color with a small amount of head. The taste however wasnt as impressive. It's a perfectly drinkable beer but not a favorite of mine nor is it the hefeweizen I would suggest to friends."
"Tastes yeasty, with sweet orange-lemon tang. How I would expect fresh lemon peel to taste without the bitterness. Bread yeast aftertaste. Seems like it should have more flavor and body. Very drinkable and refreshing, but reminds me of a stronger version of Budweiser. Definite session beer, especially with the lower abv."
"Taste was definitively citrus, particularly lemon/orange. Pretty standard for a hefeweizen, nothing special. Nice light body, without any real strong finish. Easy to drink, more so than Blue Moon particularly. A good all around beer..."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, total session beer."
"I can't believe that I have not reviewed this beer. A leftover from last weekend's gathering, the bottle was poured into my UFO Hefe glass. Hazy yellow color. Fluffy white head, but it faded quickly. Really fresh, clean, and strong lemon smell. The taste was citrus of course, but it also had a nice wheat and sugar flavor also. No flavors of banana or bubble gum like other more traditional hefes. I let it warm up a bit, and it remained very drinkable. It may not be the most flavorful beer, but it is a very smooth beer and an easy brew to drink. A great warm weather beer or end of the night beer."
"Better hefes out there, unlikely to get this again."
"M- Real smooth, real easy to get it down."
"Pours a cloudy light orange with a slight, bubbly head. Smell is hoppy with lots of grapefruit and orange coming through. Very fresh taste to this beer; had a 'drink by date' of about 4 months after I purchased it so I'm assuming the six pack I bought was recently packaged. Not bitter w/ just the right amount of carbonation. A very enjoyable, solid hefeweizen."
"Pours a cloudy golden with a thin white head. Not much retention,but a nice lace. Aroma is of citrus and wheat. Very weak. Body is on the light side of medium with some carbonation. Taste has a macro edge to it. Hints of banana,and lemony citrus are there...barley. refreshing I guess,but not great."
"Value: If this was about six bucks a six pack, I'd say good. But at my beer store it's like nine bucks a six pack. So no go."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color body, with an average head, white and creamy, not lasting. Lagery smelling, some spicy,, but weak. Light taste, fruity finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Pretty good, some sweet floral taste. Some banana too, some fruitiness."
"Not fantastic, but I can see why this is one of the more popular summer wheats on the market."
"This review was originally posted @ http://thelightonbeer.blogspot.com"
"Drink ability is above average. It's sessionable but the flavors are pretty boring. Dont think I'd buy this beer again"
"Taste is a bit sharp due to high carbonation but still very smooth and creamy due to the wheat. Decent session beer and very drinkable."
"D: A pretty nice American wheat ale. Not the most exciting style, perhaps, but this is well-rounded and has a fair amount of character. A pleasant, accessible beer."
"UFO pours sweetly into the pint glass with great aroma and fluffy white head. A cloudy light straw brew with just enough transparency to allow the proof of carbonation rising through this hefe. Harpoon has really done a wonderful job here crafting a nice American Hefe. Light tasting enough for some non craft drinkers, and just enough clove and banana with a slight hint of juicy fruit for me. UFO does come across a bit thin but this may add to the drinkability... even more so in the summer I would say. I do love a good wheat beer and this is one I greatly enjoy. I am very picky when it comes to wheat brews, I feel a lot of brewers leave balance to the way side, or maybe its just my tastes. Harpoon has a quaffable wheat that will bring a smile to your face as you take another gulp."
"Not too impressed with this one. Hazy yellow with small white head that fades rapidly... smells like a PBR to me--with maybe a touch of wheat. Taste is ok, again a bit like PBR with some wheat, banana, and a hint of lingering hop bitterness. As it warms the taste actually gets worse and more watery. Not enough carbonation for me, not something I'm particularly excited about drinking, although I wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"Pours a light yellow cloudy color with a nice white finger plus head. Fair amount of lacing. Nose is a sweet blend of citrus, yeast and banana, has a little bit of spice in it as well. Taste is mildly sweet with wheat, yeast, little bit of banana and a touch of hop bitterness. Light feel with this beer and a bunch of carb as expected. Crisp refreshing finish. Quite a pleasant hefeweizen I would drink it again. However, I prefer a little bit of clove character to this style and there isn't any in this sample."
"Still, like any weizen this is an easy drinker. If it wasn't so late, I'd crack open the other one in the case. Not Harpoon's best. Hate to admit it, but I like their raspberry UFO more."
"Pours a hazy, yellow color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast, slight hops, slight citrus, hint of sweet malt. Fits the style of an Americna Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight sweet malt, yeast, hint of citrus, and slight grain. Overall, rather bland, but easy drinking."
"Pours a very clear golden color, not horribly unfiltered; lots of bubbles; little initial head, no lacing. Nice clean sweet malty scent, but little in the way of wheat. Clean taste, with more of a sweet lager taste than a nice thick wheat. Goes down very smoothly, but without that little bit of wheat thickness."
"D: Nothing bad about this brew, but not much good to say either. Light and pretty refreshing, but pretty average too. I'm not sure why they decided to call this a hefeweizen because it's not even close."
"D: very drinkable makes a nice light drink without much going on."
"Not terribly impressed."
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer, nothing spectacular, but it's solid and you can put a few back without hitting the floor."
"I will say that the appearance was quite nice - UFO is certainly a nice pouring beer with a beautiful color and nice head. But the taste just doesn't stack up to what I've come to expect both from Harpoon and from hefeweizens in general."
"Pours a hazed golden hue with a healthy sized two finger head and leaves a brilliant layer of lacing around my pint glass. This beer is definitely a bastardized example of a wheat lies under the American wheat category in my opinion. Aroma has slight lemony tones with hints of a metallic offness to it, no special fireworks missing some serious yeast characteristics. The taste is a slight buttery sweetness with some contrasting hop bitterness apparent in the flavor profile. Slight mild banana tones with a nice smoot finish one refreshing beer. Mouthfeel is a light to medium bodied"
"D - Not bad or heavy nice if you want to drink a lot."
"D: This is definitely not my style, but it's more than tolerable. It's very light, but the lasting sweet malt aftertaste is a bit much. I won't shy away from another in the future, but I'm not going out of my way for it."
"Personally: A good, solid well made beer that is a good representative of the style."
"Drinkability: Good with a light meal and light enough to enjoy a few without growing bored, im a fan of the UFO line although they are light hefe's they are smooth and delicious."
"While this beer isn't a great hefeweizen, I think it is a really good wheat beer and can be perfect at the right time and place. A little underrated in my opinion, but I guess it's about right if you're rating the style and not the beer."
"Drink-ability: Easy down just like most of the UFO line, not as light as the raspberry but in my opinion its better that way."
"D: This is an easy drinking wheat, but somewhat bland. There are some aspects of this beer that are really good, but some where it falls flat. I could see where this would appeal to the BMC crowd, who will order a UFO when they are in mood for something ""exotic"". But honestly, there are much better wheats available."
"I've come to see Harpoon beers as examples of mediocrity. They're not bad, but they're also not inspired. This beer is an alright Hefeweizen. It's not great, but drinkable for sure. It's pretty refreshing but I'm thinking it would be much improved with the addition of some lemon as is customary. There's really not much to talk about with this beer. It's just decent and it sells at a fair price."
"Not my favorite hefe and not exactly typical of the style. On the other hand, it was light, refreshing, and easy drinking. A decent summer beer, but it just didn't have the flavor to stand out."
"D. Crisp wheat beer, refreshing, and quenching. A decent beer to drink in the summer at the BBQ. I liked this beer, as it was not a typical hefe."
"D- It's a pretty good drinker. That said, most beers in this category are easy to put back. I'd drink this again if the tap list was on the short side, but I'm not going to seek it out."
"d- will drink again"
"Had this beer at Molly's. a small bar/restaurant in Hanover, NH. A decent hefeweizen. A little watery, though. Doesn't have the kick, the edge that great hefes do. Has a nice citrus aroma, weak head, and fruity flavor. Pretty smooth and very drinkable."
"This beer poured a cloudy dull with lots of very fine sediment. 2 finger of thick, creamy white head that recedes rapidly leaving a good amount of lacing on the glass. Nose is very much of wheat, some spicing though very muted, and a touch of citrus to it (I did not have a lemon with this). Taste is predominantly of wheat, some decent pale malt character to it with accents of spices and citrusy zest to it. This is a lighter to medium body, moderate carbonation, dry finish to it. I had this at a barbeque on an 80 degree day - it completely hit the spot, quenched the thirst and complimented the barbeque."
"Easy to drink and not a bad brew when nothing else is available"
"Pours a pale straw yellow with a decent white head. Aromas are of lemon, dry grass, wheat, and yeast. Tastes are yeast and wheat with a hint of lemon. I think they were going for an American wheat ale, and this is a good representation of that, although the name 'Hefeweizen' on the bottle is misleading as this is not a good representation of a traditional German Hefeweizen."
"Pours a yellow slightly hazy color with a nice head. The aroma is of wheat with a hint of lemon and some other spiciness to it. The taste is of wheat with a little citrus to it. The mouthfeel is good it is dry and not very carbonated. The overall drinkability is okay, you could drink a lot of them, however, the beer isn't very complex and it doesn't give you much to think about."
"This is one of my favorite summer beers. I find it very refreshing and easy to drink. The flavors are pretty mellow, which in this case is a good thing."
"Not bad, but hardly a stand-out."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Since I am reviewing this beer as a American Pale Wheat and not a Hefe I am going to be generous, as a Hefe I'd say this would need a lot more ooomph to get decent reviews."
"Drinkability is great. This will immediately find it's way into my summer collections."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1 inch head. There is a rich, grainy aroma. Taste is good but seemingly mild for a wheat beer. Feels full bodied in the mouth and is fairly drinkable. Overall a pretty darn good effort."
"d- very drinkable, not overly wheaty like some apwas, i'm going to buy a case of this stuff, delicious."
"This is a fantastic looking hefe, but I think the picture on the bottle says it all in that it really needs an orange or lemon slice because the scent & flavor are completely lacking."
"Active carbonation adds sharpness. Nice summer offering, but would not be a regular for me."
"Overall, a major disappointment. Was hoping to find another summer beer for the rotation but this ain't it. Time to get my sister to ship me some Oberon from Indiana again. Don't recommend. One and done for me."
"Poured this into a nice tall glass on a hot evening after a crummy day. Colour is golden and cloudy with a tall white head that leaves a nice bit of lacing. Quite lovely to look at. Smells pleasant, mostly yeasty/bready with some spicy and orange notes it. The mouth feel is sorta thin, which some people may like. The taste is just fine, basically on par with the smell-- citrus is a bit stronger in the taste than the smell lets on though. Still, this one goes down easy, even if its not the best in show. Definitely an awesome alternative to other, more common/popular warm weather brews, especially in my area (Northeast) where its easy to find Harpoon stuff."
"I would recommend this for people who like lighter beers but don't like things like blue moon or shock top."
"Poured hard into a pint glass. Not much head for a hefe, honestly. Smells very faintly of citrus and spices, along with an overwhelming presence of generic grain/grassy scents. I think the nose could use some work. Tastes fairly refreshing, but with not a lot there. The hefe characteristics might be there, but they're not very strong. There's very little hop bitterness. I feel like the beer may have sacrificed some flavor to make it more refreshing. Still, it isn't bad. Also it goes down well on a 90 degree day."
"D- Very high. This beer is the beer that you can get non-beer drinkers to drink. Great on a hot day. Only a spring/summer beer- I couldn't see drinking this in the fall or winter."
"D: Solid example of American wheat. Would mind having again on a hot summer day."
"A solid warm weather beer!"
"Flavor is pretty good, definitely one of the better tasting American wheat beers out there. Lots of bread, a subtle sweetness, and some orangey notes. Lacks the banana character of the great german hefes. Touch of spice and smooth yeastiness. Mouthfeel is smooth, but borders on watery. This makes the beer very drinkable though, and the UFO is definitely one you could have several of. Good wheat beer offering from Harpoon."
"Overall, a very nice beer. Dangerous in summer days. Please, don't follow the label, don't served it with lemon. This beer is great as it is! BTW, lemon served on bottle tops (ie corona) is used to repel flies, not to add flavour..."
"Verdict: Ultimately, I find this to be a just a bit boring. Regardless of any issues of fitting into a specific style, UFO just never really gets my attention. It's tasty enough but I could do with a little more intensity and interest."
"This beer pours out pretty well with a small head that unfortunately evaporates a little quickly, but keeps nice lacing. This beer is pretty gold in color and pretty cloudy and slightly cirtusy in smell. UFO is a pretty sweet tasting beer, like most wheat beers, and its very creamy. Its slightly lemony and slightly spicy. This beer is very light and drinkable, especially on a hot summer day. It's also really good with a nice steak :)"
"A slightly hazy pale yellow pour finishes off with a two plus finger white head which fades fast. The color is a bit clear around the edges. Some good chunks of lacing linger around. Notes of straw and bananas rise to the nose. A bit of coriander works itsef in toward the end. Tastes malty and spicy. Some wheat chaff exists. Whatever fruity notes that existed aromatically are gone. Mouth-feel is light, and there's not a whole lot of carbonation going on. Very drinkable brew that suffers for taste."
"."
"A good beer, but nothing special, in my opinion."
"edit: half a year+ later and not much difference but i would say this is more drinkable and had a much nicer look to it as i poured it into a real wheat glass....huge ice white head that laces in beautiful globs and sheens."
"M/D - decent carbonation but not alot of flavor. its a good summer beer for any type of drinker, but don't expect to get alot out of it. For some reason i remember it being better, but i guess not."
"D - Nice easy drinking beer but without the interesting phenols that I like in a good Hefeweizen. Not a bad wheat beer."
"12oz. Pours a pale straw yellow with a decent white head. Aromas are of lemon, dry grass, wheat, and yeast. Tastes are yeast and wheat with a hint of lemon. I think they were going for an American wheat ale, and this is a good representation of that, although the name 'Hefeweizen' on the bottle is misleading as this is not a good representation of a traditional German Hefeweizen."
"Honestly ladies and gents... this beer is for anyone who wants to drink a true unfiltered wheat beer. It is the one of the best in this category. I think that it compares nicely with a Blue Moon in the fact that each deserves a taste of citrus with it, but I do believe that this beer deserves a true lemon sqeeze to be fully enjoyed."
"Very cloudy, hazy pour. Decent head but fades quickly. Smells of wheat and yeasty esters and a bit of dryness. Nice tasting beer. Banana, clovey flavors. Finishes dry. A bit rough on the palate at first, seems to calm after the third and fourth sips. Very drinkable, highly drinkable. A bit over carbonated. A pretty good hefe overall. I will reach for this one again."
"> DRINKABIITY - 3.0 - It's an okay beer, but I would not pursue it. This was introduced to me a gift for a home brew beer tasting I hosted. Give it a try if you dig wheat beers. It's not bad, it's just not great. A very clean American wheat type example."
"edit: I would like to amend this review by saying that I had a recent sample and this beer has been significantly watered down since the last time I had it, or the batch I have is just not very good. I would rate this beer far lower if I was reviewing it for the first time today."
"Taste is not very good. Too much tangy wheat flavor gives it a nearly corn adjunct flavor. It is not a horrible wheat beer, but calling it a hefeweizen is a travesty. I want more of the soft banana and clove flavors typical of German hefe's, not this harsh, brittle husky wheat taste I get here. The six pack I bought will not go to waste, but I dont think I will be buying this again."
"This beer has a pale yellow or straw color in the glass. I found it to be surprisingly clear for an unfiltered beer. There is a minimal head. The nose is spot on with what you would expect as the banana and clove speak clearly. There is a little bit of bitterness in the flavor that wasn't anticipated. Overall its a smooth and simple beer that I will choose to refer to as ""not memorable"" rather than ""unimpressive."""
"Overall not bad but I lean for more full flavored specimens."
"M/D- Filmy on the roof of the mouth. Great for a nice summer day"
"Bring on the underappreciated APWA. Cloudy golden yellow pour with aromas of cereal grains, and slight citrusy hops. Clean, mostly. Taste is light and unoffensive, with a lemon zest bitterness paired with subdued whole wheat bread sweetness. Mouthfeel is very crisp, with a high carbonation level (apropos for style IMHO) and a clean finish. Its an easy drinking American wheat and refreshingly refreshing."
"Cheers!!"
"I suppose this is not a bad summer sipper and so for drinkability I will give it some props, however overall I was personally disappointed."
"Overall, this is a good summertime quaffer."
"Notes: Pretty solid American hefe'. I could knock back a few of these while sitting on a dock and fishing on a sunny afternoon. In fact I have done that, and it was awesome. A very light, refreshing beer."
"No clove, no banana. Overall, fizzy swill that needs a lemon or an orange to be palatable."
"Poured into a chalice glass, this is certainly a pretty beer: very pale, and quite cloudy, straw color, nearly wit-like, with a colossal head on top. The nose, though, is disappointingly bland, with a grainy wheat aroma and nothing else. The flavor is assertively grainy, to its detriment. There's little else here, except a lightly tart fruitiness. It might be refreshing on a really hot day, but I can't see a reason to drink it at any other time."
"MF&D - Not horrible, but I wouldn't recommend it either. Not my idea of a Hefeweizen, not even an American version."
"overall - A disappointing beer. I was hoping for better from the Harpoon Brewery. Maybe I just got a bad bottle. Either way, it's not terrible, but it's definitely not memorable. I probably won't buy this one again."
"Notes- Goes down smooth. Would be very refreshing on a hot, summer day."
"poured from 12 oz. bottle into hefeweizen glass. pours a very cloudy yellow almost hint of gold. a pretty nice white soapy head that had some pretty good retention. some nice sticky lacing as well. very nice hefe aroma going on., with the yeast at the front. mainly bananna, phenolics, lemon, grains. kinda let down by the taste a little. was expecting more of a hefe kinda taste, like in the aroma, but right off the first sip it reminded me almost exactly like a bud. pretty watery, a slight lemon/wheaty taste at first, finishs with the yeast. only slightly better than a macro as far as the taste. has light body to it, and a pretty good amount of carbonation, worked pretty well with this. these can easily be drank all night long, but i could see myself craving something more flavorful after a couple. i wouldnt recommend this to anyone."
"This offering is a golden yellow until the yeast is awakened. Then it looks like a thin cloud that is blocking the sun behind it. The yeast is very fine and almost unnoticeable. The scent that comes from the glass is lemony in nature with slight yeasty undertones. Since you can see them, they might as well be part of the scent, right? Tasting this beer is really where the lemon esters come to life. I really don't know why people put fruit in this beer. Light bodied and passes down the throat quickly. Can be enjoyed with just a few or many few."
"D- OK for what it is."
"D-Very drinkable because of the lightness of the beer."
"D: Goes down smooth. Would be very refreshing on a hot, summer day."
"Not a bad beer, but really could be a lot more balanced."
"D- A fulfilling beer and two or three of these and you would feel like you had a 3 course meal. A nice brewto relax with but not to pound back."
"D- Pretty drinkable beer, but it may be a little to high in wheat balance for my tastes."
"This isn't a bad wheat ale. It's no frills and has the makings of a good beer for a hot day, I just want more carbonation and a little bit more of an interesting characteristic throughout."
"D: goes down easy, as it should"
"Nikki"
"Great tasting, very refreshing beer. A bit tangy on the malt and fruits side, but well-balanced, hop finish. I didn't get the very grainy taste of a wheat beer like most American wheats like Sierra Nevada's. It remains flavorful in spite of its category, which is terrific. Wonderful mouthfeel and just an overall good beer. The only reason I wouldn't rate it any higher is because although it is a wonderful brew, I'm not sure if it's particularly challenging, in terms of flavor profile."
"D: Nice summery brew..."
"As to the flavor again not much of one but nothing bad either. There is a very silky feel in your mouth which makes this a very easy drinking beer."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of 04/15/09 331. I am not a big unfiltered wheat ale fan but this one is one of the better ones I have tried. It pours the cloudy pale yellow that it is supposed to pour and rousts up a decent supply of fizzy, white head. If I was drinking this in a dark room I would be able to tell immediately that it is an unfiltered wheat ale by the aroma. It is nicely balanced. The mouth feel is medium and the taste is smooth and lightly hopped. It is one of the few Hefe's I would buy again."
"I was really not expecting much with this beer, but it turned out to be a nice surprise. Can't say if I favor this over Blue Moon though (one of my favorite beers actually)."
"5/4/5/3/10 (2.7/5)"
"This is an American Wheat disguised as a Hefe, I don't know why these American brewers can't or won't brew an honest to goodness version of this style. Perhaps it's not in the cards, regardless for a wheat this is decent but calling itself a Hefe is an insult to the real thing. Musty aroma, nice golden yellow pour ever so slightly cloudy, moderate fullness with an easy finish, wheat malt light and dry. Not even close to an authentic beer of this style. I just realized that it's categorized as an AW, so I will bump it up a couple notches since it's a semi-decent American Wheat."
"Drinkability: A fine, light wheat ale, but it's certainly no hefe. It's refreshing, sure, but a bit lacking overall. If you're looking for an authentic hefeweizen, you best look elsewhere."
"Tap @ the Bell In Hand. An American Wheat that borders on the German Hefe. Cloudy yellow with a stubborn white head. Aroma is wheat with some spice without the banana. The banana does creep in slightly in the taste, but this is mostly wheaty and yeasty. Very good."
"Moderate carbonation and a nice wheat taste make this a very nice wheat ale."
"D: This one is very drinkable wished I would have opted for the sixer instead of the single."
"This bottle was one of several leftovers from a recent party. I don't think I'll be buying UFO for myself anytime soon. Now I just have to dump the rest on someone else and free up the fridge space."
"This beer would be good for non-craft drinkers. It reminds me of a macro-brew. I love wheat beers but this one left me wanting more."
"Bought the winter sample pack. Good appearance: cloudy pale yellow-slight gold with a thin, frothy head and good lacing. Aromas of grainy citrus were apparent to me with a metallic after-aroma as well. Dull bitter, watery taste in general. Lagging metallic sour flavor also hinders the drink. Decent mouthfeel; nice and carbonated. Overall, not too bad but lagged in the flavor department."
"I have to say though, this is better on draught!"
"Drinkability: Could drink these all day. Very refreshing and solid overall. Nothing too special, but good."
"A refreshing summer beer (even though I'm drinking it in November). This one is a little higher on the citrus side in my opinion."
"D - Ranks pretty high in the wheat drinkability scale, the mouthfeel being the biggest pull for it's drinkability ranking."
"D: It was a tasty brew with a nice flavor and beautiful presnece. It may be a bit heavy and rich for a session brew."
"One of the most boring/bland Hefe's I've come across. Really nothing at all special about it, almost cookie cutter like. Cloudy golden appearance with the usual Hefe aromas and taste. Is drinkable for sure but would I ever ask for it? Probably never."
"Not my favorite hefe, not anything terrible either."
"Drinkability: Not bad, and I could have a few of these, but there are other hefeweizens that catch my eye that I'm willing to pay a little extra for. Overall not a bad choice, and in many ways a good choice, but nothing TOO special."
"A decent offering and a good introduction to the hefeweizen style. A great beer for the summertime."
"I had this beer in its bottled form a few years back and I remember not being too impressed. I have since refined my taste in beer so i thought I would give it another shot. Had it on tap at Blue Smoke BBQ in NYC. At first glance it looks like a very impressive hefe. Nice and cloudy, maybe a little lighter than normal. The head had dissipated by the time the waitress brought it to our table. The taste still didn't impress me. It is too yeasty. The strong taste of yeast dominates the beer. There are definitely better Hefe's on the market. I'm a huge fan of the raspberry version of this beer and it has nowhere near as much yeast taste to it as this one does."
"Overall a decent wheat beer. Wish I had access to more of it. However, I would say 312 Wheat from GI is close enough to make it fly."
"Nothing special here. Yellow and moderately cloudy in color with a small white head. Slightly sour, musty flavor to it and it wasn't all that refreshing, especially for a ""refreshing"" type of beer. I did taste a bit of lemon as well but the beer in general was quite weak and watery. I enjoyed their IPA so I'll just stick to that one if I'm going to get a Harpoon."
"D - A highly drinkable offering that would make a good intro for someone to Hefe's."
"Bottle: Poured a lightly hazy golden color wheat beer with a medium size foamy head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma consists of light wheat malt with no discernable trace of banana or cloves. Taste is also dominated by some weak notes of wheat malt with no discernable ester of banana that I usually appreciated in this style. Quaffable on a hot summer day but not really interesting."
"Poured a cloudy straw colored gold with a very appealing thick white head. Pleasant floral hops aroma along with banana and some citrus. The tastes are similar. Banana again, some nuttiness (banana bread with walnuts? Weeeird..) The wheat becomes clear here too esp. as it warms a little. The mouthfeel is good, with a light/medium body and a high carbonation that doesn't prevent it from having a smooth finish. Slightly odd but drinkable."
"A hot day drinker --- many better ones out there, but still fairly respectable. Decent match for pub grub."
"Pours a nice hazy blonde with sediment kicking around. Produces a rather thin head that vanishes quickly. Smells of citrus fruit (mostly lemon) and a little spice, although the smell is not as powerful as other beers of the variety that I've had. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly. Tastes of mild citrus and sweetness. The flavor does not linger at all, as there is virually no aftertaste. It's very drinkable and it goes down easy."
"If the label said APWA instead of hefe, I would slam this less. But it says hefe, and if that's what they were going for, they failed miserably. Hint to harpoon, it's all in the esters, which require actually using a hefe yeast!"
"I think this is a good middleman between full-out hefeweizen and American Pale Wheat. I can imagine both Paulaner and Blue Moon cousins to this brew. I can see it in either style, but feel pretty comfy just calling it a damn good Americanized Hefe. Refreshing and delicious, my only complaint is that there wasn't quite enough."
"Served a cloudy pale yellow with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is the standard sweet fruits and bubblegum with some slight crisp hops in the back. The taste is more of the same, crisp sweet fruits and bubblegum. The beer is light crisp and very easy drinking. This one, like the Widmer Bros. version, is pretty much textbook to the style."
"Comes out of the tap an opaque, cloudy golden. The wheaty aroma has a hint of lemon, even without the obligatory lemon wedge. Flavor is smooth, malty and wheaty, crisp and satisfying, with a touch of lemon; it seems just a little bit thin but is still worthy. Texture is lively and tingly."
"D - A great refreshing hefeweizen, though not up to par with the German hefeweizens that I enjoy more. A great beer to drink outside in the summer."
"Hazy, casually bubbly lemony body that intensifies up the glass... white head swiftly, disappointingly settles to a rather thin line... lemon zest and light yeast are dominant scents; a bit of hay and pilsner-like malt... slightly fizzy on the teeth and tongue, with little substance or character--not insulting, just not memorable... fresh, light yeasts--a bit watered down--with the late flavor of lemon the only recognizable presence... knowing Harpoon's reputation, this is a bit of a surprise, not pushing or presenting any facet of the genre into an upper echelon of enjoyability.... still, quite drinkable on 95-degree days such as this, and the lack of weight is at least appropriate this afternoon..."
"D: Easy to drink, but more flavor would make it a delight to drink."
"D. It is fairly drinkable, but nothing I will be seeking out again. I cannot recommend this."
"D: Easy to drink with a good ABV. Just not tasty enough and with some odd flavors."
"D- Easy to drink, refreshing and could put a few of these away."
"D: Overall less then average drinkability and enjoyment, rather boring, bland and not really impressed."
"Overall- A very solid, drinkable wheat beer. This beer is awesome during the summer. I could see this being my regular session beer especially in the Louisiana heat. Too bad they don't distribute here."
"Smooth and medium-light bodied. Refreshing and very drinkable."
"D: I found the light flavors and body to be refreshing, and the quick clean finish was nice too. A nice all-around general hangin' out kinda brew."
"D: A decent hefe, good for a warm summer day, would not be my preference, but I would not turn one away by any means."
"This beer has a bland aroma. Sweet banana and clove with some yeast. Sweet fruity malt flavors that are inoffensive, but work well for what this beer is. A thin and watery mouthfeel, but an easy drinking beer for the summertime. As far as American Pale Wheat Ales go, this might be the best I have had. That doesn't say very much for the style though. I am not saying this is a bad beer, just a bit underwhelming."
"Aroma is simple, fresh and malty. Mouthfeel crisp and light, high carbonation, refreshing. The overall impression of thsi beer is of a high-quality macrolager...the taste is really not distinctive except that the brew is noticably more tart than a macrolager. Clean, refreshing, hint of sourness from the wheat playing off clean malt and bitterness. Nice, great for warm weather."
"Something to have for a hot summer day,for it's style there are better representations. One should still keep an open mind and try something new every now and then. I will buy this again."
"TASTE: when cold it was very crispy and not too yeasty. Some fruit like bananna came through. After awhile it loses some of its taste. The Heffe, lefta!"
"D- Ick."
"D: For the price you can get a real German heff that is 100 times better/ Harpoon needs to overhaul this beer to keep up. I remember liking this beer when I was younger. Now it is nothing more than what I like to call ""summer water"""
"D: You can drink it. Nothing fantastic, but nothing that damns it either. Decent Hefe."
"I find it interesting that the beer on the label has a lemon on the glass considering most of the beer community frowns upon this."
"The color is a pale light yellow with a light hazy appearance. Its head builds up thick but fads out quickly leaving a thin ring of bubbles. The aroma has some lemon and light wheat malt notes. The flavor has delicate sweet lemon and wheat with a hint of banana in the finish. It has a light body with average carbonation and an abrupt finish. I have had this same beer on tap and remember it being fuller bodied with deeper more complex flavor."
"I've tried this beer three times prior to writing this review. The first time I poured more than half the glass down the drain. After revisiting it time and time again, it first of all approaches nothing near a decent hefe, and secondly it tastes like I'm drinking the water from the mud puddle that the hose left. After drinking it's tolerable, but the obtrusive dirt-like flavor makes it a tough beer to stomach."
"We had so much of this stuff at Total Wine and it just wasn't selling so I gave it a try. It wasn't too bad. Poured a cloudy hay color with a good little head. Smelled sweet and citrusy wit a mild lemon zest. Taste was yeast, wheaty, hint of citrus, and little sweet and a clean finish. I liked the unfilitered texture."
"M/D - Somewhat grainy feel to it. A good hefe to have around for the summer."
"Overall-A nice refreshing wheat beer, not the best in terms of complexity or character but you can't go wrong with its taste and refreshment. Solid."
"Overall nothing special about this Hefeweizen, not bad, but not world-class either."
"D: To me, this is a pretty average beer. Not exactly what I would call complex. I'll stick to the German hefeweizen cousins."
"This is a really good wheat ale - certainly my favorite of the style. I'm not a wheat/white beer fan, but this is a pretty refreshing beer. Light in color with a bit of cloudiness and a strong citrus flavor. Light-to-medium bodied, this is certainly a good beer for cookouts and any summer outing."
"Pours an almost clear yellow with a thinner white head. Nose is like earth and a bit dusty. Touch of citrus and fruit give a slightly sweet edge to it. Flavor is earthy. There is just a touch of banana here. Really if it weren't for that I'd swear I was drinking a helles or something. Feel is okay. This is an average beer. I suppose it's a nice mellow more mass marketed brew than anything. It's okay I guess."
"I which I had a lemon to complement it but it was good just like that, this was a 12 sample pack bought in the store."
"I consider this to be a slightly better than average american wheat beer. Good auroma and flavors but it still leaves room for improvement."
"I found it to be tremendously drinkable. I could drink three or four and the last would be as equally satisfying as the first. I didn't try it but I bet it would be really tasty with some spicy seafood or shellfish. Whether or not you like the style, it's hard to deny the refreshingness of this one."
"This would be one of the wheats I prefer because I am not a big fan of strong wheaty flavors. I imagine those who prefer this style might rate this a little bit lower. No fatal flaws; it is easy to drink."
"this beer poured a nice straw color with very little head. the smell was faint of hops and a spice i can't put my finger on. this beer tastes good. nice and balanced. a bit bitter and a bit sweet. finishes a bit dry. the mouthfeel is nice for a pale ale, light and carbonated. normally i wouldn't go for this style beer, but i could drink a few of these, especially with some spicy boiled shellfish."
"12 oz bottle. The brew pours a very very light straw color with a finger of white head over top. The clarity on this one is pretty minimal and there is a strong carbonation of large bubbles. This one is much lighter than most American wheat brews that I am used to. The aroma is very wheaty with a bit of creamyness in there, but overall, there is not a whole lot going on in this one. The first sip brings a fairly grainy flavor that is overlayed with a wheat creamyness. There is some very faint lemon zest hiding in the background that comes on in the finish. There is a touch of herbal/floral hop in there that just kisses the side of my tongue along with a mild bitterness, and these flavors really blend into the grainyness overall. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. It has more body than I would have expected, but this is a good thing for this brew. Overall, this one is not a bad example of the style. It has a nice residual hop flavor and mild bitterness that carry through on the finish. I wasn't expecting the grainy character, so that is a little of a detraction, but this one would be pretty refreshing on a warm day."
"D: easy drinking. could enjoy a number of these"
"Just an all-around good offering from Harpoon. My only complaint is that it's too clear for a hefeweizen, but the color is right-on. Bready aroma, crisp bite and a slightly tart light flavor make it extremely drinkable. As far as an American Wheat, this is one I would give to people as a classic example."
"D--Not bad. Certainly on par with other American wheats but not very distinctive. Great if fresh."
"Harpoon UFO pours a hazy pale yellow with a sticky head. The aroma is a soft, slightly yeasty maltiness. The flavor is dry and grainy with none of the banana and clove flavors I would expect from a hefe. This would be a good beer to help transition from macro's but I think its kind of lacking."
"All around good hefe."
"Pours a cloudy blond with a large head which leaves some attractive lacing on the glass. The nose is comprised of a slightly floral bouquet with a bit of an alcohol bite. A sip begins with a yeasty wheat flavor followed by notes of apple and banana- similar to other Hefeweizens. It has a soft sweet almost bubblegum finish which is nice as it is not heavy or overpowering. A simple brew but very drinkable. I liked it more and more as the evening wore on, a solid American wheat ale and a good session beer."
"D-Above average, a very good beer. Goes well with fish and chicken dishes. shrimp as well."
"Poured into a weizen glass and received lots of carbonation that led to a one-finger head that kinda stayed w/ the drink. The body of the beer is very pale yellow, visible all the way through which isn't bad but normally hefe's are cloudy. This didn't have an overt spicy or distinctive fruit smell, but rather just a slightly earthy citrus smell. It didn't taste like a normal hefe either. There were no sharp spices/clove that caught the tongue, no real banana or orange or something of that nature that was picked up or anything like a fruity aftertaste on the backbite. For those who like their hefe's/wheat beers real light on the citrus and more leaning on the hoppy part will like this beer a lot, but I tend to stray towards the more sweeter, fruitier hefe's/wheat. On the plus side, this is a very smooth beer that I kept tipping the glass back. I just expected more of this beer, and there are other hefe's I would pick over this."
"This is the first American hefe's I have reviewed. As a German who has drank hefeweizen bier at the Munich Hofbrau I may be a little critical! Poured into a Weihenstephan Weiss glass, light hazy golden color,no real hazy yeast swirling though like the most weizen. Aroma of citrus, light yeast. No bananas,cloves to speak of. Taste is dissapointing. Don't get me wrong, as a light citrus-flavored beer, its good, but doesn't taste like a real hefe-weizen. good drinkability due to its lightness."
"UFO Hefeweizen pours a hazy golden yellow with a thick white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The flavor is very wheaty, in an American wheat beer kind of way. Not really a hefe in my opinion, no clove or bubblegum, but a solid wheat beer nonetheless. Worth a try, sessionable."
"Really sort of a light and fluffy beer. Heavy on the citrus. Very drinkable beer, something I might want outside on a hot day."
"This brew pours to a semi cloudy yellow color with a good sized white head that had some retention and left a little lacing. The brew is quite effervescent, reminds me a little of soda as the way it seems to fizzle when freshly poured, have not noticed that before? The aroma had a nice but light wheat smell mixed with a slight spiciness. Also is a bit of lemon there. The taste has similar properties that the aroma highlighted but seems slightly dull, seems to lack much character. I can see that this would be an easy drinking brew but I feel that there are many more offerings that do not lack the taste that this brew seems to do. Admitidly I would get this brew in the summer as it is so easy drinking and while being basic as I have suggested is refreshing."
"Not a bad beer, but a little on the soapy side, a little light, too much lemony flavors, too watery. Not my favorite hefe weizen by a long shot. The beer pours a slightly cloudy consistency, but barely so. The head is pretty tame, the smell is a bit chemically, some banana, clove, other spices, but not all that enticing. The taste is just too watery, too light bodied, not enough of the banana flavors and not enough syrupy consistency to leave much of an impression. The carbonation is probably a little flatter than it shoudl be as well. It's an okay beer, but that's all one can say."
"Recommend skipping this hefe and going to Harpoon's own Raspberry Hefeweizen that improves on the blandness of the regular."
"Drinkability: This is a well balanced Hefe, a solid offering but nothing spectacular."
"D - Overall okay, though I suspect it is quite drinkable due to it's inoffensive nature. Take it or leave it here. I suppose I wouldn't turn one down if offered, but I doubt I'll seek it out anytime soon."
"Out of a bottle, this brew poured a really nice hazy, yellow, and cloudy appearance which excited me first... The smell was very wheaty with citrus and coriander notes which were very fitting for a wheat beer... Taste-wise, the brew didn't match it's positive smell, and for lack of a better word, was somewhat bland in comparison to other wheat beers that I've sampled... I was somewhat let down and could best describe this particular sample as only average, though not bad... The flavor just wasn't too exciting, although the beer offered a good mouthfeel... The drinkability was also pretty decent, although not something I'd want to drink more than one or two of in a single setting... not very exciting and not sure if I'd purchase another sixer... I would recommend this one, being a slightly above average sample...."
"D - This is pretty easy to drink while not the best hefe out there its pretty good and worth a try"
"This is often a beer I chose when going to a mainstream bar with limited tap selection. The good thing about the Boston area is that there is always a Harpoon or Sam Adams to fall back on. It's kinda cloudy with decent head retention. The qualities of this beer stand out when using appropriate glassware. This is not the greatest sipping beer, but it goes down easy enough to make a night of it."
"Pours a cloudy, pale yellow. Little head retention and lacing. Aroma is heavy on the citrus, but it mainly just tastes watery. Some malt flavors and the mouthfeel has ""some"" texture, but mainly it was just too thin for me to highly enjoy. I might have a difference of opinion if I have it again in the summer."
"i had this one in my fridge ; pours a hazy light gold w/ a slight white head which dissapates quickly, little lacing ; a ""macro"" smell w/ some faint wheat-like characteristics, a little bananna/lemon in there somewhere as well as an indescribable undertone ( olive oil ??); a rather light taste, almost watered down, a tart fruity taste w/ a faint malty/wheaty flavor, the ""olive oil"" undertone is present here as well ; light bodied and highly carbonated, still feels thin w/ a more ""wet"" feel ; pretty drinkable, i had to have 2 for my review..."
"Drinkability is good, as they definitely go down easy! Still, I'd rather my usual Paulaner or Franziskaner."
"This is a pretty good hefeweizen. It has a nice golden yellow color with a thick white head that sticks to the side of the glass. It has a delicious malty and fruity wheat aroma that comes through in the taste. It tastes really fresh for a hefeweizen and I would recommend this beer is you are a hefeweizen fan. The fruity taste from the yeast comes through the wheat flavor that is really refreshing."
"Drinkability: Very highly drinkable. This beer is a working man's beer. Light in the mouth and super quenching. Not much sugar or residual flavors. Not spectacular in other areas but this is something that would let 100 ounces go down easily."
"This beer poured a golden straw color with a light foamy two-finger head that stayed for a little while with some lacing. The smell wasn't very strong, but I think I caught a little bit of a yeast smell with a tad of citrus. The taste was pretty mellow for a wheat beer, with a very mild taste that is very refreshing with a bit of a dry finish. Interestingly enough, this is the mildest tasting hefeweizen I have tried and I'm not sure whether that is a credit or a detriment, I suppose it all depends on what you're looking for. This is a very unassuming beer, and I wish I had a lemon slice to complement the already present light citrus flavor. This would be a great beer to have on a hot steamy summer night, and I definitely plan on keeping a couple in the fridge next summer."
"Nice straw colored appearance. Smell is nothing awe-inspiring, but rather pleasant. I really like unfiltered wheat bears, and while there was some yeast in the mix, it was minimal. Nice citrusy finish, but I really recommend serving with lemon to draw out the flavor. I neglected to purchase one initially, and held off on the review until I was able to supplement the brew with lemon. It really makes the beer. Very drinkable and nice alternative to traditional summer brew beers."
"I'd have another if offered, it's not that bad."
"D - Probably the strong point of this brew is the drinkability. Very light and easy drinking for the summer, but with enough flavour to not be boring."
"Mouthfeel very thin, with a smooth overall character."
"Pours a hazy pale orange color with a dense white head. The smell is faint, wheat malt, not much else. The taste is rather bland, even for an American pale wheat. Wheat malt with a very slight touch of hops, maybe a hint of citrus. The feel is light, crisp, and most refreshing, perfectly carbonated. This is the first wheat beer, including true Hefes, that I ever had back in the day. One of my favorite Harpoon's to drink during their seasonal Harpoon fests. While the taste is rather bland, this is very refreshing summer time brew."
"D: My least favorite Harpoon. Refreshing and easy drinking but lacking much wheat character. There's just not much too it."
"I have had much better renditions of the style."
"It's light bodied and wonderfully drinkable. Might be close to the end of the season, but there are going to be many days left in which I can finish my six-pack."
"Not too impressed with the UFO out of the bottle. I remember having this on tap at the brewery in Boston, and liking it much better - which probably shouldn't be surprising. None existant head retention, almost looks like a slightly hazy generic lite beer. The UFO lacks a lot of punch and doens't hold a candle to almost any of the European presentations of the style."
"Harpoon puts out another very serviceable ale. It doesn't lose points for being poured into a standard pint glass, but adds so much more if poured into its own Hefe vessel. Will def. get again."
"Pours relatively cloudy yellow with medium to strong aroma. Deep frothy head provided poured correctly will provide excellent tangy taste at first then measured complexity to the finish. Excellent for a hot summer day in the backyard whilst grilling."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer - goes down real easy, definitely a summer session beer."
"Overall I was really quite impressed and damn near blown away by this. Just a downright nasty good hefe. Highly recommend"
"D: Goes down easy, but hefe's are just not my thing."
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow with a thin head that quickly dissipated. The smell has many components that are not overpowering including grain, esters, and yeast. The taste is light and the wheat is noticeable. There is a slight banana flavor as well. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. I find this to be a good wheat ale and would probably be at the top of my list when searching for that style."
"Drinkability- One of the more drinkable beers Ive had in awhile, not overpowering with heavy flavors or a beer that fills you up."
"Slightly hazy, pale straw color with some large-bubbled carbonation. The substantial, bright, off-white head is made up of fine (and at first fizzy) bubbles that last longer than expected, eventually falling away into a thin collar. I don't see the ""unfiltered"" part, though. Smell invokes a weak-grained pilsner initially but rounds out soon after. The wheaty grains remain in the nose, of course, but are joined by a bit of spice and hints of buttered popcorn. Light, clean grains dominate the taste, which is itself nicely complemented by the light, crisp mouthfeel. I prefer a German hefeweizen anytime, but this fits into its niche nicely."
"Pours a cloudy light orange-ish color with no head at all. In the smell, a yeasty charcteristic is prominate with a small citrus undertone. It does taste citrusy with a dry end. It also have somewhat of a tartness to it as well. Very smooth, goes down easy. I really liked that ever so small tartness that hands around at the end."
"D- I'll have it again in a pinch. It's not too bad. But it's far from the best."
"Poured a nice, golden cloudiness from 12oz bottle with a feathery head. At first whiff, smell was of cloves and banana, with a certain maltiness to it. Taste was really nice; banana and clove notes shine through and work together with the sweetness of the malt. Maybe toasted malt? Mouthfeel was genuine and lingering, felt as though I could chew the beer. Overall, this is definitely worth a try, especially on a hot summer day. Great example of an American Hefe."
"D - It was a pretty good pale wheat ale. Nothing particularly amazing but certainly good."
"Notes: I've graded this as though I were drinking a Hefe, which is how the label describes it. As an American Pale Wheat Ale (which is how BA labels it) it would score higher. This simply doesn't meet the Hefe style. Which doesn't make it a bad beer -- just mis-labeled. . . . I should also note that I've had this with a lemon, as the six-pack holder recommends, and frankly enjoyed it as a light, refreshing summer beer. Definitely worth a try, just don't expect a Hefe. . . ."
"Drinkability: As an American Pale Wheat this excels, but as a Hefe it disappoints; the website calls it an Amercan Pale Wheat but it is labeled as a Hefe; the average beer consumer is confused enough by beer styles - craft breweries should not contribute to further confusion"
"A friend recommended this one to me but that quickly stated that it didn't taste like he'd remembered. Pours a light yellow, slightly opaque color with a touch of white head on top. Looks pretty good. Nose is very mild, even a little grainy - not what I expected out of a so called Hefeweizen. Taste is more of the same. Fairly bland, maybe a little salty, some standard wheat and a touch of yeast. Really fairly blah - nothing much going on flavorwise. Pretty thin in terms of feel, with an okay carbonation. Overall, its an okay Pale Wheat that I wouldn't recommend cause there are better ones available."
"Cold bottle poured into a chilled pint glass. Nice looking beer, cloudy pale yellow with a foamy white head. Smell is a faint grassy, wheatish aroma. Taste, is light and crisp, tastes of wheat and citrus.Mouthfeel is nice, light bodied, medium carbonation, very pleasant. Overall this is a nice summer time , warm weather ale. Very Drinkable."
"So if you have ever seen Top Gun you will get my next reference. This beer is writing checks that its body can't cash."
"This is a nice summer beer, especially with a piece of lemon. Appearance is bit cloudy - admittedly, this is probably typical of the style... A solid beer for quaffing, drinking in quantity, on a hot summer day, etc. - but, if you are looking for a beer to savor and/or ponder, this just isn't it - it seems to deteriorate in the mouth. Bottom line, though - I'd buy it again."
"poured from a 12 oz. bottle with date stamped on the neck. hazy straw yellow with a two finger white head that held to a quarter inch and some fair lacing to the finish. aromas of wheat, yeast, and spice are there but weak. taste, wheat malt, yeasty, grainy, this beer needs some spice to kick it up. mouthfeel light, carbonation ok. this beer needs to get spiced up but still not bad but would not be my first choice."
"I wouldn't turn down another one. Might be a bit too much to session with."
"In summary, an unchallenging, simple American hefe, though not one without redeeming value. It's cold. It's tasty. It goes down easy. Quality easy-drinking beer when it's hot outside, you're thirsty, and just want to toss back a cold one or two."
"Pours a light pale color. Head smells of light citrus with some clove. Taste is similar and pretty smooth for a hefe. I would say however that it's not as full-bodied as I would hope and that despite that it represents the style pretty well. Definitely a good beer to introduce someone to the style."
"Drinkability: could do two or three in a night; doesnt wear you out"
"cool bottle no production date that could be seen, it pored a little cloudy but settled in a few seconds. The smell was not overpowering but you could tell that this was a wheat beer. Typical beer taste with a little lemon at the end. Could easily drink a six pack"
"overall- an average wheat beer. i think my friends like them more than i do. i dont think i'll buy these again, but it definatly isnt a bad choice in general"
"I like this beer and find it to be highly drinkable, as a matter of fact, my glass is empty and I'm going to have another. I will buy this beer again."
"This is the first Harpoon beer I've had in a few years. Either I'm spoiled by all of the ""good"" beer I've been drinking or they've lost a step with the rest of the craft brewers out there."
"Drinkability: Okay. I drink this while riding a lawn mower."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color on tap, with lots of sediment settling at the bottom of the glass. A great looking huge white head sits atop the brew with good retention. Pleasing aromas of lemon, light banana, and a grassy hop presence. Flavors of citrus, mild spice and banana, and the grassy hops round out the brew nicely. Not a ton of clove spice but thats OK. Highly drinkable, and a great American version of the Hefe."
"Poured from a bottle into a wheat glass, pours a nice yellow haze with lots of carbonation and a thick 2 finger head that leaves thick lace on the glass. Smell is of lemon and lime with a sour backdrop. Taste is very sour and bitter with a ton of cabonation going on, the taste was all over the place, heavy burn from the carbonation to a lemon lime sourness that burns a bit going down. I like to have my hefe with that clove aftertaste, this tastes like a carbonated mess, I will pass on this again."
"Drinkability: A pleasant, unobtrusive wheat beer with a good drinkability and feel, it could use a little more flavor imo but whats there is very clean and balanced. Good for warm weather."
"Drinkability - Not a bad beer, enjoyed it. part of Harpoon, and I love Harpoon. It is good beer. Not to hit the rasberry UFO."
"D - It is okay. Pretty easy to drink. Not really worth having. A bit better than most american wheats since it is mild in its offensive characteristics. Not really worth the money."
"Drinkability - A nice summer beer that most people should be able to enjoy."
"Drinkability- the light taste (that is actually good) and the low carbonation makes this beer very drinkable-good for summer (or anytine)"
"I bought this beer as part of a mixed 12 pack. It was nice and cloudy, gold in color. It smelled of yeast and banana, maybe a slight clove scent and even citrus. It tasted like a decent hefeweizen should, but not great. As with most American hefeweizens, I wasn't blown away. It was bubbly, like a weizen should, but not overly fizzy. It would be a good summer time beer."
"I could see drinking this anytime as it was very accessible and it will make an excellent beer to serve to friends this Summer. Now all I need is to find this on draft...and it could be a worthy contender for my annual Halloween party."
"Pours a nice cloudy straw color with a pillowy, 2 finger white head and some decent lacing. Smells yeasty and of wheat, also present are hints of lemon and some light bananna notes. At times the smell comes across as almost musty. Tastes mildly tart upfront. Next is a combination of wheat and light lemons. Light Bannana notes are present in the finish as are lemons. Good mouthfeel, light bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkability is ok. This is a decent brew but nothing spectacular."
"Harpoon UFO is not objectionable in any way. I drank three bottles and will consume the other three today. However, once you've developed a taste for the real deal from Germany, it is doubtful that you would rate this product in the same league. Too many breweries are trying to cash in on Belgian and German beer styles without developing a competitive product."
"Pours a pale straw hue with a muddied clarity. Dense three finger head shows passing retention but no lacing. Fairly clean nose, just some light wheat and faint tropical fruit esters. Sweet wheat and two-row upfront, followed by a sharp pilsener bite and weak phenolic twang. Ripe fruit ester and mild tartness suddenly become apparent, and create a unique ""pseudo-hefe"" yeast character that sets it apart from other American Pale Wheat ales. Drying aftertaste, with fading wheat and background low alpha-acid hop bitterness. Light body and high carbonation compliment the crisp yeast notes. Finishes dry with mellow ester, slightly vinous fruitiness, and very highly drinkable. It's fascinating to see how Harpoon brewery plays with yeast characteristics vs. classic beer syles and often comes out on top."
"This beer does not hold much water to most german hefeweizens, but as an american attempt at a wheat beer, it seems a little out of place. But I could slam these all night if I wanted to."
"Paired well with spicy Tom Yum soup..."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug. A nice, gold body - very hazy body, like Blue Moon Belgian White - with a thick white head that holds for a little bit and then reduces to a nice lacing. A fruity, malty smell. Taste was interesting - hints of banana with a bit of a tart bitterness to it that isn't overbearing and is balanced with the fruitiness to give it a nice, smoothness to it overall. A decent mouthfeel - a little on the watery side, but overall pretty good. Seems like a pretty drinkable beer - interesting mix makes me feel like I can drink these brew all day long."
"D: Tasty and very easy-to-drink, not too filling and a good representation of the APWA style. I had forgotten how much I liked this beer until I drank it again."
"Poured in a 12 oz. pub glass with a slice of lemon. My usual pour style produced virtually no head. Second straight-to-the-bottom pour produced a nice, lacy head that stayed a bit. Typical cloudy unfiltered appearance, and a very nice, wheaty aroma well-complemented by the citrus. Very, very mild--but tangy--flavor for a Hefeweizen (are they trying to convert more timid beer drinkers to Hefeweizen's distinctive and challenging flavor?). Very drinkable and certainly not bad, but if you're looking for a clovy mouthfull of wheat flavor, look to more aggressive Hefeweizen's than this."
"This is great alternative to a German Hefeweizen. Take it from someone who drank a lot of Hefe in Germany. It was true in color. The flavor was slightly fruity but not over done like a lot of Hefeweizens. The smell was pleasant fruity but slightly metalic. It went down smooth and I was ready for another."
"Drinkability/notes: Pleasant example, a bit understated for the style, still quite drinkable."
"UFO Hefeweizen is a decent version of an American hefe. Although it could stand to be a little more refined, I could see myself buying a sixer now and then, especially in warmer weather. The only problem is, I don't recall hearing about any UFO sightings in Iowa."
"A light, easy-to-drink Hefeweizen. A nice change from the heavier renditions of this style that are so common."
"Leftover summer beer? Seems like it. Pours a very hazy yellow, medium head that hangs for a while. Can't smell much. Tastes a bit tart, little lemony, a bit malty, but not outstanding. Fizzy mouthfeel. Overall, it;s average and not too memorable. Good for a warm weather quencher or for a person who thinks they are drinking a micro."
"Pours a light amber, more golden yellow. Very clear for an unfiltered wheat beer. Good bubbling and a regular head with mild retention. The aroma was a very macro lager like. Adjuncty with some hint of cloves. The taste is a littlle less than expected. A little lagery, some pale malts Refreshing, but didn't taste as clean and spicey as I would have liked."
"Drinkability: this was a bit to dry and light on the malt profile. Initially refreshing, but grows a bit tiring after a while."
"It's certainly not the HW it claims to be on the label. It's a typical American Wheat Ale. Quite average. I give it the benefit of the doubt of being an easy drink on a hot summer day, but that's about it. Surprised that it's a year round offering."
"I this UFO straight from a 12 ounce bottle. It had a nice aroma characteristic of other hefeweizens I have had. The aroma was jsut strong enough without being overpowering. The taste was a bit sweeter than what I was expecting. This was nice because it added a little twist to an original. What I thought was interesting was I had a strawberry soda before and they didn't mix well at all. Don't drink and review."
"I stopped into the Harpoon Visitor Center at the Windsor, Vt site. I had the pleasure of ordering the sampler. Among the five beers was this pale yellow hefeweizen. The head was incredible lasting approx.15mins maintaining at least 1/4"". When the head finally gave way the lace was sparse. This beer was served with a lemon wedge. I'm not sure if I cared for that because of the overwhelming lemon scent. It had a clean crisp character and a slight toasted nut taste. There was plenty of carbonation which lent itself to a light mouthfeel. An excellent example of a light beer meant to refresh and impress."
"Very clean finish, light and refreshing. Good for the style, this would be good during the warm summer nights."
"Drinkable? Id say so. Pretty basic example of the style, but sometimes a wheat just hits the spot. Its cheap and Ill likely buy it again."
"The mouth is light and acidic, yet rounded and smooth on the finish. Could drink thing all day long during the summer. A solid example of the style."
"Low score for a Hefe, low score for a wheat beer, just missed on all bases. Won't get again."
"D- Eh."
"Very disappointing brew from a good brewery."
"Murky but uniform straw-yellow body with pretty much no head almost from the beginning. Smells citrusy with hints of banana. Tastes spicy and citrusy, with some banana. Not too strong tho, the carbonation tends to dominate. Oh well, pleasant and refreshing. I served the father of the brewmaster of this brewery, and I figured I should start trying some of the beers..."
"Easy to pound, if nothing else."
"Drinkability: Highly sessionable, which is pretty normal I think of the clean, American Wheats."
"Pretty quaffable, usually not my favorite style. This was a pleasant suprise. Easy drinking nothing too complex here"
"I guess this is easy enough to drink, but I would suggest trying other Hefe's."
"Served from a bottle in a tall pilsener. Cloudy golden color; good looking beer. Wheaty aroma. Tasty flavor; good example of a style with hints of yeast and banana. Light mouthfeel; this beer is highly drinkable. Great summer beer to enjoy on a hot day."
"D: Easy drinking wheat beer, however nothing really stands out. Good beer to quench your thirst on a hot day."
"Drinkability: A pleasant sunny weather brew, perfect for sharing on a porch with a friend."
"Taste is fresh, clean and a bit sweet. Not a lot of hop action going on here, though. Mouthfeel had a medium body, but perhaps a little overly carbonated. All in all, a good brew for a summer day."
"Could drink several."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a foamy head. Smells grassy and of banana and lemon. Tingles a lot in my mouth...more of a complex taste than I expected from a Wheat. Felt like an alcohol sensation, despite the lower ABV...bananas really came out after it went down. One of the more drinkable wheats I've sampled to date."
"Poured from the bottle to a hazy golden color with decent lacing, and quite a bit of carbonation. Strong aroma of wheat and hops, but none of the expected spices. Mostly hops in the flavor and an okay finish. Had it up near the pool on a 90 degree summer night. All and all, not a bad tasting summer beer."
"Drinkability - An easy drinking beer. The smooth feel allows for (sadly) the tendancy to rush it down. Not a problem if you have more. This has taken a prime place in my ""beer fridge"" for the summer months. Well done."
"Drinkability: The ale is perfect for a hot day, otherwise the flavors just won't cut it."
"Notes: Don't approach this beer thinking it'll be a good American take on a German hefe, because it just isn't, despite the name. Another mild, drinkable American wheat beer."
"Drinkability : It's there I could drink this beer again. Will I turn to it as a choice of hefeweizens... no. I like others more but this is a good beer. This is probably a good beer to bring to a party it's pretty mellow and level on most accounts."
"Pale yellow and cloudy looking pour was typical of the American interpretations of this style, and it did not possess the golden depth that the authentic German versions possess. The head was small for a wheat beer with rather poor lasting power. I tried to smell it, and came away nearly empty. Not much here in terms of banana or clove. Taste was pretty good, with a snappy lemony bite to it followed by a dash of cane sugar. Since I poured in the yeast, the mouthfeel was rounded and soft. This creamy wheat beer was easy to drink, with no offensive qualities to it, but Id pick a real Hefeweizen over this any day of the week."
"M/D- Carbonation not as high as other beers of the style, light bodied...overall all this beer is really nice for a hit day...crisp and refreshing."
"Overall, a good summer beer and probably a good introductory wheat beer for the timid."
"This beer is overall a pretty decent brew, as far as hefe's go I can't say it is anywhere near my favorite."
"-UF"
"A likes hefes so I get to try many. This one is more pleasant than many that i have sampled. The aroma is like a lovely ripe banana, many hefes that I try have a very skunky/chemical aroma. the taste starts off quite carbonated then the malt kicks in, but actually ends up a bit thin in the mouth. A good beer for the warm summer months especially with a bit of lemon."
"On a hot day, or after a long day at work, these prove to be a nice refreshing relaxer."
"Pours into a pint glass a cloudy gold-orange tinge. A nice head with good lacing down the glass, the beer has a pretty mild yeast flavor which makes for smooth, citrus finish. The beer sits well in the mouth as you drink it, but it ends really well and tastes better then. It's very well carbonated, but that doesn't impact its smoothness or drinkability. I'm really happy with this hefe. It drinks easily as my next one will attest."
"I'm not a fan of the style, but this one is pretty good. When I get a Harpoon Sampler 12, I usually save one for myself, while handing off the others to my friends who love wheats. Worth a try. :)"
"Poured into a 20 oz. glass, with a white fluffy head that laces slowly down the glass. A light yellow color with hints of orange, plus it is fairly cloudy. A lite citrus aroma is the first scent, then folowed by bread and yeast aromas. The tang of citrus is the first taste that crosses the palate, then the bread and yeast flavors start to combine with the citrus. That flavor slowly fades away as each taste is swallowed. In the mouth it is lite, but not watery, it has some consistancy to it, plus the carbonation is very strong. This is a very refreshing beer, easy to drink(even with the high amounts of carbonation), and is pretty smooth going down. A good beer for the very hot summer days."
"Being that the first one of these I tried seemed skunked, I was obliged to try another (with no lemon or orange slice by the way). The appearance seemed pretty common of a hefe weizen with an opaque golden-orange glow. The smell had wheat malt aromas as well as the scent of fruit esters. The taste was good with plenty of malt taste, mild bitterness, and some fruity taste. Yet, it was still an average hefe weizen in my mind. The mouthfeel was average with a medium carbonation. Considering the wide scope of beer quality, I would rate this beer as worth trying and certainly worthy of regular drinking. However, it did not stand out as an incredible beer in my opinion."
"I will probably give this another shot to be fair. If the taste was not so bland and a little more complex, this could make a good session beer. Easy to drink. ."
"Cloudy and orangeish in color with a slight white head. Flowery and hoppy in smell with slight notes of citrus and wheat. Refreshing in taste with the citrus ringing through. A highly drinkable beer that tastes good and finishes well. Incredibly balanced."
"While uninspiring overall, I do enjoy drinking this beer, as it is straight-up easy to drink. Perhaps this could be a good transition beer for BMC drinkers, or a good session beer. Just not a great example of the style, yet still very enjoyable. Interesting name and packaging is enticing."
"Certainly a drinkable hefe, but I was disappointed in the lack of head. Also, there wasn't enough of a yeasty element."
"OK."
"Semi hazy golden color with a medium white head. Not much lacing. Smells strong in the citric flavors but not much else. A bit of spice might be in there as well. Taste was dominated by the grains. A stronger wheaty flavor than I would prefer. Finish is biting in its lemon acidity. Body is weak and the carbonation is weak as well. Just really not too enjoyable or refreshing."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: There arent many things bad about this beer, just not a lot of positive things to say either. I look for a little more character of any kind in my beer. This probably could benefit from a slice of lemon."
"Cloudy! But in an attractive way, minus the very lively unrine-like hue. Thin and filmy head. Smells sweet, mild, almost no hop aroma, and of course the unmistakable aroma of wheat. Taste is enjoyable, not ultra flavorful, but accessible and good. Mild mannered. Very focused and two-dimentional, but not in a bad way. Taste light and muted, not overbearingly wheaty, and finishes dry. This is not a hefeweizen if you're hardcore into German versions, but by itself it's a good drinking wheat beer. Very light bodied though, with light carbonation. I could easily recomend this to non-hefe drinkers or people who were beer snobs, as a step up from the SA hefeweizen. Not a soulmate, but I can see myself returning here now and again if I cran out or can't get my hands on SA white ale..."
"I know this is a popular hefe....I think it's just an OK one."
"When it comes to relaxing summer beers this one is on top of my list. Does not have much of a wheat taste but there is some there. This needs a lemon to really bring out the flavors. Still is my favorite made by Harpoon and if you are around Boston you definelty have to pick up a growler, it is wicked good and fresh."
"Da: could get a little monotonous after a while."
"Eh...it's okay. Nothing to shout about but I've had worse Hefe Weizens. It is admittedly refreshing and enjoyable. It just seems like the Americans haven't nailed this style yet. I hope to be proven wrong."
"Overall a drinkable summer session brew. Flavors are generally subdued and a little thin for my taste. Lacks complexity."
"Poured a cloudy, almost opaque bright golden yellow color from a 12oz bottle into a Weizen glass. Thin white head quickly fell to white lacing. Aroma is yeasty and grainy with hints of lemony citrus, slight floral quality present as well. Taste is that of a typical hefeweizen, nothing outstanding, clean and refreshing, notes of citrus and clove dominate this brew. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy, little to no aftertaste. Easy to drink, might purchase again."
"Overall a pretty decent wheat when you are looking for something on the lighter side."
"from the bottle. poured a cloudy yellow with a nice sized white head. aroma lemon, wheat, grainy, hops, some sweetness, and than some sourness pops up as it warms. flavor kind of bland, not a whole lot going on with this one got the same as the aroma but weak."
"I love the label of the UFO, cool graphic design. This poured a cloudy/murky yello-gold with a small head. The aroma is lemony and wheaty. The taste is more of the same. It has a light lemony zing to it, the wheat is there moreso in the aftertaste. It is a little cripser than i usually like for this style, fairly carbonate. The feel is smooth but a little watery/light. This beer has an allright balance and is fairly drinkable but compared to other hefeweizens i have had this not in the top running(especially considering it isn't that much cheaper). That being said though it is a pleasant drink, an overall nice beer."
"This was my first unfiltered experience. I originally had it from a tasting at the liquor store where I work. After that I bought a bottle, took it home, and poured it into a glass. I liked the color, it suits the beer. It smelled heavily of wheat and yeast. The cloudiness that one expects from a Hefeweisen was there. It was quite smooth with a strong STRONG yeast taste to it. When I first had it I told the Harpoon rep who let me taste it- ""this tastes like bread"". A solid beer, and a solid hefe."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow with a frothy white head that holds and laces nicely. The smell is of wheat and yeast. There also a distinct sweetness and freshness associated with the smell without smelling sugary. The taste is rather weak but solid. There is a fresh bread taste associated but is overall not that strong. This is also slightly sweet. The mouthfeel is nicely thick and carbonated, pretty good. It is also good on drinkability. Not too bad for a wheat beer."
"Decent enough wheat brew but doesn't exactly bring anything new the genre."
"Overall a decent american wheat. Sort of has a half Macro half hefe taste, but a great gateway weis."
"Notes: I had a lot of good beer tonight and this one just got lost in the crowd. Not a bad example of the style but nothing I would seek out again."
"This hefe seems to be a bit lacking, it certainly does not have a ""wow"" quality to it, but it meets the basic criteria. It is worth a try for sure and I really recommend trying it on tap. I certainly plan to do a re-review of this beer after I have it on tap again b/c I remember it being much more floral with a hint of clove to it."
"Not the most compelling beer I've had (but I'd like to try a good hefeweizen), but a good brew with some Il Panino pizza or Mexican. A solid local quaff."
"A bit flatter than I expected with a pretty light body. Fairky clean finish with slight astringency. The hoppy aftertaste is mild. With so many other good wheats, I'd pick something else."
"This beer pours with an exceptionally cloudy pale orange colour and a goodly amount of carbonation showing through. I expected more of a head, but it thins out fairly quickly. Strong smell of hops. It tastes rather fizzy and thin. A good touch of bitterness comes out as it warms, but I would say its a bit too little, too late. I suppose its perfectly drinkable and I can imagine it could be refreshing, but I would really expect more character from a wheat beer."
"Drinkability: This style in general is very drinkable, and this beer does not fail. A great beer for a summer afternoon."
"Pretty easy to drink, just nothing I would seek out. I suppose it would make for a good lawnmower beer. Unfortunately it's 20F outside, and the grass isn't growing."
"It's really not a bad beer, and it's on style. I find it slightly weak and a little thin, but it would be a good beer to introduce someone to wheat beer styles."
"This pours a yellow gold with a smallish head.The smell is a pretty fragrant wheat and floral smell.The taste is light crisp,and refreshing.I'm not a big fan of this type of beer,but this isn't too ""wheatish"".This has a nice balanced m/f and is very refreshing.This is a good beer and I will try this again."
"Well, at least I didn't pay $9.99 for a sixer of this at Uncle Guiseppe's like I was tempted. Drinkable but a subpar attempt at a Hefe; Franziskaner and Erdinger aren't exactly shaking in their boots I suspect."
"I would have rated this higher had I not had a really bad beer right before I started drinking these. I was in a small bar that suggested a Fischer (which is not very good) then went on to this. This beer goes down smooth, it has a crisp taste with a somewhat wheaty scent to it. I just read another comment about how good this would be on a hot day. I agree, it was night time and I was in a bar, but I could imagine drinking these right from the cooler on a hot day out on a boat."
"Overall: A subdued hefeweizen; not recommended."
"Overall this is a nicely drinkable beer. It's lower ABV makes having more than one easy."
"The UFO goes down so smooth on a hot summer day you can polish off a six pack before you know it. I am a huge Hefe fan and the Harpoon UFO is deffinetely my favorite."
"Not overly exciting to say the least, but an easy drinker on a summer day. It seems to me that fruity beers (like blueberry, etc..not Lambics or other more profound offerings) and these Ameri-Hefes are like the gateway beer for women on the bubble. Oh a slice of lemon in my beer? Sounds chic. But if people like it, and want it that way, by all meansits just not for me. Not my favorite style, but Ill forever support Harpoons endeavors."
"This is one hefe that makes the case for adding a lemon slice, just like Corona with lime. Not very tasty unadorned. This beer has an unfortunate sourness and dryness which does not really fall well on the banana-clove spectrum for this style. Now I understand why Harpoon Brewing pushes the ""UFO"" brand in place of Harpoon for this one."
"Overall, a very decent hefeweizen. However, I don't see myself picking up a 6-pack again in the near future."
"Quite a nice hefe. The best beer I've had from Harpoon. Going into this beer, I was of the feeling that Harpoon beers are overrated. This beer has saved them for me. Pours a nice hazy yellow color, slightly tinged a burnt orange. Smell is sweet and yeasty. Flavor is well balanced with malt and hops. Could perhaps use a BIT more hop bitterness as this beer has a candi-ish flavor profile. A bit of orange-vanilla flavor, and maybe a bit of bannana. More complex than I would have thought. Not too yeasty or sour, however -- two characteristics I prefer in a hefe."
"Goes down easily, I could drink a few more of these, although it's not interesting enough to be beer that I think about. Not bad, not good, just okay."
"The mild and boring makes this very easy to drink; probably a good choice for sitting around and watching sports, or to bring to a party... that sort of thing."
"Drinkability is ok but only if there's nothing else in the fridge."
"Pours a hazy light golden color with a thich white pillowy head. Good retention, and a little bit of lace on the glass. Not much on aroma, very pale, maybe a bit of earthy, floral hops. Very pale, slightly tart, astringent and husky. No banana flavors that you wouold find in a German. Decent amount of bitterness. Light bodied, high carbonation. Not as drinkable or thirst-quenching as a German. Overall, pretty much average."
"The aroma is kind of weak, but smells buttery and slightly fruity. The taste is grassy, but nicely carbonated. It is a bit citrusy too, but kind of bland in the mouthfeel. This one is mildly refreshing on a hot day, but nothing spectacular."
"Mouthfeel is a bit watery, slightly bubbly, again, light. Quite drinkable- could drink a lot of these. But the flavor is lacking for me- just not enough there. Still, a good summer beer."
"Paid $1.59 for a 12 oz. bottle. Only slightly hazy with a deep yellow color, and a bit of orange. Orange in the nose, along with some other fruit that I can't quite pick out - strawberry?!? malt is nice as are the hops, though not as aromatic as I would like. Wheat present, but not overpowering. Fairly fizzy, almost like a US macro, but it plays well on this beer. maybe slightly watery."
"Pours a slightly cloudy,pale golden color. Very ""clean"" looking for an unfiltered wheat beer. Low aroma-trace of malt and some banana and phenolic esters but its very low. I was expecting more. Almost just says ""beer"". Ok flavor-a slightly sweet malt with a whisper of the spiciness and other flavors youd expect in a wheat. Decent enough body. Actually I find this very drinkable but Im not a huge wheat beer fan. I miss some of the characteristics of the wheat beers. I like them subdued but this is weak. Good for ME but probably not what YOUD expect."
"Taste loses the spice and banana and just comes out all wrong. Sour wheat malt, lemons, some light spice and just an unpleasant bitter finish. Mouth is crisp and light. Not great. Another subpar American wheat."
"Drinkability: easy to drink if I could get past the bad flavor."
"A drinkable and accessible beer for summer. Great to bring to parties where Corona seems to be the beer of choice."
"It's good to drink an American try at a classic German style. It reminds me of why I Like German Wheats better. This one looks brightly a canary yellow. Slightly cloudy with fair head retention and lacing. Smells grapefruity, mildly spicy, with mild sweetness. Tastes mildly malty with grapefruits, lemons, and oranges. Mild corriander and pepper added to vague hops give a bit of complexity. Body fades quickly, leaving the palate feeling scrubbed. Feels grainy and a little astringent. Finishes crisp and a little cloying."
"This beer poured a clear yellow with a white head. I couldn't really tell that it was a non filtered beer. I could see right through it. The aroma was slighlty citrus with some light hop notes. The taste was a little citrusy with some honey. The mouthfeel was average. It was a pretty light bodied beer. Drinkable...I guess."
"That ham flavor makes this beer far less drinkable than it could be. I'm sure this is a great beer in MA, but just didn't survive the trip to MI very well. I look forward to trying this fresh in Boston."
"Drinkability - Definitely a drinker friendly beer."
"fair carbonation makes this one crisp and clean feeling. very staright forward. nothing complex about this one. its refreshing but nothing special."
"Overall Impression: An enjoyable, light, refreshing beer, but hard to call it a hefe. More of an American Wheat. (nice to see the Bros. agree with me)."
"poured a cloudy amber color with off-white head that very slowly fell to a slight ring. Smell is a nice spiciness without being overpowering. Taste follows though with a nice spiciness that leaves a good mouthfeel. An easy drinking beer that would be a good session beer."
"Should have tried this in a five-ounce sample size first -- then I could've saved the eight bucks or so I spent on the six-pack."
"Overall: I was a little dissappointed with the aroma and taste of this one, maybe it had been on the shelf too long and lost some punch. I'll give it another shot."
"Pours from the bottle a slightly cloudy golden color, with a thin white head. Smells of wheat malt and very slight citrus, and not much else; maybe a tiny bit of hops. Mouthfeel is average, as is the carbonation. Tastes of slight citrus, finishes clean. I don't understand why they call this a hefeweizen, when it is obviously an american wheat. It has none of the yeast and estery characteristics which I assocate with a good hefe. Seems a little misleading. I am glad I only bought a single of this one. Smooth and easy drinking, just not what I expected. Not even that special for an american wheat."
"Overall = a decent Hef. Good flavor and drinkability. Nothing spectacular but I'd recommend it if you're a fan of this style."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This Hefe pours into a weizen glass with a relatively small but pristine white head and a cloudy yellow appearance that closely mimicks a german hefe. The aroma is a sweet matly bread smell, not at all reminiscent of a german hefe so right off the bat we know what kind of style this beer is going for; no spices, cloves or corriander here. The taste at first is a fruity yeast taste with hints of citrus and orange peel, followed by a matly/wheaty flavour that is soon overcome by the warming, alcohol ridden finish. This is a crisp brew and a descent attempt at an american hefe but really falls short of other americanized versions such as shiner and brooklyn. A descently flavorful brew, but lacking in complexity and the alcohol really shows too much for a wheat beer."
"Hazy orange color, with a sticky lacing head. Some yeasty aroma, no fruity esters are present. No banana or clove aroma. Kinda bland there. Taste is sweet and grainy. Seems to be heavy on the wheat malt. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing, as it should be. Nice beer. I would compare this to Oberon, both good summer time American Wheat beers."
"Light, tart and refreshing. A very enjoyable wheat beer. The perfect addition to a hot summer day. Not the best Hefe Ive ever had, but a solid brew that I would definitely consider buying again (especially as the weather gets hotter and I get thirstier). Recommended."
"Medium mouthfeel. This is an easy drinker. Would be a nice way to finish an afternoon spent mowing the lawn."
"Overall: Honestly, I really like this beer. It's one of, if not the best American version of this style. It would be most enjoyable on a warm summer afternoon."
"12 ouncer sampled, brown bottle with no freshness indication to be found. Pours the expected hefe tone of yellow/light orange and very cloudy, lifts a white head and leaves better then average lacing. Pleasant, lemony brew, a bit thin in the mid and finish flavor wise. Hops dry things out late. Respectable summer sessioner. Lacks the complexity, aromatics and smooth mouthfeel of the higher rated offerings of the style. Would be fine with a light lunch, salad/fish/chicken etc etc."
"Quite sweet up front. Quickly balance by a slight acidicness, & tart lemony notes. Lightly hopped, and sublte bits of fruit. Light, crisp & refreshing."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/8"" white head above the cloudy golden brew. Head remains constant at original depth, with minimal lacing. Aroma is citrusy sour with slight hints of wheat. Taste is bitter sour, with little to no wheat character. Disappointing here. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both not so great. Has been better on tap when I've had it now and again, or at least not this lacking, but it remains a backup restaurant beverage at best."
"Overall, this is a light and drinkable wheat beer. It doesn't show many of the characteristics of an unfiltered wheat and it flirts with being underhopped. Luckily the wheat tartness comes out to counter the residual sweetness."
"Pours a clear yellowy gold until the addition of the lees which only murks it up a little bit. Wheat malt and some really dull banana and citrus notes. Smells like it's unbalanced towards the malty, sweet side. First sip confirms, it is rather unbalanced and sweet, not really containing the oomph that I consider a hallmark of a quality hefeweizen. Light on the hops, hardly a glimpse in the finish that I confused with a miniscule cloviness. Not altogether bad, just not really that noteworthy."
"Pours out cloudy yellow/orange with a nice white head Smells- Tart fruity bread dough smell Taste- Clean, with a bit of spice, hop bitterness, and tart finish. At the beginning I was not sure, but at the end of the glass I was craving another. Good beer one of my favorite hefeweizen so far."
"First beer I tried out at a New Years Eve/beer tasting. Maybe would have given better reviews if I did not just enjoy a much better Hefe earlier in the week. Nice hazy appearance and solid head rentention. Tastes and mouthfeel just not as apparent as others tried of this style. Wouldn't be a bad choice for those you may want to convert from BMCs."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with no freshness markings on it. The appearance of this beer is certainly no more than average. A dull, cloudy orange color in the glass with almost no head. Just a tin lace ring around the glass. The aroma is rich with pale malts and slight citrus scent. The aroma is really the best part of this entire beer. The flavor is bready with a strong malt influence and some sour yeast flavor. There is a hint of alcohol and an earthy mushroom flavor. The ending is slightly watery. The flavor is convuluted and and more annoying than enjoyable. The beer feels strongly carbonated in the mouth though it doesn't look like it in the glass. Overall this beer is ok, but nothing special. I won't go looking for it ever again."
"There are great Hefeweizens, ones that I absolutely love. This just isnt one of them. It pours a hazy golden color with a very slight head. Very little lacing. Slight lemon and citrus in the aroma, but not much in the way of the wonderful phenols and esters that I appreciate in the style. Just a hint of yeastiness, which is another drawback. Moderate heft, and a more-bitter-than-average finish. Theres nothing particularly distasteful, it just isnt up to par. Middle of the road."
"when i was living in allston during and just after college, the ufo was always my standby beer at the white horse tavern for $3 dinners (which, by the way boston, i come back and the t prices have jumped like fifty percent to $1.25 and the $3 dinner @ the white horse jumps from $3 to $4. what gives? i'll easily attribute the big dig to the former and try to do so for the latter as well, just because. but anyway...) so, the ufo was my standby, especially in the summer months, and it was great to revisit it again recently. that said, it's far from perfect. it pours a cloudy yellow colour with a tiny head that leaves some marking on the glass. pretty standard stuff here for the most part. the smell is citrusy and sweet. with hops and grain dominating the scene. other fruits seem to be thrown in the mix as well. the flavour is citrusy smooth with some yeast flavouring laced in throughout. wheat and hop notes interject here and there, but this is first and foremost a sweet beer, but not disgustingly sweet. my main concern is the carbonation level. i'd bump it up a bit overall. this brew can come across as a tad flat sometimes. overall, this one is tasty and goes great with burgers, wings, grilled chicken, etc. not the most daring beer out there by any means, but more than serviceable."
"A thick pillowy head rises up from the beer poured into my Hofbrauhaus wheat glass, but from there, it's pretty much so-so. Smell is evidently wheat, some citrus/lemon action going on in the nose, but not much, really. I wouldn't say taste is an utter disappointment, but it's sour lemon, much like a lager, and with the light body of wheat. I understand why this appeals to the greater population, but it's pretty much a standard as far as wheat beers go. Will I ever buy this? No. And I didn't this time. Still, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to one of my beginning beer friends. A good brew."
"This is not anything like any hefe I have tried. Pours a hazy yellow with a generous head and thick lacing. Smell was clean, almost non-existent faintly floral, no banana, no cloves just faint yeast and hops. Tasted clean with hints of lemon and yeast, very light almost too light, very much a soft american wheat. Will I buy it again? Next summer....maybe."
"This is a bavarian wheat beer wannabe but this is a very drinkable beer. This could be a nice hot weather beer."
"Compare this to an average commercial Hefeweizen like Erdinger's and this must be praised for its cleanness and character. What is not fair is to compare this to the artisinal, and more expensive products from such genre-pushing styles as Schneider and Weihenstephan. This is to German-style Hefeweizen as Hoegaarden or Wittekerke are to Belgian Wit: natural, characterful, not heavy and quenching."
"This is a hefe? I almost thought I was drinking a macro swill. I've had american ales, flying dog's in heat wheat is great. What were these guys thinking? It poured a cloudy yellow as expected, but very little head. There was no fruity, banana, maybe some wheat, but barely. I was very disappointed. Once again a 6 pack I need to pass on. ufo is a good name for this. It's definetly out there.I don't recommend letting it get warm either, then you have a nice salty, sweat taste....mmmm."
"Pours with a somewhat weak head that quickly sags to about 1/8 of an inch and just... sits there. Beer is a dark metallic straw color, quite transparent until I pour in the rest of the yeast, making it a little foggier... but not by much. Initially feeble, vaguely grassy (from hops??) aroma finally develops into hints of dry yeast and lemon curd with warmth. Even after swirling the hell out of this glass, the strongest aroma I get out of it is maybe a bit of cinnamon. Nosefeel is practically nonexistent. After a full minute of holding a sip in my mouth, suggestions of honeydew (?), white grape juice (?), peach (??) and the faintest bit of clove (?) emerge in the flavor. Sure seems they filtered out the flavor, anyway. Any lasting tastes get washed out due to the flat, watery mouthfeel which, at best, grants it a modicum of drinkability. This might pass as a chugger on a summer day, but I don't care about it enough to find out."
"This is a Hefe? Boring and tasteless with very little of the Hefe character. Slight esters are limited to a touch of bannana, thats it. The yeast doesn't seem to do anything but make it cloudy. A bit of spicy hops and a bit of malt sneak in, but overall its very bland. Its not a bad tasting beer, just a very boring one. I'll save a couple bucks and drink a macro if I want tasteless."
"This brew pours a cloudy pale straw like color with a thin white head that just barely leaves a mark on the glass. Aromas are initially wheaty with a whiff of biscuit and bread like malts which follows with a lemony zesty like aroma. The initial flavors for this brew are zesty and wheaty, with a sharpness from the carbonation and just a bit of sweetness. Following there is an array of yeasty estery flavors and a sudden peppery flavor. This brew finishes wheaty, with just a bit of hop bitterness, and a faint clove flavor. Overall the UFO has a fairly creamy mouthfeel except for the peppery notes that just add a bite to this brew. A decent offering for Harpoon, but nothing outstanding by any means.. A good brew to offer non-BA's to get them into better beer.."
"It's good, I like it better than Widmer, and might even champion it... if it weren't for that smell!"
"A crisp and refreshing wheat that isn't the most flavorful of the style, but is worth a try IMO. Highly drinkable, a good safety beer at a chain restaurant that offers mostly macros."
"I'm not a big heffe/wheat beer guy, but it just seemed like the right thing to order last night. After teaching a self defense course all week this beer (and the one I ordered right after it) really hit the spot and tasted great. Really nice summertime beer."
"A very drinkable hefe. My new favorite in a style I don't usually like."
"Crisp and clean leaving a renewed freshness in my mouth.I'll have this again."
"Pours with a white head of foam settling into a tight island in the center of the glass. Hazy golden liquid, nose of grassy malt, light hefe spicing. The taste is somewhat lager-like with a spicy yeast undertone, some delicate fruitiness and above average hop bitterness for the style. Finishes up slightly sharp and drying out some as you swallow...a nice Summer refresher."
"Very nice tasting American Hefeweizen. Clean, refreshing and very drinkable. Yeasty, but lacking the fruity overtones that I enjoy in most hefes."
"Very disappointed after reading the earlier reviews. Either this is a bad tap, or the beer is much better in bottle form."
"It poures a light gold with a little haze to it. It has a small cover of white which quickly dissipates. It has a faint citrus smell. The taste start out primarily citric, but as the beer warms there are hints of cherry and banana. Throughout the beer has a nice crisp dryness. It has a clear crisp dry feel in the mouth, a good clarifying beer. A decent beer, but not very weise. It could use more sediment and more complex tastes."
"($6.59 / 6-pack)"
"It was OK, but not one I'd go out of my way to buy again. It didn't stand out too much among the ranks of wheat beers."
"Overall, a solid American style hefeweizen."
"Mouth&Drink: Very light mouthfeal, enough carbonation to put off being very quaffable."
"Drinkability: I would have had another if there weren't better things available."
"After reading all the terrible reviews, I was afraid to get this beer. This came in a variety 12 pack with Munich dark, IPA, and their Ale. Appearance looked quite good. Poured out a golden color with a big amount of carbonation to my surprise. Smell wasn't anything too big. Some malts, grain, and yeast, but it was all faint. Taste was alright. Wheat and hops make an appearance with a spicy bit at the end that lasts for a while in the aftertaste. Seems like cloves to me. All and all, it wasn't too bad. I'm sure this is much better on-tap, but just to kick back a few with some guys, this could do just fine."
"D&N: A fair wheat ale, no more. I'd much rather have a Penn Hefe, this beer doesn't have enough body or character to really attract my attention."
"This was the first Hef I've had that I thought I may actually want a second. It was poured a sickly, cloudy orange, with no head to speak of. It was served with a lemon, which was not so bad I guess. Still want to try one without a lemon. I think what I liked about this ber was that it had a nice hop flavor mixed in with the sweet-and-sour wheat flavor. The beer's smell was dominating by the lemon."
"Weak almost nonexistantaroma with only slight hints of banana. The taste was fruity, yet way way way over sweet. I tasted over ripe bananas, pears. It was like the ice wine of the beer world. too sweet. I was told by the brewery rep to put a lemon in it, but I wanted to taste the beer for the beer. I should have taken the lemon."
"Horrible crap. Pyramid even looks good compared to this utter shit."
"A yellowish-orange beer with a slight head that leaves decent lacing. It is definitely not as cloudy as most unfiltered hefe's i've had before. Citrus aroma with a lemon and orange taste that is not overpowering. Lots of carbonation and not bitter. This is one of the better hefe's i've had, but it is not my favorite style of beer."
"Drinkability  This was not a bad drinking beer, but nothing near a true Hefe Weizen."
"Taste same characteristics as smell along with some adjunct flavors similar to those American pale lagers. Average mouthfeel. Starts out pretty good but gets a little too sweet at the bottom, and tastes more like a overly sweet macro."
"For me this is a decent all-around beer that seems to marry well to a variety of foods - steak, chicken, fish, veggies. For a HW, I don't consider it to be in the same league as some others, such as Paulaner, but alas this is the only one many packies offer around here, so I buy it and I drink it. And doggone it, I even enjoy it. However, it seems to me to be a little less ""unfiltered"" than in the past, but perhaps that's just me."
"A good hefeweizen, but certainly not the best."
"Overall- a quick thirst quencher during a hot July day. I would prefer Smutty Nose' Weizenheimer over this though."
"Notes: im not too impressed. This is light and a little crisp, but not amazing. Worth the price."
"This is a very drinkable and light beer. Absolutely perfect for summer, althought I had it in a record-breaking cold day in winter. I can't wait to drink this after I mow my lawn. Although in the winter, I'm just looking forward to more daylight and warmer weather. UFO is hazy, b/c it is unfiltered. I had mine with a lemon, and I would have to say it is better without. For what it is, this is pretty darn good and drinkable. But only come to this beer if you are looking for something which is lighter and refreshing."
"This one poured a very pale and hazy dull yellow color. Very light looking. The head was surprisingly dense and creamy. Lemony malt aroma with some sweet grasses in there. The taste is light, sweet, tangy and somewhat bitter. Finishes with a citrus tang. This is a very light bodied and overall light tasting Hef. Although lacking in depth of flavor and body, it makes up in its drinkability."
"The UFO from Harpoon poured a cloudy dull yellow in color. Lots of sediment in the glass but it's very, very fine, making it impossible to pick out the individual yeast particles. Thick and creamy white lace dies quickly away to just a miniscule layer. Decent lacing of the glass. Aromas are lacking. No bannanas or fruity esters noted. Almost exclusively a ""wheaty"" aroma. Not much else. Flavor is more of the same. The wheat flavor dominates, with just a token bit of zesty spice to liven things up. Finishes dry with a bit hop snap at the end. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good. Smooth on the palate with just the right dryness to quench the thirst. Great summer beer. Lower end of the ABV scale means you have more than a few after a hot summer's day of work."
"The beer pours a clear gold color with a thin white head that quickly fades to lacing. This quite un-hefe like. It boasts of being unfiltered, but the beer is as clear as a golden ale. Also, it has little head retention. Hefe's are supposed to hold a decent head. The aroma is weak. It has a wheat aroma, but I have to really try to find it. It lacks that fruity banana smell and the yeast zing. The taste is under par. Don't get me wrong it's not bad for a pale ale, but thins is supposed to be some kick ass hefe beer. It lacks the fruity taste that accompanies most all hefe's. It has a pale ale feel with a bit of body and wheat malt flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. It drinks average. This was a waste of time and money."
"It was light and crisp and relatively easy drinking but short on the depth of flavors I expect from this style."
"Nice and very hazy pale gold color, good puffy head of 1/2 an inch. lots of thickish lace. Scant esters to the smell, more yeast, a bit of plum. Mouthfeel is medium with minimal carbonation. Taste-wise, a little flat, slightly canvas-like, thin spice, touch of citrus tanginess to the finish. A little added grittiness to the texture on warming. There's nothing bad about the beer -- and Hefes aren't favorites of mine -- but generally I look for more clove and fruity esters in the ones I tend to like. Thanks to Liza P. and her dad for getting it, and Ken K. for bringing it back."
"This is from a 12 bottle sampler box. Pours a cloudy yellow gold with an ample white head that has decent staying power. Nose is a profound citrus, on a wheaty background. Mouthfeel is tart and very carbonated. Taste has citrus notes and is palate cleansing. Head lasts forever and lacing is all over the glass. Tastes like a good American weissbier that would be much better on a hot sunny day in midsummer. More pleasantly fruity as the glass warms and the malt balance kicks in. Light bodied and quite drinkable, this is a nicely crafted product. It does seem slightly watered down, but I detect this quality in many American wheats."
"Pours hazy golden with a medium white head that lasts, leaving decent lacing. Aroma is sour and citric, fairly light. Flavor is mostly sour, with a slight sweetness at times. Body is thin, somewhat watery in the mouth. There is some sort of metallic aftertaste that I get every time I have tried this, not very pleasant."
"I liked it better on draught, better in hot weather than in november, but it's still good all the time."
"Pours a hazy unfiltered-looking yellow color with a thin white head. Thin lacing. Aroma of citrus, banana and wheat. Crisp and rather light with a nice citrusy flavor, and it stays very effervescent on the tongue throughout. The finish is dry and a little fruity. This beer is not overly ""wheaty", and that may be why I enjoyed it more than I usually enjoy beers of this style. I found this easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Fantastic summery brew, too damn bad I waited till november to sample, there's always next year I suppose."
"This is one of the better wheat beers I have had. What was funny, was that I had it on tap at Outback Steakhouse of all places. What else was funny, was that the waiter told me it was some UFO beer from Norway! Hahaha, these people need to get their stuff straight. Next thing you know, Bud will be an import from Andorra. Anyways, it was a real refreashing beer. It was hearty in the wheat area, but wasn;t too overbearing. It was balanced well with slight malts and hops. It went down smooth and quenched my thirst. I'm not sure of the appearance, but I gave it a 3.5, because I saw what it probably could have been. It was served to me in a frozen mug, so I never really got a good head from it and there was ice in it. Damn those that put good beer in frozen mugs, DAMN YOU!!!"
"After seeing a few guys on my campus wearing UFO t-shirts, I put this high on my list of beers to try for no other reason than to see how mediocre it was. I'm trying it now and and it's barely a step up from mediocre. I was going to give it a 4 for taste but realized that for a wheat beer, it has little flavor. All the other characteristics are there, but when I see ""unfiltered wheat beer"" on the label, I want to feel as if I just did a face-plant in the middle of Kansas. No such luck here, Kemosabe."
"Poured out a straw like color very cloudy, medium white head that goes down to a thin lace. Didn't have high expectations for this one, mostly because I don't like this style of brew. But like everything else don't knock it before you try it. I tried it and it was good. There were citrus and banana and slight malt flavors all in this brew. Easy to drink smooth medium bodied brew. There was also a banana aftertaste not a bad thing. This was a good brew."
"This beer is a slightly hazy straw yellow color with a thin white head that quickly dissolves to a broken collar around the surface. The aroma is a pleasant combination of clove, lemon citrus, yeast and wheat. Each sip of this very drinkable thin bodied beer begins with a citrus flavor. The middle is filled with clove, lemon, banana and citrus with a wheat malt flavor in the background holding it all together. It finishes dry with a banana flavor left on the palate."
"I enjoyed the mouthfeel of this offering. At first I thought it might be too thin, but again, as the glass emptied I realized that it was a real smoothness and not wateriness that I was sensing. Though never having a bite, it does have a medium-bodied finish. Easily drinkable, I would likely choose this over many American hefes I've tried."
"Pours a hazy golden color. Slight bannana aroma with a hint of clove. Not a bad aroma, just not enough of it. Taste was bland as well. No off flavors in this beer, just seemed watered-down. Very thin mouthfeel. Definately not the best harpoon has to offer."
"This beer poured an orange/straw color that had a haze to it at the start progressively cloudier as it finished. The head that was produced was a dense creamy foam and it was fairly lasting. No lace noticeable. The aromas were of wheat grains, some fruit (light banana, and citrus), earth tones, sweet malt and some yeast tones. The flavors that came out were of wheat grains, some bitter hops, light fruit, hints of spices, flowers and yeast and it finished on the tart side. Light medium bodied. A little on the weak side for my tastes, nothing really stuck out. Every taste I took I had to kind of concentrate to catch all the flavors. Not a bad beer, but not the greatest one (of its style) that I have had."
"Have had this one many times. Pours a hazy orange, clearer than most unfiltered Hefeweizens. Smells are subtle, some yeast, some citrus, not much else. Taste is watery with some hops, but muted, plunger muted. Subtle spices, lacks the flavors typical of the style. Drinkable and not bad for an American Wheat Beer."
"This beer pours a cloudy yellow color with a small head that leaves very little lacing on the glass. The aroma is a little wheaty with a tiny citrus hint. The flavor is a little malty, but mostly it tastes like a slightly watered down weiss beer. Not bad at all, but it is a little too watery for me."
"12oz. bottle poured into a weizen glass. It pours a slightly hazy gold color with two fingers of head, a little small for a weizen. There is a bit of lace left on the glass. The only things detected in the smell were malt and a hint of citrus. Very very malty nose. The taste is extremely malty as well. Hints of lemon and other fruit are present. The mouthfeel is a little light and oily. The drinkability is fair. Not too bad for an American weizen."
"Poured a nice off yellow with the trademark Hefe-Weizen haze. Almost no head. Smells of a strong citrus presence with the grain in the background. Taste is quite good with a nice solid Hefe/grainy mouthfeel. Tastes like it should. A very drinkable brew from a very good brewery."
"Poured a cloudy golden yellow color and had very little head. Had an average citrus smell that is common to many wheat beers. It's taste was smooth and refreshing. The mouthfeel of this medium-bodied beer was smooth and creamy. Good drinkability too and great for a summer afternoon!"
"At the Brewery: Standard appearance for a Weizen, straw yellow and cloudy with a white foamy head. Has a sweet wheat malt aroma yet lacked the bready yeasty aroma I've grown accustomed to in this style. Body is medium with a slight crispness. Flavor is weak though and not a true weizen flavor. Lacked character and depth."
"Taste: Thin and lacking for the style. Not a bad summertime choice if nothing else is available, but there are many American wheats I'd choose first. Refreshing and banana-y, with a slight citrus backdrop. Finishes smooth and creamy, but still lacking."
"Again: another beer that is in-offensive, meaning it doesn't have a lot of overwhelming flavors of notes. Not one I would try again. pat"
"Poured a slight hazy sraw color,a slight spicy aroma but mainly yeasty.Taste was a litle smokey and spicey with some definant yeasty notes.I think there are alot better American Hefeweizens (Arcadia Whitsun,Penn Hefe, Tabernash etc...) but not to bad,would be much better with a lemon.Not one of the better Harpoon beers but it is drinkable."
"Pours a hazed golden hue with a healthy sized two finger head and leaves a brilliant layer of lacing around my pint glass. This beer is definitely a bastardized example of a wheat lies under the American wheat category in my opinion. Aroma has slight lemony tones with hints of a metallic offness to it, no special fireworks missing some serious yeast characteristics. The taste is a slight buttery sweetness with some contrasting hop bitterness apparent in the flavor profile. Slight mild banana tones with a nice smoot finish one refreshing beer. Mouthfeel is a light to medium bodied and this example of a hefeweizen is a bit under carbonated in my opinion. The drinkability factor is good but nothing extradordinary from this mediocre Americanized classic style of yeast with wheat."
"I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this was. Definitely on the sweeter side of the spectrum with wicked drinkability and was moderately complex keeping my taste buds happy all the way to the bottom of the glass."
"This beer poured a hazy light gold color and formed a huge bubbly white head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, hops, banana and cloves. A flavor of hops, some malt and citrus. A fairly light finish and another good session hefe, but not up there with the top ones."
"Nice and yeasty with wheat flavors on top. A touch fruity. Nice hop balance with nice lemon overtones added by the lemon. Redhook Hefe is my favorite local Hefe, but this is a close second. One of the better american hefeweizens on the market. Great to see this on tap all over Boston."
"UFO is up there with the most refreshing and best summer time brews. It poured a cloudy pale yellow color with a pure white head that had decent retention. Very fine sediment, no visible particles. Aroma is citrusy, lemons mostly along with some banana notes, very crisp. Taste was very smooth, citrusy hops with a pleasantly bitter finish. Again, very refreshing and also very drinkable - putting down a 6pack on this warm spring night should not be a problem. Highly recommended, this unfiltered exterrestrial entity is a must buy."
"Tastes very crisp, lemony, wheat mouthfeel. Not much like a true hefeweizen, but a nice refreshing brew nonetheless. Reminded me a bit of Saranac's wheat pilsner. If this were just a little bit fuller-bodied and sweeter, it would be a very good brew for hot weather."
"Cloudy amber beer pours with a white head and shows good retention. The smell is yeasty with a hint of coriander and citrus. Not bad, but nothing special. The taste is very mild, with malt, bitter hops, and some yeast all noticeable. It is fairly well balanced, but doesn't impress. The mouthfeel is thin and watery and leaves you yearning for just a little more malt body. The drinakbility is again average, as the flavor isn't overly satisfying and neither is the mouthfeel. A decent beer, but there are so many other hefe's that are more enjoyable that I don't expect to buy this one again."
"Purchased a six pack of this beer. Followed the directions for pouring, down to the very swishing of the product. Cloudy and light. My conclusion: bland, with little taste. No wonder Harpoon recommends putting a lemon in it. They should put this out in the summer."
"The beer is a cloudy, golden color with very nice white foam that leaves good lace down the glass. The aroma is modest but with citrus and wheat coming through. The taste is good and smooth (wheat and yeast) but with a nice bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel is dry, medium body. The drinkability is very good for this refreshing hefeweizen style beer."
"Poured a giant soapy white head about 2 inches high.The color was a light gold and definately unfiltered.Looks like smoke swirling inside the glass.A light hazy body with fair amounts of lace.A slight hop and wheat aroma.The taste was of lemon,wheat,and bittering hops.The texture and finish were watery.The mouthfeel was smooth and easy.An average wheat beer nothing special."
"Pours cloudy-yellow in color with a small head. The smell is sweet lemons with a hint of yeast. Very light in terms of body and doesn't impress me that much. This is the kind of beer that I turn to on a very hot summer day when I need some refreshment. I also like to have a couple of these at the Harpoon Summer Fest."
"A pretty good stab at the style from the people @ Harpoon!"
"Harpoon's ""UnFiltered Offering."" Interesting name, rather standard wheat brew. Pour is a cloudy yellow with substantial white head that makes its presence known but for only a few seconds. Aroma is mostly earthy with some fruity characteristics, as well. Taste is somewhat sweet, citric and bitter all at once, in a good way. Mouthfeel is not bad, if a little over-carbonated. Could probably put back a few of these on a hot summer day, but I would probably elect for something else. Not to say it's a bad beer, I think I've just been inundated with wheat beers."
"If they had just called it a light wheat beer it would have gotten higher marks because, in my opinion, that's what this is."
"5KD approved."
"I'm not a big weiz fan, but I love this beer.  The yeast really comes out and none of that fruity flavor of a cheap imported weiz.  I think it's much better than Oberon, but this could be me."
"Very much in the American style of hefeweizen - yeast was a moderate flavoring component, clean without much contribution from the yeast other than a light bready flavor.  Very smooth and drinkable, and nice warm weather choice."
"I am never one for American Hefewiezens, as they usually try to have too much of a tang in order to replicate the Germans.  However, this is one of the better Amercian versions I have tried.  A good amount of yeast is present, yet is not definable.  Crisp and tangy yeasty kick, but not overly.  Faint spice here, but again subtle.   This beer does not try to be more than it is, and that it why it is so enjoyable."
"I was surprised but happy when I tried this beer.  Most of the best Hefe's I have tried have been imported, but Harpoon hit the jackpot on this one.  Very smooth and drinkable with or without food, add a slice of lemon it enhances the flavor of this beer.......CHEERS"
"Not a bad beer. Easily drinkable and if you pay enough attention, you start to notice the esters you expect in a hefe. Still too american to be a good hefe."
"Pours a hazy bright yellow with a thick, creamy white head.  Smell is slightly weak and contains mostly wheat with slight yeast.  Taste is full of wheat but slightly lacking in the yeast department.  The yeast flavor is there but is a little on the weak side.  Nice creamy mouthfeel and very drinkable.  Not a bad offering from Harpoon, it could use a slightly fuller yeast flavor but beyond that it is a great offering.  At $2.75 for a 20 oz. draft and being as drinkable as it is, you will find me drinking it all night."
"Nice deep yellow color with white foamy head. Good haziness like a good wheat should have.  Wheat malt is apparent in the flavor.  Crisp finish with a light to medium body.  This is a brew one can stick to for an evening."
"Decent thirstquencher with balanced wheat flavor. All in all I think this is way too understated. Nothing is jumping out and grabbing me. Laughable that they call this a hefe. There is tartness and tasty citrus qualities - but there isn't any flavor. I would venture to say a larger dose of yeast could do the trick. However, it is not entirely unpleasant, each sip leads to another, and it's a real winner in the thirstquenching department. Good pick for a hot day, and could actually be an ok choice for someone who hasn't had any experience with hefes and doesn't want anything overwhelming on their first try."
"I wasn't crazy about this beer.  I couldn't detect too many of the classic hefeweizen flavors or aromas.  I guess it compares favorably to American competitors, but stick with the Germans if you want the real thing."
"Hazy, pale straw color with a firm white head over a spritzy carbonation. Tart almost lemony taste with some yeast complexity. Nicely balanced refreshing brew better suited to a summer day than a cold winter's nite."
"Another light wheat beer that doesn't match up with authentic Hefe Weizens."
"Not my favorite from Harpoon..but it was worth trying."
"Notes: This is by-far one of the better America wheat beers around. One could say it is comparable to Widmer or Pyramid if not better. Flavourful yet on the clean side and very well balanced. This sample was decanted gently to leave most of the sediment behind, though if you want more of yeasty nutty character swirl the yeast in."
