"A kind of plain wheat beer, the attempts to Wit(icize) it, while not overly successful, working well for me now, as the week has been rather summery in Denver, and this hits the spot as my last brew here for another year."

"I'm not a wheat beer fan, but this one is probably the most popular one from a craft brewery here in Colorado.  I tried one just to see what all the fuss was about, and it's fine, but nothing spectacular.  Good when it's hot outside, like most wheats."
""
""
"Overall (3.11) : A big disappointment. I was surprised at how overwhemingly mediocre this beer is. It's a wheat beer, sure. But that's all it is. Definition of meh. Snapshot is better!"

"Pours a straw-yellow with just a small white head that leaves good lacing when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. Light smell of lemon or citrus with some wheat with a hint of spice. The taste is the same and is very smooth and pleasant to drink. Goes down easy with no bitter aftertaste. Perfect carbonation as well. This is a great brew for the spring and summer months. Very pleased with this one!"

"This is a nice brew. It is fairly light, but packs some great flavor. It is really nothing too special."

"Bombers being unloaded at the market for a song, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a nice fresh wheaty and spice aroma that is almost floral. Pours int a SAPP with a three finger head and a cloudy straw color. On the taste there is a nice feint bitterness right on the start that then gives way to more floral spicy fruit flavor with a touch of malty sweetness. The spices and fruit then fade away and are replaced by a broad flat bitterness that is balanced with the malt then it too fades quickly leaving a clean finish. Very refreshing and very light and crisp for a wheat beer."

""

""

"The beer is a crystal clear golden. Only a small white fizzy head. The beer smells fresh, and mainly of light lemony notes with cracker and a hint of coriander. Mello sweetness with a dry and grassy finish. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly. Medium-high carbonation. A very good beer and a nice take on the style."

"O: good for a hot day but not overwhelming flavors"
"This beer is solid, and I wasn't expecting that."
""
"Pours a hazy light yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, and subdued spice and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with slight citrus and spice flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the aromas and flavors are pretty subdued all around."
""
"Certainly an easy drinking, casual beer, but it does have some pleasant, subtle, complexities if the time is taken to appreciate them."

"A lighter-side-of-medium body with an effervescence that bursts forth at the start, stays noticeable, and fades unwillingly. Fairly astringent throughout. I must say I'm not a big fan of filtered Wheatstone, I miss the yeastiness and the appearance. A decent beer overall but not worth searching for."
""
"This is Blue Moon. I'm drinking Blue Moon right now. I pulled one of my roommate's Blue Moons out of the fridge just to compare. Sunshine Wheat tastes identical to Blue Moon. Interestingly enough, Blue Moon has a 78 rating, and this beer has a 79. Maybe BAs are less biased against the big brewers than they think. So yeah. Back to the beer. If you've had Blue Moon, you've had this. Big orange and coriander over a light body with noticeable adjuncts. The main difference is that Blue Moon pours whiter."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice, tight head, and lots of lacing. Nose is light and bready with a little lemon citrus. Flavor of white bread with lemon citrus and some pepper. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"Overall: good beer, refreshing, easy to drink."

"D- Enjoyable, when I first started enjoying beer I recall this being one of my favorites. It is decent, but not something to seek out."

"Tastes clean if unexceptional. The lemon tapers to a touch of banana and clove. It's a wheat beer, what do you expect? Not the most exciting expression of the style but I’ve certainly had much worse."
""
""
"O: This is my kind of light beer! The spiciness has a great flavor and it is tangy and refreshing. The beer is smooth and mellow and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. The beer pours clear light golden with a thick, white head that retains well. There are numerous tiny bubbles visible in the beer. There are aromas of orange and coriander. I also get some light malt in the nose. The flavors are mostly of the malt with support from orange and coriander. The body is medium with a nice, soft mouthfeel. There's enough carbonation to make this beer refreshing. This is an average, yet refreshing beer."

"Final Thoughts: New Belgium Sunshine Wheat was one of the first beers I ever had that I truly enjoyed drinking. Now, a few years later and having tried hundreds of different beers, it comes off as rather bland and unremarkable. I'd recommend it for those just getting into craft beer. Would I drink it again? No."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best before Dec 23, 2012. This pours a clear light yellow color with a mid sized white head which leaves a light lacing. The smell is light and of lemon, spice, wheat. The feel is medium light mid carbonination. The taste is okay, a little light, mild bitterness, lemon, lemon peels, spices."

"Pours out to a creamy but thin white head and hazy pale yellow color. Aroma is strong coriander and citrus with some grainy wheat blended in. Flavor corresponds to aroma with orange, pepper, lemon and dry wheat and biscuity ""New Belgium"" malt flavors. No discernible hop character. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall this is a delicious beer that I hope to have more of this summer."

"Overall: New Belgium got rid of Mothership Wit and kept this shit? Seriously?"

"Overall: I enjoyed drinking this beer. It is perfect for drinking all day, and if it was a little lower in alcohol content, would make a perfect session beer if based on the tasting experience alone."

"O- A pleasant beer. The subdued nature of the spice is just right. I like the added complexity without getting the impression of chewing on a mouthful of coriander. A nice wheat beer. I'd drink another bottle for sure."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: A nice combination that I wish were a bit more forceful."
""
""
"Overall: An easy drinking beer served best cold on a warm day."
""
""

"not real impressed with this one. super light cloudy whiteish yellow pale color with a short white head that doesnt last long. smells lemony and yeasty and the flavor matches. extraordinarily light on the tongue in the mouth, similar in feel to their mothership wit. lots of carbonation. low abv makes it sessionable, but its got a funky rindy sort of aftertaste that makes it funny in the stomach after a few. not new belgium's best product, but i suppose it satisfies those looking for a shocktop style beer from a craft operation"
"Moutfeel is extremely thin and carbonated. A bit too watery."
""
""
"Overall, it's easy drinking with enough complexity to make it memorable, but not world-class."
""
""
""
"Nothing really special, slightly decent brew."
""
"Light pale straw in color, semi hazy, light fluffy two finger head that sticks around for a while but only leaves behind minimal lacing. Smells mostly of fresh orange/lemon peel and coriander, maybe a slight hint of nutmeg once allowed to warm up for a while. Flavor is also dominantly made up of lemon peel and wheat malts with a coriander finish, texture is crisp, clean, and buoyantly carbonated. Memorable for being one of the most ""lemony fresh"" pale wheat ales I've ever had, and for a great mouthfeel."
"O: This is just an okay beer. I could see me drinking it on a hot summer day, but other than that it is not anything special."

"Overall, it has some nice flavors and aromas but its not my favorite and I may or may not come back to this one. The pepperiness is something Im not familiar with...but thats just me. Give this one a try though as its definitely worth trying."
"O-This is a decent wheat beer. Very reasonably priced and I would drink this over a Boulevard Wheat any day."

"Overall: A very drinkable beer, and it has some flavor to make it appealing. However, with so many other more complex beers out there, it does come off as quite one-sided. All in all, the good points cancel out the bad points and you get a decent wheat ale."

"O- overall this beer is bland."
"O- Easy drinking, good lawnmower beer. It's very light but it is refreshing and somewhat complex."
"Overall: Too much of a macro light for me. Drinkable none the less and not as watery as a macro lager."
"Beer is light in body and sweet on the front with a mild grainy finish. Overall it is an interesting beer but not a favorite of mine. I like it but I don't know how much of it I would buy. Midpalate is a little flowery, fruity, mild yeast, overall just a decent beer, nothing special."
"Overall: I agree with the consensus that this is largely forgettable. There is nothing to really complain about, but there is just not a lot of flavor to maintain my interest."
"This is a pleasant sipping beer but I do wish the flavor was stronger."
"Sunshine Wheat would be good to enjoy in 100-degree heat, but that’s about the only time I’d reach for one. Very refreshing and very average."
"Good beer."
"New Belgium Sunshine Wheat. If you have read some of my reviews, you know I dedicate the summer to celebration of wheat beers. The New Belgium Sunshine Wheat is a filtered wheat beer. Light in color and fragrance, it has a very clean taste without the yeast common to unfiltered wheat beers. Given the added spices, it has a flavor that puts is somewhere between my standard Odell Easy Street and the true Belgian whitbeer, such as a Hoegaarden. Nice for a change of pace, but I in general prefer unfiltered brews during the all to short wheat beer season."
"Overall/drinkability: Easy to drink - not my favorite beer for the summer but a welcomed change of pace"
"Overall-New Belgium seems to be hit or miss with me, I love them or hate them. This one is closer to the Hate List."
"When the summer heat calls for setting aside the sipping beers and picking up a drinking beer, this one will prove worthy."
"Pours a perfect length two finger head that makes it right to the top of my wheat glass. The head is completely white with about half small bubbles and half big bubbles. Kinda creamy looking, but it's not hanging around very long. Pretty good lacing though. The body is see through in some areas and cloudy in other, but overall it's a lot lighter in color than it should be, and it's not as cloudy as it should be. The body is yellow, pretty much looks like a lager other than some of the cloudiness, way too much carbonation here as well. The only reason this beer is getting a 3.5 is because of the good lacing, and that's really a generous rating, it looks like a lager. The smell on this beer is good though, it sort of smell like a Hoegaarden, the spices are the most prominent thing, not too much fruit, but that's sometimes a good thing. I am picking up some small scents of fruit and a tiny bit of light malt, but for the most part it's all spice. The smell isn't very potent, and there isn't really much too it, but it's for sure better than the appearance. This beer really isn't impressing me at all, in any areas. The taste is no different, I get a little spice, and maybe some lemon or possibly orange on the taste, but that's about it. Some maltyness is present and a touch of wheat, but it's way too small for this to be considered a quality beer. Frankly it's just a little watery. Maybe this beer deserves better than a 3 on taste, but I think it's closer to a 3 than it is to a 3.5, what it comes down to is that the appearance was close to a 3 but the lacing bailed it out, and the smell was slightly better than the look, so that bailed it out, I can't keep cutting this beer more breaks, this maybe could get a 3.5, but it really doesn't deserve it, nothing about this is above average. Mouthfeel is the same story, it's close to being a 3.5, but not quite there, there is only a tiny tiny bit of wheat, and thats not going to fly in a wheat beer, especially for the mouthfeel. Other than the wheat it's just way too light, without any wheat it's obviously going to be light - and it is. I know wheat beers are a lighter style, but there really isn't much to this at all. Carbonation is better than I thought it would be, but overall, not a great mouthfeel. Drinkability is good, but only because it's so damn light, it's doesn't taste amazing or anything. Overall the best way to describe this beer is being one tiny step above a Blue Moon seasonal. The Blue Moon spring ale, and summer ale were pretty crappy, and this is just a little bit better than those two. The Blue Moon standard, the belgian white, was better than this beer. So overall, I can drink it, I won't mind drinking it, it's a spiced beer, so even though it's bad it's not terrible. But it's just not doing it for me in really any areas. Average beer."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the wheat with some coriander and some orange peel notes. Smells like a witbier that is heavy on the coriander. The flavor is more of the same. Coriander is the predominant flavor although there is a little bit of orange and other fruit as well. There is some light pepper notes in the flavor also. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O - I'd drink this if someone handed it to me, but I won't go out of my way to get one."
"Overall Drinkability - Balanced at best, boring at worst."
"NOT A MUST HAVE, BUT NOT BAD!"
"Overall- When it comes down to it, New Belgian makes a beer to accommodate each and every style but this one just didn't do it for me. I will say it has a great drinkability but I stopped with this one and switched over to the Zubrowka Bison Grass Vodka."
"O- American Wheat Beers are not my favorite style, by a stretch... but this one was alright. I would drink again for the right price on a hot day. Very refreshing and the light body made it easy to go down and ask for another. If it came down to it though, I would take a Magic Hat #9 over another one of these, any day... Good per style, not my favorite style- hard to judge"
"You can't really bash on this beer for anything, it is a sessionable wheat, great for summer. The canning helps carbonation some and is quite active on the palate. That baby powder taste I sensed is a bit odd but doesn't exactly hurt this beer any."
"D - The drink is nice. Overall, NB makes great beers. I'm always excited when their seasonals come out. When I took the time to pick the beer apart it seems like it falls flat, but really it's a great spring session beer. Hopefully the spice on this wheat won't disappoint you."
"The flavor was much more of the same, with a very bright, and appropriate for summer taste. There was a decent hint of orange rind and lemon in the back, with a nice rounded wheat flavor, nothing shocking or extraordinary here though.The feel was very light and highly carbonated. Crisp, and clean with little in the way of aftertaste. Nice beverage for a hot day, This ties in here as well, as it was just very light, with low abv and just that slightest bit of citrus to make it pop. It could have easily been something that you have multiples of for sure."
"Delicious and quite drinkable!"
"D - One and done. If u don't believe me, put one in a pick 6 and try it."
"Not a bad drinker, but nothing very tasty."
"D - Very very drinkable. This would be a good beer for a hot South Texas summer day."
"Overall: B-"
"Overall- Nice brew, and a nice, drinkable, change of pace from the heavy, over the top, rich brews that often dominate the colder winter months. Though this is an odd cross between a Wit and an American Wheat. Would be very curious to see how this brew tastes unfiltered...might take the edge off the slightly astringent finish? Either way, I am happy I tried it!"
"D: Only drinkable if I forget about enjoying myself and go directly to quenching a thirst. No thank you."
"D: This is a beer I would recommend to a Blue Moon fan for transition to Micros. Especially during a hot August afternoon."
"Per the bottle, an American Wheat with Belgian witbier leanings. I might have enjoyed the beer had it leaned more in that direction. The noted orange peel and coriander were there, but just barely. The overall impression was a fairly insipid American Pale Wheat with just a little spice, not enought to enliven it and it was almost more of a distraction."
"There seems to be no real dearth of ""Summer style"" beers in Winter. Hmm... This one pours a clear pale straw topped by a bit more than a finger of white froth. The nose comprises lemon zest, cardamom, a lot of cracked black pepper, and white bread. The taste does not deviate from this prescribed path, though a slight mild sour crick wanders through along the base of the mountain. (Imagery, yeah!) The body is pretty light, with a very light carbonation and a smooth, nearly watery feel. Overall, a nice bit o' APWA, though I could see some not appreciating the pepper as I do."
"D- An easy to drink wheat beer."
"D- decent enough for a summer time lawn mower beer, but nothing i would really want alot of or that often. not one of new belgiums best efforts"
"Yikes. Did I drink this past its prime? I guess I have to try it again when it is more in season, because as is, yuck."
"Pours a light yellow color. White head and not much lacing. The nose is really quite plain. There are a few light notes of orange and lemon; maybe a tad bit of spice. The taste is slight malt with a bit of sugar. Light orange character. Feel is light and somewhat refreshing. Another very plain offering out of them; quite disappointing."
"Dr- Very refreshing. Could have a lot of these on a hot day."
"It's actually very good, I'm impressed with it. This would probably go very well for a person who likes the flavors of a wit without all the sweetness."
"Drinkability = This is a good summer time beer. Not a ton of flavor, but definitely refreshing. It goes down smooth and leaves a pleasant, sweet aftertaste."
"Final Notes: I like a lot of the New Belgium beers but this one just isn't doing it for me. A little more flavor than a macro, but it's rather bland and unbalanced."
"Overall it's still crisp and refreshing, but I can't deal with the Toucan Sam after taste."
"overall i like the taste, but downgraded on the smell and only so-so on the appearance."
"Good start. . . when you're ready to move up, there's better, but this is good!"
"D: Very drinkable as all the flavors are there and it's not a huge abv beer."
"Highly drinkable and not at all overbearing. Would be excellent for a day of fishin' on the lake. I see from other reviews that cans are available; that would be excellent for this brew, since many lakes have a ""no glass containers"" rule."
"Quite drinkable and delicious on a warm day. Cheers!"
"D-I am not impressed with this offering from NB. It's looking more like a drain pour the more I drink this. It was a gift, though, and I do not want to offend (gag!)."
"I think it fits the bill just right if you want a pale wheat ale."
"Poured into pint glass from a 12 oz can. I am personally very excited to see so many Colorado brewers putting beers like this into cans; perfect for the park. This one was a pale golden color, with a nice fluffy white head. Aromas of light wheat, lemon and citrus. Lots of lemony flavors here, along with wheat and a hint of hops. I will be buying more of this one to drink during the upcoming hot summer days."
"really not bad at all recommended to buy this by the six pack or more."
"Slainte."
"D- Out of a can does seem somewhat different, although I can't figure out why. I would prefer this beer in this medium."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is watery, it's as drinkable as a weak lager."
"D- Very drinkable.. Smooth with a bit sharpness but definitely light enough to drink down quick. Pretty lacking overall"
"The body was not watery as I expected after looking at it, in fact, it had quite a nice coating feel. Carbonation was maybe a little stiffer than I would have liked, but all in all it was very well done. This is no heavyweight, but it'd be incredibly easy to pound several of them on a sunny day outside."
"D- Very drinkable. Smooth, light, and not actively bad by any means. I don't dislike this beer, so much as I am just disappointed. It lacks the punch that I expected from a NB beer. Good enough, but just doesn't have anything exciting about it."
"Good drinkability, a fine offering from New Belgium."
"D: this beer is palatable and tastes decent, but lacks character"
"The taste was quite a surprise! What seemed to be a neglected beer from NB, and looked quite average at first really shocked my tastebuds. By far the fruitiest wheat beer I've had to date. Strong blueberry notes hit the tastebuds immediately, with banana and orange notes trailing. Hardly any bitterness, with a real creamy smooth texture. One of the more sessionalable wheat beers out there."
"The beer was exceedingly crisp and smooth on the palate with a good balance of flavours. The spice was light on the tongue, and there was a touch of bitterness, but it finished cleanly. A rather nice wheat ale, that is entirely sessionable."
"12 ounce bottle, best by March 26, 2010. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a clear light gold color with about a half inch white head. Head retention is average, lacing is good. Aroma is bready malt, wheat, coriander and orange peel. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes mostly like wheat with a bit of coriander and orange peel, but there's also a little bit of tartness in there, too. Mouthfeel/body is light, thin but not watery. It's refreshing and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy and enjoyable to drink. Overall I think this is a good brew. I'd buy it again, and it would be a pretty good summer beer."
"M/D: Creamy, quaffable, thirst quencing. This beer didn't fall apart as I feared due to age. The best American Pale Wheat Ale I've tasted so far."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" bright white head above the clear light golden brew. Pillowy head falls bubble burst by bubble burst, with ample slow-falling lace. Aroma is sweet pale malts. Taste is also pale sweetness, with a peek of tart in the middle, and a balancing crisp hops close. Mouthfeel is way smooth, and drinkability is superb. Great beer for summer, or whenever."
"D - I usually prefer a lighter bodied wheat beer. The aroma is nice enough, but the flavor doesn't really deliver all that it promises. However, still decent enough."
"D:"
"Overall, a solid session beer that goes down easy while delivering some good flavors. This one will always had a special place for me since it was one of the gateway beers that really turned me onto craft beers. At the time, it blew away the BMC's that I was drinking and became my regular sixer in my fridge. After I discovered BA, I moved on to other beers and flavors. I've moved past this one but still get the occasional sixer and enjoy the old days. Rotation: avail here. Occasional memory lane sixer plus on-tap when in Colorado for trips."
"D: you probably could drink these all night long...light ABV% and light flavor, but why? I pass on this brew and deem it my worst New Belgium experience yet. I have not had this bad of an experience since I watched that Ronald Reagan film"
"Notes - A better than average American Pale Wheat. If they bumped up the wheat/barley ratio it might qualify as a Kristalweizen. Even as it stands, though, it fulfills its function admirably."
"A little better than your run of the mill wheat beer. Has a nice subtle citrus scent and taste to accent the wheat. Also some spice to add character. The bottle says corriander and I'll take their word for it. Pretty thin feeling. This would make a nice session beer for warmer temperatures."
"this is an averaga wheat beer with low flavor, would be good on a hot day after mowing the lawn Drinkability is such I would not try again, glad I tired it but but their are more falvorful wheat beers"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a good bite of carbonation."
"Considering it's lower ABV, it something you can knock back all day. It also won't do a number on your taste buds, if you feel like going on to something bigger & bolder. (For me) the best thing about this beer is, I was born & raised in The Fort, so it reminds me home."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Light bodied and kind of thin. Would be a good beer on a hot summer day but thats about it. I wont be looking for this one again."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but I wouldn't seek it out again. It's a pretty run of the mill light wheat beer."
"Overall, this is an OK beer. Very drinkable on a hot summer day. I like the spice flavor that this beer has to offer."
"Washed out yellow pee color, almost clear, with a big white head resting on top and displaying good retention. Very spiced aroma, mostly coriandor dominates with some orange peel. In the taste, there are some bits of orange, but it is spice oriented. Very little maltiness in the body. Light bodied. It's an okay wheat beer, but a little more maltiness would add another layer of goodness to this beer. Still, it's solid drinking on a warm day."
"Overall a very drinkable summer beer but not something I would go to regularly. I think this one would just get the nod over SD."
"First I should comment that summertime wheats aren't my personal favorites but the weather called for something in this style that I had never tried. It did not specifically dissappoint and it ment the general need of the drinkability expectation of this beer. It did however possess a bit more body than I had expected. The typical wit beer spices were present but not overpowering. Poured into the glass with a good amount of head nice lacing as it was drank."
"D: I had no problems drinking this on a hot summer day, but I would want a beer with more flavour in the future. Pretty much middle of the road for its style."
"It's a bit thin and watery. It's a decent lawnmower beer, or a hot day by the lake beer, but has a wierd metallic aftertaste. It makes me want to drink from the bottle too, i feel undewhelmed drinking it from a pint glass."
"D: Easy drinker, one of the easiest from New Belgium. This beer was somewhat of an obsession of mine when I first got into craft beer, and revisiting it has made me realize its not as good as I used to think it was, but it still is a tasty beer. Excellent gateway/transition beer. Glad to have revisited an old friend."
"Drinkability suffers greatly from the high carbonation and any real lack of flavor that exists, so much so that I could not finish it."
"D- This is an exceptional lawnmower beer. There's not much going on here, but it would really hit the spot on a hot summer's day. This would be a good one to drink straight out of the bottle at a BBQ since it lacks flavor and aroma."
"*my overall score may not reflect this, but Sunshine is my favorite American filtered wheat beer. I can't quite pinpoint what exactly it is that makes this beer stand out, it definately has a very distinct flavor. I beleive it is spiced similarly to other wheats so perhaps it is the particular strand of wheat malts or hops they use. Give it a try, it's definately a slightly different take on the filtered wheat."
"Overall, great stuff. Drink this one on a hot summer day. Perfect for a Barbecue."
"Beer poured straw yellow with a pretty good white head. Nose is wheat malt all the way. Taste is wheat malt, lemongrass, and a hint of coriander. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and lively on the palate. Drinkability is pretty good. This is an easy drinking beer that is perfect for a nice 100 degree day here is Phoenix!"
"D: Definite sessionability. A nice summer beer...good when grilling or enjoying the outdoors."
"This guy is very refreshing and a great choice for a summertime session."
"I am more of a fan of cloudier beers, ones with more flavor than this. Overall, I was disappointed by New Belgiums showing on this beer."
"D: Oh yes.. nothing like putting back a bunch of these on a summer day by a pool. Crisp, refreshing and easily approachable by novice and expert alike."
""
"I'm not a big fan of NB. I hate Fat Tire, for instance. This beer is much better, but I suspect I just like their take on this style better than the amber ale."
"Didn't get to see the beer too well as I drank it from the bottle. Spicy, fresh aroma. Enticing. Very fresh, same spicy flowery taste, coriander Some malts. Fizzy mouthfeel. Very tasty. Very similar taste to a belgian ale, good job New Belgium!"
"Overall this was just an okay brew for me, I guess after trying several Im just not real fond of the American Wheat Beer."
"M/D: The feel is light and airy which makes it very drinkable on hot summer afternoons. I am excited for the summertime to enjoy this brew more."
"This beer pours a clear pale straw color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of coriander, tangy wheat, and oranges, but it is all very faint. The taste is like the aroma, but stronger, and with the addition of the same generic caramel maltiness that can be found in most New Belgium beers. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer at best. I could drink it again, if someone else bought it for me."
"cheers"
"D - this was a pretty good beer. I was pleasantly surprised by it."
"Have not had this beer in some years, but it's still as good I remembered. For what it is and tries to be, this beer is impressive."
"Overall this is definitely one of the better wheat beer's I have ever had. I highly recommend it to anyone who like wheat beers."
"Overall, its a solid wheat beer, although I have had better. Easily sessionable."
"Had this at the ""Classic Brew"" in C.C. Tx. I really like it. If I wasn't such a hop lover, I'de go and get me a sixer."
"Clear, bright yellow pour with a light white head. Wheaty, grassy aroma with crystal malt and some metal. The taste is very light, lemony with the slight flavor of grass and wheat. Light mouthfeel compliments the taste very well. Good beer for a hot day."
"A long-time favorite of many Colorado folks, I tried this one on-tap in Durango. My glass was delivered to me a bright yellow color with almost no head (perhaps the pour?) and very little lacing consequently. The aroma was crisp, lemony hops and dry grains with lots of wheat presence. The flavors were at first lemony and wheat-like but it quickly paled. I just never got much more. The body was watery, medium/light and the carbonation average. Not unpleasant, just forgettable. As with many popular beers, I think people like it because it's easy to drink, thus easy to get F-ed up on. But really, I consider it one of the weakest beers this brewery produces."
"nothing crazy but very drinkable"
"There isn't very much wheat at all in this ""so-called wheat"". I'd certify this as a lackluster brew from New Belgium."
"D: Very refreshing, not filling at all. Flavors are fairly balanced. Plenty of carbonation."
"Mouth feel was somewhat over carbonated. This beer has an overall great drink ability , nice sweet, light flavors. This beer is one of my personal favorites."
"This is a pale yellow brown beer with a fizzy white head. Has a very bland smell to it, that is nothing like it tastes. A very fruity, high in esters that remind me of a breakfast fruit bar with no real bitterness to speak of. It is crisp, clean, and something you could drink for it's refreshing character."
"D- Spices are too overpowering for me to drink more than one of these in a night"
"4/3/3.5/3.5/4"
"This one was a little disappointing as far as New Belgium brews go. While it's not bad, there are at least a handful of other wheat beers that I'd rather have than this one - there's nothing about this beer that really sets it apart from others in the same family. Perhaps it's better on tap, but I'll stick to some of the other New Belgium brews in the future."
"nice wheat flavor, this one was real clear, i wish that this one was unfiltered and a tuch sweeter. this is refreshing. it has a bit of a citrus twist, a beer purfict for summer. this one is avrage for a wheat, but i could drink it agan if it ever crossed my path."
"Drinkable but not a favorite"
"Pours a hazy, golden hue with an average, puffy white head that falls to a simple disk of foam floating atop the beer. Smell is very nice, lemon zest, apricot, orange juice, grass, green apple, some white grape and some tropical hints of pineapple. Taste begins nice and smooth, sweet oranges and a touch of sour apple then a transition into whole wheaty goodness. Finishes like you just ate whole wheat. Exhale and you taste what it tastes like to chew on a straw of wheat. The mouthfeel is vibrant and carbonated. This isn't a complex beer. There is not much thinking. With that said, its a solid beer more than worthy of a summer afternoon on the back porch."
"Drinkability was very good."
"Had on tap at the Dundee Dell in Omaha, NE. Has a nice straw appearance, hazy and dense. The aroma is full of fruit, especially orange and lemon, with little of the expected banana-- this was a nice surprise-- and it tasted quite citrusy but not as overpoweringly so as other wheat beers I tried during the same session. Had a decent hoppy bitterness and fizz that added a nice touch at the end, with a rather thick texture that made the beer last a while. Definitely worth a try."
"D: Good session beer. Not particularly exciting, but a good summer quencher."
"It's pretty light but I enjoyed it. It's definitely good to go as a summer afternoon sessioner."
"A good average wheat beer from the people at New Belgium. A clear orange color with a tan head. The nose is of wheat malt sand soem swet fruits. The flavor structure consists of mostly wheat as well. A crisp refreshing body add to the drinkability. Goes well with an orange."
"Very easy to drink, not the best wheat but worth having another."
"Very pale yellow with lots of carbonation going on. A big, large bubbled white head and fair lace. The aroma is a decent, typical wheat and light citrus. The flavor is bready, light and effervescent. Not bad but nothing memorable. Easy drinking but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way for this one. Not one of my favorite styles to begin with but this doesn't seem to be a very bold attempt at it anyway."
"This is quite a quenching drink. A must for the summer."
"D - This is a really easy drinking wheat beer. A nice session brew."
"A very interesting American wheat I thought. Pours a very pale, light beer like yellow, in a weizen glass with a nice head however. Smell is unique, and like a lemony cereal-ish smell. Some sweetness, but not sickly sweet however, and I didn't get any notes of coriander or orange peel. Somehow this feels very viscous in the mouth. Amazingly full body and mouthfeel for an american wheat, yet is crisp and refreshing at the same time. Nice light wheaty finish. Although the taste is a bit on the light and muted side, this is still very nice refreshing bright wheat beer that I can see enjoying again for sure."
"D & Notes: Overall, I am actually fairly impressed with this brew, as I am normally not a ""pale wheat"" beer lover. This isn't something I would seek out regularly, but rating it for style, I would say it is very solid. It's well balanced, nothing is overdone, plenty of flavor, and it's very refreshing for the style. A definite winner for a session wheat beer. This would be a good choice to give a BMC drinker and introduce him/her to the world of craft beer."
"Despite my slight disappointment in the flavoring, I found this to be an extremely pleasant and drinkable (if unremarkable) beer. I could have had a second quite easily."
"All and all is a good choice. Probably not one I'd go out of my way for."
"Overall: drinkable, and okay as a gateway beer, but underwhelming."
"Refreshing is the name of the game for one of the standards of excellence from New Belgium. Golden in color with a bright white head. Smells of citrus and spice evoke an image of taste. A great beer for a hot sunny day or picnic out on the Poudre River. One of the most drinkable beers I know. I goes down so easy. Almost too easy. If that's really possible."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, good representation of style but leans toward being a Witbier. This one is definitely worth drinking for a long time if you want something light, but it might not necessarily be my first choice."
"as for drinkability, i will definitely keep a few of these on hand for those times when dark beer will seem too heavy, when the weather is hot... definitely worth a try on this one!"
"Drinkability: Another of New Belgium's highly drinkable lighter styles"
"D: Refreshing if a little boring."
"Drinkability: Nice on a hot summers day after mowing, though nothing too sensational Seems to be New Belgiums attempt at Kristall Weizen. A good beer for a good price."
"Drinkability: I could have a few of these, definitely thirst quenching."
"The color of this beer definitely follows the name as it is a bright, clear golden color. The head was short and white. The smell was faint wheat and not much else. The taste was also very subdued wheat and the drinkability was pretty high. I could probably substitute this for water on a hot day. I'm not implying that the taste is watery just that it is very easy to drink. Good session beer for a picnic, not so great if you are a fan of wheat beers."
"distinct quality wits- good for them!"
"The taste is decent, with hints of malts and citrus. It's not very hoppy. The mouthfeel is also pretty good, being medium bodied and smooth. All in all, a very drinkable beer. I will definitely get this beer again."
"The taste was much thinner then I remembered, but I'd attribute this to the maturity of my palate. Still, this was very representative of the style -- light, crisp, lots of wheat and the touch of coriander. Definitely a nice summer refresher."
"Golden color with minimal head as before, vague coriander and maybe a hint of orange peel on the nose. On the palate, lacking a bit of the freshness (and lacking an orange slice), this tasted more like there was a macrolager hiding beneath the coriander-wheat flavors...a bit tired. Take home message: when you want a refreshing beer on tap and you don't mind a beer that sort of needs a garnish, this isn't a bad choice. For taking home, the bottle can pretty much be skipped."
"The taste has orange and other citrus flavour up front followed by some wheat and coriander. Put them all together and well...it doesn't seem to work for me at all. I can't say much more than that other than I won't be buying this again and the other 5 bottles of it that I have will be tough to finish."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle to pint glass, good 2 finger foamy head that left some nice lace. Golden yellow, almost straw-like in color, unique color in my opinion. Citrus like smell with a touch of hops. Citrus is present in the taste as well with lemon dominating the flavor, well balanced, not too bitter, not too sweet. Very light and crisp, very refreshing, good amount of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer perfect for summer, my gal had a slice of orange in hers and I have to admit that really spiced it up a bit. Worth a try."
"I don't understand why New Belgium releases any of their non-belgian styles - I haven't liked one yet, including the famous fat tire. I guess you've got to pay the bills? I call BS."
"D: Easy to drink, but so is tap water. A little more flavor here would be much appreciated. Light is the operative word in the style description here."
"Drinkability - Refreshing. I might have it again at the restaurant I was eating at since it does little to impact the flavor of the food. However, I'm pretty confident that I won't go out and buy this one for home, unless it's to please a ""lightweight"" guest."
"Smells of light citrus and yeast. Tastes fuller than expected. Orange flavors up front with a finish of the wheat. After a few more drinks a lime flavor comes out. No yeast flavor detected. This beer isn't quite as light as a white but is just as drinkable. I'd be able to down several on a hot summer's day. A good overall beer. I'd buy it again. This reminds me of the Blue Moon Spring Ale but better."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured a clear straw, forming a very thin head, and leaving very light lacing. Very light citrus aroma. Taste is very light wheat citrus flavor. Light mouthfeel. Overall, a very non-complex ale. Light and smooth. A very sessionable brew, but lacking in the flavor department."
"Pours a pale yellow with thick white head which leaves a nice fine white lace behind as you drink. Smells clean and a bit fruity but nothing overpowering. Feels somewhat thick and smooth in the mouth with a nice balance of carbonation, not too watery as I was afraid it would be. Tastes quite pleasant with orange flavors coming out but very mild, not too strong. Overall a very enjoyable beer from New Belgium."
"D - This beer is easier to drink out of the bottle. With a lower ABV of 4.8% compared to other New Belgium beers it is easier to control a pleasant buzz. After a couple of these beers, the abrasiveness of the carbonation will start to compound might change the overall flavor."
"Pours with a white head that settles vey quickly. Very clear yellow in color. Not overly carbonated. Not a lot of odor or discernable taste. Nothing that really stands out or offends the senses. Its good to see a beer that doesnt try to do too much. Extremely easy to drink, but other than that, nothing to write home about."
"Without the foamy white head, this beer would look very similar to a glass of Bud or Miller. Yes, it looks fizzy and yellow. The smell is beyond subtle and almost non-existent. Some spicy notes are barely detectable, but it has nothing else in the nose. The taste, unfortunately, is as lackluster as the smell. It's far from offensive but it has absolutely nothing to recommend it. Mouthfeel is a bit light. On the bright side, it does slide down the gullet quite easily on a warm early spring afternoon. However, this is a passer in the future."
"First stop on my day with New Belgium."
"Decent wheat beer. Not the best."
"Pours out a bright oglden with good deal of carbonation, a thin head, and some decent lacing. Smell is, of course, wheaty, in a cracker-like way. Good amount of coriander and citrus peel as well. Smells rather clean. The flavor starts off really pleasant with the coriander, orange, and wheat, but then finishes a bit too grainy for my tastes. Light bodied and kind of prickly. This is far from stellar, but it is a good drinker, at least."
"Poures a crystal clear yellow with a nice thick white head. Aromas of wheat and citrus, in particular lemon and a little orange. Taste is of spicy wheat and citrus. A pretty drinkable American wheat. A beer that I don't mind having once in a while and makes for a nice summer session brew."
"Sunshine Wheat Beer pours straw colored with a pure white head that falls quickly. Bubbles rise quickly from the glass. I smell wheat, citrus, and hints of pine. The flavor was mostly wheat with subtle citrusy hop flavors in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is great. Very full bodied for the color. The drinkability on this is good, and would be better if it was warm outside instead of Upstate NY in December."
"I enjoyed this beer. It's a little spiced. It has a lemony and citrusy flavor. The head wasn't impressive, and the nose was nice but faint. I enjoyed this beer. It would probably be better as a summertime beer. It has a bit of a dry aftertaste, but it wasn't bad. Mouthfeel was good and the beer was easy to drink. It's worth a try."
"I tried this at Illegal Pete's on Pearl St. while visiting Boulder. It's a straw yellow with a thin white head. Crisp and clean with a mild inoffensive flavour. A mild wheat beer to be sure. I tried this on a cold November day and I'm sure I would have enjoyed this more had it been summertime. To be fair I should try it again as I was more in the mood for a pale ale but my girlfriend wanted to share this with me."
"This one arrived with a huge, frothy, bone-white head. It had extremely bright clarity in a pale-lemon colored beer with fantastic effervescence. The nose had a faint, wheat-driven sweetness. The mouthfeel was full, thanks to the aforementioned effervescence. The taste was light and slightly fruity with a very refreshing dryness on the finish."
"Sunshine Wheat Beer was a pale yellow color with a white head. The head did not last long and soon only a ring remained. The aroma was mainly citrus. The taste was lemon, a little sweet upfront and drying out in the finish. The body was light with medium carbonation. Drinkability was fairly good. Overall it a pretty average wheat beer."
"D: Wasn't expecting much upon first pour, however smell and taste is very above average for wheat beers in my opinion."
"I drove about 30 minutes to get this beer and would gladly do it again."
"I was expecting something a little more flavorful, similar to a hefe weizen, but its decent for what it is. The filtering of the yeast seemed to remove some complexity. This beer is still refreshing, a good pick of the sunshine of summer."
"Poured a hazy blonde very similar to a witbier or Hefe, with notable carbonation. Very small head, but with some lace making it all the way down to the bottom of the glass. Wheat and malt are in the forefront, with honey, lemon, and coriander also making an appearance. Overall, sweet and clean with a crisp carbonated mouthfeel. Very drinkable, especially during the summer."
"A light pale, hazy blonde with strong bubbling emerges after the pour. A mild head and par foam is also noted. Plenty of light fruit and spices hit the nose. A nice wheat character is developed nicely in the front of teh palate. Thats where the spices make the best presence. PLenty of lighter malts also felt in the tongue. A pretty ginger ale dry, sweet beer nice and refreshing. Perfect for stefleling hot Summer afternoons and nights."
"D - Give me a thousand of these on a hot, muggy summer day like today, and you'll have a thousand empties by tomorrow. It's quite a thirst quencher. During the winter, though, I might only finish 500."
"Not overly exciting but, still an easy drinker."
"This is a drinkable beer. It could be a bit more full flavored in terms of taste, but a very drinkable, light and refreshing brew just the same."
"Straw colored, a little haze, but definitely see through. Average white head, lasted throughout (as usual for New Belgium). Aroma is very wheaty and bready, of lemon grass and orange peel, and a fair amount of coriander. Pretty complex aroma for a simple pale wheat beer. The taste was alright, at first I thought I was a bit strong in coriander for my liking, but that kind of mellowed as the beer went on. As in the aroma it tasted very wheaty with lemon grass and orange peel. Sparkling, tangy mouthfeel, aftertaste doesn't last long. Kind of a plain beer all in all, but great for drinking on hot days."
"Pours a clear yellow with a nice puffy white head. Coriander and orange on the nose. Flavors are citrus, sour but pleasent. Haven't been overly thrilled with NBB. However, this one was very nice, light, albeit somewhat watery, refreshing summer time brew. Thanks to jhammerly for the bottle."
"Pours a five finger pillowy white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Chrystal clear pale yellow/amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Citrusy/yeasty nose. Starts balanced, coriander really stands out, clean finish. Excellent summer beer. Previous reviewer ended up with a bad bottle. Best before Aug 2006. $1.30 for a 12oz bottle from Liquid Solutions Tigard, Or."
"I'll review this again next time I find it but for now, that's all I have."
"This beer poured a clear yellow with a very light, thin head. The smell contains notes of citrus and malt. Mouthfeel and taste was very light, with hints of orange. There is a very light hint hops in the aftertaste. This would be a great beer to quench your thirst on a hot summer day, but is otherwise relatively unremarkable. I'd drink it again, if I didn't have to pay for it."
"D - Drinkable. Not a bad brew, but not something I would buy again."
"I wasn't expecting much from this beer but was pleasantly surprised. It's very light and refreshing, too bad it's not available in Minnesota. A good beer for a hot summer day."
"Overall, a shadow of a witbier. The orange and coriander do stand out, but only for a moment, and the rest of the beer fails to back it up with characteristic witbier complexity. The finish is just....bland. I like NB's lineup for the most part, but this is definitely the least of their beers I have tried."
"On tap at the Denver airport. Pale gold and clear with lots of carbonation. Aromas of grainy wheat, lemon, along with some mild floral and spice notes. The flavors are tart lemon, and perhaps some light Centennial hops? Light bodied and refreshing without feeling overly watery. Simple and refreshing, and still full of flavor. A good warm weather session beer."
"Drinkability - easy to have a lot of these in a day and not worry about being too intoxicated!"
"Pours a clear light yellow, lots of fizzing action and a good whitish permi-head. Aroma is subdued, but a nice amount of coriander and orange peel. Taste is likewise, with a nice orange peel front with a leveling malt/wheat base that evens out and finishes with a nice coriander. Body is light and springy and very refreshing, particularly after this hot day. Whenever I see New Belgium, I don't see this, which is kind of sad, because I'd most likely pick it up again."
"Had one with dinner at the Bellagio in Vegas. Not impressed. Pours a slightly hazy dull gold with a minimum head. Small white head. Some citrusy smell but not pronounced. Taste did not stand up. Some wheat smoothness,but the overall taste had too much lemon and was pretty bland. Mouthfeel was a bit weak and watery. I had no problem finishing one, but would not have ordered another."
"Overall impression: Not bad - but not very interesting either. Definitely pass this one over for New Belgium's more interesting offerings .. maybe they will replace this with their new Wit."
"Pours leaving only a faint wisp of foam that dissolves into a clear, pale yellow/straw colored body. The smell does not present strongly, with only hints of coriander and orange spice. The taste is mild and bready, carrying a light sweetness with notes of orange and other citrus. Finish is not particularly remarkable. Overall flavor is quite mild and simple. The body is light with a decent burst of carbonation. Drinkablilty fares well as you can finish it easily, although the lack of complexity makes it hard to come back to for another."
"Bought a six-pack to bring with me fishing yesterday. Had one of them from the bottle and thought it was ass-awful, just terrible. It tasted like an American lager of the worst sort. But then I gave it a second shot at home. Poured one into a glass. It's got a very light look to it, almost like diet lemonade or something. And what a bright white head! Very uniform tiny bubbles, like champagne. The taste improved tenfold! Cool, crisp, wheaty. Beautiful light flavor and super freshing. I poured myself another right after the first."
"Crisp/clean feeling. Leaves me thirsty."
"D- The sourness isn't bad, but I'm wondering if this one's past it's prime. I may try and find a fresher batch next time, if there is a next time"
"D - Super easy drinking. Refreshing and thirst-quenching."
"Pretty good beer. Nicely flavored. The underlying brew could be a little better, but worth a try."
"I'll not hesitate to buy some more of these during the summer."
"I was expecting a maltier and breadier beer. It is not a bad beer, perhaps just the name is misleading."
"Pours an almost neon straw yellow with a cm of snow white head that fades instantly. Nose is a weak mix of cracker, lemon juice, ground pepper and a hint of coriander. Taste is slightly acidic, a bit spicy, a little citrus sweet, yet overall uninspiring, even for an APWA. Mouthfeel is very thin and watery, very little body to speak of. A rather uninspiring stab at a lawnmower beer. Not bad, but not impressive in any way either. Yawn."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Smell is faint and hardly there. Some citrus flavors in the aroma. Tastes of coriander and ground orange peel, but there needs to be much more flavor from the spices for this to even be considered adequate and the yeast and malt character are far from ample. Light in body and character. Dull, disappointig yeast character. Terrible, especially considering the style."
"Pours a crystal clear, super light pale yellow color, much like a american light lager blah. Good amount of head is produced with decent tracing. Aromas of wheat, biscuit, a little spice and lemon. Light overall however. Flavor is rather light; high in the biscuity flavors with a mild citrusy background. High carbonation, very refreshing, certainly not the time of year to be enjoying. Hops show nothing giving it a little tartness in the end. I can't wait to stock the fridge with this when the hot Kansas summer comes along. Certainly a light beer, which isn't so much appealing, but it has its place. Would choose any NB brew over this, but not a bad attempt."
"Overall Impression: Clean and easy! This is one to woo your macro friends with! Great coriander taste, no flaws noted. Bravo! A tough style to really wow me with, but NB did it! Recommended!"
"Drinkability is ok for the styleonce again don't see the point of making watered down wheat shit and calling it American but if rating to style guess this one is as good as any of them. Thanks to BCG BIF and babydoc for this one."
"FYI -it was served with a lemon. I didn't use it."
"Wifey really liked hers too; I can see us enjoying these on the deck as we watch the purple martins. New Belgium is available over here where I work in Missouri, but it doesnt cross the Illinois border yet."
"D: A good session beer. I'd say this beer is good for those who want to watch some football but not have to drink adjunct-laden macrobrews. But as for a hierarchy of taste, this one is not really too premium."
"In spite of being somewhat boring, it's very drinkable and an easy session brew especially on a warm day in the sun."
"Drinkability: I'd drink this again, I think. It was indeed tasty, and I do enjoy a good wheat beer."
"Not so with this one however. Grassy lemon notes blend with a slight musty character to make it very interesting in the nose. Sptritzy and peppery, with a slight acidity and more lemony notes as it goes down. This may be the best American wheat I've had. Very good, very refreshing, and an excellent representation of the style."
"It might have been the fact that i had it on tap at the brewery, but i enjoyed Sunshine more than any of the other beers we tasted there. It was extremely smooth, if maybe a little weak but that surprizingly did not detract from my enjoyment of the brew. Hints of wheat, fruit, and maybe a little honey in there too. Haven't had it in the bottle so maybe it doesn't translate to an enclosed environment all that well."
"A little thin on taste but definitely drinkable and thirst quenching. Should go well with most food and will definitely work well as a cooler in hot weather."
"The body is on the light side but it is smooth and easy to drink. Best enjoyed on tap at the brewery but when your 12 hours drive away, the bottle will do."
"Opinion: I feel that this beer is a bit light. I know that wheat beers arent supposed to be imperial, but the backbone to the malt really isnt there. It is nice that it is so clear, but the body is gone as evidenced by the head retention. This beer may actually benefit from the traditional Weizen thin-slice of Lemon."
"A year later, and a twelve-pack of this pretty okay brew, and I've got to say it's fairly decent. Not overly complex, just enough malted wheat and hops mix to keep things fairly interesting. Hints of orange and clove are there, but not nearly like a German H-W. This might just be interesting enough to be a decent session beer. The ABV is in the right range, to be sure."
"Straw coloured without much head. This smells and tastes very much of apricot. If you like apricot you'll surely appreciate this, but if not you should probably steer well clear of it. Strong carbonation but with pin prick type bubbles help to make this feel very refreshing, and definitely a summer beer. There is a slight lingering cereal aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with fast moving carbonation that attacks the mouth. Goes down fairly easily but overall it doesn't grab me. The spiciness does kick it up a notch against most of the other bland pale wheat ales. Worth a shot but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again. Thanks mentor for the opportunity."
"Boring light thirst quencher here. I can see the use of this as a lawnmower beer, but it isn't that great."
"This was an all around boring beer for me. It poured a clear golden color with a little sticky lace. The was very mild and smelt of wheat and light hops. It tasted very light-bodied and a little floral hint here and there. Very easy to drink and not that tasty."
"I'm not sure that I can describe this beer any better than average. It had decent color. Amber. Decent carbonation. Light mouthfeel. The smell was mild. Light floral sweetness. The taste was about the same. A nice floral sweetness and a good sweet bready malt. Nothing steller, but decent. Easy to drink at least."
"I would drink this again. It was one of the better examples from the U.S."
"Appearance transparent straw color with a pale white head and minimal lacing. Aroma contains hay, citrus and grains. Initially it hits the tongue with cloves and some pretty slim amounts of malt and hops. Watery, thin and lacking in much flavor. One is left wanting more, and quite unsatisfied. Try Widmer Bros. Hefe."
"Pours a brilliantly clear, bright gold color and is topped by a frothy pale white head. The aroma has a sweet, grassy grain note to it as well as a hint of candied orange aromatics to it. The taste is light and refreshing up front with a definite citrus note and a hint of acidity to it. This beer is quite refreshing in its simplicity. There are some spicy hints of ginger and pepper in the finish as well. This really is a summer time refresher; light, quaffable and fairly straight forward. Despite the simplicity it is quite enjoyable."
"But the taste is smooth and subtley sweet. It isn't sugary or syrupy sweet. It is a good tasting wheat with a pleasant rice candy or summer fruit taste. Very refreshing."
"This is probably realistically about as good as you can expect from this style. Bright, clear and covered with a nice head. A fresh nose and a clean first sip make this a good summer drink that make not mistakes but also creates little real excitement. A decent beer in a style that hits the quality ceiling pretty quickly."
"got this one for free from work. about 1 finger of bright white head on top of a crystal clear pale yellow colored brew. the head quickly deminishes to a thin layer of bubbles. smell is rather spicy. taste is clean with some fruitty spicyness. i am partial to the texture and body of wheat beers. something about them just seems to go down quite nice."
"This beer pours a very light golden yellow. The head is white, but is nearly non existant. I see absolutely no laces. The beer looks like apple juice in a glass. Not cloudy like you would expect from a wheat beer. It smells fruity. I detect bananas, and lemon. Maybe a little honey also. It tastes like honey. It has a slight citrus taste to it also. The flavor is so mild that it is almost non existant. It is crisp, and refreshing. It leaves a slight honey taste on the palate. It goes down smooth. It is carbonated well. This beer would make a good session beer if you dont like beer. It has so little flavor, that it is boring. You could drink a case by your self with no problem. This one is not worth your time or money. I will probably never drink this beer again."
"Pours a clear golden/straw color with a small, creamy white head. Nice nose of wheat, ale yeast, and notes of lemon and honey. Palate is well-balanced, with light floral hops complementing the subtle malt character. A touch of spiciness on the finish, with additional notes of citrus. Medium-bodied, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Great on a cool spring evening."
"The beer is drinkable and has no real faults, just sort of lacking in the flavor department."
"A decent wheat beer. It's not exactly like a Euro Heffe, but it's pretty close. Reminds me of summer in the mountains. New Belgium recommends serving it with an orange instead of a lemon and I think they're probably right, because it already has quite a bit of lemon in it. Has a nice straw color, but could use a little more carbonation."
"Hints of corriander and orange peel in the smell, but very clear and crisp in appearance. I think a previous reviewer's opinion of apple juice in appearance was very accurate. I would be very interested to try this offerring in its un-filtered state (hint, hint) Refreshing, crisp and clean, very suited to a hot weather beer. I am big fan of Hoegaarden, and I would rate this as a close second to that. A worthy offerring from NB."
"i would love to have a handful of these on a sunny day. This would be a great replacement for the stereotypical beach beer: corona... because this is actually tasty."
"this beer is worth a try but not a very good example of the style. there are a lot better beers out there in this style."
"The taste reminds me quite a bit of Blue Moon, but I like it better, and not just because of the macro factor. It has a coriander and orange peel taste on top of the malty wheat base. The mouthfeel is very light, only the slightest bit dry. Very highly drinkable. If you are a wheat beer fan, check it out."
"Light bodied and crisp."
"Mouthfeel is flat and watery with not much carbonation and almost no body. Drinkability is great if you don't want to taste your ale. If you're in to this kind of thing, save your money: buy Natural Light and squeeze a bit of orange into it. Maybe a dash of coriander if you're feeling rich."
"Drinkability: Drinkable but I really wouldn't order another one on tap."
"I never thought I would ever say anything negative about New Belgium, but this is my least favorite of their offerings. It reminds me of <gasp> a BUD LIGHT!! No head, no aroma, no character to speak of. It was even kind of flat, with no lacing and very little carbonation. Pale, straw yellow, with little taste (despite the label's proclamations of coriander and orange, I taste nothing of the ilk). A comparison to other wheat beers is a mismatch. Boulevard Wheat blows it away. This is just a plain beer. Not bad, but not something I would seek out regularly. Now Abbey Ale, on the other hand, that is simply heavenly . . . ."
"This beer almost reminds of the Hoegaarden White. Except not as good. It certainly smells nice, but the taste is too watery. Doesn't really have an appealing appearance either. It's not a terrible beer by any means, but I'd rather have Hoegaarden."
"Pours very light pale wheat colored. A little head, medium carbonation. Smell is almost nonexistent. Taste is quite light, nice wheat notes but very light. Mouthfeel is pretty good. I'd drink this if I didn't really want a beer, it's a bit too light for me."
"All in all, this New Belgium Sunshine Wheat beer is a good offering from the people at New Belgium and I will be back for more."
"Very refreshing beer. Considered as a Belgian wit, it has the some of the requisite flavors but in small amounts. As an American wheat (as it's listed here), however, it makes an excellent, much more interesting beer than many US wheat beers. I'd like some more yeast character, but that's a quibble."
"I have enjoyed all of the other New Belgium offerings but won't go out of my way for this one."
"Somewhat disappointing, with limited New Belgium experience, I was hoping for a bit more. This would be a good beer if you just finished mowing the yard, but not for much else."
"This 12 oz. bottle was provide in person by Southernbrew. The beer poured pale macro yellow with a small ring of fizzy bubbles (Id not even call it a head), that disappeared rapidly. The aroma was totally unlike the attributes the label suggested. All I could detect was graininess and faint sweetish malts. There was no hint of banana, orange peel, or coriander on the nose. The taste was clean, and dull. There was no wheat beer fruity edge. Instead this was basically a purified and cleaned up macro. There was a lemony twang in the finish with a hint of spiciness, and the mouthfeel was a few notches above most macros. There was nothing really wrong with the beer except for the allusion of getting a Belgian style wheat beer on the label. I am sorry, but this is not even close to that."
"The taste greatly resembled the smell, with a good base of wheat and malt, with a nice citrus tartness off setting it. This is a very refreshing and pleasent beer, that is great to drink anytime, and especially during the summer."
"A decent wit...I prefer mine with more substance, yeast, and orange oomph, but this would make a satisfying thirst-quencher on a hot summer-day."
"Overall, this is not a very good wit. I have had better samples in the past, but even those are pretty mediocre."
"All in all, a pretty good wheat by a company that I believe has a pretty good line-up over all. Very drinkable, and very refreshing. I'm not a fan of tossing a lemon into a beer, but the citrusy taste that this one brings with it is a very good addition."
"This beer pours a very pale color - reminds me of bud light. Way too light - needs some cloudyness. The aroma was very much orange citrus and not much else. The body wasn't there. The taste was very much citrus as well. I was very disappointed with this beer. It isn't what I call a witbier. Uninteresting."
"Thanks to the mystery beer-fairy that left this on my doorstep today. This one pours a very transparent slightly golden yellow. The nose is overpowering orange citrus. No malts come through in this one. The head is non-existant. The flavor is citrusy and thin. There is a grainy/grassy finish. Blah. Mouthfeel is light. This would be a good lawnmower beer on a very hot day, very cold. Bleh."
"It's light and refreshing, with a little Belgian snap to it."
"This is ok in a bland sort of way, but not very memorable. Since this one is past it's best by date, I'll give it another chance sometime, though it didn't taste spoiled in any way. There's just not much here, it seems."
"Consumed in October, 2004 from a 12 oz bottle. Pours with a small head that disappears quickly with virtually zero lace. A deep yellow straw colored liquid sits in my glass. Smells of cloves and corriander fill the air. Maybe a grassy smell as well. Tastes pretty much like the smell. Dated Oct 14, so it's pretty close to it's freshnesses end. Tastes kinda like a witbier bud. Not the best thing. Has a bit of character though. Would like to try it from the tap and see the difference. No need to do the bottle again."
"There's a nice little bit of hoppiness here, but overall - well, its a light beer that would fit a few occasions perfectly. Would I lust over it or even really buy it? Nah."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent as well. It has a mild wheat scent with limited yeast fruitiness. It seems to have some pale malts as well. The taste is good. It has a crisp and spicey wheat flavor with some malts. There is a touch of coriander and bitter orange peel in here to spice up the taste; nice touch. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good seasonal wheat beer. I was skeptical with the aroma and appearance, but the taste made up for it. This is a good drinking beer."
"Overall, felt like very much like a Lite Wheat Beer, and whilst it was better than the other Big3 choices on offer at the Airport, it is not one I would seek out again. Rather a disappointment actually, I expected better from New Belgium. Way too thin."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden colored beer with a medium head with average retention. Aroma is quite strong on the coriander and orange peel side and a bit weak on the wheat side. I think just a bit more balance would have been appreciated. The Coriander and the orange peel, which lent a funky feeling, also overpower taste. Carbonation is a bit too thin and body is just above average. This is not a bad beer just not what was expected."
"Sunshine Wheat pours a light and shiny golden shade with a two finger head that doesn't stick around very long. Carbonation is pretty high. Aroma is mainly of wheat, but a nice lemony zest is also detected. Taste is fairly light-bodied, especially the wheat. Lemony finish is the strong flavor here. Flavor is nice and light, but I think it could have been a little more complex. Drinkability is good, this is a nice summertime brew. This seems like a solid example of the style (based on the three witbiers I've had), but I'm sure there is plenty better out there."
"Pours a darker golden yellow with slight haziness, the head is a nice 2 inch thick beauty, however doesn't hold up through the session, not much lacing to speak of. The smell is strong of straw and buttered bread, slight light sweet sugar malts detected. The taste is clean and refreshing but lacking alot of taste, the bready straw taste is what comes clear, a hint of lemon detected, the two don't creat the harmony I like. Light bodied and refreshing but not the best or even close really."
"[note: the style has since been changed to American Pale Wheat Ale, which explains a lot]"
"Drinkability: Very good, not the best wit I've had, but better than most."
"Looks like apple juice. Clear, light golden with an almost lifeless amount of carbonation. Almost the perfect aroma for a wit. Not too perfumey. Just the right amount of orange and corriander spice. A little wheat. And a little lemon. Nice refreshing brew. Good spicing on the palate. Some wheat tang. Just the slightest bit of bitterness. More carbonated than it looks, but could use a little more. Medium body. Leaves the palate clean. Not bad."
"Pours a clear light golden color with not much head to speak of no sediment no nice fluffy head not very impressive.Aromas of toasted malt and coriander but not much of the fruitiness I was hoping for.Taste like the aroma alot of toasted malt and some light spiciness with the toasted flavor coming thru again in the finish with a very light wheatiness to it.Not much to this beer thought it might be a little better but decent for the porch on a warm day like today."
"ng"
"This beer poured a very faint yellow with a head that dissapated really fast. The smell is a citrus and kinda spicy smell to it. The taste sure has some spice to it from the coriander. Its a well rounded beer. Has a nice clean flavorfull aftertaste ."
"You could pound this all day long, You could down it any chance, easier then some BMC creation, but it's sublte cahrecters are the reason why you slwoly savor this well made brew"
"I had this beer at the brewery originally, and I think my excitement of actually being there a day after skiing in June and a week into a beer/skiing/fly-fishing cross country trip may have tainted my original judgement. At the time I thought it was an exceptional wheat beer, now I'd place it at average. I just cracked open a bottle brought to me by a friend and I was a bit let down. Its better than your average american wheat beer, but it doesn't approach other belgian style offerings such as Blanche de Brooklyn or Whirlwind Wit from Victory. Its a bit of a paradox... a filtered spiced wheat beer. Pours almost lager-golden with a nice fluffy head. Spices and orange are evident in the smell. At first taste, the beer is a bit too carbonated in my opinion. Not nearly as smooth as it could be. Spicing is evident, but not as pronounced as I'd expect from a NB brew. Finishes a bit tart and dry. Not a bad beer at all, just not up to what I would expect from NB."
"thanks to beer angel for the sample!"
"Nice golden yellow color, lofty head. Smell is dominated by lemon and citrus, just a hint of pepper and spice. Taste is smooth and mellow, but very citrusy and lemony. The most lemony beer I've every had. Not much wheat or yeast to speak of, and the pepper and spices are subtle at best. Tasty but not spectacular."
"This is exemplary beer, and towers above most of New Belgium's brews, even Fat Tire."
"I was hoping for some haziness in his beer, but I found none. Sunshine pours clear as well..sunshine. A very clear straw color, and really looks like a decent lager, which is too bad considering it is a wheat. The smell was light and crisp with a bit of graininess. There wasn't a whole lot to the taste in this beer. It tasted like a watered down wheat. There was a very subtle hint of spices that were so weak I couldn't place them. I was hoping to find some complex yeast flavors, but found none. The bottle says it was brewed in Belgian wheat tradition, but how can that be if they don't bother with the secondary fermentation. All in all this seems sort of like the diet coke of wheat beers. If you want something light and refreshing, that isn't a lager, this is for you, but if you want an interesting and tasty wheat beer look elsewhere."
"It is a slightly hazy pale golden color. The aroma is light and has some berries in the nose. The body is creamy yet light with some fruitiness. It finishes with a delicate bitterness. A decent refreshing wheat beer. Since NB is not local to me, I won't be stretching too far to drink this beer often."
"Arrives in a pint glass with a frothy, bright white head -- somewhat thin because the bartender kindly filled me to the brim -- straw yellow body. Smell is a subtle flourish of yeast and subdued malt sweetness -- earthy and solid. Taste opens with a yeasty hop bitterness that levels out into a slightly spicy blunt plain of malts and yeast. Aftertaste is sweet -- like buttery fresh baked croissants. Lots of carbonation -- body is thin and refreshing. Very enjoyable."
"This wheat beer poured a clear, golden yellow color with creamy, white foam that settled but clung to the glass. The smell was very faint (but perhaps a slight fruitiness could be detected). The taste was slightly fruity with notes of wheat, some floral hops, light grain, and very light citrus. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium-light body and good carbonation. This was a decent, light wheat ale on tap."
"Big dissapointment. Reminded me of Harpoons UFO. There aren't many American brewers that can acomplish a decent wheat beer in my opinion. This one poured slightly hazy and gold with an ample white head. Aroma was ok, wheatmalt and spice perhaps. Flavor was not very good. Overall very average."
"Final Thoughts: First had on tap. Came served COLD, with a lemon. This is always done here (especially with the Boulevard Wheat). I HATE lemon wedges (or lime) in my beer. If I want fruit in my beer I'll ask for it. Had to buy a six to review at home. Can be had on sale for about $5.99 a six. Will definately purchase again, without the lemons."
"Solid, but I don't know if I like my beers vegetabley..."
"Appearance: Slightly cloudy golden hue with a rather thin white head but it does leave behind thin strips of lacing between each sip. Aroma: Coriander blended with wheat bread sweetness some definite orange peel evident as well, a bit tame but nice and balanced. Taste: Incredibly refreshing with the smack your lips together sharp sweetness blended with the spices makes me happy a very refreshing tasty version of this style. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied strong carbonation blends well in the mouth has a nice texture going down adding to the drinkability. Drinkability: Summer wheat that can be enjoyed year round in my opinion this is excellent so drinkable and tasty, I am a fan."
"Question: whered the yeast go? I dont know except that it wasnt in the bottom of the bottle. While Sunshine Wheat is drinkable (I didnt dump it), it looks more like a pilsener minus the hops profile. This beer is almost macro-esque in stature, lacking any of the more robust aromas and flavors of other witbiers. Overall, a dull, boring beer that I have a hard time believing is designed in the Belgian wheat beer tradition as stated on the label."
"Lemon frosted sugar cookie nose drifts above wan yellow wheat. Flavor is partially spice, hop, citrus and sweet malt, but all balanced. Charged and light through the pipes. A quality brew even if you live in an apartment."
"Poured a clear golden with little carbonation and a thin white head. Aroma is spicy hops with a touch of coriander and a definite orange scent. Taste is very clean with a light fruity flavor that is citrus with a further citrus flavor from the coriander. It is very clean and refreshing though a little weak on the spices. It has a creamy maltiness that is very appealing and gives this beer a smooth flavor. Drinkable on a sunny day when the lawnmower calls for a sacrifice."
"I was somewhat dissappointed with this beer because I have enjoyed many other Fat Tire beers within their line and I really feel they do a great job. In my opinion this one came off more as an American style wheat beer. It has a very nice unoffensive taste. A nice lemony-citrusy aroma and a mild spiciness. Compared to some other American Belgian-Wit beers, this one lacks the spiciness and flavor that is present in many other varieties like Allaghash or Victory. I would say this is more of an American Wheat/Belgian Wit hybrid. Drinkable, but not awe-inspiring."
"Comments: This is a very nice wheat and a great summer drink. I wish I had discovered it earlier in the season. A warm afternoon by the grill with a few of these would have been really nice!"
"Light gold color, small foamy head. Aroma is grassy, grainy and sweet. Light bodied wheat. A lighter tasting, mild flavored wheat beer. Light malts and hops. Light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly malty."
"Flavor: this is a slightly crisp, hot weather beer. Definitely something you'd have after mowing the lawn"
"I will definitely have this beer again. It is good, not great."
"I agree with some other reviews that the label ""wheat"" on this beer is a little misleading. I enjoyed this beer nonetheless. Pours a clear light yellow with lotsa bubbles and a big, white, marshmallowy head. I kinda wish that it was unfiltered though. Smell is tart, peppery, wheat and coriander. Spicy, peppery malts dominate the palate, followed by a yeastily-bitter, orange finish. Not great, and not my favorite New Belgium summer beer (see Loft and Porch Swing), but a nice refreshing brew."
"Comments  This is a light, fruity type of beer. The wheat in the name is misleading as it conjures weitzen and hearty malts."
"For the BJCP style ""witbier", I'd give this beer maybe a 3.8 out of 5. As mentioned above I don't think this quite fits into witbier area although I'm not sure exactly where I'd put it. It wasn't dry enough and wasn't quite as tart or spicy as I'd have liked."
"I would say that this offering from New Belgium is a good, ""summertime"" transition beer for folks who have yet to have a non-macro beer. It's a fairly ""safe"" brew that doesn't totally lack in flavor."
"Active, lively carbonation make this a good one to wash out the throat with on a steamy day. But all told, it is a middle of the road Wit."
"Very drinkable beer indeed..despite the bad reviews I thouroughly enjoyed this."
"Its a not unpleasant exploration from the wit style, and might well be attractive to a potential convert from macros, and would certainly be welcome on a hot steamy St. Louis afternoon."
"It poured a nice light golden yellow with very little foam. The smell was not impressive. The aroma had just a hint of perfume or what ever. The flavor was nice, but not really what I was looking for. It had an citrus/grainy flavor, but, with a very pleasant after taste. I could not taste any wheat in this beer. I think, if you make a wheat beer, it should have a wheat taste. Nothing here!"
"Drinkability: This is a subpar example of a Belgian wit. All of the traditional flavors are there, but in small quantities. Disappointing..."
"Tasted: 04/15/03"
"Clear pale yellow, little lasting head, but with some lace. Citrus and coriander in the aroma. Palate is sweetish, but a balanced sweetness, slightly spicy, and softly citric, tasty, but i had higher hopes for this beer, still, well balanced, refreshing, i liked it."
"(Thanks to jeffboo for procuring the bottle)"
"This was a very disappointing beer from New Belgium. I am a fan of many of their brews, but I will have to pass on this one in the future. If I hadn't poured the beer myself, I would have never known it was a wheat."
"Very light-bodied. Consequently, it's like drinking water. These go down fast and easy. Nothing challenging about this brew -- which is oftentimes a good thing. I'd have it again though perhaps not purchase it -- and I'd definitely use it with friends not yet enlightened."
"Acquired this pleasant Witbier via trade. Sure it has a summer look and feel to it, but it sure hit the spot after shoveling snow! Pours a clear gold color with a thin white head and mild effervescence. Very little lacing. Aroma is lightly hopped with a little citrus and vanilla. Flavor is smooth, and consists of hops, citrus and a touch of honey. Not as yeasty as some Wits, which was a nice change. Finish is thin but most Wits seem that way to me. Low on the complexity scale but good for what it is."
"This is strange, no yeast sediment? No haziness? That's odd for this style. It must be filtered. Not much of a head in the beginning, and it doesn't stay all that well. Major appearance points off for these things. However, there is hope. Big and spicy aroma here, a very enjoyable one too. Coriander and wheat/grain hit you in a big way. A little bubble gum is noticeable too. As for the flavor, it's very tasty, more full-flavored than many other Belgian wits. The wheat/graininess and coriander again play a large role, but further complexities exist here, such as orange peel and small, but definitely noticeable, hop bitterness. Sweetness is more noticeable on the tongue in certain areas than in others. Overall, a bit off for the style (which according to the bottle is Belgian-style wheat/wit), but very tasty and enjoyable. Much better than I remember it being the last time I had it."
"Good drinkability. An excellent accompaniment to salad or other light foods. A good bet for those who you seek to convert from the macros."
"This was a bright, clear straw colored beer. It had a very low aroma. I was not able to smell either wheat or malt. The flavor had a very light malt taste. Neither the aroma nor the flavor had banana or cloves which for the style is correct. The mouthfeel was light and the overall drinkability was good. I got this beer at the Red Robin, a burger joint. It complemented my burger well but would not buy this beer for sipping."
"Pours a pale golden straw color with a thin white head that quickly dissipates.  Very clear for a wheat beer.  Nose is a fruity citrus aroma of orange and lemon peel and the taste is very light and crisp with a flavor dominated by coriander with hints of orange and honey.  It is a very refreshing beer and would be nice on a hot summer day."
"Another damn decent American Wheat!"
"Pours a slightly ""Chill Hazed"" golden color, mighty white frothy head and lace that clings in sheets to the glass. Nose is lemony, malt, crisp and fresh. Start malt sweet, top reedy,  the finish is scrupulously hopped, agreeably acidic, droughty long lasting aftertaste. I find most of New Belgium's beers to be top notch, this one while quite drinkable and a good change of pace is not a favorite."
"Sunshine pours a clear, pale golden hue with a bubbly head, which leaves some really nice lace all the way down the glass. The smell is of orange peel, coriander and other spices. Taste is rather orange-ish with notes of coriander present. It's fairly well spiced, but seems somewhat artificial. Feels a little thin and, dare I say, watery in the mouth. Easy drinker -- would make for a great summer thirst-quencher. This is a decent American offering of a classic Belgian style."
"Pours a clear golden color with a small head that dissipates very rapidly.  The smell is that of an earthy burnt wheat.  Very bubbly and looks very thin.  Has a coriander spice that is very apparent followed by a mild wheat taste with some hops that hit in the middle and taper to the end.  Very interesting brew.  It is light bodied and drinkability doesn't really go as well as the flavor.  Cheers!"
"Yet another masterpiece by New Belgium. This beers appearance is true to the name. It has a distinct citrus smell to it, mostly orange and lemon. The taste much like the smell is distinctly citrusy with a lighter wheat taste. Personally, I think I would have enjoyed a bit more of a wheat taste to it. It has a only decent mouthfeel to it, but the drinkability is great. This would be a perfect beer for a sweltering hot summer day."
"Still another great (ok, very good) New Belgium product."
"Good for a wheat beer.  Not really a Belgian Wheat as it is portrayed.  It's not even close to the quality of a Celis White (in the  Belgian wheat class).  Appearance was the worst part.  Expecting a Belgian Wheat, but got a Kristall Weizen appearance.  Everything else about it was good."
"A good, refreshing, and rather tasty beer. Clean, clear yellow-gold in appearance, poured with a foamy white head. Aromas of spice (coriander) and sweet orange peel. Taste is rather light, with a touch of spice and orange. Definitely a nice beer to have on a hot summer day."
"Pae gold color, large white head when poured, quickly fades to a thin layer with lots of lace.  Well carbonated, a constant stream of fine bubbles rises to the surface.  Pleasing fresh bread aroma with citrus fruits and coriander.  Crisp, tart taste with citrus, wheat, hops, and lots of carbonation, slightly sweet finish with no aftertaste.  Wonderfully refreshing, easy to drink, a perfect summer beer."
"Crystal clear light golden color. Copious bubbles help support the fluffy white head. The soft citrus and spice notes in the aroma from the orange peel and coriander are quite pleasant.  Crisp, almost prickly mouthfeel from the high carbonation and lightly bodied. The citric contributions from the curacao, citrusy hop flavors and wheat tartness combine into a light lemon zest flavor.  Tastes like there's already a lemon in here.  (but not like those lemon alcopops)  Finishes slightly sweet and clean.  Sunshine Wheat's subtle flavors from the spices place it above the norm for the typically bland style."
