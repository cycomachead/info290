"The honey didn't do anything for me. Not as bready and wheaty as I would like but decent taste. An OK beer in a field of a whole bunch of other OK beers."
"Feel: Very refreshing. Light-medium bodied. Very easy to drink. Perfect beer for spring/summer."
""
""
""
"While a fun beer, it seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. The honey is much more prominent and the wheat taste, as well as the fruit and spice tastes that I expected are hidden."

"Yellow/golden in flavor, clear with a slight head, limited retention, minimal lacing.  Sweet bready aroma with some honey in there and some spice that I cannot make out.  Pretty good flavor, was expecting even more sweetness from the smell but still pretty sweet.  Not as much wheat as I expected.  The honey is there along with what seems like cinnamon and even some vanilla.  Really clean taste.  Good carbonation on the tongue when drinking, and the malts has me licking my lips between sips which is great.  Overall, a pretty good sweet wheat beer."
"I like the honey Chamomile aftertaste, hard to get Wolavers in Philly area. The variety pack with the Wildflower, Brown Ale, Oatmeal Stout is awesome."
"One of my favorite beers, unfortunately I can't find it in the Cleveland area anymore."

"I really like this slightly sweet, light, summer beer.  Nice cloudy, golden color.  Lacking a good head though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth golden poor with decent head retention. The taste was smooth with a background of honey. The honey was not over powering but a fine back addition. Easily one of my favorite summer brews yet."

"Poured a cloudy gold body with decent head that dies slow with some patches. Aroma has a sweet malt vibe to it more than minor yeast or wheat notes along with subtle spices. Smooth, light, easy, this beer has a sweetness to it not normally found in this style of beer (reminds of something sugary and bready like sugar coated pie crust). Not a bad beer but once you get past the sweetness there isn't much to it."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very tasty for such a light beer. Great this humid New England weather."
""
""
""
""
"Try this one, it's a great beer for the money. And if you don't like it... send the remainder to me!"
""
"Overall - This is a great beer to enjoy on a hot day. For those who like strong, sweet flavors in their beer but don't want to drink something heavy like a stout or porter and don't want to deal with something silly and fruity this is a solid option."
"O: Not what I was expecting, but very interesting. Sweet and tasty, but almost too creamy to be refreshing/quenching – full bodied feel offsets the carbonation and kicks the malt profile into overdrive. I want to say interesting again for emphasis. I was surprised by the whole experience. Certainly a unique take on the style"

"Overall: Ultimately, the sweetness started to get to me, but the flavors were interesting and certainly a notch or two above what I was expecting from an American Wheat"

"Swishy. Good carbonation levels. A little sticky. Lighten it up a bit, please."
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent light wheat beer to drink for a while."

"Too much honey and too sweet for me. Maybe with some dessert on a hot day. Besides that one and done for me."

"I selected bottle for this review as my most recent experience was from a bottle. My first experience with this was a 20oz draft at the brewery. Initially this beer really appealed to me. The first scents I picked up were floral notes. Tasting presented a clear honey note, and then hints of floral. Things went south from here. As I drank, the scent of the beer moved to overly sweet, and almost smelled ""flat"". Does not hold carbonation well in both bottle and draft experiences, and to me, this made the flavor feel heavy. As another reviewer said, maybe on a scorching summer day, this might feel and taste right, but I have not been able to finish the 6 pack I brought home."

"M & O - Sweet & creamy with a nice, medium finish. Very well-balanced."
""
"M&D&O - not terribly complex or flavorful. I continue to enjoy Otter Creek without being a huge fan of Wolavers. It is smooth, refreshing, and sessionable. Maybe I should go mow the lawn in 95 degree weather and I would enjoy it more."
""

""
""
"It's a decent wheat ale with a hint of floral notes. Not bad."
""
""
""
"This is simply one of the best, crisp, warm weather ales I've had. Excellent balance of honey and yeast in aroma and flavor, with a nice fresh mouthfeel. 4.25% ABV makes this a perfect compliment to a summer lunchtime sandwich. It never disappoints. One of Otter Creek's/Wolaver's best, along with the Oatmeal Stout."

"I am really enjoying this one this summer. this is a fine example of a honey wheat, everything in exceptional balance. the pour is hazy orange golden, with a fluffy inch of pure white head on top. the aromatics of this beer are splendid. lots of sticky clover honey, light and flavorful, but not a sugary sweet smell at all. notes of soft white wheat and relaxed hops are also present. the flavor is exceptional. the honey is present all the way through, bees seem to swarm to my glass here, the pollen and liveliness of this is remarkable, like a wildflower itself. the chamomile is just right too, not tea heavy or out of place, but distinct, mildly bitter, and a fitting contrast to the honey. this is an artfully made beer with a fuller body for the style and abv, which I love. crisp and clean in the finish despite the honey, perhaps the best beer ive had from wolavers."
""
""

"OVERALL: Consider me impressed with this one. The honey was very flavorful and worked well with the other ingredients."

"pleasantly surprised. had never seen this brand. always afraid of beers that sell themselves on ""organic"". I assume most craft brewers are using the highest quality ingredients they can come by. this has proven itself as a great beer that I will drink and share as often as i can find it."

"O: A nice beer with an amazing mouthfeel. It has a pleasant sweetness that is balanced, though the finish might be sharp."
"O: Havent had too many Organics when it comes to beers, but this one is top notch of its kind. Perfect for spring and summer, great beer!"
""
"This was a pleasant surprise. I was looking for something different but not too light. The color was of a light beer but the taste was very nice. It smelt a little like dirt but did not taste that way at all. I would be able to drink this beer on a regular. Not like certain beers where you can only have one and then have to switch it up. Nice flavor."

"Overall – A bit on the tart side for me, but that is to be expected for the style. Not a bad flavor profile and rather refreshing."

"Poured from a bottle into a weisse vase, the beer is a bright, slightly haze, orange-gold coloring with a steady flow of carbonation throughout and a slim ring of frothy white head around the surface. Aromas of subtle honey and lemon sweetness on a biscuit and wheat background. Smells like a cookie, almost. Flavors are rich and sweet on the forward tongue, almost like a Fall seasonal style. Rich, buttery tones on a biscuit backbone give the palate a heavier load than is usual for Summer beers, or wheats for that matter. Honey and banana highlights are accented with some cinnamon and clove spicing, leaning more towards the White style. No hops presence to speak of throughout the beer. The aftertaste is light, with some roasted qualities accompanying the dying sweetness. Clean, fairly crisp finish, the beer is kept light throughout by the carbonation and balancing flavors."

"This was nice and low in the alcohol department, which made it perfect for a nice Summer day. Not a lot of complexity here and this may be the first beer of the season that I would want to have as a dessert, because of the honey and sugary sweetness. No doubt that this is better than the ""lawnmower beers"" that are out there and worth a try for those looking for some depth during the hotter days."
"D - Light... Fairly refreshing... This would actually make a very unique winter seasonal given the cinnamon (read: holiday) spicing... Decent, but not something that I would readily invest in each and every summer..."

"A simple wheat beer that’s perfectly suited to a hot summer’s day. Unremarkable but well made and very drinkable."

"Sweet and floral with a soothing presence without being cloying. This one goes down easy and tastes great. Perfect for the summer."

"Hazy deep yellow, with a firm, creamy head. Aroma is mild, with chamomile and light grains. A sip reveals a mellow, tasty balance between sweet malts and a mild vanilla/chamomile element going on. It finishes a touch sweet but not cloying. The mouthfeel is crisp and creamy. Overall, a unique take on an American wheat ale. It stands apart from the average american hefe for sure. Quite drinkable, and worth trying."

"Served in a weizen glass, brew pours a slightly hazed and glowing yellow gold with a nice display of diverse carbonation bubbles floating toward a white head. Notes of sweet honey and herb (I'm guessing chamomile flowers...)hint at a zesty and possibly tart wheat brew. Dry and almost sticky mouth coating (non tart) flavors of honey and chamomile gently caress the palate in a well balanced and relatively intense concentration of flavor (stylistically speaking)."

"O - its an ok beer nothing i'd buy lots of."

"12oz bottle purchased at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a hazy yellow body with a quarter inch of short-lived white head. Smells sweet and floral with banana and vanilla notes. Tastes sweet, with banana and nut notes, as well as floral and lemon notes. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Very drinkable. Bright and flavorful. Something good to drink on a hot day I suspect."

"As with the Otter Creek Black IPA I had last night, I found this to be a pleasant surprise. However, I did learn from my experience to not judge this brew by its cover; don't be fooled from the clip-art label into thinking this is lightweight beer. The brewer certainly takes his/her art seriously, and you should too. I'll be on the lookout for more by this brewer in my area."
"An excellent organic wheat ale with a noticeable honey nose and a balanced honey taste upon drinking. A thick mouthfeel that reminds me of honey. The beer tastes reminds me of mead but their is no question this is a beer. A nice springtime beer. Had it at the Blue Cat Resturant in Burlington Vermont. Had it again at Blue Cat it's just as good as my previous review. Hard to find in the bottle."
"Not a sexy looking beer but drinks pretty fine, especially for such a lackluster style."
"Overall, the flavor is nice, but just too sweet. If I came in with different expectations, I'd rate this more highly, but compared to other beers of this style, it just doesn't measure up for me."
"Solid brew, a welcomed change up for summer drinking, especially if you like Hefes or other wheat beers like I do."
"D: I wish it hadn’t taken my so long into the summer to find this beer. Well balanced . Easy drinking for a summer afternoon or evening. Definitely pairs well with lighter foods such as salads and grilled corn"
"The appearance of this beer is misleading. Pours a goldenrod/orange yellow with no head to speak of. Lots of carbonation clinging to the outside of the glass. Smells of fresh baked bread and that's about it. Taking the first sip is indeed surprising, tastes of brown sugar, nutmeg and honey. Very little in the way of hops but slightly malty. Overall a surprising beer; glad I gave it a try!"
"O-Very enjoyable. A nice twist on a wheat beer that adds a little extra flavor while still maintaining a pretty low profile and extremely easy to drink."
"When served from the tap the beer had about a finger tall white head and poured from a bottle it has about half that."
"Pours a beautiful golden color, very summer-y. The aroma is delicious: honey and cinnamon dominate this spicy, flowery scent. Reminds me of Cinnamon Toast Crunch or Golden Grahams...yum. And taste leaves nothing to be desired: it's sweet, with a bit of a hops bite and a strong honey flavor. Combined with a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel, this beer is almost like candy; liquid alcoholic candy. This is a beautifully balanced beer, perfect for a summer afternoon. A very pleasant surprise for someone with low expectations for wheat beers."
"This is a very agreeable beer with a charming lightness to it. All of the action of this beer takes place within your first few seconds of ingesting it, and disappears before you even swallow. At the outset, the drinker is met with a crisp punch of sweet honey which rapidly dissipates to a neutral wheat taste. All around pleasant and inoffensive."
"Pours a one finger white head that fades quickly, leaving traces of lace. Cloudy, pale amber color, yeast settles in glass. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Lemon nose and flavor is first lemon then honey. Good hot weather ale. $1.60 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a tart/citrus scent along with a basic pale and wheat malt aroma. The taste is average. It has a sweet and sour citrus feel with a basic pale and wheat malt flavor. It's muddled together and not very good. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is a forgettable summer seasonal. I'm not sure what the intention was, but they may want to rethink the recipe."
"o-very enjoyable. dont know if it is something i can drink more than 1 or 2 of in a sitting, but for a hot summer day after working outdoors this beer hits the spot wonderfully."
"O- An extremely unique beer in my opinion. Its strong aroma really took me by surprise, and overall the beer's backbone is it's floral/honey notes, and if you're into that, it's definitely worth a try."
"Honey and wheat pretty much sums up what most people envision in a spring seasonal ... most. Sweet honey edge with some bready notes and a very fine camomile tea fill the nose. Had to take a sip to remind ourselves that this is a beer. Honey and wheat fit over taking the credit for the smoothness. Palate is semidry with up front camomile tea-like flavors; honey flavor diminishes quickly, though the breadiness form the malt pushes forward. Hops are very light, but everything is in bal- ance. For a delicate, dainty beer, it comes off as being drinkable, and the addition of camomile makes this beer EXTREME!"
"On tap at Iron Monkey in Jersey City. Serves in a pint glass. The beer has an initial honey aroma that is supported by its taste. It's light in color and slightly hazy as most wheat beers are. This, however, was less hoppy than I was expecting from an American wheat. It was very light in feel but had a nice honey and fruit flavor. The wheat taste didn't come through as much as I would like but the taste overall was very pleasant."
"Overall a tasty and interesting wheat ale."
"Iam not into wheat ales very much unless they are the uber hopped variety,but this one was full of flavor and complexity and was damn good!Poured into a becker a hazed pumpkin infused golden with a large fluffy white head atop.Toasty wheat,chamomole,and pumpkin-like cardamom spice in the nose,it seems almost like a pumpkin wheat ale?Again caramom spice and toasty wheat on the palate,the chamomile and honey is prevelent in the finish.Honey and spice to mix with toasted wheat malt,a great combination,Iam not sure if there is cardamom in it but its gives off the warming spice.I loved it."
"Sampled on May 19, 2011. This poured honey-amber with a quick head and slightly cloudy. The honey is noted in the aroma along with thinner wheat. The body has the sort of greasy texture of honey but not as heavy. The honey is in the taste but at the same time abstract with a slightly sharp hop finale. This seems like a very nice warm weather beer."
"Pours a hazy amber/orange with no head and reasonable lacing. Aroma is light, mostly of yeast, grassy, and some lemon peel. Mouthfeel is is light, with little carbonation. Taste is yeasty, some grassiness, some spices, and a little lemon peel. I'm not a fan of wheat beers, but this is more decent than others. It is a bit yeasty and bready for my taste."
"Notes: I see this being a very good hot weather beer/ middle of the day beer with a light lunch. Overall, I really like it."
"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 041811 (I think). Pours a cloudy, bright burnt orange color with a 1/2 inch of head. Very little retention. Aroma is floral, grainy and bready. Flavor is mostly grains with a nice hint of honey to it. A bit floral with some sweetness that doesn't come from the honey. Maybe brown sugar and cinnamon. The mix of the honey with this one works really well and kind of surprised me how tasty it made it. Wheat beers are hit or miss in my experience, but this is a good one. Overall, I really liked this one and would consider buying a 6 pack of it."
"Overall another organic offering from Wolaver but kind of lackluster. If anything it could use more body."
"Overall this seems pretty appropriate for the style - light enough but not too sweet. Bright and clean. Good summer drinker, but wasn't overly impressed by the interpretation...then again I've had Gumballhead and Lil' Sumpin Sumpin."
"O: probably a beer I would skip over in the future."
" This brew will do well on a very hot day when you need some added refreshment."
"Overall, a highly recommended beer. Drinkability is good since the sweetness is not cloying and the beer is interesting enough to have multiple pints of. Why do you think I bought a growler?"
"O: The beer is very easy to drink, quite refreshing and very flavorful. I would definitely try this one again."
"A highly sessionable brew. This is a brew that I would seek out - especially would be great for summer days by the pool..."
"The motuhfeel is very nice. The body is appropriately light, about medium in strength, with a big crispness that never fades but gives way, with ample but not overdone carbonation, to a nice, smooth finish with plenty of character."
"Taste-Wheat, fresh honey, sweet biscuit. Creamy and refreshing but hard to escape the lingering sweetness that's there from start to finish. A dose of spicy or citrus hops to balance things out a bit would have worked wonders in my opinion. But that being said, it's still a decent brew to try."
"Wow, pleasantly surprised with this one. I had a pint at Volpe's in Emmaus, PA. Yes, you can taste the honey and chamomile (I'm not usually a fan of chamomile) but they're expertly balanced off the clean, crisp and distinct bready wheat malts. Typically I'd expect the spice or honey to dominate and define the beer, but really this is a complex American wheat that doesn't need to rely on massive hops flavor. Heck of a beer for the style, and just plain tasty overall. Check this out."
"Pours a small half finger head that only hangs in there for a little bit, kinda disappointing there. The head is pure white and the body is orange, golden looking. It looks like a wheat beer should look, it's very cloudy and there is some sediment in the beer. It looks good despite the wimpy head. Well for starters on the smell you for sure get that flower smell, which smells really good, and then the honey and a vanilla smell, which both smell really good as well. The only thing that is a little off with the smell is the generic beer smell that I'm getting, which I don't like, but the beer still smells really good as a whole. Oh man, this beer is so f-ing tasty, wow. You first just get punched in the mouth with that honey flavor, then comes a little vanilla and that flower taste to polish it off. On some tastes I notice different things first, that's how well mixed in everything is. Not much in the way of hops or malts but who cares? Amazing taste, the generic beer taste is very small, if even there at all. Mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking of a wheat beer, but it's not the worst I've ever had, it's still got some back bone to it. Overall, the taste makes this a damn good beer, there are factors that are weak, and if they were better, this might be a perfect beer in my opinion. But as it stands now, damn good beer."
"The color is quite nice, with a nice head. Overall, pour me another, I'm ready to drink!"
"Pours a golden yellow/orange with a thin white head. Not much retention,but decent laceing. Aroma is floral with wheat and honey.Body is light to medium with a good amount of carbonation.Taste is of sweet fruit, honey, and wheat.Spicy and creamy throghout with a bit of tart in the finish. Really good!"
"This beer is full of flavor and differs from other Wolaver's offerings because you can actually taste it. It's certainly worth a try."
