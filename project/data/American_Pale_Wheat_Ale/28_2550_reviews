"Pours a clear pale gold producing almost 3 fingers of white, foamy, somewhat lasting head that leaves a streaky, webby wash of lace. Aroma is wheat, butter, lemon & orange. Taste is thin lemon, orange, mildly wheat bready, a hint of floral/herbal hops with a tiny bit of pepper & bitterness in the finish. Aftertaste is citric & slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is light bodied with with moderate carbonation, crisp but not clean leaving a phenolic presence on the tongue."

""
"This is a nice refreshing summer beer. Very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is sooth with an overwhelming drinkability.  lightly carbonated and pours with a small head.  this is a must try if Anchor products are available in your neighborhood."

"Golden color with a light crisp body. Smells of citrus, lemon and wheat prep you for, eh, not much. There's not much going on with this beer. A good summer session beer that could be quite refreshing on a hot day, but I could think of better options."

"A real disappointment from Anchor here, particularly given the reputation of the brewery and my past experiences with them with this one being forgettable in almost ever area, not to mention boring and bland as well. Both the taste and smell seemed far to weak and featured too much skunk to make them enjoyable, that couple with the relatively poor mouthfeel makes this a beer I can't recommend at all."

"Rating: C-"

"Tastes more like a lager"

"O: Pretty good beer for a wheat. I do not like wheat beer. This is fairly nice and probably my favorite one but that's not saying much. Won't buy again but glad I tried it."
"It has the medium full body and mouthfeel of a good wheat beer with above average carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  What a terrific wheat beer!  And I usually don’t like wheat beers, but this one is really terrific.  I really love the strong flavors of toasted malt and wheat, balanced well with some subtle sweetness, spicing and hops.  Highly recommended."

"On tap & from bottle. From the tap this hits the nose with a bit of funk which is quickly dispelled once it hits the tongue. The rich looking head quickly dissipated leaving an intriguing lacing pattern until about half way down the glass. The body is the most noticeable trait thus far. Unlike most ""summer"" brews there is a lack of the crisp & citrus character so ubiquitous this time of year. That should not be misconstrued as something bad, it can, when all is said & done, be a distinction...as long as it has a purpose...& in this case it seems to. Anchor Steam, in my mind, has always had a character that I can best be describe as ""a fistful of flavor"". The heartiness of which is not lost in this venture to the lighter, brighter side. As a New Yorker whose summers are a series of intermittent hot days inter-dispersed with VERY hot days, this would be great on the merely hot days. Synchronize with a mid-Californian moderate clime. Bottom line is grab some, if it's warm, but spare it, if it's HOT & humid, but, if you like robust beer, no matter what, keep it on the list. Now on to the bottled effort. The head was nowhere to be seen but the lacing showed up. virtually other aspects corresponded."

"O: A better history lesson than an actual beer. All it has going for it is drinkability - and even then, there are other wheat beers I'd much rather drink. Without a doubt, this is my least favorite brew from Anchor."

"O: A nice taste of history, marking how far American craft brewing has come. So much like an AA Lager, with a few tweaks that a novice wouldn’t pick up on, yet this was supposedly the first American wheat ale in the modern era. Got at Trader Joe’s Ashville."
""
""

"I'm definitely a fan of this beer. It's not a heavy-duty beer, but is definitely yummy. Perhaps it's that I'm a fan of San Fran/California.. perhaps not. I do like the taste, as it is crisp and light without being bland. This is the second time I've purchased a single bottle of this lovely beer, and I wouldn't hesitate to pick up a six-pack next time. ;)"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 4/1/2014. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight grassy/earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a nice pale wheat ale. Good robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"I guess you could say that a lot of American craft breweries muck up their pale wheat ales with fruit peels, chalky spices, and a big musty yeast; this is a minimalist wheat ale, at its finest. It doesn't really hold up, on its own, but I don't think the brewer's at Anchor care too much about that kind of opinion. It could only possibly be American in style, as it seems they're giving Germany and Belgium a great big middle finger from way, way, way across the pond. Nevertheless, it's not going to knock your socks off. But, if you like a summer beer sixer that you don't want to stop and think about too much, this is right as rain for you."

"This is actually a light APA with some wheat that further smooths the brew. Very refreshing and extremely drinkable. It fits well its purpose."
""
""
"A sneaky but fresh grassy floral hoppy feel balanced well by a fairly strong yeast and nice malty backbone. It all comes together pretty well in a refreshing, balanced brew."
"This beer came packaged in an Anchor Brewing Company sampler case (including their Steam, Porter, and Liberty Ale) and is labeled as their wheat beer with James Stitt's original label art on the bottle. The beer itself is very refreshing and flavorful and is a nice surprise to me. There is definitely a nice mix of wheat and barley malts which provide a smooth, slightly sweet character to the beer. The yeast does a nice job of complementing the malts by providing a great fruity aroma and flavor enhancement. I'll have to keep this one in mind for the upcoming hot summer days..."

"Although American pale wheat ales do not represent my favorite beer style, I am a fan of Anchor and this one was hard to pass up on when I spied it on a pick six craft beer wall. Pours up nicely, a mountain of off-white thick foam on top of a golden yellow base, beer does look a bit like darkish honey (or less pleasantly, concentrated urine. But hey). Very clean spicy wheat and ""old world"" earthy/leafy hop aroma, brisk and assertive. Carbonation was right where it should be for the style, moderate to quite fizzy, and I was struck by the smoothness on the palate, almost creamy. Palate features very pleasant lemon-lime, apricot, and green apple characters than are subtle enough but add complexity. Nice smooth bitterness with white pepper-type spice notes in the finish. This beer includes the underutilized Glacier hop and perhaps this is the source of the fruity character along with the wheat malt. Minimal pine flavor, the hops are more grassy, earthy and refined. Dry and crisp overall with some sour fruit character and the unvarnished clean flavors remind me a bit of a good pilsener. I am perplexed by the mediocre ratings this beer garners on this website. Perhaps people were looking for more aggressive flavors. It is not supposed to taste like a hefeweizen or a wheat IPA. I think this brew is right where it needs to be in terms of the wheat and hops balance. Refreshing and well-executed."

"Draught @ Headkeeper: This one pours a crystal clear, lighter golden color. There was a very small white head on it and minimal lacing. The aroma is OK. Earthy hops, some malts, some citrus. The taste is OK also. Some spice, wheat, citrus, earthy hops. A good summer beer."

"Purchased in a bottle from a supermarket in Knoxville, Tennesse. Poured into a pint glass of course. Very light beer. No heavy smell and no aftertaste. Nice golden color, with very little carbonation. Very good blonde. Not a strong beer, so a good choice with heavy meals, i.e. Pizza, pasta, etc. - will try again."

"O-pretty one dimensional wheat beer"

""
"Overall: Again, a lot of people aren't going to like this because it lacks the flavors that most expect from the typical summer ale. I like the hops in this one, and I think there's just enough of them to balance the wheat and that the flavors of grass and bread are great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly above average wheat ale, not bad but there are plenty of better offerings out there."
""
""
""
""
"O: I had a feeling this beer was going to exceed my expectations and it did. Has the balance between the wheat and the adjuncts, the sweetness and tartness. Great brew that embodies summer."
""
""
""
"O - Nice flavors, great mouthfeel. Nothing exceptional here to be sure, but an easy-drinker that I enjoyed very much on a gorgeous summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Definitely the least enjoyable Anchor brew I've tried so far. The first 3 were all outstanding, but this one just doesn't quite do it for me. Run-of-the-mill summer patio sipper with a craft twist on it. But at the end of the day, average."

"picked up a single anchor summer outta the cold box because the sixer i was buying was warm and i needed something to break the spell of baltimore's summer sun. i'm pleased i don't have five more of these to imbibe because one is quite enough. the shape of the bottle and the design of the label are superior to the beverage contained within, i'm afraid."

"Bottle poured into pint glass. Poured a light golden color, pretty clear, small white head that didn't stay long. Smells of lemon, grain, light citrus. Taste of grassy hops, some citrus, wheat, light malty background. Mouthfeel was lighter side, but still well balanced. Overall, it really was just okay, but is an easy drinker and can see how this can be enjoyed during the hot summer weather."
"I am surprised by ""Okay"" ranking for this one. For a light, low-alcohol wheat ale, this is quite a flavorful and unique flavor profile. It is true a lot of breweries have made some excellent wheat beers since this one was first brewed in 1984, this one is still quite competitive in this category. Ideal for summer."

"Refreshing, but in a characterless macro lager kinda way. Doesn't go for weizen character but doesn't load up on US hops either. And not as creamy as I'd expect for a wheat beer. This style can be done so much better."

"355ml bottle bb3/2015. Poured with immense head, which subsided to thin omnipresent head. Citric hops and a 'soft' taste. This beer did not taste 'prickly' in the mouth, unusual in my recent tastings. Well-crafted beer. Bought from Connollys B91 England."

"A refreshing beer on a summer day leading up to our bbq. Pour well into a weizen glass and developed a lot of head with a good yellow-orange color coming through. Smelled crisp with hints of citrus, tasted clean with a smooth finish. Will definitely be having another."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Sessionable. Refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Tastes like a good Belgian wheat that's been watered down a little. Nice lemony/citrus bite, would be very refreshing after mowing the lawn. Slightly above average, not to be turned down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Judging by the sweat after my run tonight, it's definitely Summer now. This stuff pours a clear brass topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises light lemon peel, light wheat, light sweet flowers, and a hint of what may or may not be coriander. The taste brings in more of the same, but ups the lemon to a point where it's the clear star, making for a fruity breeze of a drink. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a nice little hot-weather quaff, nothing special, but something easily drinkable."

"O - Many other summer beers beat this one. Flavor was not right for me."
""
""
"very clear yellow-amber look, small white fluffy head. smell is dry grain/wheat, with some lemon-pepper. taste is light, fluffy, airy wheat, with a lemony kick of hops. feel is light, finish of lingering bitterness."
"Overall Drinkability: Not a great beer. None of the fruity/yeasty wheat qualities I like. I would drink this again, but would not go out of my way."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty average tasting beer to me, nothing about it really stood out. It is pretty drinkable, had to try it when it came to bottle shop. Tasted almost amberish to me. The bottle describes it as being very crisp, but I didn't get that experience. Maybe had it been on tap..."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's on the more bitter side for a summer beer, tends towards a German pils bitter taste."
"Overall a good summer beer with a distinct Anchor Brewing flavor profile. I never did taste or smell the wheat aspect which is fine by me. Not a big fan of wheat beers in general."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Damn fine session beer. Great intro to craft beers for Bud-light lovers. Bring this one to the beach or the barbeque. A great warm-up beer before the big guns come out."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a rather simple beer. This comes across as a microbrewers answer to a light American lager. It has a mildly grainy taste and a very light body. The wheat is there but it's solo with nothing to support it. This isn't a beer I'l buy again."
""
""
"I'm kind of surprised at the average reviews this beer is getting. For me, this is almost exactly what I want in a summer beer. Clean, crisp, refreshing, but not lacking in complexity or general taste. The wheat flavor is great - just the right amount. The finish might be slightly dry, but overall I'm glad to add this to my summer arsenal."
"Overall: a decently refreshing beer, if not a perfect one. The floral/perfumey character of the flavor just doesn't suit me, at least not in the intensity evident here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of my favorite readily available summer session ales. There are definitely better, more flavorful versions but much pricier and harder to track down. Nothing revolutionary just very balanced and drinkable."
""
""
"Overall – An OK summer style ale. While not tons of flavor it is a good for sessions with pals over a long summer night as it is light and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A refreshing wheat beer by Anchor. Clean flavours with some pleasant toasted characteristics. A crisp and simple brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not much of a discernible aroma in the least. There’s a slight bitterness veering into tartness, like a light Berliner-weiss tang. Not a heavy hefe/wheat beer. Refreshing, crisp, smooth, effervescent, with a clear flavor that cuts through a meal. Refreshing and perfectly suited for summertime."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not an exciting summer beer, and not nearly as good as the reliable Anchor Steam. But it will hit the spot on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-aroma and appearance are really nice but just seems to be lacking everywhere else. Even for a lighter style it doesn't seem to have enough structure"
""
"Mouthfeel is nice and refreshing- light body, moderately carbonated, a little resin from the hops. I would recommend this summer beer over all others from mainstream breweries."
""
""
""
"O: Certainly one of the easier drinking summer beers, nice and light with enough flavor to make you want to keep drinking. Nothing off-putting and a solid choice for a refreshing beer"
""
"Pours a golden-straw color with a half-finger of fizzy head that dissipated quickly. The nose is akin to that of an American adjunct lager - not a good start. The taste is fairly light with a crisp, dry finish. Quaffable, but nothing special in the least."
""
""
"Overall, this beer is fine. It's good for the summer. There's just not much to it, honestly. I'm not offended by it, but eh."
""
""
""
""
""
"From the bottle marked 2AQ. Sampled on July 12, 2012. The color is an excellent looking pale to golden yellow with a long-lasting softish white head. The aroma is subtle all around with field wheat, grains, bread, and a cleanliness. The body is light to medium. The taste has a slightly more bitter character to it than other summers and little in the way of citrus. Also there is a short lingering finish. Very easy to drink to boot."
""
"O-While cold, the beer is decent, however as it begins to warm even slightly, it goes down hill."
""
""
"O: This beer is refreshing, enjoyable, and easy to drink. This beer is very sessionable and would be enjoyable on a hot summer evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I dig the lemon-y flavors here. A good distraction, worthy of trying at least once."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A decent summer brew. Not a personal favorite, but nothing I'd turn down if offered."
"Overall, I don't really like wheat beers in general, but do enjoy them occasionally in the Summer months. However, this was a major disappointment, but it might be due to the more hoppier versions I have become used to."
"Notes: A nice job for a summer ale. The summer ale market is big, so this is not king, just a good contender."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a favorite style. This is the weakest beer I've had from this beloved brewery. Still, it is good for style, well crafted, very drinkable, and rather refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to light in body with a grainy aftertaste a mild bitterness, mostly a little sweetness and a decent malt character. Not a great beer but drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very enjoyable and refreshing. I am not usually a wheat beer drinker, but this one is very good. I like that this beer is not the traditional unfiltered, heavy wheat beer to I come to expect. Indeed this is a great summer beer and one that I would try again."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was just an average wheat ale. Nothing stood out to put this one above the rest, but it is certainly drinkable."
"O: Very enjoyable summer beer, everything balances well and all of the flavors and light and crisp. Great job by the Anchor brewers."
"The taste is also very simple. There is some grain, a little grassiness, and a light mineral taste. I felt that it was very drinkable, but there wasn't much there. Not bad, just no lasting effect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent if unspectacular wheat ale. It's pretty refreshing but I don't really care for a overly dry finish."
"Pretty refreshing and easy drinking and decent tasting. I dig it."
""
"The body is nice and light with somewhat soft carbonation. Overall an enjoyable beer. I can see myself grabbing this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good lacing, decent head, over golden carbonated beer. Smells OK. Malts predominate, slightly metallic scent sneaks in. Tastes like a macro beer, they really missed the mark. Watery, metallic, artificial. Light enough that you could have several if you were so inclined. I am not."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty nice and refreshing summer wheat beer. Nice zesty citrus flavors going on."
"Another grest"
""
"nothing earth shattering here, but a pretty nice brew for the hot months. smells like grassy hops, light tea crackery malt palate, and perhaps a touch of citrus zest. flavor is very well balanced, with more malt features than hop features. its got a sort of german or czech pils malt profile, which is bigger than a lot of summer seasonals. floral blooming polleny grassy hops are very crisp and seasonally appropriate o the tail end of this beer. feel is good, not too light on the body, but very very easy drinking. refreshingly robust carbonation and a quick finish. this is a nice outside slammer for the summer, and a lot less boring than many of its contemporaries."
"The mouthfeel is wonderfully bubbly, though the beer gets a little bitter when it warms. Have this one cold."
""
""
"T: Very light and pretty refreshing. Lots of wheat and pale malt throughout with a bit of lemon and honey sweetness. The biggest problem for me was a lot of bready malt towards the finish that got stronger and more overpowering as the beer warmed."
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Not much to look at but has a solid nose combo of grains, fruit, and spice. Flavor is full, fermented grains, with a little citrus, and spice. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
"If I didn't know what style this was I would have guessed it to be some sort of light lager. Not a bad beer, but bit of a let down for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light orange amber with a thin white head that dissipates rapidly leaving light lacing. Aroma of sweet malt and citrus. Taste is light caramel malt, light citrus and understated wheat. Light and refreshing, but otherwise unremarkable."
""
""
"O: Just a so so wheat beer – pretty forgettable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I would imagine if I had tried this in the summer in the heat, I might have liked it more. If I can find it again this summer, I will give it another shot as I am a fan of Anchor brews, but in the winter, it just did not cut it...."

"D: Session, session, session. I may have gotten into this one a little late into the season, which may explain some of the flavor and nose dissipation. I wouldn’t mind having a few of these on a really hot summer day. An SF summer day requires a little bit more of a bite though."
"Picked up as part of a mixed six at Wegmans. I love the stubby bottle. The head was super fluffy and looked great. Typical wheat color. The nose was more wheat than usual. Nice lemony flavor (but hold the lemon wedge please). Easy to drink and quite refreshing on a hot summer day."
"O - a very easy drinking brew with a nice combo of pale ale crispness with hearty hefe characteristics, just in time for the end of summer :("
"O: I find this beer to be average. It's a pleasant treat on a hot summer day, but I do not feel that it is all that memorable. I probably wouldn't buy it again, but I'm glad I tried it."
"O: This is a great smooth easy drinking beer. I recommend it."
"O: A very good summer wheat beer, a great beer to kick back with on a warm summer day."
"O: nicely done, but I like a bigger citrusy hop presence in an apwa."
"Overall / Drinkability: Surprisingly quite drinkable for a shallow flavor profile beer. But maybe that's why it works. It's not trying too hard to wow you, it's not amazing: it's just very drinkable. Washes food down quiet well (I think this would be great with seafood) and went well with a BLT for an unofficial end of summer beer on labor day. I think it would definitely would be refreshing on a hot day as well."
"RJT"
"OK brew. Hazy golden color with a small white head. Light and citrusy, with about as much flavor as the steam coming off an anchor (not much). It is a good summer beer for when you are taking a summer vacation...from taste. Wheaty and mildly malty with some lemon notes. Light on the mouthfeel. Drinkable at least, easy to pound or funnel. Marginal showing from a decent brewery."
"Beer poured with a large, frothy head and dark-like gold color. Aromas were slightly strong with some cloves, malts, and wheat. The taste is really enjoyable and bittersweet. The malt and bready balance leaves a bitter flavor at the end, which is nice and refreshing. Along with a good solid body, the beer is a wonderful wheat ale."
"Overall I think it's very well made, and a great easy drinking summer beer. It could use a little more character, but its subtleties and simplicity are very enjoyable."
"O - Nice Brew. I find it delicious actually! Nice beer to get the night started since its so refreshing. I'll definitely be back for more next summer."
"Overall, it's refreshing enough to be a decent summer, despite the generally below average scores I gave it. I'd have it again."
"This would be suitable for a scorching hot day, but even then, I can think of many beers I would prefer to this. I don't see myself having this one again."
"Had a pint at Batdorf's in Annville. This is a basic, clean American wheat - boring but refreshing. There was a very mild wheat and pale barley taste with no real discernible hops character. It's on the mark for the style, but I wouldn't order this again."
"Not a terrible beer overall, but not great by any means. I wouldn't go back to this one."
"Dr: Low ABV, fair drinkability, and low quality make this a beer to leave be."
"Overall this is a decent beer, but nothing outstanding. I will enjoy the rest of my six pack and I'm not upset that I purchased this brew."
"Overall, this is a good beer, though it seems a little below Anchor's usual standards. For one, the bitter notes seem to grow with subsequent mouthfuls, leaving the tongue tingling and the tastebuds reeling with sour/tart residue. Still, the flavors are crisp and nuanced, and the brew just screams to be quaffed at a hot beach."
"O: One of the most flavorful Summer beers I've had."
"Overall a very good beer. Definitely a summer beer."
"O - For what it is its not that bad pretty much your average American Wheat which is pretty nice and refreshing this time of year worth a try if you like this style"
"Anchor should know that a little more character wouldn't do their Summer Beer any harm. Sure, as is it makes a delightfully refreshing beer that lives up to the brewery's established standards of quality - and is tremendously approachable to even the most casual of beer drinkers - but it's a little too no-frills for me to buy it consistently, if again at all."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a huge 3 inch off-white head that fades to a small cap. Nice foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of biscuit-like malt and some citrus zest. Taste is of sweet malt and some bitter citrus zest hops. Very little lingering bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good summer beer that is pretty refreshing but not one of my favorites from Anchor."
"Overall, really quite bland. Just a slight step up above a generic BMC. Honestly, I'd probably just go with my standby lager."
"o - Overall an ok beer, but kind of bland. Easy to drink but not a lot going on. Wouldn't seek it out again."
"Compared to the cheap stuff, this is all right. This does the job on a hot summer day. But if I were to only have a few beers on a hot summer day, I would choose Bell's oberon, something with more complex flavors."
"Pours from the 22oz. bottle a rather macro-like golden color with a thick, foamy head that settles into a 1/2 finger collar. Quite high carbonation, lots of tiny bubbles rising in the glass. There's a faint aroma of light citrus. 1st sip brings a modest taste of dry, grassy-like malt & some bitter lemon peel. The taste is a little too understated IMHO. It's not bad, it's just that it's a little too weak & faint for my tastes. Mouthfeel is light & crisp with a bit of sparkle from the carbonation. This is pretty refreshing on a 100 degree plus summer day like today, I just wish the flavor packed a bit more of a punch."
"Solid beer."
"O-Not bad. I'd not really seek this out, but it's OK in a very large field of serious contenders."
"Not a brilliant effor; too many off-notes. There was a brief moment in the first minute or two when it seemed pleasant and lightly hopped, but it went downhill from there. Perhaps I let it warm up too much. At any rate, it's not awful but somewhat flawed. Choose something better."
"This brew poured up a cloudy amber colored body with an intense foamy white head with amazing retention and lacing. Aromas of toasted/buttered wheat bread, lemon zest, and a hint of some field grasses. Light- to medium-bodied with a nice lemony/bready flavor (almost like a good tea cake) and a subtly hoppy bite on the finish with is smooth and crisp and definitely not heavy or harsh."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and sharp with some firm carbonation and a light body. The co2 adds a nice soda like bitterness in the finish that is the icing on the cake. Maybe I am biased about this summer beer because it's 105 outside right now but this seems to be a perfect glass of suds. Great beer!"
"Looks nice and smells good, but this seemly promising beer suffers from the strong lemony bitterness in the flavor."
"Pours a clean gold with moderate cap of white soapy froth. Scent is uber pale with a faint kiss of malt sweetness, lemon and bready yeast. Taste brings just a bit more to the experience... still a very light beer with only touches of sweetness, bread and lemon. Lighter side of medium, slightly watery at first but creamy as carbonation escapes and the beer warms. Not quite sure what the goal was, but the beer was too mild and lacking any sort of style."
"D: This is a decent summer beer. You can drink this all day. Not sure if I would necessarily reach for this one first, but would not turn it down!"
"Considering how much I like Anchor Steam, I was quite let down with this beer. Just seemed like a washed out summer offering."
"A good choice to have a packed cooler with a selection from a quality brewer."
"Overall: Pretty good beer overall. I feel like Anchor was going for something light and refreshing for summer and this meets the criteria. I'd consider this to be a step above light beer, which in this case isn't a bad thing. I'd recommend giving this one a shot on a hot day."
"Pours a clear pale yellow in a glass with a nice frothy white head. Aromas of wheat, lemon and maybe a hint of banana. Lemon and wheat on the palate with a crisp finish. Light body with a really nice tightly wound frothy carbonation. A solid beer from Anchor."
"O: As good as some Anchor beers can be, they have some pretty bad ones."
"Overall: solid summer offering from Anchor. Its simple and understated, which is good considering the purpose of this beer and its one of the better light wheat ales I've had. Cheers."
"Mouthfeel is light and clean. A very dry finish leaves me wanting more. This is at a session-able ABV of 4.6%, so more is a good thing."
"Medium bodied but on the lighter end with zesty spice, earthy, floral hops and sweet malt notes. Again, I'm not pickig up much wheat beer character. Light and watery with some grassy hops up front followed by some peppery spice and sweet malt notes. Hits of caramel, toffee and biscuit. Bland but pretty easy to drink. I like their porter and steam beer but this was a disappointment."
"Overall, its an easy beer to drink, and its decent. Just nothing overly exciting about it."
"The feel is nice and crisp, certainly refreshing for a Cali summer. Behind the bite is a silky feel that's so smooth going down. It's definitely a summer beer with some character, that sets it apart from it's sometimes boring competitors."
"Poured into a weizen glass. The head is copious at first, but quickly dissipates into a white ring atop the beer. The beer itself is yellow, with orange hues. Not much smell; a few grainy notes detected. The taste itself is grainy, crisp, and dry, with a subtle citrus presence. Easy and pleasant to drink. I think this beer certainly achieves Anchor's goal of making a light, drinkable summer brew, which is why I gave it a solid overall score, even if I'll probably be bored with it by the time I finish the six pack. I enjoy it, but I won't be rushing to have it again, especially at the $12/six pack price point where I live."
"Light golden in color, slightly hazy with no head retention. Light wheat and Pilsner malts dominate the nose. The hop character is grassy and lightly flowery. Crisp, pale malt taste with the same hop character carrying over from the nose. Floral and grassy backed by some of the Pilsner and wheat. Light and drinkable but nothing to fantastic in the flavor department."
"Cheers!!"
"I don't know what is going on with Anchor but I'm surprised they don't make better beers, given their historic status in the better beer movement."
"O- a good summer brew but not one i would seek out...i would however drink/try it again"
"Overall it's a beer I would like to try more than one of. Great summer brew."
"O: I have a bit of a soft spot for this beer, but it's still a tasty summer. I'd drink it on a hot day and enjoy it."
"Sort of a weenie wheat beer, which might be an unfair thing to say about a beer that's only 50% wheat, but still... it's a weenie wheat beer. Decent copper color with some nice sparkle; not much of a head; zipless body and something of a dry, corny taste that the malty edge just couldn't push aside. Dang. Anchor makes such terrific porter and their steam beer is decent. What happened here?"
"Way back when (mid-90's) I drank lots of Anchor products. Now I rarely pick them up. This one was part of a mixed six pack, after I couldn't find a sixth beer I wanted. Poured a light golden color with a fluffy white head. Aromas of wheat, straw and light malt. On the palate, this one was light bodied and drinkable, with sweet malt and just the barest suggestion of hops."
"Overall, nothing worth checking out."
"O: Enjoyable summer beer. It's easy to drink, light and crisp. Should compliment all the summer foods this season has to offer."
"Overall: This is really one of those summer beers that could be drank all day -- the bitterness is refreshing, and the malted wheat provides enough of an earthy sweetness that keeps it balanced. Moderately low ABV would allow for copious amounts to be consumed with little to no worry."
"Hadn't had this for a while and forgot how good it was. Bought this as a single bottle but will definitely pick up more of this; a beer like this could become a regular for me during a long hot Carolina summer. Recommended."
"Overall: This is probably the best ""American Hefeweizen"" I have had. That doesn't make it the best American Wheat Ale I have had (as it is broad style that includes diverse beers such as Lagunitas Little Sumpin Sumpin, Bell's Oberon, and Big Sky Trout Slayer), but in terms of the old fashioned American Wheat that are simply Hefeweizens without the German yeast, this is pretty damn good. Most are overly sweet or bland, but this is dry and spicy as hell. Glad I finally tried this, as I put it off as I did not expect much."
"I love Anchor, but this is pretty bland and ho hum. Not something I would recommend."
"Huge frothy head rises out of the glass. Pale translucent golden. Aromas are tart citrus and wheat, with a bit of something ""baked"". Upon first sip, the first thing I notice is the super high carbonation and overall crispness of the beer. Flavors are mildly buttery malt and wheat/grass. Thin mouthfeel, with lots of residuals behind."
"And this is no exception. Very bright flavor profile, with a very nice touch of tartness to the wheat up front. Middle is moderately soft, with some faint wheat grain notes at the finish. Quite nice."
"Pours golden into my Bear Republic glass. A good sign of carbonation when the little bubbles are floating to the top. A very subdue smelling and tasting beer with notes of faint hops rising through. This is my first summer themed beer and I'm sure it won't be my last with summer starting for me wednesday afternoon. This would be a good pool side beer."
"O: Very drinkable. Has some malt and hop character that's nicely balanced. Citrus and carbonation in building finish is very refreshing."
"O- This was a very nice drinking summertime beer. I really liked the way the beer just was refreshing. Alcohol was really no problem at all which could be a bad thing. A nice drinker from Anchor and I will be looking for this one during these warming months."
"Pours clear orange in body with white bubbly head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma of light cereal, subtle wheat, subtle citrus. Refreshing flavor of light cereal grain, wheat, cornflakes, subtle citrus, dry and clean in the finish. Light body with light carbonation. A clean, palate and thirst quenching brew. Pretty flawless."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and would be particularly refreshing on a hot summer day."
"The mouthfeel is light-bodied and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is very good. A good summer thirst quencher that I'll like to have around during these hot Florida days."
"I dunno, I just don't much care for this beer. Not what I want from a APWA."
"Overall, not a bad interpretation of a wheat beer. For an American wheat beer. Not great though. I was really expecting more from this one & am left wanting more. Normally Anchor hits the mark on their beers but this one missed for me. I would love to smell & taste more of that banana & clove that is so very custom to this style. As always, beer is good!! Prosit!"
"I probably wouldn't buy it again, not much to write home about but it is pretty good."
"The pour was nicely done. Rich golden amber in color with a huge head of white on top. Light cloudiness to it as well really capped it off quite nicely. Nice lacing down the sides fits the style perfectly. Aroma is hoppy, lights of lemon and light grassy notes abound here. Floral would be the optimal word though it did tend to stray off the path a touch and land itself in the lemon category a bit too much. Crisp, and very clean on the palate, much more refreshing and light then I thought it would be and that was a wonderful thing to behold. Rich notes of lemon and light grass, hints of wheat on the tongue and a nice hit of peach and pear on the finish,. Very dry finish as well with a light spicy note gracing the tongue."
"This beer pours a clear light golden color with a little but of head that retains a little. The aroma is malty and somewhat floral. The taste also has floral notes and a good amount of caramel. The mouthfeel is nicely balanced but average. Overall a crisp summer beer."
"Taste is an explosion of citrus hops, balanced with a strong malty presence and a tinge of bitterness. Refreshing, light, and flavorful."
"DRinkablity- a very nice and drinkable beer, i really love the way this beer way walks line between a different styles, a very drinkable beer that certainly would make a very nice light and flavorful summertime beer choice"
"O - overall, this beer is what I expected and what I hoped for. It lives up to what is says it is. Great for a hot summer day."
"As summer ales go, this ones hit all the key components: a wheaty body that anchors flavor and body, an acidic balance of tart esters and sulfurs, and a grassy hop crispness that finish the beer. Keep it low in gravity for an effortless beverage to drink and we have a beer that's prime for the season. We have Anchor Summer Ale so bring on the heat!"
"O- I am biased because IPA's are my favorite, but this beer was not even enjoyable for me. Craving an IPA now because this is far too light and thin."
"O - This is a new summer go-to. Crisp, refreshing, light, but still tasty. It's what BMC should be. Some folks knock this style, but it's legit to me and serves its purpose. This offering from Anchor hits the mark perfectly (based on its description on this label). I'll have another, please!"
"O - A solid offering, as Anchor offerings almost always are."
"Wasn't overly thrilled by this brew from Anchor. The beer poured out as a straw yellow with a big white head on it. The aromas of fresh grains were bursting out of this one. The hops weren't there or hidden by something else I suppose. The flavor was very light on this brew. I really thought Anchor would have done something to kick this up a notch. I felt that the mouthfeel was good for a summer brew but the flavors just weren't overly exciting."
"Smooth mouthfeel. This is different from other pale wheat ales but in a good way. Very drinkable."
"D - Not something I would normally pick up but as one of six mystery beers I got this first one tastes pretty darn good. Great beer."
"Overall I wasn't impressed by this one it was reminiscent of a weizen o a pilsner..."
"Anyway, not a bad brew. Head is similar to a light lager. Smell is yeasty and malty. Taste is light, but pretty toasty with a bit of hops right before an easy finish. Low alcohol appropriate to its name."
"Drinkability - I am not a fan of the style but Anchor's version has been around for a long time and this is not too bad."
"D-this is tough, not close to what i was expecting from a wheat beer, interesting and unique but in some weird ways"
"This is ""Summer Wheat Ale"" done right, high regards for this seasonal, and it is a session beer to boot!!"
"I bought a sixpack of this while vacationing at the beach last week. I'm not a big summer beer fan but it was summer and I was on the beach so what the hell. It was ok, not great. Cloudy and light in color with a wheaty aroma. Flavor was light but pretty good. I certainly didn't spill any out but I won't be ordering or buying it anytime again soon."
"If you're looking for a Summer session beer, then look no further. I couldn't feel the alcohol in this and I imagine that it would be easy to down more than one if I wished to. If for nothing else, enjoy this for a copious head and subtle, easygoing nature of this beer. There isn't another Summer offering quite like this."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow with a big, fluffy white head that faded slowly with nice ring lacing. The aroma is moderately grainy, with a lot of the wheat malt showing up, but overall not a lot on the nose. The front end is very thin, with hardly anything going on. A decent amount of carbonation in the middle and then a very fast finish that's slightly drying. Body is very thin, drinkability is Ok, but there's not very much to this beer. Quite disappointing coming from Anchor. I love a nice clean refreshing summer beer, but that doesn't it should taste like tonic water."
"Feel, as you would expect is crisp and refreshing. Has good crackle, but the carbonation isn't overbearing. Good thirst quencher/lawnmower beer. I could drink a few at a tailgate or BBQ."
"D: An extremely refreshing summer beer, and an excellent example of your standard American Wheat beer."
"Anchor Summer has a faded John Deere yellow color and a one finger white head. It looks just like what I expect a summer beer should look like. It has a heavier nose than I would have expected. The slightest hint of lemon tickles my nose. The citrus comes out in the first sip leaving some coriander on the tongue. There is some grainy wheat on the finish that lingers. I wish it had a little more UMPH! on the flavor. This is still one of the better summer beer out there."
"To be honest, I'd probably go for an Anchor Steam or a Liberty Ale if I had the choice -- they share many of the same attributes but with a bolder flavor -- but this is still a pretty nice beer if you're looking for something a bit lighter."
"Too dry to be refreshing. Lack of pleasant flavor and composed of almost entirely bitterness, if you can imagine that as a taste. The phenols are way too harsh. Maybe a bad bottle, but the bottle I had was not good."
"New to BC , this is a very typical American Wheat that doesn't pretend to be a Hefe or a Wit. Clean crisp and well made this beer is much like a lager in taste and nose. I added a slice of lime and really like that a Summer patio beer. Not a breakthrough beer like most of the other Anchor offerings but a simple thirst quencher with no pretensions otherwise"
"D: Low ABV is good, but I was surprised by this beer... Not full of citrus and crisp. This one has a little more too it that most Summer Beers, give this one a try."
"This is one of my favorite brewers and Pale Wheats have their place but this just misses the mark. There are at least half a dozen easily available versions that are markedly more enjoyable."
"D- It's a refreshing ale for sure, drinks like a lager a bit I guess. No problem putting a couple of these down in the summer heat."
"D - It's drinkable for the summer but for me it would lose every time to a good German hefe."
"Would be good in a session. I could pound a few of these!!!."
"Pours a deep golden with a nice big layer of foam. It dissipates slowly, leaving a moderate amount of lacing. A restrained aroma, with tangy, citrusy notes up front, but less of a malt presence than I had hoped for. Tart, citrusy notes up front again in the taste, but not much maltiness to be found. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but there is a nice, lively level of carbonation. Overall, this seems to be a decent choice for nice, hot summer days, but I think there are better brews of this style to be found out there."
"Pours a clear, gold color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of grain, slight metallic, hint of hop, hint of citrus, and pale malt. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of grain, metallic, hint of hops, hint of citrus, and pale malt. Overall, not that great. Odd metallic notes are off-putting and there is a strong grain presence that is not helpful at all."
"The taste was also mostly benign, but had a bit of grainyness and a slightly funky yeast finish. The body was typical for the style. Drinkability was OK, but with the beer being so bland, why would you bother?"
"A drinkable, if not good, beer. It would certainly be refreshing in the right circumstance but would be a bit underwhelming under any others."
"A summer ale that is all about the undulating fields of wheat, and much less about what the hops can do for you, as they are pretty low-key in this offering. Unfortunately, what the malt has to say just isn't all that interesting, being that it has a leaky diacetyl valve, or something. Not a drinking experience that I care to repeat on this, or any other patio I might stumble into - across, I mean across!"
"D-Surprisingly refreshing on a hot summer day. Had me two."
"this is pretty easy drinking, in fact, VERY easy. nice low ABV and light refreshing taste make this perfect for summer."
"The usual suspects: wheat, lemon, citrus, haze, and little wallop of bitterness. Maybe some coriander in there as well. A decent summer offering, nothing to write home about. Anchor stuff always seems a little pricey."
"A pretty standard wheat. Well made, just nothing out of this world. I'd drink again but wouldn't lay down many bones for one of these."
"Anchor Summer Beer, on tap, pours a light gold in color with a decent head and lace. Aroma is light, just some zested citrus and pale malts. Flavor is quite satisfying and refreshing, wheat and lemon playing key roles in the flavor theater. I was along for the ride and it was certainly worth it. Mouthfeel is light bodied, drinkability rates very high. A summer beer with some character and flavor. Another great one from Anchor."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, buttery.. which is a bit unusual. All in all this is an ok beer, not something I'd seek out again."
"Drinkability - Quite easy to quaff this down. Doesn't overload the senses and is a good summer beer. I honestly prefer SA's Summer to this and in the future will pick that up over this, but good to try."
"drinkability - smooth, crisp, light, the lingering taste is not awesome but it's fine"
"D - They nailed it with the summer ale as it is the perfect drink to enjoy on a hot summer afternoon. Very sessionable and perfect for sharing amongst friends. Non-offensive and would be enjoyed by any beer drinker, definitely not exclusive to craft beer drinkers!"
"Notes: I had this paired with several excellent, authentic Italian salume products, and the citrus and carbonation did an excellent job of palate cleansing, and held up well."
"This may be the first beer I can assuredly classify as a ""lawnmower"" brew. I just might seek this out when I know I'll be in the sun for more than 15 minutes."
"D: I probably would not consider this a mainstay summer beer but it is not a bad beer"
"Beer very crisp and carbonated. Sour citrus aftertaste. Cold. Light. Very consumable. Summer beer. It's summer and, frankly, something too complex wouldn't satisfy me when the ol' sweat's a rolling. Would I drink another one? Why, I'm going to get it right now!"
"Very drinkable, nice summer beer."
"Pours a clear golden with a thick head that did not disappear. Aroma...I just couldn't smell anything. Body is light and carbonated. Taste reminded me of sour fruit candy,with a bit of a malty finish.this beer is a really weak version of this style."
"D: Would I have this again? Probably not. It is easy to drink, but what I expected and what reality actually is; this one is not even close."
"I see this was categorized as a pale wheat beer, but it seemed more like an attempt at a kolsch. Whatever, not a very good beer."
"D: This beer was a disappointment. Sure, they go down like water, but this beer is really lackluster and ordinary. There are definitely better wheats available, and this is certainly not on par with Anchor's other offerings."
"Drinkability: it has no outstanding qualities, reminds me of drinking a cheaper pilsner, drinkable, but nothing that want make me buy it again."
"M/D: Slightly thin body and somewhat over-carbonated, but in the extremely-filling-and-difficult-to-get-through-one-bottle respect, not the sharp-biting-carbonation-that-makes-you-want-to-belch respect. Somewhat of a lackluster beer overall."
"D: One of my favorite summer sessionalbe beer. A clean and easy to drink beer with good flavor and no bitterness. Great on a hot day or with a meal."
"D/M: clean, not too carbonated and very refreshing. A very solid summer brew."
"On tap at the brewery in San Francisco. Poured into a small 6 ounce fluted glass. The best way to describe this beer is wispy and fresh. Pretty drinkable and quite delicious. Nice wheat flavor with moderate bitterness from the hops. Great sessionable summer wheat."
"I haven't tried many summer seasonals that really stand out for me, but this one does and I make sure to get my fill every summer."
"D- This could easily be this summers session beer for me. So easy to drink, light clean crisp and refreshing. What else could I ask for?"
"notes: I would go back for this one. Summer time beers are my least favorite seasonal style and this one is bending my expectations."
"O- Very refreshing and full of flavor, I would find this beer a great thirst quencher on a hot summer afternoon."
"Pours out a hazy gold brew with a prety big head. Super carbonated. Has a grainy macro brew smell to it.Taste,hmm very good!! Now mind you im rating this for the style, taste is very mild, well balanced , not much in the way of hops or malt,but,its incredibly smooth. Beats the crap outta any macro out there. Mouthfeel is avg.Drinkability super high on list. An awesome summer brew."
"Drinkability: I thought this was a nice, lightly flavored and refreshing beer that would be quite good a summer beer for a yard party. I could see having another and I certainly would not turn it down if offered. That being said I don't think I'll be making any strong efforts to seek out more of this beer."
"BJCP Score: 33"
"Drinkability isn't bad at all. Quite content with this one!"
"EDIT: i return to this because it seemed there was a little bit more to it. talk about a finish. i think as it warmed, it was a bit better. not that i want this warm on a summer day, but i did drink this on a cool spring evening...i just compared it to the Sierra Nevada Summerfest. and i think i would prefer this one if i had a choice."
"Drinkability is very good. This is definitely a good beer to enjoy on a hot day during or after some yard work."
"Verdict: Up to this point in my journey, the Anchor beers I've tried have always been incredibly solid and have held up remarkably given their age. Unfortunately, Anchor Summer Beer just doesn't live up to the rest of the line for me in the flavor department. I can see this being the right beer for the market back when it was introduced, but today it just comes off as too thin and bland. Maybe it's time for something new."
"D - Very easy to drink and is refreshing but is also light in the flavor department. I could drink several of these in a sitting, but there are better representations of the style. But it is a pretty decent beer overall just not the best of the American Pale Wheat Ale."
"D- A really quality drinkable summer beer, light in body, but enough to to provide nice flavor profile, bitterness finishes nicely, very refreshing. Will plan to have this around for warm grilling days at the lake. Really nice as a summer session beer at 4.60% ABV."
"no reason not to try this beer something for the patio when its a little to hot"
"The only thing that kind of takes away a bit, for me is the heavy carbonation. A bit too intense for me."
"Drinkability is fine...it has a light enough taste that I could probably drink large quantities of it, but the taste is light enough that I wouldn't be drawn to that scenario."
"cheers!"
"Pale golden with a thick finger of off-white foam that sticks to the glass a little. The nose is pretty weak, wheat malt and mild citrus peel are present however. Faint untoasted grain and lemon zest are balanced with mild hop bittering, tastes good but could use a stronger concentration to suit my tastes. Medium light bodied with crisp carbonation. This brew finishes squeaky clean. An easy drinking beer but there are many better choices in this category."
"Bottle pours a yellow color with a lot of head that dissolves almost immediately. The smell is not very strong or clear. I almost feel like I smell leeks or some sort of vegetable. The taste is also really bland. A little bit of bitter, but not else, with maybe a little donspecific citrusy taste. The mouthfeel is a little sharp to the tongue and not smooth at all, but has a thinner texture. Beer overall is not easy to drink."
"D: I'd grab a few of these on a hot day, but not if given a wider selection."
"D-As for drinkiability, it was fine for a lawnmower style of beer. Not quite the bold flavor of summer I was hoping for."
"I don't think this is a ""go-to"" beer."
"Pours golden with a huge, frothy, latte-like head that sticks around for awhile. Smells of delicate grain and lenon and orange citrus, a slight malty sweetness, and finishes clean. The taste soft, and salty-sweet with lots of graininess and a soft malty background. Tastes a little tired. Smooth in the mouth, but a bit too soft- this could definitely use some crispness. Just okay. I like my summer beers either a bit more tart or crisp, or both."
"Bright yellow with a huge pure white head in the glass, however, this beer appears to have been filtered as it is way too clear for a wheat ale. The nose is a bit grainy with a touch of lemon and some grassy hoppiness a bit too clean and reminiscent of a lager for my liking. The taste too is very crisp clean and pretty much just like a lager. The bitterness is ok and carbonation is fairly high however the malt is too thin and therefore the mouthfeel and finish are way too thin and dry, I was definitely anticipating quite a bit more. Ok I do have to admit that it is drinkable but fairly plain and on the low end of the summer beer ranking, that stated I'd still reach for this before a macro lager because it does manage satisfy my thirst on a hot day, not my favorite though."
"Pretty well rounded beer. I think this would be great as a session beer during any Summer get together."
"Overall a pretty decent simple American wheat ale. I certainly wouldn't mind having a couple more bottles on hand."
"Drinkability: Not offensive, smooth and enjoyable, but sacrifices flavor and nose for that experience. For the price, there are cheaper beers with similar flavor. And at any price there are beers that pull off the American Pale Wheat Ale much more enjoyably."
"Carbonation is high but it is very drinkable. Overall just an average beer."
"Not much of interest in this one, really, although it's not bad in the least. Kind of in keeping with most of Anchor's offerings. Pours your standard APWA yellow, with a smallish white head. Nose and flavors are surprisingly dirty, kind of a graininess that gives it a bit of character. Otherwise your standard mild wheat and a touch of citrus. Body is fine, appropriate with busy carbonation. Overall, not bad at all for the summer."
"a standard American wheat"
"Easy drinking summer beer but not enough character to be highly sessionable. Not my favorite style by a long shot."
"MF&D - Crisp and Easy to drink. An Excellent session beer. What you expect from Anchor!"
"D: I don't mind the ""fruitless"" style this guy puts forth. However, I will probably never get this again. Sometimes the summer beers are too predictable with their lemons and oranges, this was a change. Good or bad, I will let you decide"
"D..A very good summer beer. Easy to drink, not a very high ABV. Certainly a summer and/or session beer. Not the strongest tasting Anchor brew, but a decent offering."
"M&D- Clean and extra-light, excellent drinking for a refresher or session beer."
"A pretty bland beer, especially for the style. Maybe it was the filtering, not sure."
"D - even after a long walk on a summer evening, this beer does little for me. Drink 6 of the 12 oz.for the review."
"Overall an interesting light beer. I won't have a problem finishing off all 6."
"D: Eye-catching? Check. Refreshing and light? Check. Alas, this is a pretty boring wheat ale from Anchor. It's not bad, but there is little to recommend it over some of its competitors."
"This beer is made for summer sailing. Very uplifing to say the least, and it won't fill you up."
"Poured from bottle with no freshness date into a pint glass. Bottle describes a foamy egg white head but head left cobb web lacing that topped out at a about an inch. No real scent and easy mouthfeel makes it easy to drink. Nothing about this beer really stands out and say purchase me again I am a great wheat beer."
"Frothy, dimpled bone white head, crests a little over one finger, slides down the glass sides too easily to develop much lacing. Luminescent pale orange color, much closer to yellow than any darker hue, fully transparent, the slow, well-spaced bubbles visibly rise. Grainy nose, wheat stalks, pine cone, raw pretzel dough with a light dried earthiness, no distinct fruit scents but there's some dried lemon peels. While on the whole light-bodied, what body is there gets anchored to your tongue and is not apt to show any sign of forward progress. Dry with the expected wheat, grain, oat or hay type of taste and texture, curiously the carbonation makes it a bit more rough in feel than smoothed out. Any citrus element a bit player here. If it gets warm enough there's some maltiness near the finish to lessen the bitterness. Would drink one if someone handed it to me, that's about it."
"d- it's drinkable, just wish the taste matched the killer appearance, i'd drink again, but wouldn't buy it, guess it's just ok for me nothing really stood out aside from the appearance."
"Nothing to sneeze at. But I don't think this will make anyone any more sit up and take notice. But a classic and a perfect seasonal."
"A crisp, light, and refreshingf beer. I'd gladly have one if I was offered it on a hot day but it's nothing that blows the mind."
"(D)- A fine summer beer. Light and crisp. Just nothing to write home about in terms of its flavor."
"Anchor Summer Beer is a slightly hazy light golden beer with a thick, fluffy, white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a fruity wooden aroma (Saaz?) and it smells a little funky. It's light bodied; smooth and foamy with a crisp finish. It's a mellow flavor. There's enough green bitterness to keep me thirsty. There's a note of lemon rind at the finish. It's a nice summer beer: not watered down, but simple and refreshing."
"Not bad but not good, either. This beer pours a bright yellow-gold color with a puffy white head. It smells a lot like a mediocre lager, sorta grain sour. It tastes a bit better with some citric notes and a cleaner malt flavor. I'm still a bit surprised that this is an ale. I'd love if brewers took beers like this and made a lager version of the same recipe. It seems like an interesting comparison with such a light and fairly crisp beer. At any rate, it's drinkable on a hot day and preferable to most BMC lagers, but it's not a huge step up. Then again, it's a fairly weak style, so my score is probably a bit harsh."
"Pours luminous & transparent golden color with enormous white head. Nose is nothing like a wheat beer - instead it has a rather lager-like metallic hop aroma with faint grain in the background. On the palate the hop tang comes through, almost like this is a watery version of a bohemian pils. Light bodied and easy drinking, with not much positive to say."
"Overall, a fine warm weather beer, easily sessionable"
"A good summer beer, very similar to Sierra Nevada's summer. Perfect for a hot day, nice and crisp and grassy."
"Was a big fan of all the other Anchor stuff I've had in the past so getting their summer seasonal was a no brainer. I must say, I'm a tad disappointed with this one. Pours a hazy golden color, not much action going on inside the beer.. starts off with a big fluffy head but quickly dissipates. Typical light bodied wheat summery taste that seems to be cloned across the summer seasonal board, the taste not so appealing on this one though. Finishes a tad try. Drinkable none the less, but I had this following a Southern Tier Hop Sun and that is a good amount better than this one. I'll try other summer seasonals, but thanks for trying Anchor."
"D- A fine go to beer on a hot day, but not memorable."
"An easy going beer, for sure. It claims on the label to be the first American wheat beer of the modern era--first brewed in 1984. Anchor deserves kudos for that and it was likely quite the brew back then. In the current modern milieu, though, this beer is nothing more then average."
"light body with a good amount of carbonation. very drinkable on those hot summer days. prolly wouldnt buy this again, but definately nice while playing some disc golf."
"Don't get me wrong, i could drink a 12 pack on a hot day and not even blink. One of the better lawn cutting brews."
"[Drinkability]: Extremely smooth. A great warm weather beer!"
"D: Not bad, but not particularly good either. This would be good if you need something to quench a monster thirst without any big flavors getting in the way."
"D - Great beer to drink sitting on the end of the dock."
"I was sort of hoping this would be a boring but highly drinkable summer wheat. Unfortunately, it isn't. I sort of winced on my first taste but then warmed up slightly to the beer. The mouthfeel is pretty medium on the light side but it lacks the drinkability that it ought to have as a less-than-delicious summer brew."
"Lighter bodied and carbonated. Gets a few points in this area for assisting in drinkability. A hot weather beer for sure, but not enough complexity to make me seek this instead of something else. Not a stinker in any respect, and well structured for what it is, but...uh...it is what it is."
"Not a bad beer, but not that good for Anchor, still worth a grab for a sixer if you are going to the beach with some friends or whatever."
"A decent wheat ale, similar to most wheat ales ... easy to drink on a hot day but there are so many other summer wheat beers that are a notch better than this one."
"2.0 D: I think the filtering gets rid of most of what works well with the style."
"Not bad for the price."
"Drinkability: Well, that was a big, cold glass of absolutely nothing. Weak, washed out, and woefully bland. Yes, I understand summer beers often opt for lighter flavor profiles, but this is ridiculous."
"D: Quite good. I will keep these on hand for warm weather. Perhaps not the best of the bunch, but locally produced, and available at the local supermarket as well."
"On-tap in a pint glass, Anchor summer is a golden/orange color with a frothy dismal head that left minimal lace. Smells of ripe fruit, faint hops, and sweet malts. Taste is heavy on fruit with orange and apricot coming through. A nice wheat base also, Some hops, fair amount of malt base. Mouthfeel is thin with some body and carb. Good for a go in warm weather and light in alcohol, not my bag though."
"pour is golden with a white head and a tight bubbles. very consistent small bubbles. smell is protein and some hop. taste is one dimensional. hair, lemon zest, and straw like yeast. not very refreshing. not crisp at all. went very slow. won't have again."
"Pours a golden straw color with honey highlights; a small yet dense white hed that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of a lemony/apple tartness, and a clean sharp wheat malt. The taste is light and clean; a light lemony flavor starts things off with a green apple tartness. A very very light grassy hop hits towards the end. The feel is light and fizzy; quite neutral perhaps a tad tart. One of the better American wheat beers out there, simply because it doesn't have any annoying flavors to go with it. Not too lemony, Anchor lets the wheat malt speak for itself. As the label would suggest, good summer time beer."
"Medium carbonation but a little watery. I wouldn't argue if someone offered me one but this isn't one of my favorite summer seasonals overall."
"D - An easy drinking wheat beer. Reminds me of Anchor Steam with wheat."
"I enjoyed it very much. With its light feel and taste, It makes for a good warm weather beer. perfect for a BBQ."
"Highly drinkable but lack of flavors discourages me from wanting to try more than one of these. Beer looks amazing but tastes extremely mediocre. Not rushing to try another of these soon"
"Slight haze in an orange-y brass body. Small, eggshell white head doesn't last too long. Yeasty wheat bread notes mix with nutmeg, clove, and banana. Spicy, peppery hop edge. Toasted bread malt and minty hop bitterness up front. Yeasty doughy malts mix with mushy fruits. Faint banana. Light herbal and citrus hop bitterness in the finish. Moderate body with a slightly fizzy feel. Not a bad summer quencher, but kind of forgettable."
"D - This Wheat Beer is a good drink, very sessionable, and another good beer by Anchor"
"Much lighter than my expectation."
"Notes from 12/22/04"
"The aroma is yeasty with a sour wheat element. The appearance is golden with a foamy head. The flavor has the wheat malt, bitterness, and some of the sourness from the aroma. The palate is thin. I think this beer would benefit if it were unfiltered. It's not bad but not that good either."
"D: Eminently drinkable even when consumed a bit out of season - would be a good picnic or baseball game beer served cold. I enjoyed the draft version much more than the bottled one."
"Pours a very translucent non-cloudy yellow colored body, with a big white head that's somewhat lasting. Has a very malty aroma, slightly acidic nose, some effervescence. A smooth malty taste, but not skunky, and not nutty. Very Refreshing."
"D: Overall the flavor was muted, a tad watery, and disappointing making this a quaffer or lawnmower beer at best."
"Overall not worth it to me. The price is a little much for what I'm getting here. I've had better of this style."
"The aroma was citrusy and of malted wheat. Faint pear smell. The taste was bitter wheat with a crisp finish. It was highly carbonated and full of pop. This is a pretty good beer with a solid story to tell. Not my f"
"The taste is too thin, bland, and rough with a rough bitternes that is far too strong for this beer and its thin character. It is mostly light lemon and crackers. It's worse with food."
"Definitely not a bad choice for the end of an afternoon mowing the lawn."
"Not a bad choice if you want something different from a standard issue lager or Pilsner in the summertime."
"Outside of its appropriate context, I'd steer away, but feel free to enjoy in front of a summer game."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a golden-yellow color with a decent frothy, white head. Aroma is all malts, bread, grains, wheat, and a bit yeasty. Flavor is sweet all the way, light and unoffensive. Decent beer, kind of bland, but nothing really special about it."
"From a six pack the cost $9.69 at the North Coast Coop in Arcata, CA this poured a cloudy yellow with a foamy head and light lacing. Nose of light malts. light hops, and very little wheat. Light mouthfeel. Flavor is much the same and there is a light and watered down finish. Not a very good effort by a brewery that usually does better."
"Very light body and extremely drinkable. Total session beer and one for the hot weather."
"taste is of grain, very slight citrus, wheaty, aftertaste is slight dry and tangy."
"D: This is damn quaffable beer. I wish that I had more of this over the summer. It would make an excellent session beer after yardwork, before/during/after the ballgame, or while grilling. Goes well with with grilled chicken, fish, or shrimp."
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with a inch head that becomes slightly rocky as it settles, and turning out some decent lace. Would liked to have seen some more haze. Smell is grainy and sweet. Taste is clean grain flavors, a bit of spiciness and citrus elements from the hops, an average wheat flavor, sweet in the beginning and dry on the finish. Good carbonation, crisp and somewhat refreshing. A good summer beer for a hot day in the sun, but nothing spectacular."
"D_Quite refreshing for a hot summer day. To me this seems like a Czech Pils made with a good deal of wheat. Also this is very clean tasting with no apparent flaws which would be easily detected given the lightness of the beer. Not an all year round beer for me but I will pick up a sixer of this for the next heatwave we are supposed to get."
"Pours a nice dark straw color with excellent head and lacing (for a wheat beer). Good scent, slightly malty and wheaty, but fairly weak. Good taste, although the pepper/spice flavors almost completely overtake the wheat beer flavor lurking in the background. It's a little rough going down, but not bad. Not the best summer beer, nor the best wheat beer, but worth a try if that's your style of interest."
"Overall, Anchor Summer Beer is a pretty decent brew to enjoy in the warmer summer months. Worth a shot."
" Notes: What a disappointment. I found this easy to drink in the sense that it was not a horrible beer,yet in this style I expect a whole lot more. I remember enjoying my thin Widmer more and that is not even in top class. Do you think I will buy this again?"
"overall- a solid summer brew"
"drinkability is excellent, this is a really nice ""Summer Brew""."
"Overall this a refreshing brew. A good quaffer for these blistering summer days. The beer is fairly light all the way around. Its a good brew, but there are other summer brews I would reach for."
"A mild herbal wheat flavor comes though, along with caramel malts and a subdued hop presence. This beer is perfectly unoffensive, but lacks any stand-out qualities. Nice for a summer day where you don't want to have to think about what you're drinking."
"Drinkability: I've had better summer beers, but this isn't a bad attempt, just average. I was expecting a little more from the Anchor crew."
"Well carbonated, and -- compared to the flavor -- not terribly thin mouthfeel. That is, unfortunately, the only good thing about this beer. I have to admit I'm pretty disappointed after everything else I've had from Anchor. Still drinkable, but nothing I'll pick up again."
"A must try for the summer beer fan out there. Even with the high price tag I believe I will be buying another one of these as fall is still 2-3 months away!"
"D - Not the best Anchor has but solid. I'd prefer the Liberty Ale for a refreshing beer."
"Drinkability is a bit above average."
"Poured in to a tulip glass. I like it very cold. Awesome white foamy head like whipped cream. Leaves some nice rings. Nose very flat. Feels good in mouth. I'm starting to like wheat beers. Clean aftertaste. Lives up to it's name. Very drinkable summer beer. Would like to put a case of this on ice, and drink a few and take a nap."
"D - Better then Bud or Miller but not that impressed."
"D- Very easy to drink. This is a decent beer, but there are so many other wheat beers out there that I prefer. Although it would be a step up from a ""lite"" beer when drinking all day or out in the sun."
"D: Definitely drinkable, the name says it all in that this is a very pleasant beer to drink on a hot summer day. Not my favorite Anchor but for what it is I did enjoy this brew."
"The Summer Beer certainly lives up to its name as a light, refreshing lawnmower brew, if not much else. I personally prefer a hoppier beer to beat the heat and would reach for their Liberty Ale before this seasonal, but the Summer Beer is pretty good for what it's intended for!"
"For us all."
"It's the rich man's coors."
"Smooth and not complex in the slightest, this won't offend much by anything obnoxious, but rather by what this wasn't. The color is clear for a pale wheat but, more importantly, this lacks any reminder of pale wheat ale flavor. It's more reminiscent of a fairly good macro ale, honestly. Not a bad way to beat the heat, but not one that piques my interest."
"The drink is on the thin side of medium-thin bodied with a dry finish, and is consequentially pretty darned easy to drink."
"M/D: Fizzy, light bodied, crisp, not too much of a surprise. Decent drinkability, it goes down easy enough, but it could really use some taste."
"D - The crisp and mild taste w/ nice creaminess from carbonation makes this a great summer beer or lawnmower beer if you will. The taste is smooth and refreshing, but doesn't scrimp on flavor in the least. I could see this becoming more frequent beverage in my summer line-up. This has plenty of quaffa-drinkability"
"Nice body to it, without being too heavy. A very drinkable beer - probably one of my new summer favorites!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkabliity: Light and refreshing on the palate. Body is on the lighter side of medium and carbonation is lower than expected, perhaps this gives the perception of a heavier body(medium as opposed to light). This is one I'd drink again but I""m definitely not going to pay 9.99 a sixer for it again. Show me a bar where this beer is reasonably priced and I""ll buy it again. Glad I tried it but just not worth the money."
"A drinkable summer beer but nothing special."
"Aggressive pour gave about a finger and a half fluffy head which dissipated after a minute or two into nothing, and no lacing. Color of apple juice. Smell was bready and extremely subtle fruit notes with a metallic twang in there somewhere. First taste, yep tastes like an Anchor beer. Very bready and lager-like, it's hard to believe they use Ale yeast. I'm not a big fan of Anchor and this beer did little to increase their stock with me. However it does go down pretty nicely with a satisfyingly bitter finish. It's not horrible, I would drink it again but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Notes: I'm generally a big fan of Anchor, but this one just doesn't do it for me. I'll stick to Liberty Ale on a hot Summer day."
"Pours a dark golden/straw color with a prolific amount of persistent bubbly carbonation that results in an off-white 3-finger head that recedes at a slow pace and leaves no lacing behind. Swish it around a bit to open up the aromas. Smells malty and buttery with some banana and orange fruitiness in the background. Tastes malty up front with some very slight fruitiness and a bit of bitterness to round things out. Mouth-feel is light to medium-bodied and very drinkable. Anchor is very proud of this brew, and it does have the history to make them feel proud of it, but it does not compare to some of their other standards."
"Pours a clear golden color with a pretty serious white head, and excellent sheets of lacing on the glass. Smell is a little plain, wheaty, maybe a touch of lemon. Taste is bready, with a strange bit of sourness in the mix. It's crisp, drying, kind of refreshing. Certainly drinkable, but a little uninspiring considering how tasty the rest of the Anchor lineup is. Worth a try in the summer, though."
"Drinkability: None of us really enjoy the taste of this one, so even though it's pretty smooth, I can't imagine any of us drinking more than one or two of these (unless it's one of the few beers at a party). Nothing special here; we're pretty dissapointed."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a nice golden amber, with a nice 1 finger creamy white head. Head was made up mostly of very very small bubbles, looked like whipped cream on top, and left great lacings on the sides. Smell reminded me of white bread, and for lack of better terms, summer in the farm country. Taste at times was bland, almost macroish. Had hints of table pepper and vanilla, but very minor. Felt like a summer beer going down, didn't coat well, but was a decent consistency. Definitely a good summer beer for a hot sunny day of lawn mowing, but I can't see doing much more than that."
"Overall, a fine selection and something that will be a regular in my fridge during summertime!!"
"I bought a six pack of this which is a total bummer as I could have bought a six pack of bud for less than half the price and would have had a very similar experience :("
"Pours a slightly hazed amber, thick tight white head forms, drops behind some nice lacing, good retention, retains a pretty thick ring. Smell is a bit sharp, honey, brown sugar, grains, lemons, light floral, wheat, not a whole lot going on but pleasant enough. Taste is weak, some sweet malt, biscuits, citrus bite, wheat, sharp finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, refreshing but bland."
"a great summer beer!"
"Drinkability: It is good enough though I had higher expectations given the brand and the fact that i drank it while brewing my own american wheat. i hold out hope that i can give this beer a run for the money."
"Overall I was expecting a bit more. Not one of the better brews from anchor. It wasn't bad, and I'd certainly have another if offered, but I most likely will not be purchasing this one again."
"D: Dissapointed again. Bland and boring. Easy to drink many but not much pleasure out of it- so many better options out there. Heading back to the Weinestephaner."
"Drinkability: Not too bad. It feels somewhat bland but goes down well and could make a good session ale. Average at best."
"Pours a dark golden color with nice white very fluffy head that diminishes to a white film. Aroma is yeasty and malty. Flavor is the same. Lacing on glass was minimal. Mouthfeel was pleasant. This is a very refreshing beer with a high degree of drinkability."
"D - I could probably drink a number of these at a baseball game, out in the sun, etc; it's easy to drink; however, I'd probably rather something else. I really enjoy other Anchor Steam brews, so I guess my expectations were high for this. It just didnt do much for me. I plan to give it another shot sometime. May revise."
"Mouthfeel is quite good. Good carbonation and body, refreshing when cold. Just doesn't really hit the spot."
"D: This is a disappointingly average beer. It's really a halfhearted attempt at a wheat beer that's too simple in its style."
"Overall this didn't stand out in any way, and I was pretty disappointed."
"Overall an ok beer. A good purchase, but I doubt that I will purchase it again. I wouldn't turn it down if offered though."
"Recommended..."
"Sampled fresh at the brewery after the tour. Noticeably better and fresher than bottled back in Tx. Medium golden color with bright white head. Definite lacing. Smell is of eggy foam, kind of like a fresh meringue. Kind of unappealing. Crisp wheaty honey taste and a medium length finish along with the eggy flavor again. Decent and easy to drink, but there was a flavor in this that once I picked up, I couldn't really enjoy it any more."
"I remember liking this one alot more.. maybe it was the hot weather at the time... really a very good take on the style; possibly just not when there is snow on the ground."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, its a nice lighter beer but there are several others that I would pick first."
"The feel is watery and sour, like a lemon-drop. It's a really sour, puckery summer brew. Really refreshing and nice."
"Nothing too memorable here, although I will give it another shot in the summer months when it would be fresher and could really hit the spot."
"pours a honey golden opaque with a two finger white head that fades quickly with a fair amount of good sticky lace. weak slight spiced aroma. very bland spice,pepper taste what saves it is the light sharp crisp mouthfeel and carbonation. have had much better and don't think i will buy this beer again."
"Almost seems like a kolsch for this wheat/summer ale. Not bad but really not the special. Refreshing and I wonder if I would appreciate this more given the correct season."
"This is better than the average American wheat ale. And this one does seem to drift towards the Bavarian styles without really going there. Do like the Bavarians much better, but this isn't bad. Clean, yellow hazy gold color. Fresh nose. Satisfying flavor, body, and finish. Easy drinking."
"D: maybe in August after mowing the grass this would be a good thirst-quencher, but as I sit here tonight - even as a fan of malt - I am happy to have experienced yet another unique brew, however, I won't be actively seeking more."
"It is a clear, golden colored beer with a thin head that leaves spotty lacing. This is a dark wheat beer and not the witbier I have been accustomed to. The aroma is biscuits and yeasty malt. The taste is malty with no bitterness noted. Not what I expected from a wheat ale. I did not like it at all. It is light bodied and lightly carbonated. Leaves a bit of an unappetizing lingering aftertaste. Time to put this one to bed."
"Could drink a lot of these, especially in the heat"
"Into a pint glass, pours a clear shade of pale gold,.a fluffy white head of half a finger, lots of nice lacing, quite nice. The aroma is very much Anchor... which I respect, but don't like all much. Wheat, hay, and earthy things are prominent in both aroma and taste, some citrus in the latter, like lemon-grass. The mouth is probably the most pleasant thing about this beer, at once smooth, crisp, and a bit grainy in the finish. In all, its one more Anchor beer I don't like, but would still drink, my weird love-hate thing with em'."
"But, it's a cool bottle, nice design...hope the recycling guys like it."
"Overall - An decent enough brew - pretty drinkable when chilled... worth a try..."
"Of all the Anchor beers out there, this is the plops! ..Pours an uninspiring haze with low foam... Taste is refreshing but lacks any character! Not much else to say except that i wasted my money on a whole sixer! Pass on this and get a real beer! shame!"
"Like so many summer brews, this is good for a hot day. Easy drinking, but then there are so many more that are notches higher."
"Grains, malts, hints of citrus, light crisp hops. Wheat flavor is muted and not as full or rich as I like for the style. Alcohol is surprisingly noticeable at only 4.6%."
"Beer Pours a crisp pale golden color. Smell is a lemony, hoppy smell. Balance of wheat and hops is very smooth. Taste is crisp, and a wheat and lemon flavor. I also tasted a slight pinch of honey and molasses. Nice touch on a wheat beer. Carbonation is smooth, and we had no trouble putting this 6 pack away while watching some baseball. Great Summer BEvERage."
"D: I had no problems drinking this beer, it would be a good thirst quencher on a hot day, but there are other summer beers I prefer, not a horrible buy though, for me."
"In summary, I wouldn't turn one down... but there's wheat beers out there that have more going on."
"Drinkability: Low ABV makes this sessionable, I just don't really want to drink many. An ok beer that is good on a hot day, but I only find myself wanting one or two."
"This is your typical/mediocre/run-of-the-mill wheat beer. Nothing makes it stand apart, and it has minor irritants, to boot. Bland. Good enough to have one or two on a hot day, but so are so many better ones."
"D: Very drinkable, especially in summer weather. I easily went through the 6-pack I bought, and I might get more while this heat lasts!"
"Tried this again on 8-27-08: The smell is mustier than I remembered it, the watery consistency is also quite pronounced. My review hasn't changed, still an average take."
"Well I'd take this over a Budweiser on just about any day but only just so. A really lackluster beer from an otherwise great brewery. Pass on this beer."
"D - Uh, not good. This is a very odd beer and not in a good way. There are two factions at war here...the acrid pils/saaz pepper hops vs. the sweet yeasty fresh baked bread. Sadly, the saaz/pils army spoils what could have been a tasty yeasty wheat beer. This is not bad, but it sure ain't good."
"Taste is very light with lots of the banana, and a bit of bready yeast. Zingy peppery bite. Nice sour, almost lemony character. Not complex, but it is what it is, a refreshing, light summer beer that has a lot of flavour. Not overcarbonated in the mouth, and lightly dry. Enjoyable, not mindblowing."
"D: Good and drinkable. You should expect more from an American Pale Wheat, BUT as a summer seasonal it fits the bill nicely."
"Not the best of example of this style but a good offering form Anchor."
"A disappointing beer. American wheat beers always leave me with an emptiness, that they could have done such a better job. I'll have to try and get my hands on some Gumball and a few others to sway my opinion"
"All in all a very solid summer beer. i would love to drink more of it."
"Pours a clean yellow with a white head that hung around for a bit. It had a subtle pilsner style hop aroma, which I thought was a nice change. In the taste, malty, kind of, well just there. It is a smooth beer, expecting more bitterness to it compared to the nose. Not all that exciting, bot it was OK."
"Taste of wheat and biscuity caramalts, which is a little dextrinous. A medium malt backbone. Some off flavors produced by the yeast, medicinal and yeasty. Mouthfeel is a little sticky and sweet. Aftertaste is a dry, biscuity taste."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark yellow almost orange with a decent sized head. The aroma is of earthy hops against wheat and some sweet fruits. The taste is almost like a well-hopped hefe-weizen. Good earthy citrus hops blend nicely with sweet fruits and bubble gum. The beer is light-medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. This is a very enjoyable summer beer that would make for a good session."
"Poured a glass out of a 1pt 6oz bottle from BevMo. Poured a clear, golden color with about 2 inches of foam after an aggressive pour. Foam dissolved very slowly leaving a lot of lacing. Hint of malt in the nose. I was going to give a higher rating on the nose because it started out promising. However, by the end of the glass there wasn't much aroma left. The taste has a malty edge to it with a slight bitterness. However, the bitterness doesn't seem to be hops induced. Nice beer. What Budweiser and Miller claim to be making but better. Living in San Francisco I will always give kudos to Anchor. A nice beer. However, this ""ale"" has all the markings of an American Lager."
"D: As a beer styled for summer, the light body makes for one of those refreshing kind of libations for the heat, but the flavor characteristics just aren't enough to really make for a truly tasty beverage."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. The beer pours a light clear gold, forming a very thin white head. Medium spots of lace dot the glass. The aroma is light, smelling very floral like hops, but I suppose thats the wheat. Its too light to make a definite destinction. The taste is very light and crisp. Wheat malt, and maybe some hops. Very light but refreshing. Light smooth mouthfeel. Very smooth finish, low abv., and decent flavor makes for a good summer ale. If I had a yard to mow, I could see having this ready for when I finished. Good offering from Anchor!!"
"The taste has the wheat flavour and some citrus hop in the background that comes over mostly as lemon zest. It's *kind* of tasty but there's not a whole lot going on here so I wouldn't bother with a repurchase. Not one of Anchor's better brews, imho."
"Drinkability: Vert drinkable summertime brew, great feel and light flavor. I'll definately keep this one in mind when im goin to be drinking in warm weather and i want a light wheat beer that still has character."
"The beer poured gold and clear with a fine white head that stayed throughout. A pretty standard sour malt and hops aroma. The taste is light malt with a hint of hops. The feel is light and dry. A fairly drinkable beer. I'm not sure what the object was here, but my first thought was hey this is like Pearl or Jax, or maybe even Falstaff, but brewed with better materials in a smaller batch. I wouldn't be adverse to one if offered as it is a bit nostalgic, but not one I'd pursue."
"Drinkability - It finishes without lingering but with a slightly sandy texture. I'm not a big fan of the style and this isn't swaying my prejudice."
"The aroma holds toasted wheat, grain and light malt notes. The body is a light golden/yellow and holds a lasting, thumb thick, white head. Light bodied fore features mild citrus notes, toasted wheat and malt and a clean crisp finish. Quite refreshing and easy drinking."
"Overall, this is a very refreshing summer brew with a fair amount of flavor to satisfy the palate. I would only drink this on a hot summer day though, since the flavors aren't very pronounced."
"Pours a very golden straw color. Very little head that quickly disapates. The aroma is somewhat light. Wheat, grains and just a hint of citrus. There is almost too much carbonation for me but you get used to it. The taste is pretty mellow. Bitter and grainy. Finishes crisp and dry. Not great but nothing to write home about."
"Overall, a forgetable beer. Nothing that stands out at all, and not nearly as good as many other american wheat's out there....It's worth a try, but don't expect a whole lot. If you sitting outside in the summer heat, drinking with a few friends, and just want to drink a beer that you don't have to think about, it may be good. Other than that, I'd pass on it."
"Tasty at first but a bit of astringency in the aftertaste. Suffers from a lack of hopping as well, this beer is is too one dimensional and lifeless. As expected, overcarbonation is an issue in the texture. Many better summer brews are availbable; I too am a bit let down by anchor here."
"Pale yellow, brilliantly clear and sparkling with carbonation. The head is thick thanks to the wheat, but disappointingly small. Clean, sweetish aroma of wheaty grain; very mild. A bit of perfumy lemon and a tangy wheat presence along with a nice lingering fresh graininess. Light bodied, refreshing, and moderately dry. It serves its purpose, it might not justify its pricetag."
"A surprisingly insipid brew. I had expected more from Anchor."
"In terms of drinkability, it goes down easy and won't get you plastered too quickly, so you can easily drink several. But it's not one to go out of your way for. Really no better than a higher end macro lager, to tell the truth. Essentially a Michelob with a lemon. Not impressed -- but I guess every brewer's got its duds."
"The flavor is far less complex, leading with bracing citrus, then going to a round and smooth brassy character for grassy hops to play on. Crackery grain finish. As far as flavor, I don't get much from the actual wheat in this beer, which is a little disappointing. Overall I would say this is hardly an APA in my mind. I am rating it highly because I like that it takes things in a direction other than puckering astringency and citrus."
"D - clean, crisp, refreshing summer beer, good drinkability."
"D: Just a simple, clean, refreshing and easy to drink sessionable wheat beer. Very solid choice, nicely crafted. I would liken this to drinking a Hoegaarden - nothing spectacular but a perfectly drinkable, every day beer."
"Light summer drinker. Very light  not really wheaty  more like a lager."
"Pours a clear, bright golden color with an eggshell white, foamy head. Aromas of lemons and pungent, toasted bread pale malts. On the palate, sweet malts, then a flash of acidity before the two elements come crashing together in the finish, which is simultaneously malty and citric. Mouthfeel is light, but the malt element weighs things down a tad. Overall, this is a decent, drinkable wheat beer, something that is thirst quenching and easy to drink. It strikes me as a good microbrew gateway beer."
"Pours out like hazy, slightly under-ripe mango flesh. A fluffy white head settles to a thin, but impressive head. Leaves spotty lacing. Nose is of peach, apricot, mango, papaya, and melon with some cracked wheat grain. Flavor is nectarine with grain in the background. Some bread and honey. Ends dry with a mild astringency and kiss of blueberry. Light body with kind of weak carbonation. Drinkability is fine, but there are more interesting examples of the style."
"Very drinkable, in that you can slug several on a hot summer day."
"Good stuff."
"Great head that sticks to the glass very well and sticks around for quite a while. Smell is nice and wheaty and citrus. The taste is a balance of what with a nice sweet start that is citrusy and a nice hop bitterness to finish. Nice crisp mouthfeel and good drinkability. I may visit this again in the summertime."
"Pours a hazy straw hue, generating an extra thick and creamy snow-white head. Outstanding retention with lasting rings of sticky lace. Malted wheat and pale malt nose, otherwise clean. The soft sweetness of the wheat is immediatly recognized upon first sip, with extra pale malt in it's shadow. Very clean, almost lager-like yeast character, possibly a hint of pepper or a slight tannic taste from wheat malt. Very faint ale fruitiness in the afteraste and blank hop bitterness balance the flavor well. Medium-light body with lots of texture from the wheat, and moderately carbonated for a just barely crisp mouthfeel. Fanatstic drinkability, but this is partly because of the lack of character. A good example of a boring style, IMO- but well put-together."
"D-I like this,I would like to try a newer bottle I dont know how long this bottle was sitting in the ""2 buck barrel"" Its not bad at all,the worst part is the smell and I can deal with that.Ide like to try again."
"Clear golden appearance  medium / thick white head , last kind of long - nose is very , very light skunk , rice , grass , hopps and hay  taste of straw , corn , light wheat and and yeast sparkly body however, dry body  aftertaste slightly sweet, skunky , and earthy bitter like dirt"
"This is a light, uncomplex beer that, while not mind-blowing, is a very satisfying drink for one in need of some good ol' refreshment."
"Overall a good example of the style... i'm just not a huge fan of the style."
" There are superior American Pale Wheat Ales out there. This would not be among my top ten for the style, but still worth a try."
"Eric"
"Light gold and crystal clear topped by a big, fluffy, bright white head off an average pour. As the foam subsides, clumpy lace stuck to the glass. Fair retention. Crackery wheat aroma with light lemony citrus and floral hops. Mild flavour, pretty much the same as the aroma. Initially creamy texture, but the body and flavour fall away towards the end leaving it feeling thin. Light lingering lemon flavour. It's refreshing yet not very impressive, especially considering the thinness - otherwise this would be a much better summer beer."
"Although I would classify this as a refreshing beer, it's probably only because I was drinking it outside in the sun on a warm day. This reminded me a bit of lemon water, which is great in the right setting, I was just expecting more."
"The pour was smooth, the color light copper and capped with a white airy head. The smell was rich with wheat and a hint of fruit. Taste was vibrant, tangy with some apricot undertones. This beer is refreshingly smooth with a nice quite pale wheat finish. A nice drinkable summer selection. Worth a try."
"12 oz. stubby bowling pin bottle with some code on the back. The beer has a bright gold body with medium carbonation and a finger of off-white head and smells mainly of tangy wheat. It is light on the palate with a combination of wheat, pepper/coriander, and just enough leafy/green hops to balance. It is light on flavor and goes down almost like water, though the flavor gradually increases as it warms. Not anything great, but it's an easy drinker that I'm sure paved the way for many present pale wheat ales."
"Poured a slightly hazy pale golden color with abundant white puffy head. Very nice lacing. Smell is lemon-citrus and very tantalizing. Taste id a bit dissapointing , in that while very refreshing, there is nothing that really stands out about. Excellent drinkability, but a bit boring."
"There's nothing about this beer that's going to knock your socks off, but I think it will make a good summer time session beer."
"Beer pours to a nice golden/pale with light head that does not last long. Scent is not strong, but is refreshingly malty and sweet. Light honey/sweet taste and little grainy, with a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and bit dry even with the bitter aftertaste. A great balance of hops and malt for a wheat beer. Perfect for the summer and great drinkability. As my first Anchor beer it definitely makes me want to try another!"
"Disappointed, ultimately probably because of the age/condition of the bottle."
"D: I will definately get this again, very refreshing and light, with enough of a hop kick for a hophead."
"D - Good drinkability on a hot Texas summer day."
"D: Easy drinker. Nothing substantial stands out in this beer, just fairly straight forward."
"D - I really enjoyed it. I have yet to try it from a bottle, but I thought is was quite good on tap."
"Drinkability/Overall: Kind of boring, more of a pilsener than an APWA. At the same time, totally drinkable and inoffensive. Still, expected a little more character from Anchor."
"Drinkability - this decent, not great. It goes down well, and is very sessionable."
"Drinkability: Not as complex as Anchor's other beers, and certainly not as impressive. But nonetheless an immensely drinkable and pleasant summer beer. I will definitely be drinking a lot more of this, given the near-100 degree week we're having."
" Worth a try for a summer cooler and went down well with spicy wings."
"Excellent beer for a hot summer evening. Would make a decent session ale. Also, this is one to let your macro-drinking friends try, because they're sure to enjoy it. It's not like you can expect them to make the shift directly to an imperial stout, although I have tried ... really just to see the look on their face when they realize that there is beer out there that tastes quite different from Miller Lite. :)"
"Light yellow/straw color, clear, not too exciting, but it has a nice full head that sticks around leaving a good lace. The aroma is a bit weak, just a pleasant bready smell, a bit macro-ish perhaps. The taste is bready and not really that fruity, maybe just a hint of lemon. Hops are present but not strong. The finish leaves a slight sourness. The mouthfeel isn't bad, light but not watery. The carbonation is almost too strong though. A nice drinkable brew for hot weather, but not much here to keep you interested..."
"D - which leads to a high drinkability, very easy even for a macro drinker"
"Drinks fairly easy, nothing special, but the forebear of many very good beers of this style & deserves a try just a baseline , if nothing else"
"Poured into a glass a nice large white foamy head forms atop a dark yellow beer. The smell is kind of sour, not very inviting. The taste is pretty good. You can definitly taste the wheat influences with a small small touch of lemon. For a summer seasonal it has many layers of flavor. The mouthfeel is good. Crisp, carbonated and refreshing feeling, everything a summer beer should be. This is a pretty enjoyable summer seasonal. I enjoy the wheat, I think it gives it an extra touch that makes this seasonal all worth it."
"Bottle from Lubière: Poured a yellow/white color beer with a huge pure white bubbly head with good retention. Aroma of bubblegum and banana is just sublime on this hot summer day. Taste is refreshing with a nice crisp presence of wheat and some discreet hops in the background. Very well done for the style and very enjoyable during summer not sure why the rating are so low for this beer."
"I can understand why people are so underwhelmed with this brew...especially since it is the weak link in this brewery's offerings and is downright pricey. That being said, i'd totally make this an outdoor-drinking staple if it weren't priced so prohibitively. Also, a good transitory or training-wheel beer."
"an unassuming summer option but pricey here on the east cost."
"A good choice for hot weather drinkin."
"Pours a pale, clear, golden color with tons of head- frothy, fluffy head. Some nice lacing around the glass. Smell is malty and sweet- a cotton candy type thing going on. Also a bready and biscuityness in there. Taste is light, quite malty, and more breadyness. Quite light. Mouthfeel is sudsy and chewy and on the dry side. Ultimately, a light and refreshing brew, but there are others in this style I'd prefer to have."
"Not my favorite Anchor product, and my review speaks for itself. This one misses the mark."
"Absolutely top-class American wheat. Though I much prefer a German or Belgian wheat, there's a lot to like about this beer. Very refreshing in the summer."
"goo drinkability in the right context. not what i'm gonna go for when i wanna savor something, but a nice easy drinking beer for a warm day, when you want something simple."
"drinkability: a drinkable enough beer, got a good smoothness, but there better choices for summer beers. this stuff ain't cheap."
"A very nice wheat ale. The perfect summer brew."
"Pale, crystal clear gold, topped with a creamy white head. Good retention. Clean aroma, dominated by sourish wheat and citrusy, earthy hops. Very crisp flavor, light bodied with snappy carbonation. This stuff is perfectly designed to toss back in sweltering heat. Very clean, with a simple flavor consisting mostly of wheat and a bit of lemon-lime in the finish. The wheat contributes to a satisfyingly dry finish, mildy hopped and quenching. Not a lot going on, but it's a great beer for sipping in the summer months."
"A decent summer wheat."
"Bright and clear, solid yellow body with a medium white head. Aroma is just the slightest bit sulphury, with a crisp malt/wheat smell and a whisp of floral hops. Very light palate and an accordingly light flavor. Crisp malt is in the taste too, but the floral hops are a bit more prominent on the tongue than they were in the nose. Nice fizzy carbonation complements the light body well... this beer is what the ""American Lager"" style should have been (yes, I know it's a wheat ale). This is not one of those beers that knocks my socks off in a way that would make me seek it out, but it is an eminently drinkable summer quaff."
"Notes: Another in a long line of beers that I've had numerous times but never bothered to jot down a note. I've always enjoyed this brew and for those that have had the session premium lager from full sail, I find this to be similar although a bit lighter in every way."
"This is a pretty average wheat pale ale. You shouldn't turn up your nose at it but there are better options out there."
"Golden yellow color. White head that drops to a thin film that sticks around. Very active carbonation gives this a nice lively appearance. Smell of light wheat malts, lemon zest and some yeastyness that gives it a little bit of a bread note. Overall the smell is on the faint side. Taste is pretty bland. The high carbonation level covers up the little bit of flavor that tries to come through. Some wheat malt and a little bit of spicyness and some lemon zest are there if you really look for it. The finish is very dry. Overall just an average beer. Might be nice on a hot summer day when you are just lookign for something to wet you mouth, but on 2nd thought there are many better choices. The only redeeming quality, the active appearance due to the high carbonation level, ends up being a detriment when it comes to taste."
"This pours a clear golden yellow with a small head that disappears quickly. The smell is very slight with only a hint of citrus malt. The taste has some citrus hops and malt along with abit of wheat flavors. Not a bad tasting beer. The m/f is light with a good balance of wheat and malt flavors. This is a pretty good tasting beer, but I was expecting so much more."
"A light amber colored beer with an off-white colored head that leaves behind some lacing. Aromas of grains, bread, fresh fruit, and pine seem apparent to me. The taste is a delicious blend of fruity tartness and sweetness. It's quite refreshing (as might be expected for a wheat beer) with a dry, bitter aftertaste. The drinkability is high with this beer because of the low ABV and enjoyable flavors."
"Pretty nice brew here, pale golden wheat with a thin white crown of quickly receding head leaving an uneven film maintained fairly well by a decent amount of bubbles rising in towers. Buttered bread smells are light with perhaps a hint of lemon zest. Light malt notes accompanied by apples and a slight lemmon/citrus twang ended with just a small biscuit tone. Hops are welcome to an otherewise good, but non-exceptional brew, leaving a fairly clean, but not crisp, finish. Malts open as it warms, thank god. Light body and delicate carbonation for a very refreshing brew. HIghly drinkable, but not outstanding. Good representation of style IMO though."
"Mouthfeel was smooth yeat spicy with nice carbonation. Aftertaste is a bit bitter for my liking. Definitely would be a tasty beverage in the summer time; possibly during a baseball game or even an early season football game here in the south."
"Drinkability was purely average. There are plenty of other wheats I'd go for preferentially, but I wouldn't completely turn my nose up at this one if offered one at a get-together."
"While not a star if any show, it is a real nice summer beer, not run of the mill, and not a standout. Its crisp, refreshing, and inviting, but it still suffers ever so slightly from its innate thinness that falls just short of genuinely impressing. But wanting more actually helps make this drinkable, and thats good because it can slake a thirst in spite of any shortcomings. In the heat, in the sun, Id have no issue with one in the hand and one waiting in the bush. Or something"
"wasn't completely what i expected. for a summer beer i felt that it was a bit to hoppy for my taste. pours a nice golden with a good head that recedes very quickly. smells of hops with a tinge of alcohol. tastes very hoppy. for the style of beer this is i personally think there is way to much hops in it. mild wheat in the finish. definately a light bodied brew that's good for drinking on a hot day. this is one of very few beers that i wouldn't mind drinking out of the bottle."
"My last of the regular Anchor beers to review, other than the back cataolgue of OSA's. Very light colored body, ellow, and slightly hazy. The head is very creamy and full on the pour,, fading to leave a nice creamy layer of foam atop the beer. A little skunky malt and slight banana in the nose. Taste is skunky and old tasting, metallic and unappealing, rather offensive to the taste buds. Mouthfeel is poorly carbonated. This is not up to anchor quality. I will suggest you pass on this beer, and get the other anchor offerings."
"I felt a bit let down by this beer, but in no way does that mean it isn't good; I just felt it could have been better. Poured out to a nice Golden color with medium carbonation and some minor lacing around the glass. Aromas of malt, wheat and a slightly skunked character. Taste was decent enought, but slightly weak. Flavors of citrus lemon, grain, malt and hops. Better definition would be a nice improvement. Mouthfeel was crisp and zesty. Not bad drinkability, I'd have this again. Maybe next year some minor changes could result in major gains. Worth a try."
"Pricey and disappointing."
"1cm white, bumpy cloud on top of a clear, rich, gold body. Burnt toast and a little tangy spoonk in the nose. Front is very tangy citrus. Middle is sharp and fruity, medium body. Mucho burnt white toast in the end; very crisply bitter. Nice N Nutty aftertaste. It's good: good flavors: tangy, toasty, bitter."
"Although light and drinkabel, this version is tough to have again. A disappointing offering from Anchor, but this style is tough to pull off."
"Pours a nice golden color with a big fluffy head with decent head retention. Nose is grassy upon first impression with perhaps a hint of lemon there. Taste is crisp and cleansing of the palate, very wheaty as categorized. Mouthfeel is full and fairly lively. Overall drinkability is good. This is a nice little session beer that I would recommend."
"Did me good on a hot beach but not my favorite of the style."
"This is a light bodied beer and has surprisingly little carbonation when you look at its enormous head. This is a refreshing beer, but nothing spectacular."
"Mouthfeel has a lot of carbonation and a crisp, refreshing body that goes down easy. Not bad if you're looking for an easy drinking brew..but I'd rather have a good kolsch or pilsener over this anyday."
"Overall = This is a lame beer that did nothing for me. It doesn't taste bad and it can be drunk if you were desperate but I'd never purchase one on my own power again. Nothing going for it and yet nothing really against it either. Very disappointing."
"Pours a medium gold with a good 2 finger head, good longevity and very good lace. Aromas of a faint yeast what malt, a bit lemony and some decent hop floralness. A good wheat malt flavor mixed with some mild citrus flavors some banana flavors are also present. A bit watery though. Spritzy and high carbonation. Refreshing and easy drinking. A decent American wheat but there are better versions out there."
"Drinkability: Look elsewhere. Especially for the price. There are better wheats to be had. Kind of a bummer to drink this knowing it's an Anchor, but I'll make it up and have a Liberty Ale...."
"Pours a straw color with a small head of white foam that fades quickly to a wisp on top. Considering this is a Summer wheat beer, it leaves a pretty frothy lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma is mild and malty with some citrussy aspects. Taste is a real smooth light crisp beer. It has some sourness but it finishes clean and dry.There is nothing to mention on mouthfeel other than the smoothness and crispness. Quite a drinkable Summer beer. I like the fact that the fruity essences are handled very gently. Nothing is too overpowering here."
"D-This beer taste more like a light German pils than an American pale wheat. It is missing many of the wheat characteristics that it needs to enhance this beer and give it depth."
"After a few hours sweating in the backyard, I thought the Summer ale would be perfect. Man, was I wrong. I believe a COLD Miller Lite would have been better. Very malty with a grassy aftertaste. Warmed up quickly and this made it very hard to finish. From a brewery that impresses me, this one was a disappointment."
"Cute little anchor bottle. Pour is very pale yellow with a small white ""whipped egg white"" head that doesn't last. Smell is musty with some sulfur and veggies, kinda like a bad cologne. Decomposing lemons are present in the aroma and the flavor. Overall reminds me of a American macro lager with sweaty gym sock and citrus. The flavor starts off decently, but the finish is just awful. No thanks."
"Anchor Summer Beer is a little lacking in a few areas, but this is still a decent summer beer, considering what is available here. Simple, clean, crisp."
"D&N: I don't know why, I love (Anchor Summer Beer (Anchor Wheat)) like I do... Very tasty beer. Uber-refreshing. Crisp and clean with great aromas and flavors. I like beers that have me scratching my head trying to figure it out, and this on has it in spades. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: What a disappointment! I have truly enjoyed the other Anchor beers but this one is way too light and flavorless for my tastebuds."
"The drinkability level with this beer is so nice. It's so quaffable its not even funny. I polished two off and I'm not even trying. A truly great thirst quenching summertime treat. Maybe a tad overpriced, but a solid beer nevertheless."
"The mouthfeel is decent for a wheat, at least, but it is not a redeeming quality. I'd be able to drink much more of this without the said undescribable taste/smell. Keep in mind, I love wheat beers, but this one thoroughly blows. It sounds barbaric, but I thought this was better straight from the bottle than poured. I got less of a shitty taste/aroma that way. Buy this beer at your own risk, wheat beer lovers and completionists alike."
"Light body with a thin, but grainey mouthfeel. Not nearly as good as the other offerings I've had from Anchor."
"Not very exciting, but this could make for a good ""backyard beer""."
"Mouthfeel- Very carbonated and light on the tongue. Though let down on the flavor, this adds to the drinkability. I could slug several of these whilst fishing or doing yard work. Otherwise, just expect more..."
"Drinkable, refreshing, but not up to Anchor standards."
"Drinkability- The second Anchor beer I have been disappointed with. This and the Small Beer. I'll stick with my Seirra Nevada Wheat if I want a local micro of this style."
"A clean golden yellow beer. Has a big bright white foamy head that leaves a good lace. There is a light grainy (almost wheat cracker) aroma with a hint of lemon in the background. There is pretty much no flavor to this beer. There is a tinge of lemon on the sides of the tongue and a light dry hop finish. I guess this would be better ICE COLD in the summer time."
"An average lager all around, but a below-average brew from Anchor. Nice golden colour with a big head of white foam that leaves nice lacing on my shaker pint. Aromas are of grains, lemon zest, and slight hops. Taste is very grainy as well, with a bit of a biscuit maltiness in the middle and a slightly hoppy, lemony finish which is quite flavorless and dry. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonated well. Drinkability is good too. Truly an average brew from an above-average brewery."
"This brew poured a deep gold (in incandescent lighting) with short-lived average sized head. The aroma was typical of wheat brews -- a citrusy malt. The taste reminded me a lot of Boston Beer's ""Gold"" a few years ago on tap at the now-defunct Sam Adams Brew Pub (Philadelphia). It was clean, mildly hoppy with lemony undertones. Mouthfeel was good and this brew goes down quite easily."
"This beer was a little hard to describe for me, which is unusal for wheat beers (which all seem to share certain characteristics). This isn't a spectacular brew by any means, but it is a pretty solid offering from Anchor."
"Drinkability - a little out of its element here in November, but I kinda forgot about the sixer I had in a box I picked up from a trip to Houston. I needed one more sixer to round out a case of St. Arnold's sixers. No problem taking care of these, though, they are tasty."
"This beer is gold yellow in color. steady pour generated a frothy head that faded fast to a thin layer that laced the glass while drinking. The nose is crisp malt as well as the flavor. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. Not a typical wheat, almost more like a pilsner. I also enjoyed the label."
"Anchor Summer has a little different taste than the wheat beers I'm used to, and in this case that's a good thing. I found a sweeter malt taste than I was expecting with any beer than contains wheat. Appearance is classical wheat beer, a strong golden color with a slight haze. Highly carbonated which created a large, thick head. Aroma here is strong of typical hoppy beer smell, not much is noted of wheat aromas. Taste isn't as dry or ""wheaty"" as I would expect. However, this beer still seems to work well as a thirst quencher. The middle of a sip is more malty than expected, nice and rounded, some lemon is detected in the finish. For me this beer was a nice and different interpretation of the wheat style. Another beer from Anchor I'd recommend."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a 1/4"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light wheat scent with some lemon in there as well. The yeast adds a bit of fruitiness to it. The taste decent. It has a very clean tasting wheat flavor with a slight lemony edge. It goes down easy and finishes clean and mildly fruity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is by far not the best summer wheat beer I've had, but it still drinks well. It lacks real wheat flavor, but on those hot summer days, this could really refresh."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours with a three-finger pillowy, white head that fades slowly a good lace. Clear, pale amber color. Light-medium bodied. Nose is yeasty if anything. Strong carbonation. Starts sweet and crisp but not much wheat and finishes with a prickly bite. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Hoosick Street Disc. Beverage, Troy, Ny. Their site has the ABV at 4.6%."
"Crisp mouthfeel. Great clean summer wheat."
"I wanted to swallow it quickly because the feel in your mouth isn't all that great. Overall, I would have another but I think their Steam beer is much better. I'll have to try this again next summer to see if the recipe changes at all."
"I was really excited to try this summer brew, from what I consider to be one the most solid breweries in the country, and I wasn't disappointed. It is a very clean and crisp beer that seems to go perfect with a hot day. This is a wheat beer, but I don't get a very heavy wheat taste. Subtle malt and wheat tones set the pace for this beer and the overall drinkability is excellent. This would definately be up there in my list of session beers!"
"Overall Impression: Drinkable, as a good summer beer should be. Great looks, but a bit over carbonated to be a good thirst quencher. Enjoyable, but I wont crave another."
"Extremely drinkable, though. It would have been easy to put away quite a few of this light summertime offering. Try this on your friends who enjoy light beers and see what they think. Would pair nice with some chicken or some fish. A good backyard beer for those waning summer days."
"Light to medium bodied."
"Very frothy though temporarily. Malty and lemon twang with citrus hop and grass and fruit aroma. Thin but like Anchor. Above average carbonation. Crisp, clean, and bitter aftertaste."
"Pours a pleasant light amber. Minimal, ephemeral head, must have been the bartender's method on tap. Citrus whiffs immediately blossomed from the brew. Taste has mild hops, a lot of citrus, and a little tartness. Very light and refreshing mouthfeel. Leave the palette nearly clean besides a slight citrus aftertaste. Very refreshing and enjoyable!"
"Weak, weaker, weakest. Anchor may have brewed the world's first anti-beer, the beer world's answer to a photographic negative. If you don't see Summer Beer in your favorite beer store, try not to remember that I told you not to try it, unless you don't want to that is. Or not."
"This poured a bright and clear brassy golden color. Looks like a golden spritzer. A beautiful large, sticky cream-like head, that looked liked stiffly whipped egg whites. I loved watching the creamy head explode after the pour. Very nice. The aroma has lightly soured malts and a soft citrus hop bite that hits the nose with a sweet fruitiness. Theres a sweet strawberry coming through thats very appealing. The taste is sweet, light and tangy. Beautifully clean and fresh tasting. Has some buttery texture. Overall, a highly drinkable and enjoyable simple beer. Very refreshing. Another winner from Anchor."
"The head looks silky and smooth but wasn't as ""unusually abundant"" as they said on the label; it lasted quite long on the very slightly hazy yellow orange color body. The smell I found weak, some citrus and some herbal notes, the wheat not being really noticeable. The taste was very round and dry; fruity with liquorice and herbs. It reminded me more of whipped eggs than the head. Some sourness, more refreshing than annoying. Quite enjoyable and refreshing, and highly drinkable. The fruitiness is humid on the palate, but the hops made the throat dry."
"Beer pours a light golden color. The head is about a quarter inch, but fades before I even take a taste, contrary to what the label says. The beer smells sweet and slightly malty to me. A moderate malt flavor comes through first followed by a refreshing hop finish that doesn't linger too long on the tongue. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp and just heavy enough without being heavy. Drinkability of this beer is just above average. I would expect just a little less malt in a summer beer. There is no lacing to speak of as I drink the beer down. This would not be my first choice for a beer while grilling in the summer, but I wouldn't turn one down if it were given to me."
"The mouthfeel is lighlty crisp at the start and finish. The finish is slightly dry. This is lighter bodied and is light on the carbonation. Very drinkable, a definite thirst quencher for a hot day."
"Pours a golden pils color with no yeast haziness at all. Has some subdued wheat ale characteristics in the aroma. Rather thin in the taste, but I suppose if one was drinking seasonally, this beer is quite refreshing and easy to drink. I prefer a bit more oomph, myself. Nonetheless, a moderately good beer, but lacks a certain character I look for in a summer thirst-quencher."
"I first had this at the San Fran Beer Fest and hated it, but that was after extended stays at Ommegang, Unibroue and Stone--I figured it deserved another shot. It got it, but still, not impressed. They seem quite proud that it's the USA's first wheat--maybe they should concentrate a bit more on making it the best."
"Very average, and disappointing for an Anchor. Some aftertaste saves it from being totally bland, but compared to other good wheat beers nothing to recommend. None of the customary fruitiness typical for the style. Also, not much hops (compared to other micro wheat ales). The Baltika I had after this absolutely blew it away."
"Medium golden color with a fluffy white head and lots of streaming bubbles. Slightly sweet, lagerlike nose(cereal grains). Hops not noticable. Very mild palate. Wheat malt has control throughout the palate. Soft, lingering finish. Quite refreshing. Light mouthfeel, but exactly what I expected. Nice overall. A super, easy-drinking summer brew. I wish I had access to this more easily. Another great Anchor brew."
"Drinkability: I'd drink it but I'm sure there are more interesting and exciting beers out there. There weren't any notes that aren't met by a typical pilsner - it would make a good drink on a hot afternoon but I don't see a reason to go out of your way to get your hands on this brew..."
"Bright gold with frothy head that dwindles to a sudsy ring. Aroma of hay and light lemony hops. The beer is smooth, and initially sweet, with a clean and ample maltiness. Wheat plays a part too, adding a slight graininess and breadiness. Hops are mellow, providing slight friction and very little bitterness. The trademark Anchor yeast seems to be the dominant characteristic, supplying a slightly earthy, musty complexity with some sour raisiny fruitiness. A decent beer but not as fully dimensional as Anchor's classic Steam beer, which uses the yeast to better effect. This is a light, easy sipper that will quench the thirst but not the desire for adventure."
"pours out a brilliant golden colour...pure white clumpy, frothy head...lots of carbonation bubbling up from the bottom of my tall glass. lightly spiced wheat aroma...grainy, earthy. taste is a big letdown. any real wheat flavour is drowned out by an overwhelmingly spritzy mouthfeel. i want to taste my beer, not feel like i'm drinking seltzer water. a hint of bittering hops make up the finish. not very good."
"Although not true to the typical American Wheat style (in terms of hoppiness) this beer is really good. Pours to a beautiful white foam head with tiny bubbles and bits of lace. Clear deep yellow color--obviously fined and filtered. Flavor is mostly dry, tangy and hoppy with a nice malty finish with slight notes of fruit and butter as well. An excellent choice for summer sessions. Very easy drinking if you like bitter beer. Flavorwise this beer has more in common with German Pilsner than it does with most wheat beers. If you enjoy a good Pils you may appreciate this oddball brew."
"12 ounce bottle served at 42nd St Oyster bar for $2. I remember when they used to just have Anchor Wheat. I guess at some point they made it a summer seasonal."
"Aroma is slightly grainy with light lemon hints. Very mild overall. First sip reveals a thin brew with rather prickly carbonation. Flavor is mild but some wheat twang is present. The beer is crisp and refreshing but rather devoid of any bold flavors. The finish leaves me wondering where the taste is??"
"This beer poured a bright golden color with a foamy white head. Good amount of lacing along the sides of the glass. The smell has a nice semi-sweet wheat nose to it. The flavors in this beer seem to not really mesh too well together. I notice the wheat malt upfront and maybe a little citrus taste in the background but then that really fades. Spicy hops are in the finish but they seem almost out of place. This beer isn't too smooth and not really exciting either. Nothing to write home about."
"Nice, bright, clear golden color with a light, slightly foamy head. Not much aroma - just clean grain and a whiff of yeast. Nice, clean taste. Crisp malt, with a light hop bite. Nice, full body allows the flavor to linger on the palate. Wish I'd bought more than a single body of this one, it's a great session beer."
"Rather indistinct from any other entry-level American Wheat ale, this beer does little for me. It's clean and cold, but that's about it. I would pass on this in the future."
"Appearance: Golden slightly hazed nice white head leaves nice even lacing down my glass. Aroma: Sharp sweetness with a citrus tone wow, it's not a wit definitely an American wheat ale. Taste: Bready, slight bitter finish not a smooth wheat beer light citrus and wheat flavor but clean. Mouthfeel: Lighter body lacks smooth crispness, high carbonation. Drinkability: Mediocre wheat ale, not my cup of tea at all flavors are blend leaves me wanting more flavor a whole lot more."
"I'm guessing this is probably what a good American pilsener was before Prohibition: some pale malt, some wheat because its cheaper, and whatever hops you could get your hands on."
"Still, I paid for it, so I'll drink the other 5. Hopefully it'll get better."
"This is a very subpar American wheat beer."
"The smell makes me think of a sour and off lager. That didn't detract too much from the taste though. There's almost a hint fruit in there, possibly apricot. It sits well in the mouth and definitely goes down easily."
"When poured in a glass the color was of a light golden yellow with foam that disapates in a couple of seconds. The smell was very shallow. I could pick up a little citrus and hops, but not a really aroma that gets your attention. The taste had a citrus flavor that tasted like a sour lemon. That sourness was not really unpleasant, but sort of a turn off. I personally don't like a citrus/sour flavor when drinking wheat beer. But a nice beer on a hot day after doing yard work!"
"yum yum. great stuff for a warm summer day, this is beer to mow by. I could drink litres."
"I'm enjoying this -- a bright, bright brew. I need to buy a few sixers. Can't imagine a better session brew to match this spring weather."
"More hopped than anticipated (I didn't really smell it). Drier than most wheat beers. If I was blindfolded, I'd probably predict this to be a light American pale ale. This is a pleasant beer but not as a wheat beer; there's very little to notice."
"Notes: Good rendition of a lackluster style."
"poured with a thick rocky white head, a straw color with touch of hazyness. slight hint of malt in the aroma and maybe a hint of some estery/fruity notes in the background. Has a crisp refreshing taste that is nice balance to the slighty watery body. the co2 adds and enhances the refreshing quality of the ale. kinda bummed that these were twist-off bottles though since I like the look of anchor's bottles for my homebrew."
"Big let-down, the other beers from Anchor i've had have been delicious, this basically taste like a bland (but well made) lager, thin, grainy, watery, nothing really really struck a chord with it being a wheat beer either, is this what all American wheats are like? The closest thing to Cascade Summer Blonde i can remember having, only this is a bit better."
"Crystal clear golden, large fluffy white head that diminishes slowly to leave good lacing on the glass. Aroma is light, some slight banana, mild caramel, and a bit of floral hops. Flavor is equally light, mixing the above together in a well-balanced manner. Mouthfeel is crisp, clean, somewhat dry ending. Not really what I was expecting from this brew, but not terrible."
"While not a horrible beer, the smell is not its strong point. It is fairly easy to drink, but I probably won't purchase again. pat"
"A nice golden yellow with a very nice head that left a very nice lace. Smell was weak, and somewhat fruity. Taste was mild, with a slight tartness that was a nice touch. Mouthfeel was light, but somewhat refreshing. Very easy to drink...a nice summer offering."
"A light fruitiness to the aroma, as well as a good amount of floral hop bouquet. Smells lightly wheaty with a bit of grain in the nose. Deep gold color, like a Czech pils, brilliantly clear. Nice clean tasting with a good amount of hop flavor for a wheat beer, accompanied with a light sweetness that finishes the beer off. Light body with a bit of maltiness to it. Nice and refreshing."
"Pours out a hazy golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly thins out but stays till the end and leaves a lace around the glass each time you take a sip. IMO there really isn't much to this brew no strong charcteristics smell or tastes. The little smell that I could pick out was that of wheat and citrus hops. Taste was of citrus hops, a bit of wheat and some floral hops as well. Not a bad brew."
"Pours to a golden color with a thick, chunky white head that looks like dish soap. The aroma is of wheat, with a light fruity hoppiness. The flavor is of wheat, light malt, and spicy, fruity hops. It is a light bodied, smooth beer. An easy drinking summer beer; very refreshing."
"The bottle pours a slightly hazy, brilliant gold body with a light orange cast and a full head of creamy bright white foam. Quite attractive! The head retention is fairly good, and although it eventually drops to just a collar, it does leave some very nice lace about the glass. The nose delivers a distinctly wheat-like malt with some hay and a mild background-note of citrus (lemon). It's crisp and invigorating in the mouth with a very fine and somewhat effervescent carbonation that delicately prickles the tongue and then dissappears, letting the beer glide smoothly down the gullet. Perfect for a refreshing summer beer. The flavor reveals much more lemony character than the nose suggests, wrapped in a blanket of soft and dry wheatish malt. A firm bitterness rises and leads into a dry lingering finish where the citrus receives one more quick turn, and then an almost metallic bitterness engulfs the mouth. A light bodied, dry, and refreshing American wheat."
"Mouthfeel is nice, with a moderate amount of carbonation, and the beer itself is very smooth and light, and although I don't buy into the idea of seaonal beers, I concede this is probably a good one for a hot day, especially considering the flavors only emerge to any degree as it warms a good deal. But it would be better to look for something with a little more character. Overall this is a drinkable beer, possesed of all the attributes which I would look for in a favorite, except that it fails to deliver the most crucial part of the experience, flavor. I suppose its moderate alcohol make it readily and safely consumable in larger quantity."
"Nothing to get terribly excited about in this offering, yet it seems that Anchor is out to ( as the label states) revive not only hearty dark bers, but light, crisp in style, modern American Wheat beers as well. I'm not sure they have revived a style, or if the style: ""modern American wheat beer"" is actually a style?? But, I will say the beer refreshed nicely enough and was certainly light and crisp. It also had the tiniest citrus twang at the tail end and came off as a clean, well made example of what they intended it to be. And, while I've read the reviews saying it did not taste like a German Hefe, and that it was not worth the bother, I must say that while I love German wheat beer, I don't think this is pretending to be one. Further, I'd bet plenty of folk would enjoy this, if not entirely for its simplicity, more than a Hefe. A decent, again, ""lawnmower beer"" I believe, in fact has its place in American culture, and I think that is what was intended here. I think, it is at the very least......worth the bother."
"A pretty bland yet drinkable lightish beer from Anchor. Light gold with a pure white creamy head. Little or no aroma, smooth bland taste but goes good on a warm day. A quaffer for sure but below Anchor's standards in my opinion. Worth being a lawnmower beer."
"Pours a crystal clear golden straw color with a tall and puffy white head that soon fades into a web of sticky lace. Nose is malted wheat with a touch of citrus and is quite clean. Light and crisp in body and texture. Taste starts off with notes of wheat and acidic lemony citrus followed by some bitter and spicy hops that lead to a dry finish. A very refreshing brew that should be a real treat once the heat of the Texas summer gets more intense."
"This pours a clear golden color with a white head. It has a nose with hints of orange and tangerine. It is slightly sweet, yet finishes cleaning. In my opinion, it's a good lawn mower beer. It's a beer like this which allows me to coerce my wife into going out for a pint. She liked it."
"A good looking beer, crystal clear amber with a nice head on top. But, from there on out, I will be disappointed. The first hint was that the aroma did not smell like a wheat beer or ""summery"" beer, I smelled a faint malty odor mixed among the biscuity undertones. The beer is weak in flavor, almost unfresh or sour, reminiscent of a macro. There is a hint of lemon for the summer, I guess. Not an impressive beer from an impressive brewery."
"Translucent golden hue, oodles of animation, excellent clarity, served with a healthy (and long lasting) ¼ inch white head. Loads of lace. Light citrusy nose with hints of floral hops and a note of wheat. The bouquet is rather faint. Decent and refreshing palate, slightly toasty malt infused with citrus notes and flowery hops simple yet enjoyable. Medium-light body. Minimal carbonation. Brief finish, negligible aftertaste... clean. This is very much a summertime thirst quencher. Session brew. Overall, good stuff."
"Light gold color, large foamy head, with a light fruity aroma. A medium bodied wheat beer. Light and refreshing. Does not have the banana and clove taste of most wheat beers. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"This beer poured a crystal clear, bright yellow with a heathy white head. The head lingered for a long time and left a delightful lace on the glass. The aroma of malt was nice but not overpowering. The taste was the biggest disappointment. There was a sour finish that killed the malt and hop combination. The first couple sips I thought was great but soon the sour aftertaste lingered on the roof of my mouth. The mouthfeel was light and the carbonation tingled my tongue. The sourness spoiled an otherwise great beer."
"There is really not a lot to this one. The flavor was lacking. It was very weak. It was crisp and grainy with a few notes of citrus. Although it was fairly boring, it was definitely not a bad beer. It is a great drinker, and it could make a great keg beer for a barbeque. Just don't expect it to get interesting. I warmed up to it after a few, but it was still just good."
"Clear dark gold with a glistening 1/4 inch head of a very white color. Thick ring laces in the glass. Peppery aroma, slight qualities of air freshener. The main initial impression is a leathery malt, slightly sugary but leather-like. Quickly balanced mid mouth by lemony and husky wheat tones and what appears to be decisive hop overtones. Crisp and very tightly balanced beer, however, I just don't like the flavor profile in general. Acidic aftertaste. Interesting, I'll try another when the real summer heat sets in."
"A decent beer. It is pale yellow and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Very refreshing with tastes of grainy mailt and dry and hoppy finish. It has a nice wheat smothness to it. Not much to dig into here but a good summer beer non the less. Could drink this one all day at a barbacue."
"Not a bad beer from Anchor in the style of an American Summer wheat. Poured a straw yellow with a white head which had some very nice lace around the side of the glass. The smell reminded somewhat of dogfood. It was a little too biscuity for me and not balanced enough. The taste was firm and crisp with a refreshing aftertaste. Easily a good summer beer to drink not sip."
"Drinkability/notes: Not as complex as I had expected. Although good by any measure, this beer seems mediocre compared to the other Anchor products. Still, it is quite refreshing."
"Very nice light-flavored wheat beer. An easy drinking and refreshing summer offering. Typically, I'm not a fan of weiss beers, but the ""lightness"" of flavor in this one, minus the weiss yeast that provides the annoying banana and clove characteristics which are usually found in most yeasty weiss beers made this one enjoyable for me."
"A large whipped egg white head sits atop this pale yellow brew. It is just oh so slightly cloudy and the head stays for a while and comes back with a shakin. A weak aroma of wheat is there, and that's about it for nosing it. Watery mouthfeel dissappoints right away. I mean it should be a little bit watery hence the style, but this was just too thin for my preferences. It's oh so too bland, a smidgeon of wheat flavor in the finish is about all there is to enjoy in the flavor department. I must say it's better than a pale lager from the big 3, so there's a plus. There's a certain refreshing quality to it. I might prefer a beer such as this when it's 95 degrees outside. But it won't be for anything more than a refreshing fluid that happens to be a beer."
"Pours a very pale yellow with a thick, foamy, white head composed of large bubbles. The head diminishes slowly with a ""puffy"" cloudlike appearance. Not a bad looking beer. The aroma is very mild. Like the aroma, the flavor and feel are also light and mild. Goes down smooth, a very drinkable beer on a summer day."
"Poured nicely with a clear golden color with huge rocky head,very faint lemony smell but not much in the nose.Kinda citruisy on the palate with some faint smokiness in there,really easy to drink perfect for summer.I probably would by this again on a warm summer day."
"On the pour a translucent golden color, the head prodigious in size, frothy, bright white and as it desiccates, the lace left behind forms a fine covering sheet upon the glass. Malt dominates the nose, sweet, citrus crisp and clean with the start somewhat sweet and top is skeletal. Finish has a spicy yet mild hop presence, acidity moderate and the aftertaste dry, a good session beer any time of the year."
"This was not a bad beer. A nice pilsner like color, not the cloudy style of the last couple wheat beers ive had. It is definately smooth going down. I was thinking this would be a great beer to have at the side of a camp fire on a nice hot night. Worth trying"
"It poured with an abundant head which left lacing as the glass was emptied- all to my liking. The light gold color was surprisingly clear considering the wheat content. The wheat was definately present in the aroma, though this was the pure smell of toasted wheat, without any fruit esters. I presume this is a result of the use of an ale yeast. The taste was clean and reserved, though intricate, characterized most strongly by the toastiness of the wheat. Only the slightest hint of hops was necessary to round out the flavor. The total package was light and refeshing without being in the least boring. Exceptionally drinkable, I look forward to imbibing this brew on a hot, midsummer weekend."
"Pleasant but light aroma with a flowery mix of pale and wheat malts that was also sweet at times. Big full white head like ""whipped egg whites"" (as advertised). Light overall flavor, but refreshing. Impressively low amount of wheat flavor considering it's over ""65%"" wheat malt. Fairly soft mouthfeel and well balanced carbonation. Nice thirst quenching qualities for an ale. This could do very nicely in the summer. Just a little low for wheat flavor, but a good summer ale. It did get a little too bitter as it warmed."
"Pours a very clear gold, slightly cloudy, small but very thick head. Good lace throughout. Initial smell of yeast, perhaps of baked bread. Noticed up front is the taste of malted yeast, just like the label states, with a follow of sour/citrus taste, and a tiny feel of hops left on the palate. Has a bitter, dry feel towards the middle, pretty tasty and this sampled in the middle of winter!"
"Ultimately, a dissappointment."
"Dark golden color with a medium thick slightly off-white head. Strong floral aroma with a faint spice presence. Wheaty, citrusy flavor up front that tapered somewhat by the end. Slightly dry, bitter finish. Not as bland as a lot of summer ales but still kind of lackluster."
"Pours an ultra-clear very different pale yellow/brown if that makes sense.  Has a very large pillowy head that has a tight-bubbled density with staying power.  The smell is grassy and slightly wheaty and mild hops.  It a crisp and clean initial taste that consists of  very light wheat and a bread-like taste and hop bite that starts in the middle and carries to the end.  Very complex for a beer this clear IMO, yet it is very well balanced.  It has a unique mouthfeel that is malty during, but finishes very thin and slightly dry....kinda odd.  But overall a pretty good brew.  It wasn't hot when I tried this, so maybe that's what was missing.  Enjoyed it nonetheless.  Cheers!"
"Musty earthy wheat nose.  Clear gold color with lots of little bubbles.  Creamy white head.  Smooth soft musty malt taste.  It lacks any real complexity.  It is not bad.. just dissapointing.  No real hop or yeast character."
"The label says that, and I quote, ""the head on this beer is unusually abundant, with a consistency similar to egg whites"". They're not kidding, a Massive head on pour, making it difficult for me to get the 12 fl.oz bottle into a Pint Glass on my first attempt. The head eventually settled to a steady 1/4"" but only after leaving the glass with a beautiful lace. An unusual ""summer beer / wheat beer"". Very golden in color, the nose was very feint on my bottle - as was the taste. Clean and light tasting, just too light. Not much mouthfeel and a weak, barely detectable, short-lived bitterness. A good thirst quencher, and a different type of Summer Beer, or an alternative Wheat Beer - however you view this beer, its not mainstream that's for sure. It's not that it's bad, it is a reasonable beer - but it has an identity crisis. To me Summer Beers are hoppier, and Wheat Beers are far more sturdy with citric tones. This is neither, yet purports to be both. I just expected more ""taste"" from this beer, it's a bit ""wimpy"" for a Summer Beer. For me, a dissappointment coming from Anchor."
"Golden yellow body with steady carbonation, topped by a big frothy white bubbly head. Great lacing. Wheat malt in the nose, but not much else, maybe a hint of spiciness.  A tad of lemon in the taste, everything is extremely muted. Not an interesting beer, and in the future I would stay with the Steam or Liberty Ale, which are both fine beers for the summertime."
"Clear golden with a huge white frothy head....nose is of malted wheat...taste is more reminescent of a pilsener to me...very dry finish....tart, lemon like bite...really nothing outstanding sticks out....maybe just not my style of wheat, but really the best things I can say about it is it's clean and crisp..."
"Anchor Summer: light bodies, hazy golden color.  Wheat/light citrus aroma.  Very thin bodied, with minor citrus notes, almost absent is weiss/banana taste that makes a good summer beer.  Not worth the bother."
"This beer poured a light golden color and formed a nice light foamy very white head that faded quickly but left some nice lace.   A medium amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of lemon and lightly of hops.  The flavor was of hops and citrus.  The finish was light and a bit tangy.  Not as good as Anchor's other offerings, but alright summer session brew."
"This clear golden brew throws out a hefty meringue-like head.  Carbonation is very evident by the rapidly rising gaseous bubbles.  There's a nice malted wheat aroma mixed in with some subtle notes of spicy hops.  The taste of this is pretty big on the wheat characteristics.  It also contains nice spicy hop accents.  A lemon tang.  Very refreshing and easy drinking.  A nice change from all of the hefe-weizens out there these days."
"Everything about this beer seemed muted, except for the carbonation.  There were hints of wheat, some mild sweetness and not much in the suspended yeast department.  If this were a beer by most brewers I would think it was pretty solid for what it is, but I was pretty dissappointed with this coming from Anchor... especially at $7.50 a six pack.  If the plan is to dumb down a beer, they should dumb-down the price too.  I do have to say, as far as bottles go, it was a good-looking bottle."
"Big 22 oz bottle...Pours clear straw color, lots of bubbles, fizzy white head. Big grainy smell, very acidic, not much florals, very faint yeast smell. Taste was faintly yeast, mostly grainy, and oddly acidic. The lemon wedge helps this wheat beer into some flavor. Very thin finish. Nothing more than average, which is a dissapointment from Anchor."
