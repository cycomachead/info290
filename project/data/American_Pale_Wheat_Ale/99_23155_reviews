"notes: easy drinking, well made. I could drink this all day."

"The taste is weak but mostly adjuncts of corn or rice. Faint touches of lemon or citrus hit the tongue but they are fleeting and almost imperceptible. I'm very disappointed in this entry as Saranacs are usually a lot of fun and tasty."

"O - Nice beer for a barbecue or a warm summer day."
"Overall: Not as good as some other summer ales I have had but definitely satisfying at the BBQ, Salud!"

"O: It is decent for what it is. It is nothing spectacular, but nothing that is bad."
""
"12oz bottle from the Summer mix pack. Pours a semi translucent dark straw color with no head. Virtually no lacing. Aromas of wheat, lemon, malts and a bit floral. The taste is mostly wheat along with some lemon in the background. Some floral and orange notes as well. A bit of a soapy finish. Light mouthfeel. Overall, its an ok summer beer."

"Light bodied with a crisp, spicy hop bite up front that lingers over the yeast, light fruit and pale malt notes into a slightly dry finish. Subtle dry bitterness with some grassy, floral hops countered by light fruit sweetness and subtle biscuit flavored malt. Not overly complex but it's crisp and refreshing with some nice hop flavor. A nice beer on this 100+ degree day."

"Watery and bland, super thin body. A true ticker's beer; I've definitely had worse."

"Poured a bright golden color, with a decent cap of bubbly off-white foam. Aromas of floral hops, somewhat grassy, bubblegum and biscuit. On the palate, this one was light to medium bodied, with flavors of good hops, as well as some pears, peaches and biscuit malt."
"O/D-Seemed like it was going to be a superior bore at first, but the flavor isn't half bad. Summer beers usually don't rock. This one is a mediocre summer beer. Therefore it is not that great in my book, but there is something about it that maintains my interest...At least for the first bottle."
"D: American wheat with Wit-esque riffs – but it doesn’t work. Not blended & melded, but rather angular and constructed. Not proportional and balanced. Comes across as overly gimmicky in the lemon direction. Could be improved with more orange citrus, some character and robustness to malts, and less lemon."
"Not the most flavorful of beers but it drinks pretty nicely on a hot summer day. Got it in the summer 12pack for $10. A bit too heavy on the lemon flavor but I can see what they were going for."
"O: No joy here. Just really bland. Have yet to meet a Saranac that really does anything for me. Maybe next time."
"Pours a relatively clean amber, small pillowy head with decent retention. Scent is quite off from what most pale wheats typically smell like, the lemon is there, but the backbone screams of poor quality malts (or even adjuncts) and stale hops, very little wheat character. Taste is a little more focused, lacks much malt flavor, a little bit of staleness rescued by some citrus notes. Under carbonated for the style, comes across as medium in body. Not your typical pale wheat, some minor off notes stand out a tad more then they should. Not bad, but not something I need to sample again."
"This beer is mediocre at best."
"Overall there isn't much here. I have a feeling this is just another one of those breweries that are scared to put out a bold product. Like Boulder Beer and BJ's Pizza. Too bad"
"Nice light mouthfeel and an easy drinker. It didn't hit the spot, but it was nice on a hot day."
"D - Pretty tasty, while drinking it I was actually not sure if it was a pale wheat or a pils, but regardless I really enjoyed it and look forward to having another."
"Carbonation, fizziness and a medium body. OK on the beach on a hot day but that is about it."
"overall a decent beer but i just didn't get excited about it"
"I liked it better than Sam Adams Summer Ale."
"O: Tangy and a little citric. Very mild to the point of boredom. 3"
"Thanks to woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is sweet, malts and grains. Taste is crisp, some citrus and grains, a bit on the sweet side. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking summer beer."
"O-wouldn't recommend, there's just not much positive, it's lightish, has a funky aftertaste and I don't think I'll revisit it again"
"The Crack & Glug was yet another reminder as to why it is important to deCANt: not only did I get two fluffy fingers of bone-white head, but it looked like summer in a glass. Color was a beautiful sunshine yellow with NE-quality clarity. Couple that with the cloud-like head and you have a summer's day. I am a visual beer guy, I suppose. Nose had a metallic aspect to it. Uh oh. Fortunately, the smell did not translate to the taste. Mouthfeel was on the thin side and the flavor was big on lemon, which were probably the natural flavors alluded to earlier. It was a pretty mellow drink, as wheat beers are wont to be, finishing with a light zestiness, making it quite refreshing. I probably would not want more than one, but if I were accompanied by someone who really likes this sort of thing, it would be in my cooler."
"D: a miss for me. the citrus and fruit seems too forced to be enjoyable and I am not finding this a ‘refreshing’ summer beer as I thought I would."
"Really wanted to like this beer more. The lemon flavor is just too strong. Decent base beer, but wanted more."
"Cheers!!!"
"If kids still had lemonade stands and sold this, the world would be a better place."
"Taste-Wheat, faint lemon peel,spice, orange pel note. Light-bodied, crisp and refreshing, but lacking any great depth of character. A decent ""no-brainer"" brew to be had on a hot summer day."
"O - This was in the summer 12 pack I purchased so I'll have another one to mull over. It's very average and there are better choices out there within a similar price range."
"O-Not a bad example of a summer beer but the wheat profile could have been better."
"Pretty average stuff. Just wish it would have kept up the taste throughout the beer."
"O- This seems like a decent beer ruined by the lemon addition. I think the trend in my taste is to like Saranac's base beers, but any time they add fruit, it doesn't mesh well. Generally would advise against this one, though it is refreshing enough."
"Drinkability: SSA reminds me a bit of Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat (minus the Fruity Pebbles kick, natch). One to pound after mowing the lawn, or pound while out at the lake with friends, or not drink at all. I think I know which option I'll go for. I see a few notations of people wanting to call this a witbier, but, come on, let's not be hasty. At the very best, it's like a weird, creepy distant cousin the rest of the proud Witbier Family never calls, doesn't accept FB friend requests from, or responds to requests to ""borrow"" money."
"D. I like this better that the sam adams or brooklyn summer ale and would definitely buy a 12 pack when the weather turns around."
"Finally almost done with the Saranac Summer pack. Jesus, it's taking me way the hell too long... Anyway, this one pours a clear pale golden straw topped by a half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises coriander, orange and lemon zests, and a good amount of wheat. The taste runs along a very similar course, but with more wheat and some sharp flowers thrown in. The fruitier notes are decidedly toned down, mere shadows of their nasal selves. The body is quite light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp, clean finish. Overall, an okay brew, but one that really doesn't endear itself to me. As mild as it is, I still can't see myself wanting to drink much more of this. Maybe it's too mild, I dunno."
"This is ok, but thin of character, simple, and crude. It offers so little that it quickly becomes tiresome."
"D: Refreshing yet not quite there for a summer beer. Lemon flavors work well but it still seems a bit boring."
"A somewhat decent summer ale. You can do better or worse."
"D- I guess you could drink one pretty quickly on a really warm day. I do not want this near my lips at all with the superior variety of summer beers on the market."
"Tastes like lemon more than anything. I guess relatively speaking, its a decent Saranac brew, it tastes like something that isn't offensive for once, and its actually assertive. Don't necessarily know that I want the flavor they decide to get assertive with be lemon, but its a start. There really isn't much else to talk about, lemon dominates. Too expensive to be drinkable, too sour and sweet one dimensional lemony as well."
"This beer is getting low marks because it doesn't resemble a beer - more like an energy drink. That being said, it doesn't taste bad, and I wouldn't mind drinking one of these during an outdoor BBQ while playing volleyball"
"Pale yellow (colored with caramel) with a fluffy white head that shrinks to a skim fairly quickly. Lemon peel and coriander stand out bigtime in the aroma with a fresh breadiness. Lemon and coriander with a mild wheat malt tang? Yup, this beer is just a filtered Wit beer with caramel coloring added, it's not really bad it's just misclassified. Light bodied with plenty of carbonation. A pretty run of the mill Wit unless you love lemon flavor because this brew delivers that."
"Brown bottle with no indication of freshness poured into a weizen glass. Appears a light yellow color with a bit of haze from a pour that included a few drips of sediment from the bottom of the bottle. Less than a finger of white head appears and doesn't hang around long. Light bready and caramel aroma with plenty of lemon zest and spice almost like cinnamon that carries over into the flavor. Taste includes caramel malt like sweetness blended with the seemingly fake lemony flavor and a slight touch of hop bitterness. There is an aftertaste of lemon and spice left lingering in the mouth that doesn't really blend all that well with the caramel like sweetness from the malt. Light feel with a modest level of carbonation. This is another offering that would best be enjoyed after sweating it up in the heat and just drinking without savoring any flavor. This isn't something I would try again."
"Flavor is rather simple and straightforward with a light lemony wheat flavor. Feel is only lightly coarse in texture yet not overly sweet either, making for a decent drink overall but with a subdued character."
"D - Well it's kind of good I got 4 because this made Samuel Adams summer beer seem like it had more flavor which it did not. Pretty good if it's an alternative to BMC since it's in a case at a mere 24 dollars with tax. Pretty drinkable."
"D: Drinkable, but I'm already bored halfway through. Simply needs more flavour."
"Saranac Summer Ale pours a light gold with a small but lasting head. The aroma is dominated by slightly grainy malted wheat with a hint of corriander. More crisp, kind of sweet wheat in the flavor. The crisp, grainy wheat flavor gives way to a tangy, almost slightly sour flavor that lingers in the after taste. I just noticed on the label that there is a lemon flavor added to the beer, but I probably wouldn't have picked it out. The bitterness is subdued, as is any hop flavor."
"D. Overall not very special. However a decent refreshing summeer brew."
"This beer is pretty easy going down and is pretty smooth. It does have some carbonation but does not hinder the drink-ability of this beer. A good summer beer but not groundbreaking."
"Comments: Certainly not to style, but a decent wheat ale beginner's beer. This beer has no faults, but no highlights either."
"Mouthfeel is actually somewhat decent with minimal carbonation. Not really your best Saranac you can have. if you buy the Summer Pack, give the two Summer Ales to someone else who might want some variety from their assumable macro."
"Comes across as kind of a Kolsch and Wit combo. Nice."
"This beer's orange color is fitting with the citrus smell and taste that I picked up after I poured a bottle into a pint glass. Effervescence is present as in all Saranac's I've tasted and beer is very drinkable."
"Poured a clear orange color with a generous head that rapidly dissolved to a collar. The aroma had a soapy scent to it. The taste was lemony. The feel was light bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was very good. A good beer, one that probably made the best use of lemon in a beer that I have had. That being said, I think that may be the reason a lot of the great beers don't rely on a lemon taste. Still liked it though."
"The mouth is crisp and refreshing. Flavor is pretty good. A nice tame mellow bready flavor. This is definitely one of the sweeter Wheat Ales I've had, but I like it. This would be a great refresher during the warm months. I'm never expecting a lot with Saranac beers, but I am always pleasantly surprised."
"It has a good copper color. Unfortunately it's got coloring added to it. Odd. The aroma is nice of sweet malt and honey. Wow, it's a sweet brew. Honey. Malt. Sugar. Mid tongue the bitterness starts to kick in. A good punch of lemon and orange. And some hop bite. It really helps clean the palate. A good brew for a hot day and a barbecue. I find it to be a bit too sweet up front. But certainly a good choice."
"drinkability: very enjoyable beer for a hot and humid."
"Overall, not as horrific as it could have been, but not something I'd want again. Too much lemon up front, and not done in a way that is a compliment to the rest of the brew. The true dud in the summer mix pack."
"Light bodied and high carbonation makes for a drinkable beer, if you can get past the lemon and spice. I think it's a bit too overwhelming, so I will most-likely abstain from this in the future."
"I am not sure what happened to this beer, but, whatever it is, a correction seems necessary, forthwith."
"Drinkability: I'll pass on the next one, I offered this to my Bud Light Lime drinking brother and he actually enjoyed it. Good riddance, I'd hate to drain pour this cause it's not that bad but it's definetley not for me."
"D) Just average. Not much to it. It's wet and refreshing."
"Pours a golden color with a slight head, maybe one finger that gives way quickly. There is very little carbonation to be seen through the glass. The smell is at first lemon but it gives way to a floral aroma almost carnation like. The taste is floral with a hint of lemon at the end. The taste is a little more complex than I thought with my first one. The mouthfeel is dry. The drinkability is a little different. The first time I had this beer I wasn't impressed with it. After having it a couple weeks later in a glass the taste doesn't seem as harsh of lemons as before and the taste seems much more balanced. After second review I would say the drinkability on this beer is high."
"Bottle. Pours a clear light orange with a small white head. Aroma of bready malt, wheat, light fruits (cherry, raspberry), and some spices (allspice?). Flavor is sweet and malty with lots of dough notes and spices. Slightly on the sweet side but definitely an interesting wheat. Nice beer!"
"D-Low ABV + refreshing, lemon zing + light, crisp body = a worthy summer session beer that would push any BMC offering off the table."
"Overall: I often wonder where beer stops and fruity chemical concoctions begin. Is there a certain percentage of malt that needs to be used in order to have a product worth being called a ""beer?""When the fine print on a bottle reads ""Beer brewed with natural flavors and colored with caramel"" one has to wonder ""What is this?"" My roots as a brewer tells me that you don't need to add caramel for color when you could have added some crystal malts to get this beverage to the medium gold that it currently is. However, my business side says: ""if I were trying to sell beer to the tasteless masses and go with the current trends (i.e. Bud Lime/Miller Chill) then I would make a fruity watered down beverage like this. But I like beer, and this just doesn't work for me. Saranac, from my perspective, is a company on the brink of becoming a really good brewer. When they do things like this it sets them back a few steps. I hope they can brush this one off and move forward by making real beer from this point forward."
"overall - a Good idea for a summer thirst quencher. I could easily enjoy a few cold ones on a hot day. I'd call it a lawnmower beer, but we hire landscapers. So it's an outdoor summer drinking beer. Yeah, that should do."
"This beer pours a straw color with a mild honey nose. Wispy head of light lacing. Thick and full mouthfeel. Very enjoyable in the mouth. A clean attack that gives a touch of lemon and some citrus notes in the flavor. The finish is a bit fruity but cleans up to not allow any lingering aftertaste from the fruit notes. I am not normally a big fan of summer ales, but I truly enjoyed this one. Definitely one of the better summer offerings that is readily available and widely distributed."
"Drinkability: Its sweet but gassy, crisp but watery, strong nose but flavorless. It feels like it is missing something."
"D-Very drinkable on a warm day. You are not here for taste, as much as for a quencher."
"It works well on a very hot day but beyond that it is really kind of average."
"Drink is unenjoyable I almost had a drainpour but I couldn't bring myself to do it."
"D: Very quaffable, this would be excellent on a hot, muggy day."
"Thumbs up on the Saranac 12 beers of summer pack. I have officially justified impulse shopping!"
"Overall- Light and mellow but a decent drinker."
"Alright, but nothing special.  Really, I would probably play it safe and just stick to a Sam Adams Summer Ale if I were presented with the choice between the two."
"12 oz bottle poured into a shaker glass. Appears a crystal clear bright yellow color with a finger of quickly fading bone white foam. Smells and taste is over run with citrus, mainly lemon peel. Tastes a tad artificial to me (pledge-like). Notes of grass, and lightly toasted grains are also present. A bit thin bodied with modest carbonation."
"If they could reduce the tartness, this would be much more drinkable. Given its current state, I'd hesitate to have too many of these."
"(rated May 8, 2007)"
"Smooth soft summer beer."
"12 oz. bottle from summer mix pack. Pours a sparkling golden yellow color with an extremely thin white head, little to no lacing. Aroma is initial lemon zest, crisp light/wheat malt, and maybe clove. Flavor is fairly plain, pale malts, lemon, a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel is crisp, fairly carbonated. Overall a very drinkable beer, but not great."
"One of the better offerings from the summer mixed pack but still doesn't compare to the other micros. Has a bit of a lemony and citrusy taste to make it 'summer' like, but overall its a beer that is lacking on body and overall taste. Would try again though."
"Thin, clear golden orange-yellow body with a sudsy white head settling atop a Hoegaarden tumbler--why so much plaer than the Belgian white? the head leaves a slight tracing as the bottle drains... straw and lemon zest to the nose... a bit of pilsner malt plays a part as well... a freshness does exist here... softer yet more astringent than the Belgian in the sampler... malts provide a semblance of a body, but this is still light (purposefully, I imagine) and buttery/creamy on the finish... the malts rush the flavors straight back to the throat--a soft ale exists somewhere in this wheatness... this provides a nice feeling for summer, even if August in NJ has been unseasonably Autmumnal... shorter on hops to increase its drinkability, no doubt, this ale seems to attempt the ""sparkling"" aspect of a Cooper's perhaps... not bad, but flavor is elusive..."
"Overall I'm a little disappointed with Saranac's summer beer mix pack. This was one of the better ones from the bunch, but it's still merely average. Pours a copper color, practically no head or lacing on the glass. Doesn't have that cloudy, hazy look that most wheat beers I've tried had. There is a rather strong lemon zing in there for quite the summer effect. Not much else though, the lemon stands out and is a little too much, even for the summer. The bottle says the lemon hints are subtle but don't be fooled by that."
"Drinkability- Not a bad little summer beer."
"D. A dry spicy summer brew that would quench your thirst on a summer afternoon. I would not turn one down if offered."
"A seethru auburn-tinted gold with a two-finger head that died instantly and left a minor lace ring. A somewhat odd smell of of cherries and caramel...I have no idea why that comes across my nose but that's what I'm picking up with some minor clove/pepper hints and citric hops. A dull, lifeless citric taste with a fluffy but empty medium body. Has some spiciness to it with a crisp backbite, but not really a great beer. Of the six beers in the Saranac Summer Sampler this one seems undeveloped...it is missing something."
"A very typical summer ale, nothing stood out for me. Surprisingly the other 5 beers in the mixed party pack seemed a lot more worthy of being called summer ales than this one. It was decent, very refreshing and smooth. Just not a lot of flavors coming out. Looks like they played the safe route on this one. I wont being trying this again although it was decent."
"Nice drink, pretty ho-hum."
"D - Refreshing... I'm not a big fan of ""summer brews," but this one isn't too shabby and has some redeeming qualities... A little more aroma and taste would have helped out..."
"The final beer out of my Saranac Summer mix pack. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark golden orange color with a nice off-white head. The aroma is sweet floral malt and a touch of citrus. The taste has some notable wheat flavors with a hint of citrus and hops in the finish. Overall, Saranac Summer Ale accomplishes what it sets out to be, a refreshing and easy drinking beer to enjoy during the warm summer months. Not overly flavorful, but refreshing."
"Medium oily-looking amber-gold, smallish lasting head...grainy, lightly sour nose with hints of fruit...refreshing tart, crisp flavor profile, hints of toasty malt underneath and a touch of smokiness late...light-moderate body, tiny swirls of tart apple in nose and flavor as it warms."
"A good beer for the summer without sacrificing alot of taste."
"Drinkability: Having one or two with a dinner would work fine, but not sure about a full six-pack."
"D - I'm pretty impressed by this beer as far as summer ales go, but the weird mouthfeel and a lingering sweetness limit this beer's drinkability."
"This beer poured a copper color with a single-finger head that lingered. The smell is some malt with some wheat notes and a little bit of hops. The taste starts off some sweet malt that gives way to a little bit of hops and some citrus. The mouthfeel is not watery, but doesn't seem to have too much substance to it. I'd consider this beer to be pretty drinkable, and makes for some decent summer fare on a hot day."
"D. Quite drinkable, good for a hot summer day."
"D: The spices are nice at first but it doesn't take long to get enough. Nice but not something I would drink often."
"It has a clear filtered body that is golden color. Its head is white, bubbly and fades fast. The aroma is light and has a lemony essence. Its flavor is simple, sweet and lemony with light wheat malt. The body is medium with a slightly slick feel and an average carbonation. Overall it is a very refreshing ale with a clean flavor."
"Appears a clear golden honey hue with a large amount of white head that dwindles quickly, lacing is scant and thin. Aroma tart lemon peel with spiciness and thick grainy edges. Flavor is a bit rough on the back of the throat with that cereal graininess and lemon zest flow, thick spices left on the palate in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied carbonation is heavy to point of it gives you trouble when going to swallow. Drinkability is not so great I'd much rather have a nice golden ale rather than lemon flavor and strong spices added. Those two aspects take away from the drinkability factor."
"If you like spices and heartburn, you'll like this. If you like beer, stay away."
"Pours a golden yellow with a short and medium bodied white head that settles fast and leaves some lacing down the glass. The aroma is of sweet malts, some citrisy flavors, and a small amount of hoppy bitterness at the end of the nose. The taste is of sweet wheat malts underneath a lemony and slightly orangey taste followed by a slightly hoppy bitter finish that is nice. The mouthfeel for this beer is very crisp and refreshing which makes it a decent summer beer but I think it falls a bit short of some of the other ones out there. The drinkability is good as it is a very light and drinkable summer beer."
"D: I got the 12 summers of beer pack and each one is letting me down. Not a terrible beer and it is super drinkable. Guess I am just spoiled."
"Pours a clear orange gold with a two finger white head that falls fairly slowly. Nose is like oranges. Flavor is way too tangy, unbalanced, and there seems to be a grassy end to it. Feel is like a bit of syrup almost. Decent carbonation, but what does it matter at this point. Overall, not really drinkable I'd say. Unbalanced and not even. Just isn't that good."
"12 oz. with no freshness date; brewed with lemon, spices, and colored with caramel - not sure why. It pours a very lightly-clouded, medium gold hue, with light carbonation, and a half-inch of off white head that almost completely fades away. Hints of wheat in the nose, with lemon, coriander, hints of ginger or cardamom, and a floral spiciness. Flavor is very much the same, with summery (lemon, coriander) and wintery (ginger, cardamom) flavors, along with a floral spiciness, mild bitterness, and tart wheat that emerges halfway through. It has a crisp, tingly, light body that is drying and imparts a short finish. Not too bad for a summer ale, but not especially worth seeking out."
"An average beer. A nice light summer salad to go with this one. Taste and aroma are nice but just not strong enough. Filler against others in the mixed pack."
"Poured a yellow/golden color with a slight haze to it. Head was small and very fleeting. Aroma was quite citrusy, lemon was most evident. Taste was also very lemony. Very smooth drinking with a light carbonation. Very refreshing. Nothing spectacular, but drinkability is fairly good."
"Tastes of citrus, wheat, I cant pick up any hops. A refreshing beer to have on a hot summer day."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a very slightly hazy medium light copper wit a 2 finger head, OK longevity and just OK lace. Decent wheat malt aroma mixed with some citrus and yeast notes. Not as much malt flavor as the smell would lead you to believe. OK hop flavor mixed with some bitterness although too much for a wheat ale IMHO. Leaves a funny sort of aftertaste - part hop part wheat malt but mixed in a weird unpleasant way. Initially its not a bad beer but then the aftertaste kicks in and ruins it."
"Overall this could be a great beer to drink a ton of on a hot day, however if you are just sipping to enjoy it is lacking alot. It really was kinda bland for that purpose, but I will enjoy it when I mow the lawn agaon for sure."
"Pours a pale golden color with about a half finger of head that quickly dissipates and leaves little lacing. Aroma is predominantly of lemons but more than pine sol than actual lemons with some yeast and other fruity esters. Taste is like the aroma. First there is a nice wheat flavor with lemons in the background. Then the pine sol like lemon flavor rears its head and builds into the finish reaching its zenith at the very end of the finish. Mouthfeel is decent, low-medium body with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is average at best. The somewhat harsh lemon flavor does nothing to make me want another one of these. Aside from that flaw this is a decent beer that I'd be willing to revisit."
"D - This is a pretty good wheat beer. Has a nice hop character that some beers of this style usually lack."
"Really enjoyed this one. Poured into glass a golden yellow. Nice white head that sticks around a bit. Smells of lemon and wheat. Tastes of lemon. Sweet but not sickening sweet. Nicely carbonated. Could enjoy several in a sitting. Good summertime brew."
"Pours a mostly clear, medium straw color with some orange tones. A nice half inch of pure white head forms with good staying power. Aromas of orange, some spice (coriander, allspice), berries, and a nice fresh wheat stalk. On the palate, the subtle estery spices blend well with the flavors added. It is a medium bodied wheat, with a nice full mouthfeel, good carbonation and a slight sweet finish. This is perhaps the most enjoyable of the summer 12 pack, but still not anything I'd purchase in the future."
"Clear yellow gold. Thin head quickly dissolves to a spare ring. Perfumey lemon candy aroma. Flavors of lemon sweetness and wheaty grain with a hint of coriander. Light bodied, semi-crisp mouthfeel gets the job done. Refreshing and decent but far from memorable."
"This all led to a short, stale finish that did NOT leave me wanting more."
"Rather thin-bodied with a sweet finish. Very refreshing."
"Summary- The light mouthfeel and lemony flavor cetainly help to sell this as a summer ale, however the moderate flavor of wheat malt drags down its refreshingness. While it would be good in a neutral indoor setting or bar, this is not the best bottle to reach for beside the pool or after mowing the lawn. Works as a light, lemony ale, but gives mixed feelings as a summer brew."
"DA: These are great for summer time, easily drinkable and rather refreshing but a bit less emphasis on spices would be nice."
"D: Very good. This went down pretty quickly and in fact it picked up steam after a few sips. A solid summer beer; probably the best of their 2007 summer sampler 12-pack so far."
"The sad reality is that in a blind taste test of all the Saranac summer beers, there is not that much to distinguish any of them. This is perhaps their best one of the summer variety pack. There is some interesting spices, some lemony citrus, a nice balance, light body, and good carbonation. The smell isn't great but the taste is slightly better than some of the others, particularly that god awful Belgian White in the variety pack. This is still a pretty mediocre beer, very light, very uninteresting, but refreshing with a light mouthfeel and no real aftertaste. If you are looking for hops, you won't find much in this beer. I was hoping for more from Saranac. This is my 6th and final beer from their summer selection and I can say that it has been a disappointing excursion with this Utica brewhouse."
"Don't know what they are trying to do here - goes towards a wit a some point, but the spice is too muted and yeast strain too weak. It just seems off - there are much better summer refreshers out there."
"An OK beer but not one I will seek out, it just isn't remarkable."
"An average Wit, wrongly categorized as an American Pale Wheat. Not a bad refreshing, summer offering."
"D-too much coriander and citrus. At least they went bold here. 3"
"Pours a pale color with minimal carbonation. Aroma is one of wheat with some fruitiness. Taste is much of the same except that there's more of a fruitiness with a decent wheat finish. It actually reminds me of berries or something. Pretty decent for a summer ale."
"D: It's okay, gets the job done, but I would not choose it if it wasn't in a variety pack."
"Worth a try when you're looking for refreshment."
"This one pours a golden orange with a frothy white head that sticks around for awhile. The smell is mostly citrus with lemon and notes of wheat. The bottle says to look for subtle hints of lemon, I wouldn't say the lemon is very subtle, it drives the flavor of this beer but isn't overpowering. The tastes starts citrus and ends with the wheat flavor. It is a light, crisp, and refreshing beer with a decent mouthfeel. This is another easy drinker from the summer pack. Good flavor and taste, a beer worth checking out."
"Pours a clear golden color with a sub-par head, dissipated quickly, no lacing. This offering does actually have a smell to it. It has a kind of funk corriander, orange peel smell, I'm not a big fan of this smell but some may like it. It has a weird corriander lemon flavor that doesn't fit well together. It tastes like funk. Again some may like this but it doesn't sit well with me. Seems to be a cross between a witbier and a traditional summer ale. The feel is fizzy and crisp. This would be a refreshing brew if you like the taste."
"All in all, this is a pretty good summer ale."
"Cheers!"
"This beer is from the ""12 Beers of Summer"" pack. The beer pours a clear gold color, with an inch white head which goes away quickly. It smells like lemon, malt, wheat, hops and a bit of spicyness. It tastes the same way it smells, but the lemon taste is the strongest. Mouthfeel is light/medium, but not watery at all. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth, crisp and very easy to drink. Overall I was impressed with this brew, it's very sessionable and would be a great choice on a hot day."
"D - overall a very nice beer at a very reasonable price. I'd take this over a lot of other micro ""summer"" beers and any macro out there."
"Steve"
"Whoooo ! I am an Initiate now."
"Pours a clear golden. Thin white head. not much retention,but good lacing. Smell is lemon,and spice. Body id light,and carbonated. Taste is light and lemony. There is a nice spice flavor through out and some hops in th finish. Good summer ale. I'll have it again for sure."
"D - The Summer ale is probably the most drinkable of the ""Twelve Beers of Summer"" mix-pack that Saranac offers around this time of the year. Unlike the rest of its counterparts, it does have a reasonably individual character that, while slightly phenolic, is at least more interesting than the slightly below to average offerings of various other wheat styles."
"The brew poured to a golden color with a nice sized white head that had some good retention while leaving a little lace around the top of the glass. The aromas while not over whelming are very pleasant with a wheat scent and a solid lemon zest making this an inviting brew. The taste, while not extraordinary, is quite good with its wheat flavors mixed with lemon highlights and a spiciness that brings things together well. As can be expected the feel is quite refreshing and light but has some real nice flavors. I can imagine that this brew will be quite refreshing during the warmer months. Once again a good brew from F.X. Matts, middle of the road but a solid offering with a high drinkability."
"This is not a good thing."
"This brew was one of my favorites in the mix pack. I wish I could get six-packs of this. It's has very soft flavors which makes it extremely drinkable."
"D: It goes down easily and isnt very filling, a little tasty but I would consider it a stretch to call this beer mediocre. There are many others I would choose first in the style."
"A nice summer beer kind of like a saison with wheat."
"Light mouthfeel is fine for the season. Drinkability impaired by the lack of ""symphony"" of the various elements. Lot of solos, but this band isn't playing together."
"Summer Ale is one of the better offerings from The Matt Brewing Company. Of course, their lineup doesn't exactly stand out in my memory. I'm not sure why it's classfied as an APWA when, to my nose and palate at least, it's clearly a wit. Yet another addition to my growing list of refreshing, locally available 'lawnmower' brews."
"Honeyed gold. One finger dirty white head of small bubbles that slowly settles to a skim coat and a modest collar, depositing no lace. Swirling lines of active and slow carbonation, consisting of a mixture of both fine and large bubbles. Wheaty, lemon rind and fresh cut lemon flesh aromas. Smells almost like lemonade. Some light spices, maybe coriander, meld with a slightly sweet lemon juice. A faint wheatiness underlies the body and the finish is a mix of soft grassy hops and gently crisp lemonish note which does not last too long. The slightly grassy flavor lingers just a moment longer. Medium-light body with some zippy carbonation, this feels appropriate and a bit refreshing. Overly non-distinctive, but moderately enjoyable nonetheless."
"The taste was good, mouthfeel average, but the drinkability was very high, It was hot i was thirsty. and it is gone just like that, crisp, clean and enjoyable. Not bad for what it is"
"Pours a clear, yellow gold with a thin head of white bubbles. Lemon zest in the nose. Taste is sweet then fades quickly into the lemon zest. Little to no aftertaste. Body actually seems a bit heavy compared to the others in the summer pack. Inoffensive, clean beer. A great summer pack, especially for those just starting into craft beer."
"Pours clear light gold with a slightly yellow 2-finger head, low retention with sudsy lacing. Mellow banana wheat, cloves, citrus in the nose. Microbubbly carbonation with lemon zest on the tip of the tongue, bananas washing over the rest, with cloves. Medium body but fluffy. Goes down crisp and refreshing, if not entirely bland. Easy-going and easily quaffable, just not all that interesting."
"Pours a clear pale amber color with a thin off-white head with little retention and minimal lacing. The aroma has some citrus and malt in it. Light-bodied with light wheat, spice and fruit flavors. The finish is sweet with hints of malt and citrus. All in all this is an average beer like everything else I have tried from Saranac."
"This was one of my least favourites from the Summer Pack. It's not bad, just run of the mill overall."
"I guess if there's nothing else around, this American Wheat can sub for a Corona, or a Miller Light but don't expect to wowed."
" Tasty and easy to drink with notes of banana, clove, berry, and mild hops. Slightly too much carbonation but palateable enough. This is drinkable and quenching stuff, not outstanding but a good effort from Saranac nonetheless."
"Yes, it is a simple attempt at a confined style that has fake color and flavorings -- that said, it is tasty and flows down the gullet, so ha."
"Easy summer ale to suck down, ive had better summer ales though"
"A fairly run of the mill summer beer. Nice orange, clear color. head impressive for a minute, then fades rapidly to lacing around the top of the glass. Just a little more taste than the average lager with a bit of a citrus taste added. Mouthfeel is ""ok", not real watery but not that rich either. Very average. The Golden Pilsner and the Hefe are the winners in the Summer sampler, with the Kolsch running just behind."
"Part of a summer sampler 12 pack. Some hits, some misses. This was an OK beer, but nothing really special. It was a clear orange color with a medium head that retained pretty well. Not much aroma, a little grain detected. Not much taste, some citrus and a little bit of spice. It is drinkable in the sense of downing a few on a really hot summer day."
"Very light and crisp and very drinkable on a hot summer night."
"D-I'd still rather have this beer than a bud but by no means would I seek it out"
"Yet another Saranac disappointment!"
"Body is medium, well carbonated, and has a crisp texture. Excellent drinkability. For the price, this is a decent beer here."
"I have to take away a little on the drinkability because of that medicinal twang. It hit me as a little too odd to be pleasant."
"This would be a good summer brew to keep on hand. Poured out to a deep sunset orange color with a small white foam head. No lacing noted. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of sweet grain and citrus. Taste is crisp and refreshing; flavors of citrus (especially lemon) jump forward, with spices and fresh hops in the background. Nice. Mouthfeel was slightly zesty with a smoothness accentuated by the hops. Pretty good drinkability for the summer months. I'd have no qualm about having this in the fridge. Worth a try. Thanks to connecticutpoet for the sample."
"Drinkability: I give it a 3 because I could see myself grabbing one of these instead of some light macro out of a cooler with friends grilling burgers and dogs in the July heat. Otherwise, as far as sitting down and reviewing this sucker or partaking in the aforementioned activities (though I don't think any of my friends would randomly have Saranac in a cooler, though that's beside the point), the tasting's not gonna happen again..."
"Pours a clear, light amber with a small, very slightly off-white, foamy head the quickly diminishes to a light film. Very little lacing. It has a sweet smell of wheat and malt, a strong lemon scent and a little honey and something herbal (kind of like marjoram). The taste is very sweet with typical wheat flavors (including coriander), some malts and hardly any hops. The finish is very lemony, kind of like dish soap. It has a medium-light body and a dry texture. I find the lemon to be too strong and distracting, not that its distracting me from an otherwise decent beer. Not horrible, but sub-par beer and a disappointment."
"Pours a very clear dark gold. About of finger and a half of creamy white head that quickly drops to a thin cap leaving weak lacing. Strong wheat nose with a distinctive scents of lemon,coriander, and a sweet aroma- probably the caramel used for coloring. Phenolic wheat and cirtus spice flavor jumps out initialy, followed by strong yeast aftertaste. Hop flavor is scarce, but the wheat and spice flavor balance out for a nice mild bitterness and clean finish. Medium body and well carbonated. An excellent session brew, with a smooth but interesting flavor, but would score higher if left unfiltered and rated as a Hefe-wiezen."
"Tasted: 09/21/05"
"D - If you like lemon pepper chicken...I mean really like it then this is for you."
"It was just overly ordinary for a Saranac but not ~bad~. Poured a bit more orange that I expected and was champagne bubbly for a moment. Thin fading bleached-white head. Sweet citrus on the nose, very light, fleeting. Citrus and some sort of spice that reminded me of that Indian spice that they glaze with sugar and snack on (I can't recall the name). No real aftertaste. OK mouthfeel."
"D- I could barely down on bottle and I am certainly not going for a second. This is like a Belgian Wit gone wrong."
"Worth a try, interesting summer offering."
"Matt Brewing did not hit this one on the head."
"Poured out a clear light gold color with a decent head. Smell was mostly citrus with nothing else coming through. Very one sided on the aroma side. Taste wasn't any better either. A ton of lemon flavors with some citrus and wheat flavors also coming through. Light amount of malts underly the citrus flavors. Mouthfeel was light and finished dry and peppery. Where are they leading to with this beer? Heck, add some coriander and we'll almost have a wit. Just a complete mess with this beer. Very sloppy."
"Pours a dark hazy yellowish orange with a cap of bright white head. Lemon, malt, and a faint whiff of floral hops on the nose. Very malty, wheaty taste upfront followed by a surpisingly large floral bitter taste. Light lemon permeates everything. Medium bodied with a fairly low carbonation level, this is a pretty smooth drinker. Overall this is another decent beer from the Summer pack."
"part of summer sampler pack. Poured a light copper cooper color with white head. Smell is strong of lemon, and not much else. First taste is very overpowering of lemon but with susequent sips this seems to sudside. There also becomes a slight background of dryness, which adds to the quality of the beer. Beer definitely improves as the glass empties, and I start to enjoy it. Pretty good beer."
"The beer pours a beautiful amber with an eggshell head. It has a nice floral hoppy aroma. It has a really nice blended taste. It has a good malt core to it, but seems to have a wapper of hops. The hops adding a rather floral almost herbal set of tastes. The feel is medium and smooth with a clean break at the end of the draw. All in all a good solid beer."
"Something is not quite right with this one. Appears dark gold, with little or no head. Smells like lemon-scented oil used for candles or room deodorizers. Taste like a blonde ale mixed with lemon-scented Renuzit cakes. The lemon does not come off natural and this ruins it for me. The wife unit thought it was ok, but she likes perfumey floral stuff. The mouthfeel is ok for this style of beer, but it cannot overcome the flavors. Not recommended."
"Mouthfeel was crisp, and finishes dry with the lemon and pepper lingering briefly on the tongue. Very average summer brew, as the lemon citrus was too overwhelming."
"Another offering from the summer mix. This smells great! The aroma is lemoney and sweet, really nice. awesome fluffy huge head and a dark golden hue. Why does the label tell me it is colored with caramel? Come on. That is like their Mountain ale telling me it has fruit flavors. Whatever. The taste is sorta orangey, it tastes like a belgian white but it doesn't have that cool unfilteredness. The mouthfell is bubbly yet smooth. Moderate. I could pound these. Not that I would. Or would I?"
"Found this one as part of a mix six pack of Saranac brews. Since I thoroughly did not enjoy Sam Adam's Summer Ale (a much worthier brewery), I had little expectations for this. Surprisingly much better than the former brew. Floral hops overwhelm the smell and taste and rather easy to down.Nothing exciting about the mouthfeel or appearance. i would not buy a sixer of this, but it was worth trying out for a random Wednesday night at home."
"Flavor is similarly flat with candy-lemon notes. The thin mouthfeel is pretty astringent, and it makes the whole thing seem even more biting and unpleasant. There's just not much going on here other than the Pez flavor, and I don't really dig it."
"Drinkability: This is not a bitter beer. Very sweet and easy to drink. This beer is good enough to standalone. If you like iced tea, you ought to like this brew."
"Pours a coppery golden color with a bubbly, one finger head. Fairly active carbonation, but not overly fizzy. Aroma is of clean malt, a kind of dry grassiness, & a hint of lemon peel. Taste is clean also...malt, hay and a touch of the lemon peel again on the finish. Maybe just a hint of banana? Lightly hopped. Has a refreshing crispness to it. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, an ok beer. Would be good at a cookout or on a hot day at the beach. Theres better out there, though."
"Tongueland: Grassy wheat overtaken by lemon bomb. Peppery finish. Wierd. Regulated to the beer pong beer collection."
"Poured a hazy medium golden with a nice fluffy white head. The aroma was a touch sweet, but very citric. You would have thought the lemon slice was bottled in the beer. Taste was OK. Decent flavours of lemon bread, a touch of spice ( green pepper and or coriander) and some typical wheat graininess. No real hop bitterness to speak of. Mouthfeel is good and carbonation is fairly high and the body is light to medium light. Drinkability is a bit under average. For some reason I could never figure this beer out fully. Every time I thought I was gonna like it something made me back off. I think the flavours just did not do it for me"
"Appeared as a light golden beer with few streams of bubbles ascending from the bottom. One finger creamy head goes down quickly. Aroma is of a blueberry bagel or muffin. Taste is similar, but with hints of lemon and spice. Aftertaste is lemon peel bitter. Light in the mouth. This is a pretty ok beer."
"I am sampling a chilled 12 oz bottle in a pint glass. The beer pours a clear orange color with thin fizzy white head forming on the surface and fading to an edge layer almost immediately. Aroma is light and sweet with caramel and lemony citrus notes mixing with some floral hops. The first sip reveals a lite crisp body with average yet tingly carbonation. Flavor is candy sweet with citrusy orange (coriander) a dominant flavor. The flavor is very mild overall and leaves a sugary sweet finish. A nice attempt at tweaking a wheat ale, but the sweetness is a little much for me and reminds me more of candy than beer."
"An interesting little thirst quencher. Not overly impressive, but it functions and works for what it is. I enjoyed mine with a Mother Corn squash and hominy casserole (that was jazzed up with a big jalapeno bite) and okra. And that seemed to work well with the spicyness of my dinner."
"Notes  Certainly refreshing, but the flavor is pretty lacking, not one of my favorite American wheat beers."
"The beer pours a dark gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale wheat malt scent that is riddled with lemony zest and a touch of caramel malt. The taste is decent. It has a very dry wheat malt flavor with loads of lemon and a bit of caramel malt to balance the flavor. It's a nice warm weather beer. I like the use of crystal malts to add a malty aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It's a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good summer seasonal. It's not your typical wheat beer for sure, but it drinks well."
