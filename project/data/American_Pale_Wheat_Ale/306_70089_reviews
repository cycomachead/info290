"Phenomenal tasting and very smooth yet refreshing!"
"This beer is pretty awesome."
"Tastes nothing like honey. There's a fruity flavor present. Like peaches."
"Overall-  Hugely disappointing.  This is a very poorly made brew."

"My buddy left some of these in my beer fridge. so drinking them was better then throwing them away lol"

"Not much of a wheat beer,  the honey and some citrus is there.   Not much of a head.  Maybe more complex than a regular blue moon but not special."

"hey not really all that bad but with most of these Blue Moons price point is too high, better beer for less"

"I was expecting something like a Leinenkugel Summer Wheat but was hugely disappointed. All I could taste was honey and hops with no substantial wheat flavor. It was hard for me to finish it. The younger folk at the neighborhood party seems to enjoy it much more than I did."

"After a 16 hour workday, it really hits the spot, definitely alongside a burger and some bacon :D The unfiltered taste on the tongue is just like ""fuck yeah!"" It's smooth, has a full flavor, and I always end up heading to the fridge to grab a second one :D"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pleasing in taste, this makes a decent summer beer. Similar to Grainbelt or Leinenkugel's Honey weiss."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes almost exactly like a regular blue moon except a little more of a wheat flavor and a n overwhelming honey flavor that I just didnt care for. Its like someone grabbed a bottle of honey and mixed it with a blue moon. It just isnt a good combination."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into glass. Appearance is a strong wheat color. Smell is poor with the wheat and honey coming through. The taste is fairly bland with the honey and wheat shining through. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth though. Very good summer beer, especially for the price this can be picked up for. Compare to Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss. Good summer beer overall."

"Still, when it comes down to the macrobrew Belgian White wars, I got to side with Shock Top, for, in just two of their beers, I could really taste their complexities and their differences, where both of the Blue Moon offerings that should be drastically different are quietly interchangeable to a degree."

"The nose was weak and didn't reveal much but soft wheat, honey, Apple and pear. The flavor, though, surprised me greatly as it was nicely balanced and appropriately measured between wheat malt dryness, honey sweetness, apple crispness and even pear like freshness. This is surprisingly complex as it is macro-brewed and by look and scent a bit boring but the flavor delivers a nice bang for the buck."

"While I am not a fan of honey, this beer was actually really good. It will definately be enjoyed again on a hot summer day. The head was very creamy looking with nice lace that quickly disappeared from the glass."
"Great summer beer.  Honey is not overwhelming.  Great taste. Easy to drink.  Will definitely get it again."

"ya know.... I think ya just need the right stuff at the right time... because I KNEW what to expect from this guy, but the very cold, light, easy-drinking nature while I am hot and sweaty and getting ready for the Kings' Game 3 just tasted pretty darned good. I poured it softly so I wouldn't lose any flavor in the head, and I certainly got the corn-piss-adjunct in it, but it was okay. okay for right now, otherwise i'd be urinating on the bottle just about any other time I would drink it. yeah, I guess I can be a 'snob', but i'm a fair one, no? and as much as I abhor that camel piss swill bud light, they have a pretty decent commercial they're playing during the hockey playoffs...."
""
"Overall, a pretty pointless brew, in my opinion. I want to actually taste the ingredients, not pound thin beer water by the pool."
""
"It's an average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A light hazy colored brew with white soapy froth. Aroma is sweet with lemon, honey and bread. In the taste, lemon and honey. Faint bitterness does little to stand in the wat malty dextrins. Light body with a smooth medium carbonation. Overall, this is a ok beer, it is refreshing in its ways. Not bad."
""
"The stuff is awful. There is just no other word for it. It looks good, but that is where it ends. Smells like staw-corn-piss mixture, nasty coors based yuck! I guess it did not help that I drank a Westy 12 before this, but even if I did'nt, this beer is the pits. Taste is exactly like the smell is and like if it could actually get any worse...the taste goes down hill as it warms and ends with a genuine used toilet water taste. I purchased a 12 pack of the collection including Summer, Regular, Farmhouse, and the Agave Blond, and all of them were equally disgusting nasty beer. The color was different between them all, but other than that, all taste nasty. I just can't get past that nasty wet liquid corn taste ... it is repulsive. I am not totally against Coors as Coors light would rank a 5 against this nasty-ass shit."

"Overall – A bit on the sweeter side but actually rather crisp and refreshing and a pretty easy going summer style brew; just what it is meant to be."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear pale yellow with a nice head. The lacing is average and is not well retained. Nose of Belgian yeast over a light honey sweetness with a touch of citrus. Almost medium bodied with a strong level of carbonation that imparts a nice effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is that of a classic wheat ale, but is quite muted. Light citrus over light honey with just a barely noticeable touch of spice. Nice crisp finish that finishes clean."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I would drink this if it was all I had but I will probably go for the traditional bluemoon before I bought this again."

"The smell of the beer is attractive. The moment your nose smells it, you will want to drink it up. If I had any beer that I would have liked to be introduced to when I started drinking, it would be this one. Although that wasn't the case( I was introduced to many other imported beers) .. but this beer is very attractive."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange-honey in color with a small white head that settles to a thin layer on top. Lots of streaming bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of honey and wheat. The taste is about the same with touch of orange zest coming through as well. Actually a great taste and goes down each. No bitter or harsh aftertaste. A great Spring & Summer brew that is from their ""Seasonal Collection"". A new brew from Blue Moon I believe."

"It tastes about like they just poured Honey into the standard Blue moon. This ends of being more of a bad thing as the coriander is lost and replaced with sticky sweetness that almost seems out of place. The decent mouthfeel is the only redeeming quality of this beer, which I suspect will never purchase again unless it (again) finds its way into a variety pack on sale. Life is too short to drink mediocre beer."

"O- part of the perils of working in small, middle-of-nowhere towns means the selection is next to nil. This is a pretty average-tasting drink. Rather boring."

"Well I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It pours up a beautiful golden color with a snow white 1 1/2 finger foamy head. There is not much lacing to speak of. Smell is honey, lemon, bread, and malt. Mouthfeel is a little watery, but there is about the right amount of carbonation. The taste is very sweet, but not unpleasant sickeningly sweet. It is inviting and pleasing upfront. The finish is a little overpowered by the front end, but the front end is so nice that I really didn't notice or care. I actually really enjoyed this."
""
"O- pretty refreshing summer beer. Taste is nothing that stands out but not bad. I was more impressed with appearance and mouthfeel. Not my favorite of the Blue Moon's but would gladly drink these at a tailgate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful amber color and pours a pillowy white head. The bottle says it has honey and citrus taste, and though I could smell both the honey and citrus, I was only able to taste the hint of citrus. Overall, I give it a little above average since I was expecting a stronger hint of honey than I got."
""
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a Chimay chalice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My advice: stay away. It's basically Coors Original + honey. That's it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, despite low marks for the look and nose, this is a good beer. I imagine it's nice and crisp on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, lighter effervescence than I expected. Nothing to recommend it though. Regular Blue Moon is preferable. Somewhat warming after 1/2 a glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Honestly, it taste like they took Coors Light and added honey to it. It is not a complex as other Blue Moons that Coors makes. It is enjoyable and I do like the Blue Moon and Coors beers, just seems like they really didn't put a lot of effort into this one."
""
"O: This beer is nothing real special but it is enjoyable and easy to drink, I could easily see this being a good session beer for an outdoor cookout in the hot summer."
"Overall – Not really what I was expecting.. it tastes like a euro-lager in some regards. Nothing really noteworthy.. just a hint of honey. Nothing I would buy again."

"O: Not a good effort by Blue Moon, their year-round offering is much better, stick with that"
"Pours clear golden into a pint glass. 1 finger head lingered for a minute. Light smell, mostly honey and not too wheaty. First drink is lacking, but sweetness builds as I continue to imbibe. Mouthfeel is a little harsh for my taste, but crispness lends itself well to this record hot June evening. Hops are nonexistent, a floral nose would be awesome. Honey lingers on lips and corners of mouth. Definitely drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured from a bottle to a glass. I was greeted with a two finger tan head that faded quick to minimal lacing. The color was a clear golden hue. The aroma is shows citrus, sweetness from the honey and wheat malt. Any hops must be of a citrus type that goes well with the orange peel. The taste starts off with the malt and orange peel notes fading to the sweetness of the honey on the finish. The mouthfeel was average some carbonation, but the beer was thin in body. This actually plays better in hot weather in my opinion for a summer beer. Overll this isn't a great beer, but it is a seriously drinkable summer beer. It's refreshing and in the deep south welcome on a day that is reaching the upper 80's in temps."

""

"looks boring and yellowish like a lager but taste like sweet lovely honey beer. hince the name and style. lots of flavor and taste. great mouth feel. a lot better tasting than looking. heavy like all blue moon lines of beers but well worth the feel. just more quality from this company."

"How did this win a GABF gold medal, pale fizzy golden, bright white head, speckled scattered lace. Aroma has cooked veggies and other cereal grains, with a mild citrus and honey blend. Flavors are cloyingly sweet, who wants to drink something this sweet. Crushing flavor of grains, mild citrus, and sharp honey sweetness actually making me gag. Mouthfeel is sickeningly sweet, cloying light to medium bodied high carbonation, induces a gag reflux. Overall I can't finish this beer, why is it sold in 12 packs, good lord it's horrible."
""
""
""
"O- Overall I think this beer would do just fine on a hot summer day but when other options are present I would skip on the Blue Moon Summer Honey Wheat"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of honey, some wheat. Taste is mild, bready, some honey, not a lot of flavor. Feels light in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking beer but nothing special."
""
""
"It's a zesty beer, overall great for summer. The color is a beautiful and deep gold. It is refreshing and somewhat tart as well. Great buzz after a few swallows. I would buy this beer again but it's definitely not on my favorites list. I would recommend trying it over regular Blue Moon, but expect less of the orange-y taste."

"This beer is build for drinkability and in that arena it does pretty well. Flavors are well balanced, but could use a little more yeast qualities. This is better than I anticipated. It's a nice drinkable summer ale, done better than many."
""
""
"O-About what I would expect for a blue moon seasonal. Not great and won't seek it out again"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a pretty good honey beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - not bad for a pale wheat"
""
""
""
"not a bad honey wheat beer, and a decent summer drink. pours less cloudy than the standard blue moon, but there is still plenty of hazy under a one inch white head. smells like a wheat beer, malty, unfiltered, and a touch sweet. floral from the honey. flavor is similar, crisp though, and there isnt much sweetness. there is the essence of honey without all the sugar at the end. feel is not bad, lighter medium body, very sessionable with good carbonation. perhaps just a bit thin for me, but it adds to drinkability. overall i think this is my favorite of the blue moon seasonals, but still not a standout by any stretch of the imagination."
""
""
""
"This is one of the most difficult beers to drink. I felt like I could spread if over my toast in the morning. Not one part of this beverage reminded me of beer whatsoever. I felt like I was choking down spoonful after spoonful of straight honey. Maybe I'm not into overly sweet beers. This is beyond overly sweet though. Two people together couldn't finish a 6 pack of this and it was a hot day trapped on a bus. That says a lot."

"O: this is a decent brew. I was mostly impressed by the appearance but other than that, this is an American Pale Wheat Ale, as far as I know. I might have it again .... maybe"
""
""
""
"Overall- Pretty good, not as good as the regular Blue Moon, But still very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is okay. Deep golden hue, but no real head, and no lacing. Nose is wheaty, with sweet and citrus notes. Light body with a sweet, lightly fruited, wheat character. Overall, this is a fair quaff."

"DRINKABILITY: This beer is definitely repeatable all afternoon, particularly on a hot day, BUT (there are always buts) it's too sweet for me and lacks complexity. Quite frankly, it's hard to tell it's a wheat beer. It's mediocre at best -- not too bad but not exceptional in any way."

"Not terrible but not very interesting either."
"The Crack & Glug produced two fluffy fingers of bone-white head with good retention. It even looked like marshmallow Fluf in the glass! Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like a wheat beer, kind of tangy and underlain by a light oranginess. I was glad that it was not as strong as the lime I had earlier. Mouthfeel was medium with that light wheat flavor that I will always remember from Drink Your Wheaties afternoon at SPTR, accompanied by a light honey sweetness and on the finish, orange zest. The finish was semi-dry and quite pleasant. I would probably enjoy it more on a hot summer day than on Halloweestmas (it snowed here two days before Hallowe'en)."
"I'm not sure why the rating is so low on this website, but I'd like to run it by a few friends to see if I'm crazy... except I wouldn't want to share! This is one of my new all time favorites."
"This has some refreshing qualities, but the inconsistent flavors and harsh acidity in the finish are a turn off. I thought the sourness evidenced subpar ingredients rather than wanted qualities."
"O: very underwhelmed by this. At least the standard Blue Moon is a fair representation of its style, this one falls short. I would say this is drinkable because it is very light bodied and goes down easy... but then my question would be, why waste drinking on something so bland?"
"Overall, this reminded me of Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss, but was definitely different. I enjoyed the sweetness and then the contrast with a little bitterness. Not sure if I'd seek this one out, but a good change of pace."
"Pours a pale, hazy golden yellow color with no head. Smells of honey, butter and wheat, it's kind of sour but not in a good way. It tastes of honey butter bread and grassy hops with a biscuity finish. This beer is thin and watery. I would never buy this beer, I didn't like it at all."
"O: Bleah. Couldn't get over the artifical sweetener taste to this. I like regular Blue Moon well enough, but it's time to go back to the drawing board on their summer beer."
"Pretty average beer overall, although it was quite refreshing. Not a bad summer brew, but there are some better options out there."
"Dr: It's pretty drinkable, rather affordable, and of limited quality. For Coors, it's not bad."
"Overall: Better than expected. Sweet, but nothing complex really. Light and drinkable."
"Much less 'wheaty' than even the regular Blue Moon, and admittedly easy to drink, as nothing really wrong sticks out. Just ok, for when your attention is definitely focused elsewhere."
"O: Moderate beer that would be great as part of a summer shandy, fairly refreshing but a tad too sweet."
"For once, I am pleased to not smell a metallic or sweet corn adjunct smell in the nose. Hooray! However, I also am having a hard time picking up on the honey scent promised by the name of the beer. Boooo! Taste is quite a lot sweeter than indicated by the nose... it is filled with all the honey promised by the label but not delivered by the nose. Unfortunately, the flavor is also filled with a sub-chorus of metallic BMC adjunct that wasn't present in the nose!! At least it actually delivered on the promise of honey flavor. The mouthfeel is very soda-like, but also forgettable and bland. Overall I am left with a decidedly average wheat beer with some honey flavor but faint and unpleasantly metallic malts behind it. Not something I would seek out again."
"Overall, it's pretty boring, and bland. I haven't drank Blue Moon in ages, and I just bought a sampler 12-pack. It will be interesting for me to drink something that I haven't drank in, maybe... 10 years. 10 years ago I was in college and just started out drinking beer."
"Nothing that makes me want to spend my summer drinking this beer. Better than a mainstream beer but not anything I would seek out."
"This is nothing special. Hardly memorable."
"This beer is almost good, but the mixture of honey and wheat is just off-putting to me. I'm not generally a big fan of either in the first place and I don't think they combine to make a very good beer. Oh well. Just my opinion."
"Decent effort from Blue Moon and it's definitely better than their highly advertised belgian wheat, which made me sick last time I tried to session it. Nothing I'd pick up often through the summer season though. Much better summer seasonals and even wheat beers for that matter."
"O. An OK beer, which im glad I Tried. Wouldn't turn one down, but wouldn't buy one"
"Overall, a very boring wheat beer. Fake tasting and bland. I'd choose something else."
"Spice carries into the flavor whilst the honey doesn't, at least until the beer warms a bit, with some hops expanding in the process. More evident again on the feel, the honey softens the finish and couples with a slight citrus component now with a light carbonation. Not much as for graininess in the texture of the beer, offering a clean almost soda like character. As a result the beer is unexciting yet smooth and innocuous, yet a tad lemony sweet in the end."
"O - A decent summer brew but there is better out there, i'm not a big fan of the honey beers unfortunately."
"Taste is sweet. Sweet honey and citrus. perhaps even some sweet malt balancing and and wheaty finish. Kind of bland. Medium-light bodied. Wasn't the greatest but it isn't all that bad either. Still there would be other beers I would crave on a hot summer day."
"Ok in strength of flavor, but the flavor isn't that great. Too sweet, not enough complexity. Hardly can tell this is wheat beer. Mediocre at best. Didn't hate it but won't have this again."
"The taste of honey was just enough to make it a good refreshing summer beer but not so much sweet that it ruined the wheat taste of the beer. It was about what I expected from Blue Moon; probably not as good as their Belgian White but a solid selection."
"Overall, definitely a good summertime/hot weather drink. Slides down like water with good refreshing carbonation and flavor. However, not really my type when I reach for a brew."
"this beer is more like a cheep lager than anything. that honey flavor is strange though. i wonder what chemical they are using, because lets face it honey is WAY too expensive an adjunct for big time brewing. i sort of imagine that they tasted standard blue moon with their new honey flavored chemical and thought too themselves, ""hmm this tastes so good we will be able to get away with increasing the percentages of corn and rice and this will mask the loss of flavor."""
"I really liked this beer's thirst quenching ability, not too bland or and not meant to be served 'super chilled'."
"O: I wasn’t thrilled to try this beer but was rather pleasantly surprised. It was a refreshing light well-balanced brew. Nice balance between the wheat and honey."
"O- I'm not gonna lie....I do like this beer! Sitting on the deck with a very warm sun beating down on me, this is refreshing and quenches the thirst...if only it was a little less sticky on the palate afterwards, it would be a great brew to enjoy...but it is very good in my opinion. I would recommend this and will get it again when the opportunity comes up. On a side note, I will mention that this makes a good stepping stone beer, as I have a BMC only friend who is opening up to new brews, and appreciated the extra dimensions found in this Summer Honey Wheat."
"FRom the 355 ml. bottle marked Oct2411-B05100509. The pour is pale yellow with little to no head and relatively clear. The aroma has a sublte mix of wheat and citrus zing but little in the way of honey, at least immediately. The body is thin and average for the style. The taste has a lightly sweet maltiness, some wheat and a thin hop bite at the end. It works on a hot day."
"Your typical summer beer adding lemon and honey to an otherwise okay wheat ale. Compares easily to Sam Summer except it is sweeter. Makes up for where Blue Moon fails in that you do not have to add a piece of fruit to it, but only does so in already adding the fruit and sugar. Good refreshing beer for summer barbeques, but nothing stand out about it."
"Overall this beer is interesting but not super amazing. I might try it again but I wouldn't go out and buy a six-pack."
"O - I could see this being enjoyable for someone looking for ""Blue Moon Light"" but the promised flavors just aren't there. skip this."
"The honey/wheat taste lingers for a bit longer than I would have liked."
"3.5O: This offering is not something, that I would buy, but e chance to give it a review basing it off the intended style, I think that it does not fall too short of what was in the plans. Refreshing, but not to the point that it drops to the level of other macros. "
"Oveall: This is one of those beers that you try and then offer to your friends that don't love the taste of traditional, full flavor beer."
"Not a beer I would recommend. Of all the beers I have had in the style it is by far the worst."
"It isn’t a special beer by any means or one I will seek out for a special tasting. But to my surprise I like the simplicity and subtle flavors in this easy to drink beer. I’d rather grab this over a BMC in the summer when I “just want a beer,” although the price might make me think otherwise."
"Over all this is supposed to be a light thirst quenching summer beer , meant to refresh in hot weather. Therefore I will give it this rating. But I am certainly glad that I did not spent money on this one."
"The mouthfeel is smooth to begin with, then some aggressive carbonation hits the tongue. The drinkability is fairly poor due to the sweetness, especially in what's supposed to be a ""summer"" beer. Overall, this is the second failure in the retooling of Blue Moon's seasonals. The base brew and Pale Moon still remain solid enough, but the seasonals? Give em a pass."
"O: They should call this mellow yellow. More soda than beer."
"Overall, not worth spending much time with."
"A passable effort from Coors. I give it straight 3s across the board because it's an average beer. No better, no worse, in my opinion."
