"08/16/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Murky & citrusy are the most stricking aspects of this session friendly brew. Great match for the pulled pork sandwich I had."

"Amazing smooth flavor. Hint of citris ."
""
""

"Pours to a nice creamy white head that has some lacing and retention. Color is hazy orange-yellow. Aroma is fruity, candy-like and floral with some wheaty notes as well. Flavor suggests a hint of coriander, acacia or some other flavoring added (says on the label ""ale with natural flavor added"") and the soft, clean , crisp taste of red wheat and hops barely detectable. Dry, spicy crisp finish. Mouthfeel is correct for style, no anomalies. Overall, this beer hits the spot for summer sessioning."

"Not a very tasty Summer Wheat."

"What can I say about this beer???...hmmmm...it is a good wheat. The interesting thing is that even though wheats are usually light, this beer takes it a step further and to me is extra light. Nice color, good head and a mild flavor. Yes it has the wheat taste, but is very light and the afterfeel melts way quickly. Aftertaste is gone quickly. This beer is refreshing but I feel like I would like just a touch more boldness"

"I'd drink this on the beach or while mowing the lawn. Quite refreshing."
""
""
"Chilled down to 36 degrees in my beer cooler and used a pilsner glass. Pours a hazy orange/yellow with a very small white head that doesn't last long at all, but leaves some lacing when sipped. The aroma is of sweet grains with a hint of caramel and vanilla. Very nice. The taste is of sweet wheat with a touch of honey and caramel. Reminds me a little of the ""Paradise Beach Ale"" that is ONLY served at ""Cheeseburger in Paradise"". Very smooth with a very slight dry finish on the end. Overall really like this one."

"O - Like a nude beach, this beer keeps it simple; a summer beach beer to it's core, Nude Beach is a refreshing beer that showcases wheat wonderfully and balances it well, finishing with exceptional smoothness."

"Pours a hazy orangish yellow with a frothy white head that fades. The smell is mostly a grainy wheat with citrus and hints of hops. Big citrus and wheat up front, tasting of orange and lemon, the citrus sticks throughout the rest with the wheat and subtle hops in the aftertaste. This beer is dominated by the citrus though. The mouthfeel is medium light with larger feel of carbonation. It could be a little more crisp to add to the flavor, but still a very refreshing beer, has a nice amount of flavor but isn't overpowering. Overall a nice beer with good flavor."
"O - A tasty wheat ale, surprisingly flavorful, easy drinking and a solid patio ale."

"O- great beer to relax on a hot day with"
"Overall- This is a perfect summer beer. It has the look, the taste and the lightness that compliments a hot summer day to a tee."
"Found this beer here in Michigan in May. Don't recall seeing it before but because I've had Other point beers in the past and enjoyed them overall, especially since the point beers are not expensive. Nude Beach has been my go to beer this summer. It reminds me of German Weissbiers and is very drinkable. It's a bit cloudy with a good head and smells very fresh. Not bitter with a nice full mouth experience. Can't say enough good about this beer. Just hope they keep making it and don't change a thing."

"M - Light body with some chew. moderate carbonation."
"There is something not quite right here. This brew would benefit from a piece of fruit in it. Enough said."
""
""
""
""
"Weak malt and slightly funky wheat begin the flavor profile. This is complimented by the taste of apples that have just gone over and ought to be thrown out and some light hops."
""
""
"Drinkability: It turns into a reasonable and worthwhile purchase, but there are many other (and better) wheats to enjoy during the summer."
"O- On a hot day this would be king. Right now, it's just okay."
""
""
"Overall, not bad for the style. Nothing groundbreaking, but decent thirst quenching summer brew."
""
"O: This is a great craft lawnmower beer because it is easy to drink and has some refreshing properties."

"From a can stamped 0242 on the bottom. Sampled on June 16, 2012. The pour is a hazy pale to golden yellow with a small white fizzy head that disappears quickly. The aroma is pleasant with an array of wheat, yeast, and citrus zest on the nose. The body is light as a summer ale should be but my particular can had a slight acidity to it. The can did have a dent but it was the last one left when I bought it. The taste ushers in a soothing wheat flavor along with a zing of lemon and a nicely balanced mellow hop finale."
"O: Extremely easy to drink and quite refreshing (while enjoying the coast on a warm summer afternoon). This beer is quite sessionable and definitely enjoyable. Might be one to get again for the summer."

"O: Kind of bland, was hoping for more flavor. Would like to try it on tap or again in a bottle to compare."

"Overall - I love the horizon wheat beer they make so I thought I'd try this seasonal one.. I like it."
"Poured from a can into a tumbler pint, the beer is a cloudy, unfiltered, pale yellow coloring with a thin, white, light head atop the surface. Aromas of toasted bread, bananas, and light clove spicing highlighted by an overall roasting fill the nose. Flavors are slightly muddled, with a creamy texture giving rise to a slightly roasted banana bread and clove blending that is balanced and easy to drink. Light, fruity and slightly spiced aftertaste with a smooth, light finish. The beer is a little too light at points in mouth to support the flavors, but an easy enough beer to drink overall. Good warm weather brew."
"Pours out a yellow hue with a thin white head that leaves little retention and not much lacing. The get some wheat and yeast in the smell. The taste is a nice bread, grain and wheat with a yeast finish. The mouthfeel is rather dry and chalky, but a very enjoyable beer and not too expensive at $1.29 per 12 oz. bottle."

"Drinkability - a fine thirst quencher this summer, I wouldn't mind grabbing some more of these next summer."

"A bit off-season, perhaps, but not by very much, and I just had to try this beer. It pours a clear straw topped by a short-lived finger or so of fizzy dirty white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, lighter grass, very light biscuit, and light acetone. The taste holds notes of cracked wheat, light white bread, sweetgrass, and a twinge of alcoholic fruit (that may sound vague, but not as vague as it tasted...). The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly watery feel. Overall, a pretty tepid beer. Not much going on at all, and what is there I'm not the biggest fan of, though it's in no real way offensive. Just boring, in a shabby kind o' way."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Very light-bodied and pretty solid for a summer brew. It feels a bit out of place drinking it in October, but I of course did not dock it for that. This is just okay, but I would never purchase it again."
"O- pretty good summer beer. Could easily drink a sixer of these on a hot day on the porch. I'll definitely look for this at my local store."
"O- Decent wheat ale. Good summer beer on a hot day. I could still drink quite a few of these as the flavor isn't bad. I would just wish for a little more out of it. Still thanks for the beer Evan."
"Hadn't heard or seen this but was at Tap House in Hampton and bartender let me try it since it was being heavily promoted. Poured a cloudy yellow w/ good head on top of a grainy yet smell of hops and a touch of yeast. Wouldn't have thought this was a pale wheat as it seemed more to me as a crappy fruit beer - the yeast is overpowered by just bitter hops and this cloying, fruity sweetness that I couldn't stomach for an entire glass. It was alright to try but not my pick for a beer."
"Overall: Very refreshing. A good session beer. Perfect for summer afternoons."
"Overall would be an alright session beer or to accompany a meal."
"Pours a completely clouded, true straw-yellow. A white head soon rings up, but washes the glass. Smells like a bunch of mineral, but also some bittersweetness underneath. Taste just sort of unfolds into an oversweetness that I can only describe as ""wort-like."" Feel is thick and oily. Ends sour, but seriously - I think this stuff got bottled too soon.."
"Overall a pretty solid beer. And really good for $10/12 pack. Definitely will buy this again."
"Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is thin so taste leaves quick"
"This obviously caught my eye and bought a 6 pack of it at a liquor store in Delaware after visiting the Dogfish Head Brewpub. The beer poured out as a nice looking hazy golden color. The head was fluffy and white. The smell of the beer is fresh and lightly citric. The taste of the beer has a nice wheat flavor to it. The mouthfeel is smooth and not overly carbonated. Overall this beer is pretty good for summer time. I liked it."
"O: This beer says that summer is here, and I have to agree. Nothing outstanding, but not a single flaw. Haven't had anything from Point in quite a while and now I'm eager to visit a few of their other offerings again. Good stuff, enjoy it while it's here."
"O - This is an okay American wheat ale. Fairly typical for Point Brewery."
"The mouthfeel has a metallic taste to it. The odor is rather weak. Overall, very average. I wouldn't buy again."
"Notes: Bland beer but somewhat refreshing for a cheap summer beer. Simple pale wheat beer, nothing with a lot of flavor but it is refreshing. For the price and the fact that they can it makes it a nice summer beer, but other than that it isnt worth the trouble."
"D ~ I like it okay. Nothing spectacular going in, but it's not too sweet like most ""summer wheats."" Good on hot day of digging in the dirt."
"O - Definitely an easy drinker. You could definitely throw a handful (or more) back without any problem on a summer day."
"O - Not mind-blowing, but certainly can hold its own as a summer beer. I would take this over Sam Summer as it is more flavorful and slightly lighter. The lemon and citrus flavors pop more and I can see myself out on a summer day with this easily!"
" Overall pretty refreshing and nice. Flavor is a bit muted and on the sweet side of things, but I could drink a few of these on a hot summer day with no problem."
"Pours a hazy yellow to orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, sweet citrus and a small wheat note. In the taste, a sweet light citrus and a small pilsner like hop. A Saaz/ pilsner like hop bite and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry wheat note in the aftertaste. EH! Somewhere between a pilsner and a wheat."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow, decent sized head on the cloudy body. Aroma of wheat and some lemon predominate in the nose, follows through with a basic wheat/banana/citrus interaction and also a little grainy. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium bodied alittle thin. Overall I thought this was a decent American wheat."
"Decent beer at a decent price. At $9.99 for a twelve pack, that's only about a buck more than others might be charging for a six pack. Good value."
"Most reviewers seem to like this beer, so maybe my particular bottle was mishandled or is over the hill, but if this is what it is supposed to taste like, then I won't be buying this one again."
"Notes: This is a very solid American made German Hefeweizen."
"All in all, it's a great quaffable brew. As far as summer beers go, I think this is on the mark and I enjoyed it."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, decent representation of style, this is a poundable beer because it's so light but there are several other beers in the style that I would choose first."
"Average brew. So many better wheat beers out there but Point does a fair job."
"Would I buy more of it? - I really dig this beer. It's very easy drinking and a great canned alternative to other light summer wheat beers (a la Sam Adams Summer)."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a good mix of pale and wheat malt scents along with a crisp, dry fruitiness. There are a decent amount of esters present. The banana/ clove aromas are mild, but well perceived. The taste is decent. It has a smooth pale and wheat malt flavor. It goes down easy with some prickly carbonation in the finish. It seems a bit watery and lacking in yeast character. Also, it's a bit heavier than most summer beers. It is a medium bodied beer with good/too much carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, but not the best wheat beer on the market. The AB wheat beers are better."
"For a summer wheat, this is really great. Very drinkable."
"The body was light but not lacking. Lots of carbonation and a crisp chalky finish made it definitely easy to drink and refreshing, now I gotta find a nude beach...."
"RJT"
"Pours a cloudy golden with a fizzy white head. Excellent retention and very nice laceing. Aroma is of wheat and citrus. Nice but a bit weak. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is malty up front with lemon and citrus throughout. tangy,spicy finish. very nice."
"D= Very drinkable. In my opinion this is better than many of its competitors, including 312, Blue Moon, Shock Top, etc. Not a world class beer, but a good summer lawnmower beer nonetheless."
"D: Drinkability was good, though not necessarily exciting, it does what a basic example is asked for, and easily goes down with little effort as long as you're not overly critical. Could be a nice thirst quencher and downer and a safe play for mixed crowds for that summer party, perhaps on the beach, perhaps clothes optional. I wouldn't of been disappointed with a six pack purchase."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is an inch and a half in height, and recedes slowly into a quarter inch cap of white foam. The aroma is lemon zest, tangy wheat, and a hint of clove. It is a lot more aromatic than more American style wheat beers, and I like that. The taste is just as strong as the aroma. There is lots of lemon, lots of wheat, and again a hint of clove. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with fairly high carbonation which is alright for the style. Overall, this is a very nice surprise from Stevens Point Brewery. Nice to see a good micro come out of Wisconsin"
"I was unsure whether or not I should pour th sediment into the glass. I figured it looks like a hefe, I might as well go for some extra B vitamins. A nice cloudy golden orange hue with a bright white head, lacing forms nicely in fine even layers. Aromatics bring out some nice citric an sharp wheat qualities, if you don't like wheat beers pass on this. However from all of the Stevens Point brews I've tried thus far this is my favorite most drinkabe offering I've come across. Orange peel no spice additions tangy sharp wheat profile, creamy edges slightly acidic nature this is a nice little summer sipper. Nothing too offensive especialy compared to most of these summer American pale wheats. No off flavors a nice light bodied evenly carbonated smooth experience on the palate. Drinkability isn't bad at all, I wish I would have tracked down some cans of this offering."
"Drinkability: very drinkable, a perfect session beer, light with great flavor, I'd recommend it"
"My aggressive pour on this hot evening gave me two fingers' worth of orangish-yellow head that popped and fizzled like a jalopy that was about to run out of gas. The color was a cloudy orangish-amber, like fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. The nose was soft and gently fruity, slightly citrus, like tangerines or oranges. Mouthfeel was medium with a mild banana-tangerine sweetness on the tongue. It was more fruity than I have come to expect from the style, but it was still pleasant because the banana esters did not dominate. Finish was tangy, slightly citrusy, approaching dry. Not bad and certainly worthy of being in the cooler that also appears on the CAN."
"D - A nicely done American wheat from Point. I certainly wouldn't mind having it again, and it seems like it would be a good crossover for non- craft drinkers. Pretty good bang for your buck, too."
"Drinkability is quite good. The fact that its not too pronounced makes it easy to drink many in a roll. A good pick for a session beer at the 8.99 I paid for the 12pk of cans."
"Orange colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Very light aroma has a citrusy zest to it.Taste is orange,wheat grains and a hint of lemon.Overall kind of an average beer that really doesn't have much to get excited about.I does seem like it would be refreshing on a hot day.I'm 50/50 on whether I would recommend this as for me I would only drink again if it was free."
"Limited carbonation. East drinking, good summer beer. Unremarkable though.,"
"Overall, it's a fairly drinkable beer. It's well-brewed, and it's fairly flavorful. It would make a great introduction for someone who's never had a wheat. Aficionados will probably find it fairly mainstream, but it certainly has a time and place (summer BBQ's, baseball games, the beach, boating, etc.). Not bad."
"Drinkability - If you like lemony flavored beers, but don't like alchopops, skip the Leine's Summer Shandy and try this. It's no world beater, but its refreshing and tastes like a wheat beer."
"Nude Beach Summer Wheat is exhibit 'A' in proving that success in this business is often as much about marketing as it is about the product itself. Maybe the beer's blandness and its easy drinkability appeals to a whole lotta Wisconsonites. More power to 'em, but I'll stick to APWAs that are stylishly dressed."
"This drinks easily and goes well with summer, sun and heat. While not a stand-out it's more than non-offensive in it's pleasures. Good way to introduce someone to wheat beers."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. There is suspended yeast sediment throughout the glass. 5/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of coriander, wheat, yeast, hops, and clove. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a high carbonation level. Tastes of coriander, yeast, wheat, and slight sweet malt. Overall, a decent wheat beer that is nothing to go out of your way to get."
"Taste: The taste is less flavorful then some wheats but it is very refreshing with with a slight citrus flavor. All and all a little more bland then I would expect but other then that not too bad."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is an inch and a half in height, and recedes slowly into a quarter inch cap of white foam. The aroma is lemon zest, tangy wheat, and a hint of clove. It is a lot more aromatic than more American style wheat beers, and I like that. The taste is just as strong as the aroma. There is lots of lemon, lots of wheat, and again a hint of clove. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with fairly high carbonation which is alright for the style. Overall, this is a very nice surprise from Stevens Point Brewery. In a style that is almost always dumbed down it is nice to see a brewery that almost always dumbs down its beer actually craft something interesting."
"Overall it is an okay beer nothing special about it. It is good to drink on a hot summer day..."
"I'm impressed by this APWA from Point. Good where many American version's lack, and cheap in price too."
"Into a pint glass, pours a semi-hazy gold, with a nice one inch head that settles to film, and good lacing. The aroma is pretty tame, some decent wheat malt, some lemon, maybe some clove, not much else. The taste get a bit funky, but still pretty good. Some wheat malt, some citrus, some clove, maybe a funky bit of yeast is what I was getting at first. The mouth is decent, body isn't half bad, carbonation is decent, drying a bit at end. In all, not a bad brew, but rubs me wrong for whatever reason."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and easy drinking with a mix between crispness and creaminess. Pretty much spot on for the style. Overall, it would be easy to drink a good deal of this and would go well on a hot day on a nude beach (although they need to can this brew as you can't bring bottles on the nude beach!!)"
"This is a really light offering. Pretty wimpy beer with very little character whatsoever. No off tastes, but very little to get excited about here. I guess it would be okay out in the boat on a hot day. But it was pretty unsatisfying. Compared to a 312 or a Spotted Cow, it is just lame. Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy."
"A very drinkable, very satisfying summer brew."
"Point did a nice job with this beer for the lazy days of summer."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Medium foamy head on a cloudy yellow body. Smell of a typical wheat, nice. Touch of corn and some sweetness as well. The wheat wasn't as strong in the taste, but the sweetness was. Very smooth yet thick, like a good wheat should be. Good stuff, not among the greats, but definitely drinkable. More or less the same as Points' Horizon Wheat, only a tad sweeter."
"The mouth is pleasantly carbonated with a bit of tartness. Very refreshing in the summer. Well done!"
"M/D: Perfect. Great carbonation, extremly refreshing, clean, tasty. What more can you ask. I tried it very cold, about 35 deg, and again at about 45-50 deg. Both times, it worked. Obviously, the warmer temp opened up the flavors a bit, but, I preferred it cold. It works great. Cheers to the guys at Point, the Maibock, Nude Beach, and Horizon have been very good!"
"Nice beer."
"I think its label spelled it all out, ""Summer Wheat"". Thats the look, slight sunny color. Smell, slightly citricy, but wheatie, no pun intended. The head caved slightly fast, but hey could've been minute residue in the glass from beforehand. I liked it! Maybe a few of em with a group of friends and we might just start, ""Dancing in the Moonlight", he he."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a decent orange, brownish amber color with a 1/2 white head that dissipated quickly leaving a slight cap. The smell is moderately citrus with a hint of malt. The flavor is a little less than expected. There is noticeable wheat taste with mild hints of citrus and some slight spice in the background. The carbonation is good opening some flavors up in the after taste. Not over the top great, but this is a nice addition to the Point arsenal."
" ~ This is a solid brew that I'll recommend to friends. On a side note, it's nice to see the Point Brewery dabbling in different beers and extending their beer selection."
