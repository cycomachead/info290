Ophelia Hoppy Wheat Ale is an unfiltered brew, you can not see though it. The smell of Ophelia Hoppy Wheat Ale is rich citrus, hops, grains, and malts.  The taste of this brew is bold with flavor. You pick up on this citrus and the hops in this brew. Ophelia Hoppy Wheat Ale has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in the taste. I like the taste of this brew, it is different form most brews on the market. The mouthfeel is rich, bold and smooth. Overall I'm giving  Ophelia Hoppy Wheat Ale a 4.5 out 5.

Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow (SRM = > 5, < 7), kind of like freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice. Ophelia smelled wonderful, citrusy but not bitter and with a slight sweetness. I was reminded of tangerines or orange zest. Mouthfeel was a little thin, but the taste was very nice. It had a semi-sweet orange tang along with a wheat tartness that was really refreshing. Finish was semi-dry, more citrus than wheat and a really nice drink on a hot, humid day. Please put this in CANs!","woodychandler","Jun 12, 2014"

The taste holds notes of lemon zest, orange peel, flowers, powdered sugar, light honey, and some mild grass that sits on the tongue through the finish. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a meek hoppy wheat, one where the hops don't really blend seamlessly with the base.

3.9,10.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 4/23/2014. Pours very hazy/cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, orange peel, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of bright hop notes with a good amount of malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, orange peel, lemon zest, floral, grass, wheat, cracker, biscuit, herbal, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Slight earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, orange/lemon zest, wheat, cracker, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish fora good bit. Very nice complexity of citrus hop flavors and balanced bready malt sweetness; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale wheat ale. All around good robustness and complexity of citrus hops and balanced bready malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 28, 2014"

This is backed by a light body with gently crisp carbonation, which in the end makes this a pleasantly made beer.","DoubleJ","Mar 22, 2014"

Pale wheat taste with slight hop bitterness midway through the drink. Mild bitter aftertaste. Wheat taste does overpower the bitterness a bit. Wheat beer was my first love when it came to craft beers, but I have become more of a hop head. So, I do enjoy the combination, but I wish it was more hoppy. It is definitely a beer I can enjoy and would gladly drink again.","jngrizzaffi","Mar 07, 2014"
