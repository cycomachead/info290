Not sweet, however. Not malty, not hoppy. It's just a beery taste with some earthy, murky flavors. I can't actually taste anything like hops, but it does have a bitter aftertaste that is far from pleasant. There's really nothing to hate in this, but it doesn't seem to have any of the good flavors of either an IPA or a Witbier. Plenty of concept, though.","mactrail","May 02, 2013"

It says on the bottle to pour until a half inch is left in bottle, swirl that around, and pour to produce ""a rich, thick collar of foam to release citrusy cascade hop aroma"". I did this but there wasn't very much of a thick head. It has a very faint citrus smell, certainly nothing offensive, but not overwhelming either. Taste is average, like the smell not offensive and certainly drinkable, but not great either. It is probably something that you could drink a couple of, might quench your thirst, but wouldn't ever hit you where you stop and say ""damn that is good"". That citrus taste has that hoppy ipa kick at the end, but is less encouraging then other, better ipa. Mouthfeel doesn't have a lot of texture or anything going on.A non offensive tolerable beer that won't knock your socks off but won't kill you either.","justincolts","Dec 27, 2012"

Begins like a typical Belgian White - wheat and Belgian mix of spices, followed by a very understated hop finish that resembles celery, only there is another light""finish"" of Beligian candy sugar that cleanses the light hop bite.

Heavy orange and coriander up front with a bit of sweetness that is balanced by the hops. However, I don’t really taste any additional hops.

This beer was a good deal but I wouldn't buy it again and I don't really recommend. I wasn't expecting much with this beer, and not much is exactly what I got, beers shouldn't call themselves an IPA when there is hardly and hop flavor and no bitterness whatsoever, I really don't see how this beer is different then regular Shock Top.
