"4/5/15 (Bottle) - Foggy yellow pour, decent carbonation and white head. Yeast and orange aroma. Nice wheat taste with minimal hop taste. Not very strong, very smooth drinking beer. Overall good summer outdoor beer."

"I like this concept, a hoppy wheat ale, unfiltered.  A lot of my top beers are unfiltered wheats. Although I'm not a huge hop head.   Anyway, they strike a nice balance here.  And the shapely red-headed young woman on the label boosts the ""Look"" rating from 4.25 to an easy 5.  It's the little things in life that make it great.  I might have to look for this beer again. Or maybe I can find Ophelia, the red-head instead.  I'd like to buy her a beer."

"Hippy taste smooth going down just like a wheat, weak finish"
"Overall : I was looking for something different and this did the trick. How this is not collaboratively rated ""very good"" or ""outstanding"" is beyond me. It's a little generous with the ""hoppy"" title, so hopheads may not approve - but it is first and foremost a smooth wheat beer with a slight twist of leafy twiggy hop. It's just damn delicious."

"O: as a hop head, this is one of my favorite wheat beers;"
""
""
""
"Awesome wheat ale, hazy and great"
"O: Overall pretty light, enjoyable but definitely not a trip through flavor country.  Much like another Ophelia, I think this is a little watery."
""
"A hopheads wheat beer, but not too hoppy to be overpowering of the subtle wheat nuances. Very tasty, great summertime beer."

"Di likes this one, but not as much as agave what"

"2.91/5: Oh Ophelia, you're just not very exciting"

"Obvious fruity hop smell and taste, ending flavors dissipate in a buttery palate."
"Very good."

"Ophelia Hoppy Wheat Ale brewed by Breckenridge Brewery, with an ABV of 5.0% This brew pours out a nice cloudy amber color with a nice white head. Ophelia Hoppy Wheat Ale is an unfiltered brew, you can not see though it. The smell of Ophelia Hoppy Wheat Ale is rich citrus, hops, grains, and malts.  The taste of this brew is bold with flavor. You pick up on this citrus and the hops in this brew. Ophelia Hoppy Wheat Ale has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in the taste. I like the taste of this brew, it is different form most brews on the market. The mouthfeel is rich, bold and smooth. Overall I'm giving  Ophelia Hoppy Wheat Ale a 4.5 out 5.  Breckenridge Brewery did a nice job with this one, I would buy this brew again."
"    Overall, a 4.25 Ophelia Hoppy Wheat Ale - Breckenridge Brewery. Another spring hopeful I've experienced this winter."

"On draft in Chicago. A long way from the kettle. Maybe the draft/glass was compromised(but usually not at this bar)but I got nothing from this beer. No mosaic aromas. No head, no lacing, nothing materially above s BUD. I will chalk this up to distance of distribution. Drink this at the brewery or close to home where it was handled properly. BB makes good beer so a poor rating is for overreach."
""
""
"Im not sure it was worth the hotel price of $6 for a 12 oz glass but still very good."
""
"Taste is strong but reminds me of Budweiser rather than a nice craft"
""
""

"Aroma is terrible, taste isn't much better."

"Hoppy, but not too much. Which is fine because it lets the citrus and fruit shine. Ends a tad bitter for my druthers, but this is still a good brew."

"O: you can tell what's going on with this beer (when fresh), though the hop noise has simmered down... this might be more interesting with hop varieties with more personality... with as much hype as Mosaic has gotten, why choose to kinda bury it in a malty, yeasty wheat beer?"

"Overall, I don't really like what's going on here. It's a pretty standard, bland, boring American Wheat Ale with a generous amount of hops thrown in. Very juicy, but boring. Mosaic are the cool new thing, but you need a good beer behind it as well. Not bad, just not good."
"Sometimes you come across a beer that is so simple that it is difficult to come up with 250 characters to complete a review. This is one of those beers. That doesn't mean I didn't like it, in fact I did, it simply is hard to write much. The nose and flavor are light piney hops coupled with a light wheat malt. Pure, easy, simple but a nice drinking beer."
""
""
"Overall, a solid hoppy wheat ale that is bitter and slightly biting in the mouthfeel, but good flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a decent hoppy wheat but I think I was hopping for a little more from the mosaic hops in this one. But to be fair I will have it again on a hot sunny day."

"I was gentle with Ophelia, but still she was anxious to give me head. My pour netted just over two fingers of dense, tawny head with great retention in the face of today's humidity. Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow (SRM = > 5, < 7), kind of like freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice. Ophelia smelled wonderful, citrusy but not bitter and with a slight sweetness. I was reminded of tangerines or orange zest. Mouthfeel was a little thin, but the taste was very nice. It had a semi-sweet orange tang along with a wheat tartness that was really refreshing. Finish was semi-dry, more citrus than wheat and a really nice drink on a hot, humid day. Please put this in CANs!"

" The taste is slightly bitter with herbal hop flavors initially and light orange taste with a mild wheat toastiness and slightly grassy hop edge with gentle tangy yeast combined with wheat flavors and hint of spice in the nutty dry finish. Overall I enjoyed this it is drinkable and kind of like a white IPA but it has more wheat with a mild yeast flavor throughout."

"Yeah, name a beer after that particular character in Hamlet. Nothing iffy there, nossir... Anyway, this stuff pours a partly cloudy straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises flowers, mixed greens, powdered sugar, honey, and oats. The taste holds notes of lemon zest, orange peel, flowers, powdered sugar, light honey, and some mild grass that sits on the tongue through the finish. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a meek hoppy wheat, one where the hops don't really blend seamlessly with the base. It's alright at best."
""
""
""
"O: Overall moderate hoppiness, mildly entertaining, but not enough to really hold your attention. Decent, but forgetable."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a long time."

"Overall -Totally cool IPA wheat beer. I prefer this over most American Wheats."
"This is a great drink!"

"Good beer. Glad I tried her out. Will enjoy the whole 6 pack I ought, but I won't be ack for sloppy seconds."

"Ophelia pours a hazy golden color with a small head. There is a creamy wheat aroma, with very strong lemons notes. The taste has a nice crisp wheat flavors, with some hop notes, and lots of lemon flavors. Good flavors, a little over carbonated. Overall its a nice refreshing beer."
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 4/23/2014. Pours very hazy/cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, orange peel, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of bright hop notes with a good amount of malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, orange peel, lemon zest, floral, grass, wheat, cracker, biscuit, herbal, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Slight earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, orange/lemon zest, wheat, cracker, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish fora good bit. Very nice complexity of citrus hop flavors and balanced bready malt sweetness; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale wheat ale. All around good robustness and complexity of citrus hops and balanced bready malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall: pretty good, but I was left wanting more; nearly lived up to expectations. If you enjoy Goose Island 312 and are looking for something hoppier, here it is."
""
"The wheat ale backbone is a sturdy canvas for the hoppy character of this beer. It's quite hoppy, and it brings notes of orange, a vague pepper spice, grassy notes, and delicate melon too. This is backed by a light body with gently crisp carbonation, which in the end makes this a pleasantly made beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is medium, pretty hefty for what's typical, and semi-dry all the way as hops and tangy, acidic lemon balance in the feel with the sweetness. It's crisp to the point of being sharp, and carbonation offers a soft smoothness as well."
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ I actually really enjoyed this brew. It was very drinkable and very flavorful with a nice blend of hop, wheaty malt, and just enough sweetness to keep it all in line."
""
""
"O: Not a bad choice. I was intrigued by the cool label. If you're looking for a little hop bite, this is a good one."
""
"Dry citrus burst. Some light wheatness, at the most pale. Still, flavorful malts. More vegetable-like notes... maybe greens or carrot. A unique pale wheat. Carries the hoppiness that it suggests. Also, pushes a lot of sudsy carb. Good spring seasonal."
"Poured into a tulip. Hazy color typical for a wheat beer. Thin foamy head with slight lacing on the side of the glass. Slight piney, wheat smell. Pale wheat taste with slight hop bitterness midway through the drink. Mild bitter aftertaste. Wheat taste does overpower the bitterness a bit. Wheat beer was my first love when it came to craft beers, but I have become more of a hop head. So, I do enjoy the combination, but I wish it was more hoppy. It is definitely a beer I can enjoy and would gladly drink again."

"Breckenridge Ophelia ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
"I am a fan of the Ophelia...certainly can compete with Blvd 80-Acre Hoppy Wheat. The beer poured a hazy unfiltered yellow with virtually no head and no lace. The smell was a good mix of citrus hops and wheat. The taste was a very good balance of bready malt and citrus hops. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a great beer and would certainly try it again."

"they call this a hoppy wheat, but it all seemed a bit subdued to me. barley hazy pale yellow liquid and a thin white film for head. the nose is wheat malt first, hops second. not overly exciting by any means, but seemingly well crafted and light enough to drink a bunch of. nothing about this really pops in terms of flavor. good ale yeast and fresh wheat leave a mark, but the hops arent where i expected them to be after reading the description. its a little citrusty, but the fuller wheat body covers up a lot of the hops. its a good beer with food, as its plenty full flavored, but it lacks an exciting or distinguishing element to me. clean finish, good bubbles. its a high C or a low B for me, par for the breckenridge course."

"Criticisms may be that the wheat beer is trying to be too much of an IPA. But perhaps that's what this style should become."
""
"This was so good. Completely cloudy, it poured leaving a thick head which moderately quickly became a solid lace. The smell was mainly floral, but there was definitely citrus complementing it. The taste brought out the big citrusy hop goodness. It was mingled with pepper and floral, and was pretty carbonated. I would definitely get this again and regret only getting one."
""
"Overall - Really good beer, espically for Breckenridge. Nice flavors, good balance and smooth and easy to drink. Id rather be drinking this during the summer months but still, its a worthy drink for the winter."

"Overall, incredibly interesting, tasty, and refreshing. ABV is 5%."

"This isn't anything too special, but it's enjoyable. It's very refreshing. I wouldn't mind drinking this in the summer."
