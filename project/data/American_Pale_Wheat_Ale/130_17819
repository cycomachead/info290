Lots of streaming bubbles rising up from the bottom and sides of the boot. Very little lacing is seen. The aroma is of malts and wheat with a hint of light spice. The taste is pretty much the same with a light hint of citrus as well. Very easy to drink with no bitter or harsh aftertaste. A great summer seasonal brew for a hot day.

Smell is of malt, wheat, caramel, banana, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with banana and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a nice smell, but the flavors aren't as good in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 14, 2014"

Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises cracked wheat, banana peel, light orange peel, and a dash of muddled spices. The taste brings in more of the same, with a heavy bready component leading the charge. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a middling beer at best, one that just kinda sits there with little or no distinguishing character of its own. Sure, I suppose this could be used as a nice enough thirst-quencher in the Summer months, but it's just kinda bland for my tastes beyond that.","TMoney2591","Aug 04, 2013"

3.7,8.2,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into weizen glass, best before 1/25/2013. Pours very hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big lemon, banana, clove, wheat, pear, pepper, light bubblegum, earth, grass, floral, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance. Taste of lemon, wheat, banana, clove, floral, grass, orange zest, earth, coriander, light bubblegum, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of lemon, banana, wheat clove, light pepper, earth, grass, floral, light bubblegum, and coriander. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; a bit more watered down than I expected; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice wheat ale. Nice amount of hefeweizen flavor complexity and balance; and extremely smooth to drink. Definitely an enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 10, 2012"

3.45,0.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured on-tap at La Festa Brick and Brew in Dover, NH. The beer was poured in a pint glass, and it settles into a pale, unfiltered look, with a musty yellow coloring and lots of carbonation. There is a thin, quarter-inch small-bubbled head. The nose is citrusy, with lemon zest and butter characteristics. The beer's flavors are light and crisp, with a slight toasting and underlying citrus sweetness. The aftertaste is minimal, but with a zesty and tangy fruit sweetness. The finish is a little sweet and syrupy. Good light brew for a hot day, but not anything extraordinary in terms of substance.","GarthDanielson","Aug 25, 2011"

3.54,3.5,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Sweaty Betty is Boulder Beer’s entry into the wheat beer style. I personally love wheat beers - they’re refreshing, taste like a meal, and have a wonderful consistency and high standard between breweries, with enough flexibility in style and character to make each one different. Boulder Beer’s wheat feels less like a unique brew than others (Easy Street Wheat, for example, tastes very different) but remains an deeply satisfying beer. The aroma is strong and seducing, packed with lemon, white grapes, and the by now familiar coupling of banana esters and a touch of exotic clove. The flavor is less thrilling, losing much of its depth in a haze of heavy carbonation. I mostly detect wheat and corn tortilla flavors, gradually panning out to include some banana on the tongue, but tragically little. The Sweaty Betty is still a fair sample of the style, and I hope to set it aside and drink it in comparative calm and quiet. However, as a coaster-dampener for a cool summer evening it fared admirably, even if not spectacularly. The memory of that evening belongs to the grill and the sunset, not the beer.","GarrettB","Aug 20, 2011"

The taste starts off with pale malt, a fair amount of wheat grain, a bit of sweetness, and finishes with a splash of lemon juice, and a light, floral hop background. A bit of spice as well. Maybe just a hint of banana as well, a taste I more often associate with Hefes than filtered wheats. Light mouthfeel and pretty refreshing.","Tballz420","Jul 29, 2011"

Rather than dancing on the tongue or delivering a refreshing feel, its body feels flat and lifeless, a bad quality in a summer beer.

The flavor is like a mild version of a Hefe- but there is an unpleasant corn on the cob sweetness that lays in the back of your throat on the finish.","ybnorml","May 23, 2005"
3.95,15.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"My final bottle from the six pack, and it opened with a flow of foamy beer, unlike it's brothers that were lost before it. Nicy cloudy dark gold color, head is small after the initial pour. Nice strong banana and clove smell, pretty solid for the style. The taste is a little bland, but still good, with alot of tart banana flavor, pretty good. Nice beer for a hot day, I have yet to find a beer in the Looking Glass Series that wasn't interesting.","TastyTaste","May 06, 2005"
3.42,0,3,3.5,3,4,4,"Another "Looking Glass" series beer, now it comes in six packs. Moslty clear greenish gold color with a very white head that reduces to a collar pretty quickly. Lace is minimal at best. Aroma of dusty hay with some cotton candy sweetness. Solid mouthfeel with minimal carbonation -- which helps the estery qualities shine, candy "circus peanut" impressions. Distinct vanilla tone seems to dominate mid mouth, like Cream of Wheat with sugar and bananas on top. Sucrose finish, not a lot of complexities and without a lot of citrus notes to cut in. There's little doubt in my mind that this is an American Wheat with a hefty dose of that grain tossed in.","ADR","Apr 15, 2005"

3.58,4.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall impression: I had this beer last spring, and wasn't too impressed. I feel like they may have changed the recipe slightly, or maybe my tastes changed, but I enjoyed it this time.","rowew","Aug 29, 2004"
4.05,18.4,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Poured a light, somewhat cloudy yellow with minimal head and no lacing. Smells like bananas and fruit and tastes very much like the banana smell. Very light and refreshing beer, and very enjoyable. Nice change of pace at the end of your 9-5 day.","fdrich29","Aug 20, 2004"
3.48,1.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"OK, so it doesnt have the label Hefeweizen in the name anywhere. When I tried this beer, that is definitely what I thought it was. It poured a pale golden (yellow), and was certainly unfiltered. There was no head to speak of, and very little lace that didnt stay around anyway. Very slight aroma of vanilla and banana. The taste has the banana, and a little more citrus. No clove flavor that you might expect from a high-quality Hefe. I give this beer credit though, it had none of the chemical after-taste that many American Hefeweizens are full of (Why is that?). A very light mouth feel. Nice drinkability, this is an excellent hot weather beer (on a 90 degree Boston day).","carln26","Aug 17, 2004"
3.85,12.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Hazy, pale gold in hue, kind of pasty. Yet it was still surprisingly transparent. Not much animation either, it looks a bit lifeless. The head was white in color and about a finger in height on a hard pour. Head retention was poor as it quickly faded to a loose cap. For a Hefeweizen these features are not up to par as the head was too small and the retention was to short. The subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling well, yet another dull aspect of the appearance. The nose is soft with musty notes being the most noticeable. Yeasty. Weak banana aromas as well, hint of vanilla. Wheaty. There is a faded indication of citrus at the back. The nose does play along with the idea that this is a Hefeweizen. Im not totally convinced. Maybe Id call it a kicked up American Wheat. Then again I havent tasted it yet. This is solely based on the look and smell. The bouquet is inviting, regardless. The palate is very similar to the nose. Upfront is a meshing of yeasty musk with some wheaty notes. In the middle the banana finds a way to the foreground, moderate citrus notes that are stronger in flavor than in the scent. Modest vanilla flavors, malty, and thickly wheaty, pleasantly sweet. The aftertaste is mostly banana with just a trace of clove. This is a zesty and quite tasty Hefeweizen with an American twist. Still, the palate has now conviced me this was German roots. The carbonation is lively, as desired. Tasty. Bring on the pancakes and scrambled eggs. Medium in body, the mouthfeel is quite pleasant. I enjoyed this beer it is yet another dandy from the Looking Glass Series. This is enjoyable enough that I might have to buy a few more bombers. Purchased in Omaha.","bditty187","Aug 04, 2004"
4.15,21.3,4,4,4,3.5,5,"Fresh, subtle, solid and refreshing wheat beer. An americanized hefeweizen with the usual banana, clove and nutmeg flavors but also some hints of lemon, ripe pear and apple.","Crosling","Jul 26, 2004"
2.35,-31.3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,2,"Slightly hazy light gold witha small, but vigorous head. Aromas of banana esters dominate. Slight yeasty tones present. Bananas and tropical flavors present with a strong metallic bite in the finish. Mouthfeel is light, with a strange, slightly harsh acidic or overcarbonbation grip up front. I am not impressed with this beer. Too many conflicting flavors and tastes with little direction or focus. No need to look for this one.","winomark","Jul 22, 2004"
3,-12.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a cloudy orange yellow, small white head that doesn't last, no lacing either. Aroma of wheat, bananas and spices. Flavors of wheat, banana-clove bubblegum flavors. Medium body with mild carbonation, almost flat, finishes with some sweetness, I was disappointed with this, maybe worth a try but I wouldn't buy this again.","maxpower","Jul 03, 2004"
4.39,28.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Slightly hazy, nearly opaque golden yellow, with just a tiny hint of copper. The white head was tiny, even after a hard pour. Little lacing. Smell is wheaty and pleasant, with slight hints of banana and lemon. Taste is sweet, lots of the wheat flavor, just a small hint of bitterness and lemon. This is right up there, next to paulaner Hefe-Weizen. This one isn't quite as fruity as paulaner's is, but absolutely great.","dauss","Jun 20, 2004"
3.32,-2.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The taste was acidic at first then went with an alcohol flavor which didn't impress me. My favorite part of this beer is the mouthfeel which is heavier than I expected. It has a wonderful wheaty aftertaste which lingers nicely.","Guinness4me","Jun 06, 2004"
4.02,17.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"All in all, a good brew. Didn't like it so much at first gulp, but from there, I've grown to like the taste a bit more. I'll plan to stock the fridge with a few more before it disappears.","Rio","Beers"
