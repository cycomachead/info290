I wasn't too excited about the recipe change. The Winter Abbey was okay, The Spring Blonde was okay, and im anxious to try the new Harvest Moon. This one on the other hand has some hope. I do not like wheat in beer, especially Hefs, Belgian Whites are okay for the most part but never hit it out of the park. This one didn't do that either, but it still was tasty, it has lots of sweet honey flavor that goes pretty well with the wheat and citrus. Only problem is that its kinda flat. Thats what Shock Top has that Blue Moon doesn't, the carbonation. It just seems right with ST, you look at original Wits like Hoegaarden, they're all super crisp, they all have sediment, it just feels right. I hope Blue Moon can do a decent job on the Fall brew.

The head disappears in seconds and leaves very little lacing. Overall I'm not pleased with the appearance on this. The smell is very small, I get a little honey, and a little bit of that macro lager smell, maybe even some corn in there, not too great on the smell. The only reason the smell isn't a 2.5 also is because it's a step up from a macro lager, the appearance is exactly like a macro lager, where as the smell is a small step up. I get very little honey on this beer, and I get mostly generic beer taste, there is a little honey which makes it nice to drink, but mostly it's not the most amazing taste ever. It's not a god awful taste, but it really just tastes like a macro with honey in it, so how can I like that? It is refreshing and light, so it's easy to drink, but other than that there aren't too many redeeming factors. The mouthfeel is pretty crappy for a wheat ale.

Medium-bodied, fairly smooth even as the carbonation's activity increases mouth presence. The honey here tempers any herbaceous or grassy elements.

Has the strong taste of dry wheat with a top layer of sweet honey. Witbier taste with a li'l somethin' extra. Think Blue Moon but sweeter. Thicker than then regular Blue Moon; more syrupy.

It's more like a really bad light cider mixed with artificial honey. The honey flavor really isn't all bad, but the grainy off-flavored malt and non-existent hops kill it for me. I'd like to give it a lower score, at least compared to real beers and the style, but it's definitely not at quite the depths of something like cheap malt liquor. The aroma is disappointingly weak. The appearance is poor at best. The beer is an odd color, a light sickly yellow, with an awful fizzy head that immediately dissipates to nothing. I generally don't care about appearance, but some of these big mass-produced beers look very odd, especially the sweet ones. The feel is way more cloying than it should be, particularly for a beer made with honey. Drinkability is low, but I can get through a glass when it's cold. A pretty bad beer.","popery","Jul 16, 2009"

Just enough wheat to keep the brew from being fizzy. The smell and flavor are a blend of pilsner malt, cereal grains, and lemon-grass. Makes for a modestly pleasant, yet unoffensive brew.

3.53,15,3.5,3,4,3,3.5,"not a bad beer for a hot summer day, which is what i had it on so maybe im alil bias, i love blue moon's belgian white but this one tasted nothing like it, so im surprised they considered it a witbier. the honey after taste was really good and made the beer worth the 6pack buy, but i had a very high expectation and it didnt live up to it. not a bad beer but i probably wouldnt go right for it for a summer get together.","daburtman","May 23, 2007"
3.32,8.1,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The taste is mild bready grain with honey, mellow not overpowering, with a peppery, spicy note and a slight grassy note at the finish. Mildly sweet, drying out slightly at the end. Light and easily drinkable.","whynot44","May 22, 2007"
2.41,-21.5,3,2,2,2.5,3.5,"Poured a straw yellow into a tall glass. Little head retention or maybe just my glass's fault. Who knows. However not impressed altogether with this particular brew. Maybe its the slight sourness that I am not very fond of that makes me think this way. A very drinkable beer for a hot summer day, but then again I think that every beer is very drinkable. I guess I was expecting more out of this one, regardless I am surprised that my local grocery store actually had it.","dojobrewco","May 22, 2007"
3.18,3.6,3,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This pours a yellow straw color with a minimal head and some lacing. It appears slightly hazy. It smells of slight citrus and a hint of hops and some sourness. It tastes fairly refreshing as a summer beer should. I detect a slight honey flavor, and some bitterness from either hops or orange peel. It is a slightly bitter beer with not much flavoring hops--they let the honey, malt, and orange peel take care of that. Not much body to it as expected, and overall not a bad beer from a big company. I wouldn't mind having some on a golf course.","zymurgy4all","May 22, 2007"
3.68,19.9,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"D: This is what they should be brewing in place of regular Blue Moon. Totally quaffable, intersting, and the pinnacle of cross-over beers for macro drinkers. May not be a Witbier by the strictist definition, but I like it. Highly recommended.","Frozensoul327","May 19, 2007"
3,-2.3,3,3,2.5,4,3.5,"This is a drinkable beer I guess, but the dryness isn't what I am after in a summer ale. I'll probably pass on this one in the future. I think there are as good or better summer ales out there, and some, like Henry Weinhard's, at a lower price..","RJLarse","May 19, 2007"
3.53,15,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,3.75,"D- Its not for everybody. It is certainly very sweet and not your typical ale. This would be very appropriate for the herbed/spiced beer category. I liked it but many will not.","PittBeerGirl","May 18, 2007"

3.13,2,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Bottle into tulip glass. A: Very light, almost like a macro rice lager but it's saved a bit by the nice golden hue. Head went away very quickly. S: Not much aside from the honey and the wheat. The citrus is pretty much in the background. T: Like the smell a lot of honey and wheat with some citrus, a little thin but pretty pleasant. Not much hop character but a little bitterness on the finish. M: Moderate to low carbonation, pretty smooth. D: A good thirst quencher for the summer but not anything to go crazy over. I probably won't buy it again.","PlaywrightSam","May 15, 2007"
2.91,-5.2,3,2,3.5,2.5,3,"D: Yes, I could drink this as a regular hot day burp beer, so maybe it scores better than Coors, but as it's style, a weak choice.","Ricochet","May 12, 2007"

3.49,13.7,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Light yellow translucent body with a couple inches of white head that takes a little while to dissipate and leaves a good amount of lacing. Smells slightly lemmony and peppery with a hint of honey. Tastes sweet like honey, hints of citrus in the background. Light bodied but by no means watery. Very drinkable. Not much wrong with this one, though it's a bit simplistic. An easy-drinking beer for a hot day.","MrHurmateeowish","May 11, 2007"
2.63,-14.3,2.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,"Not recommended, unless you specifically light honey brews. Much better than a Mike's Hard, and preferred to Leinenkugel's summer shandy, but not up to the standards of Dupont's Biere de Miel.","BretSikkink","May 11, 2007"

2.1,-31.6,3,3,1.5,3,1.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date of Sept 07 into a pint glass. It had a slightly pale yellow color. I gave a hard pour and got a pretty big head that stuck around for a bit. Good carb with slight lacing. The aroma was punch in the face honey with a slight hint of orange peel in the back. The taste was also dominated by honey. I think I would have liked this is it had been a beer with some honey highlights since I love honey but this is basically a glass of honey with a little beer thrown in to make it flow out of the glass better. By the end the honey is just too much to take and I had to choke down the last third just to avoid a drain pour. Avoid this one. (1.5, NA, ML, N)","TexIndy","May 09, 2007"
2.72,-11.4,2,2.5,2.5,4,3,"Wait, isn't witbier supposed to be, you know, "wit"? And maybe opaque? This isn't--it's a translucent sickly yellow color with no real head to speak of. Bubbles nicely for a while. Smells vaguely of honey, but I'm not sure I would have picked up on it without being told. Tastes a little more like honey and average pale lager type beer. Has a pretty nice, refreshing mouthfeel--somewhere between spring and summer if you know what I mean. Despite having very little to recommend it, I could actually drink a few of these on a hot day. That's about all it's good for, though.","AndIWantYou","May 09, 2007"
3.6,17.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Appearance is a light orange with a quick fizzy head. smell is clean with light honey and orange. Taste of the honey is prevalent giving it a sweetness with a bit of orange and having a good balance with hops and carbonation. Mouthfeel is light to medium but thick. Overall it's better than what was to be expected, it would make for a good session but the sweetness would prevent me to continue beyond 2-3 beers.","Bookseeb","May 08, 2007"
