Low carbonation level. The flavor profile is two dimensional - caramel malt sweetness over a strong alcohol background. The hop level is so low it's almost undetectable. As it warms, and the palate becomes accustomed to the alcohol, the sweetness comes forward. On the finish, it flows from sweetness to an alcoholic aftertaste. A good, but not great, beer.

A slight medicinal bitterness gradually arises as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is very good with a slight silkiness that is lifted from the palate by the fine carbonation. Drinkability is OK.

The flavors started a little on the musty barley side, this then gave way to sweeter flavors of caramel malt but these too were a little odd. The aftertaste however was distinctly unpleasant, like tannins in wine - twiggy. The body was medium and watery, the carbonation too soft and as it warmed up the alcohol came right through it.
