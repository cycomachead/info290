"Pours a dirty brown hue with a subtle one finger head that stays and leaves nice clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is chestnuts,dried fruits,candi sugar and a touch of milk chocolate,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated over moderate and the tastes are milk chocolate,dried fruits,candi sugar and finished with a roasty nuttiness and overall a pleasant surprise not fantastic but easy to drink."

"This is a good Belgian ale, but I'd probably call it a pale ale instead of a dark ale."

"O-this definitely isn't a bad Belgian. There are no bad flavors. It's just a tad bit more mellow than I like my beers, which wouldn't be terrible if it were cheaper. I'd recommend people to give it a try. It has a unique cocoa character to it."

"O: After tracking down Valeir Blond and being impressed by such depth in a standard Belgian pale ale, I expected to be impressed by Valeir Donker. Unfortunately, my expectations may have been unreasonably high, as this ale slightly misses the mark. I found the body to be too thin, the carbonation to be too gentle, and the flavor profile to lean a little too heavily towards cloying sweetness. While Valeir Donker may not be a bad beer by any measure, it isn't a great one either. Decent, but a little out of whack nevertheless."
"O: This is a drinkable beer, but there are definitely other BDAs that I would choose first."

"O: The nose was promising, but the flavour wasn't really doing it for me. Solid, nothing else."
"I inhale figs and bananas together, an interesting combination. A bit of chocolate and brown sugar. The malt contribution is a delectable flavor. Tastes good going down, but quite similar to the aromatic description. The banana is a bit detracting from a stylistic standpoint, but works well enough with the other flavors to not be disappointing. A good effort, a little on the sweet side. I look forward to trying their other treats.."
"While nothing spectacular, I thought this still a pretty strong effort from this always excellent and reliable brewery."
"D: I would definitely have this beer again because the flavor is rather complex and interesting."
"Looks and smells good...but its all down hill from there."
"A nice rich beer. Even, balanced character, without all the sweet the nose suggests. A very enjoyable brew. Not earth shattering, but I would certainly repeat."
"Overall, it's a really enjoyable, fairly complex beer that somehow, is also quite readily accessible, even for a dark beer. People that don't normally enjoy beer will probably like this one, especially if they enjoy darker red wines. Very nice! Worth seeking out!"
"Pours a dark ruby hued brown with a large creme head that has staying power. Nose is mild perfume and fruit tones. Flavor is malty with a consistent sweet tone. Minor figs. Seems like mild apricots, and I do mean mild. Consistent sweet tone you'd expect. Feel has a pretty full carbonation and a decent liquid body. Pretty easy to drink. If this were served on tap, you could probably down several of them."
"Pours a mud puddle brown color with a fairly dense khaki colored head that left some nice sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma is of figs, raisins and brown sugar, perhaps some carob. Some honey aromas as well. Raisins and fig in the flavor as well, a bit rusty. Nice and sweet but not overly sweet; has a honey like sweetness and a coffee bean bitterness, though no coffee flavors. Moderate body with fizzy carbonation; drinks sweet but does have a nice bittering offset. Quite flavorful for a BDA, and with the 6.5ABV you will remember drinking it."
"Stubby, heavy small Belgian style bottle. Part of the new 12% Line. Pours dark murky chocolate, under an initially HUGE khaki head. Dissolving slowly and resting in a thick and frothy state. Leaves better then respectable lace and exudes an odor of chocolate, and cocoa infused sugars. More chocolate on the tongue, sweet and tasty, with dark malts and a hint of tropical fruity goodness. A slight sour note in the finish, along with an equally slight and subtle drying hop note. Yum. Only draw back here is the $3.99 per 11.2 ounce price tag"
"Nice adchiefment and enjoyable brew that shows lots of taste for it's 6.5%ABV."
