"A very pleasant brown ale, better (IMHO) bottled than on tap, at least here in the US."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, pear, apple, caramel, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, plum, pear, apple, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light clove, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes od raisin, plum, pear, apple, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and solid robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with a very good malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a nice Belgian brown ale. Good balance and solid robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear brownish/red color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like nuts, dark fruit, cloves and a bit of licorice. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but with the addition of some brown sugar and molasses. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and coating with moderate carbonation. Got this one as a single from one of my friends. Not a bad beer by any means, but regardless if this a brown ale or a Belgian dark ale, I like other beers of each style better."

"The taste, as with the scent, was a struggle as well. Hints of maple syrup, light doses of malt and a tinge of sweetness accented a rather boring experience. I tackled this with a clean palate and high expectations but I was left quite flat."
""
"Highly drinkable and with a great mouth feel, good option for who wants to try something different and flavorful, but not as intense as some Belgian Ales. And that is a unique personality."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Considering the low ABV and how smooth this brew drinks, it is a candidate as a session ale. A nice taste that I believe could serve as gateway for those afraid of a dark brew. Highly enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O: Not objectionable, but nothing I'd go out of my way for to have again."
""
""
"Very decent. Like it more as I get thru the glass."

"Overall - An excellent beer with some great flavor and drinkability. If you're looking for a tasty brown ale, this would be one of my top recommendations"
""
""
""
"O- Awesome beer, and my first Belgian Dark Ale. It's easy going, and a great example of what a great malt profile tastes like. I'd suggest this to those that are getting into beer as a novice, and want to know what these beer snobs mean when they say ""malty""."
""
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish to brown color with an off white head. In the aroma, Belgian like dark fruits and a nice roasted malt. In the taste, a small bite, light dark fruits, and a small spice. A small spice bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry caramel roast, and note of spice in the aftertaste. A bit thin and faint, but decent."
""
"O - very enjoyable, could easily see having several of these without even thinking about it. pretty well balanced even without a noticeable hop fingerprint."
""
""
""
""
"Upon pouring; the colour was rich and amber with little to no head, I was concerned that maybe the quality had been compromised. However, to my surprise the flavour was complex and bold, quite smokey and very smooth going down. A top quality ale, I highly recommend."
"O - My go to brown ale and the only one produced in Holland that I know of."
""
""
""
"Notes: Top to bottom it's very drinkable and rather good for a cold night. Cheers."
"Overall, not totally disastrous, but pretty rough. I'll probably have a few more drinks, but finishing the bottle isn't likely."
"Overall: (To style) I'm rating this as a Belgian dark ale or a Dubbel at the very least. Its kind of flat on the tongue and lacks depth. The carbonation is also a bit off, in my opinion. Still a great beer and in my opinion very sessionable."

"Pours a rich ruby brown, with a frothy tan head. The nose is dark fruits, chocolate, funky belgian yeast, wood. Taste is sour wood, bittersweet dark chocolate, a hint of light alcohol, and a touch of blonde roast coffee. Great brown ale - not sure what I think of it as a dark belgian though. Definitely has the belgian yeast funk, but really drinks like a brown ale. Good stuff though."

"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark, semi-opaque amber. Light tan head, no lacing. Mild aroma of sweet malts and some dark fruit. Flavor of sweet and light toasted malt, dark fruit. a bit of nuts. Light but pleasant flavors. Nice Bosch label. Maybe worth another try for the label and maltiness."
"O: A completely underwhelming and forgettable beer."
""

"OVERALL: This is a perfect example of a simple Belgian Dark. Great for a session ale, and quite enjoyable. Would pair well with grilled pork and seasoned vegetables."
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink and quite enjoyable. I could easily see this being a session beer (if it was more readily available). This beer is pretty well balanced, not being too sweet considering the lack of bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer was just a little too sweet for me. The flavors were all good but it would be hard to have more than one in a sitting."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is extremely easy to drink and I really enjoyed the slight amount of sweetness, which shared some similarities with a dubbel but isn’t quite as strong in terms of aromas and flavors. I’m not sure if I could drink more than one of these at a time but it could make for a pleasant after dinner drink."
""
""
"O-this is pretty good. best brown I have had. Not a huge fan of the style but this is pretty good."
"O- I'll admit, I bought this one for the label but I'm very glad I did. What a nice, sessionable dark Belgian...from Holland!"
""
""
""

"Drinkability: Though it is not spectacular, it is a good beer."

"o - really well put together thoroughly enjoyable. seems firmly planted in between an english brown and a belgian dark, and that's just fine. drinkability is good. recommended."
"Overall- It is qualified as a dark belgian, and the herbal notes and earthy hops make a case for this. However, there is so much bread and caramel malt that it is very much trying to be a brown. No matter how confused this beer might be, it can't help but be incredibly drinkable."
"Overall: a really good recommendation from the beer guy at Sydney's. You never know what treasures you'll find here. Another strong contender to my brown ale list. Rich, robust and smooth drinking."
"Pours a nice clear brownish color with a tan/mocha head, the retention is pretty low though. The smell is nutty and malty. Feel is medium to light. Taste is good enough, I get a bunch of malts, some caramel and toffee, a little nutty flavor and some bitterness at the end (note nothing overpowering), I also get a little metallic taste at the end. Overall not a bad beer, but not too memorable either."
"O: interesting how something that should taste overly sweet comes across pleasantly; well-balanced, straightforward, and distinctively Belgian version of English Brown Ale style"
"As for the beer, this is a nice smooth brown ale. Very drinkable, but certainly not a big beer. I got very little head or lacing, Slightly sweet and malty. This could definitely be a session beer. Mouthfeel is somewhere close to medium, but pleasant enough. For those who prefer malt flavors over hops, try this out. One of the tastier brown ales I've tried."
"Overall: perhaps I've been spoiled by some of the great beers of Belgium and the Netherlands, but I just feel like there could be a little more complexity in this beer's flavor. That said, I still think it is very tasty and could gladly quaff liters of it if given the chance."
"This beer pours a clear dark brown color with two fingers of tan foamy head that retains well and laces nicely. The aroma is bready with a slight amount of caramel notes. The flavors starts caramel sweet and then finishes with a bready malt flavor. The mouthfeel is somewhat undercarbonated and empty. Overall a decent brown ale... Messed up artwork though."
"Overall Good example of a brown ale. This is exactly what I look for in a brown ale good flavor good mouthfeel and very drinkable, I could drink this daily."
"Appears a cola colored brown ale with a large off white khaki brown head, fine even lacing. Aroma is full of caramel and brown dark roasted malt character. Flavor is full of caramel roasted brown malts with hints of dark chocolate, a dominant sweet malt character with underlying herbal Euro hops backing it up. Mouthfeel is even bodied carbonation is a bit high especially for a brown ale with a bit of a cloying sweetness as a whole. Overall I can't believe this is from Koningshoeven, damn tasty brown ale."
"This is not your standard Brown Ale like the label may indicate...definitely has the profile of a Belgian-style Brown and does it well."
"D -- Very interesting, and very nice. I would recommend this brew to anyone looking for something that is decidedly different."
"O: This is amazingly complex for being 5%. I'll certainly revisit this in the future."
"Its a flavorful yet light beer."
"Final Notes: This beer could almost act as a wine/champagne replacement. It's got a unique, yet very appetizing character all its own. I really like it."
"Drinkability: Not like I remembered it, I used to rave about this beer but with the price having gone up so much in the past two years, i wouldn't recommend it."
"Plenty of sugar to the taste, strong light molasses flavor. Low carbonation to the otherwise quite rich body. There's a nuttiness to the taste, a little bit like Frangelica. Smooth to the swallow but it's short lived."
"D= Very drinkable, a nice clean brown ale."
"Goes down way too easy. Has the flavor of a much bigger brew. Dangerously drinkable."
"Extra points for the awesome and surreal Bosch artwork on the bottle."
"One of the more unique beers I've ever had."
"This beer pours a nice brown and amber color with very little head. The smell is of caramel and malt, very sweet. The flavor is the same as the nose, lots of malty caramel flavor, but not so sweet as to be disgusting. The mouthfeel is light, but leaves a nice coating on your tongue. This is a very drinkable beer, it almost reminds me of some German styles."
"My friend suggested the Tilburg's Dutch Brown Ale to me while we were at a bar. I was a little hesitant because I don't typically go for darker beers. But I thought I'd give it a try. Wow! I was blown away. This is easily one of the best beers I've ever had. It was dark, but it didn't taste like a dark beer. The color is just a few shades lighter than molasses. It was very smooth and had subtle notes for chocolate. The beer just takes over your taste buds with heavenly delight. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone."
"Notes: great belgian-style dubbel-like ale with relatively low alcohol"
"Dark amber/brown and clear. Copious small carbonation. Light khaki colored head with excellent retention. Mild latte like aroma, more milk than coffee with a bit of earthiness. Soft up front, some sweetness in the middle, and a mildly cloying finish. Needs to warm up a bit to bring out the subtleties. Medium body."
"enjoy"
"The beer pours a deep ruby brown out of the bottle with a tannish head, retreats rather quickly with nice stickiness and lacing. The smell is sweet and malty. The beer is smooth and creamy with the first taste. Malty and sweet, with some toasted notes and toffee. Great beer, a little sweet but smooth and tastey overall"
"A decent Belgian dark. I personally weigh on the side that this brew does qualify as Belgian dark, but there are certainly English characteristics to this brew as well. Flavorful, lower ABV makes this one I could happily drink throughout the evening. Nothing I haven't seen before, but well made nonetheless."
"Nice. Like this one. Worth trying."
"Atmosphere is pretty decent. Nice tone with nothing out of the ordinary for a head. Nose has a similar characteristic. Pretty nice, nothing special. Flavor has a nice balance of light malt, light hop, and light sweetness. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"I drank this outside on a warm night and it was a perfect sipping beer. I could have this for dessert after every meal. Overall, a very interesting beer that I would definitely buy again. (I loved the Bosch character on the tap handle.)"
"Overall: A good example of the style, but this is still outclassed by the best of this style."
"This is definately an easy-drinking Belgian. The low alcohol and easy mouthfeel makes it a session beer of great character and flavor."
" A tad on the thin side but flavorful. Nice drink,"
"D: Delicious well made beer by the Trappists. I liked this quite a bit. It's hard to find a Belgian style beer with this low alcohol and having this great a flavour which means a definite repurchase is in order."
"Value: $1.99 for a single...ehhh...a little too bland to justify that price tag."
"The name fooled me... This is not a true Brown Ale, it is just as Beeradvocate names it.... Belgian Dark Ale. Do it you are looking for a Brown Ale, this is not it. But it is a very pleasant drink. Give this I try, lots of flavor. It is worth a try."
"This one is for the simple folks that just want a rich tasting brown ale without complexity. Very enjoyable. I am curious at the label of being a ""Belgian Dark Ale"" when this is very much in the style of English Brown's. Not that it's a bad thing."
"Cheers!"
"Not sure if I got a bad bottle but this beer was a drain pour. I was expecting a nice sweet brown ale however this tasted nothing like that. I am not going to even waste my time reviewing this beer, if someone ever orders one I may have to sample it to see if mine was bad, but otherwise I don't anticipate picking this up again. I love sweet beers but this was just a watery brown ale."
"I don't know what exactly those freaky deaky Dutch do to their brown ales but I sure as hell like it. This variation seemed to possess a little more depth and complexity than what you typically find in your run of the mill English offering. It was more... refined? Well, whatever the word, suffice to say that I enjoyed Tilburg's plenty and would certainly revisit."
"On tap at Chancey Smith's. Deep murky brown with a nice creamy off white cap,. Nose of burnt brown sugar, caramel malts, toasted bread crust, a bit of spice. Tastes sweet, probably overly so, of brown sugar, caramel, toasty malts and rye bread. A bit of spice and sweet vanilla comes out at the finish. Overall good, but too sweet for me, and probably a bit too sweet for a brown ale, due to Belgian candy sugars. ok."
"Smooth, silky mouthfeel, nice texture. Slight sweetness is pleasant and never cloying, brown sugar and molasses, some candied cherry. There is an even balance to this offering and enough acidity to make it interesting, some dark fruit weighs in nicely, bitterness mostly in the swallow and the finish, just about right I'd say. All around a nice brown and well worth a try."
"A tasty, fruity brown ale - funny how a well-made example of the style increases one's appreciation of it. I don't really know where the BA classification of this beer comes from, unless the beer has changed recipes over time..."
"D: More of an English Brown than a Belgian Dark in my book. Certainly enjoyable enough. I'm glad I picked it up."
"M/D: Light body and low to medium carbonation. I can imagine sucking back this entire 4-pack in one sitting."
"drinkability: not one of my favorite brown ales. worth a try though. fairly sessionable."
"Overall, didn't particularly like this and I wouldn't expect to drink it again. It is light and thin, so you could session with it, but there are lots of better options if that's what you're after."
"D – Too sweet to be consumed frequently. But I still think it is very interesting and quite enjoyable."
"There is some cane sugar, dark fruits, and sweet bread in the tastes, but it is mostly dominated by burnt milk chocolate and smoked hops. There is a pungent, sour cherry taste that rounds out the thin body's lack of yeast."
"Drinkability: Just a strange (yet simple) beer that I would rather not have again."
"D - Big time drinkability and in my opinion, decently blanced enough for year 'round enjoyment. Probably food friendly, too!"
"The beer is very sweet, with loads of candied sugars, a nice caramel maltiness, some roasted notes, some chocolatey flavors too. The beer is just very light, very drinkable, quite smooth, but not creamy. What's not to like in this beer. It is a Belgian Dark Ale for those who don't want the outrageous ABV but appreciate the caramels, the yeastiness, and the candied sugars."
"Poured from bottle into balloon glass. Poured a nice dark chocolate brown with full fine head. Smelled of caramel raisins, dark fruits and malt. Hint of chocolate and toffee at the finish. Good carbonation allowed head to stick around nicely throughout the glass and left some good lacing. This is an amazing light smooth drinking beer for a Belgian dark ale. This is on the soft side of the style and could use a little more body. The mouthfeel was good from the carbonation stand point but lacked a bit in overall flavor."
"Overal a decent brew representing the style nicely. Its an easy drinker as well, with a lower abv making this a good sessionable belgian. Most Belgians seem to run on the high side for abv, but this one could be had at a pub and still allow you to drive home."
"D: great logo...not so great beer. I could see this being in the likes of a session as it is drinkable but in a weak way. I prefer flavor over consumption values. I can safely say that this will never grace the walls of my fridge (or glass for that matter) again"
" It is an easy drinking beer."
"This is well worth trying if you want to get more into the style or are interested in an atypical drinking experience."
"didn't realize this was a koningshoeven brew. drinkable, but not worth the unusually high price, which hurts this aspect of the score"
"Dutch Brown Ale is medium to dark leathery brown with ruby red accents when held up to the light. About an inch of head that quickly vanished and didn't have much retention or lacing. A malty, yeasty, and nutty aroma but nothing really stood out. All very subdues and well-settled. I taste roasted malts, toffee, nuts, and maybe some chocolate. Not much bitterness. A light to medium mouthfeel with a good taste makes this a solid session brew that I found to be refreshing and a decent compliment to some chocolate chip cookies."
"Poured into a snifter for a seethru leather brown body with quickly dieing one-finer head and minor lace. A nice orangey, yeast strain (typical of Belgians) is in the aroma behind a good malt array of roasted, toffee, coffee, caramel and some chocolate. A light-to-medium body that went down smooth, creamy and easy (almost watery at one point) with hints of orange and figs, but the key is the malts. Not overtly but definitely on the sweet side, this beers balances light chocolate, toffee, coffee, bread, roasted and some toasted malts for a sweet beer that finishes w/ a dry backbite. This is a great sipper to relax with as it is sweet and easy drinkin'."
"This is a much more simple taste than I normally associate with a Belgian Dark Ale, it has much less complexity and far less alcohol that I thought belonged in the style. Very drinkable, but I feel that it was a little over-priced for a session."
"I didn't really like this beer. The cloves and oxidisation of the flavour really dominated over everything else, and detracted from the experience for me. This is definitely the biggest disappointment from Koningshoeven so far."
"On-tap at Volo. Malty and yesasty aroma. Mahogoney dark reddish brown, with some soapy white head. Some nice lacing follows. Above average mouthfeel, caramel, dry, not complex, cocoa but with Belgian characteristic finish that is yeasty.Not overly sweet."
"Matt said I would appreciate this one... and I do.. I would have actually pegged it (blind) as a well made dubbel as there is obviously no EtOh. For a ""session"" Dark Belgian... I am very impressed.. Matt should get rid of the lesser English beers and move this one to the cold shelves... I'm impressed."
"The taste is also quite nice, easy to drink yet with plenty of flavour. It's mostyl fruity-caramelly, grapy with toasted grain, stronger in the finish. It has hitns of winey/fermented plum and raisin, a very mild dryish peppery quality, and a smooth feel."
"I was able to give this brew a try last evening on tap while visiting Mahar's. Brew pored to a medium brown color, darker in the bar but seemed to have some orange/reddish highlights coming through. Medium sized head that lasted for a minute or so and then fades to a film, some lacing. The nose gives a nice malt character with caramel, brown sugar, nuttiness and slight apple or pear. The flavor IMO was not a match for what was in the nose, as it seemed to be muted in many areas. Very sweet IMO, which could have lead to the muted feel. While the sweetness seems to be slightly overpowering there is a nice roast flavor, which is nice just wish it was more in the forefront. Slight hop profile found which comes through at the backend though it does not stick around. Though I feel like I did bash this brew a bit the sweetness while a little too much was not overwhelming and the flavors that I picked up where not bad, just muted - plus it drank very easily. Fair brew, just would not pay for it again."
"Cheers..."
"Brown Pour, 2 finger head. Can't smell too much in this one, slight malty sweet, yeast smell. Taste is wonderful, this is the smoothest, creamiest drink i have had to date. Its a litte sweet, but not too much at all. nice balance with the hops. Clean finish. I just might like this on better than my current fav brown, Hazelnut brown nectar from Rogue, i could drink a few of these! The bottom of the glass came way to early for me. And the value of this beer makes this off the charts for me, I can pick this up a 6er of this beauty for $6.50."
"Note: I assumed this was a brown ale, but just noticed it is a Belgian Dark, which I am unfamiliar with. But I think my review is still good."
"Pretty smooth. Nothing outstanding but worth trying."
"Overall, I can't say that I am going to be excited to reach for this one again. The overall flavor profile just seems rather boring. I can't say its bad, but there is very little about this one that would bring me back"
"D: This one can't be called balanced, but it's certainly unique and I find it very tasty. Easy enough to drink, and quite interesting. Not something to drink all night, but I wouldn't mind throwing one in there every now and again."
"D: Easily drinkable. Not my first choice but wouldnt be my last choice either. I'd say this is what Newcastle's big brother would probably taste like!"
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is high; if I had more than one in the house, I'd drink the other."
"Mouthfeel is acceptable overall, a touch light, but so's the abv and complexity. The finish is clean, leaving a mild note of flowers. Not hard to drink by most standards, but nothing exceptional either."
"D - great brown ale, easy to drink and with lots of flavour"
"Not sure about this one... aroma is like some sort of candy, with a flavor that isn't far from that either. The look of this beer is great... nice dusky red, verging on brown, with a nice fluffy head that crags up after a second or two... the flavor is average, at best... I don't shy away from funkiness in beer, but this one is too all over the place to have a good flavor profile... at the end I vaguely taste and smell grape candy on this one..."
"A huge light tan head forms above a dark brown brew. The head recedes slowly and leaves small clumps of lacing behind. Smells of deep roasted malts, followed up by some spice and a very subtle sweetness that finishes things off. Tastes rich and malty with some caramel edges that surround a slight bitterness. Some furtive medicinal notes coat the finish of this medium bodied, yet highly drinkable brew."
"D - Good brown ale that is easy to drink and enjoyable. A little less sweet than new castle"
"D: Light body does leave it rather drinkable, but the flavor isn't good enough to merit a higher score. I'm glad I tried this beer, but I probably won't revisit it anytime soon."
"A nice little brown ale, I enjoyed the malt & sweetness; reminded me of a malted soda."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for the style."
"Kind of a bizarre label; don't know what's up with that. Anyway, Poured with a nice tan, foamy, frothy head and little lace. Brownish in color with cherry red highlights. Malty, a bit bittersweet aroma. Very malty, caramel flavor with a little fruit in flavor. Smooth, decent body and carbonation/ good mouthfeel. Easy drinking. No alcohol characteristics. A tad sweet in the finish. Could be a session beer. Interesting Brown Ale."
"Pours a clear brown color with a small tan head. Smells of malts and nuts. Has a great nutty caramel flavor, not overpowering, minimal and clean. Crisp and refreshing as it goes down very easy. A slight sweet off taste at the end but only on the first 2 drinks, smooths out and evens up with the rest of the beer."
"D- Bottom line, this is an excellent beer, and a steal at $7.99/six at my store. I will definitely have this again. Given the ABV, you could have a few of these without getting to goofy."
"D: Not overly viscous but still a little thick, I could easily have a few of these. Drinkin em all night seems a stretch, though."
"Very dark brown for the style leaving little head and almost no lacing. Toasty malt smell. Also a very nice smell of rotting bananas and raisins. The taste is like the Newcastle Brown Ale but sweeter and with the rotting fruit character that I noted."
"Tasty and smooth drinking - no annoying aftertaste - I liked it. Probably really good with some cheese and pretzels."
"Pretty good, though it seems more like a brown ale (as the label suggests) than a Belgian strong dark."
"Drinkability: This beer is decent. I prefer more malt in my brown ale. If you want a brown ale that is not too heavy on the palate is a good beer for you. Very reminiscent of Newcastle's Brown Ale in my opinion."
"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is a ruby-hued deep brown, almost garnet in appearance. Two full fingers of thick foamy off-white head slowly dissipate to a sticky oil slick and lacing. Aroma is sweet, smells of honey and dark dried fruit, raisins, caramel, malt, grain. Taste is also sweet, full of caramel and roasted malty goodness, more dark fruit undertones, grain and bread notes follow through to a dry finish, with a slight hint of a bitter hop bite. Mouthfeel is watery, light bodied with low to moderate levels of carbonation, a smooth brew that goes down exceptionally easy. Being paired with a sweet malty aroma and flavor along with the low abv% and light body, this would make for a great session beer. Recommened trying if available, definitely a worthwhile beer, would purchase again."
"Reddish brown beer pours a lively off-white head. Nice floral aroma. Taste is light with hints of raisin and caramel but is pretty subdued. The watery texture helps to bring a clean finish. Not a very big beer but easily drinkable. Not the worst but I'll be looking elsewhere for my next brown ale."
"M/D - Medium amount of carbonation and medium body, just perfect for the style. I could drink this beer all night."
"D - A great brew for sure, but the sweetness makes me think twice about sessioning this brew. A good glass, but that might be all I need at one time."
"This is a gentle, pleasant, yet big and complex brown ale. I had never heard of it until I saw it at the store, and I'm glad I did."
"D: Very drinkable with the light ABV. This is one of the better beers we have readily availiable here in Alabama. Great beer!"
"D- At 5% ABV, it's a much easier drinker than the stronger dark ales. I could enjoy a couple in a sitting without feeling overwhelmed by the malty flavor."
"I like this one and if anybody didn't know the cover art is from the painting ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" by Hieronymous Bosch. It is an excerpt from the ""hell"" panel called the Birdheaded Monster of the three paneled painting with heaven on the left, the Garden of Eden in the middle and hell on the right. It is pretty crazy looking and was painted in 1519! On that note, on to the beer. HAd this one chille in a pint glass. Pours a dark goldish color. Smells of plesant caramel and slightly nutty. Tastes quite the same reminds me a bit of amaretto. I could enjoy this a lot."
"Smell and taste is of sweet caramel malts and candied fruits. Tastes like another brown ale in the line of Newcastle. Nothing special in this one for me personally."
"Drinkability: Not bad every once and a while but it is not going to be one of my regular beers."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is very good. Very smooth and drinkable. This beer really is a nice surprise. I could drink quite a few of these. Overall, this is a good. I would definitely recommended picking one up if you run across it."
"Drinkability: Call me crazy, but this seems more like an English Brown to me, and I thought it was until I looked above at the supposed style. And somehow this is the same brewery that makes the La Trappe Quad, which I love; I had no idea until now. Glad I got to try the single bottle, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have this again, as are other more bold and flavorful styles out there."
"O- Perhaps not my favorite but still a worthy choice for those looking for a good brown ale/ Belgian Dark ale. Mild recommendation."
"-Oelergud"
"What a great dutch beer, one of the best brown ales by far on this planet, It has a great almost fruity wonderful taste, sweet and very solid in the taste department! Nice Nice smell, and besides the lack of lacing, the look of this brew is great! I love the dutch and this beer will love you too!"
"D-I enjoyed the drink, but I wouldn't be able to drink many of them. A nice change of pace, definitely not a session brew."
"D: big rich dessert treat enjoyable in moderation due to overwhelming sweetness."
"This Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven brew is a disappointment, especially since La Trappe Quadrupel is so stupendous. Given the wide distribution of so many excellent Belgian ales, there's no reason to buy this one again. Unfortunately, Tilburg's Dutch Brown Ale is pretty close to forgettable."
"Poured into a snifter. Pours a rich mahogany color with a slightly tan head that leads to great lacing compared to most brown ales. Solid nutty aroma with sweet grains. The taste is outstanding. Great complex flavors but not overdone. Nutty flavors are there, with a nice sweetness. Wonderful beer. Seriously I was shocked by it, even knowing that it was from Brouwerij de Koningshoeven. Mouthfeel is perfect, not heavy, not light, sweet but not to sweet, rich but not overdone. With all this said, it is very drinkable. I usually convert non-beer drinking girls into this beer."
"Thin mouthfeel though decently carbonated. Somewhat oily. Slightly spiced aftertaste. Tasty but nothing to write home about."
"This beer is quite drinkable... but for the wrong reasons. This will be the last 6-pack I buy although I'm glad (as with most beers) for having experienced all 6."
"Dark brown/burgandy colored pour, with a thin light brown short lasting head. Lightly malty and almost metallicy vinegary, acidic smell too. Highly carbonated, with a sweet, nutty flavor and a very quick finish. Fairly light bodied, and easy to drink. Simple flavors, and not too full bodied for a brown ale. Nothing offensive, but nothing outstanding. A decent brown ale."
"Copped this in a single 11.2 oz bottle from Total Wine and More in Union... interesting label with an odd, indescriable creature on the orange background of the logo... Pours a dark-brown, mahogany color with minimal head... smell is malty, full of caramel and brown sugars... taste also has that brown sugar / caramel flavor with a malty background full of figs and light prunes... somewhat bland flavor comparable to the style, but still pleasing and crisp, and goes down effortlessly with a modest ABV and very good drinkability due to the rather light alcohol percentage... An interesting beer, certainly worth a try, although not very heavy on flavor..."
"Drinkability: What a great tea! If it smells like tea and tastes like tea, it has to be a tea. I don't understand why they would market this a beer. They should have tried the tea market first. Best tea in a beer bottle!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly coating with a bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is pretty good. I don't imagine making a session out of this beer, but it is worth a try."
"Pours dark brown, but clear. Shows ruby when held to light. Nose is fairly mild. Sappy caramel character there, but just a wee bit. Isn't really that strong. Flavor is very caramel sweet. Strong sugar tones. Leafy tone on the very end that is extremely subdued. Feel is a bit thick on the liquid. Decent level of carbonation. A bit too syrupy I would have to say. Overall though pretty good. Nothing fantabulous, but good enough to try. And for some good enough to go back to maybe."
"Not quite what I was expecting because it was labeled as a brown ale when it turns out it is actually a dark belgian ale. This beer is also very sweet on the tongue."
"Pours out a woody orange-brown with a creamy, sturdy, off-white head that clings to the sides of the glass. Smell is very ""worty"" with big emphasis on dark bread, raisins, and brown sugar. Some mild Belgian-esque esters poke around in the back. Taste is big on brown sugar and dried fruits with a faint fresh fruitiness in there somewhere. Hops are mild but pleasantly herbal. There's a slight acidity on the sides of the tongue. Kind of too sweet for me. Mouthfeel is lightish with a definite sticky characteristic. Carbonation is mellow. This is a tasty beer but the sweetness gets to be too much. I think I'd like this a whole lot more if it was better attenuated."
"Drinkability: Average amount of alcohol, but the massive sweetness of this lowers my desire to have any more of these right now. It was a good beer, but not one that I would necessarily pick up again any time soon."
"Drinkability: A pretty solid beer. I could put back a few of these quite easily. Very drinkable as it isn't to alcoholic or bitter and goes down smooth."
"The taste is a bit of a letdown. Actually, it isn't bad but the texture is weak and watery and doesn't hold it up. I'm not a Belgian expert but this is too thin and doesn't have the chops or complexity of my favorite Belgian darks (like Corsendonk Christmas, for example). Sweeet and plenty malty but lacking in both body and nuance. Certainly drinkable but nowhere near elite in the style."
"Aroma was a barely adequate light caramel malt with chocolate. Same for the quaff  No Belgium aspects to this brew at all. Just OK, not worth the $8 a sixer price tag."
"Significantly better than my first impression."
"D: Pretty drinkable, but you have to burp a lot because of the carbonation."
"The taste is really sweet as well. Malt with some fruit hints. Too sweet for me. Mouthfeel seems thin as well. Leaves a lingering aftertaste."
"Dutch Brown has a rich taste that retains a certain level of balance despite the sweet taste. This is a beer that has a nice reddish-brown appearance with decent head retention. The smell matches the taste for the most part giving off sweet floral and toasted characters. It is not too much on the thick side for this type of beer and delivers a smooth finish that make it very easy to drink. Overall this is a great selection in my opinion."
"The mouthfeel starts thick and then dissipates without notice. Kind of a mouthfeel roller coaster. A weird little beer but one that is enjoyable enough. You buyin'? Sure, I'll have another."
"Mouthful is on the creamy side, nice medium body. Finishes mostly clean. This is interesting, and the label definitely caught my eye, but i doubt I'll get this one again"
"This beer pours a clear brown color with amber hues. The head is small and recedes witin seconds into almost nothing. The aroma is of caramel malt, and not much else. The taste is a bit more lively than the aroma. It is of caramel with some nice dark spices and a mil yeastiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a disappointing beer, and I will not drink it again."
"Man, the label art is a bizarre marvel. A seated bird eats a naked man who has birds flying from his buttocks."
"This beer had a beautiful color and good head retention. Nose is malty and sweet, and the initial taste is the same. Unfortunately the beers characteristics disappears quickly. Not that it should be the goal of a beer drinker or a characteristic of a good beer, but one could probably get really drunk off of this Tilburg offering. It's maybe a little too sweet for it's own good -- and definetly more sweet than most brown ales."
"Poured into a short chalice from the bottle. Uniform dark brown color, pale tan head that settles relatively quick. The smell is bready/belgian yeast, dark sugar, chocolate malts. The taste is great. Very smooth and sweet. Round throughout the drink. Sweet in the beginning with a nutty character rising until the end. Tastes like a bit of hops were added in the very last minutes of the boil. I like brown ales and this one is more than drinkable at 5%. Great beer overall."
"Drinks good, I believe my tastebuds & other senses make me think brown ale or amber ale. This is a functional, if not inspired session choice"
"This beer is decent. It would be a good beer to introduce a beginner to brown ale. It doesn't have that much to offer for the experience drinker, though."
"Drinkability: From a Dutch brewery, I was expecting something more along the lines of a British brown ale than a Belgian dark ale. Not what I was expecting, but not bad."
"The taste is pleasantly malty with a dry nutty finish. Overall, this is a pretty solid brew that is worth a shot and is something I would not mind trying again."
"A medium pour produces a two-fingered pale tan head of medium duration and good lacing. Brilliant golden-amber in color. Nose is plummy, yeasty, and full of biscuity malt. A bit rum/raisiny too, but experience tells me it's not nearly that sweet. Sweet and tangy on the first sip, with biscuit-malt filling the mid-palate before succumbing to a tangy and drying effect. Bitterness is mild but pronounced, and works well at offsetting the sweeter aspects of the pale and crystal malts. The yeast character which is imparted really reminds me of the Konigshoeven/LaTrappe line, especially their Dubbel which I haven't sampled in years - is it one and the same? Fruity esters about, with banana and light cherry along with the plumminess apparent on the nose - rather like an Alt or two I've tried in the past. The dryness here is somewhat complex, lingering but tempered by the tanginess of the yeast. Also, it really seems like there may be wheat malt (oat?) in here as well, something conbtributing to the smooth, even mouthfeel and banana esters. Light honey notes impress upon the palate as this warms a bit, and overall the mouthfeel really improves with warming also. Body seems thin at first, but the mouthfeel helps this along and helps to make it quite drinkable altogether. A very good beer (it's my go-to imported 'brown' ale), and pairs nicely with sharp cheddar. Served chilled in chalice."
"i will have no problem finishing this, however there is no doubt it's the weakest offering i've had from bv koningshoeven."
"D - A highly quaffable ale - nutty, malty, nice yeast taste and aroma. subtle carbonation gives a satisfying session brew character"
"I had tried this a few months ago, and wasn't impressed, but that was before I understood Belgian style ales, and appreciated them. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a snifter. The beer poured a deep copper, forming a very thick 1 inch head, leaving medium lacing on the glass. Good carbonation, with endless trails rising to the surface. The aroma is on the light side, but there are still hints of dark fruit aromas, along with a little sweet malt. The taste is very interesting, but not as complex as other Belgian style ales, that I've tried. Light fruityness up front, followed by a little malt thickness, and then finishing with the same fruit sweetness. A little light on the flavor for a Belgian, but nonetheless, still tasty. Medium mouthfeel, and very smooth finish. Overall, I have to say I was wrong with my first impression a few months back. A great tasting beer, and one I will continue to come back to. Definitely worth a try!"
"Taste started again sweet like the smell. Hazelnut notes with slight coconut, and malt. There was a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue that rounded with flavors of burnt toast, and apple butter. All in all a good beer for trying it just out of curiosity."
"Label is really has a picture that I don't understand the meaning too. Maybe a female can interrupt it."
"Well balanced. Quite drinkable."
"Poured beer into tumbler at 445 dgrees. Beer had a nice color almost red looking. Nice light brown fluffy fat head. Beer smelled like it was going to be hoppy, but it was not thank goodness. also smelled toffee. Sorta just right sweet taste upon hitting palat. First impression is WOW, this is good. Nice lacing. This is a great beer I will buy again."
"Pours a beautiful rich amber-brown. Not too much going on with the nose. I've heard this referred to as ""everything Newcastle is and more", which is pretty darn accurate, more aroma and more flavor. Not a bad beer at all- not really worth hunting down, but if you see it, it's a quality beer to pick up and enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is silky smooth, medium bodied, sugary sweet with notes of flowers leading to a dry finish."
"A fairly average dark Belgian ale, mild in its flavour delivery, but diverse enough to maintain your attention."
"I made a bit of a goof and poured this one into a pint glass when I saw ""Brown Ale"" on the label. However, it turned out fine. This is very drinkable as a sweet beer that most people can enjoy. Recommended."
"I've been in many beer stores, and have never seen this beer till now. The label is wonderful: a scene taken from Bosch's masterpiece ""Garden of Earthly Delights"". Pours a brown color with a minimal head. Smell is malty and slighly bitter, as if its kissed with hops. The taste is a bit off-putting at first, as its not what you'd expect from a Brown. Lots of carbonation in the first part of this beer, then a nutty flavor begins to emerge. Next is what seems to be a rush of water. The last part of this beer really coats your throat going down, and leaves behind a medium-dark malty nut flavor. This beer is better than I was expecting, and would definitly purchase again. Worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, but I think there are so many better examples out there. This style of beer is one to sip anyway, not one to pound one after the other."
"($6.99 / 6-pack - 11.2 oz. sleek yellowish brown Euro-style bottles)"
"Clear dark amber hue...decent laces around glass. This is a tasty little brew, packed with a lovely malty taste with a little bitterness at the end. This is a very easy drinking beer, and could be one that I wouldn't mind buying again for a session beer."
"I really like this beer, even though I normally don't drink sweeter beers. This one was very good. The label is a nice conversation piece. A bird eating a person and the person has birds coming out of his ass ?!?!?"
"Good stuff from the monks!"
"Beautiful ruby-hued brown color, with a generous head. Sweet, malty aromas, but the flavor is surprisingly crisp and mellow. No need to combine this one with food -- stands on its own for before or after dinner. Refreshing, fine carbonation. All the rich flavors of a Belgian strong dark ale, but much more drinkable."
"Tilburg's Dutch Brown Ale pours a reddish brown with a thin off white head from a brown bottle. The aroma is sweet, mabe a little nutty, definitely some fruit. Taste is also sweet, maybe slight nutty flavor to it at the end. Caramel is noticeable. Very easy to drink beer. Recommended."
"Pours a deep mahogony color. Off white head cascades on the pour and then quickly falls to a halo of film that leaves some lacing. First impression on smell is caramel sweetness. Also some dark fruit notes. Taste also hits me with a ton of caramel sweetness. Also pick up some notes of chocolate and more dark fruits. For as sweet as the intitial taste is it finishes rather smooth. A nice beer that I would definately drink again."
"With an agressive pour , the head on this ale was massive and lasted as 2 inches of off-white , ice cream float like froth, with nice stick lacing. The color was deep brown/auburn. Taken to the nose , aromas are mildly sweet , slight candied dark fruit , bit of nuttiness , faint pear , and yeast. The taste is very smooth and also on the sweeter side. Some more dark fruit and darker malt flavors , grape , and yeast. The mouthfeel is very smooth. I found this Belgian Dark Ale to be very interesting and drinkable. It's very different... creamy."
"Tiny brown bubbles amongst some bright honey highlights make this beer nice and colorful. The strong foam or lacing doesn't hurt any either. Behind the the alkaline aroma was some fruity spices. But they were a little hard to pick out with the alkali and all. But the metal stuffs was gone for the tase. Showcasing some nice plum and cinnamon notes. This would be a very flavorful session beer."
"Slightly above average, with an extremely good label."
"D: Very drinkable if so inclined - I'd want a little more complexity myself."
"A good beginner's beer that's sweet and easy to drink."
"I really like this beer. there is a multitude of flavors involved. most notably its malty. I drank this right after having a shiner bock, which i did not enjoy at all, so my opinion may be somewhat scewed. For me, it seems rare that a beer is really tasty and easy to drink. Most beers (darker the better) that i enjoy tend to limit themselves to a few drinks before they become overwhelming and there isn't much point in eating anything else. however, this beer leaves a clean and subtle feeling and is therefor very easy to drink. I would love to try this one out of the tap. Its definately worth a buy."
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent beer. The malt is pretty much in charge of this beer and it is clean. It ultimately tastes a little like a dessert. It is brewed by Koningshoeven, so I had pretty high expectations for this beer. It isn't bad by any means, but it is no trappist. Either way, I would drink this beer again. It is pretty tasty."
"This is an odd beer...I see why they chose a part of a Hieronymus Bosch painting for the bottle - (that bird-like character is supposed to be Satan I believe). Not really sure if I like it or not...peculiar."
" Eric"
"I used to like this a lot more when I was just getting into the wide world of imported beers beyond Hoegaarden and Guinness. But I guess my tastes have changed, as this doesn't taste as impressive as it once did. It started off great, between the look and aroma, and though I can still get enough enjoyment out of it, it's the Bosch-adorned label that I like best."
"For starters this beer was purchased based only on the packaging. Its weird. has a bird with a pot on its head eating a naked girl with ravens coming out of her bum... my girlfriend was amused so she bought it. But I digress, this site is about taste. So, the beer was a very nice dark brown color and had a decent head. it smelt really sweet, but nothing that made you not want to drink it. once you finally get around to having a sip you are almost immediately overpowered by the sweetness of the beer. wouldn't have been so bad if that was what you were expecting... but, I wasn't... and it was too sweet in my opinion. my girlfriend complained of a plastic aftertaste, but I didn't really notice it. It had a nice mouth feel and if you like sweet beers, it should be very drinkable. Bottom line, if you like sweet, try this beer, if not... its your call."
"Decent enough. If you like a sweeter style brown ale you'll like it."
"D: I rather like this beer. Not bad for five percent alcohol. It's different from other beers in the same style that I've tried -- I may be buying this again."
"This is a nice beer. I was expecting a brown ale by the label, but it is definitely a Belgian dark. It really caught me by suprise, and it was only 99 cents for the bottle."
"Re-sampled on June 15, 2009: Thanks Arvjunk!"
"Drinkability: I could drink a few of these in a sitting."
"Overall: Man, how mislead I was by the label. This beer has everything I'd expect from a Belgian Dark, but really threw me off by the ""brown ale"" on the label."
"Light brown color with a three finger tan head. The taste is quite malty, but has a little bitter kick to it. It has a very light mouthfeel. It is very drinkable. Works well washing down a spicy, hot salsa! Overall, i rate it quite high."
"D - I like this beer a lot. I think I could drink a few no problem."
"Mouth feel is very light and a bit under carbonated."
"Strong acidic aroma balanced by a mellow, slightly sweet, maltiness. Dark brown body with a lovely two finger thick tan head. Caramel malts, smooth fruits featuring apple and raisin with a strong hint of walnut in the finish. Great sipping beer and an interesting Belgian take on a basic Brown ale. Id love to have this fresh on draft."
"Overall, i give this beer more credit than before. I remember it being ultra sweet, but it's not bad at all, and for .99 a bottle, cant go wrong."
"I tried this beer in bottle at the Wild Wing Café in Marietta, GA. It pours into a standard pint glass a dark murky brown with little head and very little lacing. The smell was shocking a very deep musky malt scent that didnt set well with me. The flavor is very similar to the smell with a heavy malt taste. Its so malty and sweet that it is cloying. It does have a bit of hop bite at the finish but this beer is way out of balance for my tastes. The mouthfeel is moderate-heavy with an unpleasant slickness. I did not like this beer and it took all my willpower to finish it. I physically shuttered on the last sip."
"Overall- a Brown Ale that, unfortunately pulls its punches. Mediocre but not bad. I was hoping for so much more."
"Pours an amber, purplish color with light to medium head and little to no lacing. Smells of fresh fruit and caramel and a hint of a nutty scent. Tastes much of the same...I taste strawberry and grape in the mix along with all of the standard brown ale fair. Very smooth...goes down easy. Unlike some of the other reviews, I could drink a few of these easily. Depending on your taste, if you can't deal with a fruity, sweet ale then stay away from this one."
"Drinkability: Despite the sweet profile, I rather enjoyed this; just don't think I would want more than one at any sitting"
"All in all, a great brown ale if you are drinking a few pints. This could be a nice session beer in April or maybe even May. Among the best in class for the pricepoint."
"I would buy this one again."
"D - Super sweet. Drinkability is good when I am in the mood for this."
"Mouthfeel is thin and almost watery, but helps drinkability."
"Very nice,deep rich chestnut color. Great sweet, caramel like aroma. Malty and just slightly vinuous. Good, deep malty flavor. Again with the caramel sweetness. Very full body for only being 5%. Overall a very pleasurable beer. Somewhere I had read negative things about this beer. I cant remember where. Nevermind-well worth a try. Thanks mushroomcloud !!!"
"Pours a nice dark chocolately brown with a touch of red. Tan head quickly dissipates with very little carbonation going on. Nothing but sweetness in smell. A remarkable similarity to grap juice in aroma. Very sweet tastes of raisins, grapes, and plums with some matliness to finish it off with some dryness. Overall a very smooth, rich, and extremely pleasent beer. Definately one of the sweetest beers I've ever tried, but it isn't overly so. Enjoyed this one very much."
"For you home brewers, Tilburgs comes in some interesting 11.2 oz. bottles (like most beers of this style) which are unique in themselves and great for recapping."
"I poured this beer into my Unibroue tulip, resulting in a murky burgundy without particulates and at least two inches of heavy cappuccino-shaded head. The head settles down quickly and unevenly leaving pockets of lumpy head and sticky latticing on the rim of the glass. The initial smell is malty-sweet, with a mild candy sugar smell reminiscent of a Belgian Strong Ale, but considerably lighter. Upon pouring this beer, I also detected an unpleasant scent of burnt plastic, but as the beer warmed it went away. This beer has a rather mild, sweet and rather indistinct taste. Flavors present are sugar, dark berries and roasted grains. Tilburgs is an enjoyable session beer and for the price is a choice option."
"A sessionable brown that could easily make for many pint fulls. Not extraordinary but worth trying."
"poured a deep reddish-brown color with immense tannish head that had true staying power. Smell is a nice combination of nuts, caramel, molasses, and sweet fruit. Taste is truly exotic with enormous amounts of molasses, sweet dark caramel, roasted nuts and dark fruits combining together to form an exquisite creamy mixture that had a wonderful taste (I really like the taste..) Finishes with more caramel and molasses. Very enjoyable to drink. My glass was empty before I could complete this review. Definitely something to have again ( and again)"
"Easy drinking. Finishes with a little bit of the sour cherry tang and a very slight touch of burnt sugar. Nice on a hot afternoon. Refreshing."
"This was a good find. It is an impressive beer. Sweet, smooth and tasty. Very drinkable and worth trying."
"Oh well."
"330 mL bottle with no freshness date - served slightly chilled in a red wine glass. It has a 1 finger tan head that leaves nice lacing and it tops a brown/deep ruby body. It smells of caramel, anise, and fruity malts. The flavor matches this but adds a good sweetness, raisins, and other (tropical?) fruits. It has a medium body and a good mouthfeel. Overall it is good but not too complex. Wouldn't go out of my way to find it, except for perhaps the Heironymous Bosch painting on the label."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Drinkability... hell, it's a really nice brown ale. More like an American nut brown ale, IMHO, but good nonetheless."
"The smell is hard to figure out, but, is a combination of sweet fruitiness, slightly nutty and grape-like. There is a hint of sweet wine in the aroma. The taste is also grapey and like wine. The taste is smooth with very little hop flavor and maybe some hints of caramel."
"11.2 ounce bottle, w/o freshness indication. Pours dark caramel brown and clear, average tan head and minor lacing. Nose is of some dark sugar and raisins. This is a soft, delicate and subtle brown ale. Candi sugars evident but not over powering. Fruity and fairly sweet brew. More notes of raisins, caramel and cashews. this is a pleasant, drinkable little brew, worth a try"
"Brown in colour with some hints of red. Mild carbonation. Very sweet malty aroma with only the slightest hint of grassy hops. Sticky sweet malty flavors, along with vague notes of chocolate, roasted nuts, and spices. Good flavor concentration at the beginning, but fades into a somewhat watery finish. A little unbalanced in my opinion, although this really isnt a style that Im into."
"-UF"
"The beer pours a nice ruby red/brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich toasted malt scent with a fruity yeast aroma. The roasted malts add a nice ""brown"" aroma to it. The taste is great. It has a very smooth, malty flavor that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with roasted barley. It is roasted and creamy with a slightly dry, fruity finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very enjoyable Belgian dark. It's smooth and flavorful which makes it highly drinkable."
"Brown with a little red in it. I get a distinct, persistent aroma reminiscent of sea water, like the smell of live oysters and live fish. My mind races trying to account for this fact (true, there are some wines that display similar tendencies -- Manzanilla, Muscadet, etc. -- those are aged in barrels within earshot of the ocean. Could this be too?) Sweet nutty brown flavors melt silky-textured and dry yet kissed-with-saccharine. Very little bitterness and no hops bite. Cola flavors. Hmm. Strange beer. It tastes vaguely mass-produced and has little character, except for the fishy smell."
"And that ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" character on the bottle is frightening."
"A very nice drink. The play on sugar is almost overwhelming, but the results make it quite unique, interesting and appealing in a non-beer way ... if that makes any sense."
"Drinkability is not good much to sweet for me will be letting the wife finish these if she likes or save them for guests."
"11.2 oz bottle pours a clear dark brown body that is a brilliant ruby hue when held to ambient light. Small beige head disappears in seconds, leaving only a collar and a few patches of lace on the glass. Aroma is malty caramel, with a hint of chocolate, raisins, and coriander. Mouthfeel is light medium to medium in body with lively carbonation. Taste has a dark fruit component of figs and raisins, complimented by notes of chocolate, coriander, and white pepper. Some sour green apples are noted in the middle, along with some floral hops which add some needed bitterness. Finishes slightly sweet. I really didn't detect any significant yeast presence in this one, and the hops are overly subdued. Overall, a decent drinking brown ale that is worth a try. Thanks to mntlover for this one."
"Not bad considering the price ($5.79/sixer on sale @ Lowes Foods). Quite easy to drink and very non-threatening. Think of a so-so dubbel mixed 50/50 with Newcastle Brown Ale."
"First I would like to say, what the hell is up with these 11.2 oz. bottles! Anyways, The appearance is quite nice. Has a clear garnett color with great head retention. Sweet malts and grapefruit come out in the aroma. The taste is sweet almost candy like. This is a interesting brown ale to say the least. It was a good beer, but not something I would pick up on a regular basis."
"Not worth it, glad I didn't pay for it."
"Brown, cola-like and crystal clear, with a 1/2"" white head that fades to leave a creamy layer on the beer. Smells mostly of roasted malt, but slightly sour and grassy. Taste is creamy with roasted malt, fruity flavors, and a moderate hop bite. High carbonation, and very unique and delicious."
"Quite different from Belgian brown ale examples, this beer is fairly one-dimensional. Too sugary."
"Pours a cream, two-fingered head, fades quickly and leaves some lace. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Deep, amber color. Sweet nose. Starts with a light and sweet and finishes mellow but with a slight metallic aftertaste. This brewery's double and quad are much better. Wierd label. $1.90 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"Light brown color and a thin, off white head that clings a little to the glass. Aroma is very malty and aromatic. I detect some phenolic and candylike sweetness. Flavor is a sweet, malty sipping brew. Finishes sweet and malty. An enjoyable beer with some distinct ""Belgian"" character that is easily forgivable. If this was passed off as an English Brown, it would have failed on the phenolics alone!"
"Drinkability - one for the maltier side of BA. Palates that enjoy sweeter, sturdy beers may well enjoy this one, but it may be a bit much for volume quaffing."
"Better than I expected. Really could be a transition beer form starters to be introduced to maltier beers."
"A little lighter than a typicall brown ale. At first, I was quite impressed with the taste, I actually had the scratch out a 4.5 from my initial score. Man, this got sweeter and sweeter as I drank it to the point I almost put it down altogether. Perhaps this had to do with the particular bottle, I bought a six pack a few months back and could not recall such sweetness. Chewy almost. A small amount of lacing. The label is such an attraction as well...any theories on this one?"
"Clear brownish amber with a thick fluffy head comprised of mostly larger bubbles. Interesting aroma, yeasty,sugary,slightly fruity and floral. Body is a bit flat and thin. Flavor is unusual. Sweet with brown sugar, belgian yeast flavors but a bit light in the malt dept. Label gets style points for surrealistic art. Overall not my cup of tea."
"This is on display at Museo del Prado in Madrid. I had never need this guy's work before this beer....but I really like it!"
"I really like the color of this beer looks very nice. I would buy this beer again because it is a decent beer for a decent price."
"Pours a dark brown with a tan head that fades quickly. Smell is of Dark rum soaked fruits and caramel. Maybe even a bit of chocolate. Taste is Malty and sweet. Dark fruits and caramel again dominate the palate with some coffee notes coming through as well. Almost over whelming in the sweetness. Unfortunately the beer is kinda a one-trick pony. The flavours dont develop and while initially it is kind of tasty it gets old fast. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy. While I would drink this again it would have to be just one in an evening as I dont think I could have another it would just be too much."
"Flavors include caramel, orange, allspice? and hints of cocoa? Finish is failry long with a distinct nutiness. Well balanced hops throughout peeking through in the mid palate and again on the finish. This beer is incredibly pleasant and drinkable."
"Drinkability/notes: A most unusual beer, and one that seems to have little in common with brown ale, save its appearance. Still, its quite unique and would seem most pleasing on a cold and dark autumn afternoon."
"I bought a six pack for about $6.00 at a NJ beer store. Although this wasnt a world class beer, it was an excellent value. Its certainly worth picking up again."
"Still scratching my head about that label image choice. Even ""Christ Mocked"" would be better!"
"The taste is very pleasant. Nutty with a medium body of malt that finishes with a dark mellow smoothness. Pleasant bittersweet and nutty aftertaste. Im very impressed by this beer. Not too heavy or too light. I could drink this all the time."
"Dark and deep chestnut color, seems clearish. Lively head of 1/2 an inch of light tan foam. Good lace, rings with drips on the glass. Malty aroma, deep like cough drops and with some molasses elements. Flavor starts nicely, cocoa powder, slight ginger, and that molasses from the aroma. Mouthfeel is a bit light but the carbonation is low, giving a smoothness. Slightly watery at the finish with little to no hops to be found but with residual sweetness and ginger lingering into the aftertaste. Not a bad beer at all, a little boring for my personal tastes."
"After paying only $5.99 for a six pack at my local store in Baltimore I was nicely surprised by this beer. While not a home run, it is a tasty brew with just the right amount of complexity to make it a wonderful everyday beer. Pours a deep mahogany with a frothy head that dissipates somewhat quickly. Smell is of ripe fruit, candy sugars and malt. Taste is much of the same. Ripe plums, and maybe a bit of brown sugar. Quite sweet, but not over the top. Nice well balanced carbonation. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, but still passable. A very smooth, drinkable beer. Perfect for those ""not sure what I'll have"" evenings when you don't feel like cracking open a special beer but also don't want to go slumming."
"Tilburg's Dutch Brown Ale brewed by Koningshoeven for Bavaria is an interesting interperetation of an oud bruin. It pours a clear, reddish copper body beneath a short head of creamy, light-tan foam that drops readily to an average collar and leaves only minor lacing about the glass. The nose is quite enticing with bright notes of darkly caramelized sugars laced with fruit (berries, a touch of red cherry). More sugars appear in the flavor... some are clearly caramelish, but others are more like simple table sugar; although there is also a subtle chocolatey edge that hangs around in the background. There's less fruit than might be expected given the nose; and there's also a floral note that's no doubt due to some hops. It's quite unique. Clearly, this is an ale that's been sweetened to some extent, and yet there's no real sourness or tart fruit to off-set its bold sweetness; leaving it slightly off-balance. The body is solidly medium, and it's fine, restrained carbonation leaves it slightly viscous and very smooth across the palate; also lending to its impression of sweet, caramel-drenched maltiness. There is some hop bitterness present, but it's not noticeable until after the swallow when the sweetness has receeded and it appears at the back of the throat. Unique, rich and exciting!"
"Hmm very odd picture on the label Iam not gonna even attempt to figure that out,pours a light brown/amber with a creamy-like head that settles quickly with a small amount of lace.Aroma of sweet fruit and a little caramel makes me think this is gonna be pretty sweet.Taste isnt to overly sweet but lacks a little depth some light sweetness and toasted malt aftertaste but not much fruit wich I was looking for.Alot of malt but not refined enough I guess for me,a good beer but needs a little more for me."
"pours a deep brown color with a bubbly tan head. smells of roasted nuts. great malty taste. slightly nutty/biscuity malt flavor in this one. not terribly complex, but is pleasantly sweet. a bit of candi sugar seems to be in there as well. it has a medium body. very drinkable. No bitterness or hop profile, but a fairly thirst-quenching brown ale. compares EXTREMELY favorably to newcastle brown ale. it just packs a lot more flavor into the malt than newcastle does. Overall, a pretty damn good brown ale from the netherlands."
"A solid, slightly belgian-ized brown ale from a venerable brewery. Perhaps a bit too sweet, nearly cloying without the kind of complexity I'd like, but the six pack wasn't hard to finish at all. A bit of that teeth grinding sweetness I'm accustomed to with soda and macro beer. Probably nothing I'd get again, but a great recommendation to someone looking to get into quality beer. Very sweet, but relatively interesting."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Purchased in NC, so must be lower than 6% ABV. Might explain the lower body."
"Overall Impression: Good beer! Quite drinkable, tasty, well made. Just about everything I could want in a beer. To nit pick, maybe a bit mild in taste, but otherwise, I loved this beer!"
"Biggish, crusty, tan head has big cavities in it. That's why there's nice, thick, clumpy lacing. Beer is dark red/brown and clear. Very appealing. I get a nice, spicy, peppery, dark caramel candy in the nose. So far so good. Lots of pepper and spice in front. Tangy, too. Dark caramel middle shows a little sourish fruit. Wow. Just corn in the finish. Man, that's strange. Overall, a nice, spicy, dark, malty brew. But what's with that big corn finish?"
"When I poured this (in my ususal style 1/3 down the side , the rest down the middle) I got a large foamy light tan head. This beer is a dark reddish brown (mahogany?) colored brew.Very clear and clean, no cloudyness or sediment. A light belgian ale aroma ( what is that belgian sugars, special hops. I got to find out). There is an almost candy sweetness to the malt characteristic. Which is followed by a gentle bitterness at the end of the swallow with no back bite. Very easy drinking, goes down quickly. I'd be interested in finding out the abv% on this. It might be one of those sneaks up on you 6%ers."
"Appearance: reddish brown, clear, head fades rapidly. Smell: very sweet, noticeable nuttiness and caramel aromas. Taste: Sweet, malty, very nutty, slight fruitiness. Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth. Drinkability: Sweet, pleasent drink, not outstanding, but easy to take."
"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Oct 13th, 2003: Mahogany color with a medium light tan head. Thin and sticky lacing. Aroma of malt and nuts. Medium bodied with a nice caramel malt flavor, along with a little bit of hops. The finish is lightly hopped and nutty. Easy drinking overall."
"But...this is still damn tasty!"
"Pours with a massive rocky ivory head that slowly collapses upon clear russet-brown liquid. Lots of hay and grassy notes in the nose with slight maltiness creeping up behind. The first taste was fruity and chocolatey/malty sweet. Some brown sugar notes tasted as well, along with a pleasing Belgian yeast character in the aftertaste. Finished up sweet and satisfying...very tasty and drinkable."
"Clear reddish-brown color, decent size off-white head. Sweet sugar and caramel aromas, sweet and malty flavors, nice carbonation medium bodied, finishes with a lingering sweetness, not my favorite style but pretty drinkable, I can't complain since I got this bottle for free."
