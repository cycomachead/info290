"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and I thought it was just slightly above average for a Belgian Dark Ale, it was pretty smooth, but in the end I thought it was just a little bland and I wish the taste was as bright as the aroma.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, fairly clean, a little crisp, not filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one glass is a good amount for me, I could drink the whole bottle, but I think after one glass I would start to get bored with it.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both good and they were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, they weren't bad, but they could both use just a little work.  I don't think I would buy this beer again, but i wouldn't turn down a glass and i can't say I would recommend this as a great example of the style.  All in all I was a little indifferent about this beer, I didn't hate it,but I didn't love it either, and I wish it was just a little more complex and interesting. This beer made an Ok first impression for this Brewery and I would be interested in trying more of their beers.   I didn't mind this beer, but I think it needs a little work, better luck next time guys."

"O: Good drinkability. Nice Belgian Dark Ale"

"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before June 2015. Pours very hazy deep reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big chocolate, toast, caramel, pear, apple, raisin, brown bread, pepper, clove, brown sugar, toffee, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, toast, pear, apple, raisin, clove, pepper, brown bread, floral, brown sugar, toffee, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toast, brown bread, clove, pepper, pear, apple, raisin, floral, brown sugar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with an awesome malt/spicy flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian brown ale. All around great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall. I have to admit, this isn't among my favorite styles, but a drinkable beer to say the least."
"If the category of ""Belgian Brown Ale"" existed, this would be cinch for inclusion, even if the Belgian part is fleeting at best. A nice toasty, nutty, fruity brown ale, one that could teach the lads in Newcastle (or even Brooklyn, for the matter) a few things."

"Burgundy. Full of fruit flavors (plums, grapes as well as citrus in Rulles Blonde). Mouth malted barley and yeast, which adds the syrupy side. In addition to the dryness of the hops, there is a fruity interesting (probably due to the Amarillo hops) that is accompanying a persistent finish that offers a strong drought."
"From a 750ml crown top bottle. Very dark ale with a beige head, with a good head retention. Smell of chocolate malt. This beer has a taste of chocolate malt, some hard too find spices. This beer is like lace in the mouth, very tasty but easy drinking ale."
"Festival Bières et Saveurs 209. Pours brown with nice off-white head and gives off a malty aroma. Above-average mouthfeel from caramel. Malty taste and balanced, with a little chocolate, a little nuttiness and spice that is perhaps a dash of cinamon."
"This brew is a wonderful chestnut color with a thick, tightly packed tan head. The aroma is of chocolate, medium-roast malts, and a little dark fruit. Mmm...nice. The taste is semi-sweet, with a bit of yeast and pepper. Not much of a hop character at all, this beer is centered on the roasted flavors. Medium in body, and very smooth. It's a very drinkable brew."
"The beer tastes so light in a good way. The beer is light malty, larded by candisugar. Notes of dark fruit like dates and melon. This beer is very drinkable."
"Bottle from Lubière: Poured a dark brown color ale with a medium dark foamy head with great retention. Aroma of light caramel malt with very subtle Belgian yeast. Taste is smoother then expected with semi-sweet caramel malt, light Belgian yeast and some very low hops presence. Body is a bit thin and alcohol doesnt really show. Not bad but a bit too bland in my opinion."
"No freshness date. Yellowish head and a brown beercolor. Nose is lots of caramel, sweet malty, wortlike and litle roast. Taste is sweetish, slightly burnt, caramellic and light bitter. Overal giving me a insipid taste. Low carbonisation and this sweetish and dull taste makes mouthfeel just avarage as the rest of the brew is. Drinkability is ok cause there is no off taste but uninspiring IMO."
"No defect, but nothing to remember. Easy drinkable."
"Well Worth Finding  One of the Better 'New' Belgium Brunes."
