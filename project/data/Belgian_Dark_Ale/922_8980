3.51,-14.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a medium brown color with a bit off-white head and loads of lacing on the way down. The nose brings some faint notes of dark fruit plus a bit of brown sugar. The flavor is somewhat bitter and a bit too dry in the finish. Mild sweetness and faint dark fruit. Nothing complex or too compelling; probably worth a try though.","Thorpe429","Jul 02, 2011"
3.46,-16,4,3,3,4,4.5,"Clear dark red brown color with a large, frothy - creamy, good lacing, fully lasting, off-white head. Aroma is light to moderate malty, brown sugar, roasted notes, black berry, light to moderate yeasty, spicy, light notes of coriander and pepper. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter with a long to average duration. Body is medium, texture is oily to watery, carbonation is soft","KrautAficionado","Nov 23, 2008"

3.49,-15.3,4.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Taste was not exciting as I was expecting. Indeed I was expecting much from this trappist, I am nothing that in love with the Achel Brune 8Â°. But as for the Petit Orval, this seemed to me as a little sister, with less flavor, less taste and less mouthfeel. Obviously the drinkability is at higher levels, that's why they made it like this.","Voss","0"
