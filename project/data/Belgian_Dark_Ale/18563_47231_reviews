"Overall: A pretty interesting and tasty experiment with a Belgian style. Th spices blend in well without overwhelming the subtle fruits."
"O= A surprisingly quality beer. I wasn't expecting much and have sort of been putting off trying it because it didn't sound great. I bought it because it was local and I will buy it again because it's good. Let this baby warm up a little for full enjoyment."

"Low carbonation with smooth mouthfeel and sweet and cloying finish. Overall this is probably the lightest Belgian Dark I've had. It was very drinkable but lacked carbonation and didn't have a very strong bouquet. Would drink again, but probably won't seek out."
"I like this one quite a bit, although it doesn't go as far as I'd like with flavor, for the price. Nonetheless, one of the best efforts from Lift Bridge."

"This is like a Welch's Juice Concoction gone wrong. Not bad by any means, but more of a beer with too much going on in the bottle & nothing to bring it all together. Mediocre, odd, & not terribly satisfying."
"Big thanks goes out to MBrausen for sending me this one for the sole purpose of being able to tick it! Served from bottle into a Duvel Meyers tulip. Poured a deep yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, clove, bread, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, clove, bread, fruit, subtle dark fruit, and very subtle alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. The aroma on this one really reminded me of a nice Belgian Pale Ale with a touch of alcohol. I really wish it would have been a little more complex than it was to keep the nose wondering what it was up to. The flavor however made up for this as it was quite nice and balanced and smooth. This fact made this brew quite easy to drink and enjoyable. Worthy of trying if you get the chance or just want to tick it."
"Overall: Drink this one served barely chilled or at room temps to get the most from the unique flavors. It's a decent and unique beer, but probably something I wouldn't seek out again. I'd drink it with no problem if someone offered one...after letting it warm up quite a bit first."
"O - A truly unique beer. This gets better as it warms up and would make a fabulous dessert beer."
"O-tasted like a golden ale to me on tap it was pretty good i have a bottle yet to open.try this one on tap if can"
"O - My experiences with Lift Bridge brews have been hit and miss. I love the Saison but was not impressed with the Crosscut Ale. The Biscotti falls more towards the Crosscut - not a bad beer but not something I need to have again."
""
"O - a solid made beer, just was not getting the tastes out of the beer described on the bottle. Really wished there was more vanilla and anise flavor."
"A good effort but not as good as it should be. Definately worth trying and my first since they moved brewing to their home location."
"Overall: Pretty good, but could certainly use some tweaking to make the flavors stand out more."
"Mouthfeel was ok but i thought a bit syrupy."
""
"Taste is a little sweet too be sure with some strange funk. Not funk in the Belgian sense but just funky and not really good tasting. Mouthfeel is nice and full. Overall not a beer I would suggest or buy again. I think they did well with their spices in the Commander. I think they tried and hoped to repeat the awesomeness that was the commander with different spices. Really just didn't work. However GLAD I have a commander downstairs. Good brewery in it's infancy I think."
"I actually don't think this drinks that well. Really dry and the flavor is kind of one dimensional and boring to me. I had higher hopes especially after The Commander, but this just is not worth the $10/bottle price tag at all. Not a bad beer, just didn't do anything for me really."
"I was being kind and finished my 3oz pour at the party. Anywhere else that would have been a drain pour. Hopefully that was a fluke. I had it on tap once before and it was much better that time."
""
"Served on tap. Poured into a 10oz snifter with a little white head that dissipated instantly. Had a spicy and malty aroma with a taste that pretty much fit the aroma add vanilla. The mouthfeel was medium and smooth which eluded to a high drinkability factor. Another great introductory offering from Lift Bridge. And although it doesn't taste as much like biscotti as I had hoped, it's still good enough to just keep on drinking."
"Just because this beer didn't remind me immediately of Biscotti doesn't mean it isn't a great beer. Because it is! I really liked it, actually."
