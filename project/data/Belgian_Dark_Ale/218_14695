I suppose the relatively low abv is the problem as a Belgian Dark should have more complexity, not bad just a slight bit better than an average american brewer would make this. Pass.

3.48,-0.3,4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours out a gorgeous copper ruby cherry oak hue, lots of carbonation, and the best head retention I've seen from De Koninck yet. The head rests at a thick creamy off-white bubbly cap and remains that way. A sticky wall of lacing. Sweet toffee malt, cherries, and rum soaked dates and raisins on the nose. Plums and a buttery profile catch my attention shortly after as well. The flavour can't live up to that aroma though, and falls apart quickly. Light buttery toffee malt up front, almost bitter preserved fruits in the middle, with practically an anticlimactic finish. The flavour is subdued and watered down, regardless of what it is aiming for. A buttery coating on the lips for the finish however. Disappointing. The mouthfeel is a bit fuller to what I've become accustomed to from De Koninck's line thus far, fuller and creamier, but still light in its way. The visuals, smells and texture of this beer are very fine, but the flavour is bland bland bland in comparison, cannot maintain the rest of the glory that this ale wishes to tout. It starts off well, but can't keep it up. I'd pass on this one next time. I enjoy a good looking beer, but if the flavour can't follow that up, then there's no point in the end.","IronDjinn","Aug 29, 2005"
3.88,11.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Best by 10/12/04, so I'm over a year late. The color is a hazy, dark cherry red with a large, light brown head. Thick chunks of sediment float around in the beer. Aroma has a vague spice smell atop of dark malts and alcohol. Taste has a dark earthy malt flavor joined by a sweet, sugary Belgian flavor. The taste also has a bit of dark fruit and cola flavors. A touch of alcohol is in the mix throughout. Towards the finish a ribbon of spice pops in. Good stuff here, I wish everything this far past it's ""best by"" date were this good. Overall malt flavor could have been stronger, but this was enjoyably subtle.","Gagnonsux","Jun 22, 2005"

3.15,-9.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"My first review! Well, I looked on my beer rack and tried to pick out the beer with the worst looking label design just to get it out of the way to replace it with a better one. What I found was a perfect middle of the road beer. Poured it into a large chalice and let it rest for about 10 minutes before drinking. Huge head that took a while to disipate, with a bit of lace. Smelled pretty decent. Major carbonation after the first sip and throughout. The three most prevalant tastes to me were; hazelnut, corriander and some kind of fruit. Maybe something like and apricot or plum. I pretty much got what I expected. Not a great beer, not a bad beer. It was on sale apparently as I noticed the $3.99 tag on the cork, so I would say it was worth a try for that. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again, but it wasn't bad for the price. Overall a pretty average beer.","GClarkage","Jun 20, 2004"

The body is light and sweet, spiced beyond belief, but not so much that it overcomes the beer. I mean, this a good Belgian strong, the kind with arms that don't crush you in their embrace. I understand why this is a winter seasonal. The spicing is like apple pie without the apples. Sugarplum fairies? perhaps. I like the way it coats the tongue with flavorful spices. Kind of reminds me of a tripel in that way....","twilight","Feb 18, 2004"

4.42,26.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"There is an earthiness to this ale that is appropriate for its origins.

Nose has some sugary candy-like sweetness to it along with some earthy aromas in the background. Medium in bodya bit thinner than Id expected. Taste begins with sweet malts and a bit of Belgian spice followed by some smoky and peaty notes but is lacking in depth throughout the tasting. A decent beer that I have no problem drinking, but I would have to say that this is a disappointment considering the quality of the other De Koninck beers I have tried.","Morris729","Beers"
4.4,26.1,4,4,4.5,4,5,"A crystal clear, scarlet-tinted deep-amber body rests gently beneath a tall head of rocky off-white foam that holds well and initially leaves thin, creamy rings and splashes of lace about the glass. The nose expresses the typical, dryish spice character of De Koninck. In the flavor, dried dark fruits (prune, raisin) and subtle yeasty spice (sublime cinnamon) appear before a well-balanced, solid bitterness comes into play. It's a touch musty; and there's a very deep caramelization to its subtly sweet toasty malt before leafy hops appear. It finishes dry with a touch of fruit, earth, and must. An enjoyable beer that tempts with its subtle complexities and satiates while beckoning another sip. Excellent drinkability rounds things out. Not unlike the other De Koninck beera, it's not a head turner but the bottle will empty surprisingly quickly. Great during the holidays before, during, and after a meal.","NeroFiddled","0"

And  this was three bottles away from the two rows of Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru which was retailing for the same price, $6.99. Its just no contest Im afraid.
