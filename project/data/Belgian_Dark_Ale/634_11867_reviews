"O-This is a one-hit wonder of a beer, but I found it strangely good. It is very sugary, and would make a nice dessert brew, but compared against the best dark ales, it is not as complex or intriguing as it could be."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a hazy, dark caramel amber with a fine, thin off-white head with decent retention and lacing. Classic Belgian dark aroma of caramel malt, dark fruit, Belgian yeast and hints of light apple juice. Flavor starts with somewhat subdued caramel malt, apple and dark stone fruit, and Belgian yeast, then the flavor quickly falls off leaving a slight metallic bitterness. A very odd flavor profile. Medium bodied. The initial flavor is light, but sweet and flavorful, but the finish is abrupt and off-putting. Puzzling."
"Overall a good, hearty and warming paters beer. Them monks got class"

"Overall: A good BDA that I got from volunteering the BBF last year. Good to know it held up for over a year. A have two other styles from the brewery that I am looking forward to this week."

"Some kind of sourness in the smell makes me deciding not to finish my glass. It is drinkable, but when you have better beers in your fridge...."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, best by 5/2013. Pours slightly hazy reddish brown color with a nice 2-3 finger billowing light khaki head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts forever. Some nice soapy lacing on the glass; with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of raisin, plum, cherry, caramel, molasses, herbal, candi sugar, biscuit, earth, and yeast spices. Some nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of plum, raisin, molasses, caramel, biscuit, herbal, candi sugar, yeast spices, and a bit of a metallic flavor; but it isnâ€™t too bad. Lingering notes of dark fruit, herbal, molasses, biscuit, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Good flavor balance and complexity. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. Alcohol is hidden well with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a very enjoyable Belgian dark ale. I would not mind having it again sometime."

"O) A pretty decent brew. I think if I happen upon it again I would drink it again."

"Overall: I'm simply not in love with this beer. It's not that bad, but it sort of rubs me the wrong way."
"The appearance is pretty normal for Belgian Dark Ale. Tight bubbles dissipate quickly and leave little in the way of a head. The smell is nice and gets better as it warms and it comes out. Smell of vanilla and spice and dark fruit. The taste is not too bad but left a little of an off taste on the palate. Overall not a bad dark some good qualities but pretty middle of the road."
"O - Worth trying, but not a regular beer to seek out. I acutally liked it as part of a belgian sampling with dinner. Treat it as such."
"This beer needs some body desperately. It drinks like overly sweet, vaguely malty water. I'm not too impressed."
"O- This beer has some nice flavor and depth but it is pretty soft and turns watery and thin. The fizz really covers a lot of the character as the beer opens."
"(D)- A great Belgian Dark Ale. Smooth and rich yet clean and refreshing. I enjoyed this one very much!"
"A decent, but not outstanding drop, overall. Lack of excitement does not equal lack of appreciation."
"It is an okay dark ale, perhaps a bit sweet."
"Really, this is ridiculously sweet. Relies too much on candi sugar."
"Decent Belgian Dark, but there are many more beers that I would pass this brew over for."
"D: The beer is extremely easy to drink. I definitely want to try this again because I like the combination of sweetness and flavors of dark fruits."
"The beer was smooth and non abrasive, in other words the carbonation was on the lower end. As I finished the glass, I noticed thin streaks of lacing randomly dotting the glass. I am a big fan of Belgian beers, but I can confidently say this is my least favourite of them all - not bad but the least favourite till now. Maybe I will give it another shot after a month or so and see if there is a variance in my experience."
"Overall, a decent example of the style. Worth a shot if you see it."
"Overall a good, hearty and warming paters beer. Them monks got class"
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Medium-strong carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy brown color. Yeast left in bottom of bottle. Nose is dark fruit. Flavor is dark fruit and caramel but finish has metallic hints. $19.95 for a 4-pak of 330ml bottles from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy yet chewy at the same time, with a medium body and very light carbonation. Easy to drink as this brew hides the alcohol well. A good beer, but it just didn't blow me away."
"1 1/2 finger tan head, medium dissipation with big lacing. Dark brown body with some red highlights when held up to the light. the nose is hard to break down, though the belgian yeast in noticeable, I picked up raisins, molasses and faint hops. The taste is quite complex, lots of dark fruit, raisins, dark cherries, plums, a bit of candi sugar, hops are not very noticeable, could have used a bit more assertive hops to balance the sweetness. Mouthfeel is full with a medium dry finish, not sticky sweet. Drinkability is quite high, a relatively low ABV for the style. I was glad to have this quite rare tap version, though not something I'd have again."
"M/D- medium bodied, low carbonation. drinkable but a little weak for my likeing, especially at 6% ABV. would like a little more of everything."
"Drinkability: Decent price, fits the style somewhat (may be missing some berry/dark fruits action). Doesn't stand out from others of the same style but most likely enjoyable to people who like other beers from the same brewery."
"Conclusion: This showed promise at first, but the odd, sharp flavors on the finish kinda ratchet this one down...I honestly RARELY do this (a couple times a year), but I made it through about 2/3 of this...the rest is (quite sadly) going down the drain..."
"Not my favourite beer, not bad, but nothing more then that."
"Kind of average in my opinion."
"Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, or medicinal. Not really much to count off for, but nothing to write home about, either. Drinkable enough, but I wouldn't recomend paying for more than one of these."
"The aroma is sweet and grassy with dust, caramel, and lightly fruity. The appearance is amber brown with a foamy head. The flavor is like the aroma with a good hop bitterness to balance the caramel malt. The palate is thin but OK. The finish is a touch metallic. Overall I like it."
"Ugh, I had a bottle in Watou and found the same disappointing metallic flavor that I assumed was a one-off flaw in the blonde. Alas. Otherwise it's a cool-looking ruddy brown with a thin tan head in the chalice. The aroma and malt flavor are a sweet and very smooth complex of caramel and toffee with a bit of raisin. The metal was less prevalent in this beer, but no less shameful."
"OVERALL: A sweet malt heavy beer that's decent, but nothing special. Not something I'd turn down, but also not something I'd go looking for. Average."
"M&D: slightly sour-sweet and thin-ish in the finishing touch due to the residual sugary touch, while the carbonation goes light and suitable for such a light-flavoured Dubbel. This is a simple (not simplistic) ale that is easy-drinking and reasonably delicious with a certain depth."
"This is my favorite of the Het Kapittel Beers that I rated this week."
"Worth a try."

"Poured into my Ommegang chalice. Looks like a decent dubbel. Head swells to 1/2 in and falls quickly to reveal a few lines of sticky lacing. Looks like a breakfast roast coffee with slight translucency. Mild carbonation. It smells like big chocolate malt, biscuit, and candi sugar. No hop smell, just sweetness. The taste is pleasant, yet out of balance. The sweetness tastes good, but there is very very little hop, dryness, or complex alcohol to round it out. This would be great with just a little kick of saaz at the end and maybe a slightly lower final gravity. This would be a wonderful base for something that could be amazing. I would like to get ahold of the recipe and give it just a little tweak."
"D: Easy to drink... low ABV. Nothing really exciting about this beer to speak of. Solid Belgian Dark Ale."
"This beer is darn good and improves as it warms to allow flavors to be released."
"D: Nice double style"
"Flavorful beer. I'd have again. Probably better examples of the style. Priced right."
"D- Quite drinkable for a belgian at only 6% abv. A very enjoyable brew, not to expensive."
"I'd like to try a newer bottle of this to compare. Overall this was an ok beer, although not something I would want more than a couple of at one time."
"Overall: very nice beer. Well balanced and highly recommended."
"From a Kapittel gift-pack that included four beers from a Morris County liquor store, this beer pours an attractive bronze-copper appearance with impressive foamy head... a sweet-smelling, caramel flavored beer with Belgian sugars replete with a malty, thick, rich flavor that is really satisfying... really liked this brew... hits home with a thick, rich, satisfying taste... good mouthfeel with easy drinkability for a relatively low alcohol percentage... goes down very smooth... tastes like buttered caramel and toffee... good stuff... Recommended..."
"Poured into my Maudite snifter with an amazingly luscious head (2/3 foam; 1/3 beer). Head dissipated quickly and left ample residue as it subsided. Scent of malt and dark fruit (figs, prunes and raisins) as well as a mild hint of alcohol. Color was ruby-brown/red; not quite opaque, but very dark with little light penetration. Mouthfeel was watery, flat and lacked any liveliness, which was quite surprising considering the head. Flavor was lackluster and the nose poorly translated into flavor. In terms of drinkability, you can certainly drink quite a few in a sitting, but not really worth the effort as there are better representations of the style out there."
"D: A very tasty, good quality Belgian Dark Beer. The Pater is definitely the favourite of the 3 beers I have had from the Het Kapittel brand. Definitely a repeat buy when I go back up to Walnut."
"Review translated from french 5-26-2008."
"D - I think its worth a try its good for a couple of drinks"
"Drinkability- I'm not a good judge of Belgian beers, but I like this stuff. Which probably means real waffle-heads don't like it, but the rest of us would find it a good introduction to Belgian styles."
"Overall Impression: Very complex beer. Crazy complexity with a different flavor than I have ever tried. Not one of my favorites but you won't be disappointed."
"Taste is caramellic and sweet malty, with no room for any bitterness, only a very low bitterness to support the malt. Liquorice and a light roast. A very smooth mouthfeel and a medium body. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and dry with some sweet malty caramel. which lingers."
"Great caramel color, aroma and flavor, lack of overall depth in the latter two though keeps the beer from being outstanding. Balance between the low alcohol and sweetness is just about perfect. The depth they did achieve is probably about as much as you can get in a 6% Belgian. Very very very easy to drink, an evening of these would be nothing to complain about."
"Mouth: Very small strong carbonation immediately, tickling the tip of my tongue. Good milk chocolate flavor all the way through, accented by some watermelon taste, and a finish of roast malt. The middle of the mouth seems under stimulated, but I really enjoy everything else. A bit of metalicity, but maybe because it's very cold."
"Purchased: Park Lane Liquors, Lancaster CA"
"-Oelergud"
"Decent belgian dark- nice frothy pour, sticky lace. Strong aromas of dried fruits- currants, raisin and a great spicy balance. Not too sweet, but definately a presence of caramel sugars. Nice finish with an oily hop profile which allows the spicy sweetness to continue to the end. Not as dynamic as others of the style, but a refreshing intro to the dark belgians."
"D: I found this to be enjoyable. The low abv and subdued sweetness make this an easy drinker."
"I felt this was very average. Poured a reddish brown colour with a huge sandy blonde head that dissolved into a thin blanket of frost in about 40 seconds. Smell was both malty and candy sweet, and a bit sour, as well. Taste was a bit bland, but not bad. Short stint of bitterness shows up in the middle for a split second. Not a terrible brew, just very average for the style."
"Drinkability: Too sweet."
"The mouthfeel was slightly syrupy which matched well with overall taste making it a highly drinkable, sessionable beer. I also enjoyed the artwork on the label, 4 monks drinking. A certified Abby Ale and a great beer, a must try Belgian, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Remembering that this is not a Strong Dark, it has plenty of flavor for the style; overall, however, it is just a touch under-attenuated for my tastebuds"
"Faint malt aroma, no hops to speak of. Pours a cloudy dark brown with a fine, tan head, almost a mousse. Very smooth mouthfeel with a light back bone of malt with a finish of noble hop bitterness. Esters a subdued for this variety. Nice drinkability; an excellent session beer. Aroma - 7; Appearance - 2; Flavor - 11; Mouthfeel - 3; OI - 7 (30/50)."
"330 ml bottle, bought in Frederikshavn, Denmark, as ""Kapittel Watou Pater"" (no ""Het"" on the label anymore). ABV is 6.0%. Clear and beautiful reddish brown colour, large and lasting light tan head. Nice malty aroma with notes of caramel and bakery, hints of wood, Christmas spices and dark fruits. Flavour is malty sweet but also fruity and zesty, quite nice. Some spices in the background. Definitely not a bad beer, but a tad too sweet to make me ecstatic."
"A light and easy to drink belgian brown."
"I found this beer to be unusual and tasty. Sort of a belgian old ale. Interesting fruit complexity and malt profile. Mustyness is what keeps me coming back, but then again I like the olde ale style almost as much as a belgian dark."
"Yummy, yummy...what more need be said...I like it. It works. I'd have another. Please?"
"I'd say this beer is ""ok""... pretty average and non-complex."
"Pours a clear, deep ruby red with a nice and tall head building to two fingers in my goblet. It is a light cream, and is retained well, leaving some good lacing. Smell is rich and fruity, but a bit muted, with notes of dark fruits and raisin, spices, and a yeasty backdrop. Taste falls flat. Bitter spices and a tealike note, but where did the fruits and yeast go? Mouthfeel is watery and flat, despite the visible carbonation rising. Drinkability is good, but it's just not much of a beer."
"Taste; a bit sweet with lots of caramel and bread dough flavors going on here. As this warms the Belgian spices and fruits make an appearance, along with a bit of a hoppy bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and just a little on the dry side."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"I'd hoped it would be better than it turned out to be. It looked all right I guess, murky brown color with some decent foam which didn't last very long. The smell was more sour than I expected. I kind of expected more of a bready yeast aroma like St. Bernardus Pater. The taste was slightly sour too, which didn't meld well with the sugars and other flavors in the beer. I won't be getting this again."
"D- good sipper, might get old fast"
"D - Very drinkable. It is a bit strong, but would session well. It goes well with food, and I wouldn't mind having it again."
"Pours nice dark amber that's murky and very pater-ish. Head was a little cola-like, but laced pretty well for me. Smells of honey and grass, with those tastes leading the first sip. Middle bits are lemoned sweet tea, finishing off with stronger, more bitter black tea. Maybe some wheat bread down below all the rest. Very syrupy texture that is as bereft of carbonation as possible without being entirely flat. Despite, or in light of that, though - very drinkable."
"No freshnessdate carved. Some yellowish head soon falling to just some loating leftovers at the side of the glas. Dark brown clear beer with red hint in it. Nose is very sweet and greenmalty and having a wortnose. Oxidation certainly did it's part in this one and wonder if botlefermentation was even started. Taste is very sweet and somehow also thin bodied. Is there sacharine in this product, dunno but certainly sweet. Some caramellic and slightly burnt maltyness also there but bitterness in my opinion low dosed even with the bitter yeasttaste that it also shows. Drinkable beer but not really my type of beer and IMO misses something."
"Drinkability- Wondering if this is the natural taste, or did I get one that was starting to turn. Only grabbed one, so I don't have one to compare against. Awkward and strange taste. I'll pass if this is the true taste. Not horrid, but not really pleasing."
"11.2 oz bottle pours a cloudy dark amber color with a huge creamy light brown head that leaves lots of lacing in my glass. Honey, nutty and fruity aromas, pears, brown sugar and honey flavors. Medium bodied with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, finishes on the sweet side."
"A dark brown beer with deep ruby highlights. Has a very big light brown head and good lace. Hints of candy and apple along with some malt sweetness and a strong yeast note in the aroma. Some prickly carbonation and a light bitterness at the back of the throat. A hint of tabacco and some sweetness are washed away too quickly by the overall watery charater of this beer. Not bad tasting but not worth a second."
"Part of a 4 beer sample pack. A clear stained and varnished medium cherrywood color with a big-bubbled head that rises over an inch to begin with but doesn't last that long. Laces are attractive, delicate small patches with lots of pattern and detail. Bright aroma, slight yeast with a sweetened cherry back tone. Mouthfeel registers as light-medium, most of the carbonation seems spent on the foam. The flavor is not as layered as the smell, diminished, overtly sweet (as in unfermentables) with a sense of peach that fades into the background mid mouth. Doesn't generate much of a sense of change or deeper flavors, by the end of it there's a bit of an impression of the sugar water you put out for hummingbirds. OK quaffability, not a lot going on here, in my opinion."
"Het Kapittel Pater certainly looks the part of a quality Belgian ale. Unfortunately, it tastes like the poor stepchild of Belgian brewing. Not to denigrate American brewers (since they brew my favorite beers/styles), but what it really tastes like is an attempt by a less than talented American craft brewer to duplicate the Belgian dark ale style. While it probably isn't quite as bad as I've made it out to be, it's certainly disappointing."
"At first sip it may not impress you (and it certainly won't overwhelm you!), but this is an easy drinking charmer that has just enough character to keep you coming back for more!"
"33 cl bottle dated best before 7/07. Pours a light orangy copper color with a bubbly light beige head. Head retention is excellent. Some honeyish and grainy light malt aromas mixed with some lighter tropical fruit aromas. Slightly musty and faintly hoppy. Delicately balanced, this beer is quite delicious. Faint fruity sweetness mixed with roasted malts and candi sugars and a moderate hoppy finish. Very faint pluminess. Wickedly drinkable and thoroughly enjoyable. Very faint metallic taste is slightly off, but not distracting."
"This is a decent brew, but the price can't be justified (I got a mixed 4 pack for $13), especially when you have something like New Belgium Double going for $6/sixer."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Part of a variety four pack box."
"Brown and clear with a nicely retained dollop of cream on top. Aromas of spiced raisins, pecan bark and canned pears are inflected with notes of black pepper. On the palate it slides quickly into thin, sugary flavors that are weakly influenced by cliche flavors of spices, nuts and fruits. It's dry and short. One might argue that these are good ""crossover"" beers -- their merit being their blandness. I think that excellence is usually the surest conversion point, and this is not excellent."
"Great looking beer. Nice foamy head with good lacing. Dark orange color. Maybe even a hint of orange smell. Great roasted flavor. A ery worthy representative of my favorite style of beer. The mouthfeel has just the right amount of bubbles. Almost perfect. All this adds up to a perfect score for drinkability."
"Drinkability Â– What a find! I stumbled onto this at Bottleworks and couldnÂ’t be happier. It was truly a pleasure to consume."
"This brew is made up of a hazy amber body, with a bubbly tan head on the top. Good lace. The scent has some plum and malt aspects to it. The taste is mainly sweet malts with some dark fruits as well. Light floral hop presence. Med-full mouth. Pretty good beer, nothing amazing but it will do."
"This beer poured a dark red amber color and formed a nice foamy off white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation was present. There was surprisingly very little aroma to this beer. What little I could detect seemed to be malt. A flavor of malt, caramel and some unidentifiable spices. The finish was almost metallic and a touch astrigent. Not really impressed with this one."
"It pours a ruby-brown with a ligth tan head and leaves some nice lace on the glass. The aroma is sweet and malty with some yeasty and spicey character in the nose. A metallic taste hits me up front, which is a turn off. It is malty and there are tastes of some dried fruit and it finishes with a yeast character. The aftertaste almost reminds me of iced tea. It is not a bad beer, but it lacks depth and complexity and the metallic notes are not good."
"Bottle - Poured a deep murky amber brew with a nice huge foamy white head that's long lasting. ABV is bit too omnipresent but excellent carbonation. Taste is sweet with some quite complex mix of spice. I notice that some of the other review mentioned a metallic taste, which I have heard of before. If I recall well, the metallic taste is from the hops and usually goes away after the bottle is aged a bit."
"Presentation: 33 cl Bottle with green & tan label with a monk enjoying a fine ale. Appearance: Nice light brown/reddish color- somewhat cloudy with a few small chunks of yeast floating in the mix. A moderate head that thins very quickly. A moderate amount of carbonation in the beer that feeds the head to keep it from disappearing completely. Aroma: Not a lot to say. I don't have the best nose around, but there is a weak aroma of malty sweetness and little else. Taste: A nice mix of sweetness with a slight bite. The sweetness is stronger. Alcohol shows up towards the end of the swallow. Some spice flavors, very subtle. Quite tasty and drinkability is high, if not overly complex like some other Belgian offerings."
"Mmm...a nice little beer for my 250th review. Thanks to my friend that provided this one...most appreciated. This is the first time I've had an actual monk's beer (depending on whether you count Leffe or not), and it's a unique experience...not enough to make me put on the robes and take the vows, but I'd have it again!"
"Cheers to the BelgianBum up the road for this one."
"(11.2 oz. / 330ml)"
"While not the best dark ale out there, Het Kapittel Pater is certainly a good choice."
"Something of a pastry mixed with a christmas ale and some wild belgian brew. I wasn't sure what to make of it. But ""he likes it; he really likes it!"" Dark in color, thin head. Heavily spiced nose -- plums, exotic plant roots, ginger, perhaps? Sweet, initial malt flavors are balanced by something of a hop presence but also by a masked acidic quality. Subtle and simple, I find this very drinkable. I feel as though I drank this too quickly to catch all its subtlties, but perhaps not. I'll have another in a month or so to see."
"As it sets in my triple glass a transpicuous deep amber to mahogany color, the head skeletal and what was there evaporated quite quickly, color a light tan, the lace is marginal at best. Nose heavy malt sweetness, hints of plums, crisp and clean with the start sweet and loaded with malt, top is middling. Finish has a pleasant acidity, the hops pertinent to the style, dry lingering aftertaste, not sure I care much for this beer, and maybe another sample in a couple of weeks might change my mind, average at best."
