"Aroma of roasted malt, light chocolate, coffee, molasses. Taste roasted malt, bitter chocolate, faint nuttiness smokeiness."

"I seem to be on a roll of not really liking Stillwater bews. Actually I wish they would make their labels more legible and informative. From the 12 oz can purchased at 4505 Burgers & BBQ in San Francisco."

"Looks like a porter. Smells like a watered coffe. Tastes like watered coffee. Feels like light carbonated water.  Will not buy again. Especially for $18 for a 6 pack."
"surprised to see this rated so low, it was a very enjoyable can of beer. i think ive seen this artwork on their beer before, but i am all for recycling. i like this one, although there isnt a whole lot that i found belgian about it, even though it is listed as such. for me this was a well hopped and well carbonated drinkable dark ale that showcases the best of both a distinct hop structure and fun dark grain that doesnt bring much bitterness to the mix but gleefully provides a roasty base. the yeast was almost nondescript for me, really unadventurous and certainly lacking the belgian qualities, but i dont wish for more yeast taste here, i like the way the grain is predominant, not chocolate or burnt barley, but somewhere in that happy dark medium. the beer is also remarkably low on the tannin front, which for me here allows for a mire drinkable dark brew, less harsh and textured than others, its actually quite light in feel with fine carbonation even though the head doesnt last long. when i first got introduced to these guys, i loved everything the made. since then, i have been let down but several, but its nice to see them continue to push in new directions. i think this one is a success, and maybe judged a little harshly on here."
"This pours a very dark brown color with a thick foamy head. The aroma is bold with lots of toasted and roasted malts and grains. The taste is heavier than most porters with lots of dark fruits and grains. It finishes with a lingering toasted caramel flavor. Overall, itâ€™s quite good and interesting. Very appealing to those dark beer lovers!"
"I won't get this again. Off flavor and smell."
""
"Overall: This is one of those beers where the whole is less than the sum of the parts. It has a nice, full flavor, but some of the funky/yeasty taste is a little uninvited. It's decent, but probably a one-time affair."
""
""
"Darker tasting where the chocolate is closer to bitter dark.  The body is notably thin and the carbonation elevated.  Good bitter hop pop in the swallow leaving an aftertaste of unsweetened cocoa."

"(3.55) O:  BA lists this as a dark belgian, thought it was more of a black ipa. Ok drinkability,but nothing that stands out."
""
"Another reviewer astutely called it ""like a combination between a porter and a saison"".  I think that is spot on, but that just doesn't work for me."

"Honestly this was a bit of and a dissapointment; recommended to me as a schwarzbier but it's hardly that. Not really a Belgian dark ale either. Guess it pays to check BA sometimes before buying!"

"I Crack!ed the CAN open and a snake began slithering out of the opening with its fangs bared hungrily. No, instead, I got a spray of beer from a super-full CAN. I grabbed the snake, I mean, CAN by its tail aand began an inverted Glug until the head formation became too much to allow me to CANtinue and I set it back down. The pseudo-cascade was quite evident in this one and as it settled, it formed three dense fingers of deep-tan/light-brown head with excellent retention. While I waited for things to settle, I looked about for the snake, which had seized the opportunity to slither off. Color was Very Dark Brown to Black, but not Opaque (SRM = > 34, "

"It's light, dry, crisp and refreshing in a body that isn't thin.  It doesn't bite too hard and runs very clean and smooth with a little of a not-quite-mineral edge to it."

"Pours very dark, almost black, but the body is medium to light. It's got a nice, frothy head, which together with the color makes it a very appealing looking beer. Taste is lightly roasted, almost cola-like. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. A decent, easy-drinking dark beer that might have stood out in 1983, but nothing special these days, and at $12.99, seriously over-priced."
"Notes: Black in color beneath a deep tan head. Excellent head retention. Very good lacing. Aroma of soft roastiness and dark chocolate. The flavor follows suit with a bit more depth, including notes of chickory, nuts (I'm thinking mainly filberts and a little bit of peanut), medium caramel, and grain. There's also a touch of plain sugar to it, mainly found in the finish. No noticeable yeast character except that it's very subtly fruity with a touch of red berry. The bitterness is moderate, and there's just a light touch of dark malt acidity. Some lightly floral, grassy, and leafy hops come through, mainly at the swallow and into the gently lingering finish. It's nice that the roastiness is kept in check, leaving it round and smooth. Pleasant, and quaffable."
"O: Really good and really underrated. Don't buy it thinking you're getting a BSDA. It's definitely more like it's description. A Black Ale."
"A big thanks to the creator of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts. Taste is roasted malts, hops, a bit of smoke, more like an American Black Ale than a Belgian Dark Ale. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"This is okay to my palate."
"O-easy drinking, but not overly complex or flavorful"

"12 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 3/20/2014. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, pear, apple, anise, pepper, clove, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, brown bread, light coffee, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/roasted malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of raisin, pear, apple, anise, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, brown bread, light coffee, clove, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, pear, apple, anise, chocolate, cocoa, roast, toast, dark bread, light coffee, clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming after the finish. Overall this is a nice and pleasant Belgian dark ale. Good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Pours a dark kola hue with the creamiest four finger head and some bubbly lacing, the smell is pretty boring with aromas of dark malts and a tinge of earthy hops, the mouthfeel is light bodied and over carbonated with the same boring suspects on taste and overall not something id buy again and abit of a let down but sessionable cheers."

"O: An interesting brew, kind of like a combination between a porter and a saison - definitely different than anything else I have come across in the past. I enjoyed this hybrid but can easily see how others might find some dissonance in the combination of flavors/aromas. I enjoyed the complexity and the alcohol is well hidden - not a tough drink but not a beer that I could see myself having more than one of during a session."

"Easy enough to drink, but doesn't really wow me. Sort of a training wheels Black Saison or is it a Porter??"

"Overall: I'm not sure what style this beer is really supposed to be, but it's tasty and drinkable enough. I'd have it again."
"It has a black color with a bubbly tan head that dissipates quickly and leave no real lacing. The smell is chocolate, malt and a bit metallic."
""

"Overall: A pretty interesting and solid tasting brew. More like a Porter than Saison but the Belgian element is noticeable with a nice banana flavor."
""
"Certainly smooth and easy drinking, but perhaps a tad mundane for a Stillwater offering."
"Overall:Had no idea this was a saison cause it does not drink like one. Tastes like a slightly below average roasty black ale. A lighter porter. Not bad, but similar to other beers I have had. I will pass on this in the future."

"Overall this is certainly a decent beer, just maybe a bit thin. Super even....Could use some more excitement somewhere. Very easy to drink. Sessionable but I think I might get bored after a few."
"Pours a very dark brown color capped with a solid head of tan froth. Clean nutty malt aroma along with some fruity yeast...mild and simple. Fruity yeast and nutty malts continue into the flavor adding some very light chocolaty roast and a bit of spice into the mix. Citrus and malted milk balls. Creamy and quite dry, which helps with the drinkability. This is not a Saison and I don't see it marketed as such anywhere, so I'm rating this as an easy-going ""black ale"" with a slight Belgian twist. I don't know...I'm usually impressed with Stillwater, but this comes across as merely okay."
""
"O: This seems like more of an experiment than anything else. Stillwater has done better work. Drinkable, but there are better examples of the style."
""
""
"Not a bad beer at all. My first from Stillwater, and I enjoyed it. $2.49 for a single though? That's a bit much, but this is a very nice and drinkable dark Saison. Pretty tasty."
"O- This is a good beer, but the can is my favorite part. It is easy to drink but I was hoping for something more from Stillwater. Worth trying, but I am going to stick with Classique as my go to low alcohol canned option from Stillwater."
"Overall this seems like the new idea, first was black IPA, then White IPA, now black saison. Not really a great idea, just seems like it should be but isn't. The different characters don't match up, it's all over the place and for that not too enjoyable, and distracting carbonation on top of it all."
"Malt profile here is very nice between the chocolate and toasted nutty flavors. The yeast might dry the beer out just a bit much for me and a slight tartness doesn't mix in amazingly with the grain profile. Solid but Black Farmhouse Ales seem like a very difficult style to pull off."

"Poured into a He'brew small shaker pint. Pours nearly black, opaque in the glass with a half finger light brown head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of toasted malt with light chocolate and saison yeast, light spiciness. Flavor is light toasted malt with a hint of char, hints of coffee and chocolate, initially mellow and well integrated, light hops and char come out more in the finish. Light to medium bodied. A nice light black ale; the saison style yesst gives this a little more spiciness and fruitiness than a classic black ale. The saison influence takes a back seat to the dark malts. Nicely balanced and toasty for a session ale."

"O-pretty solid brew, drinks very similar to a porter. Definitely worth trying"
"Pours black indeed with a 1 inch greyish khaki head that quickly dissipates, looking closely it looks like there is a lot of carbonation in this one. Aromas of slight roasted malts and some kind of yeasty breadiness. Also faint hints of coffee as it warms. The taste is the weak point in the beer sadly, there isn't much that pop out in this beer, it's definitely more of a easy to drink sessionable dark ale than a porter or a black i.p.a. - pretty similar to a black lager, very light bodied mouth feel. I wish there was more flavor to this one! trying to let it warm up a bit to see if that helps like it normally does...nope not really :("
""
"O: Grab a can of this if you see it. Very unique."

"Labeled as a ""smooth black ale", and I was hoping for a darker version of their classique. Unfortunately, that wasn't quite the case. Nothing really stood out about this one. It was light in body, but also in flavor. The mouthfeel was the overall highlight."
