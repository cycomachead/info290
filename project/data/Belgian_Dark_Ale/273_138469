3.6,5.6,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Usually I am not a huge fan of these domestic Belgian types, but this one is pretty good. It's got a lot of grain to it, body and toasted red malts, caramel, nuttiness, but it's not at all sweet, the yeast does a great job of cleaning that up. Fruity from the yeast, but not bubblegum, it's more pears and citrus, which help to lighten it. It's also real well carbonated and refreshing as a result. Definitely a little something different here, not my favorite from these guys, but absolutely better than its ratings on here. Not in love with the yeast strain, but the beer tastes pretty good on the whole.","StonedTrippin","Feb 11, 2015"

But it doesn't taste ""fruity.""  It is unique in that it has the big sweet malty character of a Belgian-style, but somehow at the very same time has a crisp hopiness.  Both are present throughout.  There is a surprise lingering hop character that is a bit like an IPA.  I look forward to trying this a second time.  This could be my new favorite from this brewery.","thehooksman","Jan 14, 2015"

3.9,14.4,,,,,,"The body of the beer was clear, and a shade of orange-brown I can describe as auburn.  The head was relatively modest, estimated at one finger thick.  The aroma displayed the unmistakable spicy sweet signature of Belgian yeast.  This smelled like cherries, white pepper, orange zest, and coriander.  The taste was fruity and spicy with flavors of apple, banana, pear, clove, saffron, naval orange, and some toffee were present.  The finish was very dry and quite floral.  There was a good deal of complexity in the taste, but the body was quite thin, and I wish there was more heft present here.  The aftertaste was spicy but faded quickly.  Easy to enjoy this beer on a winter night, but you are going to need more than one, if you want it to keep you warm at night.","rajendra82","Dec 13, 2014"
