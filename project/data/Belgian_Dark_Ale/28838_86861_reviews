"On draft at Slater's 50/50 in Pasadena.  Really thin and medicinal (it tasted like what a band-aid smells like). Will have to try again some other time and (hopefully) re-score."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, vanilla beans, and cocoa. Taste is much the same with a vanilla flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the vanilla aromas and flavors seem slightly artificial."
