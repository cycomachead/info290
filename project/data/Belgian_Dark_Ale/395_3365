3.38,-5.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"A ""Devilishly Good Belgian Style Ale," bottled Jan 06. Consumed Jan 07. Pours out a hazy brown color with a finger of off-white head to begin. Smells of bread, yeast, with a biting malty note, almost like alcohol. Upon sipping, I find a fresh, somewhat lemony, piney, soapy flavor. A little weird, but not bad. I don't drink Belgians very often, but I'm reminded of the ones I've had before. Not much hoppiness to finish. Somewhat thin in the mouth, but it glides down OK. Soapy here, too.

3.33,-7.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"There's a lot of posatives in this brew, but not accurate for a Dark Belgian. Sweet malt and candy aromas and flavor right up front and decoated with spiciness, hops, and bread. Bright copper-golden color, remarkably clear and vigorously carbonated. Rocky head remained steadfast. Fruity with pears, peaches, apples and berries. Medium weight and smoothness in the mouth, though with prickly carbonation. Alcohols continue to warm throughout the drink--showing a mild plastic-like flavor. The beer, though spiced nicely, never shows that Belgian tartness and earthy character that belgian yeast gives. Still, worth a try.","BEERchitect","Jan 23, 2006"
4.09,13.9,4,5,4,2.5,4,"Flavor is similar to the nose with some light fruit, white grape and pears mixing with caramel. The flavor moves to a slight bitter quality from alcohol not hops.

4.47,24.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hell For Certain reminded me right off the bat of an English style barleywine with its luxurious, fruity, sweet and caramel-soaked maltiness; and full bodied, pillowy mouthfeel. And, in fact, it even looks like one with its hazy, reddish, deep-copper body and frothy tan head. And not to beat a dead horse, but it kind of smells like one too.... there's not much really-specific Belgian yeast character coming through in the nose (it is fruity and floral though, with notes of peach, tangerine, and tropical fruits). More Belgian"" yeast character is present in the flavor, however, with a soft phenolic note and delicate touch of spice that helps dry it out (and overall it's just not as agressive as an English barleywine). The bitterness is balancing and it finishes dry despite the amount of malty sweetness that initially hits the tongue. It's nicely rounded and very drinkable. And somewhere in the aroma, and then again in the flavor, is a thread of orange-like fruitiness (and even some pineapple) that's quite nice and very memorable! There are some low-level leafy hops as well, and they appear almost tea-like once it warms. A unique, satiating, satifying, and thoroughly enjoyable ale that's certainly worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Beers"
3.8,5.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer. A little searching revealed that they use the LaChouffe yeast, no wonder I liked it so much. The pepper finish distracts a bit and takes away from both the fine malts and hops. However, that does a bit to distinguish this from all the other brews out there. If I was ever stuck out in Leslie county coal country, I think Id need several of these daily to drink my cares away.","Dithyramb","0"
3.74,4.2,4.5,3,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours a chestnut color with ruby tones into my tulip glass. A bit cloudy and a half-a-finger of white head that dissipates to a slight surface layer within a minute. Aroma is of lots of fruit (reminds me of strawberry jelly & gummy fruit snacks). Slight yeast aroma sneaks in there as well along with a tiny bit of alcohol-big but not complex. The fruit overpowers much of the aromas. Taste is of cherries and strawberries up front (sweet sugars); leads to a smooth yeasty chocolate malt finish. A bit sweet but enjoyable. Mouthfeel is slight carbonation, mainly smooth, refreshing, and medium-bodied. Not much alcohol burn with this one. Overall, not a bad belgian. It could be a little less sweet or a bit more complex. It actually reminds me of refreshing iced-tea.","Fish113d","Nov 12, 2004"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Its been a while since I sampled this beer last. It pours a very dirty orange/brown color with no real head. The nose is sweet, with notes of brown sugar and raisins coming at me the strongest, withy some spicey tones as well. The flavor is not as strong as I remember it. It is dominated by the spicey tones, but the raisiney notes play hard as well. The feel is every bit of moderate and smooth. Easy drinking and very nice. This could easily be a 4 pack in a night.","kmpitz2","Sep 04, 2004"
3.73,3.9,3.5,3,4,4,4,"I originally assumed this was going to be stronger than it actually is, but once I saw the ABV I realized its just a little stronger than the 'average' brew. The color is a rich amber and the head dissipates rather quickly. The aroma features a slight sniff of munich malt and an ester hint, maybe raisin, and that's about it. Not unpleasant but not terribly strong either. The taste is pretty nice, malty sweet without being cloying, kind of light, with a crisp follow-through and some spiciness (cinnamon, mild fruit cake like flavors) that are pleasant but not really strong. This is a nice beer, not what I was expecting, but more an everyday beer for sure...or for certain. I dont want to call this ""more accessible", because I think its a tasty beer and that moniker makes it seem like a macro, but the brew features interesting flavors that compliment many things without being overpowering.","KroMagnon","Aug 20, 2004"
3.06,-14.8,4,3,3,3,3,"Pours with a one-finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Good carbonation, medium bodied. Nose is a nutty spice. Starts malty with underlying hops, finish has some bitterness with hints of sweetness. $1.99 for a 12oz bottle from Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY .","jdhilt","Jul 22, 2004"
3.72,3.6,3,3.5,4,3,4,"Slightly hazy, bronzy-copper-amber in hue, attractive, there wasnt much of a head that formed. Actually, there wasnt any head, just a small collar, almost naked in the middle. I think the foam is off-white in color; there really isnt much to look at. There was no subsequent lacing. This beer is dull in appearance for a Belgium-style beer. The nose isnt very chatty and it doesnt speak with much of a Belgian accent. Sugary-sweet and alcoholic are the main aromas; behind this are some fruity notes (mainly melons) and a kiss of rinds (from the hops I assume?). At the back is some nondescript maltiness. I cant say the bouquet impresses me much, it is not bad but too close to boring. So, I cant call it inviting. The palate is good; it has a malty-backbone that reminds me of McChouffe. HFC is fruiter though; I like the apple flavors, pears, melons, and juicy tropical fruit. Hmm a Belgium Amber Ale maybe? This beer is plenty sweet, almost too sweet for me. Sugary in the middle, by the finish the beer does dry out just enough to make it quaffable, the hop bitterness is moderate but firm enough for balance by the end. There are enough flavors going on for me to care. However, enough doesnt make this a great beer. It is too clean for one thing. Id drink it again. Once at room temperature I liked it much more, as more layers of flavors could be enjoyed. This is obviously the way to drink this beer, slightly cooler than cellar temperature didnt work out as well. Medium in body, a tickle thin and watery, the carbonation is a bit too low as well. If the carbonation was livelier and the body was bigger this beer would be much better. This is only the truly negative thing I can say about this beer. It is drinkable and likable. It is friendly but not aggressive enough my tastes. But this is yet another solid offering from the BBC, thanks SheepNutz for the sample. Worth a try.","bditty187","Jun 16, 2004"

4.04,12.5,3,4,4,4,4.5,"I don't know where they get calling this a ""Belgian Style Ale"". It's lacking of any Belgian characteristics, and judging by the other reviews here, I think I am drinking a completely different beer! If anything it tastes like an Arrogant Bastard mixed 40/60 with a crummy Leiny Bock and left to stand for 1/2 hour.

3.64,1.4,3,4,3.5,3,4,"The body is a distinctly reddish medium brown body with a buttery head that is small and fades fairly quickly. It's clear and seems like it's probably filtered. The aroma is extremely fruity (honeydew melon and apples, maybe a little grape), honey, a little clove. The flavor is just as nice, but it's so short. You get this big blast of a great flavor (like La Trappe Dubbel without the cloying sweetness), but it doesn't linger. The body is lacking a bit too. I think it's because it's not bottle conditioned. If they'd stick this in a 750 and let it bottle condition to carbonate instead of what their doing, they'd have an excellent beer here.","aracauna","Nov 23, 2003"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Much better than their Dark Star Porter(which is decent). This one pours a clear, copper amber, with a better than expected tan head, that leaves some sheet lacing, eventually fading to collar and slick lace. Not a bad appearance. Aroma is plums and dark cherries, banana bread halved with cinamon raisin bread. Pretty good, so far. Mouthfeel has a hoppy bite, and medium carbonation. Very nice for the style. Taste is much better than expected. Plums and cherries, some McIntosh apples, molasses, and some vanilla flavors. Slight floral hop bitterness keeps the sweet fruit flavors from being cloying. Finishes with a fresh and fruity McIntosh apple taste, with a pleasant dryness. Doesn't taste like a strong, Belgian Ale, at all, but is a very nice ale hat deserves its own niche in the heirarchy of American strong ambers.","merlin48","Nov 07, 2003"
3.65,1.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Bright garnet with a thin layer of bubbles. Lacks substantial head and lace, but attractive,nonetheless. Fresh nose of apricot, yeast, coriander and peppercorn. Ripe fruit, namely apricot, in addition to coriander, pepper and a definite presence of earthy hops make up the flavor profile of this ale. As the beer reaches room temperature, the beer turns fruitier and spicier, creating a two-dimensional flavor with pronounced citrus character. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy, smooth, well-carbonated, and honestly better than expected. A very drinkable Belgian-style ale from Bluegrass in what I'd imagine is to be similar to the Dubbel style. Overall, a tasty beer, though a bit lacking in true Belgian character.","Jon","Oct 21, 2003"
