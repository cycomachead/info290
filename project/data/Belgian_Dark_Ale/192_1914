3.64,-5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,"A good beer reminiscent of the olden dark-ale days, 1554 will make any night into a classic. Not too strong in terms of ABV, you could drink 1554 through a night, guilt-free. This Belgian style dark ale provides a classic European taste with fine malt and a toned-down presence of hops. Creamy, smooth, and more dulled than its hoppy neighbours, 1554 is the social drinker's answer to one well planned night. Bringing in the expert craft of New Belgian brewers, this beer offers a night full of relaxation and comfort with its earthier tones and inviting warmth, and is well worth the adventure.","Jasonm2","Mar 04, 2015"

The smell is the worst part of this beer with a weak wheat and caramel smell. The taste and the mouthfeel are incredible though with a very smooth finish. Highly recommend, especially in the winter.","ANiklaus","Jul 31, 2014"

3.68,-3.9,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"1554 is an eye-opening beer. The combination of toasted, nutty malts and sweet, chalky yeast characteristics make for an interesting pairing. It may be hard to convince some that the flavor mesh is worth tracking down a bottle. Still, this is a well crafted beer that I would certainly have again on a cold winter night.","Pintofbrown","Dec 29, 2013"

The aroma is of roasted malts, chocolate and dark fruit. The taste is about the same with a slight dry smokey finish. No harsh or bitter aftertaste. This is my favorite brew from this company by far.

It's still a beer I'd revisit from NB whenever possible, but my palate's definitely changed over time towards it. Still, at the low ABV, I can't complain, and it still does the trick even now. For people who wanted to see better malt-focused beers from NB, give this a whirl.","magictacosinus","Aug 13, 2013"

Some light is visible at the bottom of the glass and it is ruby copper in color. I can also make out some rising tiny bubbles in the beer. The beer smells of bready malt, toffee, and dark chocolate. There's also a touch of earthiness in the aroma. The beer is nice and chocolately with some mild toffee to add some sweetness. I also get some of that malt breadiness and some earthiness. There's some roastiness as well some lingering back end bitterness. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is creamy. This is a very good beer. It would pair nicely with a good meal or work as an after dinner drink.","acevenom","Jul 07, 2013"

It's very smooth and I get no objectionable aftertaste, just a pleasant reminder of its flavors. I may be a noob and beer sissy, but 1554 just plain works for me. I usually drink it right out of the bottle, but I have obtained some pint glasses of late and it seems to bring out more flavor.","oak1971","Jun 08, 2013"

When you smell it, the sweet caramel / chocolate aroma hits hard, giving you a good sign of what you're in for - the head on this stuff is gorgeous, although not the world's thickest. It's a true beauty to look at once you've poured it into a glass. I'm really glad to see so many positive reviews on this beer, because in all honesty, it's my new favorite.

Tastes are roasted, slight floral and slight cooked vegetable to me, and a little nutty. Enjoyable. Mouthfeel is a little pungent and the body a bit flat. It's possible I drank this a little too warm but I don't think so. This beer does take on a strange aroma once at the end, or room temp. Like an average dinner cooking, strange.

The smell is lighter than a porter and the taste and mouthfeel is also lighter. If you read my reviews, I like dark beers, and this is a dark beer that I enjoying drinking regularly. I keep these in my refrigerator at all times. Even a new craft beer drinker will enjoy experiencing one of these as a lead-in to porters and then stouts.","rramsey","Sep 30, 2012"

4.41,15.1,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O - A subtle nod to Belgian yeast throughout the beer is a brilliant touch to differentiate this dark ale from either a stout or porter, something that carefully pushes boundaries. The real shining point, though, is the balance of malt, suggesting some of the darker qualities without being aggressive or overpowering, leaving 1554 a quite drinkable dark beer!","BeerFMAndy","Jul 31, 2012"
3.85,0.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a dark, rich red brown with a thin head that leaves light lacing. Malty, dark fruit aroma. Tastes malty and nutty with dark fruit, some roasted malt. This is much closer to a brown ale that leans towards a Porter. Medium bodied. There is no Belgian character that I can detect. Worth revisiting as a brown ale.","LiquidAmber","Jul 31, 2012"

There's some story on the bottle about the ""intrepid researchers"" of the brewery finding a recipe in Belgium from the year 1554 for this beer and how this beer is different than modern beers. Well, if that is true, perhaps history was trying to teach us something and there's a reason this poorly evolved ancestor of modern beers is extinct.","BeerDocT","Jul 28, 2012"

It had a 3/4"" head which it sustained for about ten minutes. The smell was earthy and sweet. The mouthfeel was nice. It had a heavy feel but really smooth, like silk. The taste was earthy and fruity with a hint of something sweet, perhaps chocolate. As with most of New Belgium beers, I give 1554 two-thumbs-up!!","klmcmachen","Jul 17, 2012"

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Not my favorite style (I prefer my Belgian darks to be strong), but this is nothing short of quality. It doesn't surprise me with New Belgium. I don't care for the blatant American twist on a Belgian style in the way that many craft brewers do tripels or pales. This is legit. Maybe a relief as most Belgian darks from the home country are swimming in yeast esters. This ale is complex enough to make you stop and muster up what you can in between sips, yet drinkable enough to forget that you're writing a beer review. I support you drinking this beer. 4.0","thecheapies","Apr 19, 2012"

3.86,0.8,4,3,4,5,4,"1554 pours a very dark brown-ruby color with minimal lacing. Wispy bubbles in the center of my pour suggest moderate carbonation. There is a subtle, sweet, chocolate scent to this ale. Taste-wise, chocolate and dark malts are present as well as a breadiness with coffee coming through at the end. Hops are playing their part more passively. I respect the velvet smooth mouthfeel and this is not heavy for a dark ale; only 5.6 %. An enjoyable dark ale, smooth and even somewhat sessionable due to the lower weight for the style. A dank New Belgium treat for me here in PA. Looking forward to east coast distribution.","mindlucent2007","Apr 18, 2012"

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I liked this beer and I thought that it was a slightly above average example of a Belgian Dark Ale, but I don't have much experience with this style so take it for what it's worth. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth, wasn't filling, and it had enough flavor to hold my attention, I could drink a couple of these in a row without a problem. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, I thought everything was on par for the style. What I liked least about this beer was the slightly higher amount of sweetness in the flavor, if it was toned down a little the flavor would be pretty damn good. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style but since I can't buy it in Michigan I doubt I will be having it again anytime soon. I recommend giving this beer a try, I think it would make a nice introduction to the style. This was a pretty solid Belgian Dark Ale from a pretty solid brewery, good job guys, keep making good beers and I'll keep seeking them out. A solid Belgian Dark Ale, but Brewery Vivant's Solitude is still my favorite Belgian Dark Ale.","StoutHunter","Apr 13, 2012"

The aroma is a little weaker than the taste but still exhibits nicely chocolatey malt character. The mouthfeel is likewise well done, with a medium body that's moderately and smoothly carbonated. Not exactly Belgian in feel, aside from the drying finish but that doesn't hurt the beer much if at all in my opinion. Nice, unusual session candidate from New Belgium.","tobelerone","Apr 07, 2012"

The taste was sweet with the malt that faded to an almost powdered cocoa note. The mouth feel was medium and clung to the palate, but lacked major carbonation on the tongue.

Aromas of big caramel, toasted malt, chocolate, light coffee, spicy hops, and light biscuit. Some nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toasted malt, light chocolate, spicy hops, and malty sweetness. No bitterness; with lingering notes of light chocolate, caramel, and toasted malts on the finish for a bit. Finish is a lot drier than I was expecting it to be, and the flavors aren’t very robust. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming after the finish. This is extremely drinkable. Overall a nice beer, but pretty lack luster in my opinion. When I read it was a black ale, I was expecting a much more robust flavor and body.","superspak","Dec 26, 2011"

Very little light getting through, but appears to be quite clear and free of haze. The nose is very faint, but primarily offers toast and a touch of pine. The flavor is mild, malty, complex, and quite sweet. It's very reminiscent of a Scottish Ale. There are some flavors of toasted malt, caramel, and pancakes and the hops are only strong enough to balance things out just a tad. Mouthfeel is decent, but perhaps just a bit thin with all that malt present. Overall, this is a nice-tasting, easy drinking beer.

Sticky random lacing. The smell is at first a bit boozy? but otherwise hints of bitter chocolates and raisins are present. The beer tastes of raisins, dark chocolate, banana peels over a roasted malt presence. An average mouthfeel, maybe a tad carbonated. Overall this would make a good dessert beer. But, it feels much heavier than 5.6% ABV. It's got a lot of complex flavors to mill over as you slowly enjoy this.

Downed the entire 22 oz myself (and that says a lot). Deep rich brown/mahogany in the glass with a creamy rich tan head that fell but maintained a presence (nicely lacing the glass) all the way down. Flavor was a touch sweet buttery malt, a touch roasted chocolate and a touch of bitterness--all in perfect balance.

Stateside, to recreate the Belgian experience, the New Belgium Abbey Ale comes close. The New Belgium 1554 is a different animal. It has the prerequisite off white head, fabulous aroma and deep black color. I actually like the 1554 a bit better in the flavor department. It’s not quite so honey sweet, has good complexity and even a touch of bitter. You may not like it better than your favorite Belgian dark ale, but it is unique enough to mix it into the rotation for some variety.","iSip","Aug 09, 2011"

No thanks to BA and my developing palate. These days I find it too sweet for my taste and not refined or complex enough for my liking. I wouldn't turn one down if someone offered me one. But would like to try this on tap if I could find it. 1554 is not bad but not great. It's a good all around sturdy brew for beginning dark beer drinkers. If this beer where around in 1554 I think it would of blown the burlap sacks off people. Today, though not so much as too flutter an occasional dress.

While the recipe might be from 1554, the brewing practices of the day would probably have produced a beer with a little more interesting yeast character (take this for what you will). In this context, I think it is somewhat of a dissappointment for authenticity's sake. However, it is a tasty sessionable beer akin to a slightly estery schwarzbier. I do know that this is a big 'gateway' beer for some and that's not a bad thing.

It smells of lightly roasted dark malts with a light slightly bitter chocolate aroma. I don't get where people are saying that they get any yeast from this. I think this smells more like a porter. The flavors are of slight dark chocolate with a light roastiness and a creamy finish. It has the mouthfeel of french press coffee and cream. It's very flavorful but again, I say this tastes more like a porter. I poured this aggressively so it initially had a pretty large head. I think this sucked some of the carbonation out of it but it made the beer very creamy and soft and exceptionally smooth. Overall I like this beer. Is it a good interpretation of the style?

Half way through I had a buckeye (chocolate and peanut butter candy), which was a nice compliment. It poured black with one finger of head. It smelled and tasted like chocolate, coffee, caramel and smoke. It was a little sweeter than I typically prefer, so I don't know if I would drink more than one of these in a row.

Dark fruit and dark chocolate make a beautiful combination (though it's mostly the former and just a hint of the latter. The roasted character is just barely present, and adds something to the beer, and I'm glad that they managed to keep any coffee notes from creeping in. Strike that, as some coffee starts to come through a little bit once the beer warms. Body is impressively rich for a beer of just 5.6%, but the carbonation is a bit lacking.

The only flavor that combats the malt is the interesting yeast flavors of the beer. Moderate carbonation with a dry nutty finish.

The aromatics were very woodsy with a hint of chocolate undertone. The first sip (the beer came straight out of the fridge and it was approximately 38*) was very nutty with a chocolate underlay. As the beer warmed up (it was approximately 50* when I finished) the chocolate underlay became more prevalent. New Belgium recommended that the beer be served at 45* in a snifner style beer glass. I can definately understand why. The temperature and the difference in glass ware will make a huge aromatic and taste difference.","TGates13","Jul 31, 2010"

Quite bready, the combination of spice and cocoa makes me think of pumpernickel bread (the American variant). Lightly fruity as well.

The flavor is dominated by the malt and yeast with with almost no hop presence as others have stated.

A nice bitterness from the roast flavors couple with a mild hop quality. It coats the mouth in a satisfactory way. A bit sticky and cloying on the finish but not horrible and something that could certainly be fixed with a decent food pairing. Of the NB beers I've had so far (Mothership Wit and Fat Tire being the other two) this one is certainly the better of the three in my opinion and the one I'm drinking has actually reached it's drink by date so I'm guessing it's even better when fresh, at least I hope so.

Sure, there is enough roasty malt and coffee to keep me interested, but quite honestly, I was expecting something a bit more out-of-the-ordinary. This is, most unfortunately, quite ordinary.

All tastes were mild and not overpowering. I think it was pretty well balanced. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was right. This Ale reminded me more of a Porter. That wasnt a bad thing.

The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like green apple, bready malt, smoke, earth, yeast, coffee, chocolate, dark fruit and a bit of spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with good but smooth carbonation. Also feels a bit creamy and coating. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. Not a bad choice as a session beer either.

There was a lovely woodiness present here which to me, tasted like freshly sawn, damp timber smells, along with some modest malt flavours. Mouthfeel was okay, I suppose, in regards to weight and carbonation; again, nothing really impressive. Overall, not a terrible concoction, and certainly several notches above Fat Tire. As always, glad I had the opportunity to have a go at this one.","SilentSabre","Mar 28, 2009"

I had this beer at a number of different places on a trip to Colorado and sometimes it came in a pint and looked pretty much like an American porter. The best way to describe this beer is the word ""nice"". It's just a nice beer. It's got a nice soft feel to it, a nice creamy-ness, and a nice but not too sweet dry chocolatey-ness to it. Not like a chocolate added type of beer, but a nice strong sense of chocolate coming through in the malt backdrop. Real smooth and pleasant and again, just nice to drink.","twelvsies","Mar 16, 2009"

The flavor, like the smell, is a balance of chocolate and lightly burned malts with mellow sweet fruits like berries and cherries.

3.78,-1.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Nice to find this beer as I always enjoy New Belgium's more esoteric offerings. Pours dark brown with a malty, treacly nose. This a very tasty black lager that offers notes of toffee and caramel. Carbonation is downplayed a bit which IMHO makes it even more drinkable. Pairs well with a lot of food and is great for Winter evenings. Nice to see a well made US example of the style.","canucklehead","Nov 06, 2008"
4,4.4,4,4,4,5,3.5,"Very nice dark color with good persistent head that makes a great lacing. Coffee aroma on the nose, leading into a sweet roasted malt on the palate, and softly hopped on the finish with no appreciable aftertaste. The best thing about this brew is the mouthfeel, which is thick and expands as it moves across the tongue to the back of the mouth. Modestly drinkable, but with this great thick mouthfeel, it's one to be savored slowly.","jushoppy2beer","Nov 05, 2008"

The roasted malt is the dominant taste, touches of chocolate and lingering taste of alcohol. There is enough carbonation to make a good beer burp, but not enough that you would blow down the neighbor's tool shed.

Dry attractive spices like paprika, cinnamon, and toasted rye are up front. The body yield biscuity malt that is even and nicely rich. Complex and super well balanced.

Relatively decent head, but it settles pretty quickly. Nice aromas. This is an unusual style, and I believe I've only had one other- Rare Vos. There is a nuttiness in the aroma, almost like wild rice, as well as a chalky smell. This is followed by cocoa notes and a touch of black pepper and a deep roastiness. The taste is similar, with some very dry malt up front, followed by an earthy bitterness, a dry nuttiness, and a chalky cocoa taste at the finish. A deep roastiness is throughout, and everything is well integrated. The mouthfeel is a bit prickly, even spicy, and bone dry. There is a nice lingering bitterness, but none of that sourness you sometimes get from deeply roasted grains. The whole package is quite intriguing. Some of the chocolate tastes in the beer dry out and become more bitter and dry as you keep drinking. Really a marvel- very different than almost anything else out there. I like it both for its unusual nature and for its simple directness.","Georgiabeer","Aug 06, 2008"

A big frothy beige head ensues after a vigorous pour and dark beige lacing is left on the glass after the beer recedes. The aroma is bitter chocolate and just a hint of java and cream. The taste is a blast of dark chocolate and espresso beans. The mouthfeel is full and crisp, with a drying finish. Makes the mouth beg for more.

Smells like a malty chocolate ice cream float with a mild nutty roasted character. The mouth feel is medium bodied with a significant tingle of hopped effervescence. The taste follows close to the nose. A semi-sweet nutty chocolate with a maltiness that lingers nicely. An easy drinker, so far my favorite New Belgium product.","jjayjaye","May 13, 2008"
3.91,2.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Another great beer from New Belgium. I poured from a bottle into a glass. The beer had a good 3 finger foam that quickly collapsed into a creamy froth and gradually fell down to a thin line. The color was a clear, reddish, coffee color. The beer had a malty, roasted smell with traces of bitter chocolate and coffee. It also had a rich, malty taste with a hint of espresso and finished with a mild hoppiness that was clean and refreshing. The mouthfeel was creamy and rich. A very drinkable beer that I will definitely buy again....but then, I am partial New Belgium's products.","AZTEX","May 12, 2008"
3.68,-3.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is one of my favorites from New Belgium. A good black colored beer with a thick tan head. A very roasty nose with lots of black and chocolate malts. Some fruity hops as well. The taste is similar with a big dark malt profile. Faint hops keep the barley from dominating. Crisp medium body aids in the drinkablity. I'm not sure if its a true Belgian dark, but it is quite good.","rye726","May 07, 2008"

The head was off-white and thick, and dissipated fairly quickly. I wasn't too impressed with the aroma, sweet chocolate, not much else. The taste, though, made up for the relatively mild aroma. Fruit, chocolate, a little coffee and roasted malt. Easy drinking, and at 5.5% ABV, one could put a few of these away.","lordofthewiens","Apr 29, 2008"
4.22,10.2,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured into Chimay glass. Not quite black but dark brown, with a creamy but short lived tan head. Very light lacework. Aroma is a blast of fruit and chocolate, plus coffee and nearly burnt toast, lightly buttered. Taste is a delicious blend of chocolate, coffee, toasted grains...sweet with a very light bitterness, just enough to balance it out. Nice, easy mouthful, medium to light bodied with smooth carbonation. In my opinion this beer is as good or better than a lot of pricier ones out there.","Rzzzzz","Apr 28, 2008"

A fairly unique nose out of a blend of seemingly common scents. Taste is very smooth, creamy, rich, dark, and roasty. Very nice taste overall. There is just a touch of bitterness, and I actually wouldn't mind a bit more, which is something I've never said about a dark beer before.

Aromas begin with a mild roast character woven around caramel, toffee, and lactose sweetness. Mild tartness, earthy / peaty, nutty notes round out the scent. The beer looks dark brown with a mild murky look, well headed, and overall rich looking. Tastes are big on the caramel / toffee / praline sweetness, but the added complexity of berries, chocolate, wood, and must make the beer decidedly better. The mouthfeel seems full because of the varying flavors and creamy carbonation, but the beer finishes quite light and drinkable.

Malty aroma with a little roast barley and Belgian yeast notes in it. Just a hint of malt sweetness in the flavor, perfectly offsetting the draw between hops and roast grain bitterness. A slight prickly sourness from the carbonation playing at the sides of the tongue that helps keep this a mild and refreshing quaff. If it weren't for a kgrtr full of other interesting bottles to try and four kegs of homebrew, I'd be disappointed I had only one bottle of this.

Mouthfeel is a smooth creamy medium body with just the right amount of carbonation. I really didn't think I'd like this beer, but I was quite surprised.

Taste is soft and nice, like licorice with the roasty backround that's easy to drink. Mouthfeel is very nice, very smooth and enjoyable.

Aromas were of hearty roasted malts, a hint of hps and a yeasty sour note. The flavor was slightly smokey like beechwood, very earthy and it intesifies the roasted malts. Alcohol is there but very slight, and the sweetness of the malts hides it well. Finish is slightly bitter, and clean, probably not even from the hops, but the combination of malty goodness. I wouldnt have guessed it be of belgian origin, but nonetheless its a good historic brew.","kernalklink","Aug 18, 2007"

This was my first black ale, and it tasted very much like a lighter bodied smoked porter. The label said something about a chocolaty flavor, but I was getting more of a smoky flavor than anything.

Palate is mostly dark malt up front, with a bit of sweetness.

The taste starts out just like a mexican malt beverage, with not a hint of alcohol and a syrup-like finish. The toasted malts and grains are very apparent in the second taste, and it comes across much like a stout with a light body. There is also a nutty presence that comes from the specialty grains and serves as a wonderful finish to the taste. A good beer, although nothing that you should go out of your way to find.","Toddv29424","Nov 25, 2006"

Robust carbonation, but not overly sharp carbonation. The finish is a touch on the sour side, almost like a Flemish brown.

The flavor imparted by a little yeast would have added a bit of complexity that was lacking for a beer of reputed Belgian origin. I doubt they had filtration back then and the beer would have been cask conditioned. The beer was good, and was quite drinkable even on a very hot sultry Houston Sunday sitting outside. The head retention was in the average range. All in all it was a good but not exceptional beer. Anyone expecting something like a belgian ale would be disappointed.

It maintained its slightly brown frothy head rather well. It smells very heavy, very much like a strong cup of coffee with just a tinge of alcohol and maybe just a little cocoa, but when the head died down it very nearly smelled like a good cigar. No real heavy hoppy smell like with most beer. The very first thing that came to mind when I drank it was the nearly overpowering coffee taste, it was good, but I didnt really like it. Then on my second drink I noticed a very slight tobacco taste, not disgusting, actually quite suprising, then I noticed a very very slight chocolate taste, just underneath the tobacco. It honestly is one of the smoothest beers I've ever tasted, its almost like velvet on my throat. One very interesting thing to note is when I smoke a pipe while drinking this beer; it brings the chocolate taste right to the front, even above the coffee, creating an extremely satisfying beer experience.","mendozozoza","Aug 14, 2006"

(granted the only reason I think that is cause I read the label I'm sure) The taste was the same. it was a bit too rich and smokey for me I fear, but if that is your thing I would say get this beer.

Flavor imparts a subtle spiciness, from the yeast I presume, but mellows and becomes sweeter with notes of nuts, coffee and dry, grainy wheat. Toasted almond aftertaste lingers on the tongue with just enough balance from the hop bitterness as well. Certainly is not lacking in carbonation - a bit fizzy.

Aroma is roasty malts, with notes of chicory nuttiness and a prominent Munich malty character. Mouthfeel is light medium bodied. Taste is dominated by roasty dark malts, with notes of scorched coffee, bitter chocolate, and soy sauce. Hops and yeast contribute an understated earthiness. A hint of black cherries adds a welcome fruitiness. This is a dark ale that defines its own style. Tastes more like a Schwartzbier than a Belgian Dark Ale. Very well crafted and a pleasant sipper.

I was shocked to find the beer only medium-bodied on first sip, surely I was expecting much thicker. Some toasty malt and touches of spicy hop bitterness exist. Overall, there is more of a caramel aspect than a chocolate one in my opinion. The aftertaste is somewhat bitter with a more roasted chocolate taste than the body.

No real hop note in the aroma. The flavor comes across with the same mixture of caramel and roast malt. There is a mild nuttiness to the flavor and just a hint of citrus hop on the finish.

The flavor is exactly as the nose suggests with the addition of some rich caramel notes and a very delicate touch of grassy hops in the background. It's just slightly spicy, and a touch acidic from the dark malts; and these combine with its sublime bitterness to balance it very nicely.

Head size is about average. The aroma isn't very strong and consists mainly of light malt smells. 1554 is primarily a malty beer, hops provide only a balance.

There was a light, lingering malty taste. This was a decent beer and was very easy to drink.","UncleJimbo","May 23, 2004"

The dominant aroma is of toasted malt, it is joined by perhaps a hint of caramel sweetness, and lots of biscuit type aromatics. This beer has quite a smooth body that goes down quite well. It is lightly sweet. The finish laden with notes of toasted malt, that is not quite approaching a roast character. This beer is quite malty overall, though it is balanced by a dark fruitiness that reminds me of cherries, raisins, and perhaps a bit of fig.. This beer could definitely use a bit more Belgian yeast character, but that is perhaps a wee bit of a shallow complaint, as this is a great session beer as is.","Gueuzedude","Apr 20, 2004"

It had a rather sweet smelling aroma, and initially, I really didn't get much flavor from this beer. It was served rather cold, and just seemed very average. The color was a semi-dark brown, and clear. As I always try to do, I let it warm up. BOY was that a GREAT thing to do. Please do yourself a favor and let it warm up. Some wonderful freshly roasted barley flavors came out and it became really quite interesting and tasty. It really almost tasted like food, and in this case, that was a good thing.

Although the head disappears, there is very nice wispy rings of lace left behind. Toasty malt aroma with dark fruit and a hint of chocolate. Nothing grabs the front seat, but the flavor is a harmonious blend of roasted grain, chocolate,brown sugar, coffee, and vanilla. A mild hop bitterness keeps the sweetness in check.

Taste is favorably mild with a great dryish mixture of black malts and chocolate with just a hint of dried floral spices and yeast. Just barely sweet within and has a bit of roastyness to it but its very tame, leaving a nice rounded character to flourish in texture and body, which is medium to full and the smooth carbonation helps this slide right down with amazing ease.

The flavor is full, crisp and malty, with the roastiness that goes along with porters but mellowed and more buttery. Mouthfeel thinnish, kind of like black coffee.

Toasted and bread-like malt characters rule the palate as well, but with more citrus hop presence that shows up in the middle.  Adds a nice little acidic twang.  Underneath all of this, a bit of spicy hop flavor.  A medium body and very creamy mouthfeel make it quite drinkable, but it's still nice and complex.  Very tasty.  This is an interpretation of an interesting Belgian style similar to a schwarzbier, which, according to the bottle, New Belgium's researchers discovered in an ""ancient brewing book"".

Quite similar in aroma profile to a real Schwarz, but there's much more fruitiness from the yeast.  Apparently a lager strain is fermented warm.  A steam Schwarz?  Smooth mouthfeel with a light to medium body.  It definitely seems alelike and lacks the crispness that a true lager possesses.  The malt flavor is dominated by smooth, tasty and toasty Munich malt, and some residual sweetness, yet manages to remain light enough to keep this brew quite drinkable.  The hop bitterness is very mild, but prevents this beer from being overly sweet.  Hop flavor is negligible. The color of 1554 is deceiving, considering roasted malt flavors are secondary to the toasty Munich notes.  1554 is certainly an interesting and drinkable brew... don't know what exactly to make from it.  I don't think I would classify it as a Schwarzbier, however.","marc77","Apr 03, 2002"
