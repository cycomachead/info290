3.88,7.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"O= A surprisingly quality beer. I wasn't expecting much and have sort of been putting off trying it because it didn't sound great. I bought it because it was local and I will buy it again because it's good. Let this baby warm up a little for full enjoyment.","jjanega08","Mar 03, 2012"

It was very drinkable but lacked carbonation and didn't have a very strong bouquet. Would drink again, but probably won't seek out.","syrupjoe","Feb 28, 2012"
3.92,8.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I like this one quite a bit, although it doesn't go as far as I'd like with flavor, for the price. Nonetheless, one of the best efforts from Lift Bridge.","feloniousmonk","Feb 28, 2012"

3.04,-15.6,3,4,3,3,2,"This is like a Welch's Juice Concoction gone wrong. Not bad by any means, but more of a beer with too much going on in the bottle & nothing to bring it all together. Mediocre, odd, & not terribly satisfying.","maximum12","Jan 19, 2012"
3.7,2.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Big thanks goes out to MBrausen for sending me this one for the sole purpose of being able to tick it! Served from bottle into a Duvel Meyers tulip. Poured a deep yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, clove, bread, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, clove, bread, fruit, subtle dark fruit, and very subtle alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. The aroma on this one really reminded me of a nice Belgian Pale Ale with a touch of alcohol. I really wish it would have been a little more complex than it was to keep the nose wondering what it was up to. The flavor however made up for this as it was quite nice and balanced and smooth. This fact made this brew quite easy to drink and enjoyable. Worthy of trying if you get the chance or just want to tick it.","thagr81us","Jan 16, 2012"
3.38,-6.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall: Drink this one served barely chilled or at room temps to get the most from the unique flavors. It's a decent and unique beer, but probably something I wouldn't seek out again. I'd drink it with no problem if someone offered one...after letting it warm up quite a bit first.","ChopperSmith","Jan 15, 2012"

3.35,-6.9,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O - My experiences with Lift Bridge brews have been hit and miss. I love the Saison but was not impressed with the Crosscut Ale. The Biscotti falls more towards the Crosscut - not a bad beer but not something I need to have again.","ballenc","Jan 08, 2012"

Overall not a beer I would suggest or buy again. I think they did well with their spices in the Commander. I think they tried and hoped to repeat the awesomeness that was the commander with different spices. Really just didn't work. However GLAD I have a commander downstairs. Good brewery in it's infancy I think.","Crass3000","Dec 18, 2011"
3.4,-5.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"I actually don't think this drinks that well. Really dry and the flavor is kind of one dimensional and boring to me. I had higher hopes especially after The Commander, but this just is not worth the $10/bottle price tag at all. Not a bad beer, just didn't do anything for me really.","jera1350","Dec 12, 2011"
1.98,-45,3.5,3,1.5,1.5,1.5,"I was being kind and finished my 3oz pour at the party. Anywhere else that would have been a drain pour. Hopefully that was a fluke. I had it on tap once before and it was much better that time.","TheDudeRules","Beers"

Had a spicy and malty aroma with a taste that pretty much fit the aroma add vanilla. The mouthfeel was medium and smooth which eluded to a high drinkability factor. Another great introductory offering from Lift Bridge. And although it doesn't taste as much like biscotti as I had hoped, it's still good enough to just keep on drinking.","deliriumfest","Beers"
