3.99,4.2,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a 22oz bomber.  Dark chocolate almost black.  Aromas of dark fruit like dates with a hint of coffee.   Light and slightly creamy.  Definitely taste fruit and coffee.  Only moderately sweet.  Hidden roasted malts.  Very drinkable and smooth.  Close to a stout. Good year around but think it will do better in the winter.","uvachief","Dec 26, 2014"

Short aftertaste. The body is thinner than I would like and the high carbonation exacerbates this.","smcolw","Mar 30, 2014"
