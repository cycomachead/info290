"Final Grade: 4.15, an A-. I am really enjoying my glass of Augustijn Brune, as it hits pretty much all of the major notes that I expect from this style, in addition to tasting quite excellent. Rich tasting and full-bodied; an excellent inclusion in this Van Steenberge sampler. A very good quality ale, though not quite on the same level as some of the better Belgian-style dark ales I've had over the years. Still, that's impressive company, indeed."

"A nice beer, but no real wow here. This was part of a mixed 6 pack of Belgian ales and to this point this is perhaps the one I am least enthused about. I am holding out hope for the last two."

"Overall - Really nice. Pleasantly surprised after being let down a little bit by the blonde. Because of the sweetness and use of cherries and chocolates was reminiscent of a cross between a Belgian Dark Ale and a Dubbel. Very fine stuff indeed."

"I'm surprised with how much I liked this, but suffice to say the flavor does not match the complexity of the aroma at all, and the caramel/apple/clove combo becomes a bit too one-dimension in the long run. Nevertheless, this is a solid offering from a brewery that seems to throw me back and forth, and I wouldn't mind experimenting with aging a few more of their dark beers (which I am, such as Gulden Draak). Recommended."

"O: Excellent but short of world class."

"O: nothing I would club baby seals to find again. Glad I tried it, but it was not amazing."

"Would I buy this beer again? Probably not, but maybe..."
"D: A nice drinking brew. Solid for style."

"Overall - Nice, well-rounded Belgian dark. Sweet, but not overtly so, allowing for a nice, drinkable and approachable brew. I could definitely stand to drink another one."
""
"Overall: Another hit from this brewery. the Belgians know what they are doing. I can see pairing this with cured meats, heavy cheeses, pears, and blackberries. A lovely thing."
"O: Excellent Belgian dark ale."

"Listed on label as 8% ABV from a 11.2 fl.oz. bottle. Pours golden color with a small head. Aroma is sweet-sour indicative of a Belgian yeast, with after taste of fruit and toffee notes. Lots of carbonation, a spicy taste complemented by a sweet bitter finish."
""
"O - I freaking loved this, and this is the best example of an under-rated style that I have sampled. Personally, I appriciated the lack of overpowering ""barnyard"" funk common to many a Belgian. It's there, but it doesnt dominate. Balanced. Superb. Rebuy!"
"Served in my DFH chalice. Pours with a four inch, rocky, cream-colored head pockmarked with tiny craters across the surface. Head eventually settles into a quarter inch, creamy cap. The brew itself is a brownish-mahogany hue with a slight haziness. Nose expresses dull prune notes and a slight yeastiness. Taste consistent with nose; however, flavors are a bit muted but a slightly vinous character is revealed towards the back. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and a slight acidity. Overall, a decent BSDA, but not much complexity. There are definitely better examples of the style out there."

"The taste begins sweet and malty with a kind of peppery low to moderate bitterness hanging on at the end but not for long. Likable all around."
"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a goblet, no bottle date, but I bought these in November. This pours a fizzy, lightly cloudy brown color with a decent off white / tan color which has good retention and leaves a lacing. The smells are of dark fruit and candied sugar, minimal hop presence. The feel is medium with high carbonination. The taste is quite good, you get the sweet candied sugar and loads of malts but this is a very dry beer which makes an interesting combination."

"O – Overall this beer is just somewhat lacking. Appearance is awesome. Smell is good. Taste is bland. I hate to say it but I probably wouldn’t buy this beer again. Would definitely drink it if offered to me though. Not bad. Just not good."
""
""
""
""
"O: I find this beer enjoyable and dismissible at the same time. Or shall I say ""neither neither here nor there."""

"A pretty decent taste, good within itself with roasted malt taste that differ from there american counterparts, worth a try, for sure."
"Solid brown ale, but doesn't really stand out."
""
"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruits, brown sugar, and some mild spice aromas. Taste is of malt, dark fruit, and brown sugar. There is a slight spice flavor on the finish as well. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"Pretty average, but fairly easy to drink."
"Overall, I'm happy with this beer. Although it isn't one of their best, it would be the best beer for a lot of breweries."
"O- This is a nice beer. nothing wrong with it and I hope to have it again in the future."
"Overall, I don't recomend very much this beer. This brewery a lot more to offer in the rest of their beers."
"Overall this is a decent Belgian dark ale with a nice drinkability."
"Augustijn Donker leaves much to be desired. It ranks so low down the Belgian Dark Ale totem-pole that it really doesn't even warrant mention. This was not my first time trying it, but it likely will have been my last (none in the Augustijn series impressed me). However reasonable the price, I guarantee you Belgium offers better brands at the similar cost."

"beautiful ruby red, also picked from the sampler pack. usually the samplers arent all that great, but these have all been firsts for me (except for the Gulden Draak) and i was wary from the beginning. nice looking head which diminished quickly with lacing. fine bubbles of carbonation. BA has this listed as a 7% but the bottle says 8%. previous reviewer hit it on the head ""strong Newcastle with belgian yeast"". so happy with the the sampler pack i went back and bought another one for a friend. except now i'm drinking it."

"Overall this is a solid Belgian Dark. Clean and drinkable. Well crafted malt profile, but not super complex. Recommended to any fan of Belgian ales, or fans of bocks and brown ales that want to try something different. Cheers!"

"Overall: Having this after a long day of work, makes me appreciate a descent beer. It is not going to blow you out the water but I think in the end you will like it's quality. Salud!"
"Overall: Solidly above average Belgian Dark Ale. It has more character than, say, Leffe Brune, but lacks that beer's reasonably strong leather and clove type flavors/aromas. I generally prefer that end of the BDA / BSDA spectrum to sweet fruit bombs like this one, but this beer is bold and well-put together enough to be enjoyable regardless."
""
""
"Overall a very nice beer."
""
""
""
"Not bad. Has an easy-going, well-rounded character that goes down nicely. Lacks depth; perhaps a little sweet with an excessively boozy finish, but no major complaints. Nothing special, but worth trying."
"Poured with little head. Beautiful amber ruby color. Scents of alcohol, yeast and over ripe grapes & cherries. Tastes like dark malts raisins & brown sugar. Thin mouth feel water like. Overall not a bad beer its like a session beer in the Chimay style."
"D: Not quite what I was expecting as a brune, but enjoyable with the sour taste. Not something I would seek out but not a bad deal if it's included in a mixed Augustijn 6-pack."
""

"Clear brown, thin ecru head of tiny bubbles. Caramel, treacle, and coffee dregs. The finish is slightly balanced toward a subtle brown sugar sweetness as opposed to the light earthy bitterness that hangs on at the finish. A lower level of carbonation compared to the Augustijn Blonde helps showcase the maltiness."
"Very nice looking beer with a rich oft-white colored head and extreme lacing down the beer. Pours an outstanding dark bold color. Scents of cherries, apricots, cranberry, and belgian yeast and sugar. Tastes like tart cherries and candied sugar. Beer gets better as it warms. Medium bodied, but yet very light in the fold. It will be revisited!"
""
"Overall, a decent beer but not a great example of the style. A little thin in all respects, though not unpleasant in any way."
"Overall, above average. Seek it out for an introduction to the style. Don't seek this out if you are looking for something complex, such as Brother Thelonius by North Coast. Naturally, try this for an introduction."
""
""
"Overall this isn't a bad beer. Fans of the style should definitely give this one a go. If you're not a fan however, avoid as there's nothing special enough to justify the purchase price."
""
"PRETTY GOOD, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"Reddish brown, one finger of white head, minimal lace, decent retention. Smell is yeasty, lots of dark fruits, raisin, brown sugary notes, faint alcohol, some overripe banana and dark bread. Taste is fruity, grape and raisin, bready, brown sugar, banana, toffee/caramel. Over carbonated and fairly thin, fairly light feel as well. This was better as it warmed but for the style this isn't great, I would probably drink it again though if it were in front of me."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
"Overall – The beer had an interesting taste from the wood flavour. While not something I would drink on a regular occurrence, I'm happy I gave it a try."
""
""
"M- Thin with lively carbonation. Imagined it would be heavier than this."
"Poured maroon, which appeared a bit redder around the edges. Light tan head with some relatively dense lace and modest head retention.Nose of light toasty grains and breads, a pinch of dark fruit notes come through as well. Dried grapes and some light sugar notes. Fairly simple. Taste has some caramel, dark fruits, a hint of copper, more bread and brown sugars. Drying finish. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium with a carbonation that's a tad crispier and fizzier than I'd hope for; once the carbonation dies down, the body is still too thin for my liking. Still enjoyable, and this could work well with some food pairings I'd gather."

"Overall, another nice offering from van Steenberge. It's not the most outstanding Belgian dark, but a good beer nonetheless."
"This is a dark amber beer with a nice ratio of foam. This is beer has a non-eventful smell, some what disapointing. Mouthfeel is full of bubbles and that is being proper. The taste is very, well, nice. There are hints of roasting and a nice hoppy mix. We like it! Overall the smell and taste do not match, but do not let that get in the way of having one."
"Pours a cola brown color with modest sized head, and surprisingly modest compared to many Belgians. Nose has some dark toffee, figs, brownbread, and a nice musty quality. On the palate a black tea element is there, some light caramel, and a light body. Finish is light with more black tea, and I find this ale is very drinkable."
"-Overall 4.0: Another very good Van Steenberge beer. This is refreshing and quite a difference from the golden ""dubbles"" that so many of us are accustomed to. Worth sampling when you find it."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to brown color with a light tan head. In the aroma, big candy sugar and a small fruitiness. In the taste. a small roast, almost chocolate like, and a small candy sugar in presence. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry small candy sugar in the aftertaste. Big candy sugar and a nice small roast. Nice but nothing exciting."
"M&D: mildly carbonated, medium-bodied, the balance is retained intact throughout the drink, and overall the hop contents seem to make some impact. Not bad, but all in all slightly boring to my taste."
"Not disappointing at all really."
"From a stubby bottle into a small snifter, pours a rich brown with an off white head with little lace. Aroma of caramel, malt, and some wood/oak elements. In the flavor, malt driven possessing a faint roasted quality. Muted fruit notes from the yeast and a semi-dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a chalky yeast presence. Overall, a nice abbey brew, authentic and very much a true Belgian."
"Overall, very refreshing and drinkable Dark Ale, maybe lacks body, but flavours compensate for that."
"D: Although the beer is sweet, it's not entirely difficult to drink because the sweetness isn't cloying and is balanced to some degree by the spices."
"D: Average drinkability. I wouldn't be bummed if this is was the only beer at a party, but certainly wouldn't want it to be."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Belgian dark ale."
"A nose that evokes esters and roasted malts that offer good odor smell. The palate is sweet without being lightweight and offers, especially in the finish, a spice that is not uninteresting, and offers a taste of some spices on the tongue. A fairly drinkable beer for its type without being extraordinary"
