"This sound like such a good idea, but it's not really much fun. From the mercifully bottle-capped 750 ml bottle purchased at Grapevine Liquor in Denver."

"This meeting between Brettanomyces, a traditional Belgian yeast strain and German hops yields a very pleasant and highly drinkable brew that boasts much complexity, but also remains approachable. Rustic and familiar, it grows on the palate with each sip."
""
"Overall - give it a go if you like dark Belgian ales and Funkwerks but if not, stick to the Saisons and their lighter ales (Provincial) which I believe they do much better."

"the newest bottled offering from funkwerks finally made it into my home. it is a unique beer that pours a rust shade and boasts a two inch off white head, thick and lovely. the nose is sort of bland compared to some other funkwerks stuff, I really don't get the heavy dose of brett I was expecting, but there is a nice spice element from either rye malt or some added spices, hard to tell. the flavor features nicely roasted german malts, some fall spice, and a warming Belgian yeast finish. its complex enough, but I don't think this beer is up to the usually very high level of funkwerks beers, it seems to be missing or lacking something, but maybe age will help this one, as the brett continues to develop. it also seemed out of context, like more of a cold weather beer, but the craftsmanship is still impressive. good bubbles and a medium body that drinks smoothly. others in our group liked this one more than me, I was really hoping for more of a brett influence, but perhaps a good introductory beer to those intimidated by or unfamiliar with the power of brettanomyces."

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus, and onion and garlic hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus and herbal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that tastes better than it smells in my opinion."

"I'm gonna quibble about the style designation here - this is by no means 'dark', so perhaps a plain ol' BPA would suffice. Aside from that, this is a tasty, decent Brett-infected Belgian ale. Not all that funky or sour, but evenly drinkable, and there's room aplenty in this world for that."

"Pours a maroonish caramel with a big, khaki head. Love the aroma with some funkiness, some bubblegum, cherry-apple caramel, a touch of cinnamon, and a little grass. Flavor pretty much follows through. A crisp, active mouthfeel. This beer is dangerously drinkable Overall, bottle just might be better than the tap variations I had previously tried. A great release by Funkwerks here."
