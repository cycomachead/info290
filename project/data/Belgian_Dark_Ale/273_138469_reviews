"Overall- Not a very good beer in my opinion.  I am not a big fan of many of the beers from Sweetwater and this is one of them."

"Poured a dark red/brown with very little head. Very nice aroma with a smooth taste and  feel"
"2.9/5: No idea what this beer will catch - it certainly didn't reel me in"

"not sure I see where the Belgian is in here.  looks good, nice aroma, taste was rather sweet."
"Usually I am not a huge fan of these domestic Belgian types, but this one is pretty good. It's got a lot of grain to it, body and toasted red malts, caramel, nuttiness, but it's not at all sweet, the yeast does a great job of cleaning that up. Fruity from the yeast, but not bubblegum, it's more pears and citrus, which help to lighten it. It's also real well carbonated and refreshing as a result. Definitely a little something different here, not my favorite from these guys, but absolutely better than its ratings on here. Not in love with the yeast strain, but the beer tastes pretty good on the whole."

"Overall a pretty average beer. Ok in a pinch but wouldn't seek it out again."

"Thought this was a lot better than the score would suggest. Nice overall Belgian  character . . . nothing fantastic but still pretty well done. One of the better Sweetwater offerings I've had. Compare it to some of the beers in it's style and it does quite well."

"I'm a Sweetwater fan, this is a solid beer, but I wasn't blown away."
"Not the best mix of malt and hops flavor."
"Had this on draft and enjoyed it.  It is smooth like a Killians with a bit of a spice finish."

"Nice taste. Not a big fan of hefty winter beers but this one is pretty good. Wets the whistle well at 6% ABV. I compare it to Ghost River Riverbank Red here in Memphis."
""

"Flavor reveals pear skin bitterness and floral notes, with toasted malt at the base. The finish is slightly spicy. There's a woody, bitter character that pervades in the aftertaste."
"With the malty sweetness swiftly trailing, the spices and grain stand tall. Boosted with the high bubbly nature of the beer, the medium-bodied ale takes on the slim tang of rose wine but with the nutty and spicy aftertaste of Belgian dubbel."
"Overall, this one is a miss from Sweetwater. It is a decent attempt but it just misses the mark for me."

"This seems a nicely unique ale and to my mind it is really unlike other SweetWater brews.  The beautiful red has a big malty and fruity nose with a hint of spice.  But it doesn't taste ""fruity.""  It is unique in that it has the big sweet malty character of a Belgian-style, but somehow at the very same time has a crisp hopiness.  Both are present throughout.  There is a surprise lingering hop character that is a bit like an IPA.  I look forward to trying this a second time.  This could be my new favorite from this brewery."
"Overall - I am definitely not feeling this one. Not really bad, but I just didn't like it at all."

"Good beer, bad name."
"As politely as I can, let me say this beer just isn't on point."

"Great American Belgian from Atlanta"
"Pours a clear pale brown garnet/ruby producing 2 fingers of moderately lived, beige head that leaves a nice webby wash of lace. Aroma is dark malt, banana, clove, caramel & dried apple/pear with a sour, ashtray note that is slightly off putting. Taste is dark malt with caramel & toasted hints, Belgian yeast fruity esters of clove, not quite ripe bananas & apple with the same but more restrained ashtray hint. Spicy/peppery finish with a  little bitterness. No hop presence outside of the bitterness. Malty, yeasty aftertaste is mildly astringent & slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, prickly, dry & mildly astringent in the aftertaste."
"O:  Overall, not a great beer.  I was excited to try something new, but this one isn't doing it for me.  Belgian character is a good start, but the finish is very odd."

"I'm a huge sweetwater fan and I thought the beer was ok."

"Clear chestnut color with a small creamy head.  Belgian yeast aromas mostly: clove, bubblegum, and a little cherry along with some nutty malts.  Flavor is a spicier and rougher...peppercorns, light candy sugar, dried flowers, and earthiness.  Very raw and yeasty.  Medium bodied with a nice texture. Not good."
"Overall, a really good beer.  This beer is a good one to go to when you are in the mood for those traditional  yeast notes that you may associate with a hefeweizen."
"O - This brew is easy to drink, but I think it would be much better with turning the heat up a bit.  Nothing stands out here.."

"The body of the beer was clear, and a shade of orange-brown I can describe as auburn.  The head was relatively modest, estimated at one finger thick.  The aroma displayed the unmistakable spicy sweet signature of Belgian yeast.  This smelled like cherries, white pepper, orange zest, and coriander.  The taste was fruity and spicy with flavors of apple, banana, pear, clove, saffron, naval orange, and some toffee were present.  The finish was very dry and quite floral.  There was a good deal of complexity in the taste, but the body was quite thin, and I wish there was more heft present here.  The aftertaste was spicy but faded quickly.  Easy to enjoy this beer on a winter night, but you are going to need more than one, if you want it to keep you warm at night."

"Mouthfeel: Hop bitterness comes on pretty strong as a harsh, lingering earthy bitterness.  Medium bodied, with low carbonation."
