3.68,-2.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, pear, apple, caramel, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, plum, pear, apple, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light clove, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes od raisin, plum, pear, apple, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and solid robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with a very good malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a nice Belgian brown ale. Good balance and solid robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 02, 2014"

3.54,-6.3,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear brownish/red color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like nuts, dark fruit, cloves and a bit of licorice. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but with the addition of some brown sugar and molasses. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and coating with moderate carbonation. Got this one as a single from one of my friends. Not a bad beer by any means, but regardless if this a brown ale or a Belgian dark ale, I like other beers of each style better.","bluejacket74","Aug 03, 2013"

4.12,9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall- It is qualified as a dark belgian, and the herbal notes and earthy hops make a case for this.

Brew pored to a medium brown color, darker in the bar but seemed to have some orange/reddish highlights coming through. Medium sized head that lasted for a minute or so and then fades to a film, some lacing. The nose gives a nice malt character with caramel, brown sugar, nuttiness and slight apple or pear. The flavor IMO was not a match for what was in the nose, as it seemed to be muted in many areas. Very sweet IMO, which could have lead to the muted feel. While the sweetness seems to be slightly overpowering there is a nice roast flavor, which is nice just wish it was more in the forefront. Slight hop profile found which comes through at the backend though it does not stick around. Though I feel like I did bash this brew a bit the sweetness while a little too much was not overwhelming and the flavors that I picked up where not bad, just muted - plus it drank very easily.

Taste is also sweet, full of caramel and roasted malty goodness, more dark fruit undertones, grain and bread notes follow through to a dry finish, with a slight hint of a bitter hop bite. Mouthfeel is watery, light bodied with low to moderate levels of carbonation, a smooth brew that goes down exceptionally easy. Being paired with a sweet malty aroma and flavor along with the low abv% and light body, this would make for a great session beer. Recommened trying if available, definitely a worthwhile beer, would purchase again.","danielocean03","Jul 06, 2008"

3.77,-0.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"A medium pour produces a two-fingered pale tan head of medium duration and good lacing. Brilliant golden-amber in color. Nose is plummy, yeasty, and full of biscuity malt. A bit rum/raisiny too, but experience tells me it's not nearly that sweet. Sweet and tangy on the first sip, with biscuit-malt filling the mid-palate before succumbing to a tangy and drying effect. Bitterness is mild but pronounced, and works well at offsetting the sweeter aspects of the pale and crystal malts. The yeast character which is imparted really reminds me of the Konigshoeven/LaTrappe line, especially their Dubbel which I haven't sampled in years - is it one and the same? Fruity esters about, with banana and light cherry along with the plumminess apparent on the nose - rather like an Alt or two I've tried in the past. The dryness here is somewhat complex, lingering but tempered by the tanginess of the yeast. Also, it really seems like there may be wheat malt (oat?) in here as well, something conbtributing to the smooth, even mouthfeel and banana esters. Light honey notes impress upon the palate as this warms a bit, and overall the mouthfeel really improves with warming also. Body seems thin at first, but the mouthfeel helps this along and helps to make it quite drinkable altogether. A very good beer (it's my go-to imported 'brown' ale), and pairs nicely with sharp cheddar. Served chilled in chalice.","Chaz","May 07, 2007"

Good carbonation, with endless trails rising to the surface. The aroma is on the light side, but there are still hints of dark fruit aromas, along with a little sweet malt. The taste is very interesting, but not as complex as other Belgian style ales, that I've tried. Light fruityness up front, followed by a little malt thickness, and then finishing with the same fruit sweetness. A little light on the flavor for a Belgian, but nonetheless, still tasty.

Lots of carbonation in the first part of this beer, then a nutty flavor begins to emerge. Next is what seems to be a rush of water.

So, the beer was a very nice dark brown color and had a decent head. it smelt really sweet, but nothing that made you not want to drink it. once you finally get around to having a sip you are almost immediately overpowered by the sweetness of the beer. wouldn't have been so bad if that was what you were expecting... but, I wasn't... and it was too sweet in my opinion. my girlfriend complained of a plastic aftertaste, but I didn't really notice it.

4.25,12.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Tilburg's Dutch Brown Ale brewed by Koningshoeven for Bavaria is an interesting interperetation of an oud bruin. It pours a clear, reddish copper body beneath a short head of creamy, light-tan foam that drops readily to an average collar and leaves only minor lacing about the glass. The nose is quite enticing with bright notes of darkly caramelized sugars laced with fruit (berries, a touch of red cherry). More sugars appear in the flavor... some are clearly caramelish, but others are more like simple table sugar; although there is also a subtle chocolatey edge that hangs around in the background. There's less fruit than might be expected given the nose; and there's also a floral note that's no doubt due to some hops. It's quite unique. Clearly, this is an ale that's been sweetened to some extent, and yet there's no real sourness or tart fruit to off-set its bold sweetness; leaving it slightly off-balance. The body is solidly medium, and it's fine, restrained carbonation leaves it slightly viscous and very smooth across the palate; also lending to its impression of sweet, caramel-drenched maltiness. There is some hop bitterness present, but it's not noticeable until after the swallow when the sweetness has receeded and it appears at the back of the throat.

3.73,-1.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a massive rocky ivory head that slowly collapses upon clear russet-brown liquid. Lots of hay and grassy notes in the nose with slight maltiness creeping up behind. The first taste was fruity and chocolatey/malty sweet. Some brown sugar notes tasted as well, along with a pleasing Belgian yeast character in the aftertaste. Finished up sweet and satisfying...very tasty and drinkable.","beerluvr","Sep 13, 2003"
3.1,-18,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Clear reddish-brown color, decent size off-white head. Sweet sugar and caramel aromas, sweet and malty flavors, nice carbonation medium bodied, finishes with a lingering sweetness, not my favorite style but pretty drinkable, I can't complain since I got this bottle for free.","maxpower","Jul 26, 2003"
