"A good beer reminiscent of the olden dark-ale days, 1554 will make any night into a classic. Not too strong in terms of ABV, you could drink 1554 through a night, guilt-free. This Belgian style dark ale provides a classic European taste with fine malt and a toned-down presence of hops. Creamy, smooth, and more dulled than its hoppy neighbours, 1554 is the social drinker's answer to one well planned night. Bringing in the expert craft of New Belgian brewers, this beer offers a night full of relaxation and comfort with its earthier tones and inviting warmth, and is well worth the adventure."

"Overall this is much better than I remember from years ago. Quite complex if not mind-blowing. Interesting hybrid style. Hopefully I won't go as long before drinking my next one."
"I think this is an underrated beer. It has an incredibly dessert-like flavor. Delicious."

"Roast malt, dark chocolate, and a hint of Belgian yeast esters in aroma. Flavor reveals a weak Belgian yeast character of pear, muted roast notes, and a base of dark chocolate. Very drinkable, approachable beer with varied character."

"Overall - Is it an ale? Is it a lager? (warm fermented with lager yeast) Who cares... it's a really tasty, really drinkable dark beer. The flavor is subtle and approachable enough to not scare away rookie beer drinkers, yet ample enough to satisfy seasoned craft enthusiasts - no small feat! I can't find a whole lot wrong with this beer; it's really easy to knock a few back."

"This is probably my favorite New Belgium beer.  It's a very unusual style for an American craft brew, and you should make sure to try it.  Goes great in the wintertime, but is available year-round.  Dark, but not bitter.  Flavorful, but not high alcohol.  You probably haven't had anything like it in these parts."

"The body is medium, and it's boldly but not heavily crisp while remaining extremely creamy with a semi-dry feel from start to finish."

""
""
""
""
""

""
"Mouthfeel is light."
""

"Dark reddish brown pour. Nice malty smell. Has a very light crispy roasted malt taste, but still has a lot of flavor. Can also taste some caramel and plum."

"Poured from a bottle into a glass. 1554 is one of the better offerings from New Belgium. The appearance is incredibly dark upon pour. The smell is the worst part of this beer with a weak wheat and caramel smell. The taste and the mouthfeel are incredible though with a very smooth finish. Highly recommend, especially in the winter."

"O: Not a bad beer at all. It isn't extremely heavy and has good flavors which make it surprisingly sessionable. It would be nice if they made a one off Imperial/Double version of this to make things shine a little brighter"

"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is balanced between foaminess (1/2) and smoothness (1/2) that works for the beer and is within stylistic guidelines as well. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness on the palate."
""
""
"Final thoughts - Another I can't believe I haven't reviewed. A bit on the expensive side $8+ a sixer and a decent 5.6% abv"
""
""
"Pours a dark mahogany with a small white head. Has a chocolate and coffee aroma. Flavor is also chocolate and coffee, with a touch of malts and bitterness. Taste and feel are both a tad light. Overall this is pretty decent, but not all that memorable."

"Overall a good dark beer, I would have liked the weight to reflect the color and the flavor was quite good but simple. Simple is not automatically bad but this review comes from the perspective of someone who's favorite dark American beer is Point 2012 Black Ale which has about ten thousand flavors going on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very tasty and what I love is how refreshing it is. I can take long drinks and it feels great. Would definitely recommend this."
"Overall, a fairly drinkable beer for the style but a tad bit on the sweet side."
""
""
""
"Overall I feel like its unimpressive. I go to my local grocery store when I want something dark but not salty like Guinness. (all they have is 1554 and Guinness) Sure it hits the spot when you need a satisfying dinner beer but this is nothing to write home about."
""
""
""
""
"1554 has become a regular staple in my house. I am a huge Fat tire fan and figured I would try some of New Belgium's other beers. They are quickly becoming my favorite brewery and is always in my house. They have a great variety pack at Costco. unfortunately 1554 is not apart of that pack. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wonderfully thick and smooth ale that perfectly balances a sweet body with nutty earthiness. I can only describe this beer as delightfully charming, but satisfyingly complex. I will soon be picking up more."

"1554 is an eye-opening beer. The combination of toasted, nutty malts and sweet, chalky yeast characteristics make for an interesting pairing. It may be hard to convince some that the flavor mesh is worth tracking down a bottle. Still, this is a well crafted beer that I would certainly have again on a cold winter night."

"Overall: Good beer for winter. Not a typical dark belgian style- expect more of a stout or porter when purchasing. I would have it again, but would not be my top choice beer from New Belgium."
""
""
""
""
"Mouth: Rich and heavy bodied, this beer is fairly heavily carbonated for something with such a significant malt presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Pours a very dark brown in color with a small tan head. Leaves a good amount of lacing when sipped. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is of roasted malts, chocolate and dark fruit. The taste is about the same with a slight dry smokey finish. No harsh or bitter aftertaste. This is my favorite brew from this company by far. Great brew for the colder months."
""
""
""
"Mild and very drinkable. Very smooth."
""
"Overall - great for the price point, so I give credit to NB for that!"

"At first sip you notice a bitter taste. By the second tasting you notice the chocolate. Not usually a dark beer drinker, but picked this up in a variety 6 pack. Glad I did, may have to try and brew this one myself. I love Belgian beers, with abv closer to 6% as was this one. Must try this one if you haven't. Low carbonation, but very tasty - great after dinner drink."

"O: Great beer. I would like to take this recipe and make a Dubbel. Making the other half of malts all wheat.. Great beer. I love it"
""
""
""
"Decent beer. My first black ale and I was pleased. If I'm feeling up for a malt taste without feeling like I'm drinking molasses this would be my go to."
""
""
"The feel is dry, smooth and very easy, yet full enough too create an exceptional experience. I think this is one of New Belgium's finest ales and one of my favorites."

"O: Very sessionable. Wish it was more carbonated. But overall, a great malt experience."
""
""
""
"Poured a deep maroon, almost completely brown, but showed some beautiful garnet tones in the light. Cream colored head that lasted a very long time. Nose is clean, but abundant with deep, dark fruits, a hint of cocoa powder, and raisins. The flavor is much similar, but surprised me with the cocoa, which added a nice complexity to the beer. Rich body, nicely carbed."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Going in to this review I was expecting to find 1554 unable to hold up to the memory I have of it, but as it turns out it was just as good if not more enjoyable than the memory. A great beer by New Belgium, albeit a wrongly categorized one. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Bottom Line: Worth trying."
""
""
""
"Overall - Hard to believe I hadn't reviewed this beer yet; one of New Belgium's older and more popular beers. It's decent enough, but it's never been a beer that I've ever craved."
""
""
""
""
""
"While enjoyable on its own, this is far from the strong flavor and aromas one typically expects from the style."
""
""
"A well done beer, similar to an American porter or black ale, with roasty, cocoa and malt upfront, highlighted by the hop notes, though in this case it is a more floral, earthy hop character."
""
""
"This beer is okay, but how is this really different than an American Porter? It tastes like one, feels like one, and appears like one. Sometimes I feel that the lines of ""beer styles"" is heavily blurred. Overall not a bad brew though. A decent easy drinking dark beer with a minimal, but good, flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer is defintely worth a try, especially since it is so easy to find in NB's markets. However, for ultimate enjoyment, drinking in solitiude is prefered to enjoy all its subtleites."
""
""
"A very nice dark ale. Smooth and flavorful."
"Delicious, dark and complex. Amazingly there is not a trace of bitterness, only smooth complexity on the palate from beginning to end. For such a dark beer, the lack of bitterness was as surprising as it was awesome. It is better on tap than in the bottle, but over here on the East Coast, I'd take either!"
"O: I found this to be a nice easy beer to drink. The presence of alcohol flavor makes it a bit hard to enjoy, but the rest of the beer is nice. It has a pleasant roasted flavor that fans of stouts and porters will undoubtedly enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I know it wont be everyone's cup of tea, but if you drink beer, and enjoy trying al of them, you must add this to your portfolio of beers you have had. I had zero expectation because it looks like Guinness, and I hate Guinness... But this is no Guinness, this is heavy in a glass made out of cute puppies licking you and acting cute every sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Glad I tried it. Not bad at all, just not special. It honestly reminds me of the Yeungling Porter, which I assume was not the goal of this beer. 7/10 would drink again."

"On my scale of 1-5 with no half points I would give it a 3, being good, 2 is average, one is basically a drain pour, 4 is excellent and 5 is the holy Grail of beers, suffice it to say there won't be too many ones or fives, Cheers, Prost, Skol!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Years ago this was what my friends and I would purchase for parties and events nearly all the time due to its low price, its robust flavor, and its highly drinkable character. It's still a beer I'd revisit from NB whenever possible, but my palate's definitely changed over time towards it. Still, at the low ABV, I can't complain, and it still does the trick even now. For people who wanted to see better malt-focused beers from NB, give this a whirl."

"Tasty brew from New Belgium, probably my favorite from them so far. Interesting blend of styles, dry and chocolatey for a Belgian dark."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Tasty. A good solid beer, this may be my favorite New Belgium offering so far. Almost more of a sweet porter than a Belgian dark ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really like this beer. A nice dark beer without the strong roastiness found in most stouts."
""

"Poured into a pint glass. The beer pours dark brown to black with less than a finger length of very light tan head. Some light is visible at the bottom of the glass and it is ruby copper in color. I can also make out some rising tiny bubbles in the beer. The beer smells of bready malt, toffee, and dark chocolate. There's also a touch of earthiness in the aroma. The beer is nice and chocolately with some mild toffee to add some sweetness. I also get some of that malt breadiness and some earthiness. There's some roastiness as well some lingering back end bitterness. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is creamy. This is a very good beer. It would pair nicely with a good meal or work as an after dinner drink."

"Just got back from a road trip in Southern Illinois (can't get New Belgium beers in Alabama where I live). Tried this beer in a local restaurant with a good meal and found it to be the perfect paring. Poured from a bottle into a frosted pint glass. It was a very smooth dark beer of about medium body with a slightly sweet taste and no after taste. Very refreshing and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There is a lot of porter character in this beer with a light Belgian-like twist which made a lot more sense when I read that the yeast is handled like a Steam Beer by fermenting a lager yeast at higher temperatures. A hard to place beer but hard to forget, I've been looking forward to another bottle of this for almost four years."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- - Solid Belgian dark ale. Not outstanding but pretty darn good."
"I struggle to find beers that agree with me, but 1554 has become a favorite. Not knocking hoppy beers but I prefer a more malty, creamy brew. 1554 delivers a creamy, malty, chocolate mouthgasim that keeps me heading back for more. It's very smooth and I get no objectionable aftertaste, just a pleasant reminder of its flavors. I may be a noob and beer sissy, but 1554 just plain works for me. I usually drink it right out of the bottle, but I have obtained some pint glasses of late and it seems to bring out more flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: One of my favorites from New Belgium, such a brilliant black ale, the description on the bottle says it all."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours up with a one and a half finger head and leaves extensive and elaborate lacing. Retention is good. The color appears to be black, but holding it up to the light shows a deep ruby color. The nose is kind of salty and soy sauce with notes of coffee. Taste is licorice and coffee with some sweet chocolate. Mouthfee is mild and inoffensive. Pretty good beer, but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather tasty brew. A little on the sweeter porter like side but still quite drinkable and refreshing."

"O - Surprisingly good. I like New Belgium brewery, but for the most part, their beers usually rank as just slightly above average to me. This one sits a little higher than that. I could definitely see myself picking this up again in the future, or trying it on draft if I can find it."

"this is one of my favorite beers, it sucks it's not in jersey. in the military, had some great beers, and this is one of them. it is outstanding, great flavor, nice and thick. i had it a few weeks ago in TX, one thing good about Wichita falls. looking forward to when it makes it's way to NJ."

"Pours a dark mahogany with a finger-thick cream head and medium lacing. Smells of dark malt and a hint of chocolate. Tastes full-bodied and complex. Nice toasted barly highlighted with some chocolate and a pinch of hops to balance it out. Also some spices detected. Nice light mouthfeel with a smooth start and a bubbly finish. Overall, a good brew, very New Belgiumy. (yes that's now a word)"
""
""
""
"Poured into a tulip glass. A deep ruby red hue; thin lacing. Sweet, pleasant coffee aroma with some spicy overtones. Dark chocolate flavor, very nice and smooth, malt forward. Light to medium mouth feel, medium carbonation. Overall: Not a very complex ale but simplicity can be a nice break sometimes. Very enjoyable."

"Overall: A great dark beer, flavorful and complex. I'm going to blame the greenness on the bottle and not the beer. Has an added dimension to the typical brown ale, and I think it would be a friendly alternative for those turned off by the characteristics of a porter. Will definitely seek this one out again."

"Poured this Belgian Dark Ale from a 12 oz glass into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown color, produced a thick tan head, excellent retention and lacing. The aroma consisted of roasted barley and chocolate. Medium bodied, this ale contained a foundation of roasted malt, dark chocolate, pear and belgian yeast. Nice session beer, good example of the style."
"O: Fantastic beer, and very drinkable, and it had the hallmarks of the beers I really crave: sweet, dark malts, a dry aftertaste, and repressed hops, but it seemed to lack a floral depth and juiciness that I get with my usual Belgian Blacks from Unibroue. And yet the 1554 is usually considered the gold standard for Belgian Blacks, eh? Terrific, but it doesn't quite make the pantheon. 3.75"
""
"Recommended to drink warm, this beer really shines."
"Overall: not bad but tastes like a decent porter. not the belgium character i expected/wanted but cuts it as a easy drinking porter."

"O - The story of the recipe on the bottle is more interesting than the beer, unfortunately. It is good, but I've had many a porter and dry stout (which is what this ""Belgian dark"" suggests) that are better for a similar price point. Kind of surprisingly low review for me, because I tend to like New Belgium's offerings."
""

"O: I really enjoyed this beer, another good brew from New Belgium, I actually never heard of this one, it's not one of their big names in mainstream craft brews but I really liked it and I recommend it to everyone."
"O – Nice drinkable beer, nutty malts balanced by a nice roast coffee. Good beer to grab when its a little chilly outside or when you want a sessionable flavorful beer."

"Poured into a glass from a 12 ounce bottle. Pours a very thick head that last for quite some time. Nice dark color that looks like a cross between an Amber and a Porter. Taste is a bit of chocolate malts with a subtle hop finish. Pretty smooth overall and medium bodied. It didn't have a coffee taste like some of the other black ales I've had, but I'd say overall this was a solid black ale by New Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
"I really don't want to seem cliche giving this beer a perfect score, but quite honestly I had absolutely zero gripes with it. I'm a big fan of New Belgium's beers, and I'm a dark ale guy. And this stuff is honestly the most appealing beer I've ever tasted. When you smell it, the sweet caramel / chocolate aroma hits hard, giving you a good sign of what you're in for - the head on this stuff is gorgeous, although not the world's thickest. It's a true beauty to look at once you've poured it into a glass. I'm really glad to see so many positive reviews on this beer, because in all honesty, it's my new favorite. I'll definately be buying it again, and probably many more times to come."

"A Belgian style black beer? I’m not sure what category this fits in, exactly. It pours a deep amber, not quite black but fairly opaque. There’s a big, malty nose on it, almost cloyingly sweet. That’s your cue to be prepared. 1554 has a rich, thick sweet caramel malt flavor with some tartness to balance it out. It’s not a bitter beer, nor is it roasty, so save it for dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While this is a great beer and easily drinkable, it's missing the one standout thing that could give it a perfect score."
""
""
""
"O-Good beer, would go well with dessert. Will get again."
"Pours a pretty deep garnet, clear, with a big frothy fluffy tan head that persists throughout the whole beer. Smells are roasted and sweet, much like a porter. Tastes are roasted, slight floral and slight cooked vegetable to me, and a little nutty. Enjoyable. Mouthfeel is a little pungent and the body a bit flat. It's possible I drank this a little too warm but I don't think so. This beer does take on a strange aroma once at the end, or room temp. Like an average dinner cooking, strange. My score reflects the 'initial' aroma only."
""
""
""
"O: I like this for a go to beer when you want an enhanced flavored sessional beer. Nice malt blend with an appropriate amount of bitter dryness to round out the sweetness. I will purchase this again for sure. Cheers!"
""
""

"Want to write a review for the record try, but not really qualified to post here much less than an average good for this beer, not really liking the style much. This is a toasted roasty malt forward something of a beer, and is OK. Not really too bitter, with complex notes of bread, caramel and some cocoa. Moderate to low carbonation and mouthfeel is OK."

"This a very satisfying, rich and smooth dark ale. It reminds me somewhat of Milk Duds candy in liquid form. A soul satisfying beer..."
""
""
"Taste-Dark toasted malt, some spicy Belgian yeast notes, subtle chocolate. Nicely balanced and pretty tasty. The subtle spiciness really makes this brew. Nice flavor and character. Pair with a big burger or a plate of tacos. Recommended."

"This beer was served in a pint glass from a tap. The color was absolutely gorgeous with exception clarity. The 2-finger ivory head held up well with very nice lacing. While this beer looks like a stout in the glass, the feel in the mouth is very much an ale. A nice crisp feel with notes of malty sweetness. A hint of dark chocolate and molasses with nearly no bitterness. This is a very drinkable beer and a must try!"

"O- This is an impressive beer that I find to have a very high drinkability factor! I would very much enjoy this on a regular basis if it were found in my area, but it is not to be currently....it is clean, flavorful, smooth and everything else that a great beer should contain. Well done and I will definitely look for this one again!"
"Yes."
""
"Pours dark brown with a solid eggshell colored head. Some lacing left on the glass through consumption. Smells malty - chocolate, sweet. Taste is great - again more chocolate and a Belgian candy sugar finish. Refreshing, yet full of body and depth. Sweet, yet dry on the finish. Too bad I have just one."
""
""
"Anyway, most noticed its lager traits in their mouthfeel reviews. It is a very light beer and incredibly sessionable."

"I poured this nice beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a dark beer with a really nice creamy head. I like that! The smell was faint roastedness smell. The beer was actually a little bland I thought for what it looked like. I still liked it as it was very drinkable and I will buy again."

"Pours a dark ruby brown with a thick creamy off white head that retains well and laces the glass. The aroma is nutty, lactic roasted chocolate.Taste is favorably mild with a great dryish mixture of black malts and chocolate with just a hint of dried floral spices and yeast. Just barely sweet within and has a bit of roastyness."

"The beer is dark brown, approaching black, with a quarter inch of beige head. The aroma brings some Belgian style malts, chocolate, a touch of grain. The flavor brings some sweet milk chocolates and some bready malts. Not the most refined flavor, but easy enough to throw back a pint of this. Light to medium in body and fairly creamy on the palate. I drank a lot of this beer in college, so it was nostalgic to return to it after a long hiatus."
""
"Overall: Pretty solid black ale or Belgian dark ale. I was really surprised how tasty this beer was when I drank it. Pretty solid score and happy that my brother chose to bring this back from his trip to TN. Next time I am out in Colorado, I will have to hunt this beer down."

"This pours a dark brown with a slight off white head. There is a slight scent of roasted malts mixed with a mild yeast tone. The taste has a mild roasted malt taste. The texture and volume is perfectly done. Smooth, tasty, and refreshing! A rather boldly made brew that most will find very likeable. A great brew for those looking to start drinking dark beers but can’t quite handle a porter or stout yet. A great beer for the price!"
""

"O: A good beer. Flavors aren't terribly complex, but they are executed well. The rich flavor without an overpowering aftertaste makes for a nice drinking experience. I would certainly have this again, but wouldn't go out of my way to do so."

"1554 Enlightened black ale pours a black color, with a nice lacing tan head. There is a nice sublet oakey aroma. A complex taste. A strong malty backbone, but with a profound oakey flavor, hints of chocolate, bits of Belgian candies. Good full flavor, everything blends well. Overall a very enjoyable beer. Easy to drink, good flavors, complex a lot going on and it comes together nicely."
"I really like this beer. Kinda reminds me of a porter. Some have said that they experience a ' burnt' taste with New Belgium beers. I do get a smokey smell and taste in this beer but not a burnt sensation. I can drink several of these while relaxing on a fall evening. I find it lighter than a porter, but still similar. The smell is lighter than a porter and the taste and mouthfeel is also lighter. If you read my reviews, I like dark beers, and this is a dark beer that I enjoying drinking regularly. I keep these in my refrigerator at all times. Even a new craft beer drinker will enjoy experiencing one of these as a lead-in to porters and then stouts."

"But as an actual beverage to drink, it's awful. Unbalanced, sickingly sweet, no hop character, horribly toffee flavored. It may be an old recipe, but not all old things are good."

""
""
"Dark brown/walnut, nearly opaque. Small, tan head that had good lacing and lingered. Aroma was of roasted malt, coffee, and maybe a hint of charcoal. Taste was of coffee, roasted malt, and a sweetness of dark fruit, maybe like raisin. Beer was initially served cold but aroma and flavor improved dramatically as it warmed. The beer had a lot of body and lingered well after swallowing. Paired quite nicely with my steak and was good with desert as well."

"O: While it's good, I think it's too hard to drink given its mild flavor profile. It's still worth a try and I might even get it again in the future."

"Overall it was OK, and a nice effort for recreating an old beer with a partial Belgian recipe, but I would not seek this out and deem this my least favorite New Belgium beer thus far. This beer was just off to me somehow, and while it was not bad, it really just didn’t excite me all that much."

"12oz bottle with a Best Before date of 16DEC12. Pours a black color with dark brown hues and a thin tan head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is nutty chocolate with some malts and earth. Some hazelnut coffee as well. Taste is more of the chocolate nuttiness but with a bit more coffee flavor than the aroma. Malty finish. Creamy mouthfeel. This is a perfect beer for crisp Autumn nights. Overall, worth grabbing again."

"Overall, I really enjoy this 'mixed' style of ale, the chocolate and lightly roasted malts blend very well with the subtle belgian yeast notes."
""

"Pours black with a beige head. A kinda sweet and roasty aroma but not super distinct. Flavor didn't work for me; roasted, a slight touch of chocolate, and a healthy dose of candied sugar and bubblegum. Yuck, I'll give it a 3 because I think my reaction is more subjective than objective but I definitely did not like this and did not finish my glass. A nice medium, creamy body. Overall, not for me. A definite pass that I wont try again."

"O - A subtle nod to Belgian yeast throughout the beer is a brilliant touch to differentiate this dark ale from either a stout or porter, something that carefully pushes boundaries. The real shining point, though, is the balance of malt, suggesting some of the darker qualities without being aggressive or overpowering, leaving 1554 a quite drinkable dark beer!"
"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a dark, rich red brown with a thin head that leaves light lacing. Malty, dark fruit aroma. Tastes malty and nutty with dark fruit, some roasted malt. This is much closer to a brown ale that leans towards a Porter. Medium bodied. There is no Belgian character that I can detect. Worth revisiting as a brown ale."
"It's not heavy like a porter or stout, but it's still slightly thick with a creamy head and everything. Enlightened, I guess. It's definitely a maltier beer and a great choice on a cool evening any time of year."
""

"-Overall 2.5: This is one of the most schizoid brews I have ever had the displeasure of tasting. It's all over the place. There's some story on the bottle about the ""intrepid researchers"" of the brewery finding a recipe in Belgium from the year 1554 for this beer and how this beer is different than modern beers. Well, if that is true, perhaps history was trying to teach us something and there's a reason this poorly evolved ancestor of modern beers is extinct."
"If you are a Maltster (NOT a Hophead...) you will love this beer, period."

"overall good for a light black ale.. as far as belgian dark/strong ales go, this shit's weal. sorry. it's tasty and all, but it will never be up there with the big boys."

"New Belgium knows beer. 1554 is no exception. I received this beer at a restaurant. It was presented in a tall thin glass. It was very dark and only semi-transparent. It had a 3/4"" head which it sustained for about ten minutes. The smell was earthy and sweet. The mouthfeel was nice. It had a heavy feel but really smooth, like silk. The taste was earthy and fruity with a hint of something sweet, perhaps chocolate. As with most of New Belgium beers, I give 1554 two-thumbs-up!!"

"On-tap at the brewery. Black with a creamy tan head. Smooth notes of smoke, charred sugar, and coffee are quickly washed away by a mild sweetness and lingering spicy hop note. Bitterness is mild. Not much in the way of any Belgian yeast notes, save for a subtle cherry and plum fruitiness and a hint of clove. The goal seems to be a drinkable, approachable, and easy-going dark beer, and I would say New Belgium hit that mark."

"Very tasty. Like a Belgian Schwartzbier."
"Not my favorite style (I prefer my Belgian darks to be strong), but this is nothing short of quality. It doesn't surprise me with New Belgium. I don't care for the blatant American twist on a Belgian style in the way that many craft brewers do tripels or pales. This is legit. Maybe a relief as most Belgian darks from the home country are swimming in yeast esters. This ale is complex enough to make you stop and muster up what you can in between sips, yet drinkable enough to forget that you're writing a beer review. I support you drinking this beer. 4.0"
""
""
""
"1554 pours a very dark brown-ruby color with minimal lacing. Wispy bubbles in the center of my pour suggest moderate carbonation. There is a subtle, sweet, chocolate scent to this ale. Taste-wise, chocolate and dark malts are present as well as a breadiness with coffee coming through at the end. Hops are playing their part more passively. I respect the velvet smooth mouthfeel and this is not heavy for a dark ale; only 5.6 %. An enjoyable dark ale, smooth and even somewhat sessionable due to the lower weight for the style. A dank New Belgium treat for me here in PA. Looking forward to east coast distribution."

"Overall I liked this beer and I thought that it was a slightly above average example of a Belgian Dark Ale, but I don't have much experience with this style so take it for what it's worth. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth, wasn't filling, and it had enough flavor to hold my attention, I could drink a couple of these in a row without a problem. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, I thought everything was on par for the style. What I liked least about this beer was the slightly higher amount of sweetness in the flavor, if it was toned down a little the flavor would be pretty damn good. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style but since I can't buy it in Michigan I doubt I will be having it again anytime soon. I recommend giving this beer a try, I think it would make a nice introduction to the style. This was a pretty solid Belgian Dark Ale from a pretty solid brewery, good job guys, keep making good beers and I'll keep seeking them out. A solid Belgian Dark Ale, but Brewery Vivant's Solitude is still my favorite Belgian Dark Ale."

"The beer looks good...deep and very dark brown with a big effervescent tan head that has strong retention but not much lace. The aroma is a little weaker than the taste but still exhibits nicely chocolatey malt character. The mouthfeel is likewise well done, with a medium body that's moderately and smoothly carbonated. Not exactly Belgian in feel, aside from the drying finish but that doesn't hurt the beer much if at all in my opinion. Nice, unusual session candidate from New Belgium."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some coffee. Taste is different for this style, coffee, a touch of chocolate without being sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent brew."

"I poured from a bottle into a conical shaped glass and was greeted with a two finger of tan color head that faded to some very nice lacing. The color was a nice black that showed ruby red when held up to the light. The nose was dominated by light and sweet malt.... With coffee and caramel notes. The taste was sweet with the malt that faded to an almost powdered cocoa note. The mouth feel was medium and clung to the palate, but lacked major carbonation on the tongue. Overall impression is a nice drinkable ale. It may well do for a nice dessert beer or after dinner drink."

"Deep mahogany/red color with low co2, and a light brown rocky head. Lacing is sticky and head retention is low. Aroma is acerbic and malty with a metallic background.

""

""
""
""
""

"Pours a dark brown that glints red in the light. A foamy cream/tan head that attenuates to lacing around the glass. A dark roasted malt aroma with notes of Belgian yeast. The first pull into the mouth promises mild creaminess. Pleasant smooth creaminess over the entire tongue with a mild bite of coffee acidity on the back of the tongue. Fireplace or BBQ smoke throughout. Nothing special, but quite drinkable."

"Appears a very dark brown in the glass, short-lived stumpy head with minimal lacing, smells and tastes mostly of roasted malts (porter-style) with a backing support of chocolate, I can't really find any black coffee aroma or flavor in this particular brew. But the flavor does stay somewhat surprisingly dry for something categorized as a ""Belgian Dark"" and it does have a medium strength serving of standard-issue pine resin hop bittering in the finish at least. Texture is medium and moderately carbonated."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by Feb 19, 2012. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big caramel, toasted malt, chocolate, light coffee, spicy hops, and light biscuit. Some nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toasted malt, light chocolate, spicy hops, and malty sweetness. No bitterness; with lingering notes of light chocolate, caramel, and toasted malts on the finish for a bit. Finish is a lot drier than I was expecting it to be, and the flavors aren’t very robust. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming after the finish. This is extremely drinkable. Overall a nice beer, but pretty lack luster in my opinion. When I read it was a black ale, I was expecting a much more robust flavor and body."

"Pleasantly surprising selection. I just grabed it for a pick your own six pack with out paying much attention. I haven't been a new belgium fan in the past, so I didn't expect much. I was pleased as I poured to see it was dark like weak coffee, which could describe the smell also. Mouth feel was nice, not to thin and perfect carbonation. Tasted of malt and slight coffee. Very drinkable beer, I wish I had more and will absolutely buy more."

"Clean and well made, but pretty plain. A nice alternative to the dull porters. I would have called it a Schwarzbier for the light body and subdued flavors. I don't get any flavors that I'd call Belgian, but maybe it's a very self-effacing yeast."
"Another winner at a very affordable price from New Belgium."
"Overall I think it's a pretty decent dark Belgian. It reminds me of a black lager almost but with a far more interesting finish."
"This is one I'd been interested in for a long time, but hadn't tried because of the inability to just buy singles here. I can see why it sticks around in New Belgium's lineup, but it's a quiet one."

"DRINKABILITY: This is a very agreeable, appealing sipping beer and as a result of its fullness, I wouldn't have more than two at a sitting. It is easy to drink, gives excellent value for the cost and I'd definitely buy it again. I wouldn't put it in the first tier of black ales, but it's definitely high in the second tier."
"I picked this bottle up on my recent Thanksgiving travels (you can't find NB here in Kentucky). Very dark mahogany color with a nice 2-finger head of frothy white foam. Very little light getting through, but appears to be quite clear and free of haze. The nose is very faint, but primarily offers toast and a touch of pine. The flavor is mild, malty, complex, and quite sweet. It's very reminiscent of a Scottish Ale. There are some flavors of toasted malt, caramel, and pancakes and the hops are only strong enough to balance things out just a tad. Mouthfeel is decent, but perhaps just a bit thin with all that malt present. Overall, this is a nice-tasting, easy drinking beer. It's a little mild for my tastes, but it's not bad at all."

"Overall - It's a slightly different Dark Ale in terms of flavor, but it tastes great and it's pretty easy to drink! It's good to see New Belgium has put alot of time and effort into creating what is truly an outstanding beer!"

"I remember thinking that I didn't really care for this beer for some reason. That was many years ago, though. Don't think I've had it since. This is a lot better than I remembered it being. I wonder what makes this a Belgian Dark, because I don't detect any Belgium yeast. Might just be overpowered by the roasted malts, which may be too prevalent, now that I think about it."
"Poured in a weiznen glass clear, dark mahogany with a light brown head and decent lacing. Lightly roasted malt aroma; chocolate and roasty; a bit musty. Light medium body and oily texture . Taste lightly bitter with a very long dry and lightly burned finish."

"TIZ THA SEASON! This beer is great for the winter. Not to dark in color when poured out light heat that hangs an min or so any way the smell is great. When you smell this beer you think it will be light in hops and high in malts. It is a very good brew! It has a sweet nutty finish with a nicely balanced hops behind it. PICK 6 At Kroger people this is the best way to find these great craft beers. Cheers!"

"M- Medium bodied, medium carbonation, refreshing, an easy drinking beer that makes for a great session."

"While not an overwhelming beer, this does bear the criteria for a pleasant sessional, though I could not establish anything resembling an IPA as this neat little beer is void of any hoppiness. Dark, mild and malty would be the three stooges stumbling around in the glass with this one. Still, I do like it as a mild quaff for any time of the year."

"Hmm good beer but an A- average seems to high. I am a fan of the amber ale Fat Tire. 1554 beer has a touch of Belgium to it. The beer has a subtle taste, subtle aroma and a beautiful dark brown color. However, my favorite Belgium brews have a little more flavor, and some yeast stuff like stuff floating around with a bouquet of fruit, wood, and spice smacking your senses. 1554 has a little of all of this, but it lacks a little bit everything."

"atmosphere is really solid. nice head and lacing. nose is a really fine toasted malt with bitter and sweet components. flavor is a great balance of grains with a little pungency and a subtle sweetness."
""
""
""
""
"Very dark brown color and develops only a small head when poured in the center of a snifter. The overall taste is sweet and malty. I detect a hint of cherry. The brew is quite carbonated and taste better to me if I swirl the brew in the glass to release some of the carbonation. While not my favorite it is a good effort."
""

""

"This beer is just about how I remember it. Tasty, though a little rougher around the edges than I'd expect from one of my intro craft beers. Very woody, a little bit roasty, and rather hollow. An interesting and enjoyable beer."

"Bland malty cherry tatse. More carbonation than id like with little personality. This was the second time ive had this...first time on tap, now in bottle. I didnt really like it then, and I dont really like it now. Not worth drinking, which is unlike my usual view of NB."
"A beer without real identity. Low in hop bite, slightly sweet, and with a fairly substantial roasted flavor ... but nothing to distinguish it from the pack. The roasted, almost smokey flavor is the most pronounced attribute. It lacks something ... just can't specify what."
"Easy to drink, light and refreshing for a complex beer. Pretty good all around, but nothing crazy about it. Just a nice beer."
"D: It's actually quite easy drinking. There is nothing wrong with this beer, but it doesn't jive for me on the level that others have before it."
"O - Overall pretty well balance, very nice feel on the pallet, drinkable. Solid brew"
"Overall, I'm probably going to get this again. It's a little more pricey than some of the other similar brews I've had, but a very solid brew."
"O: This ale is nothing special and really contributes nothing new to this style. It's really quite bland. Not worth going out of one's way to try."
"Poured into a New Belgium globe glass. Beer is a deep rich earth soil black. The creamy tan head dissipates leaving a nice layer of head as the beer goes down. Sticky random lacing. The smell is at first a bit boozy? but otherwise hints of bitter chocolates and raisins are present. The beer tastes of raisins, dark chocolate, banana peels over a roasted malt presence. An average mouthfeel, maybe a tad carbonated. Overall this would make a good dessert beer. But, it feels much heavier than 5.6% ABV. It's got a lot of complex flavors to mill over as you slowly enjoy this. Having said that, I've found that I struggled to get through my six pack over several days. There is something about this beer that I just do not like."
"O - For the style, it's mediocre. Not bad to drink, but to me it doesn't stand out."
"O- After the smell I was thinking this was going to have the complexity and flavor of something like Chimay Blue, but really feel short. Glad I tried but don't think I will get it again. I have really enjoyed the Lips of Faith series, but the regular New Belgium beers have been very underwhelming in my opion."
"My favorite New Belgium offering so far. Pours black w/ only a little brown highlight. Head is beige and laced the tulip well. Nice smell of roasty biscuit and what I think is that signature New Belgium yeast. Roasty taste is not overpowering and the sweetness is a perfect balance to the bitterness of the roast. Its not at all sickening sweet and ends semi-sweet. Light carbonation starts sharp and ends creamy. Kinda reminds me of a light Scotch Ale in a way. I'd highly recommend this and will be seeking it out again."
"one of the best new belgium beers i've had, poured into a frosted pint glass with a vigorous cream colored head. smell is roasty and boozy a bit, unique to some degree. flavor is great wow, really different that anticipated. hard to describe in a way, very unconventional black ale, missing the heavy filling dimension. really super sessionable. mouthfeel is soundly medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. really nice with spicy food as well"
"Overall a decent Belgian dark ale. Tastes way better than it smells."
"O: Great taste, subtle smell, and it looks awesome. Despite the ho-hum mouthfeel, it is something I would enjoy again."
"Poured from a bottle. Good looking dark ale with a thin head and decent lacing. The beer had a decidedly roasted quality with hints of toffee. Drinkable and fairly enjoyable. The mouthfeel was okay. Overall, this is a pretty decent beer from New Belgium that I wasn't really expecting."
"O: New Belgium has always been one of the better mainstream breweries. 1554 is defiantly not a great beer, but its certainly good. The biggest drawback is that the beers texture is on the light watery side.The chocolate and sweet malt come out pretty good. I was really surprised by the alcohol presence, considering that it's only 5.6. If your choices are limited, I would defiantly suggest this beer."
"O - Overall, a pretty good beer, but nothing epic. If they offered it in six packs in my area I would probably buy again at some point."
"Poured a dark brown with a little head that quickly leaves, slight lacing. Smells of coffe. Taste doesnt really become apparent until after you swallow it then the carbonation kicks in. The taste of coffee lingers after. Overall a decent beer I would pick this up again."
"O: a nice brew, smooth with nice flavors but is a bit heavy on the carbonation and would have like more head retention, overall enjoyable"
"With a hard pour gives a thick tan 3 finger head and a deep ruby black brown body. Gobs of lacing left behind, descent retention, left with a thin head left at the bottom of the glass. Mild aroma, toasted black bittered chocolate malts, cocoa, chalky lactose like sweetness, subtle yeast and very subtle yeast esters present. Flavors are mild as well, toasted chocolate, lots of cocoa, lactose, and subtle yeast. Overall sweet and dry, slight bitterness from roasted malts at the back of the tongue, really comes through more in the finish. Solid medium body, very creamy, smooth and dry finish, highly drinkable. Enjoyed this very much in the past, enjoyed this very much again for my review. Not much going on in the way of belgian characteristics, other than the hint of esters I got on the nose, but I will not hold that against this brew."
"O- a tasty dark ale with a touch of funk and fruit smooth on the palate with just a touch of funk"
"Overall Impression- While people are thused about this brew, I just think its good and drinkable. I never really go for this if I see it in a 6-pack but had to give it a try on-tap. Enjoyed it and will be again I'm sure."
"If I am in the mood for some different than a stout or porter, then I have a good brew I can turn to. Cheers!"
"This is a great malty standby, appropriate for the colder months. I've always been partial to this brew because of its mouthfeel. Maybe I've been too generous in my recommendations, but everyone I've offered this to has liked it. Very solid, and easy to come by."
"Overall it is fairly tasty with some easily enjoyable qualities, but it feels and tastes like an American brown ale rather than a Belgian style beer. This doesn't feel taste or smell Belgian style at all."
"O - This brew once was my favorite brew, but that was in college... Apparently, my taste has changed. a nice brew, but not worth seeking."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O-nice balanced beer with alot of flavor"
"Overall pretty good, nice and drinkable, almost like a creamy porter with nice flavors, doesn't get too bitter or acrid burnt flavors, nice smooth and drinkable demeanor."
"Poured a dark brown w/ two-finger head that dies quick but left lace patches on top of a roasted and sweet aroma, yet I detect a decent presence of yeast and I'm getting some orange hints from citric-like hops. TAste is more of the same as I get a light bodied beer that is simple yet goes down easy and gives off some minor citric fruitiness and a balance of dry, roasted and sweet malt and has a hearty dry finish. Another not perfect but pretty damn good (and inexpensive) belgian ale from New Belgium."
"A definite repeat for me."
"Medium mouthfeel and very drinkable. Solid overall beer."
"Overall- Pretty good. Tastes similar to a stout without the heavy feel."
"I know. I am not known as a Belgium fan. Usually like the simpler elegance of a German. But having tried and enjoyed Hoptober and Fat Tire recently, I thought it would be great to try something dark. This one was a very pleasant surprise. Downed the entire 22 oz myself (and that says a lot). Deep rich brown/mahogany in the glass with a creamy rich tan head that fell but maintained a presence (nicely lacing the glass) all the way down. Flavor was a touch sweet buttery malt, a touch roasted chocolate and a touch of bitterness--all in perfect balance. Rendered the whole incredibly smooth, creamy and without any odd flavors that may have impacted drinkability. Very good and I'm hoping that we get the smaller bottles out here very soon. One I'd keep around for daily consumption. Wow."
"O - I find most of New Belgium's year-round offerings pretty underwhelming, but I enjoyed this."
"O: One of New Belgium's better beers, actually. Really solid stuff."
"This is a delicious, smooth beer that I'd gladly buy again, especially if I wanted something that tasted like a stout with less of a roasted taste."
"A nice dark session beer. High drinkability and Belgian complexity that makes for an enjoyable beer."
"Overall, decent, but don't go out of your way for it."
"Overall: One of my favorite beers for New Belgium. This beer is a nice session beer. It is cheap, tasty and very easy to drink. Too me its like a poor mans Black Butte."
"A rather drinkable dark beer, but a little thin. With this type of roasted malt character, I prefer a thicker beer."
"Overall - Nice flavors, except for that finish. Just not a lot going on to distinguish itself."
"Overall - This is a decent beer. I still can't get over its similarity to Stella--not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with Stella, i just would expect something a little more complex from New Belgium."
"O: A pleasant surprise since I'm not a fan of Fat Tire. Good recommendation for an early Winter brew."
"O: Not a sipping beer. The best thing about it was that magically went down faster than drinking water as if it was coated with silicone. I think the aim was to drink this with food. it would go well with some meaty food because it's a good complimentary beer but not a stand out by itself."
"O- i don't care what anyone says...this is NOT a belgian dark ale. this tastes like something between a really dark brown ale and very tasty stout. its very good.i didn't expect this at all. its so smooth and crisp...definitely something i was excited to get at this local dive bar while on a road trip. this is must try in my opinion."
"D – Decent brew. Seemed more malty then anything else. I wouldn’t seek this brew out again but glad I tried it"
"However, its very subtle flavor fails to come through powerfully, but smoky vanilla and nutty flavor lingers in mouth. Lack of hoppy bitterness keeps it nice and wet in the mouth. Surprisingly light and bubbly for a darker beer. Good with a hearty steak and potato dinner. Also, pour a big head because this foam is delicious."
"I gotta say this one's a pleasant surprise...I'll be looking to have this one a bit more once the weather cools."
"O - Ive had this one before a long time ago. I don't remember it being this good. Maybe they changed the recipe. This might be one of my go to beers from now on. Really enjoyed this."
"Pours a dark cola like color which shows no light except around the edges when held up to lightm. The was a skim off white head which left a little lace on the glass. The aroma was of roasted malts and chocolate. The taste follows the nose big toasted malt backbone with chocolate and coffee coming in in the middle. The mouthfeel was well it wacarbonated. Overall I thought it was closer to a porter. It was a decent beer but not a favorite for the style."
"O- One of my favorite beers. Great taste and beautiful style. One of my go-to beers"
"I prefer a slightly sweeter, spicier blend with more hops; this left me with the impression of one-dimensionality, although it did have a palatable flavor which would blend well with most foods."
"Overall Drinkability - Had this beer before a while back and remember not liking it at all. It's much better this time. Since I've never had another Belgian Dark Ale, I'm just going to rate it as a beer in general, with belgian strong dark ales like Chimay Blue as a partial reference point."
"New Belgium 1554. My introduction to Belgian beers was a Leffe Brune in Brussels, and the introduction was habit forming. Amazing what those Belgian monks can do. Stateside, to recreate the Belgian experience, the New Belgium Abbey Ale comes close. The New Belgium 1554 is a different animal. It has the prerequisite off white head, fabulous aroma and deep black color. I actually like the 1554 a bit better in the flavor department. It’s not quite so honey sweet, has good complexity and even a touch of bitter. You may not like it better than your favorite Belgian dark ale, but it is unique enough to mix it into the rotation for some variety."
"O: A very good beer. On tap in a lot of places in Denver, I enjoy this brew a lot when I'm visiting the Mile High."
"Overall I enjoyed it not really knowing what to expect but was a good beer...Cheers"
"Fun and spunky, warm and comforting, this beer is excellent for many occasions. Drink it with friends. Enjoy it at home. Hoppy trails!"
"Overall this is a winner and worthy of a try. The 12er had this one, trippel, 2 below, a winter ale, and fat tire. 14 bucks for the 12."
"Best way to describe the flavor is roast malt with a hint of chocolate. It's got robust flavor without being too heavy. Perfect beer for winding down in the evening. I enjoy having a small piece of dark chocolate with it."
"A very good dark ale. Not to heavy and not too light."
"Pours dark with a little head that dissipated quickly with a little lacing. Nice well balanced beer with light chocolate and toffee flavor. A little more mild than I expected but overall quite drinkable and a pretty good/lighter dark beer, with 5.6% ABV a good beer to have a couple of without being overpoweringly alcoholic."
"O: An okay beer. Not really that exciting but is a good 6 pack if you like darker beers."
"O: A nice brew; pretty tasty, yet lower abv which is nice; glad I finally got around to trying this one."
"This is a very drinkable beer and really quite nice. Well rounded and a flavor that would appeal to newbies that are ready to venture on to the darker dark beers. It has a mass appeal about it. Hard to pin down anything wrong with it but also difficult to nail down what is right with it. I use to really like this beer more than I do now. No thanks to BA and my developing palate. These days I find it too sweet for my taste and not refined or complex enough for my liking. I wouldn't turn one down if someone offered me one. But would like to try this on tap if I could find it. 1554 is not bad but not great. It's a good all around sturdy brew for beginning dark beer drinkers. If this beer where around in 1554 I think it would of blown the burlap sacks off people. Today, though not so much as too flutter an occasional dress. It's still my favorite New Belgium brew that I've have tasted thus far."
"CHEERS"
"O: Not a bad beer, just nothing like I expecting."
"O: tremendous effort here and one to drink any time of year. Great tasting, not filling and a joy to drink."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. It drinks almost as a lighter, slightly sweeter porter."
"Pours with a lacy white head. Clear, rich mahogany color. Aroma is mainly roasted malt and molasses, not overpowering. Taste is rich, roasted, and caramelly, with a lingering sweetness and alcoholic warmth (although only 5.6% abv). Creamy mouthfeel, slight bitterness on finish. Medium carbonation. A well-balanced ale, somewhat like a lighter-bodied Baltic porter."
"Overall an excellent beer, with a complexity of flavors you don't always get in a lower gravity brew. This is one of my favorite go-to beers from New Belgium."
"Pours a deep amber to black color with a small off white head. In the aroma, caramel and chocolate. In the taste, dark chocolate, caramel, and a small grapefruity hop presence. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry hop and hint of chocolate in the aftertaste. Like a thin porter or a lighter version of a black IPA."
"Overall-Definitely a beer I'd get again. Nice flavors, easy to drink, and won't break the bank."
"O-Very good beer with great balance and drink ability. You can knock back a couple of these and feel great. Very solid"
"O - I'm not sure what style to really classify this beer as. While the recipe might be from 1554, the brewing practices of the day would probably have produced a beer with a little more interesting yeast character (take this for what you will). In this context, I think it is somewhat of a dissappointment for authenticity's sake. However, it is a tasty sessionable beer akin to a slightly estery schwarzbier. I do know that this is a big 'gateway' beer for some and that's not a bad thing. But, to my taste, not a drainpour by far, but not enough to order another or go out of the way (not that it isn't ubiquitous already)."
"Nice taste, a bit of chocolate and coffee but nothing overwhelming. I love this style from a local belgium style pub, and this doesn't quite compare, but a nice beer if looking for dark beer, without the robust characteristics of porter/stout."
"I feel like some black ales are misleading. Something so dark would appear to be full of flavor, but color is not always indicative of quality. The best thing about this beer is its texture but it could use something else. A higher ABV, some chocolate, I don’t know, something."
"O: Good beer, but unlike other black ales I've tried. Worthwhile and quite drinkable, but probably not something I'd go for again."
"Nice amount of carbonation, overall a really solid beer. Not a textbook example of the style, but a very nice version I will definitely get again."
"This beer pours a light to medium in body, a dark, dark chestnut brown in color with ruby highlights and a one finger beige colored creamy head. It smells of lightly roasted dark malts with a light slightly bitter chocolate aroma. I don't get where people are saying that they get any yeast from this. I think this smells more like a porter. The flavors are of slight dark chocolate with a light roastiness and a creamy finish. It has the mouthfeel of french press coffee and cream. It's very flavorful but again, I say this tastes more like a porter. I poured this aggressively so it initially had a pretty large head. I think this sucked some of the carbonation out of it but it made the beer very creamy and soft and exceptionally smooth. Overall I like this beer. Is it a good interpretation of the style? It's debatable. I think this drinks more like a porter than a Belgian dark ale but that's fine with me."
"Overall this was a very nice beer, though I don't think I will revisit it until late Fall or winter."
"Drinkability: It's a fairly hearty beer, with a very fall/winter style. I like this and would drink it again, but probably during the cooler months. A very good Belgian style black ale."
"D/O- More akin to a brown ale then a Belgian in my opinion, I enjoyed this one. Easy drinking but flavorful, I'd take multiples of this in one sitting if I wasn't so hellbent to get my taste buds on something new...I'm a beer whore."
"O (D) - an OK beer, don't think it's a great belgian. Nice warming on the finish."
"Good beer, very well done."
"O: A good beer worth having around, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Eliminating some of the watered down flavor would make this an exceptional beer."
"new belgium makes a lot of good beers but it doesnt seem like they make anything bold or strong"
"Bottle. Poured dark brown with tall still head. Nutty aroma with a hint of apple spices and cloves. Sweet bready taste. Slight bitterness keeps it light tasting. Medium dry finish. Light body and texture. Med/low carbonation. An enjoyable and different brown ale."
"M- Creamy and light at the same time."
"Transferred a sixer of the 1554 to some diet pepsi plastic bottles to smuggle into a ball game. The dark cola color of the 1554 perfectly matched the displaced soda, though the bubbles were slightly off white. Upon pouring into a plastic cup I was greeted with a small, bone colored head that did not linger too long. Aromas were of roasted malts, a touch of dried fruit, perhaps some brown sugar. Very smooth beer with an easy mouthfeel and a medium body overall. Minimal bitterness with predominantly roasted malt flavor. I would say good, but not a great beer. Great for stadium smuggling in cola bottles, though."
"Overall this was a very nice good drinking dark ale."
"D- Easy to drink beer. Could have a couple of these easily. Good flavors, wish some were more prominent though. Still good beer."
"Overall, this one drinks nice and easy."
"D - Quality and easy drink; unique roasted and burnt flavors; give it a try, you wont be terribly disappointed"
"Something I find interesting about 1554 is that I find it hard to compare to anything else. It's quite odd for a Belgian Dark Ale, but it's definitely not an American stout or porter. It's just good, simply put."
"OD: A really good drinker and overall it really works."
"12 oz into a snifter...great appearance, really a knock out. Big head that retains well on top of a deep black body. I dig it. Smell doesn't impress me that much. Decent malt but not that complex. Good notes of dark malt. Decent balance. No significant yeast character, which is one thing I always expect if a beer is going to have the balls to call itself a ""Belgian style"" beer. Tastes similar on the tongue to the nose. Doesn't really break any new ground. Clean though with a good malt profile. Mouthfeel is fine, nothing objectionable. Overall, this is a good beer, but I can imagine it being so much better that it's not that impressive. I guess it's ok as far as value."
"Overall, pretty good but nothing great."
"o - Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer, heavy on the roasted malts. Some nice chocolate too, a beer I would have again."
"The beer pours a black color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the roasted malt and chocolate. An extremely malty beer that smells like a stout. The flavor is a mix of chocolate, ash, roasted malt, coffee and cream. A great mix of flavors that all meld very well together. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice Belgian-style stout. One of the better year-round New Belgium beers."
"This one is a solid beer. Pretty simple, but it adds a dimension not found in a lot of American-made dark malt beers."
"The one thing that I didn't like here was the overall mouthfeel wasn't much. Although it was a nice smooth beer, I would have liked a little more something going on when you take the intial drink."
"O - Great Beer, unique taste, I would but again."
"Poured out of a 12-ounce bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. Dark brown/light black color, that is transluscent. 2 Fingers of head or so, with nice lacing and a aroma ofdark dried fruit, with the hint of the bready Belgian yeast. Taste is what is expected a dark candy flavor, malty with no real hop bitterness. Overall a good beer for first time drinkers of a dark Belgian ale."
"Overall solid."
"O - A good beer, but nothing more. While many interesting flavors were present in this beer, they were very subdued. Nothing stood out to separate this beer from the pack. Although, I wouldn't turn this beer down by any means, I wouldn't seek it out either."
"O – Overall, this is an OK beer. The aftertaste is a bit much. It’s pleasant enough, and I wouldn’t turn one down, but I won’t be stocking it in my fridge, either."
"D: Just ok, I'm not thrilled with this offering or really this style. Not a great session beer in my opinion, but worth trying."
"It goes well with most foods and it's one of those beers that you just don't get tired of. I wish it were easier to find and maybe a few local bars could start stocking this one."
"A good beer. It's not one I'd necessarily seek out, but wouldn't mind having again."
"If you see this beer give it a try, it's good beer."
"A pleasant, flavorful, malty, and earthy brown ale. I wouldn't want to drink a lot of this, but it's interesting enough and is certainly an accessible craft brew."
"Drinkability - This beer is very easy to drink. A bit tame in characteristics. Everything seems to be balanced well, but it's just too laid back. Very quaffable and sessionable. It's not horrible and would be fine for a change of pace. I could have several of these at one time with relative ease."
"My first beer from New Belgium in Fort Collins, CO...and my first beer enjoyed right here in Colorado - I have never had a beer so smooth and so creamy. The whole beer is so delicate and light on the mouth...big tan head that lingers and lingers and lingers. There are hints of chocolate, fig, roasted malts with a bready finish...loses a half a star for a lasting aftertaste - BUT I'm in a hotel and drinking it out of a paper cup, not the way god intended. This beer is like silk!"
"Another good offering from New Belgium - not fantastic but a solid effort. This is my first ""Belgian Dark Ale"" so I don't know how it compares to others. It tasted a lot like a light porter."
"D: High, but the sweetness might make some a little sick after the third or fourth."
"O - Decent dark ale, though not as strong as Id expect from a beer of this type dark. Mediocre overall taste and bland finish don't help this beer, but it's a nice mellow dark when you don't want a big stout or a Belgian strong dark."
"D: Could and did drink another one. It's possible the fact that it was consumed after a 12 hour car ride made it taste better, but I still think I would drink it again."
" This beer is one of my favorites from NB, supremely drinkable, the flavors are rather mild compared to a porter or other dark beers but it's drawn out, balanced and full throughout the entire experience."
"D: Not great for only 5.6% ABV. Dry coffee is a little much, needs something to balance it out."
"Overall a very tasty brew, great for sitting around a fire on a cold night or having with dessert after dinner."
"Overall, it was a delicious beer that had good undertones through my pleasurable 12 oz of this 1554 Black Ale. Its one that I can drink a few in a sitting and not get tired of it. I recommend it for people with acquired taste and understand the marvels of Black Ales."
"Well, wow. Been drinking this for years, never really stopped to analyze it. Good beer. Nice balance between complexity and drinkability. This is the kind of beer where you want to keep a six on hand, just in case. Fine stuff."
"there is just not much there in this beer. it reminds me why I don't drink new belgium beers very often. the highlight of this beer is its smoothness for how dark it is but overall it is not interesting. this is a beer for someone who wants to pretend they are drinking a good beer but don't actually like beer."
"D-This is the 1st black ale ive had. Will give a few more black ales a try but it wasn't my favorite style. Definatly drinkable but the flavor just wasnt there for me"
"M & D - dry but a tinge of sweetness there. Slightly creamy. The low ABV and the lack of too much sweetness with the chocolate make for an easy, drinkable beer. Interesting."
"Dr: For the price and 5.6% ABV, it's alright. Don't expect anything incredible. It won't lift your kilt up, anyway."
"Pretty drinkable beer. It grew on me as I made my way through the glass. Not too bad at all."
"Like a mellow porter, pretty light body and dialed down flavors."
"D - The taste is the highlight, which is the most important thing. No off characters, nice balanced brew."
"D-I could have a few of these with dinner perhaps, but I wouldnt get them for a night of boozing."
"Quality beer, but nothing really special. This tastes like what I expected a dark beer from New Belgium would taste. Faint Belgian yeast taste in the background of a drinkable brown ale. Hints of wood, cinnamon, and fig. Smell is a little off out of the bottle - a bit glassy, but the mouthfeel and drinkability are high. I would file this one under a pleasing go-to beer. wouldn't bring it to a tasting, but I'd be happy with it most anytime I wanted to relax with a medium-bodied ale."
"D- This is a solid beer, reminds me of Turbodog. I don't know if there is anything about it that stands out other than its very smooth and very good overall."
"T: Everything about this beer is really delicate and it was pretty hard to pick out individual elements in the taste. I could definitely detect a lot of bready malts along with yeast, a bit of dark chocolate and some smoke as the beer warmed a bit. The mouthfeel was really light, but I think that helped more than hurt the flavors of the beer. It's not a bad beer, but probably not one I would rush out to pick up again."
"It's not really my type of thing, but I can appreciate the effort it took to make a beer like this. It's lighter and less tasty than a schwarzbier and far lighter than a porter, but it is related to those two in a couple of ways. It will appeal to a lot of people I think. It's definitely worth a try."
"This is a great beer. I will definitely seek this out again."
"D: This one is one my favorites from New Belgium. I can typically drink quite a few of these with no problem. Nice flavor, great price, and light mouthfeel make this one extremely drinkable. Don't get me wrong, not the most amazing beer I've had, but highly drinkable."
"Chocolate and light roast in the nose, absent mocha, however, with some light grass and pale malts coming in under the intense nuts. Sweetish with a touch of caramel and a slighter hint of smoke. Near-pitch ruby with a creamy, superbly rocky and lasting tan head. Watery body is very creamy, very sweet with medium carbonation. A little stale nuttiness, hints of berry and perhaps star anise, mostly malty under the earthy chocolate. Touch of acidity. Light caramel, some crushed almondy shells and faint cherries, and man, the nuts are all over this thing. Little minty/herbal swipe."
"I would not recommend this beer and I will not buy it again."
"Pours a deep, dark mahogany with a slightly tanned head. Head is about a finger high with average retention and some nice lacing as it goes. Nose is mostly roasty malts with some coffee notes. Taste is roasty malt again with some chocolate and fruit notes to round things out. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I expected; however, I think this speaks more to the impressive appearance than any deficit in mouthfeel. Drinkability is high, again not as cloying, sticky, or boozey as you would expect just looking at this."
"I love how this beer combines drinkability with bold taste. It's always a great surprise to find a dark beer that is drinkable and not over powering. There is a smoothness to 1554 and a rich chocolaty finish. 1554 is another dark beer I'll put on my list for a cold evening. Perfect beer for a little football with some brats off the grill."
"Overall I really enjoyed this offering as this was my first Belgium Dark Ale. Great for the dark beer lover and I would definitly recommend it."
"D) A nice brew. I'd definitely have another."
"Pours a dark brown-deep red color, just a bit darker yet very similar to the Moose Drool I just drank. This ""Black Ale"" is not black. Smell is a bit yeasty and malty. Also, hints of spice and fig. First sip is highly carbonated, dark malt flavors...but its almost like a dirty tar taste...in a good way? As it warms, the residual sweetness finishes with a bitter tang that doesn't leave the best after taste. I suppose this is a decently drinkable beer but I'm not sure if I would consider drinking another."
"D: if i didnt want to just sit and enjoy the flavors id drink it alot quicker. a well rounded beer, worth trying again for sure."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall it is well balanced and quite drinkable. For less than 6% abv this brew has a slight warming effect to it which is unexpected and welcomed. Overall this was an enjoyable experience however the lingering mustiness of this brew did not pair well with the other flavorings that were included. Still worth giving a try if you get a chance."
"D: I am a big fan of New Belgium's ""Trippel"" and ""Abbey"" beers. I was very disappointed by this beer. It reminded me of a tarted up ""Fat Tire."""
"D: A solid black ale. Not too heavy, not too light. Great for those nights when you're not in the mood for an RIS but still want something dark."
"Overly a decent beer."
"Poured into my New Belgium globe. Has a black color but light compared to stouts. A fizzy head. The aroma has a light smell, but some coco and coffee notes. Some aromatic notes and a light licorice/rosy nose. The taste is better with more bready and coco notes. Some roast notes. A bit more malty as it warms. Easy drinking nice finish."
"Doesn't particularly stand out in anyway but it's good, I like it, and I'm going to drink it."
"D--It's not a heavy beer. At 5.6%, it's pretty drinkable to begin with. Throw in the fact that it's a very likable beer, I could see me drinking a few of these a night."
"D: Very drinkable for the type of beer it is, would definitely enjoy this one again especially for the price."
"D: No alcohol warming so I guess you could drink several. Generally one black beer is enough for me."
"D- Very drinkable. Good with rich desserts."
"At the first sip all I could think was...SMOOTH...and then the nice chocolate malt kicked in. A VERY nice drinkable blacl lager that looks as dark as a robust porter but without the overwhelming burnt/roast aroma and taste.This beer is a party in a six pack for the discriminating drinker. I'd love to try in on tap."
"(81st)"
"Drinkability: This is my favorite New Belgium brews. Some small things need to be modified to enhance the drinking experience, though. New Belgium might want to consider bottle conditioning for this beer to enhance it's head and maybe adding more malt to 1554 more mouthfeel. Overall, not a bad beer."
"Dabbling this beer at my desk in Santa cruz California the first this I notice is the sweetness I wouldn't normally expect from a dark ale (not quite as sweet as guinness but something comperable). I really enjoy this beer. The flavors are a little watered but this makes for an extremely drinkable beer and at 5.60 ABV it's an easy going drinking beer or could easily complement a marinara sauce or sausage though this is definately an ale taste. I'm peeved when a dark ale or stout beer is too bitter and not malty enough. This beer has exceeded my expectations."
"The body is moderate. Some hints of astringency but no where near what should be with this dark of a beer. Some lingering yeasty notes but overall very clean. Good beer."
"Mouthfeel is thick and heavy. It feels like you're drinking a beer much stronger than it is. Not sure if that's good or bad, but it feels more filling than it really is."
"Pitch black with a slight amber hue that shines through lightly. Nice looking white head that recedes to a minimal covering and manages to leave some decent lacing. Some roasted malt in the nose with some slight sweetness as well. Bakers chocolate and roasted malt come through in the taste, along with a peculiar nuttiness that seems common in new belgium's ales, followed by a slight hoppy bitterness that quickly retreats. Mouthfeel is a bit watered down,carbonation is on the low end, while the beer itself is extremely smooth, creamy, and refreshing."
"As drinkable as this is, I'm happy that Belgian ales evolved since the age of Spanish rule in Flanders."
"D: The beer is very drinkable because it has a low amount of alcohol and isn't filling at all."
"D - This is definitely a session beer but with some class. You can down plenty of these and feel better than the rest of the crowd, who might be drinking down PBR."
"While I wouldn't necessarily want to knock back a bunch of these, it is a tasty brew, and I definitely enjoyed it."
"D-Very easy drinking, but not especially impressive and not like any Belgian I've had. Seemed more like an altbier, bock, or schwarzbier (although I'm certain lager yeast was not used) than a Belgian."
"Poured into a mug. Gorgeous black beer with over an inch high head that lingers. Lots of creamy sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is malty and toasty with hints of coffee and chocolate. Taste is wonderful! Roasted malt with coffee accents, and just a touch of chocolate...not too much. Very drinkable beer. Not heavy and chewy like a stout. Surprisingly light for such a dark beer. You could enjoy several of these easily. If you like a stout, especially a chocolate or cream, you have got to try this. It is similar, but without the heaviness. Definitely recommend!"
"Overall this is an OK beer. I'm glad I've tried it, but I'm sure there are better beers in this category out there. I'd buy it again, but not before trying others. Great Beer New Belgium Brewing!!!!"
"D: Great. I forgot how mush I like 1554. I am not a huge fan on New Belgium products but this is a stand-out. Dark but way too drinkable. Still one of their best!"
"D: I have no desire to drink this beer again. I can, however, see why it appeals to a larger micro drinking market. Falls into the 'dark' beer category for many folks."
"D. There is nice drinkability here - I like this a lot more than Fat Tire. That said, it is nothing to get excited about either."
"O: A good stand by and a beer that serves a purpose, especially as the weather cools...as someone who prefers American stouts/porters, I can see the merit of this beer."
"Dark pour with foamy tan head, this smells like spicy roast malt with a touch of soap. I found the taste pleasant--sweet, fruity malt with some roast character and some cocoa at the end--but also curiously flat-tasting, although the carbonation is creamy and it's very drinkable. A nice beer but nothing extremely memorable."
"D: Quite drinkable, more than one might expect. It goes down rather well. There is some lingering taste, but it's light enough for multiple. Certainly one of New Belgium's better brews, in my eyes."
"Pours dark brown, very little head that dissipates quickly. Nice smell, slightly hoppy with some caramel smell. Tastes pretty darn good, nice and malty, can't taste any hops. Really smooth, no bite with appropriate levels of carbonation. Totally drinkable, a little pricey for what you get, but it's the first black ale I've ever had so I think it's pretty good."
"12oz bottle at Shellfish in Port Lavaca, TX. Pours dark brown with a thin, short lasting tanned head. Aroma is light of brown sugar, dark fruits and some nuts. Medium body with dark fruit and espresso coffee fill the mouth. Finish is medium. Taste like a good porter to me."
"I figured this was worth a return visit after a few years. It pours a clear garnet-brown topped by a finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises figs, brown sugar, nutmeg, Belgian yeast, and rye bread. The taste brings more of the same, along with an underlying flavor of cocoa. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly grainy feel. Overall, a nice little Belgian Dark, a decent inexpensive alternative to more impressive and involved Belgians."
"I'm struggling with why this is called a Belgian Dark Ale - reminds me more of a stout, but whatever you want to call it I find it tasty."
"Not what I would consider a classic example of the style, but an enjoyable beer, nonetheless. Poured a dark chestnut. Some moderate caramel and brown sugar sweetness, that went a bit dry with creeping astringency. Finish was a distinctive unsweetened cocoa powder note that was quite interesting."
"First of all, I am convinced that all New Belgium Brewery's beers have a ""tastes like sticks"" taste. I believe it is commonly referred to as...earthy. To continue my rant, I think this beer actually has a campfire taste. I suppose I appreciated the smoky aspect for something different. Half way through I had a buckeye (chocolate and peanut butter candy), which was a nice compliment. It poured black with one finger of head. It smelled and tasted like chocolate, coffee, caramel and smoke. It was a little sweeter than I typically prefer, so I don't know if I would drink more than one of these in a row. I only bought two of these in a mix-six, but I can see myself buying a six pack of these in the future."
"D: Pretty good drinkability. Its not quite a 4 for me, there is something about it where I can't have multiples, but one is pretty tasty and goes down well. It just seems like something is missing."
"Revisited 8-25-11. Ratings unchanged. Remains a good value and a very tasty beer. One of NB's better regular offerings."
"Easy to drink. Felt like a lite-porter. chocolate stands out, the hops and carbonation give it a decent balance."
"Overall, nothing special, but worth a try."
"1554 is black with mahogany highlights and sports a khaki head. Malty aroma from this dark beer is no surprise, but there's also chocolate, caramel, cocoa and it's a touch vinous. Full bodied mouthfeel that's pretty smooth with carbonation along the edges. The taste has a delicious chocolate maltiness to it along with hints of tobacco. Hops are pretty light. I really enjoyed this and can't wait to try it again with food. It would make a great dinner beer."
"D- Very drinkable. Light but full of flavor."
"This deep, dark black ale is supposedly based on a 500 year old Belgian recipe, and it's an unusual and tasty ale that doesn't easily fit into a category. I get a roasty chocolate scent, which gives way to a burnt chocolate palate -- not as spicy as a traditional Belgian abbey ale, and more akin to a softer, gentler stout. It's not snappy or hoppy, but subtle, smooth, and quite tasty. This one's a delightful brew with a unique personality."
"1554 is medium-bodied and has a crisp taste and feel. It's more of a lager so not heavy. It has decent drinkability."
"A light brown, one finger head of thick bubbles came from the pour. Nice lacing on the glass that has good cling. Color is a 33 on the SRM chart. Smells of banana, chocolate, dark coffee, malt, and prunes. Tastes are Black coffee, dark chocolate, black licorice, hint of hops and malt. Good zing in the mouth. Delightful taste that is well balanced and good for another round."
"All in all a pretty good beer. Probably not one I would seek or purchase regularly, but one I would gladly accept if offered by a friend."
"D- A nice dark ale for a winter evening."
"I've been drinking this regularly since it showed up in the grocery store. The flavor is a bit less complex than I'd hoped for, but quite drinkable."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. If you like sparkling water and dark session beers, then this one would be a great one to try. For me it's nothing special, just a good easy drinker."
"D Very drinkable and similar to a stout. 4 "
"D- Very very drinkable, must say this beer surprised me cause I didn't enjoy Fat Tire hardly at all. I think the 1554 might be a beer I start going to get at the local Kroger due to price and over all taste! Will continue to drink over and over!"
"Nice lacing down the bottle. The balance is about perfect, no unexpected, unwelcomed flavors to speak of. This is a very easy drinking beer, will recommend to some of my Stout and Porter drinker friends."
"Pours a deep dark brown with an off white head that has some pretty good retention. The nose brings forward some light chocolate and dark fruits. The taste is slightly roasty with some dates, plum, and chocolate. Good mouthfeel with nice carbonation levels. Drinks nice and easy."
"D- I enjoyed drinking this one. Makes a very good dinner beer, might even consider this a porter. Will have to sample this one again."
"D- really enjoyed drinking this one. Will drink this one again."
"Not so black as so much deep mohogany. Very clear, tight bubbles, and whispy of white head. Holy roasted malts batman! Roasted notes assault the nose with some herbal hops. Very toasty, bready and sweet. Very tangy and it has a citrusy note. Mouthfeel is light and not too drying. I could have a few but it is for taste only."
"Yeah yeah roast me for not leaving the classic review. If you need the classic review on this beer please read on to the other 900+ reviews."
"good drinkability, I would seek this out again. Not sure about the classification on this beer, I thought kinda of a cross between brown ale and porter. tasty none the less"
"Drink is high, this is something I give to friends whos craft beer of choice is fat tire. Its my thought that this is the bridge to porters/stouts."
"22 oz. bottle, brewed with a light lager yeast, as per the website. Pours quite near black, with lightish carbonation, a half-inch tan head and nice lacing. Smells chocolatey and roasty with a faint note of hops. Pretty much the same on the palate, but with a light earthiness and some green noble hops that emerge as it warms. Light and smooth, with a dry finish. I thought this was rather more like a porter than a Belgian ale, but then again, they aren't aiming for a modern-day Belgian anyway. I judged this one as a porter and found it to be a very pleasing ale."
"New Belgium 1554 is something of an odd brew. It strikes me as a cross between a porter & Scottish ale with notions of a barleywine. Not bad but their other beers I've tried have impressed me more."
"D: Ok. I'm not all that impressed, the flavors are very subdued and muddled, you could tell me this was a (poor) attempt at smoked porter or a coffee stout and I would believe you. Aside from the funk in the nose and the faintest hint of it in the taste, it's hard to tell that there is anything recognizably Belgian in there."
"T - balanced flavor but with no strong flavor elements. Does finish strong."
"D: Nice and smooth sailing for the Dark Ale lover..."
"Easy to drink, easy to swallow. Wouldnt be a problem drinking more than one in an evening."
"D-I can't see myself drinking more than one of these.There's just nothing there."
"The smell reminded me of spent coffee grounds. The taste was similar to the aroma but on the thin side. It had an earthy coffee quality mixed with a slight pale aftertaste. Overall, I think the taste did not live up to its aroma. It was good and I'll probably still drink this at bars as an alternative to the other overly mainstream beers."
"1554 pours a very dark brown, just a little short of being able to be called black. Plenty of ruby highlights when I hold it up to light. A vigorous pour yields a decent (but not spectacular) beige head. Lacing and retention are serviceable but not noteworthy The nose is pungent of plum, with just a hint of roast/chocolate, pretty intriguing. The taste is just that, but a little bit better. Dark fruit and dark chocolate make a beautiful combination (though it's mostly the former and just a hint of the latter. The roasted character is just barely present, and adds something to the beer, and I'm glad that they managed to keep any coffee notes from creeping in. Strike that, as some coffee starts to come through a little bit once the beer warms. Body is impressively rich for a beer of just 5.6%, but the carbonation is a bit lacking. Overall a solid and unique effort from New Belgium, a pleasure to have in my glass."
"jd"
"Drinkability is good. I drank the whole Vegas bottle on vacation at a VA state park cabin. Watching the rain from a dry spot in the woods with a big glass of this beer....very nice!!! This is a staple type of beer to enjoy without getting wasted."
"Drinkability - average, nothing too special about this beverage, probably won't revisit but I'm glad I tried it"
"Love the 1554 as an every occasion dark beer."
"D: Not too great. One and done for sure."
"I want to be a fisherman in a colonial N.C. coastal town, and have an old salty tavern by the docks that serves this beer as the house draft amidst the smell of wood, old ropes, and crab traps."
"Big flavor and goes down easy."
"D = I'm not a huge fan of dark beers, but this pretty drinkable. I'm always impressed with New Belgium. I expected 1554 to be similar to Guinness, but was pleasantly different. Much less bitter, much smoother going down."
"Its a little ashy. Medium body, creamy body. Its just OK. A perfectly fine Belgian stout. Not sweet up front no bitterness. Mild coffee."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Best before date is October 24th. Pours dark brown with a half inch of light brown head that quickly dissipates. Minimal lacing. Interesting rich malt aroma. Chocolate and toffee with just a hint of coffee. Medium body and low carbonation. Seems a bit heavy for only 5.6% abv but the finish is clean enough to still make it easy to drink. Very smooth texture. The malt lacks some personality on the palate though. A little bit of coffee flavor comes through but other than that its just medium roasted malt taste. I would much rather this were a little lighter. It might make a good session beer then."
"D: Complex enough and quite drinkable as well given its mouthfeel and cleanliness. The 5.6% ABV is a plus as well for those looking to turn the complex enlightenment into a session. A nice beer to sip on a cool, late-summer evening."
"a very good beer. Nice beer with a little extra head to it, but that isn't bad at all. Taste of hops is wonderful, but at the very end a tad bitter. Smells crisp. Drinkability is good, but after a couple one will probably get tired of it. I do recommend this beer to the average beer drinker"
"The body is medium, smooth and slick. Taste wise it leans on the sweet side, and has a vanilla plus sassafras, and leans towards the bready sweetness found in the aroma."
"On tap at the brewery, a few weeks back. It seems the brewery has changed its policy regarding samples, and now gives out a few tokens to each adult. Used one of them for this beer, which I like. Poured a nice dark brown, nearly black, with a decent head. Nice roasted malt character, with a hint of coffee, a little chocolate and some light bitterness. Very porter-like, and very drinkable."
"So bottom line. Good beer. Just not complex at all for tasting."
"Can't say I loved it, but the cocoa presence helped boost it a bit -- wish there was even more. The typical Belgian dark mix of dark fruits, baking spices, & booze is not one I'm super-fond of, but it wasn't played up too highly here. Not bad, but I don't think I'd rush to have another."
"M/D: It is thicker than expected and very creamy. A pretty tasty brew that I would drink again, probably 1-2 max per night though."
"D: Quite drinkable for the style. Tasty, easy on the stomach, fairly light. I wouldn't go as far as calling it sessionable, but it is very enjoyable and a great example of the style. Another great one from New Belgium!"
"Cheers!"
"Was dark, not black, I guess that's what they meant by ""enlightened"" Smell was good sweet with chocolate of course little coffee and some kinda fruit, which was back seat for sure. Taste was awesome, and was very easy to drink. Will go here again for sure. getting to like this stye"
"Oh boy, I could certainly imagine knocking back a few of these in a dark pub four and a half centuries ago... or right now."
"D - Nice session Belgian. Great carbonation. Very nice beer."
"D - Some unique flavours, but a little too bitter and sour for my liking. Wouldn't drink a ton of these, but I wouldn't turn it down."
"Overall this is in my opinion the best drinkable beer that New Belgium has put out thus far. It's a beautiful thing."
"Finally got to try some New Belgiums while on vacation. Really enjoyed the 1554. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is very very dark brown, practically black except when backlit. Nice aroma, more nutty in both smell and taste than I was expecting. Malt dominant with some nice chocolate and coffee undertones. The nuttiness is present throughout and adds alot. Really enjoyed the alcohol level as I was able to session a few during the evening with no effect. Good mouthfeel helped it go down smooth. Wish I could get this on a regular basis."
"Easy drinking, tasty but lacking a bit of depth."
"D: I like this one, so does the girlfriend. That's high praise, since she's a finicky b****."
"Final Notes: An excellent choice for a session beer, or to pair with food or even a dessert. This beer has so many potential uses, a great ""utility beer."""
"D- will not go down very well if consumed too quickly, but at the right serving conditions, it is an excellent offering"
"This is an okay beer. It's not great, it's not terrible, just well made and drinkable. The beer is a little bland for a brewery that makes interesting beers. The malt dominants the beer with German-style Munich malt breadiness being the predominant flavor. Hops are there just for bittering. There is a bit of belgian character, but overall it's lacking the complexity and interest I would have liked."
"Dark color, deep brown bordering on solid black with a slight head. Slight estery smell, probably the yeast, and a dark malr aroma dominate. The taste is malt dominated, with chocolate, smoky, and bready malts all combining into a rather delicious malt base. No hop bitterness to be found. The only flavor that combats the malt is the interesting yeast flavors of the beer. Moderate carbonation with a dry nutty finish. Very drinkable NB brew, maybe not as complex as their other Belgium-style beers (the Dubbel and trippel), but a very good and sessionable beer."
"I found that this beer reminded me a little of Stone's Smoked Porter. It started with a really nice 1.5in head (poured in a Pint Glass). The aromatics were very woodsy with a hint of chocolate undertone. The first sip (the beer came straight out of the fridge and it was approximately 38*) was very nutty with a chocolate underlay. As the beer warmed up (it was approximately 50* when I finished) the chocolate underlay became more prevalent. New Belgium recommended that the beer be served at 45* in a snifner style beer glass. I can definately understand why. The temperature and the difference in glass ware will make a huge aromatic and taste difference."
"This is an American version of a Belgian dark ale. While it is not bad, it pales in comparison to true Belgian dark ales. The ABV is pretty low for a Belgian (5.5%) and is relatively average. There is nothing to distinguish or differentiate this beer from the others in its category."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Medium bodied and chewy. Modest carbonation makes it easy to down this one."
"And, since dark, drinkable lagers are few and far between in the states, the 1554 is a god-send to someone like me, who loves the style but who has been forced to drink stale Spaten dunkels. Now I can can get a fresh dark lager that has a low enough ABV to enjoy over an evening. Yippee!!! :)"
"d. very easy to drink, gives just enough flavor to be intriguing but is not overbearing or over powering. Could drink several pints if needed too....hah, if needed."
"D- this one is a little different. almost like a light belgian stout. very drinkable with an almost sessionable ABV. i liked this one more than i expected to."
"D: Love love love. If one is good and two is better, 20 ought to do."
"At the Flying Saucer in Memphis, TN. Into a pint glass, it poured a dark cloudy brown, with one finger of beige, decent retention, and very good lacing. Lots of biscuit, caramel, and roasted malt in the nose as well as the flavor. Crisp on the palate with a nutty finish and aftertaste. Thick and modestly carbonated. Definitely a sipping beer."
"Had this beer from a 22oz bottle poured into a pint-style glass just yesterday. My notes on it are as follows: A-poured w/ a scarce head that dissipated quickly. The color is exceptionally dark, but not completely black. It has some reddish highlights on the edges and bottom. S-a pronounced, dark malt smell that reminds me of chocolate malt or maybe black patent malt. T-is very true to the smell. The taste is dark chocolate that is rounded out nicely by the bitterness. I can't place the hops, though. Overall this is a really good beer. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I will be trying this one again."
"Great offering from New Belgium Brewery."
"Serving type: On-Tap"
"Poured a dark brown to black color with a nice ywo finger head; minimal lacing down the glass. Smelled slightly sweet, roasted malt. Taste was very smooth, not as sweet or as roasted as the smell hinted, but a nice porter-like flaovor. Mouthfeel was good, and drinkability is high."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, for the appearance of the body. Sweet, caramel notes make for a pleasant drinking experience."
"Pours a very nice dark brown with a pretty good sized head. Nice lacing on the surface and glass. Smell is mild roasted malt. Not overly sweet. Toasty. Some chocolate notes in the finish. Medium bodied. Finishes dry. Quaffable. Overall a nice light(er) pseudo-belgian."
"D: Very drinkable as the flavors are all there and all blend well together and the lower abv helps as well."
"This is overall a very well-rounded beer. A complex richness compressed and made thin, subtle. A lot of my friends don't care much for this brew, but I really enjoy it."
"I recommend."
"This is my first taste of anything from this company and I am impressed. Pouring a nice medium dark color it looked excellent in the glass with a fair amount of lacing. Chocolatey malt aroma and taste feels good in the mouth and going down. Low alcohol content screams "" Hey HAVE ANOTHER"" so I did. Very interesting ring just below neck of bottle."
"D - Very good dark ale that is easy to drink. It is not as heavy as I thought it might be."
"Not a bad beer, but lacking the complexity of a true Belgian ale. It does go down nice and easy, and the relatively low ABV means you don't have to be as careful with this one as some others."
"Highly drinkable and very pleasant, this was like a less complex version of Black Butte Porter (which ain't a bad thing!)."
"Okay, but not really my cup of tea (or glass of beer). Still very decent for a beer style that often struggles to impress."
"The palate opens with a moderate sweetness, quite caramel in nature. In some ways, it makes me think of a brown ale, with the caramel, toffee and cocoa very well balanced. Moderately spicy mid-palate, this beer dries off on the finish with a lingering toasted nut, caramel and spice character. Quite bready, the combination of spice and cocoa makes me think of pumpernickel bread (the American variant). Lightly fruity as well. The yeast character is light, and apart from the spice, I don't get much else. Medium light in body with a creamy carbonation, this beer is quite the pleasure on the palate.With a pleasant balance of flavors, this is a very enjoyable beer of this unseasonably cool summer evening. I'm not particularly enamored by Fat Tire, but this is one beer I wish we got here in DC."
"Light to medium bodied, moderately firm. I'm not a fan."
"D- For the price, bargain. and its not bad for a Belgium dark, there is could be room for a lot of improvement."
"Drinkability - Creamy and smooth like a hot chocolate. Very drinkable."
"This is actually one of my old go-to beers, due to its wide availability (in bottle, at least), sessionability, and complexity. On tap, it was different, maybe a hair better."
"Different and enjoyable, not sure I could have drank the whole bottle though."
"D: Its a good beer, well carbonated, for a darker beer (which i dont drink dark beer very often) its very easy to drink for one or two. but after a couple it gets harder to drink. drinking these all night would be tough. the malted flavor is a very nice taste, and makes its a good beer."
"Drinkable, yes I lost track it was so easy to drink. 1554 is not a heavy dark ale. Enjoy!"
"I'm not always in the mood for this type of Beer, but when I am, this stuff is unbelievably good."
"The mouth is firm. Some good carbonation backing, and a smooth finish. Nice. Nothing in the flavor really stands out. I don't notice anything that specifies this as Belgian in the flavor. It's got some semi-sweet toffee, light bitterness, and a mild finish. I rather enjoyed this one, but it was sort of bland in the process. Expected more from this, but I'd gladly have it again regardless."
"Drinkability 3.5: Could drink two or three of these socially, any more would probably be too filling"
"D: Cleaner than I was expecting. That makes sense though, given that the a lager yeast was used. It does seem to have some yeast character though, but not stereotypical Belgium yeast notes. More like lager yeast fermented on the warm side. Not really sure what style this is, but it is tasty, interesting, and drinkable. Esoteric, approachable, and sort of piques your interest. Kind of like that nerdy chick in the library. (How is that for being enlightened?)"
"Delicious malty goodness."
"Notes: I really liked this beer. I love dark bread and this beer has that quality. I'm not sure if this is a true Belgian Dark Ale, but it has good dark roasted notes while being light."
"This is an easy drinking black ale. It comes a touch closer to a big brown ale with bits of roast coming through in the aftertaste. Not quite a much ""belgian character"" as one would expect but this doesn't take away from the overall beer."
"Quite enjoyable, really."
"Overall I love this beer. I had only had it in the past on draft and it is much better like this than from a bottle, but still very good. Heavy taste with a light feel is what I like about it most."
"I will say that Belgium beers are not my favorite style, but I like this one for sure. I was just at the brewery last month and wished I would have reviewed this beer fresh on draft. Good brewery, great beer, but nothing outstanding. This will be a great session beer when fall comes around."
"Overall a very good beer from New Belgium, perhaps one of my favorites of theirs. The smell and taste are complex enough to keep you interested but not so much that drinking a few is tiresome."
"This being the first Belgian dark ale that I have tried (despite having many Belgian strong dark ales), I have to say this is an intriguing and enjoyable beer. Quite easy to drink, with lots of nuance, but it does take a bit a contemplation and search to find all the bits and pieces. Although this is only the second time I have had anything that was actually impressive from this brewery (La Folie being the other), I would happily purchase this readily available and cheap beer again in the future."
"Overall, this is a fairly straight-forward beer. Not saying that it is boring, it's just not bringing anything unique to the table. This is a great session beer for the stout lover(like myself) who crave something less filling"
"Drinkability: Smooth brew, though not as flavorful as I would like."
"D - Good to average drinkability. This was not excellent making me beg for more but it was not bad either. I probably have to be in the right mood to drink more than two of these in a sitting."
"Mouthfeel is light and thin, giving a watery feel."
"Overall, 1554 is a refreshing example of an underemployed style. Though it's not the perfect example of a Belgian dark ale, it is a good beer and not something you'll drink everyday. I've never been too impressed by New Belgium, but this is one of the betters beers of theirs that I've tried."
"D: Drinkable, yes, black, yes, but not what I feel it should be entirely."
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink. The 1554 is full in flavor yet very light. Definately a good session beer. After my first tastes I was very impressed with the balance and flavor. Definately a beer i'd buy again."
"Taste, nuts, coffee, chocolate, but nothing like a stout. Minimal coffee. Lots of nuts. Still thin bodied, recedes throughout the bottle. One of the most drinkable dark colored beers made in America."
"M&D-mouthfeel I'd pretty thin but not watery. Very smooth and easy to drink a good down the middle of the road beer for when u want something a little dark and richer as well as clean and crisp."
"M/D: I felt that the beer felt lighter than it should have, almost watered down a bit. The carbonation felt right, which helped. As for drinkability, I poured some of it out, simply because I forgot about it. Overall, a less than average beer and one that I would not buy or order again."
"D - Not my favorite beer. Easy to throw a bunch back. I won't be seeking this one out, but if available, I'd grab another."
"Easy drinkin', just needs more flavor."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a dark brown color with a 2 finger light brown head. The aroma is of light roast malt with some raisin and some chocolate. The taste is a little lighter than I thought. There is a sweetness of dark cherry and caramel and a chocolate finish. It is more thin that I would have expected but decent carbonation. All in all a decent brew, but not the top tier I have had in other Belgian brews."
"Overall: A functional and less costly version of this style. Good work from New Belgium, but not world class. If you can get your hands on one (or many), try it."
"Dark brown with a small off white head. Smell is roasty malts and dark fruit. Taste starts off with a subtle dark fruitiness, followed by coffee and bitter chocolate. Finish is a bit metallic. An interesting brew that is unique and drinkable enough to have a few in one sitting."
"Drinks well-definitely sessionable here."
"Light body makes it go down easy. Lots of flavor and leaves me craving another sip. Best choice from New Belgium I've tried so far."
"Notes: My all time favorite porter on the market. It's so well balanced and not too syrupy or sweet. Also, as mentioned the best version of this is cask."
"D: This is session worthy although the brown sugar-like sweetness begins to be slightly grating; I don't know that I could drink these consecutively"
"Drinkability-4.0- Drinkable beer, goes down good, easy to pace with. It's not overwhelming in any way and that's kind of nice and relaxing. 22 oz is just about the right amount for a post meal drink."
"D- Drinkability remains high, despite it's less than sessionable nature. It's so so damn good and multi-faceted, I can't put it down. That's high drinkability in my book!"
"M/D - Very enjoyable to drink and great mouthfeel. The malt balance is great. Recommended."
"D - Light and chocolatey, 1554 isn't too sweet or bitter. I enjoyed its flavor and subtle complexities. Nicely done."
"D: Despite the somewhat disappointing mouthfeel, 1554 is a drinkable brew. You could definitely throw back with a few of these without being overwhelmed."
"freshness date 04/10"
"As for mouthfeel, it's got a thickness to it that ranks right below a porter. Its mouthfeel really helps out in the drinkability department, making this a somewhat of a session beer to more experienced drinkers (and my girlfriend)."
"Love New Belgium beers!"
"Overall, this is my favorite NB beer so far. It's a nice easy drinker that isn't spectacular but is VERY solid."
"D: This brew's drinkability may be its highlight--with enough taste to engross, and a relatively light body, this is undoubtedly a session beer."
"Mouthfeel is rather light, with prickly carbonation. Easy to drink."
"Overall - A superb brew"
"D - Drinkability is good. This is probably my favorite category on this beer. I would have no problems having this over the course of an entire session. Granted, there is nothing really outstanding here and it probably doesn't fit the style too well but I would say it's a solid brew that is put together well."
"strange sensation late...chalky. reminds me of something i felt in a smoked beer recently (seemed metallic in that instance but less so now)"
"Will definitely have this beer again."
"Nice Dark pour into my glass, tannish head raises from the beer. Truthfully I am a bit stuffed to pick out anything still smell nice though. Taste is thoroughly enjoyable one of the best belgian dark beers i have had. So far I have thoroughly enjoyed new Belgiums beers. A bit thin feeling to me but nice and creamy none the less. I would have loved to have had another one but alas it was my only one."
"D - A decent representation of the Belgian Dark Ale brewing style. I could drink several of these before wanting to move onto something else. Props to New Belgium for a good brew...I look forward to sampling your other offerings."
"First found in the Folly Pack and now seek this out out on it's own (don't like the lighter varieties as much)."
"The beer pours a thin dark brown with ruby tints and a light tan head that dissipates quickly. It pours very ""fizzy"" with large bubbles seen rising to the surface from the side of the glass. The aroma isn't very strong, but it is very buscuity with some roasted/chocolate notes and a taste to match. The flavor is dominated by the malt and yeast with with almost no hop presence as others have stated. The beer is rather thin, but the mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth and creamy considering my first impressions of the fizzyness during the pour. Overall it's a pretty solid, enjoyable beer."
"D: OK beer, just a bit underwhelming."
"This Colorado brew is a very dark mahogany brown color with a fair off-white head and very good lacing. The aroma offers solid malt, raisin and wheat, maybe some chocolate. Pretty nice. The flavor brings out smokey malt with a touch of licorice. Smooth and less than medium bodied, quite drinkable. Light, tingly carbonation. Malt is king here, very tasty, along the lines of a strong brown ale. Good stuff."
" "
"Overall this is one of my favorite brews from New Belgium. I'm not a fan of quite a few of their beers, but this one is always a pleasant drinker."
"My pour created a thick, mocha-brown head that would make any self-respecting root beer float envious and it had good retention for its two fingers. Nose was very cocoa-chocolaty. Color was deep-brown with ruby highlights. Mouthfeel was medium with a taste like a chocolate milkshake. Finish was dry and chocolaty, like a malted milk ball. Chocolate lovers, rejoice!"
"Overall I managed to drink several of these. Not the most flavorful beer but good enough to keep me interested. A session beer for sure."
"This is a very drinkable beer that has amazing taste and mouthfeel! If you get a chance to get this Do!!!"
"1554's body is on the lighter side, with medium carbonation. Not a spectacular beer by any means, but its simplicity and balance render it a highly-drinkable, inexpensive offering."
"D - Interesting beer, I suppose, but I kept wishing it was a dark lager or stout. The flavor wasn't the best, but I like the idea behind the beer and I applaud New Belgium for making it."
"drinkability: sessionable belgian indeed and a nice overall selecion. not a bad gateway for newbees to get into darks and belgians."
"Feeling was creamy and smoothy. Liked the carbonation, but didn't pop to make it spicy. Again, very smooth and easy to drink."
"A light drink, nothing special but could be an all day drink if you need it."
"D: Taste-wise, I would definitely session this. But I'm a little guy and anything over about 5% tends to adversely affect me if I session it. So, on those grounds, I'd probably drink this all day but slowly."
"Nothing extreme, but would make a great intro to darker beers. Glad to have tried it on tap!"
"D - Very drinkable, sessionable. Would definitely pick this up in the future."
"Poured into a snifter, left 1/2"" of head. Very dark with some red when held up to the light. Hardly any lacing. The smell is certainly not over-powering. Kind of sweet and nutty. Tastes woody, kind of like smoked wood chips. There's a little bit of chocolate and coffee. Nice and bitter malt, not much as far as hops. The carbonation was pretty low. I think this beer is best for warm days. It doesn't look like a summer beer but I think I enjoyed it more after coming back from the beach. When it's cold outside, I feel more like a smoky porter with a higher abv!"
"D- A decent beer. I kind of enjoyed how low the ABV is on this. This would make for a fine session beer."
"finish is reasonably clean but a slight roasted flavor lingers afterward."
"Good fall brew, worth a try. Nice kick of hops in a wellbalanced and flavorful black ale."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a 5 mm head with good retention and lacing. The appearance is very dark, almost black, and a clear dark brown when held up to the light. The aroma is delicious with sweet chocolate, caramel, and a hint of coffee maltiness. The taste is similarly delightful with only a hint of bitterness. The feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. The finish is clean and chocolatey. Not quite a session beer but drinkable indeed."
"Pours a very dark black with a nice thick frothy head. Good head retention. Has an aroma of chocolate and roasted malts. Taste some hints of coffee with a smooth chocolatey finish. Meduim bodied and silky smooth. This is a great brew that is very easy to drink."
"D: this is a very drinkable brew. It has nice flavors, but everything is subtle and mellow. Nothing complex going on here, but certainly is easy drinking."
"O: Terrific beer, and amazingly cheap. I need to remember to always keep this in stock for company."
"Overall - A very solid brew. Not mind-blowing like the true Belgian dark ales, but nonetheless, a good buy, and worth trying at the least. I'd gladly drink it again."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light and thin, feels dry. Drinkable. Not a favorite, but not bad."
"I wanted to like this beer more than I did. I had only had Fat Tire before, which i know is not considered the best beer from this brewery so I was excited to see it. It was not, however, all that interesting. Great black color but overall not much in the way of belgian character."
"Drinkability - Awesome beer - very mild, slightly roasted, light bitters on the finish which is a very enjoyable direction away from hop bitterness - Very enjoyable!"
"Drinkability: Sitting at only 5.5% ABV, this is a session beer for sure. Not something I'd want on a warm day, or maybe that's just the bowl of potato leek soup that I made talking. Regardless, I think this is more of an Autumn or Winter beer for me, but it's a damn fine one."
"Drinkablilty is quite good to me. This is my first time trying this style and I found it quite delicious. I wouldn't mind this as session beer. Nice pleasing flavors."
"Not bad really, I would have given higher marks if I didn't know that there are much better out there. The flavors are on the weak side, mouth is somewhat lacking despite decent carbonation, overall appeal is less than it was when I first encountered it. Once a six pack standby, now it's one of those I'd prefer to buy on sale."
"Poured on-tap, about a finger of head. Beautiful deep rich black color. It doesn't smell nearly as good as it tastes. There are hints of dark coffee and rich chocolate with some toffee. This is a much richer beer then I would normally expect from a 5.5%, I could certainly drink this one all day."
"Kind of looks like a glass of coke with a decent cap of off-white foam coating the top. I have to try really hard to get anything from the aroma. Mostly I notice the roasted grain smells with a little caramel sweetness in the background. Tastes of cocoa powder, bittersweet chocolate, caramel and roasted coffee. A nice bitterness from the roast flavors couple with a mild hop quality. It coats the mouth in a satisfactory way. A bit sticky and cloying on the finish but not horrible and something that could certainly be fixed with a decent food pairing. Of the NB beers I've had so far (Mothership Wit and Fat Tire being the other two) this one is certainly the better of the three in my opinion and the one I'm drinking has actually reached it's drink by date so I'm guessing it's even better when fresh, at least I hope so. At any rate, I'd give it another try and would recommend it to others."
"D= session if you're in the darker ale mood, nothing offensive, blends well with most meats light or dark, or chocolate dessert."
"d- very drinkable, didn't know what i was to expect with this style, but it's delicious. the flavors are complex and interesting, but none of them overpower the others, damn i wish i had another."
"Tried this beer number of times and rarely pour it into a glass. The colour is nice and dark with an off white to tan head, Smell is light with some hints of malt and a little sweetness. This is a highly drinkable beer being very light for the style. The lack strong carbonation and mild flavours make this a beer that can be enjoyed in many settings from a cold day with comfort food, to a warm spring day by the grill."
"-liked it. not too hard which makes sense for a stout lover and my capability to drink it so easily"
"From notes. Served pretty cold. Deep amber with ruby, very clear. Not much head, fades to film and ring, good lacing. SMELL not too much. Grainy, malty sweet, tame. TASTE is mild, grainy/malty, touch of sweetness. Clean finish. FEEL is thin, benighn, clean finish. Easy drinking but not memorably."
"This makes for a decent beer to usher in autumn with. Try it if you see it. It's a unique beer that'll be a nice change up to your daily rotation."
"D - Not a beer I would drink for an entire night, but certainly a good rich addition to any night of tasting."
"I believe that this beer is misclassified because it is obvious that NB was trying to brew an oldschool black ale...Nicely done...really mild, but there is a great deal of complexity under all of the dark fruit."
"This actually an edit of a prvious review. First time I rated it at 3.7. It also was my 100th beer review."
"Smell yielded a nutty scent. Taste reflected that smell, but also added a roasted malty/biscuity flavor. Very tasty. Medium mouthfeel - a bit watery. Sessionable, but I think it's best when allowed to stand on its own."
"I would definitely drink it again, and I may try it over a cigar this time around rather than a steak. In addition, this would be a good starter beer for those who are looking to try darker beers."
"+ one of new belgium's better beers (and it doesn't taste of apricots!)"
"Drinkability- moderate."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a one finger off white head. Smells and tastes of chocolate and coffee malt with bananas. The flavor is slightly sweet mixed with slight coffee bitterness. Medium bodied, smooth, creamy, and nicely carbonated. This is a nicely drinkable beer."
"In all, it's a wonderful brew, one that I could well imagine supping for a long time as a winter beer, but equally refreshing in our early California autumn."
"D: A drinkable American version of a Belgian Dark Ale."
"I had wanted to taste this beer for some time. Finally found it at a gas station in town. I have to say... I was a bit disappointed. While this pours a pretty dark brown, it really falls short on nose and flavor. Sure, there is enough roasty malt and coffee to keep me interested, but quite honestly, I was expecting something a bit more out-of-the-ordinary. This is, most unfortunately, quite ordinary. Drinkability is high due to the low ABV, thus making the brew quite sessionable. Worth trying? Sure. Will I buy it again? Probably not."
"Thanks to fretlessman over at realbeer for this one. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. 1554 appears a dark chestnut color with about an inch of creamy tan foam. Nose and flavor are of rich roasted and toasted grains, bittersweet chocolate, lightly roasted coffee notes, slight hints of smoke, caramel. A tad better than medium bodied with adequate carbonation for the style. Quite nice."
"Drinkability: Pretty high due to the low ABV, but I'm slowed a little by the moderate mouthfeel. Good beer, but not amazingly so."
"I'd have another. definitely drinkable, I can remember more than one party where I swigged down one after another of these (the New Belgium UAR) My new belgium of choice."
"D=extremely sessionable and enjoyable."
"This Beer Is One Of My Favorites."
"Drinkability: Quite nice unique beer. Very much worth trying and would have again every once in a while. Probably the best of New Belgium's normal line-up, which, unfortunately, isn't saying much."
"Pours a very dark brown, with a medium tan head. Smells strongly of roasted malts. Taste is very sweet up front, chocolaty, a hint of coffee as well. There is a bit of artificial sweetener sweetness that is a bit odd in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, nice low carbonation. Pretty drinkable, this is a good beer from NB that is a unique style. I would drink this again, though it is not my favorite from them."
"pours a dark looking ale with an inviting fluffy head. light reveals it to be an auburn blood shade. good lace and good head retention. smells like chocolate and roasted malts. tastes like a milder smoked porter, coffee like and cocoa, finishes sticky. aftertaste gets a little to smokey too. good carbonation mix, pretty easy to drink save the finish. not bad!"
"Poured to a nice caramel colored head. Had some very nice lacing that left rings with every swallow. Brew itself was very dark brown to almost black in color. Had a slightly sweet caramel smell also of roasted malt and coffee. Tasted like it smelled. Had that roasted malt, slightly sweet caramel, and a little of that coffee flavor. Had a dry aftertaste. All tastes were mild and not overpowering. I think it was pretty well balanced. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was right. This Ale reminded me more of a Porter. That wasnt a bad thing. I wouldnt want to make this a session beer. But a few would sure taste good now and then."
"I'm very impressed with 1554. Great taste, mouthfeel, and decent carbonation makes this a great session choice. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: it's drinkable to a certain extent but because of the flavor issues I can't rate it very high."
"Drinkability: One of those beers I can go round after round, a good standby since the price doesn't hurt much and it is drinkable, it's a top contender for my go-to."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable brew. Would seem to pair well many different foods. Not a bad beer to have on hand for any type of beer drinker. Not sure if I will have many more, but still good to have around."
"D: Very nice brew overall which met my expectations. I really enjoyed the balance and the subtlety of the flavors, a very nice sipping beer. Haven't tried too many New Belgiums at this point and I know they've got a mixed opinion, but I was impressed they got a Belgian Dark in wide distribution. A rock solid brew with good distribution, a sanctuary beer in scarce places."
"Very interesting beer. As homebrewer I would increase the roast and chocolate to a level equal of the fruit and grain toast rather than just elusive hints hiding amongst the tannic finish. Also perhaps increase the body with some maltodextrins without increasing sweetness? Anyway, it's delicious. It's really subtle with its flavors but they are there for the enjoying if you care to look."
"Drinkability: You know what? I really like this beer. It's not especially big or big with crazy robust flavors, but just a simple toasty and bready maltiness -- the smell is solid enough and lets you know what you will be drinking and the mouthfeel is fairly light. A mild ABV allows one to get through a couple with really no issues whatsoever."
"Notes: delicious, had it local, recommended for people who like roasted malts."
"Overall, I had no idea what to expect but I was pleasently suprised. I really like the somewhat subtle mellow coffe flavor from the roasted malt. I would probably get this again...if I could get it here."
"D- Not a bad brew, but certainly not one that will knock you off of your feet with flavor."
"Drew a nice head and as with the quality brews it kept on keepin on. It was black/amber and smelled great nice and hoppy with a chocolate malt smell. It tasted very light I was suprised since it was so light. The aftertaste is the nice thing about this beer the caramel and chocolate/coffee tones come out after a min. It was a nice smooth drink on a nice hot day. I would prob drink it frequently if I could get more than 22 oz bottles but I guess its at a good price and who doesn't like to down a whold 22 oz bottle all at once."
"Dark amber, very nice scent. Yummy. Looked great when poured with some residual head. Swirled and smelled. Very nice. Malty pleasents. Taste was complex and simple and the same time. Meaning... You could taste the different ingredients well but without taking over the beer. Simple to drink without different flavors... Mixed well. mouthfeel was pleasent. and this beer was easy to drink. again. Yummy."
"Served in a chilled glass, which makes appearance a little more difficult to evaluate. It was dark brown with a small but fluffy cap of foam. Straight forward malty brew through and through. Roasty, chocolately, bready. No bitterness from hops, no burn from alcohol. It was nice paired with my meal, but couple with the food to be quite filling. Decent offering from NB."
"light to medium body, but pretty smooth. flash of astringency in the finish. gentle to moderate carbonation gives tingle, helps body and gives flavor lift."
"cheers"
"D: So very quaffable. Satisfying. I dunno why I have drug my feet on trying this beer. It's just awesome."
"Poured a very nice dark brown with copper tinges, a nice bit of initial, if rapidly fading, head, and just a wee bit of lacing. Great scent, a subtle mixture of great sweet malt, chocolate flavors, floral hints, and a nice orange/banana aroma. Great taste, starts strong with chocolate and then goes into an excellent banana/citrus flavor, giving it a nice mixture. Ends with a huge sweetness on the tongue, but with enough hops to keep it grounded. Very smooth. I was very impressed with this brew."
"well, ok but not spec. drinkable but not delicious."
"Drinkability - This was my second 1554, after having it out one evening when New Belgium first came to SC. Quite drinkable."
"drinkability: good"
"D- Not bad, the taste is pretty inoffensive, low ABV, but it's a little lacking IMO. Not really the robust drinker that I was hoping for."
"Very nice brew. Recommended. This is a very interesting brew and rather enjoyable."
"D - A tasty and interesting brew, but not overly memorable... Goes down easy and could prove quite sessionable at only 5.5% ABV..."
"D: A tasty and complex sipper that's thoroughly enjoyable. If this enlightened ale is evocative of black brews enjoyed in Belgian taverns 500 years ago, I may have been born five centuries too late."
"New Belgium 1554 poured a dark brown/ruby color with large tan head, and good lacing. The smell was of dark fruits and brown sugar. The taste was very sweet, loaded with chocolate flavors. Mouthfeel was good, good carbonation. I found this beer to be a bit filling, and that is why it lost some on the drinkability for me, overall though I found this to be a very nice beer. I enjoy most beers I have had from New Belgium and this was no different."
"D- Very drinkable, but again I think that is because it is almost too subdued. Quite balanced and smooth to be sure. Doesn't not have you on your knees begging for another, but I certainly wouldn't pass up an offer for a second."
"Pretty solid I would say."
"Very tasty, I would like to get it on tap or in a growler some day!"
"This beer has a nice creamy mouthfeel, with a medium-light body. Pretty nice beer overall, and at $3.50/22oz., not a bad deal at all!"
"Pours a dark, reddish brown with an off white head. Aroma of toasted nuts and milk chocolate. Medium bodied with light carbonation and sweet caramel taste with a light chocolate after taste. Gets a little cloying towards the end, but overall a great beer."
"Pours a deep rich dark brown with a tan dark brown light head with tight bubbles. Smell is chocolatey, malty, caramely, hoppy, creamy and nutty. Taste is very smooth and nutty, spicy and hoppy a tad floral with caramel and dark chocolate with hazelnut and cream cheese. Mouthfeel is nice and thick with decent drinkability."
"Not the greatest EVAH, but solid."
"D - pretty good. Easy to drink and enough to maintain interest."
"I have to admit that this beer is absolutely beautiful in the glass. It pours a beautiful deep dark red with a full and thick beige head forming. There is Minimal lacing on the glass. Very malty in the aroma, giving off scents of strong chocolate, light toffee, and some earth. A light bodied beer. Tastes of roasted coffee, giving way to some strong earthy notes. Finish was very minimal. Overall, a pretty decent beer."
"D - A very nice beer overall. Beautiful and great flavor in one package."
"Notes: Very nice dark ale, I enjoyed it a lot. The richness means it is something I wouldn't want more than one of in a session though."
"This brew is a pleasure to drink and part of that is due to the excellent mouthfeel. Smooth and creamy but not overly bodied. This beer coats your mouth nicely but then subsides to a rich coffee chocolate malt aftertaste and a subtle dryness. Damn fine beer and damn easy to drink."
"Taste was good, slight roastiness, hints of vanilla, but having a more noticeable boozey, alcohol taste I would rather not have. Not heavy, rather light bodied and very drinkable, a good dark beer for the summer."
"D-Good. Easy to drink with a lighter feel. A prime example to show that dark color does not equate to full bodied."
"Definitely okay and I love this brewer. Less than $3 a bottle at Total Wine & More. I like the Witbier the best though!"
"D: A very nice beer. The thinner viscosity increases the drinkability and it paired very nicely with a grilled Appenzeller and arugula sandwich. Surprisingly easy drinking."
"Surprising, and exceptional dark ale from new belgium. Not necessarily intruiging, but a very repeatedly enjoyable beer. This is going on my list of favorites."
"All around, I really like this beer. I'm a fan of beers with wonderful malt character, and this fits the bill."
"D: This is one to savour, it may be better to share this with a friend since it's so rich."
"this isn't a bad beer,i think it pales in comparison to chambly noire and rare vos.i could drink a few of these,they are reasonably priced."
"pours a dark, almost black color with a very thin tan head. the head almost all but vanished quickly, leaving just a ring around the edge that seemed to last. it smells roasted with a bit of chocolate. tastes a bit like coffee. med feel that drinks smooth, well carbonated."
"D - I could see myself drinking these as a pair, back to back, just to have something different during a session. But dunno how well I'd want to make this a full part of my session beer, but I'll be damned if I'm not currently enjoying this one."
"D - Easy drinker and nice to see a bomber for under $4."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a tan head that goes away rapidly. The glass I poured it into was wet so I'm not gonna blame the beer for bad head retention. Smells like chocolate, coffee, and toasted bread. Tastes kind of ""crunchy."" A lot of the same flavors found in the nose are there, particularly the roasted malt characteristics. Not much hop presence to speak of. I've had this many times before and don't remember it being as sweet as I think it is in this tasting, maybe I'm just comparing it to the Pacifico I just drank. Either way, I like this one."
"drinkability: I like that it has real character, but it doesn't taste particularly good."
"Overall: I really like this beer and at 4 bucks a bomber I foresee several bottles will find a new home in my fridge."
"D: This is one of my favorites from New Belgium. I'll be picking up one or two of these to keep on hand, especially at $2.99 for a 22oz bomber."
"Overall - my first New Belgium and I can see what the hype is about. I cannot get this in Ohio but will look for it when I visit NC again."
"I poured the beer at around 45 degrees. The balance improved immensely as the it warmed up 5-10 degrees."
"This is a very easy-drinking beer, not my favorite, but not bad at all."
"This was given to me as a housewarming gift by a buddy of mine and we cracked it open at a party. Pours a deep brown, slightly murky color. Looks slightly watery. Smell is very spicy with a slight hint of toffee and chocolate. Taste reflects the nose. Spicy, bits of chocolate. Relatively effervescent. Lower ABV makes this one pretty drinkable. Decent brew from New Belgium."
"Very sessionable. I'm not really wowed by it, but it's still damn solid and a pretty nice bargain."
"D: I am super suprised by this beer even though I didn't know what to expect. It works very nicely. Its light on the palate and the tummy and makes it so you can keep pulling from that glass. It just plain works. This bomber will not be an issue whatsoever and I should have picked up multiple bottles. This is decent one for keeping in the house if you want an easy drinker with some flavor but its not going to break the bank. Good stuff."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I absolutely loved this beer! Wonderfully surprising chocolaty, fruit cake flavors, thick, chewy, dessert like feel, loved it all! I could enjoy a couple of these in the winter season, the flavors are just so warm and inviting. The appearance was great as well, Ive seen this beer sitting on the shelf for a long time, I finally tried it, and I got to say, I was blown away with how delicious it was. Highly recommended! Cheers!"
"Good mouthfeel and easy drinking make this more like a porter than a belgian dark ale."
"This is a nice beer, ultra-smooth and mellow chocolate in flavor. I am impressed with this after the second time I drank it. The first was skunked and past the date on bottle. Although, once it gets past its drink by date, it become oxidized tasting and not very consumable, so watch the date! Luckily I got this one before the end date! A really enjoyable, drinkable black ale. Reminds me of a German Black Lager or Czech Cellar beer."
"Overall, quite good. A mix of characteristics that, at times, seem not to fit together as they should, but which come together in the overall impression as a nice complex yet drinkable medley. The fairly low 5.6% ABV keeps it going, making it a decent session-esque beer, but one which would probably become tiring after a while."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint-glass a crisp dark brown with a thin diminishing head that leaves slight lacing. Aroma is a slight amount of fruit and yeast. The taste is a complex blend of fruits, dark malts and slight yeast. The taste is light and crisp, especially for a dark ale. This one was quite enjoyable."
"The bomber pours brilliantly clear very dark brown with garnet highlights. The head is pronounced, off-white and leaves a nice lacing. The aroma is moderate-high chocolate malt, as well as a bit of roast and some sweetness. The flavor is highly chocolate malt and slightly bittersweet. The finish is on the dry side with a nice lingering malt flavor. Carbonation and body are both moderate. Overall a very enjoyable brew, quite drinkable and great chocolate malt flavor."
"22 ounce bottle, best before 9/18/2009. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch and a half tan frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. It smells like dark fruit, roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, pears, and bananas. It's a very fruity and malty aroma. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like green apple, bready malt, smoke, earth, yeast, coffee, chocolate, dark fruit and a bit of spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with good but smooth carbonation. Also feels a bit creamy and coating. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. Not a bad choice as a session beer either. I think this is a good overall brew. Give me a 1554 instead of a Fat Tire any day!"
"So far this is pretty good. Unfortunately, even switching glasses didn't help the weak aroma."
"D: Well balanced, sessionable, full of pleasant flavor. This deserves the mainstream recognotion that Fat Tire has gotten. A much better beer and very nice. A great choice for an everyday brew."
"Pours to the thin off-white head and no lacing (might be the glass). Color is dark red-brown and clear. Aroma is a complex mixture of sweet malt, chocolate, banana, pear and plum. Flavor starts with a rich chocolatey ,malt and fruity sweetness that gives way to an almond-like nuttiness and bitterness. Mouthfeel OK. Easy to drink. This is a unique dark ale from a unique US brewer. Good stuff."
"D: Easily, EASILY my favorite year-round offering from New Belgium. When it's on tap, I just can't say no."
"Great New Belgium brew and glad to have it in Georgia. Nice taste, complex, lots of flavors but enjoyable to drink - this bomber is a nice size and great deal at $2.99."
"D: Enjoyable beer, especially for a bomber costing $4. Nice profile of flavors that present themselves without assaulting your tastebuds. Was able to lounge around while slowly enjoying this beer."
"D-Had marked this higher, since it's an enjoyable brew, but halfway through the bottle it started to lose it's appeal a bit...the sweetness grew more pronounced between sips, and I'd stop short of calling it cloying, but it starts to unbalance an otherwise awesome drinking experience. Still, this is a complex brew worth trying, although it is a tad overpriced."
"D- a nice session beer but is filling. this 22 was enough for me."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with good carbonation."
"Overall... is it good? Yep. Would I drink it again? Yep. Do I (in my uneducated opinion) think of it as a Belgian Dark Ale? Nope."
"Pours a very dark brown with little head. Smells and tastes cleanly of malts. On the brewery website they claim that this is their take on beer from 1554. This has a very smokey malty flavor that reminds me of a stout or almost an RIS, but with much less gravity. No hop taste at all, but considering that, it's not overly sweet. I'd have to say that I enjoy it, although it is a bit pricey for a beer that is neither especially good or alcoholic. I'm glad that I tried it, but I don't think it holds a candle to Fat Tire or Mothership Wit."
"D - very drinkable. good dark session beer for any occasion"
"Drinkable? maybe. not my favorite style, could do without alot of the bread."
"D: Pretty damn drinkable. Low alcohol and sessionable."
"The foam was wheat in color, very thick, foamed alot -kept growin'. and very lacey. The color a very opaque with amber/cherry red highlights. The smell had a wheat/hops overtone with dull fruity undertones. The taste was deep, rich, dull wheatovertone with hints of fruit and a carmel highlight and also a bit of coffee flavour. Mouthfeel - med. to full-bodied and somewhat smooth. Drinkability - it's alright, but the bitter tones seems to dominate, which isn't a personal favorite."
"Very easy to drink beer, nose was less than inspiring but the flavor backed it up. Hard to keep this one away from my mouth for long."
"D. This is the first time I tried this style. I though overall the beer was good. Slightly stronger smell than the taste actually was. I would definately try this style again."
"D- An after dinner cordial. Not something I would have a few of. But very good."
"I've yet to have a New Belgium offering that wasn't a good beer."
"Medium brown color with a slight brown head. It had a distinct caramel aroma which made me think it was going to be overly sweet. It was not. It did have a sweetness but was balanced out by the hops. I got a strong alcohol aftertaste as well."
"It poured very dark with a cream colored head. When held to the light you could see some ruby red. The smell was faint with hints of caramel. The taste was crisp and not too sweet. I could taste the chocolate as the beer warmed. It has an average ABV so that makes it a very drinkable beer for me."
"If your looking to try N.B. for the first time, start here, it's a solid beer!"
"I thought this brew was quite good. I didn't expect much after the weak aroma so the taste kind of blew me away at first. Very nice session beer and I await the arrival of New Belgium in Indiana."
"It's a good beer to drink if you're up for a new type of ale to drink, but it's a bit on the expensive side. Buy it if you're curious but that's only for the hardcore beer connoisseur."
"Overall, drinkable, in a decent schwarzbeir kind of way but doesn't present the flavor or intensity of a great Belgian dark ale."
"Had this on tap at the Houston Flying Sucer. Pours a nice dark brown color with half inch thick creamy head. Aroma is full of oats and chocolate. Nice malty flavor with choclate, caramel, and very light coffee. Very well balanced and easy to drink. Another good beer from a good brewery. Will try again."
"Wonderfully drinkable. New Belgium, please hurry up and come to Florida."
"D- Due to its light bodied structure this ale is very drinkable and in no way undesirable."
"Overall I'd say this is my favorite choice from the entire brewery - and that's saying a LOT!"
"Too thick and sweet to be especially sessionable, but it is certainly enjoyable to drink,"
"Notes: A really drinkable dark ale. Reminds me of the better Schwarzbiers. Lighter in body, but huge on taste. Incredible for the price!"
"I am a fan of Fat Tire so I was really looking forward to trying this one. It didn't let me down. Quite drinkable."
"I like this beer. Fat Tire (being the most popular New Belgium brew) does nothing for me, so I came to this beer with low expectations. An aggressive pour from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass resulted in a quickly disappearing one finger head. The color is a gorgeous burnt molasses dark brown. The smell was a very pleasant malty chocolate with a little coffee in the mix. The taste was pleasant and very in line with the aroma (sweet malt with some chocolate) but was a little more subtle than I hoped for. Still very good, though. Very, very drinkable and a great session candidate."
"T + M + D: Lots of mild chocolate flavours. I seemed to pick up on a little touch of smokiness in the beginning, but that appears to have gone away so it may have been in my head. Some light, almost fruity flavours adding a little tang. The body is a little lighter, and does well with the taste. It's very flavourful, but nothing is explosive, nor is the body extreme or lacking. It's simply a nice, delicately balanced brew. This could even be a fantastic session candidate... it drinks incredibly smoothly - and, in my case, quickly!"
"It's beer. Looks nice. Dark ruby/brown. Not as dark as my english barleywine but, duh. Smells earthy and chocolate malts. Drinks earthy and chocolate malts. Maybe a little coffee. It's a pretty good beer. Great body for the small alcohol - you'd never guess it was so low in ABV. Nicely balanced. A good beer."
"all in all, i highly recommend this beer for the dark belgium lovers...cheers"
"Pours a clear dark brown with reddish fringes. Small head that disappeared to a thin line. There was lots of lacing down the glass. Aromas of sweet coffee malts, smells a little fruity and tangy. Sweet coffee, chocolate, and black licorice flavors. There is also a fruity or hoppy background behind the strong coffee flavors. A bitterness shows up in the middle and end. There is also a nice chocolate coffee flavor that lingers in the dry finish. Good mouthfeel and carbonation. Good taste."
"The taste is also mostly a sweet, full earthiness with a hint of chocolate and toastiness that fades to leave a pleasant, mild earthy aftertaste. The palate is thick and full."
"Although this isn't the type of beer I would typically go for, the low abv makes it a Belgian style that you can enjoy in larger amounts."
"Overall, as you may have gathered, I'm a fan. For a while this was my favourite beer (it has since been usurped, but it will always hold a special place in my heart), and it is one that I try to use to introduce my friends to tasty brews, as opposed to tolerable swig. Please try it."
"D= Pretty decent. I've heard a lot of ppl say they like this over fat tire but I would disagree. Fat Tire I think tops this one. Granted I haven't had too many Belgian Dark's but I think this is a little quiet for a belgian."
"I wasn't particularly impressed with this one, not right off the bat, anyway. It poured up a crystal clear, dark red colour with a huge 2 and a half - three finger foamy cap that stayed in place for several minutes. Smell, honestly, reminded me of BMC. Perhaps a notch or two above, but IMO, I couldn't really detect anything of much quality present in the smell. Flavour, luckily, was a bit better. There was a lovely woodiness present here which to me, tasted like freshly sawn, damp timber smells, along with some modest malt flavours. Mouthfeel was okay, I suppose, in regards to weight and carbonation; again, nothing really impressive. Overall, not a terrible concoction, and certainly several notches above Fat Tire. As always, glad I had the opportunity to have a go at this one."
"Drinkability: Goes down easily and would work well session beer (but the ABV is a bit high for that)."
"overall it's fun to drink, very inviting especially for chocalate lovers. funny i can't taste the alcohol."
"The drink has a firm medium body and a spritz of carbonic liveliness that pushes 1554 into an echelon of near-highest drinkability. The best brew I've enjoyed from New Belgium to date."
"D: Mild flavors and decent mouthfeel make this an easy drinker."
"D: A good beer to be enjoyed by itself. Very complex. Might pair well with well cooked meats."
"This is a solid beer from New Belgium. Served in a nice rounded New Belgium tulip glass it's on the dark end of the spectrum, with a nice inviting head. I had this beer at a number of different places on a trip to Colorado and sometimes it came in a pint and looked pretty much like an American porter. The best way to describe this beer is the word ""nice"". It's just a nice beer. It's got a nice soft feel to it, a nice creamy-ness, and a nice but not too sweet dry chocolatey-ness to it. Not like a chocolate added type of beer, but a nice strong sense of chocolate coming through in the malt backdrop. Real smooth and pleasant and again, just nice to drink."
"Overall an above average beer, but nothing makes me want to buy again. After looking forward to having this brand in the area, this beer is a bit of a let down...not to mention their distribution decision..."
"Dark, coppery brown with a creamy, sticky head. The aroma is initially roasted dark malts, caramelized sugars, and coffee beans. Deeper down is a softer, fruitier, more floral aspect that takes the edge off of the drier, charred malts. The flavor, like the smell, is a balance of chocolate and lightly burned malts with mellow sweet fruits like berries and cherries. There a definite Belgian yeast character, but not so much that it takes control. Light in the mouth with a drying finish. Lingering cherry candy. Pretty tasty and interesting..."
"Had an extra bottle left over from a trade I sent off so I figured I would try it out. Pours a dark brown with ruby red highlights, little head fades fast, almost no lacing. Smells of chocolate, toffee, little coffee, and some fruits but I cant make out what exactly. Has a burnt/roasted taste to it almost like Guinness. Thin Watery Mouth feel was a little disappointing. But it was easy to drink"
"Drinkability: Good beer, but a little too bitter without much support to drink this too quickly, or to have more than a glass or two. Maybe it's just not my style of beer. I smelled entirely different things than I tasted, which was slightly off-putting, and confusing. I probably won't seek it out again, but wouldn't refuse it if offered."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer and I plan on drinking it again. I hope to be able to enjoy some other Belgian style beers from New Belgium in the future."
"22 oz. One of the more interesting pours I've seen in a while. Near black brown pour, with the head near straight white. The contrast unusual and interesting looking. Little white bubbly lacing. Malty aroma, roast nut. Tastes simple of roast malt and cocoa. Just the tiniest start of sourness, but it is gone so quickly it might just be me. Could be some slight dark fruits. A little tobacco in the finish is a little odd, but not off-putting. Found this extreamly drinkable after a nice bike ride. Reminded me of a Schwarzbier. Of the 2 I've had from New Belgium, this one Fat Tire, I definetely prefer this. Would seek it out for regular consumption."
"1554 Enlightened Black Ale was dark brown in color with okay head retention. It had chocolately aromas with some floral undertones to it. The 1554 carried a malty taste with hints of chocolate. It had a kind of thick mouthfeel. This is a fine beer and would drink it again."
"All in all, a nice beer if you want an easy-drinking, not very complex Belgian."
"Drinks easy with a lighter mouthfeel than most black ales or porters. Has flavor and complexity to carry it through."
"Great session drinker."
"I could drink this as a session beer for sure."
"Easy to drink beer with chocolatey flavor. Not too sweet, not too sour, not too bitter. Very balanced."
"Nice to see New Belgium stuff in the supermarkets aroung Greensboro.Poured into an overiseized wine glass a deep brown like cola color with a great one finger off white head,just creamy looking with great definition,nearly a five.Aromas were a little light but pleasant,bitter chocolate,clove,and black licorice were what I picked up most.Highly drinkable with subtle complexity on the palate,bitter chocolate and dry earthy tones with some licorice-like flavors,the sweetness is kept in check well but lends good balance.A damn fine brew,I liked it more than I thought I would."
"D - a decent sessionable black ale, although the chocolate note was somewhat overwhelming for me at times; a decent offering from new belgium"
"Clear dark amber with a fluffy tan head that leaves fine lacing on the glass. Mollasses, oatmeal, toffee and raisins in the nose along with some fresh yeastiness. Tastes of brown sugar and gingerbread,yeast fruitiness like an overripe banana and vanilla. Light and smooth on the palate. Good quaffer."
"D - An easy beer to drink. Not especially compelling but pleasant enough."
"Served on-tap in a straight pint glass. Poured on the still side, not much head or carbonation, minimal lacing. A shade of black that is just shy of being black, while being too dark to be any shade of brown. Nothing noticeable in the aroma. Slight roasted flavors in taste, but nothing that stands out. The body is light for an ale, but would be fulfilling if considered a lager."
"D= A good solid drinkable, and sessionable, beer. Not the greatest thing out there but it is unique and well worth a try every now and then. Paired well with shepherd's pie for dinner."
"Pours a dark brown colored body, with reddish fringes, and a dull white head, diminishing. Has a chocolaty roasted aroma, along with some malts. Has a dry taste, a dusty chocolaty taste. Watery palate, with a dull taste. Some malts."
"overall very drinkable, nice character in subtle application."
"I found the nose to be strong and earthy. Mouthfeel was light and highly carbonated. Too much carbonation in my opinion. Malt and coffee flavors were predominant, with the coffee flavors lingering."
"A tasty, if tough to categorize, black beer from New Belgium."
"Pretty drinkable beer, better than I had expected."
"This beer was served in a pilsner glass - a beer that was dark brown with ruby highlights. About an inch head to it with sticky lacing throughout. Nose was of smokiness, caramel, roasted and sweet malts. Taste is well balanced between the sweet and bitterness. The carbonation is actually extremely visible. I was also surprised by the light body on this beer. Overall, quite pleasant and the lighter body to it makes it a beer that I could sit with for a session and not feel full."
"D: Very easy to drink, definitely could drink a few of these and would buy a six pack of this stuff."
"ill just write a short paragraph about this one. NOT GOOD. i actually went into this beer thinking ""you know what? this might be the first new belgium beer i actually like"". boy was i wrong. its see-through dark brown body and tan head were the most impressive (though still not very impressive) aspects of this one. it smells sweet as hell with noticable malts. the taste is sweet fruit and black licorice, and ever-so bland. all i have to say about drinkability is that i knew i had made a mistake with the first sip, and i wanted so badly to pour it out."
"Mouthfeel: Makes me think of blend of a dark Belgian ale with a schwarzbier. Pleasant and highly drinkable with a reasonable ABV%."
"I really like this one. It's one of the first beers I branched out into after I discovered that fat tire wasn't the only drinkable beer out there. I was really pleasantly surprised, and drank this one quite a lot for a while. A nice dark color with a hint of chocolate in the smell and taste. I could actually drink this one all evening very happily, and when I'm at the grocery store, if there's nothing new to try, this one is often the one I'll fall back onto."
"mouth is crisp but rich in quality light carbonation and drinks fairly easy. A black ale to cherish for sure but I would have to be in just the right mood again to really enjoy this one."
"D: Being that it's a thinner beer it's very drinkable and doesn't get old, very easy to drink a bomber"
"Thanks to artisanbrew for the hookup, wherever you are. :)"
"A good beer that needs to be drank with a clean palate in order to detect much of the subtle flavors. A good starter beer and most certainly qualifies as sessionable."
"Small head that disappears quickly; deep brown and red hues (not incredibly dark, which was slightly disappointing) with limited lace down sides of glass. Smells of sweet malts, particularly chocolate. Tastes of coffee, caramel and dark chocolate. Hops apparent in moments, enough to call this beer well-balanced. Light mouthfeel with enough carbonation and memorable malts makes this ale easy and pleasant to drink, though I'm a little disappointed that it lacks a bigger flavor and body considering the name and classification. This wouldn't stop me from having another or recommending it to folks. I'd just change some things on the label."
"D - Two or three of these would be pretty good right now. Very drinkable."
"Over all good beer, a little over carbonated but not too much. Similar to new belgiums abbey beer but more smoky and not as great in my opinion."
"The aroma is odd with both roasted malt and hops but also a yeast smell that is unique as well as some chocolate and earthiness. The appearance is brown with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is smooth but a tad thin. Overall I like it but its not a favorite."
"Overall - I like this beer. It is sort of hard to come by in Iowa, but when I find it, I buy it. It does not stand out as a favorite, but definitely a good staple."
"d: i think this beer has solid darker malt flavors with a lot of wheatiness; if anything is weak it is the mouthfeel but still a really good beer"
"This is one of my favorite beers. Growing up 45 minutes away from the brewery it is one of my 'home grown favorites.' Trust me, you haven't had it until you have had it from the brewery."
"Drinkability is very nice on this beer. The syrupy, yet smooth mouthfeel lends this beer to be drank very quickly. It has good taste and goes down so nicely. I wish this beer had better taste, but its a good solid beer to take down a six-pack of."
"Overall a decent beer. Not a big fan of this type, but this beer is one of the better I have had."
"Verdict: Another complex and interesting offering from New Belgium, 1554 is a roasted-malt delight with that little Belgian twist New Belgium is so famous for. If you haven't sampled 1554 yet, put it on your list of beers to try."
"Medium body, and one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. I was very surprised and taken aback by this. One of my new favorites!"
"D: Very easy to drink, but it wasn't really a special experience. I didn't get tired of it before the end of the glass, but I doubt I would reach for another bottle given other choices."
"Pours a lovely dark red, almost black color with a creamy off-white head. Smells of chocolate and roasted malt. Tastes the same, heavy roasted malt flavor with a chocolate tinge. Very very drinkable, nice and full mouthfeel."
"Very drinkable."
"Note to Self: Ranked the #4 Belgian Dark Ale when I tried it."
"Deep black with amber highlights and a foamy tan head. The last time I had this beer was about a year ago and I hated it. Now it smells malty and sweet and complex. It tastes just as good. It is a little bubbly for me, but its a belgian so that is to be expected. I love this beer, it's my favorite from New Belgium."
"Drinkability - After a light dinner, in lieu of dessert, I would/could enjoy a 1554. When the temperatures dip into the negatives, pull out a couple 1554s to provide warmth."
"D- It is very smooth with little carbonation which makes it very easy to drink without missing out on the full bodied flavorness of a great beer."
"Pours a deep red/brown with a creamy tan head that lasts for two good drafts leaving a nice lacing. Fruity sweet scent with a chocolatey roasted malt taste finishing slighty sweet and nutty. Very smooth and easy to drink brew. A dark ale I would definitely recommend to fans of this style."
"Overall: a very good beer with a good balance and character. Enjoyed"
"My head and stomach told me something else the next day. Drink this as an after dinner treat. I think that this is New Belgiums best."
"Tap @ Fox. Pours dark, dark brown with a thick brown head. Aroma is bitter; coffee, baker's chocolate, and smoke. Taste is questionable. Some pulls were good, others seemed sour. I think the yeast is to blame. It seemed to be fighting the hops and malt for dominance. Needs more balance."
"Poured into a pint glass giving off a beautiful cream colored head, that left a nice lacey lining on the glass walls. Showed a very dark ruby black color, similar to that of Coca Cola. Dark chocolate malts with a roasted smelling nose...very roasty actually. Dark bitter baking chocolate with very faint hints of toffee. Almost get a burnt/dark roast coffee. The taste was what expected from the smell with dark roasty coffee overtones that lingered in my mouth. Roasted malted sweetness prevails over the hoppy bitterness. I'm not a big hophead, so this aspect was pleasing. Mouthful entailed a medium to full body with a smooth velvety feel as I consumed this dark beverage. One would be enough for now, but I would definitely consider buying this again. It very much reminds me of this underhouse smoked porter I had back in college."
"D: unique brew overall. I can not say that I have had a ""Black Ale," as they call it. Good well rounded beer!"
"D: Take your time with this one. It's not much of a session beer. It's just an exceptionally good, unusually rewarding middle-of-the-road ale."
"Very toasty, little bit nutty with a slight fruit sugar (sucrose? that's the sugars made by fruits right, its not a fruit flavored sugar here, its more of a slight sweetness that comes from bitting into a ripe fruit, now what kind of fruit that is is hard to say. i mean it's easy to say what it's not. it's not grapefruit, orange, mango, guava, pineapple, or all those other fruits associated with hoppier beers. the fruitiness here is that found in Belgian beers, funny right? cos this is a belgian style ale, but I digress...fruitiness is like that found in St. Bernardus, a darker, herbal fruitness, like a date that you might find at the bottom of the bag of trail mix, that date taking on the flavors of all the almonds, cashews, and peanuts ) so yeah that's what that fruitiness is like in this beer. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but the creaminess displayed here is the saving grace for the beer. A very drinkable beer, has a lot to give and asks little. Would probably be a great beer to convert someone who is a little apprehensive about dark beers and is not ready to dive into a full on porter or stout."
"A great session ale to go along with Fat Tire, now I just need to get my hands on more of their other offerings."
"D - quite tasty and easy to drink."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a very dark brown color with some ruby hues visible when held to light. The head was tan, one finger thick, retained fairly well and left broken sheets of sticky lacing .The aroma was were malty, roasted, toasty and earthy with some hints of spice. The flavors were similar, rich cocoa, hints of coffee, lots of roasted malt and very chewy in general .The finish was smooth. Mouthfeel was pretty good though the carbonation a touch high for a medium/full body. Very enjoyable and quite wintery."
"All in all a good dark beer. I am typically not a huge fan of the dark beers. I think of dark beers as too heavy but this one went down smooth with almost a chocolate feel to it, it was almost like drinking a milkshake. Overall this one was suprisingly good compared to the 2 below beer that new belgium offers. I will be reviewing that one in due time."
"D- Very good for a dark beer"
"D: Great drink. I seriously sat one night and had three of these in a row despite having plenty of other offerings to partake of. I could drink these all day. More of a winter drink though: The slight chocolatey taste fits perfectly with the current holiday season."
"It has a crazy amount of brown/tan head with some really nice lacing. It has an opaque black color that is true to the name. It has an aroma that is a lot like a porter. It has a deep roasted malt smell it very sweet and not much for hops. It has a roasted malt caramel chocolate taste. It has a wood and nut like aftertaste. Medium almost full bodied."
"Thanks to mugglesandhops for the beer. This had been on my wants for sometime."
"Overall- To me, this tastes like a poor stout, minus body and hops. Of the New Belgium's that I have tried, it seems that they are a bit malt crazy."
"Smooth, slightly thin mouthfeel, with a clean, dry aftertaste."
"Appearance is black, but to the lighter side, with a thin tan head. Aroma is bready, with hints of toasted grains. Caramel like flavors dominate, with some yeasty/bread-like flavors and smokiness in the finish. Very light-bodied and dry. Easy to drink as should be expected. Overall a decent beer for a change of pace but not one to specifically seek out."
"A: A little lighter than the color of a black raisin, the head hangs around on this beer, some lacing on the edges - 4.00, S: Lots of roasted and slightly charred grain aromas, some caramel and espresso, a little yeasty, a very enticing smell - 4.50, T: The aftertaste of this beer is heavy on the toasted grains, some chocolate pudding, mild date flavors, faint signs of Belgian yeast - 4.25, M: 4.00, D: A very drinkable and enjoyable beer, not a style with which I am overly familiar but one I would seek out - 4.50"
"D: So, so. I had heard great things about this beer. I was not overly impressed."
"I'll buy more of this if it makes it to our state. If folks really drank like this in 1554 it couldn't have been all bad."
"D: Big malt and big flavor limit dirnkability, but for one or two, its really enjoyable."
"22oz bottle from a local supermarket. Pours a dark brown crimson, nearing black, with a short-lived puffy white head and strong lacing. Roasted malt notes on the nose, earthy and slightly fruity. Taste is a plummy, bready mix with vegetal hops and a slight bitterness that mellows back to plums or prunes on the back end. Mouthfeel slightly thin for the style i think. Drinks well, especially once its had a chance to warm and release more of the fruit and deeper malt flavors."
"This beer poured a dark cola hue, with off-white head, and lots of lacing. The aroma contained a slight burnt malt essence, and a little bitter coffee. The taste showed a fair bit of bitter coffee, with a touch of floral hops. The carbonation was moderate, and the beer was a bit thin overall. It reminded me of many a brewpub stout that I've had, due to the light body and choco-coffee flavour. Nonetheless, a decent tipple with which to watch soccer and fill the time and soul gap of an airport layover...and cheers to the friendly bartender, ""Meatloaf""..."
"Nice to find this beer as I always enjoy New Belgium's more esoteric offerings. Pours dark brown with a malty, treacly nose. This a very tasty black lager that offers notes of toffee and caramel. Carbonation is downplayed a bit which IMHO makes it even more drinkable. Pairs well with a lot of food and is great for Winter evenings. Nice to see a well made US example of the style."
"Very nice dark color with good persistent head that makes a great lacing. Coffee aroma on the nose, leading into a sweet roasted malt on the palate, and softly hopped on the finish with no appreciable aftertaste. The best thing about this brew is the mouthfeel, which is thick and expands as it moves across the tongue to the back of the mouth. Modestly drinkable, but with this great thick mouthfeel, it's one to be savored slowly."
"D - this is a great beer. This is what my definition of a session beer is. I will definitely be picking up a six pack of this in the near future."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with little head. Very faint aromas but hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste is full bodied with lots of roasted malts. Overall I enjoyed this beer due to its drinkability mostly from low ABV. I could hardly taste the alcohol in this. After sampling this beer, I will definitely check out others from this style."
"Overall this is a decent dark beer. It isn't one noted, yet it isn't very complex. If you are looking to get in to darker beers, or want a dark ale you can drink a few of this is a good starting point. If you like this, then try to move in to Russian Imperials, or one some of my favorites ( Storm King Imperial Stout, or Stone Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout). This is worth giving a try."
"Overall, a pretty drinkable dark beer. Different than the typical stouts and porters. If you're looking for some variety, try this out."
"1554 pours dark with a thick head, not thick like you'd find from a stout, but more like Robin Thicke, Alan's son. The first smell is roasted oat with sweetness. The roasted malt is the dominant taste, touches of chocolate and lingering taste of alcohol. There is enough carbonation to make a good beer burp, but not enough that you would blow down the neighbor's tool shed. This could easily be a session beer for me and I will very likely buy more."
"T - Spiced malt flavoring gives a good initial greeting when first sip is done. The aftertaste is leaves a spiced malty taste with a hint of hops. Flavor is tantilizing black beer."
"Drinkability for me is not that good, I couldnt see myself drinking more then 1 really."
"drinkability is great. a solid 'schwarz' with a nice malt complexity and solid proportioning, this is one dark brew that would do fine as a session brew. cheers!"
"Overall, very interesting. Relatively accessible, but still imposing. I'd try it again."
"This is a very smooth beer and not and a lot lighter than I had expected. This beer leaves the mouth very, very dry."
"Being only my second sampling of New Belgium's lineup I'm looking forward to more. Mothership Wit is in the fridge right now."
"Taste is very much like a porter to me. Very nice dark roasted malt with smokiness and some coffee. Has a nice alcohol level and very easy to drink. Recommended."
"Drinkability is very good. I would suggest this to someone looking to expand their drinking horizons into the world of either darker beers or Belgian styles."
"Not really an instant classic in my book but not too bad either. I dont really think I would buy this one again (unless it was on special)."
"O- Enjoyable and tasty. Worth a shot. One of my favorite NB regular offerings."
"Bottom line is it needed more oomph."
"Overall- this is a great beer. I highly recommend for any fan of a dark beer. One of my favorites."
"What a delicious beer; sweet, but not overdone, just like the Belgians do it. Lacks a bit of the true Belgian yeast character which would add some depth to the beer. But this is a super-drinkable brew, quite delicious - thanks to my tall Texan friend for recommending this one."
"Pours a deep mahogany reddish brown color with a creamy off white head that leaves some sticking. Hearty roasted malts with a hint of earthy nuttiness grace the nose. Very vibrant to the tongue, notes of toffee, brown sugar, chocolate syrup, roasted peanuts, banana, a cake-like yeast note, semi sweet overall in character and a citrusy hop twang mid/late palate really rounds and completes the brews impressive structure. Nice toasty aftertaste. Moderate carbonation and a medium body. The brew has a very traditional and rustic feel about it and is without a doubt well crafted. This is a winner."
"D- This is a very pleasant beer to drink, in some ways it reminds me of Black Lager. Not exactly a session beer, but I'd enjoy having a few more."
"D- It is a drinkable brew. Low ABV with an appealing taste; definitely not offensive at all. I wish it was a tad more bitter, but all is well with this brew."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied. A little too heavy on the carbonation for the style. Very drinkable beer."
"Highly drinkable & tasty. My favorite New Gelium brew, by far. Delicous."
"HV"
"This beer goes down well enough, but seriously leaves something to be desired in terms of complexity. I did not get what I thought I was with this beer. I would not expect this to match the best Belgian brews, but it doesn't even really compete with Unibroue or Ommegang. A lighter, less boozy, more drinkable Trois Pistoles in a six-pack would have been great. But alas. Plenty of people seem to like this beer well enough, so go out and try it, but I think I've had my fill for now. Might be miscategorized. I have a hard time believing Rare Vos and 1554 are the same style."
"D_A fairly different beer. Porter like in most regards yet with a nice yeasty note that one does not find in that style. Enjoyable all around."
"Easy to drink. Good flavor and nice finish. A good example of shwarzbier. Probably will have another some time."
"Disclaimer: I'm bias to New Belgium, due, in part, to their huge support of biking and conservation."
" ~ Thanks to my mother, I'm able to sample the New Belgium brew. She picked up a sixer for me from her local brew store in Lacrescant, Minnesota. I'm glad to have been able to sample this beer. The next time I have one I hope it comes from a tapper."
"Overall: quite enjoyable, absolutely worth a try, nice surprise"
"A unique beer. Kind of a cross between a stout and a brown. It has the flavor of a stout, but the creaminess and drinkability of a good brown ale. Something I would recommend."
"Makes it right."
"This is a mixed bag for me. Nice taste, lackluster body, yet sessionable. A nice option to have when craving something dark and roasty without the heat."
"This is one of my all-time favorite beers. Dark and delicious, this is an easy-to-drink beer any time of year. 1554 has a smooth, creamy, and sweet feel to it. It's also one that I truly miss out here in Massachusetts, so every time I head back to Colorado I pick up a 6-pack or so of 1554."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid beer from New Belgium that is definitely worth a shot."
"carmal and coffiee are the flavors that jump out at me, the malt is nice, light carbonation and the ballance is almost purfict, this is a easy drinking beer that i would buy on a reagulsr baseous if it were avalable neer me, if you find this one get it."
"This is a weird one. It is more like a smooth stout than a Belgian Dark Ale. There is something about the way New Belgium brews beer that imparts a chocolate flavor to their beers. I'm by no means complaining, I really like the cut of their jib."
"D- Pretty easy to drink."
"The big 22 oz. bomber poured three healthy fingers of slightly tan head on a black cherry body; good retention. Fine aroma of coffee and vanilla bean, mild chocolate smell, and a hint of berry. The taste is subtly complex as a nice spiciness (mostly pepper and coriander) emerges slowly but surely, characteristic of a Belgian. Coffee is most prominent, followed by a bit of chocolate. Smooth and delicious with a bit of spicy bite, the mouthfeel is solid. 1554 is easy to drink and quite enjoyable, an unusual but enjoyable Belgian Dark Ale. I'm not sure what Black Ale is, which is what 1554 is advertised as, but this will be something I revisit."
"Thanks again, Russ!"
"Drinkability: A well crafted beer. Delicious, NB has done it again. I haven't sampled a beer of theirs that didn't like. A nice dark ale, when you want something robust, but not too heavy. A nargain Belgian-style beer."
"Three fingers of two toned rocky tan head leaves scattered lace as it fades. Body is what the mame claims = black. Nose is invigorating and zesty laced with lots of dusty, peppery spices and some cinnamon topped pie crust. There is a whole lot going on with this beer right from first sip. Dry attractive spices like paprika, cinnamon, and toasted rye are up front. The body yield biscuity malt that is even and nicely rich. Complex and super well balanced. Sessionable from start right through to the mouthfeel. Very drinkable, I would love to have a six pack of this on hand at all times."
"mouthfeel is nice and smooth, creamy almost, light, a nice low carbonation that just adds to it, very nice!"
"D: Nice sessionable beer, but the flavor is pretty basic. Not the best NB brew, but certainly worth a try and usually pretty easy to find (at least on the west coast)."
"taste is thick, sour malt, some chocolate, roasted nuts, some fruit, some spice, touch of caramel, end is slightly bitter and dry."
"A very nice beer, and one of New Belgium's best offerings that is readily obtainable. Pours a very dark garnet color, which appears close to black. Relatively decent head, but it settles pretty quickly. Nice aromas. This is an unusual style, and I believe I've only had one other- Rare Vos. There is a nuttiness in the aroma, almost like wild rice, as well as a chalky smell. This is followed by cocoa notes and a touch of black pepper and a deep roastiness. The taste is similar, with some very dry malt up front, followed by an earthy bitterness, a dry nuttiness, and a chalky cocoa taste at the finish. A deep roastiness is throughout, and everything is well integrated. The mouthfeel is a bit prickly, even spicy, and bone dry. There is a nice lingering bitterness, but none of that sourness you sometimes get from deeply roasted grains. The whole package is quite intriguing. Some of the chocolate tastes in the beer dry out and become more bitter and dry as you keep drinking. Really a marvel- very different than almost anything else out there. I like it both for its unusual nature and for its simple directness."
"D: Very drinkable for the flavors, lots of different things going on, but it isn't very heavy at all. Great session beer. One of my favorites from New Belgium."
"Prost!"
"It basically resembles a stout in both flavor and appearance, but goes down more smoothly and isn't nearly as filling. Since I've never had one like this, I didn't know what to expect in the way of ""identity."" However, it's a very good beer for what it is."
"Small head goes fast, but leaves good lacing. Very, very dark bron body, but clear for what little light does get through (not hazy). Very strong, mocha-like aroma, but with more coffee than chocolate. Semi-smooth, fairly light mouthfeel, with a little tingly bite with the carbonation. Light flavor at the front, but stronger coffee flavor in the finish. Excellent overall. Extremely drinkable, enjoyable, and very interesting beer."
"D - Overall I think this is a good beer smells and tastes good and its easy to drink definitely a step up from Fat Tire worth trying"
"Poured into a snifter, deep clear ruby in color, light tan head settled fairly slowly leaving some fine lace in its wake. Aroma has some nice notes of toasted malt & faint coffee. Somewhat earthy flavor, along with a faint chocolate note. Mouthfeel is fairly faint, a bit fizzy. A very drinkable, fairly available brew."
"I have had this beer before and thought it was not as good as it has been. So for now this is my score, but I will give it another shot later on down the road."
"I really enjoyed this one. It pours a deep, clear mahogany with a thin beige head. The smell is primarily grain and toasted bread with molasses in the background. Toasted bready malt and chocolate dominate the taste and it has a pleasant slightly sweet finish without becoming heavy in mouthfeel. I wish more American craft brewers would take up this style...and Dunkels, more Dunkels too."
"Overall, I really didn't like this beer. It seemed to have a bit of Belgiany-ness but not much. It may be a good gateway to Belgian beers."
"It is a medium bodied beer. There is some creaminess to it that coats the mouth, but not a lot. The carbonation level is decent."
"D'ability - interesting stuff...like a porter with a Belgian twist. Can't say that I'll seek it out again, but glad that I tried it."
"D-Nice rich flavor, very smooth. Not really an every day brew, could see having every once in a while."
"One damn fine beer. I've always had a certain respect for New Belgium and they are quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. Period. This beer also goes awesomly well with any chocolate involved ice cream."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Great flavor and low alcohol make this beer quite easy to consume."
"I'm going to make this one a regular in my fridge, no doubt. Its extremely sessionable, won't put you out of commission after a few, and taste delicious. At $2.99 a bomber, its an absolute steal. I'm a happy 1554 fan!"
"It comes out of the bottle a deep, semi-transparent brown with a thick, fluffy, persistent beige head. Aroma is strong and mainly smoky, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Flavor is like liquid smoke, with touches of malt, coffee, chocolate and caramel. Texture is smooth, and the smoky aftertaste has just a whisper of sweetness. Well worth transporting all the way from Denver to Atlanta!"
"Overall, I like this beer. I could definitely see myself drinking 5 or 6 in a night. Brings good flavor without being too heavy."
"D - Falling just below the 6% mark, these are good for 3 after work."
"D - goes down real easy and not a hard alcohol. One you could enjoy all night."
"Drink/Notes: This was an interesting beer that borders on being a rauchbier due to its dark smoky nature. I don't think it's one that I would come back to regularly, but it was a good experience."
"Amazing."
"Overall a good beer. I was really glad to see this beer finally in TN. I had a friend bring back a sample the last time he visited CO but it didn't exactly survive the trip back. Glad we can finally get fresh samples in TN & at $2.99 a bomber it makes it even better."
"Pours a dark brown that is clear with a thin creme/tannish head that falls to nothing. Nose is supremely odd. Very much like a porter with the roasted and coffee tones. Flavor is nice and robust, though not overly complex in nature. Again, it hits me like a porter. Roasted and vaguely like a schwarzbier (yes I have had a few different ones recently to compare to). The area it sways towards Belgian is in the feel and the slightly different sweet tone. Overall this is a very nice beer. Definitely worth trying and definitely one of New Belgiums better offerings."
"D: Pretty high. It is smooth and well balanced, I could drink a lot of these, but might prefer a few before switching to a lighter session beer."
"This is my second New Belgium brew in two days, and I like this one better than Fat Tire despite this one not tasting Belgin imo. A fairly unique and flavorful offering for sure."
"Pours a dark opaque brown with a little head that doesn't stay long. The smell is great, roasted and chocolate. The taste doesn't lack, very malty and very crisp. Great mouthfeel, not heavy at all for what you might expect. Very drinkable, a great fall beer but drinkable any time."
"D: Definitely a drinkable brew, I was quite pleasantly surprised and will surely be having again."
"A combination of a low ABV and a subtle flavor make this a decent session beer. Excellent work on 100% wind energy."
"Taste is kinda like throwing some chocolate in Sherry. Esters making things very interesting here. This brew is quite unlike anything I've had so I'm giving it some points for originality. Some of the alcohol notes here remind me of a good milk stout. For 5.5 this beer is LOADED with flavor....you'd think the ABV would be much higher with the first sip. It's not necessarily bad but it does take away a bit from the sessionability of this brew. IT has tons of earthiness to it... Some other berry-like flavors in there and it finishes dry with the dark chocolate on the back-end. APpearance and Mouthfeel are big plus's. May be an acquired taste though."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This bottle was part of the Folly Pack that is currently sitting on the shelves of my local beer store. This beer pours a dark mahogany and shows deep ruby tones when held up to the light. A big frothy beige head ensues after a vigorous pour and dark beige lacing is left on the glass after the beer recedes. The aroma is bitter chocolate and just a hint of java and cream. The taste is a blast of dark chocolate and espresso beans. The mouthfeel is full and crisp, with a drying finish. Makes the mouth beg for more. This is probably my favorite year round, if not any brew that is produced by New Belgium."
"Pours a dark brown until being held to a light it reveals lots of reds,the head is a fluffy tan four fingers on a heavy pour,some thin lace clings on for dear life as it falls to its death(ok i'm being a little dramatic,it looks pretty nice).I had a hard time getting much good from the nose maybe some slight caramel and slightly burnt malts.The taste was big chocolate up front(dark and bitter) with some coffee flavors and some soft sweet vinilla on the finish.A medium body and moderate carbonation are suitable and encourage drinkability,slightly dry finish.New Belgium offerings were just recently made avalible in Springfield,Illinois and so far they have been above average and better than I had expected."
"D: Great session beer. Big flavor low ABV."
"overall, this was a fairly goodbrew that i do believe ill get again"
"An extremely enjoyable Beer. Lots of flavor at a decent alcohol content."
"A bit too malty in the finish for me to have more than a sample. May balance well with a moderately sweet desert or BBQ sauce."
"Tasty beer, pretty drinkable for me."
"Dark brown with good clarity. 1"" beige head that retains well at 1/2"" and plenty of lace. Tons of chocolate and cocoa powder in the nose along with coffee and earthy malt tones. Roasted malt and chocolate (dry powdery chocolate) dominate the flavor. Some dark fruit. Leafy hop flavor towards the finish. Medium body. Low to mid carb. Dry finish. Lighter body than what the appearance indicates. High drinkability. Mich like a dunkel in the fact that it is dark, highly sessionable, and full of flavor."
"Pours a clear dark brown color with less than a finger foamy light tan head that fades slowly leaving a nice amount of Belgian lacing in its wake. Smells like a malty chocolate ice cream float with a mild nutty roasted character. The mouth feel is medium bodied with a significant tingle of hopped effervescence. The taste follows close to the nose. A semi-sweet nutty chocolate with a maltiness that lingers nicely. An easy drinker, so far my favorite New Belgium product."
"Another great beer from New Belgium. I poured from a bottle into a glass. The beer had a good 3 finger foam that quickly collapsed into a creamy froth and gradually fell down to a thin line. The color was a clear, reddish, coffee color. The beer had a malty, roasted smell with traces of bitter chocolate and coffee. It also had a rich, malty taste with a hint of espresso and finished with a mild hoppiness that was clean and refreshing. The mouthfeel was creamy and rich. A very drinkable beer that I will definitely buy again....but then, I am partial New Belgium's products."
"This is one of my favorites from New Belgium. A good black colored beer with a thick tan head. A very roasty nose with lots of black and chocolate malts. Some fruity hops as well. The taste is similar with a big dark malt profile. Faint hops keep the barley from dominating. Crisp medium body aids in the drinkablity. I'm not sure if its a true Belgian dark, but it is quite good."
"This is a fine beer. Probably my favorite of the New Belgium brews I've had. And at 5.5% ABV, a totally approachable and sessionable beer. I could easily put back several of these in a sitting. It's great because this is the kind of beer that could easily attract craft beer neophytes and satisfy the experienced palate of a BeerAdvocate at the same time. Well done."
"D-A simple yet complex beer that is sadly missed from the normal offerings. This makes for a GREAT session beer and wakes up the tastebuds and reminds you that these hybrid styles can create wonderful changes from the everyday IPA or Stout."
"A very good beer. Poured from a bottle with Best By 11/08 on the label, the beer was a very dark brown with red highlights. The head was off-white and thick, and dissipated fairly quickly. I wasn't too impressed with the aroma, sweet chocolate, not much else. The taste, though, made up for the relatively mild aroma. Fruit, chocolate, a little coffee and roasted malt. Easy drinking, and at 5.5% ABV, one could put a few of these away."
"Poured into Chimay glass. Not quite black but dark brown, with a creamy but short lived tan head. Very light lacework. Aroma is a blast of fruit and chocolate, plus coffee and nearly burnt toast, lightly buttered. Taste is a delicious blend of chocolate, coffee, toasted grains...sweet with a very light bitterness, just enough to balance it out. Nice, easy mouthful, medium to light bodied with smooth carbonation. In my opinion this beer is as good or better than a lot of pricier ones out there."
"A very drinkable brew. Also a great beer for introducing newbies to the darker styles with its mellow creamy qualities versus more in your face roasted qualities. Also sessionable, and would be well suited to quaffing with friends on a warm summer's eve. While not particularly challenging, this is one tasty mellow brew that is easy to drink."
"Very solid effort-sessionable but flavorful."
"Pours a dark brown, with ruby highlights. Two finger off white head dissipates quickly, but laces all the way down. Aroma hits with chocolate, coffee, some dried fruit and a little barnyard funk in the background. Taste is creamy chocolate, some fruit and some caramel. Full body, creamy mouthfeel, just enough carbonation the tease the tongue. Great tasting brew, not sure I'd call it a Belgian Dark, but tasty just the same."
"Drinkability- Great beer, very sessionable."
"Thanks again, Jhammerly."
"1554 pours quite dark with a large, foamy, light tan lid. Scents of softly sweet chocolate/toffee along with dark fruits and a touch of belgian yeastiness. Much of the same in the flavor along with some nutty earthy overtones. Very nice mouthfeel with lots of soft and creamy carbonation. While I've not had many of these this one seems pretty good. It's quite light but retains a nice flavor and an excellent mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: excellent beer and easy to drink with scents and tastes that are well defined and alcohol that takes a backseat."
"Mouthfeel is thin, finish isn't very dry for an unsweet beer. Carbonation is a touch heavy. Pretty decent drinkability."
"Poured a deep brown with little carbonation or head. Sweet malt and roasted aroma dominates; some fruit there too but it was subdued. Body was medium-to-full, and quite a bit of roasted flavor though it didn't contribute as much to the bitterness as would be expected and had hardly any astringency at all. Leaned to the sweet side but not overwhelmingly so. Mouthfeel was nice. Drinkability is much better on tap!!"
"Drinkability: This is one very quaffable beer. Perhaps the beer I'd pick to chug if I had to pick a darker beer in color. The alcohol is somewhat apparent softly at all times, but in no way gets in the way of the drinkability."
"Drinkability: Decent drinkability. The complex roastiness may inhibit some people."
"Drinkability is pretty nice, I could have a few of these in a sitting."
"D- Overall a great beer. Decent complexity to the flavor, nice creaminess, and not too alcoholic. I could definitely drink so more of these."
"This is an all around nice session beer. It's not overly complex, but is pretty enjoyable and I think they did a good job with this one."
"Smooth texture, feels light and airy. Lightish bodied with lively carbonation. Seems like it just melts off my tongue. This has great character and is a very pleasant drink. Quite enjoyable."
"Smell is of nice caramel malts, some mocha, hits of chocolate. Taste follows through with the aroma. It is a nice rich beer with taste that are followed by a clean finish. Bubbles are just right making this beer pleasant on the palate. Very drinkable."
"This is my favorite New Belgium brew, maybe second only to their springboard seasonal."
"D- Nice session beer. Certainly makes me feel good about my homebrew that tastes very similar."
"Pours virtually black but when held to light has a brilliant clear ruby color to it. Two finger head with good retention and some lacing. Smell is a bit bland. Has a wheat and yeast smell to it, some roasted grain. Taste is pretty good. Some chocolate, almost like bakers chocolate, a touch of caramel and some grassy hops. Pretty light feeling and medium carbonation leaves a somewhat crisp feeling. Overall a pretty drinkable beer, easy on the ABV and not terrible in the mouth."
"D: Easy to drink and interesting flavor, if not especially tasty. I enjoyed it, but probably won't seek it out much."
"D - Very much so."
"D - Goes down fairly easy despite some flavors that could easily become overbearing. The yeast notes interact with the malt flavors in a pleasant way, but by the end of the glass the syrupy caramel flavors begin to become cloying."
"D: Decently drinkable, but the backstory is more interesting than the beer."
"D: This was a very good beer and definitely got me interested in New Belgium again. The first selection I tried (Fat Tire) wasn't the greatest but this was excellent. Now to find it in Michigan :)"
"Drinkability - would definitely like to try more, finished the beer before I knew it, pleasant experience"
"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass."
"D-I could see myself putting a few of these back. Not as incredibly complex as I had hoped, but very drinkable."
" Mouthfeel is light and bubbly from the carbonation. Very flavorful but light and low abv. Nice session beer for drinkers of stouts and porters that want a lighter feeling beer but seek some of the same flavors."
"I drank 1554 last night and don't remember it being so sweet. This is a unique beer, very complex malt character. It has a very low hop profile, which seems to be appropriate for style. The sweetness was overpowering though and made it somewhat difficult to drink. I do enjoy the malty aroma however."
"Black pour with a cream colored medium head that fades very quickly for a dark beer. Smells of coffee, dark roasted malt, a touch of licorice, and some alcohol. A fairly unique nose out of a blend of seemingly common scents. Taste is very smooth, creamy, rich, dark, and roasty. Very nice taste overall. There is just a touch of bitterness, and I actually wouldn't mind a bit more, which is something I've never said about a dark beer before. A really nice , very easy to drink richer beer and one I would recommend and buy again."
"This doesn't quite seem to go along with other Belgian dark ales I've had in the past, but it's still an enjoyable beer -- it fits somewhere between a stout and a Schwarzbier. Though it's nothing exceptional, I'll certainly get this again."
"This beer pours a black color. The head is small, and recedes quickly into almost no lacing. The aroma is of smokey caramel, with a hint of dark chocolate. The taste is like the aroma, but not quite as pronounced. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and mildy watery. The carbonation is high. Overall, this is a decent beer. I would drink this if it were the best thing available."
"D - Pretty good. It is a mild and enjoyable coffee porter - not an archetypal Belgian dark ale for sure. Worth a try, and I am likely to enjoy the whole six pack. I recommend."
"Found this beer to be quite quaffable. Pours with a tannish head atop a...well, black/brown beer (hence the name). Malty with a slight hop presence but not overpowering. I found it drinkable and a good choice for those friends who have experienced Fat Tire and are willing to move on to bigger, bolder territory."
"Not a very complex beer, but pretty drinkable."
"I expected more. Not a very complex beer, for being 500 years in the making."
"The 1554 pours dark as night. No foam head and no lacing. It has an aroma of roasted malts and chocolate. The flavor is dry and has is strong chocolate overtones. In the mouth it is fairly thin and leaves it mark on the middle of the tongue. It is a very smooth brew that I could drink six no problem. It has a number of similarities to a porter."
"Served in my maudite snifter. Poured the color of night with a thick, dense off-white head that dissipated into a thin skim of foam; very little lacing present during the tasting. Fruity esters, yeast, malt, coffee and maybe chocolate. Strong flavor of coffee with earthy undertones. Pleasant mouthfeel, not too watery and not too effervescent. Reminds me more of a porter than a belgian dark ale, however."
"The 1554 is a brew I pick up a bottle or two probably 10-12 times a year when I am getting a mixed New Belgium 6'er. Does not strike me as a BSDA.. definately on the right track, but there is something European missing."
"By the end of the 22 oz bomber, the flavors are harder to discern, and the beer becomes a little less inspiring. On the right occassion, a 12 oz serving would be do me fine, though."
"poured out a nice dark brown-deep red color, not really black I must say, but looks very tasty none the less. aromas are somewhat faint, yet I pickup trace amounts of smokiness, very light rauchbier scent. Taste is not overwhelming, slightly tart with some smoke on the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy, yet has a somewhat acidic biting finish, no stickyness remains. nice to drink,good winter session ale."
"good carbonation. full bodied. leaves a little lace. folows style. i really dig this beer. my favorite from this brewery. good session beer. will drink again."
"I picked up a bottle at a grocery store in IA to bring back to OH, as New Belgium isn't distributed out here yet. I guess I expected it to be similar to a schwarzbier, but this was much better. It was fruity and yeasty smelling rather than roasted and nutty. I'd place it closest to a dubbel if looking for a style, but Belgian Dark Ale works well too. The after-taste is very nice, with a hint of anice in the finish. To date, this is my favorite from the brewery."
"D: Very good. There was no face cringing. There was a light carbonation feel that was not in anyway ruining the experience for me."
"Goes down nicely...Very easy to drink this beer...It was 1 degree tonite and I spent most of the night out in the snow...getting home I spent a few minutes chipping ice outta the wheel wells of the Prizm...Coming inside wifey had a pork roast on...and this beer was a nice cap to a cold, frosty evening..."
"nice beer. reminds me of goose island x-mas ale a bit. and i really like that! worth revisiting, especially in the winter months."
"Again the dark malt is the star of the show here. The lack of spice and wild tastes commonly associated with Belgium style beers is surprising. This seems like a Schwarzbier to my palate. It is light bodied with good carbonation that matches well. It has a nice semi-dry finish that encourages more consumption."
"This beer almost immediately reminds me of a schwarzbier (German black lager) for its mellow and smooth chocolate character. Incidentally, that also means that when the flavor is nice, it's not terribly big. You just have a sweet chocolate malt flavor with a roasted edge to it. I might suggest this to anyone new to beer and looking to try a tasty dark beer. It seems to have an easy-going mouthfeel and mass-appeal."
"Thanks again bditty, glad to be able to enjoy this one."
"D - This is pretty good, but I can't really see what the big deal is. It seems like some sort of Schwartzbier/MilkStout hybrid, and that ain't a bad thing, but I guess I was expecting something a little more Belgian and complex. I think that if this was called New Belgium Milk/Sweet Stout (maybe porter?), then I probably would have rated it closer to a 4 or higher. But nothing about this brew strikes me as Belgian or ""ancient."""
"While I am not all that familiar with this style, after reading the style characteristics profile, I think this seems to fit into it pretty well, with the possible exception of the very short lived head retention. The flavor, while decent, was not as complex as I have come to expect from a Belgian style brew, and the beer was surprisingly thin on the palate. Overall, this was nice to try, but I doubt that I will be seeking it out again."
"d: Great finish, very smooth, definite session beer and a great crossover beer for those scared of anything too dark to see thru."
"This is a great session beer. Would make a great crossover beer for folks afraid of the dark. Well done!!"
"Smells nice, malty, roasty, dark chocolate, a bit of bread, and perhaps a hint of black cherry. The taste is harder to pin down, but does have the typical New Belgium bready biscuity background but supported by a deeper malty quality. Chocolate is not apparent in the taste to me. Mouthfeel is very smooth, medium thickness and proper carbonation. I tend to be a sucker for dark beers like this, but this is another well-crafted nice-tasting number by New Belgium."
"I was not impressed with this beer. Not recommended."
"One of my favorite New Belgiums and beers from Colorado. Overall fantastic. It truly is an enlightened black ale as they say, not necesarily dark in all aspects, but most of the good parts."
"Overall an easy drinking brew that is smooth and enjoyable. Flavor is on the lighter side, but is interesting with the roasted malt and earthy qualities. Certainly worth a try."
"I guess that I expected something along the lines of a Schwartzbier, but got something richer, more complex, and nicely intriguing. Aromas begin with a mild roast character woven around caramel, toffee, and lactose sweetness. Mild tartness, earthy / peaty, nutty notes round out the scent. The beer looks dark brown with a mild murky look, well headed, and overall rich looking. Tastes are big on the caramel / toffee / praline sweetness, but the added complexity of berries, chocolate, wood, and must make the beer decidedly better. The mouthfeel seems full because of the varying flavors and creamy carbonation, but the beer finishes quite light and drinkable. Simply a nice beer with tons of complexity and not a gravity bomb -- good to see. Thanks BMock."
"Not an astoundingly complex beer, but a nice alternative to the typical brown ale."
"Pours a nice deep brown with some reddish tones to it, topped off with a thin light tan head that doesn't ever go away, and leaves a little lace behind. Malty aroma with a little roast barley and Belgian yeast notes in it. Just a hint of malt sweetness in the flavor, perfectly offsetting the draw between hops and roast grain bitterness. A slight prickly sourness from the carbonation playing at the sides of the tongue that helps keep this a mild and refreshing quaff. If it weren't for a kgrtr full of other interesting bottles to try and four kegs of homebrew, I'd be disappointed I had only one bottle of this. A definite session beer, even if does top the magic 5% ABV number by a few tenths."
"Nice looking beer, dark dark brown, with some kaki tan head. THis is a nice easy to drink dark beer. This is a good intro for someone wanted to get to know dark beers. One of my favorites from New Belgium. A good after dinner beer, with come chocolate."
"Pours a super dark molasses with a nice 1.5 finger light khaki head that slowly dies down to a nice layer. Stickiness is pretty good, spotty here and there. Smell is roasted barley, smoked nuts, french roast coffee, and a tiny bit of caramel malt. Taste has some dark chocolate with mostly smoked malt. Aftertaste is woody with some espresso flavors. Mouthfeel is a smooth creamy medium body with just the right amount of carbonation. I really didn't think I'd like this beer, but I was quite surprised. To me, this was very similar to an oatmeal stout, just smokier. Definitely an enjoyable beer, pick this one up for sure if you get the chance."
"D- This beer is a nice dark mysterious ale that went excellent with fresh baked chocolate chip walnut cookies. There were nice dark malt flavors but they were not the bitter stout qualities instead there were some nice dark Belgian yeast qualities."
"D: Interesting style, with nothing to keep me from drinking a bunch of these."
"An interesting beer. I think it would be better with a touch of Belgian character, but it is what it is. Nice brew."
"Comment: I like several of the products from this brewery but did not expect to enjoy this one nearly as much as I did."
"Zum Wohl!!!"
"Try this beer. Great session beer even. Like someone said, it would pair well with food."
"All and all, a good beer. Very pleased to see NB in Iowa. I would rank it similar to Fat Tire, that its a good beer but not outstanding overall."
"D: No raves in any category, but very easy to drink. Smooth flowing with a cleanness and soft carbonation that keep it quite quaffable. A tasty beer, worth a try."
"This is a very good beer, and I can't say I've tasted anything quite like it. Glad I picked it up."
"New Belgium 1554 was a dark red-brown color with a nice light tan head. The head had good retention and left some nice lacing behind. The aroma was toasty dark malt and chocolate. The taste was about the same with a little sweetness upfront and a dry finish. It was medium-full in body with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a good ale and I'm very happy to finally find it in Iowa."
"Got a sixer from some friends who were rolling through Colorado. Pours a mahogany color with two fingers of tan head on top. Looks solid. Coffee, roasted malt, and light astringency are the nose. Roasted malt, some sweet chocolate too. Flavor is very mild - light roasted malt, spices, molasses, and some light hops at the back end. Body is medium with solid carbonation. This one's a solid, tasty American version of a Belgian dark, but not really exceptional. I do like it more than the other more popular New Belgium, Fat Tire."
"[Served lightly chilled, in a tulip.]"
"Pours a light brown head with a good strong lacing. The color is dark, but when held up to the light you can see through it has a purple-ish brown color. The head went down fast into almost nothing. Smell has chocolate, licorice, and roastiness. It reminds me of a spicy schwarzbier. Taste is soft and nice, like licorice with the roasty backround that's easy to drink. Mouthfeel is very nice, very smooth and enjoyable. Overall, this is a very good beer that I would love to have again."
"Medium bodied and slightly dry, couldn't really notice any carbonation until the finish. This beer tasted great and was pretty refreshing."
"Big creamy tan head produced by a cascade effect. Black bodied with reddish-brown light hues. Head leaves a big trail of lace on the glass. Caramel and chocolate on the nose. Somewhat roasted malt, mostly chocolate with caramel in the backround. Some bitter hop in the back, but the malt dominates this one. Full, creamy mouthfeel. Chewy. Quite wet. Not a bad brew."
"D: An interesting style, would describe it as an intermediary between a stout and a schwarzbier, its light flavour makes it easily drinkable, not a great beer, but I enjoyed trying a historical Belgian style."
"Pours from a bottle that looks to be from belgium, a nice touch. Pours a rich brown color with a 2 inch head that quickly fades away to a thin layer of light khaki color brown. Smell is of a nutty, and cocoa flavor. Smooth malt taste with again the nuttiness. Decent carbonation make this an enjoyable smooth drink."
"Not something to be had as a session beer, not even a daily thing, but a delicious occasional beer."
"What an interesting brew- very complex and a treat for the tastebuds. Pours a dark mahogany with vanishing head and some carbonation. Aromas were of hearty roasted malts, a hint of hps and a yeasty sour note. The flavor was slightly smokey like beechwood, very earthy and it intesifies the roasted malts. Alcohol is there but very slight, and the sweetness of the malts hides it well. Finish is slightly bitter, and clean, probably not even from the hops, but the combination of malty goodness. I wouldnt have guessed it be of belgian origin, but nonetheless its a good historic brew."
"Drinkability- At 5.6%ABV, this is an easy drinking beer of a style I love. It makes those that can get it very fortunate that it comes in 6-pks. Unfortunately, here in Ohio, it can't be obtained. I am a happy camper knowing I still have another 4 for a later date."
"This is probably my favorite New Belgium beer (though I haven't had their Tripel in years). I'll get this at Old Chicago, but I think the bottle actually tasted better than on tap. A good variety of tastes in one glass."
"It's just what it's supposed to be."
"This is interesting enough. I'm just branching out from my AIPA wheelhouse, so I don't feel like I got burned or anything...Worth a try if you're at all interested."
"Why is this rated so high?"
"I like this beer and could drink a lot of it. It seems close to a porter in flavor and mouthfeel, but with a hint of something else."
"Thanks to acme for the bottle!"
"Drinkability of 1554 is excellent. A tasty, deeply-flavored beer with an ABV in a range that would allow you to enjoy more than one without being sloppy. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up when you see it."
"Taste has a rich, choco-malty profile and a slight touch of hops. It finishes with some coffee and liquorice notes. Compared to the small town Montana selections, 1554 knocks it out of the park. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, perhaps a bit too light, with a good carbonation level and a nice bitter finish. Overall, this offering from NBB is complex, tastey, and amazingly drinkable. Hard to ask of more from a beer."
"Drinkability - this is excellent ale and totally sessionable."
"taste: malty... i can barely detect a slight hop presence in the aftertaste. very faint secondary flavors, but again, not bad. ultra-smooth and ultra-creamy texture - fair amount of carbonation. goes down very easy, but is creamy enough where i'll probably switch it up after one 22 oz bottle."
"This is a great beer, very refreshing, I'll be getting this one again"
"I've had several of these over the past week, and I have discovered something I don't like about this beer. It is very much lacking in body (I think that is the term I am looking for). While it's flavor is quite good, it still has a ""watery"" feel in the mouth. Perhaps this is what some people mean by it being lighter than they thought. It could use some work in this department: I am drinking a dark beer, and I want it to feel like a dark beer."
"D: This was an excellent surprise. I hadn't tried it before and I hadn't read any reviews prior to me trying it. Fantastic! Dark without being too heavy, light and refreshing enough without being too weak."
"The mouthfeel is somewhere between a high-medium and a low-full. There was lots of carbonation dancing on my tongue. This beer is pretty drinkable, but I wouldn't be able to handle that strong coffee roastiness for too many of these."
"Quite honestly, if I'm going to drink a brown, first comes Surly Bender, then this. Yes, probably my second favorite black/brown/Belgian Dark ale."
"My girlfriend didn't like this beer at all so on the girlfriend scale (this is my own scale 1 = worst & 10 = best and is purely subjective), I give it an 8 because she didn't pucker up and spit it out. Had she done so, it would have been a 10."
"Overall: I liked this beer quite a bit, I thought it was a solid quality brew, but felt it didn't have any thing that ""wow-ed"" me. With how drinkable it is though, I can see how it could really grow on you. Sweet malty but toasty brew with a few layers of flavor."
"Poured from the bottle, this is a beautiful clear dark ruby color with a minimal white head and little or no lacing on the glass. It smells mildly of caramel. The taste is of caramel with overtones of plum and toasty black malt. The mouthfeel is thinner than I expected, yet this ale is surprisingly crisp, refreshing and easy to drink. Nice one."
"Drinkability: This is a great beer that match up against some strong food flavors like grilled wild meats or hearty sausages. This is a sipper, though it does not have an overt alcohol presence. Nicely done."
"Drinkability is very high."
"D - Very drinkable for a dark ale - has many similarities to a porter in terms of taste and mouthfeel. Not sure about the ""Belgian"" elements as it is similar to other American dark ales / porters that I've had in recent years (e.g. Black Butte porter). I don't consider myself much of a fan of New Belgium (Fat Tire is average at best) but I would drink this beer again and woud recommend it to others interested in a decent dark ale."
"Okay beer, nothing too bad but a little lacking in the flavor department (NB calling card...)"
"appearance is a dark rich brown with a thick creamy head. Smell clean dark roasted malts and dark fruits. Taste of sweet roasted malts, dark fruits with a slight smokiness to it. Mouthfeel has a creamy medium body with good carbonation that goes down smooth. A very good black ale, but something I would better enjoy more towards the fall."
"Pours a deep brownish black with crimson tones. Medium creamy-bubbly tan head; relatively heavy lacing. Aroma is milk chocolate, cream, caramel, toast, and distant spices. Mouthfeel is lightly fizzy and silky  heavy-medium body. Flavor follows suit with deep malty chocolate, light sourdough notes, roast, light charcoal, and very distant spicy hops. Dark sweet fruits (raisin, date, fig) in the finish; sweet aftertaste."
"D - A great dark ale with none of the cloying heavy trappings. This is a quaffable, sessionable brew along the lines of a schwarzbier, but with Belgian character. An ale that is easy to drink and worth having as a compliment to sushi grade tuna, shellfish or by itself."
"Do not be scared to try this beer because of its color."
"Prost!"
"I have found this beer to be better served just slightly chilled and poured into a glass. This beer also compliments steak and some seafood very well."
"Cheers."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are smoother than I expected."
"yes, i love this beer. This beer rocketed to #2 on my top 5, yes i'ma young'un so far but this beer is great. I love the darker beers. The barkeep at my pub recommend this beer and i loved it. Smelled like a sweet-raosty-hoppy aroma to it. And the bold flavor went down tasty as hell. This is a very enjoyable beer and i highly recommend it."
"An odd but highly enjoyable dark ale. I've eagerly consumed all three given to me in a trade with chadspivey. Thanks, man!"
"The only downside here is the carbonation - with such a relatively thin body, I could do with a notch less carbonation than what's here. Without the carbonation, it would be practically ideal. But a damn fine beer regardless."
"Drinkability- Very sessionable. Not really suitable for day-time drinking, but very interesting."
"Mouthfeel was tongue tingling and medium bodied."
"This was a fun and unique way to measure up different styles of beer against each other. Check my previous reviews to recap what you missed here in the Unorganized Invitational. Good night everyone!"
"D: A Belgian beer that is remarkably similar to a baltic porter. The lager yeast really makes this a good beer."
"Pours a pretty dark amber color with lots of carbonation. Smells of roasted malt,apricots, and chocolate. Taste is complex, chocolate again with more of a nutty taste, alcohol is barely present, little to no hop detected. Mouthfeel is full and mildly thick. drinkability is also good."
"The bottle has a drink by date of 01 jun 07, so it is still fresh. A deep brown body with ruby highlights on the edges, no head at all. Good smoky malty smell with a little sweetness, like molasass. The taste is light molasass with a slight bitter chocolate. It has very little carbonation, but that lets more of the taste sit on my tounge. This a good drinkable beer. This review is really weak."
"It was nice to try this style, as I had never seen it before. It's not my favoriate, but its worth trying at least once."
"M&D - moderate body and supremely smooth, a very nice beer, man, ive been trying several New Belgium beers lately, and they can really brew a beer, easy down and so mildly sweet, very inviting, makes me want to move to Colorado"
"Carbonation on the light side is nice, but the medium-bodied mouthfeel is otherwise nothing to write home about. Drinkability? - I could drink (several of) this at any time of year, for any occasion. Nicely done."
"Medium to full bodied mouthfeel makes this one tasty brew. After receiving lots of NB beers in a recent trade, I have noticed that most of them have some similar, bready flavors. This one is no different. Nice drinkability and as the beer warms, more chocolate is revealed. The last of my two 1554s. Thanks again Vancer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, I could drink a few of these in an evening, but I think this is a beer that would work better if you were to have two or three after dinner or as a slow evening winds down. Its not quite a sipper, but I dont think I could drink enough of them to call it a pounder either. However, its still a very good beer."
"D - For the seasoned stout drinker this is very drinkable. For the novice, it may seem to be enough to have just one."
"Medium body, low to moderate carbonation. Great balance, very clean, smooth, and highly drinkable. I've been drinking 1554 for years, and honestly this is probably the best one I've ever had."
"Overall a very good beer from New Belgium. They have several varieties I like and this is one of my favorites."
"This is incredibly drinkable, a real session ale. I paired this with a few thin mints, whoa was that killer, could've ate the whole sleeve!"
"D - Due to the lower ABV and strong flavors, this would make for the perfect Belgian Dark session beer...I could have easily had quite a few of these and not tire of them."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, lower ABV makes this one (dare I say) sessionable. Probably one of my favorite New Belgium beers that I have had so far."
"D - not bad, not bad."
"I was referred to this beer by my brother, as it is one of his favorites. I put it off for a while, and finally broke down and bought some. Maybe I should have waited longer. I poured it into a glass, and the thin head quickly dissipated and disappeared altogether. I will say the coffee-black appearance was quite appealing, as I prefer to not be able to see through my beer, but that's all it really had going for it. This was my first black ale, and it tasted very much like a lighter bodied smoked porter. The label said something about a chocolaty flavor, but I was getting more of a smoky flavor than anything. It was really lacking in the body and mouthfeel department... a little more maltiness and body and this could be a winner. Until then... next!"
"T/M/D- thick rich body...dark chocolate...coffee in the finish....light bitterness with a slightly resiny dank mouth feel. The beer actually gets a lot more flavor as it warms up. Medium-heavy with mild carbonation. Very nice....I really feel that this is the New Belgium beer that everyone should be talking about."
"Poured from the 12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Body is a deep dark brown with reddish brown highlights when held up to the light. Light tan head is very small, receding to a thin ring in moments. Aroma of sweet dark malt, a touch of molasses, some dark fruit, and just a hint of dark chocolate. Palate is mostly dark malt up front, with a bit of sweetness. Notes of dark fruit and chocolate come through after a few sips, with a bit of tangy Belgian yeast making its presence known on the finish. Body is rich and creamy throughout, leading to a dry finish. A nice change of pace, this fairly unique ale is both interesting and refreshing."
"What an experience this beer was. Two or three of these in front of a roaring fire and I'd be in heaven."
"The bottle says black ale, but it is just really dark brown. Plenty of light gets through when held up to a lamp. It pours nicely with a thick one inch mocha colored head. I smell chocolate, fruity, burnt, and sweet malty aromas. I taste heavily roasted malts with good amounts of residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is somewhat lacking in my opinion; I wish it was a little more full bodied personally. The drinkability on this is decent. I don't know if I would search it out, but I would drink it again."
"edit: I poured this in a wine glass today to see if it had a better appearance, and yes it was incredible. It had insane retention and head that stuck."
"This is a nice drinkable dark ale. Not really that heavy, but still with some nice tastes and aromas. This could be a good session brew."
"Not bad, but could be better. Complex array of flavors, but overall fairly light. The taste is very nice upfront, but soon quells. Most the sips I took were too watery. It doesnt assert its malt and hop presence strong enough for such complex flavors. Could have more of a carbonation bite to it, it goes down too fast. Incredibly similar malt characteristics to Fat Tire and 2 Below."
"The taste starts with tounge-bracing burnt grain and then coffee and milk chocolate smooth things over, blending with a pronounced nutt flavor and well-played hop bitter. Once again that baked feeling comes out in the aftertaste, on the heels on New Belgium's signature toasted character. Mouthfeel starts light but fluffs up in the mouth with a burst of carbonation. Kinda cool. This is a must-try for any fan of schwarzbier. It isn't nearly so mellow, but you'll love the flavor."
"Although deceptively light in body, 1554 has a full mouth feel and a nice mouthcoat. Carbonation is low-moderate."
"Exciting find from a very unsuspecting source. The smell is very faint, but is reminicent of toasted malts and grains. The taste starts out just like a mexican malt beverage, with not a hint of alcohol and a syrup-like finish. The toasted malts and grains are very apparent in the second taste, and it comes across much like a stout with a light body. There is also a nutty presence that comes from the specialty grains and serves as a wonderful finish to the taste. A good beer, although nothing that you should go out of your way to find."
"Pours a deep brown with ruby hues along with a thin, frothed milk khaki head that settles to a ring. Smells of black malts, dark roast coffee, with an overall clean and faintly fruity body. Basically a schwarzbier with faint fruitiness. Taste is a good representation of what is present in the nose. Roasted flavors with a bit of chocolate thrown in. Overall very clean. Slight hints of fruit. Mouthfeel is medium in body, with a creaminess to it. Carbonation faintly pricks. All around, a solid beer from New Belgium."
"Virtually black with a cream colored head. Head shows decent lacing. Nice malt aroma with a touch of roasted notes. Flavor has a nice malt profile with smooth roastiness and a touch of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is full without being thick. Nice presence on the palate but then it finishes rather clean with a touch of malt flavor. Dinkability is fantastic. Such a well-balanced beer; it goes well with food or just for having several in an evening. Great beer. This is what I expected quality-wise from New Belgium when i first tried fat tire."
"In my opinion the best of new belgium's offerings."
"Good stuff here. I'm anxious to try more New Belgium stuff, and while this is very good, I have a feeling this brewery has even better to offer..."
"Pours a luscious dark brown, almost black, with a coffee foam head that lasts. Very fruity in the nose (raspberry, strawberry), with hints of malted chocolate and underlying mocha roasted malts. On the palate, sour fruits come out first, followed by vanillin malts. Robust carbonation, but not overly sharp carbonation. The finish is a touch on the sour side, almost like a Flemish brown. This beer is exceptionally smooth, with some unexpected flavor combos (raspberry/roasted malts), pleasingly sour fruits, and a malt base that makes the whole thing solid. Wonderful beer; easily my favorite from the regular New Belgium lineup."
"Good stuff, I like it as a once in a while drinker."
"Different from both Porters (which it resembles in color) and Bocks (which to me it resembles in color and smoothness), but trying to pin it down is pretty hard. Truly one of a kind. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: A superb outing from one of my favorites. New Belgium has a warm place in my heart, because they're the first real micro-brew experience I had about 10 years ago when I had Fat Tire for the first time. If there is a perfect Belgian style session brew, this is it."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It is no surprise that i am going to say that this beer has hints of chocolate and some kind of like espresso bean. Poured our a dark brown, nearly black. The head was a good size not too big, not too small. Just the right amount. One of the best beers i had to date."
"I couldn't drink much of this at one sitting. Still, it is a pretty nice brew. I am with delima."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink with just enough complexity to make it interesting but low enough in alcohol to drink a few"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle wiht best before date. Was an almost black color with mahogany overtones. Had a little head that went away quickly. Good carb. Smell was heavy on chocolate and coffee. The mouthfeel was awesome - nice and chewy. Loved the taste. With the chocolate and coffee, I expected a bitter aftertaste but there wasn't any. Goes down incredible smooth. Could easily turn into a session beer. Highly recommend you try it. Another great beer from a great brewery. (4.5, HR, T,Y)"
"I like to try a new belguim when I get the chance, a good choice indeed."
"This is a drinkable beer. I think it is better suited for late fall and winter, so Ill probably cellar three bottles until then. This beer is very much in the style of a porter or a winter warmer."
"Simple, roasty, and good."
"This one surprised me. Well done!"
"A deep brown with dark highlights of a sunset in the center. Too dark to see the bubbling though. A mild film of lacing is left behind in my Leffe chalice. A strong mix of earth and light coffee bean and some intermingling mochas hit the nose. This is the most coffe like Belgian ale I've ever had. Very unique take on this style of beer. Very roasty character. Never confused with smokey or toasty in this beer."
"Very nicely done. Probably my favorite of all the readily available year-round New Belgium selections. Refreshing, yet full of flavor, and unique. Give it a shot if you haven't already."
"Cheers!"
"I've had this Dark Ale for a few months now in the fridge and opened it up at our Homebrewers meeting tonight. Many enjoyed it, until realizing I did not make it. Anyway, nice dark (but not black) color. I wanted to try more becuase it has some nice spice and caramel flavor and smell. It sucks that I won't get my handson this for a few more months."
"The mouthfeel and taste were nearly identical to a good german bock. If it was truly a 1554 vintage Brussels back ale where was the yeast sediment? The flavor imparted by a little yeast would have added a bit of complexity that was lacking for a beer of reputed Belgian origin. I doubt they had filtration back then and the beer would have been cask conditioned. The beer was good, and was quite drinkable even on a very hot sultry Houston Sunday sitting outside. The head retention was in the average range. All in all it was a good but not exceptional beer. Anyone expecting something like a belgian ale would be disappointed. Think of it as a good American interpretation of a classic German Bock."
"D - I'd like to try this one on tap sometime. Not a beer that I would necessarily drink over a long period, but still a better than average dark ale."
"This beer is complex but doesn't have enough ""volume"". I may not buy another one, but I won't turn one down either."
"The first thing you really notice when you pour this beer is it's color; dark, excessively dark, it honestly looks like im staring into a black abyss from the side. It maintained its slightly brown frothy head rather well. It smells very heavy, very much like a strong cup of coffee with just a tinge of alcohol and maybe just a little cocoa, but when the head died down it very nearly smelled like a good cigar. No real heavy hoppy smell like with most beer. The very first thing that came to mind when I drank it was the nearly overpowering coffee taste, it was good, but I didnt really like it. Then on my second drink I noticed a very slight tobacco taste, not disgusting, actually quite suprising, then I noticed a very very slight chocolate taste, just underneath the tobacco. It honestly is one of the smoothest beers I've ever tasted, its almost like velvet on my throat. One very interesting thing to note is when I smoke a pipe while drinking this beer; it brings the chocolate taste right to the front, even above the coffee, creating an extremely satisfying beer experience."
"Pours a very dark brown, with a nice creamy head that leaves a nice amount of lace on the glass. Smells like roasted malt with a hint of cocoa and some fruity yeast, a hint of alcohol, no hop aroma. The flavor is mildly sweet, toasted nuts and cocoa, with a little bit of a tang on the finish. Mouthfeel is velvety and smooth, I like it. Definitely a good session beer, really well balanced and quite drinkable. This would be a good stepping stone for introducing someone to darker beers."
"My favorite from New Belgium thus far. A solid beer."
"-Goes down very easy. Would probably prefer a bit more alcoholic strength just to give it more warmth in the belly. I'd say this one would be best experienced when paired with savory dishes."
"D: Highly drinkable offering from New Belgium. Good smelling, tasting, with an overall light body thats refreshing. Recommended if you can get it."
"Not bad, but unfinished."
"D-Good beer but somtimes inconsistent. Light with not as much character as one would expect when staring into the depths of it's darkness. Worth a try but not on par with what one would expect of a ""Belgian"" Ale."
"Had on tap in a pizza place in Canon City, CO. This arrived as an opaque, very dark brown with a lingering thick tan head and okay lacing. Good malt chocolate aroma. Flavor followed the malt chocolate theme, yet not real dominant. Body was fairly thin, which led to a watery finish that was not that enjoyable."
"D: Very tasty, this and Abbey are my 2 favorites from New Belgium."
"D: Best New Belgium beer I've had to date. Its hot as hell outside yet this dark ale is refreshing but bold enough to not be boring."
"Opened a 12 oz. bottle and poured a dark brown with red tints liquid. Head was modest and did not stick around long. Aroma was very earthy (fresh turned soil), mixed with malt sweetness (caramel) and some coffee. Taste was malt, bittersweet chocolate, and coffee. There was a good bit of hop bitterness at the finish and some pepper. I was not crazy about the mouthfeel, body was medium, and it was drying and seemed overly carbonated. I was surprised by the amount of warming I felt given an ABV of 5.5%. I felt that it was fairly drinkable, but not terribly thirst quenching. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this was a schwarzbier."
"D - It is a very drinkable dark ale. I think it is an affordable alternative to Belgian brews."
"Drinkability- very easy to drink. Very good beer I could easily have a few of these."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Almost black color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Slight caramel nose. Starts as sweet/roasted chocolate, Slight bitter finish. Nice dark. Best before 10/2006. $1.69 for a 12oz bottle from Hi-Time Cellars Costa Mesa, Ca."
"For a long day traveling it was a smooth, dry brew with light hints of black patent malt. Very refreshing! I would drink another one of thse if I could get it in NH!"
"D - Drinkable. Very tasty, could drink a few of these. A very nice brew from New Belgium."
"Another solid brew from NBB..."
"Deep dark brown that hints at ruby. Thin off white head with ok lacing. Big-huge black malts dominate smell and taste. A blend between a Schwartz and a Belgian Dark? Sweetish of the brown sugar variety. Medium bodied. Mild acidity and medium to assertive chalkiness. Drinkability is low for me. Too malt driven and sweet yet uncomplex. I would prefer a real Schwartz or a more complicated Belgian. This one is stuck in the middle."
"It's easy to imagine myself sitting in a Belgian inn half a millennium ago quaffing this beer. Hats off to NB for this fine specimen."
"Overall a spectacular Belgium black lager that I definitely must try fresh from the motherland of Ft. Collins. If you like Kostritzer, you'll love this. Top notch."
"Modest carbonation suits the style well and gives a lovely mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable in quantity and an excellent and flexible companion at the table (another is doing very well with a wild mushroom lasagna as I type). A staple in my DBF. Best before October 6, 2006. Bottle 6 from a 6 pack."
"Dark, almost opaque, reddish color, little head. The nose on this guy is weird... barbecue, definitely, and kinda portery. Barbecued Ommegang, though that doesn't cover all of it. Smoky. I want to eat this, not drink it! Taste is smoky and charred. Coffee. Bitter. Un-sweetened cocoa. Lots of stuff. Harmonizes pretty well- it's deep. Mouthfeel is striking- sudsy and light, frothy and chewy- teeth-licking, lip-smacking good. Drinkability- good for the style, but I can see it being too heavy for more than a couple. This would be a nice night cap."
"Not nearly as sweet as many other examples of the style... which is kind of a good thing. Quite dry. Those that enjoy stouts and porters (maybe even brown ales) are likely to find something to like in this. Toasted, sweet caramel flavors, with an underlying smokeyness defining this brew."
"Drinkabilty: This beer is definitely distinct and has a lot going. It's pretty malty but seems well balanced and built."
"Pours a thin black with garnet highlights under a finger of rocky tan foam. Nose starts off with a blast of lactose, succumbing to bready/toasted malts and a whiff of roasted coffee. Taste starts off, like the nose, with a light yogurty lactic sourness, followed by toasty barley malts and flickers of nut and cocoa. Mouthfeel is light and drinkable. An interesting beer in an interesting style. All the roastedness of a schwarz with the sourness of a Flanders. I wish I could get New Belgium stuff out here, a very innovative brewery."
"This is one of the best American Belgians! This beer is welcome in my ice chest three out of seven days of the week. The color, the smell, the drinkability of this brew is top notch. I feel so akin to this brew that on occasion I call it De Grog. But be for warned, it's 5.6% can sneak up on you."
"I did not care for this beer too much really. it poured very nicely, and a very nice rich black color. as far as smell goes... its hard to say, I've never had a beer in this style so I'm not sure what it should smell like. That in mind, it had a very old fashioned smell... at least what I think a beer would smell like if it was made in 1554. (granted the only reason I think that is cause I read the label I'm sure) The taste was the same. it was a bit too rich and smokey for me I fear, but if that is your thing I would say get this beer. I would imagine it does a good job at its style, only I have noting to compare it to. But, New Belgium never let me down before (this) so you may like it."
"An incredibly drinkable beer. Try it!"
"A good beer from NB and a nice departure from what we think of as ""true"" Belgian beers."
"I believe this is my first Belgium Dark Ale. I thought it was an Irish stout when I saw it. It's got the same ultra dark look with a solid two finger tan head. It was definitely not as sweet as say a Guinness or Beamish, so I guess I should have had an idea that I was drinking something of a different nature. It was very smooth, to the point of being watery, but not unpleasantly so. I found it quite drinkable. If you ""kind of"" like stouts but feel the taste is too much for you, try this."
"Notes: Seemed like a stout but whatever, style classification is not important, what is important is it was uninteresting."
"Served on tap, arrived with a nice fluffy head of off-white foam, about 1/2 inch with nice retention. Color is dark black but held up to the light can be seen right through. The aroma is a bit faint, toasty and chocolatey, with a hint of coffee. The taste has notes of molasses and chocolate with a nice toasty, almost slightly smoked flavor. It's like a porter, but not. Interesting. Alcohol seems low. The mouthfeel is not overly thick, it goes down very nicely with it rich smoothness. I have always enjoyed 1554 for its drinkablility. It is a great dark beer, but its certainly not heavy like many darker beer tend to be."
"More like a sweet (not dry) swartzbier."
"Another great find at the bar waiting for my wife to finish up in the national bowling tournament. My 1554 arrived in a pint glass with a slight head, good lacing. Translucent brown color. Taste has great malt-to-hop balance. A sugary sparkly taste, finishes sweet and tangy. Not high viscosity like a stout but with stout like characteristics, although sweeter. A true pleasure to imbibe."
"A nice Friday afternoon sipper on this most perfect of April afternoons. Poured into my La Chouffe tulip damn near black as advertised, glowing hints of ruby beneath a thin ring of lace. Herbal grassy hops and coffee in the nose. Flavor imparts a subtle spiciness, from the yeast I presume, but mellows and becomes sweeter with notes of nuts, coffee and dry, grainy wheat. Toasted almond aftertaste lingers on the tongue with just enough balance from the hop bitterness as well. Certainly is not lacking in carbonation - a bit fizzy. Nonetheless, a flavorful and enjoyable brew. Schwarz + nut brown ale = this. Nice."
"The beer departs the 12-ounce brown bottle a deep ruby brown, the modest in size head is semi-creamy, the color a nice light tan, and after dematerializing, the lace forms a thin sheet upon the glass. Nose is rich in malt, hints of caramel, fresh and clean, start is slightly sweet, the grain profile adequate. Finish is pesky in its acidity, the hops apropos to the style; chalky dry aftertaste lingers long on the palate, a drinkable beer."
"pours very dark with very little head but maintains it. Smell is somewhat burnt with some sweetness to it. Drinks very smoothly and is not too carbonated. Taste is kind of earthy and toasted. A very fine offering from New Belgium, too bad it isn't sold in IL!!"
"Pours what appears to be black, but as it is held up to the light, a dark brown reveals itself around the edges. A decent head that retains well and slithers down the side after each sip. A burnt, sweet aroma, maybe some chocolate undertones. Toasted malt, that lingers ever so lightly on the tongue, rounded out by a touch of sweetness. Nice carbonation makes this very drinkable. One of the finer offerings from NBB."
"This is a good beer not fantastic, but a very well rounded beer. New Belgium seems to put out a remarkable line of beers. Cheers!"
"Thanks ColoradoBob. This is a mighty fine beer. I loved every sip."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Very Dark! Nice creamy slightly tan head that left a nice lace all the way down. Smell... slightly sweetish malt smell. Tast.. Had a very slight sour tast to it. After taste was a little off as well.. I'm guessing that i am a dyed in the wool hop Head, and need to stick to IPA's"
"Highly recommended--a unique and fun beer."
"I enjoyed this ale. There wasn't much of a head on it, but I don't mind a slightly flat dark ale. I hate over-carbonation. The smell was nice with roasted maillard notes and caramelization present without being sour. The taste was much the same. I found it to be very drinkable due mostly to a nice non-astringent mouthfeel."
"This was a very different beer and definatly worth a try."
"Purchased one in California recently. Was very excited at the prospect of drinking it; especially after reading the overall favourable reviews in BA. Poured to a very dark brown/black with minimal lacing and retention. Deceptive in its appearance especially after the first sip. Very thin for such a dark looking ale. Perhaps I was expecting something more substantial. Fairly palate friendly, but I feel the dark malts needed to be a little more roasted to keep up with the look. New Belgium products are not available in my neck of the woods, therefore have not been weaned on them. Having said this, I was a touch disappointed with the experience but would still recommend this to my friends"
"Overall impression: Definitely one of my favorites from New Belgium. Drinkable, but still complex and flavorful."
"Had this one during a flight of New Belgium beers with a friend who had brought some back from a trip to Nebraska. Poured this one into my favorite New Belgium snifter. Minimal amount of head with some subsequent lacing. Aroma of slightly burnt caramel. A little black coffee on the tongue with some butter as well. Taste is alittle dissapointing and the mouthfeel seems a little thin. Compared to the rest of the flight, it suffers a little in comparison."
"-UF"
"Sweet musty, malt aroma. Dark brown with a thumb thick mocha head. Very porter-like in appearance. Full malt flavor in the fore. Some mild roastiness is present and there are, to me, some very porterish asspects except that this is sweeter and far maltier. Sort of a scwarzbier/porter mix. I get some mild molasses notes in the aftertaste. Very satisfying brew."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" brown head above the clear dark burgundy brew. Head lasts well, with plentiful sticky lacing. Aroma is dark grain with a light hopiness. Taste starts hearty yet sweet, with the taste buds eventually sorting out the roasty dark malts, and ends with a light hop character. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft over the tongue, and drinkability is high, only limited that the sweetness may get overbearing after awhile. But I'd take a few, I would think. I'd like to make certain, if the opportunity came up."
"Incredible complexity in both the nose and flavor of this ale. Almost stout-like, but the lighter body and Belgian candi-sugar sweetness reveal its Belgian sensibilities. With such a low ABV and major flavor and smoothness, this is one drinkable ale."
"Feels to be medium bodied, and with the earthy finish, was quite dry and as such I think this is something that could be consumed in quantity."
"Dark brown, almost black. Held to a strong light, russet highlights come through. Modest tan foam cap. Aromas of sweet malt, some candied dark dried fruits (prunes, mostly), and grassy hops. Black roasted malt flavor up front with a cherry-fig middle, and earthy-grassy hops rounding out the finish. Smooth mouthfeel, medium body. Quite easy to drink. Belgian black ale? Works for me."
"Poured into a nice New Belgium glass that my wife bought me for Christmas a few years ago. This beer poured a nice deep brown, almost black color with a 1/2 inch but thick tan, almost caramel looking head. The beer had a malty sweet aroma with some spice tones in the background. The taste also gives a good malty sweet taste that is complex but very drinkable for a beer that is so dark. Another quality beer from New Belgium"
"Drinkability  This is good drinkable beer. I recommend it."
"Nice, deep mahogany color. Not quite black but a lovely, deep drown. Nice tight head. Good aroma-some roasted malt, slight burnt toast smell-somewhat grainy. Great roasted malt flavor. Sort of a blend of toffee/coffee going on. Nice mellow sweetness to the finish. Great body to match the flavor-very full and soft at the same time. Fantastic beer. I wish I could get this locally-I could see it being my go to beer. I just want to gulp this down. Extremely enjoyable."
"If there's ever a session beer from the belgian-style beers, this one will work! Cheers!"
"Bottom line: Here's an unusual style of beer that has a lot of good things going on....I recommend it!"
"It's always a treat to sample a recreation of one of the older, historical styles such as this. Thanks to mntlover for bringing this bottle by. Pours a very dark mahogany body with ruby highlights. Head quickly falls to a lasting film and some spotty lace. Body has excellent clarity. Aroma is roasty malts, with notes of chicory nuttiness and a prominent Munich malty character. Mouthfeel is light medium bodied. Taste is dominated by roasty dark malts, with notes of scorched coffee, bitter chocolate, and soy sauce. Hops and yeast contribute an understated earthiness. A hint of black cherries adds a welcome fruitiness. This is a dark ale that defines its own style. Tastes more like a Schwartzbier than a Belgian Dark Ale. Very well crafted and a pleasant sipper. Another fine brew from the folks at New Belgium."
"Taste was strong roasted malt that gave way to more sweet chocolate, but not too much. Hops made an appearance towards the finish. Little aftertaste, enough to want more. Just rich enough flavor to make it special, but not too rich to rate it unique."
"This drinkable beer goes especially well with roast pork. I'd love to try it fresh on the tap right in downtown Ft.Collins."
"Overall i like this beer a lot. Seems like one can be enough, but i could drink a 6pack in one night. Very drinkable."
"The fiance brought this back with her after a recent business trip to San Francisco, bless her heart. Anyway, this one poured with a thin, tan, creamy head and was almost black in color, but you could just make out a ruby red hue. Great nose; very nice charcoal, smoke, chocolate, and plummy notes. I was shocked to find the beer only medium-bodied on first sip, surely I was expecting much thicker. Some toasty malt and touches of spicy hop bitterness exist. Overall, there is more of a caramel aspect than a chocolate one in my opinion. The aftertaste is somewhat bitter with a more roasted chocolate taste than the body. Some sweet licorice is in there too. I'd have to say this brew seems to be lacking a bit of sturdiness, but still a fair offering."
"cheers..."
"That which we call a schwarzbier by any other name would taste as smooth.... The low score here is strictly due to the wrong style parameters - don't let it stop you from trying this nice beer."
"The pour is dark burgundy with a beige head that goes from barely there to a thin ring of lacing in no time at all. The aroma is roasty with brown sugar, fresh coffee beans and esters. The taste isn't nearly as sweet as the nose. There's chocolate, coffee and a hint of smoke with a rough roasted finish. I believe this is the first Belgian Dark Ale I've tried, but this reminds me a whole lot of some of the schwarzbiers I've tasted. This might not be the most exciting brew, but it's solid and drinkable."
"Opinion: This is no doubt one of the better beers to come from New Belgium. I am at a bit of a disadvantage as I have never had a Black Beer in Brussels, so I dont know if this beer is to style. It is malty like a schwarzbier, but has a lot more fruitiness than the German styles. This is a pretty good beer nonetheless."
"This is a very pleasant beer for winter evenings and gains my hearty recommendation."
"Exceptionally solid beer. This was my first Belgian Dark and honestly I can't tell it from a Schwarz."
"Thanks to John B. for bringing me the bottle."
"Drinkability: Just a little too complex to enjoy more than a few a session."
"T: The taste was roasted malts with a very nice hop finish. A medium mouthfeel and body, and a very drinkable beer. A surprising find and a beer that I would return to the next time I'm lucky enough to find it on-tap."
"Drinkability  This is an exceptionally drinkable beer. I highly recommend it. Dont let the color fool you into thinking you cant have several of these in a night."
"Drinkability is ok a decent little brew want to thank the fine ba's who sent this to me and B&G BIF."
"This ales pours a beautiful black with a very fine carbonation and a caramel head. It has strong coffee and caramel flavors and a mouthfeel that liberally coats the tongue. It also has a surprisingly refreshing taste. From the look, youd think it would have a strong alcohol bite but it has a very balanced flavor. I also love the story behind its creation. Definitely one of the collection."
"Overall, this beer has combination of tastes not found in an ordinary beer. It's nothing exceptional, and probably not for eveyone, but it's tasty enough in its own right. It's a great beer for a crisp October night."
"Solid brew. There is a bit of sweetness which might turn some away as far as sessioning goes, but the sweetness could also interest those who consider themselves non-beer drinkers. Also, this beer comes highly recommended on tap as it thickens up and smooths out the mouthfeel."
"Not much head and a black coffee like beercolor. Nose is lots of black candy, chocolate, oxidated sweet but good maltyness overal more sweet then burnt nose impression. Taste is full, tasty and sweetish but not overdone. Lots of cacao powder, burnt but not overdone and a good ""black""taste overal. Aftertaste stays long and is slightly burnt and gets backing from some bitterhops. Mouthfeel is missing some freshness but low carbonisation and good taste make a quiet good overal impression. Drinkability is though it's not my favorite beerstyle good. The beer is easy drinkable and enjoyable to me."
"Very clean, smooth, refreshing and very easy to drink. Don't let the color scare you, give it a try."
"A beer I could drink a lot of. A really solid go-to beer if it's available in your area. It's one of those you'll always think ""I should get this more often"" immediately upon trying it."
"I would drink this again as a session beer but the reality is that it does not really meet my expectations of a Belgian dark ale. It is like the Belgian dark ale ""light"" in reality, toned down for the wimpy American palate. Nevertheless, it is good and pleasant, and a fantastic transition beer, much like fat tire. New Belgium is seemingly the middleman for stone, alesmith, and rogue brewing companies, grabbing the swill drinkers and bringing them closer to the good side."
"Schwarzbier here not a Belgian Dark Ale! Not a bad beer at all here but I like the German version better."
"Pours deep brown, opaque, with a very short brownish head. Good lacing throughout. Lots of chocolates dominate the nose, along with toasty nutty coffee notes. Taste is well balance, good semisweet malts with cocoa and coffee flavors, rounded with bitter hops. Smooth, semisweet, bitter, very nice. If I didn't live clear across the country I'd have a lot more of these."
"It is a great beer, but not something that you can drink all night because it is a bit heavy."
"Tastes like chocolate flan! There'e quite the lively carbonation that's not small and fuzzy, it's large and assertive. The beer is surprisingly light for the color helped by the tingly mouthfeel. Not a huge aftertaste, so it's appreciated by the macro crowd I'm hanging with. I really like this for easy drinking. It fits in with brown ales maybe moreso then a Belgian definition."
"Drinkability: While it's virtually indistinguishable from a number of stouts and porters out there, it's much better than I would have expected. Genuinely good beer, a nice surprise."
"Love New Belgium- wish they'd make the date code more readable to my old eyes- the kids said this was 121605, 4 months out."
"Just a note: I drank the second bottle with a bananna/peanut butter/honey/cinnamon sandwich and it rocked!"
"This poured a deep brown to black with mild orange highlights. It was topped by a 1 inch tan head with decent carbonation. The head left a nice sheet of lace on the side of the glass. The aroma reminds me of many amber or brown ales. Primarily malt up front with toffee and caramel, followed by a bit of roasted malt. No real hop note in the aroma. The flavor comes across with the same mixture of caramel and roast malt. There is a mild nuttiness to the flavor and just a hint of citrus hop on the finish. Slightly more pronounced bitterness than I expected. It has a smooth, slightly oily mouth feel and a good drinkability."
"Finally got to try my first New Belgium at Soulard Ale House in St. Louis, and the choice was this one because they were all out of Fat Tire. But this does not disappoint. A deep brown beer with a stouty head. Very estery like a dunkel weizen. Smoothness almost cancels out roastiness. Despite being average in ABV, it had a good alcohol burn, too. And the lacing leaves nice, regular rings down the entire length of the glass."
"Nice aroma, dark appearance, dry, yeast, aggressive carbonation. Roast, chewy, malty. Thanks Tim (IPFreely) for sharing. Quite good and drinkable,cocoa, mult-dimensional and it all comes together in satisfying drink and aftertaste. Nice Belgian style."
"All and all this is a rather good and interesting beer that I'm glad to have daily access too. I will be getting this again."
"D: This is one of my go to beers when I need to bring a six pack of something to a party."
"This is a thick, black, chewy beer! I first tried it on tap at Chili's, where it is on tap (see my review) - and had to try it in the bottle to see if it was as good. It was! Poured nice and black with good beige foam, lacing that never went away, roasted chocolate malt, medium carbonation, and thick mouthfeel. Minimum hops. Hint of spice. Similar to Young's Double Chocolate. Great with food, with a nice malty, bitter finish. I was amazed to find it was as good in the bottle as on tap!"
"This is a great black ale. The color is very dark amber. Aroma is nut and malty and sweet. Head is lightly colored for such a dark beer. Very full malt flavor with a bit too much carbonation in the taste. Finish is smooth with no bitterness (which I like). Similar to Newcastle Brown but fuller in flavor. This would be a perfect brew if not for the slightly excessive carbonation taste. One of my favorites."
"New Belgium's 1554 pours a black body with gleaming mahogany and ruby highlights beneath an average-sized head of creamy light tan foam that holds well and leaves some very nice lace about the glass. The nose is roasty with chocolate and coffee-beans (not brewed coffee...). It's smooth across the palate with a moderate carbonation and medium body. The flavor is exactly as the nose suggests with the addition of some rich caramel notes and a very delicate touch of grassy hops in the background. It's just slightly spicy, and a touch acidic from the dark malts; and these combine with its sublime bitterness to balance it very nicely. It finishes with a lingering note of roasty, dark-chocolate accented caramel. Quite nice!"
"Comments - If asked to describe this beer, I would say it is a cross between Fat Tire (bready tasting amber ale) and a diet porter. It's pretty good stuff."
"taste: baltic portery. coffee finish. more sweet than bitter, which is a surprise to me considering all its other characteristics. chocolate covered cherries is my first sense memory here. depressingly light mouthfeel though.. still pretty drinkable. never had a 'belgian' like this."
"The taste begins very malty (wonderful malts!!), nice yeast flavor, lots of different flavors blending very well. Hints of oakiness suggest an old ale thus living up to its 1554 name. It finishes with lots of toasted maltiness. Very good brew and very interesting."
"This beer pours a mahogany color with a tan head. The head fades somewhat quickly, leaving very few laces. It smells malty. There is a caramel aroma to it. It has a slight yeasty smell. It also has another aroma that I cant put my finger on. It has a sweet taste to it. It has a fruity taste to it. There are very subtle hints of chocolate. This beer is carbonated just right. This is a full bodied ale. It leaves a malty aftertaste on the palate. This beer would make an excelent session beer because it has a low alcohol content. Also, the flavor is not aggressive or strong. It is a well balanced ale that is definately worth a try or two. If this beer was more readily available, I would probably have a stock pile of it."
"The appearance is dark with a light ruby tint and a small off-white ringed head. Smells of berries. The aroma is one of the most stunning scents I've experienced from any beer. The taste shows hints of gently roasted barley malt, kind of like a very light porter, combined with a berry sweetness. The brew has a thin kind of body to it and seems to finish somewhat wet. A very interesting beer."
"Flavor is smokey, roasty, maybe burnt coffee,toffee with some caramel thrown in. finish is short and roasty coffee like."
"The taste was closest to an English brown ale, with some burnt characteristics of a porter creeping in. Lot of nutty malt sweetness, tempered only slightly by the aromatic hops. The mouthfeel was slick and oily. An easy drinking beer for sure."
"By the way, though not significant, the bottle I poured tonight read ABV of 5.6%. And . . . did I mention it's smooth?"
"1554  Musta been a good year, cause this frosty is damn good! Pours just like a porter (dark brown w/ruby sides, frothy brown head, nice lacing), but a really different aroma and taste to it. Doesnt have much of a hop or malt backbone, but an earthy, grainy, grassy aspect to it  almost woody. Still very smooth with a lite to medium body. Good winter or summer beer."
"Pretty darn good."
"This is a decent offering by New Belgium. It has that syrupy/plummy smell and taste like many dark Belgian-style ales seem to have. I'd buy it again."
"12 oz bottle obtained from Westminster Liquor (Colorado) in Jan 2005 and consumed that same evening. Review from notes. Poured a 2-finger tan head over a dark brown clear liquid. It was dark mohogany when held to light. Smells caramel and roast grains...coffeeish and toffeeish. Sweet and enticing. Tastes roast to start then chocolate and toffee. Very sweet and wet. Hopping is minimal. Medium body and fine carbonation on the front flat and sides of my tongue. Freshness date was 18 May 05."
"Pours a light brown foamy head over clear very dark red liquid. The nose is roasted barley and light coffee. The coffee also carries thru on the taste, nice roasty notes and subtle hoppiness blend together well although I'm hard pressed to see any Belgian connection here. Still a nice beer nonetheless. Finishes up with a touch of chocolate, sorta sweet, nice carbonation. Well done."
"My first New Belgium thanks to bif 14 and ninjaworm. Pours a mahogony glossy color with a creamy head that dissipated quickly. There were nice malty, roasted, spicey aromas. There was good solid malt profile and soft toasted, woodsy flavors with plum and raisin flavors. Slight noble hop finish, rather dry on the pallate. A nie beer that I would enjoy regularly and use to advance quality beers to non ba's"
"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this since I'm usually not a fan of Belgian styles, however this tasted unlike the few Belgian dark ales I have tried. 1554's appearance is dark black with ruby highlights. Head size is about average. The aroma isn't very strong and consists mainly of light malt smells. 1554 is primarily a malty beer, hops provide only a balance. The present flavors are primarily light chocolate and maybe dark fruit taste. This is very refreshing for a darker beer, something that I could easily drink in summer sessions."
"Pours a ruby-black huw with a little bit of a cocao head that is fleeting. Smells of roasted grain and chocolate. Taste is similar but with a bittersweet finish and citrus aftertaste. Mouthfeel is decent..slightly thick ut not syrupy. Only slightly effervescent. Drinkability is good but drops sharply as the temperature rises and more burnt/sweet notes come out. Nice,though."
"This one pours a brown color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is only roasted malts. Really nothing else here. The flavor has the roasted malts but they are much subdued. Maybe a little chocolate in there. It's like a watered down porter. Odd. Not bad, but I won't go out of my way for it."
"Not to far from being a session beer but is to heavy but very drinkable."
"This beer pours deep amber brown color with a finger of head that falls to a quarter inch. The nose is full on roasty malts. Some coffee, some chocolate, but all roasted. It smells nice. The flavor is too grainey for my liking. I would expect more roasted coffee and dark chocolate. There is a hint of the roasted character in the finish, but not as much as I want. The feel is a little thin, without much carbonation going on in there. Overall, the beer is just a bit lacking, but its not to bad. I don't think I would have it again, as there are other dark beers that are better."
"A deep mahogany/red color with low co2, and a light brown rocky head. Lacing is sticky and head retention is low. Aroma is acerbic and malty with a metallic background. Tastes lightly sweet at the start, with dark fruits, caramel with a metallic dry finish. Palate is medium bodied, creamy and lightly effervescent. An enjoyable Belgian style ale. One of the better New Belgium brews."
"Drinkability- My fourth or fifth New Belgium beer I believe. All have turned out at least decent. Another impressive brew. Props to New Belgium."
"Probably my least favorite of NBBC's brews. While good, it doesn't hold up to the other excellent brews in the lineup, and the warm ferment imparts some off-flavors."
"A nice Belgian ale, I would be hard pressed to categorize this, but it is quite enjoyable."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a garnet hue with a fleeting tan head. Roasted nut and chocolate malt smell. Light to medium bodied. Has a semi sweet chocolate flavor with roasted malts. Finishes with a wheat toast taste on the tongue. A pretty tasty brew whatever the style. My favorite of all the New Belgium brews."
"Overall, very interesting. Would accompany sharp cheeses, dark breads, and rare meats well. Although it's not a stout by any stretch if you don't like the style you might not care for this either."
"Taste is all over the place. Spicy like cloves or nutmeg. Roasted smokiness in the malt. A tropical fruity flavor, like kiwi or mango more so than apple or citrus. Also a crisp bitter hoppiness through out, especially in the finish. Medium bodied and crisp with smoky chocolate bitterness that lingers and turns into a sticky maltiness. I enjoy this beer alot, lots of different tastes happening here. Good show."
"Overall a good clean and enjoyable beer."
"The predominance of candied sugar took away slightly from the mouthfeel and drinkability. Overall, a prize."
"Pours a nice deep dark brown with mocha head. The smell is very rich and caramel and dark ghiradelli chocolate linger, in the distance is a nice floral hop just enough to balance the smell. The taste is dark but not to rich, light but not to light, a nice light caramel and coffee taste with a floral hop present, dark mixed berries linger on the tongue as the malty sugars go through, very nice."
"Overall: This would make a great session beer. Very easy to drink that's full of flavor, but not overly complex."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Dark mahogany brown/black with a velvety tan head that lingers in a lacy topping. Rich chocolate notes are contrasted by slightly sharp hops. The flavor is rich chocolate like a chocolate cake or brownies near the edge where its almost, but not quite burnt. Very rewarding, but not heavy or overwhelming. Very drinkable."
"I first had this at the 2002 Tour de Fat in Lawrence, Kansas. It surprised me, and I've liked it ever since. Unfortunately the Tour didn't come to Lawrence in 2004 as they have streamlined it and there are fewer events. Too bad. It was great to sit outdoors, listen to live music, and enjoy various New Belgium beers on tap."
"Finishes clean, and not bitter."
"Appearance: Deep dark ruby brown, black ale indeed forms quite nicely with a big creamy bubbly tan head leaves behind thick broad scattered patches of lacing. Aroma: Full aromatic robust notes of chocolate and dough very nice with the bread notes coming from the yeast addition to the bottle, fruit notes also are detectable beneath the lucious layers of chocolate very enjoyable. This was the first New Belgium brew I ever had earlier on in my advocacy and it's still just as impressive. Taste: Creamy milk chocolate waves with lucious yeast ripples very nice overall flavor goes very smooth hints of coffee mainly dark chocolate notes touch of fruitiness, highly enjoyable. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied creamy textured good stuff even soft carbonation very Belgian like. Drinkability: Incredible all around dark ale I like the history behind this brew and I wish I were able to more readily enjoy this as a go to, thanks to Marc77 for the sample."
"Bottle: Poured a dark colored beer with a medium head with good retention. Aroma is comprised mostly of roasted malts with some subtle spice mix. Taste is quite different from what I expected and I would described as a mix between a dry stout and a Belgian ale. Roastiness is prevalent but you can still see the Belgian inspiration in this beer. Body is above average. Overall, this is a fine drink and I applaud the fact that the brewer tried to brew something different."
"2"" of creamy tan head, lots of sticky lace that caps a nearly black body. Chocolatey nose, slight hops. Taste is nearly porter/stout. Very chocolatey flavor, a very good beer. The hops finish is a perfect compliment to the carbonation levels."
"Overall Impression: A mild black beer, true to the Schwarzbier style. A nice summer change of pace that lends some of the darker aspects to a lighter beer. Quite drinkable. The beer grew on me as I got deeper in the glass. First blush was a bit underwhelming, but the complexity began to win me over. Im glad I got the 6 pack!"
"This 'low weight' allows you to drink it a little faster and not feel overfull."
"Pours with a caramel and brownish head. Velvet bubbles sit well on the top of the head with smaller bubbles sitting delicately on top of larger bubbles. The aroma is sweet with notes of caramel and flowers. Taste is of a dark roasted malt like a stout with the balance of a porter. Chestnut flavors hidden in there too. It's not overpowering and it leaves you hanging at the end."
"A very, very good beer. One of my all time favorites."
"Very drinkable!"
"ng"
"Poured from the tap at Woody's in Fort Collins, Colorado. Dark brown in a monster-sized mug with a very thin, light brown head. Toasted malt taste with faint chocolate notes finished crisply. Hops were faint to almost absent. I am unfamiliar with the ""Belgian Black Style Ale"" but was quite impressed with this selection. If you have a friend that you are trying to introduce to stouts and porters, this may be an excellent intermediate. Even if they never find the pleasure of a well-crafted stout, they will never forget their first 1554."
"This dark ale poured a clear, very dark chestnut color with creamy, tan foam that clung to the glass and left some lace. The smell was malty with some caramel and cocoa, but no sweetness. The taste was malty with notes of cocoa and hints of caramel. There were elements of roasted malt and mild hops with a touch of sweetness and a hint of smokiness. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth with medium body and medium-low carbonation. There was a light, lingering malty taste. This was a decent beer and was very easy to drink."
"It has a very creamy and rich feel in the mouth very pleasing."
"Somewhere between a porter, stout, and some kind of hybrid belgian style schwarzbier. I really enjoyed this stuff, and would definitely get it again, if only New Belgium would distribute it somewhere near the tri-state area. Pretty much a roasted malt beer, but containing enough complexity to make this an interesting quaff even after a couple pints. Thanks to BDitty for the bottle!"
"I probably had this beer about a year ago and wasn't impressed. Some maturation in my palate (or maybe more awareness of freshness dates, I'm not sure) has changed my tune. I'd have no problem sharing a 6er with a friend, but I don't have any friends who would like this (oh well, more for me)"
"This is a very enjoyable beer. If you get the chance, get this beer. Thanks Brian (nvsblman)"
"Overall a good beer. A lightly roasty dark ale with a bit of Belgian flair. Big thanks to bditty187 for the bottle!"
"Reminds me of a crisp Kostritzer. Pretty good."
"Pours a clear deep, deep amber color and is topped by a light brown head that starts out a good 3 inches thick. The dominant aroma is of toasted malt, it is joined by perhaps a hint of caramel sweetness, and lots of biscuit type aromatics. This beer has quite a smooth body that goes down quite well. It is lightly sweet. The finish laden with notes of toasted malt, that is not quite approaching a roast character. This beer is quite malty overall, though it is balanced by a dark fruitiness that reminds me of cherries, raisins, and perhaps a bit of fig.. This beer could definitely use a bit more Belgian yeast character, but that is perhaps a wee bit of a shallow complaint, as this is a great session beer as is."
"This beer was poured for me, and was not poured with much of a head (maybe it really doesn't have much?). It had a rather sweet smelling aroma, and initially, I really didn't get much flavor from this beer. It was served rather cold, and just seemed very average. The color was a semi-dark brown, and clear. As I always try to do, I let it warm up. BOY was that a GREAT thing to do. Please do yourself a favor and let it warm up. Some wonderful freshly roasted barley flavors came out and it became really quite interesting and tasty. It really almost tasted like food, and in this case, that was a good thing. I rated the drinkability higher than anything, because that was a huge part of this beer."
"s.d."
"An enigmatic offering from New Belgium that is both complex and simple, a beer that can be sipped or gulped."
"Thanks to New Belgium for brewing something different. I haven't seen too many black ales. 1554 is pretty good beer, all things considered."
"This dark red-brown ale poured a head that dissapated pretty quickly. Amongst the malt I detect a fruity undertone, pretty interesting for a dark beer. Upon first taste one gets hit with a heavy dose of roasted malts balanced in with a sweet hint of spice and a dry finish. This would fit right in with all the other holiday brews. Not an overally heavy mouthfeel, kind of thin, this beer offers a little bit different twist to the old palate, a nice little brew."
"Overall: I tried this for the first time on draft during a recent trip to the Papago Brewing Co. with the legendary Gusler. I enjoyed in that format, as well as this. Difficult to say whether I really enjoyed it or not, its different and decent, and kind of reminds me of a simple Dark UK Mild with some dark sharp roasted hints."
"Deep garnet-brown in color with ruby highlughts when held up to the light. A tan, creamy, two-inch head sits atop the dark liquid but quickly dissapates. Although the head disappears, there is very nice wispy rings of lace left behind. Toasty malt aroma with dark fruit and a hint of chocolate. Nothing grabs the front seat, but the flavor is a harmonious blend of roasted grain, chocolate,brown sugar, coffee, and vanilla. A mild hop bitterness keeps the sweetness in check. Medium in body, smooth and refreshing. It is like a brown ale, but lighter."
"This is an interesting beer. They call it an ale, though I believe they use a lager yeast and then ferment it at ale temperatures. It almost reminds me of a schwarzbier with some fruit overtones to it. It is ruby-black with tastes of bitter chocolate and some licorice. It is somewhat sweet in the body, but it finishes clean."
"Deep and very dark brown, I want to say its black but its not, oh so close though, thin tannish head, diminsihed softly, some ink blot strings of lace stick. Aroma is mildly roasty with black malts, slight over tone of belgian yeast adding a bit of clove and dry spice, touches of cocoa underneath, mildly dry overall and quite nice. Taste is favorably mild with a great dryish mixture of black malts and chocolate with just a hint of dried floral spices and yeast. Just barely sweet within and has a bit of roastyness to it but its very tame, leaving a nice rounded character to flourish in texture and body, which is medium to full and the smooth carbonation helps this slide right down with amazing ease. Nice stuff indeed, recommended."
"$6.99 for a 6."
"The bottled version seems to be readily available, at least in the Dallas market, but if you can find it on tap, I would highly recommend you try this one."
"The beer pours a very dark brown color with a thick tan head. The aroma is good. It boasts of mostly pale, chocolate, and roasted malts. It has the traditional Belgian style fruity kick to it; very nice. The taste is great. This is a very tastey dark ale with lots of dark malts and Belgian yeast. It goes down smooth with a creamy finish and a fruity aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good sessions ale; a real pleasure to drink; another winner from New Belgium."
"This is definitely a good beer. I didn't find it as exciting or as appealing as certain other styles, but it does have a good flavor and it both looks and smells very nice. One of my friends loves this stuff and gets 6 packs fairly frequently, so I'll probably pick up some more singles by way of barter."

"This is a distinctive and excellent beer. It does resemble a porter more than anything else but with a less oppressive flavor. It initally looks black but is a deep amber. Head rises well, but then diminishes to a small ring and minimal lacing. Aroma of sweetish malts, caramel, candy, as well as a light fruity yeastiness. The flavor is full, crisp and malty, with the roastiness that goes along with porters but mellowed and more buttery. Mouthfeel thinnish, kind of like black coffee. A surprisingly drinkable beer, one that would make an interesting session since putting back more than one is no problem. This beer would probably be a perfect match for a particular kind of food but I wonder which dish?"
"This beer doesnt knock you out, but it has just enough of character to be an interesting session beer."
"Poured a Coca-Cola black with a thick head which died quickly leaving some scattered lacing. Has a nutty grainy malt aroma that is quite interesting. Some yeast is also detected in the aroma. Medium body is crisp with a smooth finish. Flavor is malty and nutty with an almost peanut like flavor to it. Reminds me a bit like Koestritzer Schwarzbier with its pronounced lager yeast. Overall a nice brew."
"A beautiful color when poured, very dark with hints of red. The carbonation and head is minimal, so there's nothing extremely interesting about the texture. With the nicely roasted malt, this beer has a nice smooth caramel flavor to it. One of New Belgium's finest beers, as I tend to like the darker ones."
"This beer from New Belgium Brewing was really easy to drink. I was surprised at how fast it went down. It's not a porter or a stout but almost like a schwarzbier, just not as dark. Definitely worth a try. Quite unique."
"Tasted: 11/23/03"
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black color that is really deep red when held up to light. There is two fingers of off-white head that quickly reduces to a small collar, but there is good lacing left. The smell is full of roasted malt and caramel, very sweet. There is a tiny hint of chocolate aroma as well. The taste has a good amount of burnt malt and sweetness. A good caramel taste at the finish with just a tiny dose of hops. The mouthfeel is just a little light and watery. The drinkability is really good though. A very unique beer, and a good offering from New Belgium."
"Overall, an enjoyable malt-driven beer. It's not too exciting for me, but makes for a nice fall-back beer."
"It pours a dark cordovan with a thin beige head and some wisps of lace. The aroma is a nutty malt with a light smokiness. This is mostly a malty brew with lots of caramel notes, nuts and a distant toasty crème brulee. A light taste of pears, mild limes and spices round out this very quaffable ale."
"Thanks to prAna for the trade."
"Poured a deep red with a slight head that subsided quickly. I could not detect any perceptible aroma. The flavor was sweet with a dark malt character that hinted at coffee and chocolate with a dry flavorful finish. The body was medium yet somehow i though it would be lighter. A good beer to try if you have never had it."
"Bottle purchased at Huckleberry's in Spokane. Poured a very dark brown with minimal off-white head that ceased to exist within a minute. Very mild, malty aroma of dark chocolate. Taste was equally mild. No hop presence whatsoever. This isn't a bad tasting beer. There's just not a whole lot going on with this one. The mouthfeel is rather thin. I think this would be good for someone who is terrified of the notion of a dark beer, as it is very easy to consume."
"Overall, Nothing to write home about. Perhaps I don't understand the style but I was hoping for something much bigger."
"New Belgium really does create some very good beers. This is a fine addition to their dossier. I bought a six-pack and tried the beer under several different conditions, different foods, times of day, etc. Even tried one from the bottle. Goes really well with a beef dish, or a casserole. Have a couple while watching the ball game, or with a nice pot roast."
"Thanks to Weefisheads for the sample!"
"Black color, medium head. Roasted malts, slightly hoppy. Somewhat lighter tasting with an underlying spiciness. Crisp and refreshing, unusual for a black beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and round. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is malty, slightly bitter. Would be a very good session beer."
"This is a good brew for drinking with your friends. It's easy to drink, not overpowering, not too strong. It's a little weak on flavor, but that's probably my expectations not being met on the robust part. It's got good flavor, just a little weak. I'll probably keep this on hand because of the drinkability. Not a bad brew."
"Cool label. Pours a dark coffee-brown with a small light tan head. Looks thinner than expected. Smell is mostly roasty-sweet malts. Tastes like it smells; slightly sweet, roasty malts up front, with a spicy, coffee-bitter finish. Very interesting. It's good, but feels a bit thin on the palate."
"Nice enough."
"Comments  New Belgium puts out a lot of good brews, so I was somewhat disappointed with this bottle. It has some good flavors but was flat and uninspiring, a step down from some of their finer efforts."
"At the end of the day, its interesting, and worth a try, but not outstanding."
"As I noted above I will drink this ale when I want a change of pace."
"Originally sampled on 1 May 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This pours a very dark reddish brown. It has a velvety tongue feel with flavors of sweet maltiness. It has a medium body, and generally creamy. Very nice, a bit different. I'll be sure to pick up more next time I'm in CO"
"I'd like to try this one again, sample it with some different foods. I suspect it would go well with spicy foods like Tex-Mex, Cajun/Creole."
"Flavor is of spiced coriander malt with a initially sweet malt and roasty metallic finish with a slightly washing hop bitterness"
"Truthfully, this beer is not the worst in the world. However, for it's style, it isn't the best. It's not even great. I'd say a very solid mediocre. Kind of like Gromit's sense of humor."
"This isn't available in my area, but someone brought this back to me from a trip...and I was pleased with their choice. It's called a black ale, but pours a dark brown. It is differnet though..not a brown ale, not a porter, and not a stout...but some characteristics of each. Malty aroma...roasted. Thats about all I get. You can taste the roasted malts right off, maybe even a hint of smoke. The mouthfeel is crisp though, not something I expected. Hops? What hops? I can't find any. I think it is an interesting beer. Not something I'd want to try to duplicate with homebrew, but I also wouldn't mind having it again sometime."
"It poured a nice medium brown with very little foam, but did so lace retention while drinking. The smell was of roasted malts. The taste was very pleasant with the roasted malts with out the bitterness, it was very pleasant. This is there best beer that I've tasted so far. I would by this beer again for the summer."
"Drinkability: Average...like a lot of their offerings, I find this beer to be bland and uninteresting. I'll pass next time."
"The beer is a deep brown with a halo of amber. The head wisped away quickly, but left a ring around the surface. The smell was of a superior maltiness. The first taste really agreed. There is a nice mix of carmels, grains, sugars. There's little if any hop to it, which is a style/time thing I'm sure. Its a malty treat though."
"Over all a good drinkable ale well worth waiting 449 years !!!!"
"This was an interesting, almost strange, brew. It reminded me of a porter, but with Belgian characteristics."
"506"
"Acquired via trade. I have been looking forward to trying this one. Pours a very dark brown with significnt carbonation and a medium thin beige head. Aroma of burnt malt and coffee. Flavor was a lively mix of malt, roasted nuts, coffee, and caramel. Despite the nice flavor, it could stand to be a little richer. The finish is dry and retains the carbonated feel. Good, but not great."
"They do everything well at New Belgium. Thanks to Marc77 for sending this sample!"
"This is different style of beer from the New Belgium Brewery. Very likeable though. There is a bitterness there that is not overpowering and is enjoyable. A very unique blend of complex even smokey flavors. This is a stand up beer with its complex flavors. The history of this recipe is interesting and is even reflected in it's name. This one is worth trying for sure."
"First tried on tap very dark color almost black with a little almond coloring. A creamy head that lasted through the whole brew. Had a very nice aroma with almost a nutty chocolate smell. This brew was very smooth with a nutty taste. The aftertaste was kind of like unsweetened chocolate. This beer is very easy to drink. This is my favorite beer from New Belgium."
"Give this a try with grilled chicken or pork, perhaps with cajun seasonings."
"Pours an almost black color with a thick cream colored head that gives way to some nice lacing. The aroma is of roasted malts and grains, bitter chocolate, and caramel. The flavor is dominated by a taste of dark coffee with notes of toffee and with some hop bitterness in the background. Not my favorite New Belgium brew but still pretty tasty."
"12 oz. bottled marked best before 28Dec02.  First of the New Belgium products that overflowed in my glass, poured with a big head.  Ruby red to dark brown in color.  Roasted flavors with a bit of chocolate.  Reminded me of a stout or porter.  A little bitterness remains lingering on the tongue."
"The grain flavor comes through in the taste too, with chocolate and roasty notes, and a very slightly spicy undertone.  Medium to medium-light body, with a dry finish.  Very drinkable and quite unusual."
"Black color (obviously) with some amber around the edges where light is allowed to squeeze through.  Nice and neat light tan head that stays pretty well and leaves a bit of lace as you drink.  A rush of toasted malt aroma hits you when you agitate the beer, along with some bready sourness, a unique aroma.  Just a touch of citrus hop character.  Toasted and bread-like malt characters rule the palate as well, but with more citrus hop presence that shows up in the middle.  Adds a nice little acidic twang.  Underneath all of this, a bit of spicy hop flavor.  A medium body and very creamy mouthfeel make it quite drinkable, but it's still nice and complex.  Very tasty.  This is an interpretation of an interesting Belgian style similar to a schwarzbier, which, according to the bottle, New Belgium's researchers discovered in an ""ancient brewing book"".  It seems to have been lost in time until now.  I'd like to see other breweries do research like this, there could be quite a few lost beer styles that we don't know about.  Way to go, New Belgium!"
"Another great brew by New Belgium. This one has a beautiful dark brown-reddish, ruby-like color. You can defiently smell the slighty hoppy aroma after one whiff. The taste is richly malty and smooth. It was very drinkable, although the mouthfeel was a bit lacking. Overall i loved this beer and surely will be getting it often in the future. I might even go as far to say that i like it better than Fat Tire."
"A bighuge thanks to marc77 for shipping this brew to me (in addition to his fabulous homebrews)."
"This interesting unique brew from NB pours with a nice dark color and foamy head that dissipates into a gentle lace.  The aroma is of sweet dark malt with hints of chocolate.  The medium body supports a nice clean chocolate sweet malt flavor with enough hopping to keep the malts from taking complete control."
"A New Belgium product that doesn't blow the roof off?  What the hell?"
"I have never had a beer quite like this. The name says it all about the color, this beer is very dark, almost black. One of the  first things I noticed about this brew was a very sweet malty smell. This was also the most noticeable flavor of this beer. This is very easy to drink and finish's quite nice. I only wish the tan head lasted longer. Overall a very nice beer that i could drink daily."
"My first black ale.  I was impressed by the drinkability.  The smell and taste were the caliber of a high quality beer.  A very good beer overall."
"Deep sable color, pours a massive head, such that a pint glass can scarcely contain the billowing cream colored head.  Very thick sticky lace that rings the glass.  Spicy aroma with prominent roasted malt and chocolate.  Very smooth taste; begins with lots of dark malt and caramel, finishes with a slightly sweet spicyness.  A remarkable memory from a bygone age."
"I'll back everyone else up here by saying this is a solid dark beer that is hard to classify.  Like a light porter with a slightly present yeast bite that I wish wasn't so restrained.  A BIG version of this would make it exceptional."
"As the label states, its neither a stout, nor a porter.  A medium-bodied black ale that is very drinakable.  For some reason, I was reminded of the old Michelob Dark commercial that used to say ""Don't be afraid of the dark.""  As with the other New Belgium products I've tried, it has a very distinct spice to it and an enjoyable one at that.  Very, and I do mean very, slight sweetness to it that gives way to the spice on the finish.  I could see this being nice off the tap, but the bottle was very good.  A hearty ""thank you"" to jaybeerman for sending this my way!"
"This brew has the appearance of a porter, but any resemblance ends there. Toasty munich malt is discernible in the aroma, with a very subtle chocolate note.  Quite similar in aroma profile to a real Schwarz, but there's much more fruitiness from the yeast.  Apparently a lager strain is fermented warm.  A steam Schwarz?  Smooth mouthfeel with a light to medium body.  It definitely seems alelike and lacks the crispness that a true lager possesses.  The malt flavor is dominated by smooth, tasty and toasty Munich malt, and some residual sweetness, yet manages to remain light enough to keep this brew quite drinkable.  The hop bitterness is very mild, but prevents this beer from being overly sweet.  Hop flavor is negligible. The color of 1554 is deceiving, considering roasted malt flavors are secondary to the toasty Munich notes.  1554 is certainly an interesting and drinkable brew... don't know what exactly to make from it.  I don't think I would classify it as a Schwarzbier, however."
