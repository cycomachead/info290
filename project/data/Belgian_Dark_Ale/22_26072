3.65,-1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Unibroue is arguably one of the best brewers of Belgian ales outside of Belgium but Noire de Chambly - unlike most of their offerings - doesn't quite live up to the Old-World ales it's been modeled after. It's not a bad recipe by any means, but the monks and time-honed brewers of Walloonia and Flanders make much more graceful and complex ales than this.","biegaman","Jan 15, 2014"

3.74,1.4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,"Final Grade: 3.74, a decent B grade. To be honest, I don't really remember if I liked Noire de Chambly the first time I tried it all those years ago - I wasn't truly converted over to craft beer at that point, and while it was a nice change-up from the Bow Valley Strong (I just threw up in my mouth a little), I wasn't exactly clamoring for another bottle. Looking at it today, however, I can see that this is without a doubt a quality Belgian-style dark ale. While their strong dark ales (Maudite, La Terrible, etc.) are undeniably better, this is a good substitute if you're in the mood for a Belgian beer you can have a few glasses of without losing your equilibrium. Worth a try.","thehyperduck","Oct 19, 2013"

Taste is much the same with dark fruit and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

The spicy, yeasty notes are simply overpowering here, causing the rest of the beer to be rather lost, and the heavy carbonation ends up marring the mouthfeel with foaminess. Decent, but could have used a bit more sugar, and a lot less CO2.","jondeelee","Jul 25, 2013"

Lots of Unibroue yeast character with some spiced fruit scents and a toasted malt character to the flavor.

Pours a dark red tinted brown with a thick light brown head that dissipates quickly, leaving a ring and lacing. Aroma of dark fruit and light malt.

3.94,6.8,3,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best by 4/2/2010. Pours slightly cloudy very dark reddish brown color with a foamy 1-2 finger light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a very thin cap that lingers for a bit. Some decent spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big prune, plum, caramel, apple, pear, molasses, clove, earth, tobacco, toast, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, toffee, apple, pear, toast, clove, molasses, prune, tobacco, earth, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, pear, apple, molasses, prune, clove, toast, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malty and fruity sweetness with spiciness; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is a damn good Belgian dark ale. Extremely nice flavor balance and complexity; very smooth and enjoyable stuff. Very well done.","superspak","Jul 08, 2012"

The head didn't last very long and hadn't left any really noticeable lacing. The smell was kind of roasted but livened up by some fruity aromas in there. The taste of the beer had a light rusty taste to it along with a sweetness and a bit of a boozey heat to it. The mouthfeel was a little thin but could tell that from when I poured it out. Overall i personally like it more than the Nocturnum, but it's still just about an average brew to me.","Knapp85","Jun 07, 2011"

Aroma is a bit of cocoa, definitely dried fruit, some caramel malt, toffee, toasted barley and wheat. Nice yeasty dough scent. Flavor is rich, creamy toffee malt. Very nice toasted grain flavor.

A ring and cloud are left and look pretty cool on top of the beer. Lacing is very light and almost non-existant. Smell is the signature Unibroue aroma. It smells heavily of Belgian yeast and malts, I don't pick up any hops really. The yeast is so intense in these beers, I like it. I would like a bit more malt in the scent but it is pretty good nonetheless. Taste is pretty similar to the nose. The malts shine through a bit more and a bit of alcohol comes into play also. I get a good amount of dark fruit which works well with the yeast and malts. The fruit gives it an almost wine-like taste, pretty cool. Mouthfeel is good. The body could be a bit thicker for me but the creaminess and carbonation work together very well. It is silky on the tongue and leaves a coat of yeast and malt. I think the carbonation is extremely well done in this beer. It is high but helps the flavors come through for me. Drinkability is decent. The yeast and dark fruit flavors are only good for a glass or so. I wouldn't session this one because of said aspects. The price is good, about $9/4pack and beer certainly tastes good. Definitely worth trying.","cbutova","Feb 20, 2010"

You would think it would be a heavier beer, but it had a fairly light body with a smooth drinkability. As far as taste goes, it is a bit subtle; nothing really jumps out at you, but if you let it linger on your tongue, there is this impression of the beer being brewed in old, wooden molasses barrels.

The aroma yield maltiness, cocoa, and molasses, but unlike Maudite and Trois Pistoles, this beer tasted more figgish than tart, and furthermore revealed a burnt sugar smell. The latter burnt flavor certainly surfaced in the taste, and while there was an abundance of flavor, at times it tasted a little too sweet and disjointed, especially after warming to room temperature. Furthermore I found it surprising that despite the fact that Maudite has a higher ABV, this beer's abv seemed more prominent in the finish. Creamy mouthfeel mitigated the alcohol burn. If I'm going to reach for a dark ale from these guys, I'm definitely going with the Maudite or Pistoles next time.","donniecuffs","Nov 13, 2009"

The beer needs some rich malt and just comes off too light and too restrained in the end. The finish is dry and the feel is lively and fizzy.

3.75,1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Chambly pours dark brown with some cherry reds on the edges. The head is huge, off-white, and relatively sturdy, kind of like dirty soap bubbles in the sink. The smell is, of course, evocative of every other Unibroue beer I've encountered. A melon-like sweetness sits atop some more distinct caramel and citrus notes coupled with a faint grassy hop aroma. Maudite comes to mind, only a little sweeter on the nose and obviously darker in color. Some dark fruits sit in the background, I'm thinking fig on this one. The first sip is remarkably smooth and highly carbonated. The carbonation hits the tongue first, bubbling and tingling just enough to let you know it won't be going anywhere in the near future. The caramel notes sneak through next, riding on the backs of the dark fruits, cherry and fig this time around. A faint grassy finish dries a little bit as it reaches the back of the throat. It's definitely got some sweetness to it, but I feel as if it plays a secondary role to everything else. It enhances everything, brightening the tongue up after the carbonation assault. A few more sips leave a frown of sorts on my face as I get a watery taste, muted flavors if you will. Raisins...yeah, it's raisins, not figs. Oddly enough, I think a bit more tangyness would go well here. Just a bit of a bright, wheat snap and I would be happy. After a swirl and pour and some warming, I'm still not overwhelmed by this beer in any way. I could easily drink this in a session or in multiples. It lacks the punch of the other Unibroue beers, but it's nice in its subtlety of flavor.","Goblinmunkey7","Dec 08, 2008"

I get a bit of spice, malts, toffee and some hops, but everything is subdued. Mouth-feel is medium-bodied which leads to a drinkable, but mediocre brew.

The taste makes up for it with a well balanced sweet and richly complex malt that seems darkened perfectly.

Granted, I am no follower of Belgian Darks but have had nothing bad to say about others in its style-category.

Taste, too, was less assertive than I was expecting. *Some* hops bitternes detectable, but mostly toasted cereal-type flavours as to be expected from something this dark.

Smell is clovey with spices and belgian candy sugar. Smell has some plum in it as well. The mouthfeel is very carbonated, harsh, and the taste has some definate grape flavor throughout. Other flavors are definate clove, a hint of plum, some definate spices such as a slight hint of cinnamin. The nose has some slight sour plum. This was definately not as bad as my first bottle.

The aroma was persistent and hard to identify without a good knowledge of the Belgian style but it was just like Worcestershire sauce. The flavour is a sweet malt and Worcestershire sauce again with some espresso coffee and maybe some cocoa. There's no great explosion of flavour and the flavours are subtle but well balanced. Not much hoppiness and no length of palate since its sweet. A reasonable enjoyable dinner beer but rather water and lacking body.

A bit cough medicine like, but they do formulate those to taste good too. A little touch of spices showed up at the back end of each sip, which I suspect was due to the alcohol.

In the end, while the flavors are certainly interesting, this is just too simplistic. The concord grape note is just so big here; I don't know quite what to think. This might actually pair quite well with a dark chocolate thing or so.

Under the malt a bit of fruity sweetness is evident and the taste finishes heavy with flavors from the yeast. The mouthfeel is good if anything a touch thin and too bubbly. I find this beer to have a bit of a cloying aftertaste and I don't find it overly exciting in general, it seems to fall a bit below what it could be so drinkability suffers slightly.

3.88,5.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This one is a little deceiving in that it has a particularly low ABV given its claims of being a dark Belgian ale. If you are looking for a genuine or even a faux Belgian Dubbel, this isn't it. The bottle, pour, pop, color and lacing are all very nice. It has a nice, dark, thick head, and smooth pour out of the bottle. The smell isn't particularly strong or notable one way or another, a little malty, nothing much else to say about the smell. The taste is smooth, a little malty with maybe a hint of molasses. It isn't a strong beer, or a really flavorful beer, but it is a nice, lighter tasting dark beer with enough complexity to be tasty enough and interesting at the same time. I wouldn't call this a sweet beer either in what would be typical of the Belgian dark style. There is an ever so small tinge of a hoppy bite, but not too much and not pronounced. The after taste is a little metallic and is the weak point of the beer. This has less character than say Fin Du Monde or Trois Pistoles from Unibroue, but those beers also have a higher ABV. I liked this beer and would buy it again. I'm looking out my window at a mid March snow storm and this is the perfect complement -- a darker ale that isn't particularly ""winter"" heavy.

No, it is not as good as Fin de Monde et al. but for the alcohol and the uniqueness of the style ( kind of like a Belgium IDA with less hops) I like this beer. Once my sample warmed up I got all sorts of dark yeasty notes and a slightly malty backbone. The drinkability of this beer ( aka not 10 percent) makes it a great beer to have with a meal and the dark malty notes anchor the brighter Belgium flavours that we expect from Unibroue. Not a classic but still worth buying.","canucklehead","Mar 16, 2007"

Bready, spicy yeast aroma with light notes of dark chocolate, plums and raisins. Mild bitterness with most of the character coming from the malt and yeast. Not overly sweet though, with a little dried fruit and dark malt, some bread crust and peppery spice in the finish. Maybe a bit of warmth as well. Creamy texture, a bit slick, with a medium body and considerable carbonation. Not nearly as disappointing as I'd expected, based on what I'd heard from others, but not that exciting either.

The smell is sweet, with big malts, slight citrus, currants, and maybe a touch of cocoa. The taste starts out nutty with taste of dark fruit and turns into a mellow citrus, almost a melon taste. The flavor is round, full, and deep. Very rich, just like most of the Unibroue's I've tried.

Has a yeast quality that seems to give off a banana like taste, very similar taste that I have experienced in the other Unibroue offerings.

The taste is slightly sweet, with a notable yeast aroma. Medium body overall (although quite light, given the style), with a bit of a chalky mouthfeel.

Lots of frothy head leaps up the sides of the glass til the end of the pour, a brownish head and nearly black liquid. Smell is a little fruity, maybe a touch of vanilla. Taste is not mind-blowing, perhaps a little less flavor than could be expected or desired. Good balance though, the malts are nice and unobtrusive. A little coffee or cocoa or even a splash of hops would do something to pep this one up. Mouthfeel is solid, extremely easy to drink. It reminds me of 1554 Black Ale: a serviceable N.

It has fairly active carbonation leading up to a 2 finger tan head that reduces to a collar and leaves light lacing. In the bouquet its fruity and spicy, with almost acidic orange juice, light pink grapefruit, and some yeast. It tastes of wheat, spice, oranges, light roasted/smoked malt, pilsner malt, leather?, strawberry?, and light green hops that leave a mild bitterness. The body is medium to light with an equal finish and it is lightly numbing from the spiciness. Overall it's nice and complex, but it needs more flavor and a longer finish - a bigger version of this beer would be quite nice.","mmmbeer","Sep 02, 2006"

It is getting harder to tell some of these new Unibroue beers apart, many taste like tweaks of past and previous offerings. The Chambly Noire has Déjà vu flashes to other dull darker Unibroue specials. It comes with some serious promotional baggage but it fails to live up to this. Not bad at all, but it is just average and not great. Like I say, this is just another dark offering from Unibroue.

Tasted sweet (of course) with a bit of sourness. Considerable breads, grains and nuts were found in the taste. Also some qualities similar to wine persisted. Sometimes tartness in the back of the throat was observed. At times, a nice alcoholic afterglow came about. Interesting! Occasionally a slight smokiness was found. Halfway through the bottle the taste started to wash out a bit. A slight bite of carbonation was had on the tongue. This one had a somewhat lighter feel than other Belgian and Belgian style brews Ive had. I need to start stocking other cheeses because I usually have only dill havarti and Parmesan.

Aroma is quite yeasty with a bit of lemon and cream. Touches of vanilla and banana as it warms. Taste is subtle, much less in your face than most Unibroue. Some sweet malts, peaches, pepper, a nutty yeastiness, and a spicy lemon finish. Mouthfeel benefits from the large carbonation. While its smooth to the point of being almost flat up front, it comes back with an ass kicking bite in the finish. Body is on the light side of medium and very refreshing.

The taste does not live up to the hype of the rest of the beer (ie look smell etc.) Lackin up front with a smokey middle, not my cup of tea. Leads into a sweet yeasty finish that is lack luster.

Higher carbonation. Some lace, and medium to medium low carbonation. Aromas are very faint, but traces of malty nuttiness are noted. Maybe some bread in there too. Taste is quite mild compared to other Unibroue beers. Toasty malts, mixed cereal grains, a touch of sour yeast, a hint of hops. Good, but needs to be kicked up a notch. Mouthfeel is nominal, and relatively unimpressive, yet unoffensive. Drinkability is average. Is this what we have to expect in the future from Unibroue?

Initial sip threw me for a loop, because all I could really focus on was the high carbonation level. The aftertaste is kind of lagerish, with notes of some low alpha hops and carbonic acid from the big carbonation. Malt sweetness with hints of roasty husk show up as the beer warms. A slight bit of dusty funk shows up as well, letting the drinker know its Belgian-inspired roots. It's pretty good, kind of like a dark singel or paterbier crossbred with a Munich dunkel crossbred with a dunkelweizen.

Clartiy is hard to discern, as the brew is pretty dark in color. Nose is solid Belgian spicey, with a moderate brown sugary sweetness, overlaying a very solid orange peel and lighter coriander citrusy character. The best descriptor to me would be a dark whit. Flavor is fairly well the same as the aroma. There are light roasted notes, with a lighter brown sugar sweetness, not cloying or anything, but with just a touch of sweetness. There are also lighter notes of citrusy orange. Its tasty. Feel is modrate with a moderate to active carbonation. It works well with the flavor. This one is pretty nice.

Dark brown, typical look for Belgian Strong Darks, with good retention and lacing (but not great). Smells boldly of toastedness, yeast, wheat, and some estery qualities (citrus, clove, bananna). Belgian yeast shows a tart, spicy kick on top of the barley. The sweetness level seems to be quite low, allowing the tosted boldness to show through.

3.56,-3.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,"Found in the Unibroue ""2006 Collection"" 12 pack. Chambly Noire poured jet-black--very dark, no traces of dark brown. The head is a light chocolate brown, very creamy and small bubbled. Fine thick sheets of lacing. Wonderful looking beer. The aroma is quite similar to Maudite. Spicy malts, Unibroue yeast aroma. A little tinge of sourness in the background. A faint nuttiness, and some salinity. Some chocolate and raisins, lightly toasted bread, a little licorice, and prunes and dried plums. Not as complex as some of their other beers, but a delightful aroma nonetheless. A little sweeter than Maudite. The taste is bit of a letdown. I do not think Unibroue intended this one to be a complex, slow-sipper--more of an all-round more versatile beer: something to be had with food. There is just not a much depth here: it starts with some yeasty fruitiness, passes the middle adding a little dark malting, and then leaves with a very subtle aftertaste. Nothing really stands out, and all the flavours are subdued. It IS well-balanced though, and has some tastes of ham, coffee, chocolate, and seasoning salt. Nice creamy mouthfeel, but only medium bodied. An unoffending, unchallenging beer, but highly drinkable, and probably a great starter beer to get someone started on the right road. I could pass a couple of these back effortlessly. By all rights: a great dark beer, but not quite the finest feather in the cap of Unibroue.","Cwrw","Jan 02, 2006"
