"Would prefer a bit more tartness or sweetness...or both. A bit weak in flavor."
""
"Overall, holy crap, this is so smooth. I dig it as a Belgian Dark Ale, it works and I'd have it again."

"O- Pretty good but not anything super special. Easy to drink for the ABV and has all the right flavors to satisfy your BSDA craving."

"This is less “craft” and more upscale than the normal La Rulles. It has less chunks of raisins. It’s more filtered. The aroma is less strong. The flavor is less strong. The raisin aroma is diminished. It has a floral aroma. More alcohol. A big head becomes a thinner but not flat. Medium to high carbonation. Bitter. I prefer the normal La Rulles."

"A dark malt start with a rich toasty flavor. The swallow has a mild bitterness with a berry-like touch. Thin bodied which is enhanced by the notable alcohol presence. Low carbonation."
""

"Pours into a chalice a deep burgundy brwon with a sticky tannish colored head head atop,a great pour.Aromas of spent grain and yeasty spice with a light alcohol note.Flavors are yeaty up front with some cork-like notes,some phenol spice comes into play thru to the finish.Not bad and not overly heavy,the yeast plays a big role here."

"Deep mahogany bodied ale with a big frothing tan khaki head forming thick rising above the rim of the glass. Aroma has tart fruit with big funky yeast notes, hints of citrus and Christmas spices. Santa is on the label looking pretty deviant without a beard, maybe it's one of the brewers at La Rulles. A deep fruit note pretty non descriptive flavor, big malts, mild spicy yeast notes leaves a dry semi sweet finish. Dark leather notes, medicinal cherry, earthy sprigs from pine trees or oak birch accents, what a beer. The type of Belgian ale only a mother could love big overpowering and a bit of a bully this has no finesse compared to some of my favorite ales out there. Overall I'm waiting to try something excellent in comparison, to this dumbed down and non accentuated notes that I've come to know and adore."
"With a lot of old-world, rustic charm- Le Rulles Cuvee has all the earthy spiciness that the style deserves. Along with its unapologetic carbonation, the ale simply springs to life and is ideally suited for many holiday desserts."

"Overall I found it quite simple not getting much coriander, pepper spice, or sweet banana flavors but as I drink it grew on me like Chimay Blue, but much cheaper. Even though its over 6 months old now pick it its a perfect example of the style."
""

"D - Great BDA. Good balance."
""
"O - I thoroughly enjoyed this brew, less heavy on the fruity flavours and a solid dark malt profile. Easily sessioned and well worth seeking out. I'm grateful for the opportunity to take this brew for a spin."
"Pours a hazy dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, toast, dark fruit, and some spice aromas. Taste is much the same with dark fruit and char-like flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some nice aromas but the flavors are a bit burnt tasting."
""
"O - generally a pleasant enough Belgian Dark, however the label and timing left me hoping it would have more of an winter/xmas quality to it which it fails to deliver on, but still well worth a try"
""
"D: This was a nice BSDA, but nothing special. It would probably age really well, but it was also ok fresh. Decent."
""
"Drinkability : a good beer in the Belgian style Strong dark ale."
""
"jd"
"Overall, good, but just good. Nothing outstanding or really new. It's well done though, and I'd have it again."
""
"This is a very nice winter warmer. While it has a Belgian dark strong ale profile, it also has some dry stout qualities. Packs a lot of dark wintery and spicy flavor into a beer that is just 7.3% and is not too sweet. Gladly will I drink more of this."
""
"Pours a reddish amber color with hints of light visible around the edges. There is a two finger slightly beige head which leaves decent lace. The aroma is of bubblegum, banana, and some dark fruits. The taste follows suit the beginning has a dark fruit flavor profile, this gives way to banana's along with nutmeg and cinnomon. The backend brings a big bubblegum flavor. The mouthfeel is moderatley carbonated and a little creamy. Overall it was a slightly above average beer. Everything was good but not great."
"Overall: turned out to be pretty damn enjoyable, curious to try it fresh at some point."
""
""
"A decent winter indulgence, the savoury spices on the down-low, alongside a nicely multi-toned maltiness, and some equally tame alcohol warming. All in all, the preceding was a mawkish way of describing a simply well-integrated, tasty accompaniment to the various sugary offerings so prevalent at this time of year."
""
"I'd drink this again and its reasonably at around 12$ it might happen sooner then later. Alberta shelves are getting jam packed with gems both hidden and sought after, keep'em coming"

"Review from 6/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red brown amber, heavy medium tan head and massive lacing. Aroma of dark and sweet malt, dark fruits, somewhat subdued. Flavor follows with sweet malt, dark and light fruit, Belgian spicing, brown sugar. A bit of dryness in the finish, but overall sweet. Moderate body and moderately complex. A pleasant, but not outstanding dark Belgian."
"Poured at Rustico's in a sampler glass. Pours a dark reddish amber along with an average tan head that left nice lacing throughout. The aroma was moderate to heavy caramel and dark candy sugar; moderate to heavy yeast, with some slight Christmas-like spices in the yeast at the end; grape, apple, cherry, brown sugar, lots of slightly sour fruit; and slight alcohol heat. The initial flavor was moderately to rather sweet, slightly acidic and ever so slightly bitter; while the finish was somewhat to moderately sweet, slightly bitter and slightly sour. There was caramel, brown sugar, dark candy sugar, dusty yeast, slightly sour fruit that grows in intensity as it warms, cherry, apple, grape, hints of cocoa, and a little spicy yeast at the end. The light to medium body was sort of creamy, but sticky on the lips and then a little dry with fizzy carbonation and a slightly astringent and a lightly dry finish. Overall an interesting beer."
"Pours a clear dark brown color. Aromas of candi sugar, spices, strong malt and mild cocoa. In the taste, a nice roasted malt note, with light cinnamon like spice. The roasted malt caught me a bit off guard, but works well here. Notes of caramelized sugar and dark breads. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, smooth, with ample carbonation. Overall, a nice Belgian Dark ale, dig the roasted malt in a Belgian."
"Pours a moderate amber-brown color with a moderate light tan head and good lacing. The nose had some dark fruit and malts plus some grapes and a light bit of spice. Flavor was dark fruits and semi-sweet malt. Medium body with good carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Good brew."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to brown in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, cinnamon, mild peppermint, almost candy cane like. In the taste, spicy, minty, and candy cane sweetness, all inside of a nice dark ale. A spice like bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry spice of cinnamon in the aftertaste. Like a cinnamon candy cane in a nice very fine Belgian dark ale."
"This was the third beer we tasted here, it wasn’t the strongest, but it certainly had the most flavour and body depth, we definitely reviewed in the right order. Pleasant and easy to sip, a Christmas brew without to many wintery ways to it, nothing really special though."

"Considering that this is categorized as a BDA, instead of BSDA, this one gets high marks. Easy drinking, full of flavor, somewhat complex, and perfect for the Holidays. (and a festive label, too!)"
""
"Poured a dark brown with everlasting one-finger tan head (or so it seemed). A hearty aroma as I pick up caramel and sugary sweetness, touches of spice and yeast and I swear I'm getting a hint of citric notes like orange peel. Fuller body than expected, a good chewiness along w/ the smoothness, and I get a balance of dry and sweet malts with minor hopiness and traces of dark fruit. Finishes crips with a touch of sweetness. A great ale to relax with."

"Very good beer and recommended by the bartender. Poured with a light tan, foamy, frothy head that lasted a while and good lacing. Color was a hazy, almost cloudy brown with red highlights. Aroma was perfumey, malt, roast, caramel, yeast, a little dark ripe fruit. Flavor was very similar to nose, plus some toffee and just enough tang. Body was good and carbonation fine. Finished with average length, smooth, and drinkable. Nice."
"Poured into a tulip glass, a dark coppery brown, hazy and almost muddy, with a foamy beige head that receded to a ringlet, leaving a bit of soapy lace on the glass. Subdued aroma, sweet malts, honey, grassy hops, and some dried fruits. Taste was very nice: toasted malts, honey and caramel, prunes, dried cherries, and mild, grassy hops and hay. Medium body, kind of bitter, but in a good way, and nicely drinkable overall."
"O: Overall a very good Belgian dark. Not the best I've had overall, but the addition of some dark malt gives it a more unique flavor."
"Back to the beer. Once I had some in my mouth, I was struck by its appropriateness for the time. It was a bit thin, approaching medium mouthfeel, but it was like biting into a fruitcake. Zounds! Super smooth and eminently drinkable, neither of which is helpful in a 7.3% beer. Finish was fruity, slightly dry, definitely warming. Winner!"
"O - Awesome BDA, ranks up there, more on the mellow side, but complex and synergistic."
"Pours a mahogany, with some lighter copper and chestnut highlights with a big fluffy, cream coloured head that towers more than 3 fingers high. Nose is all malt, gentle spicing. Very soft and inviting, minimal as I'm struggling to describe it, but really entices me to pull it to my mouth. Unfortunately, the taste is step down from the nose. Some yeast, a gentle sugary malt, some alcohol and light spicing. Really nice feel however as I've found most Belgians to be. Carbonation is moderate and there's some lingering Belgian yeast. Real pleasant."
"Amazing aroma, spicy, a biere de garde. Good drinkability and lots of spices, a little sour in the finish. Getting corriander, ginger,bit of pickle juice, grains of paradise, pepper, nutmeg, hay.Private buying club.Fun stuff, big head that stayed at three-quarters of an inch."
"Pours a tan 1 finger head than diminishes quickly with nice lacing to a little layer of foam. Color is very dark brown with some hints of sandiness to it. Smells of light roast, burnt sugar, malt, and yeast. The taste is a bit sharp, a decent bitterness, caramel, roast, and a mild booziness that escapes towards the end. Feels very nice and foamy when sipping and is a pleasure to drink, overall."
"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy brown color ale with a super large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light candi sugar with some light dry fruits notes with some light pepper notes. Taste is an interesting mix between some strong caramelized malt with some notes of dry fruit and some peppery yeast notes. Body is full but could have been even fuller with good carbonation notes with no apparent alcohol. Very well brewed and enjoyable though a bigger body would have been even better."
"Poured a dark brown with brownish highlights that had a thin frothy head and left a little acing sticking to the glass. The nose was moslty grainy and sweet from the malts with faint honey dark fruit notes. The taste was also sweet from the malts but with honey dark fruit accents and a touch of belgian yeast notes. The brew was medium to full in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, malty, and silky finish. The brew was moslty just sweet but drank good. Not a beer I could have lots of."
"D: After my previous experiences with this brewery, I wasn't in a huge rush to try this one. I was pleasantly surprised by it, however, and it turned out to be a good drinking experience."
"D- I finished my glass in no time. Easy drinking and at 7.3 I considered another, but I was already under the spell of the yeast, it stayed with me. This is a good Belgian Dark that is on the spicy side, but a bit unbalanced. Good for a gander."
"A damn drinkable Belgian dark beer, even at over 7 percent abv. Not too rich, but satisfying."
"This is kind of like half a dubbel. Remarkably flavorful and drinkable but it doesn't kick your ass the way most Belgians do. I'd love to find it on draft."
"Nice stuff, I like this."
"Rather lively, prickly carbonation. Not entirely what I'd associate with the style, but it does lend this winter beer a nice refreshing quality."
"Not as rich or complex as I would think it would/could/should be. Still it's a nice sipper - winter-ish, I suppose. Not particularly special, but certainly not bad and certainly worth trying."
"Very good Christmas beer."
"Served in a snifter, the beer was a dark brown color with a thick tan head that persisted well. Not much aroma, a bit of spice. More came through in the taste, like cocoa with some cinnamon sprinkled on it. The spice lingered on, and almost became unpleasant. This was an OK beer, but I don't think I'll be seeking it out."
"The beer was smooth and moderately full bodied, but it didn't make up for the lack of flavor."
"Given to me by a friend, probably never search it out on my own but tasty enough if you are after something belgian."
"Very nice - like all Rulles beers."
"Pours a very dark ruby red/ chestnut brown wth large foamy white head. Aroma of clove, alcohol, cinnamon and spiciness. Taste very similar to aroma dominated by cloves, pepper and other spices. Also, hints of fruit and alcohol."
"Cuvee Meilleurs Voeux is loosely translated as 'Best Wishes for the New Year'. New Year's Eve deserves a beer that delivers a lot more excitement than this. Bottom line: looks like a dream, tastes like a (good) day at the office, and drinks like an evening at home. Or something like that."
"Drinkability- Overall a bit too deep and malted for me, but has it's nice point. Would recommend for malt lovers."
"[For the record, my bottle says 7.3%, so I guess it's been ratcheted up a bit since first introduction.]"
"As a side note, the bottle specifically denotes an alcohol percentage of 7.3%, and not 6.5%..."
"D: Overall a very sweet, malty xmas beer with a very smooth alcohol warming and fruitiness with warm spiciness that made for an enjoyable drink."
"Overall experience: To experience what Belgium has to offer if given the chance is a nice experience in and of its self. Quite enjoyable this one was."
"Drinkability: A great Belgian beer. Lots of burn on this one, maybe it was young. I thin kat 6 months this one would be near perfect."
"Had this on-tap last night at a local pizza joint. It was a dark brown color, with little to no head. The smell was a bit sour.. like sour fruit and sugar. Taste was good.. like dried cherries, pears, and oranges, with some nutty after-notes. This style is not my favorite, but I found this beer to be highly drinkable, and one that I would try again."
"D_another over the top beer at the VSK"
"Hazelnut color with off-white head. Aromas of dark fruit and tart cherry. Flavors of sour cherry fruit, and juicy caramel malt. I couldn't tell if this was spoiled, or a Flemish brown type beer, because nobody at the bar new what it was, and had no info. The category it is assigned on BA doesn't shed much light either."
"This is a very good beer, but I really wish the brewery would have left out the gueze or lambic, or whatever he/she added."
"D - Awesome. This is so easy to drink. Definitely worth a try."
"Poured a deepr red/brown color from the tap into a goblet style glass. The head was very very light, but I noticed that most of the beers poured at this particular event were like this and made me suspect it was some type of glass cleaner that was destroying the head and not the beer. The aroma was a very gentile caramel with an unidentifiable fruit hinden behind. The flavor was malty at first, but changed as it warmed into an ale fruitiness. Light mouthfeel and good flavor left me satisfied that this was a good choice to try something new."
"If you see it, ask to try it. You may wind up getting a full glass shortly thereafter."
"Drinkability: easy drinking for the style, as lower alcohol levels and nice sweetness are easy on the tastebuds. Seek this out."
"The beer was served into a tulip glass and come out with a nice deep brown body with a little tan head trailing it. The beer has a nice roasted malt aroma to it with a touch of maybe caramel as well. The taste has a nice balance of the bitter hop taste which I love and a little sweetness that backs up the hops. There is a bit of carbonation but not overdone. I enjoyed letting the beer sit a bit and warm up in my glass. A nice treat on a cold night."
"Got this on tap at the Old Bay in New Brunswick, NJ. On the menu it says one of only two bars in the country that have this on tap but im not too sure how acurate that is but anyhow. Poured into an oversized wine glass a copper color with a minimal white head. The smell was somewhat fuity with some roasted malts. Taste is a little hoppy somewhat sweet as well. A little spicy but not much. Alcohol is somewhat present but doesn't take control. Drinkability is ok because the ABV isn't that high."
"Served on tap at Grand Cru in Baltimore, poured into a Chimay goblet. This is a deep burgany brown which takes on some purplish hues when held up to the light, solid beige cap of head, some delicate lacing. Nose is a slight roasted malt with a caramel note and some slight apple fruitiness. Taste is a nice smooth malt, some mild chocolate and caramel notes, a touch of spices and a decently bitter finish. Very nice delicate flavors in this one, as it warms some light fruitiness starts to come through. Medium bodied with a very fine creamy carbonation, this is a very pleasant sipping beer. This is a very nice little offering, good complexity for such a light beer, very tasty and fun to drink."
"BB sept 08; alcohol listed as 7.3. Nice head that lasts very well and beautifull darkbrown/ almost black beercollor without any haze also. Nose is green spicy and roasted, nicely caramellic and very tempting. Freshness goes on in the taste that's heavy and sweet with good bitter and roasty ending. Well balanced but mainly roastyness and bitterness with good malty sweetness. Not much carbonisation fits the brew and IMO a good extra stout. Very well drinkable and certainly wort seeking for if you like it bitter sweet and burnt."
"Overall: Definitely a Winter-Xmas Brune of sorts, but at 6.5% it is nothing overwhelming and makes for an easy-going Seasonal Session Brune of sorts. Retains the artisanale rural character & rustic character that is evident in both the Blonde and [standard] Brune. I only have the one bottle, but it would be interesting to see how this bottled-conditioned brew ages given the Best Before Date some 3 years hence."
