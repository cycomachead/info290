"D: Take it or leave it. Ok drinkability but really nothing speciale."
"Bottled sample via trade. Dark gold in colour, mith moderate (yet spritzy) carbonation. Aromas are of stale malts, sour fruit, and damp earth. Flavors are of both stewed and sour fruits, light caramel, chalk, and black pepper. Very light bodied... as if it's hardly even there. Overall, it's average at best. This bottle might be a little old,"
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with a lot of visible carbonation and a thick white foamy head. The aroma consists of a mix of pilsner malts, delicate floral hops and crisp light fruit. Easy to drink with decently balanced crisp hoppiness, light fruit(grape, apple, etc.) and pilsner malt flavors."
"Poured the bottle into a Val Dieu chalice glass. It has a medium amber color with a small white head. It smells mostly of malt, with a light caramel touch. Pretty uninteresting flavor: malt, a tad grainy, with some noble hop flavor and medium bitterness. Could easily be a generic amber at any generic brewpub in the US."
"Something acidic/slightly metallic in the aftertaste with a body that borders weak, but has a touch of creaminess. It does go down pretty easily and is not as bad as my description may sound, but it lacks the flair of a Belgian Dark Ale - English Ale (Bitter?) comes to mind - though it doesn't really fit there either, as there is some touch of coriander...Regardless of style, it's nothing ""special""."
"Almost clear amber with minimal head. Hop presence on the nose with a bitter tone. Smells like an IPA to me. Flavor is almost washed out, bordering on watery...perhaps not bordering. Two toes might have already crossed the line. Feel is thin. Not very drinkable at all due to the fact that it has no punch or anything unique or interesting about it. This is the 4th I have tried from the Petrus 6-pack, and it is by far my least favorite. Why exactly is it labeled ""Speciale"" again? I am hoping the last two from the six pack are in a different league."
"Drinkability : une bière correcte dans le style Belgian ale (pas dark!)"
"Drinkability: Not a bad brew but so totally lacking compared to other Belgians it gets marked down in comparison"
"Overall: A very mediocre Belgian Dark. Dont waste your time or money! Special Ale? Give me a *** break."
"This beer poured a cloudy brown color with a thick white head  tight bubbles and nice lacing. The aroma is initially spicy with the smell of malt noticeable after a moment. The taste is spicy and sour at first sip followed by some slight malt and hop flavors. The mouthfeel is thin to medium. Id consider this a drinkable beer  would be a nice change on occasion."
"Bottle into tulip glass. A: Very hazy amber-brown, decent amount of head that whittles down to a thin caked on layer. S: Some earthy malt up front, the hops are a bit of an afterthought. T: A little thin at the start, then the malt makes an entrance with some vaguely citrusy hops...I'm having a hard time quanitifying it because it's pretty passive all around. Very average character. M: Coarse, tiny little bubbles, a tad sticky. D: I'm not really completely over the moon about this one, but then again it's by no means abhorrent. With it's overall subdued character I could definitely drink a few of them, but nothing in particular is compelling me to do so."
"($21.99 / 11.2 oz. mixed 6-pack Petrus Sampler)"
"Petrus Speciale Ale was a golden amber color and a little hazy. It had a large white head with decent retention and left some lace behind. The aroma was light malt and hops. The taste was light malt and a little spice with a dry bitterness. It was medium-light in body with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was average. This beer was a bit of a letdown and definitely not worth the three bucks I paid for the bottle."
"D - Ugh. I passed this one off to a friend halfway through. It is not worht having. I have had other Pertrus (Bavik) beers that I would recommend. This one is far short of speciale."
"-Oelergud"
"The appearance was actually really good, lots of sticky white foam with clumpy lacing on the glass. The smell is not so strong, you can detect a Belgiany yeast in the aroma but barely. Not unlike the aroma of Kwak to my recollection. The flavor was also not strong. Actually it was not bad (a little 1-dimensional) but you're expecting more when you see it's their Speciale."
"Easy to drink. Nice summer beer. An enjoyable surprise."
"Not *bad*, but ultimately a disappointment."
"Aftertaste is clean and fresh, but still lacking in dimension."
"Petrus Speciale is brewed in Belgium, but doesn't taste like it; something that is pretty rare in my experience. Four packs hit Des Moines sometime in the past year, a development that I was initially excited about. After having tasted it, I'm excited no longer."
"This is far from a belgian dark ale. I will notify the beerfly for a change. Upside: Looks, innoffensive. Downside: Lack of depth, boring."
"Petrus Speciale Ale pours a pretty, subdued rust color with a delicate lacy head. Aromas are fairly fruity, with apples, plums, and some citrus notes present. On the palate, though, things flatten out a bit, with little of the interesting fruits in the nose making their way into the body. Some sourness is in there, kind of like you get in some English pale ales. Mild sweetness. Mouthfeel is a touch on the thin side, not unpleasantly so, but the mouthfeel adds to the ""where's the beef?"" feeling I get from this one. Overall, an unoffensive Belgian that also lacks character."
"Taste is slightly acidic and dry. A slight bitterness and dry aftertaste mark this beer. Again the wood comes through, and I think this inhibits drinkability a little bit. Overall a good beer, which I would review as a blond or belgian pale ale, not as a dark ale. Who made that up?"
"Odd, stale funky mouthfeel with a flavor combination of orange peel and sweaty gym socks. This is by far the worst of the Petrus lineup, yet they choose to call it ""Speciale""? If that's not irony, I don't know what is."
"Mouthfeel is clean but there is nothing here."
"Bland. This is the Budweiser of Belgian Beers, more so than Stella. This sucks."
"While I've been pleasantly surprised by much of the Petrus line...I wish I'd skipped this one."
"33 cl bottle. ABV labeled at 5.5%. Pours a lighly hazed honeyed amber color with some orange highlights. Big, rocky bone-white head that's lasting a good while and leaving nice lacing. Aromas of honey, pear, hay and a lightly herbaceous hop character. Crisp and refreshing; a little sweetness comes through mid-palate, but the finish is dry and healthily carbonated, almost prickly. An excellent Belgian sessioner I could consume a few of. I can really love the lighter Belgians (especially their models, hubba hubba)."
"I would argue that this is under-rated, and is indeed Speciale."
"Looks good, nice brownish red brew with lots of lacing and minimal head. Smell is acidic, not terrible but nothing great either. Taste is good, malty and mild. Mouthfeel is unoffensive, not overly carbonated, pretty smooth. and pretty drinkable too. Not a bad choice."
"One of the six Petrus beers from a gift pack, this one pours a clear amber color with a pertinent light tan frothy head that after depletion leaves a fine veil of lace upon the glass. Nose has a crisp citrus like front wit ha bit of malt at the back; start is somewhat sweet, nice grain presence and the top light to moderate in feel. Finish is sternly acidic, the hops benign in their spiciness, desert bone dry, and a fine brew to start off a Sunday afternoon of sampling."
"Overall: Triple AAAsadly that means An Average Amber."
"Poured into the Petrus glass. The colour is a bit of a bronze/amber/orange hue, with a small head. The smell is grassy, earthy, and a bit musky. The malt is present, and reminds of a digestif cookie. Taste starts out tart. Cranberries, perhaps? And other tart fruits. Green apples. Bit of citrus, though that is likely from a hop. Leaves simplistic and sweet. Again, like a digestif cookie, but more crisp. Biscotti? Mouthfeel is medium, oily and slick. Unfortunately, for some reason, I don't find this very drinkable. I'm not sure why. This is my second bottle, and I still can't put my finger on why this doesn't appeal to me, though I admit the scores are good."
"Best till 11-03-05 so just in time to see how this beer does. Pours in without much carbonation and its hard to get a head up on the beer. In the glas reasonably clear and has a nice bronze colour. Smell is not much at all, litle oxidation and hardly any malt or yest caracter. Were there ever hops to be smelled? Taste is as dull as the nose was. Water with alcohol and malts being used as well. Dry and litle hoppy aftertaste. Drinkable but far from great!"
"Pours an amber body, creamy head, good retention, and nice lacing. Aroma is uninteresting. Faint hops, floral/herbal but not much else. It's astringent, hoppy, floral, spicy and has a good amount of bitterness. Carbonation is strong, like a soda water. Quite drinkable, but this is no belgian ale. Seems to be mis-categorized here on BA, but it's quite drinkable."
"pours a light amber color with a fluffy head that leaves behind swathes of lace. The aroma is biscuity like an English pale ale, it also has a nice grassy quality. The taste is malty with a subtle spicyness and a decent amount of herbal hoppiness. This beer could be a little richer, though its still very tasty. A well balanced Pale Ale."
"250 mL brown bottle with clearly marked best before date."
"Pours a cloudy copper tone with a nice tight off white cap...fair effervescence in the glass....aromas of apples or pears with a musty yeast note. Starts tart and peppery then goes very slick with malt and tangy fruit pronouncments then the finish is long where the malts fade and a sour apple taste remains..slight warming...nice brew. Smooth and easy drinking... I like this better than the triple."
"Bottle - Poured a red brown beer with a nice huge head with above standard retention. Carbonation is great with floral aroma. Medium body with sweet taste. A bit disappointed with that one, the spice mix is almost non-present and the body is too light with a bit of a watery aftertaste. Note: I find it a bit weird that this beer from a Belgium brewery has only been review so far by Canadian BA..."
"Drinkability: nt that ""speciale"" after all."
"Looks good, but mostly an average quaff."
"Wish I had a few more of these."
"I would recomend it."
