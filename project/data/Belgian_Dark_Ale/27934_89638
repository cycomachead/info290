The taste is initially similar, but there's definitely a smokiness there. Medium-light mouth, and the carbonation gives it a nice crispness. Not a bad little brew.","MartzMimic","Jan 13, 2015"

4.5,21.3,,,,,,"Great Black ale. Nice and sweet, but chocolatey and slightly smokey, but lighter than a stout. The dry finish makes it feel like I'm drinking a beer instead of eating a cake.","Beerismylifeblood69","Nov 27, 2014"

Kind of odd for a beer, much less a dark beer.  Has a smokey, BBQ taste but not on the strong side.  Very little bitterness is involved.","jngrizzaffi","Nov 09, 2014"

3.75,1.1,,,,,,"It's named perfectly because it pours completely opaque & black. The aroma is not as overpowering as a rhino however. I pick up a subtle roasty malt with a hint of cocoa. The taste mirrors this but adds in a bit of coffee. A very creamy ale with a toasty aftertaste. Very sessionable.","joeyfeets","0"

3.7,-0.3,4.25,3,4,3.75,3.75,"Pours out a nice dark brown color, almost black in appearance, its topped off with a semi-dark tan head thatâ€™s bubbly and quickly dissipates into a thin ring of lacing with an island of bubbles in the middle. Floral and fruity aromas are present, some spiced apples and mild fig smells too. This is a very bitter ale at first, good roasted coffee flavors do come through, the spices and fruits take a back seat and are detectable. It is dry and light-to-medium bodied. The aftertaste is sweet, the bitterness calms down, the roasted coffee mellows out, and the spice comes through a bit more. The bitterness calms down, as the ale warms up, overall not a bad beer.","vickersspitfire","May 31, 2013"
