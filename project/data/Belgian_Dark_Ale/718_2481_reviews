"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/21/2012. Pours hazy deep orange/copper color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of golden raisin, plum, lemon, pear, apple, white grape, white pepper, clove, candi sugar, light caramel, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of golden raisin, plum, lemon, pear, apple, white grape, white pepper, clove, candi sugar, light caramel, bread, herbal, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of golden raisin, plum, lemon, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, light caramel, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish. Nice complexity and solid robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a nice malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Belgian dark ale. All around good complexity, balance, and solid robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Petrus chalice."

"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy khkai head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, fruit, and cider. Taste is much the same with a honey flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has a lot of honey qualities going on."

"Overall / Drinkability: Oh wow - an amazing good winter beer. Like a combination of a Belgian dark ale and an American spiced winter warmer. Dangerously drinkable - this one tempted me into another one rather than trying yet another beer from the wider La Trappe menu. A great winter beer."

"This is far from the greatest beer I've had, but it's enjoyable enough to finish of the 750ml. I don't know as that I'd pay the full $7.99 price for it, but the sale price of $3.99 is more enticing. It does become a bit strange by the end of the bottle, though."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a cloudy bright orange amber. Massive white head with medium bubbles dissipated slowly, originally filling half the glass. Mild aroma of sweet malt and spices with a slightly mineral component. Flavor is a light sweet and caramel malt and light fruit dominated by apple. A slight buttery diacetyl flavor. Finish is somewhat dry and spicy, although the spices are nondescript. Light to medium bodied which is surprising considering the healthy head on this ale. Not very assertive flavors, but pleasant to drink. A nice but not outstanding winter Belgian. ."

"Pours a dark brown, not so clear. Pillowy off white froth. Aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpernickel bread and alittle floral. In the taste, a nice brown ale base with more bready character, small cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and coriander round out the spice profile. Some mineral aspects, tiny bit tart and very mild bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Overall, not a bad winter offering, lots of spices, but short of noteworthy."

"O: Not my favorite of Belgians, but still a beer that is good in the winter. Slightly warming feel. Worthy of a try."
"Pours reddish brown with huge amounts of white foam. Long lasting, and leaves a big island in the middle. Cherries, plums, raisins in the nose. Cinamon/nutmeg too. Taste is full of fruit with a bold malt taste. Spices in the mix and hints of a sour finish. Just a hint of hop at the end. Really tasty, love the sour finish."

"O - This is a very good Belgian beer. Another very good offering from Petrus."
""

"O: This is an interesting ale, but could display better balance. I like it, but would not go out of my way to buy it again."
"Pours a light bronzed orange with noticeable carbonation and a frothy white head that dissipates to a thin layer of bubbles. Malty aroma, fruitcake. Sweet malts in the taste, light sugar, fruitcake, and sour fruits and citrus zest. A little loss of flavor due to the carbonation level. Light-medium mouthfeel, a bit soda-ish; nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it again."
"Poured from a corked and caged 750ml bottle into a fancy Belgian glass that came with it. Hazy amber with blonde highlights around the edges when backlit and a big fizzy khaki head that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Sugar cookie and dark fruit with some mild Belgian yeast funkiness. Delicious holiday spice and raisin with tart green apple and rye breadiness. After several minutes of warming and adding the last of the bottle to the glass I've bumped the flavor score a little higher. A little more flavor concentration would really make this one special. Medium bodied and highly carbonated. A fine ale but not one of the truly great examples of the style."
"Atmosphere is good. Appearance is pretty decent. Nice color and a good, solid foamy head. Nose is a nice woody grain with a hint of sweet. Nice balance. Has a very woody flavor profile, and strong alcohol. Overall, This is a pretty good quaff."
"D: The beer isn't difficult to drink but would be a little more palatable if it had a bigger body and lacked the metallic smell and taste."
"Notes: Decent winter brew, but I wasn't getting as much BSDA flavors as I hoped. Tart fruit and cooking spice dominates with a good amount of alcohol heat. Nice in small doses for a winter night, but not something I necessarily crave."
"All in all I wouldn't buy this beer again."
"higher carbonation, but still fairly smooth mouthfeel. good drinkability."
"A very dark beer. A nice little head with a top on the beer which disappears fast. Sweet and sour battle with each other. Tasty beer for Christmas!"
"Quite good, certainly not what I expected from a winter ale."
"Pours a five-finger+ off-white pillowy head that takes forever to fade leaving a good lace. Clear amber color despite a ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Apple and malt nose. Flavor is sour apple and yeast, not what I was expecting for a winter ale but not bad. Pricey at $18.00 for a 750ml bottle from a Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
"All in all not my fav but I would try again forsher."
"On the dark side for this style with a ""root beer brown color"" . Huge billowing off white head. Smells wonderful. Apple cider, dark fruits, pepper, and alcohol smells. Tastes of sour apple cider. Too fizzy for my liking. A sour/tart beer. worth trying . A good session winter beer!"
"I have to score this one pretty high on drinkability, although I don't have a lot of experience in this Belgian Dark Ale style (BSDA yes... BDA, no)."
"This is ok. I didn't expect much out of a $5 beer including glass. It is brewed by Bavik and isn't all that bad. It is definitely a Belgian ale. It is slightly watery, but decent flavored."
"This is a great beer that paired well with Jamaican beef brisket, fontina/garganzola cheese veggie pizza, and spicy rum black beans."
"Petrus Winter Ale pours a stiff couple fingers of loose foam over a cloudy brown brew. Carbonation is steady and moderate, and the nose is grain hulls, a little yeast funk and a tang of alcohol. Flavor is mild wheat cracker up front with notes of dried fruit giving over to a likewise restrained herbal hop.Mouthfeel is smooth and fairly light, finishing semi dry. Very light and crisp for a holiday offering, it makes a nice change from the heavier fare that often characterizes the winter warmer/holiday ale style. Well worth a try and the goblet is just fabulous!"
"D= This was an OK beer. There seemed to be too many flavors that just didn;t meld together properly. Sort of a disappointment from Petrus, especially considering that its meant to be a winter/holiday ale."
"Hmm, pretty nice. Poured with a nice foamy, frothy off white head with lots of lace. Color is dirty copperish amber. Aroma is funky nice with some malt, sour, skanky belly button, old cheese, and something else I can't stick my nose in. Flavor's all a that and more. This one is slightly more sour than sweet which makes it so drinkable. Some caramel. Body is good although carbonation seems a tad strong. Good beer!"
"Goes down smooth and easy."
"very lively carbonation fits well i think with this style.light bodied.if this was a bit cheaper i'd pick it up more."
"Lacks depth and character, not really the best example of a Belgian winter warmer."
"Poured from a 750mL bottle (cellared from 2007) into a tulip glass. Hazy amber-brown with a very large, fluffy, off-white head. Smells like green apples and yeast. Taste is primarily tart apples, followed by some malty sweetness, finishing with just a bit of bitterness and yeast. Highly carbonated and medium bodied. The tartness makes the mouth water after every sip. Very smooth and drinkable. Delicious!"
"D: This is extremely drinkable for a dark Belgian ale, dangerously drinkable for a abv over 6%. For me though, this is simply too lacking in flavor to consider it a top notch Belgian brew."
"Lively Belgian with a pleasant profile. This beer pours a muted amber-brown with a puffy, frothy head. There's some haze as I get closer to the bottom of the bottle, but it's just from the yeast cake being disturbed a bit. The aroma has a phenol, band-aid quality with touches of sweet cherries, spices and lightly caramelized sugar. The flavor is more successful, dry and lightly sour from a pleasant Belgian yeast. The beer is nice and light on the palate. There just isn't enough going on for a higher score."
"I assume that they call it a ""winter"" beer so you'll keep drinking it after Christmas. Thin brown with scant tan head. Thinner and plainer than most Christmas ales, although I did like the cinnamon aroma. Little bitterness and not enough complexity."
"Drinkability= Decent. Once again, it's like drinking an apple juice/ beer or something. Not bad, just not my thing."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a nice little BDA. A bit light for a noel, and I can see how the soap notes might be too much for people...I'd be curious to know if they were stronger or less so when it was first bottled, probably about 1.5 years ago."
"This is an easy to drink beer, although not the best Belgian dark I have sampled, quite enjoyable. Not what I was expecting based on it being a Belgian dark/winter ale style brew, but respectable in its own way."
"M&D: despite the fizzy outlook, the mouthfeel comes much milder and retains a refreshing level at best; all in all, this medium-bodied amber ale is perhaps the lightest and least complex I've come across for a Belgian winter ale, and remarkably so IMO as a quaffable ale in winter."
"Head lasts longer than the beer, remaining in the glass for several hours after the last sip."
"Large Belgian brown bomber, caged and corked. I could not understand the numbers that were printed on the label (freshness info?) Pours darker amber, with a moderate reddish hue. Lively carbonation initially (pour with care) resulting in a loose and active head, that calms down and then lives a thick outer ring. The lacing is slippery and thick. Fruity/spiced nose, interesting and different. Zesty, slightly sour brown ale. Dark fruits, blackberry life saveresque. Perhaps some light winter spicing. Sweet/sour/spiced. Interesting and tasty brew, perhaps festive is the best way to describe it. I enjoyed this one, if you appreciate the variety and eccentricity of Belgian brewing this one is worth a try"
"Very drinkable. Especially after swirling some of the carbonation out."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable and refreshing. Pretty nice."
"D- I'm still conflicted whether this was meant to be a sour beer. That said I really enjoyed this as a sour beer, I found the chocolate malts to be odd in said sour beer. However this turned into a great introduction to sour beers for my roommate. I'd recommend giving it a try. My bottle was from the 2007-2008 winter, I wonder if a 2008-2009 Winter Ale is sour as well or if this is something that has developed more throughout the cellaring."
"I bought this at Roof Brothers Liquors in Paducah, Ky. Kane says it's a red ale but I don't know."
"Notes: My first of the Petrus beers, I bought almost all of them at beers of the world in Rochester before finding this Winter Ale here in Cleveland. I have yet to sample those other ones but this may be the best winter ale that I have had."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. The BDA pours a clear honey brown color with an airy egg shell colored head that settled into a light cap. The aroma is light, some vinous attributes, sweet overall. The taste is sweet toasted malt, similar to an amber ale, has a lemony tartness and a subtle earthy spice. The feel is fairly light, tons of carbonation, finishes tart and sweet. A medicore BDA, no outstanding flavors, a tad over-carbonated. Basically bought it for the glass."
"Very smooth and easy to drink. The carbonation goes down easily. A sippable beer."
"D - Easy drinker, especially on a colder day this could go down very easily."
"The beer pours with a very froathy, strongly efforvescent appearance of amber, rust, and brown colored haze. Firm, but light aromas of apples, with a white grape, vineous, zinfindale quality. A follow up of confectionate maltiness, lightly-tart berries, and a mild fruitcake scent permiates the wine-like qualities. Flavors closely mimic the aromas while placing emphasis on the malt sweetness and body, and the yeasty spiciness. The berry-like attributes shine more and more as the beer warms. The beer is soft and nearly evaporates as it hits the mouth. The carbonation lifts the beer without any bite or astringency. Acidic throughout, which leads to a clean, refreshing spicy finish. This beer is more akin to Belgian Ambers with little hint of it being more wintery than any other beer. Still quite nice and palatable."
"D- Very drinkable nothing really off putting just not really on target."
"Medium full body & effervescence. Slightly crisp with a mildly dry finish. A good but weird brew. Very disconnected throughout."
"Drinkability- Decent."
"A three finger rocky tan head almost jumps out of the glass. Body is a rich murky dark brown. Nose is huge, invigorating, and very complex. You get notes of spicey biscuits, creamy vanilla, honey and raw sweet dough with a hint of pepper. A unique mix of soured, tartfruity feel and pepery doughy spice enters the mouth on first sip. There is a nice crispness that resembles a green apple and a powdery spice feel that is even and long lasting on the end of the palate. Mouthfeel is realatively clean but does have a bit of thickness. Drinkability is solid."
"I am a sucker for Santa Claus so I picked up a few bottle of Petrus Winterbier when I saw the jolly old guy on a sled on the label. Nothing remarkable or bad about the head or appearance...just kind ""was"". Wait, I take that back -- there was a lot of carbonation. It smelled of sweet vingar and not too much else. Not surprisingly, the taste of vingar was apparent and I was sort of stuck on that. It was also quite thin and watery. I kept sipping hoping to enjoy the next sip a little more but I really didn't. Despite the carbonation, it left me flat. It was not aweful but just not as satisfying as I would have hoped."
"Overflowed bottle immediately upon opening. Poured into glass a hazy golden brown with thin white head that lingered a while, more than covering surface in a trappist glass. Alcoholic, spicy honey aroma. Mild flavors of nutmeg and a pleasing, mellow tartness. Lightly bready yeast also present. Astringent but not outrageously so. Lingering thin bitterness."
"A rather bland Belgian Dark Ale that is not so wintery except maybe for some warming alcohol that creeps up."
"Drinkability is so-so. I think one would do me good on these guys."
"I think it is an alright Belgium dark, but not one of my favorites, not even one of my favorite winter beers, I wouldnt go and search it down, but if someone offered it to me I would drink it again, the glass that came in the box is pretty cool though."
"Pours a slightly clouded amber with some head. Nose is malty...and at first I thought I got a whiff of something like burnt toast. Basically this one has the aroma of a strong and very sweet Belgian. Flavor is strong with a syrupy sweetness. Borders on too much. Though the following sips seem to be more tolerable. Caramel tone is heavy as well. Feel is slightly syrupy, though not a lot of carbonation - but a bit above the average. Very drinkable as it is smoother as you go on. I could easily go for a few of these if I was sitting and relaxing in the cold winter."
"Fairly drinkable, depending on your tolerance for citrus flavor. I may buy this again, due to its relatively cheap ($4 for 11.2oz) price as a Belgian, but won't rush myself to do so."
"Petrus winter pours a brown/ruby color with a persistent head. Be aware of the cork and the fizz when opening, i almost broke the light fixture on my ceiling, and soaked my carpet the first time i opened one of these. the first thing i notice is the intense carbonation not too common in belgian winters. after recooping from the first sip i took a second, fizzy at first, then flemish sour red ale flavors start to dominate,but without the strong sour taste. this was a nice experience to smell and taste the vinous flavors without puckering my lips on the first ten drinks, and with carbonation which is almost non existent in alot of flemish reds. the finish is slightly hoppy. not a great winter warming effect, but a great afternoon refresher ( relatively speaking) interesting to say the least. Not what i expected from a belgian winter, but still quite good. beware the cork! it is a missile!"
"D: A good, drinkable winter beer from Petrus/Bavik. Will definitely buy this one again when I can find it, a solid brew."
"Drinkability: Where to begin? There is something very nice about this beer that I really want to like, drawing on some of the better elements of other Petrus beers; however, the foamy tendencies as well as the understated flavor profile dilute the beer's potential; this could be extraordinary if the flaws were removed"
"This is the first I've seen this beer in Ohio, since they had a thing about Santa Claus on beer bottles, especially if they are holding a beer like this one. This beer poured a medium light clear amber color and formed a very foamy off white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A heavy amount of carbonation is present, probably why the cork exploded off. The aroma is of candy, cherries and lightly of malt and yeast. The flavor is of malt, chocolate and cherries. The body is medium light and the finish sweet yet tart. I didn't find it as sour as some others, but this may be due to this year's vintage, or my natural tolerance/affinity for sour candy."
"Finish is sweet and sour."
"d: A nice beer, sourness was a surprise. 6.5 abv is pretty well hidden. I wonder what effect the aging had? May have contributed to sourness. Certainly worth a try, but not outstanding."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Fruity at first, making me think of sour green apples or lemons. It's on the dry side, and a bit milder than I was expecting. It's not terribly heavy and the finish is brief and pretty clean, making it very drinkable. This is a pleasant winter beer, nothing exceptional perhaps, but nice."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Very nice beer. A bit more flavor would be nice, but otherwise no complaints."
"I am a major Petrus Brune fan and buy it whenever I can, so this was a colossal disappointment. Still, I will have to give this a second chance somtime down the road."
"An OK beer in the drinkability department but it probably is far better in winter when experienced with a sweet spiced holiday treat like a German Christmas cookie. I will try this again sometime."
"Last swigs: A basic brown Belgie, but no flaws, just a tad basic."
"The malts are doughy , but not very sweet. There is a sour lactic flavor with some hints of butterscotch. Overall , the flavor intensity is pretty light, as is the mouthfeel. Most of the flavors were kind of scattered until it warmed and they melded and improved , but this is not up to what Petrus usually does. Maybe I shouldn't buy a winter ale at a reduced price in April."
"Not satisfaying."
"Afterthoughts... Just swirled in all of the yeasty sediment at the bottom of the bottle. What a difference! The smell smoothed out nicely, the taste produced light notes of cinnamon with the yeast being supressed (strangely), the mouthfeel took a chill, and the overall drinkability was improved. Scores reflect an extra half point added in all areas just mentioned."
"Overall not a bad beer. Strong yeasty taste in the nose after a tall head in a tulip glass. Looked good in the glass over a burnt caramel base with red highlights. Just not that complex in the taste, plenty of spice and light fruit, but not much overall. Disappointing for the name Petrus on the label compared to others of the brewery. Ok, not great."
"Pours a cloudy orange/brown with a huge head of off white bubbles. Very carbonated. A tinge of sourness in the aroma at first, but it quickly faded into a musty, wood smell. Only a hint of sweetness, well in the background. Taste is of fermenting peaches eaten with a wooden spoon. Not that I have done that Aftertaste is mildly sweet then fades into a nice earthy hop bitterness. More odd interesting than good interesting. Improves as it warms. Dont drink this too cold or you will be very disappointed. If you are looking for a Belgian Strong dark, pass on this one. As a holiday beer, it is Ok."
"Alas."
"Served in a snifter, this beer was a hazy amber peach colour with a thin off-white cap. The fine bubbles produced plenty of lace. Fruity aroma with notes of ripe peach and tropical fruit, plus a tart, earthy quality. The flavour was fairly complex, solid sweetness that was quite fruity, some tartness, mild caramel and vanilla, and oak. There was some tobacco and spice in the finish and a lingering woodiness with tart cherries. So dry it made my mouth water, carbonation was lively and the body was middle of the road. Nice stuff and a great finish to brunch, along with some dessert."
"While not the best of the Petrus stable...it's a solid offering which should not be turned down."
"Drinkability: Disappointing for the style, not a very good Winter offering."
"Pours a murky amberish brown color with a light tan colored head. Aroma is sweet and tart with bubblegum and citrus. Mouthfeel is crisp and prickly from the high level of carbonation in what may be too much carbonation. The taste much like the aroma is slightly tart with a very dry finish. Overall, this is a pretty decent brew that my really only gripe with is lack of character. It is a solid brew but lacks the character and depth that would make me want to come back to it in the future."
"D: Really didn't like this one much. Not alot of attractive qualities go along with the flavor. Pass in the future."
"Medium mouth that seems to have just a bit too much carbonation when combined with the flavors. Certainly drinkable and the right food pairing might help this beer."
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent beer. It comes across as a bit dry so I think that it has a bit of age on it. It is still good, but it would be a bit better to try a fresher example. It is not overly spicy like a lot of winter beers are, so I like that. I would like to try this again."
"I'm not sure how Christmasy this is but it is an interesting Belgium dark ale."
"I started drinking the beer when it was very cold and it wasn't very good, however I was outside on a hot day drinking it. As the temperature of the beer rose the taste became much better. The beer was dark in color and very drinkable, I would get this beer again."
"Notes: I've enjoyed beers from this brewery, although they haven't blown my mind with anything, its usually solid and interesting. The only major drawback on this obviously is I got some metallic and it got worse as it warmed up. Other than that it was above average."
"The smell is a poor mix of spice and caramel. The taste has more of the caramel and malt flavor and less of the spice. Some yeast funk is in there too. The mouthfeel is too light. Drinkability suffers with the flavor."
"Medium plus in body with a touch of alcoholic punch, make this brew a fairly easy drinker. OK mouthfeel, but not that impressive for a Belgian Winter offering...worth a try, cheers!"
"I spent $1.99 on the sixpack and really the only thing worth the money was the wooden bottle opener that came with it."
"."
"Cloudy orange with some head, and significant lace. Yeast and alcohol in aroma, not too much there. Taste is yeast, rather plain Belgium. A bit astringent and alcohol in mouthfeel.Mild spice. Finishable and moderately satisfying. Drying aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel."
"Very carbonated, foamed up some in the bottle and has a large head, but as it dissipates it leaves a little lace and is very rocky (and long-lasting too). The color is kind of pale copper. The aroma is a bit odd - I get a faint cheesy (!) smell, a llittle bit of perfumey esters, but it doesn't hit you over the head and I don't pick up a lot of malt either - maybe a hint. The flavor is good, though, with sweet maltiness dominating, kind of light on body and a little spritzy still, some light fruitiness and a definite alcohol warmth to the beer. Not overwhelming but solid."
"Poured a dark, cloudy, amber color with an off-white head that didn't move an inch for several minutes leaving behind rings of lace. A 1/6-inch head remained throughout the session. Aromas of caramel, hops, and grass were apparent to me. The hops were right upfront with a sweet, fruity finish that left my mouth dry and sticky. A bit strong in the aftertaste with a bread-like texture that really reduced its drinkability. Overall, this is a good tasting beer, but there are areas for improvement."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, pretty smooth, and dry."
"The head on this thing was crazy big. It started foaming, the instant it hit the glass. It kind of got a little annoying, but it looked so pretty. The smell wasn't very strong, so you really had to strain to smell anything. What I got was some spices, mixed with fruit, and alcohol. The taste wasn't too bad though. I got tastes of spices up front, with a caramel malt, a little honey, and some alcohol. Overall it was a fairly good beer except for a few little rough patches. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to try different winter beers."
"Overall a beer that I am glad that I tried. Very small, hidden flavors are all around. At times it doesn't meld well together."
"11.2oz bottle. Pours a garnet color and makes a bone hued head that flows over the top of my Petrus goblet. Head is long lasting and leaves quite a bit of lacing on my glass. Aroma is loaded up on dark dried fruits and sweet caramel malts. Flavor is slightly bitter and peppery, has some notes of raisin and fig, lightly sweet, and a hint of chocolate. Mouthfeel is light to medium and opens with some spicy carbonation, has a slightly dry finish. This isn't bad, but I had higher expectations for it."
"BB 02-10-06. Overwelming presentation with excessive gushing. What I cought in my glas had a very instable head soon completly gone. With it a brownamber beercollor and showing lots of haze. Nose is sour caramellic maltjuice with lots of alcohol. Taste is also very strongly alcoholic and very phenolic quiet spiced with pepper and cinnamon probably. Moderate bitterness and a overal dry carracter. Not exactly balanced mouthfeel and can't think it was ment to taste like this. Drinkable but was hard to get a good amount in the glass with this fontin comming out while opening the bottle."
"pours an even, murky red color. not much head, just a bleak bubbly crown. aroma is metallic and nutty reminiscent of a brown. some malty sugars bring this into belgian aroma.. mildly. not at all what i expect from a belgie noel (which is HUGENESS)... mouthfeel is pleasant in a medium way. big on carbonation and spry despite its age (1 yr). smooth and creamy sugar evolution from belgian malts evoke brown sugar and very light fruits. not at all bad, and probably one of the best petrus beer out there. unfortunately, their best doesn't measure up to what's available out there in belgium. still, a drinkable and enjoyable beer. not at all a winter, closer to a dubbel.... try it for shots and goggles."
"I poured from the bottle into a Belgian glass. The beer is a deep amber color, and unbelievably bubbly. You can watch the bubbles shoot to the top the whole time you drink it! The aroma is clean and refreshing, but very understated. The first sips are slightly malty, perhaps a bit oaky????, and you are left with a slightly hoppy (very slight!) and VERY dry tingle on the tongue. This beer tastes much lighter than you'd expect--for a winter beer, it is very light. A year round drinker, if you ask me!"
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed minimal 1/4"" beige head. Beer was translucent dark copper, with tons of particulate matter which is suspended and does not settle (and I decanted carefully). Head settles at half height, and lacing is average to good. Aroma is lightly of spicing and sweetness, but lacking here for a Belgian. Taste is lightly spicy malts, with delicate hopping and a crisp, dry finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and drinkability is good as well. Expected much better, even though I will admit the bar was probably set high."
"This was an older bottle (maybe 2 years) according to the store rep. Beyond the particulate juggle, Winterbier was enjoyable."
"A clean copper/orange beer. Has a big beige head,with some lace. The aroma has at first a fruity sweetness which becomes more of a malty sweetness and there is strong sour note in the background. The flavor starts of with a smooth maltiness that flows right into a light sour note. This all finishes with a nice spicey peppery bite on the end."
"Hushed, almost still aromatics are doughy and pulpy. Brown breads, vanilla, raisins and sweet spices are just barely there. In the mouth it's creamy with wooly tannins. Ripe red berries, black pepper, and starchy spice husks occupy the broad texture beautifully. Vigorous, fine fizz provides an equal amount of structure as the nutty, tangy bitter extractions. It's bone dry -- a surprise considering all of the sweet aromatics."
"This brew is a dull brown color, thick and murky. Bubbly cream colored head on the top. Nose is fruit notes. Caramel sweetness along with bready malt. Lots of fruit tones, slight hop backbone. Alcohol becomes more apparent with some warmth. Somewhat thinner mouthfeel. Nothing amazing, but not the end of the world."
"Drinkability- Wish the abv was a tad more so it would cross over to the sweet side, but as it is, it's a pretty good winter beer. Was about what I was expecting."
"What makes Petrus Winterbier a winter beer isn't immediately obvious. It tastes like a Belgian dark ale and not an especially noteworthy one. I have little doubt that if it had been more appropriately carbonated, it would have been a much better beer. As is, I'll shed no tears over what was lost on my desktop."
"Overall, this was a pretty big disappointment. Petrus Winterbier was one-dimensional and pretty listless. With all the other Christmas beers available, I won't be back for another one of these again."
"Not horrible, but nothing special either."
"A decent beer, but not quite as special as Bavik would like you to think with the christmas packaging promotion. A run of the mill double, not worth the extra price. Save yer money and go get yourself a 6'er of New Belgium Abbey:)"
"This beer exploded out of the bottle as if it was a shaken bottle of champaign. What ended up in the glass was a nice reddish amber with a huge light tan head. The smell is spicy and wine like. The taste is very mild, there isn't a lot of flavor. It is highly carbonated. The mouthfeel is pretty good. Overall it's pretty good but I wouldn't buy it often."
"As disturbing looking as this one poured, it was darn good!"
"Pours a translucent light brown-slight copper color with a pretty white, medium-sized head. Aroma is sweetish with a lightly raosted malt and gentle spiciness. The aroma is soft and gentle compared to many winter offerings. Flavor follows through from the aroma- no big surprises, nice winter spice touch, but everything soft and gentle. Good, but hard to find anything that really grabs me."
"Fruity and slightly spicy in flavor, with a lot of lemon citrus to it. Alcohol is very noticeable, though not overdone, and begins to warm the body very quickly. This tastes much more like a lighter Belgian ale than the darker brew it actually is. I'm not blown away or anything, but it's pretty tasty."
"Bronze in color with a good deal of tan head that recedes a bit faster than I expected.Aroma is very sweet and I expected (wrong) a syrupy brew. Spicey with a prickly, but just shy of medium mouthfeel. Not a very complex beer, but still very tastey. The sixxer comes with a nice bottle opener too."
"Beautiful dark amber beer that casts a deep ruby glow when held up to the light. This beer is topped by a voluminous cream colored head that seems to hold indefinately. Aroma is a bit spicy with a yeast aroma that is typical of belgian-styled beers. Decent phenols and such, but nothing noteworthy. The flavor is actually very clean and rather mild. A good dose of what tastes like coriander is present throughout, and there's a touch of dry sweetness on the finish. Otherwise, it's just a typical, dry belgian-styled ale. Perhaps a bit more hoppy than most as well. This beer looks nice, but otherwise is just a typical ale in holidy garb."
"A rust-colored brew with a head that stays quite well and leaves some lace. Aroma suggests sweet fruits and citrus with a lemon twang and a touch of spiciness from the yeast. Spicy hops and yeast on the tongue, but without the maltiness and full-body that I usually expect from a winter beer. Not much complexity either. Too much carbonation for a good mouthfeel. Not bad, but not something I'd have again."
"Appearance: Amber nut brown with an off white cream head leaves behind fine Belgian style lacing. Aroma: Candi sugar, ripened fruit undertones with a sweet malt this is nice and slightly more subtle than most Belgian Xmas ales. Taste: Sweet candi sugar jumps out once again, upront slight toasted malts fruit soaked in alcohol very tasty. Mouthfeel: Medium-light body nice strong carbonation. Drinkability: Nice and easy going Christmas ale but solid enough to be memorable to me."
"Rich, orangy brown tint with a big beige to tan head. Malty, spicy and estery sour tones come through in the aroma. Tastes malty and a touch sour and the spices in the beer seem to show up most in the finish. Candied fruit in the finish, too. Nice brew, posesses Oud Bruin qualities and winterbeer qualities, too. Spritzy on the tongue. Maintains a decent lacing. Reasonable ABV (2003s are 7%) makes it drinkable in the longer term."
"A good beer, though not amongst the best of the holiday season. Still, if I saw it, I might have it again."
"There are far better Belgian beers that I would recommend over this one. This would probably be a good beer to introduce to the bland beer drinking masses. Come to think of it, share this beer with the uninitiated, they would really enjoy it. While I didn't hate this beer, I just found it to be plain. It's not bad, it's not good, it's simply average."
"The beer pours a translucent deep ruby color with a mastodonic head, creamy in texture and a bright light tan color with the lace forming a tight sealing sheet that smothers the glass. The nose is vanilla sweet, with a thick malt presence, also a bit of over ripe banana noticed, a very pleasing and a bodement of things to come. Front is ambrosial, rich in malt with a middling top, that leads to a strikingly acidic finish, hops are personable in their spicy bite, desert dry aftertaste that lingers long on the palate, a perfect end of the evening beer, and as a beer I salute all Beer Lovers where ever you are on this Thanksgiving Eve in 2003, hopefully next year at this time we can give thanks for World Peace, a dream but it is my wish today."
"I would like to think that this is just an old, poorly cared-for bottle. A pleasant experience this beer was not. Uck."
"I thought this was a bit light for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, and said so myself during my 03 review, but during the style revisions this one was changed to a Belgian Dark Ale. Having said that, it was pretty darn good. I re-rated this bad boy and, overall, the score went from a 3.05 to a solid 4.0."
"Medium orange color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and yeasty, with a touch of caramel sweetness. A medium bodied ale. Yeasty and slightly fruity. It not very spicy especially for a Belgian. Malts are mild, slightly sweet and a touch applish. Kind of tart. Very drinkable, but kind of mild and not very interesting. Very un-Belgian like. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Comments: Aroma teased, taste punished."
"Carefully poured it's only slightly hazy; although it's difficult to keep from disturbing the sediment and allowing flakes of particulate to come into play (how old are these bottles?). Its thin white head drops readily but it maintains a creamy collar throughout the goblet. Lacing is limited. The aroma is malty and cake-like with a sugary note of vanilla and a touch of mild spice. It's alcohol becomes apparent as it warms. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth due to its medium body and very fine, natural carbonation. There's more fruit (cherry, raisin) in the flavor than the nose indicates; and the vanilla remains, along with some light caramel and rum. It's exceptionally well-balanced by a restrained bitterness, and the finish is simply a long dissolving of the flavor already present in the mouth as a drying bitterness slowly rises. Rich, malty, fruity, exciting. Quite a remarkable beer!"
"Drinkability & Notes: Nothing special but still tasty, at least the six pack came with a cool wooden bottle opener. I was expecting a more flamboyant brew ..."
"The wife picked this up for me. I was none to impressed by anything but the bottle. Something about a fat man on a sled. Some earthiness and hops, but overall, not a very exciting ale. It did have a little ""tart"" sting to t, but just non-eventful."
"For a winter styled ale, this brew really lacks a lot of hearty characteristics to give it the enjoyable palette one would hope to have in its presentation. Disappointing all the way around."
"Instead; get one from Dubuisson (Scaldis), De Dolle, Achouffe.."
"Aroma is tart and a little fruity, like cider about to turn. Some earthiness. Bit of sour cherry or vinegar, but some sweetness. Off-white thin foamy head atop a slightly hazy amber-brown liquid. Low soft carbonation and medium watery body. In general the taste is pretty watery. Mild tart/sweet start with a bit of apple cider vinegar. Very subdued flavors. Finishes mildly with a bit of astringency but no bitterness. Mild choke cherry after and leaves taste buds dry. Overall, kind of weak in taste."
"This was one of the better Belgians I have tasted in awhile. The iced tea comparisons are true because of the Amber/Copper color. Definite sediment floating about. Nice head that lasts for a bit. Crisp apple/malt flavor. Very drinkable."
"Fairly clear coppery-amber brew. Small head, but solid retention. I wasn't paying enough attention, and poured this quite vigorously, dumping in huge, chunky yeast-floaties. No big deal, though. Smell of tart apples and cherries with raisin in a rich and sweet caramel malt base. Taste not nearly as tart as I expected, based on the smell. Flavor dominated by smooth, creamy caramel with subdued hints of fruit. Very smooth, almost velvety mouthfeel. Excellent brew, but the 8.4 oz bottle is entirely too small."
"An okay beer, but a bit underwhelming for a Winter/Christmas beer, especially a Belgian one. Considering the price tag, I won't be having this again."
"Poured a murky ice-tea brown. Aroma was a crisp white wine. Fairly light in flavor - grape-like white wine up front, quickly fading into a mildly bitter and dry finish. Not much middle to this beer - it zips from start to finish and is gone. It is deceptively easy to drink. Stacked up against other Belgian beers, it does not have much depth and falls short, but, for some darn reason, I like it anyway. Is there such a thing as a Belgian ""lawnmower beer?"""
"This beer poured a golden yellow-orange with a light tan head. The aroma was sweet and warm with hints of orange peel, coriander, and mace in the back ground. I was however disappointed with the taste and body of this beer. It started out with a nice balance of malt, spice, and carbonation. There was even a hint of hop spiciness heading into the finish. But then there was nothing. No after taste or lingering alcohol or spicy warmth. For such a great start it had a disappointing finish. There is plenty of sediment in the bottle, perhaps it needs a little more aging. For a Petrus product I was very disappointed."
