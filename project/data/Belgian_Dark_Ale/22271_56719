3.04,-13.9,3.5,2.5,3.25,3.75,2.75,"Pours a hazed dark copper with a bubbly, dense light tan head. Thick clumps of lace and long lasting retention. Buttery nose, bready, plums, caramel, bubblegum and dough. Thick, full body with light carbonation and a cloying finish. Flavor is dominated by malt, doughy and bready, bubblegum sweet and minimal yeast. Not bad, but not much contribution from the Trappist yeast and too sweet.","yourefragile","Sep 08, 2013"

3.94,11.6,4,3.75,4,4,4,"The malt and hop notes were meshed very well with the trappist yeast. The price on this beer and alcohol level are perfect and really a great way to enjoy a beer with the quality of Chimay or Orval but without the price.","Entropy501","Jun 30, 2013"
3.99,13,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Cathedral Square certainly has an interesting product here. There is a candy- like component to the taste and the complexity doesn’t quit. It isn’t a session beer for these and other reasons, but that should take nothing away from the tasting experience. I liked it more and more with each passing sip and I recommend seeking it out.","BryanCarey","May 24, 2013"

4.2,19,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Brewed with an authentic Trappist yeast. The lacing is simply amazing; light haze in the reddish brown color. Brown bread, mango, plum pudding, banana taffy and some lemongrass all make for a complex nose. Toasty and sweet maltiness plays off the palate very well; well-rounded smoothness and a creamy medium body adds to the drinkabil- ity. Kiss of alcohol is clean with a small hit of dried fruit. Hints of spice and herb in the semidry finish. Someone did their research here—we closed our eyes and thought we were in a café in Belgium.","BeerAdvocate","Dec 14, 2011"
3.02,-14.4,4.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Ok but a little rough around the edges. So far, this brewery has not impressed me much. Maybe it will just take time for them to refine their recipes.","bnes09","Aug 31, 2011"
3.35,-5.1,4,4,3,3.5,3,"Overall, I wasn't too terribly impressed, but I certainly wasn't upset in any way at all either. There definitely needs to be more malt, but the beer was very drinkable. This seems to be a pretty fresh brewery, and the fact that their bombers retailed 2 for $7 makes me think that they are fully aware that they have lots of room to grow. I wish them all the best.","TheWhiskerReview","Jun 13, 2011"
2.5,-29.2,3,3,2,3,2.5,"Overall a step in the right direction, but needs more malt backbone. Improve upon this, and it may eventually become worthy in my opinion.","TheSarge","Mar 26, 2011"
3.5,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle, into a pint glass. It poured a clear reddish amber color. It produced a decent white head, and head retention was very good. Above average amount of lacing. The aroma was earthy, burt malt and toffee. The beer was medium in body. Well carbonated. The taste was malty and dominated by an earthy toffee taste and it finishes slightly sweet and has a bit of a bitter hop flavor. Interesting beer. By far my favorite beer from Cathedral Square.","GossageBrewery","Mar 25, 2011"
3.26,-7.6,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Slightly cloudy brown with hints of orange under a creamy off white head. There is a metallic smell, with some roasted malts and a little yeasty musty smell. The taste has a nice heavy malty nuttiness, a little woody bitterness, and a hint of dark fruit like a plum. It has a heavy mouthfeel with tight carbonation, fairly drinkable.","orsulacp","Feb 16, 2011"
2.7,-23.5,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Medium to light bodied with rather high carbonation.","meatmallet","Feb 12, 2011"
3.42,-3.1,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Brown color, very thin head, decent lacing. An average looking beer. Smells pleasant, smells sweet with a touch of a fruit like cherry. Taste: Very light on hops, heavy on maltiness, a touch of honey and cherries. I think the mouthfeel is a little too watery for this sort of beer, there's not enough heft to the beer. But it's pretty enjoyable and easy to drink. It reminded me more of a brown ale than a Belgian ale.","jar2574","Dec 26, 2010"
3.67,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability: Easy drinking beer. The taste leaves a little to be desired.","Zundo","Nov 26, 2010"
3.08,-12.7,4,3.5,3,3,2.5,"M & D - Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some fluffy CO2 but not as complex as expected. Drinkability is low on this one not a winner in my book.","JoEBoBpr","Aug 19, 2010"
3.62,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear, dark amber color. One and one quarter inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, dark citrus, alcohol, earthy malt, slight citrus, and slight hop. Broadly the style of a Belgian Dark Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of earthy malt, hint of butter, slight roasted malt, slight hop, and a hint of citrus. Overall, good complexity, good aroma, but the earthy notes dominate near the end.","Tone","May 20, 2010"
3.35,-5.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Drinkability: Certainly a noble effort from a relatively new brewery, but it falls a bit shy of the mark. I'd say it could benefit from a little boost in the body and carbonation. Still, it's by no means a bad beer.","ChainGangGuy","May 16, 2010"
3.63,2.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D - I took down the bomber in relatively easy fashion - nice session beer. This was a solid introduction to Cathedral Square. This was a good Abbey Ale, one that I will visit again.","birchstick","May 07, 2010"
3.58,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D - Intriguing, to say the least. Listed as a Belgian dark ale works I guess, because it's not a dubbel or a Belgian strong ale. The smoky character is truly unique in a Belgian styled brew.","zeff80","Apr 29, 2010"
3.75,6.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Got this at one of my favorite local bars and it's pretty rare I see a beer I'm not familiar with, so I had to give it a try. Pours a deep red copper color with a decent head that laces a bit, smell is like a rich biscuity maltiness, it is similar to fat tire in a lot of ways. Taste is similar too, doesn't really taste like a true Belgian ale, but more like a red ale, doesn't make it a bad beer just IMHO not a true Belgian style.","1fastz28","Apr 16, 2010"
3.53,0,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Malty notes of caramel and molasses on the nose, followed by a light green apple fruitiness. Fruitier on the palate, but still malt-forward, again showing caramel and molasses, yet with a walnut note mid-palate. Finishes moderately dry with a yeasty twang.","wnh","Apr 11, 2010"
3.89,10.2,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Impression: Not bad, I guess I have easy access to crazy amounts of finest belgian styles beers and judge this one harshly. Wouldn't seek it out, but don't pass it by.","cavedave","Mar 15, 2010"
3.41,-3.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The taste as a bit more of the tree needles and fruity Belgian yeast. If it just had some more hops it would be more like a brown ale. I'll take New Belgium for half the price.","brownbeer","Mar 10, 2010"
