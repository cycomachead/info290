The chocolate is one element in a mix of roasty flavors, but the chocolate doesn't overwhelm the stout.  The beer is just a little tart, and has a bit of bitterness (like coffee bitterness, not the effect of hops).  This beer is not sweet at all.  Very tasty.","VashonGuy","Jan 18, 2015"

Aroma is chocolate up front, with some raisin, molasses, fig, and dark roasted malt notes. The taste was nearly identical to the smell, with great chocolate flavor and some nice almost sour yeast taste. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, very smooth, with a somewhat dry finish. Overall, this was quite a nice beer, next time I'd like to try one fresh to see how the aging treated this beer.","timontheroad","Dec 28, 2014"

Subdued smell with cocoa, dark malt, coffee and herbal notes.  Taste starts off sweet, some chat notes from the malt and some sweet dark fruit notes come through.  Chocolate makes a big appearance mid palate starting sweet and ending bitter with some herbal hop flavor and coffee.  Mouthfeel is medium body and medium carbonation which starts active on the palate and goes fully creamy with some slight dryness.  Overall I wasn't sure what to expect but this was an enjoyable beer that brought chocolate flavors with a good balance of sweet and bitter.","HopBomb515","Nov 06, 2014"

Huge bubbling, with a very decent lacing left behind along the glass. Nose of not much, really, with subtle cocoa and yeast funk. Disappointing. Flavors are subtle cocoa forward, with funky Belgian yeast tang and floral highlights. Subtle sourness atop a building bitter backbone. The body is rich and smooth, with a sweet, rich, slightly roasted aftertaste. The finish is smooth, with a bittersweet linger. I have to admit, I had very high expectations of this.","GarthDanielson","Jan 26, 2014"
3.41,-10.5,4,3,3.5,4,3.25,"The beer pours a dark, chocolate brown, which is exactly the color it should be. The beer forms a head that sits a half-of-a-finger’s-width above the beer with medium sized, pebble-like bubbles that are a dark khaki color. On the nose, the beer smells distinctly of Ommegang’s house yeast. Fruity esters with a touch of spice whirl across the nose suggesting peach, pepper, hay, and just a ghost of milk chocolate. This smells a bit like a saison, if I’m being honest. If I were smelling this beer blindfolded, I would not have known it was a stout. The nose is disappointingly weak for a stout. On the tongue, the beer tastes softly sweet with a light bitter roast, a distinct fruity/spicy yeast funk with touch of acidity in the cheeks. This beer tastes like a saison, though. In flavor, the beer begins as fruity esters blending with peach, spicy pepper, touches of creamy banana, and some clove. This moves to lightly bitter grass and herbs that slowly blend with soft coco and milk chocolate that are very subtle. The finish returns lots of spicy esters and banana phenols and leaves me wanting more chocolate. The yeast gives off great funky flavors that are delightfully Belgian and fruity, but the beer is called “Chocolate Indulgence” and I want way more chocolate in the flavor. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a higher carbonation that provides a nice fluff to the tongue with a light bite. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and suggests “stout” the most to me. There is a slickness in the mouth as the beer leaves, and a scrim of sticky saliva is left on the tongue. Overall, I’m disappointed with Chocolate Indulgence because it does not have enough chocolate. I’ve seen Ommegang’s house yeast before, and think it would do well if it were subtly added to a stout, but as is the yeast character is domineering the beer and leaving me wanting variety. This beer is interesting, but fails in its promise. If it weren’t called “Chocolate Indulgence” I would have had to stretch to note the chocolate flavors hidden in the beer. I want more chocolate!","Maxwell","Jan 25, 2014"

It's fine beer for the Winter but this was just a bit too strong and light in mouthfeel for the style it was placed in. Go ahead and grab a good milk chocolate bar to have with this, just to even things out a bit.","JerzDevl2000","Feb 01, 2013"

I'm getting some chocolate in the smell, but it's not aggressive. I'm also getting mild yeast spice and some dark fruit in the nose. The flavor is chocolatey, but I would say it's more delicate than indulgent. The chocolate carries through the whole sip, but the bitterness from the roasted malt builds in the finish. That bitterness is the only thing that sticks with me after the sip. I would have liked the chocolate to stick around a bit longer. The carbonation is creamy but the body of the beer doesn't quite live up to that. This is a solid beer, but doesn't quite live up to the name.","oline73","Jan 15, 2013"

Feel is fairly smooth, w/ a little hop bite in the background. Overall, this beer has been hit of miss for me. The recent beers I've had have not measured up to the ones I've had several years ago.

When you take a sip you notice that this beer is definitely chocolate-y, but not all that sweet. Some bitter notes come through and make you think of a decadent dark chocolate. Roasted malts and touches of coffee are also present and help round this beer out.","jmvecchio1","Jul 13, 2011"

Medium carbonation on a medium-light body; goes down pretty easy. Overall, I was expecting more of a chocolate bomb given the name, but this was still a pretty solid, standard stout. Even though I was expecting this to substitute for dessert, I actually think the dryness would complement something sweet quite well.","pmarlowe","Jun 23, 2011"

In fact, his father specifically noted that the sweet enzymes in eggplant skins had more than enough c6h1206 for any growing boy. He longed for the sweet succor of candy but was systematically denied all of his life. But that was then, and this is the Freshman Year at VASSAR. The first 3 days he kept a cool demeanor around the buffet and ate according to tradition. On the third night, the revelation ensued. The local 7-11 attendant witnessed the raiding of what appeared to be a diabetic madman. Johnathon clutched the paper bag and almost sprinted home and locked the door. Scarcely had he pulled the shades when he dug straight into rolos and sixlets, cascading waves of joy and endorphins, snoballs and watchamacallits. The whole experience just hit his bloodstream like pure heroin. His roomate walked in abruptly and found Johnathon hunched over the chocolate gooey mess, “THIS ISN’T WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!” “B- Johnathon, where are your PANTS?”","SubpoenaDeuces","Jun 20, 2011"

Opened it up a few days later and love it's rich black pour. The head was brown a foamy. The smell was roasted and burnt with a nose full of Belgian dark chocolate and some yeast. The taste was chocolatey and had a nice transition from sweet to bitter. The mouthfeel was pretty thick and very smooth.

4.25,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Overall, what we found to be the strongest point of this beer was the mouthfeel. It was outrageously smooth and slick, easily gliding around the mouth. On an interesting note, it was unexpected to have such a strong yeast characteristic, even more so that it was so “Belgian” seeming. It was certainly a nice aspect to keep this beer unique.

Dark chocolate is just the beginning of the wide array of aromas which include sweet malts, yeast, and a red grape, wine-like sensation. The smooth but bold body tickles my tongue with a cornucorpia of chocolates, malts, pepper, and yeast which yields a slight but noted dry finale. I guess I liked it better than a majority of the previous reviewers.","puboflyons","Apr 22, 2011"

The smell is fresh (is that hops?) and roasty malt that has some chocolate character to it. There are lots of hops up front as well as some malty chocolate. The alcohol is fairly noticeable which is strange in a 7% beer. The aftertaste is roasty malt and slightly bitter, reminiscent of dark chocolate. This beer is very foamy and full in its texture.

Flavor has a sharp acidity from the dark roasted malts and dark chocolate additions, some nice balance from the herbal hops in the background. Definitely not a dessert beer, I was picturing sweet super chocolate decadence. However it was a nice quaffable dark Belgian style dry dark chocolate infused ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied somewhat astringent with bitterness off the dark chocolate/dark roasted malts. Carbonation is nice lively somewhat effervescent, mouthfeel was smooth. Drinkability was decent nothing too sweet or candy bar milk chocolate about it.

For this to be a belgian, there isn't any belgian yeast pressence. It's not strong enough to be considered a stout either. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is at a good level.

Chocolate is the highlight of the flavors, although it is balanced well by slight caramel, touch of raisins and plums, and cream. A toasty and sweetish finish makes for a great dessert beer. Indeed, this went very well with pumpkin pie, apple pie, and cheesecake! The mouthfeel is thicker than expected, yet not quite in the RIS range. Of course, this is a Belgian style beer.

The appropriately cocoa colored head rises to about three fingers in height and shows both impressive lacing and retention. All things considered a very nice looking beer. There's some milk chocolate to the nose, but I was expecting a bit more. Even more than that, a general roastiness dominates in terms of aromas. There's a bit more to CI's flavor, but it still winds up disappointing somewhat. Again, any chocolate is largely drowned out by the taste of roasted grains up front. There's a subtle kick of spice from the yeast, before a pleasant mellow coffee swirl closes things out. The body is a bit on the dry side for a beer that's supposedly ""indulgent", but not too much. This minor fault is somewhat masked by a slightly lower than expected carbonation. All in all the mouthfeel ends up feeling a bit small for the beer. This is the first beer from Ommegang that's really failed to meet my expectations, though it's still not a bad beer. One could say it's poorly brewed or just poorly named, but either way, it falls short of being chocolate indulgence.","axeman9182","0"

Taste is not as strong as I had heard. It's like a laid-back young's double chocolate with some clove and cinnamon-like spice. Mouthfeel is this and bubbly.

3.85,1,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"The taste is a bit complex with lots going on. The key is to let the beer settle in a bit. The beer is definitely creamy and some of the sharper metallic yeastiness that other reviewers commented on seems to fade a bit as things settle in. The dark malts, the chocolate, the creaminess, and the tangy yeastiness define this beer. There is a slight booziness lurking underneath, there is some leafy hop popping through that dries this beer out in parts. There is some metallic and tinny flavors that do detract somewhat. There is a raw yeastiness to the beer that detracts as well. The chocolate and bittering dark malts are quite nice, blend nicely with the thick creaminess of the beer. The mouthfeel is quite pronounced. It is a bit oily, a bit prickly, drying, and biting a bit. The aftertaste is about right, enough to let you know you've had a substantial stout, not too lingering though. There is a touch of the boozy imperial type stout in this beer, and I'm less enamored with that part of the beer. Overall, it is a nice beer, not brilliant, but quite enjoyable.","albern","Jan 25, 2010"

Mmm, wonderfully roasty and toasty stout taste. Roasted malt and coffee bean flavors dominate, but there are hints of bitter cocoa in the background. Also seems to have a slight mustiness to the flavor that may be the yeast strain. This is a full bodied beer, but the mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, if a little bit sticky at the end.

Mouthfeel is nice and slick on the tounge without being too heavy, though I was surprised by the amount of carbonation. Taste is caramel sweetness in the front with toast, toffee, a bit of char, then a suggestion of dark chocolate which does not overpower. Drinkability will get a high score despite the 750 ml serving size - if I ever found this on tap I wouldn't be able to stay away from it.

Not as much chocolate as I expected in the flavor either. I drank the second half of the beer when eating some Ghiradelli chocolates and that really made the hops stand out.

The mouthfeel starts medium light with moderate carbonation, becoming more creamy as the CO2 falls off. The taste has a fleeting malt sweetness up front that dries out nicely, almost chalky, with a slightly tart and sometimes metalic aftertaste. It was a nice sipping beer that lasted me throughout most of Game 2 of World Series 09. The final pour of my 750 ml seemed much smoother, but with a slightly bitter finish.

Rich and thick on the palate, full of chocolate and vanilla with a bitterness of espresso and burnt caramel. There is also an herbal quality to it, reminiscent of licorice or root beer. Rolling carbonation keeps this smooth and lush, and although this is very thick and creamy, the finish is quite dry and clean, with a lingering tang of bittersweet cocoa.

I am enjoying this one better than the fresh bottle I had, it seems the 10 months in the cellar were beneficial. The dark plum-like fruitiness is almost too prevalent and takes away a bit from the chocolate. There are some nice bready yeast characteristics here that work nicely and there is just a touch of grassy hops to add to the complex mix of flavors. This beer gets better with warming, nearly right up to room temperature. I like it, it is not what you think of upon just the title of the beer though, the chocolate is really just a team player here as many other components are just as noticeable.","twiggamortis420","0"

The only complaint is that it goes down to easy, to quick. It makes it to easy to drink fast giving way to less enjoyment.

Carbonation did not seem to be much in evidence but a swirl reproduced a healthy head over the surface of the glass. Smell of sweet cocoa, chocolate malt milkshake. Taste was rich and layered with cocoa and semi-sweet chocolate but an unsettling bitter middle and slightly astrigent swallow stopped me in my tracks. Long lasting, lingering choco-malt echoes were alternately pleasing and distracting. As with the taste, the mouthfeel was also a bit schizo with silky smooth and creamy notes contrasted with what seemed to be an unwelcome alcohol presence or a yeasty, malty twitch. I found that this beer had a lot of potential but somehow the whole was lesser than the sum of its parts, there was something that seemed to keep it off-balance somehow, making what could be a truly great beer - as one would expect from the name on the label - into merely a good beer.

The aroma was dry, cocoa powder and toasted coffee beans. The flavors were very big, liquid smoke, bittersweet chocolate, some hints of milk chocolate, rich roasted malt and a very long espresso finish. It did strike me as more bitter than I was expecting and for a beer named ""Chocolate Indulgence"" I felt the chocolate flavors were understated and lacking sweetness. The mouthfeel was smooth and the carbonation just right but it was a little light. Dare I say it? Watery. Ouch. For the price I really just couldn't convince myself to buy one.

Interesting, but I was looking more ""indulgent."" By the name and look of the bottle, I was imagining and hoping for a smooth, luscious chocolate flavor, more reminiscent of Young's Double Chocolate. Yet, it is a nice flavor. A bit thin on the mouthfeel. I know this is a belgian stout, but I was still looking for stouter body. All in all, quite good and quite drinkable. This is not available (I think) in Texas right now.

The beer is intensely dark, basically black, with a dense, tightly woven, tan head. The lace is thick and long lasting. The aroma is notably inviting. The first sensation is of roasted barley, mixed with a little highly modified malt...it's a nice dark-roast coffee aroma. Next, quickly following the first sniff, comes a baking chocolate aroma...dry, bitter, and very enticing. Sometimes a chocolate beer is overdone with sweet aromas, but that's not the case here. The taste is a lot more delicate than I expected. Moderately sweet, with a nice tug-of-war between the bitter roastedness and malt sweetness. This one is well balanced. Creamy, complex, and enjoyable. Hops are present, but bitterness and flavor are at a low level. The mouthfeel is creamy and satisfying.

The beer has a slight Belgian twang (phenolics, esters, and a funky wild yeast tartness) that came through in the nose and taste, but the appearance was a dark ruby color and the beer also had a detering metalic / blood taste that I didn't prefer much. After a few pours into the glass, I decided to mix it up a bit. After which, the beer released a huge mix of Stout, Cocoa, Roasted barley, and sweet maltiness that drowned out that metalic taste and made the beer quite wonderful. From there on out, the beer took on big Russian Imperial Stout characteristics. The fruitiness and sherry-like aging wasn't there, but the big boost of cocoa helped to round the beer into a complex, yet simple treat.","BEERchitect","Dec 31, 2007"

I smell roasted hops, dark bitter chocolate, a hint of alcohol, and some residual sugars. The taste is chocolatey, a little much sugar, dark roasted flavors, a little bitter, some oak, and a hint of alcohol. The roast and the sugar are not as balanced as I would like, but still pretty palatable. The mouthfeel is ok, there's a little too much carbonation I think for this style of beer.

I imagine that would drive a consumer of wine into a tizzy. I also figure that I was recently more critical than need be of some very enjoyable ales. This years favorites have been more along the effervescent dark fruity variety. (Would this rate higher if it was categorized as a Stout??) Anyway, the label on this one clearly indicates 7% ABV. Pours an opaque darkness with a full finger foamy dark tan head that resists fading. A nice amount lacing in a spotty pattern. The smell is a wonderful creamy milk chocolate stout. Adequately carbonated, the foamy head lends a wonderful creaminess to the full bodied mouth feel. The marque chocolate flavor does not disappoint...yes AB, ""a well crafted chocolaty stout has it hands down over 'fizzy yellow fluid'. A lightly toasted milk chocolate flavor that finishes a little chalky, like the bottom of a glass of aggressively portioned Nestles. Much less of a lingering quality than a roasty character tends to be. The 7% is well hidden. I hesitate to draw comparisons, but i get the same ""Top Shelf"" stout experience from my local Dragonslayer (at 1/3 the price!).

The aroma has a lot of things you would expect, chocolate, roasted malts, raisins/figs but none of the aromas really stuck out, all seemed to be slightly muted. The flavors where nice, and made this an easy drinking brew. The flavors followed the nose, chocolate seems to be the most recognizable with the addition of a slight tartness.

Esters battle it out with the chocolate in the aroma, with lots of dark fruits, slight high notes and some sweet cacao in the end. I would call this more a Belgian than a chocolate beer. On the palate, the chocolate becomes more pronounced. It blends fairly well with the fruit like yeast tones, never becoming cloying. The finish is very similar to one in a good dark chocolate bar, one like Valrhona where there are lots of fruity characters. The lack of sweetness detracts from the chocolate flavor, I feel, whereas a chocolate stout from Rogue balances nicely with some lactose added.

A lingering metallic aroma that really comes through over the other richer aromas. As in the aroma, the metal flavor is present practically from beginning to end, but the rich, creamy chocolate flavors certainly come through. Fudge, rough espresso beans, and mocha; hints of heavy cream with a thin layer of mustiness from the yeast strain. Full in body; slightly dry and carbonated, but is able to back up the chocolately rich malt flavors. Not one of my favorite offerings from Ommegang, and I'm not sure if there was something wrong with the tap lines providing the metallic flavor/aroma or if it was the offering itself.

4.32,13.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This indulgent creation pours a pitch back color with just the slightest hint of reddish highlights playing in the light. A voluminous head of frothy, cocoa colored whipped cream filles the top of the large goblet I've poured this beer into, threatening to spill over the edge. I quickly whisk the overflow from the rim of the glass with my finger and bring it to my mouth - a small hint of what is to come. Intricate patterns of lacing line the inner rim of the goblet as the head settles back slightly from the edge. A gorgeous pour. The nose made itself apparent immediately after opening the caged and corked 750ml bottle. The aroma of liquid baker's chocolate and a note of Belgian yeast wafted through the air and beckoned me to inhale deeper. In the nose, this beer is definitely a chocolate indulgence i every respect. Along with the heady chocolate aroma, however, I detect hints of dry oak, dark tree fruits and the tell-tale Belgian yeast strain. A complex nose, dominated but not overrun with chocolate goodness. The palate gives me a sensuous dose of slightly bitter baker's chocolate mingled with dark fruit, yeast and a rather strong flowery hop presence. Accompanying this array of flavors is a slightly sour undertone, putting the ""Belgian"" stamp on this unusual stout. Incredibly complex, yet very well balanced. This is nothing like a sweet stout, or milk stout. This Belgian-inspired creation has much more in common with a dry Irish stout, in my estimation, although this isn't a fair or complete comparison either. The Belgian yeast lends a very unique charater to this stout - not to mention the chocolate additions. The mouth feel is one of the best aspects of this beer, for me. Absolutely silky smooth and creamy without being thick or sticky. I love the fact that this stout isn't excessively heavy, allowing the flavors to assert themselves and then leave the mouth cleanly. The alcohol is extremely well hidden as well - only lending a slightly warming feel in the back of the mouth, accentuating the silky nature of this black treat. A very drinkable experience that lands somewhere between a dry stout and a Belgian strong dark ale. A brilliant contrast. If you're a chocolate lover, this is liquid bliss. If you're also a Belgian ale lover, this is probably pretty close to heaven in a bottle. Another truly excellent creation from Brewery Ommegang.","beerphilosopher","Nov 02, 2007"

Cherry and prune. Earthy, slightly acrid mineral finish. Yeast funkiness lingers on the palate and blossoms in the aftertaste. Medium in body, although it feels fairly light, lending to an increased drinkability. Peppery twinge at the finish of a smooth, but light mouthfeel. Has the chocolate and roast aspects of an English stout, but clearly the Belgian house yeast Ommegang uses has taken this one over and made it its own.

I need to try the bottled version as well as enjoy this with a dessert of some sort. Quality creation, fine sipper. Nice to see Omme roll out some quality new offerings","Billolick","Oct 19, 2007"
3.98,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer came in a classy looking 750 ml bomber with a wire cage and a cork. The cork popped up on its own while being unscrewed, and the pour revealed a highly carbonated dark brown stout. The head looked like whipped cream on a hot chocolate. The smell of this beer was sweet and full of chocolate. The real chocolate present in the beer showed up very well in the smell. And unlike most other beers of this type, there was not a hint of roastiness. The taste felt the same way, and reminded me of the occasions when I had paired dark chocolate with a stout, except this time everything was already in the glass. Very well blended taste as the dark malt and chocolate played off each other's strengths. The taste started off like a dark chocolate, and finished with a sweet flair. If was to pick a bone with something, it would be the sort of thin body. Everything else about this beer was indulgent and luscious as promised on the label. Dessert in a bottle with a second helping to spare.","rajendra82","Oct 17, 2007"
4.11,7.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Dark almost black in color, creamy brown head, Smells of cocoa rather than chocolate. The head leaves some nice lacing and there's a lot of sticking to the sides as you drink this beer. You can taste some bitter sweet and semi sweet chocolate along with a large amount of cocoa. This beer is very smooth and has next to no bitterness except a tiny bit at the end. Tiny bit of roasted coffee in the after taste. Overall a great brew I had it out of the bottle and on tap at the brewery on it's release day. I don't know after the first I had another bottle with a friend. At 7%ABV I think this could use a little mellowing from cellering to smooth it out a bit more.","RixBeer","Oct 15, 2007"
4.23,11,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle that came with a nice Ommegang goblet. The color is very near black, the only brown I could see was when I held it straight against a light source and then it was only on the outer most edges. The tan head is thick and leaves some nice lacing. The smell is of semi-sweet chocolate, perhaps a touch of smoke. The taste is of powdery cocoa, bitter chocolate, carob, light roasted coffee and a metallic twang. I pick up a very slight fruitiness every now and again. The feel is silky smooth and well bodies; the metallic aftertaste is a bit undesirable. Great brew, great chocolate flavors mixing well with the roasted malt. Definitely a sipper, hard to finish off the 750 ml.","Gmann","Oct 14, 2007"

3.93,3.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"On-tap at Cole's at $9 a pint. Mike, you are the best at getting stuff like this in. Deep chocolate, I expected to sip but it went down quicker. Lots of lace and full mouthfeel. Bitter finish and more bitter baking chocolate edge aftertaste, rather than sweet or bittersweet. I must have again..for dessert.","Sammy","0"
