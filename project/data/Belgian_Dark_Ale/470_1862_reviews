"Overall- An outstanding beer, I would drink this again and again."
"The look is deep caramel but not cloudy. I love the mouthfeel for this style, it is crisp not overcarbonated and fairly smooth. However I thought it was a tad sweet, I was expecting some sweetness from the caramel malts, but the balance between the bitter and sweet was rough. At first sip sweet hickory was blasted onto the middle of my palate, followed with a bitter chocolate towards the back of the palate. Overall a good brew, not one that I would buy again."

"While on business travel in Luxembourg, the Leffe Brown was a welcome companion.  It's nutty, full flavor, comfortable brown invitation, and smooth full taste made dinners something to remember.  All beer experiences are colored by the when and where we drink them.  This was a perfect storm of circumstance and beer.  Delicious!"

"Overall (3.92) : It is a nice Belgian beer and has a very festive quality to it. I just get this picture of a Belgian speaking housewife making desserts for her husband's friends. Is that weird? I dunno. Try it for yourself."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18B). Bottle 33 cl - Batch 49 11:37. AROMA: low sweet malt aroma with faint notes of caramel. no hop aromas. some spicy alcohol aromas are present. APPEARANCE: dark amber color and translucent. reddish depth. large ivory head with average retention. some lacing is present. TASTE: notes similar to aromas. dilluted sweet malt background flavour. low bitterness. finishes semi-sweet. PALATE: medium-low body with average carbonation. OVERALL: a mild (aroma and flavour wise), belgian dubbel that lacks more malt derived complexity. a bit on the watery side."

"Anyway, if you like ultra sweet beers then go for it, but if you like a brew with balance then this one's not for you. No hop balance here. No bitterness to bring the sweetness down to earth, and that, for me, made it a chore to drink. Not questioning it's quality of ingredients, but the flavor is definitely polarizing."

"So overall would I recommend it ? Totally YES. Very nice beer, that you can drink it during summer and during winter. It's refreshing, it's tasty. And if you find it on special, go for it, you won t be disappointed."

"Overall – Easy to drink, I would highly recommend this beer to anyone it has a rich and complex flavour and leaves a lovely taste in the mouth. This beer is a great example of its type and a fine ambassador for Belgium."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 3/28/2015. Pours fairly crystal clear reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, banana, clove, chocolate, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, plum, fig, banana, clove, chocolate, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, banana, clove, chocolate, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light nuttiness, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice dubbel style. All around great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Would have again if it was on as good of a sale as there was today; were one to be curious about trying this beer, it would be advised to do likewise....  (3.75)"
""
"Overall, one of the better Belgian dark ales I've had."
""
""
""
"Lightly sweet with a Belgian yeasty taste very similar to blonde Leffe but contains a slightly toasted taste.  Worth returning to but not something I would seek out."
"An improvement on the blonde, less sweetness and nice dry finish."

"Was excited to give this two-year-old Leffe a try! It poured a medium dark amber color with little to no head, but that may have been because I was pouring from a day-old growler and this doesn't seem to be a very carbonated beer in the first place. The nose is sweet, almost raisin-y, and has the tiniest hint of nuttiness...the previous reviewer who mentioned root beer was spot-on. The taste of the beer was surprisingly sweet, almost unappealingly so at first, and none of the nuttiness in the nose translated onto the palate. It had a perfectly fine but not exceptional mouthfeel. The finish was fast and slightly sour. I was bummed I wasn't enjoying it more as a sipping beer, and after some pondering decided to pair it with a few mild and sweet-ish cheeses (havarti, mild cheddar, and some of Sargento's New Zealander). That made a huge difference...the sweetness calmed down and more nuttiness and yeastiness popped out, and I even poured a second small glass. I think this is an ok beer, and I might seek it out if I was looking for something to serve with a cheese plate or other sweet/savory appetizers. Probably won't buy again, though."

"O-This is a decent brew with some interesting flavors, but nothing spectacular. The root beer/ginger bread flavors are interesting, but the lack of complexity and the slightly thin mouthfeel hurt the scores."
""
""
""
"O - This is a really good beer. At the price point I would consider it an excellent value, particularly for those interested in breaking into abbey ales. I'll be buying this again and will definitely use it as a lower cost fix for when I've got a hankering for a Belgian Dark of some sort."

"The taste is rich, thick with hops and balanced notes of malt. A slight but pleasant bitterness appears at the end. Refreshing but still kind of a ""heavy"" beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich, smooth, sweet, brown and blonde. Fantastic fluffy head. Not too thick but full bodied so you know that you're drinking and not sipping flavored water. There's a delicious underlying light caramel. It's the dessert and appetizer all wrapped up together."

"Leffe Brown had a caramel/malt smell but not in an appealing way. I found myself shying away from smelling it again. As for the taste it's like a sweet caramel brown ale but it just failed. I couldn't even finish it, and that's really saying something. I got maybe a quarter through it and said it taste too bad for me to want to finish. I'm stuck with five left so maybe the second time around I'll enjoy it more but this beer was awful."

"O: not bad, I wasn't sure what to expect as I do not particularly care for Leffe blonde. Belgian strong darks are among my favorites, so this was not much of a change. I will have this again."

"330 ml bottle. Dark brown to black color with a white long-lasting head. Aromas were of nice burnt caramel, burnt sugar and maybe some chocolate. The taste was more or less the same with the alcohol present! Carbonation was medium, and the body was light to medium. A little disappointing for a dubbel, didn’t got the characteristics of the style, but a good beer nonetheless!!"

"Once again with Leffe. I have never tried this brown so I was hoping it was better than the blond. NOPE. Poured at 40 degrees, beer was very pretty I must admit with a giant head. Mahogany color mmmI thought. But as soon as I smelled it I knew it was that same sour beer we hate. Don't understand it either My wife spent a year in Holland and loved this beer on tap. When she got back here to Va. we started buying it and first sip she took was yuk! And we have tried several times hoping it was just a bad or old beer. I don't know maybe the export product is not the same as the beer overseas. Don't matter I will never again waste money to try it anymore unless we find it on tap."

"A very pleasant surprise given that this falls under the InBev umbrella and is brewed at a commercial brewery. At the excellent price of under $8 a sixer, this is as close to a solid ""everyday"" Belgian ale as there is."

"Spicy nose and tangy aftertaste. This seems to be a staple of French bistro kind of places. I'll have to taste this again. This is better than I remember from the bottled version."

"Sampled from a 33cl bottle. Brown with some light coming through and a small head of large bubbles. Aroma has black pepper, nuts, bread and a hint of prunes. Flavor is smooth with a varied blend of raisins, prunes, biscuits, black pepper and plums. Body is a bit thin with a moderately high carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer but not especially flavorful or adventurous. But I enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
"A flavorful brown ale that comes across a little heavy yet packed with lots of great malt flavors. Hop bitterness and aroma are hard to detect, but rich malt flavors abound."
""
""
"o; A good Abbey ale. I would not buy it again, however, due to the slightly unpleasant odor."
"Highly carbonated beer with a brown colored head and a deep brown color. It does appear pretty clear in the light. The nose is a bit faint but is still fairly enticing with some Belgian yeast and candy sugar. The mouthfeel is a bit oily,but creamy. The taste seems a bit fleeting and underwhelming for a Belgian beer. Just some peppery Belgian yeast that grows in intensity in the aftertaste. There's a bit of growing warmth with in the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a good Belgian Dark - not massively overcomplicated, but heavy in sweet malt and treacle flavours. Pretty decent for AU$70 a case (2013) - figured it would be a fair bit more than that. Definitely more of a sipping beer than a sessional."
""
""
""
""
"O: It pleased me a lot, good surprise."
""
""
""

"A tasty Belgian brown. Sweet with malts slighlty overstepping the yeast solid yeast. Good carbonation. Glad to have found this while in Turks and Caicos."

"Overall a nice beer, pretty much a bruin dark to a ""T", but doesn't go beyond to do anything special either"

"(3.5) D: It has been quite a while since I had this, and I was quite surprised by the taste. I much prefer the Leffe brune over the blonde. Will have to start considering this at establishments with macro-heavy lineups."

"generally speaking, i only grab a leffe if i'm strapped for cash and am trying to stretch bucks and still have something resembling the experience of drinking a nice belgian. it's a bizarre and probably mostly unsuccessful compromise (as most compromises are) because i wish the whole time that i was sipping corsendonk instead of slugging leffe, unless i can take a step back and temper the averageness of the brew with the beauty of being a being in time at all, and in my own humanness, rejoice. so, then, as a stepping stone to realizing a higher plane of consciousness, i am a bit indebted to this beer, though my getting there is traceable quite readily to it's just-a-hair-above-mediocre character. it does look nice in a glass, though its head was thin and weak and it smelled a bit like dried montmorency cherries."
""
""

"Overall: 	I love Belgian brown ales, and while not being the best Belgian brown ale out there, Leffe brune is my absolutely favorite Belgian brown ale. Hell, it’s probably my favorite beer period. I can (and have) drink this all night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I enjoy the funkiness of a Belgian beer, but I like this one even though the hops predominate more than in other Belgians. It drinks easily and has a refreshing feeling overall that I enjoyed. I'll look for this again."
""
""
""
""
"It’s a nice beer, but there are better out there. Pretty good for a cheap stand in though."
""
""
"I found this more interesting than the Blond version. Solid and quality beer from a massive producer at competitive prices. Definitely worth it, leave prejudice apart. As other Belgian examples, I would prefer them to be less sweet, I believe it is easier to hide flaws behind that."

"of thinness in the mouthfeel."
""
""

"Very dark brown, just a shade lighter than black in the glass with a huge light khaki colored head that takes a while to subside. The smell is of wheat bread, dark caramel and belgian yeast in the form of banana and clove. The taste is similar to the smell with the yeast character in the forefront and the rest of the flavors bouncing around behind. The finish is dry but smooth as the carbonation level is low which makes this beer feel nice and thick in the mouth. Overall hop character is limited in terms of hop aroma, flavor and bitterness. Overall I'm a fan of brown ales and this is version of the belgian dark style is reminiscent of an english brown with more yeast character. Not quite as tasty as others of the style but still a good classic example."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A simple and sweet beer, with less “brown” or Belgian than I’d hoped."
""
"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a nice dark brown with a very large fluffy light brown head. Smells of yeast and roasted barley, very nice combination and not that unexpected for a Belgian beer. Tastes of caramel and very slight sweet chocolate, a very nice combination. Beer is carbonated right and for its light/medium body and goes down great. Overall, a very good beer."
"Like another reviewer, Leffe has become my ""go to"" beer and the Brune is my beer of choice. There's nothing about this beer that I don't like, other than seeing an empty six pack. The Brune seems to be a bit harder to find but is definitely worth the chase!"
"Overall: I really like Leffe Blond Ale, and it's one of my regular ""go to"" beers. Now that this Leffe Brune is easily available in America in six packs, I will be drinking a lot more of this. I love a Belgian Dark ale that is well made...this one is excellent, and a good price for a six pack."
""
""
""
"It's a great tasting beer and highly drinkable."
"O: I enjoyed this beer it looked great that was probably best thing about the beer, not that it was bad it tasted good and was very drinkable it may not be the best belgian beer but it is easy to find and easy to enjoy."
""
""
""
""

"Overall - A nice alternative to the Leffe Blond Ale. I usually graba six of both when I buy Leffe. One of each per session is perfect."

""
""
""

""
""
""
"O- Very tasty, and I'd certainly enjoy it again!"

"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is bursting with spices, and fruits. Taste is delicious. Lots of spice, malts, yeast, fruitiness, complex and flavorful, the glass is becoming empty quickly. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a beer worth seeking out."
""
""
"C+"
"Enormous head. Brown amber with bronze highlights. Aroma is yeasty spiciness first with pepper and cloves. Soft malt background. Very smooth and relatively flat, especially considering the size of the head. Finish is dry, but not too much and still holds a touch of malty sweetness and soft bitterness with a touch of hop flavor. Nicely done beer and fresh enough that each distinctive ingredient places an apparent role with the yeast, hops and malts all showing forth in quite complementary ways. A little dangerous in how easily is drinks."
""
"Pretty good overall..not really a go-to Belgian"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours a ruby/brown color with a three finger light tan head that settles to a rocky one finger foam and lots of long lasting sticky lace. a light aroma of sweetness spice and alcohol meets the nose. nice balance of taste between caramel, rock candy, dried plums, spice, and then you start to taste the warming affects of the alcohol also could pick up a hint of chocolate. mouthfeel is smooth with a light carbonation that holds well and didn't go flat. overall it was very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Gotta drink something whilst my mind is happily torn asunder by the first season of Adventure Time, right? This stuff pours a dark ruby-brown topped by two fingers of off-cream foam. The nose comprises graham cracker, Belgian yeast, light rye bread, and clove. The taste holds notes of mild cocoa, clove, light brown sugar, banana peel, light Belgian yeast, and light toasted biscuit. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slightly grainy feel. Overall, a solid, if somewhat underwhelming, Belgian dark. It won't blow you outta the water, but it'll do for a quick Belgian-y nip."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown/burgundy with a few fingers of mocha head. Fairly dense lacing and substantial retention. Nose of dark fruits, mostly grapes, some candi sugar and darker malts, slightly bready. Taste is almost solely grape juice, a bit nutty and some sweeter dark malts. A bit of yeast as well. Mouthfeel is medium light, slightly watery.and carbonation is quite low - slightly drying finish. Nothing wrong with this beer, but it's not too exciting either."

"O- good abbey ale, drinkable and easy to find ."

"Tasted on: 09/14/12"

"Overall - Pretty good Belgian brown, though a bit too sweet, IMO, to be considered elite. Still, I'm enjoying it well enough, and I wouldn't be unopposed to buying it again if it were on sale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I can see a lot of people really liking this beer. If you like very sweet, malty caramel, then it is for you. For me, the sweetness is a little too overpowering. I probably won't drink it again, but will recommend to friends ."
""
""
""
"The taste is the same,but with lingering bread taste. No real hop presence. Medium mouth-feel, medium carbonation. Good tasting...nothing extreme, just easy drinking."
"O: This beer is a go to Abbey beer. This Brown is great with rich red meats and can handle spicy foods."
"Picked up a bottle on my brother's recommendation. Poured a deep chestnut color with a very tall rocky head. Fruity aroma with some yeast and vanilla cookie. Taste unmistakably chocolate and lightly cherry. Small bit or a roasty finish. Smooth texture. Very lightly carbonated. A nice beer. Very smooth and mellow compared to most American brown ales."
""
"A good Belgian ale. Would go well with a meal or dessert, but drinking by itself may get a bit overwhelming from the large amount of sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours very dark brown with full inch and white puffy foam. Laces and sticks. Dark roasted brown. Nutty. Some yeast. Caramel taste that evolves into a chewy tasty bitter. Rich taste, flavorful. Full mouthfeel. Pretty good brown."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a handsome fig color with a decent amount of khaki foam. The aroma is citric and slightly boozey, with perhaps a hint of Belgian spices. The flavor is pretty mild for a Belgian ale, but pleasant, with a gentle malt backbone that is equal parts roast and caramel. Some hop bitterness is present, but only enough to lend balance. As with the nose, whatever spices are present are modest. The bitterness lingers just a bit in the finish, but not excessively so. A fairly ample, but thin, layer of lacing envelopes the glass as the beer recedes, lending a handsome appearance. The malt character begins to assert itself more as the beer warms, and this is hardly a bad thing, as I felt the mouthfeel was just a tad thin initially. Overall, this is a very balanced and well-rounded Belgian dark ale from Leffe (I'd go so far as to say I prefer it to their blonde, which I also enjoy)."

"Perhaps the best way to sum it up is to say it seemed like a Belgian beer reproduced for the masses. I don't mean that as a slam, as I enjoyed it and will certainly buy it again. In fact, I think it serves as a better ""all nighter"" than the higher abv Belgian classics (my beloved Maredsous Tripel for example...) that I enjoy so much. It is worth a try as long as you don't go in expecting Chimay."

"O: Very enjoyable. Would drink again. The Leffe brewery does ale right."

"To bring a Belgian beer to Idaho for under $1.50 for a 11.2oz bottle I shouldn't have been expecting a complex beer, and it is not one- but is adequate."

"Overall another easy to drink belgium that I would drink again. Would love to try this on tap. I'd imagine anyone who likes beer could drink this."

"Cheers"
"Overall / Drinkability: A nice tasty Belgian beer. Not very wide or complex in flavor profile, but rather deep an pronounced with the strong malt flavors it brings. Definitely malt forward. Very drinkable - finished this off fast and definitely want another."

"Delish. Malty goodness, dry finish. Very dangerous. Could drink many of these. Pretty brown haze with a fluffy off-white head and perma-lacing. Aroma is its weak poi t, with only the subtlest Belgian yeast and banana whatchamacallit. Flavor isn't very complex,but just so drinkable."
"Pretty good beer overall; I would recommend to my friends who like a sweeter brown ale or who are picky about what's on the outside. (appearance) They would LOVE it."
""
"Pours a solid opaque dark brown, almost black color. Sweet looking head with an inch or two on the top. Scents of brown sugar, plums, apricots, and maybe a bit of chocolate on the nose. Taste is of chocolatey malty plums with a dash of backend bitterness rounding out the beer. Very fruity, very drinkable. Nice head retention and good lacing. Chewy cherry flavors come through on the sip, as well. Pretty nice offering and easy to drink."
"Tasty and highly drinkable. Quite sweet, but a pleasantly complex flavour. The only thing missing is the depth that bottle-conditioning would provide. A decent brown beer that goes down nicely; well worth sampling."
""
"Overall: A stellar brown ale and quite coincidentally precisely what I’ve been craving for a very long time. I’ve been drinking mostly huge American beers lately and I’ve forgotten how sublimely awesome many of the less ostentatious Belgian brews can be. This beer definitely reminded me and left me wanting more."

"(D)- A great beer for sure. Creamy, but fits the style and without being too sweet or bitter."

"O-a great and easy drinking dark belgian. i could have a lot of this."
"11.2oz. bottle served in my Ommegang tulip. Pours a brownish-mahogany hue with a dense, three-inch, tan-colored head that eventually settles into a frothy mass - textured clumps of lacing are exposed during the tasting. Nose is somewhat subdued - nutmeg/allspice, medium-toasted malts and a suggestion of yeast. Taste follows nose; however, malty quality is a bit more assertive in the flavor profile. There is also just the merest hint of toffee. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an assertive carbonation. Overall, a pretty good beer. Spiciness is definitely reminiscent of the Blonde; however, the malt profile definitely makes it distinctive in its own right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I tried the Leffe Brune in a Sam Adams tasting glass. The shade of brown is toward the darker of the style. A fine, creamy light tan head fully lasted ten minutes though there was some through to the end. This sent is nutty and like caramel. ( The unique nuttiness is reminiscent of the Leffe Blonde Ale.) To my pallet there is a slight sour aftertaste I could do without. The beer would be better with a steak."

""
""

"Beer is sweet and bready. Nice finish light in body. Mildly nuttiness / roast. I'd have it again. "

"O: This beer is very enjoyable, very easy to drink, and could be a good session beer. It drank really smoothly and it is definitely one that I would enjoy having again. This beer is well balanced."

"EDIT: Much better acquainted with it now. Deserves a better rating. Tasting a lot more chocolate and something plummy which I can't put my finger on. Probably plums."

""
"Overall, a likable brew, but a touch too sugary. Really hard to make you want more than one. Great nose, structure, but a bit off in the taste. Worth trying, but just ok."
"O - A solid and affordable Belgian dark ale. Even if it is an inbev, this one is still worth stocking in your beer fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very drinkable brew. Not a ton of character outside of the ester profile from the yeast, and a bit on the sweet side."

"Very drinkable if a bit overly sweet."

"jd"
"To mention my two favourites: Rochefort 6 and La Trappe dubbel, the latter is even superior to its (bigger) brother La trappe Tripel, in my opinion of course."
"Carbonation is too high."
""
"Beer really fits its billing. Something I would apreciate most during the winter because of its feel. The sugar in Belgian beers is always so unique and this is no exception. Not a huge body and the alcohol doesn't scare. This beer is a great gateway into curiosity and interest in Belgian beers."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
"Overall this beer is very good and a great alternative to the basic brown ale. I wouldnt classify this as a belgian dark as as this doesnt have much of a fruity characteristic and really doesnt fit with the masses. Great beer though!"
""
""
"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a goblet. This pours a dark brown with a small tan head which quickly dissipates, best before 10/2/13. The smell is of tobacco, yeast esters, dark fruit, bread malts. The feel is medium, high carbonation. The taste is okay, banana, spice, a nice dry finish, dark fruit."
"o - Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer. I thought it had a really nice nose full of Belgian yeast and bananas, though the taste wasn't quite as great. A very good beer I'd have again."

"This is an easy drinking Belgian. It has decent carbonation to keep it moving and its slightly drying on the end. Good stuff."

"This is one of my favorite styles of Belgian beers, and Leffe or whoever's in charge of this, has finally decided to let this version into the U.S. At last. And it is good. Great to know. I look forward to tapping it at a Belgian-leaning bar near me."
"O- A decent offering from the Abbey. Just not the one of the most greatest offerings from a Belgian Abbey."
"Drinkability/overall- like the regular leffe i find this to be a nice value belgian brew, it may not be the most complex but in terms value its excellent, always wanted to try this one not sure overall if i i like it better then the blonde but also not all that drastically different, definitely worth an occasional visit"
"Overall, pretty good; it's not something I would seek out, though I certainly wouldn't turn it down."
""
"Please note: The rating is souly based on ""Belgium Brunes"". This beer is still way above average, just not to my personal likings."

"The body is medium with soft carbonation. Overall not bad here. Pretty enjoyable but I guess I'd just prefer a quad over this."

"11.2oz bottle served in a chalice. Poured a deep reddish brown with a finger of off white head. Not a lot going on in the aroma, some dark fruit and a little malt sweetness. Lighter side of medium bodied. Belgian yeast spice comes out in the flavor. Also some caramelized sugar. Nothing really stands out, but it is very drinkable."
""
"The flavor is decent. A bit too dry and grainy. Lasting bitterness in the finish. Dries out the palate quickly. Overall, this is OK. Not in the upper class of quaffable Belgian brews."

"Had it in Lebanon for the first time. Very attractive labeling, with a great dark chocolatey colour. When poured into a glass, there were notes of chocolate, roasty toastiness, and raisins in the aroma. Tasted scrumptious: flavours of nuts, coffee, and more chocolata. This is a really good porter brew."
""
"O - This is really nice Belgian dark ale. I'm glad this arrived in town."
"O- not a bad drop, i was expecting a bit more from it though."
""
""
""
"Pretty, and interesting for variety, but neither the best Leffe nor BDA."
"O - A tasty Belgian dark ale, nicely balance with the fruity yeast and cloves nicely balanced with a solid caramel and toffee malt finish."
""
"Overall- solid beer, one of the more drinkable Belgiuns I have had."
"Great drinkability. Pleasantly surprised with this offering. Highly recommended if you want a Belgian beer that you are going to have a few of."
"Leaves a light bitter taste, pleasantly bitter. Thin bodied in palate and lightly carbonated. Overall a great beer, I really ejoyed it."
"Pours a clear dark iced tea color with a 3 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a craggy cap. Thick chunks of lace cling to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of caramel malt, banana, spices, and Belgian yeast. Taste is of dark malt, caramel/toffee, banana, spices, and the yeast. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good Belgian dark ale that I enjoyed slightly more than the Leffe Blonde."
"Overall this is good."
""
"Feels like a dryer beer, some dust, some carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Surprisingly light body. Low to moderate carbonation. Very good overall. A bit simple but well crafted. I think a bit more impressive overall than the Blonde. Good quality overall for a mass market Belgian."
""
"The Leffe Brune is a flavorful and smooth but not super impressive. I've had a Blonde several times and to the best of my recollection, the Blonde was a bit more impressive in quality. I have no trouble finishing this Leffe Brune tonight, but I don't see myself reaching for another either."
"O: Pretty good. The Belgian yeast blends nicely with the rich malt flavors. Much easier to drink than I had imagined."
""
""
""
""
"O: Kind of a weird one. Wouldn't jump to another one. The blonde is far superior."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is a top notch Belgian dark ale. I'd truly say that this is a complex and harmonious beer, with such a unique flavor profile, that i'd rate it in the top 25% of all Belgians around. Knowing that the brewery is owned by InBev makes me sad, but i rated this with no bias, only dictated by the profile of the beer. A good solid beer."
""
"O: Pretty nice beer despite the fact of being produced in mass quantities. Would make a decent introduction to Belgians for the uninitiated, and still has some charms for those with more experience. I would drink this again."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber with an off white head. Aromas of Belgian yeast, candy sugar and alittle fruityness. In the taste, a nice Belgian amber, with candy sugar, toffee and light toasted malts. Not overly sweet but has little discernable hop notes. Shortbread, muted fruit, and a full malty body compliment each other well here. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall, my favorite of the Leffe line, really tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Rest: Medium bodied and highly drinkable. A real treat."
"Strong in taste and effect, good but rather heavy going."
""
"O - Pretty good dark Belgian ale for 9.99/six pack. Definitely not in the same tier as some of the more expensive Belgian ales, but for a guy like me who enjoys Belgian beer in moderation it does just fine. Many Belgian beer fans view Leffe as mediocre, but this is still a delicious treat and reasonably priced."
""
""
"From, the 11.2 fl. oz. bottle marked 18/05/13-4902:45. Sampled on December 29, 2011. The thing about Leffe is that is it widely available but it still maintains a certain high quality. Here, we get a handsome looking dark amber pour with an abundant fluffy head that slowly settles down but never goes away. The aroma has a nice yeast, banana, and sweet Belgian malt character. The body falls into the medium range with a good amount of durability on my tongue. The taste has that immitable Belgian dark flavor with sweetness balanced with a cool, clean ending. m A nice beer when you are in the mood for a Belgian ale."
"Overall: I am a big fan of the beer especially for how readily available it is. Good beer"
"There's some good flavour to be had here, though I wonder if those flavours might show a bit more depth and richness if this beer hadn't been filtered. It might have lent the mouthfeel a bit more richness as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good double, I think it will be nice to age this one a little."
"not even close to the red or the blonde, this is leffe's worst. pours a decent enough looking chocolate brown color with a thin creamy head. smell is belgian yeast, milk chocolate, and candy sugar. sweet and intoxicating. taste is less exciting than the nose, kind of just a drab belgian brown ale, nothing outstanding or out of the ordinary. mouthfeel is smooth, but its what killed this beer for me. it was almost flat and became more wine like in the mouth because of it. exactly the wrong feel for this style of beer. drinkable enough i guess, but not worth it for the price when the red and the blonde cost the same"
""
"Pours a dark brown with a one finger coffee head. Very dark, and impossible to see through. Good lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is interesting.. Smoke, peat, mint, spice, and some bitterness. Not what I was expecting at all. More malt and yeast needed. Taste follows the nose profile exactly. A little thin on complexity and flavor. Feel is medium, with good carbonation, and fairly dry finish. Overall, this brew lacks the complexity and meat of the best in style. I won't look for this again. Cheers."

"Leffe Brune was a pleasant surprise. It has a nice medley of flavors that kept me going back to my glass. I'm really glad I picked it up."
""
""
""
"nicely filling, felt very satisfied after one, and given its wide availability in europe and low price, one i will come back to."
"Overall: this is a slightly above-average beer which hits some high points but the flavor is just not my favorite composition. Certainly drinkable, I probably won't go out of my way for this one again."
"Overall: Not great, no, but no too bad, either, really. More enjoyable for me than the blonde variety, I'll say."
"D - Very solid beer overall. It's well built, balanced, and priced. I'd certainly have it again."
"A very good dark ale, although not flavorful enough that I would hastily pick one up again. I would bet that this is a far superior beer on tap, as the extra sweet kick makes it a tasty and quite comforting drink."
"This is one of my favorite beers that I have found in my European travels. It is very hard to find in the US however, I just got some here in the US and it was again fantastic. Bottle has an expiration of 2013 on it so it is very fresh. I love the dark color, and the smell of this beer. It is an excellent representation of the best of the Abbey style beers and one that I always enjoy drinking."
"The taste took off from where the olfactory senses had landed. Rich, caramelite malts with expansive amounts of dark fruits, raisins and plums for a wee bit of tartness. The taste was well balanced - not at all overtly sweet, but a well rounded, spicy sweet package. Mouthfeel was slick, with medium carbonation. Enough to give the beer life to sweetly hit every nook and corner of your palate. A nice sipper / dessert beer. I wouldn't really have plenty of these at one go, but I would definitely like to stock up on these to savour every once in a while."
"This is truly like dessert coffee cake beer right here."
"This was a fantastic relief from the terrible beers I had been drinking on my Bulgaria trip. Very yummy beer, and very affordable, at least at Bulgarian prices."
"Glad I picked this one out of the singles bin - it was a perfect change-up from the pale ales and euro lagers I've been having recently - but much less glad that I neglected to get a 6-pack because this is tasty stuff. An excellent ale, not that I expect anything less from Belgian stock."
"O - a very nice dark ale and one I will definitely go back to again soon"
"i totally loved this beer i can say its one of the best i have tried ...."
"overall: I didn't have a less than great beer on my trip to Belgium, this however, stood out as it is a favorite type of beer of mine"
"D: Despite a good flavour profile, the overall sweetness of this ale is personally off-putting; a stronger roasted character would be a real improvement, in my opinion. If you like the sweet side of Belgian ales, though, it should be worth a try."
"This beer has perhaps a little too sweet of a mouthfeel for some, but none the less it is a very refreshing brown ale with a distinct Belgian flavour."
"Overall, solid."
"DRINK (3.5/5) The lighter body should make this one more drinkable, and it does, but this slight disconnect kinda bothers me."
"O. A real good brew lots of flavor, good balance, although slightly sweeter than bitter."
"O: not a very good beer, too thin too sweet, below average"
"Don't have a lot of details, but suffice to say I was impressed to the last drop."
"Overall- This is not my first time drinking a Leffe and quite possibly not my last although it’s definitely not the best dark ale I have ever tried, personally I enjoy the American ales a bit more than the Belgians. All in all a good offering from a world class, mass produced brewery, that is probably one of if not their best beer offering."
"Overall: It's a very very good belgian beer. I love the fact its ABV is only 6.5%, I could drink this every other day! The experience of drinking it is comparable to drinking stronger belgian beers. Will definitely revisit it!"
"This was a decent beer, the flavor was good but I thought it was a little light for the style. I would drink this again but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"Very drinkable,served on 12-14 C,very good beer from very good beer company."
"that being said"
"Future outlook: Probably wouldn't go out of my way to acquire this again, but it's a pretty good beer that I am happy to have gotten the opportunity to try."
"O- I'm glad I was able to try this, but I probably won't go to the trouble of obtaining it again. It's a well-crafted beer, but not in the top tier of belgian brews."
"O: This is a solid Belgian Dark Ale, though it may be lacking in complexity. I think I prefer the lighter ""blonde"" version, but this one won't disappoint. A bit sweet for me, I suppose. Cheers!"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how robust it came across. To start the aroma was nice and full, giving some complexity through its integration of all of the notes. The taste followed nicely, with the flavors coming through as promised by the nose. This starkness, however, also forces the drinker to slow down, as it can become overbearing if drunk too quickly."
"This is a tasty brown brew with a low ABV that makes it sessionable."
"D: No alcohol detected and the flavors are simple and to the point. Not a bad choice for a sesh."
"D - A very nice beer. It's easy enough that you could enjoy it in a social setting and not miss the boat, and flavorful enough to keep your attention."
"Concealing its relatively high alcohol very well by constituting roast and fruity characters, it's quite good drinkable and enjoyable brew."
"More of a dessert treat than a session beer."
"* Drinkability - All round a good beer that went down better when gulped, as it prolonged the initial flavours."
"Very drinkable it cuts the sweetness of Queen ann cherry's quite nicely!"
"This is a very drinkable beer. Though something to be enjoyed on special occasions rather than an everyday choice."
"Pours a deep chocolate brown with 2cm of head that fades away fairly slowly. Smells of yeast, banana and raisins. Tastes sweet and mildly chocolatey with a lot of dark malt, also with some yeastiness. Mouthfeel is very heavy and creamy without any fizziness, just slightly carbonated. Overall it's a very drinkable beer, I'll be looking for it again for winter nights."
"Drinkability: very drinkable , no alcohol detected"
"330ml bottle, poured into leffe goblet. 2 finger head but I poured it too quickly. Looks a bit like Guinness, but it's a few shades clearer. Smells like Leffe Blonde but tastes sweeter and maltier. A winter beer, smooth but quite heavy could not have more than 1"
"D - Tasty and easy to drink. Enjoyed on occasion."
"My favourite beer. Dark and richly flavored Bock. A bit heavy, but less than most dark beers. Goes great with heavy food such as stake or Lasagne. Taste is where it really gets you, no real better word, but than this is closest - It's nutty. and nutty is a great and rich way. Also it goes down like a Guiness - Smooth and easy so your mouth won't sting and it would just wash your mouth so you can go back to your stake."
"Drinkabulity is, i can get many beeter beer for the same price (including leffe blonde)"
"D - This is a good intro to Belgian styles and very accessible. Not the most interesting Belgian dark but it's abv is reasonable and it's full of flavour compared to alot of other mainstream brews. This could be a gateway beer but it lacks the flavour of many of the other high quality Belgian brews. Still, it's by no means a terrible beer and I would have no problem drinking a few."
"Drinkability: Another OK offering from Leffe. Nothing really great about any of their beers. Nothing really wrong either."
"Pours a reddish brown from a .33L bottle into my ""chalice."" Gave me several inches of fluffy light brown head which went down quickly gracing my chalice with some lacing. A nice aroma, fruity, yeasty, maybe hints of berries. For a mass marketed InBev beer, I am impressed. Taste is once again accented by the aroma, the yeast, some malts and some berries come through. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied. Some gentle warming from the alcohol. Drinkability is fine. Picked up one at the Supermercado in Puerto to test it out - there is no advantage to bulk buying in Spain unless they are giving free gifts like chalices. Will definitely pick one up again if given the chance. Cheers."
"Mouthfeel is great, with small smooth bubbles and a pleasantly viscous body."
"Poured into a Leffe chalice, with the bottle gushing. A nice initial head that disappears and neither laces nor caps... The aroma is distinctly Leffe / Belgian. Smells like their Blonde, with an almost citrusy musk. The taste is a little disappointing in the sense that I was expected a bit of roasted flavours to come through over the belgian yeast esters that are dominating. Some citrus and a bit of spice plays on the palate, but this is essentially Leffe Blonde with some dehusked Carafa III thrown in it for colour. Tasty, though not a brown ale to me..."
"I can't really call this a great beer, but it's very drinkable, and not a bad fallback if there's nothing more exciting on offer. It's definitely a beer that makes you glad to be a beer drinker... :)"
"Overall this is a pretty tasty Belgian. Not too bitter, I could see having a few of these. Distinct olde looking labels, neat tiny bottle shape."
"Updated: Glass at the Pogue Mahone. Flavour seems diluted somewhat, but with the sweetness emphasized. Artificial, plastic aftertaste lingers in the mouth. I'll pass on this next time. Scores adjusted to reflect crap tap and decent bottle."
"Overall: Good beer, widely available around this parts, almost any supermarket carry this beer (Barcelona, Spain) and kind of cheap."
"Overall, this dark beauty exceeded my expectations. I will be looking for more of this refreshing dark beer."
"D: I would drink this over many other browns."
"Drink - If you are a fan of abbey style beers, this is one is probably a hit. I would prefer to be drinking something else."
"good!!"
"Very smooth and deceptively drinkable for its ABV."
"This isn't the first time I've drunk this but I had forgotten what a nice beer it is. Yum."
"I tried this beer on June 28, 2008 after purchasing from the Queen's Quay LCBO outlet in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer pours a slightly translucent dark brown with a long lasting tan coloured head. The aroma was sweet malt and some spices. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour is primarily malty, with a hoppy bitter finish, and in between, some peppery spiciness."
"Poured from the tap into the Leffe glass. This is somehow more aromatic from the tap, with a bit more brown sugar character than the bottled version. Very drinkable and satisfying. A good option for Belgian taste in a small town where better beer is harder to come by."
"Dark and murky with some ruby highlights. Muted, doughy bread and a little hint of cocoa on the nose but it feels a touch flat (as in lifeless, not carbonation). Flavours on the palate are restrained but pleasant. Some more doughiness and a some spicy clove and cinnamon. Overall, its quite decent but doesn't excite. Worth having but not necessarily going out of your way for."
"D - Not the best Bruin but one of the few that you could session."
"drinkability - my only regret is that I only purchased one bottle of this, I would gladly revisit. at 6.5%, this is a nice beverage"
"I would say this beer is a good introduction for those who never had belgian brown ales, but probably would not satisfy the connoisseur. considering price and availability, it is a good pick in where I live. possibly very good to drink with roasted pork or ribs, perhaps can even be used as marinade."
"Still that alcohol affects the nose with sweet roasted malt. On the palate, this malt is up, a little sweet and followed by an attack weaklings artificial flavors and especially fat. Not really tastes amazing, just a beer pretty soft on the palate, with few spices and a little power, just a little spice in the finish."
"Wasn't sure what this would be like but very happy with the result. It's a dark beer that's light on the palate so is eminently drinkable. Good dark to start with if you're new to the style."
"O: Great drinkability. Good quality even after being purchased by AMBEV."
"D: Very good. First I have tried of this style and I would be willing to pick up some more during my next beer run."
"D-Still really like this beer, and this style."
"I seemed to enjoy this one much more the second time around. Fruity and sweet but still very palatable. I still favour BSDA's and BSPA's, but this seems like a great intro into the world of Belgian's."
"D: A nice beer. I'll buy it again. A nice Belgian Dark Ale, not very complex - it could work as an introduciton-beer to Beligian Dark Ale."
"D: This beer surprised me, as I was less than impressed by the Blonde. Easy drinking and nothing hateful, just not my favorite."
"The beer that first introduced me to Belgian ales (as well as drinking beer out of a chalic) has always been a winner for me. A great sipper, perfect for a quiet evening session."
"Drinkability I liked this slightly better than the Blonde but both were very enjoyable and great to start a venture into Belgium"
"This is a hard to judge beer, it looks and smells very nice, but the taste is a bit to sweet for me."
"Medium-bodied and quite impressed with how smooth it was. The extra bit of alcohol was very well hidden. Seems like it would make a great beer for cooking with as well."
"This beer is great! I think it is better than Leffe blonde! Great color, great head! I actually used this beer for a marinade for my ribs! Drink some as well! Would recommend this one to a friend, and I would buy this beer again, without a doubt.! The Leffe glass is also amazing!"
"Notes: Fairly cloying. Kind of like a spicy/warming liquid candy. This was better than what I expected it to be, and not a bad beer but not a great one."
"This very much reminds me of Unibroue products, but they have obviously been doing it for a might stretch longer..."
"D: I don't find anything overly special about this beer. There is nothing drawing me in to drink it again."
"Recommended to try for sure. It's a good beer across the board. Like it."
"On tap. Nice brown pour with a persistent white head. Aromas of yeast, plums and candy sugar and light alcohol. Good fruity sweet taste with some strong yeast and alcohol notes. Good mouthfeel, not too watery and correct carbonation. Definitly better on tap."
"went great with the fresh deep fried soft pretzel and the spicy littlenecks"
"Notes: Sits way behind in the type of beers that I am interested on. But years ago this was one of the beers that expanded my curiosity making me walk away from the dominance and boredom of average macros. Remains fairly tasty and decent if somewhat forgettable, but worth some respect."
"Bottle sample- Pours a dark brown body with a caramel coloured head that lasts. Aroma is sweet, fruity and of slight alcohol. Taste is sweet and sugary, and quickly turns to a bitterness that feels nice in the throat. Hops are way more apparent in the finish."
"Very good drinkability on this one -- for a medium-bodied, moderate ABV beer, this packs a lot of flavor. I had stopped by many times before trying this one -- sadly for this jaded beer geek, the site of Leffe fails to excite me any more -- but I was very pleased & reminded why I like Leffe so much in the first place."
"Medium bodied, the carbonation gives an initial bit at first that dies down and reveals the flavors slowly."
"Overall: Don't compare this to an abbey/trappist dubbel, it lacks the ""depth", it is much more watery and less balanced than these beers. Mainly sweet, but still I somehow like it. It is almost a session beer. One of the better beers from Leffe."
"Biggest minus: Who knows when I'll be able to refill; the keg died during the next person's fill up..."
"Still, it's well worth a try in a bar, to get an impression of dark ale, very suitable in the cold months."
"If you liked Leffe Blond, or even if you thought it was only ""ok," I would recommend giving Bruin a try. The flavors are more muted and smooth, and it's just a lot more enjoyable of an ale. No wincing or biting/awkward flavors. Even from the bottle, I enjoyed this Belgian Dark Ale. I will caveat that with the fact that the bottle was consumed in Germany. I'm convinced the beer gods taint most European beer on the trans-Atlantic journey to the States."
"This is great quaff."
"overall i was very impressed by this beer, it is good solid beer, you may want to try the leffe blonde first as it gives you a good introduction to belguim ales, the first belguim real ale i had was a leffe blonde and it opened my eyes to a completely different style of beer now belguims are one of my favorites."
"D- Moderate, but great. I Wouldn't want more than 1 or 2, but I'll enjoy that tulip all the way down. On tap, this stuff is f'in awesome."
"drinkability is decent. a bit too sweet without the flavors to back it up. the brew ends up a bit flabby in the end; it could be a bit more flavorful with a better finish. not bad for a belgian dark, but not too good either."
"D - Really good dark ale, one of my favourites."
"I found this on tap at Waterzooi in Garden City, NY last night. Its swirling foamy brown and tan outside was interesting to see as it was paired with the right glass by a cute bartender. Raising the glass, one could tell it was going to be good as its fragrant aroma delivered multiple nuances. The first taste was a complete character of dark malts and each subsequent taste built upon that impression...until it was gone too quickly. This was very easy to drink and my only hesitation to drinking all night was that Waterzooi has a great beer menu with other beers to visit too."
"Not bad but a little disjointed and hardly a world-beater in its class. The mix of bitternesses in the finish I think is what puts me off as well as the light body and carb."
"Wasn't expecting this nice from Leffe. Not complex for the style, but very quaffable."
"Overall a tasty and user friendly belgian dark."
"D - I can drink this very quickly despite all the alcohol almost too easy to drink"
"First had Leffe Brune during my trip to Belgium last year. While regular Leffe is pretty easy to come by these days, I have trouble finding Brune anywhere in the Hudson Valley region of NY. While this tastes very similar to it's lighter sibling, I really prefer the additional complexity and malt in the brune. It gives the beer greater body and makes it much more enjoyable. I brought a six pack of this home from Quebec with me. It seems to be much more readily available north of the border and I'm not sure why it's so hard to come by around here."
"Very good and will definitely try again if the chance arises."
"Not a great beer when it comes to Belgian standards but a lot better than most commercial mass produced beers out there"
"D - The Leffe Brune is super easy drinking. It's both delicious and smooth. I could have one after another. Another Belgian beer I love!"
"Kind of hard to rate this one as though it really doesn't compare to say a Rochefort or a Chimay Blue it's only a fraction of the price and works perfectly as an easier drinking Belgian Dark. At least where I am Leffe occupies that position of easy drinking affordable dark with really no competition."
"I wouldn't want many of these at one time but would drink this again, maybe two and I would want to move on to something else or stop there. I see this on tap sometimes, I'd be interested in trying it out at a bar. Not bad but not great."
"D: Quite easy to drink, and a fairly reasonable ABV."
"d-- Ok, nothing special, or earth shattering.solid beer and on tap is nice considering the options in Sydney. Tasted a lot of the alchohol and a bit of a turn off, but a good beer. What I have heard the blond is better."
"Overall, this leffe is decent but I would prefer to drink the blonde over this brune."
"Consumed with Upper Silesian karminadel (kind of schnitzel) - perfect match ;)"
"Leffe Brune was one of the first beers to introduce me to Belgian style ales. Needless to say, my opinion of it has changed over the last five or six years. I can still enjoy the beer but not without knowing there are far more and far better Belgian offerings out there. If you like Leffe, do yourself a favour and start looking more into other Belgian beers."
"Mouthfeel: Creamy but a little thin, carbonation is pretty high and crisp"
"Drinkablility and notes: this is a good to very good beer ,clean tasting for a dark brew ,sweet yet subtle and very easy to enjoy anytime,i prefer dark beer to be more rich and thicker but this is tasty and balanced."
"OVERALL: A very average look and nose, but the taste and palate were a pleasant surprise on this one. I must admit, I'd had this one quite a few times when out on the town, but have never really paid much attention to it. This one was a pleasant surprise and I'll pay more attention next time I order it at a restaurant or bar. Drinkable and enjoyable, I'll be ordering this one again."
"Drinkability: Pretty solid beer. Could definitely see myself drinking it again sometime."
"A full flavored brew! highly recommended!"
"D: Far more drinkable than the regular Leffe I have back home and more drinkable then nearly all dark Belgians that I've had the pleasure of having. Strongly recommend this, particularly on tap."
"Overall, not bad, but not particularly good either. I have had better Leffe Brune on-tap"
"With the relatively high ABV of 6 and half, plus the sweetness, drinkability is good but not as high as it could be. This is a great beer but strikes me as something I wouldn't want to drink all the time."
"Came in a tulip glass with one-finger tan head that stuck around and around and left little lace patches around the glass. A thick sweet malt smell of caramel with hints of burnt malts. Also some chocolate and toffee and some hints of dark fruits as well. More of the same in the taste as the beer is thicker and more fuller-bodied than I thought it would be. Smooth and creamy, the tongue is mostly showered with sweetness ranging from standard sweet malts (cocoa, caramel, toffee, oatmeal) and balanced with some bread malts, fruit tastes like orange and that Belgian yeast strain I always pick up in Belgians. This balance helps it from becoming too sweet and aids the backbite in being clean and strong, not syrupy."
"Pours a dark brown colored body, with a slight reddish tinge. Has a small head, whitish in color. Has a very pleasing floral aroma. Also has a nice roasted taste, along with some floral notes. Good, not too heavy a body."
"Taste again was fruity. Raisons and maybe a little banana as well. Malty goodness"
"I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this. I am not a fan of the blonde as I feel it's not constructed that great. This on the other hand, really is put together nicely. Nice and low ABV as well for a solid, sessionable Belgian."
"D- I would definitely have another."
"M&D: lightly fizzy on the palate and the body is not thin for a pasteurised bottled beer, this bottle of Leffe Bruin drinks quite well thanks to a simple theme and a decent level of semi-dry and bitter input of hops. A surprisingly pleasant offering from the InBev!"
"a surprisingly decent offering from inbev."
"Not very carbonated and a medium body almost like an over steeped sweetened tea. A good middle of the road brown."
"I never heard of Leffe until I was at a party and one of my good friends was drinking it. Traded away a Gritty McDuff's pale ale for one and boy did I regret it. Smelt it and it smelled very bitter for a beer, especially a Belgian one. Poured nicely with a cream white head, which gave it some potential. I tasted it and my first reaction was to check the bottle if it was expired. It was very bitter and sour... possibly too much hops. Had another sip and left it in the sink. If you were to try, it would take a while to drink another one after the first."
"Mouthfeel - medium body and a little chewy. The beer is smooth with good carbonation and a dry finish."
"D - Really not my favorite beer but worth a try, drinkable"
"Overall - A decent offering in the dark ale style. I definitely enjoyed this one more so than the Leffe Blonde, yet there are lacking characteristics in this particular brew regarding the depth and complexity in its taste. A bit too sweet.... don't get me wrong, I love the sweetness of Chimay Grande Reserve or a JW Lees Harvest Ale, but this one seemed out of place. I would, however, get it again though. Definitely worth a try."
"this is a nice brew on tap, much better then the bottled version, and its one belgian that is best fresh."
"The alcohol warmth and hint of fusel character is getting in the way of the drinkability. Im glad to have tried this, but have to say i am disappointed in this brew, with more noticable alcohol than the 8% tripel from Konigshoeven i enjoyed yesterday."
"Notes: What a great offering from Leffe. I appreciated their blonde but to me this is head and shoulders above their Blonde."
" Final Comment: Overall a decent beer and a cheap alternative to other more expensive Belgian ales. It's also an excellent beer for the uneducated friend wanting to learn more about Belgian Ales or Beer in general."
"Very pleasant taste and quite smooth with a light yet definitive Belgian nose. The malt texture coupled with a rather light apparent carbonation gives the beer a nice feel. Not too sweet on the palate, the 6.5% number surprises me as I couldn't detect much alcohol; though did consume with a meal, a 'conversation' and a water side. Alas, I found this beer to offer a very nice mouthfeel and it was quite enjoyable. Sans food I think the drinkability may be compromised a bit, but will certainly try again."
"D= very drinkable but I'd probably stop at 2 and switch to something less bold."
"It poured like a good wine...it was begging to be poured into the awaiting glass that wore its logo. One of the most drinkable beers I have ever experienced with a taste of a sweet Belgian mixed with the density of an English brown. Aftertaste is a bit dusty with an olive aroma. Great beer to pair with foods of the same variety!"
"A classic Belgium brown brew. Very drinkable dark brown/black brew. It is as good a beginner beer into Belgium beers as any. It's lower Alcohol (6.5%) makes it a good beer to drink all night. I would recommend to just about any non light beer drinker."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability; mouhfeel is medium bodied, and pretty smooth with just a slight bite from the carbonation. Drinkability is decent, but is hurt by that slight metallic taste."
"Poured into a frozen mug a deep brown color with a creamy off white 3 inch head. The head settled slowly to a heavy sheen with heavy clingy lacing throughout. The smell was of malts, caramel and sweet fruits. Tasted of roasted malts and was rather sweet up front with banana and spice notes. The carbonation was nice medium bodied and went down rather well. I have finished half the Growler now and may as well finish it off, since it will be flat tomorrow from what I am told. Oh well, Cheers!"
"D: Very good and interesting smoked accents with heavy fruit. Leffe certainly put some thought into the mix and I will pull for this one again."
"This is very drinkable and not threatening as I kind of said in the beginning. A good stepping stone for the newbies!"
"Taste like it smells, like a chocolatey beer mixed with a witbier or hefeweizen. Delicious. This beer is a must try on-tap."
"Where's my dark fruit and/or cocoa flavors? It had some moments, but I ended up dissapointed. At $7 a draft, I won't be doing that again."
"If you've had Leffe blond, then there isn't much to say about this beer. It's exactly what you'd expect. It's Leffe with some roasted/chocolate malt. It's a good idea. I just don't think it comes off all that well. It's very carbonated and makes it somewhat difficult to drink. It also has a lot (maybe too much) going on flavor wise. It's decent, not spectacular and I don't think I'll buy it again."
"D: Finally able to try this beer by Leffe. A good beer, not great, has great moments, but inconsistent."
"Definitely one of the best beer I had."
"D: I'd definitely order this again. I'll be looking to see if it's available in my area. I think this would work as a good 'starter' Belgian."
"D- Highly drinkable but nothing that will blow you away. Nonetheless, a nice beer."
"head rises quickly on the poor, and looks quite dense. color is a clear dark amber. head drops after a minute or so to a thin layer, which stays. smell is sweet fruity, with some darker malts. taste brings a sweet fruitiness, balanced well with brown malts and bitter, as well as a good level of carbonation. could defnitely continue for a few more of these, but the finish could be a bit cloying perhaps after awhile."
"drinkability - Don't underestimate this beer. AB might import it but it is a great bee. I ordered a flight of beers and this was the best out of 4. would buy this again, very tastey."
"Overall: great beer. Consistent and very tasteful. Leffe Brune is one of my regular Belgium ales as it is easy to find and not overpriced."
"Overall: Better than the blonde IMO. Well built & though subdued, still has some solid flavor. Would have again."
"Not a bad Belgian, certainly better than the Blond if I recall correctly."
"Overall - A bold combination of dark barley malts, wheat and spicy hops. The combination works well, however, I think that a dryer, less sweet, feel would help to bring out the burnt malt taste better. Slightly out of balance."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer. Slightly bitter, black olive taste was very distinctive, but did not take away from the beer overall."
"I'm relatively new to the beer drinking world, but when I first tasted this beer I thought, ""that's what a beer should taste like."" This is one of my favorite beers."
"Had this on-tap at Cloverleaf Tavern in Caldwell, NJ... from what I hear, this is the only bar in the state that has Leffe Brune on-tap... never seen the bottled-form anywhere, except for, of course, the blonde, so I was eager to try this one... Amazing, frothy and bubbly head dominated the Leffe serving glass with an extremely dark-brown, prune-colored hue... smell was very typical for the style, with dehydrated fruits, figs, and caramel nuances... taste was sublime, thick, rich, and satisfying without being overbearing... great mocha and caramel taste led to a strong presence of brown sugars and malts... a nice mouthfeel with easy drinkability at a modest 6.5% ABV... Definitely recommended..."
"Overall a lovely beer."
"On tap at Lucky Baldwin's Delirium Cafe, pours a dark brown with an ok white head. This is what I would call a cloyingly sweet beer. It has a real sweet twang to it, maybe also sweetness added from fruity taste as well. I also felt it had a bit of roasted malt character to it as well but the sweetness stands out more than that. Overall it was just too sweet for me to enjoy."
"I also drank this beer in Belgium under the Leffe 6 Brune label."
"I dove into this one expecting a dubbel or a strong dark belgian, but its not a dubbel nor a strong dark belgian, its a belgian dunkel (dark) ale. Its certainly a interesting beer, but keep in mind its not a dubbel... kinda like a porter is not a robust or baltic porter."
"Thanks to mmmmBEEEER for sharing a bottle. The beer is a clear dark brown-amber color with a medium thick and rocky beige head that dissipates slowly. Patches of lacing. Aroma of malt and dark fruit with a touch of barley. Medium, smooth body with malt and nut flavors atop a moderate hops base. Some yeast flavors here and there as well. The finish is roasty with a fruity aftertaste. Above average overall."
"Drinkability: Excellent. It goes excellent with food, I could easily see myself drinking a couple while watching a football or baseball game (it doesn't seem to aesthetically match basketball, though), and it's possible to put down 4 or 5 in the course of several hours at the bar without feeling bloated."
"D: Extremely drinkable. Not especially thick or overly filling. Sessionable."
"Drinkability : une bonne bière dans style abbaye brune"
"Pretty drinkable, but the sugary mouth-feel might be too much for some less experienced Belgian ale drinkers."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is good beer to stick with for an evening especially if youre in the mood for the style."
"d: a great well blended beer; great malt presence; nice sweetness; great beer"
"D- Good beer but its parts have a little trouble coming together."
"I wanted to put off having the Leffe Brune till a visit to Ice Cold Beer and I finally did and it was suggested by a client who thought we could meet there. Immediately I ordered this beer that I should have long tried... (having already tried Westys long ago) The Leffe brune did not fall below my expections at all. I did not reveal it that day though... instead I bought a bottle to go as it was not sold at the shops and supermarkets locally. This Leffe pours into my tall Leffe chalice with a nice thick 2 finger plus head that was generally creamy but slightly more bubbly than the other Leffes. When I poured it at Ice Cold Beer for Rex and myself it did not yield much head but this time it did and I have no idea why. The color of the pour was a dark ruby brown. The smell was caramel, dark fruits, spices, yeast and some malts too. The taste starts off spicey, malty with light brown sugar sweetness; the fruitiness kicks in shortly after not exactly an outright strong fruitiness but it instead blended with the malts and sugars to become a malty sweet fruitiness with some dates and raisins. The fruits were not the pronounced and it was rather light but the malts go strong and reveal the light fruitiness beneath it. The finish was slightly yeasty and slightly bitter dry as well. The after taste was malty with a hint of dark fruits; slowly raisins surface in the after taste. Sweet malty, slightly fruity aromas were detected on the nose. A final note to the taste is the ressemblance to the Leffe Blond in a sense that I can taste the typical Leffe taste (mainly from the malts and spices); very nice. The taste improves as the beer warms; so do not drink it too quickly if you have it out from the fridge! The fruitiness and brown sugar sweetness seem to show up a little more and the taste seems more mellow as it warms. The mouthfeel was probably medium bodied but with a fairly low amount of carbonation but a slightly creamy yet slightly stinging feel in the throat which was pretty good per se; nonetheless, it was generally a smooth drinking beer. Very nice indeed."
"Dark brown with mahogany highlights and a tan head that settled to a ring and a few clouds. Light carbonation with hints of rye bread and malt. Tastes of caramel, cane or yellow sugar, I found the sweetness nicely held in check by a nicely balanced bitterness. A rich and full mouthfeel. Lacing got more impressive as the glass emptied. Warming brought out molasses, increasing sweetness yet still bitter; that aftertaste got more pronounced with air. Silky smooth, delightful mouthfeel, very rich and filling. I quite enjoyed this beer and found it more interesting than the Leffe Blonde; my only criticism might be that it's a bit too rich at times, but that's a minor distraction. My preferred Leffe right now."
"Poured a huge light brown colored head. Dark brown colored beer has a slight glow at the bottom of the glass. Rich aroma of cocoa and yeast. Starts off with a mild cocoa bitterness. Sweetness picks up with flavors of raisins, roasted malt, a bit of rum, and fresh dough. Soft, soothing mouth feel from the fine carbonation. Just a hair on the sweet side, but otherwise a fine beer with plenty going on."
"D: My mistake of drinking it too soon out of the fridge aside, it is a very drinkable beer. Big enough to slow you down a bit, while not so big to keep you from having another, something I think I will do now."
"D - Tasty beer thats not too overpowering. Would drink a couple of these without a problem. Unless I was driving of course."
"From my notes 5/31/2007, pours a two-finger off-white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Deep mahogany color. Malty nose. Good carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Flavor is balanced with hints of caramel, clean finish. Served in 330ml tulip glass, part of meal at La Belle Epoque Restaurant Brussels, Belgium."
"On a recent trip, I had a couple of these on tap in Brussels. This is a sweet, malty, and lightly roasty beer. It has a modest yeast aroma and taste, along with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. It's clean and a little herbal. With modest carbonation, the brew had a slight head. As you finish the beer, it picks up a sugary and carmalized flavor that was less present early in the taste. This is a clean, full flavored beer. This is a rich, yet very drinkable ale."
"Poured into a Leffe glass, a nice darker brown ith a fluffy white lacing. In the nose, it has sweet and spicy kind of aroma. It has a great taste, sweet and just a bit of sourness that was was not anticipated. A great Belgian session style beer, with a bit more taste."
"The light body and subtlety of the hops makes this very drinkable."
"all in all, a very lovely beer. I wish I could find it more in the US"
"Flavour continues developing as long as drink, it seems to expand, taste of chocolate, some vanilla, coffee and raisins. Good, but I missed the old one."
"It looks so good, what a pity it doesn't live up to the promise its image paints."
"Not in the same class as the tripel in the Leffe range but a pretty decent beer. There are many around that are better but this is not one to turn your nose up to."
"Drank this on-tap at Vol De Nuit in New York City. Served in the proper goblet. Pours a clear, deep red with a medium, white head. Great retention. Smells and tastes of burnt sugar, bananas, bread, yeasty, and red grapes. Nice complexity to it; it kept morphing as it slowly warmed to room temperature. Medium mouthfeel, highly drinkable beer. Definitely recommended."
"It looked, smelled, and tasted like a nitro pour to me, but the bartender said it wasn't. Served in its proper glassware, it was dark red/brown with a creamy head. Had great lacing and retention. Smelled and tasted lightly of dark fruit and a medicinal flavor, without a lot of yeast character. The taste seemed dominating by something else, like nitro, but apparently that's not the case. Overall, a smooth sipper but not that flavorful. I'd call it the Guinness of Belgian beer."
"A solid brew, but so far I prefer their blonde or the tripel."
"On draft at KClingers: Another amazing pull at KClingers, a beer I haven't seen anywhere else in the US. It's much darker than I remembered or expected. Drinks smooth and slightly roasty. The aroma is somewhat pruney, as is the flavor, but ulimately this is a damn good dark, sweet beer. (#2716, 2/17/2007)"
"M: Medium body, a bit too carborated for my taste. Dryness helps drinkability. Tastes do not harmonize completely. Drinkability still good. Like a dark wheat beer."
"D - A great beer; I'm not a huge weize beer fan, but this takes that flavor and then adds some great malty complexity; definitely one I could drink a lot"
"d: not the worst belgian dark i've had, but certainly far from many others. would drink it if i was in a pinch for belgian darks, but not otherwise"
"It's quite simply one of the best beers I've ever had."
"Thanks to my great son, studying overseas in Amsterdam, I was sent this for the unique chance to enjoy."
"It's a mild Belgian. Has typical Belgian characteristics - sugar, spiced candy. But, for a Belgian, nothing particularly special."
"Drinkability: Tasty, and at only 6.5% ABV, quite drinkable, with a lightness to it despite the seemingly heavy malt sweetness."
"drinkability is ok. the sting from the carbonation takes a way from it a little, but otherwise it's nice."
"Overall: I like it"
"Haven't tried many in this style, and I was expecting something heavier and ""darker"" tasting. It was surprisingly mild however. Good color, amber with a white head, and constant carbonation streaming up the glass. The taste was clean, and somewhat fruity, with a slight hint of burnt sugar and caramel. I would order this again over the Blond, as it was a nice change."
"Big effervescence in the mouth, slight lip tingle like sherbet lolly, medium body, and semi-sweet finish."
"A nice example of a belgian dark, complex without being mindblowing and some nice flavours and smells once allowed to settle in the glass. I could drink a few of these."
"The flavor seems best when served colder."
"I think I prefer Leffe Brune to its Blonde counterpart, though they're different enough beers that making the comparison isn't exactly fair. Regardless, Leffe Brune is a delicious ale, sweet and tasty, and definitely worth a drink."
"This makes for a perfect choice when you're craving some belgian goodness but don't want to commit the time and attention that a more serious beer commands, perhaps because one's senses are split between the glass, the plate, the lady's conversation, and the lady's outfit."
"good mouthfeel which aids the sipping nature of this beer. Not exceptional, but quite enjoyable."
"This ale, packed with sugar, maybe a good restorative for those who remained unconscious for a long time. Conscious drinker must have something else."
"Drinkability: the review says it all."
"This beer, although nice to have when most of what is available is macros or generic lagery type beers, is too sweet for me. I can see having one, once in a while, but I definitely wouldn't want to session it or anything. Nevertheless, I'm glad I tried it, and now I know that it's a decent import choice if Heineken is the only other option."
"D - A little heavy for a session beer. Flavours are surprisingly bold and assertive. A little one-dimensional, but better than mass-imports."
"This beer is produced by Inbev, which produces a lot of middle-of-the-road beers that do not affend anyone, but lack authenticity. Still I have reviewed this beers without taking this into account and it turns out to be a nice beer."
"there are better beers in this vein out there, and I can only hope that people who find themselves enjoying aspects of this will seek out better things."
"Had this beer on tap at the Half Door in Hartford, Conn. Deep brown color with reddish tones, opaque. Thick light tan colored head that left significant lacing as I drank the beer. This beer smelled somewhat nutty and sweet. The taste started with a slightly hoppy bite, was sweet in the middle, and then tasted hoppy again as I swallowed it. I enjoyed the taste but wasn't blown away by it, as I have been with similar style beers. There was just a little carbonation and the beer had a smooth presentation, making it easy to drink. The taste of alcohol was present. A good beer and recommended but there are others I'd recommend ahead of it."
"Dark brown in colour with fairly high carbonation. Caramel malt is the dominant aroma, and there are some minor notes of baked apple, spices, and red berries. Its flavor profile is similar to its aromatic one, but with some additional notes of raisin, brown sugar, vanilla, and those swedish berry candies. The body is still pretty thick in spite of the carbonation, and the finish is quite sweet. Very easy drinking stuff."
" As it was in Belgium, this beer is easy to get used to. It's rather low abv, 6.5%, makes it possible to enjoy quite a few of these. The beer's chocolaty hue, light tan head and malty nose are just the start. The first to last sip hints of candy sugar, vanilla, raisin?and malt. It's very smooth. It's low carbonation appeals to me, as I'm not fan of champagne like brews. Every place we stopped to refuel in Belgium had this, either on tap or bottled, and it was tough to pass it up. For a brown it's rather light bodied. Couple that with it's low carbonation and, to me, it's an any time of the year beer. It's modest price won't break your wallet to have a case of this on hand. And, it pairs well with a hamburger, a steak or just a simple cheese and fruit plate. I'd have to say a hop head would pass on this one since there's no hop taste at all. But, for someone just getting there feet wet on a world beer tour, Leffe Brune would be a good start."
"Overall - A pretty good beer.... Worth a try..."
"Really nice beer."
"This is one i'm revisiting after quite some time. Looks nice, dark red almost brown with not much of a smell. Essence of roasted malts and a subtle bitterness make the majority of the flavors of this brew. Very tasty, Goes down pretty easy and has a warming to it. I like this stuff."
"Drinkability: No, I would not have another. It looked good, and smelled good, but did not live up to its potential. There are other offerings available."
"This beer came in a long stemmed Leffe glass. It was a dark cola brown with a thin creamy vanilla pudding-like head. Smelled of bland musky barley, sweet raisins and a slight wheat and spicy yeast dryness. Tasted of a watery sour caramel, cherries and brandy that blossomed into a little dry hop and spicy yeast. The finish was a bit bland with a caramel coffee. The mouth feel was medium boded that felt a little too heavy in my mouth due to the light, small bubbled carbonation. I expected more from this beer. The flavors were all right, but they didnt pack much of a punch. I spent most of my time squinting my taste buds trying to pick up on what was happening. When I was ¾ done, I ordered another beer out of boredom."
"M/D: Totally smooth and refreshing. I actually think this is one of the more drinkable belgian darks that I've had. I hope this isn't due to the lack of flavor. In any case, goes down crisp and smooth. I think I would even like this in the summer."
"Overall - I was actually a little disappointed in this beer. It was very, very tasty and recommend it to you - especially on draft if you can find it - but like I say above, there are tons of other Belgian brews I would rather have."
"I tasted some other great ales along with this that night, but just kept thinking that , for me, this is the perfect ale."
"In the end a good though not great beer."
"D - Not recommended for chugging because this beer must be treated with respect. This beer is excellent and I recommend both on-tap and bottle serving. I enjoy this beer on the cold side, but I believe if drank at a warmer temperature, the aromas will be overwhelming. My favourite beer to date and I would gladly have another one."
"I am really not a fan of Leffe any more. I drank gallons of their brews these last three weeks and they really didnt do much for me. This one seems to be rather more German than Belgian, like a thicker version of a typical German dark. Carmel and Roasted malts dominate. The color is nice, a dark brown, almost black with a thick white head. The taste and mouthfeel are rather sweet and not very complex. Very dark.."
"nice rich beer looks great, nice dark brownish color. has a unique taste to it kinda sweet but it is rich in flavor it whould be difficult to drink to many in one sitting due to the taste of it, unless you drank it often and got used to it. and much better than there blonde beer."
"Near black in appearance, although not opaque, creamy brown tinged head, very good rings of lacing. Quite a bitter taste with roasted type flavours of coffee, brown sugar, licorice and light spices. Also a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel was a little powdery and even thin. Overall a decent beer, but not particularly a favourite of mine."
"As nice as this beer actually tastes, it moves so quickly that if you blink you stand a chance of missing something meaningful. It takes some work to nail down just what you're experiencing, and in the end, it comes off as less than the sum of its parts. The ABV is present enough that it does its part in keeping the complexity as rapid fire as it is, but if you;re content to just sit back and sip and not worry a whole lot about what you're tasting, then it goes down well, overall. But for me, it just felt a little like a spinning amusement ride, and you won't often see me on those. Enough said."
"Just as the name suggests, this beer is a medium-brown color with minimal foam and lacing. The beer looks a bit cloudy and seems to have little carbonation and so I'll have to deduct points for that. The smell is not unique in anyway; roasted malts and some brown sugar undertones. The taste, however, is interesting with a medium-bodied texture that brings out the malt flavors with enough bitterness to result in a balanced and refreshing beer. The dry character of the beer along with its relatively viscosity hurt its drinkabilityn. Overall, I liked this beer and would have it again without complaint."
"Notes: this one is VERY good"
"I previously had this beer on tap, where it was even better than the bottle. If you ever get the chance, you should definitely try this one."
"Leffe Brown...dark brown...almost black. The color is nice enough, but the beer looked flat and lifeless in my glass. The taste lived down to the appearance. It was dull, simple, uninvolving...well, let's just sum it up under ""bland"". That's all I have to say."
"Drinkability: More to be savored. The alcohol presence and the sweetness makes this one a touch difficult to navigate. Still, a very enjoyable beer that went well on a cloudy evening. Recommended."
"Enter a toasted, filling flavor. Quite useful. This is gourmet beer, there's more in here than I can identify but most of it is really good. It flows silky and tasty to the last drop. Yes, I could drink a bunch of these, despite the high alcohol."
"Very smooth finish with a sweet aftertaste. Spices linger and a nice alcohol buzz in the nose."
"Once you've adjusted to the brew after the first three sips, it's tough to put it down. Quite good drinkability."
"Pours a dark brown with red highlights, huge off white head forms, refuses to leave in a timely manner, nice lacing. Malty and spicy, some yeast, banana, smells almost weisse like. Taste is sweet malt, little spice at the back of the mouth but mostly sweet. Body is quite full so that with the thickness makes this kind of cloying and not very pleasant. High carbonation."
"Notes: I'll probably try it again. No problems here."
"Truly a world class beer, which may even define the Belgian Dark style!"
"Clear ruby brown with a generous, fluffy tan head that produces nice lace as it recedes. A combination of spice, fruit and malts in the nose. Sweet and malty, with a bitter roasted flavour running through the middle. Fruit and spice are much lighter, letting some chocolate come through. Finishes with a dry maltiness, just slightly astringent."
"Impression: a nice beer, but didn't really hold true to style. Looses it's vernacular flavors. Still a good drinking beer."
"Den"
"The taste is normal, fine, standard. Nothing special save for the afterbite of sweet grassiness. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth carbonation and a nice drinkability, though if I were out, maybe I'd get this one if it weren't owned by evil. Nice beer..."
"With the exception of the tripel, this is in my opinion the best brew from Leffe. Recommended."
"on Tap in a Leffe goblet at The Petit Abeille in NYC. pours dark honey, maple, with gobs of lacing and sheets of lacing. Exhibits a sweet, nutty nose. This is a fruity, nutty, malty brew, notes also of maple syrup, some subtle smokeyness, raisins, all flowing towards a long tasty finish. Fine stuff, especially if you can find it on tap."
"The smell is pretty good but doesn't contain much aside from dark malts. The taste is a bit better but also suffers from being a little too plain. Still, it's not a bad beer, and it's definitely easy to drink."
"Pours an impressive dark brown with some red in the light. The head is thick and bubbly, and off-white, approaching tan, very good lacing and retention. Smell was syrupy-sweet smelling, with some cloves and alcohol. Taste was a dark sweet malt up front, with a bit of spiciness and a rather sweet malty finish. Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. This isn't a bad beer, but it doesn't really leave me wanting more. It's better on draft (and causes quite a stir around the table from those not used to chalices)."
"A better beer than the blonde, not as drinkable though."
"This is definetely the pick of the Leffe litter as it has class and balance in its structure. Unlike the blonde this beer shows real craft and care. The finish has that nice slightly sweet tinge that works well with the style. Good value for the price as well so I will grab a few more while they last."
"Well pooring it in my favorite trappist glass a first notice was there that this beer has white foam what is not the ""normal"" dubbels I like. Not to much smell but the the caracteristic ""Leffe"" geur was in it. The taste was a litle malty but overal sweet and hops was minimised to the low limit a Dubbel can have in my opinion. Only good thing is that you can drink it easily..."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Taste: Very roasted malt, with light mouthfeel and good carbonation. We can only find this on tap back home at a few select places, and the bottle version is much better, a lot less fizzy, a lot more taste."
"There is none of the obvious corn flavors I find typical of Leffe beers. In my opinion this is the best of the Leffe line-up."
"Notes: This beer is very easy to drink.Would've liked it better if the sweetness was toned down a bit. Enjoyed this more than the blonde."
"Brown pour with a medium, creamy tan head. The nose is quite simple. A lit spice, a little sweetness. The taste is of light roasted malts with a caramel sweetness on the finish. Lightly spiced and quite a smooth, creamy body. A little bit of caramel sweetness on the finish. Quite generic for a Belgian but not half bad."
"appearance: very dark brown, with a very wimpy tiny head and moderate lace. The aroma is sweet, of sugary caramel, with some roasted malts. The flavor is also very sweet, dominated by a very sweet caramel flavor, hops are just a mild aftertaste. No detectable fruit flavor except some sweet figs. I think so many beers like this would be vastly improved if they had more hop complexity. This beer is rather one dimensional. I like the leffe blonde better."
"This is interbrews top of the line as such we get it in Canada...Im glad...its a workin mans dark Abby toned down for international palates and it fills that niche very well. Poured a dark slightly clouded chestnut brown with a nice off white head with good retention. Low carbonation. Aromas of molasses-berries-spice with a slight sour note. Starts full bodied and delivers the raisin-spice tastes but has a more pronounced malt presence than Leffe blond giving a pronounce raisin bread impression from the malt...very satisfying...worth the drink....but a tad too sweet for my tastes."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown beer with a nice head with medium retention. Aroma is comprised solely of some malt, which seems a bit weak. Taste is somewhat malty, though a bit too diluted for my taste, with a light chocolate ending. Carbonation is very average and body in too thin for an Abbey Dubbel. Overall, this is a notch below standard dubbel but very good for a macro beer. Hey, I think the world would be a better place if macro brewers could produced more beer like this one."
"Taste is salty toffee candy, or ice cream, with a watery coffee--slightly burnt--aftertaste. As it warms, malt/molassas taste widens and richens. Mouthfeel is creamy, with light carbonation, adding to a make this brew refreshing and drinkable, if not too exciting. A little heavy."
"As much as people rag on Interbrew, I like this beer a lot. I've had it on tap at multiple locations in Canada, as well as in my own basement bar. Its just a generally pleasing, tasty Belgian brown ale. Not overly complicated, but has a nice malty sweetness with a touch of brown sugar and maybe a touch of plum fruitiness to it. Can't quite put my finger on it. Serve it lightly chilled in a chalice glass and you'll enjoy. It doesn't come with quite the same insane pricetag is most other Belgian keg beers do, so its a quite servicable option for those with a home tap setup who want a nice Belgian brown on tap. With that being said, I think there are many excellent US produced Belgian style beers that are far less money and more interesting."
"A tad spice in aftertaste.The Blonde is not as much fun to look at or to taste."
"Drinkability: Not a real heavyweight, but more than 2 or 3 might be overwhelming to me."
"This abbey beer pours a dark brown redish colour with i think long lasting head into the glass. It has a nice little rosted smell, with hints of coffee and chocolate. The taste is a little sweet and not so bitter. There is also some hints of dark chocolate and some bready aftertaste. A quite good beer, but not the best one in Belgium."
"It's better in drinkability than the blonde, but that sweetness gets cloying halfway through one, there is no way I could drink another."
"I'm not any kind of fan of the more commonly available Leffe Blonde, but quite enjoyed this beer. Grab it if you find it."
"This is the easily available belgian around the UK, along with the blond. I dont understand it thought, having been bought by interbrew its sort of seen as the belgian ale for the masses but I dont find it palatable at all, a nice bottle of abbaye des rocs would go down much better"
"This is on the lighter side of a medium bodied beer and combined with the simple flavors this is very drinkable. The mouthfeel is smooth at the start with a relatively clean finish. Nice beer."
"The aftertaste is dominated by the saccharine sweetness, but after a while, the bitter notes makes the taste more balanced."
"Another good beer from the Leffe stable and another beer that has helped introduce me to Belgian beers."
"Due to its sweetness, I think Leffe Brun would make a better after-dinner beer than it does a session beer. I would certainly recommend this beer. Good stuff."
"The best brew of the triumvirate of the Leffes. Pours a dark brown caramel tone with a thick head that fades eventually, it being white. The smell, a blend of malts, wheats, fruityness even, is exceptional and inviting, guiding you straight into a complex, slightly sweet and extremely satisfying taste. This is a beer to keep in store, definetly."
"Never had a Flanders Red, and I don't know anything about the style. But this beer does intrigue me. Pours a dark black, but hold it to a light source and it glows blood red, making me feel like a vampire, haha! Head is billowy and off white, and consistent with moderate carbonation. Smells fresh and wheaty. Taste is very good, hoppy, with a ""sting"" to it that stays with the aftertaste, yet sweet all the time. Very fun beer!"
"Pours a medium to dark brown color with a beige head that dies rather quickly. Notes of plum and other dark fruits as well as a yeastiness that smells somewhat like wet cardboard (sounds bad; but not, it's in the mix). Rich maltiness intertwined with a delicate hop balance makes this beer a highly drinkable treat. The 6.5% ABV helps in that department as well. This Belgian isn't too rich, one might say it's a bit watery, but it has a really nice flavor."
"Tasted like a fine Belgian without so much body or complexity. A nice balance of some European hops and plenty of sweet malt. I loved the mouthfeel as it is just so satisfying, finishing quite dry without much bitterness at all. Goes down quite well with a variety of foods. This is a winner."
"Pours a deep brown with red highlights with a nice somwhat creamy very sticky head,aroma is very sweet and brandyish.A pretty comples ale first I got some rich port like flavors with some candied sugar notes with a light smokiness that lingers into the finish.A nice beer to savor after a meal like I did,very well made and drinkable for the style in my mind."
"Pretty good beer in my opinion. Poured a reddish brown with a frothy off-white head. Plenty of lacing. Smell was roasty and a tad astringent with some sugary sweetness and a grainy edge to it. Taste was quite refreshing with a corny almost Wit taste wo it, but it stayed much deeper with a creamy, syrup ladden center and a malty nutty ending. Mouthfeel was somewhat carbonated with a good amount of spritzy bubbling. Overall a decent beer."
"Served at the Eulogy bar. This beer poured a dark brown, nearly opaque color. Tints of ruby shown through when held up to the light. The head thinned out quickly and became just a film. Served in its proper chalice glass, the beer gave off the subtle aroma of roasted grains and fermented fruits. Taste was textured with a slight candy sweetness and some sour malts. An enjoyable and easy drinking Belgium ale that can stand on its own."
"Tastes of sweet malt, fruit, dough, dark candy, toffee, and some phenol spices to balance out the flavor. Very even and clean. A bit sweet for some, but another great session beer by Leffe. If all Amercian mass produced beers were of this quality many BAs would sing a different tune. A good beer by any standards."
"Lovely reddish-brown hue under a red-tinged tan head that stuck around a little while but left some very, very nice lace well down the glass. The nose is fruity sweet, as so many French and Belgian beers have. The mouth is crisp and tingly, with the same fruity sweetness. The taste also starts out there, particularly as the brew warmed in the glass. There was a definitely hoppy bitterness in the finish, though, that left a quite good impression. I enjoyed this brew, but that citrus fruit sweet-sourness in the nose and initial taste have always kept me away from francophone beers."
"11.2 oz glass, on draught. Deep brown color with a thick, off-white head. Not much in the nose but some sweet malt and mild chocolate. Nutty flavors seem to be the easiest to trace. Very malty with some nice chocolate undertones...very dry finish with a coating feeling in the mouth, nice flavorful aftertaste. Nothing too special, but it is an enjoyable and highly drinkable Belgian ale."
"Appears a deep amber brown with a moccha tan colored two fingered sized head while leaving a nice even web of lacing. Aroma has mild brown sugar hints coated with darker roasted specialty malts, and as it warms forms pleasant fruit tones notably tart apple notes. Taste is a very balanced flavor consisting of a nice tartness that blends and contrasts very well with the harsh dark roasts coating the palate with trickling sweet fruit tones. Mouthfeel is a lighter creamy body very nice going down nothing bad to say about it. Drinkability is amazingly easy to drink this beer, and enjoyable classic session beer."
"Lovely head, not too dark. The beer is very dark brown. opaque. It smells a little medicinal and sweet. A little like the sugared roasted nuts they sell on the street. Tastes nutty, too. Hints of cocoa. Not too sweet, but pretty thick-felling in the mouth, which hurts the drinkability of an otherwise exceptional beer."
"I had this beer on tap in a pub in Montreal, I was extremely pleasantly suprised, as I had not heard of the beer before, and simply chose it on a whim. A rich, deep brown color with some hints of deep red. Excellent smell, with some slight fruity scents. The beer felt great in my mouth and went down extremely easily. I had this beer along side a beef dish, and it was an excellent compliment. An outstanding beer, although one that would likely be difficult to drink in large quantities."
"Small head, as to be exspected with this kind of brew, the nose and apperance both well above average with the rich malt hues giving this a sort of Newcastle+russet color. Taste was unlike any beer I've had previously, being somewhat of a novice... A VERY sweet, nutty flavor. Some raison notes. Recomended to anyone who likes the artisinal or nut brow styles as it is sure to please. A treat."
"This beer was malt-tastic! A very sweet, malty brown ale... didn't really come across as sour to me. Dark brown in color with a medium-sized head. A very drinkable beer, but I found it so sweet and delicious that I was able to force myself to take very small sips and make it last. I'm tempted to say there were hints of raisins in this guy, but I really don't know. My taste buds simply said ""goooood."""
"This is a very nice brew that I prefer to the Leffe Blonde. Brown-red color. Nice solid head, kind of sweet taste accompanied with chocolate and dark bread. Imho this brew should be enjoyed in small sips. Overall I like this ale, I will definetly buy it again!"
"Pours a brown colour topped a tanned head that settles down rather easily. How could u not love this beer? Sweet fruity taste and aroma. Goes down quite easily and ABV is just fine so as to drink and not get drunk (Not more than 15 bottles though heh). One of the best dark Ales i've had so far. Abbaye de Leffe has done it again. Great brew!!!"
"Opaque, darkest brown possible with a big bottle-conditioned head (3/4 of an inch and climbing) that's dark tan in color. Laces in large mats made up of small bubbles. A little nutmeg and some red wine in the aroma. Light and airy malts, some sense of the water/wine mix you get at a Catholic Mass and a decided impression of apple stems (yes, the stems). Mid mouth, there starts to be a toffee sense along with some phenolic spices. As with Leffe Blond, too much sweetness going on. The astrigent undertone works pretty well to balance the finish, with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Pretty good...thanks to Rachel M. and Ethan L. for bringing a bottle back from Europe, and Liza P. and Ken K. for letting me drink it."
"The color on the pour a deep garnet with a monstrous head and the consistency frothy and light as it slowly dematerializes the lace forms a fine clinging sheet the color beige. Nose is malt, raisins, with hints of bread dough, quite nice actually. Overly sweet start, top is lean; the finish has a potent acidic bite, the hops sparse, and the finish malt dry and long lasting."
"Pours a brownish color with a slight reddish tone in therethe head is a nice brownish/tan color, very nice lace. On the nose slightly spicy and hints of dark fruit. On the palate the flavors were slightly spicy, hints of chocolate, slight bitter/tartness, sweet, hint of apple, and perhaps pears. Smooth mouthfeel...very enjoyable brewhad this at Monks Café yesterday before I went to the warp tour in Camden, NJ."
"250"
"Deep dark dark brown color with a thick brown head.  Thick lace on the glass (leffe goblet).. and it is very lasting.  Spicy nose with hints of hops.  Complex flavor of chocolate, yeast, nuts(hazel), and spice.  Wonderful smooth mouth.  Slides through and coats the palate.  Aftertaste is quite tart with hints of fruit (prune).  Very drinkable for the abv and as a brown.  A great tap beer to start a meal.  As it warms in the goblet, it becomes even more silky smooth."
"A good brune, but once again perhaps a bit sweet, i like it though, but just not as much as i could have (because of the sweetness)."
"Syrupy and dark with perfect sweetness and fruity undertones. Excellent brew."
