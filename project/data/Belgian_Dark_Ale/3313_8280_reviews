"Not bad, tends to the sweet side."
"A very nice dark ale, a style which is rapidly becoming a favorite.  This is absolutely delicious and just sweet enough to be desirable but not cloying.  The price point is reasonable.  The only negative point for me is the absolute lack of head and lacing."

"So-so; nothing special. Uninspired looks, while the aroma and flavour are sweet and fruity. Slight off-notes in the background. Insipid, watery body. No great shakes, though I expect the age of the bottle also has something to do with it. No need to run out and hunt it down."

"I like the multi-charachteristic transitional nature of this beer. It is half rich and sweet, have bitter and harsh. The key is the point of transition. That moment is why I liked this. An interesting brew that is worth trying. I also disagree with some posts suggesting food with this. You'd really lose aha makes this good. The is a sipper by itself."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours very cloudy dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of raisin, prune, caramel, toast, toffee, light chocolate, dark bread, and earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of caramel, toast, raisin, prune, toffee, light chocolate, dark bread, molasses, and earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, raisin, toast, toffee, dark bread, light chocolate, and earth on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and complexity of flavors; but were not as robust as I was hoping; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian dark ale. Nice flavor balance and complexity; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"M: easy drinking, somewhat thin for mouthfeel but it is a lower ABV beer"

"After popping the cap there is a gross plug of yeast stuck to the underside of the cap and around the mouth of the bottle. Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Chunks of sediment are seen floating around and settling to the bottom of the glass. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, and some slight soy sauce aromas. Taste is much the same but quite watery and slightly sour. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that seems to be suffering from a slight infection issue perhaps."
""
"Taste is a great mix of ripe fruit and tartness. The mouthfeel is a little syrupy but not overly sweet and it balanced the tartness. Some wood is shining through. This is not a standard Belgian dark ale with the complex yeast profile and proves Belgians are still creative."

"O: This beer shares a lot of similarities with a dubbel, except that it is a little lighter-bodied on the palate and doesn’t have as much alcohol content. There is some sweetness, but it is not cloying. I would definitely pick up another bottle of this if I see it again."
""
"A malty yummy beer, goes very well with robust food."
""
"An easy-drinking dark ale that pairs well with light conversation. While not quite a sessionable beer, if one takes their time, a second offering would be welcome."
"Overall: OK, but I was expecting more."
""
""
""
"Overall: It is good and definitely is a good for a brown ale. Nothing too spectacular. Definitely drinkable. Not worth the price."
""
"I let this warm a bit out of the fridge. Poured with a nice, large, thick, foamy, frothy, fluffy, creamy, tan head that lasts a long time and lots of lace. Color is an opaque brown with a little red and lots of sediment in suspension. Aroma is roast, cocoa, molasses, spice, yeast. Flavors almost exactly the same, just more intense plus a nice balance of carbonic tang and just enough sweetness. Body and carbonation are good. Beer is a little chewy. Finish is of average length and satisfying. Decent beer."
"It's interesting, but I think the warning was deserved—this feels certainly a little past its prime, although the base characters are worthy. It's certainly still drinkable at this age (Dave said probably two years), but I'd love to try it young as well."
"O: I generally don't care for the lower strength Belgian dark ales, but this one quickly grew on me. In the end, Bink Bruin is just a pleasant, enjoyable beer that is sessionable by Belgian standards."
"Sweet smell and dito taste wher the alcohol is well hidden. Not a spectacular beer but well made and very drinkable. Overall a good beer"
"Reddish brown in the wine glass. Has that classic candied fruit soup taste. Label raves about bringing hops back into Belgian brewing, but I don't think this will win friends. Sweet brown sugar flavor with a touch of vermouth. It does have some bitterness, but most of the flavor comes from the murky, musty funk. Peculiar fruitcake smell with something like artificial vanilla. If this is an authentic and historic beer, I bow down, but it reminds me why I keep vowing not to drink Belgian beers outside of their own land."
"Pours a dark brown color with an off white collar. Aroma is very malty, with notes of dried dates, prunes and raisen all pulling through. In the taste, more dark fruits, a chocolatey maltyness and restrained bitterness. Very much in the dubbel vein, but alittle lighter in ABV. Dark fruits abound, with a caramelized, sugary maltyness. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewey. Overall, a tasty little beer, worth revisiting."
"jd"
"Malty with a hint of roast. Sometimes described as a scotch but less bitter than I would expect, quite smooth. Neither the sweetness nor the bitterness are overdone, striking a good balance."
"It is a creamy brew and goes down pretty easy."
"Finish is pleasant bitter and semi sweet coffee."
"D - very drinkable"
"Drinkability> darn drinkable. Couldn't wait to pair it with mussels... which I promptly then had to order and devour (even though I had just finished dinner)... Good stuff."
"D: Highly drinkable, flavorful and refreshing, maybe a little sweet on the finish, but I wouldn't mind having a few on these on a summer afternoon."
"D: Really good."
"This beer seems to be having an identity crisis and is too light in flavor for the pricetag. Perhaps would be a good stepping stone into the realm of Belgian Dark Ales."
"F: Still lightly sweet with brown sugar, some rich porter, malts, and bitterness lingering. The spiciness really lingers with it. What IS that?!"
"Watch out for that last bit of yeast in the bottle. It's harsh."
"Overall this is far from being undrinkable but it seems to be missing a certain refinement."
"For me it was a one time deal."
"Hey, It would make a good slogan!"
"The body is medium with the finish sharp, crisp and spicy. Solid brew all the way around, but just a bit woody by bottle end."
"Pours brown with virtually no head. Nose is soft with brown sugar, baked desserts, and maybe some ginger & vanilla. Palate is in line with the nose, rather sweet with brown sugar and baked goods again. Body is disappointingly thin and finish is rather muted."
"Notes from 6/20/06"
"Though I was a bit disappointed in it at first (I had incredibly high expectations I had after trying other Kerkom brews), this is a pretty decent, drinkable bruin ale."
"Bink bruin pours a deep mahogany brown color with bright highlights and rim shine. It sports a small off white head that dissipates quickly and leaves patches while it thins out. The nose is classic Belgian dubbel, sweet chocolate and caramel malt, subtle notes of roasted coffee, cream and cherry. Its flavor is rich and smooth, big chocolate and toasted malts, brown sugar, slight Belgian spice/yeast and maple syrup. It has a nice medium body that thickens slightly as it warms, very bright carbonation like root beer. A very nice beer, very drinkable."
"Not bad, but nothing above and beyond..."
"Picked this brew up the other day and thought I would give it a try. It poured to a deep brown color with a smallish medium colored tan head which had very slight retention and no real lacing, only a slight sheen at the top of the glass. Nose has a nice malt scent with some fruit highlights and a slight alcohol like aroma. Also some sour aromas come out which seem to go together quite nicely with the malt. The taste is also quite nice, not as complex as I would have thought. Nice malt flavors with a slight sourness that is so ever light. As the brew warms a slight alcohol flavor comes out mixed with some dark fruit like cherries. This is a pretty good brew, I guess I was expecting it to have a little more to it but it is a very easy drinking brew and seems to get a little better as it warms closer to room temp. Overall this is a nice brew, one I would get again."
"I have to echo the sentiments of the last reviewer, this beer is very one dimensional, with that dimension being malt sweetness. There's enough Belgian yeast character present to make it clear that you're not drinking an American brew but beyond that not much to speak of. More carbonation in my bottle at least would've improved the mouthfeel a lot."
"A good beer, but nothing special. The beer is drinkable enough, though the beer sheet at Casey's indicated the abv. is 7.5%, rather then the 5.5% noted in this review. Not that I'm an expert, but based on what I tasted tonight, the 7.5% seems more likely."
"Pours a clean clear brown, a slight head with almost no carbonation. Aroma is slightly sweet, lightly roasty chocolate. Flavor continues with a more pronounced hop bite, as suggested on the label ""[the brewer] has determined single handedly to bring real hops back into Belgian brewing"". Not that I knew this was a problem, but OK. For me, these dark ales are more about malt and yeast and complex flavors derived therein, not hops. It's decent enough, but does not really interest me."
"Drinkability- This is just a boring bland ass beer. Nothing bad, but nothing worth sampling again."
"Would I have another if I come across it somewhere? Yes, but I won't pay for it."
"This is a highly drinkable brown from a brewery that seems to produce very good drinkable beers. I would definitely recommend a try on this one and I would buy it again in quantity to keep on hand."
"Overall: A good but unremarkable dark ale. The cherry-infused nose is the best part, and the flavor is good but seems to become quickly muddled. Worth a try."
"With this brew, a beautiful thick head sits atop a slightly reddish, dark and hazy brown liquid. The aroma is intensely chocolate and very malty. Theres just a little fruit and yeast in the smell, and its otherwise very clean. The taste is sweet, with a little caramel and moderately roasted malts coming through, in addition to the chocolate flavor. The beer is a little chalky and grainy in the mouthfeel, but is otherwise full and satisfying. This is a good Belgian brew that spotlights the roasted malts."
"Poured dark mahogany with miniscule tan head, light lace. Smells of roasted caramel malt and nuts with undercurrents of toasted bread, somewhat bitter oak and vanilla. Rich caramel and toasted marshmallow in the mouth. Develops nutty notes in the center. Finishes very cleanly, leaving pleasant mouth-coating roasted malts and vanilla behind. Nice balance of carbonation and creaminess in the mouth. Very good!"
"I drank it with a blue cheese pasta dish which acompanied it very well, though I tasted it and took notes before eating the pasta. The cheese dulled the bitterness, and made me percieve this beer as slightly sweeter which I personaly prefered."
"Aroma is a collage of sweet fruits and malts. Cloudy brown with a large (two fingers thick) but mostly fading head. Flavor is very malty in the fore with some almost chalky peanut skin flavors int he middle. Quite nutty flavors are present in fact with a perfect compliment of darker fruits like raisins and especially dates. I found it to be quite flavorful and appealing if just a bit narrow in the flavor range."
"D: Should have broad appeal, easy/pleasant drinker."
"Drinkability: Good in a pinch but there are far better examples of the style out there"
"small, slender bottle, consume before dating notched onto the label. Pours murky/cloudy dark brown with a minimal off white head and some sediment on the bottom of the glass.. Average lacing, faint nose is yeasty/bready. this is an understated brown ale, chalky notes of juniper,spicy caramel, roasted nuts and more yeast. Interesting brew, worth a try for Belgian lovers."
"Pours out fine with a yellowbrown head and beer has a deepbrown almost black color with bordeauxred shine from lights. Head not too stable and soon dissappeared. Nose is very caramellic, sweet, roasty and just litle citrussyfruit from hops and yeast. Taste is burnt, sweet caramellic malty and a bitter aftertaste in wich hops and roast dominate. Mouthfeel is full, creamy and inviting to take antother sip too please your tastingpupils. Good beer that I'll drink again!"
"Bottle: Poured an hazy dirty brown looking ale with a medium head with average retention. Aroma is a mix between Belgian yeast and some malt. Taste is lighter then expected with again the Belgian yeast dominating that one with some enjoyable floral aspect. A bit disappointing or maybe just a middle of the pack Belgian Ale but nothing to write home about."
"Pours a murky brown with a decent head that leaves a trace amount of lace,nice spicey,clovey aroma with some molasses and orange in there as well very eye opening.Molassis is the dominant flavor I pick up up front with a little spiciness finishing with a little dried cherry but pretty abrupt.Like others who have reviewed this one I think its not to complex very straight forward but drinkable but I likely wont seek it out again."
"I wasn't overly thrilled with Bink Blond and Bruin is a lesser beer in my eyes. I'm beginning to realize that there are scads of great Belgian beers out there. Sadly, this one can't be counted among them."
"Bink Bruin was opaque brown with a 1/2 head with no lace. The aroma was pretty busy - yeasty, grassy at first, then sweeter with elements of molasses and caramel as it warmed. The taste was smooth with some fruitiness to it as well as traces of molasses and a decent bite. The finish was dry, yeasty, and chalky. A pretty good Belgian for people such as myself whose palates aren't attuned to the subtleties of many Belgian beers."
"Drinkability  This is a good BDA thats on the fringe. Its simple and lacks the complexity of other examples of the style but is very direct and a solid drinker."
"33 cl bottle dated best before 2/2006. Pours a clouded chestnut brown color with a generous beige head that lasts into the puffy foam stages. Mild earthy, peaty notes, dark, caramelly malt, hints of cocoa, and grain-like smells, like wheat stalks in the aroma. The yeast imparts a mild raisiny fruitiness. Overall impression on first sip is that it's thin, but it certainly doesn't lack character. Chocolate covered raisins and caramel notes in the malt, very sparse hopping, but a small leafy dryness shows up in the finish. It has some similar yeast qualities to the Winterkoninkske, I'm just wondering if it's part of a signature style of theirs, from a unique yeast strain. I'll find out soon enough, because the Blond and Bloesem are in my posession as well, awaiting imbibement. This is a nice gem of a beer, low ABV, yet chock full o' goodness."
"Dark chestnut brown with a tall tan head that gently falls. It smells sweet and enticing, but I can't entirely work it out aside from the raisins. Rich raisin and caramel sweetness, that's also vinous. It seems stronger than it really is. (like Ebulum) As it warms up, it gets much more interesting, with vanilla and hazelnut highlights. It puts me in mind of a scaled-down Benevolence."
"Bink is a style of its own. Maybe a cross breed of Brown Ale, Trappist and Hefe-Weizen?"
"At 3.49 I would pick anything else. This beer is either mislabeled or doesn't travel well or both."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"Flavor gets richer, fuller, tastier, thicker as it develops...put this one in the ""plus file", fellers."
"Pours with a thick, pale brown two-fingered head, fades very slowly but leaves hardly any lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Color is a cloudy amber. Nose is raisiny and overall flavor is raisiny with a hint of hops. Pricey, $4.30 for a 330ml bottle."
"Carefully poured off of its solid sediment its a clear, deep mahogany brown with chestnut highlights beneath a full, creamy head of light tan foam that holds quite well but leaves only spotty lace. The nose is limited but complex in its combination of yeast and malts with varying notes of sublime cocoa, a dark fruitiness (raisins, berries), a subtle spiciness, and wet wood. It's medium-light and just lightly crisp in the mouth with a very fine and natural moderate carbonation. The taste follows the aroma but follows a tighter path with some dark and lightly sugary malt flavors and a subtle acidity but no fruitiness; and there are some grassy hops that appear although they're not found in the aroma. Undertones of smokey roastiness and black licorice are present as well, but never manifest themselves. It finishes semi-dry with some lingering, mild dark malt and a yeastiness without fruit."
"If anyone can figure out the cryptic number system on the bottle that I assume is some freshness, best before, or best after dating system please let me know."
" Postscript: I tried another and liked it less than the first. I took it down a peg in Drinkability because I just wouldnt seek it out again. Worth trying tho."
"Notes: A tasty little Bruin, delicate and somewhat flavourful with shaded complexities. A pumpernickel and smoked ham sandwich would be an ideal pairing."
"Dark brown colour (like coca-cola...), with a beige and creamy foam, almost as a stout. Smell sweet of sugar (like candy floss), quite sickly. Taste of caramel, but with a commendable contrast between sweet and bitter (hop and chicory). Body medium-low."
