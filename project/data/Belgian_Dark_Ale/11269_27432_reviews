"Overall: I might actually prefer this to the much higher acclaimed Tripel. This beer was very much to-style and was fantastically brewed. This one tastes a lot like Trois Pistoles."

"O - An average Dark Ale, at best. I'd probably give this another try, but if there's a sour on-tap, I'm going for that."
"0 – Another nice brew from Brugge. Not my personal favorite from them, but I liked it for a style that I am always hit or miss on."

"Poured near black with a good off-white/light tan head and some good lacing. The nice brought a bit of yeast plus a large amount of roasted malt. The flavor was mostly all roast with some light dark-fruit character. Interesting, but not all that enjoyable. There was some creaminess to the feel, though mostly dry roast. Overall, this was far too dominated by bitter roasted malt."
"Not bad at all, and definitely a Belgian-style brew with character."
"Overall this seemed to be infected but even through the off-flavors it seemed to be a one-dimensional beer."
"D: what do you do when you have a 750ml and a mediocre beer? Pour it..."
"Drinks very well-smooth with no over-powering booze flavor."
"I had this in Broad Ripple, Indiana. This was served black with a thin white head that fizzled down to a white lace around the glass. It smells of hints of fruit and roasted malts. Tastes slightly roasted and hints of chocolate and fruit. Very drinkable."
"Dark brown with rosewood highlights and a dark sand colored head that settles nicely to a dense fizz leaving sliding lace on the glass. The nose is nice and complex, dark fruit and chocolate with oaky vanilla and just a whiff of something like olive brine. Nice roasted maltiness with semisweet chocolate, belgian yeast and raisin with a charred bitterness in the finish. Chalky, medium mouthfeel. A fine ale."
"Not ""lazy"" to add same yeast to a different grain bill but the yeast could perhaps get more out of a deeper malt profile. this one is sweet with a bitterness but lacking in midrange roasting depth: caramel? Even a little lager character (vienna, munich...mmm) would go a long way. Touch of blackcurrant at the finish"
"M/D - Medium bodied with a very vigorous carbonation. Very lively on the tongue. Overall a good feel but the taste just is not very good which bring the drinkability down a few notches."
"The body is limited. A bit wispy and limited in the finish. The carbonation is limited as well. Overall a beer that doesn't quite fit style, but overall would like a bit more depth."
"Tastes as it smells. Medium strength blend Belgian flavors cohering into something akin to a fruit and bread basket with earthen undertones. Not quite the full package that I look for in a nice, solid Belgian, but for a midwestern attempt a Belgian it's pretty good."
"Pours a very dark brown color, not quite black, but very dark, it's very hard to tell the difference once it's in a glass - but as you pour the color is easier to judge. The head is incredibly big, I mean 3 inches or so, and very fluffy, cavernous, rocky, kindof a tan color. It moves around, collapses a bit, really looks nice. The smell has a bit of easters, kind of some dark fruits - plums, cherries, etc, maybe a tiny bit of tartness. Then there's a nice chocolatey smell, mixed in with a tiny bit of grassiness. Overall though, the smell kind of lacks the depth that the taste has - but the smell is still pretty good. When I taste it, I first get this creamy, chocolate syrup kind of taste. Really nice, but that sort of fades back into a kind of deep, leafy, earthy tobacco flavor. There a nice caramelly flavor, like cola, but it's missing some roastiness. I'm pretty sure there's something other than malted barley in here, just from the taste. There are so many different bready, grainy flavors in here - though it kind of lacks a bready density. The cocoa returns in the finish. The body I think meets my expectation, but I wish it were fuller. The carbonation is a little prickly too, and the rush of bubbles makes the slightly thin body a bit more obvious. Still, I think it fits the style to some degree. This is an enjoyable beer - lots of depth, but nothing offensive. The carbonation slowed me down a bit, but I enjoyed drinking it. I think the ABV here might slow me down in a bit, but at this point everything is going smoothly. Definitely a nice belgian dark - a bit more body would really make this impressive."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. It smells like dark fruit (grapes, plums, raisins), bittersweet chocolate, and a bit of sour apple. The taste is similar to the aroma. There's bittersweet chocolate, bread, dark fruit, yeast, and tart apples that are noticable in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and very easy to drink. I think this is a good brew, I liked it. This is the first Brugge beer I've tried, and I'll definitely have to try their other ones now."
"MF&D - I have never had a world class belgian dark ale, but I do not imagine that it would be this carbonated, though I can imagine the body being about this thickness."
"I am a big fan of Brugge, but overall I was disappointed with this. It's a decent beer that is complex enough I would be willing to try again."
"Much more sour than expected from a Belgian dark."
"Two fingers of even tan foam head has nice retention leaving almost no lace as it slowly fades. Body holds very true to the beers name and is a stout like blackness. Bose shows a evident use of a yeast strain with a Belgian feel. Some mineral based malt and dark fruit are on the nose also. A big dose of yeasty, bready darkness enters the mouth with first sip. There is a slight hint of tartness that rides on the back of a dry consistant bitter feel that carries this brew. This is a very pleasant and unique combination. Adds a crispness to the mouthfeel while having a nice dry bitter darkness throughout. Super smooth and oh so easy to drink. I would guess the alchol to be around 6 or 7%. This brew is much better on tap I must say."
"Just didn't do it for me."
"Draft in snifter at brewpub. Poured hazy brown color with an average fizzy off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate toasted sweet malty and small alcohol aroma. Medium body with a slick texture. Medium spicy sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Complex drinkable brew."
"Really disappointed with this one - I just couldn't get over that weird ashy taste. At least I got this badass bottle."
"M/D - Surprisingly light bodied and some carbonation. I've had this on tap before and it was much better than in the bottle."
"Head went away pretty quick like the trippel de ripple. Flavor was rather sour but really good and refreshing for this type of brew. Rather light bodied but not bad, I also tried this one on tap at Shallos. A good beer you should try one one for size."
"Goes well with Beck: Odelay for music."
"D= Not a bad black ale, just not all that it could be. Could serve as a gateway beer into sour ales though..."
"This beer had a nice dark body, but with little head and little lacing. It had a very sweet/malty aroma with chocolate hints. The taste was great! It had a nice malt/hop balance, with a wonderful smoky flavor and tastes of chocolate and vanilla in the finish. It's a little rough but goes down fine."
"Overall, very unique, and very enjoyable. But one glass is all I could drink in a sitting."
"Was very light-bodied in the mouthfeel, which added to the drinkability with the ineresting flavors. Great brew. If I didn't have to drive to the other side of town, I could see myself having several"
"A very well balanced black beer. Sweet and not hoppy. I was expecting more of a certain hop or barley but it was smooth and drinkable for anyone. Pretty powerful stuff that is very drinkable. Watch out! I highly recommend Brugge Brasserie to anyone on a brewpub/gastropub hunt in indianapolis."
"A good beer. Enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thin, but this really just makes it go down even quicker. Very drinkable. This one tastes and feels more like a lager than an ale, at least to me. I like it a lot."
"Surprized to find this on tap at Fiddler's Hearth in South Bend last night. I didn't even know Brugge shipped their beer anywhere. Poured into an imperial pint, not much of a head, opaque and murky brown. Smelled of belgian spices, dark fruits, brown sugar. Flavor was malty, sweet and with a bit of ethanol. plums and bananas swimming around in the background. Nice body, good for the style. Hits you harder than you expect it to."
"I would recommend this beer, and I would highly recommend Brugge Brasserie."
"D- This beer had a pretty soft smell and a thin flavor that was a bit underwhelming. The flavors that were there were nice but it didn’t have much depth or character."
"D - This is my go-to beer at the Brugge if they're out of the tripel. A showcase of Ted's talent."
"Finishes strongly on licorice characteristics and a smooth sensuous candied darkness. Damned good."
"Drinkability was excellent. Indy folks are lucky with this new brewpub."
"Served in a large snifter-type glass. Love the proper glassware at Brugge! Pitch black, no highlights at, simply black. Thick tan head on top stands for quite some time, leaving behind some great patterns of lace. Nose is spicy, licorice and yeasty. Sweet canid sugar flavor combined with licorice, cocoa and a hint of coffee. Finishes sweet. This beer became even more wonderful as it warmed and the coffee/chocolate flavors come out. Medium body, carbonation fairly low makes this even better. Solid!"
"Last swigs: Black is a meld of many but falls short of something. If this went in a direction of coffee or roasty or anise, then this would be impressive. Otherwise, it reminds me of a beer on the doorstep of Fantôme."
