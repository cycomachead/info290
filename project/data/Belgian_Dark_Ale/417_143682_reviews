"I liked this better on tap. It was much fruitier and had a nice herbal earthy profile. Kind of floral. Going to age a few bottles and revisit later on."
""
"Looks like an Amber. Smells fresh, bright, like floral spring time. Dried fruit, a little salty, coriander, a little citrus zest. This was the best of my sampler pack."
"Just OK.  Probably wouldn't buy a case."

"The spice is enough to keep balance without overwhelming.  A nice stab at a ""Belgian"" style brew, though it wouldn't rank with the classics, it is an enjoyable winter sipper!"

"Overall The bitter orange peel flavor and bitter linger takes away from the enjoyment of this brew. Still for a buck a bottle nothing wrong with knocking back a12 pack of this baby. I Enjoy the snowstorm series from Schells."

"Snowstorm pours a dark amber color with a small lacing head.  There is a very nice spicy aroma, big hints of dark spices, and dry fruits.  The taste is the same, big spice bill, lots of dry fruit.  Body a a tad weak, but nice body.  Overall very spicy, very flavorful."

"Overall:  I like to try the Schell Snowstorm each year even when it might be a style that I don't prefer.  This year's version reminds me of a dubbel, but it looks like I enjoyed it more than Snowstorm 2007 which was actually called a dubbel.  Fruity and earthy but more breadiness than most dubbels per my senses."

"Overall:  this is another winner, as have been the past two years of Snowstorms...for the price, I doubt it can be beat."

"Medium bodied, smooth, easy to drink, with proper carbonation. This is another very nice Snowstorm beer from Schell's. I should definitely drink more of their beers than I do. They brew great beers, and the prices are always reasonable."

"Overall, a really nice take on a Belgian ale, especially for the price. Well done."
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a Belgian ale. Seems more like a Belgian Pale Ale than a Cru. Nice mix of spices and fruit esters."
"Overall: Nice, easy drinking Belgian Ale. I would rather they went the full Noel route and made this 9%+, but still enjoyable."

"Altogether it's reminiscent of the better aspects of several past Snowstorms and one of the Stag Series offerings.  Will probably go great with Thanksgiving turkey this year. ;)"

"This is really complex.  Seems to match several of the latest Snowstorms in moderate alcohol drinks that take time to get to know and enjoy most fully.  As with the previous ones I'm sure I'll get to know this one better and in time our friendship will grow - maybe that's what they mean by ""great growth"" (literal translation of Grand Cru).   Or maybe it's just a special seasonal beer.  Either way, another Snowstorm to enjoy.  I'm glad it's here."
