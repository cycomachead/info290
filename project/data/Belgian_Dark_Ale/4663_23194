Aroma has tart fruit with big funky yeast notes, hints of citrus and Christmas spices. Santa is on the label looking pretty deviant without a beard, maybe it's one of the brewers at La Rulles. A deep fruit note pretty non descriptive flavor, big malts, mild spicy yeast notes leaves a dry semi sweet finish. Dark leather notes, medicinal cherry, earthy sprigs from pine trees or oak birch accents, what a beer. The type of Belgian ale only a mother could love big overpowering and a bit of a bully this has no finesse compared to some of my favorite ales out there. Overall I'm waiting to try something excellent in comparison, to this dumbed down and non accentuated notes that I've come to know and adore.","WVbeergeek","Nov 13, 2013"

Aroma of dark and sweet malt, dark fruits, somewhat subdued. Flavor follows with sweet malt, dark and light fruit, Belgian spicing, brown sugar. A bit of dryness in the finish, but overall sweet. Moderate body and moderately complex. A pleasant, but not outstanding dark Belgian.","LiquidAmber","Feb 03, 2012"
3.7,-2.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured at Rustico's in a sampler glass. Pours a dark reddish amber along with an average tan head that left nice lacing throughout. The aroma was moderate to heavy caramel and dark candy sugar; moderate to heavy yeast, with some slight Christmas-like spices in the yeast at the end; grape, apple, cherry, brown sugar, lots of slightly sour fruit; and slight alcohol heat. The initial flavor was moderately to rather sweet, slightly acidic and ever so slightly bitter; while the finish was somewhat to moderately sweet, slightly bitter and slightly sour. There was caramel, brown sugar, dark candy sugar, dusty yeast, slightly sour fruit that grows in intensity as it warms, cherry, apple, grape, hints of cocoa, and a little spicy yeast at the end. The light to medium body was sort of creamy, but sticky on the lips and then a little dry with fizzy carbonation and a slightly astringent and a lightly dry finish. Overall an interesting beer.","CuriousMonk","Jan 17, 2012"

The roasted malt caught me a bit off guard, but works well here. Notes of caramelized sugar and dark breads. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, smooth, with ample carbonation. Overall, a nice Belgian Dark ale, dig the roasted malt in a Belgian.","Stinkypuss","Jan 14, 2012"

Nose is all malt, gentle spicing. Very soft and inviting, minimal as I'm struggling to describe it, but really entices me to pull it to my mouth. Unfortunately, the taste is step down from the nose. Some yeast, a gentle sugary malt, some alcohol and light spicing. Really nice feel however as I've found most Belgians to be. Carbonation is moderate and there's some lingering Belgian yeast. Real pleasant.","liamt07","Mar 01, 2011"

4.11,7.9,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: easy drinking for the style, as lower alcohol levels and nice sweetness are easy on the tastebuds. Seek this out.","Gavage","Dec 27, 2005"
3.88,1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer was served into a tulip glass and come out with a nice deep brown body with a little tan head trailing it. The beer has a nice roasted malt aroma to it with a touch of maybe caramel as well. The taste has a nice balance of the bitter hop taste which I love and a little sweetness that backs up the hops. There is a bit of carbonation but not overdone. I enjoyed letting the beer sit a bit and warm up in my glass. A nice treat on a cold night.","ggaughan","Dec 14, 2005"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Got this on tap at the Old Bay in New Brunswick, NJ. On the menu it says one of only two bars in the country that have this on tap but im not too sure how acurate that is but anyhow. Poured into an oversized wine glass a copper color with a minimal white head. The smell was somewhat fuity with some roasted malts. Taste is a little hoppy somewhat sweet as well. A little spicy but not much. Alcohol is somewhat present but doesn't take control. Drinkability is ok because the ABV isn't that high.","thetachibro","Dec 11, 2005"
3.96,3.9,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Served on tap at Grand Cru in Baltimore, poured into a Chimay goblet. This is a deep burgany brown which takes on some purplish hues when held up to the light, solid beige cap of head, some delicate lacing. Nose is a slight roasted malt with a caramel note and some slight apple fruitiness. Taste is a nice smooth malt, some mild chocolate and caramel notes, a touch of spices and a decently bitter finish. Very nice delicate flavors in this one, as it warms some light fruitiness starts to come through. Medium bodied with a very fine creamy carbonation, this is a very pleasant sipping beer. This is a very nice little offering, good complexity for such a light beer, very tasty and fun to drink.","cubedbee","Apr 15, 2005"
4.27,12.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"BB sept 08; alcohol listed as 7.3. Nice head that lasts very well and beautifull darkbrown/ almost black beercollor without any haze also. Nose is green spicy and roasted, nicely caramellic and very tempting. Freshness goes on in the taste that's heavy and sweet with good bitter and roasty ending. Well balanced but mainly roastyness and bitterness with good malty sweetness. Not much carbonisation fits the brew and IMO a good extra stout. Very well drinkable and certainly wort seeking for if you like it bitter sweet and burnt.","paterlodie","Beers"
3.78,-0.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Overall: Definitely a Winter-Xmas Brune of sorts, but at 6.5% it is nothing overwhelming and makes for an easy-going Seasonal Session Brune of sorts. Retains the artisanale rural character & rustic character that is evident in both the Blonde and [standard] Brune. I only have the one bottle, but it would be interesting to see how this bottled-conditioned brew ages given the Best Before Date some 3 years hence.","TheLongBeachBum","0"
