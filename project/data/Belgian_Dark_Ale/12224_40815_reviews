"Oddly reddish brown in color with a murky complexion.  There's a trace of beige head mostly present around the rim of the glass and barely elsewhere.  The aroma is rather off putting with loads of malt and alcohol.  The flavor is packed with loads of malt and the alcohol is detectable.  The mouth is sticky and chewy."

"A little too sweet upfront and a lingering aftertaste.  But not terrible and very strong.  I'd have it again."

"Could be a really nice beer, but that metallic/tangy character kills it."

"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with honey and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable and not all that bad for what it is."
"Clear amber pour with a dark ruby hue. Weak head and lacing. The nose is of malt against a strong alcohol background. Medium body with a smooth texture. Low carbonation level. The flavor profile is two dimensional - caramel malt sweetness over a strong alcohol background. The hop level is so low it's almost undetectable. As it warms, and the palate becomes accustomed to the alcohol, the sweetness comes forward. On the finish, it flows from sweetness to an alcoholic aftertaste. A good, but not great, beer. More hops and dark malt would improve this one a great deal."

"It is the best Beer I ever tried. The only problem it is hard to find it in Boston area. I agree that it would be useful to have expiration date. But based on my experience in our local store Winchester Wine and Spirits (Winchester, MA) you should buy all what you see. I remember they got 20 bottles and I (how stupide of me) bought only six. I came next Saturday and they were already sold out. Now I have to wait till they get another shipment."

"Not very drinkable. A waste at any price."

"Overall - If not for the alcohol bite, I would probably like this very much."
"Not so good. I found all of these Lithuanian beers at a really low price so I had to pick them up, but none of theme have been anything special. They are all REALLY high ABV too."
""
"O - I have realized over time that this company makes a lot of coin off high alcohol content beers. Maybe the fact that I was paying three bucks should have tipped me off and although this isn't worse than Before After, it's still extremely difficult to get through a bottle."
""
"O - There are few beers that I refuse to finish until it warms, otherwise it is unbearable."
""
"-Overall 3.5: This beer sat in the cool temperature of my basement for over a year before I tried it, so that may explain why my review is so wildly different from others. It is my opinion that this beer is refreshing and has a depth of flavor and aroma that sets it apart from many other beers. I never tasted the high alcohol content; everything was smooth and enjoyable. I did, however, notice a large amount of sediment on the bottom which is a result of the beer aging in the bottle."
"Pours a medium amber color with almost no carbonation and absolutely no lacing. Smells like what you would imagine an artificial lager syrup smelling like. Incredibly sweet and malty with a lot of cheap alcohol. Leaves a metallic aftertaste. Overall about on the equivalent of any generic malt liquor in the States. Absolutely nothing about this is Belgian in style. Drinkable, but only for a purpose other than enjoyment."
"Overall: Listen for under four bucks this beer was a steal, I have paid more for much crappier Belgian style beers and this will leave you with a smile. I hope you enjoy and appreciate it as much as I have. Salud!"

"O- A Belgian Dark Ale? Meh, I guess. Not really sure what the brewery was trying to accomplish with this one. I have another bottle which of course I will drink."
"very light amber color with no visible head upon pouring. The beer had absolutely no ribboning. It was very sweet. Overall not a horrible brew but not one of the best either. The bottle appearance is unique with the half wolf label. The high alcohol content is a nice feature."
"Overall this is a big bottle full of crap. There is nothing to recommend this beer at all. AVOID!"
""
""
"Overall â€“ very interesting and thought provoking taste, which in itself is also pretty good. Good brew overall!"
"Overall: Not sure what to call this. There is nothing Belgian about this, so it may be mis-categorized. It is strong ale, but if anything it most closely resembles an English Barleywine. Interesting, and not without its charms."
"O: A great beer for October, but make sure to inhale as you drink, as over half of the flavor comes in through the nose."
"Very sweet beer, interesting in character."
"O - Overall, really didnt care for this beer at all. So many, hell, ""average"" examples of this style, not this junk. Still, go Lithuania!"
"Appearance is very red, smelled of maple syrup, the taste was overly sweet with fruit. it was slightly acidic . It didn't seem like it was high in alcohol but it gave me a headache after drinking half of the bottle. Very bad to average beer, I will never try this beer again period."
"Not a bad beer, can't taste the alcohol much. Was disapointed on the suds, not much abd they faded quick. Color is very red, and you can see through it but its kinda foggy though no sediment. Tastes very fruity, tangy, a little different then some beers- tasts of possibly sour apples. Medium thickness on the mouth feel, leaves you a little tart."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a pretty brownish amber color with a small head. Smell is of alcohol, some fruits. Taste is alcohol up front, some fruits and malts, not overly flavorful. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall a decent brew but nothing great."
"No. Can't see myself trying to drink this one again."
"Drinkability: Slightly better than the aforementioned brew, but not good enough to recommend to anyone. Sorry I wasted the money on this one, but now I know."
"Taste is much better but not enough to save it. It is spicey-sweet fruit juice, raisin, a hint of toast and cheap brandy. It is lightly sweet with hint of faint spicey bitterness underneath. It is simple but tastes reasonably good but in the end is mostly fermented, alcoholic fruit juice and fails to maintain any interest in the face of the off-putting aroma. It is also very heavy for what you get. Drinkability thus fades fast."
"A true oddity, or maybe a new strain of Belgian beer yeast mixed with Lithuanian rocket fuel. It seems clean enough, so maybe the brewers meant for it to taste like this."
"Refreshing and drinkable, but a bit on the sweet side. Not one i'd really revisit, but it was ok. Not sure what style this is like most here, quite a unique brew."
"Overall, the main reason to drink this beer is to say you drank a beer called Werewolf. And not only that, it has a rather high ABV% @ 8.2%. So you won't be having to toss down that many to get your howl on. Damn...I think they should hire me for their marketing department. - Don't be afraid to get bit by this werewolf. - I hear drinking Coors Light (Silver Bullet) after drinking Werewolf can kill you."
"D: Despite the generally unimpressive characteristics, this is a beer that is easy to drink. The unsettling aromas disappear quickly with the head, and the flavor, while forgettable, is not offensive. Overall, while I wouldn't buy this beer again, it is easy enough to drink that I will still enjoy it. (3.5)"
"Overall a weird malty beer that is quite repulsive. It was quite cheap but it is still quite nasty. I might be able to finish this but it will be a struggle."
"drinkability is ok the flavors are decent i just wish there was more carbonation"
"My expectations weren't high, but this limboed right under them nonetheless. Not great, for sure -- any time the words ""synthetic"" and ""mess"" appear in a review, you know it's not good."
"Overall, at $2.50 for 16oz, I got my money out of it."
"I knew it wouldn't be any good based on it's origin. I should have trusted my instincts and avoided the beast."
"Overall, I'm shocked at how much I enjoyed this beer. I will definitely be purchasing more of this beer."
"The brew had a sweet scent, with a noticeable alcohol aroma. The beer had a flavor of caramel and alcohol. The body was thin and sticky. Drinkabilty was OK, but I might have to try it again to get a handle on it. Overall, not a bad beer, just different than most any other beer I've tried. Certainly worth a shot if you see it."
"I think this loses points in some score because no one really knows how to classify it and it seems some people want more alcohol in the flavor. I think well-masked is a good thing, and I;ve certainly had worse than this. It's an above-average brew."
"D: Just okay, not a favorite of mine."
"Reddish orange body topped by a moderate head of cream foam comprises of a balanced mix of fine and coarse bubbles. Aroma - not much there, but what is present reminds me of a slight buttermilk note. Flavor is mostly malt up front with some dark fruit - exactly what I'd expect from this type of beer just a little restrained. Tastes remarkably like a lighter flavored Corsendonk Christmas Ale. A slight medicinal bitterness gradually arises as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is very good with a slight silkiness that is lifted from the palate by the fine carbonation. Drinkability is OK. There are too many really good beers to have this one very often. But hey - how many Lithuanian beers are you going to find in the states? I'd love to taste this in its home country - I can only imagine the abuse it has taken before getting to me via a store in TN."
"If you are a fan of high alcohol sugar bombs this one's for you. I could not even finish a glass."
"Overall, this isn't very taste but I can't believe its got 8.2% abv. You wouldn't think it for a second. If you just want to drink something watery and get cracked this is the beer for you."
"Eh, Not expecting too much out of this one, since I design things for a living, the label was pretty corny so I was not expecting it to be a great brew. Overall it hid the 8.5% alchohol well, don't think I am going to be buying this one again. Not horrible, okay beer for just drinking maybe a good dry dish would be good."
"Drink okay, the ABV is well hidden, but this just not that good a beer or a representation of the style. I am happy that I had a better experience than some prior reviewers, beware the Werewolf!!"
"Drain-pour."
"This is actually quite smooth and pleasant to drink. Figs, raisins, brown sugar, caramel and burnt toast come to mind. By far the best beer I have had from the Baltic nations. It is a bit thin and not overly complex, but it is not lacking in flavors and the 8.2% is well hidden. As is warms though, it does get a bit rougher around the edges and mildly boozy. I am thinking this bottle probably has about a year of age on it and seems to have done it some good, however it does not taste like it would age for more than a couple. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and would buy it again, for sure."
"Pours a cream, three-finger head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Almost clear red/amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is caramel and toffee. Higher ABV is hidden. $4.50 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Actually the beer tastes like someone took a Quad and mixed it with a skunked and crappy Pilsner."
"Honey amber with a fine patchy white head that leaves fine lace behind. Bubblegum, toffee and fusel alcohol. Sweet and malty with an herbal hop twang that lingers in the mouth. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation, finishes hot. While it doesn't measure up to the style (are we sure this is a Belgian style ale?) it is unique. Worth a try."
"taste is thick, dry, tart, sour, malt, grain, some citrus, and some caramel, ends dry and somewhat bitter."
"The mouthfeel is typically medium and the taste is outrageously sweet! It was like drinking caramel swirl ice cream. If you like it sweet you will probably like this. But if you are a hops or alcohol fan you might find it a bit too much to bear."
"With the high alcohol content and flat taste, I don't see this being much for a session. I might drink this again if I were strapped for cash (only $2 for the 1.09 pint bottle) but otherwise I'd steer clear of it."
"drinkability: Never again."
"I'm not sure I would classify this as a Belgian Dark... There is a sweet malt characteristic however the appearance is more of a strong ale and the taste profile is more of a Lager."
"Nikki"
"Ok, so I went to Maine and found this oddity from LITHUANIA (!?) and had to buy one. Out of the bottle this ""Belgian Style Dark Ale"" was a murky amber color with a frothy tan head. Moderate retention and some les than impressive lacing. The aroma was musty malt, slightly stale hop bitterness and hints of sweetness in the alcohol esters. The flavors started a little on the musty barley side, this then gave way to sweeter flavors of caramel malt but these too were a little odd. The aftertaste however was distinctly unpleasant, like tannins in wine - twiggy. The body was medium and watery, the carbonation too soft and as it warmed up the alcohol came right through it. I have trouble classifying it as a Belgian Dark Ale and really would not recommend anyone try it even for the novelty. Too bad."
"This is very drinkable, keeping in mind the 8%abv. Not sure what the style is supposed to be, perhaps a Vienna lager? Lithuanian amber? I'll buy it again."
"T/M: All I get on the taste is a wave of caramelized malts with the smallest dash of earthy hops. This is a medium to full bodied beer with a heavy dosing of malts as the nose suggests. As the beer warms, I taste some apple cider, Belgian candied sugars and small qualities of tea. Light carbonation and almost watery in spots, yet syrupy in the middle (odd, I know). Overall, not a very common feeling mouthfeel - rather strange to my 'foreign' tongue. Not refreshing with the long wet finish pronounced by the lack of bitterness and dryness. Drinkable, yes - but not my cup of tea. The C+ rating given was a bit of a gift, because I've never had a beer from this country."
"Aroma is sharp and malty with an undertone of apple cider. Color is a clear light mahogany, and it pours with a somewhat thick head that sticks around. Flavor is rather sweet but not cloying and has an undertone of caramel and a hint of apple. Texture is smooth and crisp, and aftertaste has both cider-like sweetness and hoppy bitterness in it."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a huge rocky head. The aroma is malty and spicy. The malt is deep and inviting. The taste is sweet and smooth. The alcohol is well hidden. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would have liked. Overall, this is a highly drinkable brew....pleasantly surprised."
"snifter. slightly hazy amber color, orange to red. some sediment. slight off-white head. low retention and light lacing. sweet malty aroma, very barleywine-esque. some decent citrus hop aromas. big banana flavors with some clove. good amount of alcohol burn. sweet malts with tons of fruits. a little rough at 8%, but other than that it is a pretty good brew for Lithuania."
"The tagline for Werewolf is ""you must be sure you wanna taste it"". I wasn't sure at all and now I'm sorry I did. This is ghastly, flea-bitten, baying-at-the-moon beer. If you dare, make sure you've had your rabies shots."
"D- Drinkability for this is good for the style I believe, but also fairly strong in alcohol %. It hides the alcohol very well and after the first couple of sips is pretty good. I don't think it is a beer meant to be a session beer, but one to be savored. Worth a try."
"Okay to be honest,I bought this for the label...which is a picture of half a woman and half a wolf,and underneath it says ""You must be sure you wanna taste it.""They meant it.This Dark Ale(?)...I'm not sure if that is what it says 90% of the label is in Lithuanian I'm guessing,is just not for me.It is not horrible by any means,but it is not what I was hoping for either."
