"O- certainly not a stout, with more dark fruit than chocolate, still enjoyable though"

"This is a chocolate ale for those who like their chocolate dark and not very sweet.  None of the Hershey's milk chocolate effect here!  The chocolate is one element in a mix of roasty flavors, but the chocolate doesn't overwhelm the stout.  The beer is just a little tart, and has a bit of bitterness (like coffee bitterness, not the effect of hops).  This beer is not sweet at all.  Very tasty."

"2012 batch consumer in January 2014. Held up well. Cocoa bark, hints of clove, slight banana, still packs a lot of flavor. Nice."
"V - 22oz bomber, medium value."

"Bottled 09/2103. Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a very dark brown, almost black, opaque, with a nice three finger fluffy tan head. Great lacing. Aroma is chocolate up front, with some raisin, molasses, fig, and dark roasted malt notes. The taste was nearly identical to the smell, with great chocolate flavor and some nice almost sour yeast taste. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, very smooth, with a somewhat dry finish. Overall, this was quite a nice beer, next time I'd like to try one fresh to see how the aging treated this beer."

"Enjoyable chocolate stout, better than most versions of this style. A good choice to pair with dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Not sure if this is a dark ale or stout,  but I'm happy either way.   Got better as it warmed."
""
""
"Not a stout as the name would dictate, but a very tasty Belgian Dark Ale."
""
"Dark body that is about one shade under full black with a big tan head the builds and hangs around lacing the glass nice.  Really gorgeous beer.  Subdued smell with cocoa, dark malt, coffee and herbal notes.  Taste starts off sweet, some chat notes from the malt and some sweet dark fruit notes come through.  Chocolate makes a big appearance mid palate starting sweet and ending bitter with some herbal hop flavor and coffee.  Mouthfeel is medium body and medium carbonation which starts active on the palate and goes fully creamy with some slight dryness.  Overall I wasn't sure what to expect but this was an enjoyable beer that brought chocolate flavors with a good balance of sweet and bitter."

"This is an excellent chocolate stout, of which I usually keep a couple bottles around. The appearance is very appealing – large, creamy head and good lacing atop a deliciously dark brew, topped by the alluring aroma of chocolate. The flavor is chocolaty and delicious, with only the slight taste of alcohol detracting from the pleasure. Overall, a very exquisite brew."
""
""
""
"O: Not what I expected at all, but still an enjoyable beer. At the pricepoint, not sure if I'd get it again, but I'm not disappointed with the purchase."
"Overall, my first tastes of this beer cold from fridge were good. As it came to temp, the nose improved, but the taste actually started to weaken in my mind. This is a decent beer, but nothing great. I definitely wouldn't grab it if looking for a sweeter, dessert beer. But for a darker, Belgian style ale, it's worth a taste."
""
"Overall – The taste and look were quite nice –big and dark with a nice chocolate flavor, but the aroma and feel were just OK. Overall a nice beer to try, but not really worth the big bottle price of over $10."

"Poured from 750 ml corked bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 2/2/2014."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor gives up a nice blend of some choco, cocoa and mocha. This all gives a pleasant, light level of sweetness to this offering. Delving in a bit further, I get a bit of a funky, Belgian character. Bringing things to a close, there's some floral hop action in the very dry finish. Overall, not bad though I was expecting btter from Ommegang. Prosit!"

"I believe the year of age has made this bottle even better it was a delight to drink."

"Overall, decent beer, but a misleading one. When I read ""Chocolate Indulgence", I was expecting something on the lines of Samuel Smith's ""Organic Chocolate Stout"" or Rouge XS Imperial Chocolate stout, which are both absolutely loaded with intense chocolate flavor. Ommegang's simply hints at chocolate, and myself and seemingly many others wanted a bit more."
""
"Over. - There's just so much chocolate and cream. It's a great brew that I wasn't expecting much from."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap poured into a short tulip glass. The smell was faint of dark chocolate and hint of cream. The head was a thick cream colored 1 finger that holds for a short while. The taste isn't as chocolate as the name would lead you to believe. It was tasty with a mocha light dark chocolate hint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied but behaves like a bigger beer. It will not hurt you but it try's to scare you that it might be too much handle. It does have a reasonable drink-ability but does tend to challenge you at times. Overall, a great flavorful beer with great character."
""
""
""

"O - Decent but not memorable - could be due to the age, but where this beer falls short is the overly thin body."

"Stout? It is not a stout. Does not appear to be a stout. Does not smell like a stout. Feels okay enough to be a stout. Something is missing though... Oh right. The chocolate and stout part of the Chocolate Indulgence Stout. Only indulging in really okay non-stout"

"tough to call this one a stout, with only a medium body, minimal roasted barley bitterness or earthiness, and all the belgian yeast carbonating it so well and drying it up, but its a cool belgian dark ale with a subtle chocolate twist, nice for valentines or some other winter celebration of lovers or friends. heady frothy pour, hazy cocoa brown liquid bubbles profusely. a nose of belgian yeast, fruity esters, and bakers chocolate. an interesting combination, i dont get a lot of grain in this, and maybe it could use more meat on its bones. delicate flavor with the chocolate not being as prominent as the beers name suggests it might be. soft semisweet chocolate notes mix with fruity yeast, chocolate covered raisins come to mind. finish is light and clean, and 7% abv seems spot on for this. a cool bottle of beer, but i would have liked to see a bit more chocolate in the flavor, more indulgence. it is very well made though, and another example of ommegang doing things expertly well. unique and sensual beer worth a try this season."
"Overall, this probably isn't as chocolatey as some would hope or expect, but I think it's excellent. The ABV is hidden quite well."
""
""
"Decent beer, wish I would have split it with the girlie instead of trying to drink it all on my own."
"Overall: This is OK, I don't think that I will go after it again. It is a touch thin for my taste in a stout. Also with the name chocolate indulgence I expect a lot more chocolate flavor and aroma. I don't think that I'm going to be buying this one again."
"O: Ommegang knows what they're doing, and this beer is spot on with their description, but for the price it left me wanting to have a bigger flavor explosion in my mouth. I wouldn't go as far as to call it Chocolate Indulgence, maybe just Chocolate would do just fine."

"Overall: A pretty solid twist on a Belgian style dark ale. Good chocolate and coffee notes with a balanced sweetness and Belgian yeast presence."
""
""
""

"Poured from a cork and cage into a snifter, the beer is a dark black coloring with a tall, frothy, chunky, light tan head. Huge bubbling, with a very decent lacing left behind along the glass. Nose of not much, really, with subtle cocoa and yeast funk. Disappointing. Flavors are subtle cocoa forward, with funky Belgian yeast tang and floral highlights. Subtle sourness atop a building bitter backbone. The body is rich and smooth, with a sweet, rich, slightly roasted aftertaste. The finish is smooth, with a bittersweet linger. I have to admit, I had very high expectations of this."
"The beer pours a dark, chocolate brown, which is exactly the color it should be. The beer forms a head that sits a half-of-a-finger’s-width above the beer with medium sized, pebble-like bubbles that are a dark khaki color. On the nose, the beer smells distinctly of Ommegang’s house yeast. Fruity esters with a touch of spice whirl across the nose suggesting peach, pepper, hay, and just a ghost of milk chocolate. This smells a bit like a saison, if I’m being honest. If I were smelling this beer blindfolded, I would not have known it was a stout. The nose is disappointingly weak for a stout. On the tongue, the beer tastes softly sweet with a light bitter roast, a distinct fruity/spicy yeast funk with touch of acidity in the cheeks. This beer tastes like a saison, though. In flavor, the beer begins as fruity esters blending with peach, spicy pepper, touches of creamy banana, and some clove. This moves to lightly bitter grass and herbs that slowly blend with soft coco and milk chocolate that are very subtle. The finish returns lots of spicy esters and banana phenols and leaves me wanting more chocolate. The yeast gives off great funky flavors that are delightfully Belgian and fruity, but the beer is called “Chocolate Indulgence” and I want way more chocolate in the flavor. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a higher carbonation that provides a nice fluff to the tongue with a light bite. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and suggests “stout” the most to me. There is a slickness in the mouth as the beer leaves, and a scrim of sticky saliva is left on the tongue. Overall, I’m disappointed with Chocolate Indulgence because it does not have enough chocolate. I’ve seen Ommegang’s house yeast before, and think it would do well if it were subtly added to a stout, but as is the yeast character is domineering the beer and leaving me wanting variety. This beer is interesting, but fails in its promise. If it weren’t called “Chocolate Indulgence” I would have had to stretch to note the chocolate flavors hidden in the beer. I want more chocolate!"

"O: not overly impressed, but the caveat here is that I prefer a dark beer such as this to have more body and richness; for a beer with ""Indulgence"" in its name, I expect a more luxurious experience. Still appropriate for fans of chocolate stouts and porters, and dark Belgian ales."

"Gorgeous pour of thick foam atop a deeply dark brown. The nose is peppery, spicy, clovey and completely absent of chocolate. The flavors are nice with a peppery spice, clove, anise and peppercorns but no supportive flavors to provide a backbone. The feel is moderately carbonated with a lightness, despite its dark color. I seemed to miss the boat here as the name is misleading and it doesn't seem to fulfill the style."
""
"Good beer, a little underwhelming but not in a bad way. The name sets you up for a chocolate explosion, which thankfully it does not deliver."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep brown with a thick 2 inch lasting head that has the color of espresso with excellent lacing. Aromas of malt, chocolate and coffee. Nice notes of espresso roll of the nose as well if allowed to warm and open up for a second. Tastes of chocolate and coffee but falls flat beyond that. Long finish, that is unbalanced and overly bitter without much flavor. The taste improves with exposure though, opposite of taste secession. Seriously take a few big gulps and you get chocolate all over the palate. Mouthfeel is great. Creamy and smooth with low carbonation. Overall a good beer."

"Overall...its a good looking beer but the taste wasnt there for me....dont get me wrong its a good stout. but with a name like that...the taste has to live up to it."
"Feel: medium-full body. Excellent, soft carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - they should change the name to dark chocolate indulgence. I love that it is a desert beer but on the drier side. Tons of chocolatey character but not cloyingly sweet. Great stuff."
""
""
"Overall, this is a great beer, barrel age this sucker and see how it turns out maybe??!?"

"Overall, an instant favorite of mine. I don't usually drink chocolate inspired beers, but when I do, I drink Chocolate Indulgence."

"Tonight's after diner beer for American Craft Beer Week. Ommegang brewery in Cooperstown New York. A Belgium Style Stout with dark roasted malt and actual Belgian Chocolate added to it. A very smooth a creamy beer with a slight bitter coffee/chocolate finish."
""
""
""

"O - Impressed. I got this as part of a gift pack and I'd grab this again."

"Poured into an Ommegang flute glass. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass. Has a two finger fine tan head with great retention and pillowy lacing. Aroma dominated by chocolate with slight hints of toasted malt. Flavor of dark toasted malt, chocolate with light hints of dark fruit. Finishes with dry toasted malt and chocolate. Medium bodied. Fairly two dimensional malt and chocolate, but these two flavors are great together and I greatly enjoyed drinking this. Better flavor than expected at the ABV."
""
""

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 10/29/2010. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of cocoa, dark chocolate, roasted malt, light char, raisin, prune, toast, toffee, earth, floral, clove, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with great balance, strength, and complexity of chocolate, dark malt, and fruity ester notes. Taste of cocoa, dark chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, prune, caramel, toast, toffee, earth, light clove, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of cocoa, dark chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit, caramel, toast, toffee, earth, light clove, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of chocolate, roasted malt, and yeast ester flavors; with nice robustness; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian style stout! Great balance and complexity of chocolate, roasted, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"An decent BDA. I think the chocolate used to be more upfront, really setting this one apart from the rest."

"O - ""Indulgence"" is a little misleading, but it's still the primary source of flavor. Tasty beer, but one I most likely wouldn't get again."
""
"This is an interesting beer. The milk chocolate is delicious, but the cola aftertaste is off putting. On the whole it's a nice twist to a Belgian Dark Ale. Any fan of the style should check this one out."
"Overall a mediocre beer and big disappointment. Not one of omegagangs best efforts."
""
""
"Overall: Once I saw this beer sitting on the shelf, I knew I was in for a real treat. It was extremely drinkable and had a somewhat rich overall tone, though I can see some room for improvement could be used if a more rich, chocolate and malt body is desired. I could see myself drinking this again and would recommend to a friend. Hell, I would even share one with a friend. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very bland, slightly bitter, not very chocolate, not very Belgian beer. This is the second dark beer I've had from Ommegang I've been disappointed with (Seduction was the other). Thinking they should stick to traditional Belgian styles."
""
"Easy drinking BDA, although I didn't get much of that Belgian spice from the yeast."
"Again, good, just not great as expected."
"To be sure, the booze was here and the somewhat liberal carbonation in this helped to hide it a bit, until I polished this off. I commend Ommegang for brewing beers that are good enough to make one think that they're imported but they missed the mark a bit on this one. It's fine beer for the Winter but this was just a bit too strong and light in mouthfeel for the style it was placed in. Go ahead and grab a good milk chocolate bar to have with this, just to even things out a bit."
""
""
""
"Ahh...now it's mellowed out on the biting elements. Tasty, smooth, malty, chocolaty, slight hops, minerals, cocoa...still has a significant small bubble dark amber head with lace. Slight touch of espresso in the finish...letting the beast open up gives greater depth, which this brew has!"
""
""
"Overall its a great stout and another solid beer from Ommegang. It's not too heavy which is really refreshing. The only thing that is disappointing is the lack of chocolate. With a beer named ""Chocolate indulgence"" there should be more chocolate but that's just me."
""
""
""
"There is a nice fluffy light tan head on top of the pour. The head sticks around quite nicely and leaves some lacing on the glass. I'm getting some chocolate in the smell, but it's not aggressive. I'm also getting mild yeast spice and some dark fruit in the nose. The flavor is chocolatey, but I would say it's more delicate than indulgent. The chocolate carries through the whole sip, but the bitterness from the roasted malt builds in the finish. That bitterness is the only thing that sticks with me after the sip. I would have liked the chocolate to stick around a bit longer. The carbonation is creamy but the body of the beer doesn't quite live up to that. This is a solid beer, but doesn't quite live up to the name."

""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very good beer. Easy to drink and somewhat warming for a cool winter night."
"Overall this is a great beer. It is full of flavor with some good hops and subtle chocolate flavor. Great beer."
""
"O Not as big on the chocolate flavor as I would have thought. Just more of a Milk chocolate tasting porter. Given the name I expected more depth. Still a nice light beer, just a bit misleading."
"Overall- Nice beer but I could get better in each aspect of this beer including body, taste and smell/look. Solid beer but nothing to seek out."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: As a beer it's pretty good but as a Belgian it is a little one-dimentional. Chocolate lovers rejoice. Would I drink it again? Probably not."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very easy drinking and tasty. Rather short on the chocolate and more coffee forward. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but I guess that comes with the territory of being a Belgian style Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours deep brown with a huge mocha head. Aroma is a big dose of chocolate with a little belgian yeast thrown in. Flavor pretty offers chocolate peered with some fruity esters and spice from the yeast. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, not a fan of belgian stouts and not a fan of this one."
""
"Overall the first few sips of this were killer bring a huge smoke and chocolate note. But as I got more into the beer these nice flavors faded into something lighter and more aggressive. Worth a try."
""
"Chocolate is not as apparent on the palate as on the nose. As such, it comes across as a Belgian dark ale with a malt profile tipped toward the roasty end of the spectrum. Mouthfeel is not up to stout standards, being kind of thin and ""watery," for lack of a better word. Ommegang kind of stumbles a but with this offering; it's still good, but not up to their typical level of excellence."
""
""
""
"i was kind of misled by this one from the name.. don't get me wrong, it's not a bad beer - it just wasn't chocolatey enough.. err at all."
"It's well intended but less than stellar."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An interesting beer that's kind of an oddball. Definitely the malt bill of a stout but a belgian yeast strain. Good flavors and it meshes pretty well. The fruity esters provide a nice contrast to the dark roast malt and chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Very enjoyable but there is just a little too much alcohol presence in this beer after it warms up to room temperature to be an easy drinker. The dryness in the mouthfeel combined with the light sweetness make this a sipping beer. The bitterness of the beer definitely mellowed with age (I had this fresh and remember it being considerably more bitter)."

"As a side note, I wish rhey would seperate Belgian stouts out on their own."
""
""
"O: Roasty stout with some belgian yeast. Pretty simple and tasty. Not as much chocolate as the name would imply which was a bit disappointing but otherwise a good beer. Wish there were a category for belgian stouts, this certainly isn't a typical ""belgian dark""."
"Pours dark brown with about a 1/2 inch if tan foam. Looks like some light colored yeast floaters settling to the bottom. I get some light Belgium aroma. Maybe banana and a little chocolate. Taste is sort of fruity with a chocolate finish. Chocolate is more intense when colder and gives way to the fruit as it warms. Makes me wonder if it was more chocolatey when younger. Creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Overall very nice beer. Not too much chocolate, well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: an interesting beer. I could do with a more chocolatey and less, well, basic aroma. Overall, though, a tasty beer which makes a good sipper."
""
""
"If this used to be chocolate, it has turned into raisinets. Interesting, but for people looking to try this in its original form, you may already be too late."
"This is a no-brainer with dinner and would easily add to a sirloin steak."
""
""
""
"O - Good chocolate beer. I would say it has a few highlights, but otherwise pretty standard."
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown in color with a small off-white head. Decent chocolate with sweet malt and dark fruits. A little bit of oxidation, too. Sort of a bland aroma overall. There’s a good chocolate flavor and a bit of caramel and toasted bread. The flavor is also a bit of oxidation. Overall just kind of sweet and chocolatey. I guess that's the point. Medium body and carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Since the style description seems to be a catch all so to speak, there is no sat in stone parameters. This easily fits within the loose definition, the sweet and malty. My first brew of this style, me likes. For a Belgium, I like (no Belgium candied sugar flavor detected). A nice sipper, I'd do this again with no hessitation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really well done chocolate stout, it is just a shame that it is more than likely the last time I will ever have it."
""
"Overall: Incredibly finished and not hard to ""indulge"" in, you don't need to be a heavy beer drinker or some crazy connoisseur to love this beer. Cheers to all and Merry Christmas!"
""
"Overall, this is a good stout. In the chocolate category, I would put this at the top."

"O: I think this is a very solid beer. I love the chocolate flavor and smooth mouthfeel."
""
""
"O: a great brew, really hits the spot and is unique for the style"
""
""
""
"O: Very nice beer, very glad I tried it, but I probably won't buy again. It seems to be stuck in the middle, too big for an easy drinking stout and too small to be something I want to truly savor (like a RIS). The chocolate is a nice touch, but I would like a little more malt character. I am starting to think this would have been better as a BDA with chocolate vs. a chocolate stout."

"O: Ommegang's Chocolate Indulgence Stout wasn't nearly as good out of the bottle as it was on tap. The chocolate feels much more muted and pushed to the back as a role player. In the end, this is an average beer, something I don't feel all too compelled to have again."
"The taste is extremely sweet and rich, and oh so good. I would compare it to chocolate covered cherries. Delicious. The estery taste comes through immediately as does the chocolate. Subtle notes of candy sugar. Full bodied and heavy. This beer is worthy of the name ""indulgence"". Very good for dessert."
"Full-bodied with very little carbonation. This is a THICK brew...very heavy. I would only recommend it as a dessert beer due to the richness of it. Very yummy...I do wish it was a little more complex, but for what it offers, it is very balanced."
"O: I’ve got a feeling I know why this beer isn’t a regular release; it’s a little hard to love. Underneath, it’s a lovely Belgian, something I know Ommegang can do well; however, it’s overshadowed by a ham-handed attempt at “chocolate indulgence.” Too bad – a chocolate Belgian stout seems like a decent idea."
"O: Very nice. I could see myself drinking this as a winter warmer or having it with a particularly rich dessert. I like it."
"O: Fantastic and criminally under-rated. Highly recommended, I will search out this bitter-sweet jewel wherever I can find it. Hurrah for Ommegang!"
"O: Great Belgian dark ale and perfect for any chocolate lover or for dessert. To me, this is more like a stout then anything because of the yeast is very faint. The first time I had it, it was slightly sour, but the second time was much much better."
"Overall, this is a decent stout especially for people who doesn't like sweet chocolate flavor."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly airy, I'd actually call it fluffy. This is a pretty solid beer, it's not overly heavy, it's not overly chocolatey."
"O – Not overly complex, the flavors could benefit from some age to help them integrate, but otherwise a solid brew."
"Pours a dark brown w/ a one finger chocolate head. Decent carbonation and lacing on this brew. Smell is that of cocoa powder, chocolate, malt, hops, and very faint fruit. Smell is not balanced, and a little of a disappointment. Taste is a little better, but still not enough balance (or malt) to make this beer really top notch. Feel is fairly smooth, w/ a little hop bite in the background. Overall, this beer has been hit of miss for me. The recent beers I've had have not measured up to the ones I've had several years ago. Not sure whether the brew has changed or not... Please add more malt!"
"Only one question remains: Is this a Belgian dark ale or a Belgian stout?"
"O- I've had this brew about a dozen times... and it never fails me. I love it just as I do everything that Ommegang does. Not a sweet or milk stout so its not gonna take care of that sweet tooth... but the chocolate just lends a beautiful harmony that mixes with the Belgian flavors that this brewery is so well known for."
"Overall, while I was surprised at how little chocolate flavor was in a beer named Chocolate Indulgence, I do think the beer is quite good, and worth a try. But again, if you buy a bottle, start off thinking not ""chocolate," but ""black stout," and you'll be on a better track towards a favorable first impression."
"This beer is quite the chocolate treat. For a chocolate lover, this one's a great pick!"
"Indulgence pours black as night and boasts a thick, creamy chocolate colored head. The head slowly dissipates into thick lacing that sticks around to the last sip. Dark chocolate and roasted malts greet you on the smell and faint hints of coffee are mixed within. As the beer warms, hints of alcohol become noticeable on the nose as well. When you take a sip you notice that this beer is definitely chocolate-y, but not all that sweet. Some bitter notes come through and make you think of a decadent dark chocolate. Roasted malts and touches of coffee are also present and help round this beer out."
"O: This is just a big miss in my book. Ommegang's worst beer by a long way. I had tried an aged bottle before and though my dislike was due to that fact, but this fresh on-tap experience was no better."
"This is a really great dessert beer and a good sipper for chilly nights. Can’t wait to have one for those few days of winter here in New Orleans!"
"Pours black with a huge three fingers of dark sand colored foam, very solid retention and nice sheeting of lacing. Smells is a big, bright roasted malt, chocolate, and nuttiness. Taste is crisp, dry, with dark chocolate, chocolate malt, earthiness, and some burnt smokiness in the background. Medium carbonation on a medium-light body; goes down pretty easy. Overall, I was expecting more of a chocolate bomb given the name, but this was still a pretty solid, standard stout. Even though I was expecting this to substitute for dessert, I actually think the dryness would complement something sweet quite well."
"O: A very interesting and tasty beer; not a cloying dessert beer. Sweet, but still refreshing."
"Narrative: Johnathon Chiu had never been allowed sweets as a boy. In fact, his father specifically noted that the sweet enzymes in eggplant skins had more than enough c6h1206 for any growing boy. He longed for the sweet succor of candy but was systematically denied all of his life. But that was then, and this is the Freshman Year at VASSAR. The first 3 days he kept a cool demeanor around the buffet and ate according to tradition. On the third night, the revelation ensued. The local 7-11 attendant witnessed the raiding of what appeared to be a diabetic madman. Johnathon clutched the paper bag and almost sprinted home and locked the door. Scarcely had he pulled the shades when he dug straight into rolos and sixlets, cascading waves of joy and endorphins, snoballs and watchamacallits. The whole experience just hit his bloodstream like pure heroin. His roomate walked in abruptly and found Johnathon hunched over the chocolate gooey mess, “THIS ISN’T WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!” “B- Johnathon, where are your PANTS?”"
"It’s possible Ommegang used unsweetened chocolate, to which I say, why bother? Unsweetened chocolate is like flat beer, it’s just not good."
"I've also had this on draught at the Gingerman in Ft. Worth in early 2011. I remember the chocolate flavor being masked a bit more by the fact that it came out of a keg."
"While visiting my aunt last summer in Rochester NY we stopped in at a little pub called the Old Toad. They had bottle of this one their menu and after searching for it for a year or more I was very happy to see they had some in stock. I ordered a bottle to go and brought it home with me. Opened it up a few days later and love it's rich black pour. The head was brown a foamy. The smell was roasted and burnt with a nose full of Belgian dark chocolate and some yeast. The taste was chocolatey and had a nice transition from sweet to bitter. The mouthfeel was pretty thick and very smooth. Overall I was very glad to get this and I'm very happy that it was as enjoyable as I expected it to be! A very good beer all around in my opinion."
"D: Oh yea. More please, possibly with aging it could be better."
"It's not what I expected, but it's pretty good."
"It's a very drinkable stout, not overly complex, but enjoyable."
"D - Very drinkable. The addition of the sweet dark fruit flavor is excellent. The beer also does a great job of having rich and bold flavors without being too heavy or filling."
"Pours a black color. 1/2 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, dry hop, slight earthy malt, slight alcohol, and slight spice. Fits the style of a Belgian Dark Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, roasted malt, sweet malt, slight citrus hops, dry hops, and a tangy-chocolate flavor. Overall, good appearance, aroma, complexity, and body."
"Pours opaque black with some noticeable sediment. A fine, thick, tan head stays alive right to the end. Chocolate and rich dark malts in the nose, with some dark fruits. Big chocolate taste, with roasty malts, cherries and raisins; earthy and bready. Full-bodied, smooth, and quite drinkable."
"Would not buy or suggest this beer to anyone."
"There is obviously some chocolate in this beer, but it's really no different than a stout or even a slightly bitter porter. The name doesn't really fit. Despite that, it's a nice change of pace for your every day beer."
"Very interesting beer, seemingly tough to categorize. I'd have guessed a stout, but here I see it's listed as Belgian Dark. Pours black with a nice chocolate brown head, well retained, lacing the glass well. The smell is strong chocolate and hoppy. The taste is something very different. You get a lot of dark chocolate. This beer is much more bitter than it's name and appearance would lead one to expect. Very hoppy and roasty, light chocolate sweetness to balance it a bit. Very interesting beer and well worth a try."
"O- Drinkability is good, it's a pretty good beer in general but I'm not sure how much the chocolate adds to an otherwise solid Begian style beer."
"Overall, what we found to be the strongest point of this beer was the mouthfeel. It was outrageously smooth and slick, easily gliding around the mouth. On an interesting note, it was unexpected to have such a strong yeast characteristic, even more so that it was so “Belgian” seeming. It was certainly a nice aspect to keep this beer unique. This is chocolate milk for grown-ups, with a huge chocolate profile, showing us what true indulgence really is."
"O - quite drinkable but not good enough to be a top pick."
"From the corked 25 ml. bottle packaged on 10/22/10 and best by: 10/2012. Sampled on April 25, 2011. It pours black as night with a delicate tan head that lingers up top. Dark chocolate is just the beginning of the wide array of aromas which include sweet malts, yeast, and a red grape, wine-like sensation. The smooth but bold body tickles my tongue with a cornucorpia of chocolates, malts, pepper, and yeast which yields a slight but noted dry finale. I guess I liked it better than a majority of the previous reviewers."
"A super easy drink. Easily an ""all nighter."" Easy going, tasty, beautiful and well put together. No doubt, one that I will pick up again. I love these chocolate beers."
"O- It lived up to its ""chocolate"" and cocao on the label. This is a stand alone ale unless you wanted to do a Black and Tan with a fruity Lambic (as suggested by the young man that sold it to me). I was thinking this is a dessert. A 25 oz bottle could go well with 4 friends sharing it after a nice light supper of seafood."
"D-its difficult to figure out exactly what this is supposed to be, a stout or a Belgian Dark Ale. it definitely fits well between the two, but i'd consider this as a foreign export stout more than anything. ommegang really tricked me with the yummy sounding name, but the beer didn't live up to the price tag. the more i drink it, the more i'm starting to enjoy it, and appreciate its uniqueness value though."
"I had this in the past and wasn’t blown away but maybe some age did this brew some good as I’m much more impressed this time around. The chocolate comes through very well and makes for a nice dessert beer. Good stuff!"
"Overall an incredibly superb tasting stout. Definitely work having another!"
"The price doesn’t match the beer. I know the cage and cork just make people open their wallets, but sorry at around 13 bucks I want a hell of a lot more from a 7% abv beer especially. This seems like a pretty simple stout. An odd example of a beer that is not as good as the sum of its' parts."
"Drinkability - There is a lot to love about this beer.A complexities and drinkability. A glass of Chocolate Indulgence would be a great accompaniment to the holidays or a dessert."
"O - Despite being a particularly pricey item, this is pretty darn drinkable!"
"Overall a good Stout which I would buy again at any time."
"Overall though I still felt this was alright, interesting take on this beer."
"Ommegang Chocolate Indulgence Stout has a black colour and a 3 mm tan head that lasts a little while and is replaced by good lacing. The smell is fresh (is that hops?) and roasty malt that has some chocolate character to it. There are lots of hops up front as well as some malty chocolate. The alcohol is fairly noticeable which is strange in a 7% beer. The aftertaste is roasty malt and slightly bitter, reminiscent of dark chocolate. This beer is very foamy and full in its texture. Overall, a nice chocolate stout, but far too hoppy for this style (imho)."
"Pours dark with thick creamy light brown foam. Loads of lacing. Dark espresso smell, dark chocolate. Rich roasted. Belgian yeast taste under a dark roasted malt taste. Dark fruit. Full of flavor, bursts forth. Great beer, easy to drink, yet so much happening."
"Concluding thoughts: AMAZING! If you want a chocolate beer, this one will not disappoint. At 7% ABV, its an extremely drinkable beer."
"Overall, the bitter/dry chocolate is very nice, not overbearing. The lack of sweetness improves overall drinkability for me. Not something I would seek out often, but enjoyable."
"Overall: Tasty, although the flavor of unsweetened chocolate in this beer isn't really for me. The bitter aftertaste is a bit overwhelming, and made this beer a little bit of a struggle to finish."
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability - This is a fine ale. It goes down quite easy and I think if it would have had a higher alcohol content it would have floundered."
"Good beer, better Chocolate stouts, but nice on a cold evening."
"Drinkability: Lite and smooth. The beer is easy to consume but lacks enough interest for the price. I mean come on, the label makes a point of mentioning it's brewed with Belgian chocolate. One would think you would get an interesting flavor."
"is a hint more than a prevalent taste - medium thick feel on the tongue with a decent stick on the finish - good for one bomber."
"D: This beer is a slow sipper because of the bitterness and dryness; the presence of sweetness and creaminess would have made this a lot more quaffable."
"Appears with a pitch black body, tan foamin head billowing thick with chunky sporadic lacing coating my Unibroue La Fin du Monde chalice. Aroma has dark chocolate, herbal hops with not much else going on. The chocolate doesn't seem real creamy more of a dark powdered chocolate. Flavor has a sharp acidity from the dark roasted malts and dark chocolate additions, some nice balance from the herbal hops in the background. Definitely not a dessert beer, I was picturing sweet super chocolate decadence. However it was a nice quaffable dark Belgian style dry dark chocolate infused ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied somewhat astringent with bitterness off the dark chocolate/dark roasted malts. Carbonation is nice lively somewhat effervescent, mouthfeel was smooth. Drinkability was decent nothing too sweet or candy bar milk chocolate about it. More like dark organic cocoa powder, my wife was a bit disappointed that it wasn't a chick dessert beer."
"D - Although it is tasty and very drinkable, I can't see myself drinking much more than a bomber of this, the carbonation is just too overwhelming for my palate, share with a friend."
"Served to me in a 12oz tulip. Dark brown, almost black. Capped nicely with a fluffy tan head. Nose is pleasantly complex. Cocoa beans and ripe fruit. The palate is full of flavor. Rich chocolate, soft earthy notes, and a healthy dose of fruity esters. Problem is, these flavors never really mesh. Which is a shame because this brew has potential to be great. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin and fluid. In short, this is a very unique and interesting ale and is worth a taste."
"Opinion: Well, I had really high hopes for this beer, and even played it up for my wife. She agreed (without my prompting) that it was mediocre at best. I mean, when you stand it up to Budweisers Bare Knuckle stout...it blows it away, but even standing next to Harpoons Chocolate Stout, it pales in comparison. This one concentrates more on the Belgium than either the Stout or the Chocolate. In all honesty, it seems like a beer (Dubbel or something) that got away from them that they are trying to recoup by adding some flavor into it. I don't know, it seems off and I won't be buying any more."
"Pours a dark, dark brown with a thin tan head. The nose brings forward some dark fruits paired decently enough with a strong dose of dark chocolate. Some roasted malt there as well. The flavor falls along the same lines--there is some brown sugar, dark fruits, and chocolate, though nothing is terribly interesting. Mouthfeel is medium with a dryness in the finish. A pretty good beer, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have this again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it had some very nice flavors to it. I found it pretty well balanced between the chocolate and the bitter, roasty flavors, which helped the drinkability for me. Pretty solid beer overall."
"A very drinkable beer that I had suspected to be a dessert beer. Chocolate Indulgence is however a beer for any occasion."
"I enjoyed this on tap at the Black Dog in Urbana, IL, and point you to my review in Beerfly: great BBQ and fantastic beer."
"Finish is simple light bitter grapefruit skin. I need not try this one again."
"D: Based on the name, you would think this beer is bursting with chocolate flavor, you'd be mistaken. There is a very subtle chocolate presence in this beer. It is a pretty good beer in general, but the lack of chocolate with a name like ""Chocolate Indulgence"" makes it lackluster."
"T- Do not detect the chocolate as advertised in the name... Taste follows the smell with little complexity afterwards."
"D: A mediocre beer and a disappointment from an otherwise solid brewery."
"Poured into a Ommegang Chalice dark chocolate brown with a one finger tan head. Good head retention and lacing. There's not much that I find on the nose other than a malted scent. No expected cocoa scent. The taste isn't all that exciting either. There are cocoa notes that isn't all that strong. For this to be a belgian, there isn't any belgian yeast pressence. It's not strong enough to be considered a stout either. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is at a good level. The lower alcohol and body of this actually makes it rather drinkable but not worth its limited availabilty."
"This is a nice dessert beer, decadent and well-made."
"D - Its weird. Not assertive enough to be a good dark ale, but way lacking almost all the good aspects of a stout. Yeah, the appearance is great but it pretty much ends there. Taste falls incredibly flat. Wheres the big chocolate notes? Not in this beer thats for sure. And if you, like me, buy this looking for the chocolate you will more likely than not be sorely dissappointed."
"Poured deep brown with nice ruby hues in the light. Light beige head that lasted an impressive length of time, adorning the oversized wine glass with bands of lacing. The aromas explode Chocolate! Belgian dark chocolate, cocoa, hint of dark toast, and the faintest hint of raisins. The cocoa is more pronounced than the rest. Chocolate is the highlight of the flavors, although it is balanced well by slight caramel, touch of raisins and plums, and cream. A toasty and sweetish finish makes for a great dessert beer. Indeed, this went very well with pumpkin pie, apple pie, and cheesecake! The mouthfeel is thicker than expected, yet not quite in the RIS range. Of course, this is a Belgian style beer. Alcohol is not noticeable at all and before long we were sad that our glasses were empty."
"This bottle is at least a year old up to two years so I don't know if this has made much of a difference, probably has."
"Had this at an Ommegang/Duvel beer tasting and was really looking for to this one. I was disappointed to find that this beer smelled like used, wet cigarettes and tasted the same. The mouth feel seemed thin for a stout. Glad I had it at a beer tasting so I know not to buy it."
"Drinkability: If I wanted to, I could probably name five beers more chocolaty than this. After my first glass, I already have a headache. This is strike one against Chocolate Indulgence, but I would definitely try another bottle for comparison."
"D- Nice to sip on without knowing the name... the ""chocolate"" wasn't all that prevalent"
"Price = $9.99 at Witherspoon Wine"
"jd"
"Another very nice brew from Brewery Ommegang. I had this a while back (this is my first review however) and I have to admit was a bit surprised with this. The flavors seem to be flirting with me. They are all there, but unfortuntely they ae somewhat muted. Don't get me wrong, this is a very good brew, but may be a bit of a misnomer. Definitely worthy, but there are other ways to ""Indulge"" the senses..."
"D: With a name like ""Chocolate Indulgence", I was expecting more of a velvety-smooth taste than I got. It is a tad bright for a stout/dark ale. It is a good beer, but not worth the $16 price tag for a 25.4 bottle of it."
"Chocolate Indulgence pours a lighter shade of black. The appropriately cocoa colored head rises to about three fingers in height and shows both impressive lacing and retention. All things considered a very nice looking beer. There's some milk chocolate to the nose, but I was expecting a bit more. Even more than that, a general roastiness dominates in terms of aromas. There's a bit more to CI's flavor, but it still winds up disappointing somewhat. Again, any chocolate is largely drowned out by the taste of roasted grains up front. There's a subtle kick of spice from the yeast, before a pleasant mellow coffee swirl closes things out. The body is a bit on the dry side for a beer that's supposedly ""indulgent", but not too much. This minor fault is somewhat masked by a slightly lower than expected carbonation. All in all the mouthfeel ends up feeling a bit small for the beer. This is the first beer from Ommegang that's really failed to meet my expectations, though it's still not a bad beer. One could say it's poorly brewed or just poorly named, but either way, it falls short of being chocolate indulgence."
"D: I know what I wont be getting another bottle of! I love Ommegang brew, but honestly I haven't been this dissapointed in a LONG time. If you wanna share it with some beer loving friends go ahead, but you've been warned."
"D: One glass and I'm done with this one. Think of a cold beer adaption of hot cocoa, but this is very filling and one glass is enough in a sitting."
"This beer pours a dark black color, with a large creamy hazle brown colored head. The smell was a bit weak, and the aroma was moslty of chocholate. The inital taste was of a typical dry stout, and as more of the beer was consumed the stonger chochlate flavors mixing in with the stout like flavors made itselt present. A nice beer to sip, but not hard to drink. Overall, I find chocolate beers trickey, but this one was very good."
"There isn't much to indicate this beer's ""Belgian"" heritage except a hint of funk/tang about 3/4 of the way in. Any more and I don't think it would work. Very good, but I'll have to see if I could finish one myself."
"Reminiscient of the Rogue Chocolate Stout, but the chocolate is less strong here, but no less good. Its a comfortable easy going stout, mixed in with some nice smooth not over the top chocolate accompaniment. I enjoyed it, it wasn't heavy on any particular aspect, but I couldn't really detect anything particularly ""belgian"" tasting about the yeast, only the sweetness and the dark fruit thing ever so nuanaced."
"Lighter body, due to the higher carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. Very tasty."
"Overall, average beer did not live up to its name of Chocolate Indulgence. I would drink it again if opportunity presented itself, but probably wont buy another bottle."
"A solid black-brown color, opaque and topped with a massive light brown colored head and good lacing. The aroma offers a thick chocolate malt and bacon. Wow, delicious smelling! The flavor follows with chocolate pumpernickel and grapey highlights. It's medium bodied with mild carbonation. Somewhat silky in feel I pick up a bit of coffee bitterness. Plenty drinkable for a heavier brew and very tastey. Nice."
"Cheers!"
"Nice to see something like this on-tap 'round here. It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of light brown foam. The nose comprises a heapin' helpin' o' dark chocolate, along with some roasted malts, light coffee, molasses, and caramelized brown sugar. The taste is pretty similar, with notes of chocolate powder, a good amount of coffee, some brown sugar, cinnamon, black pepper, and roasted malts. The body is a somewhat light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a very good brew, though a bit light for my tastes. Were it a tad heavier and thicker, it would be nearly perfect."
"This beer pours a darkness covered in a light beige. The smell is of chocolate and raisins...sweet Raisinettes! The taste has the same chocolate raisin taste to it, but there are a couple of guests that show up to this party. Bourbon and oak make this beer really pleasant on the tongue. There is a general velvety texture to it that is out of this world. Even with the booze there I would have no problem having this beer again. It is a wonderful pleasant tasting beer."
"Overall, it's a great beer, but probably my least favorite of my Ommegang samples so far. I'm not saying that's a bad beer, but for a beer of this price and reputation, I was expecting it to differentiate itself a little more."
"D: It was a pleasure to split the bottle with my dad, as it's meant to be shared with others. The 7% ABV is tame, yet adds a warming quality and fullness to the brew. A tad sticky sweet, this brew might be best served with mellow cheeses, tart fruits, or simply on its own. Very nice."
"Overall, few stouts are session beers and although the ABV will prohibit mass consumption, I could down this a lot faster than other Belgian Dark Ales/Stouts. Great flavor, well-rounded, a non-typical Belgian inspired brew."
"Not very drinkable, really, and particularly not when I was hoping for a Belgian style."
"First impressions were good and it finished strong. There is cocoa at the end of every gulp and I appreciate the added complexity the chocolate gives."
"I would like to drink again but price is a little bit high. Overall, good belgian style chocolate stout."
"Drinkability- Not too shabby."
"D: Very low. It's heavy in every way. The single bottle was too much for me."
"D-It is a very rich beer that I can enjoy at about 10oz at a time. Very nice beer from a stellar brewery."
"All things told, it succeeds. The beer pours a rich black brown with a vigorous tan head and lacing like you wouldn't believe. (I've now finished the beer and the entire glass is well laced.) Smells like a typical Belgian dark with little suggestion of the chocolate in the brew. The beer tastes very nice however coming off as a bittersweet coco mixed with something along the lines of a dubble or tripple. Tasty and is a treat when the weather starts to turn but not the most drinkable of beers for more than a pint."
"Pours a deep brown colour with tan head. Head starts off thick, but even as it dissipates it leaves a nice layer with lacing on the side. Smell is of bitter chocolate, mild roasted malt and some Belgian yeast. Flavour is sweet with chocolate roast. Mouthfeel is thin compared to stouts, but thick compared to Belgian ales, which seems to make sense given the style. A very nice beer."
"D. Slightly sweet and mildly bitter. A solid (if not terribly impressive) stout."
"That being said, not every beer should be big and menacing. This is a great beer to accompany a wide range of meals with, and is also perfect to use to introduce newbies to the word of chocolate stouts. It is lightly effervescent (and is probably more so when fresh), but smooth with soft cocoa and roast flavors and an easy finish without much bitterness. This is the perfect equation to start off with into a world of typically potent beers."
"Definitely a good cocoa beer and definitely a different style from Ommegang's regular fare, it's worth a try sometime!"
"Drinks: like false advertising. While a good beer, Chocolate Indulgence is neither as chocolatey nor as indulgent as I'd hope, and definitely not worth the $12 price tag I paid for it. I used the first bit of the bottle in a brownie recipe, which turned out excellent and may be a far better utilization of this beer."
"This would probably be better with age. This Stout is as you would expect it to be. Chocolately!"
"This is an OK beer. Very much one-note (that note is chocolate). A whole 750 would be too much for me. Pair this with a smore's Pop-Tart for best results."
"Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Pours a dark dark brown almost black with a one finger light tan head. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of coffee, alcohol, and subtle chocolate. The flavor was of caramel, coffee, and chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a nice chocolate stout. The subtle flavor notes were nice and not overwhelming so you could pick out some more of the flavors in the brew. The aroma was lacking however and could be improved on to make it more complex. Glad I finally got the chance to drink this one after so long."
"drinkability: awesome belgian dark, not heaby on the hocolate as expected and not quite as sweet"
"D - A very good Belgian Ale. A terrible chocolate flavoured ale."
"Beer poured black as night with a large brown head that is leaving lacing all over my tulip glass. Nose is cocoa, hints of belgian yeast and coffee. Taste is big on the cocoa without being overly sweet, with a nice hint of coffee in the background. Mouthfeel is classic belgian yeast strain, very smooth, but yet on the light side - it seems slightly off. Drinkabilty is good, i suspect this has improved with age. It was nice to induldge on this, would try again to see how it has changed."
"After drinking quite a few Russian Imperial Stouts lately, having one that is ""only"" 7% ABV was refreshing. The flavors of this beer are well-suited for a stout and this would make a nice dessert beer with some tiramisu or even used in the tiramisu instead of espresso."
"I will be using the rest for a beer float."
"The taste follows on the from the nose with a deliciously dry finish. Mouthfeel could be a bit better but I'm not complaining too much about that. This would be a wonderful beer to pair with a powerful curry, I think. Very nice indeed."
"This is a pretty unique beer that is worth trying, but not something I would reach for on a regular basis."
"Pours a black with a small toffee colored head that left lacing all down the snifter. The smell is strong of dark fruits, cherry mostly, with a lot of dark chocolate and roasted malt. The taste is very similar, only with more dark chocolate and less dark fruits. I get a very pleasant woodieness to it as well. Not overly sweet at all. Very slight notices of booze as it goes down. Very creamy mouthfeel and a pleasure to drink."
"Very dry finish, there's a reason so many reviews of this use 'dusty'! Thinnish body but it only aids in the immense drinkability of this beer. It manages to be both dessert like at a meager 7% and leaves you wanting more. Would also be lovely with a rich dessert, the dry cocoa would cut the sweetness. This is a superb creation. Not sure how the age affected it because I've not had it fresh but at this point I am ready to stock up the cellar and make sure I have more of this around."
"Definitely a sipper but works great as just that. This would pair really well with all kinds of desserts, or would even work as a dessert itself."
"Wonderful quaff and a decent sipping beer for any post meal session."
"The Indulgence Stout pours a midnight black color and a nice tan frothy head bubbles over the edge of the glass. Very good retention that leaves a small mustache with each sip. Nose is mostly burnt coffee with some chocolate. Taste is sweet with chocolate. Not much coffee is noticed on the palate. Other tastes are roasted malts and some syrup. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and semi-sweet. Drinkability is mediocre. Not as much chocolate as I was expecting but this could have mellowed out with the 1 year in the cellar."
"D - Drinkable, but not something I'd care to drink substantial amounts of. Did go well with some chocolate chip cookies."
"It pours dark brown with a tan head. The aroma is faintly of chocolate, but otherwise like that of a normal stout. It has a very slight chocolate taste, not as strong as expected. THe mouthfeel is that of a lighter stout, nowhere near as heavy feeling as Guinness or other staple stouts. There is almost no hoppiness to the beer at all, making it extremely easy to drink."
"I am surprised that there isn't more of a belgian yeastiness in this Belgian Dark Ale. There is plenty of mouthfeel and creaminess but it is slightly lacking in the overall malt bill. I would enjoy just a little more punch. It is possible that this is exactly the point of the chocolate indulgence. All in all I really enjoyed this and thought it was perfect for desert."
"Bottle date of 10/19/09 with a best by date of 10/2012. Pours a dark brown color with more than 2 fingers of a mocha colored head. Aroma is mostly chocolate powder. Serious amount of lace clings to the glass in a solid layer like a curtain from the slow head recession. Chocolate completely dominates the nose with a faint hint of citrus hops in the background. Taste is chocolatey with a slight bitterness upfront and finishes with some alcohol character. Thin body with low carb. Lingering taste of chocolate is left in the mouth."
"The taste is a nice sweet coffee and chocolate, toasted and roasted malts. It's liquid chocolate, a nice thick but smooth mouthfeel with no unpleasant aftertaste. It kept my mouth wanting for more... I wish I'd grabbed two bottles instead of just the one."
"Pours a rich dark near-black with minimal ring of brownish head. Smell is of dark roasted grains with faint hints of bitter dark chocolate and belgian yeasts. Taste follows scent, which is disapointing because the namce says chocolate, mostly roasted malts on this one. The belgian yeasts add an interesting taste along with the burnt malts. Body is medium, dry and chalky. Not impressed, almost a weak version of Brooklyn Black Chocolate."
"Notes: It´s nice to see Ommegang trying these brews, and it´s quality as always. Although the Belgium obsession may be hurting them a bit here: a ""true Belgium stout"" says the label. And sure enough there is a yeasty and chocolaty Belgium hint, but being able to brew stuff of this quality the ale does not need any justification and this one feels like it lingers on its own compromises."
"Pours a pitch black with a light brown 3 finger head. A little lacing is left behind. Paid $25 for this beer and it totally wasn't worth it. Maybe had I not had Southern Tier Choklat two days ago, my review would be different, but this just isn't on that level. While I enjoyed the beer, all I could think about was ""I wish this was a Choklat instead"" A little dark chocolate and mostly roasted malts complete the taste. I'd try again if given to me, but def wouldn't spend another 25 beans on it."
"Pours a pitch black with a creamy brown head. Smells of dark chocolates and a hint of sourness. Taste is estery and light up front, a hint of chocolate in the middle and a dry finish with a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy low carbonation. Drinkability is good I would get this again."
"Verdict: A little bit of a disappointment, Chocolate Indulgence is not the rich and chocolaty Belgian-tinged treat I was hoping for. Instead, this is essentially a Milk Stout with a well-hidden alcohol boost."
"Drinkability: Misunderstood by some around here who seem to be expecting a Southern Tier style stout, this is a very drinkable beer though it lacks a little complexity in the final analysis"
"Poured a dark brown with good carbonation and a dirty, tannish head. Nose is chocolate and coffee. Taste is very good with hints of bakers chcocolate and milk cocoa.Very smooth and creamy. Mouthfeel was good and drinkability the same. This is a fine chocolate stout that I could drink over and over."
"This is a beer all its own, dont know that a particular style suits it, but it definitely has its place."
"D- Poor. Misleading beer, not very stout-ish, and too much hops for me, even if it was a real stout. Didn't sense any real chocolate (and certainly nothing close to ""indulgence"") in it's watery taste. What a disappointment this was."
"D- This goes down very easy and I could see myself having a couple of these over the course of a couple of hours."
"All around this beer is another Ommegang product that doesn't disappoint. Great flavor, well-rounded, a non-typical Belgian inspired craft beer. Will Drink Again."
"Distinctive nose of cocoa and malt. Tastey ale. Coffee and a pleasant cocoa bitterness. Lightly carbonated, so despite the richness of this ale, very drinkable."
"Overall, a nice brew, falls short of amazing. Pairs well with berries."
"Overall: Massive beer, good experience, wouldn't drink it regularly."
"I think the beer would be complimented by a little more creaminess and less carbonation but it is decent as it is. It fairly drinkable and the rich flavors didn't wear me out and i had no problem quickly finishing the whole bottle."
"A full body with an aggressive, somewhat crisp mouthfeel. Not quite smooth enough to be creamy. I thought they nailed the chocolate addition in this beer. I expected a sweet chocolate bomb but was surprised when I got a dry, somewhat bitter dark chocolate flavor like an imperial stout would have. I felt this beer combines the smooth and mellow characteristics of an aged stout with the more aggressive hops and mouthfeel of a fresher one."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Pours a thick and hearty dark chocolate brown with a dark tan thick head. This beer produces I'd say average lacing to it. Smell is very nice, very sweet, perfect to pair with dessert or even have for dessert. Smell of chocolate, but not overly chocolaty. It almost smells like a chocolate flavored liquorish if that makes any sense at all. Coffee aroma hints, maybe even more of an espresso scent. It's extremely well balanced aroma. Taste is also very nice. Tastes of blended dark, rich chocolate and nuances of coffee/espresso. It's very rich and sweet, almost like it should be a cake, I guess it could be the yeast playing that role. There is also an aftertaste of a little bit of hop, it burps up a little. All in all it's a very well balanced flavor. The mouthfeel is very nice. Full bodied smooth and rich with a perfect carbonation level. This is a very drinkable beer, perfect sipper."
"M/D: Middle of the road carbonation nicely places itself between a traditional Blegian and a traditional stout. Silky finish with some malty dryness that may be augmented by the cocoa. Slightly heavy and a bit warm, this was a very enjoyable beer. As stated before, the spice and chocolate work nicely together. Despite the lower level of chocolate that expected, I would definitely buy this again."
"Pours a dark brown with a big brown head with decent retention, but nothing amazing. Smells of chocolate malt, cocoa, and some common Belgian spiciness. Taste is not as strong as I had heard. It's like a laid-back young's double chocolate with some clove and cinnamon-like spice. Mouthfeel is this and bubbly. Pretty drinkable, the taste wasn't amazing, but a 750 is fine for one person."
"Overall this beer did not give me what I expected. I was hoping for a more chocolate flavor and not such burntness. I was expecting a chocolate covered raisins or prunes but just tastes like kissing a smoker. I won't pick this one up again."
"D: Great brew by Ommegang, but I wouldn't say that the taste suits the name well."
"O: full, complex, dark with burn but balanced, fantastic smooth stout, darker than my taste but a very good belgian stout"
"D: This beer is not as sweet as I anticipated, and the chocolate is very subtle. It pairs very well with dark chocolate and chocolate dessert, but alone, it's alittle disappointing. Given the high price of this, it's hard to justify buying more than one a season, though it's still a fantastic beer."
"The taste is a bit complex with lots going on. The key is to let the beer settle in a bit. The beer is definitely creamy and some of the sharper metallic yeastiness that other reviewers commented on seems to fade a bit as things settle in. The dark malts, the chocolate, the creaminess, and the tangy yeastiness define this beer. There is a slight booziness lurking underneath, there is some leafy hop popping through that dries this beer out in parts. There is some metallic and tinny flavors that do detract somewhat. There is a raw yeastiness to the beer that detracts as well. The chocolate and bittering dark malts are quite nice, blend nicely with the thick creaminess of the beer. The mouthfeel is quite pronounced. It is a bit oily, a bit prickly, drying, and biting a bit. The aftertaste is about right, enough to let you know you've had a substantial stout, not too lingering though. There is a touch of the boozy imperial type stout in this beer, and I'm less enamored with that part of the beer. Overall, it is a nice beer, not brilliant, but quite enjoyable."
"It is highly drinkable for both sweeter beer lovers, and those liking more robust coffee like flavors."
"I really missed this beer, and was so excited to have it again. Although, this time, I was disappointed with the tinny, metallic taste. Better luck next time. Can't wait to re-review it."
"..."
"thanks to the mill tavern in montoursville, pa for putting this on tap. a nice winter treat."
"D: Drinkable, needs a good pairing though, perhaps something fruity?"
"Cheers!"
"this is worth a try, but i don't think i'd buy it again. another great brew by ommegang, but should be priced a bit better."
"This is a 7.0%abv beer, but it drinks like it's only about 4.0%. Very easy to consume. I'm glad that Ommegang is finally available in Oklahoma, as I think that they produce some damn fine beers. This is certainly one of them."
"Pours jet black and completely opaque. Beautiful pillowy tan head. Smells very roasty with a lot of yeast in there as well. Also some subtle hints of dark chocolate. Mmm, wonderfully roasty and toasty stout taste. Roasted malt and coffee bean flavors dominate, but there are hints of bitter cocoa in the background. Also seems to have a slight mustiness to the flavor that may be the yeast strain. This is a full bodied beer, but the mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, if a little bit sticky at the end. I find this to be quite drinkable. Granted it is a bit rich, but it has a nice smoothness and hides the alcohol well. A nice surprise that came with my Ommegang gift set, and a beer I may not have tried otherwise."
"D: Not overbearing. Not as chocolately as I had hoped, but I did like the anise/clove finish."
"Drinkability: This beer is very interesting. A nice depth of chocolate flavors and a pleasure to drink."
"Pours a jet black color, with a two finger caramel/mocha head. A swirl of the glass leaves good lacing. Rich roasted malt flavors and bittersweet chocolates. Alcohol is present on the finish, but not unpleasant. Medium body. All-in-all really drinkable for the style. Heavy enough to remind you its a stout, but not so much that the entire glass makes you miserable. Didnt get the belgium twist that i expected from Ommegang, but still a great brew."
"Medium-bodied, no grain from the sediment/yeast (I did pour carefully...) but yeah, it's easily drinkable and not too heavy."
"Into a snifter, it poured a deep mahogany brown with two fingers of beige head that laced very well. Smelled solidly of dark chocolate and molasses. The taste confirmed the aroma, with the alcohol content well-hidden, while the mouthfeel was superb...creamy and velvety. Excellent sipping beer with a creamy dessert, but not exactly a session beer."
"Drinkability is excellent - flavorful, fantastic mouthfeel, not wearing at all - very nice beer. Not at all a chocolate bomb like ST Choklat, for example, but it doesn't try to be. What it is is a nicely made beer."
"Overall this was a bit of a disappointment, but it is by no means a bad beer just the name sets itself up for so much more. Worth a Look."
"The feel is medium, drinkability is nice."
"Poured a dark viscous black into a Chimay glass with a little less than a single-finger sandy brown head which a sheet of lacing through the duration of the drink. Aroma is roasted grain, chocolate, a bit of caramel sweetness, burnt toast, some dark fruits emerge as it warms in my glass. Mouthfeel is nice and slick on the tounge without being too heavy, though I was surprised by the amount of carbonation. Taste is caramel sweetness in the front with toast, toffee, a bit of char, then a suggestion of dark chocolate which does not overpower. Drinkability will get a high score despite the 750 ml serving size - if I ever found this on tap I wouldn't be able to stay away from it. Overall this is a great brew that doesn't hit me over the head with chocolate; I plan on trying it again sometime."
"Drink: Though it does sit between to styles, this beer is pretty damn tasty, and a nice treat. Goes down easier than I thought it would (going by the name). Its not a chocolate bar in a bottle, but a drinkable homage to chocolate in Belgian tradition."
"Really enjoyed this, a well-balanced beer with a nice dark chocolate flavor that is integrated nicely."
"Overall, a well-crafted beer. I'd expect a bit more chocolate umph, given the name. But I think this is right in line with Ommegang's portfolio of well-crafted, one-off brews."
"I had this ale on New Years Day and it was perfect for the cold weather and special occasion. As I started this review, I was impressed that Chocolate Indulgence is categorized as a Strong Dark Ale despite being labeled as a Stout, because I thought it had more of the fruitiness and bitterness of a dark ale. It was oe of the best I've ever had, because it toned down the malty sweetness of typical Belgian Ales."
"Drinkability: Overall, very drinkable and worth trying, it was just as expected, no disappointments."
"Pours black with an off-white head. The aroma is not as chocolatey as I expected, but you do get some sweetness. The flavor is pretty hoppy, possibly some Pacific Northwest hops. Not as much chocolate as I expected in the flavor either. I drank the second half of the beer when eating some Ghiradelli chocolates and that really made the hops stand out. Thinner mouthfeel than expected. A pretty good beer, but the name is a little misleading since this is not much of a chocolate beer."
"The creamy finish is complemented with a moderatley high carbonation, and only a slightly sweet body. Very easy to drink, it's an easy 750 to put back by yourself for a special occasion."
"Overall a great chocolate beer from Ommegang. The flavor was exceptional and at a good price. Loved it."
"OVERALL: A nice chocolate stout for sure, but not necessarily better than any of the other top chocolate stouts I've had. One worth having once, and the pretty bottle is worth keeping, but given the heavy price tag, I don't think I'll be looking for this one again."
"Overall, an excellent chocolate beer. If you're expecting something really rich and chocolatey like Young's Double Chocolate Stout then this doesn't really fit the bill, but its dry, dark chocolate character crossed with Belgian-style stout really hits the spot for me."
"Pours a dark brown body with a tan head that leaves minor lacing. A roasted and cocoa malt aroma dominates the nose; very little other malts coming through. Smooth, medium bodied beer that has a good amount of roasted and bitter chocolate taste that leaves it syrupy/sticky at times. Definite sipper, this is a sweet beer that isn't overly sweet but balanced and warms the tongue up even with a clean finish."
"D: A decent brew. Tastes like you would expect a typical chocolate stout to taste. Another respectable effort by Ommegang."
"salud!"
"D - Fantastic delicious stouty belgian dark. A MUST try for any fan of stouts."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: Great light carbonation makes this almost too easy to drink. Its a well balanced stout that doesnt overdo anything."
"Drinkability is decent at best. Very disappointing."
"All and all left me wanting more,not as thick,rich,or chocolatey as you'd want from a good stout."
"This is my kind of stout, and my kind of chocolate beer. I've found that some examples can come across as artificial or heavy handed, but that's not the case here, and a wonderful balance has been struck. Good stuff!"
"Had this on daft a while back and it was a lot better. this time it was poured with a very nice light tan head and plenty of lace. Color is opaque dark brown. Aroma was faintly bittersweet and of cocoa. Flavor is less than the aroma would have you think. Shallow. Body is ok. There's not a whole lot here. Body is ok and carbonation is decent. Strange, because the draft version I had a while back was so rich. Finish is fairly short and forgettable. Maybe it was an off bottle or batch."
"D= Really delicious but nothing amazing. I prolly wont buy this again but that doesn't mean its bad. I can find better chocolate beers than this like Youngs chocolate stout is an example of something better. Not bad at all though."
"Very little carbonation, which is good. Creamy, dark chocolates and espresso, roasted malts. Pretty solid. Not too thick in the mouth, so easy not bad for drinkability. Leaves a little bitterness on the back of the tongue which is expected from a stout, but not harsh at all."
"D- Pretty drinkable. Not at all hot and not too heavy. A bit cloying at times, however."
"Taste: Roasted coffee and cocoa. The cocoa powder is very noticeable and overpowering, but in a good way. Aftertaste kind of reminds me of toasted marshmallows."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax, poured into a 3 philosophers glass. Pinky of beige head slowly fades away leaving pleasant soapy lacing on the glass. Aroma is of coffee, chocolate and caramel, a very delicious aroma. Taste is roasty, toasty, malty and delicious. A very smooth stout, perfect for any cold weather situation. Paired amazingly well with some sort of hazelnut crumb cake with vanilla icing and coconut shavings. I'm now ready for Christmas."
"I'm not in love with stouts like I used to be but I would drink this again for sure."
"Very good. Not as much chocolate as the name would indicate. Definitely stir up the sediment more than the directions indicate for full flavor."
"Perfect carbonation level (and I'm a stickler). Not very chocolatey. Some nice roasted malt. Assertive Chimay-style Belgian esters of brown sugar? Some alcohol. Essentially, a Belgian Trappist-style robust porter. I could make a better chocolate beer than this."
"This beer is definitely a lot less sweet than you would think with a name like ""Chocolate Indulgence," but it doesn't matter because it's still really good. It's very smooth and creamy, and the chocolate malt is a highlight. Addictive brew."
"Drinkability: No richness. You could drink it but I have no interest in doing so; at least the chocolate cake slice was excellent. Such a fancy bottle too. Average it was and average score it gets."
"2007 vintage- pours a very dark brown with a foamy chocolate milk like head. Nose- medium roast and dark chocolate. Taste- sweet dark fruits, candi sugar, bitter roast. Was expecting more chocolate- its noticable, but not in forefront. Getting somewhat oxidized. Finish has a somewhat sour/tart character and a bit chalky."
"D - Not nearly as filling as most stouts and but still heavy in nature."
"Sample at the Most Honorable SuperHappyFun Stout Tasting. Pours opaque black with a medium tan head that recedes steadily. Thin rings of lacing on the glass. The aroma is chocolate and dark malts. Medium-bodied and smooth with flavors of chocolate, roasted malt and anise. Smooth finish with lingering chocolate malt aftertaste. Overall this beer definitely suffered a bit by being sampled after Choklit Indulgence. Decent, but not really something I would seek out again."
"Ommegang's 10th Anniversary Stout seemed like a good choice to celebrate my 100th beer review. Black with a big tan head that leaves a thick lace as it retreats to a thin tan cover. Aroma of cocoa, roasted malt and at times yeast and/or licorice. The mouthfeel starts medium light with moderate carbonation, becoming more creamy as the CO2 falls off. The taste has a fleeting malt sweetness up front that dries out nicely, almost chalky, with a slightly tart and sometimes metalic aftertaste. It was a nice sipping beer that lasted me throughout most of Game 2 of World Series 09. The final pour of my 750 ml seemed much smoother, but with a slightly bitter finish. Of course, it was warmest at that point too. A nice beer, but not exactly what you might expect from the lable."
"Overall, I think Ommegang has done a fantastic job with this beer. If you are looking for a chocolate stout and can still find this one, then I would highly recommend picking it up."
"As far as strong darks go, this one has some of the character I can identify in others of its category, but for sure with more chocolate presence: a personal favorite, but also an upstanding member of its kind."
"Poured into a chalice pours a pitch black with a tannish head, not much lace on the glass. Smell is chocolate not overwhelming but subtle and to the point. Taste is a bit thin, I can taste chocolate but not strong enough like I was hoping for. I was expecting strong malt and choclate combo but was dissapointed in this offering, which was lacking for such a strong brewery."
"Drinkability- Smooth, chunky and delicious."
"I like Ommegang, and am glad to support them, but do not think this is one of their better offerings. Perhaps my bottle has seen it's prime already, as it is a 10-Year Anniversary Edition (1997 - 2007)."
"On the palate, it opens with a mild chocolate note, with cocoa, some roasted malt, Mildly sweet, with sugar and a little molasses. Finishes medium dry with a licorice like bitterness. A touch of metallic character is present. Medium in body, moderate carbonation, and decent finish. Surprisingly good, would drink again."
"O- I'm a bit let down by its name, This was a very good stout but its missing the chocolate indulgence."
"Ok so very decent beer, but I thought the chocolate was a bit overdone. Appearance good, nice and dark with a slight tan head with no real lacing. Smell is good, smell like dark chocolate and that is pretty much it. I pick up a bit of coffee and very slight hops. Taste is decent but an odd bitter that I cant make up my mind on. Mouthfeel was very good, medium to heavy with perfect carbonation. Drinkability was good."
"Mouthfeel was warm and thick"
"Overall this had a bit more fruit than I remembered from the bottle version and I think that added a new level to things. It's still not quite as good as some of Ommegang's other offerings but it's worth a shot."
"This beer is definitely all I expected it to be. A little spendy but worth it if you like chocolate stouts. Ommegang does not disappoint. Dark pour with nice head. Not too much carbonation and a great heavy but smooth and somewhat creamy chocolate flavor. Easy to drink and hard to share. I would recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys the type and for any occasion."
"A very pleasant, drinkable, complex and robust beer. As much as those adjectives are probably often conflicting, this paradox of a beer manages to be at once confronting and comforting. It pulls you away with the right, and draws you in with the left. Very good."
"Actually I think this is a bit lacking overall. Just from the look I expected a big, bold bastard of a stout - instead I'm getting stout characters that seems to be hiding in the background and never leaping forward with their dark, evil flavour potential. Oddly enough this feels heavy without actually tasting so. There's flavour potential that it never lives up to."
"Drinkability: Its a great tasting stout with Belgian leanings. Way more stout character, and just hints of the Belgian-ness. I really enjoyed it, and continue to assert that at some time, my favorite beer will be a strong stout made with Belgian yeast. This is not quite there. I certainly liked it, and would drink it again, but not for $12."
"Poured dark brown with a generous, light brown head that reduced to a thin covering. Great chocolate aroma. The taste, true to scent, is rich chocolate. I have to revert back to my childhood chocoholic days for the proper word to describe: Yummy. Feel is a little lighter than I had expected with reasonable carbonation. Drinkability: This one is to rich to be anything but a sipper. I am usually not a huge fan of Belgian strong ales, but the chocolate made the difference."
"[Sampled at the 2009 Flower City Brewers' Fest at Frontier Field, Rochester, NY]"
"(D)- Rich and delicious with some serious chocolate flavors. A great tasting beer that could replace dessert any day of the week. Almost too rich to drink the whole 750mL on your own though; share with a friend or two."
"A Belgian style beer with a strong cocoa flavor? Seems odd, right? Don't be scared. This beer is quite good. There is definitely some Belgian influence here - a slight sugary sweetness is present in the front, but the finish is big, bitter cocoa. Strong chocolate flavor should be expected given the dark color and the luscious tan head. A nice treat - not something to drink all of the time, but a nice change of pace. Recommended."
"Oily ebony brownish black, opaque for all intents and purposes, with a thick coffee-stained cap of fine foam that doesn't last as long as you might hope of a Belgian ale. Gorgeous aromas of coconut, chocolate, and vanilla come pouring out of the glass, with pecan, honey, cola, and coffee notes in tow. A surprising edge of woody oak rims the edge of the nose. Rich and thick on the palate, full of chocolate and vanilla with a bitterness of espresso and burnt caramel. There is also an herbal quality to it, reminiscent of licorice or root beer. Rolling carbonation keeps this smooth and lush, and although this is very thick and creamy, the finish is quite dry and clean, with a lingering tang of bittersweet cocoa. Lovely and flavorful, not as chocolatey as some chocolate stouts, but easy to overindulge in."
"Purchased from Otto's Wine Cask in Brown Deer, WI. Pours a deep black body with a light tan head. Aroma of sweet chocolate. Full bodied and kind of creamy with medium carbonation, this beer has a roasted dark chocolate flavor. A bit more roasted flavor than I'd like, this beer seemed to get tiresome towards the end of the glass."
"It was deep deep brown with almost 2 finger cream head. Picture perfect. It smelled of a roasted toffee chocolate with light fruit notes. The taste wasnt what I expected but was delicious. It was of a sweet cream and almost roasted nutty flavor. I was amazed. Delicious. The mouthfeel was a bit thin and carbonated for my liking esepccialy for a stout but the flavor made up for it. Very drinkable, especially as an after dinner drink or right before bed."
"All in all, excellent drinkability. Not too strong, well balanced flavors, good strong chocolate backbone. Glad I could share this brew with my girlfriend and looking forward to trying this one out again sometime soon."
"This beer has been sitting for a long while in my basement. The carbonation is on like it should be. There's just too much of the metallics to make this beer worth another buy. I have a soft spot for Ommegang and love most of their beer but this one seemed to be a miss. I wouldn't turn it down but I wouldn't buy more either."
"It's got a rich mouthfeel, but the 750 ml bottle must be shared--I could never finish it myself."
"Conclusion: I've tried this two different years now...it's not bad at alll, but just a bit plain...it's not up to the standards (the very high standards) of Ommegang's other beers, and while it makes for a pretty tasty stout or export stout, it's not chocolatey indulgence good like the label suggests...the chocolate is actually quite hard to find...I've had chocolate stouts which use ONLY chocolate malts and no chocolate with a bigger chocolate character than there is here...that all said, it's not a bad beer."
"The chocolate makes the stout different but not better. If you like dark chocolate or are looking for something different in a stout then give this a try."
"D- Great chocolate flavor but definitely not sweet, I wish it hard a higher alcohol percentage and slightly sweeter. The overall flavor is pretty darn good, but it's still an occasional beer for me, not to mention it's kinda pricey."
"Not nearly as good as I was hoping here..."
"Light bodied, roasty cocoa flavor. So roasty that it is almost bittersweet chocolaty, approaching coffee-esque. I am enjoying this one better than the fresh bottle I had, it seems the 10 months in the cellar were beneficial. The dark plum-like fruitiness is almost too prevalent and takes away a bit from the chocolate. There are some nice bready yeast characteristics here that work nicely and there is just a touch of grassy hops to add to the complex mix of flavors. This beer gets better with warming, nearly right up to room temperature. I like it, it is not what you think of upon just the title of the beer though, the chocolate is really just a team player here as many other components are just as noticeable."
"Very drinkable. I was expecting a sipper, but this one went down almost too easily. A lot of chocolate beers taste artificial to me, but this was the real deal. Very enjoyable!"
"D - Ehhh. This was a bit of a let down for me. I was thinking big chocolately monster of a beer. Instead I got a thin, wispy hint of chocolate on an otherwise ordinary ale. Not very stout-like except for the color. Overall, I was left feeling underwhelmed. I wouldn't refuse this beer if someone gave it to, but it wouldn't be my first choice either."
"Pours a jet black with a large tan frothy head. Lots of lacing,makes this a real nice looking beer. The smell is pungent with roasted malt,dark fruits,and chocolate. The taste is very complicated,with a full mixture of flavors. Roasted malt,cocoa,dark fruits,and alcohol make this a very nice brew. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing well. A very good beer that should not be passed up."
"Glad I tried it - certainly interesting. Sensational? Maybe, hard to say by the almost unclassifiable style."
"A great desert/after dinner beer. You'll want to savor this one."
"taste is creamy, dark chocolate, some coffee, touch of vanilla, touch of licorice, and oats in the back, ends dry and a little bitter."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer due to how well it hides the alcohol and its smaller body. I would definitely buy this beer again. I mean wow this is an enjoyable drink."
"Overall, this is a fairly good beer and it is enjoyable. I do with the taste would have been stiffer because the chocolate flavors could be even more highlighted. Either way, still quite drinkable and good."
"T: A mellow combination of roasted malt and more bitter than sweet chocolate (much like the aroma). At the end there's a dry, lingering bittersweetness like dark chocolate that stays long after you've swallowed. Really, not as much flavor or sweetness as I would have expected."
"D - A respectable offering that builds up your expectations with stellar appearance and scent, but fails to deliver in all other categories..."
"Final Thought: This was just short of 4.5's across the board and it had everything to do with carbonation... so close to a classic!"
"D- I'm not sure if I would really think of this beer as chocolaty if the bottle didn't have it written all over the label, and the taste and aroma are a bit thin with only the bitterness really coming through the flavor."
"Very drinkable and a good beer but don't know if I would go for the chocolate indulgence name. After seeing it and reading the bottle I was almost expecting a chocolate milkshake, and did not get one. If that's what you're going for look for ST choklat, youngs or Stones bittersweet"
"This one pours a dark brown with a lumpy tan head. Smells of chocolate and smoke. Tastes of charred malt, smoke, and chocolate, in that order. A little out of whack, since chocolate is not the most predominant flavor except on the label. Mouthfeel is quite thin for anything with the word 'stout' on the label, more like a porter. A pleasant and drinkable beer, but doesn't live up to the name or the style."
"D - VERY drinkable. I don't see myself getting tired of this one."
"D - For a richer stout, it's extremely drinkable. The 750 ml bottle was split but I could take one out myself. MmmMmm good!"
"Pretty easy drinking, but certainly not something to be drinking as a session ale."
"Feel and Drinkability: Right up front there is a bit of spritz, really quite nice. After that the beer becomes seemingly less carbonated, though its really just a deception. All in all the carbonation is just right for this one. Body is medium-heavy and leaves a slick feeling on the palate. I really can't fault this one for anything. I could be a bit heavier, making it more of a sipper, but hey, nobody's perfect. The only complaint is that it goes down to easy, to quick. It makes it to easy to drink fast giving way to less enjoyment. This is one I'd definitely buy again, however, the only way I can get this one in my waters is in a gift set with glass, Hennepin, and Three Philosophers...Hey it might be worth the $19 to get all three bottles and a glass each time I want this beer."
"Dark beer with a nice light brown head. Definitely has a strong chocolate smell. Some beers mingle with chocolate, but this is the most chocolate like smell I've had. The taste is good, but not great. Nothing stand out too much. It reminds me of a lighter stout with a wisp of chocolate flavor. I feel like all stouts have some chocolate hints but this one is a bit bolder. The mouthfell is pretty good. The flavor does develop a little in the aftertaste. This is a drinkable beer. It's got a bold flavor, so I would mix it up with some other styles, but I could down a few in a sitting."
"Final Thoughts - I was glad I got to try this beer. I love the Ommegang brewery and hold it in high regard. I was excited to get this bottle for $7 instead of $15, but this anniversary release was not my favorite. This was a good attempt by Ommegang but overall the beer didn't stand out like Ommegang usually does. Give it a try if you like the brewery, but there are definitely better chocolate stouts to be had."
" much to contribute to that. Mild bodied, with effervescent carbonation. Finishes dry, with a cocoa powder flavor."
"Notes - I've had more indulgent chocolate beers, but this one isn't bad."
"Great stuff. Very drinkable, and I liked this compared to other chocolate stouts as it's not very sweet compared to some other interpretations of this style. Very well-done."
"mouth is thick and bitter with nothing else to really speak of. I think this will be the only one I buy but it's good enough to consider."
"Drinkability: Not bad...nothing like I was expecting..way more of a belgian strong than a choclate experience like Young's or Southern tier's Chocolat...Not bad, but also not worth the big price"
"Nice but not special. Young's or Rogue's do better for chocolate. Don't see the Belgian influence here; not up to the reputation of this brewer. Goes down easy, but is it worth the price ($10!) or effort?"
"Overall: not as chocolaty as expected, pretty easy to drink, alcohol is present in smell and taste"
"All in all a creamy, desert-like chocolate stout, but kinda boring and bland for a big bottle, cork and all."
"Drinkability is only so-so here. Not enough punch for Judy.IYAMD"
"D: This would be excellent if they could tweak it a bit to add more heft to it. Very nice appearance and smell, then it tails off. Still quite drinkable and certainly worth a try. Nice to see Ommegang putting out some new offerings."
"You can really really taste the real chocolate."
"Poured slowly into a Chimay glass, plenty of yeast particles suspended in a very, very dark brown beer. Mocha-tan head was about a finger at pouring but settled with a cloudy, wispy film atop the glass, solid ring and exemplary lacing. Carbonation did not seem to be much in evidence but a swirl reproduced a healthy head over the surface of the glass. Smell of sweet cocoa, chocolate malt milkshake. Taste was rich and layered with cocoa and semi-sweet chocolate but an unsettling bitter middle and slightly astrigent swallow stopped me in my tracks. Long lasting, lingering choco-malt echoes were alternately pleasing and distracting. As with the taste, the mouthfeel was also a bit schizo with silky smooth and creamy notes contrasted with what seemed to be an unwelcome alcohol presence or a yeasty, malty twitch. I found that this beer had a lot of potential but somehow the whole was lesser than the sum of its parts, there was something that seemed to keep it off-balance somehow, making what could be a truly great beer - as one would expect from the name on the label - into merely a good beer. Would I try this again? Sure, I'd love to, but I'd also like to cellar it for a year and see what happens."
"If you're going to call something ""chocolate indulgence"" then it better be indulgently chocolaty. This wasn't bad but a word of advice to anyone looking for true chocolate indulgence: try Southern Tier Choklat, Rogue Chocolate Stout, or Young's Double Chocolate. Those are some extravagant, gratifying chocolaty treats! For making both such good chocolates and beer, the Belgians have inspired a pretty mediocre chocolate stout."
"This one was enjoyable, but not quite as expected. Far more roasted and almost coarse. Not nearly as smooth or balanced as anticipated. Drinkable indeed - I had no problem finishing the bottle - but left a little something to be dessired."
"D - I was really unimpressed with this beer, if you want to call the beer Chocolate Indulgence do not make me go on a treasure hunt for the chocolate taste"
"D: I can't say that it isn't undrinkable, but this is very rich and heavy. And sweet. One 750 is more than enough. Good beer to share though."
"i supremely enjoyed this. worth the money, for sure."
"I really enjoyed this beer and it's enjoyability. Belgian chocolate and Belgian ale go great together. Go figure."
"Really Enjoyed this brew. Picked it out at my local liquor store in Warsaw, Indiana. This brew is dark with a nice bubbly foam head. Leaves a nice spider web on the glass. Aromas of roasted and chocolate malts. Tastes of dark chocolate and roasted malts. Not to thick on the mouth and with that dark chocolate sweetness. Drinkable for a good dessert brew or specialty. Goes great with brownies or fudge!!"
"It's only 7% so I don't know how it would age but I might be willing to find out what 2 more years adds."
"Warning: unavoidable joy to rate this beer... impenatrable black body filling out a Victory HopDevil nonick glass... substantial brown head laces as close to perfection as my pencil will allow.... thick, dense chocolate aroma reaches out from the table in front of me... fresh malts are also present.... soft milky toastedness settles the nostrils--I could SMELL this beer all night.... intense heat at the throat retreats, allowing a medium-bodied, slightly effervescent body to present comfortably... chocolate taste indeed--with subtle dairy and toasted flavors--some light esthers lift the weight... these Ommegang brewers do little wrong--I've ordered enough glassware from them to prove my appreciation!--and the Chocolate Indulgence is what it promises... for 7.0% ABV, unbelievably drinkable and character-laden..."
"D= Not a bad beer because of bad flavors, its more of a mediocre beer due to a lack of flavor. If you are goiing to call a beer Chocolate Indulgence, it needs to be decadent, or at least interestingly flavorful. This was a big disappointment."
"overall impression - was let down, looking for more complexity and structure, chocolate didn't come through for me given its name, i like my stouts darker, oilier, richer, and more complex"
"Of the three ""chocolate"" stouts I've tried lately, I'd rank them Southern Tier, Ommegang, and Rogue in that order."
"Notes: This is a Stout? Sure in the hell doesn't feel like it. There's decent chocolate flavors here, but just not enough of it. Maybe a bigger, more robust malt character, and a fuller, more creamy body would have done it justice. They're going for delicate subtlety here, and while there is some good potential, it just completely fails as far as I'm concerned. I'm very disappointed with this one."
"D: Wonderful idea. The Belgian style yeast makes this much more drinkable than many a regular stout."
"Drinkability is moderate. The flavor profile is kind of boring, but the beer isn't unpallateable. For me, there's not enough chocolate, and not enough stout. I understand that Ommegang does Belgian style beers, but as a chocolate stout this beer fell flat on it's face. If I rate it as a Belgian strong dark, it also doesn't even come close to others in the category. This one needs work."
"I actually had Obamagang (Inauguration Ale) before I had this one, and I feel this one takes a slight edge. The chocolate is a bit stronger and the roasty malts dominate. Very little of the standard Belgian characteristics make it into this one. Smooth and complex, and a very tasty beer. Recommended."
"Too thin by half: I would appreciate a more significant malt profile. I don't remember exactly how I felt about it in the bottle, but on tap I thought it was carbonated well enough and imparted a pleasant richness to the palate. Not a bad stout, but it seems insubstantial somehow."
"D = Something I would have no problem drinking again, but would preferably have a port wine instead."
" CHEERS!"
"Initial reaction: A lot rougher than I was anticipating. Chocolate flavor is chalky, and is far more bitter than I would have liked to seen. For me, it goes from bitter chocolate, all the way down to nothing. The whole thing is smoky more than creamy or rich. Once that flavor goes, it just thins out completely. Mouthfeel is kind of chunky and abrasive, in that I was expecting something silky smooth. This also considering that mouthfeel and overall bearing are pretty light. This is a little more like rough wool. It maintains decent drinkability considering thanks to the low ABV, but for me, this is just too one dimensional, where I expected something slinkier and more robust. Strip away the chocolate, and I'm left with a mainstream stout with nothing behind it. It's not terrible, but I certainly expected more."
"D: Yes, this is drinkable for the style. A nice after dinner drink for sure but not only for such an occasion."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, for all the hype Ommegang gets and for this beer in particular, I don't think it was well-deserved. I was definitely not impressed with this beer at all."
"Drinkability- Hard to finish the whole one to myself.."
"Anyway, I really enjoyed this and would get it again if it were available. Don't necessarily back off thinking that the reviewers aren't getting any chocolate. I found it to be the prominent flavor."
"Drinkability: I'm really not sure how to rate this one. I was definitely disappointed by this beer - it wasn't bad per se, but not at all what I was expecting. It was very one-dimensional, and there wasn't much depth of flavor. I kept hoping it would get better as it warmed, but it just didn't. It smelled and looked great, but the taste just didn't live up to it."
"More Belgian than stout, this certainly has agreeable characteristics from each. I'd be curious if that carbonation could be mellowed by aging it. Lots of possibilities here, good stuff."
"very good desert beer and overall a good brew; chocolaty and malty taste and smell that accents the chocolate, but then leaves a bitter aftertaste. A lot of sediment in the beer adds complex flavors and pours an impressive head, but the malty ending takes away from the chocolate that starts the beer off so well."
"Mouthfeel is very light...perhaps too light for a Chocolate Indulgence Stout. I assumed it would be rich and thick."
"d - one bottle is enough for the evening. but very enjoyable to drink."
"After reading a few of the other reviews, I should have found something to go with this beer instead of drinking it by himself."
"D - Cannot simply be enjoyed on its own. Too bitter from cocoa powder to be tolerated without some strong cheese on crackers. Will not purchase again."
"taste: its smokey and not sweet at all like you'd expect buying this type of beer without knowing anything about it. i can't say i'm dissappointed though, but with a name like chocolate indulgance there should be more chocolate prevelent. i like the usual roasted malt and coffee characteristics of the this stout and that it's reserved with it's chocolate flavors doesnt really upset me, just leaves me wanting more."
"Pretty good, smooth, mouthfeel, and very drinkable. Could not detect any alcohol. It's a good brew, that's for sure, but falls a little short in the ""indulgence"" category."
"Drinkability -- pretty good stout. I would think a belgian stout would have more sweetness. It does have that Belgian yeast flavor. Chocolate is a little too low to be indulgent."
"D- Easy to drink, nice and smooth, not too sweet yet gives just the right amount of sweetness."
"Overall it was a rather nice beer, wasn't out of the park but very good. Quite enjoyable and easy to drink."
"D: Was hoping for more chocolate but still delicious and drinkable. Definitely would get again."
"Smooth mouthfeel, very dry - especially as it warmed up even more. It is not necessary creamy, however. It's medium-heavy bodied, leaning more towards the medium side. It's a good sipper, you need to enjoy it slowly to catch all of the different aspects and flavors of this beer. It's kind of hard to classify this beer as it has aspects of a Belgian dark, Stout, and even a porter. But overall, a solid brew throughout and definitely worth picking up."
"this beer pours a dark chocolate color with a caramel head that fades to lacing leaving a nice trail on the glass. the fails to really leap out at you, but there is a nice amount of chocolate roasted malt aroma. the real belgian chocolate isn't overwhelming at all, maybe it's well balanced with the malt bill, but I could stand a bit more. the dry finish with the belgian yeast esters leads nicely into the full body with the low carbonation. a very quaffable beverage..."
"D..As a stout, above good. As ""Chocolate Indulgence", average. I wouldn't have a lot of this simply because I would be expecting more chocolate than was delivered."
"d. Moderate. A good overall beer who's charm is in it's subtleties. Not very impressive for the price, however."
"This beer poured in to my pint glass a dark opaque brown. It was almost black there were brown bubbles that filled the body at first to would form a thin layer of head over the beer's body. The lace was actually pretty nice considering the lack of head. Its aroma was fruity and candy like. You could smell the chocolate but it was more of a fruit candy aroma. The mouthfeel is sort of sticky and thick but honestly it goes down smooth. It has bitter dark chocolate taste with a bit of a burnt mild fruity flavor. It is an alright after dinner beer."
"Overall, a good but not great beer from a great brewery. Happy 10th! I'll stick to and enjoy the regulars from them. This is a one and done for me. It's not one of my favorite styles so I'll leave it up to you on worth trying or not."
"D - Not the best example by far. Drinkable, but lacks a certain chocolate feel and is very dry for a stout to me, must be the belgian yeast, but just my taste. I think Allagash black taste more like chocolate than this. I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."
"D: A nice combination of mouthfeel and taste made this beer pretty good. A pretty solid, stout-like brew by a brewery who has traditionally brewed solely Belgian ales."
"Its not what I was expecting from a chocolate stout."
"Full mouthfeel and very drinkable. What is to be expected from Ommegang."
"Finally got to try this beer. A good, but not great beer. Poured in a snifter, the beer was very dark brown/black, with a thick tan head that retained well. Some lacing. Aroma of cocoa and biscuit. Nice chocolate taste, with a bready background. Finishing bitterness. Would probably try it again."
"I'm glad I shared it with my cousin and my sister, because I could not have drunk it all by myself."
"Very nice chocolate stout. Nice look in a standard Belgian glass: dark chocolate color sporting a lovely dark tan head with good lacing but moderate retention, and a bit of yeast cloudiness from the unfiltered nature of this brew. Subtle malty nose. On the palate, this is smooth and mildly chocolaty, but with a sophisticated chocolate taste. Semi-thick mouthfeel, about right for this style, but with pronounced carbonation. Nice bitter finish, and good drinkability for a strong ale."
"Pours nearly opaque black with tan head. Nose has a plastic-like chocolate aroma, reminding me of those chocolate bunnies that came in white plastic packaging at Easter. Palate is certainly in the milk chocolate direction (not dark chocolate), but somehow lacks much of the pleasant sweetness that chocolate usually has. Light carbonation, and some alcohol presence on the finish."
"Pours chocolate colored with a thick chocolate marshmallow head. Smells of sweet malt chocolate. Taste reminded me of an imperial stout like Samuel Smith's to be exact. This beer has a thickness comperable to maple syrup. It also went down very smoothly and I wouldn't have minded having a second, and at 7.00ABV I see no good reason not to other then the fact that it's normally 13 bucks a beers. I got it as part of a gift pack for my brother for christmas and it came with a 3 philosphers and a Haipen, looking forward to sampling the haipen too."
"750 ml bottle: This one poured a very opaque, dark brown color. There was almost no head on mine. The aroma is sweet cocoa, with possibly some hints of roastiness and smokiness. The taste is definitely creamy chocolate with some roastiness. I was surprised that it is only 7%: it tastes a bit richer than that."
"Drinks pretty easy, only the dryness is holding me back, not seeing a lot of Belgian signature, drinks more like an English or American stout, I enjoyed this"
"This is enjoyable enough to be sure, but nothing I'll be going out of my way for. I'd rather Ommegang had bottled their Ommegang Rouge instead of this one. Now THAT was fantastic."
"mouthfeel is thick and creamy (yeast!), bakers chocolate is more subdued than i would prefer, lingering bitterness - not bad overall, and easy to drink"
"D - Nice for this holiday festive time of year and the ABV is in-check, so this makes for a delicious treat. Leave one out for Santa. :)"
"I poured this one after sitting on it about two months. Very dark chocolate brown with tan cotton candy like foam. If smells mildly of cocoa, fire, caramel and alcohol. As it warms the gentle bitterness and sweetness developed. Better with warming. I thinks it's important on this one."
"Aroma is fairly strong and smoky, mainly of roast coffee with hints of chocolate and a whisper of molasses. It pours an opaque sable like dark chocolate with a very thick, fine-bubbled tan head that hangs around for a while. Flavor is just simply superb, smoky and chocolaty with undertones of coffee, caramel and molasses. It is fairly sweet but not cloying, and there is a touch of hop bitterness that balances the sweetness nicely. Texture is smooth and bubbly, and it leaves a slightly sweet mocha aftertaste. Very festive, and a good dessert beer."
"7/5/6/3/16/3.7"
"D: Delightfully complex flavors; not over-chocolaty."
"8/5/7/4/14 (3.8/5)"
"Drinks very nicely with a good deal of carbonation keeping it light. No overly noticable alcohol presense. Very nice."
"Poured into hefty chalice. Poured gently so as not to create more head than is my preference. Very dark, almost solid, black with a beautiful medium brown head. Head lasts about a minute. Nice lacing as you work through the glass. The roasty aromas blend nicely with scent of chocolate. The chocolate is noticeable but not overpowering. A full, complete and satisfying mouthfeel that stays on the tongue, while not being cloying. Drinkability is very high for a stout, drinking a couple of 22s of this in a row would not be a chore at all. A well done beer that is very worthy of your time."
"Goes well with deeply chocolate desserts."
"Future outlook: Nope. Not only did the beer not come close to delivering what the name would lead one to expect, what it gave in exchange is not a pleasing surprise, nor an acceptable substitution."
"An easy drinking beer that makes you think. Hides the elevated alcohol content, too."
"Drinkability - this is not intended to be an every-day beer, and it wouldn't particularly suit every day drinking. But it is chocolaty and nice, especially as a desert beer. Would buy again, but I might not mind waiting until next year when they make more."
"This is a very pleasant beer that does not go over the top but is right down the middle."
"Pours dark brown with a short tan head. Roasty cocoa aroma with an earthy yeastiness. I expected more chocolateyness (if that is a word), but the taste was still good. The Belgian chocolate's sweetness mixed with the yeast to produce a very nice sweet-and-sour combo similar to baker's chocolate. One of the better ""Belgian"" stout's I've had."
"D - to much muskyness makes this one not an easy drinker. The flavors aren't that interesting."
"All in all, this is still a decent beer, just not one that lives up to what the label promises and the price tag demanded."
"D - I expected more chocolate flavor because of the name. Still a good Belgian ale."
"Pours a deep dark brown with huge tan foamy head. Beautiful roasted chocolate malt aroma with hints of coffee, alcohol and fruit. Roasted chocolate maltiness with hints of coffee, toffee and a well balanced alcohol pesence. Very tasty."
"D: This is not a bad beer. Its got some decent flavors and very good to have with a tasting IMO, but I think it would be a better example of a chocolate stout that was very basic. This brew is basic but quick drinkable and accessible. Not bad at all, but absolutely has room for improvement."
"I bought an Ommegang gift pack down at the Headkeeper the other night while out with some fellow co-workers. It came with three 750 ml. bottles of Ommegang Chocolate Indulgence, Three Philosophers, and Hennepin. Also included was an Ommegang glass. The Chocolate Indulgence pored into the glass with a creamy head, at least two fingers thick. There was a nice lacing along the inside of the glass that remained thought the drinking process. The aroma was laced with chocolate malts and leather. The taste was sublime. It is a mix of chocolate, hops, malt and goodness. This is definitely a beer to behold."
"D'ability - In some ways drinks larger than a 7% ABV beer, and is heavy enough that it would be a special occasion only beer for me."
"D - Overall an interesting but not spectacular beer. Worth a try but not sometihng i'd actively seek out."
"Not brewed year round, so if you see it pick it up."
"Pours black with about a 1/2"" of dark brown head. Aroma is very subdued, some malt, a bit of chocolate, and some whiffs of alcohol. Taste is mostly of some slightly bitter chocolate. There is a nice malt undertone throughout. Towards the finish there is a bit of alcohol and some darker fruits. Mouthfeel is pretty good, full bodied with low-moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. This beer isn't the greatest chocolate stout but is enjoyable although quite subdued."
"I love the tiny bubbles... The tiny Belgian bubbles... Enough of them to actually give a small head. Whoa. It's still not long lived, but it's there. And the tiny bubbles... It smells chocolaty. And then you taste it. So, bear with me... But my first taste came like eating dry cocoa powder. Bitter cocoa, if you think there's a difference, eh? As in, it's pretty dry. I was surprised at the dryness. By the end of the first snifter (a whopping 4 oz) I was very used to the dryness and even relished it - when knowing what to expect, I couldn't wait for the next taste! Good stuff. I wish it didn't cost so much..."
"D- though brewed in the belgian style, i have to review this as a stout because it shares almost no similarities with any BSDA i've ever had. its a stout, i don't care, it says it on the bottle and it sure as hell looks smells and tastes like one. and its a gooood one. chocolate flavor can get pretty intense after on glass."
"While certainly a solid stout, definitely not enough chocolate flavor to justify the name. Worthy of a try, but not one of Ommegangs best."
"Pitch black colored beer with a slow fading creamy head.Aroma is faint chocolate.Taste is chocolate and espresso.Very smooth and drinkable.A good stout but I was hoping for a bigger chocolate taste.Overall good but not worth the 15.00 I shelled out for it.Good to try at least once."
"Aroma is roasted malty, coffee, cocoa. The flavor is strong with rasted malt, cocoa, chocolate, some espersso notes, but very smooth and balanced. A nicely bitter finish doesn't overwhlem. A wonderful stout...they call it BSDA which doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but for teh fruity notes in the aroma and flavor. This brew is more a Belgian-inflected American stout--whatever it is, a great job."
"Pours a very dark black color body. Has some small tan head, but is diminishing. Flowery aroma, some dark fruits.Some chocolate too. Some alcohol.. Cigarette smoke taste. Some dark chocolate, and some bitter chocolate taste. Soft mouthfeel. Not a fan of cigarette smoke. Waxy mouthfeel. Stouty. Eh."
"750ml bottle from the liquor store in Tyngsborro, Mass. Pours an opaque dark brown/black body with around an inch of light tan head that slowly dissipates leaving some lacing. Roasty dark chocolate dominates the aroma, toasty, slightly burnt malt. Medium in body with ample carbonation. Flavor is definitely roasty and toasty, somewhat sweet, dark chocolate-like, slightly burnt, coffee... Baker's chocolate comes to mind... Dry on the finish, with roastiness dominating. Slightly smokey? Complex and roasty for sure, though not quite as chocolatey as the name would suggest IMO. Still a very solid Belgian-style stout, and one I'd definitely get again."
"Pours a thick and oily black color with a large chocolate brownie head. Mild nose of burnt malt, bitter chocolate and cream. Mostly the same notes go towards the flavor. I remember the bottles of this being more grainy and having powdery chocolate notes, none of this is apparent on draught, much more creaminess and chew going on in the mouth, better medium body IMO. Good drinkability, still not a stout thats going to change your life or anything but better than the bottles."
"D-Good drinkability. With ""chocolate"" in the name, I expected an overpowering chocolate; I was surprised when the chocolate flavors instead melded well and complimented the rest of the beer's flavors."
"D - Yes it is."
"Pretty darn enjoyable!"
"Overall its an ok stout, but if you are expecting anything the likes of black albert, sloth, etc. you will be VERY dissapointed. An ok beer, but nothing i will be purchasing again. ok beer."
"I enjoyed it but is far from worth what my room mate paid for it, 13.99. I will not be paying that."
"This is a good beer, but I am not wild about it. Just doesn't quite strike a chord with me. Interesting release, and certainly worth a try."
"D: very good. very drinkable"
"Chocolate indulgence is good, but I think better can be had for less money than I spent on this bottle."
"was very easy to drink and was pleasing in all aspects, will definitely search out again for special occasions"
"Notes: Now one of my favorite stouts and another winning beer from Ommegang."
"D: I cracked this open after work on Friday afternoon and that reason alone would make it an A+ in a perfect world. Worth a try if you have the chance."
"I'm sorry to say that this beer was a little bit of a let down. Everything seemed fine until I tasted pennies in the finish. I know it had something to do with the cocoa used in the brewing but I'm not sure exactly how this happened. A friend also had the same experience. Maybe I'll give this beer a try again if I can find it on tap."
"If you liked this try the Brooklyn Chocolate Stout."
"Drinkability: Overall, flavor is pretty mild (nothing special). Goes down smooth and low ABV makes it even easier to drink."
"A soft, full-bodied stout with a Belgian twist, Chocolate Indulgence is ripe with delicate subtleties in a complex weaving."
"D: This is a nice desert brew that would go well with bitter chocolate. It requires sipping so it would be a poor choice for a session brew. It is a decent substitute for a hot chocolate on a damp cool fall night."
"Opaque color with large off-brown head that clings to the sides. Not too pleasant aroma of strong alcohol and dark chocolate. Tastes of pure dark chocolate, alcohol, malt, and chewiness. Heavy bodied beer with mild carbonation creates a thick potion feel. A dark dessert of a beer that would make Godiva dirty their pants. Elegant and beautiful but not a defining beer of the stout genre. Definitely worth of enjoying with some ice cream though."
"I paired this brew up with Lindt Lindor Extra Dark Chocolate from Switzerland. the chocolate was a little too sweet to completely compliment this beer. maybe a less sweet and more bitter Belgian chocolate would go better with it...."
"Got a chance, as per usual, because I'm famously lucky, to sample this rather expensive bottle at a beer tasting for free- Score! The beer poured out a dark brown color with two fingers of creamy, tan head. The head retained well and it left lots of sticky lacing. It looked like Coca-Cola! The aroma was dry, cocoa powder and toasted coffee beans. The flavors were very big, liquid smoke, bittersweet chocolate, some hints of milk chocolate, rich roasted malt and a very long espresso finish. It did strike me as more bitter than I was expecting and for a beer named ""Chocolate Indulgence"" I felt the chocolate flavors were understated and lacking sweetness. The mouthfeel was smooth and the carbonation just right but it was a little light. Dare I say it? Watery. Ouch. For the price I really just couldn't convince myself to buy one. I love this brewery but I was both surprised and a little disappointed by this one."
"Black pour with thick tan head. Great globby lacing. Aroma is of light chocolaty malt over fruity esters, a little medicinal. Smells like how a chocolate triple would smell. Taste is light bittersweet chocolate, light roasted malt. Mouthfeel is on the thin side. Overall this beer is good but it would benefit greatly from more malt and much more chocolate character to back its name. A fine brew from Ommegang, just not as fine as the others."
"Nice, I'll give it a try again sometime."
"Just arrived in the Dallas area. I poured it into a Val Dieu wide-mouthed chalice. The color is opaque--quite dark--with a large dark-tan head on top that fades but never dies away. The nose is somewhat restrained--there's a roasted dark cocoa edge, but it's not all that strong. The flavor is exactly as expected: dark chocolate, bitter and roasted, but fortunately not overwhelmingly chocolate nor at all sweet. Maybe a little one-dimensional but a well-crafted beer."
"This might be my favorite of the Ommegang brews. A very well put together Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"Relatively thin liquor for what I was expecting. The flavor has a lot of dark chocolate with some cream. This is a wonderful mix of Belgian flavors and a dark English porter."
"I would probably have given the beer even higher marks, particularly in smell, if the beer had a higher abv. Now, I write that with some trepidation because the alcoholic flavor of the 1.5% higher Abbey Ale was a primary motivation for me in panning it. So, as long as Ommegang raised the abv without making it taste like they dropped a few shots of vodka in the bottle, the beer would benefit from the change."
"Again, a bit of a disappointment for Ommegang. I wish I had let it sit for awhile longer."
"Stellar looking. Poured pretty much black, light chocolate brown head, not as ""thick"" as I was expecting. Nutty, chocolate aromas. The two words coming to my head are: dirty chocolate, for the smell. Not bad. Almost chocolate cordial, cherry included, flavor. A bit of that typical belgian tartness, sourness. Interesting, but I was looking more ""indulgent."" By the name and look of the bottle, I was imagining and hoping for a smooth, luscious chocolate flavor, more reminiscent of Young's Double Chocolate. Yet, it is a nice flavor. A bit thin on the mouthfeel. I know this is a belgian stout, but I was still looking for stouter body. All in all, quite good and quite drinkable. This is not available (I think) in Texas right now. The other Ommegangs are and they are far superior I think, so in the end I am happy."
"I had this on tap at Taco Mac in Atlanta. The beer looked really appetizing, dark brown color with a thick chunky milk chocolate colored that lasted forever. The smell was chocolate and roasted malts, about what I expected given the name. The taste is OK, solid I guess, but less chocolaty than the name ""Indulgence"" would lead you to believe. It had a good malt character, more roasted than burnt which I appreciate. The body was lighter than I expected but made for easier drinking."
"Picked up a 750mL bottle. Pours a dark brown with a medium brown head. Smell is mostly of dark chocolate, no surprise there. Taste is of nice dark cocoa and roasted malt sweetness. Finish leaves you thinking you just drank some hot cocoa. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy. Drinkability is high. This is enjoyable year round, but I'm thinking of picking up a few bottles for the winter holidays."
"Black and opaque with a good stout head. Smell is strongly of milky chocolate. There's a surprising bit of hop up front, before developing into rich and smooth chocolate. Good flavor, but not very complex. The beer is failed by its thin and bubbly mouthfeel, though. For Belgian stouts, I've only the Allagash Black to compare it to, but it's not in the same league."
"Overall this is a highly drinkable beer. Seriously reminds me of a stout. Would recommend to anyone."
"M/D: this is a good beer with a very creamy texture. if you like chocolate and stouts this is a great beer for you to try"
"D: Quite drinkable for its strength."
"Though Belgian dark chocolate was used in the brewing, I have no idea how or why this drink is classified as a 'Belgian Strong Dark Ale'... it's nothing similar to any I ever had... the descriptor is dead wrong, as this brew is a 'stout', make no mistake, and a very tasty one at that!"
"This beer tastes OK, but considering the brewery, and the style, is a major disappointment."
"Probably the darkest beer ive had, ever. The smell is a bit overpowering of beer. I really dont smell anything but. Unfortunately i overpoured so the head is rediculous but still not bad tasting like some heads get. I was startled by the lack of carbonation. Startled but not unimpressed. The foam tasted like a simple ommegang but the beer iteself tasted like....well like nothing but the aftertaste was a spectacular chocolate flavor with no bitter aftertaste. I rate this one above Young's but below the Rouge i had on tap. Although i have yet to taste anything close to the Rogue i had on tap, even a bottle of rogue. Ive been dissapointed by all the chocolate beers since my first taste of one, but never all out dissatisfied. Maybe my memory of the first time is like my memory of my first woman. Distorted but not all untrue. ;)"
"Overall: A little better then Young's Choc. Stout and similar to it...highly recommend."
"D: Not too bad. Would definately drink one again. But its not something im gona go searching for."
"D: Alcohol is not as hefty as some of the style can be. Overall satisfaction is somewhere in the middle of the road, however. It's certainly not a bad beer, and well worth trying, but not one that came across as particularly complex to my palate."
"D- It's not particularly hard to get down (especially since its so thin), but I almost didn't want to finish it."
"Ultimately this beer was a huge disappointment from a once favorite brewery. How sad."
"Overall this is a very pleasant beer, all the great flavors you would expect in a stout but with a bit more depth to it making it stand out. Definitely worth a try and very tasty."
"An enjoyable after dinner ""indulgence"" - I do enjoy such crossover styles as this. easy drinking yet quite powerful. Well done (and not in the red meat sense - this is good stuff!)."
"Drinkability: Nothing wrong with this one. A surprisingly refreshing dessert-styled beer, and not really what I expected, but there's nothing wrong with it. Recommended."
"D- 750ml was plenty. its good, but id want something else for the next one. very interesting."
"D: This is pretty tasty beer, though it's not something I would seek out on a regular basis. It's simply a little too rich for me."
"Overall, a good beer to try."
"This beer is an effing mess, and a near drainpour for me. Just a disaster on many levels."
""
"D-- based on the name not impressed glad I only bought 1 bottle, however take the lable off and not knowing what I was drinking it is a decent stout"
"A huge three finger tall light brown head has a nice mix of bubbles that slowly fade leaving thick lace. Body is opaque thick syrupy blackness. Nose is full of coco, Yahoo chocolate drink and even a hint of spicey hops in the backround. As you take first sip you get sime smokey chocolate up front. A quick dose of bakers dark chocolate bitter is noticeable up next. Some distinct grassy hops show up at the end of the palate. Vanilla tones are there also. The dark chocolate feel really holds on to the mouthfeel on the back of the tongue. This is a nicely drinkable not over done chocolate stout. Drinks best on the warmer side."
"A few people I know had set me up for disappointment with this, but instead I was pleasantly surprised. This makes a fantastic dessert beer and would be great for sharing with friends."
"D_An interesting take on a chocolate stout, this one is hard to classify. If pressed and having no idea I would classify this as a milk/sweet stout. I will definitely pick this one up again, maybe to pour over some vanilla ice cream. Another interesting and unique beer from the Ommegang crew."
"way too drinkable for it's strength in terms of masking the alcohol. the sweetness and richness would make it hard for me to imagine polishing off a whole bomber myself. but i'll be happy to try!"
"Drinkability is nice, very tasty and worthy of savoring every sip. Alcohol is evident but positively, with a nice rumminess, almost burbon barrel like. Really beautiful, I'm shocked, and wish I had bought more!!! I still give this one some nice aging potential flavor wise, the flavors would ripen but the body would fall out."
"Poured into a tulip a very nice dark brown color, very nice carbonation, awesome two-finger creamy light tan head, lots and lots of nice thick sticky lacing follows through out. The nose is malty, some yeast notes, slight figs, raisins, plums, slight vanilla, with some nice tones of chocolate. The taste is very nice, slightly sweet, malty, nice notes of dark fruit, some chocolate tones. Full-Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well, some chewyness, smooth. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, just like all the Ommegang brews. Thanks Joe."
"D: I can't get past the metal sorry."
"MF: Stout like and strong dark Belgian like all in one. This is quite good and I found it quite drinkable."
"D: A easy drinking and very enjoyable strong dark ale with stout character."
"D: This isn't a bad beer by any stretch, but given Ommegang's track record, I was expecting to be blown away. I got a nice chocolate stout instead -- and that feels like a little bit of a letdown."
"The taste is slightly metallic, smooth, cramy, some nice fruity undertones, chocolate, fresh baked cookies, frothy, very sweet there is a suttle hop presence but that metallic taste seems to dominate. This is a good beverage not the best by Ommegang but a decent brew."
"Pours a two finger thick brown head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Black as midnight. Good carbonation and heavy bodied. Chocolate nose. Flavor is a rich unsweetened chocolate with a bakers chocolate finish. Nice beefy stout. $11.49 for a 750ml bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma."
"Not bad..."
"Drinkability is high since it is just chocolatie goodness. Not heavy and could be a good session beer. A good beer all together."
"Another very well done chocolate stout, as so many of them are. Impressive appearance that actually looked smooth, near-black in color with a big, rocky tan-colored head. My friend commented that it looked ""vicious"". Smell was somewhat straightforward of chocolate and roasted malt. Taste was nice - sweet, malty, chocolatey, a touch of coffee and a bit of fruitiness. Not too strong or bitter, but rather balanced. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat light for the style, which made it more drinkable and refreshing."
"Overall a good drink. Richness is high so there may be limits on it, but it went well with my strawberry birthday pie."
"almost a complete blackout in my glass, Initial flavors of coffee and sweetness from the dark malts, but nothing too unbalanced; quit nice. The finish is what really grabbed me with it's dryness obviously coming from its use of cocoa powder delivering dark chocolate flavors that were very pleasing to the taste buds. This is a delicious beer that I will certainly try again."
"As black as black can be with a nice frothy tan head. Good lace is left behind. This smells mostly of cocoa powder. Rich dark belgian chocolate flavor with a hint of coffee. The malt punch is strong at first with chocolate flavor coming in strong in the aftertaste. The feel is very smooth. Not quite as chocolately as i would have expected and probably the least impressive ommegang release to date but its still solid. Very rich and full bodied. Incredibly drinkable."
"Bottle courtesy of Kryptic: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma is totally dominated by loads of chocolate malt notes with some subtle sweetness. Taste is a mix between some huge chocolate notes with some light sweet notes. Body is slightly thin for the style with a nice creamy texture thought and some good carbonation. Alcohol was not apparent. Overall, a very interesting experiment by this fine brewery but lacking some character and maybe some lactose to be truly inspiring."
"Notes: I have had this at Brewery Ommegang during the 2007 Waffles and Puppets event and I don't remember it having any metallic flavor to it. Overall I still enjoied it and look forward to having more of it at this years Waffles and Puppets."
"A passable brewpub porter maybe, but a massive disappointment as Ommegang's corked and caged Anniversary ""indulgence""."
"D- Good, but not what was advertised. I would not get this again for what I paid for it."
"Finishes with a lingering bitterness, much like very dark, bitter chocolate. While I appreciate subtlety, it's almost too subtle. Especially for a beer called ""Chocolate Indulgence"". It's good, but typical of so many other U.S.-brewed stouts, ones made by 2nd and 3rd rate breweries even. The lack of any discernible Belgian characteristics was unexpected."
"Same black-as-night appearance. Old Rasputin's head is even thicker, looks like it would support a silver dollar. Rasputin definitely packs more of a punch. More viscous, almost oily mouthfeel. Dense smoke and caramelized malts. Big alcohol backbone. Despite all that, really drinkable, though. I think it comes down to mood. On a freezing cold winter's night in front of a nice cracklin' hardwood fire, I reach for the Old Rasputin. The Chocolate Indulgence I would enjoy any time of year in any weather."
"EDIT: The previous review is of the 2007 version. I had the 2008 edition a couple months ago and it was MUCH improved. I read somewhere that the recipe was tweaked for the '08, and the metallic taste was completely gone. I didn't take notes for a review, but it would score much higher."
"I paired mine with a Bavarian Beer cheese and a goat milk Brie. The Bavarian beer cheese went perfectly with it, but the Brie was so-so. I stupidly expected something sweeter when I saw the words Chocolate Indulgence."
"Thick pour, with a hot chocolate color head that lasts forever. Two opposite smells of chocolate, one being sweet chocolate- the later being dark. French roast coffee beans come out a little on the nose as well. The palate starts off with chocolate that is actually quite creamy, almost sweet. Only until you take a breath of air, does the dark roasted malts and dark chocolate really take effect. I really wanted to see more of a rich/creamy palate with a chocolate style beer. Good balance, nothing over the top- although I would appreciate a little more complexity to be great."
"Mouthfeel is nice--medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. I could see myself drinking more of this if it weren't for that metallic flavor, but as it was I didn't have a problem sacrificing a small portion for a steak maridande. (Definitely improved the marinade, I'll say that!)"
"Ovreall, a disappointment. I was excited about this one as I have enjoyed every one of Ommegang's beers. This was above average, for sure--it's hard to hate chocolate--but I just found it too sharp and unrefined."
"Kudos to Brewery Ommegang for a decade's worth of excellent craft beer. Unfortunately, where Chocolate Indulgence Stout is concerned, the contents of the bottle are not equal to the name and the packaging. It wasn't a waste of $9.99, but I have no desire to buy another."
"An excellent stout. One to stock up on and enjoy now and down the road with good friends. Best at the warmer side of cellar temperatures."
"D: A worthy Anniversary offering and another step in the right direction for Belgian stouts."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and has a creamy texture. Very mild carbonation. This is a very tasty beer, but I would argue with the Belgian Strong Dark Ale label. The label on the bottle says it's a stout. It borders on being an RIS, but could easily qualify as a sweet stout."
"Drinkability: Sorry, but no, I just didn't care for this beer that was about as much fun as peeling potatoes."
"Notes: I may have appreciated this beer more had I not had the Southern Tier Choklat recently. Despite the name, Chocolate Indulgence is nothing of the sort compared to its neighbor from Western NY. It wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to expectations -- and at $10 for the bottle (a 750 ml, I believe) -- it wasn't cheap."
"Overall a big letdown, glad I didn't buy two."
"Appearance is dark with a thick, fluffy, tan head that lingers. Lots of lacing. Smell is chocolatey, but not overpowering with some hints of roasted malts. Some nuttiness and bittersweet aromas. Taste is bittersweet chocolate but not overpowering with some mild roasted flavors. Very creamy and full-bodied and easy to drink. An interesting beer and worth trying."
"Falvor falls a bit short of expectations. Roasted bitter cocoa tones, slight coffee,malts, a slight twang of vanilla. Finish is somewhat watery, but mouthfeel gradually improves as it reaches a full serving temp. Drinkability is high due to its good flavor and lighter mouthfeel; but I must mark off on taste simply dur to it's name. To call a beer a chocolate ""indulgence",I was expecting something..well..a little more chocolatley and indulgent. I wanted a rich, heavy stout-like beer, but rather, discovered a easy-drinking BSDA.Quite enjoyable nonetheless."
"I tried a sample of this beer during a brewery tour during a recent trip to Cooperstown. I ended up buying a bottle. The beer is intensely dark, basically black, with a dense, tightly woven, tan head. The lace is thick and long lasting. The aroma is notably inviting. The first sensation is of roasted barley, mixed with a little highly modified malt...it's a nice dark-roast coffee aroma. Next, quickly following the first sniff, comes a baking chocolate aroma...dry, bitter, and very enticing. Sometimes a chocolate beer is overdone with sweet aromas, but that's not the case here. The taste is a lot more delicate than I expected. Moderately sweet, with a nice tug-of-war between the bitter roastedness and malt sweetness. This one is well balanced. Creamy, complex, and enjoyable. Hops are present, but bitterness and flavor are at a low level. The mouthfeel is creamy and satisfying. This is probably the least carbonated Ommegang beer that I've ever had (age?). This is a well-done, beautifully conceived, very satisfying brew."
"This is a good beer, not the best I've had in its style, but a keeper. A bomber will do it for me. There is plenty to enjoy , and as I find with Ommegang brews, the story behind the beer is pleasing as well."
"This one is a winner in every respect and comes highly recommended."
"A unique beer to say the least and it pretty much delivers exactly what it says. In the end, I guess that is all you can ask for. Personally, I would split this among three to four people and pair it with either a strong cheese or a flourless cake."
"d: I'm a big fan of this one. It is mellow and very approachable in its subtlety. This was a Christmas gift from my future brother-in-law. Since I liked this one, you are good enough to marry my sister."
"A unique Belgian stout, this poured pitch black with decent tan head. It smelled lighter than actual chocolate, more like cocoa powder, mixed with some mild hops. It tasted like a perfect blend of milk chocolate (sweeter than typical chocolate flavoring in beer) and copper hops, with some hazelnut flavored malt for balance. It was fairly thick with no carbonation with a smooth, bitter, and dry aftertaste. Overall this was a very tasty and impressive beer!"
"It's really pretty good, but baker's chocolate isso bland when not mixed with something like latose/lactase or a thickening malt (like oatmeal). However, it is a very unique Belgium Ale that deserves a try. I wonder if it will change at all since a B.O. brewmasster is heading over to New Glarus in Wisconsin? Will any of their specialty beers change as a result?"
"Drinkability - I could see having a bottle of that with friends as an aperitiff. Nice finish and nice atmosphere."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Carbonation is good. It goes down relatively easy. Drinkability is pretty good, but I'd definitely limit myself to the one 750. Frankly, I'd suggest splitting it with someone. Overall, it's a pretty good beer. But, a bit disappointing. I had high expectations and hopes for this one."
"well, i've been sitting on this one for awhile ; pours a deep garnet-black w/ a creamy light brown head which leaves a thick lacing most of the way down my big 'ol mug ; not a very strong smell, a sweet, slightly burnt toast and a warm, nut-like aroma up front followed by vinous dark fruit and faint cocoa detected in the end ; a good ""bite"" initially, more from black malts than hops, a rich, tart, dark roasted grain almost ""espresso-like"" flavor blends well w/ a delicate chocolate and raison(?)-ish taste turning into hot alcohol at the end, faintly metallic in the finish as well, with a hint of oak possibly ; dry, med. bodied and creamy, the co2 makes this beer drink a bit thicker than you'd think ; an awesome brew, a must try for anyone serious about beer, i can't wait to get my hands on another one..."
"M/D: Smooth and very drinkable, quick to go down which works because it wasn't the most savory beer."
"Found this on-tap at Capone's in Norristown, PA."
"D - Even though a little gushed out, I may have trouble finishing this 750. It's very good, but it does seem rich. I'll take one for the team, though. It would be better to share with someone. Choco-stouts aren't my favorite, but I am happy to have had the opportunity to try this."
"The Chocolate Indulgence's higher-than-average alcohol content is masked by a rich flavor and good mouthfeel. From the pop of the cork to the last drop, Ommegang comes through with another fine Belgian-style brew."
"Nice after dinner beer to indulge."
"Overall a beer worth trying, but seems to be a bit overhyped, even by the fine folks at Ommegang, who promise it wont be seasonal, but available year round"
"Tasted on 2/1/08"
"The flavor was not disappointing, but it was not as strong in chocolate flavor as it was in aroma. It is made with Belgian dark chocolate, but did not have a terribly bitter, biting heaviness to it. I believe it was made with lactose which may lend to an overall balance."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer, but not a great one. It could be enhanced by a more lustrius nose and more chocolate in the flavor. Maybe I didn't get a good bottle, because I expect only the best from Ommegang. For $6.99 a bottle I'll turn my head and cough out $5.00 for a bottle of Hennepin. Worth a try, I guess."
"As you'd expect for a beer fermented with Belgian yeast, this beer is exquisitely smooth and well-attenuated. Bone dry on the tongue. Body is a bit too light for a stout, but that just makes this beer more similar to mousse than fudge. Drinkability is great."
"Pours a very dark brown with a thick tan head. It certainly looks like chocolate! The aroma of dark bitter chocolate is very strong and to me it was almost off-putting. Besides the chocolate (dark cocoa, not milk) I noted some dark fruit backed by a faint tartness. The flavor was full of cocoa bitterness, along with some roasted malt that lingers in the end. The beer is only 7% ABV but a bit of alcohol warmth comes through in the finish. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated and not as thick as I had expected. Not horrible, but not the best chocolate beer I've tried."
"Drinkability - awesome flavor in a mighty drinkable package. I need a case of these..."
"Served in a Chimay chalice from a 750ml bottle. Rich dark color, with a head that looks like hot chocolate. Bitter chocolate aroma. Flavor improves as the beer warmed. Taste is a dry, bitter chocolate flavor, with a little hint of hops. Rich flavor, extremely easy drinking. Great chocolate flavor without being overly sweet. A nice change from the other delicious Belgian offerings that Ommegang offers."
"Pours a nice dark brown from the bottle with a medium fluffy tan head that laces the glass all the way down. The aroma is of dark malts, some fruitiness from the yeast and then lots of chocolate. The taste is really good, and interesting. I wasn't expecting it to be as rich as it was, but it certainly lives up to its name - chocolate indulgence. It has a nice chocolate and fruity flavor that combines pretty nicely. It has a very soft and velvety mouthfeel which is not what I was expecting, even with a belgian ale. That being said it was pretty drinkable, but it could be better I think, maybe if it had a little harder feel to it."
"D: A delicious beer, much more of a Milk Stout than a BSDA, no real ester, dark fruit character here, but just a tasty stout, yum."
"Don't drink and review."
"I didn't really know what to expect with this one. I remembered liking my one-ounce sample at GABF, but not enough to draw a conclusion. Now that I've had a few pours, I like this one. Well made, different, tasty. Highly recommended."
"D-The latest offering from one of my favorite breweries ends up being nothing short of average. This Belgian stout is only 7% ABV and it tastes like it has 11+. I am disappointed by this brew-but only because everything else form Ommegang is simply decadent. It's not a bad brew but its definitely not an ""indulgence."" I'll have this again-if I don't have to pay for it."
"Edit: After reading reviews, I wonder if mine was infected (obviously off-tasting), but as I said, this never saw daylight or warmth. After an hour, the remains still taste like nothing more than a coin..."
"Pours an opaque black/brown, massive and thick brown head forms, leaves behind a ton of lace, settles to a solid layer. Smell is neat, chocolate, roast, yeast, bread, funk, dark fruits, nice malt, decent sourness, works well with the chocolate. Taste is rich chocolate, bread, yeast, Belgiany funk, fruits, bit of roast, more chocolate, sour finish, nice. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, medium carbonation, nice chocolate roast aftertaste. Pretty neat beer, the chocolate is nice and the funk works well. Thanks Jay!"
"The nose is good but this beer really stands out once you drink it (IMO). Lots of chocolaty roasted malts and some hop bitterness. I was not expecting so much chocolate and it lingers nicely in the finish."
"Another addition to the ""fireside collection", assuming hopefully, that I can get some agian next year."
"I thought it was a pretty nice beer. Far from being just another ""stout with chocolate", this is a beer that stands on its own and I dig that."
"Overall an ok beer. I would not buy it again."
"D: Overall, this beer was a little different than I expected it to be but I still enjoyed it a lot and could have drank another tall bottle of it. It's a great dessert/after dinner beer."
"Poured on tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad 2-7-08. Poured into a 10oz glass. Poured a midnight black color with a thick tan head. Smell is roasted malt with a slight coco smell. Taste is very mild with just a roasted malt flavor border line burnt flavor with a ever so slight chocolate flavor at the very end. Mouthfeel was full body with a medium carbonation level. The beer itself is pretty easy to drink since the alcohol level is hidden very well, but I was very disappointed that the chocolate flavor was really a afterthought. While a good american stout, it certainly doesnt live up to its name and would rather drink Southern Tier or Rogue's chocolate stouts."
"d: very easy"
"Drinkability is very nice. Doesn't drink like the high ABV. Hard to put this one down inbetween sips."
"Pours a almost black color with just hints of brown and ruby when held up to the light. The head foams up with a cola like fizz to it. Smell has a distinct cocoa powder note with some burnt malt to compliment. Taste is surprisingly mild. There is cocoa but the burnt malt almost dissapears. Don't know if it's the cocoa powder smell or what but it has a chaulky mouthfeel. Very smooth finish. I have to say I was expecting something a little more in your face. This is much smoother than expected and almost slips into milk stout range. Overall a nice beer that i'm glad I had the chance to try."
"With a name like Chocolate Indulgence I would expect this to be a little more decadent; perhaps a touch more residual malt sweetness would be just the thing. This does need a chance to breath, lose some carbonation and warm up a bit before it really comes into its own. Just out of the bottle it is a touch dimensionless and has a bit too much roast character (both roast notes and burnt acidity)."
"d: Alcohol is completely hidden, very drinkable, not too rich or thick. An interesting beer, the chocolate is noticeable, but not overwhelming. Its an enjoyable beer, but at $12 bottle, I don't plan on buying another."
"D- subtle & smooth, very enjoyable roasted flavors, though i didn't enjoy the alcohol much, definitely worth a try"
"Drinkability - Certainly enjoyable."
"Very dark brown, nearly black, with a pillowy tan cap the left chunky lace clinging to the glass. The aroma was bready and roast, some coffee and a little yeast character, plus some chocolate and malt notes. Low bitterness with plenty of malt, dry cocoa, roasty coffee, bready yeast, and a bit of alcohol. Maybe a hint of smoke too. Light tartness of sour cherries and lingering bittersweet chocolate. Medium bodied with generous carbonation, quite creamy. I thought the flavours held together quite well. Highly enjoyable and easily drinkable."
"The feel and drinkability of this beer are great. Super smooth with well hidden alcohol make for a great dessert beer that isn't too thick."
"Overall: Somethings wrong here, hopefully only my bottle. I can see where you'd get metallic flavor from using too much chocolate or maybe the wrong type. Perhaps that is what happened. But it wasn't pleasant, I dumped the bottle with a frown on my face... I love Chocolate beers and Ommegang but this one was just bad."
"Drinkability: This is a delicious beer, comparable if not better than Rogue's chocolate, but they're different. Awesome after dinner beer, BBQ pork ribs and cole slaw. The beer kept it sweet, but cleaned it up the palette."
"Overall an interesting beer I'll drink more of."
"This is a pretty nice brew. It's about as good as it could get for a Belgian Stout with cocoa. I can't really think of how to make this one much better, which is a good sign."
" This is simply a beautiful brew, big flavor, ultra-smooth feel...a true bad-ass Stout and very drinkable at 7 %. I couldn't put this one down. Wow."
"Overall, it has a strong body that is well-balanced. The chocolate is apparent but not as overwhelming as I was expecting."
"had high expectation for this one. I put it in my Christmas Day rotation. Creamy, light brown head. Black color. Mild chocolate aroma with no hops or maltiness. A little oak, nutmeg, clove, and pepper. Not as much chocolate as I had expected or hoped. Most of the chocolate is in the aftertaste."
"Rich black body with thick tan head consisting of tiny bubbles. Great retention with continuous lace. Really nice! Smell is mild with chocolate and a light sourness. Taste is warm roasted malt and chocolate with moderate sourness and a bit of citrus that transitions to a chocolate and increasingly sour finish with just a little bitterness. Full bodied with a creamy texture an a smooth, slightly dry finish. Very nice overall with an amazing appearance, unreal head retention, great flavor and very pleasant mouthfeel. Try it if you like rich stouts."
"d- this is drinkable, no one knows the ABV, but it seems to be around 7%. the dry finish makes you want more."
"The name had me expecting something from a chocolatier as much as from a brewer. What I got was a stout with really just a touch more cocoa character than most specimens. Judging it in that context, it's pleasant, but not especially memorable. Still, it does drink well enough, the credible ABV notwithstanding. So even though it supposedly killed the cat, I was curious about this, and now I know, it's just a stout with a chocolatey name. But hey, at least the cat didn't die."
"A pretty decent stout, and a nice change from the heavy, filling stouts. Seems like a perfect choice for those times you want a chocolaty stout but not a big, chewy one."
"D - Drinkability is ok for this brew is pretty rich and chocolaty this beer is a dessert in itself worth having at least once"
"On the whole, rather good."
"Overall I was not dissapointed with this one at all. It was extremly drinkable and rich and delicous. I was not sure if this was going to go over the top or come in a little flat, but was very happy to find that it fit right smack in the middle coming across just thick enough, just sweet enough, just bitter enough to make a fine mix. I would definitly remonned this one any day and will probably go out and get me another one."
"Pitch black. Medium sized crop of brown froth sits on top. It laces quite nicely as I drink. Smells of chocolate some roast notes and bready yeastiness. Palate doesn't match the aroma as nicely as I'd like. It's a little watery with light notes of chocolate spattered about. This is really pretty thin in flavor. Not a lot going on besides the light cocoa and slight belgian yeastiness and some metallic notes as well. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Sparsely carbonated. This beer does very little for me."
"Had this on-tap in a snifter. Opaque black with touches of ruby. What little head there was quickly vanished, though there was still some good lacing that remained caked on the glass. Great complex smell! Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, and bourbon. Very well done. Taste is good, but didn't deliver the complexity I had expected from the aromas. Dry chocolate and coffee. Burnt notes. Left a tasty aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, though still very smooth. Quite drinkable considering the lower ABV (7%) and its sipping nature. A nice treat."
"Pours a dark brown with a large head that dissipates quickly. Smell is of chocolate, some coffee, and a fruity smell from the yeast. Taste is more of the chocolate and coffee with a funk in the finish that I found unpleasant. I think it was fruity esters from the yeast and while I might enjoy that in another beer, it seemed out of place here. Mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side, carbonation on the high side. I had high hopes for this one, but I didn't really enjoy this it."
"750 ml corked bottle. Served in an Ommegang chalice, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like roasted malt and milk chocolate. Taste isn't nearly as good as the aroma. There's a strong metallic taste which overpowers the chocolate and whatever other flavors are supposed to be in there. The metallic taste also lingers around in the finish. It only gets worse as the beer warms. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy but also thin and a bit watery as well. If not for the strong metallic taste it wouldn't be hard to drink at all, but it's a chore to drink this. This brew is a major disappointment, I expected better."
"M/D: A good, creamy mouthfeel, carbonation is a little high, full bodied. Drinkablility is all right on this one. Overall, I have to say I'm a little underwhelmed, maybe my expectations were too high. Expected much more chocolate in this one. Almost comes off closer to a brown ale in taste, with a stout body, but even the brown ale, almost porter-like character, is too off. I've got 1 more bottle that I will hold onto for a while and see what happens, but I'm not expecting much."
"Just as the bottle instructed, I poured the beer slowly, as not to disturb the yeast sediment but enough to release the aromas. The beer has a slight Belgian twang (phenolics, esters, and a funky wild yeast tartness) that came through in the nose and taste, but the appearance was a dark ruby color and the beer also had a detering metalic / blood taste that I didn't prefer much. After a few pours into the glass, I decided to mix it up a bit. After which, the beer released a huge mix of Stout, Cocoa, Roasted barley, and sweet maltiness that drowned out that metalic taste and made the beer quite wonderful. From there on out, the beer took on big Russian Imperial Stout characteristics. The fruitiness and sherry-like aging wasn't there, but the big boost of cocoa helped to round the beer into a complex, yet simple treat."
"D: I'm not really liking this - I don't think I will be buying it again."
"Pours opaque with a tan head that doesn't really stick around long. Nose is firm chocolate tones. Not much else going on besides that cocoa powder character. Flavor is a very rich chocolate. Complex? No. A chocolate stout with a Belgian flair? Yes. Feel is smooth on the liquid and has a nice level of carbonation to it. The verdict? This is not a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. This is a Belgian Stout. I think it's time for a new beer style here folks. Even indeed. Try it if you have the chance."
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is one inch in height, rocky, and light tan in color. The aroma is of chocolate, cream, graham crackers, and roasted malt. The taste leans more toward roasted malt and cream, but there is still a noticeable chocolate character. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a mild carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a nice beer, but I wouldn't pay fifteen dollars for another bottle of it."
"750ml corked and caged bottle with no freshness date other than 10th anniversary - so it was bottled in 2007. Pours a jet black with a 2 finger brown head, nice longevity and beautiful lace. Lots of coffee and chocolate aromas mixed with earthy and bready smells too. Lots of nice flavors here. Some initial brown sugar, dried fruits followed by the coffee and slight chocolate with a nice roasted malt aftertaste. This stuff is wonderfully complex and smooth. Everything is balanced superbly. An awesome beer."
"Pours opaque dark brown with an inch of chunky brown head that dissolves down to a thick blanket of foam and lace. Smells like cocoa, dark fruit, alcohol, and white pepper. The flavor does not impress; flat-tasting powdered cocoa, light alcohol esters, and white pepper lack cohesion and development. Finishes with unpleasant oxidized metal notes. Body is somewhat lifeless and watery. The most disappointing Ommegang offering I've encountered."
"Pours black with a chocolate milk colored head. Slight alcohol aroma and a hint of fresh hops. Taste is a bit lacking in my opinion; I can't get the strong alcohol/chocolate taste in a straightforward gulp. The chocolate sneaks up after the initial taste, like you just had some chocolate milk, which is enhanced by the very smooth and nonthreatening feel of the beer. Overall I can just say I wish both the alcohol punch and the taste were a lot stronger, like a Russian Imperial Stout, but I don't know how this more mellow feel fits with the style."
"Nice chocolate brew. Hints of a Belgian, strong burnt malt and loads of bitter chocolate. Decent beer."
"Poured into a tulip glass, this beer had a thick, foamy head and excellent lacing. A full chocolate and malt aroma is prominent. Very smooth with an semi-sweet chocolate and roasted malt flavor. This beer has a slight twinge of astringency, but that actually plays well with the chocolate and maltiness of the beer. Full bodied without being too heavy, I really enjoy the consistency and drinkability of this beer. It seems to have excellent balance and a great stout over all."
"This stuff rocks! Chocolate silk pie in a bottle! Gonna have to grab more before its gone cuz this stuff is a keeper for sure. Share, hoard, indulge, whatever...I know I'm gonna stick with the namesake and give in to my ""Indulgence"" of this great beer!"
"Strong notes of roasted barley, slight espresso, and some dark chocolate start off the nose. As it warms there are slight aromas of green bananas, The taste has the same tones to it and is really rather mellow, for a strong dark ale. As it leave the tongue it turns rather alcohol-ish and phenolic. The mouth feel is medium bodied and is rather creamy but at the same time, dry and sharp on the front of the tongue. Overall a very nice beer. Great with coffee cake or holiday deserts."
"Amazing appearance! Solid black color with a beige head that reduced quick. Left generous amounts of lacing, but lacked the head retention to make it a 5. Very smooth finish with a moderate to strong bitterness which might be due to the use of cocoa. Although, I don't really taste cocoa it does have hints of coffee,roasted malts,molasses,with a hint of vanilla. Has strong phenol notes with a bitterness that lingers. each sip left a new circle of lacing. At 7 % ABV it's not overpowering, but is definately warming. Reminds me of the bitterness of a 90% cocoa chocolate bar. For it's strength it is very drinkable and goes down smooth. The mouthfeel seems a touch on the watery side. Extremely well-crafted and worth a try. Opened on Xmas day 2007."
"Poured out of a 750 bottle into a Belgian beer chalice. Gave it a medium strength pour which produced a slight head of a tannish/brown color, about 1 finger which subsided after about 45 seconds. Thick lacing and a very dark color beer. I smell roasted hops, dark bitter chocolate, a hint of alcohol, and some residual sugars. The taste is chocolatey, a little much sugar, dark roasted flavors, a little bitter, some oak, and a hint of alcohol. The roast and the sugar are not as balanced as I would like, but still pretty palatable. The mouthfeel is ok, there's a little too much carbonation I think for this style of beer. By itself this beer is a good treat, especially as a winter warmer but I could only have a few of them before I would feel a sugar overload."
"It has a big dark chocolate/coffee taste on the front. Some alcohol taste and a hint of burnt malt on the finish. I'd like a bit more raisiny flavor in the middle and finish. It also has a surprisingly light body. I like it and would recommend it but think it does not have the complexity of the Brooklyn chocolate stout, for example. It's another very good beer from Ommegang but they still have not quite matched the Belgian level IMHO."
"Drinkability- Would like to try this beer again (minus the metal). Would be better, but still thinking I wouldn't be as impressed as I should."
"Poured a 750 into a 6oz Brandy Snifter. Aroma is of roasted malts, vanilla and toffee. Taste is Chocolate malts (hence the name) with toffee, ending with a roasted grains taste. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, wanted it to be a little thicker. Drinkability is about average."
"Overall: An interesting, somewhat drinkable beer that would probably be quite good if not for the profound metallic taste, which makes rating it complicated. To try to be fair, I tasted the first pour in a 20 ounce (standard shaped) pint glass that was washed in the dishwasher, and then a second taste in a wide-bowl red wine glass that I carefully washed and completely dried by hand, to make it beeer clean, and got basically the same metallic in both. Ms. Warmstorage got the same thing in both tastings, without prompting from me. The metallic nature is a significant flaw, and I feel like I had to ding the beer in both taste and drinkability for it."
"Drinkability is good, wishing they had these in singles at Inari because I would be purchasing more, alas only in the gift packs here in Bristol. I am enjoying this one very much would recommend for all to try."
"This beer was pours brown-black with a frothy tan head that holds a nice film and laces well. The smell if full of roated malts with the cocoa powder and hints of belgian yeastiness. The taste echos the smell. The roasted character is up front with bitter cocoa following and finishing with a yeastiness. The mouthfeel is medium-full with a bit of dryness at the end. Overall, a very nice and interesting release. I would certainly drink this again."
"Drinkability - this is a good ale, but not a great one. I'd go for a 750 ml. bottle every now and then, but not on any kind of regular basis. Also, high abv limits sessionability."
"I believe this one is about a year old, it seems like more age will continue to do justice to this one, not quite sure how this one is called a Belgian dark ale, more of a porter or lighter stout to me, only the second Ommegang beer I have tried but a good one, I recommend it, especially this time of year"
"We mixed the last few glasses with a sweet Kriek Lambic and it was sensational."
"Overall: Wouldnt buy this again, i got it in the 3 pack and must say the the 3 philosophers and hennipin are better, and im really not a fan of saisons."
"Good, not incredible, but good. I prefer Brooklyn's chocolate stout better...richer, but this is pretty good...and a little different as well. Worth a try for a unique tasting experience."
"Poured into my DFH Chalice. Presented with an incredibly luscious foamy mocha-colored head and generous belgian lacing (unfortunately, this was the best part) throughout the tasting. Black and opaque with scents of chocolate and malt. Flavors similar to nose; however, a strange metallic taste as well, kind of like pennies. Decent mouthfeel, not too thin and not too chewy with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty much destroyed by the metallic flavoring that lingers at the finish, although it did seem to dissipate as the brew warmed up a little. I was so stoked to finally track this brew down; what a disappointment. What happened Ommegang? Planning on trying it on draft this weekend and I'm hoping the metallic taste will be less intense."
"Once again enlightened about Beer Styles. I didn't realize that the envelope of acceptable interpretations was so wide. I imagine that would drive a consumer of wine into a tizzy. I also figure that I was recently more critical than need be of some very enjoyable ales. This years favorites have been more along the effervescent dark fruity variety. (Would this rate higher if it was categorized as a Stout??) Anyway, the label on this one clearly indicates 7% ABV. Pours an opaque darkness with a full finger foamy dark tan head that resists fading. A nice amount lacing in a spotty pattern. The smell is a wonderful creamy milk chocolate stout. Adequately carbonated, the foamy head lends a wonderful creaminess to the full bodied mouth feel. The marque chocolate flavor does not disappoint...yes AB, ""a well crafted chocolaty stout has it hands down over 'fizzy yellow fluid'. A lightly toasted milk chocolate flavor that finishes a little chalky, like the bottom of a glass of aggressively portioned Nestles. Much less of a lingering quality than a roasty character tends to be. The 7% is well hidden. I hesitate to draw comparisons, but i get the same ""Top Shelf"" stout experience from my local Dragonslayer (at 1/3 the price!). However, I've gotta say that this one was ""totally"" worth sampling and if you're going to do a one-of to celebrate 10 Years...then 'you go girls!!' You've gotta love it when a brewery thinks enough about their work to produce something that lets you celebrate that milestone with them! CHEERS!"
"On-tap at Tyler's in Durham, served an almost opaque black with a decent head that leaves great lacing on the glass. The aroma was a little disappointing, some resemblance to a standard Hershey bar, but not much else. The taste totally makes up for the aroma! A wonderful bitter chocolate fills your mouth and leaves the Belgian yeast far in the background. The finish leaves a lingering taste of a Hershey's special dark in your mouth. The beer is medium bodied with low carbonation and warming alcohol. This is a truly enjoyable beer, just a little pricey."
"Quite drinkable but not really all that superior to Hennepin, just different. Best of the ""Belgian Stouts"" that I have tasted so far that counts for something. Not so sure I will buy a second bottle now that I have tried this."
"D: Interesting and drinkable but far from transcendent. Nice to try, but I'll pass next time."
"The beer is easy drinking with no hint of ABV anywhere. A nice anniversary beer from a great brewery!"
"Ommegang with a stout I thought this was a belgen company and their making a stout? Ok at least they did a goog job. Dam near black in color with a tan head taste is of chocolate malt and a hint of plumb. I enjoyed this with a few of those chocolate filled with brandy I highly recomend this as a holiday treat. The only drawback to this beer is its drinkibility this is a once in a while beer."
"This beer poured a very dark brown, almost black color with no light penetrating it. It formed a huge foam dark tan head much like a float that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. An aroma of malt and chocolate. The flavor was of malt, chocolate, slightly of coffee and plum. The body is medium light and the finish is bittersweet. It's listed as a strong dark ale but leans somewhat to a stout/porter class."
"Very excited to see this on tap at Mahar's and jumped at the chance of giving it a try. The brew was poured to a nice black color with a good sized medium colored head that had good retention and left some lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma has a lot of things you would expect, chocolate, roasted malts, raisins/figs but none of the aromas really stuck out, all seemed to be slightly muted. The flavors where nice, and made this an easy drinking brew. The flavors followed the nose, chocolate seems to be the most recognizable with the addition of a slight tartness. Over all this was a good brew but did not live up to my expectations. To me the flavors and aromas seemed to be a little muted but where good. Not sure I would shell out money on this one again."
"D: Excellent! What a nice way to celebrate 10 years."
"Pours an almost effervescent dark brown with a slight creamy looking beige head. Smell is some chocolate and a bit of yeasty alcohol - definately more belgian than stout. This carries over into the taste as well. yes, there is some chocolate in there, but none of the roastiness or bitterness I asscociate with a stout. not picking up any coffee notes, and there is an off taste which is not agreeing with me - possibly faint anise. Mouthfeel was far too thin. Drinks high on the tongue. Drinkability is just OK for me. Alcohol is not an issue, but the off taste combined with the mouthfeel does not make this a very enjoyable drink for me. Interesting, but not a repeat purchase."
"drinkability: fairly good"
"D - Worth a try but I didn't find the flavors blended especially well."
"The mouthfeel was fairly dry as many coffee beers are. Smooth flavor and feel. This would go well with desert. Overall pretty drinkable."
"Drinkability: a slow sipper here, and one bottle will suffice per session. Worth giving this one a try at least once."
"The taste is a battle between the dark malt and the yeast fruityness. Can't quit figure out what they were going for with this beer. It is not a chocolate covered cherry like taste but there is definately a fruit twang on the tongue as it leaves the tongue. That also combines with the 7% alcohol to exasperate the effect. In the end it is not my thing. It has a lighter body with abundant carbonation that finishes clean. It does not have the characteristics of a ""standard"" stout."
"M&D - smooth and slightly fizzy, an easy down beer with a unique flavor that is a great session sweet beer"
"D: More drinkable than I expected, thought it would be overly thck. Dont sense any alcohol really but it does get a little sticky. Not too chocolatey which I am a fan of."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/2"" tan head above the opaque dark brown brew. Thick frothy head is like a rock, with thick sticky lace. Aroma is roasty malt and chocolate. Taste is sweet upfront, chocolatey with light tartness in the middle, and closes with some chalkiness and almost acrid bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, and drinkability is quite nice. Nice Belgian spin on the stout and chocolate."
"Recommended"
"A nice one to, how do you say,...indulge in, every once and awhile."
"Notes: More of an American stout than a Belgian dark ale, in my opinion. Regardless, this is good."
"T - Interesting, sweet and bitter chocolate notes, with nice, balanced fruit and cream. This is interesting, and dangerously drinkable."
"This is a tasty stout. Not as sweet as you might think, based on the name ""chocolate indulgence."" It bears more stout quality than chocolate, which I find to be a good thing. And it's almost too easy to drink a .750ml of this by myself (which I did). It goes great with pumpkin pie. Just in time for the holidays!"
"What a fantastic ""stout"" I can tell already this will be a favorite choice for the winter months. Hopefully I can find it with out too much trouble"
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet chocolate scent along with a stiff roasted malt aroma. The taste is decent. It has a dry, bittersweet chocolate flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and toastey. There is a slight Belgian yeast presence in the finish. The taste is not as rich as I expected. The taste is there, but it's not as pronounced as I had hoped. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine stout. I was expecting better, but it's still a quality offering."
"A very interesting brew here. Nicely drinkable, but the chocolate could be more prominent. Seems like a combo of a Belgian dark ale and a foreign stout."
"This is a disappointment overall. Not as rich as I hoped and the yeast strain doesn't seem to work so well here. The metallic notes are too strong, to boot."
"FYI, I poured slow but it does note it on the bottle to pour it slow. I read after I poured it."
"Overall- Just ok. The chocloate was very subdued."
"This is a moderately drinkable beer... I'll have to treat the rest of it like a higher ABV ale, as I'm more inclined to sip this slowly. The most interesting thing to me is that this tastes very similar to a chipotle chocolate ale I made about a year ago... maybe I'll dust the last little bit with some chipotle powder and find out!"
"D - A fan of Belgians may be really into this. I think it's missing the mark as a stout. Not bad, fairly drinkable Belgian dark."
"Mouthfeel is on the good side of medium and has a slightly creamy consistency. Very drinkable, but mostly because the alcohol is hidden and there's nothing much going on. Very little taste. I'm vastly disappointed. Did I get an off bottle? Am I just missing something? I expect much better from Ommegang. Overpriced and underdone."
"Rich, deep brown color with a cocoa tan head on top. Rather bland aroma-somewhat chocolatey and yeasty but faint. Ok flavor-a lot less chocolate then I expected. Sharp, metallic flavor. Some bitterness against the mild chocolate flavor. Needs to be faintly sweeter for my liking. Average mouthfeel. Pretty average overall. I was expecting much more from this beer. Ommegang tends to put out top notch stuff-they missed their mark here. Too expensive for what is inside"
"Pours a very dark brown with slight ruby tones, not quite opaque. A fair amount of dirty brown head forms but dissipates to a tracing. Esters battle it out with the chocolate in the aroma, with lots of dark fruits, slight high notes and some sweet cacao in the end. I would call this more a Belgian than a chocolate beer. On the palate, the chocolate becomes more pronounced. It blends fairly well with the fruit like yeast tones, never becoming cloying. The finish is very similar to one in a good dark chocolate bar, one like Valrhona where there are lots of fruity characters. The lack of sweetness detracts from the chocolate flavor, I feel, whereas a chocolate stout from Rogue balances nicely with some lactose added. Overall, it's an interesting concept, one I would drink again if only it wasn't so expensive."
"It is easy to go over board with flavors in specialty stouts such as this one, but the smooth finish makes this one very drinkable."
"Pours a muddy, dark maple in color beneath a slightly tanned, carbonation filled head. Ringed and condensed lacing are left down the tulip's sides until the last sip. Powdery, milk chocolate with hints of dark chocolate as well; notes of mocha. Dark, fruity esters: raspberry, cherry. A lingering metallic aroma that really comes through over the other richer aromas. As in the aroma, the metal flavor is present practically from beginning to end, but the rich, creamy chocolate flavors certainly come through. Fudge, rough espresso beans, and mocha; hints of heavy cream with a thin layer of mustiness from the yeast strain. Full in body; slightly dry and carbonated, but is able to back up the chocolately rich malt flavors. Not one of my favorite offerings from Ommegang, and I'm not sure if there was something wrong with the tap lines providing the metallic flavor/aroma or if it was the offering itself. I guess that I'll have to purchase a bottle and find out."
"D - fairly enjoyable, but not sure I'd pick this up again"
"I see that this has been classified as a Belgian strong dark. If we had a Belgian Stout category, this would be where it belongs- yet another argument for a designation of the style on BA. Pours black with a tan head that fades somewhat to athin cap but leaves some quite nice lacing as well. Smell is of milk chocolate with an underpinning of a slight Belgian sourness- somewhat winey.A dusty cocoa on the finish. The taste is nicely balanced between cocoa and some slight Belgian twang from the yeast. Quite chocolatey but smooth and somewhat light as well. Clean and delicious. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth.Quite drinkable.I hadthis after a Czar imperial stout from Avery and was thankful for the relative lack of sweetness in this one."
"It poured a dark brown, almost black with a frothy coffee brown head that settled to cap the ale beneath. It smelled of cocoa, caramel and coffee. The taste was a little disappointing. With all that aroma I expected more of a chocolate and malt effect. However, I did find the dark malt and hint of cocoa with a touch of caramel in the taste. It was thinner in the mouth than I expected as well. I am a big fan of Ommegang's brews, but this one didn't stand up to their reputation."
"drinkability is good. an interesting mix of stout and belgian character, leaning more towards the belgian side. balanced and interesting, but not my favourite of the night."
"Flavor is disappointing. Where's the chocolate? Should be called Incognito rather than Indulgence because it is pretty well hidden. There is mostly a yeasty flavor, some cocoa and caramel, but there is no burst of rich chocolate as one might expect. Not very complex, not very enjoyable. A big letdown, I feel cheated."
"Save the room in your stomach."
"Mouthfeel, too, was a bit of a let down. Very thin for the style and pretty much watery. Because of the big metallic taste and much-too-thin mouthfeel, I didn't even finish the thing. Very upsetting."
"D: This is an interesting offering from Ommegang - something a little different, but still quite tasty. Definitely worth trying."
"Basically opaque dark brown/black color topped by a whipped, frothy orangy-cocoa looking head. Everywhere on the glass too. Smells mostly...delightful like creamy fruity thick cocoa, bittersweet and dark chocolate. Its chocolaty and Belgian, and those two things go well together. Tastes matches the smell. There's not much to dislike about this beer. Its really enjoyable and mouthfeels awesome. Thick, fluffy and all encompasing. Mouth watering chocolate all throughout the finish. This is actually a lot like a fine chocolate beer cake."
"Very black with a nicely controlled frothy cream head. Smells like a dark dessert - rich chocolate over dark, juicy berries and oranges. Dark flavor is more ""Belgium"" than ""chocolate"". Vinous fruit, creamy cocoa center, followed by an unexpected blast of dry yeast. I seem to get a different impression of the flavor with each sip I take. Lightish for a stout, but creamy. It gets a bit more chocolaty towards the end of the glass as it warms. Pretty unique, which is always good for a special anniversary beer."
"* Bottle itself says Stout, ranked here as Dark Ale. Seems much more Dark Ale than Stout."
"Happy 10th Anniversary, Ommegang!"
"Many people I know have been singing the praises of this beer, but I was simply disappointed. Maybe it ages well and the stringency dies down a little, but for now, I'd pass on this one."
"D--Recommended, nice flavor and worth a try."
"A great dessert beer."
"Funny that it's not classified as a stout. Definitely qualifies kind of like an imperial stout here. The aftertaste is impressive and for the price, I feel it was a good choice. I might buy a second or third bottle to age down the road as this beer can only get better with age."
"So smooth and delicious. Easy to drink, complex but not overpowering. Alcohol barely shows. So enjoyable. Only downfall is the mouthfeel - expected something fuller in body. Kind of like a Rogue Chocolate Stout meeting a Belgian Dark Ale. Excellent."
"Drinkability- This beer is like a cross between a Baltic and roasted porter, combined with some Belgian yeast. Overall decent beer, might pick a bottle up to stash in the cellar, and revisit it in a year."
"This indulgent creation pours a pitch back color with just the slightest hint of reddish highlights playing in the light. A voluminous head of frothy, cocoa colored whipped cream filles the top of the large goblet I've poured this beer into, threatening to spill over the edge. I quickly whisk the overflow from the rim of the glass with my finger and bring it to my mouth - a small hint of what is to come. Intricate patterns of lacing line the inner rim of the goblet as the head settles back slightly from the edge. A gorgeous pour. The nose made itself apparent immediately after opening the caged and corked 750ml bottle. The aroma of liquid baker's chocolate and a note of Belgian yeast wafted through the air and beckoned me to inhale deeper. In the nose, this beer is definitely a chocolate indulgence i every respect. Along with the heady chocolate aroma, however, I detect hints of dry oak, dark tree fruits and the tell-tale Belgian yeast strain. A complex nose, dominated but not overrun with chocolate goodness. The palate gives me a sensuous dose of slightly bitter baker's chocolate mingled with dark fruit, yeast and a rather strong flowery hop presence. Accompanying this array of flavors is a slightly sour undertone, putting the ""Belgian"" stamp on this unusual stout. Incredibly complex, yet very well balanced. This is nothing like a sweet stout, or milk stout. This Belgian-inspired creation has much more in common with a dry Irish stout, in my estimation, although this isn't a fair or complete comparison either. The Belgian yeast lends a very unique charater to this stout - not to mention the chocolate additions. The mouth feel is one of the best aspects of this beer, for me. Absolutely silky smooth and creamy without being thick or sticky. I love the fact that this stout isn't excessively heavy, allowing the flavors to assert themselves and then leave the mouth cleanly. The alcohol is extremely well hidden as well - only lending a slightly warming feel in the back of the mouth, accentuating the silky nature of this black treat. A very drinkable experience that lands somewhere between a dry stout and a Belgian strong dark ale. A brilliant contrast. If you're a chocolate lover, this is liquid bliss. If you're also a Belgian ale lover, this is probably pretty close to heaven in a bottle. Another truly excellent creation from Brewery Ommegang."
"Drinkability: A real treat. I wish I hadn't been the only one drinking this, as it was fairly easy to finish, though it is a lot of complex brew to handle in one sitting, no matter how slowly you drink it. But a great 10th anniversary brew, done extremely well, and perfect for the weather here in Richmond as the leaves fall, the wind starts to blow, and the nights get shorter. Though the label says, via Dickens, something about friends with chocolate, friends bringing this, and sharing it with you, or the other way around, would certainly also be a great thing."
"D: Obviously a sipper. Had this for desert after dinner and it really hit the spot. The chocolate flavor is very subtle right now. This would probably taste a lot better in a few months. I am going to go back and grab another bottle to do just that."
"This is another great beer from Ommegang. Good flavors from start to finish."
"Both full-bodied and light at the same time, this beer is very drinkable and probably highly addictive. Admittedly, I'm a fan of this style so I do have a slight bias. Not sure what separates a belgian strong dark ale from an imperial stout, but whatever you call it, it's delicious."
"Smooth and creamy but drier in the finish. Heavy on the palate overall, but somewhat mild in flavor for the style. I was very intrigued by the prospect of a Belgian chocolate stout. However after tasting, I would certainly question the style. A solid selection, but in my opinion it is a lot of build-up for a mearly decent beer."
"Drinkable. The alcohol is there but the blend of the chocolate and other flavors masks it well. Drinking this one at the correct temp makes a difference. Let it warm before serving."
"Purchased at the brewery on its release day (Waffles and Puppets). Dark chocolate in color with faint chestnut highlights and a clumpy and sticky dark khaki foam cap. Soft cocoa, earthy vegetal notes, and slight yeast funk in the aroma. Large yeasty character in the flavor, with mild chocolate and a more assertive roastiness coming through midway. Cherry and prune. Earthy, slightly acrid mineral finish. Yeast funkiness lingers on the palate and blossoms in the aftertaste. Medium in body, although it feels fairly light, lending to an increased drinkability. Peppery twinge at the finish of a smooth, but light mouthfeel. Has the chocolate and roast aspects of an English stout, but clearly the Belgian house yeast Ommegang uses has taken this one over and made it its own. The result is that not much chocolate is detectable. Truly a unique beer."
"Poured out of a 750 mL bottle into a pint glass. Looks delicious. Almost like drinkable motor oil. A very strong head that hangs around for a while. Very good looking beer. I was expecting more chocolate in the smell, but it's dominated by the alcohol. I got traces of chocolate but it was mostly alcohol. The taste is very interesting. The mixture of chocolate and the sweetness of the alcohol blend to form a very interesting brew. Very rich, fairly drinkable beer. I'm definitely going to have to try this one again."
"Corked and caged 750ml bottle poured into a large Duvel tulip glass. Pours a pitch black color with a tan head. The aroma is dark roasted malts, slightly sweet dark chocolate and yeast. The taste much like the aroma is dark and roasty with a rather dry finish. Overall, this is a very nice chocolate stout with a unique Belgian spin. Recommended."
"A great beer. I wish more brewers would try interesting projects like this that don't fit style guidelines. It inspires the homebrewer in me."
"Drinkability/Overall: Chocolate Indulgence? Not sure I'd go quite that far. The chocolate plays a supporting role here, but one that is well-nuanced. Certainly more BSDA than stout, which I would expect coming from Ommegang. Overall, another exquisitely-made, well-conceived beer from Ommegang. Perhaps not completely as-advertised, but a fine beer nonetheless."
"I took my time consuming this, and it was time well spent. ""Indulgence"" was the right word to use. A very luxurious beer, whether it's really a stout or not."
"I have been anxiously waiting this beer. I was not disappointed. The beer is phenomenal. I bought 4 bottles sight unseen, gave 1 to a fellow dark beer fan, then went out and replaced the 1 I gave away. This will stay a staple in my collection."
"Hmmm.... Max's beer list indicates the abv. is 7%. That's pretty much what it tastes like."
"Pours a deep, dark chocolate color with a thinnish light brown head that is fairly dense. There is good lacing. The smell is a combination of chocolate and coffee. The chocolate reminds me of a semi sweet. There is also a very slight almond nuttiness to it as well. The taste disappointed a little bit compared to the smell. There was a definite chocolate flavor that was a bit bitter but there was a slight sweetness when the beer first hits your mouth. Mouthfeel was good and drinkability the same. This is a fine chocolate stout that I could drink again and again"
"I got pretty excited when I saw this beer hooked up at the Bowery Whole Foods beer room. It pours very dark and black...like 99% black. It has a great, thick, frothy, tan colored head with amazing retention. The head leaves lace the whole way down while keeping a thin layer protecting the beer. It has strong smells of burnt coffee and chocolate roasts, very nutty (hazelnuts especially), definitely some alcohol and maybe even dark berries (or cherries). The tastes are very similar...chocolate, coffee, even a little doughy. The mouthfeel of this beer is hands down the best aspect...its so silky and smooth; unlike any other beer I have had (or at least up there with some of the silkiest). It goes down great and the drinkability is top-notch. Well done Ommegang."
"I was stoked to try this beer and well for good reason,poured into an imperial pint glass a deep but not opaque black a little ruby tint when held up to the light,a big two finger frothy head atop leaving gobs of lace as it settled very slowly.The Belgian malts impart spiced bread aroma that intertwines with some bitter chocolate and roasted grain,just silky smooth it glides down effortlessly just full and rich.Wow the chocolate imparted in this brew really shines but it is not over done or to sweet bittersweet chocolate mixed with dark roast coffee with just a hint of orange peel that shows through in a lingering finish wich just added to the beers complexity.Although Iam not the biggest Belgian beer fan in the world this American ""big"" stout really brings the the best of Belgium with the malts and premium chocolate together to make a great great beer in my mind."
"From a growler purchased at WFM in the Lower East side of good ole' NYC last night. The growler fill dude had just hooked up a new keg, this is some pretty fresh and clean stuff. Pours the expected almost coal black, moderate carbonation, loose, minor head and not much in the way of lacing. Nose is pure silky luxorious chocolate, with a hint of some dark smoky grains. Tasty, subtle, chocolatey brew, dark, smokey and easy on the tongue. Notes of medium chocolate, light brandy, raisiny. Stout like, with moderate Belgian, yeasty feel. I need to try the bottled version as well as enjoy this with a dessert of some sort. Quality creation, fine sipper. Nice to see Omme roll out some quality new offerings"
"The beer came in a classy looking 750 ml bomber with a wire cage and a cork. The cork popped up on its own while being unscrewed, and the pour revealed a highly carbonated dark brown stout. The head looked like whipped cream on a hot chocolate. The smell of this beer was sweet and full of chocolate. The real chocolate present in the beer showed up very well in the smell. And unlike most other beers of this type, there was not a hint of roastiness. The taste felt the same way, and reminded me of the occasions when I had paired dark chocolate with a stout, except this time everything was already in the glass. Very well blended taste as the dark malt and chocolate played off each other's strengths. The taste started off like a dark chocolate, and finished with a sweet flair. If was to pick a bone with something, it would be the sort of thin body. Everything else about this beer was indulgent and luscious as promised on the label. Dessert in a bottle with a second helping to spare."
"Dark almost black in color, creamy brown head, Smells of cocoa rather than chocolate. The head leaves some nice lacing and there's a lot of sticking to the sides as you drink this beer. You can taste some bitter sweet and semi sweet chocolate along with a large amount of cocoa. This beer is very smooth and has next to no bitterness except a tiny bit at the end. Tiny bit of roasted coffee in the after taste. Overall a great brew I had it out of the bottle and on tap at the brewery on it's release day. I don't know after the first I had another bottle with a friend. At 7%ABV I think this could use a little mellowing from cellering to smooth it out a bit more."
"Poured out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle that came with a nice Ommegang goblet. The color is very near black, the only brown I could see was when I held it straight against a light source and then it was only on the outer most edges. The tan head is thick and leaves some nice lacing. The smell is of semi-sweet chocolate, perhaps a touch of smoke. The taste is of powdery cocoa, bitter chocolate, carob, light roasted coffee and a metallic twang. I pick up a very slight fruitiness every now and again. The feel is silky smooth and well bodies; the metallic aftertaste is a bit undesirable. Great brew, great chocolate flavors mixing well with the roasted malt. Definitely a sipper, hard to finish off the 750 ml."
"shared a bottle at union jacks pub glenside with fellow staffer and 2 patrons. chocolate isnt over the top .... great stout with nice mouthfeel. perfect abv. good balance for this type of brew.i usually cant take a 250z. of imperial stout to the head until 'round xmas time.. but this was quite easy (with friends).will try it on draft next."
"On-tap at Cole's at $9 a pint. Mike, you are the best at getting stuff like this in. Deep chocolate, I expected to sip but it went down quicker. Lots of lace and full mouthfeel. Bitter finish and more bitter baking chocolate edge aftertaste, rather than sweet or bittersweet. I must have again..for dessert."
"Final Note: Happy 10th Anniversary Ommegang, keep up the good work!"
