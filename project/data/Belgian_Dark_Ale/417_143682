3.91,3.2,3.25,4,4,3.5,4,"Snowstorm pours a dark amber color with a small lacing head.  There is a very nice spicy aroma, big hints of dark spices, and dry fruits.  The taste is the same, big spice bill, lots of dry fruit.  Body a a tad weak, but nice body.  Overall very spicy, very flavorful.","vette2006c5r","Dec 30, 2014"

3.61,-4.7,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall:  I like to try the Schell Snowstorm each year even when it might be a style that I don't prefer.  This year's version reminds me of a dubbel, but it looks like I enjoyed it more than Snowstorm 2007 which was actually called a dubbel.  Fruity and earthy but more breadiness than most dubbels per my senses.","Mdog","Dec 17, 2014"

4.17,10,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"This is really complex.  Seems to match several of the latest Snowstorms in moderate alcohol drinks that take time to get to know and enjoy most fully.  As with the previous ones I'm sure I'll get to know this one better and in time our friendship will grow - maybe that's what they mean by "great growth" (literal translation of Grand Cru).   Or maybe it's just a special seasonal beer.  Either way, another Snowstorm to enjoy.  I'm glad it's here.","garymuchow","0"
