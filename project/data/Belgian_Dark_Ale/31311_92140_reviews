"Triporteur From Hell jest bardzo pijalne, gładkie i jest ... no i się skończyło, cholera jasna ..."
"Not nearly as good as the lighter colored version. This also had a very foamy, active head, but it settled down soon to a nice light thin cover, some lace, and a dark brown color. Aroma is yeast and malt. Flavor is similar to nose, dry, and a bit gamey. Body is decent. Technically good, but esthetically not so much."
"This I like, this I like a lot."

"cheeky here, from hell, with an abv of 666, i mean, nice guys! the beer is cool but i think its the lesser of the two, still, neat to try them side by side. this isnt all that dark, somewhat of a brown ale look to it, nice froth and excellent carbonation on the feel. the nose is more belgian yeast than dark malt, and the flavor has quite a bit of hops to it. sort of a weird in between as far as styles go, with the belgian yeast in a hoppy darker beer. unique though, and real drinkable with just a subtle dark malt flavor to go with the bittering hops and fruity ester heavy yeast. seems light with the soda pop carbonation, but something is weird with the proportions of this one, as drinkable as it is. i liked this, but probably wouldnt buy it. the from heaven version though is an outstanding belgian pale, definitely worthy of being stocked in the fridge. again, cool to have these opposing brews in succession."

"Appearance is dark and opaque with a large tan head which fades slowly. leaving fair amount of lacing on the glass.  Aroma is soft and malty with a slight toasted note. No hop aroma or other aromas noted. Flavor is malty with subtle toasted malt background. No hop, fruit, or other flavors noted. Slightly sweet on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with mild carbonation. Overall impression: Not as complex as I had hoped. Overall it was very simple and straightforward. And there's nothing wrong with that. A good beer for sitting by the fire with friends after a day outside on the slopes."

"Pours a dark mahogany brown with a half finger dark khaki head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark fruit, rye, brown sugar, light clove and cinnamon. Flavor is heavily spice dark fruit, caramel and chocolate malt, earthy dried herbs, clove, brown sugar flavor (but it is not sweet). Finishes with more earthy summer herbs and herbal bitterness, somewhat astringent. Medium bodied with great carbonation. An interesting and earthy spice take on the style. The initial flavors are intriguing, with quite a bit of complexity. Flavors of clove, rosemary and sage, although I'm not sure those were used here. Finish is herbal, almost medicinal bitterness. I enjoyed the flavor trip, but it left a bit too astringent flavor lingering. I liked the same herbal flavors in the Heaven better, but Hell is like that, I guess. Kinda grew on me as I drank it, but it is an unusual Belgian dark."

"Dark brown body with ruby edges and a tan head.  Ginger, brown bread, grain and fruit juice to the nose.  Tastes of dark, overripe and slightly soured fruits, cranapple juice, spent grain, spice, slight alcohol heat and oily hop bitterness at the very back. A bit of a metallic, nutty character later on.  Medium-bodied and slightly rought at the edges.  I've had better and I've had a helluva lot worse.  A good Belgian for chillin' with the devil, and I'm sure plenty of work went into getting that ABV just perfect."

"The beer rolls over the tongue with creamy, fruity sugar sweetness seasoned with a touch of fig and a hint of cola. The tap version finishes sticky sweet. The higher carbonation of the bottled version cuts and tempers the sweetness making for a better beer."
"Serving type: bottle."

"Creamy and malty, if youre looking for something that can measure up to a nice sweet dessert this is definitely the beer for you."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, M4TRP bottle code. Pours hazy very dark brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, toast, coffee, brown bread, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, clove, pepper, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, earthy hop, and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, toast, coffee, brown bread, brown sugar, raisin, plum, clove, pepper, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, coffee, brown bread, brown sugar, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly crisp/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian dark ale. Good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Holy Hell! I popped the cap and almost immediately, I got foam coming up the neck and quickly running down the side of the bottle. I placed the bottle inside the glass until I could regroup. I guess that I am lucky that it was not an outright gusher! I can also read, so I utilized a VERY gentle pour and only filled about a quarter of the glass before allowing it to rest. As you may imagine, I ended up with two fingers of frothy, rocky, light-tan head that off-gassed, popped and fizzed its way out of existence. Color was a medium-brown (SRM = > 27, < 34) with ruby highlights. Nose was another raucous melange! I got dried, dark fruits, coffee, dark chocolate, mustiness and even vinousness off of this one. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, but quite effervescent. The roasted malt was the clear driver in this beer. It tasted of coffee and dark chocolate in the mouth, initially, but warming, it took on a dried, dark fruit aspect. I kept thinking of a Cadbury Fruit & Nut Bar, sans the nuttiness. Finish was semi-dry, with the yeast really having done their job, but at the same time, leaving enough sweetness so as not to make it totally dry. This had a vinousness that was interesting, but kind of outside of my scope. If I were to buy another bottle, I might allow it to age for a while."

"Poured from 750 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass)."

"O. This is a excellent beer, we'll balanced mild dark flavors, it just goes down easy, awesome aftertaste"

"O: This beer is quite complex for a Belgian Dark Ale and has the depth of flavors you would expect from a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, yet it is easy to drink because it doesn't have a high alcohol content."

"A good beer with good flavor."

"Bottle bought in March. Poured dark brown with golden as opposed to red undertones, and a thin layer of ivory head that remained as a scrim and laced the glass. Aromas of cherry, sawdust, a sour yeast note, a grassy herbal smell. Toasted caramel malt, red fruits, a coriander and sour note, just a bit of hop spice with little bitterness. Nice creamy feel but with a clean finish, coating but not cloying."
"The taste is a caramel, chocolate and candi sugar. This reminds of chocolate and plums. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. The yeast adds a nice Belgian fruitiness."

"""Scooter from Hell"". Gotta love it, especially with that stated ABV... Anyway, this stuff pours a very dark sienna topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises toasted rye bread, light chocolate, light clove, brown sugar, and a pinch of black pepper. The taste brings in more of the same, with the spices melding very well with the cocoa, and everything fading into a toast haze. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a nice Belgian dark, one that balances its spice load with its grains' roastiness pretty well."
