"O: So-so; probably the result of being a bit old. Looks nice enough, and the aroma is satisfyingly fruity. Unfortunately the flavour is rather lacklustre and wishy-washy, with some undesirable off-notes. Body is alright but a bit watery. Not a stand-out brew."

"O: If this beer was as tasty as it is beautiful looking, it would be excellent. But the flavor is just lacking all around. Somewhat enjoyable but probably not a repeat."

"Food match: The spot on acidity levels in this would cut right through a cheese platter well, I would also recommend some fresh crusty bread and creamy soups with this ale."

"Overall... a drinkable version of an abbey from Belgium, bitterness is almost not present but is a refreshing beer too."

"O - Quite nice as a Belgian Dark/Amber, with the crispness as well as the malty, smokey flavours. Perhaps a little too light for my taste, as I'm not greatly experienced in this particular style, but I would have liked a bit more flavour (at least some pleasant aftertaste). However, it is a good beer for a warm day when you still want some of the flavour profile of darker beers with the crispness of an amber."

"Iam not sure if this a Belgian pale in style but i gotta say I liked this beer alot.Poured into a chalice a mix of slightly hazed deep burnt orange and copper color with a great looking billowing light tan colored creamy head atop.Aromas of light spiced phenols,dark fruit,and mild nuttiness.Flavors of not overly sweet toffee and cake,again some nuttiness comes into play along with spice and dark fruit.This a solid Belgian dark in my opinon,very quaffable but packing nice flavors."

"Nice beer. A sipper, and one that would get to be a chore to get thru after 2-3. But still very good."
""
"Overall: This beer was surprising; a quick look at the bottle makes me think of a non-descript blonde ale. This beer contained many challenging layers to this Belgian Beer newbie. I would call it very good, excellent if not for a couple sips with off flavors"

"The beer effortlessly reaches every aspect that blonde ales prescribe. Though its flawless in taste, I keep looking for the intangibles that set it apart. The beer may stop shy of those incredible and unexpected flavors, but the beer is near perfect as it is."
""

"Taste is light fruity with some caramellic and bready notes. The beer has a light mouthfeel, which makes the beer very drinkable, but also lighten the overall experience. There is a light bitterness, which gets more pronounced once swallowed. Aftertaste is bready, crusty and has a medium short bitterness."

"O: It isn't bad, but I prefer other beers in this style"
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian Pale Ale."

"The Corsendonk people know what sells, this is a beer that fits the bill completely."
"Seems quite light and refreshing even though it has a bit of a dark colour."
"This beer drinks very easily but that is the only positive i can tell about this one. Alcohol is so well hidden that you think you are drinking a non alcohol beer. There is no deepness in this beer with a flat taste. At the end the beer became a bit better but that was too late...."
"Conclusion: Even if it does not live up to its nose, this seems to be a perfect summer beer. Also has a bit a begian IPA going on."
"Flavor is solid, but not anything amazing. Lots of Belgian yeasts and malts...infact there's a slight saison presence in the back of the mouth. A great summer beer, decent drinkability. Light mouthfeel, crisp and sharp...high carbonation. A very tasty and solid BPA."
"Pours a reddish copper with a nice thick frothy head. Nose is very clean -- almost soapy -- with aromas of anise and juniper, and perhaps a hint of soft orange or lemon. Flavor is spicy, and a soap/sunscreen character; overwhelmed by the spice, however. A slightly sour finish, and a thin body."
"It surprized me pleasantly."
"A nice little surprise I found today and I'm glad to be the one that adds it. Reminds me of a British bitter with a Belgian twist."
