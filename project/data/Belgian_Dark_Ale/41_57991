Unfortunately the flavour is rather lacklustre and wishy-washy, with some undesirable off-notes. Body is alright but a bit watery. Not a stand-out brew.","jazzyjeff13","Sep 26, 2014"

4.08,6.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.25,"O - Quite nice as a Belgian Dark/Amber, with the crispness as well as the malty, smokey flavours. Perhaps a little too light for my taste, as I'm not greatly experienced in this particular style, but I would have liked a bit more flavour (at least some pleasant aftertaste). However, it is a good beer for a warm day when you still want some of the flavour profile of darker beers with the crispness of an amber.","freneticamnesic","Jun 25, 2013"

3.98,4.2,4.25,3.75,4,4.25,4,"Iam not sure if this a Belgian pale in style but i gotta say I liked this beer alot.Poured into a chalice a mix of slightly hazed deep burnt orange and copper color with a great looking billowing light tan colored creamy head atop.Aromas of light spiced phenols,dark fruit,and mild nuttiness.Flavors of not overly sweet toffee and cake,again some nuttiness comes into play along with spice and dark fruit.This a solid Belgian dark in my opinon,very quaffable but packing nice flavors.","oberon","Jun 07, 2013"

There is a light bitterness, which gets more pronounced once swallowed. Aftertaste is bready, crusty and has a medium short bitterness.","Absumaster","Aug 31, 2012"

3.03,-20.7,3.5,3,3,3,3,"This beer drinks very easily but that is the only positive i can tell about this one. Alcohol is so well hidden that you think you are drinking a non alcohol beer. There is no deepness in this beer with a flat taste. At the end the beer became a bit better but that was too late....","Brabander","Jun 13, 2011"
3.97,3.9,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Conclusion: Even if it does not live up to its nose, this seems to be a perfect summer beer. Also has a bit a begian IPA going on.","YannickB","Dec 30, 2010"
3.68,-3.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Flavor is solid, but not anything amazing. Lots of Belgian yeasts and malts...infact there's a slight saison presence in the back of the mouth. A great summer beer, decent drinkability. Light mouthfeel, crisp and sharp...high carbonation. A very tasty and solid BPA.","ShadesOfGray","Aug 18, 2010"
3.8,-0.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a reddish copper with a nice thick frothy head. Nose is very clean -- almost soapy -- with aromas of anise and juniper, and perhaps a hint of soft orange or lemon. Flavor is spicy, and a soap/sunscreen character; overwhelmed by the spice, however. A slightly sour finish, and a thin body.","gyllstromk","Jun 18, 2010"
