"Poured from a 22oz bomber.  Dark chocolate almost black.  Aromas of dark fruit like dates with a hint of coffee.   Light and slightly creamy.  Definitely taste fruit and coffee.  Only moderately sweet.  Hidden roasted malts.  Very drinkable and smooth.  Close to a stout. Good year around but think it will do better in the winter."

"Strangeways is known for their adventurous brewing, but their year-round offerings Albino Monkey witbier and Woodbooger dark ale are consistent, delicious and very very drinkable."

"The flavor features a strong coffee element. It's not as sweet as the smell suggests, although I do get some cocoa notes. I also note some sourness in the background. Short aftertaste. The body is thinner than I would like and the high carbonation exacerbates this."

"So why the claim to be something else?"

"O - Billed by the brewery as a ""Belgian-style Brown Ale"". Rich dark-roast malt flavor reminiscent of a Porter. Interesting combination of styles and very drinkable."
