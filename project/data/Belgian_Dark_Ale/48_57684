I am really enjoying my glass of Augustijn Brune, as it hits pretty much all of the major notes that I expect from this style, in addition to tasting quite excellent. Rich tasting and full-bodied; an excellent inclusion in this Van Steenberge sampler. A very good quality ale, though not quite on the same level as some of the better Belgian-style dark ales I've had over the years. Still, that's impressive company, indeed.","thehyperduck","Dec 28, 2014"

Head eventually settles into a quarter inch, creamy cap. The brew itself is a brownish-mahogany hue with a slight haziness. Nose expresses dull prune notes and a slight yeastiness. Taste consistent with nose; however, flavors are a bit muted but a slightly vinous character is revealed towards the back. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and a slight acidity. Overall, a decent BSDA, but not much complexity. There are definitely better examples of the style out there.","Jwale73","Jan 01, 2013"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a goblet, no bottle date, but I bought these in November. This pours a fizzy, lightly cloudy brown color with a decent off white / tan color which has good retention and leaves a lacing. The smells are of dark fruit and candied sugar, minimal hop presence. The feel is medium with high carbonination. The taste is quite good, you get the sweet candied sugar and loads of malts but this is a very dry beer which makes an interesting combination.","DavidST","Dec 24, 2012"

3.68,-2.9,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Poured maroon, which appeared a bit redder around the edges. Light tan head with some relatively dense lace and modest head retention.Nose of light toasty grains and breads, a pinch of dark fruit notes come through as well. Dried grapes and some light sugar notes. Fairly simple. Taste has some caramel, dark fruits, a hint of copper, more bread and brown sugars. Drying finish. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium with a carbonation that's a tad crispier and fizzier than I'd hope for; once the carbonation dies down, the body is still too thin for my liking. Still enjoyable, and this could work well with some food pairings I'd gather.","liamt07","Nov 22, 2011"

3.95,4.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, another nice offering from van Steenberge. It's not the most outstanding Belgian dark, but a good beer nonetheless.","evlu1441","Oct 03, 2011"
4.15,9.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"This is a dark amber beer with a nice ratio of foam. This is beer has a non-eventful smell, some what disapointing. Mouthfeel is full of bubbles and that is being proper. The taste is very, well, nice. There are hints of roasting and a nice hoppy mix. We like it! Overall the smell and taste do not match, but do not let that get in the way of having one.","barleyroad","Aug 24, 2011"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a cola brown color with modest sized head, and surprisingly modest compared to many Belgians. Nose has some dark toffee, figs, brownbread, and a nice musty quality. On the palate a black tea element is there, some light caramel, and a light body. Finish is light with more black tea, and I find this ale is very drinkable.","yemenmocha","Jul 26, 2011"
3.77,-0.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"-Overall 4.0: Another very good Van Steenberge beer. This is refreshing and quite a difference from the golden ""dubbles"" that so many of us are accustomed to. Worth sampling when you find it.","BeerDocT","Jul 16, 2011"
3.58,-5.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy orange-ish to brown color with a light tan head. In the aroma, big candy sugar and a small fruitiness. In the taste. a small roast, almost chocolate like, and a small candy sugar in presence. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry small candy sugar in the aftertaste. Big candy sugar and a nice small roast. Nice but nothing exciting.","OWSLEY069","Jul 08, 2011"
3.65,-3.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"M&D: mildly carbonated, medium-bodied, the balance is retained intact throughout the drink, and overall the hop contents seem to make some impact. Not bad, but all in all slightly boring to my taste.","wl0307","Jun 26, 2011"

4.12,8.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"From a stubby bottle into a small snifter, pours a rich brown with an off white head with little lace. Aroma of caramel, malt, and some wood/oak elements. In the flavor, malt driven possessing a faint roasted quality. Muted fruit notes from the yeast and a semi-dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a chalky yeast presence. Overall, a nice abbey brew, authentic and very much a true Belgian.","Stinkypuss","Dec 08, 2010"

3.73,-1.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D: Although the beer is sweet, it's not entirely difficult to drink because the sweetness isn't cloying and is balanced to some degree by the spices.","metter98","May 13, 2010"

3.1,-18.2,3,3,3,4,3,"A nose that evokes esters and roasted malts that offer good odor smell. The palate is sweet without being lightweight and offers, especially in the finish, a spice that is not uninteresting, and offers a taste of some spices on the tongue. A fairly drinkable beer for its type without being extraordinary","ThaCreep","0"
