"Pours a reddish black with a finger of bubbly white head. The aroma is pretty typical of a Belgian, with esters and clovex present. The taste is initially similar, but there's definitely a smokiness there. Medium-light mouth, and the carbonation gives it a nice crispness. Not a bad little brew."

"Pours deep dark Crimson with a creamy head, smells bitter and sour almost like olives, tastes bitter and spiced with a malty character as well, normal mouthfeel and wet finish."
"Great Black ale. Nice and sweet, but chocolatey and slightly smokey, but lighter than a stout. The dry finish makes it feel like I'm drinking a beer instead of eating a cake."

"Pours pitch black with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are decent.  The aroma reminds me of mentholatum.  Kind of odd for a beer, much less a dark beer.  Has a smokey, BBQ taste but not on the strong side.  Very little bitterness is involved."

"It's named perfectly because it pours completely opaque & black. The aroma is not as overpowering as a rhino however. I pick up a subtle roasty malt with a hint of cocoa. The taste mirrors this but adds in a bit of coffee. A very creamy ale with a toasty aftertaste. Very sessionable."

"O- I was a little let down by this one because I love dark ales and one of the first beers I ever had was a Belgian black ale, back in 2006. Alas, this one just did not hit the spot."

"Overall the beer is extremely good and rather enjoyable. I highly recommend it and will be drinking this one again."

"""Not the best dark-style I've tried, but it's got it's own quirky appeal. I recommend it when you're in the mood for something that won't strangle your taste buds but will still stand out a little. Unique without blowing your mind."""
"Pours out a nice dark brown color, almost black in appearance, its topped off with a semi-dark tan head thatâ€™s bubbly and quickly dissipates into a thin ring of lacing with an island of bubbles in the middle. Floral and fruity aromas are present, some spiced apples and mild fig smells too. This is a very bitter ale at first, good roasted coffee flavors do come through, the spices and fruits take a back seat and are detectable. It is dry and light-to-medium bodied. The aftertaste is sweet, the bitterness calms down, the roasted coffee mellows out, and the spice comes through a bit more. The bitterness calms down, as the ale warms up, overall not a bad beer."
