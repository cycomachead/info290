"Had this beer on tap at the brewery off the 163 freeway. Pretty tasty beer, no complaints. I noticed the BeerAdvocate community tends to give this style of beer a rating that never really approaches 4 for the average, but this one is pretty good for the style."

"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some nice aromas and flavors for the style."

"I had this beer at Societe on a recent trip to San Diego. The beer arrives with a dark copper color and generous head. Aromas of yeast and bread dominate the nose. The flavor is a little white peppery with very little, if any, phenolic clovey flavors (a good thing IMO)."

"Very drinkable, but not one of Societe's more exciting beers."

"Decent, but lacking. Simply and straight up: decent, but lacking."

"Belgian yeasty flavors along with some mango and pineapple. A touch of sweetness and a perfumey hint to finish. Thoroughly pleasant and easy drinking beer with less intensity of flavor."
