"Super light Belgian Dark. Not a huge fan honestly"

"O: I can't say much screamed Belgian, but it was a nice change of pace from all the hop bombs consumed before it."

"This is surprisingly thin-bodied—delicate?—with the roast and a mellow malt finish."

"On tap at Russian River in Santa Rosa. Brown color, dark looking. Aroma was sweet, chocolate, nice. Flavor was quite good, chocolate, malts, yeast, really a solid offering. I also liked teh bottle cap with the broken heart. Nice stuff and a shame I can't drink this on tap in Denver though I should just be happy to see any Russian River at all."

"Tried this one at the source. Pours brown pour with ruby edges and an off white to khaki creamy head on top. Low aromatics with some dark malts, a little roast, some yeast, chocolate, dark fruit. Very smooth velvety mouthfeel with low carbonation. Flavor is chocolate covered raisins, some yeast spice, very smooth, lightly sweet, no bitter. Pretty solid brew, and seems very similar to Salvation to me."

"O: This was very good, but far overshadowed by Pliny the Younger, for which I was there that day. Definitely worth a try, but don't use it on valentines day as a coping mechanism for any rejection that might come your way. If you can, use Pliny."

"On tap at the brew pub. Served in a goblet this beer had a thin topping of tan head that quickly receded. Black. Aromas of dark malts not picking up any yeast. Flavor is indeed malty. This beer tastes like a porter to me. Not sure what makes it Belgian inspired-maybe a hint of esters in there but it is weak. Well carbonated and medium bodied a flavorful beer that is average but solid."

"O: If you are within a couple of hours of the brewery, this beer may be worth the trip if you like belgian beers."

"Pours an almost opaque super brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and some char aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"D - Very drinkable. Really nicely balanced Belgian dark ale."

"Another tick on the Russian River –tion Quest that I started quite awhile back! Big thanks goes out to estocker for sending me this one a LONG time back! Shared this one the day after aasher’s wedding while the entire wedding party was hanging out by the pool in the Destin, FL sun! A growler gusher!?!? Served from growler into a Boulevard tulip. Poured a massively dark brown (almost black) with a two finger light khaki colored head that subsided to a half finger extremely slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, roasted malt, bread, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, banana, fruit, and bread. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I was really surprised that this one held up as well as it did after over a year of being stored in my fridge. Surprisingly there were quite a few non-craft beer enthusiasts at this pool party and a lot of them really liked this brew upon sampling it. This was a good thing as it would have been hard for aasher and I to pound the entire 64 oz growler. There were lots of nice notes going on here that kept your palate guessing on each sip which was a nice aspect. It was also refreshing making it easy to drink out in the extremely hot weather. Definitely a must try."
"This one gushed a bit out of the growler. It pours a medium bodied cola brown in color with a two finger, creamy beige head. The nose is smooth and creamy with dry dark malt character and a touch of Belgian yeast. It's light and dry, somewhere between a Belgian Brune and an Irish Dry Stout. It's pretty mellow yet sessionable. It's a nice Belgian dark ale, just nothing crazy."

"Overall: Another pretty good TION beer, but not a terribly interesting style. I'm not sure of the style of this one, but it seems like a Belgian Black Ale"
"O: An easy drinking dark Belgian. Relatively low alcohol makes this quite quaffable. Not one of my favorite RR beers, but I’d never turn this down."

"T: Floral hops upfront followed by some day old coffee and roasted malt. A hint of dark chocolate and anise as well. I didn't get much of a ""Belgian"" feel from this at all and I feel like a touch of Belgian yeast could have given this one a little more depth, which it needed."
"A relatively simple Belgian dark (porter?). Good, but not great. Glad I got the opportunity to try this on-tap only treat."
"Medium bodied with lots of roasted dark malt as well as some zesty spice and sweet dark fruit notes. Lots of dark chocolate malt flavor along with hints of toffee, coffee bean and caramel countered by peppery spice, candy sugar and dark fruit which provide subtle sweetness. Still the dark malts dominate the flavor, lingering into a dry finish."
"O- mouthfeel aside, this is a strong offering that is different than any other belgian dark I have had, but hey, different is good! Solid offering from RR."
"M: The porter-like Belgian ale surprised me, dark and forboding but quite drinkable. Plus, I'm never one to turn Russian River down."
"The overall, and drinkability of Rejection is good. It has a fairly unique flavor profile. Not something I personally would crave, but I would not turn down another taste. Since it's a limited yearly release, it's worth a try though, and I was glad that I got the chance to taste this years."
"a very nice valentines day special beer from RR"
"jd"
"Bit watery. Forgettable."
"Rejection-Belgian inspired black beer brewed for Valentine's Day & 6.1%. It poured a cola brown. It smelled of malt, vanilla, caramel with some coffee notes. It tasted pretty much the same as the nose- vanilla, toffee, roasted malt and espresso. It was my friends' favorite beer of the evening- and he loves Pliny the Younger."
"Pretty darn drinkable, a little thin and dry for my taste."
"D - Very good overall."
"Very drinkable beer, this growler went very quickly. Not extremely complex or intense but highly enjoyable. Another fine Russian River offering."
"Draught at RR during the PtY release madness. Almost black with a small tan head. Lots of fruit in the nose, with what strikes me as their house yeast ester profile. Plenty of rich malt in the aroma as well, with chocolate and toast. Modest bitterness with just a touch of roast and mild apparent hops in the finish that bring a nice balance that barely leans on malty. Fruity with a definite yeasty touch, but also very clean. Nice chocolate malty flavors leading to a pleasant dryness. Pretty much a flavorful Belgian-style porter from what I taste. Very nice."
"Draft, Russian River. Pliny the Younger 2010 release. Another semi-disappointment from this day. Rejection isn't bad, but my standard for RR is unbelievably high and this beer is fairly forgettable and outshone by almost all of the rest of the menu. It pours coffee black with a thin off-white head. There's a fair bit more candi sugar presence than expected. The flavor is mostly coffee/cocoa with some background malt fruitiness and a touch of Belgian yeast. I found the mouthfeel to be a bit grainy leading to a somewhat thin, watery finish. This wasn't great, but I certainly wouldn't turn down a glass, either. It's hard to tell how much the riches of SF Beer Week are effecting my relative rating scale."
"O: This beer just struck a chord with me. Bravo. Another grest RR brew."
"D: Another offering from Russian River that I've been looking forward to trying, but somewhat of a let down. Of course, I'm still glad to have been able to get a glass."
"Enjoyed this over conversation, but while not heartbroken, I was somewhat disappointed by it..."
"Mouthfeel is a full medium with lots of carbonation and is one of the better parts of the beer. Drinkability=I would drink it if it was the only RR beer I could get, but there are just soooo many better choices."
"Notes: Awesome, amazingly drinkable and unique beer."
"I missed this one last year and forgot how good this beer tastes. A nice seasonal beer that is unique and tasty."
"Thoughts - for a Belgian dark ale, I would not have expected any roasted barley/coffee flavors that I would expect from a porter. However, it worked very nicely with this brew and was indeed very tasty."
"I liked this. Nice balance between the roasted and sweeter notes and the more yeasty esters knew their place in the profile. Plus there was a robust hoppy freshness about the whole thing that only Russian River can do. This drank nicely for an over 6% beer as well."
"Tap @ O'Briens TION night. Poured very dark brown, almost black, with a short, rapidly fading off-white head. Roasted malt and smoked aroma, some chocolate. Loose mouthfeel and felt kind of flat. Grainy and malty up front, but more earthy than roasted. It was hard to determine if the bitterness was from the chocolate flavors or brett; either way it was pleasantly unusual. Bits of coffee and dried fruits popped up here and there. Overall, the taste was muted; not necessarily watery, but weaker than wished for."
"M & D- Medium body with noticeable carbonation. I would love to try this again. A very interesting beer."
"D- Due to it's limited availability in my area I was glad to get it on tap once but I could have drank much more. A nice low abv belgian sytle that I could drink year round."
"Beer pours a dark black with a rather large, fluffy off-white head. The intense carbonation and head surprised me (pleasantly) coming from a growler. The smell is 'dark' with roasted malt the primary scent, also some wood, licorice, and root. Taste is pretty much similar. There are some light chocolate and anis flavors, but the roasty, earthy taste is most noticeable. Beer goes down very easily and is much more sessionable than others from RR. This is a fine beer, but not terribly memorable, and not one of my favorite offerings from RR. Very glad to get a chance to try...."
"Drinkability is quite good. Solid dark Belgian beer. Not an earth shattering powerhouse of flavors, just a nice easy drinking beer that is very sessionable."
"A great beer that stands alone amongst many others there at RR."
"On Tap at the brewpub. Arrives in a stubby wine glass, the correct name for which is not in my vocabulary. Looks a nice dark brown with a quarter inch light brown head and good retention. Smells yeasty and biscuity with some vague fruit. Definitely smells like a Belgian style beer, but its not clear what style exactly. Flavor has definite fruit and yeasty veins. Strong malt undertone and a slight roasted note. Roasted flavor makes me think porter, but its not that by any means. A bit overly dry on the finish, where more fruit flavor would be welcome. Medium to full bodied with a creamy/frothy mouthfeel. A nice drinker, despite the dryness."
"D: Easy to drink, but would probably rank this amongst the few RR beers that I don't care for too much."
"D - If this beer wasn't so dry I would have quite a few more."
"I was looking forward to trying this new creatively named valentine's day beer. Color was black, taste was dry, bitter, and to me, burnt, with a thin mouthful. I did not like it at all, but maybe my palette was too sour'ed out by Vinne's other masterpieces. I'm looking forward to trying it again, maybe with food, and maybe I'll like it more..."
"Had low expectations for this beer. Was way better than I thought. Not sure why I felt this way but hey the beer was awesome. Awesome color, nice lacing / head. Balance with acidity coco coffee, not a long finish but very fun and enjoyable. Would go great with food. Glad to have tried this rare brew."
"Not my favorite beer from RR, but certainly not a bad beer. Glad I had a chance to try this one."
"Had this on tap at Russian River brewery today. Described on the chalk board as a Belgian Black Ale, or something like that. And black it is, with a nice tan head. Smell and taste are essentially dark roasted notes, a little coffee, but lighter than a stout by far. Pretty drinkable brew, but with so many other delicious options at the brewery, one is enough."
"Smooth and creamy, this is easy to drink if you know what you are getting into. Definatly not for those who just ""like"" beer."
"Pours an opaque, dark brown color with a tan frothy head that reduces rather quickly. Aroma is toasty malt and coffee with a touch of fleshy fruit. Flavor is of those See's coffee flavored candies with some roasty bitterness and smoke. Chewy and sticky. Really smooth and drinkable."
"Pours a deep black, with a thin tan head. Smell is of belgiam yeast, dark chocolate and deep roasted malt. Taste is a dark chocolate, burnt malt (very much like a good porter), with a hint of the sweet, distinct belgium yeast flavor. A very good beer, that I have had the pleasure of having twice now and would get again when available."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable stuff despite being my last beer of the day. Vinnie has a nice touch with these Belgian-style brews."
"Overall: This beer is great. I would drink it any day, and I would definately drink it if I was rejected."
"D: Great, I could drink a lot of these at 6% abv and they are very enjoyable. Obviously not as much flavor or punch as a RISs, but still a lot going on and an interesting beer (though I'm still not sure what beers to compare it to)"
"From my notes on recent trip, poured into a sampling glass, arrived with no head, pretty dark brown in color. Aroma is a bit odd, definitely some toasted malt in there, but can't pin down the odd funk to it. Taste is again kind of funky, the malts roasty, some chocolate... and perhaps smoked? Not what I expected out of a Belgian Dark, though not actually all that bad. Just, well, rejected:) Body is above average, good consistency and after I got used to it, it wasn't all half that bad. One is all I need though."
"Drinkability: Terrific aroma, subtle flavors with a nice, woody finish"
"Overall: Its a while since I had a dark brew from Russian River, but overall this one was not really to my palate to be honest. I made a point to try this one early on so I think I avoided the faded palate scenario. Not one of my favorites from Russian River, definitely unique, but I would give this one a whirl again if I get chance."
"Drinkability- Fairly odd tasting beer. Kinda like a swartzbier, except not a lager. Not as sweet in the malt as well. Just odd. Worth a try though."
" Hopefully some other soul can it describe better. All i can advise is to leave a style mindset at the door. It was pretty good, and although not as good as good as the top of the Russian River class, it was still a damn fine adult beverage. I myself will try my hardest to get back for another taste before it's gone and perhaps even get a growler next time."
"Unique and pleasing, this is definitely a good beer."
