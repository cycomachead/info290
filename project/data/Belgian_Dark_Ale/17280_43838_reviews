"330ml bottle. Wine glass. Amber color & chill haze appearance. Yellowish foam creates a close crown showing fairly good retention. Crystal malt, candy & toffee aromas. Sweet malts, toffee & chocolate hues on the flavor profile. Light body. Moderate carbonation. Smooth palate. Spices & ripe fruit in the middle. Dry spicy finish rounded by sweet no-cloying aftertaste. Refreshing & easy drinkable. Smooth from the beginning & well balanced beer."

"Overall I guess I am not much of a fan of gruut beers. This one had promise but feel flat on the body and finish."
"Medium bodied and rich enough to carry the sweetness without turning the beer into a sickly mess. My sweet tooth loved it (I even bought a bottle to bring home)."
"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Clear copper-amber pour with a half finger head that quickly fades with minimal lacing. The nose is somewhat subdued, but very unique, as expected. Very herbal and flowery with hints of honey, cinnamon, caramel and butterscotch. The taste follows suit with a similar unique herbal character. Hints of honey, butterscotch, caramel, nutmeg, and some other flavors that I just can't describe. I'm a hop head, but I'm not missing the hops at all here. The uniqueness makes up for it. Reminds me very much of a winter warmer or Christmas beer. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy and syrupy but really smooth and drinkable with just a touch of bitterness on the finish. I've visited the brewery in Ghent and this holds up to the draft version. I'll be in Ghent this weekend and will definitely be picking up more of this!"

"Overall: Far from the best of this style. It is seriously lacking in flavour - not a particular taste per-say but a boldness or strength that one normally finds in a Belgian beer."

"D: I prefer the amber ale over the blonde and bruin for drinkability. A little high in carbonation, but a pretty good beer."
"Good beer. Enjoyable."
"O; for beers made with spices i dont taste it in al the beers. gruut was not only to spice the beers but to conserve it to but the spices are in all the beers not in the taste."
"This brewery is definitely worth visiting if you're in Gent, but not necessarily worth taking some home."
"I did not like the fact that it gushed, but it is a pretty solid brew otherwise."
"D: Drinks easily enough to merit a good score. If other options are available, I would choose to move on to something else after having one of these on any given night, but wouldn't hesitate to pick up another bottle next week if the price was right. A decent brew, for sure."
"A very Odd Notion, this one, a Belgian amber, sweetish with apricot fruitiness, notes of burnt caramel and woody/herbal notes. Very complex with some off-putting from the herbal side, maintains a balance that keeps it from being poorly made, and it is quite good and interesting, but I wouldn't call this an American Amber by any means, Gruut is a category is it not? One of the few examples and not a bad one."
"Tastes sweet and of roasted malt with a mix of wheat, hops, sugar, spices, some fruits and herbs(??); nice warm complex flavors with the yeast and malt being the strongest tastes, and a medium body and carbonation. Overall a good beer, just not anything exceptional in the flavor department, especially for a Belgian product. It was quite drinkable and I enjoyed it, but I've come to expect a lot from Belgian products and this beer just seemed average...and average by global standards, not just Belgium."
"I will be buying more."
"Overall a descent beer, but not a great one. But certainly worth a try."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Just when I thought the perfect mouthfeel of a Belgian ale was locked up with Tripel Karmeliet, this beer dazzles with a sublime, gentle texture that lasts throughout the entire duration in the mouth. Absolute perfection, it further emphasizes the already impressive quality of the beer. A relatively elusive must-try for Belgian ale lovers."
"Until today, when I gave the label a close look and saw hops listed among the ingredients, I thought this ale was a gruit. If it wasn't for a modest hop bitterness, it would be. Belgian ambers rarely impress me as much as Belgian pales and darks. Gruut Belgian Amber Ale does nothing to change that."
"Gruut Belgian Amber Ale is a hazy, well, amber ale, with a thin, dense, light beige head that leaves incredible sheets of lacing. It smells very raisiny, sweet, with possibly some dark fruit. There's a note of black pepper in the nose. It's medium bodied, reasonably smooth and quite bubbly. The finish is a bit ragged. It tastes pretty mellow. It starts off fruity, a little sweet and a little tart-- then it becomes phenolic and alcoholic. It leaves the mouth hot. The bitterness is present but low-key. It's good, but it's nothing stand-out. It tastes stronger than it is; a bit much for a session ale."
"D: Starts strong appearance wise but only goes down hill from there. Lackluster aroma, moderate flavor and disappointing mouthful makes this a one try only. Don't waste your money on a sixpack."
"Nice amber color with a fine bubbled head that trails globs of lace. Yeasty smell with a solid caramel malt background. Taste is also very yeasty, some chalkyness. Heavy amount of carbonation on the toungue. Finishes yeasty. Overall an OK beer but it never really shows much flavor other than yeasty, but it never shows any fruityness that you would expect."
"Definitely don't be expecting a belgian if you buy this beer."
"D - A pretty tasty amber which was relatively easy to drink for a 6.6% ale. I give it a very good drinkability overall and it is simple which sometimes just hits the spot."
"Pours a three finger, pourous, spongey tan head. Not much stickage or retention, and no bubbling. Ok tarnished amber color. Toasted bread with a dash of cinnamon, cardomon, and nutmeg make up the spicey aroma. Toated sweet bread drizzled with a little caramel starts the taste off right. Then some chammomile and some fruit cake spices. The finish has a touch of tinny bandaids. Dry, malty, and spicey palate. But a little off on the finish and linger."
"This one has potential which I don't feel has been realised yet. Easy-drinking, and substantial ABV well-masked, but not too much to differentiate itself from others on the market."
"Blah. This beer is a mess. Aroma was very weak. Smelled like stale ginger ale. Pour was absolutely beautiful. Deep rich amber with a 2 finger off white head. Taste was stale caramel and a hint of roasted malt. Very thin and watery. Carbonation left the beer halfway through and turned into a flat amber ale."
"Pours a dark yellowish-brown/ brown copper color with a foamy off-white head. Musky aroma that is dominated by clove spiciness. Slight chocolate malt presence. Flavor is once again dominated by cloves. A little bit of licorice, chocolate malt. Very carbonated with a spicy roastiness up front followed by a sweet malty center and dry finish."
"Drinkability: Not offensive, but pretty average, truth be told. There are some decent flavors here, but a few notes that, while not ""off"" notes, aren't too hot. Alcohol is fine - 6.6% isn't a problem. But nonetheless, still just a fairly average beer."
"T + M + D: Fairly non-descript. toasty malts, sweetness... again, inoffensive. A medium body, sparkling carbonation, and fairly easy drinking. Rather straight forward."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a nice loose off-white head that left some nice lacing as it dissipated. The aroma is disappointing for a Belgian brew. It has a light lemony tea quality and that is about it. The taste is similar to the aroma. Tea like flavor with a hint of a burnt caramel malt, an light earthy hop bitterness and a touch of candi sugar. The feel is fairly light and crisp and very well carbonated; burns the tongue a bit. The brew finishes astringent and a touch bitter. Not really what I expected, a Belgian made brew that resembles an American style. Flavors are not bad but the carbonation is over the top."
"Drinkability- This would score higher without that yeasty weirdness, but this is still a solid and drinkable beer that I would drink another of if given the opportunity."
"Pours a clear brown with a thin cr√®me head. Nose is one-sided with mostly leafy caramelized sugars evident. Flavor is earthy and leafy with a noticed sweet tone. When I saw that it said Belgian Amber Ale on the label, I had low hopes, but this is ending up pretty decent really. There's a good enough balance of earthy tones and sweetness. Feel is fairly full on the carbonation and the liquid is well bodied. Overall this is an interesting brew. A Belgian Amber Ale? Sure. It definitely comes off as a hybrid of sorts with enough character to keep it interesting. I say it's worth a shot."
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours copper with a 1 cm off white head that is quickly diminishing. Aroma is sweet malt and yeast. Initial flavor is light and sweet, malty. The taste becomes more bland and has a very plain aftertaste. Moderate carbonation, light lacing, light body, and light on alcohol. Overall very boring and not worth the time or money."
"The drinkability is good, it is a slightly rich beer that would go very well with a burger and fries or a steak. I am glad I picked this up, and I think this is first time I added a beer that had not yet been reviewed before, nice."
