"M: It's full bodied. Not as creamy as I would have thought."

"I was hoping for a little more from this beer, not sure if it was just this batch but it seemed to lack concentration and intensity. While it's in a Belgian style, it doesn't have nearly the punch of a true Belgian."
"Served in a 10 oz snifter with little head. Nose is bourbon, vanilla, oak...and not much else. Taste is a nice mellow bourbon with the typical vanilla and oak, but that's about it. A little on the boring side but still, it is nice to see brewpubs making bourbon aged brews, and it hits the spot nicely."
"The taste is bourbon dominated, but that's about it. The base beer seems bland... and the barrel flavors are a bit muted. Not nearly the match of the nose. At times, this seems watery, but the carbonation is good. All of these combined make it very drinkable. A very nice offering."
"Drinkability: This beer is not as loud and extreme as the style and barrel aging would suggest. It is a very delciate take on the style making it quite drinkable."
"M/D - medium thick mouthfeel, but creamy and a little slick. Very drinkable. Not overly sweet at all. Highly recommended."
"Drinkabilty: definitely get again when I am in the mod for a flavorful beer."
"I have tried this before but never reviewed it. The beer pours a brown color with a tan head. The aroma is oak and bourbon, just what I look for in a bourbon-barrel aged beer. The flavor is vanilla, brown sugar, oak, bourbon and some roasted malts. Low carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"[EDIT: Tried again 1/11...bourbon-ness that I loved so much in the original is all but a ghost of its former self. For shame...review adjusted accordingly]"
"Poured a deep, dark orange/amber (almost brown) color wtih an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of strong woody/oakiness, earthy, roasty, with light chocolate, and a trace of bourbon. The earthy/woodiness definitely dominates the aromas. Tastes of vanilla, whisky (more than the aromas), caramel, lighter roast, and vanilla. Body a bit on the thinner side."
"Very thin body but the carbonation really picks this one up as it is very smooth and airy on the palate. Somewhat of a dry finish, very clean."
"I wonder if there are any beer flavored bourbons?"
"D - Good. Much better than the first time I had this. More complex flavor."
"Almost opaque black pour in a tulip on draft. Color of black licorice after you bite into it with shades of chalky dark brown to black. Smell isn't overly strong but is quite inviting and nice. Subtle deep roasty malt, & some bourbon as well. Taste is incredibly smooth. Rich licorice like roasty malt, and a nice hit of bourbon flavor without the boozy, hot feel. Better than the Okanogan schwarzbier itself, and the Barrel aging adds some nice complementing character to this beer. I'd recommend this, and I'm not a regularly a schwarzbier fan."
"This was an excellent beer!"
