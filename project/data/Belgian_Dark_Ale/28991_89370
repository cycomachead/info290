The balance and complexity are there, and I’m a sucker for the Belgian yeast and mouthfeel.  I’m not usually very keen on rye beers, but this one is tastefully done in a way that adds nuance without being gimmicky.","MaximalC","Dec 28, 2014"

3.64,-4.7,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,""Pernicious", eh? Well, how else would you describe a Belgian brown ale brewed with rye? In any case, it pours a mostly clear sunrise russet-amber topped by a finger of glowing off-cream foam. The nose comprises sweet and toasted toffee, light brown sugar, light rye bread, and a touch of Belgian yeast. The taste brings in more of the same, with more rye bread, some sourdough, some mandarin orange syrup, and a bit more brown sugar. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a solid brew, though the Belgian influence is hardly there.","TMoney2591","0"
