However I thought it was a tad sweet, I was expecting some sweetness from the caramel malts, but the balance between the bitter and sweet was rough. At first sip sweet hickory was blasted onto the middle of my palate, followed with a bitter chocolate towards the back of the palate. Overall a good brew, not one that I would buy again.","MOFALLINGLEAF","Beers"

APPEARANCE: dark amber color and translucent. reddish depth. large ivory head with average retention. some lacing is present. TASTE: notes similar to aromas. dilluted sweet malt background flavour. low bitterness. finishes semi-sweet. PALATE: medium-low body with average carbonation. OVERALL: a mild (aroma and flavour wise), belgian dubbel that lacks more malt derived complexity. a bit on the watery side.","titvs","Oct 18, 2014"

4,5.8,,,,,,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 3/28/2015. Pours fairly crystal clear reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, banana, clove, chocolate, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, plum, fig, banana, clove, chocolate, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, banana, clove, chocolate, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light nuttiness, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice dubbel style. All around great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 05, 2014"

2.48,-34.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.25,2.5,"Was excited to give this two-year-old Leffe a try! It poured a medium dark amber color with little to no head, but that may have been because I was pouring from a day-old growler and this doesn't seem to be a very carbonated beer in the first place. The nose is sweet, almost raisin-y, and has the tiniest hint of nuttiness...the previous reviewer who mentioned root beer was spot-on. The taste of the beer was surprisingly sweet, almost unappealingly so at first, and none of the nuttiness in the nose translated onto the palate. It had a perfectly fine but not exceptional mouthfeel. The finish was fast and slightly sour. I was bummed I wasn't enjoying it more as a sipping beer, and after some pondering decided to pair it with a few mild and sweet-ish cheeses (havarti, mild cheddar, and some of Sargento's New Zealander). That made a huge difference...the sweetness calmed down and more nuttiness and yeastiness popped out, and I even poured a second small glass. I think this is an ok beer, and I might seek it out if I was looking for something to serve with a cheese plate or other sweet/savory appetizers. Probably won't buy again, though.","TheMcCollums","Jul 27, 2014"

Poured at 40 degrees, beer was very pretty I must admit with a giant head. Mahogany color mmmI thought. But as soon as I smelled it I knew it was that same sour beer we hate. Don't understand it either My wife spent a year in Holland and loved this beer on tap. When she got back here to Va. we started buying it and first sip she took was yuk! And we have tried several times hoping it was just a bad or old beer. I don't know maybe the export product is not the same as the beer overseas. Don't matter I will never again waste money to try it anymore unless we find it on tap.","Minkybut","Dec 09, 2013"

3.92,3.7,4.25,4,3.75,4,4,"Very dark brown, just a shade lighter than black in the glass with a huge light khaki colored head that takes a while to subside. The smell is of wheat bread, dark caramel and belgian yeast in the form of banana and clove. The taste is similar to the smell with the yeast character in the forefront and the rest of the flavors bouncing around behind. The finish is dry but smooth as the carbonation level is low which makes this beer feel nice and thick in the mouth. Overall hop character is limited in terms of hop aroma, flavor and bitterness. Overall I'm a fan of brown ales and this is version of the belgian dark style is reminiscent of an english brown with more yeast character. Not quite as tasty as others of the style but still a good classic example.","fank2788","Mar 01, 2013"

This stuff pours a dark ruby-brown topped by two fingers of off-cream foam. The nose comprises graham cracker, Belgian yeast, light rye bread, and clove. The taste holds notes of mild cocoa, clove, light brown sugar, banana peel, light Belgian yeast, and light toasted biscuit. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slightly grainy feel. Overall, a solid, if somewhat underwhelming, Belgian dark. It won't blow you outta the water, but it'll do for a quick Belgian-y nip.","TMoney2591","Oct 21, 2012"

3.98,5.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a handsome fig color with a decent amount of khaki foam. The aroma is citric and slightly boozey, with perhaps a hint of Belgian spices. The flavor is pretty mild for a Belgian ale, but pleasant, with a gentle malt backbone that is equal parts roast and caramel. Some hop bitterness is present, but only enough to lend balance. As with the nose, whatever spices are present are modest. The bitterness lingers just a bit in the finish, but not excessively so. A fairly ample, but thin, layer of lacing envelopes the glass as the beer recedes, lending a handsome appearance. The malt character begins to assert itself more as the beer warms, and this is hardly a bad thing, as I felt the mouthfeel was just a tad thin initially. Overall, this is a very balanced and well-rounded Belgian dark ale from Leffe (I'd go so far as to say I prefer it to their blonde, which I also enjoy).","MaximalC","Aug 15, 2012"

Pours a brownish-mahogany hue with a dense, three-inch, tan-colored head that eventually settles into a frothy mass - textured clumps of lacing are exposed during the tasting. Nose is somewhat subdued - nutmeg/allspice, medium-toasted malts and a suggestion of yeast. Taste follows nose; however, malty quality is a bit more assertive in the flavor profile. There is also just the merest hint of toffee. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an assertive carbonation. Overall, a pretty good beer. Spiciness is definitely reminiscent of the Blonde; however, the malt profile definitely makes it distinctive in its own right.","Jwale73","Beers"

The taste is a little disappointing in the sense that I was expected a bit of roasted flavours to come through over the belgian yeast esters that are dominating.

Smooth and creamy, the tongue is mostly showered with sweetness ranging from standard sweet malts (cocoa, caramel, toffee, oatmeal) and balanced with some bread malts, fruit tastes like orange and that Belgian yeast strain I always pick up in Belgians.

Immediately I ordered this beer that I should have long tried... (having already tried Westys long ago) The Leffe brune did not fall below my expections at all. I did not reveal it that day though... instead I bought a bottle to go as it was not sold at the shops and supermarkets locally. This Leffe pours into my tall Leffe chalice with a nice thick 2 finger plus head that was generally creamy but slightly more bubbly than the other Leffes. When I poured it at Ice Cold Beer for Rex and myself it did not yield much head but this time it did and I have no idea why. The color of the pour was a dark ruby brown. The smell was caramel, dark fruits, spices, yeast and some malts too. The taste starts off spicey, malty with light brown sugar sweetness; the fruitiness kicks in shortly after not exactly an outright strong fruitiness but it instead blended with the malts and sugars to become a malty sweet fruitiness with some dates and raisins. The fruits were not the pronounced and it was rather light but the malts go strong and reveal the light fruitiness beneath it. The finish was slightly yeasty and slightly bitter dry as well. The after taste was malty with a hint of dark fruits; slowly raisins surface in the after taste. Sweet malty, slightly fruity aromas were detected on the nose. A final note to the taste is the ressemblance to the Leffe Blond in a sense that I can taste the typical Leffe taste (mainly from the malts and spices); very nice. The taste improves as the beer warms; so do not drink it too quickly if you have it out from the fridge! The fruitiness and brown sugar sweetness seem to show up a little more and the taste seems more mellow as it warms. The mouthfeel was probably medium bodied but with a fairly low amount of carbonation but a slightly creamy yet slightly stinging feel in the throat which was pretty good per se; nonetheless, it was generally a smooth drinking beer. Very nice indeed.","basica","Sep 08, 2007"

Tastes of caramel, cane or yellow sugar, I found the sweetness nicely held in check by a nicely balanced bitterness. A rich and full mouthfeel. Lacing got more impressive as the glass emptied. Warming brought out molasses, increasing sweetness yet still bitter; that aftertaste got more pronounced with air. Silky smooth, delightful mouthfeel, very rich and filling. I quite enjoyed this beer and found it more interesting than the Leffe Blonde; my only criticism might be that it's a bit too rich at times, but that's a minor distraction. My preferred Leffe right now.","ThatWineGuy","Jul 22, 2007"

I enjoyed the taste but wasn't blown away by it, as I have been with similar style beers. There was just a little carbonation and the beer had a smooth presentation, making it easy to drink.

It's low carbonation appeals to me, as I'm not fan of champagne like brews. Every place we stopped to refuel in Belgium had this, either on tap or bottled, and it was tough to pass it up. For a brown it's rather light bodied. Couple that with it's low carbonation and, to me, it's an any time of the year beer. It's modest price won't break your wallet to have a case of this on hand. And, it pairs well with a hamburger, a steak or just a simple cheese and fruit plate. I'd have to say a hop head would pass on this one since there's no hop taste at all.

4.31,14,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Never had a Flanders Red, and I don't know anything about the style. But this beer does intrigue me. Pours a dark black, but hold it to a light source and it glows blood red, making me feel like a vampire, haha! Head is billowy and off white, and consistent with moderate carbonation. Smells fresh and wheaty. Taste is very good, hoppy, with a ""sting"" to it that stays with the aftertaste, yet sweet all the time. Very fun beer!","RocketWidget","Oct 13, 2003"
4.05,7.1,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a medium to dark brown color with a beige head that dies rather quickly. Notes of plum and other dark fruits as well as a yeastiness that smells somewhat like wet cardboard (sounds bad; but not, it's in the mix). Rich maltiness intertwined with a delicate hop balance makes this beer a highly drinkable treat. The 6.5% ABV helps in that department as well. This Belgian isn't too rich, one might say it's a bit watery, but it has a really nice flavor.","crookedhalo","Sep 29, 2003"
4.15,9.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Tasted like a fine Belgian without so much body or complexity. A nice balance of some European hops and plenty of sweet malt. I loved the mouthfeel as it is just so satisfying, finishing quite dry without much bitterness at all. Goes down quite well with a variety of foods. This is a winner.","steelreign","Sep 22, 2003"
3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a deep brown with red highlights with a nice somwhat creamy very sticky head,aroma is very sweet and brandyish.A pretty comples ale first I got some rich port like flavors with some candied sugar notes with a light smokiness that lingers into the finish.A nice beer to savor after a meal like I did,very well made and drinkable for the style in my mind.","oberon","Beers"
3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pretty good beer in my opinion. Poured a reddish brown with a frothy off-white head. Plenty of lacing. Smell was roasty and a tad astringent with some sugary sweetness and a grainy edge to it. Taste was quite refreshing with a corny almost Wit taste wo it, but it stayed much deeper with a creamy, syrup ladden center and a malty nutty ending. Mouthfeel was somewhat carbonated with a good amount of spritzy bubbling. Overall a decent beer.","GreatPondBrewer","0"
3.83,1.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Served at the Eulogy bar. This beer poured a dark brown, nearly opaque color. Tints of ruby shown through when held up to the light. The head thinned out quickly and became just a film. Served in its proper chalice glass, the beer gave off the subtle aroma of roasted grains and fermented fruits. Taste was textured with a slight candy sweetness and some sour malts. An enjoyable and easy drinking Belgium ale that can stand on its own.","pezoids","Jul 19, 2003"
4.3,13.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Tastes of sweet malt, fruit, dough, dark candy, toffee, and some phenol spices to balance out the flavor. Very even and clean. A bit sweet for some, but another great session beer by Leffe. If all Amercian mass produced beers were of this quality many BAs would sing a different tune. A good beer by any standards.","Loki","Jun 28, 2003"
3.26,-13.8,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Lovely reddish-brown hue under a red-tinged tan head that stuck around a little while but left some very, very nice lace well down the glass. The nose is fruity sweet, as so many French and Belgian beers have. The mouth is crisp and tingly, with the same fruity sweetness. The taste also starts out there, particularly as the brew warmed in the glass. There was a definitely hoppy bitterness in the finish, though, that left a quite good impression. I enjoyed this brew, but that citrus fruit sweet-sourness in the nose and initial taste have always kept me away from francophone beers.","Globetrotter","Jun 28, 2003"
3.98,5.3,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"11.2 oz glass, on draught. Deep brown color with a thick, off-white head. Not much in the nose but some sweet malt and mild chocolate. Nutty flavors seem to be the easiest to trace. Very malty with some nice chocolate undertones...very dry finish with a coating feeling in the mouth, nice flavorful aftertaste. Nothing too special, but it is an enjoyable and highly drinkable Belgian ale.","IrishRedRock","Apr 26, 2003"
4.15,9.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Appears a deep amber brown with a moccha tan colored two fingered sized head while leaving a nice even web of lacing. Aroma has mild brown sugar hints coated with darker roasted specialty malts, and as it warms forms pleasant fruit tones notably tart apple notes. Taste is a very balanced flavor consisting of a nice tartness that blends and contrasts very well with the harsh dark roasts coating the palate with trickling sweet fruit tones. Mouthfeel is a lighter creamy body very nice going down nothing bad to say about it. Drinkability is amazingly easy to drink this beer, and enjoyable classic session beer.","WVbeergeek","Apr 15, 2003"
3.66,-3.2,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,"Lovely head, not too dark. The beer is very dark brown. opaque. It smells a little medicinal and sweet. A little like the sugared roasted nuts they sell on the street. Tastes nutty, too. Hints of cocoa. Not too sweet, but pretty thick-felling in the mouth, which hurts the drinkability of an otherwise exceptional beer.","dwarbi","Mar 25, 2003"
4.72,24.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,4,"I had this beer on tap in a pub in Montreal, I was extremely pleasantly suprised, as I had not heard of the beer before, and simply chose it on a whim. A rich, deep brown color with some hints of deep red. Excellent smell, with some slight fruity scents. The beer felt great in my mouth and went down extremely easily. I had this beer along side a beef dish, and it was an excellent compliment. An outstanding beer, although one that would likely be difficult to drink in large quantities.","bigjohn","Mar 25, 2003"
4.65,23,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Small head, as to be exspected with this kind of brew, the nose and apperance both well above average with the rich malt hues giving this a sort of Newcastle+russet color. Taste was unlike any beer I've had previously, being somewhat of a novice... A VERY sweet, nutty flavor. Some raison notes. Recomended to anyone who likes the artisinal or nut brow styles as it is sure to please. A treat.","EmoBeerGuy","Jan 31, 2003"
4.7,24.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"This beer was malt-tastic! A very sweet, malty brown ale... didn't really come across as sour to me. Dark brown in color with a medium-sized head. A very drinkable beer, but I found it so sweet and delicious that I was able to force myself to take very small sips and make it last. I'm tempted to say there were hints of raisins in this guy, but I really don't know. My taste buds simply said ""goooood.""","Marty","Jan 20, 2003"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a very nice brew that I prefer to the Leffe Blonde. Brown-red color. Nice solid head, kind of sweet taste accompanied with chocolate and dark bread. Imho this brew should be enjoyed in small sips. Overall I like this ale, I will definetly buy it again!","Rocko","Dec 22, 2002"
4.5,19,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a brown colour topped a tanned head that settles down rather easily. How could u not love this beer? Sweet fruity taste and aroma. Goes down quite easily and ABV is just fine so as to drink and not get drunk (Not more than 15 bottles though heh). One of the best dark Ales i've had so far. Abbaye de Leffe has done it again. Great brew!!!","ipogios","Nov 17, 2002"
3.53,-6.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Opaque, darkest brown possible with a big bottle-conditioned head (3/4 of an inch and climbing) that's dark tan in color. Laces in large mats made up of small bubbles. A little nutmeg and some red wine in the aroma. Light and airy malts, some sense of the water/wine mix you get at a Catholic Mass and a decided impression of apple stems (yes, the stems). Mid mouth, there starts to be a toffee sense along with some phenolic spices. As with Leffe Blond, too much sweetness going on. The astrigent undertone works pretty well to balance the finish, with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Pretty good...thanks to Rachel M. and Ethan L. for bringing a bottle back from Europe, and Liza P. and Ken K. for letting me drink it.","ADR","Aug 10, 2002"
3.72,-1.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The color on the pour a deep garnet with a monstrous head and the consistency frothy and light as it slowly dematerializes the lace forms a fine clinging sheet the color beige. Nose is malt, raisins, with hints of bread dough, quite nice actually. Overly sweet start, top is lean; the finish has a potent acidic bite, the hops sparse, and the finish malt dry and long lasting.","Gusler","Jul 07, 2002"
4.2,11.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a brownish color with a slight reddish tone in therethe head is a nice brownish/tan color, very nice lace. On the nose slightly spicy and hints of dark fruit. On the palate the flavors were slightly spicy, hints of chocolate, slight bitter/tartness, sweet, hint of apple, and perhaps pears. Smooth mouthfeel...very enjoyable brewhad this at Monks Café yesterday before I went to the warp tour in Camden, NJ.","WilliamPhilaPa","Jun 26, 2002"

Complex flavor of chocolate, yeast, nuts(hazel), and spice.  Wonderful smooth mouth.  Slides through and coats the palate.  Aftertaste is quite tart with hints of fruit (prune).  Very drinkable for the abv and as a brown.  A great tap beer to start a meal.  As it warms in the goblet, it becomes even more silky smooth.","frank4sail","Oct 25, 2001"
