"I love beer, especially great beer but even with all that, I can pretty much drink anything. I left 3/4 of this pint on the table. Just a shear chore trying to get to the bottom of this glass. I threw in the towel."

"Overall: Great beer when paired with steaks & frites. Definitely not what I would have expected from a dark beer."

"O: Awesome brew. Easily drinkable and very enjoyable"
"O: The taste gets better the more you drink. 4"
"Overall I'm not quite sure I would put this beer in the Belgian Dark Ale style as it seems more like a porter to me with some slight Belgian Influences. Certainly Brewer's Art most drinkable beer and one that is easily sessionable. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Belgian Porter? Porter? Belgian Dark? An odd hybrid that doesn't seem extremely discernible in some ways. But it's lighter, which would probably fit the bill for some people as sessionable, since it's also pretty dark. I could drink more than one, but I'd prefer more flavor overall."
"D - One of the most sessionable beers at Brewer's. A delicious beer whether one decides to classify it as a porter or a Belgian dark (although, I think it is the latter)"
"D: I had one glass before bolting away for dinner (the place was crowded) but I would have enjoyed another glass or two."
"There is no way in hell this is a Belgian beer. It's a standard (though awful) American stout."
"Notes from: 9/25/04"
"d: easy"
"Pours a dark brown with a crème head. Flavor is robustly sweet. Smooth bitter tone. Feel has a full carbonation and a good liquid body. Thick, but still easy to drink and refreshing even though it's heavier. Out of all the beers I had, this was my favorite I have to say. Good enough to go back for seconds."
"Drinkability: Very unusual, but nicely flavored; I don't know why everybody here is getting hung up with whether this is a Belgian Dark or a porter and allowing it to impact their ratings; the brewpub is not claiming that it is a particular style as far as I can see, and many of Brewer's Art beers transcend style guidelines and that's OK with me"
"The beer pours a hazy dark brown color with decent head retention and very good lacing. I have to say I get almost nothing on the nose just some light sweet malt. On the palate one gets moderate sweetness, with a noticeable cola/rootbeer flavor. The beer in this format is very soft and plush on the palate, with the relatively low abv. very well disguised. Ultimately, this beer is quite drinkable and delicious. Nice effort from BA."
"Easy to drink and quite tasty. Good session ale."
"D - Quaffable with the flavor of a black ale. Not too sweet, light in body and sessionable at 5%. Good Flavor, but just not great as black ales go."
"i can't decide how to treat this brew now that i see it's a belgian. it seems difficult to miss the mark for belgian styles (dark, pale, strong dark, strong pale), but i wasn't able to tell this guy was fermented with a belgian yeast strain"
"D - Alright, it gets to be a bit over bearing after a while due to the potent flavor. Of what I have tasted, this is my favorite Brewer's Art beer for sure."
"Drinkability: Interesting beer that seems to straddle style differences. It went very well with the chocolate cherry bread pudding we ordered for dessert. Think of it as a session porter."
"For a belgian dark ale this is dark more a porter or stout but even then the belgian name falls short the yeast they used really fails to produce those typical belgian flavors, maybe it is the roasted aspect of the beer but even that is very bening and this is really more of a porter-esque thing. Anyway it is dark a hell smells clean and a bit roasty. The taste is a touch yeast and porterish, nothing special here, but it still makes for a good drink."
"Had this on tap at the Brewer's Art. Served in a pint glass, this is a dark opaque brown with a good two fingers of coffe colored head, good retention, and excellent lacing. Nose is very faint, a light roast malt and bitter chocolate. Taste is a nice roasty malt with flavors of coffee, vanilla, bitter chocolate, and a slight bitter hop aftertaste. Medium bodied, creamy, with a very fine carbonation level. This is a really great tasting dark ale, almost like a porter, and I'm defintely going to start drinking more of this."
"If they only bottled their fine creations, I could make them a daily session beer. For now on, they have to stay as a $1.75 happy hour favorite. Unfortunately, the dark color will scare off most of the proletarian folks in this town. Saw a few previous comments about this being a stout. Im fairly sure that the style in general is quite different depending on the characteristics of the individual breweries."
"Mildly roasted and chocolatey nose with some Earl Grey. Nice chocolatey flavors with a hint of roasted (black patent?) malt -- a legitmate coffee flavor emerges from that. A real easy drinker that's medium bodied with just enough hops to lend balance. Herbal and plant-like, they're just enough. A good effort at a dark session beer, though really, this hardly strikes me as remotely Belgian."
"My only complaint is that the price is at least 10% to 15% too high for a session beer, as it is priced identical to their triple and double."
