"Disappointing beer. I thought it looked and smelled nice, but the flavor is decidedly average. Maybe the worst I've had from Brewery Vivant, but this is at worst uninteresting and drinkable. Worth a look, most especially if you're looking to try out a Belgian beer that isn't IN YOUR FACE."

"Didn't really care for it."

"Disappointed in this one.  Looks great but but is missing any characteristic that would make you want to drink it again.  Not bad, not a drain pour, just average."

"If you feel inclinated to try a Belgian beer, but are looking to avoid a banana flavored gumball, consider yourself Kane and join forces with the Undertaker. Much darker than typical Belgians, and easy to track down in those great Brewery Vivant cans. -Joe"
"Tasted similar to a sour?"

"Very good brew, let the haters hate."

"I must admit, this brew really took me by surprise, and I’m not quite sure what to make of it.  You’d never know it to look at it, but the taste could almost pass for a fruit beer (or a smoked fruit beer, if such a thing exists).  Fortify the mouthfeel and add some roasted, maltier flavors, and Brewery Vivant might really have something special here.  As is, this is a unique and intriguing beer that comes off a little too juicy for my tastes."
"From the first sip of this beer the trademark Brewery Vivant sour tang (presumably from the yeast used) becomes apparent. This is a well made Belgian dark ale. Looks almost like a porter and provides a complex palate."

"Agree with last reviewer.  Not sure where the negative reviews come from.  Very solid brew and I dare say a ""sessionable"" strong ale which is clearly unusual"

"Delicious and as dark as root beer. Loved it. Recommended by a close friend as his personal favorite beer, I decided to try it despite the lackluster reviews here and I don't know where these folks are coming from. It's a good strong flavor, zero bitterness. As dark as night. I had one can in a mixed-sixer but I'll be picking it up in quantity soon and sharing a few cans with some beer-loving coworkers as well."

"Decent taste though on the lighter side. ""Winey"" quality to it."
""
"This is a decent beer. I like the chocolate and coffee flavors. The almost burnt malt flavor on the finish detracts from a great front end on this beer."

"Just not very flavorful. The lack of head and lacing detracts from the enjoyment as well. Overall, not something I’ll be drinking again."

"Needless to say, I won't be buying this again. Too bad, I normally love dark Belgians. And I'm going to be wary of this brewery, too -- this was my first taste of anything they've produced."

"16 ounce can into tulip glass; no canning date, but is a recent release. Pours clear nearly pitch black color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a lacing cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, prune, banana, chocolate, roasted malt, dark bread, light coffee, clove, light bubblegum, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, prune, banana, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, dark bread, light coffee, light bubblegum, clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, banana, chocolate, cocoa, roast, dark bread, light coffee, clove, light bubblegum, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/roasted malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, lightly slick, and fairly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian dark ale. All around good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"As I finished this off I made the comment that this is almost a lambic."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and I thought it was a good and unique version of a Belgian Dark Ale, it had all the Belgian yeast flavors I would expect from the style, but In this beer I found the malt profile to be more roastier and robust than most in the style and I think that really represents the American influence this beer has, it's kind of like the best of both worlds. This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth, a little crisp, fairly dry on the finish, not filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I think a couple of these would be a good amount for me and I think this would be a great fall time beer. What I like the most about this beer was the balance, both the aroma and taste were balanced really well and neither the malts or the yeast were too overpowering. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I would want to change, it's great just the way it is. I would buy this beer again and I could see keeping some in the fridge during the fall since I think it would make a fine Bonfire beer. I would recommend this beer, and it might make for a good and easy drinking introduction to the style. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it was exactly how I remember it being like on tap at Brewery Vivant, so my score doesn't change at all. This isn't my favorite Brewery Vivant beer, but it is one of the better Belgian Dark Ales I've had so far. It's nice to have a beer like this available in pint cans and I could for sure see myself taking some on a camping trip. Good job guys, this one doesn't disappoint in the slightest, keep up the great and unique work."
"Overall: a very tasty and balanced belgian dark. good juicy dark fruit character and lots of good yeast qualities. a step up from solitude in my opinion. definitely a good step for Vivant."
