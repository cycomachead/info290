"O: Didn’t like the aroma at all, but was a big fan of the taste. Overall, worth a try, but not something I will likely go back to next year. 4"
"I was hoping for a bit more influence from the yeast, which makes me pay so much attention to all things Belgian. I enjoyed it enough to leave the door open to other Brasserie de Cazeau beers."

"Very nice mouthfeel. First bottle was off and flavor profile was very flat. Second was very nice on its own. Decent balance and very malty. Nose of chocolate and mild spice. Some esters - not overpowering. Recommend serving temperature above 43 degrees. Dark amber color."

"O: I'm not really sure why this one gets such high ratings. The nose is very bland and the taste is oddly out of whack for the style. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but this ale is doing nothing for me. Still, it's drinkable. I'll give it that."
"Overall, I found this to be a very impressive offering. It has been cellar-ed for a few months and could hold up much longer. Definitely my favorite from Cazeau so far."
"D - This beer has all of the elements that one needs in a dark Belgian ale, but somehow it just doesn't quite come together the way it should. It has a spicy character to the yeast profile that goes a bit over the top and fails to merge with the dark sugar and subtle fruit."

"Pours a deep amber to brown-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, candy sugar and spice, especially cinnamon. In the taste, licorice with a mellow spiciness, but cinnamon stands out. A spice like bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cinnamon and candy sugar like aftertaste. The licorice was a sleeper, nice, but just above average."
"O: Looks and feels fantastic. Smells and tastes good too. I liked this better than the River Horse Belgian Freeze."
"O: Wow – picked this beer up at half price, but would have paid full price. Excellent dark Belgium beer. Very well balanced brew and easily drinkable."
"Since this review I have seen and had this beer again on tap at Teresa's, Wayne, PA (Jan. '12)."
"D/M: Crisp and refreshing considering the weight of the beer. And very bubbly very drinkable considering the alcohol content."
"330 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgård, Denmark. ABV is 8.2%. Very dark brown colour, moderate cream-coloured head, nice lacing. Strong sweetish and ""perfumed"" aroma, notes of flowers (lilies?) and dark dried fruits, also notes of caramel and brown kandi sugar. The flavour is sweet and malty, notes of caramel and brown kandi sugar again, also spicy notes, hints of anise, tolerable hops in the finish. Quite enjoyable."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a dark reddish brown color with a large flufy slightly tan head that slowly settles. Head leaves nice lace on the glass as it settles down. Caramel, dark fruit, and very slight spice fill out the nose on this. Medium mouthfeel. Raisin is what comes to mind at first when I take my first drink followed by other dark fruit, some chocolate, spice, and some hop bitterness. Ends with some dryness. Not so sure I woul call this a Saison as it is classified as it doesn't really fit that description."
"Drinkability: another slow sipping Belgian Christmas beer that fits the season. Not overly exciting but decent."
"D: The beer is quite drinkable and goes down easily because the alcohol is well hidden and none of the flavors are overpowering."
"jd"
"This is a good kerst ale, defined by nice charred malt flavors (it has Pilsener, Munich, cara 60 and 150 and black malts), not too sweet, moderate in body, a bit hoppy (it has Tomahwk, Styrian Goldings and Cascade hops), and nicely spiced. It is very well balanced. Last year's Tournay de Noel has become the Tournay Noire Belgian Stout which is now made year round; the 2010 version is a new Tournay de Noel recipe. The alcohol level is moderate, and together with the interesting flavors, it is a very drinkable kerst ale."
"D: Nice beer all around, very French feel to this beer at times, the yeast is mild here, good taste, an enjoyable effort."
"first noel i've had in the last few weeks that has a picture perfect belgian head. nice tight small bubble of a mocha head on a cloudy mahogany brown. at first i noticed dark fruit... particularly black currant and black berry. as it expands the nose is belgian sugar and lemon zest with hints of malt characteristics which definitely come out in the palate. a nice chocolate with a quality black berry that is quite prominent. a tad toasty and a tad spiced make it a very well balanced brew. completely sustainable abv. not boozy. a hint of hay munich malt bitter."
"Drinkability is pretty nice - but a touch too bitter to get a higher rating. If you have someone who digs gin & tonics, you might shock them with how much they enjoy this 'dark beer'."
"D: A solidly made, drinkable beer."
"D: Great to sip; nice, homely and warming beer."
"Have had better, but this is still a very tasty, very easy to appreciate Belgian brune/dark ale. Nice..."
"D: a nice Christmas beer, worth seeking out. I'd like to find it in a larger bottle and store it for a year or two."
"Overall it's really quite nice! It's rich and flavorful, but not overdone. Absolutely worth trying!"
"Pours quite dark. Thinner tannish head. Pretty thick flavor profile with a good bit of spices in there as well. Robust and hearty. A bit heavy for July (Christmas beers in July!), so not so much a session ale, but it's nice enough I suppose. Probably better to sample in colder months."
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep burgundy color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention and super good lacing. Aroma of sweet Belgian malt with some dry and grainy ester. Taste is a mix between some spice cake with notes of unrefined grainy malt and a dry malt base. A bit more sweetness would have benefited this beer IMHO. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol."
