"I've only drunk a few dark Belgians. This is one of my favorite American Belgian beers outside of Russian River and Great Divide. Just enough raisin."
""
"Overall:  it is the rare Belgian dark ale/dubbel/amber that grabs me, and alas this beer is not among them.  Not a bad beer at all for the style, but not really to my taste."

"O: Good"
"I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't go out of my way for it again."
"D- At this ABV, it is dangerously drinkable. So smooth and good. I could start and finish my night with something like. Thanks Black Raven and can't wait to try the bourbon LPM."
"Overall a solid beer and i would get this again, but i would try a different style of glass just to check it out"
"The body is solid and full without being heavy. The only reason drinkability suffers is due to the strength making it tricky to have more than a couple. I think this beer will develop a nice smoothness with a little time. Worth seeking out."
