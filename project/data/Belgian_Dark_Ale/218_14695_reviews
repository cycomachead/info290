"Easy drinkable with hints of chocolate (Very far away in the taste). A totally different beer on tap!"
"O: This is a solid Belgian dark ale that could be more than it is. If it were better balanced, this beer would be a winner."
""
""
"The sour cherry flavour is really the hero here, balancing the palate as well as giving good texture to the flavour profile. Good beer, good for drinking during the colder months."
"O; disiponting beer from the koninck little taste, its to sweet and the spices dont come out in the beer. the longer it stays in your glass more tastes a gone."
"D: Not a bad Belgian Dark, but not exceptional either. Probably wouldn't rush out to get it again."
"Pours a clear light red, brown color body. Crreamy white head, diminishing. Spicy sweet malty aroma. Holiday spice aroma. Spicy sweet taste, sweet spices, maybe. Nutmeg or somethning, holiday spices. Nice taste, nutty. Very holiday like. Somewhat creamy body. Letting it warm up a bit."
"D - This is a good Belgian. Good balance of malty sweetness and spice."
"D: An easy drinking Belgian Dark for the winter time, post Christmas I guess now. De Koninck always makes very drinkable ales out of Antwerp and this one is no different. Glad I got to try another one, since the only beer I've ever seen from this brewery is the common Pale."
"Despite the unusual flavors that come through it is very drinkable and light in the mouth."
"The mouth was a little winey with a whiskey like feel but without the heavy alcohol sting. It's a very nice sipping beer, not that heavy on the spice for a winter brew."
"It pours a nice amber color and the aroma is definitely sweet, like one would expect from a candy factory. The initial taste has flavors of fruits such as cherries, pears and maybe even some raisins. Finishes with a lingering aftertaste of spices but not overwhelmingly so. The carbonation is a bit thin so one tends to drink it a bit faster than most Belgians but overall has favorable drinkability."
"D- This beer is quite drinkable... but the fusel alcohols are a bug turn-off, and make me fear an oncoming hangover!"
"D- nothing offensive here, but nothing great either. pretty bland and weak. i doubt ill ever give this one another chance."
"For now I'll stick to the ""Blond Koninck", though."
"Drinkability - an enjoyable Belgian beer. Not a stand out, but pretty good."
"A nice drinking Belgian. Some spice yeasty malty aroma and that's in the taste, along with sugar. Cellared for a year or so. Very much sweet dessert, went fast. Whitish body with good head. Above average mouthfeel from creamy caramel. Some cinammon."
"Very refreshing."
"I expected a lot more from this beer, coming from the belgian world. It's much lighter looking and tasting than you would expect for this style. It gives you the belgian yeast flavors, but not much malt to back it up. I suppose the relatively low abv is the problem as a Belgian Dark should have more complexity, not bad just a slight bit better than an average american brewer would make this. Pass. Although I'm really intrigued by lower alcohol beers, this one is a disappointment."
"Man, a lot of spice in this ale! Fruity, sweet and spicy pretty much sums it up."
"This beer is pretty horrible. It doesn't stay with you, which is its one redeeming feature, but it's not pleasant on the palate. I guess I didn't choke it down, but wasn't nice. I will be avoiding this one in the future."
"Pours a dark ruby red color with small foamy pinkish, off-white head. Sour aroma of fsweet frui, cough syrup and alcohol. Dissapoining cough syrup taste mixed with sweet cherry flavor and strong alcohol presence. Gross!"
"Overall: Dissapointed to say the least. I thought a Christmas Ale by a belgian style brewery would be a sure fire hit. Indeed I was wrong. Good thing I split this with a friend."
"best before 06 09 08 ... looks like diet coke ... pours with a low head ...""ya, whatever mother fucker"" ... slightly fizzy on the tongue ... dusty, old golden syrup, calorie free chocolate flavours ... disappointing to say the least... not worth the anticipation or money, so many better belgians out there..."
"-Very smooth, very drinkable."
"I opened a 750ml bottle and don't really want to finish more than then first glass."
"Very solid beer from De Koninck."
"Pours a clean copper color, with hints of orange, and an off white head. In the aroma, malty, with corriander and nutmeg. In the taste, malty, semi-sweet and small hints of Christmas spices. A smooth, small bitter mouthfeel, with a dry and spicy aftertaste. Nothing fantastic, but a nice mellow Chistmasy beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly thin (perhaps due to oxidation), and caramel sweet."
"Overall - A decent brew... nothing groundbreaking but worth a try..."
"Taste is strong malty with a nice caramel maltiness that is a little roasted. The malt is the key player in this beer. Hops are almost absent. The beer has a great drinkability and although this beer has 6,5% it does not show. Indeed a winter version of the regular Koninck"
"Presentation: Packaged in a 750 ml Belgian bomber with a cork and cage closure, served in a 250 ml De Koninck chalice."
"OK, a bit sweet for my taste. Very firmly within Winter Warmer style parameters. Hops seemed a bit ""bigger"" than you would expect from a Belgian, but that was fine by me."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable for a winter beer."
"Drinkability is very average. just not very appealing at the end of the day. Too much funky sweetness with nothing to balance it out. Saw dust kind of bittering is bland and adds no redeeming quality to the brew."
"This beer poured a slightly hazy, garnet color with creamy, light brown foam that was slow to settle and clung to the glass in spots. The smell was malty with a touch of vinous Munich maltiness. The taste was nicely malty with a light sweetness and fruitiness as well as a bit of vinousness. The mild hoppiness came through in the finish. The mouthfeel was very smooth with medium-full body and good carbonation (crisp up front). Overall a very nice beer, and very drinkable around town in Antwerp."
"Mouthfeel- A tit tart but not bad. Almost sessionable if the tartness was a little less. But pretty smooth going down with a little grittiness."
"As an aside, it paired well with aged cheddar and French brie."
"It's not that this beer is difficult to drink, but I don't find any reasons to want to drink it. Pretty dissappointing bottle."
"Pours out a gorgeous copper ruby cherry oak hue, lots of carbonation, and the best head retention I've seen from De Koninck yet. The head rests at a thick creamy off-white bubbly cap and remains that way. A sticky wall of lacing. Sweet toffee malt, cherries, and rum soaked dates and raisins on the nose. Plums and a buttery profile catch my attention shortly after as well. The flavour can't live up to that aroma though, and falls apart quickly. Light buttery toffee malt up front, almost bitter preserved fruits in the middle, with practically an anticlimactic finish. The flavour is subdued and watered down, regardless of what it is aiming for. A buttery coating on the lips for the finish however. Disappointing. The mouthfeel is a bit fuller to what I've become accustomed to from De Koninck's line thus far, fuller and creamier, but still light in its way. The visuals, smells and texture of this beer are very fine, but the flavour is bland bland bland in comparison, cannot maintain the rest of the glory that this ale wishes to tout. It starts off well, but can't keep it up. I'd pass on this one next time. I enjoy a good looking beer, but if the flavour can't follow that up, then there's no point in the end."
"Best by 10/12/04, so I'm over a year late. The color is a hazy, dark cherry red with a large, light brown head. Thick chunks of sediment float around in the beer. Aroma has a vague spice smell atop of dark malts and alcohol. Taste has a dark earthy malt flavor joined by a sweet, sugary Belgian flavor. The taste also has a bit of dark fruit and cola flavors. A touch of alcohol is in the mix throughout. Towards the finish a ribbon of spice pops in. Good stuff here, I wish everything this far past it's ""best by"" date were this good. Overall malt flavor could have been stronger, but this was enjoyably subtle."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A bit thin, low carbonation which doesn't add much excitement to the experience. At 6.5%, it's not quite the session brew although it goes down super-easy for a Belgian Strong Dark."
"D - This is a decent, well rounded belgian dark ale that unfortunately doesn't deliver the goods to garner greater scores."
"Notes: Body is a little on the thin side. A little too sweet. Strong carbonation affects the drinkability. It's a fairly good beer, but I've had better belgians."
"For the style, this seemed lighter and less complex than most."
"The beer pours deep amber to almost brown color with a modest light tan head that is semi-creamy in texture and the lace a surrounding sheet upon the glass. Nose has a plum like aroma backed up by sweet malt, fresh and clean to the sense, start is sweet with a nice grain profile. Finish is stern in acidity and the hops pleasantly spicy in their bite, quite dry and the aftertaste long lasting, a fine drinking beer, went great with the food."
"I had no problem finishing this and would consider getting another. Not a winter warmer by any means, but a nice spiced slightly sweeter beer."
"My first review! Well, I looked on my beer rack and tried to pick out the beer with the worst looking label design just to get it out of the way to replace it with a better one. What I found was a perfect middle of the road beer. Poured it into a large chalice and let it rest for about 10 minutes before drinking. Huge head that took a while to disipate, with a bit of lace. Smelled pretty decent. Major carbonation after the first sip and throughout. The three most prevalant tastes to me were; hazelnut, corriander and some kind of fruit. Maybe something like and apricot or plum. I pretty much got what I expected. Not a great beer, not a bad beer. It was on sale apparently as I noticed the $3.99 tag on the cork, so I would say it was worth a try for that. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again, but it wasn't bad for the price. Overall a pretty average beer."
"Tap, Torando, San Fransisco. Typical Belgian yeast, smells like a spicier De Koninck, candy malts, some caramel, some pepper and spice, soft texture, with a lightly tart finish, not too bad, but typically De Koninck and a little sweet to tell you the truth, quite a lot of carbonation aswell."
"I will give the one the benefit of the doubt in drinkability and hope that I got a bad sample. I may try this again but no time soon."
"Pours a dark but clear ruby color with slightly lacy head. The nose is fruity, quite sweet with what appears to be an overload of spices. The body is light and sweet, spiced beyond belief, but not so much that it overcomes the beer. I mean, this a good Belgian strong, the kind with arms that don't crush you in their embrace. I understand why this is a winter seasonal. The spicing is like apple pie without the apples. Sugarplum fairies? perhaps. I like the way it coats the tongue with flavorful spices. Kind of reminds me of a tripel in that way...."
"Ruby color. Medium white foamy head. Aroma is malty, bready and slightly sweet. A medium bodied Belgian Ale. Malts are fruity and slightly sweet. Touch of banana and clove, cherries and plums. There is also a touch of must that complements the dry finish. Slightly spicy. Nicely balanced. Soft carbonation. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet"
"There is an earthiness to this ale that is appropriate for its origins. There is a lot of body and an overwhelming flavor of coriander that is balanced well by the maltiness. I am surely keeping the cork in at least one bottle in a cool dark place for a taste next year."
"Not bad but not as distinctive and enjoyable as I had hoped."
"Pours a clear deep amber color with a tall light tan head that slowly drops at an even pace coating the walls of the glass with a sticky lace as it does so. Nose has some sugary candy-like sweetness to it along with some earthy aromas in the background. Medium in bodya bit thinner than Id expected. Taste begins with sweet malts and a bit of Belgian spice followed by some smoky and peaty notes but is lacking in depth throughout the tasting. A decent beer that I have no problem drinking, but I would have to say that this is a disappointment considering the quality of the other De Koninck beers I have tried."
"A crystal clear, scarlet-tinted deep-amber body rests gently beneath a tall head of rocky off-white foam that holds well and initially leaves thin, creamy rings and splashes of lace about the glass. The nose expresses the typical, dryish spice character of De Koninck. In the flavor, dried dark fruits (prune, raisin) and subtle yeasty spice (sublime cinnamon) appear before a well-balanced, solid bitterness comes into play. It's a touch musty; and there's a very deep caramelization to its subtly sweet toasty malt before leafy hops appear. It finishes dry with a touch of fruit, earth, and must. An enjoyable beer that tempts with its subtle complexities and satiates while beckoning another sip. Excellent drinkability rounds things out. Not unlike the other De Koninck beera, it's not a head turner but the bottle will empty surprisingly quickly. Great during the holidays before, during, and after a meal."
"Clear, jewel-red beer; a touch orangey. A medium-sized, tan, noisy head. Peanuts in the nose and a little tangy. Grainsy front, grapes, a bit sweet. Foamy middle is quite wine-like. More roasty grains in the finish. Nice bitterness. Is that apples? This is a decent, wine-like, grainsy beer. Not bad."
"($6.74 / 25.4 oz / 750 ml Corked and Caged Bottle)"
"Appearance: Copper brown mahogany in color wiht a nice full sized off white head leaves a nice amount of lacing that is intricate in design. Aroma: Stiff hop profile with the malt smelling similar to leather or maybe even some spent caramel malts if it's lucky with a slightly citrus account to tell of. Taste: Very blunt and in your face bitter and off I can't ever remember a big bottle that I disliked as much as this one. I can't deal with this some underlying spice is just no good here scores poorly across the board. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied overcaerbonated. Drinkability: Blah look for anyother winter ale and you'll be happy with what you went for."
"The Winter Koninck pours a dark brown with a fairly thin head. There's a yeasty plum scent to the beer, but not much else in terms of smell. The taste if rich and malty and of raisins, with a yeasty, lemoney aftertaste. After it warmed up a bit I noticed that the beer is definitely a little bit thin. Overall, the taste and smell were nice, but nothing spectactular, especially for a winter/strong belgian dark ale (ie you can definitely do better for this style)."
"I have to say I expected alot more from this beer,pours a medium brown with a decent creamy head,aroma was really smokey with some spiced cherries in their as well.The taste was not that pleasant seemed to be very medicinal with those smokey hints in there as well with a light nutmeg flavor that seemed to linger after swallowing.I wont get again but glad I tried it."
"A shame...I've definitely enjoyed the other De Koninck brews that I've had. I'm just hoping that I had a bad batch; otherwise, this is one I wouldn't have again."
"As I drain the glass and admire the spotty and sudsy lacing, I admire the well-balanced progression of tastes. First comes a slightly woody carbonation. Then the somewhat medicinal and slightly syrupy cherry flavor comes along. The long finish brings that bitter, slightly tart cheek-tingling wave. Nothing is underdone or overstated; each phase is ample and well-balanced. I like this stuff a lot. It's very drinkable for its style."
"Overall: I like De Koninck, but this is a bit of a disappointment sadly. It's thin & has 'forced' incoherent flavors, it is rather boring actually. This just does not quite do it for me to be honest, its not bad, rather just very average and not great. And  this was three bottles away from the two rows of Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru which was retailing for the same price, $6.99. Its just no contest Im afraid. I am not sure I would invest in this one again, in fact, I know I wouldnt. A big disappointment from a Brewery that I know can do much better than this."
"The beer in the mouth is incredibly fluffy with a long lingering cherry pit like touch."
