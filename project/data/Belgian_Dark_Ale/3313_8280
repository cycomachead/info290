Pours very cloudy dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of raisin, prune, caramel, toast, toffee, light chocolate, dark bread, and earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of caramel, toast, raisin, prune, toffee, light chocolate, dark bread, molasses, and earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, raisin, toast, toffee, dark bread, light chocolate, and earth on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and complexity of flavors; but were not as robust as I was hoping; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish.

Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Chunks of sediment are seen floating around and settling to the bottom of the glass. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, and some slight soy sauce aromas. Taste is much the same but quite watery and slightly sour. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel.

Sweet brown sugar flavor with a touch of vermouth. It does have some bitterness, but most of the flavor comes from the murky, musty funk. Peculiar fruitcake smell with something like artificial vanilla. If this is an authentic and historic beer, I bow down, but it reminds me why I keep vowing not to drink Belgian beers outside of their own land.","mactrail","Sep 01, 2011"

It poured to a deep brown color with a smallish medium colored tan head which had very slight retention and no real lacing, only a slight sheen at the top of the glass. Nose has a nice malt scent with some fruit highlights and a slight alcohol like aroma. Also some sour aromas come out which seem to go together quite nicely with the malt. The taste is also quite nice, not as complex as I would have thought. Nice malt flavors with a slight sourness that is so ever light. As the brew warms a slight alcohol flavor comes out mixed with some dark fruit like cherries. This is a pretty good brew, I guess I was expecting it to have a little more to it but it is a very easy drinking brew and seems to get a little better as it warms closer to room temp. Overall this is a nice brew, one I would get again.","Stimack","Dec 30, 2007"

Mild earthy, peaty notes, dark, caramelly malt, hints of cocoa, and grain-like smells, like wheat stalks in the aroma. The yeast imparts a mild raisiny fruitiness. Overall impression on first sip is that it's thin, but it certainly doesn't lack character. Chocolate covered raisins and caramel notes in the malt, very sparse hopping, but a small leafy dryness shows up in the finish. It has some similar yeast qualities to the Winterkoninkske, I'm just wondering if it's part of a signature style of theirs, from a unique yeast strain. I'll find out soon enough, because the Blond and Bloesem are in my posession as well, awaiting imbibement.

It's medium-light and just lightly crisp in the mouth with a very fine and natural moderate carbonation. The taste follows the aroma but follows a tighter path with some dark and lightly sugary malt flavors and a subtle acidity but no fruitiness; and there are some grassy hops that appear although they're not found in the aroma.
