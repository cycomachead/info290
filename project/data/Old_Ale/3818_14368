I had this problem with their KRAMPUS beer as well.  Infact, I am having trouble separating the taste of this and KRAMPUS.  They taste way too similar in my opinion.  Anyway, this is the second sampling from Southern Tier that is a good beer, but I am not tasting anything different or distinguishable.  They all taste like IPA's even though they are supposed to be a different style.  I am not saying that this OLD MAN is a bad beer.  It is a good beer.  I find it to be very bitter and hoppy which I like.  I wouldn't call it an ale or old ale though.  I guess my expectation from this company is to always blow me away since my first two Southern Tier samplings were their PUMKING and WARLOCK which are phenomenal!  This is a solid beer if you like hoppy, bitter beers with all the characteristics of an IPA.  I just wished for more of a creamy ale.","JPowell712","Dec 29, 2014"

3.33,-9.5,4,3.5,3.25,3,3.25,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and I thought it was pretty close to being an average example of the style, I know this style always doesn't have to be on the stronger side, but i felt like this beer was missing some of that complexity that I look for in the style and when it came down to it I didn't find it to be too memorable.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little watery, pretty crisp, slight prickly, not too filling and the taste didn't do a great job of holding my attention, one is enough for me any more than that and I would start to get bored with it.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance, this was a pretty good looking beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel and that it was jut a little bland and not to memorable, those aspects held this beer back.  I don't think I would buy this beer again, but I wouldn't turn one down.  I can't say I would recommend this as a good Old Ale, but it may be worth a try to see what you think of it.  All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer, it didn't really have anything that made it stick out to me and it reminded me a lot of how an IPA tastes when it get too old without that stale malt aspect.  This one was falls right in the middle for Southern Tier and it's very average for an Old Ale.  I just wasn't that into this beer, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Dec 21, 2014"

Maybe a very hoppy Amber or just an APA with some unique malt / hop combos.  So while overall it isn't an Old Ale to style, it is a beer that grew on me over the course of the glass.  It went quite well with food (pork chops with roasted potatoes & sweet potatoes) and by itself was rather tasty.  I think if another one was offered I'd probably take it telling me its drinkability is actually pretty good, and dangerously so at 7% ABV.","damndirtyape","Dec 12, 2014"

Very light nose of sweet malt (biscuit and caramel) with hints of tropical citrus and either plum or pear.  Light medium body that has a nice oily texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the finish.  The flavor profile is of normal intensity, fairly balanced and has a bit of complexity.  It begins with hop flavor (pine and citrus rind) that flows into a medium bitterness.  As the bitterness fades, mostly caramel sweetness is noted.  This sweetness lingers through the finish and becomes totally caramel in nature.  The finish leaves you with a nice alcohol burn at the back of the throat and a ""peppery"" note with a grain alcohol residual flavor.","tillmac62","Nov 20, 2014"

3.78,2.7,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/30/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, toffee, orange zest, floral, grass, light pine, light raisin, nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity of dark/bready malt and moderate hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, toffee, orange zest, floral, grass, pine, herbal, light raisin, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine/floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, toffee, orange zest, floral, grass, herbal, light pine, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy/piney hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a light creamy and moderately sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Old ale. Good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy/piney hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 02, 2014"

3.76,2.2,4.5,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"Pours from the bottle with a deep amber color and a light, foamy tan head. The aroma is initially dominated by caramel and sweet bread, with the woodsy, earthy hop profile being comparatively soft at first, but the hop aromatics become more dominant as the beer warms. The flavor is similarly rich and malty but well-balanced by the mildly-astringent woodsy hops. I would say that the taste is crisp, but not in a refreshing way. Rather, it tastes like standing outside at night after a new snow. The mouthfeel has a solid, somewhat resinous feel, with a fine, soft carbonation that lifts the flavors up rather than obscuring them. Overall, this beer is hearty and flavorful without being overly assertive or syrupy, making a nice complement to cool winter weather.","devilben02","Jan 02, 2014"

3.88,5.4,4,4,3.75,3.75,4,"Overall, the best thing about this brew was its flavoring. While the aroma was nice and fruity, it gave way to a much more complex and bittered, with bite and metallic grittiness to the bone. All the while the fruit was echoing across the top, but dynamically, and not as strongly as the nose would suggest. This is not what we would classify as your typical “old ale”, but it did show strength of musk and depth to the grain bill throughout. This is one of Southern Tier’s last “major-line” beers for us to rate, and we feel it fits the pedigree well. We’ve probably been avoiding this guy in particular for so long on account of some local friends warning us away from it, but as locals ourselves, we will stand by this beer as a decent upstate seasonal.","TheBrewo","Dec 07, 2013"

I could not detect any sense of spiciness or notes typical of a winter ale. In the taste, one gets notes of orange, some mild spice, and alcohol. For a winter beer, I thought the mouthfeel was fairly thin. The finish was a tart malty after that brings a fairly bland winter ale to a head. I love winter ales, but will pass on this one in the future.","JohnnyHopps","Jul 26, 2013"

Very drinkable for the style- not sweet, only a little sticky. It's too juicy; leaves me wanting characteristics of wood, DRIED grapes, alcohol warmth, etc... the stuff that makes me love the old ale style. It's wintery in the spiciness, sure, but could pass for an IPA, esp. fresh, in its lack of malt backbone or character. The malts are certainly detectable in the feel of the beer, despite being largely absent from the taste. I'd be happy to encounter a fresh one, just for comparison's sake.","gustogasmic","Mar 23, 2012"

Mild aroma of fresh light fruit and slight hops. Flavor is fairly subtle, dominated by roasted and bready malt, light citrus. Finishes rather dry with a bit of a phenolic flavor that may be contributed by the spicing and hops. Medium bodied. The main flavor is nice but the finish taste combination doesn't work for me.","LiquidAmber","Jan 14, 2012"

Butterscotch and roasted malt sweetness up front. These tastes wash away pretty quickly though as a spicy hop presence sweeps through. Also has some burning wood like characteristics to it.

The nose consisted of distant spices and some candy fruit; almost like a bland fruitcake. The taste revealed a very subtle sour fruit and candi sugar midpalate, with a weak, semi-sweet finish. The body was surprisingly thin as well; borderline watery, with no carbonation.

A slow pour yielded a bunch of cream/egg shell colored foam that was thick and full but lacked life, leaving a cap, small squiggly lines on the way down. Smell is malty and rich and pungent, it does not leap from the glass, but the scent is full up front, caramel, chocolate, some lingering yeast, bread crumbs, some dark fruit, not old alse though. Same is for the taste, the toasted malt is there present and roasted as well, but not in mass quanity like the big boys. After that, some plum, apple, touch of chocolate. Don't pick up any hop flavor. Feel is medium strong and malty. Goes down with a slight punch to the tounge. Drinkability is one bottle would not have more than that. I see this as a really light old ale, as Rock Art Ridge Runner is a light English Barleywine. A smaller package(to style) of the bigger thing.

The aroma of this beer was a bit surprising. I was expecting some fruity deep malts but got quite a nice hop aroma instead. There are some spicy malt smells going on as well, but they are muted by the hops. A little bitter on the tip of the tongue but the malts pull through on the palate to smooth this one out. Finishes bitter though, quite a strange. There is a very muted spice note detected as well. A little thin for an old ale, not even sure this should classify as one.

Some of us have a preconcieved idea of what winter ales should be. Strong, darker and full of heavy malt flavours. This beer is strong, darkish and full of hop flavours. Come on, its Southern Tier, what did I expect? Pours a brilliant, deep copper with exceptional clarity capped with a firm dome of resiliant bubbles. Aroma is hoppy; spicy, resinous and piney. Not in your face like some beers but plenty powerfull. Flavour mirrors the aroma with the obvious addition of hop bitterness, which is quite smooth by my standards and well thats about it. Malt really takes a back seat in this one. There is some caramel sweetness in there somewhere, but its very subtle. Medium bodied and dry on the finish.

It had good body and was easy to drink, with practically no hint of its ABV. So this was an enjoyable beer, but it was disappointing as an old ale. And what's more is that it didn't seem like it will age well (although that won't stop me from trying!).","Pencible","Dec 19, 2008"

The aroma is of grassy and floral hops, very much like an APA. The taste is the floral/grassy hops up front which is supported by bready slightly toasted malt. Again very APA like, perhaps more of a malt body. Not sure how to rate this as it doesn't taste like an old ale, but tastes good. I will cellar one for a while to see what changes. The brew has a nice chewy feel with enough carbonation to make this very drinkable, nice balance between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. A nice hoppy ale with good malt presence. Great balance makes this very drinkable, ABV is well hidden.","Gmann","Dec 12, 2008"

Deep toasted, bordering on a faint roast, malt character. Plus some very ripe plums. But the bitter hop profile keeps this supposed ""old ale"" from being very malty or fruity.

This is not what I ws expecting at all...more like a very good IPA. Very well balanced between the great hop character and the malts. A certain spice element is present in the background but not along the lines of a traditional holiday spice like nutmeg or cinnamon..more like a spiciness from the hops.

No real outstanding bitterness other than a subtle tart finish. Light to medium body, which was unexpected. I didn't know much about old ales when I bought this but the description lead me to the it would be significantly more dextrinous. Overall a very pleasant beer to drink.

The malt presence is firm and shares flavors of caramel, dates, nuts, pecans, and toffee. These are equally present in aromas as flavor. However the hops lurk in the background aromas, but are bold in their bittering. A medium grassy / piney hop flavor spices up the flavors and linger a bit longer than the malts. The beer is bold, solid, and firm, yet not heavy, cloying, or chewy. A good beer that eats like a meal. I do recommend.","BEERchitect","Jan 15, 2007"

The head retention is fair and it leaves some nice, small, splashes and spots of lace about the glass. The nose is somewhat limited in comparison to the richer flavor inside; yet bright notes of floral and grassy hops swirl over a burnt-caramel maltiness and yeasty fruitiness. It's very smooth, and even lightly creamy across the palate with a medium-full body and restrained, fine-bubbled carbonation. Mildly sweet and deeply caramelized malt appears upfront in the flavor; accented by some yeasty, berry-like fruitiness. Grassy, floral, and piney/spicy hops rise almost immediately; and are then overtaken by a powerful, quick-rising bitterness. It finishes extremely dry and dusty, with a burnt-malt acidity and long lasting, bone-dry bitterness. The combination of rich malt, bold hops, and forceful bitterness is impressive; but at the same time it seems to lose some complexity as everything becomes muddled. Additionally, the brute assault of its bitterness eventually dampens the palate and a good bit of drinkability is lost. Still, it's an impressive, bold beer when enjoyed at just below cellar temperature on a cold winter's day.","NeroFiddled","Jan 23, 2005"

Taste begins with a diluted mouthfeel and then sugary caramel malts followed by bitter floral hops. Barley is there but seems really grainy and out of place. Finish has a bitter hop spiciness and fusel alcohol. Alcohol warmth, flavors are present the whole way through and actually makes this beer much more enjoyable. There's just too many residual sugars and hop resins in this beer, like they threw a whole bunch of both ingredients and more yeast in the secondary or after the boil.

It has a creamy feel to it; refreshing despite an elevated abv. .The taste is good. It is a malty beer with a slightly bitter hop flavor to it. I warms a little on the way down, but it finishes clean. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good seasonal. I am always surprised by the quality beers that Southern Tier produces. They are certainly making a splash in the hand crafted field.","WesWes","Feb 18, 2004"
4.4,19.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Southern Tier continues to impress me with every new beer I've had, and they show why they're deserving of Lew Bryson's choice of Best New Brewery. A fantastic old ale, with just the right mix of hops in there, and certainly one I'll have next year.","beergeek279","Feb 09, 2004"
3.5,-4.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a very lovely amber with an equally lovely creamy eggshell head. Lots of lacing here. Smells faintly caramel in it's malt with the citrus of the hops coming to the forefront. Definitely a little estery. Tatses very smooth with a lot of chunks of some big sweet malt. A little nutty, a little toffee and then a really fast switch to a fairly hoppy ending. Mouthfeel is medium with carbonation present, but not overbearing. Very drinkable.","yankeeheel","Jan 25, 2004"
4.65,26.4,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Let me start with just stating how outstanding this brew is. Appearance: Ruby amber brown with a nice creamy tan head leaves a good amount of lacing not too shabby at all very nice appearance going down. Aroma: Piney hops awesome aromatics here huge caramel malts giving a roasted malt character that's well needed in the wintertime. Taste: Deliciously spicy this is where it's at the hops play their role down to the T with the caramel malt presence tying it all together what a dream beer Southern Tier strikes again my favorite new micro of the year by far. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with slightly oily texture just due to the amount of hops playing a role in this brew. Drinkability: Perfect winter in my eyes not too sweet perfect hop profile a masterful job done by an inscenduary brewing team up in New York some where.","WVbeergeek","Jan 16, 2004"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"When will Southern Tier ever make a bad beer? The old man winter poured a deep mahogony with splashes of autumn brilliance. An eggshell white head perched on top and receded into a half film half bubble top and good lacing. Smelled deeply of leafy hops and brown sugary malts and the slightest twang of esters. Taste was sharp and hoppy up front mellowinginto a chocolate like sweetness finishing with dried fruit and sticky sweet notes in the finish. The increased alcohol warmed my throat as it went down. This is a highly quaffable and dare I say session strong ale. I would almst venture to say with the increased hop presence that this could qualify as a low-octane barley wine. And its dirt cheap as well. Drink up.","GreatPondBrewer","Jan 10, 2004"
4.18,13.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Another very nice ale from Southern Tier, impressively drinkable. If I cellar a case of hoppy christmas ale, it's going to be this one, not a Californian offering.","shirfan","Dec 18, 2003"
3.16,-14.1,4,3,3,4,3,"Drinkability: This is a decent old ale, but too hoppy IMO, and the burnt characteristics were somewhat distracting.","DagFishHead","Dec 17, 2003"
3.11,-15.5,3.5,2.5,3,4,3.5,"Poured a small off-white head that faded fast and left a smattering of lace. The smell is funky, a combination of hops and burped up corn. It's a fairly transparent beer and dark amber in color. The body is on the light side of medium, and the carbonation makes for a smooth mouthfeel. The flavor reminds me of a hopped up lager, and the finish is only slightly bitter.","HappyHourHero","Dec 17, 2003"
