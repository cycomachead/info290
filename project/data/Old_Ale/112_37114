The brandy character is incredibly unique which makes this beer truly one of a kind. If you see it, get it immediately. If you have one, drink it. If you have two, let the other one sit for 1 to 3 years for this beer to reach its potential as a never before seen animal.","BrotherDylan","Jan 11, 2015"

4.75,5.8,,,,,,"500ml pour into New Belgium globe glass. Pours a dark cherry. Very little head that dissipates quickly. Smell is boozy with notes of dark fruit, some vanilla and caramel. The first sip is full of brandy flavor that leads to a mild caramel taste.  Due to the strong boozy taste after the first sip I was unsure if I was up to drinking the whole bottle but after a few sips the drinkability improves. Overall a fantastic beer, I found it at a bottle shop in rural New Jersey and am very glad with the purchase. A very complex and enjoyable beer that I would certainly try again.","Wameron","Dec 04, 2014"

4.26,-5.1,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.5,"O: While barrel aging has been all the rage in the Craft beer segment for years, finding a brandy barrel aged beer is still very much a rarity. It's a welcome change of pace from the ubiquitous bourbon barrel aging. In this case the brandy flavors are the focal point of a beer whose base flavor profile complements them most graciously. The sweet, sticky, malty, and vinous flavors of the old ale are a perfect springboard for a dominant brandy barrel character. This is a gratifying and complex sipper that offers a very unique experience. It has an upper-class air about it. I actually prefer it to bourbon barrel aged old stock. Worth the high price tag.","ryan1788a5","Jul 17, 2014"

The toffee is probably the strongest note I get here and it slowly fades into a burnt raisin skin note near the middle. The beer gets drier and drier as it goes, finally ending in a slightly hot finish with big notes of brandy, maple syrup and pronounced oak. There's a good amount of carbonation in here, leading me to want to assume this beer is far less than 15%. A quick attempt to get out of my chair leads me to believe otherwise, though.

4.52,0.7,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"2011 Vintage. Pours a nicely carbonated dark, brownish red color with a small, off-white head. Scent is STRONG in booze. A ton of hot brandy and other whiskey aromas. Tons of dark fruits with a whole lot of malt. Lots of vanilla and a hint of toffee. More sweet brandy...this beer smells spectacular. Taste is just as good as the beer smells. Boozy brandy and oaky barrel flavors up front. Sweet brandy and vanilla flavors. Lots of dark fruits...plums, raisins, prunes, and dates. Wow, this thing is boozy. Lingering maple syrup on the tongue. Mouthfeel is a bit over-carbonated...but doesn't lose points for this. Very full-bodied. Drinkability is high, but a sipper. Overall, this beer is fantastic! Very hot, but I can't wait to see how this ages over the years.","DovaliHops","0"

A true sipper; 500ml is almost too much (thankfully it's not a 750, are you listening The Bruery?). Seriously big and seriously good. One of the very best Old Ales out there.

Pours dark brown with a slight red hue and a one finger yellowish brown head. Big time sweet brandy aroma with lots of nuttiness and brown sugar, maybe a little cocoa. Very much like a pralines smell. Big bold brandy flavor with plenty of nuts and brown sugar. Caramel, marshmallow, toffee wow. This is impressive. Lots of sweet brown sugar but balanced by some nutty bitterness. Body is heavy and slightly boozy but lightened by a surprisingly large amount of carbonation. I recently had Bois (bourbon) and this beer reminds me a lot of that, albeit with less vanilla flavors. A very nice after dinner treat.","BMMillsy","Jan 30, 2014"

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, bread pudding, brandy, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with brown sugar, toffee, and brandy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of wood bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel.

A little bit of alcohol, but nothing overwhelming. The taste is sweet with brandy and grape, followed up by some vanilla, coconut, oak, caramel, and some raisin. A bit of brown sugar as well.

As it warms up, I get red grapes, brown sugar and a hint of sweet soy sauce. On the tongue it's rich, full-bodied and sweet, with flavors of brandy and oak supported by a huge caramel malt backbone. Light fruitiness mid-palate leads to a semi-sweet vanilla finish.

A sweet sugary caramel rides behind the dark fruit aromas, hints of leather are noticeable as well. Taste is similar to the aroma in that the brandy is big and right up front in the taste as well. When mixed with the sweet malts it lends a coconut-y flavor, sweet, nutty dates towards the finish. Large bite of alcohol in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is medium in body, thins towards the finish as a drying alcohol warmth burns at the back of the throat.

Incredibly complex aroma that gives notes of raisins, figs, caramel, toffee from the base beer as well as added dimensions of brandy soaked wood, vanilla and coconut from the oak. Flavor consists of chocolate, caramel, brandy, coconut, vanilla, dark fruit. Port-like character. Chewy and beyond rich. This beer is amazing and a total jaw dropper. Thanks to Steve for sharing.","Crosling","Jul 20, 2008"

4.65,3.6,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Thought I would like the bourbon barrel version better than this but I was wrong, reminded of the first Angel's Share I tasted in several ways, one of the better old ales I have tasted and the oak aging did wonders for this one, would definitely drink again, hopefully North Coast does something like this in the future, highly recommended","Floydster","Apr 29, 2008"

4.67,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"A truly wonderful fusion of flavors, this is probably the best brandy barrel aged beer I've had. The spirit character was more integrated and delicate than other brandy barrel aged beers I've had. Try to get your hands on some of this!","SacoDeToro","Mar 13, 2008"
4.74,5.6,4,5,5,4,4.5,"d: Huge thanks to rallison for the chance to try this one. I spent more than two hours on this one and, frankly, I could have used a little help. This was my first brandy barrel aged beer and I hope I get to enjoy some more.","DIM","Mar 13, 2008"
4.77,6.2,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Maybe a bit thin. Lots of warming, lingering alcohol. Still manages to not be boozy or overly hot. This is a fantastic beer, with so much complexity. Very well made.","Bierguy5","Mar 12, 2008"
4.79,6.7,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Alcohol is definitely a factor. Nice and warming yet not in an obtrusive manner. Although the alcohol may play a factor in the less than full mouthfeel (less than what you would expect from this).","mcallister","Mar 12, 2008"
4.03,-10.2,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"D_Very nice sipper here. The potency limits how often I would drink but it is one I would seek out again. This would be nice in front of a fire after a day of cold weather activity.","sleazo","Mar 01, 2008"
4.68,4.2,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Thanks goes to IntriqKen for this one. Pours a darker brown. On the first pour I guess I was going a wee bit too gentle and no head formed. At the end there was a thin creme head though. Nose was strong with alcohol with some wood and a sweet tone mixed in. I got a little worried when I took a whiff because it was leading me to believe it was going to be unbalanced and a bit intense. But hey...that wasn't the case at all. Extremely smooth flavor profile with sherry character and some vanilla and a nice overall sweet tone. Really beautiful. Feel was smooth and a bit slick. Lower carbonation, but it makes no difference. This is really a great beer. Exceptionally made and so smooth to drink. Easily a substitution for any after dinner drink, it also could be a great gateway beer to showcase the possibilities of what can be done. I want more, and I want it now.","RblWthACoz","Feb 21, 2008"

4.29,-4.5,4,5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"D. Drinkable? Not in quantity, but this brew makes up for that in deliciousness and complexity. This is one of the best American Old Ales I've had. If you can't afford the $200 for Jim Koch's finest, this is a good second bet. High praise.","kkipple","Beers"
4.36,-2.9,3.5,5,4.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability is good. A big huge beer that has a lot going on in the flavor department. Yet another excellent crafted beer from North Coast. It looks like I am in the minority though, I like the Bourbon Barrel version better.","flexabull","0"
4.2,-6.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The mix of caramelized malt / wood notes and butterscotch oak character in the nose is incredible. The barrel influence here is huge, but amazingly it marries extremely well with the base beer, or at the least it is not a harsh, overwhelming barrel character. Visually this beer was a bit disappointing with the quickly disappearing head, but when you take into account the alcohol percentage the head was actually quite substantial. I really like that the body of this brew is not overly thick, though this is most definitely a sipping brew; it could use / stand up to a bit more residual malt character though. This really is such a great, flavorful beer, but in the end it is the lack of extra malty oomph that keeps this from being the perfect marriage between barrel and malt. Still a fantastic brew, but at times it can even be a bit thin when compared to the ample brandy barrel notes. Don't get me wrong though, this is a fantastically tasty brew. The fact that the flavors from the barrel are so well integrated and somehow not overwhelming despite being dominant really makes this an incredibly enjoyable brew (pick up the base beer flavors a bit and this would be perfect).","Gueuzedude","Jan 11, 2008"
4.42,-1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A big enjoyable potent beer for a cold night. Deep and dark copper, a tan head disappears instantly. Sharp aroma of brandy is strong but not off putting, this is still a beer. Very smooth, with just the right amount of balance between the regular profile and brandy addition. Full bodied yet not filling. A great sipper for after dinner enjoyment and as a night cap. Outstanding beer from North Coast.","Mark","Dec 24, 2007"
4.18,-6.9,5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 3/4"" tan head above the cloudy, barely translucent dark reddish brown brew. Head dwindles rather quickly, but still a standout for a BA old brew, with ample slow-falling lacing. Aroma is dark fruity alcohol with leathery maltiness. Taste follows the nose, the malt sweetness upfront, quickly falling to the prevalent alcohol. Not much room for the fruitiness or brandy character with all the alcohol numbing the mouth and throat. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh, but not so much for the BA old ale arena, and drinkability is good as well. Glad I got to try this one.","ppoitras","Dec 10, 2007"
4.52,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Drinkability: An awesome beer. North Coast is playing for keeps! I certainly can't see me ever being able to try this one again and that's just a tad depressing.","ChainGangGuy","Dec 03, 2007"
4.42,-1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I've spent an hour drinking this and each sip gets better as it warms. In a few years it will score 5's. Can't wait to try the bourbon barrel.","kirok1999","Nov 28, 2007"
