"maybe if this years batch was 12.4% abv, the heat could balance the sweet.  As is it now, enjoyable but underwhelming.  It took me three days to finish the bottle, as I would have a small glass and then decide I wanted a better beer, so I'd grab a Backwoods Bastard or a Hopslam ( cork the Hibernation and stick it back in fridge)"

"Eh. This is a disappointment after Great Divideâ€™s fine lineup & their world-class barrel aged treatments of Yeti & Old Ruffian, kind of like looking at before & after pics of Courtney Cox. Pretty good."

"Not a bad beer, but the barrel character is not as up front as I expected."

"Deep dark brown in color with just the faintest trace of a fingernail of khaki head around the rim.  A touch of light seeps through when held up to light.  Light Brussels lacing.  I smell plenty of sweet whiskey along with vanilla and caramel.  The taste is packed with sweet whiskey and dark malt.  The mouth is bone dry and sticky.  There's a warming from the alcohol in the fade with a gentle burn.  2014 vintage."
"2011 vintage. Perhaps a bit past it's prime."
"Overall: A very good barrel aged version of an already good malty beer. Nice mix of whiskey flavors with the toasty malt and fruit undertones."
""
"O: super take on the style, which always benefits from barrel aging - stays light and easy to drink despite the decent abv - finely crafted and highly recommended"
""
"Murky, thinned, oaky, vaniila and oxidized dark fruits. No reason to wait on opening these bottles."

"One can't help but love a big beer with a multitude of aroma, taste, and textural elements. Depth and complexity hit you with every sip. The best point might be how well everything ties together and results in a great tasting, relatively easy drinking beer. Quite the find and worth the price of admission..."

"Bottom line: If circumstances allow, open the bottle & call a cab because this one kicks butt. It will be worth it, promise."

"Crazy that the beer picks up this much alcohol. The regular hibernation is around 8 percent ABV; the BA version is over 12. Great showcase of the whiskey flavors."
""
"2011 750 ml bottle at Euclid Hall in Denver, poured 6-29-14. Pours dark brownish amber, slightly murky, with a small off white to khaki head. The head recedes quickly and there is just a rim around the edges by the time I take a sip. Aroma is big bourbon notes, heavy caramel malts, light molasses, vanilla, oak, and more bourbon. Flavor follows the aroma rather closely with a nice caramel molasses feel, supported by bourbon in the background. Light vanilla notes are there, but not as strong as when fresh I would guess. Body is thinner than expected--especially after loving regular hibernation so much--but maybe a slight nitpick. Still some decent carbonation in this one. Definitely a beer to seek out if you can find it. Not sure it was worth the $54 price tag at the restaurant, but hey, you only live once."
""
"This doesn't work on any level. Way too boozy, way to sweet. Flavor profile is disjointed and splashy. Hibernation is a decent winter sipper, nothing to get excited about but satisfying if you're in the mood for such a brew. Barrel-aging renders it almost undrinkable."

"i always passed this one up because of the price tag, but thats been a mistake, what a wonderful brew this is, tasting not a whole lot like its original base beer, but becoming something entirely different, more like a barleywine than anything i think. deep rustic brown color, glowing amber, but deep and darker than that. think light khaki head on top caps it off. the nose on this is awesome, layers of sweet oak and molasses come out, warming alcohol, rich caramel malt, and of course bourbon, a lot of bourbon. the taste too starts off with a warming alcohol vanilla hit, followed by waves of sweet grain and old oak. i even get a little charred spice in there towards the finish. the alcohol is so subtle here, its there, but way back. a perfect winter beer, especially when its warm. it takes regular hibernation to a whole new level. the barrel has not only added flavor and strength, but a refinement of the feel. carbonation has settles, body has amplified, and this drinks like a glass of cognac. really special stuff from great divide. among their best."
"(O)- Overall, it has alot of rich rustic flavors to it, but that really high carbonation level gets in the way of total enjoyment for me. Glad to have finally tried this one."

"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, caramel, toffee, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and shows some solid bourbon barrel aging along with the base beer."

"Overall I am disappointed. I love hibernation and plan on buying another case when it comes out. Price to flavor I would say this falls flat and I would recommend against it. Maybe with just 1 year on it, it would maintain but not what I had."
""
""
""
"Overall. A good big beer. Nothing amazing going on, but solid and drinkable."

"Overall (with minimal knowledge of the style) I'd rate this at a 4.5."

"A rather pleasant barrel-treated old ale, the big selling points of each side hefty, but agreeably integrated. This took a long time to put back, familial interactions and all that, so rendering the big ABV a surprisingly moot point. If you think your typical old ale could use a bit more booze and grainy wood, then this is the beer for you."
"Overall - Really nice barrel character. Overpowering, almost. A very nice treatment."
""
""
"O-For the price not worth it, however because it was aged for a while that could have been the issue."
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Medium-full mouthfeel with low carbonation. Pretty slick. Overall this was a good old ale, and I was very glad to get the chance to trade for it and try it. Held up pretty well with age. Definitely a dessert-type beer, as it does have a good amount of sweetness. It probably drinks harder than the ABV would suggest. Definite sipper."

"O: Hmph, I have to say that I think regular hibernation is better than this one. Barrel aging doesn't seem to have improved it much, it ends up being very sharp and boozy while also tasting a bit oxidized which does not help. Barrel overwhelms too, in my opinion. Overall still quite good, but not an improvement. Especially for the price and and difficulty to obtain."

"4.0 D: Good beer, but not worth the $30 this cost me in Pittsburgh. I guess I should just be happy it made it out to here."

"O: Pretty solid overall. The whiskey barrel is prominent without being hot or overbearing. Definitely enjoyed this one."

"O: I payed $32.00 for this beer and I wouldn't do it again. Seems like this beer is somewhat hard to get, and it's pretty good, so I'm not unhappy about the purchase. I had a BA 4D last night as well, and this isn't standing up to it, especially for that price tag. If you like whiskey or boiler makers, get this brew. I enjoyed it because of that, but at the same time prefer a bit more balance and malt/sweetness presence in this kind of beer. Can't wait to try BA Old Ruffian and Yeti."

"O-I love whiskey so this is right up my alley, it is 100% whiskey barrel forward and can be fatiguing in quantities over 6-8oz but a nice barrel aged winter warmer."
"Would buy again, even though it's pricey."
"I love barrel aged beers. I really expected a lot more from the beer..expectations were high, but at best, this was maybe slightly above average and needs some work by Great Divide. A: cloudy dirt brown. S: nothing special. T: tastes were muted and bland, very average...I really really wished and hoped there were more, but it just was not there...it seems the barrel aging gave this beer a kinda musty taste. M: somewhat weird combined with the off tastes, not that enjoyable. O: a let down..."

"Big thanks to jedwards for sharing. Bottles 219/492. Pours a dull mahogany hue with no head, just a cluster of bubbles pooling in one corner. Nose expresses bourbon notes, wood and a hint of ethanol. As the brew begins to warm I also get a lightly sugared and toffee-like character. Taste is fairly subtle. While it is somewhat consistent with the nose there is also something else happening in the flavor profile - not quite sour or tart, but definitely a character that cuts through the anticipated sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a mild carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Overall, a very drinkable Old Ale with a well-hidden abv. Not my favorite BA Old Ale, but it is quite pleasant and goes down so easily."
"While this is a great beer, the price just isn't worth it, unless it came is smaller bottles and in a 6 or 4 pack. Highly unlikely, but drinking a 750ml needs more than 1 person. But I don't want to waste it on ""people"" :P"
"Not bad, but I was expecting a bit more; the barrel character runs a bit roughshod over the base beer. If this had a lot more caramelized maltiness and quite a bit of a richer, hell even sweeter, body that could stand up to the barrel influence, this would be a much better experience. The beer actually seems to do well in very small amounts; if I come back to it after a while I can take a small sip or two that maintains a balance to it, but it ends up getting thin, somewhat too spicy, and a bit too hot after any more than this."

"Big thanks goes out to Rake who sent me this one in a past trade! 2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured reddish brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, very sweet alcohol, toffee, subtle brown sugar, and a touch of caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, sweet alcohol, wood, toffee, caramel, and subtle brown sugar. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a fairly solid brew. The barrels really shined through on this one and made their presence known. I wasn't expecting this as the brew had been aging in my cellar for this long, but was pleasantly surprised what I did find. A solid offering from Great Divide and I look forward to trying the bottle of BA Old Ruffian I have in my cellar to conplete the set."

"Overall this was a nice offering, but lacked the overall quality I was hoping for with this beer. The whiskey barrel really overwhelmed the base beer leaving the flavor profile slightly one dimentional. While is was tasty, I won't be seeking out any more with great effort in the near future."
"mouthfeel - thin and not much carbonation, yikes. heres where the age murdered the beer."
"Edit: Really picked up with a lot of air. Thin gaps disappeared more but still evident, so a slight correction in rating."
"Smell is sweet malts with notes of brown sugar, toffee, caramel and oak surrounded in whiskey. Taste follows nicely with rich flavors providing a fairly sweet Old Ale that is thick with low carbonation. Glad I got a chance to try this one."
"Darn good and yet, I am dissapointed. Maybe its past its prime. I don't dislike it, but its not as good as I was hoping for. A bit too boozy, a touch too thin, but still very good."
"Overall, a very tasty offering. I'm glad to have tried it and would certainly enjoy having it again."
"Beer is medium in body and quite sweet like candy on the front. There is a nice bourbon presence in the midpalate and the finish is appropriately heavy and not dry. There is not much bitterness at the back, less than I expected which shifts my focus to the front half of the beer, leaving me with nothing to linger on in the back. The flavors of toffee and caramel are a nice counterpoint to the booziness of the midpalate and booziness is not out of place for the overall experience of the beer. I really enjoyed, a sleeper beer for sure, people should be more excited about this one. The base beer is also quite good."
"d - Overall I thought this was a really great old ale. I loved the taste and would have liked a little more bourbon in the nose and carbonation in the mouthfeel, but still an awesome beer. Would love to try again sometime."
"Pours a moderate brown color and is slightly murky. Nose contained a good amount of toffee as well as some light caramel. Some brown sugar and light barrel character there as well. Not super complex, but the barrel character was seriously nice, coming through particularly well in the finish, which was exquisite. Taste was caramel and bourbon. Nice. Mouthfeel was ridiculously smooth and lacked nearly any alcohol presence. Low carbonation and a medium body. A nice offering, and the mouthfeel was really killer. Big highlight for me."
"3.5/4/4/3.5/4"
"Tried this beer at Donnelly's in Fairport, New York. Exceptional taste and surprisingly high in ABV, despite it not tasting like it should be. I would definitely recommend this beer to those looking for a very flavorful beer that's not incredibly heavy."
"Creamy md-light in the mouth with mild carbonation. Great drinkability and this will improve in a couple years as the alcohol heat settles more and the flavors meld together."
"Certainly a strange barrel-aged old ale, the whiskey barrel didn't impart much of the caramel and vanilla sweetness I've come to expect from this type of beer, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's a leathery, tannic, fairly oxidized and complex sipper."
"D - It's good. i could drink plenty of this."
"Pours a thinnish looking brown color, with a light brown head that doesn't stick around for long. Huge bourbon aromas dominate, but there is also vanilla, toffee, oak and dark fruit. Huge boozy palate, with loads of bourbon. Eventually I get a little caramel, toffee and brown sugar before the warming alcohol takes over. Totally different from the original hibernation."
"Great drinkability, a luxury that alas may not stack up to many other Old ales, barrel aged or not; if you are seeking value for your dollar. Thrilled to have tried this, but was expecting more to be honest"
"D - Unique beer... nice to try. Not for the session."
"Overall a nice change up for me. I thought it could have been a little bigger, for the time it spent in the barrel it was very mellow and nicely done. Maybe with a year or so on it it will really start to flourish."
"Overall, this was pretty decent. The ale is a little to light and the flavor didn't really soak up the oak and the bourbon as much."
"I'm a big fan of the regular Hibernation and, to me, this isn't quite as good. It's completely dominated by the barrel character, which overshadows the solid beer underneath. I'm hoping (and expecting) this one to age well and get better with a little time."
"This beer really needs some age. It is drinking really hot and it is difficult to get anything but alcohol out of the flavor."
"Drinks well for 11% and should age well for years to come."
"Overall, this is not overdone with the alcohol like the bourbon yeti was. Both barrel versions I've had have been very lightly carbonated. I'm surprised by how subdued the flavors were for me, given how complex original Hibernation is. It's interesting to try, but regular Hibernation is better, and this is not worth $25 a bottle."
"Bottle #376/492 $25. I am a big fan of the regular version so I gave up the $25 for this one which I will say is not as good as the regular version unless you really like whiskey. It might be a shade darker than the standard version or maybe its just hazier. It smells like whiskey, alcohol, really an interesting smell. The flavor is really overwhelmed by the barrel-aging to the point that I can barely tell its Hibernation any more. Whiskey, wood, alcohol, vanilla, intense but just doesn't do it for me."
"An amazing beer that would be perfect for those cold nights by the fire. Or just any time worth remembering."
"Note: if you don't like barrel aged beers, or are expecting this to taste like regular Hibernation, don't bother with this one, as the barrel aging has completely changed the character of the beer from regular Hibernation. But if you like BA brews, you'll probably like this one a lot."
