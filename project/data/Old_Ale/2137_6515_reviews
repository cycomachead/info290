"Great/ balance beer overall.. not too heavy not too light"
""
"Strong, malty aroma has an earth overtone that brings to mind fallen leaves, as well as hints of cloves and caramel. Pours a barely translucent warm dark woody brown with a fairly thick tan head. Flavor just says ""autumn"" with roast malt and earth tones plus a hint of cloves. It’s almost like drinking the very essence of autumn. Smooth texture has decent body and fizz. An excellent brew to celebrate fall."

"3.44/5: First Breckenridge beer I properly enjoyed"
""
""
""
""
"Wow, never expected this from Breck. A great, great ale with lots of autumnal charm and inspiration. Goes great with that not-quite-cold-but-there's-that-chill-in-the-air weather. Tasty, easy-to-drink, a sessionable old ale? Guess so, lucky CO."

"back.  A solid autumn ale that satisfies but does not over impress."

"O: An enjoyable tour de malt, with the nutty and toffee flavors blending well."
""
""
"Dark brownish-copper. There are subtle roasted notes in the nose.  The flavor profile has an interesting combination of roasted and bready notes."

"09/05/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Once I had my face in the glass it was a nose full of stout-like aromas. Chocolate & caramel. But the most memorable feature is the mouth-feel. Smooth & rich but disporportionate to the flavors which are quite subdued. Overall a nice bevvie that could become a fav."
""
"The taste focuses on the malts more than anything else.  Fairly sweet. Mild bitterness.  Not bad in the whole scheme of things."

"Lotsomalt! A touch of whisky?  Something warms the stomach.  Hops are nonexistent,  but that's ok. Good fall brew."
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice fall seasonal, just what you'd expect.  It's good for those cool nights watching football.  A little sweeter than most fall beers, and not quite an Oktoberfest, but close."
""
""
"Good beer not great"
""
""
""
"Well, this is pretty lackluster. It's a good beer, but rather boring. The label is the best thing about it. Also, the color is a really deep brown, which was intriguing. However, the taste was rather lacking; almost watery. Sweet malt was dominant. I wouldn't get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Darker than I thought.  But enjoyable to drink near the start of fall.  Needed a balance for our other tap and this works.  A darker ale"
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and while I didn't think this was really that true to style for an Old Ale it seemed more in line with a Brown Ale or Altbier, but either way it lived up to being a fitting a beer for the season.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, creamy, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention. I could see myself drinking a couple of these and I think it would make for a nice beer to bring to a bonfire.  What I like the most about this beer was the nutty aspect, it really worked well with the malty flavors and it showed up at just the right amount.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change.  I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes an easy drinking beer that's malty and nutty.  All in all I was happy with this beer , it being classified as an Old Ale on here is a little confusing, but once I looked past that I was left with a nice fall time beer.  This is one of the better beers that I've had from this Brewery and It's one of the better Fall seasonal s that I've had this year.  Good job guys, I enjoyed this beer, keep up the solid work."
"deep golden color with great head a ok lacing. Smells malty. Taste is sweet malt with a hint of caramel. Carbonation and mouthfell is decent and this beer overall is rather light. A good drinker for the summer especially !!!"
""
""
""
""
"Soft, subtle nose of roasted malt, bordering on hints of light coffee.  Molasses and dark caramels in the taste, followed by hops reminiscent of dried leaves.  Hints of milk chocolate nibs in the finish.  Nothing complex or distinctive, it's a pleasant brew for the falling temps of the season."
""

""

""

"O: OK; a little one note, but what's there is good:"
"I was impressed with the deep rich hue of brown and burgundy. It looks like an Old Ale. The nose holds some dry chocolate, barley malt, raisin and toasted nut. The flavor is barley, toasted nut, dry chocolate, some dried fruit but without sweetness. This is very dry but easily approachable. Breckenridge products seem to have great attributes but are never particularly assertive and this is no exception."

"Breckenridge Autumn Ale -----3.5/5"
"Not your average seasonal. Pours a very dark brown with a tan head. Smells of chocolate and coffee, almost stout like. The taste was very rich with hints of coffee and dark chocolate but also a toasted nuttiness to it. Very enjoyable. A little thick to the point where you might only be good with two per sitting but still a very delicious beer."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, best before 11/11/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a small fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, raisin, plum, pear, biscuit, toast, chocolate, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, brown sugar, raisin, plum, pear, biscuit, toast, light chocolate, herbal, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, plum, raisin, pear, biscuit, toast, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Minimal carbonation and medium bodied; with a very slick, moderately creamy, and fairly bready mouthfeel that is ok. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a decent old ale. Good balance and robustness of malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and smooth to sip on for the abv. Could use more carbonation. Pleasantly enjoyable."

"O: An odd beer. Definitely not an Old Ale, as it is labeled on this site. I'd say it's more of a German-influenced brown, caught somewhere between ale and lager.A little different maybe, but not very thought provoking or memorable."
"It's alright and very drinkable, but still not going on my favorites list."
"O - I bought this beer at random and didn't really know what to expect. Its a dark, thick, malty beer. If you like that style, you will probably like this one. I'm not a huge fan of dark malty beers but I'll drink them occasionally. I doubt if I'll go back to this one in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is medium with a firm crispness that runs all the way through and a really steady smoothness playing off it it. It's pretty steadily semi-dry, more so in the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Interesting style. Might go well with a dark wrap cigar."
"Autumn Ale pours a dark brownish color with a small white lacing head. There is a rich malty and caramel aroma. The taste has a nice rich malty backbone, nice mellow caramel flavors, with some oakey flavors. Good full flavors, but very weak carbonation, and flat feeling. Overall its a good nicely flavored old ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: There is a very solid, very surprising beer. Like I stated above, it’s more like a winter porter than an autumn harvest/fest beer. Good flavors of roasted malt, smokiness and caramel sweetness. Solid beer."
"Pours very dark brown, bordering on black. No foam, none. Malty nose, with caramel. Sweet overwrapping taste, some pine. Low carebonation, almost syrup-like. Bready. Not sure what makes this for autumn, So-so,."
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely will drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Not really the best harvest ales I have even had. The flavors never really complement each other well and the weaker body only further diminishes the impacts of the taste. Nothing too special here."

"O: So, let's call this a ""Fall Time Lawnmower Beer"". I'll imagine that I've just raked a ton of leaves. I'm a bit tired. A bit sweaty. Good. I like this fine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good is somewhat mundane old ale. Malt flavors and feel are the highlights and should appeal to lovers of malt-centric flavored beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor of dark malt, but smooth rather than roasted and bitter. Hints of cocoa and caramel, some smoke and leather, hints of marshmallow, and a subtle vanilla-oakey finish. Rich and multi-faceted flavors. Smooth and round mouthfeel, not overly full. Very enjoyable beer."

"The taste is also malty but also with some hops taste. It is a nicely balanced taste. The finish is sweet and pleasant. Overall, this is an interesting, unique variant of the style. I like it and would buy it again if I were looking for a dark change of pace."
""
"Really good beer. I'd love to have this fresh off the tap."
""
""
""
""
"Overall i really like having this as opposed to other beers refered to as fall seasonals and ""autumn ales"". If i was to compare it to the better old ales it wouldnt score so high, but nothing about it is bad. Its just a very drinkable old ale....a bolder, satisfying ""fall beer"" if you will. I'll pick this up every year."

"Overall a full bodied, well balanced autumn brew that in my opinion hit all the high points of this style. Not the most complex brew, but nonetheless enjoyable."
""
"Overall the beer is good, but nothing that made me jump up and down with joy. It's the perfect kind of fall beer because it's not too spicy or malty. Any average beer drinker would find this somewhat enjoyable."

"O: A solid fall seasonal from Breckenridge very drinkable even at 6.7% ."
""
"Pours a dark brown with a very thin head. Not much retention, and no lacing. Aroma is brown sugar, and maple syrup. Body is thin and mildly carbonated. Taste is of sugary spice, and malts. A bit watered down. Weak version of this style. Not impressed."
"I actually applaud the American brewers who put out Autumn beers instead of Oktoberfests. This one pours a clear ruby-sienna topped by a finger of sandy khaki foam. The nose comprises maple syrup, brown sugar, honey, dry biscuit, and cinnamon. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light caramel and some very light toasted rye bread. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It's not all that complex, really, but the simplicity is well-executed."
""
""
"Autumn Ale pours out a very dark brown with a beautiful clarity. The aroma is chocolatey and malty, with a touch of spicing. On the tongue, a full and wonderful roasty flavor quickly envelops the mouth. There's some bitter chocolate and a bit of fall spicing in here too. Full-flavored while not being overwhelming, it smoothly fades out a little while after the sip. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and fairly smooth, and the drinkability is great. Overall, this is an excellent beer that does a great job of balancing drinkability and flavor. I wish we had seasons here in Florida, because I'd love to kick back with this on a cool Autumn night on my deck back in New Jersey."
""
""
"Pours a nice dark brown with very minimal head and no lacing. Very light malt aroma.Has a very light chocolate taste with some brown sugar tossed in the mix. Has just enough carbonation without being a detraction in the mouthfeel department. A very easy drinking beer that could go down to quickly and that is it's biggest problem. It disappears before you realize it. Nothing that makes it standout from most other ales but a solid go to choice anyway."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this a great fall seasonal beer for me just as the weather is getting a bit chilly. It's like a mild Old Ale or a Scottish ale flavor profile and the less than 7% ABV makes it okay to have more than one without hitting the floor like many other Scottish/Old Ales. It's a nice, easy drinking malty beer that is also pleasantly light and semi-freshing."
""
"Notes: Solid and nicely drinkable. Cheers."
""
""
""
"I'd love to try this on tap. Would be nice with pulled pork or baby back ribs. Could also be a nice offset to spicy dishes that are meat heavy: think spicy meat pizza."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid beer to drink for a while."
""
""
"o - love me a good brown ale, and as such i can get picky on the style and this one didn't do it for me. the autumn seasoning on the tail end was a nice touch, but overall this one is a bit average for me."
""
"O: This beer is nice and malty but still quite easy to drink with its lighter bodied; however, it tastes like it is a little one dimensional and could use a little hops."
""
""
"O - An excellent brown ale in its own right."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very drinkable brown with a firm bitterness and pleasing roast malt character."
"O: A good beer, but I wouldn't classify it as an American Brown... English brown, English mild, or Old ale all sound better to me.... Regardless, enjoyable and fits the season nicely. Easy to drink, and free of all the spices and pumpkins that you see in a lot of the fall seasonals lately"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Perhaps I had a bad bottle, but this beer was basically flat. The taste was fine but not something I expected from a fall seasonal. Not something I'd buy again."
""
""
""
"O- a solid choice for a fall brew, goes great with the opening weekend of college football!"

"This beer goes with a roast beef sandwich. While it is enjoyable as a day-to-day beer, there is nothing special. I certainly do not recognize this as an “Old Ale”."

"TASTE: Malty sweet, toasted biscuit, herbal, semidry, brown bread, dried fruit"
"Morey's Bottom Line: Even though there's plenty around, I don't drink many Breckenridge beers. Too pricy for the quality inside IMO. That being said, this is a pretty decent fall beer. I could imagine sipping on this after rakin' just like the bottle says it's good for. Cheers!"
"D: A nice beer to try for a autumn seasonal especially if you are tired of pumpkin or spices in other autumn seasonals. It goes down easy and is refreshing and interesting enough on the palate to have a few and not be bored."
""

" The taste is lightly caramel in the front with a toasted malt and nice fruity yeast flavor with somewhat bready flavor and mild spice w/ a gentle earthy sweet dried fruit taste like cherry with a mild hint of hops which are in the background with a gentle bran cereal quality with slight dry herbal tinge in the finish. Overall this brown is a quality dark ale with plenty of drinkability and subtle dry maltiness yeast breadiness that is very pleasant. This is a beer I would get again for the fact it is well brewed clean and doesn't taste sweet even though it is malt dominated."
""
"D - Not awful, but I'd pass on this one in the future. Bland and not exciting."
""
""
"Low C"
"D: IMO – they nailed the name on this one. Very much one for unwinding – an after yard work sit down and relax brew. A nice fall beer. The O’fest come on in the marketing is a bit of a stretch, but this is a good beer. Rich and robust, and big enough to carry it off without being weighty. It is a bit sweet to want more than one right away, but that is alright as the abv is starting to get up there a bit."
"Pours a dark brown hue with a thin tan head that has good retention and lacing. Get some caramel, licorice, and molasses in the aroma. the taste starts out with some dark fruits, caramel, molasses followed by some licorice, hops and a nutty taste in the back. Very tasty and yummy. A rather easy drinking beer that is rather light for a dark beer, but has a nice creamy finish that makes you want more. A rather enjoyable brown ale that has a slightly different taste than most brown ales."
"Breckenridge Autumn Ale is a dim brown ale with a light khaki head that fades to a film. It has a resiny aroma with a slight note of molasses. It's very wooden and a little roasty. It's pretty light bodied; kind of watery but the finish is kind of creamy. There is a lot of resiny malt in the taste, but it never gets sweet. Dark bread crust, medicine and maybe even licorice are in there. The aftertaste is pretty long and pretty bitter. Wow, this is like a light version of an imperial stout. What is this, a brown ale? Whatever it is, I like it."
""
""
""

"Overall, a good beer to pair with foods. I had the first few of the six pack alone then realized it was better with barbecue. However, the best combo was with pumpkin pie. The cinnamon clove goodness meshes perfectly with this beer. Blew my mind. Makes me wonder if just adding some spices in the brewing process could make a killer brew."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: Solid brown."
"There could have been a bit less alcohol in this but it wasn't that detectable and on a nice fall day, I could see myself having more than one in a sitting. Like the other Breckenridge beers that I've had, this isn't award-winning but instead, is highly drinkable and a good example of it's particular style. This is a welcome change from the other Fall beers that seem alike after a while!"
"Body-Moderately rich and creamy, sort of heavy but not excessive, enough effervescence, not too bad, actually a bite from it. Slightly dry finish. This is not really good, but it isn’t bad either. It lacks complexity but it has decent drinkability. Definitely not a session beer but it hides its’ alcohol pretty well. Also holds the effervescence fairly well. Not a fan of it for the price point is all."
"full bodied and delicious this dark brown ale pours a sturdy black color with almost no head. nose as dark roast coffee, candied sugars, mild alcohol, and fall leaves. quick crisp finish and a big bad body, this is perfect for the season. the lack of carbonation doesn't hurt it, as this beer gets better and better as it warms, mellowing out with a little alcohol tinge at the end. not a typical brown ale, definitely not a porter, this autumn ale is a great evening sipper. one of the better breck brews"
"The beer pours a deep,amber color, and settles fast with minimal foam and lace. The aroma is a bit of smoky wood and malty hops. The beer settles with just the right amount of carbonation and leaves a nice aftertaste in the mouth. Breckenridge is surely becoming one of the best American breweries."
"Overall – very good and interesting brew!"
"O: I enjoyed this. Rich and tasty. It's drinking very well on an October day with football on the tv."
"Pours a dark brown with a nice off white head that sticks around. The smell is mostly malty with some subtle smokiness, could be some sweet notes as well. The flavor starts with the smoke, and then the malt dominates throughout. The finish is somewhat harsh on the palette, the malt and a subtle sweet sticks around through the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a medium light, this could have a better mouthfeel, a bit thin. Overall an enjoyable beer, good flavor, a few improvements would make this one a much better beer."
"Overall, nothing spectacular, but it is something non-offensive that could be used to help bridge the gap from mainstream beers."
"O - A bit too watery and carbonated. Smell and taste is a bit muddled. Nothing remarkable about this one."
"Dark brown with mahogany highlights, good cap of khaki froth, little lacing. Scent is dominated by heavy, lightly sweet caramel with notes of grassy and earthy hops, light metallic off note. Taste is heavy on the malts, mostly caramel, some nutty and bready notes, hops in check as their earthiness is only present in flashes, again with a lightly metallic and earthy mud taste. Medium bodied, slightly over carbonated. Did not impress with muddled nose and flavor components."
"This pours a very dark brown, almost a black color with an okay tan head which quickly goes away. The smells are of mostly malts, not getting the hops. The feel is somewhat light and watery. The taste is okay, a little bit of the malts, some coffee and some nuts and grain, but overall its a little thin and slightly disappointing, it sure looked pretty good though."
"Overall I got this expecting just another Oktoberfest but got a very smooth brown ale with toasted nut flavors. Not a bad beer at all."
"With almost every Breck beer I've had I just wish it was stronger, bigger. Stronger nose/more diverse flavors/more forward flavors would make these beers much more memorable. This beer fits this impression as well. Too bad."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, hops, hint of pale malt, and a slight caramel malt. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hops, hint of roasted malt, and a hint of caramel malt. Overall, a good, session-able brown."
"Just feels a it watered down or something compared to most good Brown Ales. The flavors are there but it doesn't balance out to something I would really buy again."
"Malty and lightly sweet, finishing somewhat dry. Toasty with a bit of malt complexity, little to no bitterness. Fairly straightforward and tasty, though the body is a little thin, supporting the Munich Dunkel theory. Ok, would drink again. Not reinventing the wheel, but not every beer needs to."
"What ever it is its perfect for the fall."
"Overall - I purchased this in a mixed sixer, setting out on a search to find a good autumn beer. With so many pumpkin offerings and obnoxious orange labels, it can be overwhelming. This, though, is a good start. While perhaps not the best out there, it’s a very calm beer. It’s in no way gimmicky, nor is it reaching for a style outside the brewery’s comfort zone. A solid beer."
"Another pretty average beer from Breckenridge. I keep hoping one of their beers will hit the spot, but really I haven't found one yet with the possible exception of the 471 IPA. This one pours a very dark brown, but with just the faintest head. Fairly roasty in the nose with a hint of cocoa powder, and some gentle malt. A little thin in flavor, especially upfront, but the finish delivers some more of that same moderate roastiness and dusty cocoa. Not a lot of depth, but pleasant enough, I guess. Also relatively gentle in the mouth with a soft finish. Certainly drinkable, but not moreish."
"Pours a deep, garnet-brown. Tan head, looks nice. Smell is a smooth, malty excursion. Taste holds less promise. Roasted, but the malt falls & feels way too flat. The hops are almost an afterthought, laying low on the back end. Finishes watery. But a looker.."
"O- Breckenridge Brewery is definitely hit or miss with me. This was definitely a miss"
"The appearance of this beer is amazing. It is a dark red/brown with a slight creamier head. I smell roastedness and not much else. The taste is watery at first. The beer is easy to drink and has a slight hoppiness on the finish. Over all this is a good fall beer, but not the best Breckenridge has done."
"D-Very easy drinking beer, but I wish the mouthfeel had a little more depth. I think that slight change would make this a go-to seasonal for me."
"Rich coffee on the palate. A bit of a metallic tinge. Heavy malt with some nutty tones. Interesting mouthfeel. Thinnish in the body and lightly carbonated."
"Overall, a really nice sipper on a crisp autumn evening, yet very drinkable so that you can have a few and not be overwhelmed. I like the vanilla-oak notes I get in the body. Definitely a good brew to have after rakin', as the bottle suggests."
"i could see drinking this later in the season, as the weather cools; but i might as well just go for a stout.."
"O: Very 4.0 in my book. Nicely done, the first old ale I've tried, and I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"The beer felt lighter/thinner than expected. The beer was smooth, had good carbonation to it and was pretty easy to drink. Overall, not a bad beer, but one that I will probably only buy on limited occasions."
"A decent beer, kinda half way between a porter and a brown ale. Only complaint is alcohol is too in your face. I would drink this again if offered but wouldn't seek it out."
"Notes: Definitely not an Old Ale, or at least not like any I have had. English Brown/Marzen with a slight Porter like flavor. Not a bad beer, but overall I see it as kind of a meh beer. Easy to forget and nothing worth seeking out, but for the right price definitely worth a try."
"I first tried this beer at a local liquor store's beer tasting. It was by far the best malt/fall seasonal beer there. I am finally drinking the final beer in the sixer and I have not become board with the flavor whatsoever. This is a great example of a fall seasonal for the relaxed craft drinker."
"12oz bottle into a standard pint glass pours a deep dark brown with a thin diminishing head that leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight dark malts and caramel. The taste is a nice amount of smooth dark malts, burnt caramel and a hint of cocoa. The beer is medium bodied with mild carbonation. This is a very smooth and easy drinking with well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable Autumn beer, I may need to pick up a few six packs of this while I still can."
"Overall: Not what I was expecting but still good. A relaxed, enjoyable beer."
"Taste-Toasted malt and caramel, faint hop bite. Rather flat and thin-bodied. Expecting a little more robust flavor. A bit of a letdown overall."
"D: This is a highly drinkable brew, for the style and the ABV this brew goes down very easy"
"This beer pours a very dark almost black color. Much darker than I'd expect for an autumn or Octoberfest. It has a rich cream colored head which quickly moves to a thin layer. There is some lacing on the glass for some time although not in traditional layers with each drink. This is a pretty drinkable beer and is more like a brown ale than anything else."
"Pours a deep amber to brown-ish color with a off white head. In the aroma, small roast and earthy notes. In the taste, dry, roasty coffee, and small hints of earth. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry coffee aftertaste. Nice coffee like presence, somewhere between a porter and oktoberfest."
"D - One of Breckenridge's better beers, this is a very nice fall beverage with solid drinkablity even for it's rich mouthfeel."
"Drinkabillity: Flavor shines as it warms & doesn't linger too long. Good fall offering."
"D: This is a nice autumn offering overall and one of the better Breckenridge beers I've had."
"Drinkability: I am a fan of this beer, although I probably wouldn't session it. Worth a try."
"Smooth and mildly medium bodied. The carbonation is very thin which adds to the silky feel and doesn't distract from the flavors. Not a bad beer just simple and tasty. Could it be bigger? Sure but this is a solid session beer that is a step in the right direction."
"Taste follows suit with the nose for the most part, but there is a very nice, notable smoke flavor that really helps out the complexity of the beer. Carbonation is low and the alcohol level feels nowhere near 6.7%. It is not what one expects when cracking open an olde ale, but this is a really tasty beer that I will surely buy a sixer or more of next year. Surprisingly delicious and very smooth. Good job Breck!"
"A deep dark brown color pour with a small offwhite head , leaving a ring of lace ,medium carbonation . Aroma is very toasty and nutty with hints of molasses and brown shugger , and just a whiff of alcohol but in a pleasent way . Flavor is of malty toasted nuts and grain ,powdered baking chocolate , rasins and spicy hops , a nice little hoppy finish with faint notes of coffee at times . Medium body with a creamy smooth mouthfeel for being so malty. Very drinkable and good , a nice try."
"Flavor is powerful and rich, with a fruity overtone, and a slight alcohol tinge somewhere in there. Quite delicious!"
"The Flavor is pretty solid, a bit spicy and pretty sweet, with the obvious carmel malts dominating, with brown sugar and molasses notes revealing itself. Not the most complex beer, but a good beer that's easy to drink and lets you have multiple beers in a night easily. Well worth the $4 i got the pack for. :)"
"Haven't been too impressed with Breckenridge, this one doesn't help."
"D: Nothing wrong with this brew. Great fall beer but can't say I'd have it again."
"Clear dark brown with an extra creamy beige head that leaves plenty of lace behind on the glass. The nose is chicory, cocoa and anise with just a whiff of honey. Dark roasted malty flavors of chocolate and black licorice with mild caramel sweetness and mild bitterness make for an interesting beer that is more porter than old ale to my taste buds. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. A good beer to wash down some BBQ ribs."
"D - A bit too rich for me to drink more than a couple. But it's an interesting beer."
"D- I thought this one would do better as it warmed, but it did only slightly."
"Feel and Drinkability: Meidum body with medium to medium high levels of fine carbonation. Immediate finish isn't dry, but after a min or two the mouth is fairly dry, the smokiness and roasty toasty notes settling in contributing to a drying effect. This is one I can see myself definitely buying again. A good beer and something that would definitely hit the spot as it gets cooler outside. I'll mostly likely pick up a sixer of this later this year."
"Drinkability: This tastes like a brown ale with a big dose of spices. A very good beer. I could have three or so."
"I wasn't expecting this style for an autumn brew. It was a nice surprise though. I am still confused about the style as others have mentioned. Good beer nonetheless."
"Drinkability: Good enough at best, for a beer, but never once did it make me think, ""Oh! Now, there's a taste of the Autumn!"" There's a taste of something, alright, but not a taste of Autumn."
"EDIT: Still trying to figure out how this is an old ale..."
"An enjoyable fall treat, pick some up."
"Drinkability: A little change of pace from the lighter marzen styles for the fall seasonal beer styles. Probably will drink it again."
"Good Beer, I enjoyed it and could defintely see myself drinking this brew as the days turn colder and shorter."
"Tastes light-caramel, iron metallic, a touch of scorch, and very gentle alcohol sting. Fruity esters of prune, pear, and dried-blueberry. Modest sweetness dries in the end and leaves a woody sticky in the mouth. Flavors are modest in intensity and sweet does not cloy, as can often occur in a beer with these flavors. Md-light body and modest carbonation. Decent drinkability. Scored as an old ale, which is *clearly* not the appropriate style for this to be classified here on BA."
"D - Oh its drinkable."
"D: Pretty good on a cooler evening, but a little too malty for my tastes. An honest, but otherwise, unexciting beer."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a dimpled mug. The ale appears a clear dark amber color with about a finger of quickly fading off white foam. Average looking. Nose and flavor are of lightly toasted earthy grains, mild caramel, slightly nutty, some chocolate, a bit spicy. An old ale shouldn't have such a thin body. Not too sure I'll be looking forward to this one again come fall."
"I have had this one before and this time it didn't seem nearly as good as I remember it. Pours a medium to light brown-ish color with a light sandy head that faded fairly fast. Smelled nutty, roasty. Tasted nutty with some carmel or toffee in there. Mouth feel was medium fairly watery end. decent beer but I probably won't buy it again."
"Appears a dark caramel cola colored body with a rich forming tan head flows thick with a nice lace that sticks to the glass evenly with much intricacy. Aromatics offer up somewhat mint like edge black licorice chocolate with spiced bread dough blends of this seasons offerings. Flavor has yeast driven mild chocolate with herbal qualities that result in sweet cloying tones at times, with fruit accents and mineral water hardness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some prickly carbonation, definitely soothing on the palate. Drinkability does me alright with festive qualities of a winter warmer/old ale this one hits early in the fall not bad at all that bad and even a nice mix up from the typical O fest of the season."
"Drinkability: This is a fairly subjective score. It is always kind of an ""overall impression", however I'm going to hold myself to the principal of,"do you want another?"" Well, in this situation the answer would be no..."
"This isn't the best of old ales, or much of an old ale at all really, but it's a solid beer from a solid brewery. Thanks again for another great box with plenty of new beer Bill!"
"D- gaining a recent HUGE respect for oktoberfest beer, i could hardly appreciate this as a 'fresh take' on the style. as an old ale, it is to me undoubtedly american, a nice flavorful beer, just lacking that authentic taste that really makes a quality english ale, as that is clearly what this one lays its foundation upon. munich malts and one noble hop if you will, but this is no more an oktoberfest than the milk i dunk my cookies in."
"Quite drinkable for a heavier ale though it is not really that heavy."
"I just didn't enjoy this one that much. There just wasn't much going on with the flavor that I enjoyed."
"Bottom line: It's worth a try but it's not something that exactly grabs your attention."
"Overall this was an ok brew. The bottle reads ""After Rankin' Autumn Ale."" Doesn't really have a refreshing quality...more of a warming quality. A nice change from some of the fall brews."
"Deep dark brown that is translucent to opaque with ruby highlights that holds a tan ecru head that sticks around with sticky lacing. Nose is molasses and chocolate malt with a subtle nuttiness. Taste is a bit complex of toasted almonds and dark fruits like sugar plums and raisins which yields an alcohol warmth and low carbonation perfect for cozy, crisp evenings. I suggest this brew as a digestive - don't let this beer be the only one for the evening as it is not sessional, leaving lackluster and wanting to quaff something less heavy."
"Drinkabity is decent but nothing special."
"Overall, not terribly interesting, but an enjoyable brew."
"D- It's a pretty decent drinker THe full flavor may lend itself to being more of a late fall sipper in the cooler weather."
"Overall this was an alright beer but I won't be buying it again anytime soon."
"A drinkable beer. I'm not super-impressed by it, but it's good. The taste is such that one would be able to have a couple or even a few in a sitting."
"D: I felt very eh when it came to this brew. I can't say I enjoyed it much at all."
"Not sure I could drink more than one of these. I'll make it through this six pack, but I don't believe I'll buy it again."
"EDIT: I'm finding that this seems to be a little bit like an Oktoberfest and a strong/old ale blended together. The rating here is nothing special, but I really do think it's pretty good stuff and it's become a seasonal favorite for me."
"Drinkability is poor for me. I had to pour out this beer without finishing it - I can't tolerate drinking something that tastes like coffee grounds - and wouldn't order this beer again unless it changed majorly. Overall - not a beer I wish to try again."
"D-Eh, this beer is good but I need to move on."
"Finish is somewhat short. Although this beer is a notch down in flavor components compared to a winter ale, it is significantly more drinkable. Very satisfying."
"Before trying I assumed this would be an Oktoberfest, but smelled and tasted quite different. Poured black with a light tan head. Smell was a tart roasty maltiness, with slight smoky, almost peaty qualities to it. Taste is dark roastiness, tartness, a bit biscuity. Lightly carbonated, and a touch creamy, and while not bad, the peaty quality is not my favorite."
"Drinkability - I think the sweetness would get to me after a few, but for a fireside accompaniment this would be spiffy."
"Deep, dark brown in color with about half a finger of brown head. Smell is smoky with some chocolate and toast. Maybe a little coffee too, but not much. Flavorful with a nice, smoky, earthy taste. Also some chocolate and brown sugar. Not heavily carbonated, with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. This is a pretty nice beer. Nothing too exceptional, but a nice solid beer."
"This beer has some body, pretty thick really and quite filling. Not something I would go right back to but I think it could get more interesting 6 months down the road."
"Decent mouthfeel."
"D - Ok beer. Nothing special. I would drink this again but wouldn't buy it again."
"I don't know what's old ale-like about this, it doesn't have the big sweetness and there's a touch of roasted grains. It's not a bad beer, but I find it bland. The undercarbonation doesn't help, but what are you going to do? At least it goes down easy. Out of the winter beers, I'd call this one nice, but forgetable."
"Dark brown color, with a short tan head. Coating layers of lace with good foam stability. Aromas of caramel and toasted malt, a bit nutty and grainy. Very tastey, higher alcohol is hidden well. Touch of smoke along with the maltiness works well. Smooth, lightly carbonated, not too fizzy or foamy. Happy to have tried this one, but would try something different next time."
"Drinks pretty good, but make me think coffee stout, not old ale, so I have to knock it down for taste"
"Deep, mahogany color with chocolatey-brown head. Sharp aroma of coffee and toasted malts also comes through in taste, along with rye and grapes. Strong alcoholic character of a Scotch Ale, shared with the dark complexity of a Winter Warmer. Nice, robust late fall offering for when the early fall crispness of Octoberfests give way."
"Initial flavor is dominated by roasted and caramelized malts. The finish is the best part, hints of smoke and dark dried fruit give this average beer an interesting finish. Overall a decent beer, but nothing to get excited about."
"The drinkability is OK, I'm not impressed enough to buy more but not a bad beer either. MK"
"Absolutely not a marzen, rather has a rich chocolate, malty taste."
"The beer pours a clear deep brown with serious dark ruby highlights, head forms a decent creamy light tan crown to top off the body, lacing thin but secure in its coverage of the glass. Nose has a malt sweet aroma, supported by the caramel, also a tiny bit of hops pokes through, front ambrosial, with a touch of hop bitterness at the back, top is light to medium in feel. Finish has a lenient acidity, the hops apparent, but not over powering, sweet dry aftertaste lingers long on the palate, a nice looking, aromatic and drinkable beer, over the past few years Breckenridge has improved its quality immensely."
"This one is all malt. It's an okay beer, I feel the flavor was a little lacking and it seemed watery. Nothing was really off about the beer, so I don't think it should be avoided. It's worth a try at least."
"A decent beer, I'd give it a try."
"I got a beautiful pour from this beer, resulting in two fingers of thick, light-tan head. The color was a deep, cola-brown with lovely garnet highlights. The nose had a big malty-sweet presence. The mouthfeel was medium to full and I got a really unexpected smokiness on the tongue. The finish had a slightly sharp quality, followed by a return of that smoky flavor. I just wish that the weather was not so warm because this would be perfect on a more typical autumn day."
"This beer is decent, but could benefit from thicker malting."
"Overall Impression: Meh. Pretty mild, flavors lend themselves towards funky; earthy, leafy, roasted. I was thinking Schwarzbier more than Old Ale. There is a light tannin character that seems to relate to dried leaves, so points for seasonal character. Still; its not a terribly tasty beer. Pass."
"Old ales are probably my least favorite style. This ones a pretty good example, but personally it just didnt do much for me."
"Breckenridge Autumn Ale was a deep mahogany color. It had a medium sized beige head with decent retention and some spotty lacing left behind. The aroma was sweet toasty caramel malt. The taste was toasty and malty as well with some roasted and fruity flavors coming through in the dry finish. It was medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkabily was above average. It was a decent fall seasonal and worth a try."
"I guess I'm way outside the average on this one, but I really like this beer. I loved the burned-toast and espresso flavors. My advice would be to drink this above cellar temperature, at least 50 or 55 degrees."
"Has the recipe completely changed in 2007? This beer used to be a malty, toasty, nutty treat when fall rolled around. I thought it might be a bad batch, but I see other people noting the same flavors."
"D: Roasty, but not too roasty for me to drink only a one or two. I expected more hop flavor, but was pleasantly surprised. It's a nice beer. Almost a porter."
"Cheers!"
"D: My first old ale and I was a bit dissapointed, but to be fair I was not expecting much and so the beer took me a bit by suprise, which had its ups and its downs, mostly downs, but still drinkable in any case."
"Overall this a good fall seasonal. I think its off the mark for an old ale. Nonetheless its quite a tasty little beer, regardless of the style."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, semi-sweet of toffee, along with a nutty, grainy, mildly bitter finish."
"So, is Autumn-Warmer going to be an upcomming catagory? It's not quite a harvest ale because of the moderate hopping (not highly hopped). Not quite a winter warmer (not spicy or the right season). What the beer is, is a really nice non-Oktoberfest Fall-type beer. Quite reminescent of Scottish ales, but light on the peat-smoked malts, but on target with the deep malt profile, toffee / cocoa hints, and moderately high malty texture. Medium hops certainly off-set the sweetness, while adding a mild grassy, piney flavor. Fermentation spices and lactose-like sweetness add character and smoothness. Lingers with a hint of toasty sweetness and hop bittering. Another high quality, well balanced brew from Breckenridge."
"A good Autumn beer."
"Breckenridge Autumn Ale has failed to warm my body (a minimum of 8% is required for that) and it certainly hasn't warmed my soul. It doesn't remind me of Autumn and it isn't much of an old ale. What's left? A crazy patchwork of a beer that doesn't fit comfortably into any one style, but that is, nevertheless, drinkable in a 'low expectations' kind of way. A better old ale shouldn't be that hard to come by."
"This is my first experience with an old ale, and if this is any indication of what the style is supposed to be like....sign me up for more of this!"
"This is a pretty decent beer. I personally prefer the likes of Avery's Old Jubilation when drinking this class of beer. I would drink this beer again, but there really isn't all that much to set it apart."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer. I've only had one other Old Ale so I have little to compare it to, but it is quite nice."
"Yep, checked their webpage ; thats what I had  I would recommend this in a hearbeat. Very nice fall/winter warmer. Id luv to have a couple more."
"There is a lighter note in body with some wispy flavors. Very light for an old ale but good overall. Really feels like a light porter but still good, no matter what the season is."
"Pours a dark mahogany brown with some deep amber highlights. Large amounts of dirty tan head are formed and have no trouble keeping up. Aromas of slightly roasty malts, spices, light floral hops, and malty sweetness abound. Body is kinda weird as the carbonation is low but it finishes rather dry. Flavor is remeniscent of most winter ales with a medium brown type roastiness and some spicy finish. It is certainly easily drinkable, but I'm not sure I would be interested in several, where it would get dull quickly. Look forward to trying this when the cooler weather hits."
"A Leaf Rakin Autumnal Thanks to BigHuge for this easy going Seasonal Ale."
"D - Very drinkable. Not one to ponder over, but very enjoyable in its own way. Kudos to Breck for trying something different than the usual Oktoberfest seasonal brews. A nice transition into winter."
"Whatever the case this is the type of beer that will short if you sit and analyze the hell out of it but if you just drink it and enjoy it you will love it."
"Deep burgandy tone. Thin beige head. Lace is sparse, but overall, the appearance is good. On the nose: Nice toasted malts, nuttiness and caramel character. Nice. The palate continues this theme. The flavor is nutty, pretty thick with malts, bready and sweet. Almost like a bock in nature, but not exactly. Good nonetheless. The body is full and rournded. Pretty much everything about this beer is good."
"i'd label it a ""Late Autumn Ale."" very late."
"Put short, a nice transitional ale, as we regrettably leave summer behind and embrace richer, darker tastes, ....it's already chilly out, and October looms overhead. This is a nice, easy drinking ale, and very welcome in my glass."
"I'm not a huge fan of the true Oktoberfest style, but that doesn't stop me from buying all that is available each year. It just seems like the right thing to do. Although this is not labeled as Oktoberfest, I was expecting it to be. As soon as I poured it, though, I knew it wasn't. Deep, dark mahogany color and commanding malt aroma. I love the uniqueness of this brew, with slightly sweet caramel notes balanced with toasted nut flavors. Hops hide in the background for the most part. I'm surprised at some of the tough reviews on this one; I think it makes for a remarkable transition to the forthcoming winter season."
"Sure is a healthy color, dark brown and as dark as a Guinness pub can (not that's a huge thing these days). One quarter inch head starts to fade in less than a minute. Spread-out punctuation mark laces. Mainly malty aroma, cinnamon toast seems to be most predominant. Mouthfeel strays, not thin but almost soupy or like a thin stew, with lower carbonation. The flavor profile rings mostly malt (not much to pick out in hops), but its muddled and dishwater-like with initial molasses but also with cardboard back tastes that don't work for me. Solid enough to hold on to this profile without any fade, it doesn't go anywhere that nice or interesting however. What's there is tepid (especially for a brew that could be classed as an Old Ale) and not that good tasting, at least IMO..."
"What kind of beer is this wacky stuff? Old Ale? Sure. Dark maroon colored body, you can only see through at the bottom of the glass. Head is off-white, small off the pour, and fades to a small film of foam. Head is dark roasty malts, slight acidity. Taste is relatively bland, like a watered down, underpowered porter in most respects. Undercarbonated body, very thin. This beer was off in almost every respect, although I am appreciateive of the effort from Breckenridge to try something new."
"Pours a deep, reddish brown color with a relatively average, light tan head. Leaves spotty lacing on the glass, at best. Smell is rather strong and of roasted grains, chocolate, and fruit. The taste is a bit off. Astringent tastes up-front of raisins, cranberries, and assorted fruits...roasted chocolately malts in the finish. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation..relatively smooth also. Very drinkable and at nearly 7% abv, this could catch up on you pretty quick. Overall, it's a fall seasonal that's worth a try, but nothing to get too excited about."
"Hazy dark reddish brown color with a small off white head that doesn't last long, not much lacing either. Rotten vegatable herbal aromas, some chocolate caramel flavors a bit on the bland side, medium bodied with a kind of watery mouthfeel, finishes clean and dry. I won't be buying this one again."
"On tap at the brewpub. Crystal clear deep garnet hue. Thin, but persistent light beige head leaves sparse lace. Softly toasted malt with subtle hints of roasted grain, bolstered by a sweet, dark toffee undertone in aroma. Slightly raisin like, dark lovibond caramel dominates the flavor profile, due to the meager hop bitterness. Understated herbal hop flavor. Very clean, surprisingly lager like crispness allows Munich malt to add a sweetly toasty contrast. Mellow hints of roasted nutty melanoidins. A touch thin in body, and lacks sufficient dextrins and viscosity to support the overall malt sweetness. Finishes squeaky clean, with fading hints of sweetened biscuit. Immaculately crafted, but understated to the point of being lackluster. Somewhat dangerously quaffable."
"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. Pretty color but not much going on in the flavor. I found it neither malty nor hoppy. It was not as good as their Christmas seasonal."
"Package reviewed is a 12 oz brown glass longneck with the familiar town scene on the front label, label background is pumpkin orange.  Freshness date on rear label."
