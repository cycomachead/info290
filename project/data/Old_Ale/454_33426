The first impression of its taste is its sweetness -- almost too much -- with some maltiness and slight funk and hops. Unlike the aroma, there is no barrel aged character in the taste. The beer has a full body and light carbonation. Overall, it is a good beer but not likely one that I'd go back to often.","breakingbland","Jan 17, 2015"

3.9,7.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/30/2013. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, cherry, apple, herbal, grass, light leather, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, cherry, apple, herbal, grass, light leather, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, cherry, apple, herbal, grass, light leather, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice old ale style. All around good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 28, 2014"

It leaves a silky lacing and nice legs. The aroma is boozy, reminds me more of scotch or bourbon than beer. Notes of wood and vanilla and peat abound. The mouth is sticky and very coating. One of the thicker beers I've tried. The flavor is complex embodying many of the notes of a well made whiskey. It is very sweet at first but gives way to a pleasant depth of flavor that is warming for the body, mouth, and soul. Very nice beer. Can't wait to try more of the style.","lochef81","May 03, 2014"

The nose comprises maple syrup, toffee, mandarin orange syrup, dark leafy greens, a tiny sprig of mint, and a vein of cocoa in the background. The taste holds notes of toffee, mandarin orange syrup, light tobacco, cocoa, graham cracker, vanilla bean, brown sugar, Belgian candi sugar, and that same sprig of mint, very mild and very subtle, lodged way in the distance. The body is a straight medium, with a very light moderate carbonation, and a slightly slick feel. Overall, one of the best beers I've yet had fom Arcadia, this one wins on a number of levels.

This beer doesn't have good drinkability, its a little boozy which doesn't work well when the beer feels watered down and the flavors just don't hold my attention, one is more then enough for me, you won't catch me reaching for another. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, this beer looked damn good and had a really nice head for an Old Ale, the aroma wasn't too bad either. What I liked least about this beer was the taste and the mouthfeel, the taste was light and watery with the flavors no really doing it for me and the mouthfeel was also watery and much lighter then it should be. I won't be buying this beer again, it just didn't work for me and it was pretty expensive for what it was at $3.79 a bottle, there are much better beers to be found for that price. I can't say that I recommend this beer, if you really like Old Ales it may be worth the try, but I thought this beer was pretty run of the mill. I have never had this beer fresh so I don't know how the age has effected this beer but if the flavors were as intense as the aroma it probably wouldn't be that bad, but the flavors were much lighter letting some of the harsh off flavors show up more then they should. I just wasn't impressed with this beer, I would much rather have a Founders Curmudgeon and that beer is stronger and better priced, so far this is my least favorite Old Ale and one of my least favorite brews Arcadia, they can make some damn good beer, too bad that this wasn't one of them.","StoutHunter","Jan 05, 2012"

Y'know what I mean. Such grand statements prepare ya for something brimming with attitude in it's flavors but it almost seems that this is more talk than it is action. It's not bad though it just doesn't push it to some hearty full on floor ya type of flavorful level. Medium bodied-not too thick and not too light.

So, with this beer you have compromised sweet malts and very imbalanced hop bitterness, with an aftertaste that is just too rough in the throat. Look elsewhere.","albern","Sep 26, 2007"

2.66,-26.5,4,3,2.5,2,2.5,"I always worry about new Old Ales. The contradiction in terms usually result in young, or green, beer that shouldn't be on the market for up to a year after brewing. This beer exhibits some of these young traits, but more peculiar is a harsh wood-aged character that chases the beer from the nose to the finish. The aromas open with a partial sweet / partial twangy scent of deep molassas-type malts, dark / dried fruits, and a musty, sweaty scent that is reminescent of Belgian Artisanal Ales. The flavors bring up the malts, but are quickly swamped by an agressive wood character with high amounts of berry-like tartness, nuttiness, papery, woody, earthy flavors that prove to be too distracting for the Old Ale. The little critters that live in the wood (for aging) have made theirselves too much at home, bringing a sharp, very astringent, and thin texture to the brew; making it tough to finish. Although the astringent flavors and textures remind me of Labics or Flanders, the beer does not balance well or compensate for the harsh mouthfeel. Probably the most disappointing of the Arcadia Big Beer Series.","BEERchitect","Jul 29, 2007"

The smell is spicy/medicinal, anise, woody, perhaps some vanilla, can't quite but my finger on it. The brew has a mild grapefruit hop flavor, a dusty chocolate malt presence, a touch of wine grapes, boozy at the end. The feel is creamy, enough carbonation to make the tongue tingle, moderate body, some alcohol burn in the end. A combination of an old ale and an American strong ale. Not as blunt and over the head as a ASA but not quite as smooth as an old ale, a bit too boozy. I thought it had a good flavor range and is worth trying.","Gmann","Jul 22, 2007"

The alcohol makes its presence known. The body is medium and the drinkability is just ok. Overall a nice beer.","clvand0","Jul 18, 2007"

2.73,-24.6,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Not sure what to say here. I've tried a couple of the Arcadia Big Beers, and both have been mediocre, at best. This one pours alright. Nice brown-umber color, with a nice little finger of head on top that disappears fairly fast. Nose is oddly mild for an ASA. Some slight sourness, a hint of fruit and malt. Mouth is a big ball of sourness. Comes on really strong at the end, too, in a garbage aftertaste that gets worse as the beer warms. I guess there's some fruit, maybe malt in there too, but the sourness overwhelms pretty much everything else. Ugh. I'm okay with sour beers, when I feel that it's done deliberately and with a bit of a balancing act. It's just too much here. Beer is thin to medium bodied. I guess you could drink this, although what's the point. Just got back in town in Michigan, so I've been giving the locals a shot, but I'm kinda running out of steam with Arcadia. Think I'll stick with the Founders and Bell's instead.","soupyman10","Apr 18, 2007"

3.22,-11,3,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,"This is an odd one. Sampled from a bomber poured into a regular pint glass. Half inch head dissipates fairly quickly to a surface foam with minimal lacing (no doubt due to the elevated ABV). Color is pretty close to a classic Old Ale, deep amber/copper. Aroma is malty sweet with some fruit (raison & slight banana??) overtones upon aeration. The taste is pretty good, with malt dominating; little hop finish. Not really an Old Ale taste though, although I can't exactly peg the flavour style.The mouthfeel is surprisingly good, pretty soft carbonation. I definitely felt the ABV, so I reduced the drinkability from average. All in all, I liked this one, even though it is not a true Old Ale.","sraimondi","Beers"
3.43,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours a ruddy brown in color, slightly hazy with a small cream head that fades quickly. Aroma is sweet spices, maybe a bit of ginger, along with a good dose of cherry. A nice spiced bread aroma. Taste is quite similar with more of the cherry coming thru, a slight tartness mixes with a small amount of bitterness and a slightly dry finish. Medium to heavy in body, alcohol is evident in the finish but not extremely noticeable or overpowering. This beer pretty much threw me for a loop, I expected an old ale and felt like I was drinking a somewhat festive winter warmer or strong ale with all the cherry flavor and spices. Not a terrible beer by any means but definitely not an old ale, at least this bottle.","hoppymeal","0"

3,-17.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Originally reviewed on 1/19/07. 22 Oz Bottle. Faint wisp of tangy old lemon malt. A nip salty and an edge of weak oats. A touch of grassy hop leaf. Really not all that enticing. Deep ruddy pour, clean with opalescent golden fringes, with a froth of ivory. Flavor is a nice, warm cream with banana skins, lightly toasted almonds and a nip of bourbon fudge. Malty character is a little wheaty with some faint grain oils. Relatively light bodied, with heavy drinkability, something I dont expect in the style. Cherry juice and a bite of oak fade out through a very lacking hop presence. A good platform, but I want more. More warmth, more character, more depth and a hint more hops. There is a very slight wild edge, which brings some unique turns. Overall, this leaves me wanting for a little more.","CharlesDarwin","Jan 28, 2007"

The taste is not what I expected. Full of bitter hops,carmel,alcohol,and mollasses you would think that this is good,think again. The combinations are all wrong making this beer hard to choke down. It's a good idea,but they don't pull it off. The m/f is light,weak,and thin with the flavors mixing very poorly. This isn't a good beer and I'd pass on another one.","jmz62565","Jan 16, 2007"
