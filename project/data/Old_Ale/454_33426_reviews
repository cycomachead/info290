"The beer pours a cloudy gold. The aroma is almost as if it's a barrel aged beer. There is no hint of hops. The first impression of its taste is its sweetness -- almost too much -- with some maltiness and slight funk and hops. Unlike the aroma, there is no barrel aged character in the taste. The beer has a full body and light carbonation. Overall, it is a good beer but not likely one that I'd go back to often."
"Alright aroma but the flavor just wasn't up to the level of something like Third Coast Old Ale. Had a hop bitterness on the end that I thought didn't mesh well with the malts."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/30/2013. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, cherry, apple, herbal, grass, light leather, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, cherry, apple, herbal, grass, light leather, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, cherry, apple, herbal, grass, light leather, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice old ale style. All around good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"This is my first encounter with this style of ale. It pours a handsome mahogany color with an overly abundant off white head(and I do mean Overly abundant). It leaves a silky lacing and nice legs. The aroma is boozy, reminds me more of scotch or bourbon than beer. Notes of wood and vanilla and peat abound. The mouth is sticky and very coating. One of the thicker beers I've tried. The flavor is complex embodying many of the notes of a well made whiskey. It is very sweet at first but gives way to a pleasant depth of flavor that is warming for the body, mouth, and soul. Very nice beer. Can't wait to try more of the style."

"I thought I had purchased a more recent vintage, but was quite happy to find out that my bottle was 4 years old. I wish I could find a fresher bottle to see where this beer started. At this age, it has an unexpected apple flavor, which I assume is acetaldehyde. It works for this beer."
""
"The real letdown about this beer is that the body is too thin to carry the flavors. Nice complexity and the molasses., caramel and dark fruit all work really well together. Just wish it had a bit more body and booziness to carry this through. Still worth trying though."

"Overall: This beer reminds me a lot of Boulevards sixth glass quad ale So I would probably call it a quad ale. A good brew although I am a little biased because that is one of my favorite styles. Would definitely buy again."

"Overall: a pretty good beer. Try it if you love old ales. Snatch some up for the cellar if they are a good price, but nothing to go out of the way for."
""
"All that said, this is the 2009 vintage so this beer is almost 4 years old. I imagine the carbonation being low has something to do with that. I'd like to get my hands on one a little younger because I feel certain this beer is past it's prime and would be better in a later vintage. If you're a fan of old ales give it a shot, but it's something I'd probably only grab again if I saw it in single bottle."
""

"Overall - It was interesting to try such an old style of ale. It's definitely not something I would ever drink on for pleasure, only because of the strong alcohol flavor, but I can tell this beer was made right. The other flavors go together nicely."
"Overall: This is a strong ale…the 9.0% ABV seems a bit low for how strong a taste the alcohol leaves…I’ve had other brews with similar or higher ABV, but with way more resonating flavor…this beer seems a bit one sided, with little to no balance…it’s good, but I don’t think I’d search this one out again...(2/5)"
"O: A pretty standard old ale. Nothing special but nothing offensive. A bit of odd bitterness that doesn't really ""fit"". Not bad, middle of the road."
""
""
"O: This is a very simple, straight-forward old ale. In fact, it is the simplicity that makes this beer so appealing. It is sweet without becoming cloying, and the sweetness compliments the grains well. This beer is a very good baseline for thinking about old ales. It is also a very easy drinking beer – so be careful because it is 9% ABV. Overall, this is a pleasant and pleasing beer for fans of old ale. If you see it, buy it – you will be happy you did."
""
"O - Factoring in the price on this one it is a decent beer but a little on the expensive side at just under 4 bucks a bottle. Its a nice beer if your a fan of old ales, if not I would pass on this one. Cheers!"
"Overall - Well it has some off flavors, but they don't make me cringe. Just wish they weren't there. Medicinal flavor and a very stale bitter finish."

"Taste follows closely, most of the experience is in the full, smooth mouthfeel, which carries subdued and well-balanced dried fruit/ candy notes. Detectable alcohol, which I am just fine with in my barleywines and old ales. A beast- very rich."
""
""
"I would recommend this for fans of the style and if you want a really big, interesting beer. I would buy it again but it is not for everyday - it is special."
"O: Quite a unique and well balanced ale, certainly worth a try, fragrant and flavorful"
""
"Overall: A good beer. More aromatic would be nice and nothing really sticks out as special; but would recommend for drinking."

"2009 vintage. This dude seems way too cocky for my liking... The beer, though, looks lovely, bedecked in rosy garnet and topped by a steadfast finger of oatmeal-tan foam. The nose comprises maple syrup, toffee, mandarin orange syrup, dark leafy greens, a tiny sprig of mint, and a vein of cocoa in the background. The taste holds notes of toffee, mandarin orange syrup, light tobacco, cocoa, graham cracker, vanilla bean, brown sugar, Belgian candi sugar, and that same sprig of mint, very mild and very subtle, lodged way in the distance. The body is a straight medium, with a very light moderate carbonation, and a slightly slick feel. Overall, one of the best beers I've yet had fom Arcadia, this one wins on a number of levels. It falls just short of being truly special, but it is pretty damn good."

"Overall I thought that this was a pretty bellow average Old Ale, I don't have a lot of experience with this style so I am no where near an expert on Old Ales, I just thought that flavor and body seemed watered down and the nice and intense aroma didn't make it's way over to the flavor which was disappointing. This beer doesn't have good drinkability, its a little boozy which doesn't work well when the beer feels watered down and the flavors just don't hold my attention, one is more then enough for me, you won't catch me reaching for another. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, this beer looked damn good and had a really nice head for an Old Ale, the aroma wasn't too bad either. What I liked least about this beer was the taste and the mouthfeel, the taste was light and watery with the flavors no really doing it for me and the mouthfeel was also watery and much lighter then it should be. I won't be buying this beer again, it just didn't work for me and it was pretty expensive for what it was at $3.79 a bottle, there are much better beers to be found for that price. I can't say that I recommend this beer, if you really like Old Ales it may be worth the try, but I thought this beer was pretty run of the mill. I have never had this beer fresh so I don't know how the age has effected this beer but if the flavors were as intense as the aroma it probably wouldn't be that bad, but the flavors were much lighter letting some of the harsh off flavors show up more then they should. I just wasn't impressed with this beer, I would much rather have a Founders Curmudgeon and that beer is stronger and better priced, so far this is my least favorite Old Ale and one of my least favorite brews Arcadia, they can make some damn good beer, too bad that this wasn't one of them."

"O - This is over a year old version of this beer, yet I am still inundated with the aroma and taste of alcohol. I'm wondering if older versions mellow it out on the senses. I'm not saying the alcohol is bad. It is a little too central in the characteristics."
""
""
"Also: the picture needs to be updated. They have a different label now."
""
"O- A wonderful winter nightcap. A nice sipper that gives the impression of a warming effect. Would be interested to see if the ""2011"" version is actually the current release. The bottle shop where I puchased this was in existence in 2010. A little odd, eh?"
""
"Arcadia Big Dick’s Olde Ale is not as complex or as rich as my favorite old ale North Coast Old Stock Ale. Big Dick’s Olde Ale is good and a very drinkable old Ale nevertheless."
""
"Overall: Worth picking up as the prices was only $2/single, which isn't too shabby for the style. Typically I would say to just pop for the $13 four pack of Olde Stock, but if you're in the mood and don't feel like dropping the coin, this one will do."

"better head retention. aroma is about the same. taste has lost the boozy flavor. still a bit buttery. overall- the previous rough edges seem to have smoothed out. the alcohol is now hidden."
"Pours a hazy reddish-brown color with a very thick and creamy off-white head. Really nice lacing and a good cap throughout. The nose brings forward some light toffee and brown sugar. Nothing too complex. Sweet malt throughout. Really quite plain and not all that integrated. Medium body with light carbonation and a fair amount of sweetness throughout. Decent enough, but not something that I would come back to."
"O: This beer just seems out of whack for me. It's a bunch of different flavors that don't come together to form one cohesive brew. Pass."
"Not a bad beer overall. Not the best I have had of this style. Would not go out of my way to have another. Average across the board."
"This beer poured out as a light hazy red color. The head raised about an inch or so until it faded. The smell of the beer was a little spicy, boozy and had some sweet malts in there too. The taste had some dark fruits upfront that transformed into a smooth earthy spice flavor. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and pretty drinkable. Overall I would drink this one again."
"Aroma is fruity and tangy, apple and orange with an undertone of barleywine. It pours a dark cinnamon brown with a fluffy, pale tan head that doesn't stick around for long. Flavor is quite fruity with a nice alcohol kick and a slightly sweet malty undertone. Texture is smooth and short on fizz, but I had this bottle squirreled away for a while before discovering it. A tasty and pleasing ale."
"Poured a 2"" light caramel colored head. Held to the light the body is an interesting hazy reddish caramel. Malt dominates the nose. The flavor again has lots of malt, a little saltiness, and reminds me a little of both barleywine and Scotch ale styles. The body is medium weight and there's a medium finish. All in all Bid Dick made a quality product."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall, I like this beer a good deal due to its unique finish and delicious taste. It's not perfect but it's pretty good. In fact that sums up most of my feelings on Arcadia's beers to date."
"Interesting beer, glad I purchased, but this is likely a one time drink for me."
"D: I am not sure that I will finish this based on the fact that the floaties are way at the bottom of this bomber. Fellow BA Bamadog always says the floaties are protein but I'm going to pass. Interesting to have an 8% beer 5 years aged - not bad but I have a feeling that it's a little over the cliff in terms of best flavor."
"Flavorful and interesting. Dark fruit sweetness is matched well with a dry cedar perfume quality."
"Overall is drinkable, but very boring for an Old Ale, lacking the full flavor and complexities I would expect from this style."
"Not an old but slightly above average, very drinkable beer."
"Enjoyed on tap at Black Dog, Urbana, IL."
"Future outlook: Nice beer that isn't available around here. Happy to have tried."
"d: very drinkable for the style. one of my favorites to date."
"The beer pours an undistinguished cloudy brown with a slight head. The taste is pleasant but as it warms you notice the alcohol more (which our bottle lists as 9%). Overall I would get this beer again - while not the best Olde Ale but definitely better than average."
"Pour from a bottle a hazy red with some spotty head. The aroma is caramel, non distinct fruit, some apple and some sort of spicy hops. The flavor has some good caramel maltiness and a pleasant graininess. The beer is a tad on the sweet side for my tastes."
"I'd put the alcohol here at 7-8% based on the body but there's NO alcohol flavor here. Not much carbonation in the mouth but it's pretty smooth and the body is thinner than some of the vintage type ales. Overall the mouth and the drink-ability are above average."
"Poured a chug of this into a snifter (it's about a 40 oz snifter). 2009 vintage, poured Dec 1st, 2010. Dark amber, nose is pretty malty. Taste is not quite as malty, with a good mouthfeel. The alcohol is too prevalent for 8% ABV. Not quite balanced. A decent beer; I wouldn't be ashamed to serve it to any friends with developed beer palates, but at the same time, probably not one I'll reach for on the shelf anytime soon."
"I could keep going, but all you need to know is get a differant bottle."
"Very enjoyable. I wish there was some more body, but overall a great Old Ale with a lot of character. Something that I would highly recommend."
"Drinkability: While admittedly not a huge fan of the dick joke name, this beer is a pretty fine sipper. Not sure if it makes it into Ohio, but I could see a few of these going in the cellar."
"Taste: I'm not typically a fan of Arcadia's beers but this is nice. Sweet, cherries, a bit of alcohol. I was expecting this to be overly sweet, and it is sweet but not inappropriately so. Real quality stuff, in my opinion."
"Solid beer but not excellent. Much better suited to be served on cask (with cocoa nibs). Easy to drink though not going to repeat too often."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, there might be better similar beers out there but this is still a very solid beer that is worth drinking for a long time. My advice would be to cellar this one for a few years if you're skeptical about it."
" D- It was a bit tough to finish with the soapy yeasty quality getting stronger and the lemony quality to the hops just don't work together. There wasn't much malt flavor so perhaps age would bring some of that out?"
"D- Not impressed at all. The beer did get drank but only after a couple of my buddies helped me out with it. Maybe I had some of this and it wasn't suppose to be served? I'll try again just to be sure."
"Into a tulip, poured a dark murky amber-burgundy color, with a thin off-white head that did not retain well, but lacing was decent. The aroma had hints of plum, raisin, rum, vanilla, caramel, toffee..and it seemed like every time I stuck my beak in there, I came away with a new aroma. Very impressive. In the taste, I did get a sense that there was a high alcohol content, but I also got the sense that it had relented over time, and it blended very nicely with a rum-raisin, vanilla, caramel, plum, and even modest pineapple bouquet. Slight alcohol bite on the finish, but this is also where the citrus appears. Slick and smooth; thick with zero carbonation. Definitely a sipping beer, with a creamy dessert or a cigar. Not a huge fan of the style, but man did this one age well. Needless to say we went back to the store the next day to see if they had more, but no luck."
"D: A well made Old Ale overall, but nothing spectacular."
"A very dark amber burgundy tone with a huge of white fuzz head slowly popping down. A little layer of sediment stirs at the bottom but is easily picked up and pours the transparency to nearly opaque. Smells like alcohol and ripened fruits. Taste is much the same a fruity malt taste pleasant to the palate. Lighter than I imagined it to be. Cheers."
"Overall, I think 2 years in the cellar did wonders for this beer. Much better than I expected."
"Overall I like this beer more in toto than the summary above would indicate. I would generally consider an Old Ale that's this sweet to be at least moderately flawed, but in this beer it somehow works with the dryness to give what is to my palate a very pleasing overall experience. Do I contradict myself? Very well, I contradict myself -- I contain multitudes."
"d: Just not a fan of this one. I was warned but I bought it anyway. Oh well."
"Pours a cloudy, brown color. One inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hops, and citrus (lemon?). Fits the style of an American Strong Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. The feel is also slightly watery. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, hops, slight roasted malt, and citrus (apple?). Overall, good aroma and appearance, but lacking in mouth feel and body."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry caramel malt scent with hints of smoke and alcohol warmth. The taste is decent. It has a dry roasted character with plenty of caramel flavor and alcohol warmth in the finish. There is a burnt flavor as well that gives off a slightly smokiness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent old ale. I'm not crazy on burnt character. It's a little off putting."
"(D)- A decent strong ale that might seem to need more time in the bottle to let it develop more. Shows promise though."
"D - This is definitely the best Arcadia beer I have had so far been disappointed with them, but this is pretty good and glad I picked up a bottle."
"Definitely try it sometime!"
"D - this was a pretty good olde ale. It seemed like it needed some age on it so that the flavors would settle."
"D- Really interesting ale; a nice sipping beer that isn't to heavy or overpowering in intensity."
"This has ok drinkability. Pretty good for an Old ale, but average compared to the whole beer spectrum."
"This wasn't a particularly good or enjoyable beer. Pretty mediocre."
"Notes: complex malt character, warming alcohol and rich body make for a delicious winter warmer. good example of a textbook English Old ale"
"This has mellowed tremendously as the light toffee maltiness is complimented by some fruity esters and slight booziness. There are some mild signs of oxidation in the flavor, but not much. I could use a bit more body and creaminess, and the malts seem a bit light and not sweet enough. Hops have all but disappeared by now, but it sure could use some leafy green bitterness. It is a decent beer, but a lackluster old ale at the 3 year mark."
"Conclusion: I'd had this beer once before and thought I really liked it, but in retrospect, it was before I really started getting into craft and I might have had a couple of brews before this one so my judgment may not have been spot on...Arcadia's brews are very hit or miss for me, and this one's a bit of a letdown."
"This is very much my style. Offering loads of sweetness and just hints of bitterness."
"A pretty decent beer on the whole, and one that certainly develops as it warms, but not my favorite style, and certainly not my favorite within the style."
"I found this beer to be undrinkable. I would not purchase it again."
"D- This is more of a sipper for me. The strong alcohol and oaked flavors pummel the palate, but this is to be desired by many."
"My pour resulted in a finger of light-tan head with low retention. The color was a VERY cloudy orangish-brown. Nose was rich with malty sweetness. The mouthfeel was medium with a good bit of sugary sweetness on the tongue. I let it warm and I was glad that I did - some of the sweetness diminished, allowing a warming sensation to come forward. The finish was warm, leaving me with a glowing feel. One would be plenty for this hophead."
"Overall, I am really liking this beer. A lot of flavor going on here. Seems to be aged in barrels, but I am not certain on that. Definitely wished I had grabbed another bomber at the price I got it at. I could definitely have this again."
"This brew is drinkable but only for a few, it is a little to sweet for me. And the alcohol is to apparent in this one."
"Drinks alright, but lack of malt depth really takes this one down a knotch or 2...Not bad, just doesn'y quite pull together"
"Reviewing to style, this one doesn't do so well."
"This beer pours a an interesting shade of light translucent yet hazy mahogany. There is a decent finger and a half tan head to it that has good retention, though not much lacing to speak of. Nose is light but sweet - some caramel malts come through, raisins, cherries, and a touch of breadiness. Taste is bitter up front - some roasted malts that weren't in the nose. It then sweetens up with caramel malts, and raisin, the finish has a touch of hop bite to it. Mouthfeel - this is a medium bodied beer, a bit oily/slick going down, decent carbonation, and the alcohol content is evident. Overall a decent beer - not my particular favorite of the style, but worth sitting down with."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my shaker glass. The bottle states this is a 2006 vintage. Appears a muted, hazy dark copper color with about an inch of off white head. Alcohol is apparent in the smell and taste, but it is not overpowering. Time was kind to this bottle, it mellowed nicely. Smells of brown sugar, bananas, and caramel malt. Bananas foster in a bottle anyone? Tastes is dominated by over ripe, brown, mushy bananas, caramel, and brown sugar. Medium bodied with slightly muted carbonation. Glad I got a chance to try this one with some age on it."
"22 oz. Amber/orange pour, descent off white head with good retention. Malty aroma with some understated caramel. Flavor is better, nice toffee/caramel, malt, yellow raisin, slight brown sugar. Medium body, fairly lively. Finish is more piney with a hint of citrus. Interesting brew, would have liked just a bit more body to this, but all in all pretty good."
"Feel and Drinkability: Carbonation is low and delicate, just right for the style. Finish is dry. Really nothing all that special, pretty much just what is expected, nothing outstanding, nothing special. Overall just right, just right as in Goldie locks and the Three Bears. This is one that I'll consider buying again. I am pleased with this beer from Arcadia, its the first I've had in a long time due to some volcanoes that I previously had. This beer is the first from them that has impressed me, the first that I'm thinking about coming back to at some point. I will enjoy drinking the rest of this beer."
"D: Drinks well, goes down easy, isn't overly filling, will get you drunk quick. Not bad at all."
"Medium pour bigs out a thin head that doesn't last long and a spotty lace that sinks right back into this murky copper colored brew. The aroma is faint but what I detect is cherries, a splash of rum and raisins. There's a bit more action in the taste compared to the smell but not quite what one would expect from something that claims on the label to be a ""liquid ode to Richard the Lion Heart"". Y'know what I mean. Such grand statements prepare ya for something brimming with attitude in it's flavors but it almost seems that this is more talk than it is action. It's not bad though it just doesn't push it to some hearty full on floor ya type of flavorful level. Medium bodied-not too thick and not too light. Lots of malt sweetness and some dark fruit flavors on the tongue. Brown sugar notes in the back of the mouth and a bit of a brandy burn down the throat."
"Overall, not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way again in the near future. Tough style, and kudos on the effort, but not my favorite offering from Arcadia."
"D: This beer would get pretty heavy. Pretty nice though and I love the style. Not enough old ales out there."
"Nice head with a clean finish in the mouth. A little tart to begin with but finishes well. For only eight percent the alcohol taste is rather prevalent. Reddish amber in color with what tastes like hints of cherry in the body. Taste really develops as it gets a tad bit warmer."
"Cocoa brown with some white head. this is an easy drinking British style old ale. That style has usually demonstrated more barley taste to me. More caramel and rum from brown sugar. There is some cocoa in here, and a nice finish. A good one to share."
"Drinkability: ehh"
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer. It isn't nearly the blast to the palate that some Old Ales are, but I don't think that they HAVE to be like that. This is labeled as a ""American Strong Ale"" on this site...whatever that is. Either way, it is a pretty good beer, and I would recommend that you give one a shot...especially if you like a malty to balanced beer with mild hops. Here's to you!"
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Almost clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Raisin nose. Flavor is sweet, fruity and a little medicinal, the bitterness balances. $6.99 for a 22oz bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma."
"Really sweet to be especially drinkable. The first few sips are interesting, but I struggles through this bomber."
"Drinkability is not to hot, because this beer is, and overly sweet. The taste is initially pretty good, but after a few sips, you quickly realize your in for a long hard slog if you try to finish the bomber...I didn't!"
"D: Not so great. Glad I split the bomber with a friend, to be honest."
"Not one I'll likely revisit."
"Heavy with good feel. Drinkable with a nice dessert or cigar, one to find for sure, not sure what the problem was with previous vintages, but this one is very nice."
"I'm not quite sure what they were going for with Big Dick's but I doubt it came together as they intended. Granted, old ale is a style that has tripped up many a great craft brewers so there's no shame in trying. But Arcadia is going to have to try a lot harder to refine future batches."
"Bottle courtesy of goryshkewych: Poured a deep clear copper color ale with an average foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt with some subtle notes of toffee. Taste is also dominated by some mediums sweet caramel malt notes with light toffee notes also noticeable. Some very light acidic notes were also noticeable which might indicate the start of an infection. Average body with medium carbonation and no apparent alcohol. A bit short on character for this style."
"Big Dick's Olde Ale is a strange brew. I'd love to know whether the brewers at Arcadia meant for it to taste like this or if something unforeseen happened along the way and ruined what was intended. Can I have my $6.79 back?"
"Overall, its drinkable, well, sippable enough despite shortcomings and noticeable alcohol tinge (which is fine here). I don't know that I liked it quite as much as the overall score reflects, but I ended up enjoying it enough to let it go at that."
"D: I was surprised by this one. I was expecting a much heavier offering (considering it's an old ale), but this is rather sweet and lighter on the palate. Definitely unique...I will come back to this again in the future. Had I know what to expect, I might have paired this with a baguette and chevre."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Drinkability - this is a very good ale, only it's high abv limits sessionability."
"2006 vintage. This poured a dark, hazy brown with orange accents and tan head. It smelled like a blend of delicious malts including caramel, barley, and rye, as well as mild orange and copper hops. It had a very complex and well balanced flavor, tasting first like sweet caramel and milk chocolate malts, then like bitter floral hops, then like earthy and leathery malts. It was somewhat thick with no carbonation and a very smooth and sweet aftertaste, and it had a bit of alcohol warming. Overall this was a fine example of one of my favorite styles of beer. Delicious."
"D: Fairly average per style, worth a try, maybe not a six-pack."
"I'm not one for astringent offerings, but this is one of the better ones for me."
"Deep leather and mahagony color with some light bubbling and a light head. Just a great color though. Very nice when swirling in a snifter. The aroma is full of syrupy, caramelized fruits. The taste starts with dark figs with a little leather. Then some roasted apples in with a very light cinnamon syrup ith a sweet yet slightly herbal finish. Very warm beer, but very tingly on the back of the tongue. Great sipping beer. Glad this beer is finally available in Illinois."
"There was a solid ""pop"" when the bottle was uncapped and there was an immediate smell of cinnamon. The beer was fairly clear, a deep amber colour with reddish highlights. The thin ring and skim of fine bubbles showed decent retention and produced spotty lacing. The aroma was sort of odd, a combination of cinnamon, mint, and melon with a tart funkiness. Moderate bitterness with a little bit of caramel, but it seems really thin on malt. Sour cherry notes and a bit of weird funk were evident, as was a bit of wood character and lingering minty hops. The body and carbonation were alright, though it seemed a little light, and there was a bit of warmth. This was definitely a strange beast, one that I probably wouldn't try again."
"Appearance is a clouded amber blood burgundy beige head forms thick with lacing forming scantily as the head slowly dwindles. Much better than I recall fresh this is from last years batch. Aromatics are tart raisin and fig and earthy notes of grape seed, sweet and tart play well togethr in the malt component mild touch of hops in the finish, let's face it an old ale brings the malt. Flavors flow with malt and fruit tartness namingly an array of raisin, apple juice, and mild citrus appeal. Finish brings out a mild charred oak character even though I'm aware this one hasn't seen the barrel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied even with soft carbonation flow nicely one smooth quality sipper. Drinkability is okay one that did develop less brashness after a year flavors didn't meld at all with the original release I'm glad my buddy Kolbz hit up Bockown for it."
"the flavor is malty, very rich, firm bitterness enough to balance the malt, citrus, hint of spice lingering with caramelized malt."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"D - It just didn't work for me. That was an unusual aftertaste. Otherwise, it is not a bad brew. Maybe it needs more aging."
"This beer poured a clear red amber color and formed a bubbly light tan head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, cherry, lightly of caramel, but largely light for a strong ale. The flavor was of malt, coffee, chocolate and a hint of pepper. The body is medium light and the finish a touch sweet. As strong ales go, this one is a bit weak, it may need aging, but it doesn't show that raw power of those that even need aging."
"This beer is a one and done for me. There is a lot of potential here, but the beer hits all the wrong notes. It pours a nice brown with a bubbly head, some retention, no lacing. The smell reminds me of poor quality malt liquors, with that sweet yet wet cardboard aroma. The beer is a medium bodied, slightly syrupy, sweet ale that has some deep fruits to it, such as raisin rum, and brown sugar, but it is not warming and has this biting hoppiness that isn't all that good. So, with this beer you have compromised sweet malts and very imbalanced hop bitterness, with an aftertaste that is just too rough in the throat. Look elsewhere."
"2006 vintage.Poured into an imperial pint glass a chesnut brown with a well formed one finger off white pillowey head that left broken rings of lace behind as it settled.Uninspiring aromas kinda dull actually a bit of orange essence as well as some brown sugar but really it didnt hit home,that orange comes through flavor wise with some brown sugar,a fading leather note and a touch of vanilla-oak no hop presence really shows through.A little plain it has its strengths but in the ends its kinda boring."
"I always worry about new Old Ales. The contradiction in terms usually result in young, or green, beer that shouldn't be on the market for up to a year after brewing. This beer exhibits some of these young traits, but more peculiar is a harsh wood-aged character that chases the beer from the nose to the finish. The aromas open with a partial sweet / partial twangy scent of deep molassas-type malts, dark / dried fruits, and a musty, sweaty scent that is reminescent of Belgian Artisanal Ales. The flavors bring up the malts, but are quickly swamped by an agressive wood character with high amounts of berry-like tartness, nuttiness, papery, woody, earthy flavors that prove to be too distracting for the Old Ale. The little critters that live in the wood (for aging) have made theirselves too much at home, bringing a sharp, very astringent, and thin texture to the brew; making it tough to finish. Although the astringent flavors and textures remind me of Labics or Flanders, the beer does not balance well or compensate for the harsh mouthfeel. Probably the most disappointing of the Arcadia Big Beer Series."
"Ive now read some other reviews _ wow _ this one is all over the board. Im guessing that some age time does wonders with it."
"Drinkability: A beer that left me wanting more depth and character and less, much less tart fruitiness."
"Pours a hazy dark amber brown color with a nice dense tan head that left a nice sheet of lacing on the glass. The smell is spicy/medicinal, anise, woody, perhaps some vanilla, can't quite but my finger on it. The brew has a mild grapefruit hop flavor, a dusty chocolate malt presence, a touch of wine grapes, boozy at the end. The feel is creamy, enough carbonation to make the tongue tingle, moderate body, some alcohol burn in the end. A combination of an old ale and an American strong ale. Not as blunt and over the head as a ASA but not quite as smooth as an old ale, a bit too boozy. I thought it had a good flavor range and is worth trying."
"This one pours an amber color with a medium head that falls quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of dark fruits, caramel, alcohol, and some hops. The flavor is very malty but also has a roasted flavor along with plenty of caramel that is followed up with a medium bitterness. The alcohol makes its presence known. The body is medium and the drinkability is just ok. Overall a nice beer."
"Poured into a chalice a cloudy dark brown color, nice carbonation, huge creamy off-white head, ton's of creamy sticky lacing, islands. The nose is malty, slight yeast, plums, raisins, and caramel. The taste is malty, sweet, fruity, and a good dose of caramel. The finish is sweet and dry. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body, a well rounded slightly complex brew. Very drinkable, really enjoying this one, very tasty, highly recommended."
"better stuff out there"
"Not sure what to say here. I've tried a couple of the Arcadia Big Beers, and both have been mediocre, at best. This one pours alright. Nice brown-umber color, with a nice little finger of head on top that disappears fairly fast. Nose is oddly mild for an ASA. Some slight sourness, a hint of fruit and malt. Mouth is a big ball of sourness. Comes on really strong at the end, too, in a garbage aftertaste that gets worse as the beer warms. I guess there's some fruit, maybe malt in there too, but the sourness overwhelms pretty much everything else. Ugh. I'm okay with sour beers, when I feel that it's done deliberately and with a bit of a balancing act. It's just too much here. Beer is thin to medium bodied. I guess you could drink this, although what's the point. Just got back in town in Michigan, so I've been giving the locals a shot, but I'm kinda running out of steam with Arcadia. Think I'll stick with the Founders and Bell's instead."
"Thanks, Vancer, for the opportunity - this was a beer that I asked for so it doesn't reflect on you"
"Glad i had the opportunity to try it, but i don't anticipate doing this one again."
"This is an odd one. Sampled from a bomber poured into a regular pint glass. Half inch head dissipates fairly quickly to a surface foam with minimal lacing (no doubt due to the elevated ABV). Color is pretty close to a classic Old Ale, deep amber/copper. Aroma is malty sweet with some fruit (raison & slight banana??) overtones upon aeration. The taste is pretty good, with malt dominating; little hop finish. Not really an Old Ale taste though, although I can't exactly peg the flavour style.The mouthfeel is surprisingly good, pretty soft carbonation. I definitely felt the ABV, so I reduced the drinkability from average. All in all, I liked this one, even though it is not a true Old Ale."
"Pours a ruddy brown in color, slightly hazy with a small cream head that fades quickly. Aroma is sweet spices, maybe a bit of ginger, along with a good dose of cherry. A nice spiced bread aroma. Taste is quite similar with more of the cherry coming thru, a slight tartness mixes with a small amount of bitterness and a slightly dry finish. Medium to heavy in body, alcohol is evident in the finish but not extremely noticeable or overpowering. This beer pretty much threw me for a loop, I expected an old ale and felt like I was drinking a somewhat festive winter warmer or strong ale with all the cherry flavor and spices. Not a terrible beer by any means but definitely not an old ale, at least this bottle."
"Overall, a fantastic smell and a good all around flavor, just lacks a little mouthweight and richness in flavor."
"The body is light to medium with a very soft carbonation. No taste of alcohol, no lingering bitterness, just a feint reminder of lightly toasted English malts. Fairly easy to drink despite high ABV."
"M&D - for a highish ABV, rather bottoms-up-able, a nice layered flavor, even with having high hopes for the style, a quality brew"
"Drinkability - delicious,a fine bottle to warm me up on a cold winter's night. A fitting way to celebrate this year's Superbowl XLI finalists. Congrats Bears & Colts."
"Originally reviewed on 1/19/07. 22 Oz Bottle. Faint wisp of tangy old lemon malt. A nip salty and an edge of weak oats. A touch of grassy hop leaf. Really not all that enticing. Deep ruddy pour, clean with opalescent golden fringes, with a froth of ivory. Flavor is a nice, warm cream with banana skins, lightly toasted almonds and a nip of bourbon fudge. Malty character is a little wheaty with some faint grain oils. Relatively light bodied, with heavy drinkability, something I dont expect in the style. Cherry juice and a bite of oak fade out through a very lacking hop presence. A good platform, but I want more. More warmth, more character, more depth and a hint more hops. There is a very slight wild edge, which brings some unique turns. Overall, this leaves me wanting for a little more."
"Pours the color of a ""Coke"" with a small dirty white head that quickly disappears with little lacing. The smells not too strong,but alcohol, and sweet malt are present. The taste is not what I expected. Full of bitter hops,carmel,alcohol,and mollasses you would think that this is good,think again. The combinations are all wrong making this beer hard to choke down. It's a good idea,but they don't pull it off. The m/f is light,weak,and thin with the flavors mixing very poorly. This isn't a good beer and I'd pass on another one."
"Proclaimed to be a ""liquid ode to Richard the Lion Heart"" as an excuse to use this lame name, and it backfires on them, because Big Dick ain't all that tasty.	This somehow manages to impart hot fusel alcohol flavors at only 8% ABV, coupled with an odd unripened grape sensation sends this one down the drain."
"This one is pretty good but not Arcadia's best."
"The beer poured a dark brown with ruby highlights, and topped a thin, fizzy off white head. Not much to the nose. I got some dark caramel, and a little milk chocolate. Nothing really in the aroma from hops. The taste has more of the dark caramel, some dark chocolate, a light note of dates. Again, not much from the hops. Just a light bitterness that lingers, but no real flavor character. The beer is a little sour, and has some heat on the finish. The mouth feel is thin. Really not much to this beer. I think I will pass next time."
"Wet cherry-stained cardboard. There it is, in four words. Sorry, I hate to hate, but I gotta call it as I see it."
"D: Pretty average for the style. This one needs something more to make it interesting. A barrel aged version of this might introduce some much needed character. As it stands, this is pretty boring. Not bad, just boring."
"Drinkability: Very average old ale/strong ale. Not one I'd need to return to. Pales compared to the big boys (Stone, North Coast, Bell's, etc....)"
"Drinkability: decent beer that is worth giving a try. Not one that I will rush back into having again any time soon as personally this didn't hit the spot."
"This goes down pretty easily, but it's not a very complicated beer. I don't know if aging will be able to do much to add any complexity to it."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed an uneven swirl of beige bubbles over the slightly cloudy burgundy brew. What ""head"" there was is just hanging out around the rim almost immediately, with minimal lacing. Aroma is syrupy sweetness, with vanilla. Taste is light maltiness upfront, with an off fruitiness and plenty of artificial-seeming flavors to close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are okay, but the flavor won't get me back. Kind of sorry I decided to ring in the New Year with this one. Oh well."
"Brown ruby with copper edges. Tight, thick, creamy, light khaki head. Nice lacing. Nose is a mix of fruit and caramel, with some rum and pine resin thrown in. Slightly numbing alcohol and toasted malt up front. Palate reveals brown sugar and sweet, rummy, dark fruits. Scouring, herbal hop bitterness follows and takes us to the finish. Caramel and pine sap linger. Mildly warming. Medium body with a dry finish. Not bad."
"Drinkability: A good american offering from a very British style."
"A tad upset as I was looking forward to drinking this. Maybe my expectations were too high. You know what they say about that. Maybe it's a beer that gets better with age but I will probably not try to find out."
"Big Dick's Olde Ale isn't very big at all, at least not after my full bomber emptying impression. After a good way into it the malts do leave enough chewy residue for what it's worth. Almost bordering a dopplebock likeness, but short in nature of taste, and nearly everything else an Old Ale should strive to be. And that striving should to be bigger than this effort by Arcadia."
"Bomber bottle, vintage 2006, nice to get this info, especially on a brew like this one that might benefit from a bit of aging. Pours dark brownish amber, clear, low carbonation, resulting in a nice tiny bubble film and slight, slippery lacing. Nose is bready malts. Malty, understated Brit style ale. Smooth and tasty, layers of maple, vanilla, and nutty whole wheat toast. Nicely crafted creation, warming and nicely drying out on the tongue late. Quality cold weather sipper. Get out the nuts, dried fruits, bread and cheese and enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is thin and weak. Not a beer I would drink in abundance."
