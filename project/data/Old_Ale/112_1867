It brings to mind Backwoods Bastard in the prominence of the bourbon and vanilla. As it warmed, and especially, towards the end, it evolves into sherry flavors and a tartness. The higher abv is noticeable, but not in an unpleasant way. I intend to stock up on a number of 4 packs.","JebBeerFish","Feb 17, 2015"

Faint, but a burnt caramel and brown sugar type aroma.  Taste was a bit too rich for me.  Aroma amplified quite a bit.  The feel was excellent, actually felt the carbonation for quite a while even though there were no real visible signs of any.  Nice and thick.

My head is swimming, and it's not just the 11.8% ABV. This beer is an unabashed treat,  and the folks at North Coast deserve a medal. Or at least people lining up to buy it. I could believe that kind of hype for an ale like this.","JasW","Dec 26, 2014"

4.29,4.1,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Strong this felt and strong this was but that didn't detract from the profile or drinkability of this beer. The yeast and fruit flavors lingered beautifully long after the liquid went down and there was enough malt her to make this full but just short of feeling cloying or chewy. Short of having too much grain or rye, this beer nailed what an Old Ale should be and in terms of quality, stands toe-to-toe with the Old Rasputin. An outstanding offering and the example of why brewers should add an Old Ale to their portfolio. Complexity is rarely more enjoyable than this.","JerzDevl2000","Dec 13, 2014"

4.2,1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into snifter; 2012 vintage, bottled in early 2012. Pours slightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, fig, apple, date, cherry, brown sugar, brown bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, apple, date, cherry, brown sugar, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, apple, date, cherry, brown sugar, light nuttiness, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and moderately slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome old ale. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 16, 2014"

The nose is dark fruits (plum, raisin and fig) over a faint caramel sweetness with moderate alcohol notes.  Full bodied with a rich creamy texture.  Average carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is loaded with complexity, yet well balanced.  The 11.8% alcohol is very well hidden, but becomes more prevalent as it warms.  It begins with a burst of caramel sweetness that flows into the dark fruit flavors, but the sweetness  is never absent due to the heavy malt bill.  Chocolate notes appear in the middle that relent to coffee/toffee notes. The finish is where the alcohol is most prevalent, leaving you with that nice alcohol burn at the back of the throat, but yet not overpowering.  The finish is somewhat tannic with a touch of hops over a fading caramel sweetness.  An outstanding Old Ale and a fine example of OC's brewing prowess.","tillmac62","Sep 05, 2014"

One of the better American old ales in the market. The reason I say that is that many of the other American old ales tend to be too sweet and end up tasting more like milder version of a barleywine.

3.86,-6.3,3.25,4,3.75,4,4,"2013 vintage in 12oz bottle. Served at 48degs. The beer poured a cloudy caramel color. A thick foamy head persisted for about 15 mins. Aroma is molasses, fermented dark fruit, prune, alcohol and bread (the Maris Otter comes through!). Alcohol and vinous sweetness on the palate. A pleasant bitterness on the finish with a touch of oxidation. This is a big beer and it takes time to sort it out. Thick mouthfeel with a long long finish. Overall, nothing to complain about. It doesn't feel like there are a lot of silly spice additions to detract from the wonderful malt and the rich gravity of this beer. I have come to expect a lot from North Coast. This beer does not disappoint. It's a little hot. I have three other bottles that I will let sit another year. Then we will see if the alcohol has mellowed a bit.","chickenflea","Jul 12, 2014"

Brown-amber color, thick frothy head, can't judge lacing in a paper cup. Aroma is unique, sweet brandy, caramel malt, and a fairly strong aroma of alcohol. Flavor is amazing--brandy, caramel, molasses, sweetness,slight hops. Mouth feel is medium with very little carbonation. Overall this is a unique and outstanding ale.","Dsimenson","May 13, 2014"

That's a fantastic brew in and of itself, but a flier in regards to style, with the treacle flavors and lower ABV. This one is more in range, style wise. Fruity, wine like, strong without being boozy, with a fantastic maltiness, this is a great sipping beer, and would definitely be a candidate for laying down for a year or three. The beer, I mean, although you'll lay down after two or three as well. I could definitely see this pairing with a relatively strong, aged cheese, or a fruit dessert that had some tartness to balance the sweetness of the beer.

This is interesting and doesn’t scream barleywine or old ale to me. Medium heavy mouthfeel with medium low carbonation. Some alcohol warmth going down that makes this a nice winter warmer.

It's like an untamed and out of control teenager who has an awful lot of potential, but just need to mature for a few more years before it is realized.

Hell yes, and if a barrel aged version is available consider me ISO.","JamesMN","Mar 24, 2013"
4,-2.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Rusty brown color, slightly hazy, an aggressive pour yielding a relatively small beige head that laced the glass well. Sugary aroma--malts, maple, brown sugar, butterscotch--dark fruits, minor hit of booze. The taste was similar, lots of sweet malts, dark sugars, toffee, some chocolate and hazelnut, rum raisin. Heavier medium body, smooth, some alcohol warmth, as would be expected from the ABV. Very nice overall. I'll have to seek out more of this, and keep some in the cellar.","Rifugium","Mar 24, 2013"

It smells of booze/whiskey, dark fruits, plums, raisins, caramel, malts, and toffee. This is a pretty heady old ale - lots of complex dark fruits blend with a caramel sweetness. It's followed by a sweet toffee flavor and a warm boozy finish. This seems like a perfect candidate for the cellar although it's drinking fine right now.","mnphish","Mar 17, 2013"

5,21.4,5,5,5,5,5,"Poured into a chalice. Pours clear, deep reddish copper with a finger length biege head. The head dissipates, leaving a cap of lacing on top. The aroma of malts hits up front. There is some alcohol in the smell as well as some fruit smells. The flavors of this beer are complex. It's malty, but it's also not that sweet. There is also some alcohol in the taste. There are fruity flavors like raisin, plum, and cherry. The carbonation is abundant enough to make this beer medium bodied. However, it the beer does stick to the mouth like a heavier beer would. verall, this is an amazing and complex beer. I've been saving bottles from the 2011 vintage and felt the urge to try one. This is best saved for a cold night, but it is even enjoyable on a summer day. It's definitely a world class beer any time of the year.","acevenom","Apr 09, 2012"

Poured with a thick beige foam that quickly reduced to a few wisps. , sweet malty aroma with ripe fruit and burnt caramel notes. Very boozy – even when cold. Thick and syrupy feel with light/lazy carbonation and a surprisingly dry finish. Dark caramel malt and ripe fruit flavors up front that are overrun with an unmistakable booziness from the middle thru to the finish. A bit of spicy hop bitterness in the middle that welcomes the booze. Finishes dry and boozy. Definitely a sipper.","IronLover","Mar 09, 2012"

It pours a murky dark burgundy with a slim tan cap that fades quickly. The taste is roughly 95% malts at this point. Big burnt caramel and a tiny touch of oxidation that keeps things interesting. Finishes off a bit nutty, no real detectable booze in the aftertaste. Carbonation and body have held up remarkable well. Overall, a big beer that can stand the test of time.","yamar68","Mar 01, 2012"

The taste opens up a bit more with just enough bitterness to balance out the sweet fruity flavors. Mouthfeel is nice with some good warming alcohol but not much bite for 11.7%.

4.47,8.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I have this every year and think that the 2011 vintage might be the best one yet. Pours a mahogany body with just a bit of tan head that quickly dissipates to a collar. Big wafts of molasses, maple syrup, brown sugar and dates are carried up on streams of hot alcoholic vapors. This is clearly going to be some concentrated stuff. I love that the flavors of super sweet without being medicinal, with notes of amontillado sherry lending a nuttiness to the autumnal sugars. The carbonation is low but still substantial enough to keep an otherwise sticky beer from gluing your mouth shut. A slow sipper, to be sure, and one that should be in everyone's arsenal as the weather turns cold. This 2011 is a very special beer.","droomyster","Oct 27, 2011"

3.7,-10.2,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This bottle is the recent 2011 vintage. This one pours a caramel syrup brown in color, medium in body, with an off white lacing around my snifter. It smells of light chocolate malts, perhaps some crystal malts, with a light essence of cherry and light sweetness. The flavors are very sweet and sugary malts. You get a lot of brown sugar, caramelized sugar, molasses and toffee. It's very, very sweet, pretty indicative of a fresh old ale. It's sticky and drinks thicker than it looks due to the sugar. Overall it's a fine old ale but it takes a backseat to HotD Adam. The barrel aged version of this is spectacular so I may have to sit on a few bottles.","aasher","Oct 07, 2011"

The color isn't terribly dark; the aroma isn't terribly powerful; the taste isn't terribly strong. The alcohol doesn't hit too hard, but there is an odd taste of... pizza? Maybe a plain cheese pizza with too much red sauce. I don't know. It isn't bad, however; just out of place. There's a big hit of peaches as well, along with the usual stuff you find in a big beer like this. Worth a try, especially on a heading-into-fall evening.","gfreed","Sep 09, 2011"

Very light in body compared to what I feel it should be. Nose indicates fuller mouthfeel. Just not there. Still good, don't get me wrong. Just didn't meet expectations once I smelled it.

The flavors are all spot on, but I can't help but feel that the sugar is covering some of the more nuanced tastes. While there is some alcohol, it serves to exemplify the flavors and is nowhere approaching the near 12% this beer contains. A great old ale that should age with the best of them.

Mouth is sweet syrup, dark fruits, leafy hops, tobacco. Finish is long with tobacco leaf, a bit to its detriment. I'm not sure whether that is oxidation or just some lingering hop character.

I didn't expect a whole bunch of flavors due to the high Abv but there isn't too much taste other than the alcohol flavor, but its still a good beer. Obviously not a high drinkability here.

Smells like Caramel Apple and cotton candy (this is getting better than a chocolate river) and fig with similar tastes of caramel, hints of vanilla and raisin/prune. I was surprised to find out it is in the 12% range because it seems extremely sessionable, but I did notice a warm alcohol finish that assures me that it is meant to be enjoyed slowly, but thoroughly in my case.","kellog","Jun 15, 2011"

The mouth feel was thin, the taste was akin to brown ale with a shot of whiskey, this is no exaggeration. It lacked complexity and character. I was all around just a hard ale to drink. I am hoping this was just a bad bottle. I will cellar this and see what it tastes like in a year.","beck2008","May 29, 2011"

Looked like a very bubbly cheerwine (that monstrosity of a soda from NC). Almost no head whatsoever. First taste and smell and I'm thinking, "How come it didn't say Barleywine on the menu?". Not as overtly sweet as your typical barleywine, but MANY of the same characteristics. Caramel, butterscotch, vanilla. At almost 12%, the alcohol is pretty well hidden. Still a sipper however. My 5 ounce pour was the perfect quantity.","Ralphs66","May 26, 2011"

Smells of caramel, rum raisin, and malt. A very nice sweet raisin bread aroma on this beer. Taste is very sweet and rich with brown sugar/caramel and raisin bread flavors. Low carbonation with a thick and chewy mouthfeel. Slight alcohol burn in the throat with each sip. Overall, this is a good beer that I stumbled on at my local Whole Foods in early 2011. I think they found a 4 pack in the back that they put out for sale. After tasting this year's brew, I am kicking myself for not buying more than one. I will look into getting these each year that they are released for aging purposes.","UCLABrewN84","May 24, 2011"

A little toasty as well. Very pleasing. Nice malty sweetness that works hand in hand with some toasted malts and a nice caress of hops. This beer presents a nice balance. Just a hint of alcohol towards the back of each sip. Just a hint of a wine-like acidity which seems to open this beer up a bit. After letting this sit I'm getting some rasin and booze flavors. A nice change from other strong ales. Very curious to see what age will do to this.","100floods","May 19, 2011"

The smell of this brew is sweet and a little smokey some roasted malts in there too, perhaps even some hops shining through it in the back too. The taste is very complex. It reminded me more of a barely wine really. There was a strong alcohol warming sensation here. Also there were some rich dark fruits and roasted malts. The mouthfeel was on the thicker side.

Also, there are roasted characteristics present, with a shift to a slightly sour aftertaste. The beer has a sharp and carbonated feel in mouth initially, yet has a full and syrupy/viscous feeling throughout the mouth.

Luckily towards the end on the last pour it recuperated some of the tones and complexities that I remembered, but not many. Not that its temperature had changed so much, but at least it ended into a somewhat higher note. I´ll try to cellar the rest of this 4pack and see if a couple of years have a good effect on it.","Daniellobo","Jan 18, 2011"

I get the flavor right off the back when I sip and then it goes away leaving very little mouth feel which is nice with 11.5% ABV.

The alcohol has mellowed out over this last year...making this a much better beer. Mouthfeeel is not too syrupy and very delightful. Drinkability is fair considering the ABV.

Sweetness has come to the fore a little bit, some cocoa, toffee, fruit bread, a slightly bitter and chewy finish which leans on some roasted barley, a hint of earth and a generous dash of alcohol that never comes off as astringent or burning. Drinking like a fine port or similar - this is just an awesome evening treat. Light to medium carbonation, not too chewy but creamy mouthfeel. Warming all the way down. Delightful.","ritzkiss","Nov 30, 2010"
3.52,-14.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"2007 Vintage. Old stock indeed. It pours a murky dark apple cider topped by a very minor spritz of dirty ecru foam. The nose comprises buttery biscuits, caramel, chocolate, graham crackers, ginger, and a well o' fusels deep in the back. The taste holds notes of orange peel, slight pine, buttery toffee, light cocoa, and a decidedly noticeable alcohol burn. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and a chunky feel. Overall, I think age has done some good for this brew (remembering way back to my fresh bottle a year or so ago), but I'm not sure I could drink much of this at once.","TMoney2591","Nov 30, 2010"
4.09,-0.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"2007 Vintage. This beer pours a cloudy very viscous lighter brown color with little to no head to speak of. This beer smells rather pleasant. It smells of grandma's candy jar with lots of butterscotch some orange and a hint of grassy notes in there. The flavor is straight up butterscotch to the point where it seems as if there is a Worthers in my mouth right now. There is the obvious background liquor flavor that is to be found with this ABV, but it's not too strong. The vapor from the alcohol is a bit too strong to give it too high a rating on the mouth feel, but otherwise this is a pretty solid and good beer to drink.","Vdubb86","Nov 30, 2010"

Thick, close to viscous appearance, like orange clay mud in a glass, the brackish look gives way to some yellow at the outermost edges. Smells almost like a bakery or candy store, avalanche of caramel, toffee, butterscotch, milk chocolate, molasses, pralines, cinnamon, bourbon before prune, date, fig and dried peach scents ensue with a slice of raisin bread too, nothing hoppy or even really funky. Full-bodied with surprisingly good fluidity given the voluptuousness of the nose, the carbonation tightly woven yet not smothered in this environment. Here there's a peat moss, charcoal ash and unprocessed grains element to balance, at least in part, the molasses, honey, butterscotch, milk chocolate, vanilla fudge and date, fig, raisin fruit. Plus there's a nice glancing blow of orange, lemon citrus to lend zest. Creates more inner mouth perfume than you'd expect too.

It was short lived an quickly resided into spotty lacing. All in all though, this amber colored beer looks great with tiny bubbles floating to the top. When I cram my nose into my glass I immediately get sucker punched with a fist full of alcohol, this was not unexpected. After the first whiff of getting over the alcohol burn, layers of toffee and caramel come to fruition with a faint hint of brandy in the background. This syrupy beer is very warming with comforting flavors. Once again toffee and caramel come to mind with a bit of fruit; particularly plumbs. Roasted malts everywhere! The finish does leave a lingering taste of alcohol on the middle of the tongue. This is a flavorful beer which feel good in the mouth, a bit syrupy and the alcohol is warm going down, but nothing I wouldn't love on a chilly winter evening.

I had my better half take a sip as to see if she could tell which and she's torn between the two as well.

Lost a couple ounces though, shucks. This is my first 'old ale'. Pours nearly black, but holding it up to the light reveals see-through dark red. Very carbonated and quite a bit of sediment. Nice head rests on top, color somewhere between off-white and tan, eventually just turns into a thick ring not leaving much lacing. For the smell, first thing that comes to mind is "doppelbock". Cola, maple, burnt toast, vanilla. Quite a great scent. Taste pretty much follows the nose, getting alot of cola, unsweetened maple, dark malt, a whiskey-ish feel, probably a combination of vanilla+booze. The alcohol comes through much more in the taste than in the scent, but it is not overly boozy for 12.5%. Caramel and smoke also come to mind. Kind of reminds me of a cross between a scotch ale and a doppelbock. Pretty complex stuff, although I think I prefer smelling these flavors rather than tasting them, a little too heavy and not a huge fan of the tastes. This has been aged for around 2 years, I imagine the booze on this thing fresh must be pretty crazy. Taste actually improves a bit in the finish I think, a warming sweet vanilla flavor seems to take over. Mouthfeel is good, nothing really mentionable here. Definitely malts over hops, the aging has had a part in this I'm sure. Drinkability is pretty limited here simply because of the nature of the style. The price and booze taste isn't high considering the alcohol content. I was considering buying a 4-pack of the 2008 to age but I think I will pass on it. Good, just seems like the flavors here are a bit too powerful for my taste. I still wouldn't mind trying the Reserve though...anyone wanna give it up? :P","Chico1985","Apr 02, 2010"

Hot, astringent, extremely boozy, not unlike young bourbon with a hint of vanilla. Would have liked some more carbonation on this one, the mouthfeel was cough syrup like.

Pours into a pint with a thin but fizzy big bubble head. The color is a medium brown that is only slightly translucent. Upon tasting, it's the mouthfeel that first becomes evident. This is a very thick ale, high viscosity, almost like motor oil. The taste is very malty sweet, black licorice, some butterscotch, some anise, very similar to the smell. No bitterness here too speak of, or if there is the malt buries it. Sniffing the bottle after the pour it has an interesting tequila smell. This is tasty and it is one heavy hitter.

There is some light chocolate or carob notes that add that earthy quality. A good dose of dark fruit sweetness, dark grapes, round out the brew. The booze is detectable and adds a light belly burn. Despite the belly burn, the feel is quite good. Nice carbonation helps balance the sweetness of the brew. Solid body, almost thick, and kind of sticky. A very enjoyable fresh old ale.

Smelled of raisins, plum, orange peel, and STILL plenty of booze. I know this isn't barrel aged but I get some oak in the taste, some nutty flavors, some citrus from the hops, and pretty spicy.

Deep, rich flavors of sweet malt, wood, leather, tobacco and a brief kick of hop bitterness are followed by some not so welcome alchohol hotness. I originally put these down for a few years hoping that the rocket fuel aspect of this beer would fade a little. It did, but not enough for me to rate it over a 2.5 in drinkability.

The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, moderately carbonated, and very boozy. This is worth trying but not something I would purchase often. There is too much of an alcohol overtone and not enough interest in the other flavors. I think it is a challenge to make a 12.5% abv beer that is not overwhelming.

The aroma was strong and pungent like a cognac, ripened fruits (cherries in particular), alcohol and esters which when combined were slightly sour. The flavors were equally big and bold, a rich honey-like sweetness first hit my palate followed closely by pears, figs, black cherries. This was then augmented by caramel malt and some spiciness from the hops. Behind all of this was the alcohol heat which was not covered up per se but kneaded into the flavor profile and lingered on the finish. The body was medium/full accompanied by a lively carbonation.

Aromas are strong alcohol, almost fusely, plenty of rich, dripping plums and raisins with a dose of chocolate. No hop aroma. Flavors are more of the same, alcohol dosed dark fruits with a bit of chocolate, toasty malts. Carbonation is WAY high and truly hinders the drinkability of this otherwise excellent ale. Why they chose this carbonation level is beyond me. It thins it out and just makes the alcohol shine with the sweet malts masked in big bubbles.","dreadnatty08","Apr 19, 2008"

Spiced rum like qualities. Taste follows with a good sized rich sugary prune and caramel flavor up front, vanilla, some spiced rum mid taste as it turns drier before a good alcohol warmth in the finish.

While there were many similarities (I'm not sure if the recipe has remained unaltered or not, but they certainly taste as if they were at least similar recipes), and the '06 tasted like something that could some day develop into the '02, the various flavors of the '06 are so much more rough and aggressive, while the '02 has allowed them to mellow and intermingle, resulting in a much rounder, more subtle combination of flavors.

Taste has a slight boldness up front that is quickly followed by an essence of warmth, some pine, big malts, chocolate, faint coffee, alcohol heat and a shot of hops to keep it interesting. Left behind is some sugary sweetness to accompany the certain contentment this beer provides. Carbonation is excellent despite the lack of head. In fact, a few minutes after the pour, bubbles are still actively searching for an escape. I wouldn't describe this beer as full-bodied, as there is a certain weightlessness to it's complexity.

The taste is much the same, lots of depth with the foremost taste being the sweet fruit flavor, not much in the way of a hop presence but is mostly balanced by the brandy-esk alcohol bite at the end.

Behind are chocolate and fruity notes with a little tinge of boozy aroma at the very back. The taste is incredibly complex. I served this beer relatively cold, but there is still a huge burst of flavor that pours out of it. It reminds me of a strong doppelbock, or an eisbock. This is one of the most quenching 13.25% ABV beers I've ever had. Of the strongest beers I've had, this is by far the best tasting. Nutty turning to a fruity flavor (I'm assuming the fruity flavor is from the alcohol). I taste candied dark fruits and Christmas spices. The finish is so mellow and smooth you don't have a clue how strong it is. As it warms up it begins to show a little of the alcohol spice, but nothing close to most beers 10% and up. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, thick, and filmy. As far as drinkability goes, this has to be the most drinkable beer of this size that I've ever had.

Very subtle malt and caramel fight faint alcohol tones for dominance. The taste however is a smooth warming toffee with full hop involvement as it drifts into a semi-dry, nutty finish. Make no mistake about it though, the warming 13.25 percent alcohol is fairly evident.

Aroma of dark candied fruit, alcohol, apples, and caramel. Flavor is very similar, candy, caramel, along with some darker fruits. This really shines as it warms up, as the flavors really come out, but the alcohol is more intense. More vinous at the end when it warms, maybe some citrusy hops thrown in at the end. Medium body.

I get unmistakable barley wine traits here, big malt, lots of alcohol, raisins, chocolate/coffee-like bitterness on the edge, and a lot of warmth and burnt wood on the end.

4.19,1.7,3.5,4.5,4,5,4,"Muddy caramel brown, topped with a whisp of ivory head. Looks viscous and earthy. The head drops out entirely after a couple sips. A surprisingly authentic english aroma. Distinctively biscuity, thick maris otter sweetness with an earthen, woody english hop aroma. Fuggles or some variety thereof. Resiny hops and vinous fruity notes. In the vein of Harvest Ale or Thomas Hardy's. The first sip just glides along the palate. Soft, gentle carbonation, kinda casky like real ale should be, with a thick, syrupy mouthfeel. A nice sparkle to this one. Full and rich with malt, malt, more malt and powerful fruitiness. Surprisingly understated (and underanticipated) sherry and vinous flavors. Cider, too. I'd have thought this would have shown more age with four years. I bet it could easily go until 2010, if not longer. Some hop bitterness remains in the finish, dulled enough so the malt really shines, but contributes a good amount of earthy, wooden flavor. A full compliment of caramel and dark fruit takes up the finish, joining with some boozy indertones. Vague smoky phenols, too. Really, really fruity all the way through. Good thing I like that flavor profile. The flavors continue to intensify as the brew approaches room temperature. I wouldn't recommend sitting with this one forever, because the already gentle carbonation seems to run out and the last few sips were pretty much still for me. Great stuff. The complexity seems to grow in leaps and bounds over the years, as it acquires that rich, succulent dark fruitiness, moving slowly towards sherry oldness. With four years on it, I expected this to have shown its age much more. One of the best aging beers I've ever had, particularly amongst american breweries. Huge, but full of nuance. I don't recall this being especially noteworthy amongst big beers when fresh from the brewery. Well worth the cellaring.","UnionMade","Aug 30, 2006"

It's wonderful to watch sparse bubbles rise through the lovely deep color. Smells deeply of caramel, and a smell almost like a candied apple, with spicy alcohol. Very sweet juicy, and acidic as well. First sip (still cool): Drier than expected, malt seems somewhat astringent, and there is acid as well. Still, alcohol is well-concealed (can't hide the warming, though!).Likeable, but just as the label says, will improve with a year in the cellar.

Extremely alcoholic bite and aftertaste, which is not surprising at 11.4%. Beneath seems to lie a tasty, medium-bodied, moderately hopped brown ale. Carbonation dissapears quickly and leaves a medium mouthfeel, as in comparison to the strong alcohol wash, everything seems thin and watery. Probably not a style that strives for "balanced," but could be impressive if the alcohol wash weren't so intense and overpowering. Drinkable, but slow going, and at the first few sips I thought I might find myself drainpouring it before I finished. More than one of these is hard to imagine.

Complex malt flavors: caramel, raisons, cane sugar and coffee. The alcohol is warming and not as raw as the bouquet suggests.

The beer was initially candy sweet with hints of prunes or raisins, which complemented the blue cheese. The aftertast was actually a little tart. The alcohol stood out, although it was not "hot." It merely punched in at the end of every sip and was very recognizable. This may mellow out with time. The carbonation was great and the body smooth.

The alcohol dominates the taste buds with only a slight sugar/malt backbone. In light of the aromas present, this is a disappointing beer. Not much complexity in this beer. The sweetness turns sour in the back of my throat leaving an unpleasant, dry aftertaste that only gets worse over time. I sipped this beer slowly but could only finish 3/4 of it. An interesting style that I wanted to try, but I won't be having this again.

Heavy and oily, this is truly delightful. Big malts present bready flavors with strong caramel sweetness. Slightly burning alcohol is warming and enjoyable without being too overpowering. Ripe apples and grapes provide a sweetness and acidity at the same time. Some darker fruits are hinted at, but escape my conscious. Hops provide a hint of pine and the slightest whisper of citrous, but are mostly present in their spiciness. Even a little saltiness from the bold hops. The hops blend well with the sticky sweet malts and alcohol. Finishes sweet and alcoholicly potent. Mouthfeel is very full and thick, massively satisfying.

The flavor is incredibly complex with huge malt notes of molasses, brown sugar, caramel, toasted bread, currant, plum, blackberry, raisins and toffee. There are some light floral and piney hop notes here but they definately take a backseat to the malt. This almost seems like an english barleywine due to the huge malt profile, and this beer has quite a scotch-like burn and some nice vinous flavors .

It has a complex array of smells. It's sweet and warm, but also with a dry feel. The taste is great. It has an intensely rich, malty flavor that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with some roasted barley. It has a mildly bitter hop flavor that goes down slow and smooth and finishes warm. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great beer. It has nice complexity and an overall good taste; a good drinker.","WesWes","Jul 08, 2005"

Lotsa hinting at wine-ness with a chock-full of tannins from the hops. Alcohol is noticable, just buried amongst goodness. Some gummy aromas, like gum sap from Brazilian rubber trees. God, I'm a sucker for a good old ale, sometimes I just get lost in them. Lightly sticky in the mouth, but I suppose it's a given with the 11.4% ABV tag. But the flavor is marvelous. Richly malted, with an equalling hop counterbalance, which really defines a good old ale, IMHO. Just a touch of lime sherbet nearer the finish (sounds wierd, but bittering after sweetness..., not so illogical in a strong ale) I'm impressed by this beer year in and year out.

Aroma up front is vanilla with an underlying sour aroma with dry oak aromas throughout as well; lots of alcohol on the sniff which killed some aromas; reminded me a lot of a bourbon or maybe even a dry sherry. Taste is lots of sweet fruits (plums or cherries maybe- hard to distinguish) along with lots of drying notes on the finish due to the alcohol. Some malt flavor comes through on the body but the bourbon flavor really comes through. It actually reminds me of a fruity Southern Comfort. Mouthfeel is lots of alcohol and even MORE alcohol!

Alcohol precense is strong, even for this somewhat aged bottle. Tastes like a brandy or cognac or scotch or something along those lines, i'm not completely sure. Hop flavor is almost drowned out by the alcohol but the hops do provide a drying lingering sensation in the back of my mouth.

You get a sugar crystally, fruity, carameled flavor followed by a warmth that let's you know that this old girl has some joy juice in it. Tiny bitterness or alcohol bite in the finish. But the whole thing is kinda light. Both in texture and in taste. The thickness and boastful flavors that I expected are nowhere to be found. But the colour! I wonder at this point if I have made a crucial error and sprung this bastard loose too early. Then I think, well it isn't going to grow a set and get thicker in the bottle if I leave it for a year. Flavors could possibly improve, but the body is not going to get any more full. I am kind of disappointed as I have contemplated drinking this bottle for awhile ( okay, a few days )now and the thing just fell short. Flopped like a fat, wet titty.

3.91,-5.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"A downright gorgeous dark ruby body glows in the light. The yellowish tan head forms easily, but soon fades. The fading head is a bit of a disapointment, but what a gorgeous color the body is. The aroma is thickly malty with occassional whiffs of milk chocolate. Theres a hop bitterness that tingles the sinuses a bit, but its held in check to be a balancing note instead of overly dominate. The malt alternates between bread and that phantom chocolate with streaks of hop bitterness to break it up. A good bit of oak comes through toward the late middle. Awesome barleywine.","aracauna","Sep 30, 2004"
4.22,2.4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a cloudy coppery molasses color with a small oatmeal colored head that fades pretty quickly. Sugary malt barleywineish smell. Thick brown sugar, maple, caramel with a whiskey-level punch and just a pinch of hops. Gooey and smooth, what you imagined it would have been like had you busted open the bottle of Vermont syrup at your grandmas house. Same finish as a shot of Frangelico with a lemon. You gotta love sweet stuff to love this stuff, but on a cold rainy day Captain Old Spice would give this a resounding "R".","PopeJonPaul","Sep 28, 2004"

The malt aromas are accentuated by hoppy notes of citrus, apricot, and orange. The taste is full and sweet, and it coats my mouth in a fruity accompaniment that is caused by a marriage of citrusy hop notes and dark fruit malt notes. This is pretty tasty, with notes of plum, raisins, citrus, pine, sherry, leather, and caramel. This beer is a good example of the Barley Wine style, it is perhaps weighted towards the hop end of the scale, but not so much that you can't easily pick out the rich notes that the malts bring to this beer.","Gueuzedude","Sep 17, 2004"

The taste was rich, with warm alcohol reminiscent of port wine or rum, buttery toffee, roasted nuts, and brown sugar. The mouthfeel was dry and roasty with a distracting peppery alcohol afterburn. The aftertaste is also quite bitter. This is definitely an after dinner sipping beer.","rajendra82","Sep 07, 2004"

The head stays around for a while and leaves lace that slowly slides back down to its creator. After being poured a light sweet fruity smell comes from the glass being accompanied by caramel a slight alcohol scent. Caramel covered fruity sweetness meets your lips with the first sip. A bit of hop bittering provides a nice balance as the finish is quite warming with a slight alcohol sting on the tip on the tongue. Some chocolate notes were also detected as this warmed as was a stronger alcohol presence. Mouthfeel was creamy and chewy at times with an almost full body. Drinkability was good, as I could have had another one after this if I wasnt going to bed afterwards. Great ale here that I recommend to anyone to try.","meathookjones","Aug 28, 2004"

Head receded somewhat quickly, but a layer bubbles remained for the duration. Lacing was okay. Aroma was stronyl of sweet malts and alcohol, as an old ale should be. Taste is mainly of sweet malts and alcohol, but not the burn your insides of Avery's Beast, but rather a nice, full, warming ethanol, which is much preferrable. Mouthfeel and drinkability were excellent for the style, kind of scarily so, to be truthful. I could see this gracing my fridge again...","ppoitras","Aug 26, 2004"

Aromas are initially fruity giving off some fig and raisin-like tones followed by some alcohol notes and candy sugar. There's also a bit of a toffee aroma in the mix as well. Initial flavors are big and fruity with a really strong dark fruit flavor. Raisins and figs are most present. Following a strong alcohol flavor overwhelms the mouth. Whew this beer is kicking! Afterwards the flavor of this brew progresses to be quite malty with a mix of caramels and toffees leading the way. The finish to this brew is a bit sweet with still more dark fruits, and just a hint of hops that leaves a tingling spice. For being an Old ale this brew is fairly light bodied and smooth, with a light carbonation that just tingles on the tongue. Definetly a nice brew to try out.","bigbeerdrinka","Aug 24, 2004"

A decidedly rich nose with less alcohol smell than expected. Full, sweet and caramely, with a nonetheless definite alcohol "bite"--a combination that evokes Scotch ales for me. Mouthfeel is similarly full and decidedly soft and chewy; presumably the fine carbonation is at work here. Alcohol warmth, while unceasingly present, is nontheless not as strong as expected. Some astringency up front gives way to a full, caramely sweetness; no shortage of malt here.","BitteBier","Jun 28, 2004"

Its got an almost chokingly harsh smell, with huge spices, chocolate, red wine and sticky malts. The taste is a bit better, but it is almost entirely overpowered by the chocolate taste, not letting much of anything else through. The aftertaste is too sweet and syrupy too. The mouthfeel is good, except for the various contributing factors of the taste (sweetness mostly) but meduim body and good carbonation make it ok.

Flavor is a bit strong on the alcohol, maltiness present but somewhat overtaken. There is little bitterness - just a hint of hops - very nicely balanced. I was a bit let down on flavor after the huge aroma. The nice aromatic elements shine through a bit in the aftertaste, which is malty sweet and very smooth. No lacing. No head after a few minutes.

Any sort of subsequent lacing was completely nonexistent. The nose is very malty, bushels of raisins dominant, warm brandy notes, toffee, chocolate, bread, and distant earthiness, hops. I find the aromas to be very inviting but the potency isnt that powerful. I sniffed hard for the reward! The palate is very flavorful; the alcohol is the showstopper! It is not harsh or overwhelming but it is very prevalent and encompassing, similar to brandy/rum mixed with raisins and candied sugar. Good warmth. Toffee, lots of toffee notes. Faint chocolate hints, plums too, and similar to the nose, distant earthiness (the hops maybe?). This is one malty beast, damn yummy! This is pretty close to full-bodied; the carbonation is modestly low and very natural, lovely mouthfeel. This is a great sipping beer. I really enjoyed Old Stock Ale; this beer really wasnt on my radar, thanks to prAna for suggesting it. This is an exquisite beverage. I purchased a single 12-ounce bottle in Loveland, CO.

The aroma is of rotting fruit, vanilla, and souring milk. Mouthfeel is brisk and light from the carbonation, but with a big chewy malt body. The taste is of rotting cherries, raisins, vanilla, molasses, faint carob and distant soy sauce. The bitterness is mild, woodsy and herbaceous. The finish is sweet and breathy with alcohol.

Alcohol is coming through some, but not overpowering. Pretty good-sized resinous hop wallop kicks in, but simply balances the malt; it doesn't overpower it.

Alcohol is also present in the nose, which caught me by surprise. Oops, the label says 11.4. OK, let's go....! Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, and has appropriate alcohol warming. Taste is initially an assault of chocolate, quickly followed by notes of coffee. Peppery spices seem to be present as well. Dark fruits try to emerge, but get smothered by the big abv.

A light citrus and mild coffee aroma are also constantly in the background. Pronounced toffee, coffee with cream and milk chocolate blend nicely with grapefruit and lemon zest bitterness. Flavors of pear brandy and a peppery spiciness mingle within the woody alcoholic and creamy bodied compound. This is a beautifully crafted beer in the "extreme" class.","BeerResearcher","Nov 16, 2003"

4.58,11.2,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"2001 version. Retasted 1/15/2003. Has mellowed and gained complexity with age. Medium brown color, small head. Aroma is very malty. Very malty, full-bodied, full flavored ale. Very nice hop malt balance. Malts are sweet, roasted caramel. Mouthfeel is full, round and nearly chewy. Has a definite high alcohol taste to it (10.5%) Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is malty, slightly bitter. Could use some bottle aging. North Coast recommends at least a year of bottle aging. Re-taste again in a year, that is if I have any left. Still have 2 bottles left in 2003. Need to buy some 2002 quick.","beerguy101","Sep 05, 2003"
4.1,-0.5,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Ruby garnet hue with a fizzy white head that dissipates into nothing as the beer warms up. Bouquet features voluptuous notes of alcohol, raisin, toffee, caramel, and mild hop aromas in addition to a rum-like sweetness. Strong, complex, and well-rounded for an American strong ale, this one features notes of caramel, rummy alcohol, mildly bitter hops, dark fruit, really sweet malt and sugar with a relatively fierce alcoholic rush on the finish. Mouthfeel is oily and quite smooth. This is a fantastic old ale for sipping purposes only. Drinkability suffers, however, due to the heavily concentrated alcohol that lurks beneath each sip. This is a fairly well-balanced strong ale and certainly one that I'll return to after it's had additional time to mature.","Jon","Sep 03, 2003"

Pillowy, tropical green leaves, with voluptuosly floral, truffly and toffee-like fruit gives plenty to chew on. Nevertheless it rinses cleanly across the palate leaving a glaze of perfumy magic. Quite impressive to drink now for all of its exquisite balance, a quality missing from so many American Strong Ales, Barleywines etc. Still, I think this will only improve over the next 3-8 years.","putnam","Sep 03, 2003"

Really a well crafted beer. I'll leave one in the cellar to see how it ages.","DerKaiser","Jul 16, 2003"

Aroma is intense as it is full of Sweet malt with fruity esters and a little hopiness to make the aroma very splendid. Flavor is even better than the aroma as it starts with a little bit of roasted flavor that transitions into sweet malt and huge alcohol flavors. Hopiness is very noticible yet it balances this brew quite nicely. Mouthfeel is heavy which goes well with the lingering hopiness and the fruity esters. Overall this is an excellent old ale which i will be sure to put a couple bottles in my cellar for aging.","RenoZymurgist","Jul 15, 2003"

4.76,15.5,3.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured into the glass a cloudy amber/red/orange color. The head was beige in color, fairly thick and foamy. The lace was barely there. The aroma was a whole cornucopia of smells all stuffed into the little bottle. I smelled simply the following items swirling in my glass. Sweet and tart granny smith apples, alcohol, sweet malt, baked apple pie with sugar topping, some other dark fruits, sandlewood like a barrel that held apple cidar was used, some nuts and again alcohol. The first thing I noticed about this beer that it was strong and thick and the first sip was full of flavors waiting to be discovered. I tasted sweet malts, baked apple pie, alcohol, kind of woody like it was aged in an oak barrel that was used to hold apples or other fruits, nuts and roasted malts, roasted sugars and a sweet hint of cocoa. This beer was bitty all through out. A warm alcohol glow filled my body afterwards. It left me feeling warm and fuzzy. This is a definite sipping beer. Awesome.","Jarod","Feb 21, 2003"
4.09,-0.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Dark amber/ruby in color, with a tight head formed by slowly rising carbonation. Malt dominated, somewhat nutty aroma with light fruity notes -- almost strawberry-like, but very unobtrusive. The mouthfeel is smooth and lightly coating, and the flavor starts with a toasty, toffee-like maltiness. This gives way to a slightly nutty mid-palate, with a bit of alcohol warming and a mildly citric hop finish. Aftertaste is pleasantly toasty. All in all this is a quite decent ale, though not the brewery's best, and not really a stand-out among the selection of barley wines available today.","mzwolinski","Feb 19, 2003"

A somewhat nutty, plum scent dominates the aroma. Just a wonderful toasted malt smell. The taste is sweet as expected, but again the nutty component is very prevalent. Nice plum and cherry fruits appear, along with a biscuit malt flavor. Some hops clean up the finsh, and present a lingering bitterness. The minimal carbonation contributes to the velvety smooth mouthfeel. The drinkability is surprisingly good for the ABV. This is one fine barleywine.","aaronh","Feb 12, 2003"

The taste also reveals the same as the aroma, but also yields roasted malts, sharp hops, and lots of alcohol. At 11.4% ABV, theres just not much covering this up. Blended nicely in this medium bodied creamy brew, this is definitely a sipping beer. Whew! This is put together very well! Cheers!","BeerAngel","Jan 31, 2003"
4.84,17.5,4,5,5,4,5,"This one is the best barley wine I have ever tasted on draft. The nose reminds me of a Hennessey XO cognac. The alcohol smell is very strong and usually something I don't enjoy as much in the nose. This one is the exception though. I love good cognac therefore the nose is exceptional in my opinion. The taste is also exceptional. The Cognac like nose lends to the flavor - and they are right - the warmer this barley wine the better it tastes. The after taste is fruity and not bitter like many barley wines I have tried. According to their web site this is a vintage limited run of 12,000 cases. So I would grab the bottles while you can. But if you can get the draft - man you are in for a treat.","AtrumAnimus","Jan 23, 2003"

4.15,0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer poured a nice deep red amber color and formed a nice foamy off white head that subsided quickly and left a small amount of lace. Some carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and fruit. A flavor of malt and fruit with some of the alcohol present as well. Not bad for a barleywine, but probably could use some cellaring.","Wildman","Jan 20, 2003"
4.45,8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"2002 edition. Dark ruby red with a beige head, which unfortunately doesn't stay that well, but that can be expected with this style. Aroma of berries and nuts. Definitely some cherry in there, maybe a little soaked wood as well. Alcohol is definitely present. The flavor is hop-infused berries and raisins with pretty big maltiness backing that up, sweet, nutty, and woody, with a little caramel. Very spicy Sharp hop and alcohol twang on the back corners of the tongue. Bittersweet is a good one-word description. This is a great barleywine, but I find it odd that it doesn't seem to be bottle conditioned. I think all barleywines are just perfect for bottle conditioning. Still, I imagine that you could cellar it and get some good results. In fact, I think it could stand a little cellaring before tasting. Very nice as is though. Try this if you see it.","hyuga","Jan 18, 2003"
4.5,9.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2002 edition. Pours a reddish mahogany color with a very thin white head that immediately fades into a thin lace. Nose is sweet malts, brown sugar, and ripe fruit with some alcohol notes. Taste is quite sweet at first with notes of candied sugar, caramel, raisins, and spicy hops. Very smooth with some buttery toffee notes and a warming alcohol effect. I love a good barley wine, and this one is in that category. I plan to lay several down for a year or two and see how they mature.","Morris729","Jan 16, 2003"
4.73,14.8,4.5,4,5,5,5,"A nice, dark amber to ruby hue w/ zilch haze. Sweetness and alcohol dominate the aroma, with notes of raisin/prune and a mild floridity. A huge, malty blanket wraps around the tongue. An almost praline-like dessert quality with subtle prune characteristics. Hops definitely play second fiddle in this bold ensemble! A healthy gulp will light a small fire in your belly! Overall, an incredibly smooth, big barley wine that sits on the sweet side of the fence.","Valevapor","Jan 10, 2003"
4.5,9.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Reviewed again over a year later on 01/19/04. This has met expecations as far as aging goes. The head and carbonation have diminished but the flavor has certainly improved. The alcohol smell and taste have mellowed a bit, allowing dark fruit to dominate completely: raisin and date with just a hint of brown sugar. Enough hop bitterness remains to keep things in check. In hindsight, I felt that I overrated it when I originally reviewed it, but it has aged so well that I have no qualms about notching up the ratings on taste and drinkability. I was certainly lucky to run across a large stash of the '02 OS in early '04.","mickeymac","Dec 31, 2002"

4.39,6.6,4,5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Turbid chestnut brown hue. Light tan head quickly settles into a thin, tight ring that coats the glass rim. Enticing blend of caramelized nuts, buttery malt, vinous alcohol soaked plums, with hints of grape and floral hops. Akin to a more intense Young's Old Nick aromawise. Intensely rich caramel driven malt profile, accompanied by notes of toast and buttery diacetyl. Fruitiness is of a mellow prune like nature and when coupled with the mild chocolate note, an impression of chocolate covered dried fruit is left mid palate. Notes of sherry, bittersweet alcohol along with muted hop bitterness emerge. Full bodied, w/ a viscous mouthfeel. Finishes with a spicy hot candy like sweetness. An intense, yet tremendously smooth barleywine. Its inherent satiating richness precludes quaffability. Old Stock is thus a beautiful nightcap. Surprisingly reminescent of Bell's 3rd Coast Ale.","marc77","Dec 28, 2002"
4.57,10.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This 2001 vintage bottle was supplied compliments of a butcher at a Whole Foods market. Color appeared to be a deep red with orange hues, head was tan, and lacing was good. This beer had a very strong fruity nose, plums and pears? Not surprisingly the taste was very smooth with a strong alcoholic kick. Good rounded mouth feel and for such a powerful ale, quite drinkable. Not my favorite style of brew but very good nonetheless. A potent warming ale. Perfect for a gloomy rainy day. Addition: I have fallen in love with tis brew and consider it one of the great beers available to us. The 2006 vintage aged one year has done it for me. Ultra smooth, warming, enjoyable, the ultimate sipping ale? Maybe, all I know is it is stupendous.","Mark","Dec 15, 2002"

The alcohol is not over bearing or powerful and the bitterness on the after taste and palate is well balanced, with a hit of sweetness. Drink at room temperature, if cold it just doesn't have the flavor, aroma and compexity it should have. Storing up on this beer. Going for a week-end drive to Ft. Bragg if I can't find this locally!

The head starts fairly creamy with a light beige color but dissipates quickly as expected in a high alcohol beer. The flavor starts with a burst of sharp dark fruit and malt, followed by a fairly heavy touch of alcohol, and then a drying hop character which is somewhat aggressive, but far from overwhelming. The finish is dry, but one sided. An excellent beer, but it's no Samiclaus or Thomas Hardy's either. An excellent beer from an excellent brewery!","NeroFiddled","Jul 16, 2002"

It poured a great deep amber color with a bit of a creamy head that faded a bit faster than I would have liked. It smells very malty with alcohol undertones in it. The taste is all malt from the first sip till you swallow. A huge malt character that almost completely drowns out the alcohol. A different kind of malt sweetness than a double bock (tend to be too sweet for me, or the wrong kind of sweet.) The mouthfeel is very sticky and it completely coats your entire mouth and tongue with its flavor. I think as young as this is I could still drink a few of these with no problem. A class brew. It should dry out a little as it ages. Can't wait to see how it is doing around next Christmas.","Murph","Mar 12, 2002"
