4.08,1.5,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"Poured a rich, cloudy deep reddish brown body with a minimal lacing of tan head. Overall impression of appearance is of an Old Ale indeed, old looking and quite beautiful. Scents begins malty rich, with a massive amount of sweet burnt caramel, molasses, rich chocolate and light roasted malt and supporting notes of dried fruit, cherry and raisin mostly, and warming alcohol. Overall impression of aroma is of a very malt forward Old Ale, with rich supporting aromas lending a warming quality overall. Flavor begins malty sweet with notes of burnt caramel and toffee and nutty malt, balanced by a mild bitterness of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Middle middle opens up further chocolate and roast malt flavors, with a light smokiness and notes of dried cherries, evident, yet light warming alcohol and light notes of leather. Finish is lightly dry with flavors of roasted malt and dark chocolate mingling with notes of caramel, molasses and dried fruit and medium levels of warming alcohol. Aftertaste is lightly sweet at first, with notes of caramel, becoming gradually dry with notes of rich dark chocolate and roast malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a very old feeling Old Ale. It tastes rich, deep and malty, yet is also warming and tastes musty and old. A pleasant combination in this beer that lends it a warming, rich, satisfying quality. Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy and rich with light carbonation and a sticky feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a fantastic Old Ale. Overall this is quite the nice Old Ale. It feels rustic and warming in all respects, as the style should feel. A malt-forward aroma and flavor are aided by warming alcohol and a thick feel to make a rich, satisfying beer.","Auraan","Mar 22, 2015"

Body is murky brown - a shade lighter than expected, with about a finger of almond-hued foam that leaves a few strands and specks of lace.  Aroma primarily of toffee, light cocoa and nutty.  Taste follows the nose with some complex malt flavor...  Rich caramel, toast, hazelnut, with some leafy hops / tobacco on the end - lends to the earthiness of the beer.  A touch of alcohol in the finish, which aging would help diminish.  Mouthfeel is medium-full with slightly high carbonation.  Overall, a delicious winter ale!","jpro","Feb 22, 2015"

Smells slightly like malts, hops, spices like cloves maybe but only slight and little else.  Thick in the mouth like a good winter warmer or old English ale should be.  Tastes are malt, hops, something like tea, sugar and spice.  Little bitter aftertaste but very subtle.  Really tasty as it gets to room temperature.  Can't place the fruit notes.  I don't taste any espresso like some reviewers.  Tea and maybe apricots?  It's good.  Hides the abv well.  I could drink a few of these watching the football.","uvachief","Jan 12, 2015"

Later I only get floral herbaceous hops with minimal malt or grain. Taste: sad to say not my cup of tea. I don't like ale with this flavor profile. It reminds me of a doppelbock gone wrong. It has a nice balance of dark roasted malt with herbal hops. Might be the strong alcohol note. This would be good with a meal just not my preference for a sipping beer. YMMV. Mouth feel: very full almost syrupy.  Overall: If you like old English ales with a darker roast malt and herbal hop and high ABV this could be for you. For me it is better to look else where Samuel Smith for example.","1angrydwarf","Dec 17, 2014"

The flavor starts with notes of coffee, chocolate, a touch of alcohol, and a bitter set of preserved black cherries and plums.  As the flavor progresses, it move toward cigar smoke, peat, and citrus pith.  As it ends the, smoke quotation bellies up to the pass, and hammers home a hit of cigar, dark cacao, and piney hops.","TastyFoodAndDrink","Nov 25, 2014"

4.12,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/30/2013. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, cocoa, chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, roasted malt, nuttiness, toast, brown bread, herbal, wood, pepper, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and hop notes; with great strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, nuttiness, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, herbal, floral, wood, light pepper, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, wood, brown sugar, roasted malt, nuttiness, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark malt and moderate hop flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent old ale! All around great balance and complexity of dark malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 12, 2014"

Smell is toffee, butterscotch, vanilla, pecan, brown sugar, and caramel. Taste is all of that mixed into one, toffee may be most dominant, but really a well rounded beer. Body is medium large, plenty of carbonation, not really dry, and man it is going down much to fast. This is my 3rd bottle of this and it is simply a great beer.","SawDog505","Dec 31, 2013"

Tastes like spicy chocolate, coffee, dark fruit. It's slightly musty like an old shoe (in a good way), and there is a touch of dirt. Mouthfeel is sticky and spicy and burnt; a bit dry. Over all a very good beer that is easy to drink and will warm one well in the winter months. Highly recommended.","Eisen","Dec 30, 2013"

Poured into a goblet, dark red-tinged brown, tan head, and I can smell toffee on the nose from about two feet away. Close up it's an herby, roasted grain aroma. Smells like it's gonna be sweet. First sip has my throat tightening a bit from the alcohol - this almost has a wine-like character to it, and not far behind at almost nine percent. Plummy, earthy, and stoutish. Mouthfeel is definitely thick, creamy, and barely carbonated. Stylistically appropriate, hot and heavy, and thoroughly enjoyable!","BeerWizard","Oct 11, 2013"

I guess the funkiness of an old ale seemed to come through. I love Great Divide, but this was not quite up to their usual standard, IMO. The booze was not at all prevalent, and maybe that would have helped more. I'll give this a try again, especially since it's now easily available. But next time, I might age a while to see what that does. Maybe I was just in a weird mood.","Beer-A-Lot","Oct 10, 2013"

At first pour the beer was cloudy similar to an unfiltered cider, with shades of hazy brown. slight head with a great amount of lacing. I could smell notes of vanilla. The mouth feel was very smooth and subdued; the perfect amount of carbonation. There was a subtle hop flavor, but none of the bitterness remained. Definite notes of brown sugar hit my palate in a big way with some roasted malt. As the beer warmed the flavor intensified and the haze cleared a bit,revealing a shade similar to clear amber. This is how winter beer should be. I could drink this beer year round but especially in the winter.","devlishdamsel","Jan 20, 2013"

I let it rest a few minutes after taking it out of the fridge before pouring, to give it a real English ale feel, and the flavors came out. More of a tasting beer (I did not try it with the label's suggestions of 'Romano, an aged hard Dutch cow's milk cheese, grilled beef tenderloin, apple crisp with ginger ice cream") but I could see how the tartness and smoothness of the beer would enhance strong-flavored food. I think the malty sweetness would go well with some shoofly pie and some lebanon bologna.

A lot of chocolate on the nose, some booziness, dark fruit and toffee as well. Such a complex brew. A lot of fruit notes initally, black currant, black cherries, plum, caramelized raisins. Chocolate, biscuity accents, and hints of sherry show up midpalate. Bittering hop kick and phenol alcohol join in and carry through the finish. Smooth, silky, full body with low to medium carbonation. Hibernation Ale is a wonderful brew, complex, satisfying, and supplies everything you might be looking for in an old ale.

There is a medium roasty bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium body and smooth mouthfeel.

The taste is just as delicious with that sweet molasses malt being the very first taste that hits your tongue then at the end you get the milk chocolate taste mixing in with a long dry finish with an herbal bitter hop. chocolate milk taste and the hops seem to be contributing to that pretty dry finish the most. Its actually a straight froward beer even with the thick rich taste it has. You also get a citrus hop in the back as well. The dryness is the only thing that could turn anybody off from this beer. Even though its a really dry finishing beer with each sip the sweetness balances it back out. Very cool beer.","thebrood1987","Apr 08, 2011"

Not much in the way of hops. The earthy hop flavor emerges slightly with the first few sips but this one is malty sweetness. The caramel and brown sugar dominate with a sprinkle of the dark fruit. The after taste is a strange one- herbal essences shampoo? This is a clean, hand-washed glass, rinsed well, and dried so I'm not sure why I taste this. It's not even terrible just not right or expected. I lowered my score slightly to reflect this oddity. Medium body with the right amount of carbonation present.

Flavor is along the same lines with a coating, rich toasted toffee and caramel malt feel. Nice amount of citrusy hops balance the big, robust malts very well. Some roasts and chocolate and even some light vanilla in here. A hint of dark fruits come in towards the end with a lingering flavor of sweet and toasty caramel, roast, and a light bitterness as well as a nice, subtle fruity character. Finishes smooth and rich.

Dark red-brown color, closer to redwood than mahogany, more translucent than opaque, clearer and brighter orange at the glass bottom. The nose emphasizes cocoa and mocha powder, dusty texture, dried oats, scones, Brazil nuts, concentrated cherry to plum fruit scents, as it warms the orange citrus spreads out, overall more of a gentle toast than deep roast, the hops linger in the background. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is in overdrive from the start, this churning helps to mask a lot of the underlying dryness. Again with the powdery cocoa, mocha, coffee, even the caramel seems this way. Well-baked pastry dough to scone, muffin flavors, well beyond yeasty. Mixed nuts, orange peel, here a little pine sap gets into the mix. The plum, cherry, blackberry fruit gets pushed off to near the finish. At the end gets more earthy with fallen wood notes, nothing close to herbaceous. Extra bonus points for the dryness, not taking the easy overly sweet route.","farrago","Jan 11, 2011"

Rich chocolate starts, before giving way to an amazing roasted caramel character in the middle. Mild spicy alcohol warmth finishes the beer. A very unique beer, almost like a scotch ale minus the peat, or something like a cross between a robust porter and barleywine. Very complex, but never muddled and quite enjoyable.","eclaycamp","Dec 10, 2010"

Medium bodied with a bit of a sticky finish. I've been on a bit of a hot streak lately, seems like everything I have picked up recently seems to live up to the hype.

It's like drinking a really fresh Bordeaux or Chateauneuf-du-Pape, it's not really drinkable fresh beacause of the tannins, but one can see the potential (that's why I kept the taste at a 3, were it is a clear 2-2.5 currently). This is really what's going on here. The malt flavour is really good, and when the hops (which I wasn't a fan of in this beer) drop out with some age I feel this beer could be phenomenal at that time, so keep that in mind.

This carried over in the palate with a full age liquor flavor that was a complex combination of toasted malt, port, oak, and alcohol.

There's a thick tan head and a tiny bit of carbonation rising with the beer. There is a sweet malt and raisin aroma. I can smell some of the alcohol as well. The Hibernation has a good malt taste. There is a dry, roasted grain finish and some brown sugar sweetness at the end. A little coffee bitterness lingers after swallowing. It's not too heavy of a body, but certainly above medium. There is still some carbonation left in this bottle. It leaves a modest coating. It's not the most drinkable Old Ale I've encountered (that may be the Old Engine Oil), but it is still fairly drinkable. I'd limit myself to one bottle though.","ToasterChef","Mar 29, 2010"

It is about one finger and retains at half a finger decently. It appears a bit fizzy and leaves medium lacing down the glass. Smells of chocolate malt, dark fruits like cherries, some earthy hops and spices like nutmeg. The overall strength is a bit lacking to me but it is a good smell. Alcohol stings the nose just a little bit. Tastes of chocolate malt, earthy hops, some citrus, spices like nutmeg, dark fruits and some bready flavor. A nice flavor reminds me of the grains left over after a homebrew session. I like the flavor balance but the alcohol is a bit high in the taste and takes away from this being a great beer. Mouthfeel is great here, nice medium body and carbonation, the warming is pretty high but not ridiculous. A nice coat of earthy hops and cocoa is left on the tongue.

4.3,7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"This is the second Great Divide beer I've tried; first being Hercules Double IPA. To be honest, I love IPAs, but I like this beer a good deal more... especially since I paid $13 for this in a 6 pack and I paid $16 for a 4 pack of Hercules... Not bad for an 8.7% ABV brew. Anyways, I poured this into a pint glass and noticed a cola like color with a deep red tint when held up to the light. The pour left a nice tan head that left an even lace around the glass. Malts, chocolate, caramel, and hops are evident in the aroma. The hop aroma is heavier than the hop taste, which was a surprise. Caramel malts with a hint of chocolate and hops are the most prominent flavors... although there seems to be a great deal of hops in this beer, it doesn't have the dry, bitter after taste of an IPA. This is a pretty thick beer filled with a lot of flavor. Not a good session beer, but a great desert beer(s). I think this is an incredible beer and I will absolutely buy it again very soon. I recommend buying this if you get the chance...

Certainly a beer that has me ready to dive in. Smells like cider, sweet grass, raw sugar. Just enough going on to let you know your dealing with a beast. I sip and the beer starts deeply sweet as it slips by easily on the lips. It stays sickly sweet, then opens up big time, arcing towards the back of the tongue. Notes of peat, bourbon, tobacco, cocoa and dryish grains are underlain by a caramel milky backbone. All of this is enveloped by a warm hoppiness. A great touch. The chewy mouthfeel is complimented well by the strong carbonation. Tobacco and peat compete, becoming more prominent as the beer warms - hints of smoke now appear. Alcohol starts to burn... things have fallen apart just a bit, but its expected with a burly beer like this. Its not a subtle affair. Very malten, earthy, smoky.

I can also pick up the hops, which is nice. Usually find old ales to be quite malty. Wow, tastes phenomenal! Roasty character lasts throughout, while you experience the underlying flavor components. I get a nice caramel and brown sugar flavor, with some nice malty backbone. The hops maintain a nice bitter balance. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, yet this is a very different old ale than what I am used to. This beer is exceptional and drinks very well.

It has been 3 long years since I had Hibernation last and it has been one of the G.D. beers I have missed most. What 'cha got cold Fall nights? With this beer in hand I can withstand even your worst wintry blasts. On to the beer. As gorgeous in the glass as it is on the nose. Deep autumnal amber hue with a tight, slightly off-white head. The nose is rich, with an inital wave of dry cocoa followed closely by earthy, piney hops. Belgian dark chocolate mixed with fir trees? Yeah, I am ready for this bad boy. The hops hit the tongue first but are imediately bodychecked off thier feet by the bold, smooth malt flavors. These are some bruisers for sure. Their swagger is confident and composed. And why shouldn't it be? They are packing heat like roast malt, perfectly baked brownies, molasses, and perhaps even a hint of Herseys syrup. But they never ov erstay thier welcome and become too rich or cloying. Drying, resinous hops pick up after the malt onslaught and keep things brisk, clean and ready for another rumble. Not to say this beer doesn't have a pleasing finish that lounges on your palate, but it is a 'sessionable' old ale by me account. Glorious. It shall soon earn itself a week or two on my kegerator, if that strikes anyone out there as a ringing vote of approval. Hope my roommates like it.

I don't find the overall aroma and flavour terribly "English" (again, due to the hop input, yet not least), but the impeccable balance does tell some truth in this light.

Good clarity, thin layer of fuzzy foam, and plenty of lacing. Smell blew me away. The dry-hops which seemed weird after reading the bottle really seem to meld nicely with the malt-assault my nose is currently experiencing. Alcohol barely noticeable. Plenty of dark caramel, dark fruits, butterscotch...like a rich double bock. On the first sip, the first thing I notice is the almost slippery mouthfeel. Reminiscent of some imperial stouts in its 'chewiness'. Taste is extraordinarily malty, with a sweet finish and a lingering alcohol/hop burn. However, the boozy/bitter finish is welcome in a beer this malty. No oxidation noticeable, I think this beer would age beautifully. I would say the drinkability is relatively low due to the high viscosity, but I wouldn't think twice about drinking 2-3 of these. Will definitely buy this again.","evantwomey","Apr 14, 2009"

As you drink it, the head sticks to the glass in an array of little bubbles. Such a nice looking brew! The aroma gives off toasted biscuit, a touch of raisin, dried currants, a little wet earth, and a good blast of hops. On the tongue, this one is no lightweight - a lot of big, malt expressions and a liberal amount of hoppy bitterness - yet it is quite well-balanced. It has a nice full body, and a smooth mouthfeel. It is strong without being overly aggressive. After a couple, you're definitely feeling warm inside, which makes it a great beer to quaff down on a cold, winter's night.

Rich creamy 2 finger head fizzes to a dainty ring and some lacing. Very clear. Aromas of chocolate, port, and citrus from the hops. As the beer warms alcohol becomes more pronounced. Flavor starts a smack in the face of chocolate, toffee malts and definately some sherry. A very abrupt waft of hops usurps everything almost shutting down the flavors for a moment. Finish is warm, malty and somewhat dry. In the mouth a full bodied beer with decent carbonation. Tootsie roll chewy and thick. Presence of diacytal. Low drinkability as the alcohol character really develops in the glass and become a bit intense. Overall? A challenge I'm up to again.

Not getting a lot of strong aroma, a little bit of caramel and a little earthy hops. Taste is rich and complex. Roasted malt, a little oak, spicy, earthy hops.

The initial whiff reveals big hops, and almost nothing else. On a second whiff the complexities open up with some sweet bread, dark fruits, yeasts and medicinal notes, which all come together to form an almost perfect aromatic experience. Tastes of sweet malts, yeast, caramel, and spice, with a timely hop bitterness thrown in for balance. This one's not too highly carbonated, and the mouth-feel is crisp at first, but finishes with a creaminess that helps it go down smooth, with a little alcoholic aftertaste behind.

Big chocolate in the flavor, a bit more of a bitter chocolate, the hops are bitter and noticable but not necessarily specific. Some light honey and perhaps a fig sweetness. Not sure I get Old Ale from this, definitely malty strong ale. The feel is well and chewy, with enough of a tingley carbonation to keep the malt honest, finishes with a bitter malt and hop bite.

Heavy maltiness with an equally heavy hop scent roasted malts and floral hops. Not too thick on the palate, this is a relatively easy drink considering the potency of this brew. Flavor is intense and wonderful. Thick dark malts of caramel and coffee along with some bitter cocoa. Thick hops, rather floral with a resinous bitterness. Oh boy this is spectacular, very enjoyable on a blustery windy Friday night.","kinger","Nov 10, 2008"
4.25,5.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I'm not really sure whether this ought to be classified as an English Style Old Ale - the hops are too dominant for that and, if I was being really strict, I would have to score it fairly low for being off style - it certainly wouldn't do well in a homebrew competition!

Lots of caramel, molasses, toffee, some slightly vinous dried fruits. Taste is really quite good, very malty. A bit stronger than the aroma with lots of strong nutty, caramel and toffee flavors. Lots of dried fruit esters. A bit port-like. A mere hint of alcohol. Another burst of malt before a somewhat dry finish. Good mouthfeel with a full, slightly chewy body and low-moderate carbonation.

Had to be careful with the second beer, as it forms quite a head. The smell reminded me a lot of a winter warmer, with spice present. The taste was very good. A nice combination of coca and cinnamon on the tongue. This old ale had me thinking of a porter's mouthfeel along with a winter ale's hearty flavor. A great combination. Drinkability being the only issue, as it's over 8%, you could start to feel it kick in after two. I would love to see how this beer would age over time.

Half-inch off-white head dissipated into a thin skim of spotty foam; very little lacing present during the tasting. Nose presented primarily as roasted malt with a touch of hops also detected. Taste was surprisingly more complex given the nose. Flavors of coffee and caramel with a slight hops bitterness at the finish. Full-bodied mouthfeel with a fair amount of effervescence considering the lack of a head. Very drinkable.

The initial taste was of the currant/black cherry component, but transitioned quickly into a big roasted, toasted malt finish with a nice hop bite at the end.

A bit of head that doesn't stick around too long, but long enough to look prettty, which is all that matters, right? Aroma is malty and hoppy. It is a nice change from the piney/citrusy american hops I am used to lately. It has an herbal and earthy quality that melds nicely with the fruity malt. Taste is sweet up front with a big bitter kick at the end. With the finish it has I would almost call this an IPA. But alas, there is a ton of fruit, raisin, plum action going on with a little bit of chocolate. It has a nice english hop character, and again, killer bitterness. The bitterness really saves the drinkability, as I am afraid it would be a little cloying without it. Mouthfeel is a little rich, but with a prickly carbonation. The bitter finish and carbonation really lighten it up and enhance the drinkability. All in all a great beer. Thanks J.!","pfknapp","Jan 23, 2008"

The taste is very much as would be expected; up front with the chocolate, followed with a subtle fruityness (cherrys) and bit of hop flavor. You can also taste a bit of the alcohol hotness as it goes down your throat. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of dryness (from the hops).

It's not a session beer, that's for sure. Is this a beer that you could have one or two whilst sitting in front of a fire, reading a book, watching some late night television while it is cold outside? Of course it is. But I think there are a lot of winter-specific beers that are better suited and not as possessing in hops; I would probably rank this above the overly-sweet barley wines and over coffee'd/roasted malt'd stouts because it most certainly is a nice and unique interpretation of an old ale; it just goes back to the adage of why mess with a good thing. I almost find myself wishing that Great Divide had kept the recipe a little closer to the classic style with this one. This is my first Great Divide beer, and I'm nothing if not excited to see what they do with their other styles. Nothing if not a beer that makes you think.","bigeyedfish","Dec 19, 2007"

Within the flavor you get chocolate, brown sugar along with a spice that I couldn't quite put my finger on.

Pretty sweet all the way through with hints of dark fruits. A booze flavor appears midway and warms the soul. Aftertaste finishes with an oak flavor and a bittering effect that actually leaves the mouth pretty dry. Mouthfeel is a bit rough around the edges.

The beer is so dark red in color it is almost brown but when held to the light it reveals itself. Nice, pillowy, khaki-colored head. The smell holds true with a sweet, full chocolate, tootsie roll and candy aroma, with slight alcohol fumes in the back; it smells fantastic! The taste is malty, cocoa powder but does not quite match the smell, which is good in my opinion. The alcohol is hiding and the mouthfeel is neither thick nor thin. I am still undecided as to whether or not I should buy more for cellaring this year since I still have several 2006 bottles. This is a very malty beer and good for a cold day such as today. Im surprised this is not in bombers or four packs but I am not going to complain because a sixer for $8 is a very good value. Drinkability suffers a little as I did not want another.","ArrogantB","Sep 25, 2007"

The taste provides a little surprise because there is a mild but crisp hops bitterness as well. The mouthfeel is rich and the flavors are beautifully balanced. I did not detect much alcohol in the taste. Drinkability here is 2 12 ouncers, any more would be self defeating for flavor and functioning. I had this one on a fairly cool summer evening.

The nose a terrific depth; nutty, dark cherries, chocolate malts, oaky, and caramelized brown sugar. Taste is just as deep with semi-tart dried dark fruits, cocoa powder, roasted figs and a great hop balance. Hops reveal some spices up front and some perfumy florals in the middle that gain ground in the end. More buttery caramel tones smooth out some of the alcohol that was bigger at the beginning although never really a problem. Full bodied and a chewy, slightly syrupy mouthfeel reveals hints of carbonation around the edges.

The stunning clarity showcases an abundance of tiny, effervescent bubbles rising to meet a creamy pale tan head that raises just over two fingers. Thick and lasting retention leaves a stubborn coating of lace. Impressive aroma of Dark crystal malt, roasted chestnuts, chocolate, and a strong peachy grapefruit rind hop volatiles. Darkened caramel strikes the tounge first, followed by a mellow charred taste and a slight grainy flavor- almost nutty. Toasted crystal sweetness follows over into the semi-dry aftertaste, which is then dominated by citrusy, piney and grassy american hop flavor. Bitterness is acidic enough to balance the powerful malt profile, but does not linger as long and the malt is allowed to dominate. The mouthfeel is full, and rich with tannins and dextrins that threaten at cloying, but are broken up by the fine carbonation. Finishes with residual notes of chocolate, roasted barley, and caramel, and fairly matched by resinous hop oils that gently fade away. The depth of character here suggests a higher alcohol level, but despite the viscosity and robust taste, the last swigs seem as sober as the first.","PBRstreetgang","Feb 08, 2007"

While always a consistent brew, Hibernation shows plenty of variety in the nose each year given the hop availability, and yet it has resisted becoming overly-hoppy as has been the trend for many brewers. Plenty of zip to the aromatic hops used, and if you were to pour it side by side with a Full Sale Amber a newcomer to craft ales wouldn't make the connection until the alcohol kicked in. Notes of toffee, citrus, and fruitcake / fresh bread. Roasty malt notes are also a highlight, and there's some of the oily viscosity I appreciate in a wee heavy. Finish is clean and farily dry, with a touch of rum aromatics toward the end. A substantial, warming brew at 8.1% ABV, and the one brew from GD that I really missed when we couldn't get 'em for a couple of years once way back when.

Initial taste is a nice hoppiness, some piney hoppiness followed by a good size dose of smokey, new leather and burnt rubber. Alcohol is well balanced and makes only a small appearance in a warmth at the finish. Medium in body, low amount of carbonation, and a nice hoppy, puckering dryness in the finish. I enjoyed the good dose of hoppiness and although the smokey flavor was quite strong I'm interested to see if a little age might allow the smoke to become more dominant through from start to finish.

The finish had a light hop bitterness along with some burnt grain. Mouthfeel was medium on the palate. Alcohol was present but not overly so. This brew reminds me more of a Scotch ale due to the smoky character. A pretty solid offering and one that I believe would benefit from some cellaring.

There's some sediment at the bottom and it builds a half-inch khaki head that sticks fairly well and retains a collar throughout, leaving some lacing. The aroma is big on roasted/chocolate malts, and there's a hefty dose of citric (orange?) hops to balance. Near the end I find notes of pear, black cherry, and some other kinda berry. The flavor is very much the same, with chocolate, roasted, nutty, and caramel malts predominating, but the hops lend a medium bitterness and green/citric/minty/piney qualities, and there are hints of dark fruits. It has a medium to thick body that is very smooth and creamy, and doesn't let you know how strong the beer is. Overall this is a very well made beer that is complex, yet quite drinkable.

In fact, it actually smells kind of lot like a tootsie roll, I kid you not. Malts and alcohol esters duke it out for top billing with a light hops presence in one corner, but malts are kicking arse with the sweetness in their corner. The sweetness is almost a little too much... almost. The flavor is almost as malt dominant as the nose suggests, with flavors of chocolate, dark bread and toffee. The hops come out nicely on the finish adding a light bitterness and balance. It has a full body, syrupy texture, and moderate carbonation. This is one hell of a desert beer, and if thats what youre looking for, this one is nicely done. Not very sessionable if thats what youre going for, but then again, its a barleywine, so if youre looking for a sessionable barleywine, thats kind a of contradiction right there.","ski271","Mar 19, 2006"

The aroma was a good mix of hops and definite chocolate and coffee notes. The taste was of bold coffee and chocolate and for a non-coffee drinker, this was a very enjoyable beer. The coffee taste is not overpowering and mixes well with the other tastes.

4.12,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"12 oz. 2005 vintage poured into an oversized wine goblet. Glassy mahogany with garnet highlights and a creamy but reclusive beige head. Fruity caramel liquer aroma, like date sugared apples doused in Frangelico but not as nutty. First sip is not as sweet as expected; earthy hops right up front. Sweet almond and black walnut creaminess on the follow-through. Tongue-numbing alcohol buzz -- not surprising at 8.1%. Slick mouthfeel, medium body. It just occurred to me that this would pair quite nicely with a robust Cuban cigar -- it's not so spicy with hops that it would wreck your tongue and not so sweet that the cigar would taste gross. There's an almost smoky nuttiness to this beer that is unlike anything I've tasted before. So there's that if you want to try this one fresh. 10 months in the cellar would mellow this out, probably, and turn it into more of a solitary sipper. When I finish my Ph.D. and start looking for jobs, I'll pay particular attention to openings in Colorado. Great Divide Brewing Co. plays more than a small role in this inclination.","orfeu","Feb 14, 2006"

I think some of the alcohol heat would settle and the flavors could form some kind of union.","mentor","Dec 07, 2005"

The aroma has a ton of sweet malts initially (notes of caramel, bourbon, toffee, turbinado sugar) along with some piney and citrusy hops in the background, along with some cocoa, pecans and almonds, dark fruits and some alcohol. The flavor has some citrusy and piney hops upfront (but more muted compared to when fresh), along with caramel and toffee, rum cake, dark fruits, caramelized pecans, and some alcohol The mouthfeel is really smooth and drinkability is much improved. I'm really digging this with a year on it, the hops have faded and the malts come to the forefront and the alcohol has really mellowed...I've got another bottle I'll leave alone for a year or so to see how this one matures further.","silver0rlead","Dec 06, 2005"

Mild citrus (orange) and spice on the finish. The taste has more of the malt up front, toffee, figs. The hops come out mid-flavor, nice citrus, grass, a little hop flower. The spice wakes up on the finish. Hard to characterize. I think there is some coriander and all-spice. What a great mouth feel. Ive only had this full rich mouth feel in Imperial Stouts and Dubbles.

The body was clear, and the head creamy, one finger thick, and beige in color, and lots of lace, too. The earthy sweet aroma was that of chocolate, hazelnuts, and toffee, all standard fare for a Strong or Old Ale. The taste was sweet and mellow, with a brown sugar and vanilla flavor up front, a hint of mocha, which was followed by a nutty character. The hops were more noticeable with the classic Great Divide flair, and added an extra layer of citric and leafy complexity. The beer was velvety smooth in texture with a lingering faintly woody aftertaste. Well crafted beer that felt more vigorously drinkable than the other stodgy examples of this style.","rajendra82","Nov 21, 2005"

Needs some more bitterness. Plastic-coated big body really ruins this beer for me, which is too bad considering that I was digging the aromas and flavors.","waughbrew","Nov 21, 2005"

Looked fantastic. The smell was nice with a bit of malt and loaded with hops. Not my cup of tea, but still I thought it had a pleasant smell, hoppy or not. The taste? If you are a hop fanatic, then I highly recommend you try this of out. I am not a hop fanatic, so I'll finish this 6 pack off and never ever buy this again. Very very hoppy. Bitterly so, perhaps "perfume like". The only thing I did enjoy about the taste was that it seemed to me to have a bit of a toasted malt-like finish. Don't know if that is indeed what I am tasting, but that is the only way I can describe it. The mouth feel was quite smooth and easy to drink with little carbonation, and at 8.0+abv, they did a nice job concealing the alcohol.

It smells of fig and malts with hints of chocolate, caramel and some alcohol. The taste is comlpex yet well balanced and appealing. It has a sweet malt start with a lightly hopped, crisp, slightly acidic finish. There are also some woody flavors mixed with a fruity fig/raisin taste. It has a subtle alcohol warming as well. The palate was full-bodied and creamy. Overall, a terrific winter warmer found late in the season. This is up there with Anchor OSA as my favorite of the season.","Beaver13","Jan 28, 2004"
3.83,-4.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall Impression: This beer is true to style, but the overall taste just doesn’t rock my boat. I may have started it a bit too cold, because my opinion really warmed as the beer did. While I’m going to give this beer fairly high marks, it just isn’t my cup of tea. I like big beers, and old ales, but the flavor just didn’t match my taste buds. I think I’ll try next year’s version and revisit my review.","HardTarget","Jan 09, 2004"
4.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability - With such a full body, it's hard to imagine putting many of these away in one sitting. This is an excepitonally smooth sipping beer. A great winter beer from Great Divide.","filabrazilia","Dec 27, 2003"

4.32,7.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Deep garnet color with a foamy tan head. Nice retention and additionally attractive trails of lace down the glass. Biscuity malt, resinous hops, toffee and chocolate notes resonate in the nose. Additional emphasis on toffee, caramel, ripe fruit and unsweet chocolate linger on the palate along with a rich, earthiness induced by the addition of piney, sappy hops. Warming alcohol presents itself on the long finish. Sweet malt flavor dominates, however, and will continue to do so as this beer matures. Chewy mouthfeel is smooth, round and full. A nice, complex and warming old ale in the British tradition. This beer, while drinking quite well young, could certainly stand to be laid down to mellow further. A perennially solid achievement from Great Divide -- this year is no exception.","Jon","Nov 23, 2003"
4.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"I'm drinking a 2002 vintage I've been keeping for nearly a year. Looks and smells great. Cloudy motor oil colored murky stuff with a bit of floating chunks. I suppose the taste is pretty great (see the other beer freaks' descriptions...most of whom I agree with), and the only reason I don't rank it higher is that there's a metallic taste to the beer that's a bit hard to ignore. May be that it doesn't keep more than 6 months or so. It seems to be a hyperspiced old ale in the most general sense, though, so I anticipated it would keep better. I'll try it again this year, as should you, dear reader. Maybe it takes a couple of years for it to optimize?","BeerBard","Oct 24, 2003"

4.38,9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I have to finish my winter beers before I put in the air conditioner. I do like this one, a pretty, deep reddish brown brew with a tan/orange head. The aroma is a complex malt ( brown sugar,molassas) and earthy, citrus hop. The body is a very drinkable medium to full with a very nice finish of roasted/nutty malt. The flavors are very complex too. This one has chocolate and tobacco with baking spices (esp. cinnamon,nutmeg and ginger) with a little earthy hop flavor elbowing it's way in. This is a nice winter warmer (or evening sipper in spring) that has a balanced sweet and spicy flavor that hides the alcohol well. And it went really well with Swiss chocolate.","jeffboo","May 19, 2003"
3.85,-4.2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Dark amber/brown with a very thick light tan head. Aroma is toasty and malty. Somewhat rich body, it started out strong with roasted malt and sticky sweet caramel and gradually phased into a more bitter hops and grapefuit presence. Good warmer to start but becomes almost too bitter by the end. Still the best from Great Divide I have tried so far.","Dogbrick","Apr 28, 2003"
4.52,12.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights. It forms an off-white head with excellent lacing. The aroma is sweet malt, fruity, date-like, and bready. Excellent aromas. The flavors are fig and dates, with a nice breadiness. It is a medium-full bodied beer, with a semi-sweet finish and a slight bitterness that lingers. I found this to be an excellent beer.","BeerBuilder","Apr 25, 2003"

A hint of fusel alcohol, a bit of bubble gum, sweet malt, caramel, fresh and inviting, a real pleasure to sniff this one, start is sweet malt, the top middling in feel. Finish is perky in its acidity, the hops straight forward in their spicy bite, dry and a real treat. A bit of alcohol warming as it hits the tummy, a fine beer at any rate.","Gusler","Apr 17, 2003"

Im glad I took his trade offer for I sure would of missed a true beer gem. Great Divide's limited edition brew was not available in Ohio, at 8% abv, until now. I think the brewer sums it up best as a robust ale. It pours a deep mahogany with a nice off-white head and lots of sticky lace. The aroma of hop over alcohol with hints of roasted malts and nut. This is a stick to your ribs brew that the taste and mouthfeel reflect. Its a full bodied, smooth, yet robust, well balanced blend of toasted malts, hints of nutty chocolate topped off with assertive hops to warm the chest. A great winter warmer that can be enjoyed now or later. If you like to cellar or collect for later, this is a gotta-a-have!!","chilidog","Mar 01, 2003"
2.92,-27.4,4.5,2.5,3,3.5,2.5,"Huge cream colored head which almost had a pinkish hue. The whipped looking foam raised itself almost 2/4 inch above my shaker glass before settling into the beer leaving a rocky top capping the deep red beer with millions of tiny particles in suspension. Nose of the beer consisted of a sweet and sour malt with some subtle hints of hops and toasted grains. Slick, sour malt flavor with some charcoal hiding in the background. Im not sure if this beer was bad, but it sure was sour. It did get sweeter as my mouth became acclimated to the acidity. Ill have to come back to this one.","yen157","Feb 18, 2003"
4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a brownish chestnut color with a creamy off-white colored head that fades into a bubbly lace. Nose is sweet malts and buttery caramel blended with some spicy hops. Fairly full-bodied with a creamy and chewy texture. Taste is toasted sweet malts at first quickly followed by notes of rich buttery toffee, caramelized fruit, and dark chocolate. Raw hop leaf flavors come through in the end to balance out the sweetness very nicely. A thoroughly enjoyable belly warmer for a cold day.","Morris729","Feb 15, 2003"
3.78,-6,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Bottled 2002: Pours a clear but dark brown/amber color with a nice 2-finger light tan head. The smell of sweet buttery muffins and a light malt aroma are quite nice. But sometimes this much of a buttery smell means too much of a diacetyl taste. Lets hope not! The taste is a strong alcohol taste along with a cough medicine flavor, butterscotch, and also light hops. Perhaps aging would help. Its definitely not at all bad and it has a medium-bodied creamy mouthfeel and a definite warming effect, its just a bit raw as is and that is going to affect my drikability score. Id like to age a bottle of this for about a year and then try this again. It has a lot of potential! Cheers!","BeerAngel","Feb 13, 2003"
4.15,3.2,4.5,4.5,4,3,4.5,"Bottled 2002. Clear ruby hue, topped by a well retained light beige head that leaves spotty foam. The aroma is dominated by a deep melange of floral and lightly citrusy hops with a mild undertone of earth. Perhaps a combination of Goldings and Willamette. Caramel malt morphs into a berryish red licorice fruity sweetness towards the end. Trace butterscotch. Concomitantly estery, caramelly and redolently hoppy aromawise. Flavorwise, a combination of fruity and medium lovibond caramel malt sweetness is perceived upfront, then yields to mellow impressions of dry roasted nuts. Mild diacetyl complements the malt profile, lending a subtle brittle like impression. Pleasant raspberry like esters couples with residual sweetness, yielding a lately emerging candied fruit impression. Hop bitterness is mild, and attempts balance, but malt sweetness prevails. Lightly bodied, perhaps deceptively so, and consequently quaffable. Finishes simply sweet at first, with lingering hints of buttery malt. Hibernation ale is a very enjoyable brew. Complex and flavorful, but a notch shy in body. One of the most drinkable strong ales I've had thus far. Big thanks to Jaybeerman for the bottle.","marc77","Feb 05, 2003"

4.7,16.9,5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"This is a great beer fresh out of the store, but I really think it improves with even a year's time. It pours a nice deep copper color, with an ample, creamy, light tan head. The head retention is excellent... I had at least a quarter inch of head the entire time, which didn't just leave behind a lace. No, it leaves behind sheets of foam on the side of the glass. I would say the carbonation is medium to low, which is fine, because the mouthfeel is also quite impressive, being very thick, velvety and creamy. I think that a higher carbonation would detract from that. Flavor was sweet, and malty, with chocolate and toast, and some faint fruits. There may be a slight sourness as well, so I'm not sure how much longer I'd keep this beer around the house. The hops had really changed character from my memory of a fresh Hibernation. One year later, the hops plays a much smaller role, but is still present to help offset a cloying finish. Man, this was a great beer, but, my review may be somewhat biased since it came as such a great surprise not to be drinking nasty soured beer. Tomorrow, I'm going to go find some more and have a vertical tasting of this years next to the other '01 Hibernation .","comat0se","Dec 18, 2002"

Slight spice aroma with some sense of a burnished leather.  Mouthfeel is medium with a little "burn" at the swallow.  Flavor is peppery with unsweetened clove and nutmeg mixing with low carbonation to give impact.  Piling on that is an impressive hopping, giving a flavorful bittering that struck me well.  A challenging beer, if you like clove gum and a little alcohol warming, here's a beer for you.  I'm going to cellar a bottle to see if it mellows.","ADR","Oct 18, 2002"
