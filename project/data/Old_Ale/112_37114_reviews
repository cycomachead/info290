"This lived up to my expectations. It was excellent."
""
""
"Almost the perfect old ale. Looks like it should, ruby with some haze. Smells great, caramel, vanilla, sweet. Taste is much the same with backend booziness. Just ever so slightly undercarbed in my opinion, but can't complain. Great beer."

"Never had a beer like this. Tastes like a slightly carbonated tawny port. Wish I had another bottle to cellar"

"O - A middle of the road bourbon barreled ale.  About what you would expect for their base beer after some time in a bourbon barrel.  A little pricey for a 500ml bottle."
""
""
"I find North Coast's Old Stock Ale to be really raw and boozy, but this brandy barrel-aged version transformed the base beer into something magical. I look forward the next release of this, whenever that may be."
"- 5 oz. pour from 500mL bottle into Russian River tulip on 1-Feb-15"

"Overall its a world class beer. There are few, if any, better examples of an old ale, let alone one aged in brandy barrels. The brandy character is incredibly unique which makes this beer truly one of a kind. If you see it, get it immediately. If you have one, drink it. If you have two, let the other one sit for 1 to 3 years for this beer to reach its potential as a never before seen animal."

"500ml pour into New Belgium globe glass. Pours a dark cherry. Very little head that dissipates quickly. Smell is boozy with notes of dark fruit, some vanilla and caramel. The first sip is full of brandy flavor that leads to a mild caramel taste.  Due to the strong boozy taste after the first sip I was unsure if I was up to drinking the whole bottle but after a few sips the drinkability improves. Overall a fantastic beer, I found it at a bottle shop in rural New Jersey and am very glad with the purchase. A very complex and enjoyable beer that I would certainly try again."

"So we had the chance to purchase a 1/6 bbl at the restaurant I work at for a reasonable price of $439 for 1/6bbl ...to keep our cost under 30% we would have had to charge $25 for a 10oz pour!!!! hell even Dogfish 120 or WWS is less than $200 for a 1/6 barrel"

"O: While barrel aging has been all the rage in the Craft beer segment for years, finding a brandy barrel aged beer is still very much a rarity. It's a welcome change of pace from the ubiquitous bourbon barrel aging. In this case the brandy flavors are the focal point of a beer whose base flavor profile complements them most graciously. The sweet, sticky, malty, and vinous flavors of the old ale are a perfect springboard for a dominant brandy barrel character. This is a gratifying and complex sipper that offers a very unique experience. It has an upper-class air about it. I actually prefer it to bourbon barrel aged old stock. Worth the high price tag."
""
"Drink- I was surprised I didnt have to trade for this one. Was great to finally find a top 250, just sitting on the shelves. Would love another bottle to hold onto for a couple years. Was a layered and pretty complex drinking BA beer."

"2011 vintage. First time having this and I am so pleased to have come across it. Deep brown color with moderate carbonation. Head dissipates completely in approximately 60 seconds. Dark fruits, sugary sweetness! Nectar of the Old Ale gods! The taste is so balanced with the brandy influence definitely there but refined and subtle. Absolutely perfect drinking experience and I must have this one again!"

"O: Probably the best beer of its style that I've had. It's similar to Bois, Arctic Devil and Mother of all Storms but so much smoother. Such a freaking good beer!"
""
""
"A sipper & I keep sipping & sipping & wishing this came in a 750ML bottle. North Coast has certainly nailed the art of the hellaciously expensive beer that sticks around due to the price tag - but is ultimately worth it once as a treat. Would I buy another? No. Am I happy I danced for one? Yeah. Excellent beer."
""
""

"Overall, this was a very good beer and I am happy I finally had it. It's very complex and has a lot going on with it. The barrel flavors are incredible. I wish I could have this more often."

"T: Pretty sweet upfront. Brown sugar, vanilla, toffee and burnt caramel. The toffee is probably the strongest note I get here and it slowly fades into a burnt raisin skin note near the middle. The beer gets drier and drier as it goes, finally ending in a slightly hot finish with big notes of brandy, maple syrup and pronounced oak. There's a good amount of carbonation in here, leading me to want to assume this beer is far less than 15%. A quick attempt to get out of my chair leads me to believe otherwise, though. Ridiculously well done."

"2011 Vintage. Pours a nicely carbonated dark, brownish red color with a small, off-white head. Scent is STRONG in booze. A ton of hot brandy and other whiskey aromas. Tons of dark fruits with a whole lot of malt. Lots of vanilla and a hint of toffee. More sweet brandy...this beer smells spectacular. Taste is just as good as the beer smells. Boozy brandy and oaky barrel flavors up front. Sweet brandy and vanilla flavors. Lots of dark fruits...plums, raisins, prunes, and dates. Wow, this thing is boozy. Lingering maple syrup on the tongue. Mouthfeel is a bit over-carbonated...but doesn't lose points for this. Very full-bodied. Drinkability is high, but a sipper. Overall, this beer is fantastic! Very hot, but I can't wait to see how this ages over the years."

"O: One big, stinging, fruity old ale. Sharp, sharp strong flavors and borderline overpowering booziness. I am well accustomed to boozy brews but this one is serious. A true sipper; 500ml is almost too much (thankfully it's not a 750, are you listening The Bruery?). Seriously big and seriously good. One of the very best Old Ales out there. I will also note that this significantly better than the bourbon barrel version, in my opinion."

"Bottle from the grocery store. Very excited to find this one. Corked and caged 500 ml 2011 year poured into my FW Teku glass on Feb 1, 2014. Pours dark brown with a slight red hue and a one finger yellowish brown head. Big time sweet brandy aroma with lots of nuttiness and brown sugar, maybe a little cocoa. Very much like a pralines smell. Big bold brandy flavor with plenty of nuts and brown sugar. Caramel, marshmallow, toffee wow. This is impressive. Lots of sweet brown sugar but balanced by some nutty bitterness. Body is heavy and slightly boozy but lightened by a surprisingly large amount of carbonation. I recently had Bois (bourbon) and this beer reminds me a lot of that, albeit with less vanilla flavors. A very nice after dinner treat."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was very pleasantly surprised with how good this was. Would love to try this with a bit more age, but already great. Wow, very good."
""
""

"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, bread pudding, brandy, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with brown sugar, toffee, and brandy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of wood bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with absolutely phenomenal brandy barrel aged aromas and tasty flavors that unfortunately don't match up to the smell."

"Pours a very dark amber highlighted with ruby hues capped by a one and half finger beige head that dissipates fairly quickly. Little to no lacing. Huge vanilla notes, oak, butterscotch, and booze on the nose. Opens with vanilla, butterscotch, brown bread, general nuttiness, hints of toffee and leather, as well as dates and dark fruit midpalate. Finishes with oak, accents of fig, strong brandy booziness, and vanilla. Fairly syrupy smooth full body, very low carbonation. Wow, brandy barrels and Old Stock Ale are as solid a combination as one might expect. Absolutely exceptional."
""
""
"Overall - The barrel is very nice. Vanilla is one of the best components of the brandy barrel and it augments this beer well."
""
""
"The beer is a deep, dark, chestnut hue with a soft, fluffy beige head. The aroma is wonderful, offering scents of toffee, caramel, oak, booze, vanilla. Wow, what flavor! A delightful beer to sip. Brandy character comes in late, lingering on the palate between drinks. Although there is certainly an alcohol presence, this beer is silky smooth and elegant. 15.2% and something I could sip on for hours. Wonderfully complex, delicious, well-balanced. A world-class beer."
""
"Yup, this was definitely worth the wait."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is incredibly complex and it reveals a lot of aromas, tastes and texture in short order. It's put together beautifully as all the flavors strike the right place on the mouth and at the right time. The fruitier and spicier taste from brandy barrels give the ale something unexpected and truly majestic!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the best beers I've EVER had. Served in a snifter is the best way to enjoy this. The Brandy in this is just KICKIN! A sipper in every sense of the word, a beer to be enjoyed during the cold months, paired with a fine cigar, or as a digestif after a gourmet dinner. Absolutely marvelous."
""
""
""
""
"Lots of sherry like aroma, dark fruits, caramel, brandy (yes you can actually detect brandy), it's a tad bit sweet, but it hides the alcohol completely (alcohol is not detected)."

"O: Letting this sit around warm up to room temperature really opened up a great bouquet of flavors. The minimal oxidation gave it a sherry like flavor to it and a nice sweetness as well. Most personal whales disappoint, this did not."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a mild level of carbonation that really worked in this offering. The ~15% abv is masterfully hidden. It wasnt until I finished my glass and stood up that the strength really hit me. For that reason, coupled with such a low level of carbonation being very enjoyable, I have to give this a perfect ""feel"" rating. This was a solid experience that I was very appreciative of. I am a big fan of the base beer and this was quite a treat. Big thanks to you Heath despite making my face numb with this treat right at the start of a tasting."
"This was another treat from the cellar that I was finally able to get around to and share. There was a little oxidation present in the nose and taste but it seemed to mostly mingle well with that sweet and smooth mix of Old Ale and brand barrel and I can’t stress enough how damn drinkable this was for the size! I really hope that they make this again, as I’d probably even be willing to pay the high price that North Coast now charges for their special release beers."

"O - Good beer. Not hot at all, dangerously drinkable. Would like to see them make some more of this."
"D - I've had this a few times over the years, and it's never blown me a away. I certainly don't think it's improving, but it doesn't seem to be falling off precipitously either. North Coast - please make a new batch. Pretty drinkable for the ABV, and a moderate improvement over regular Old Stock."
"O: This is certainly holding up well, and I am very happy I got to try this rare bottle."
"375 ml bottle. 2005 vintage. Big thanks to Mark for opening this one up. Pours a dark caramel color with pretty much no head and no lacing on the glass. A few big bubbles can be seen at the edge of the glass. The aroma is big brandy with notes of plum, raisin, and vanilla. Hints of coconut and oak as well. A little bit of alcohol, but nothing overwhelming. The taste is sweet with brandy and grape, followed up by some vanilla, coconut, oak, caramel, and some raisin. A bit of brown sugar as well. A bit of alcohol warmth on the finish, as expected for a nearly 15% ABV. Medium body. Very low carbonation, but it certainly works well for this beer. Overall, an amazing beer and I am glad to have tried it."
"D - Went down really easy. Candy booze. I had to restrain myself just downing it. Really well aged and delcious. Wish I had a bottle of my own or they made more. A must try."
"D-decent and reasonably balanced. it is very sweet and might be slightly oxidized. solid flavors that blend together, love the raisins. decent stuff and goes down smooth with the huge body."
"Edit: Review 300."
"J"
"Thanks to Sean(I think) for this one. Drank and compared side by side with the bourbon version. The bourbon was clearly superior to me, and I believe that was the consensus among the group as well... The aroma on the bourbon is awesome, dominates the brandy, vanilla, wood, dark brown sugar. The brandy is harsher, more bitter acohol..The taste is alcoholic brandy, just doesn't work that well. A little caramel and chocolate."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a small ring of bubbles that are not as fine as I expected. Big, big nose on this one. Good amount of leather and leafy tobacco, sweet brandy, nice charred oak, raisins. Sharper carbonation on the tongue than I had expected. Very rich, focused on that old tobacco, leather, kind of a nice sweet brandy. Delicious. Mouthfeel is strange -- it's quite thick and almost syrupy but has really pringly carbonation, seems like around the edges. One of the better barrel-aged barleywines I've had for sure."
"D - Very good but didn't blow me away. This one was out-shined by several other beers we had during the night. I think some more cellar time would do this one good while the bourbon version seems ready to drink now."
"D: The girlfriend wasn't a big fan of this, so I wound up enjoying most of her pour, too. I had no trouble putting down a lot of it, though obviously it's big beer and not something I SHOULD be drinking a lot of. If it came out again, I'd get it, no questions. Hopefully they won't charge $20 a pint or whatever they were asking for Old Rasputin XII."
"This one is most definitely a sipper that shows every bit of its high ABV. The flavor profile and complexity present here are outstanding. I wish I had some notes to compare this to a fresh bottle, but this is the only time I've tried it. I can't see why this one wouldn't continue to mellow and improve for years to come."
"The feel is thick but smooth. The warm finish and nice toffee sweetness are truly an accomplishment for a beer this big. The balance is absolutely insane, and I really would like to have another shot at this one."
"Overall this is one amazing beer, and definitely the best Old Ale I've ever had, and the barrel aging of this beer was done perfectly."
"4.5/4.5/4/4.5/4.5"
"D: Absolutely incredible. Big thanks again to mcallister for getting this one out to me. Fairly low alcohol on an extremely complex beer. This has aged wonderfully, and I would be very happy to try it again in the future."
"Absolutely F'ing tremendous. Unbelievable butterscotch, toasted pecan and toffee, vanilla, super sweet caramel and some very subdued sour notes. I can not stress how incredible this beer has aged. So mellow and balanced. God, I need more of this beer. Beermails sent."
"D: Crazy good. Dakine I have a man crush on you."
"Pretty good drinkability. I mean I'm not going to chug something like this, but I wouldn't have any problem polishing off (that is, drinking, not cleaning) a bottle."
"Drinkability: Incredibly drinkable for such a high alcohol content. You definitely want to sip, but I could sit their for a week straight sipping this beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied . Luscious and complex. This is simply an amazing brew and I must say Old Stock lends itself beautifully to well cared for barrel aging. One of the best beers I've had the chance to sample to date."
"D: A friend aged it till 2009; really smooth given the abv. Great beer overall"
"Chestnut body with a thin layer of tan foam. The head recedes to a thin ring pretty quickly, but the legs on this beer are outstanding. Incredibly viscous stuff. The aroma is a melange of toffee, dates and vanilla. Brandy is readily apparent and lends a slight booziness that compliments the dark malts nicely. As it warms up, I get red grapes, brown sugar and a hint of sweet soy sauce. On the tongue it's rich, full-bodied and sweet, with flavors of brandy and oak supported by a huge caramel malt backbone. Light fruitiness mid-palate leads to a semi-sweet vanilla finish. Tannins add just the right level of balance, preventing this from becoming cloying despite the richness and high ABV."
"The beer is medium bodied. The carbonation is low, but I think it's near perfect for the style and ABV. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with some viscosity. The drinkability is very good and while I was enjoying this I had to fight the urge to gulp my 6.34012925 ounce pour."
"Great Old ale I do really appreciate the style more and more. I had an awesome time celebrating the 4th while sipping away at this great American brew. I would defiantly seek out another I think it was well worth the price"
"D: The ale is hot but never reveals its ~15% price tag. The brandy really works amongst the malty depths of the Old Stock."
"Big chewy body with complimentary carbonation and a boatload of warming alcohol give this brew a to die for drinkability in my book. This brew is the closest thing to Angel's Share and that's a great thing. Seek, savor and enjoy this big ass brew if given the opportunity...serious stuff!"
"I realize this is getting harder to come by if not impossible to get. If you have one, consider yourself lucky, find some friends and share the bottle."
"What a nose!!! Black grapes, blueberry, light oak, warm alcohol, and sweet toffee and chocolate. Fantastic. Not all that impressive looking though. The pour is brown with some red hues, and a quickly fading soapy tan head. Wonderful flavors. I've always thought brandy barrels are the way to do with barley wine, and this is the best example. Great grape, wood, toffee, chocolate flavor with a bit of warm alcohol to make sure you know what you are drinking. Medium body. Mouth filling. Average carbonation. Just enough to be a complement. Average finish. I'd like it to hang around for a bit longer. Really though. I really can't think of what else I'd want in such a beer. Its a damn shame that its so difficult to come by."
"Flavor is vanilla, caramel, brown sugar and some toffee, no hops to be found. Only a little bit of warmth making this a dangerously easy 14.7% drinking beer. I really enjoyed this and wish I had another, but wouldnt drink more than one in a setting and was glad to split this one with a friend."
"In a word perfect. This beer was soo sublime in every way it is hard to put into words. The pour was wonderul. From the rich caramel color that came out of the bottle to the nice puff of off white that graced the top, it was just spot on for the style. The aroma was loaded with brandy and vanilla notes. Hints of oak and rich toffee notes are just all over this one. Smooth as could be with hardly a hint of alcohol even as it approaches 12 percent, is an achievment in of itself. The vanilla and toffee notes in here were sublime. Perfect balance here of flavors as the I sat and enjoyed this one till almost 2 am at this point and I still have a half glass to go. This was exactly what I wanted, just what it should be, and well, well worth the wait."
"3.1/5"
"Head quickly jumps to a three finger carmel grouping of very active bubbles and then fades just as quick leaving not a trace of those bubbles. Body is a very deep dark brown and quite consistant like molasses, but not nearly as thick. Nose is big and full of rich bourbon, sweet toffee, buttered rum and hot carmalized malts. Alchol is very evident as you take first sip, its not overly harsh just a little warm and tingley. Toasty layers of carmalized malt, toffee, overly ripe dark fruit, molasses and black vanilla are all over the palate. A bit of spicy coco is there too. Alchol is warm on the palate and the belly. The more you drink, the more you pick up the oak character in the palate. Mouthfeel is like sucking on a piece of butter rum candy. Oh so good after dinner sipper. Why do these one time release beers have to be so good?"
"In the final reckoning, I'm unable to pick a winner between bourbon-aged Old Stock and brandy-aged Old Stock. They're both fantastic and they both deserve to be released again. Consider yourself fortunate if you were able to lay your hands on either one. Thanks to the incredibly generous Talisker for providing me with both."
"This is a great, great beer and very drinkable for the ABV. Quite simply, one of the best beers I've ever had. Can't thank Damian enough for this rare gem."
"Delicious, nice creamy mouthfeel."
"Notes from and tasted on 4/27/08"
"Pours a hazy reddish brown, caramel coloured, thin tan head forms, settles to a medium ring around the glass, drops some decent lace spots on the glass. Smell is wow, brandy, thick toffee, cake, alcohol, lots of fruit, raisins/figs, wood, vanilla, port, very rich, fantastic. Taste is amazing as well, figs and rum raisins, buttery toffee, oak, brandy, dark fruits, alcohol, very intense and rich flavour, touch of vanilla, wood and brandy in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, some warmth going down but the ABV is well hidden. Reminds me a lot of the brandy barrel Angels Share. This is insanely good stuff. I would kill to get more. Thanks a ton Dave, you're the man!"
"Pours a hazy dark amber to brown in color with a small light tan head that recedes to a ring. Strong brandy aroma immediately wafts up, alcohol, apples, raisins and prunes mix together in the aroma. A sweet sugary caramel rides behind the dark fruit aromas, hints of leather are noticeable as well. Taste is similar to the aroma in that the brandy is big and right up front in the taste as well. When mixed with the sweet malts it lends a coconut-y flavor, sweet, nutty dates towards the finish. Large bite of alcohol in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is medium in body, thins towards the finish as a drying alcohol warmth burns at the back of the throat. Very good beer, it's been a while since I sampled the bourbon, but I believe I preferred that one, though the brandy ageing shines through quite well in most aspects of this sample. A delicious beer for a goodnight night cap."
"One of, if not the best beer I've had in 2008. Incredibly complex aroma that gives notes of raisins, figs, caramel, toffee from the base beer as well as added dimensions of brandy soaked wood, vanilla and coconut from the oak. Flavor consists of chocolate, caramel, brandy, coconut, vanilla, dark fruit. Port-like character. Chewy and beyond rich. This beer is amazing and a total jaw dropper. Thanks to Steve for sharing."
"Tis' one of the best, this cellar reserve"
"This one is drinking like a cherry mash dream in the STL heat, and the great one sent TWO bottles, so one will be saved for a nice wintery nite in December - maybe Xmas eve!"
"Thought I would like the bourbon barrel version better than this but I was wrong, reminded of the first Angel's Share I tasted in several ways, one of the better old ales I have tasted and the oak aging did wonders for this one, would definitely drink again, hopefully North Coast does something like this in the future, highly recommended"
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, hot on the palate with booze, brown sugar, and vanilla."
"A truly wonderful fusion of flavors, this is probably the best brandy barrel aged beer I've had. The spirit character was more integrated and delicate than other brandy barrel aged beers I've had. Try to get your hands on some of this!"
"d: Huge thanks to rallison for the chance to try this one. I spent more than two hours on this one and, frankly, I could have used a little help. This was my first brandy barrel aged beer and I hope I get to enjoy some more."
"Maybe a bit thin. Lots of warming, lingering alcohol. Still manages to not be boozy or overly hot. This is a fantastic beer, with so much complexity. Very well made."
"Alcohol is definitely a factor. Nice and warming yet not in an obtrusive manner. Although the alcohol may play a factor in the less than full mouthfeel (less than what you would expect from this)."
"D_Very nice sipper here. The potency limits how often I would drink but it is one I would seek out again. This would be nice in front of a fire after a day of cold weather activity."
"Thanks goes to IntriqKen for this one. Pours a darker brown. On the first pour I guess I was going a wee bit too gentle and no head formed. At the end there was a thin creme head though. Nose was strong with alcohol with some wood and a sweet tone mixed in. I got a little worried when I took a whiff because it was leading me to believe it was going to be unbalanced and a bit intense. But hey...that wasn't the case at all. Extremely smooth flavor profile with sherry character and some vanilla and a nice overall sweet tone. Really beautiful. Feel was smooth and a bit slick. Lower carbonation, but it makes no difference. This is really a great beer. Exceptionally made and so smooth to drink. Easily a substitution for any after dinner drink, it also could be a great gateway beer to showcase the possibilities of what can be done. I want more, and I want it now."
"Prosit Und Zum Wohl, MK"
"D. Drinkable? Not in quantity, but this brew makes up for that in deliciousness and complexity. This is one of the best American Old Ales I've had. If you can't afford the $200 for Jim Koch's finest, this is a good second bet. High praise."
"Drinkability is good. A big huge beer that has a lot going on in the flavor department. Yet another excellent crafted beer from North Coast. It looks like I am in the minority though, I like the Bourbon Barrel version better."
"The mix of caramelized malt / wood notes and butterscotch oak character in the nose is incredible. The barrel influence here is huge, but amazingly it marries extremely well with the base beer, or at the least it is not a harsh, overwhelming barrel character. Visually this beer was a bit disappointing with the quickly disappearing head, but when you take into account the alcohol percentage the head was actually quite substantial. I really like that the body of this brew is not overly thick, though this is most definitely a sipping brew; it could use / stand up to a bit more residual malt character though. This really is such a great, flavorful beer, but in the end it is the lack of extra malty oomph that keeps this from being the perfect marriage between barrel and malt. Still a fantastic brew, but at times it can even be a bit thin when compared to the ample brandy barrel notes. Don't get me wrong though, this is a fantastically tasty brew. The fact that the flavors from the barrel are so well integrated and somehow not overwhelming despite being dominant really makes this an incredibly enjoyable brew (pick up the base beer flavors a bit and this would be perfect)."
"A big enjoyable potent beer for a cold night. Deep and dark copper, a tan head disappears instantly. Sharp aroma of brandy is strong but not off putting, this is still a beer. Very smooth, with just the right amount of balance between the regular profile and brandy addition. Full bodied yet not filling. A great sipper for after dinner enjoyment and as a night cap. Outstanding beer from North Coast."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 3/4"" tan head above the cloudy, barely translucent dark reddish brown brew. Head dwindles rather quickly, but still a standout for a BA old brew, with ample slow-falling lacing. Aroma is dark fruity alcohol with leathery maltiness. Taste follows the nose, the malt sweetness upfront, quickly falling to the prevalent alcohol. Not much room for the fruitiness or brandy character with all the alcohol numbing the mouth and throat. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh, but not so much for the BA old ale arena, and drinkability is good as well. Glad I got to try this one."
"Drinkability: An awesome beer. North Coast is playing for keeps! I certainly can't see me ever being able to try this one again and that's just a tad depressing."
"I've spent an hour drinking this and each sip gets better as it warms. In a few years it will score 5's. Can't wait to try the bourbon barrel."
"An excellent beer, beautifully rich and complex. I prefer the bourbon barrel version, but this is still a fantastically well done beer."
"Thank you for this offering."
