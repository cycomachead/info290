"Conclusion: Not all that inspired,  but not bad either. I just drank the bestefar last night and it was a bit odd, but much more complex and intriguing. This is a fine beer, and I wouldn't be disappointed if I brewed it, but I was expecting something a little bit stranger and interesting."

"wow, what an interesting and delicious beer. one heck of a take on holiday beer. dark dark brown in color, hardly any head, but it doesn't need one to impress me. its rich and silky looking, more like a big porter than an American old ale, with minimal light moving through. the nose is oddly smoked, much like the bestefar they make, with some honey sweetness and a huge roasty body, dark and chalky. the taste is similar, with a short lived campfire vibe for a minute before bitter dark, and finally sweet dark malt flavors come in waves. the finish is dry for the looks and style, with a sharp fusel alcohol untidiness. I like the complexity, depth, and richness of this beer an awful lot. not something I could drink a whole lot of, but I surely appreciate its uniqueness. i don't get the tartness others did, this was smooth all the way for me. in what I can only imagine to be freezing cold Norwegian winters, this is a beer I would want to have on hand. I would strongly recommend it for the holiday season here in the usa. it changes what I thought old ale could be, excellent product."

"Very nice. Almosy desert like in richness."

"Overall: A really interesting beer that shows a range of flavor"
"Overall, I do like it a good deal. It's smooth and flavoursome, without being particularly heavy or bombastic. The faint Christmas overtones are there, but they're not overt, and it makes the beer feel more subtle and refined than it might have. Good stuff."
"While I have no idea how this is a holiday beer, I really liked it. It's got a stout or strong porter taste and feel. It's certainly not cheap, but it was very good."
"O: another very enjoyable dark beer from HB - quite satisfying and arguably one of their best dark ales"
"A tasty Old Ale. Good fruit, malt and spice balance and integration,"

"500 ml bottle, Batch 498 (2160 total bottles). Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. It smells like dark fruit (raisins, plums, cherries), chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some berries and spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. I think this is a good overall brew, I might have to pick up another bottle soon! At $8.99 a bottle, I think it's worth trying."

"Pours a dark brown with a thick khaki colored head which leaves some nice lace on the glass. The aroma is of chocolate but then the aroma of sweet dark fruits, raisins, and plums. The taste follows suit, there is a chocolate backbone but then a belgian sweetness takes over before a big deep flavor of dark fruits takes place. There are raisins, plums, and red grapes that dance over the tongue. The mouthfeel is thick and moderately carbonated. Overall this is a very good beer, the taste is big and bold, it is a very complex solid beer."
"Nissefar is a challenged taste that circulates around porter-like roots but with a seemingly forced ""aged"" or ""cellar-like"" character. The result is a stale and uneven Belgian-tasting ""Oude Bruin"" type of beer. No one aspect of the beer seems genuine, but it seems to be an invention unto itself and offers a charming rusticity that's part of the problem and part of the charm."
"O: A balanced holiday ale. 4"
""
"O: I quite liked this beer! It's done well in its two years of bottle life. Recommended. Would have again."
""
"Beer is medium bodied with fairly light, though still noticeable, carbonation, which produces a very smooth and slightly creamy overall mouthfeel. Phenols and ethanol provide very slight spiciness, appropriate for this winter-themed beer. The finish is very dry, again, seemingly on target for a roasted, smoky stout-like ale."
""

"I always appreciate a born on date. But I think I will decide when my beer expires, this was delicious."
"O - As a winter, holiday style the balance was spot on, not to spiced, oily etc. I applaud the group. Well done."
"500 ml, a crazy gusher, beige-brown head and blackish liquid.Keeps on gushing 20 minutes later. Leaves behind enormous foam, that is at once a tasty malt, and also a weak body of licorice and spice. Aroma of licorice porter. OK drinkability, a pint is too much. July 2010 bottling."
""

""
"Overall, what we found to be most enjoyable about this brew was the smoke. At first it was light and souring, making for a cleaner finish, but by the end it became an integral component of the beer’s complexity. Otherwise, this guy is fairly simple, staying true to style, except for a few points when it veered onto the pathway of the porters."
""
""
"If it weren't for the smell, this would be great. As it is, it's still pretty good."
""
""
"Overall: after cleaning up the spillage from the bottle spewing upon opening (it wasn't shaken and was opened at around 55F), I proceeded to sample this bad boy. Definitely a strong beer with a decent balance between the complex flavors and the alcohol content. I don't know if this particular bottle was over-primed, but ignoring the 'exploding' bottle opening fiasco, this is a mighty tasty northern European brew."
"O - Overall this beer was just alright. There are MUCH better old ales out there, and much better offerings from HaandBryggeriet."
""
"O: A lower alcohol old ale, but it works fine. Good flavours, quite the enjoyable effort."
"Between medium and full bodied with low carbonation. Very drinkable...best saved for the end of a session due to the fullness in body."
"Served in a tulip glass, this beer poured a dark brown with a small tan head. Sweet, malty aroma, hints of chocolate, dark fruit, and spice. Taste of dark malts, followed instantly by a huge licorice profile, chocolate chips, and notes of spice and a slightly syrupy booziness in the background. Interesting and tasty. On the heavier side of medium-bodied, and quite drinkable. Definitely worth revisiting."
"Overall an OK beer but not one I will drink again."
"Sample was fresh, brewed Sep. '11. Procured at ØL."

"This brewery is really quite special, everything they do is very unique. This beer pours out as a deerp brown color with a litter brown colored head. The smell of the beer has some chocolatey aromas blended with some dark fruits and stuff. The taste is a little malty, a little sweet and a little dry. The mouthfeel had a decent thickness to it which was nice. Overall this was a pretty good holiday ale. I'd enjoy having it again one day."
"Overall, even though my bottle's ""Best before"" date was three months ago, this is fantastic beer: carefully, lovingly crafted by people who obviously put their hearts and souls into their work. I look forward to my next encounter with this brew--hopefully with a fresher bottle, and on a cold Christmas morning."
"I found this to be a really good porter, very accessible and enjoyable, and the fruit was a welcome surprise and element. Very well done, and I'd love to have more of this and other wares from HaandBryggeriet in the future."
"D-This was past its prime, but hinted at a really solid beer. Will try fresh and re-review."
"OVERALL: Quite enjoyed this Christmas porter. The nose could be a little bigger, but it had plenty of nice flavor and drank away quite easily. I've never had a fresh bottle, but if my previous experience with Haand is any indication, the ageing has mellowed out the carbonation and made it much more drinkable. Worth checking out if you get the chance."
"this was a winter warmer style porter quality beer with a sweetness of a aged hop quality. afterall. the hop was about a year and some old at this pine... but hopping resembled something of a tangerine citrus. nice and sweet chocolate covered citrus. palate was that but not as syrupy as expected. rather lean and quick finish of something some bright. note of tangerine, chocolate, clove, and fruit cake sugar. dessert... and simple fruit character."
"I bought the Nissefar on a whim for Christmas festivities. My family is hosting for the first time ever this year, and I have been running around making everything perfect - a huge tree, decorations, real garlands, candles, yard lights, stockings, fires in the fireplace, eggnog, everything. Who gets to host xmas is a little bit of a contentious point in my family, so I felt a lot of pressure to make things perfect. I made sure to point out the origin of this beer to my Norwegian family, too much probably, but in the end they were busy making gingerbread houses and playing with my son and shopping, and Nissefar ended up turning from one of my holiday touches into my little personal moment of appreciation, and for this purpose it served admirably and lets face it, mouthfeel etc was not even a consideration."
"Big chocolately head with filmy bubbles. Opaque brown liquid. Nice chocolate aroma. Some winter spices and pine in the nose as well. Chocolate sweetness, some alcohol and a finish that reminds me of prune juice. This is a slick, full bodied beer that has low carbonation and an oily coat. It drinks very well. This bottle is about two years old; I imagine that a fresh one would be very impressive."
"A rather one dimensional porter. I was hoping for more of a spice/herbal flavor. The beer needs some life to it."
"Verdict: ALMOST worth the insane price, and definitelt worth trying."
"D: Goes down easily, very tasty not too filling, nice kick, nice representation of style. For me, this is a beer to sit with for a few rounds."
"drinkability is fantastic. i could enjoy it any day, night, or for friggin breakfast. total yum."
"D: this is a unique take on an American Porter. My first brew from Haanbryggeriet, and certainly not my last. The flavor profile begs for a bigger body and a bigger beer, but as it is, it is quite tasty."
"Medium bodied and very quaffable with a nice balance of roasty malt, sweet dark fruit notes and peppery spiciness. The dark fruit notes are prominent with hints of sour cherry, plum, raisin and fig. This is countered by the sightly roasted chocolate/caramel malt flavor resulting in a slight sweet creamy feel mid palate. There's also a good amount of peppery spice with hints of cinnamon and peppermint. I'm also picking up a slight medicinal syrup flavor before a dry and slightly tart finish. Very nice."
"I could drink this once but would not seek it out again. I don't see what is so Xmassy about this compared to the more interesting Xmas beers out there. This is a bit one-themed."
"Probably my least favorite that I've had from HaandBryggeriet, which is all right since the rest have been outstanding."
"Hmmm, is the oldness of the ale giving way, has it lost so much in the 3 months that have passed since it's expiration. But, it's still got plenty of flavor, just has me wondering what else was going on. It's still tasty and spicy, and delicious."
"I am not sure about this beer, the aroma is down right interesting, and not even unpleasant, but the flavor is a little too weird. I could be convinced that this wasn't infected, and the weird notes are simply a product of interesting ingredient selection, but I don't think so."
"Note: Batch 163, Bottled June 2008"
"D - Easy drinking, but only due to the lower-than-average body and thin mouthfeel. Flavors are balanced well but they are just muted and should be allowed to be more prevalent. I prefer bigger holiday ales and this just wouldn't suffice when I am in the mood for a big winter warmer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a nice dark beer with a Belgian twist on it making it worth drinking for a while."
"Overall this beer didn't blow me away but I found it to be very smooth and easy to drink. Worth a shot."
"D: A solidly made, drinkable porter."
"O: Respectable brew with an interesting taste that makes for good conversation, but not ""my thing""."
"Drinkability: Solid and interesting, and though I would try it again, the price and limited availability make me want to go after some more of their other beers instead."
"I was way stoked to find this in my remote town of 800 in SE Alaska, but had no idea what to expect, but this certainly wasn't it. I didn't know until I went to write this review that it was labeled an American Porter. I'm not exactly sure what category I would place it in, but not that one. I enjoyed it more and more as I nursed the sample, but wasn't thrilled upon first sip. I think the most defining feature of this is the moderate but undeniable tart sourness character that has me thinking ""farmhouse."""
"Odd pour- Looked like it was going to be flat with only some big soap bubbles at first. After the pour the beer started cascading like Guinness and did have a very fine creamy small tan head with no lace. Maybe an error in bottle conditoning if they did that? Color is an opaque brownish black with red highlights. Aroma is excellent with roast malt cocoa coffee pine fruit eucalyptus. Flavor doesn't have quite so much going on but similar and still very good. Body isn't bad but the flatness doesn't help. Finish is like flavor. Sure want to try another that's properly carbonated."
"drinkability: ok"
"taste is of dark fruit, cocoa, spice, a little pepper, some smoke, malt, and a few hops, ends somewhat dry."
"This is either something other than an American porter or it is a bad bottle. Pour was a nice, dark brown. Massive tan head. Up front a wine going on vinegar lactic sourness, follwed by some raisin and prune dark fruit flavors. Finish was dry. Kind of hard to get a handle on - blindfolded I would have guessed a Flanders oud bruin or some other aged Belgian sour style."
"Overall, an interesting take on a holiday ale... Went well on a cool late March evening accompanied by some smoked gruyere and wheat crackers..."
"D: Drinkability was decent. Yeasty, slightly sour though a bomber is plenty for me at any given setting. Good for a serving but comes off rather expensive $7."
"This is interesting. I would not call this a porter, though this does have a few years of age. I have not had this fresh, so it is hard to say. Still, this reminds me a lot of Anchors Our Special Ale. In that vain, this is something that is very enjoyable. Recommended."
"The folks at Max's assured me that this was indeed what I was drinking, which has me wondering if they might have tweaked the recipe. My review of this beer on tap is nothing like what I recall from the bottle version I had some time back."
"Pours a three finger beige head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Roasted chocolate nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is roasted chocolate and molasses. Pricey but worth trying at $10.00 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"D: A decent beer for the winter season. I'm glad I tried it, but for $9, I'd rather get a good sixer or a nice 750ml."
"D: Second best beer of New Year's Eve 2009, this one is worth looking for."
"D- im not sure if this is a bad bottle or what. it was a couple years old (sat on store shelf), but still well before the best by date. id be wary of getting this one again, and if i did it would be the freshest bottle i can find. it seemed like it would be a good beer without the oxidation."
"Drinkability is pretty good but the watery feel of this brew makes it just so-so."
"Drinkability: this beer has a nice flavor profile which keeps you interested for the entire bottle. Worth trying this one out."
"D: Very respectable choice to drink by the fire on a winter evening. Excellent warming character to this beer. Not a beer to drink several of in a setting. Better suited to slowly savoring/contemplating. Could have gone for a second, perhaps."
"D - Based on the apperance and the readily apparent lack of carbonation, I was expecting the worst form this beer. I was decidedly wrong. The aroma is quite nice with a well balanced collection of rich, velvety chocolate and spice character, but it only begins to hint at the flavor. The beginning is relatively light and slightly acidic with just some minor caramel flavors, but it comes to life in the finish with a wonderful depth of flavor. There is a dark, bittersweet and earthy cocoa flavor that compares in richness and intensity to only a few other beers that I have ever had. It speaks volumes about this brewery that they have created a beer that is able, at this relatively modest level of alcohol, to display flavors that I have only ever seen in over the top, extreme imperial stouts. What's more, these flavors take on a different sort of clarity and depth because of the light body and relative simplicity of this beer. I think this beer is quite an unusual achievement, or it would be for almost any other brewery, but I have come to expect nothing less than excellence from HaandBryggeriet."
"Holiday ale or not, this one is a decent beer. Pours near opaque black, perhaps very dark brown with light tan head that is rather thick. Nose has a chocolate-whoppers candy sweetness to it. On the palate there's more dark chocolate coffee goodness with enough hops to balance it out so it's not overly sweet. Rather easy drinking for the style."
"certainly brewed with the holiday spirit in mind. not sure what it might pair with food wise...maybe some chocolate covered pretzels?"
"Light to medium body, feels a little thin. This one has its moments, but the taste is just too strange for me to want more. Not really sure what makes this a Christmas beer, and I don't think it was worth it. Interesting to try but I won't be revisiting this."
"Dark malts, sour, very low carbonation, Nissefar is probably not a beer that will make everyone's Christmas wishlist, but I think it's great. The beer pours an opaque coffee black with a very small mocha head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is in the fruity stout/porter malt range with some vanilla, oak and faint souring. The flavor is sweet and sour with a soft hop bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, like drinking a beer pre-carbonation. Nissefar is a different and enjoyable experience if you don't mind some sour in your flat porter."
"Enjoyed this beer but not for the expected reasons...will search elsewhere for true winter ale satisfaction."
"Starts to come to its own as it warms. Matures as a winter warmer, but finishes like a spiced ale or smoked lambic."
"An aggressive pour yields negligible collar and spotty lacing patterns from this dark brown beverage. The smell from the bottle neck was chocolaty but from the pour a highly roasted malt and coffee aroma. The mouth is bright and tangy from a sour character. The first bit of taste flags the burnt and smokey flavor that becomes monolithic. Its equally as tart as the feel. Not my favorite."
"500ml bottle from 8/08. Pours opaque, very dark brown with a small beige head. Strong chocolaty, dark malt on the nose, along with some dark fruit. Slightly tangy. Dark roasty taste, again with plenty of cocoa. Slight sourness that works really well here, surprisingly. Dry finish. Medium, creamy body. Really pleasant-drinking, if unconventional, porter."
"overall - interesting as always i love haand... this may bot be as good as the flemish sour but still worth a a try especially at half off like i got it for :]"
"Nissefar (Father Christmas) is my least favorite of the handful of HaandBryggeriet beers that I've had so far. Sour is desirable in some styles, but it doesn't work at all in this one. Bottom line: barely better than a lump of coal as a stocking stuffer."
"Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, medium-full body. Dry."
"It's a bit past the holidays but still a damn fine beer. So drinkable!"
"Drinks well, there's a little warmth in the finish but it's pretty smooth. Definitely has a different character than most American Porters, and I really dig the risks they took in creating the unique flavor profile. Probably the fruitiest porter I've had yet, great balance though and a real treat. Seek this one out, it's underrated."
"Drinkability: Lovely to quaff, but a bit expensive to drink a lot of."
"pours a hazy dark brown with some sediment in the bottom and absolutely no head and almost no carbonation. Smells strongly of European licorice, bitter chocolate, and deeply roasted grain as well as a touch of sweet malt. Interesting. The taste is quite deep and rich for an American Porter. Less licorice here, but it is still quite noticeable. There is a a fai bit of malty sweetness and some herbal bitterness and molasses. Still, the overall effect is dry, not overly sweet. Rich and delicious. The mouthfeel is smooth, but lacks carbonation and is the tiniest bit sticky as well. A little thick to drink too much of, still, quite interesting."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick, rocky tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful black patent and chocolate malt scent that's dry and earthy with just a hint of sweetness. The taste is decent. It has a smooth, yet almost soda like feel. It's thick with loads of malt complexity. There is a weird tangy, bitterness to it. The mouthfeel is just above average. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I just can't get over the thick, almost flat beer aspect. This is an interesting beer. The malt bill seems right on and the appearance rocks, but the mouthfeel really ruins it for me."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle (Batch 169, brewed Aug. 08) and served in a snifter. This beer poured jet black with a few cola colored highlights near the edges and a thin head of bubbly, tan foam. Minimal lacing. The aroma consisted of roasted malts, baker's chocolate, and some slightly vinous dark fruits. The flavor included charred malts, chocolate covered cherries, plums, and a hint of underlying toffee. A nice, mellow roastiness lingers but is not bitter or overpowering. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and slick/oily. Light carbonation. An interesting Christmas brew. The flavor is a bit vinous and full of dark fruit, but it is also rich and malty."
"the drinkability is quite good. it's one of those beers you keep in your hand until it's finished, which is undoubtedly fairly quickly. i wish i had picked up another bottle. this isn't even i style i'm that fond of, but this is a must try."
"The aroma is sweet and toasty with fruit, hops, and coffee. It reminds me of a porter. Three is also a hint of soap. The appearance is dark brown with a smooth tan head that is very persistent. The flavor is just like the aroma. The palate is thick. Overall a nice beer. I just dont like the acidic finish."
"Smooth, full mouthfeel with little carbonation, although the flavors are well enough restrained that the bubbles aren't missed. I'm impressed with this take on the porter, even if it's not exactly what an American Porter is normally like."
"Poured like rusty stagnant black rain water from an old pipe. Absolutely no head whatsoever even after a rather assertive pour in hopes of getting some kind of foamy cap...nothing. Immediately, I think something is amiss and suspect that there is something wrong with this bottle, until I read that many other people have said the same thing. Oh well, moving along. The smell is terrific, which really surprised me after that truly lackluster performance in the pour. Very malty with loads of sweet, toasted grains, toffee, and perhaps a pinch of spent coffee grounds. All of these are reflected in the flavour, but not with the intensity one gets in the aroma. Mouthfeel is about what you'd expect from a holiday beer boasting 7% as far as weight, however, there is ZERO carbonation. Overall, I found this rather strange. Why would a Norwegian brewey choose to replicate an American Porter for their Christmas offering? How can their other offerings be so well crafted, yet this pours into your pint glass like cold coffee with a little bit of black mushroom soil dissolved into it? Oh well... I'm still glad I got o try this one, and it isn't *terrible*, it just looks odd when you pour it. These guys can do much, much better, though!!"
"How does a Norwegian Christmas beer qualify as an American Porter? Huh...well, this pours black into a Duvel tulip black with a mocha foam. Spotty network of lacing, looks nice. Cocoa, anise, pumpernickel bread in the nose. Rich and roasty taste, blackened malts, chocolate or carob, sassafras, molasses, with a mild amount of residual spice that lingers in the aftertaste. Low carbonation, sort of a smooth lactic feel. Kind of average yet well crafted, for the money i'd much rather have a sixer of Anchor OSA."
"D - This goes down way too easy. Seemed more like a Baltic porter to me but very nice and complex."
"D: I couldn't put down the glass! Every sip brings on a new subtle nuance. This brewery seems to have the midas touch with everything I've tried from them so far. I'm dying to find more of their bottled offerings!"
"Something to enjoy after your christmasguests have left. Very good indeed. Try it!"
"Bottle conditioned, 500 ml. Very dark colour, nearly black. Large brown head. Delightful aroma of roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, prunes, caramel and oak. Flavour is not quite as complex but still good, bitter roasty and coffee notes combined with bittering hops dominate, on a background of dark bitter sweet chocolate, hints of English liquorice. Roasty bitter aftertaste. Anyway, this is a very fine effort from Haandbryggeriet. Not a beer for the traditional Scandinavian Christmas dinner, but try it if you have chocolate pudding for dessert - or simply enjoy it on its own!"
