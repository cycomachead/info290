4.17,5,4,4.5,4.5,2.5,4,"Pours a thin slightly murky dark root beer color that is headless. Tons of dark overly ripe fruits dominate the aroma with plenty of age (sherry notes) and some booziness comprise a great nose. First sip is surprisingly good and tasty. Similar to what the nose indicted, the taste is full of those lovely dark overly ripe fruits like plums and figs. It starts super sweet but quickly finishes with a bitter twist that really captures my attention sip after sip after sip. Though thin bodied and lacking some carbonation - I don’t care as this puppy has plenty to offer.","ATLbeerDog","Aug 29, 2012"

Aroma is very fruity, with a bouquet of dark fruits, plums, dates, some yeast, caramel malt, and sweet alcohol esters are present, almost like a brandy. Taste is caramel malt, yeast, dark fruits, plums, dates and some light bitterness. Palate is a full body with a rich creamy texture and soft carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, dark fruits, dates, plums, maybe some light chocolate notes, ending with some sweet slightly bitterness and a lingering alcohol presence, flavors become more pronounced as it warms up.

It is rich and smooth, yet in no way a burden to drink. I’ve not had a barley wine that was this close to perfection without any required extended cellaring. The price works out to about $5 per 12 ounce serving, and I concede that this is easily the best $5 barley wine that I have ever had the pleasure of imbibing. In this case the small 275 ml (9.3 ounce) bottle actually felt like an unnecessarily large serving. By the time that I was finished, it had warmed to room temperature and was no worse for the wear.

Sweet dark fruit and some alcohol provide the most flavor. Lacks a bit of the fullness and complexity that I would expect from a 12-13 year old ale.

Nice little head of tan rose up over the top and settled down quickly into a small, light pillow that covered just enough. The aroma was a mixed bag of earthy malts, hints of a light hop presence and a smooth, delicate profile that was a treat to behold. Light alcohol note as it warms up and lots of caramel as you move in. The flavor was rich. Nice touches of nuts, caramel, hints of cinnamon and spices really liven it up. A very full palate here. A hint of bittering hops as it warms and the long, slow finish was just wonderful. A very solid little beer, well little in size only.

4.42,11.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Another beer that has apparantly been retired prematurely. If its still available and a style meant to age, why retire it? Anyway, bottle purchased from John's Grocery in Iowa City. Poured brown, just a dusting of a head with regularly rising bubbles. Small head sticks around lengthily. Spotty lacing. Sweet smelling boozy caramel odor. Very strong and malty. Some nuttiness. Reminds me of Thomas Hardy on the nose. Flavor is very sweet, rummy and milky. Maple syrup, demerara sugar, grass hops bitterness, sweet malt, figs and plums. What little hops there are keep it from being too much of a malt and alcohol bomb. Dry and thinner than expected, but wtill syrupy and i'd say medium bodied. A nice sipper of an old ale, approaching an english barleywine in most qualities. Very tasty and interesting.","aforbes10","Jan 06, 2008"
4.14,4.3,3,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours an incredibly viscous murky brown with very little to no head or lacing. The smell is sweet and sherry like with raisins, prunes, and a touch of wood. Taste is very sweet and dessert like. The same fruit detectable in the nose is here, but a little more subdued. Smooth and honeyed malt with a trace of tannic bitterness on the finish. Very little carbonation makes this almost like a rich mead. Fairly complex and quite nice as a digestif. Very smooth mouthfeel and lighter seeming than both the smell and appearance would suggest. Nice.","Georgiabeer","Oct 25, 2007"
3.92,-1.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Caramel, toffee, vinouous notes and a good dose of malt. Barely wine taste: big malts, low hops. Sweet but bitter, sour notes. Oily but thin mouthfeel. No carbonation to speak of. On the watery side to be a barley wine. Nice ale, but not an old ale. Needs to be brought out of retirement and reclassed as a barley wine.","BDTyre","Jul 21, 2007"
3.93,-1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"M&D: rather lubricating on the mouthfeel without being sticky/heavy at all; at 8.1%, it somehow tastes like 6%-something, as the alc. as well as fizziness have both been softened greatly by the aging process, while the hoppyness and woody-tannic mouthfeel both make the palate all the more interesting and not quite boring. Overall, this ale tastes more like a barley wine than old ale to me. Yet, whichever style, this is a very enjoyable, albeit somewhat understated, strong ale IMHO!","wl0307","Jun 30, 2007"
2.7,-32,3.5,3.5,2.5,1.5,2.5,"This poured from my 275ml bottle lifeless and flat, so immediately my radar is up for other flaws. Although the label says to see the cap for "best before date", I cant find any indication on the bottle of the vintage of this little guy. It seems too watery for a big beer. The color is river-bottom ruddy, virtually opaque and brown. What little head there is lingers and tilting the glass results in some limited cascade. The aroma is off ... granny smith apple, mostly. The first swallow is starkly candied and caramel ... not beer caramel, but like literal candy caramel apple your dad bought you at a state fair when you were a kid. It still seems a bit watery, but the intense flavor quotient would certainly be attractive to some, I suppose. (#2733, 3/6/2007)","Braudog","Mar 06, 2007"

(Note: a second pour created about a quarter-inch thick layer of foam that slowly settled. This pour also greatly enhanced the mouthfeel.) The first whiff of the aroma smells of marzipan and toffee, along with alcohol-soaked fruit. The taste is full of caramel and toffee notes with a raisiny character, which fades to a more nutty, woody character suggestive of walnuts. This is a very complex beer. I'm surprised by the dryness of the finish, which is also a bit tannic. I love the complexity of this beer. There are more flavors here I can quite isolate, but all of them combined make for a very complex an flavorful beer. The strenght is up there a bit and is noticeable, too.

Smell is a lovely dried fruit, dates, and a bit vinious. Slightly sour, but moslty sweet. Taste follows through nicely. Nice raisin/date flavor. Earthy and mild too. Mouthfeel is a disappointment, because there is no carbonation. It is medium bodied and chewy, that part is very enjoyable. If there was a tiniest bit of carbonation, it would bring the score up drasticly. This is a tastey old ale.

It smells of melting chocolate with prunes and raisins and old sherry, the alcohol is present though subdued it seems to drive the smell. No soy sauce here, just good old stock, lush folds of malt hold flavors developed over the past 8 years. Sherry, oak, raisins, opium, and hints of chocolate like I haven't had since the plantation I visited in Panama. I am floored by this beer and I sip it slowly letting it absorb into my tongue until my mouth is steeped in the flavors, slowly but surely making my way through becuase I might have to wait a while to get another bottle.","Higravity","Feb 08, 2006"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"A very nice example of an English Old Ale. Similar in Character to Thomas Hardy's or JW Lees Harvest. 1998 vintage poured into a small tasting glass. Murky brown color, no head, but some carbonation still present. Aroma was slightly sweet, with ripe fruit aromas present. Taste was very smooth, subtle yet complex. Prunes, raisins and brandy were present. I tend to like the bolder flavors of Thomas Hardy's a bit more, but this was still very nice (and far less expensive). I had this along with a 94 Hardy's and preferred that, but this is no slouch. Above average alcohol content is about all that limits drinkability in my opinion, but I never have more than a few beers in a sitting anyways as I like to keep my taste buds sharp (and not get hammered!) so thats not a problem for me.","ChrisBowers","Jan 19, 2006"

It has a smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes warm with a buttery aftertaste. It is full of sweet crystal malts and roasted barley. The aging must add more complexity to the flavor. There are some woody notes as well. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. There is so much going on in this brew. The taste is great.

Aroma of strong roasted malt and some alcohol is easily distinguishable. Taste of strong malt, molasses and sweet caramel makes up for a nice warming drink. Alcohol is evident but not as much as to ruin it for me. Body is quiet full with some very light carbonation. I suspect a minimal used of hops since there is not much bitterness or maybe this is due to aging. Nice English style barleywine overall.","Phyl21ca","Aug 17, 2005"

Spicy and complex, with a nicely moderate alcohol presence.","mzwolinski","Aug 08, 2005"

Large chunks of sediment floating around the beer - which is a deep, dark amber. First sniff evokes soy sauce which rounds out into alcohol and sweetness. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected, flavor a little sharper. Subsequenscent flavors are molasses and sherry, plums and cherries, also earthy, like leather. Major diacetyl coating.

3.94,-0.8,3,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours with only a wispy pale head, it is a hazy dark amber color. From afar the beer smells quite thick with hops, when I get in closer though sweet malt notes dominate. The aroma is oxidized with notes of sherry, port, thick malt, dates, figs. The aroma is quite richly fruity. The beer is not that sweet. I was expecting it to be a bit sweeter, but given that this is 7 years old, usually the sweetness of a beer dies down over time. The beer is fairly rich with aged malt notes and oxidation notes, I get a combination of notes of sherry, perhaps some wet cardboard notes, caramel, raisins, and figs. The palate is fairly light, and I think that it has thinned out considerably since it was first brewed. The oxidation character of this beer is just about perfect, it is a tasty beer to be sipping on as a nightcap.","Gueuzedude","Jan 18, 2005"

The aroma is terrible at first - smells like paint thinner with a few raisins in it. If you waft it off the top a bit, the alcohol stink vanishes mostly and you get a raisin and slight malt with a little alcohol aroma. I wasn't too sure of this one based on the aroma. The flavor is much different. Nice mild raisins with a smooth backing malt. Very surprising. Some nice caramel character. The mouthfeel is pretty moderate and the drinkability is somewhat low because the alcohol presence is obvious. Good beer overall and decent to drink, but I couldn't have more than one.","clvand0","Jan 07, 2005"

The nose is raisins and some sort of liquor. I can't place the liquor that it reminds me of, but it is definately a very heavy liquor. After swirling it a little, the heavy liquor nose moves out, leaving a very big raisin bread aroma. I like that a lot better. The flavor is huge on raisin across the top of the middle of my tongue. there is a flavor on the tip of my tongue I can't place. Some bready and creamy nots as well in there. The feel is moderate, and very smooth. No carbonation is evident at all, and if it were, I think it would take away from the experience. Overall, this is a nice beer.

Most of the taste was wooden oak taste (dry) w/ a smooth caramelly or butterscotch flavor that came through as well up front, and ended like a dry sherry w/ berries mixed throughout. The feel of the beer was interesting as well. Besides the dryness of it, it had a bitey alcohol w/ slight carbonation.

Reminds me a bit of a belgian dubbel. Definately winey too, but not overwhelmingly so. Little alcohol too, even though this is only 8.1%, but that's ok. The one "really bad" character (not really that bad) was a lack of mouthfeel. Kind of thin for a beer of this caliber, but I suppose its not suppose to be huge.

Any hop nose is overpowered. Although the overall flavor of this brew is quite sweet, the pleasant flavor contributions from the yeast make it flavorful and enjoyable. Tart esters give way to highly caramelized malt sweetness, while biscuit malt eeks its way into the flavor and adds to the malty goodness.  Hop bitterness has most likely faded, since malt takes centerstage in this brew.  The finish is sugary sweet w/ a satisfying alcohol warmth.
