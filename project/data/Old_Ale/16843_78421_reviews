"Just doesn't deliver at all. Just tastes like an old ale. I aged one for two years, wasn't hot like i've heard but had no flavor."

"Poured into a Belgian tulip glass, from a 22 oz. bottle."

"This is a beer that will probably improve with age; it is young and hot to the point of almost not being able to enjoy it fresh."

"Overall - Just not an impressive beer. Too sweet and uncomplex."

"T: starts with some ripe grape sweetness, but quickly tails into a dry, boozy mess. Burnt raisin skins, burnt brown sugar and straight boozy heat. Way hot for not being that high in ABV. May need a little time."
"Interesting beer, pushing the lines of wine and beer a bit closer. The malt profile of this beer really lend well to the wine elements. Without knowing what went into this beer I'd think it was a really grapey and earthy double esb."

"Overall - Awfully similar to Dogfish Head's Midas Touch in terms of flavor, though I prefer this one a bit more, mostly due to the more approachable body. If I never had this again I wouldn't miss it, but it's certainly something I'd consider buying again, price dependent."
"High C+"

"O: A decent beer that I went back and forth on from sip to sip. Very boozy and definitely sipping worthy. I enjoy that they collaborated with the local Temecula wine country. A unique spin on an old style. Worth trying."

"You have to like the Old Ale style, and to me they seem to always be a challenge. This one is very sudsy and that adds to the palatability. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Barons Marketplace in San Diego."

"Drink- I'm glad I have a bottle to sit on and let meld a bit more. This is a bit young IMO."
"A very strange beer, and probably not one I'd want to try again."
"Pours blood red in color with a finger of off-white head. A weird combination of smoke (maybe the char from the oak?) and grape. Heavily toasted malts with some sweet caramel and fruit coming through. Sweet with a decent grape character but fairly watery. A touch of toast along with the dark fruit character."

"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy tan head that fades to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, fruit, and wood. Taste is of malt, brown sugar, fruit, and wood. There is a woody aftertaste with each sip that lingers on the palate. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good and interesting beer in terms of the ingredients."
"Overall: Good beer maybe one of my two favorites from Hangar but I feel like the flavor is just missing something"
"O: This was a joy to try, The best I've ever had from Hangar 24."
"O- Interesting beer, not my style though."
