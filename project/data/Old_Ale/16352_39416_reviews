"Overall:  This is a very, very tasty beer.  I really like the flavors of coffee, chocolate, dark bread and molasses.  Iâ€™ll certainly get another bottle or two of this next winter."
"A nice, enjoyable old ale. A good choice of style for the winter!"

"Overall: fairly green as fair as old ales go, but I see some potential in this one. The smell doesn't represent the nice taste. and the flavors show some potential for some age. certainly something I plan on trying with some age on it."

"Pours a deep bronze color  with lacy half finger off white head atop.The aromas are pretty lackluster with some faint green apple and brown sugar noticed.Obviously malt driven wich it should be for the style.Some malty fruity notes on the palate with some""cakiness",as it warm I pick some nuttiness even more so in the finish.The first of many holiday beers I am sure of this season,not bad but it lacks a little."

"Pours a clear deep copper amber mahogany with a spotty-lacing ring of off-white head. Has a lightly sweet toasted nutty dark caramel malty nose with some English hoppiness. Starts with pretty good fullness and sweet toasted caramel maltiness with a touch of dark fruits before a drier bittersweet finish. Well-balanced and quite drinkable."

"A decent brew. The appearance certainly fits the holiday theme. The bitterness was a bit beyond my range, somewhat overbalanced. The sour aspect was fine, but I think I would have enjoyed st sweeter to compensate for the bitterness."

"O: Very much a malty beer though I was hoping for a bit more depth and complexity to the flavors - the alcohol is pretty well hidden and the beer is reasonably easy to drink."

"O - A very tasty brew, especially if you're a sweet malty fan and you can appreciate the sweet & spicy combo. And for a malty sweet beer, surprisingly it's very drinkable at 7% (uh-oh!)..."
""
"Mouthfeel is flat and thin. Overall, it's OK."

"O - While nothing special to look at or smell, the Lights Out is a nice holiday ale with good flavors. It's worth a try, even if with all of Blue Mountain's other better offerings I may not have it again."

"This beer ain't bad at all. It's easy to drink and would go nice with a holiday football game after the turkey dinner."
"A very interesting beer. It's body is very dark brown, with just a bit of tan blooming up before settling to a collar. Not nearly as sweet and syrupy as some of the other old ales that I've had, but delicious all in its own right. The malts are quite toasty, and an earthy, autumnal element looms large. The whole flavor profile strikes me as fall-like, rather than wintery. The carbonation is quite low, and the feel is satisfyingly full. Extremely tasty."
"Overall a tasty ale that perhaps lacks the depth of other old ales."
"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): Pours almost prune into the glass, with a nice soapy eggshell head that leaves thick lace. The nose has lots of fruity sours with some toast and malt. The flavors are sour (very reminiscent of biting down on a fresh pine needle... that initial sour bite), toasted malt and finishing with a nice lingering bitter. The mouthfeel is slick and easy (due to the many esters at work). A decent old ale overall."
"d: Meh."
"I had no trouble drinking this beer, but it didn't impress me much. I found it an odd choice for a holiday beer. It had some decent strength but without any spice I wouldn't have known. Work on the recipe a bit and it could be good, don't keep this as your Christmas Ale though..."
"I enjoyed and enjoy sending it with the full nelson as extras to others."
"The flavor is really quite bland. The sweetness kind of takes over and all of the better fruit characteristics from the nose are essentially lost, giving way to a bit of a brown-sugar edge. There is a touch of alcohol, but not overpowering at all. The feel is quite a bit too light for the style and for the flavors in general. This went down fairly easily, but the one-dimensional flavor and light mouthfeel are not what I'd like out of this style, or many beers for that matter."
"It is great for a Holiday beer because it isn't too sweet and isn't spiced. We can dring it from Halloween to New Years and it is consistently good."
"As holiday ales go, Lights Out is mundane and as Old Ales go, it's weak and thin."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty good beer and its easy drinking enough. I drank a few on draft and really enjoyed them, but this just doesnt stand up to many of the old ales out there."
"Poured with a very fizzy noisy head. The light brown head quickly fell into the glass and left no lacing. It is brown to deep amber. Smells very fruity. Brown sugar, banana, and caramel come through. The taste is very similar to the smell. Raisins, fig, and toffee. Kind of winey flavor as well. Maybe some toasted grain in the background. This is medium body and very enjoyable. I will be seeking this out again before the season is over."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with lots of lively carbonation and a slight head. The aroma is bready and yeasty with a sting of bitter hops coming later. Flavor is yeasty and malty, with hints of coffee and intense molasses with a little flowery hop overtone and a nice malt burn. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth."
"D: Big and malty with dark fruit leading the way and some earhty, herbal hops creating a nice finish. Blue Mountain continues to produce great beers in a picturesque, pure environment."
"Another good beer from Blue Mountain, one of the better beers they have there. I will look forward to getting more this year around the holidays."
"I think I got a bad bottle. Mine tasted like finger nail polish, mixed with tart fruit, and alcohol. Very strange. Smell was somewhat similar, but not as up front as the taste. I'd be willing to try it again, but for now, I'm going to have to pour the rest down the drain. Sorry."
"Lights Out is not exactly lights out beer. It's an okay beer, but it sorely needs some punch. A nice dose of hops would probably do much to improve it. They would give it just the zeal it needs. As it is, it's maybe a little above average overall. But, there's a load of great holiday beers that are far superior. It's not something I'd seek out. But, I'm very grateful for the opportunity to give it a go."
"This is a very interesting take on an old ale and certainly drinkable. I can't place the tartness in the taste, but otherwise this is pretty solid brew."
"Overall impression: This is a very enjoyable holiday ale. You don't really get that it is 7% ABV. The malt and spice really blend well. This is definitely a slow sipper but one that will take away the head aches from the family holiday meals."
"Drinkability: A little better on tap than out of the bottle, I think. This one's nice, mellow, complex, and mature, with an entirely moderate level of alcohol for the style. Glad they finally got this one out - too bad it's a style that's more suited for winter, when you can't really enjoy the beautiful scenery visible from Blue Mountain's outdoor patio."
"D: A fairly mellow sipper, and a nice tasting beer. Another fine offering from Blue Mountain. I'll be looking forward to a bit more over the season."
