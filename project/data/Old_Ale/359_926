4.26,7.6,4.25,3.75,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: Theakstons are a local (to me) brewery and Old Peculier can often be found on draught hereabouts. It's a bit heavy to be a session beer, unless your plan is to get as drunk as possible as quickly as possible. More of a 'sipping' beer - the sort of thing that you can enjoy in front of a blazing fire at the back-end of the year. Rather like now, in fact. Recommended.","interzen","Dec 07, 2014"

The roasted barley coming stronger in the taste and with sweet vanilla more than toffee. A lingering gentle sourness dominating the bitterness.

I took a swig, and as I set down the glass on the desk, I remember thinking my suspicions were confirmed. The taste started bitter, as you would expect any ale to deliver (a little too bitter, if I am to be honest). But, as I continued working at my desk, my taste buds would not let me forget the lingering bitterness that gave way to a sweet finish. I found myself reaching for the glass, taking another sip. As this deep red ale hit my tongue a second time, I realize that this beer holds a quaint little secret! Once again, I set the glass down on the desk, but, unlike the first time, I have a new respect for this delicious ale. Paying more attention to the flavor this time, I realize that this brew has a creamy, sweet caramel flavor, with a very nice lingering fruity undertone - well balanced with a mild bitterness. By the time I finish the glass, this "forgettable" beer has me craving another. Quite a pleasant surprise, I will not soon be forgetting this premium ale!","geaux750","Feb 24, 2014"

Aromas of big caramel, raisin, fig, banana, molasses, toast, chocolate, pepper, clove, brown bread, floral, and spicy yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity notes with moderate spicy esters. Taste of caramel, raisin, fig, molasses, light banana, toast, chocolate, pepper, clove, brown bread, floral, and spicy yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, dark fruits, toast, molasses, chocolate, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of malt and fruity/spicy flavors; with a great balance of malt/fruitiness and no cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent old ale. Nice complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 30, 2013"

This is gorgeous stuff - just beautiful. All right, it's just your average deep dark brown, reddish in hue through strong light, with a copious tan head if you pour dead center. Smells like good Yorkshire Ale, at least the ones I've had in a bottle - the bready yeasty smell that lets you know this is from England, plus a sweet aroma I don't know how to describe. Maybe raisins. Perhaps this is like a perfect marriage between Korbinian and real ale. The maltiness and other characteristic English flavors are all here, but the added dimension of fruit, caramel, and roasted nuttiness makes it extra delicious, but not unreasonably sweet. World class? Absolutely. Do not hesitate to get a six-pack. Perfect for winter. I'm usually a little wary of English dark beer. This is in a class all its own.","angusdegraosta","Feb 13, 2012"

Nicely balanced between woodsy hops and a toffee-like malt base, with notes of whole grains, tea, and bitter caramel.

It is lightly sweet with just enough bitterness to balance it and round out the taste, before a long, dryish finish with toast, fruit, and wood.

Despite originating in England, I prefer more recent American renditions of the style. Founder's Old Curmudgeon and North Coast's Old Stock Ale come to mind. Those seem to have a deeper and more satisfying flavor, in addition to a significantly gratuitous bump in abv. For some reason, that seems to work for me.

Keeps getting sweeter as it warms, hints of raisins, some earthiness pops up and quickly leaves. It sounds strange but I'm picking some hints of grape soda?? Weird, but interesting. Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, light to medium bodied. An overall nice brew and my first of this style. I would greatly like to try some more old ales in the future.","KeefD","Jun 18, 2008"

Very pleasant, mellow aroma of chocolate and honey or maple; not very bubbly; nice and tasty. Not too toasty, not overly malty, and ever so slightly bitter. All in all, a pleasant surprise.

Mostly just the tells of a sweet ale, but some kind of interesting fruit underneath it all. That fruit, which becomes apparant in the taste, reminds me the most of lovely overripe plum. A sharp and short bite of hops and alcohol follow, leaving a bit of sweetness and roasted malt lingering at the end. Faint diacetyl that doesn't get in the way too much. Not an incredibly complex ale, but more so than the average british beer on the shelf. Drinkability's fine. A solid choice.","redmagik99","Jan 19, 2008"

A very swee, malty, fruity aroma greets my nose. Notes of sugared figs and oher candied fruits bring up a great malt nose. The taste is a very complex malt bill with just enough hops to not make this beer taste like candy syrup. Hints f prunes, bown sugar, and fruit cake mixed with roasted malts. Great feel to this palate. smooth and sweet. Hard to be very sessionable though because of the sweetness.","scruffwhor","Jan 01, 2008"

Malty and creamy, dark plum and raisin. Burnt sugar. Mouthfeel is very much scotch/yorkshire in smoothness. Very drinkable, as it should be. I really like the darker flavors in this brew but it does have a peculier (haha) bite to the finish. Not bitter, very smooth, but has a non floral mini hop bite without any obvious hop flavors.

4.59,15.9,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"One of the best beers I've had yet. Dark copper/brown with a creamy head. The smell is as enticing as anything I've ever encountered: a kind of warm, rich molasses and malt combo that just makes your mouth water. Taste is similar to some Belgian ales, Chimay Red coming immediately to mind (that's a good thing, btw): very "deep", with hints of butter and dried fruit. The 5.7 ABV is amazing considering the complexity and richness. Absolutely a must-drink.","tlinner","Dec 01, 2007"
3.97,0.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer is a real treat. I didn't have overly high expectations but was pleasantly surprised. The beer doesn't have much head, retention, or lacing. The beer is medium to full bodied, and lacks carbonation, but that's not a bad thing in this case. The beer's smell is very nice. You'll get those dark, deep, sweet malts, caramel, toffee, and raisin. The taste largely follows suit, but there is a bit more dryishness to this beer, a slightly more sourish hoppy end, and some other complexity that makes this a very nice option. The mouthfeel is very nice, a little syrupy, a little creamy. The aftertaste is moderate. This beer is well worth seeking out, and it definitely spoiled me for some other beers I was trying afterwards.","albern","Nov 30, 2007"

3.88,-2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured into my Hennepin glass. The beer and head fills it nicely to about a 1/2 inch from the brim. The head settles a bit from about an inch high to a very firm 1/4 inch of creamy foam. The smell is quite peculier (LOLOLOL!!!) with a malty roasted base and a smell that resembles either carrot or corn husk. Slight grassy hops toward the end. The taste is also interesting. It reminds me a lot of a german schwarzbier but with a little less sweetness and a little more hop presence. Bitter metallic hops follow the drink leaving a mouthfeel similar to an APA or very mild IPA. There s also a bit of an earthy porter-like effect after a few more sips. Much lighter in body than a porter, but very similar hop profile. This beer covers all the bases of several beers I've had including chocolate stout, cream porter, APA, schwarzbier, and english brown ale. It's a good thing they call it an old ale, because I have yet to have two old ales that are strikingly similar.","Rudgers73","Jul 02, 2007"

3.77,-4.8,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours very dark brown with some ruby highlights on the edges. Delicate tan head that leaves some thin lacing and a collar. Aromas are nicely sweet, with molasses and butterscotch/diacetyl notes that mingle together nicely and are never overdone. On the palate, the diacetyl is less dialed-down and a bit more out of wack at higher temperatures, but at lower temperatures the palate is nicely malty and sweet, showing highlights of chocolates and molasses. Very smooth mouthfeel, with slick malts and only minimal carbonation making for a drink that feels surprisingly light for an old ale.

This brew has hints of what it used to be like, but unless my palate has changed that much, they've tweaked the Old Pec. The mouthfeel is thin and a bit watery, very peculiar.

Also has hints of a black licorice or rootbeer flavor to it (the aroma had this too). Kind of roasty too, but not enough to make it more similar to a porter. Reminds me in many ways of a Scottish or Scotch/wee heavy ale. Very tasty. Complex flavors, but well-balanced.

Intense, dark chocolate flavour on sipping, with roasted nuts and a hint of coffee. Blackcurrants and a suggestion of spice (nutmeg maybe?) in the finish. The ale feels nice and full bodied in the mouth, and drinking this stuff is no difficult task. There's little fizziness to it, which I like. This was one of the first ales I tried, and it has quickly become a staple, either as a beer when feeling unadventurous, or when I just want a reminder of the taste of an old favourite. Its definitely seductive.","zebedee","Aug 28, 2006"

Malty aroma full of caramel and toffee, but there's a strong fruitiness that's reminiscent of prunes and there's a bit of cocoa in there as well. Same in the flavour, along with moderate bitterness and a hint of hops. Medium bodied, kind of on the light side for an old ale, with medium/low carbonation. Still, it's palate coating. Not bad at all - pretty tasty and easy to drink. I think I've gotten spoiled on slightly bigger old ales, so this one seems a little more "refreshing" than I expected. Quite enjoyable.","DrJay","Aug 25, 2006"

Small is quite sweet, but a bit subdued, with fruity notes of cherry and plum, caramel, and a minor nutty note. Taste is more assertive, touching many of the same bases. The vinous note is puzzling, and I'm not quite sure what I'm tasting beyond the fact that it's intriguing and pleasant.

In the taste, the sweetness is a bit more complex as it throws in some brown sugar and a milky sweetness without that lactic bitterness. Kind of interestsing. The finish leaves you wishing for a bit more punch, as the minute amount of hop bitterness washes it down with a faint herbal quality. Tastes minerally as well. Other than that, there's not a whole lot going on here. The flavor is complex enough in itself to be interesting, but overall this is way too restrained and subdued for my liking.

There is a nice balance of hops to keep this brew from being overly sweet. Given the smell and taste, the body of this beer proved to be a medium to thin brew.

The smell is dully sweet (caramel), with an obvious mineral character and has a definite fruity yeast presence. Flavor is very well integrated, a substantial, dry roasted note mixed with some dried currant, caramel and molasses. Yeast seems to lend a melon characteristic. The malts are substantial but supremely balanced by herbal, tealike hops that keep things relatively dry at all times. A definite acidic tone that serves that aim as well.

Purchased at Foremost liquor on Ashland Ave. in Chicago. Six Pack. 12 oz bottle. Been in my fridge for about a month before I made my way to it. The head forms quickly (had to watch my pour a bit) and fades quickly leaving residue on the cup. There is a rich malty smell. Rich like fortified wine (port), but without the alcohol to it. Get a little dried fruit too. I'm not terribly familiar with the style (just starting to get into the English, always been more of a Belgian guy), but this is great. A little bitterness in the aftertaste. Sweet and malty upfront. I've only had a couple of old ales before, but this one is easily the best I've had. It has a richness to it, while at the same time being incredibly drinkable. I didn't expect this to go down so easy.

It's what you'd expect per the description--plain and simple. Texture to the mouth is medium viscocity, medium carbonation, medium roundness, and medium dryness.

Taste beings with a big toffee flavor and continues with a plum/raisin/dark fruit flavor as well as the buttery diacetyl flavor.

Big caramel malt flavor, laced with sugar, and just a bit of a tawny, wine-like character. A bit tart towards the finish, which is pleasantly balanced by just the right amount of bitter hops, followed by a powdery sweetness. A complex ale, but a very nuanced one, and rather drinkable.

The head is sudsy, bubbly, a little over an inch in height and is dark tan. The body is deep brown bordered by dark crimson streaks. The beer looks like royalty. Smell: flecks of dark chocolate, freshly baked sourdough bread; some faint espresso notes with a finish of candied plums. Taste: milk chocolate sweetness upfront, rapidly takes on some complexity -- slight hop bitterness tangled up in musty dark fruitiness. The middle is chocolate covered coffee beans and the finish is a slightly sour pop of hops with a receding base of dark fruit sweetness. Pleasant, yet complex. Mouthfeel: full, has a whipped-creaminess to it. Middling carbonation.

I suspect that the sample I have is old, but that does not detract from the quality too much. Pours to a quickly retreating "head" of huge bubbles that fade to almost nothing. Deep ruby and brown color. Aroma is chiefly malt, caramel, and sherry with hints of vanilla and licorice. Flavor can be described as malty and complex (licorice, banana, port, sherry, etc...) with a perfect balance achieved by judicious hopping. Some nice toasty/roasty notes in there too. Don't drink it ice-cold, you'll miss all the flavors. The finish starts sweet but dries out in the aftertaste. That "sweetness-turned-dry" seems to be the alcohol component of the flavor.

Im hesitant about lowering the score for a small weakness in the flavor development where, in mid-mouth, theres a slightly watery gate toward the smoky finish, but after reflexion, it just makes it that much more drinkable. Besides it, the mouth entrance is artwork, a great caramel, chocolate and woody blend on a dry and lightly tart foundation of dark malt. Vegetal and mineralic finish has a gentle touch of bitterness.

Aroma is sweet toasted malt and some fruitiness (plum?) and a touch of smoke and coffee. Taste is malty, with hint of woodspice and chocolate. Hops are a secondary flavor, a bit of bite coming toward the swallow. Mouthfeel seems a bit thin for such a dark brew, Guinness like.

Tastes like straight up roasted barley and malt tinged with sweetness, though the latter dissipates once you drink past the first few gulps. The finish stops the maltiness short with . . . a subtle dryness without bitterness, followed by a residue of malt aftertaste. This is a wonderful beer; I usually associate Scotch ales with a flavor that tastes like a compressed and redoubled, alchohol-forward amber ale. Granted, the Scotch ales in my experience are all American microbrew interpretations of the genre.","marcellaproust","Apr 10, 2004"

Reminds me a lot of McEwan's Scotch Ale. They are both owned by Scottish Courage... Not bad, enjoyable, but there are lots of better beers in the style. Orkney's SkullSplitter is a much better example of something like this.","hyuga","Jan 30, 2004"

A very interesting and pleasant mouthfeel--creamy and clean, not syrupy. A wash of mild bitterness starts at the front of the mouth and methodically crawls to the back. Creamy malts are strongest in the middle of the taste, eventually giving way to some bitterness and lightly spicy alcohol flavors. This is a pleasantly interesting and drinkable beer.","BitteBier","Jan 28, 2004"

The taste is fairly clean compared to the rich brew that I remember that this once was. This beer is lightly sweet with almost no balancing bitterness. There seems to be a threshold level of buttery diacetyl, which, adds a bit to the complexity of this beer. There seems to be some subtle dark malt flavors that are evocative of chocolate. It is quite drinkable, but need to be served quite warm to get any of the flavors.","Gueuzedude","Jan 14, 2004"

Smelled rich and malty with chocolate, spice (nutmeg and cinnamon mostly), ripe fruit and diacetyl notes of butter and nuts. A solidly structured beer supported by malt and molasses which are joined by a slight ''horse blanket'' character and black fruit tastes. Finishes on this sourness and a mild but well defined bitterness leaving you wanting another sip 'til it's all gone. I'm now looking for a place which serves this on tap.","Beersignal","Jan 12, 2004"

Taste is bitter/tart at the beginning, then the walnuts and toffee take over. Overall, an excellent execution of well balanced malty caramel and hops bitterness.

The flavors were of fresh floral hop flowers, roasted malt and nuts, some coffee, earth tones, caramel, plums, and some alcohol. It left a roasted oily feel in the mouth. Semi sweet in the beginning, dry and watery near the finish. Medium bodied. Not overly impressed with this beer, good but not impressive IMO.

Taste: Semi fruit infused sweetness with a clean toasty finish of chocolate running through it, I always was turned away from this beer for the simple reason that here in WV it runs at 9 bucks a six pack not bad I am enjoying this one finishes very clean.

Aroma is strong with very abundant notes of buttery diacetyl, toffee and burnt caramel, sweet dust and round English hops. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Mouthfeel is very smooth and pillowy soft with a surprisingly light body. Taste begins with notes of rum, vanilla extract, distant light molasses, pipe tobacco and butterscotch. English hops contribute a round, mild bitterness which is initially prickly. Finishes warm with faint peppery alcohol, a dark grainy astringency and woody notes.

This was also pretty much the taste. Hops were extremely restrained, but so was the malt, so they balanced.

Absolutely perfect mouthfeel, soft and cushiony without being too thick, and just a sparkle of the hard water/metallic quality to wake up the tongue. Drinkability equally high; while you may not want to drink 12 of these in a row, the flavor is continually inviting and the beer suitably robust, but mellow enough to keep you grounded. Should be excellent with food, especially stinky cheeses, boiled veggies, dark roasts and other hearty fare. Where's me Stilton?

3.93,-0.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Sweet malty nose with a hint of burnt wood. Brown color with a nice thick tan head. The head on this beer is thick and creamy and very lasting. Very rich sweet thick roast malt flavor. The aftertaste leaves you with a roast/smoke tongue. Medium to full body with a smooth thicker mouth. The brew is also quite lively in the mouth with carbonation swirling around the tongue. This beer is a sweet roasty ale for those who like sweeter brews.","frank4sail","Apr 24, 2003"
3.95,-0.3,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Chocolatey brown with amber highlights. Very malty; tasting chocolate, brown sugar, and licorice in the end. The licorice leaves a kind of tingly feeling in the mouth. Not much on the hop department, I'm sure there are some in there for balance, but they don't really come to the front. A very tastey ale. A sweet syrupy taste may develop after too many, but I wouldn't worry too much about it.","FINA","Apr 17, 2003"

Decent nose of malt with very faint hops noted. Fairly complex palate and a good dry finish; lots to sample in a single brew. Very smooth and rich mouthfeel. Great bottle and labeling - impressive presentation. Take the plunge on this one.","AtLagerHeads","Apr 04, 2003"
4.03,1.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Color is dark, deep brown, with a tannish head with a good mixture of small and big bubbles. Came right up to just about an inch high then faded some leaving some patchy lace. Smell is sweet malt, pretty bold, with alot of little complexities. Some hints of dried fruit and spices. Taste is kinda creamy/oily with a smooth, sweet, milky, roasted chocolate malt with a strange dryness of fruitlike hops and herbs. Raisin or fig I believe. Its somewhat earthy but I was a little put off by it. It seemed to separate from the original flavor. But was good non the less. The feel is interestingly rich, creamy smooth, heavy to medium bodied with a slightly dry bite. Good complex beer. This really fits the Old Ale style.","tavernjef","Mar 30, 2003"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"This one pours a very dark brown with a lively tan head. The nose is very mild sweet malt and hints of caramel. The mouthfeel is sharp, almost astringent with the hops.

This one is quite enjoyable and a nice dark ale to be savored.","AtrumAnimus","Mar 29, 2003"

Some syrupy sweet malts, butterscotch and a touch of roasted licorice. The taste is very good with a sweet malt background, a touch of alcohol dryness and full of dark roasted nuts. Sweetly toasted malts and a nutty texture blend with a creamy mouthfeel to make this beer extremely drinkable. Very rich and roasted tasting. Perfect blend of hop bitterness. A damn fine ale.

Decent nose, malty sweet, notes of dark fruitiness, slight yeastiness, soft caramel as well. As for taste the sweet, soft malt & slightly bitter hops balance the palate nicely, some chalkiness. A nice mixture of graininess and smoothness adds, both, to the taste and mouthfeel. The finish is lovely, albeit thin (as is the body), with a light sweet toffee and coarse bitterness. The alcohol seems stronger that listed. Overall, this is a pretty damn decent beer but frankly its nothing Id seek out, still Id drink it again, try one.","bditty187","Mar 05, 2003"

The nose offers a distinctly buttery and fruity aroma above some earthy hops. The body is medium/light with a very fine, moderate carbonation that leaves it smooth and creamy in the mouth. The flavor is bold, and mildly complex, with some soft buttery diacetyl, dark fruit (currant, raisin, prune) and toffee with a tinge of deep scortched molasses (that's not quite roasty). It finishes dry and lingering with a rising bitterness and a touch of alcohol. A classic that's quite unique, and well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Dec 31, 2002"
3.55,-10.4,4,4,3,3.5,4,"This is one of my father-in-laws favorite beers, so I get to drink it with some regularity. I've found that the diacetyl level varies greatly in this beer from being a subtle flavor component, to being overwhelming. This sample was closer to over-whelming. Don't know whether this variability is a brewery issue, or a storage issue, but it makes this beer pretty unpredictable. In the interest of full disclosure, I am quite sensitive to diacetyl, and not particularly fond of it.","Realale","Dec 26, 2002"

I do not see the graininess or coarseness that everyone seems to be detecting. Dark, too dark to call it reddish-brown, maybe the color of cola. Dark at top, but transparent at the bottom of the class. Very light carbonation. Bottom line is that this is a delicious beer that will convert anyone to dark beers.","Naerhu","Dec 23, 2002"

I've never had an english old ale before, but this offering was very enjoyable. Color resembles that of a amber but many shades darker. Lace retention is slight but head poured is attractive, very white, and fluffy.

Flavor of beer is nicely helped out (not saying it NEEDS help) by 5.7% ABV. It finishes smooth and sweet, with a little bitterness on the back of the tongue. If another sip is not taken for 30 seconds, you mouth actually starts to water! Great beer.","yen157","Sep 16, 2002"
4.41,11.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a heavy brown with a cream-colored froth which isn't particularly sticky. Nose is full of raisin-y and grapelike fruit and malt aromas, with some sherry-like alcohol as well. The malts are the first thing you taste, but they are very quickly cut into by a tea-like hop flavor, which brings you to a sort of abrupt finish, with little aftertaste. Very active carbonation. This brew is not nearly as heavy as the nose and appearance would lead you to believe (which I found to be a good thing). Very good stuff.","doerickson","Sep 15, 2002"
4.82,21.7,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Quite a complex aroma with initial sweet and heavy malt (with some caramel), with qualities of fruitiness (with a red wine type aroma) and seems like alcohol aroma too.  Interesting and good.  Thinnish head that stays okay.  Deep dark brown to red (garnet).  After the initial burst of malt, the alcohol seems most evident to me, but not excessive or overwhelming.  Taste has many of the same complexities as the aroma, yet remains smooth.  A bit of nuttiness to the flavor.  Sweetness to the malt, but not so excessive that it tastes like cough syrup  (my biggest gripe with malty styles).  Nice dryness to the finish with a short but pleasant aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is full and rich.  This really is quite an impressive beer.","garymuchow","Sep 05, 2002"

Lots of fruity yeast esters in the aroma, along with mild acetaldehyde. Classic earthy and slightly grassy Fuggles hop nose.  Fairly light in body, but mouthfeel is very smooth and agreeable. Roasted malt notes are surpisingly mild considering Old Peculiar's color, and are comprised of definite chocolate malt and perhaps a touch of roasted barley or black patent.  Crystal malt sweetness is minimal.  Hop bitterness is evenly balanced by the roasted grain bitterness.  As the beer warms a bit of pleasant diacetyl becomes perceptible.  Biscuit flavors and a slight alcohol warmth round out the fairly dry finish.  Tasty, but a tad bland for an Old Ale; it seems to be an Old Ale / Brown Ale hybrid.","marc77","Apr 10, 2002"
