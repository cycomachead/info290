"Full bodied with light carbonation. Very chewy. A very good beer which would have been even better if the alcohol was hidden somewhat, and the beer wasn't so sweet."
"Deep brown in color with ruby highlights and some penetration to light.  A fingernail of khaki head covers the rim and a third of the top of the glass.  Light Brussels lacing.  Wonderful aroma of dark malt, dates, hazelnut, and dark rum.  The taste is a burst of dark malt, hazelnut, toffee, dates, and dark rum.  The mouth is thick, chewy, and there's a warmth from the alcohol."

"Overall: a solid old ale. at about a year old, this one still has quite a bit of booziness. slowing the slightest signs of age but only in a good way. it will be interested to see where this one goes in the future."

"O - This is a big, sweet, chewy beer that is very filling, but the flavors are complex and pleasant.  Not for every occasion, but for times when you want a reflective sipping beer, this is very nice."

"Smooth and very easy drinking for a powerhouse brew. Everything seems well-tempered and balanced while still delivering a multitude of flavor characteristics. A nice example of a classic styled heavy-duty ale."

"Poured  from a 750 ml bottle into a Reuben's Brew small snifter. Pours a medium to dark red-orange amber, with a thin, light tan head that leaves light lacing.  Aroma of bready and dark caramel malt, dark dried fruit, molasses. Flavor is sweet, rich caramel malt, molasses, dark dried fruit, particularly figs and dates, boozy. Finishes thick and sweet with nice residual dried fruit flavors. Heavy bodied with a rich creaminess. Just what I'm looking for in an old ale, this borders on an English barleywine, but has even more maltiness. A bit hot, but plenty of rich flavor to support the alcohol. I remember enjoying this in the Decadence version, and am glad it's in regular rotation now.  I'm going back for a few to cellar."

"love the old ale style, and how many different ways it gets brewed. this is one of the more classic english types, almost a barleywine, but with a lot more pronounced malt fruitiness and a more drinkable overall beer, but there are plenty of similarities. very english in nature, tons of yeast character here, bready and toffee-esque flavors, and plenty of chunky yeast floccy bits in the beer too. radiant burnt caramel color, with a lasting thick but mellow tan head, nice looking brew. the body i found to be just a touch thin, but the flavors are all rich enough it doesnt really need to be any more beefy. the toffee grain profile is big, the alcohol stands out just enough, and i find the whole thing quite decadent, despite having an earthy middle and self cleaning finish. not overly complex, but extremely sturdy at 11% abv. a beer to let warm up, drink slowly, and in good company. all of the big alesmith beers are so well done, this one should serve as an example to other american brewers looking to make old ale, its that good."

"750ml bottle served in my Duck Rabbit snifter. Pours a dark brown with a half inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny pinpricks. Nose reveals dark fruits (some grape) and a suggestion of caramel or toffee. Taste follows nose - more dark fruit and less caramel/toffee; however, there's also a slightly metallic quality. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a carbonation that falls just short of lively - perhaps a little too assertive at this point. Overall, a decent old ale but not worth the price point. Based on the metallic quality in the flavor profile, I don't anticipate this will age well."

"Heavy, very sweet. Have had more impressive beers, although there is plenty to keep you interested here."

"I probably drank this too young. This is raw, boozy and deeply aggressive right now. With age, it will mellow, and hopefully become tamer, more complex and more accessible. A little sweetness, perhaps a touch of oxidation, and some smoother characters all over and I could belive this is a lovely beer. Right now it just jumps out of the glass and strangles the palate."
"750 ml bottle. Pours dark amber with tall, long-lasting, foamy off-white head. Aroma is bready malt, dark fruit, brown sugar and some coffee. Body is full and smooth. Bready, caramel malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, herbal hops and alcohol fill the mouth. Finish is long and dry. Great ale to sip."

"O: Pretty typical old ale. Huge, heavy malts. Sticky, viscous body. Lots of sweet and bready flavors. Fairly plain for such a big beer if I'm honest but still tasty."

"O: An excellently crafted English Old Ale. Classic flavors."
""
""
""
"Overall: More or less highlights what an old ale should taste like."
"Overall: I think this may be my best Old Ale yet. The only thing it’s missing is that interesting brett character that comes with either wood aging or inoculation. Otherwise it is nearly perfect. It’s roasty, malty, sweet, and warm. Well done, AleSmith (4.75/5)."

"2013 ""Old Ale"" big bottle from a trip to the brewery back in November (pouring on 4/11/14). Pours deep dark purplish reddish brownish amber color with a one finger khaki head. Aroma is dark fruits, plums, raisins, fig, sweet brown sugar. Big malts here as expected. Flavor is very sweet with hints of those same prune and fig notes found on the aroma, some nice caramel, and more brown sugar sweet to finish. Just a hint of subtle dry hop bitterness to finish and balance things out. I can see how this would age incredibly in a bourbon barrel. Big body, medium soft carbonation, and a sipper. Very nice in style. AleSmith just does everything well."
""
"O: AleSmith never disappoints, and this is no exception. Delicious and recommended."
"Overall, sweet sugary fruits and tons of alcohol doesn't do it for me."
""
"Overall – A good beer, kind of bordering on belgian dark ale though. Also a little too pricey for what it is. I wouldn't buy this one again."

"O: A very nice old ale. I'll have to seek out the BA version."
""

"Overall this fits the bill on a chilly 50 degree December day in the desert. It was nice to try, give it a shot if you have a decent amount of discretionary income."
"D - I kept letting this one warm waiting for it to get complex but it never seemed to happen. Could never really find the dark fruits I was hoping for. More fruit cake than I wanted."

"Bottled on 6/27/13.Pours into an impy nonic a deep amber hued chesnut brown with a billowing large light beige head that sticks to the glass like glue.Deeply fruity and cake-like in the nose,brown sugar and even a tinge of mineral comes into play as well.Sweet but not overly so on the palate,caramel toffee and dark fruit along with more brown sugar sweetness,just enough of a leafy English hop presence to dry it out enough in the finish.A fantastic ""sipping"" brew,it's malted to the hilt and sweet but not over the top.Great job here."

"For the style Alesmith always puts out quality beers, this one is another example of why they're so good."

"From the 750 ml bottle bought at Bottleworks. This is just a crazy complexity of flavors, but it adds up to wanting something to clear the palate. I'm all for variety, but I'd have to take a Barley Wine over this amped-up Old Ale."

"Pours a hazy brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, toffee, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and caramel flavors on the finish. There is an alcohol burn in the back of the throat after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is quite boozy at the moment."

"T: Rich and malty with a nice touch of dark fruit. Some burnt raisin skins come through near the finish with some plum, brown sugar and leather. The flavor is a touch bland until the finish, and then there's just an absolute firecracker of dark fruit that goes off in your mouth. Finish is dry with a touch of burnt wood, tobacco and just a hint of booze. The bottle says you can age this for up to 20 years and I would love to see what at least a few years would do to this."
