Super flavorful and complex, and while it still packs a nice boozy punch, it goes down smooth as hell. Mouthfeel could have been a bit thicker, but that's only a minor complaint. This could probably continue to age, but I can't imagine it'll get much better than it is now. Definitely trade for this one if you can.","Jonada","Jan 22, 2014"

4.3,-2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"500 ml bottle into snifter, 2009 vintage. Pours a dense very hazy dark ruby red color with a small foamy light khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a small lacing ring that lingers. Alcohol legs on the glass with no lacing; and some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, pear, vanilla, toffee, coconut, oak, clove, bourbon, caramel, toast, brown sugar, molasses, light chocolate, tobacco, pepper, and oak/toasted earthiness; with some slight booze. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of malt and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, caramel, toast, vanilla, toffee, coconut, oak, clove, bourbon, brown sugar, molasses, light chocolate, tobacco, pepper, and oak/toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, vanilla, toast, toffee, coconut, oak, clove, bourbon, brown sugar, molasses, light chocolate, pepper, and toasted earthiness on the finish fora while. Fantastic complexity and balance of malt and barrel flavors; with a great malt/bourbon flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very slick, creamy, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an fantastic barrel aged old ale. All around great complexity and balance of malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 12, 2013"

The nose is potent bourbon caramelized sugars upfront, some dark dried fruits, tobacco, and muddled booziness when it warms. The taste is subtle bourbon, sweet sugar, but definitely on the dry end compared to where a stout or barleywine would be. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, thinner than expected, with good carbonation and a lingering sticky bourbon after burn.

4.15,-6.3,3.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"O: Very interesting barrel aged old ale. It has held up well for the past 4-5 years. Very sweet, very heavy due to a high ABV and low carbonation. A sipper for sure. Luckily this is only a 16.9 ounce bottle, it would be tough to drink a 750 of this stuff (are you listening, Bruery?). Dessert beer for sure. Not far from drinking pure spirits, I wish the Old Ale aspect stood out a little more, even after the years this one's barrel presence is a bit overpowering. Maybe it just needs a few more years to balance out. I enjoyed it a lot but couldn't give it the higher scores that are typical.","Dope","Oct 06, 2013"

Beyond that, this is one of the finest tasting and overall best strong (old) ales that I have ever enjoyed, and is certainly a world-class offering. My hat is off to North Coast for improving upon their already top-shelf Old Stock Ale. If you have a taste for strong ales, barrel aged ales, bourbon, or barley wines, then you are doing yourself a disservice if you haven't tried this magnificent beer.

4.44,0.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"500 ml caged and corked bottle, 2009 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a murky reddish/brown color with about an inch tan cola-like head that fizzled away quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is sweet and malty, it smells like dark fruit, caramel, toffee, bourbon, brown sugar and vanilla. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some nuts, molasses and a bit of brandy. There's also a long lasting sweet malty finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and coating with moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and goes down easy. I think this is a pretty good overall brew. It's pricey ($23.99 a bottle), but definitely worth trying.","bluejacket74","Dec 20, 2011"

Point here is that this beer smelled and tasted amazing, and the mouthfeel was wonderfully complementary to the beer. Seriously 5.0 worthy. The smell, as well the taste to some extent, reminds me a good deal of Firestone Walker 15th Anniversary, which is another beer I loved. Bottom line, the price tag on this beer was high, but I'm SO glad I took a chance and got it (it was the last one on the shelf).

Nose is caramel, gentle bourbon notes, butterscotch and hints of dark fruits in the periphery. Some alcohol notes too, a general sweetness is found throughout the nose. Taste is rich in caramel, butterscotch, vanilla and bourbon, although the bourbon presents itself in a harsher way than found in the nose. More alcohol and leather notes. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy, rich and relatively sweet. Medium-low carb, but on second pours this appears to be much lower than I initially gathered. Great drinkability, a true sipper.

There were strong aromas of Bourbon, caramel, molassas, and some faint vanilla. The taste was pretty good too. The Bourbon kicked in on the tounge for a really nice sweet flavor. The mouthfeel was a little bit on the thin side I thought. My overall thoughts of this beer were kind of on the negative end. I liked the beer essentially but the price was hardest to swallow. The beer should have been much thicker I think, which would have given it a much better mouthfeel.

The aroma is quite complex and really shows the benefits of the barrel aging; this beer smells more like strait up bourbon than it does barrel aged beer. In some cases that would be a word of warning (such as the beers that we have all had that just seem like someone poured bourbon in right before it was bottled) but in this case it works magnificently and manages to convey all that is good about bourbon with just a touch of moderating influence from the complex character of the underling beer. The flavor is no less excellent as the fruity notes play with the whiskey and just a touch of the intense, sweaty hop character that I remember from the unaltered base beer. Overall it is a very nice beer, and one of the better uses of whiskey barrels in brewing that I have come across.","nickfl","Mar 30, 2011"

Carbonation is surprisingly strong for a 2009, justifying the difficulty in taking out this cork(yes I used a corkscrew and I am not a total weakling). A very special ale, rich malt and quality bourbon, with a bias towards being sweet. A nominal coconut taste and butteriness in the finish. A sipper. Thanks to my Southern trading partner. Oakiness is deep secondary and mellows and balances. Being a Canadian, I am neutral and not gaga about bourbon. Had again 5 months later and big coconut and bourbon smell.

There are certainly a few process issues with this beer - it's a little too bubbly, the head retention isn't great, and it's a little harsh and chemically after it nears room temperature ... but you almost want to forgive it for what it showcases here. A truly remarkable combination of flavors that pretty much proves why certain beers belong in barrels, I hope that North Coast can gradually tweak this one as they continue to produce it to address a few of the other issues present here to make a fully well-rounded beer.

Amazing complexity of blended dark fruits, caramel, bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, with a hint of cherry. DELICIOUS!

I am seriously splitting hairs here as I brew and used to regularly make wood aged beers, so I respect the velvet that they got in the mouthfeel. Don't get me wrong, this beer is really incredible, but to drink it for over $20 a bottle, it is quite prohibitive.

Lace was left all over the glass and looked great. The aroma was of a lightly sweet malt flavor with a bourbon background. The flavor is similar but the brew is much hotter than the smell. The sweet malt is mixed excellently with the bourbon and neither over powers the other. Which is very interesting again for this kind of brew. I feel like I'm going to say that through out this review. The brew warmed your belly like a strong drink would so this is a sipper by far.

Smells like bourbon heaven, including nice vanilla and oak, mixed with some dark fruits. Barrel aging has done something very nice to the nose of this beer. Creamy vanilla and oak bring this already excellent old ale to life. The booze is well hidden, popping up only a touch in the finish and in the warmth as it goes down. Otherwise, the characteristic flavors of dark fruits, rum raisins and maybe even a touch of leather appear underneath the star of the show- bourbon. Not the most balanced barrel aging, such that if you arenot a fan of bourbon, you are unlikely to like this beer. Regardless, the old ale seems to be a pretty good palate to cover in bourbon here. The mouthfeel has big carbonation, though not over the top and a small amount of creaminess is nice. Not overly thick or sweet.

Nice and thick on the palate, the beer holds onto carbonation well for a bohemoth. It's hot period.

As in the aroma, the barrel aging is prominent in the flavor. Lots of earthy oak, vanilla and prominent bourbon without being hot. Although the bourbon flavor is there it doesn't burn your chest or overpower the other characteristics. Lots of earthy, leathery malt with hints of toffee, hazelnut, caramel and biscuit. Sweet alcohol and dark fruit notes, mostly raisin, date, fig and plum. As mentioned above, there is only slight heat/warmth and the ABV of this beer is incredibly well masked. At this young of an age I was expecting this to be a complete boozy, bourbon bomb. Instead, it is a complex, flavorful, well balanced and quaffable barrel aged beer. I'm really looking forward to trying the brandy version and the earlier bourbon vintage.","corby112","Jan 17, 2011"

The high price for a small serving is not worth the asking price, it almost seems as if you are just seeing if you can get away with it.

4.27,-3.6,4,4.5,5,2.5,3.5,"Presentation is quite nice. Corked and caged brown painted glass bottle. The beer pours a very dark brownish ruby amber into my Bruery tulip. The ruby amber is mainly only at the outer edges and so dark it's almost black in the middle. A finger and a half of off white fizzy head that fairly quickly dies down to a ring of foam aroun the edge of the glass. Nice sticky legs left behind, no lacing though. The nose is of maple syrup, toffee, molasses, vanilla, some oak, and even hints of truffles. A very sweet and decadent aroma. Tastes is mostly the same plus there are notes of chocolate and the truffle notes are stronger. For the most part it's maple syrup, molasses, toffee, and brown sugar. Then oak and bourbon notes hit leaving a lasting bourbon laced truffle flavor lingering on the palate. The mouthfeel is on the low end of full bodied. In fact, it's surprisingly light in the mouth. The carbonation is quite high and assertive and creates a fairly dry finish. It's somewhat hot and warming going down. The carbonation is honestly a bit distracting. I don't mind the warmth and the alcohol being present. It's nice on a cold night, but the carbonation could have been toned down a bit for sure.","billshmeinke","Jan 09, 2011"

Smells intensly of vanilla and bourbon, lots and lots of vanilla in the nose. The firt sip blows you away, you can really see where the 18 months in bourbon barrels has shaped this brew. the taste follows the nose with tons of bourbon and vanilla and as it warms you get a beautiful caramel. Chewy, very very chewy. Feels like chewing a nice piece of caramel in fact. Slight alcohol sting in the back, but as it warms up it becomes alot more enjoyable.

Some very nice vanilla bourbon aromas are pretty strong on the nose alongside mild oaky, cocoa, and toffee notes. You could definitely smell the booze but its not overwhelming whatsoever. The vanilla and bourbon also dominated the palate with toffee, oaky, and cocoa accents but had mild butterscotch notes as well. There was lots of bourbon character but it was not hot at all, the booze was pretty well hidden. The brew was medium to full in body with a very pleseant amount of carbonation which had a sweet, bourbon, oaky, very mild boozy, and silky finish that lingered on the palate. Regardless of the ABV it drank better than I thought and was even more tastier than I thought. Very glad I got the chance to try this gem.","Gobzilla","Dec 31, 2010"
4.4,-0.7,5,5,4,4,4.5,"Split this with waltonc. Pours a rich golden brown with a frothy head. Smells of bourbon, vanilla, carmel apple, more bourbon, cinnamon, and burnt brown sugar. The taste follows the smell and it reminds me of Anchor Our Barrel Ale, as it is overall a fairly 'light' barrel-aged barley-wine (or old ale depending on definition). Medium to lighter bodied with ample carbonation. Actually could stand to tone down the carbonation a bit, but after it sits in a snifter for a while gets to an ideal carbonation on its own. This is very drinkable, and unfortunately has a very high price tag. I wish NCBC would have priced this more appropriately, but they went that route and thus, I'll search out other more affordable barrel-aged beers for enjoyment.","JoeySchlitz","Dec 31, 2010"

Mouthfeel is medium in body, a little sweet stickiness on the lips, and a slight bite on the tongue followed by the warmth of alcohol.

The sharper barrel notes, which the Bourbon brings out, are really nice though and make this beer different enough (in a good way) from the Brandy that I find that I am enjoying this beer far more than I thought I would. I really think that trying this beer after I sampled the Brandy one (separated by days) has made me enjoy this beer all that much more. If I had had it at the same time, or before the other one, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much. The differences that my memory has played out seem to be the most intriguing part of this beer. What this relies on though is the fact that this beer, while clearly barrel dominated, does not allow the barrel notes to overwhelm & marginalize the base beer. In the end it is a little too alcohol accented in the flavor to be on the same level as the Brandy barrel aged old stock, but it is still damn tasty and quite close.","Gueuzedude","Jan 04, 2008"
