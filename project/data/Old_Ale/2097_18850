A huge note of brandy and honey soaked raisins right away, followed by some burnt brownie, dark chocolate covered raisin, a little bit of tobacco and some rye bread. Finishes sweet and malty with a slight dryness from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is near perfect. Slick but well carbed, which hides the alcohol ridiculously well. Top notch.","notchucknorris","Feb 19, 2015"

4.35,1.6,3,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I thought this was very good beer and very good example of an Old Ale, Bell's Third Coast Old Ale was my favorite Old Ale, but I have to say after trying this I think 4D blows it out of the water, not that Third Coast Old Ale isn't great, 4D is just pretty much better in every aspect besides price and it's just a more intense and complex version of Old Ale that is just as smooth, maybe even smoother than Third Coast Old Ale which blows my mind. This beer had great drinkability, the 13.5 wasn't nearly as noticeable as I thought it would be, it was fairly smooth, complex, rich, a little sticky, pretty filling, and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I think one bottle would be the perfect amount for me and if I had the chance I would could probably drink two, but I'm sure i would be feeling it in the morning. What I liked the most about this beer was how well the alcohol was hidden, it seriously blew my mind that a 13.5% Old Ale could be this smooth, I'm very impressed by that and I thought the taste was awesome. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it just isn't a good looking, which overall isn't that big of a deal and I learned a while ago to never judge a beer on it's looks. I would for sure buy this beer if I ever saw it for sale, it's pretty pricey but I think it's worth it and it makes for a nice beer for a special occasions. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone who likes Old Ales or big beers in general, I don't think this will disappoint. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I expected good things from this beer but all together it exceeded my expectations and I think it's an overall great beer and I would love to try the barrel aged version of this one day and I'm pretty sure this would be a great beer to cellar and I think it could get even better with time. Great work guys, I think the Kuhnhenns are simply the best at what they do and this is a world class beer, keep up the great work guys.","StoutHunter","Jan 08, 2014"

Smell is a fusion of brandy/rum and beer with a heavy sweetness and lots of burnt sugar flowing into a heavy alcoholic presence. Some bits of dark roasted grains and yeasty fruitiness. Chocolate laps at the nose. Raisins and figs in there as well. Taste is densely sweet with the aforementioned raisins and figs. Notes of coffee and bitter cocoa powder. Hops are here in abundance and still they barely control the massive sugar content of this ale. Earthy in character and mildly pungent they bring a semblance of balance to this beer. Feel is thick. Thick like a sandwich from the Carnegie Deli in NYC, ( You can get four slices of extra bread and still have to stretch your mouth to bite it ). Carbonation is mild and gentle with enough pop to break up the syrupy, sticky nectar. This is a beer equivalent to Napoleon Brandy with a warming quality that keeps your swallows in check. Try to pound this one and you are lost cause. Sip, savor and warm up as you indulge your senses in this one. While it may work with sweeter desserts I'm thinking nuts and full flavored cheeses as a perfect compliment to this one.","scootny","Apr 02, 2013"

I know I'm probably one of the only people that thinks this, but I enjoy the regular 4D much more than the barrel-aged version. I don't believe that barrel-aging always makes things better, and here is a perfect example of that. Why? Bourbon barrel aging imparts a particular and dignified set of flavors; in my opinion, these flavors kind of mask what I love so much about 4D. Call it a barleywine or an old ale or whatever the hell you want - this beer is a perfect example of the capabilities of not only its style, but beer in general.

Even after aging for over a year, it's a bit boozy, but it's decently hidden with all of the different types of flavors flying around. Would like to try fresh to see if that affected the pour and carbonation, and I'd also like to try to the barrel aged version to see how that adds another awesome element of complexity.

There are maybe two fingers worth of khaki colored head crowning the beer, and head retention and lacing are just alright. The nose has a bevy of malty notes bouncing around. Light chocolate, caramel, burnt sugar, and a little bit of marshmallow all show up and blend together for a killer aroma. The flavor profile can’t quite keep up the same balanced complexity though. Caramel and burnt sugar move up from ensemble players in the aroma to the main attraction here. Milk chocolate falls way into the background, while the suggestion of marshmallow disappears. The mouthfeel is full bodied, but as rich as t could have been for 13.5% ABV. The carbonation is pleasantly understated, and there’s a pleasant warming sensation from the alcohol.

No head when poured, only a little bit of fizz. The smell is sweet, burnt caramel, a little bit of raisiny fruit, but all very balanced. The taste is much like the nose. It's very sweet with lots of the caramel mixed with that hint of fruit (but not all raisin - there is some tangy citrus to it as well). A little bit of burnt biscuit or something. Very complex and different things pop out with each sip. It's nice and thick. Almost syrupy and coats the whole palate. I don't get much of the alcohol heat, which is a change from the last time I had this Non-barrel version. I think the little bit of extra time it's had in the bottle was very good to the beer.","J0E","Dec 02, 2011"

It smells of sweet malts, some cherry, raisins, brown sugar, molasses, maple syrup, with some light oak. It's very sweet on the nose yet very aromatic. You can tell that it has aged well thusfar. The flavors too are on the sweet side. You get a lot of raisins, figs, dates, light oak/earthiness, with some vanilla as well. It's very complex and an interesting drink. It's kind of like sipping on a port. The sugar is holding me back from grading it higher. It drinks medium in body and is sticky on the palate. The flavors resonates for a few minutes after each sip. Overall this is a nice old ale, despite the grandiose amount of sugar. It's very, very complex and will make you think while you drink it. It's well worth your while.","aasher","0"

Taste reflects this without the metal note (which diminished with warmth), more dried dark fruits - berries and currants, booze, caramel and something I kept percieving as oak, although I'm confident this isn't oak aged. Mouthfeel was medium heavy, with a moderate sweetness that's restrained by some drier qualities throughout. Great drinkability, and doesn't even come close to feeling like the alcohol content advertised. Need to get my lips on the bourbon barreled version.","liamt07","Aug 28, 2011"

It pours a clear sunset russet topped by a half-finger of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises buttery toffee, light booze, white bread, maple syrup, and a few drops of chocolate syrup. The taste holds notes of boozy caramel, dark fruit (mostly fig-like, I'd say), pine sap, sourdough, very light chocolate powder, and honey. It's a strange grocery list, but it all comes together pleasantly on the tongue. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thick, almost chewy feel.

Overall, this is a bit too fresh perhaps, as the alcohol is quite apparent. However, the alcohol presence doesn't ruin this by any means.

The taste picks up a lot of the nice complex flavors in the aromas, especially the sweet caramel malt, milk chocolate, and toffee. A little bitterness coats the mouth on the finish. Warm, full bodied and medium carbonation, which is probably high for the style but works fine for me. A little hot going down. Overall, this is a fantastic, complex beer, a real sipper but still quite drinkable despite the body and alcohol.

There's a decent barrel presence with a good amount of oaky/wood flavor along with some more sweet booze. This beer is pretty complex but is very hot at this stage and the ABV is not very well masked. It's 13.5% and you can feel it in the finish.

Raisin and other dark fruits darn near fill the room, deep, rich and earthy, this is one of my favorite old ale smells. Good start. Taste is very sweet with that nice sweet, thin front and a touch of hops/bitterness in the back for balance. Just recently had a JW Lees 88, 99 and 08 and this tastes a lot like a slightly better version of the 99 I had. The sweetness here is aggressive and not as off putting as the Lees 99. That said, this beer is very, very similar. What I don't get is that essence of ham that sometimes comes up in the JW Lees for me, and for me, that makes this a winner. Mouthfeel is somehow thinner than what the sticky sweetness eludes to. If it were any thicker (it's still medium-heavy), the sweetness would cover the tongue and be offensive. So while thinner than expected, this is actually welcome. Overall, this beer is not exactly what I was expecting, but I am impressed that this tastes very similar to a beer aged 12 years, and yet comes off more drinkable and enjoyable. If it weren't so sweet, it would be phenomenal. Barely a touch of alcohol, which is very impressive.","seeswo","Mar 17, 2011"

The flavor is sweet to the point of almost being cloying, with all of the same flavors listed above, coming off very juicy overall. The mouthfeel is slick and oily on the palate. While drinkable, the alcohol is definitely there and can be smelled and tasted. Certainly not a gulping beer, as the strong tastes and ABV prevent that.

Sweet fruits especially on the front palate which is kind of odd, and some old hops bitter and balance it a bit. Kind of tangy, almost sour finish, but quite well put together.

Comes off with a caramel/toffee sweetness from the malts. Really caramellized nicely in there. With notes of chocolate and cocoa. There are also some notes of tobacco, and a slight mustiness (maybe it's my imagination on this last one). Really fascinating, and very deeply complex. The taste just really fascinates you from the first, particularly if you like some malt. It just comes out with caramel, like caramel coated, herby, grass/straw, cola flavored grain, great maltiness here - very complex, but really sort of comes outright and tells you it's here. I get a nice flavor of chocolate, a little roastiness, which blends with a slight alcohol burn. The little bit of age has done wonders, and I can tell it will hold up for longer. The body has a huge thickness, sticky and sweet, but the carbonation peeks through with a strong enough presence to keep it from being cloying. This is really a great display of malt, and I found myself continually drinking it, almost too much, so I couldn't wait on it to warm enough to see the differences in flavor.

The nose unfolds at a langorous pace, layers of candied nuts, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, baker's chocolate as well as prune, black raisin, cherry, apricot fruit, elusive smokiness and mossy notes, displays a great deal of power without clumsiness. Full-bodied and then some, covers every mouth pore like rubber glue. Given its texture and overall sweetness, does stay notably fresh and in movement. Avalanche of caramel, toffee, crème brûlée, butterscotch, chocolate, brown sugar, you name it. Maraschino cherry, poached apricot, golden raisin, prune, fig fruit. Candied tangerine citrus adds more sweet and sour. Carbonation behaves like a lava lamp. An edge of peat moss, charcoal, tar pulls it back from the precipice of oversweetness.

It tasted like super sweet prunes and molasses and raisins, with some honey wheat and rich brown sugar. This is the definition of cloying sweetness. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a lasting bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had a strange scent for an old ale, with a powerful taste that wasn't very complex but instead just a barrage of sweet dark fruits. It had good body, and hid the alcohol fairly well. But this really needs to be sipped due to all the sugar. A decent beer, but not really one of my favorite old ales.","Pencible","Nov 29, 2009"

Furthermore, despite considerable sweetness, this beer was not the least bit heavy, cloying or tiring on the palate. I get some slight woodiness on the finish, which only adds to the extremely long and smooth finish. Alcohol is noticeable, but is not intrusive in any way.

The body is still full and damn near perfect for an old ale. The alcohol may be a bit too fusel for some people, but I think that this '09 release will age absolutely fantastically for years to come.

The lacing on this one was heavy and of small bubbles that diminished quickly and left a light film hanging on the glass for the remainder of the tasting. At first glance I thought it had more the appearance of a Belgian Quad than an Old Ale and seemed a little thin, but I was definately wrong. The nose was of tobacco, dates, figs, and raisins. The taste basically matched the nose - dried fruits up front and a finish of tobacco, slight hop bitterness, booze, and that prototypical Old Ale basement mustiness. As for drinkability, I could drink this all night being an English Barleywine man, and the 12% ABV was well hidden. The mouthfeel on this one was simply amazing! The brew was thick, creamy, chewy, but finished relatively clean due to the high ABV.

They also covered the alcohol well in the taste. Flavors of port, more raisin notes, fresh apples and there was a very slight bit of smoke.

Taste is also dominated by sweet malt notes with some dry fruits (plums, figs). Full body with limited filtration and some low carbonation. No alcohol was discernable which is quiet a feta considering the ABV in this beer. Not as complex as I was expecting but very good nonetheless; a great late night sipper for sure.","Phyl21ca","May 03, 2008"

4.38,2.3,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall: Fourth Dementia is a complex brew that drinks more like a sherry or a liqueur. It is potent and forces you to respect that while remaining enjoyable. I can imagine sipping this on a cold New England evening in front of a fire. [Now if only I had a fireplace.] This might sound like heresy, but Fourth Dementia made me think of my experience --limited though it may be-- with Sam Adam's Utopias. Not the mouthfeel perse, but the flavor profiles are very similar. I wouldn't necessarily say that the Kuhnhenn is as good, however, I would say that if you want a hint of what can be found in a bottle of Utopias try Fourth Dimension at a fraction of the cost to see if it's up your alley.","3leggeddub","Apr 12, 2008"

Raisins and fig on the tongue first followed by an interesting piney hop flavor. Winey oak and dark cherries with some booze towards the end. Aftertaste is somewhat dry with hints of dates and brandy. Lots of malt throughout, but hops are there too. Medium to full body with a rich and creamy feel. Carbonation is light, but complements the mouthfeel so well. The alcohol is there, so this one is a sipper for sure.

Smells of licorice and blackstrap molasses, slightly treacly, and herbal, but not sweet. The taste starts with more of that European style licorice flavor- not sweet, but more earthy and bitter, in fact a deeply herbal bitterness is present in this beer, like Fernet Branca. To me, that is delicious, but be prepared for the amaro like bitterness. More blackstrap on the finish. Complex and delicious. Low carbonation and a tiny bit sticky in the mouthfeel, but still reasonable. Very interesting, I like this a lot, but I wouldn't call this a particularly balanced beer.","Georgiabeer","Beers"

An aggressive dark fruit fig and sweet molasses aroma. I'm REALLY taken in by the smell to the point of distraction; maybe i ought to take a mouthful. Wow, what a kick in the pants!. The mouth feel is first very creamy and medium large bodied. The fig of the nose comes through really strong in the flavor then its overwhelmed by an intense molasses taste. Quite sweet. The 9.5. ABV is warming to be sure. I'm not finding that level of alcohol distracting. I'm assessing the weight to be something that i wouldn't session (if i had a frig full of them...which, i don't), but I find it a cinch to drink and I'm savoring the balance as best I can. Lightly carbonated, there is plenty of the alcohol coming through on subsequent mouthfuls and the dark fruit character is lingering nicely.

Smells like cherry cough syrup, blackberries, hazlenut, hints of coffee, ethanol, strong malts. A pretty amazing come-hither odor. The flavor is cough syrup-forward, with hints of cherries. Body and finish are a much more inviting bland of cherry and chocolate with smokey, almost milky malts. Alcohol storng but not overpowering. Some phenolic qualities, and a hint of bitterness. Trends towards a beer liquor. Comparison to cough syrup hard to shed and i wish that flavor were less pronounced. Thick and full-bodied. Sticky and lip-smacking. Almost chewy. Overall, its a great beer, crazy and expertly crafted. The flavor is not as refined as i remember it being from tastes in the past, but i think perhaps its just too young.

Served in a Kuhnhenn tulip a nice deep ruby brown with a decent head that diminished to a ring and left a slight amount of lacing. The aroma was dominated by burnt caramel. The taste was a wonderfully complex blend of dried fruits, burnt caramel, molasses and loads of barley. The beer is very heavy, but gets much smoother as it warms, more taste comes out as well, this one is certainly a sipper. This was an extremely wonderful beer, but it's certainly a sipper.

4.4,2.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"In many ways 4th dimension is much more like a cordial or after dinner liquor than a beer. Its viscosity appears as such and its booziness is so forthright, rich, and fiery in powerful ways. The appearance is quite pleasing  a deep crimson tinged ruby body. Truly a unique and brilliant color. Lacing is minimal to say the least but thats highly forgivable in such a large beer. Fruity alcohol aromas dominate the nose. Raspberry, mulberry, and cherry. Then toffee and biscuits come into play and finally the whole endeavor is finished with tobacco and rounded out with vanilla. The flavor doesnt diverge much from the nose. Dark fruits rule here as well, mostly berries but also some plum and raison. Toffee is also a large component. Herbal, boozy finish. Not drinkable in large quantities. A real after dinner sort of sipper and quite the well rounded, hyper warming, fun big beer. I would really like a growler or two of this around Christmas to sip on while sitting around the fire.","DaPeculierDane","Sep 06, 2007"

The flavor is much the same, rich caramel and coffee, lightly smoked, dark raspberry and cherry. The finish carries a light buttery sweetness but also some hop tang creating some bitter notes. The mouthfeel is a bit flat from the lack of carbonation, but the syrupy thickness gives it some depth still. Overall, this was a malt bomb with a bit of age on it.

Candied papaya and other fruits. Colored with clouded pale mahogany with deep ruby-brown core and sunset fringes. Rim of off-white. A quiet silky smooth palate of fresh creamy raisins and loads of tawny caramel malts. A highlight of fresh black cardamon pods over the yeast character. A background of tooth-biting hop flavor rallied around a lemon kiss in the middle of the tongue. Sweet mexican cocoa powder and heavy british toffees with faint buttermilk arise from the middle. Alcohol alights the sinuses, however gently. Beautifully malt flavors. A touch cloying and clingly. Dark sugars fringes edge towards a hint of medicine notes, which keep this from excelling. But, the dry chocolate and faint coffee highlights are especially appreciated. Faint oxidation.","CharlesDarwin","Dec 10, 2006"

Can keep it in your mouth forever and the longer you wait the more you find. Alcohol comes through in the finish, accompanied by a last-minute hoppy bitterness. It could be a desert beer - but there are so many layers to the malt that you don't really consider it a sweet beer while you drink it. A thick head was not expected for this style, however it did seem slightly under-carbonated - perhaps a bit more and the palette would be opened up to dig through the layers of flavor.

Light bitterness in present in the taste but it is balanced and overpowered by the sweet rich malty flavors.

Just a faint amount of light can pass through. Bright ruby highlights along the outside of my glass. Absolutely no lacing, but has an oily, syrupy consistency about it. Heavy aroma of molasses, malt, candy, and dark fruits. Nice taste, very sweet, a combination of molasses, candy and maybe apple cider. It leaves with a slight alcohol burn. Slick, smooth mouthfeel and finishes slighly dry. Drinkability is tough due to the high alcohol content. Don't get me wrong, this brew has an awesome taste.

Smells of alcohol right up front but there are a lot of others things in there as well including maple, dark fruit, ripe melon, and apples like green apples. The taste is burning from the start with the alcohol but like a good scotch or brandy it only scours the tastes buds to open them up for all the taste coming afterwards. Heady malt complexity with a slight hint of char and raisins, there are some bitter hops but no flavor and again a weird green apple finish that I would call an of flavoring. I think this could have used a little more oxidation overall. The mouthfeel suffers due to the high alcohol feel the taste was fine but the burning in my throat made it a little hard.

French toast maple and bready richness form a sweetened candi sugar base among which the vegetal, barky and leafy hints are envelopped. Strong earthy vinous character, cognac-like smooth alcohol burn. Heavy toasted malts bring forth smoky tones that are later replaced by almost roasted grains.

Taste is heavenly- evolves over a few minutes from a smooth, somewhat sweet caramel and roast malt to a musky and oh- so slightly vaguely herbal flavor with malt predominance. Really beautiful in the mouth with just the right amount of heat. It was easy to slow down and enjoy this beer over an extended period of time, given the number of flavors going on here, and even easier to order another. Not necessarily easy to get off the stool and walk home without stumbling, though at 9.5%. So worth it, though.","amicar","Aug 03, 2005"
4.59,7.2,3.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Wow!! This is an unbelieveable beer. It begins by pouring a sludgy, brownish color. Has a small, and quickly dissipating tannish head. Overall the initial appearance is not as impressive as could be. However, other attributes more than make up for this shortcoming. Fourth Demetia has a deep and malty aroma. Hints of caramel and chocolate are followed by a slight hoppy undertone. It smells sweet and full. Very nice in the nose. The taste can be summed up by two words: sweetness galore. I can really distinguish the malt and caramel in this beer. A bit of an alcohol taste is present and hangs around afterward for a bit. But that doesn't bother me at all. Hops are also noticealbe. All and all this is a well balanced and nice taste. In the mouth this beer is full and biting. It is a very strong, heavy and formidable beer on the tongue.

Treacle and caramel-minor trace of alcohol in the finish. Slight nutty flavor behind it all. Overall quite complex. Gargantuan body though a tad overly sweet and cloying. A hell of a big beer and quite enjoyable. Like the label says it could use another 4 months of aging but its enjoyable now.

It is a sweet caramel malt flavor with just enough noble hops bitterness to balance this big boy out. There are some hints of raisin, sherry, molasses and brown sugar along with some alcohol warming.

Anyways, this one came in a lovely Balloon glass, the colour was dark bloody red/black, but not quite opaque. Head was light khaki and lasted for quite a while providing the glass with some lovely lacing patterns as well. Aromas are impressive, old ale notes of raisins, figs, other dark fruits and residual sugars, molasses, brown sugar, etc. hops are leafy and good in this mix, malts are dark roasty and hella complex. Middle is doughy and fruit with a rum raisin sort of kick to it that really does it for me. Finish is leafy hops and dark patent malts with some caramel hints, and a somewhat wet and drying contrasting finish that makes this exceptionally drinkable.

Malty sweet flavour to start, it just gets more and more complex. Caramel, toffee, molasses, and ripe fruits are strongest initially, with a bit of oak, vanilla, and nuttiness underneath. Bitterness comes forward part way through and a very light hoppiness appears towards the end, but it remains very, very restrained. The finish is a combination of caramel sweetness and warm alcohol flavour. Full, chewy body that stops just short of being syrupy, with moderately low carbonation.

Strings of lace were left coating the glass and the head was revived easily with a few swirls of the snifter. Upon first smell of this brew I new this would become a favorite of mine. There was just so much going on I knew I would need more than this one to figure it all out. Smokiness was big as was the chocolate and roasted malt. Some dark fruit and earthy/woody notes were in there as well. Damn there was so much going on I sat there for a while with my nose just in the glass trying to take it all in. The taste was just as complex and enjoyable as the aroma. Dark fruits, molasses, chocolate malt and smoke seem to be the most upfront flavors. An assortment of other flavors were present as well spice, caramel, alcohol, woodiness and everything else you could imagine. Wow this is one amazing brew. The full thick body leaves your mouth coated in sticky flavor that seems to stay with you forever. Drinkability is insane, every sip leaves you wanted more to discover new things about the beer.

Capped with a foamy, ruddy brown head that fades quickly but leaves a satisfying lacing for the duration. Aroma is way out there and in your face, bold as can be, plump full of raisin, plum, and oh so sweet caramely malt. Body isn't quite heavy, making it dangerously drinkable for a reasonably potent brew. Flavor is complex like one of those jigsaw puzzles in which all the pieces look alike, it's almost indescribable. I get elements of chocolate toffee, fermented raisin, caramel, and molasses out of this rich dark beauty. Just a slight drip of maple syrup as well. Phenomenal for sipping or drinking in moderation, you're longing for more when the glass is empty. There is a nice warmth in the finish and just a bit of bitterness on the back and sides of the tongue, also unveiled are soft creamy vanilla and woody notes.

This brew poured from the bottle like thick syrup - a deep, dark, murky brown-red-purple with a slight tan head which eventually reduced to a few constantly swirling bubbles. I smelled this beast of a brew the second the cap came off. As intense an aroma as I've ever come across & a delightful one at that. Massive dark fruit notes are everywhere as powerful caramel & burnt burgundy cherries collide with dulled spicy hops & oaken woodiness to overpower the senses. From the moment it hit my lips I was in heaven. This extremely sweet, but perfect balanced brew overloaded my palate with pounds of dark chocolate & rich caramel. More delicious flavors of chocolate covered burgundy cherries, vanilla, and molasses compliment the mild spicy hops & notes of oak. Warming alcohol makes its presence felt from the start & only adds to the intense appeal of this brew. Minimally carbonated, but extraordinarily full bodied, this bad boy fills & coats the mouth like maple syrup. Finishes with some tartness, burnt molasses, & toffee.
