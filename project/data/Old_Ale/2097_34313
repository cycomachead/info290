4.13,-9.4,3.5,4.75,4,3.75,4,"Ruby brown color with a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly. Toffee, fruity, vanilla, and light oak with hints of molasses and alcohol make up most of the aroma. Smells quite sweet but I like it. The flavor is sweet and fruity with bits of caramel and burnt sugars. Light vanilla and wood with some solid warming alcohol. Thick body with a sweet sticky mouthfeel. Great sipper!","johnnnniee","Jan 09, 2015"

4.44,-2.6,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: A fantastic, top-tier old ale. Loads of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and booze, with some nice fruit undertones. It's a lot like some of the best English-style BA barleywines, but a good deal sweeter and more sherry-forward. I think I favor 4D over BB4D. The regular has a lot of the same aromas and flavors as BB4D, but it was slightly less sweet and lacked the boozy sherry punch that BB4D delivers. I would've liked a bit more bourbon presence - for whatever reason I am picking up a lot of sherry or some kind of sweet liquer - but I'm not complaining.","blankenhoney","Dec 30, 2014"

Very complex and delicious aroma! Toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, and molasses on the palate. Smooth with a little alcohol heat. Outstanding! Full bodied with light carbonation, this beer coats the mouth with velvet smoothness. I'm not an expert in old ales by any stretch of the imagination, but I can't think of a better example of the style than this exemplary crafted beer!","JohnG190","May 29, 2014"

It pours a muddy looking chestnut brown with almost no head or lacing but tons of boozy legs. The nose is a caramely sweet, bourbon boozy, earthy blend of heaven. The mouthfeel is thick and very sticky. Lots of caramel malts and alcohol to thicken this up. The body is more akin to something cloying like Kahlua or Baileys more than most beers. The flavor is every gorgeous thing that the nose promises. Sweet, boozy, earthy, and rich. This is absolutely outstanding. I can only hope that I can get my hands on some to add to my cellar.","lochef81","May 20, 2014"

4.68,2.6,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Pours a murky amber capped by a very light beige one and half finger creamy head. Dissipates within a couple of minutes, but above average retention for a BA brew, just a few hints of lacing. Bold nose, deep aroma of dark fruit, oak, brown sugar, toffee all capped by bourbon booziness. Opens with dark fruit including black cherries, sugar plums, prunes and raisins, and hints of dates joined by rich molasses, caramel, and brown sugar, some nuttiness and biscuit accents midpalate. Finishes with toasted oak, vanilla, continued dark fruit, and pleasant bourbon booziness. Low carbonation, syrupy full body that is amazingly smooth and velvety with just a bit of creaminess. This amazing brew is definitely one of my personal favorites. One of, if not the best BA Old Ale available. Whether fresh or aged this ridiculously complex brew delivers.","chanokokoro","Beers"

Huge amounts of vanilla, toffee, caramel, burnt sugar, toasted coconut and booze on the nose. Taste is truly superb. Lots of vanilla up front, with caramel in the middle and a slight alcohol burn on the back end. It's a welcomed feeling, that cuts through the sweetness. Low carbonation on this one, very viscous, coats the mouth and lingers a long time. Just really really good.

4.74,3.9,4,5,4.5,5,5,"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, 2011 Winter Solstice bottling. Pours dense nearly pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a patchy lace cap that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge caramel, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, maple syrup, raisin, toast, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark bread, tobacco, light cocoa, and toasted earthiness. Absolutely insane aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, maple syrup, raisin, brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark bread, light cocoa, light tobacco, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark bread, light cocoa, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of malt and barrel flavors; with a perfect barrel/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely world class old ale! All around insane complexity and balance of malt and barrel flavors; and dangerously smooth to sip on considering the very high ABV. Unbelievably amazing offering.","superspak","Nov 19, 2013"

Quite complex, well balanced, smooth and and very, very tasty. I think this might be my new favorite old ale, which was previously Fruet and Cuir.

4.56,0,4,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring. The smack of bourbon was so genuine, warm, inviting, and integrated, it seems hard to imagine the beer without it. This plays excellently off the hearty malt sweets of caramels, toffees, and roasty milk chocolates, acting as the unifying feature of smoothness to blend everything together. The booze is big, and this guy does everything in its power to hide that, much in the same way that Bourbon County is so sweet. Here we don’t come quite as close to that ultimate balance, but we actually are left a bit of room for that bitterness of not only booze, but grain as well, to poke through. The nose is comparatively softer, but inclusive of most of what you want, while the sip is sticky, frothy, and robust. This all makes for an incredibly balanced yet unique beer that will leave you screaming for more.","TheBrewo","May 24, 2013"

Smell is an amazing blend of vanilla caramel, chocolate, oak, bourbon and maybe some brandy. Beautiful. Surprisingly mellow flavor. Bready malts and chocolate fade into strong vanilla oak and subtle caramel notes. Bourbon is there up front but dissapates into the complexity of the barrels quickly.

The taste reflected the aroma, thick caramel and brown sugar, vanilla, woody bourbon, plums, raisins. Great, though unlike some other big old ales and barleywines, the flavor seemed to fade a bit as it warmed...maybe it was just my palate adjusting and/or numbing to the alcohol, which was definitely present, but relatively well-hidden.

Its sweeter than I imagined it would be, definitely more ""lush"" of a taste compared to other bourbon barrel aged beers I've had. Mouthfeel is very well balanced and very big, definitely a slow sipper sort of beer, though despite its ABV it doesn't show, its hidden quite well.

The color of the body was dark mahogany, almost like coca cola, and the head formed a tight, lasting cafe-colored barrier near the rim of my snifter. Smells oaky and strong scents of alcohol. The taste was unbelievable. It was soooo smooth. This beer hit with many flavors-apple, bourbon, coffee, chocolate and finished with warm alcohol overtones. The alcohol was present thorough-out, but it seemed to bite more at the end. The mouth-feel was medium creme body. The body was consistent and allowed for ""timed released flavor"" waves to hit your palate. This beer is excellent and a must try for anyone passing through Warren, MI. The brewery is great too! It is very low-key and prices are very reasonable.","drinknewbelgium","May 28, 2012"

4.55,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"O- I am very surprised at the approachability of this beer considering it is a bourbon barrel aged old ale weighing in at 13.5%. There is only a hint of heat on this, and it acts as a nice balance to the sweetness. I've had beers with less alcohol and much more age feel hotter (I'm looking at you, clowns at Goose Island). A very nicely crafted ale. One of the best, if not the best old ale I've tried so far. The only thing hampering its overall score for me is the appearance....but fortunately, its the least important factor when enjoying a beer in my opinion (so I bumped it up a bit to account for my overall enjoyment of the beer).","TK5150","Mar 28, 2012"

Pours a brownish-plum hue with a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head that quickly disperses into a tight band around the shoulders. The nose on this beer is fantastic - toffee, butterscotch and bourbon notes - the nose screams sugary sweet and booze. Taste follows nose. All I can say is wow! The elements of the nose really coalesce nicely in the flavor profile. There is definitely a distinct ethanol presence as well as a trace of maple syrup. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a carbonation level that is just shy of still; there's just a residual tingle on the tongue. There's also surprisingly very little alcohol heat on this beer despite the 13.50% abv. This is a fantastic BA Old Ale. I'd love to sit on a couple of these to see how they develop over time.","Jwale73","Feb 18, 2012"

The nose is a straight up bourbon bomb, mixed with some vanilla and cocoa. The taste also proves to be absolutely laden with bourbon. This is 13.5%, and I feel like I can taste every last tenth of a percent of the alcohol. The taste otherwise mirrors the nose. The mouthfeel on this is pretty hot. Again, very booze forward. There's a mild dark fruit overtone on the finish, but it's tough to distinguish through the pervading alcohol.

4.89,7.2,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Big thanks to maddog for this unexpected treat; it landed on my doorstep, unsolicited, out of the blue, one glorious day, along with a few other treats. Needless to say, I was flabbergasted by your thoughtfulness, Mike. The brew pours a deep fudgy-brown color, and is topped with a small cap of wispy tan froth. It looks sludgy and ominous. The nose offers a good deal of Bourbon, but is not perceived as 'hot' in any way. It is more an amalgam of wood, vanilla, buttery notes, and sweet booze, which is not potent with any one aspect, but is domineering in totality. The flavor follows the nose with additional complement of toffee-caramel notes; this beer is tremendously well-apportioned in the sense that everything works so well together. There is a sort of molasses thread that runs through everything, and the brew also seems to have a fair amount of Dark/Navy Rum nuance to it. The feel is ridiculously creamy, with a very soft petillance. Overall, this beer is insane; I want more.","ktrillionaire","Aug 25, 2011"

Nice notes of chocolate and dark fruits. Finish is earthy and mellow and very well done. Feel is light syrup with a perfect amount of carbonation.

This is defintitely a sipper in the best sense of the term. There is so much flavor in each sip; it is best enjoyed in small doses over an extended period of time.

The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, caramel, sweet alcohol, and dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. This brew was very Barleywine-ish in flavor and aroma if I am honest. This is definitely a good thing though as all of the flavors were mixed together quite well.

Guess I can't be too upset, right? It pours a mostly clear sienna-ruby topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel malts (a big whiff of a generic malt bag, baby), light bourbon, very light oak, vanilla, butterscotch, and very light roasted malts. The taste holds notes of light cocoa, sweet toffee, light bourbon, oak, vanilla, buttercream, mandarin orange syrup, and caramel. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an almost chewy feel. Overall, a very good brew, one that, on the surface, at least, seems to have taken to the barrel aging rather well. Get some.","TMoney2591","Jul 18, 2011"

It smells like chocolate and dark malts from the time you crack the bottle, the chocolate is the easiest to pick out. the taste of chocolate and something mixed in there, its hard to pick it out, i bet this beer gets insane after a year or two. let some of the mixed flavors separate a little. The mouthfeel let me down a little even though you can tell from the taste that hops arent a big figure in this, its not light and its not lively. there is no attack on your tongue from the carbonation. overall, this beer to quote my friend is fucking awesome, i could drink this once a week on friday and be totally happy, my friend actually thought this was a bba imp stout when he had some at DLD. i say get some if you can cause this rocks....Hard","kaips1","Jul 16, 2011"

This one is very barrel forward, especially after the swallow, and although I usually like my BA beers a little more nuanced, this one just seems to work. The base beer and relatively full bodied palate are big enough to support the big barrel presence, making it a delicious brew as opposed to a harsh booze bomb. It is, admittedly, still a little hot, but with a little time, this will be outstanding. In fact, according to the masses, it already is outstanding. I can’t argue with that.

4.47,-2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Thanks to Alex for hooking me up with this on a great trade. Deep dark brown appearance with just a hint of red. An aggressive pour yielded a half finger head that quickly faded, but with decent lacing. Powerful, complex nose loaded with oak, toffee, burnt sugar, figs, and vanilla along with hints of caramel and maple. The taste is just as bold and complex as the nose. The oak and bourbon hit you right off the bat. Sweet caramel, vanilla and raisins with hints of maple syrup, chocolate and brown sugar with just a subtle touch of coconut. All that sweetness is nicely balanced with a nice, albeit subdued, hop bitterness that really emerges as it warms. The alcohol is well hidden until the finish, where there's a nice slow, warming burn. Slightly syrupy, slightly chewy, but very smooth mouthfeel, especially considering the 13.5 ABV. This is definitely a sipper, but I'm really wanting to crack another. The regular Fourth Dementia was great, but this is world class. Another great Michigan beer!","beerdrifter","Jun 22, 2011"
3.69,-19.1,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"O: Good, but hot in terms of alcohol. This beer was shared with me at the Clusterfork # 4 tasting event at the Bruery. Unfortunately, I have not had the regular version for a better base comparison. However, knowing straight bourbons, it was pretty heavily infused into the beer. If you love bourbon, then that’s a plus, if you want more balance, as I do, then this beer might have gotten too much residual bourbon from the wood in the barrel. It's still good, but is very much a sipper of a beer, and even 12 oz split a 3 ways, was plenty @ 13.50%","Retsinis","Beers"

3.57,-21.7,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a dark amber color ale with a tiny foamy head with limited retention and no lacing. Aroma of bourbon is quite intense with lots of brown sugar notes and light dry fruits. Taste is dominated by bourbon notes with light alcohol ester and some brown sugar with dry raisins notes. Body is quite full with medium to low carbonation and some alcohol was apparent. Interesting and very intense and complex but still a notch below the regular version.","Phyl21ca","Jun 13, 2011"
4.19,-8.1,4,5,4,3.5,4,"The flavor shows off every inch of the +13% ABV; the regular 4D (and even 5th Dementia) do better at hiding this. Chocolate-covered cherries and dark rum notes swirl and warm the cheeks and stomach while a dose of English toffee and golden raisin linger after the booziness fades. Body is chewy and thick, but delicately carbonated. The alcohol is strong, and seems to get stronger as the beer warms. Set aside a lengthy sipping time for this beer, or better yet, share it with a friend. A full bottle, while delicious, is almost too much to handle in one sitting. Give it a few years in the cellar if you're the adventurous type.","wagenvolks","Jun 12, 2011"

If a little hotness fades with some aging I could easily see this beer pushing the score into my very top tier.

Never thought this would live up to the first batch from a few years ago, I am glad I was wrong. The appearance on draft wasn't much to write home about, brownish in color with almost no head on my pour. The aroma is where this beer starts to pick up some steam. Caramel, oak, vanilla with a hint of bourbony booze. Flavor continues to much the same with a huge hit of vanilla and caramel with a touch of fruitiness as it warms. The alcohol is definitely present but I did not find it overwhelming. Given the opportunity this will age beautifully.","Puddintane","May 03, 2011"

Kuhnhenn definitely hit the nail on the head with this one, it is an absolute gem of a beer and I feel privileged to have had the chance to try one.

4.67,2.4,3.5,4,5,5,5,"Bourbon Barrel 4th Dimension pours an intense mahogany, with a nice cherry shimmer along the edge of the glass when it's held up to light. There's a small amount of khaki colored foam capping it as well. Caramel is the clear standout in the smell department, it actually reminds me of the smell of the ice cream place I work for making their hot caramel topping. There's also an undercurrent of vanilla running throughout the nose, and a definite bourbon note is present as well. The aroma was good, but from the first sip this beer blasted off into the topmost echelon of any beer I've ever had. Caramel is still there in spades, and is again joined by vanilla and an impressively smooth bourbon quality. Newcomers to the party include flavors of creamy milk chocolate and and toasted marshmallows. There's also a delightfully mild warming sensation from the alcohol. It's absurd to think that this one's 13.5% alcohol, because it drinks like it's only about 9%. The body is impossibly rich and creamy, and is balanced by the absolute perfect carbonation, it's just enough to balance the sweetness and prevent the beer from coming across as cloying. Bourbon Barrel 4th Dementia reminds me a lot of the draft pour of Abacus I had a few weeks ago (which I guess makes sense seeing as I've never seen there to be a huge line between English Barleywines and Old Ales in the first place), and is one of the better beers I've ever had.","axeman9182","Apr 29, 2011"

Quite deep and old feeling but still very lively and assertive. Fairly high carbonation upfront. Flavor is really big, assertive malt, hot throughout. A lot of that tobacco and leather quality. Pleasant oxidization, spicy on the finish. Dark fruits like plums and dates, some cookie-like qualities to this as well. The sweet fruits play with the old leather, tobacco and spices really well.

After a vigorous pour it is a dark brown with very little head. Not much in the way of streaming bubbles. I smell bourbon, molasses, raisin and a little vanilla. Not an overpowering taste of bourbon, but I also get some molasses and raisin. The 13.5% alcohol is very well hidden. The mouthfeel is the only let down for me. It has a full body with very little carbonation. I picture this not unlike a drink that they would have in the medieval times. I guess that makes sense, since its an Old Ale. This will take me a while to drink, and I'll savor every sip. Overall, very complex brew, but the lack of carbonation makes me lower the score a little.","33nickadams","Apr 21, 2011"

I really wish I had more, but I'll let my last bottle cellar for a couple years before I try it again.","joshuaseresse","Feb 14, 2011"
4.62,1.3,4,4.5,5,5,4,"Miraculously, this seems to have fallen off, especially the mouthfeel. It doesn't have the complexity it once had, it seems to have lost it in the past few months. It's just become mellow. Tons of honey. Still excellent. 4.5/4.5/4.5/4","DefenCorps","Feb 12, 2011"
4.27,-6.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark reddish-brown with a very thin, short-lasting head. Some legs around the edges of the glass plus a bit of a thin collar. Nose is really nice and complex with bourbon, dark fruits, brown sugar, and plenty of malt sweetness. Everything is integrated well and there's just a bit of booze in the background. The flavor isn't quite as complex, but I still really enjoyed it. A bit more booze in the flavor than was present in the nose. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth; the bourbon and booze integrate well with the body on this. Very delicious and I'm looking forward to some aged bottles of this in the future.","Thorpe429","Feb 11, 2011"
4.47,-2,4,4.5,5,4.5,3.5,"This beer is comparable to a fine vintage or tawny port, and would work equally well at the conclusion of a fine meal. Just an altogether excellent fine aged ale from the folks at Kuhnhenn.","John_M","Feb 10, 2011"
4.47,-2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Beer is medium in body and completely coats the mouth. It's sweet up front and gives way to a nice smooth liquor flavor on the midpalate leading to a mild but clean bitterness at the back, it's subtle but there. The whole beer is good. I want to hold it in my mouth. There is a nearly treacle-like sweetness through out, minimal esters and other characters. A very good beer.","drabmuh","Feb 08, 2011"
4.97,9,4.5,5,5,5,5,"D- Ive had this twice in a month. Sadly I think thats probably going to be the last time I have it. No, Ill totally be driving the 4 hours to Warren to snag this again. Simply the best beer I've ever had.","MbpBugeye","Feb 08, 2011"
4.62,1.3,4,4.5,5,5,4,"Muddy reddish-brown with little head, low carbonation. Good enough for what it is. The aroma, on the other hand, is incredible. Burnt sugar, integrated oak and bourbon, stewed dark fruits. Some leathery, port-like oxidation, too. Very little noticeable alcohol. The taste, likewise, is incredible. Brown sugar/molasses flavors provide a backbone for notes of leather, and bourbon. There's a nice fruitiness that's date-like, and graceful oxidation that lends a touch of port and cocoa. The body is full, carbonation low. A little too easy to drink. This reminds me quite a bit of Kuhnhenn's 2005 bourbon barrel aged barleywine.","largadeer","Jan 28, 2011"
4.32,-5.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a full bodied brew, smooth with a modest amount of carbonation. It is quite drinkable with more of an herbal earthy bitterness and dryness that I was not expecting. Very well done and a complete transformation from the non-barreled version that I had not too long ago. This could be a real gem in a few years, wish I had a bottle or two to stash away.","stakem","Jan 23, 2011"
4.29,-5.9,4,5,4,4.5,4,"Do yourself a huge favor...pick up at least two of these and drink one now. Then age the other as long as possible. I think that will reveal this beers true potential which I forecast will be amazing.","GoGriz","Jan 22, 2011"

4.47,-2,4,4.5,5,4.5,3.5,"D - Splitting a 12oz bottle three ways was an appropriate serving, although I could probably tackle a bottle on my own if I was feeling ambitious. This should cellar extremely well and should only improve with age.","MasterSki","0"

4.97,9,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Overall this was fantastic. My first two BA beers from them have both been two of the best I haev ever had. They really know what they are doing with this one. To be honest I have to score this high, as I really have had maybe one or two beers that I truly liked better then this in the style at all. Damn near perfection and something I would only wish I could get again. Hopefully I can trade for another bottle.","mikesgroove","Jun 29, 2008"
3.99,-12.5,3,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"D- Honestly, I liked kuhnhenn's bourbon barleywine a lot better. This reminded me a lot more of extaneous ale and was a little over the top for me.","Lothore","Feb 29, 2008"
4.67,2.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"12'er. Big time nose of raspberry covered chocolate, caramel, toffee, vanilla, bourbon and charred wood. Dark color. Extremely complex malt and yeast character with an array of caramel, chocolate and fruit-like flavors then on top of all that, it has an intriguing barrel character as well that just takes it to another level. Damn good beer.","Crosling","Sep 10, 2007"
4.82,5.7,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Very dark brown, mahogany edges with a fine beige cap and lots of spotty, streaky lacing. Tons of caramel and toffee with a rich earthy/oaky aroma. Some vanilla and raisin, mild booze. Balanced bitterness keeps the big malty sweetness in check. Caramel and toffee, mild woody character, tootsie roll, some chocolate character. Amazing, rich flavour. Full bodied, low carbonation makes it a little heavy, smooth texture. Kuhnhenn has a knack for making big beers extremely drinkable. The barrel aging didn't overpower the base beer, which I found really appealing, while adding a new complexity to a great old ale.","DrJay","Aug 06, 2007"
4.77,4.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Again, Kuhnhenn does not disappoint. This is one hell of a tasty old ale! Definitely worth seeking out.","fartingdog","Jun 09, 2007"
4.97,9,4.5,5,5,5,5,"drinkability is excellent. the 7 or so months since i purchased this bottle has given it time to mellow out and removed all the 'hot' alcohol i noticed when fresh. perfect balanced, with a more mellowed warmth than the regular 4th dementia. i thought the drinkability on that one was excellent, but this brings it to a new level. fantastic stuff.","grub","May 20, 2007"
4.92,7.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Pours cola in color with an amber hue, nice and murky, a faint skirmish of caramel colored bubbles skim the surface and then quickly fade. I can smell this beer instantly, the woodiness and rich malts waft up and have me salivating. Aroma is hugely rich and sweet with prunes, caramel, grapes, and vanilla, as well as a large deep leather and wood aroma to balance the sweet along with a faint soy sauce. Taste follows suit with some hugely rich and sweet pruney and caramel maltiness and a nice dose of woodiness that mingles with a warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, a slight tingle from the woodiness blends with the warm alcohol in a slightly dry finish. This beer has pretty much floored me, I love the regular 4th and this is far and above, extremely complex aroma, extremely rich taste, a sipper for sure, but a heavenly one at that. Cheers to Kuhnhenn for making such an incredible beer.","hoppymeal","Feb 19, 2007"

3.29,-27.9,3,4,3.5,3.5,2,"As for drinkability, this beer was definitely a sipper. Even with the strong flavors and aromas, I felt that the alcohol intensity was overwhelming (though not surprising at 13.5% ABV).","Damian","Feb 04, 2007"
4.6,0.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Tastes like a sort of chocolate liquor. Chocolate covered strawberries with a stray raisin thrown in for good measure. Sharp clean alcohol sting and dry finish. Not strong oak, refined and well done. Minimal char mixes with chocolate and toffee. Chocolate candy with vanilla-liquor center. Caramel is buried, some sherry malt-oxidation and a smidge of butterscotch (not diacetyl). Thick smooth body could overbear, but the alcohol cleans. Mild carbonation. Fantastic beer.","mentor","Jan 16, 2007"
4.67,2.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"On tap at Spuyten Duyvil, Bklyn, NY, as part of their Big Fattys celebration or month long ode to strong and barrel aged beer. This one seemed to be the hot beer according to the gathered throng of BA beer aficionados, so I gave it a try. Poured into a tall wine glass, it exhibited low carbonation, minimal head and next to no lacing. Dark, muddy and dark milk chocolaty looking. Big nose of bourbon, raisins, figs and some alcohol. Served near room temp. on a freezing cold day. Soft, smooth, heady brew, plenty of rum raisin, vanilla, chocolate and dark malty goodness. Alcohol clearly present but did not take away from drinkability. World class sipper, night cap kind of brew. A welcome treat on tap.","Billolick","Jan 15, 2007"

4.95,8.6,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Pours fairly brown, but dark red when held to light, with a strong white head that retains very well and leaves retention. Surprising given the percent. Smell jumps out at you, moreso than some DIPA's even. The smell is of bourbon, brown sugar, cherry, molasses, vanilla, oak and maybe even some dates; remarkable. Taste is hard for me to keep track of, it just has so many flavors blended together so well. Seems like some of the bourbon beers I have had have too much bourbon, this is not the case with this one. Full bodied, with slightly higher than medium carbonation; a little less and this one's perfect. A damn near perfect sipper, I'd drink plenty of this if it was available. Well worth the very long trip to Michigan for it. Highly recommended.","badbeer","Dec 14, 2006"
4.85,6.4,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Roughly poured the head is wuite large and the lacing is seemingly sticky as all hell. The smell is just overwhelming with different flavors of a slight bourbon, fig, and it's just really complex...I can't put my finger on one thing before thinking of something else. The taste is HUGE, it's got a high alcohol kick with some great full flavors that won't let you down. There's a very sweet coffee roastiness and a huge fig flavor, but not totally fig, you'll notice some other flavors along with it. The mouthfeel was great, a little smooth, but there's an alcohol bite to it. Overall this is really great, I can't wait to age it for a few years and see how the flavors mellow.","Erdinger2003","Beers"
4.82,5.7,4,4.5,5,5,5,"Enjoyed this wonderful treat at Ashley's as a part of the Raspberry Eisbock Release Party. Tried this after the eisbock and wow was I blown away. Filled the snifter with gleaming dark ruby with russet brown edges. Small, ringy head of light khaki. Nose of rich, sweet malts. Sugary and fruity, with ample touches of oak, bourbon, vanilla, and alcohol. Taste follows suit. Incredible. Very malty, but not overly sweet. Sugary fruits, caramel, brown sugar, and toffee up front. Bourbon, oak, and madeira around the edges. Hop bitterness is moderate, stopping this malt bomb from being cloying. Finish is warming and whiskeyish and terrific. Velvety mouthfeel with perfectly modest carbonation. Full-bodied but not too syrupy or cloying. I drank three large snifters of this in a row and I still wanted more!","alexgash","0"
