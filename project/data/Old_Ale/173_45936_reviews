"Flat, baby Cherry Rye.  Thinner and less sweet but outstanding."

"Had both 2012 and 2014 variants. One was flat the was ok. Not sure where the hype comes from but this beer doesn't meet expectations I had for it. Not enough cherry, too much Tabacco taste (I'm a chewer) just not my gig...do get soMe raisin notes but that's about it. Without seeing what actual score is from above, I'd give it a 2.9..."

"Nice flavor to beer, but didn't like the lack of carbonation. Felt like I was drinking a port to a tee. Odd beer."

"Very complex beer.  When cold, heavy molasses, cherry, and sherry dominate.  Low carbonation,  which compliment the beer nicely.   As it warms the molasses takes a backseat, but it's still in the background.  Leather aroma, dark fruit and bourbon presents itself.  Fantastic old ale, love it."

"very few beers can rival this one in terms of complexity and depth, its downright enormous, and is so unique in the corded american strong ale world, i love it. thanks to drlovemd87 for unselfishly sharing yet another bottle of exceptional ale with me. dark auburn in color, syrup textured, dead still, heavily sedimented brew. black cherry color to match its added fruit. intentionally flat, i think maybe the carbonic acid exposure over time on a beer thats meant to be cellared like this one may denature or corrupt some of the fruit character and smoothness, which is why, i presume, they didn't carbonate it. a nose of medicinal cherries, over ripe black cherries, and a whole heaping tone of sweet grain. toffee and coffee and dark chocolate covered dried cherry come out in the flavor, and I'm amazed how little the alcohol shows up. its so thick too, viscous and pushing gelatinous in terms of mouthfeel, but i don't want it to have bubbles. the decadence of the feel makes me inclined to sip on it, rather than hammer it, which allows it to warm up, and man oh man does it warm up beautifully. the grain is never lost, but the cherry is dominant i think, especially at temperature, and especially in the finish. it kind of reminds me of one of those home spun booze infusions with fresh fruit, where you forget about a jug of whiskey for a few decades loaded with plums or something, very grandpa-like. so much texture, its palate coating and increasingly cherry focused as it warms. wonderfully done beer here, like nothing else I've come across in terms of enormity and grace. as much a cordial as it is an ale. wish we could get their beer in colorado, i don't think anyone here does beer quite like this."

"The 2014 vintage is a hit. Very much a beer to sip and contemplate. I'd compare it to a liqueur due to it's puny carb presence but it's much more than a liqueur could ever be. Huge depth of flavor, keen integration of the cherry, barrel, and base beer flavors. It's hard to knock the beer for something that actually may help it stand apart from others. Not many beers are near flat and most that are fail to offer any intrigue, yet Cherry Adam has such sharp, vinous, deep, and rooted flavors that it delivers a near wine-like, spirit hybrid type experience."

"Overall- This is an awesome take on the base Adam, which I just had recently two days ago and it's on the same level as the base beer. The cherries do cover up a little bit of the complexity that Adam has, but at the same time, it contributes a lot to the character of the beer to make it an equally tasty and unique take on the old ale. Would definitely love to try Adam from the Wood now which has to be great, but not going to worry too much about getting my hands on it when I can more easily drink the base Adam."

""

"Great take on Adam - seems to be drinking perfect right now with everything in balance."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this was a pretty big let down. The nose is pretty good, the taste is awesome though the lack of any carbonation hinders the flavours. Was quite excited to try this beer and it was an enormous let down thanks to it being completely flat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall. Despite the great taste I can't stand a flat beer. I think at least 95% of all the flat beers I've drank have been HotD and I'm pretty fucking tired of this shit, especially for what these clowns charge for their beer. So done with this brewery besides what I have in the cellar already."
""
"Overall- Really good to great, pretty much great. While it won't make me wait in lines, I do understand why others do. Worth a try and I will definitely drop by the taproom again to try it again."

"O: Simply delicious. Everything works in perfect harmony and Adam as the base is the perfect vessel for the barrel aging and the cherry sweetness."
""
"O - Absolutely fantastic"
""

"Overall: A phenomenal brew. A pleasure to savor and wish i had a few more of these!"

"overall: I have had many many HOD beers, and they are almost always fantastic. This beer completely blew me away. for some reason I was not expecting it to be this good and just wanted to try one of the many "" wood"" beers they had available. very happy this was the one we chose. the cherries and barrel aging come though perfectly and are so well balanced. I could have drank this beer all afternoon if it wouldnt put me on the pavement. luckily I work 5 minutes from the place and I plan to visit again this week."
"Verdict: A very nice take on Adam, a really solid Old Ale as it is, but one that might have a little too much going on. It has lots of components from the base beer, the cherries and the barrels, but none of them really seem to meld together in harmony. I enjoyed sipping this over the course of nearly an hour, and would do so again, but I'm not convinced this is a better version than the base beer."
""
"Fuller body, milder carbonation, creamy, velvety and soft on the tongue. I've been waiting about 3 years to try this and it completely lived up to (or blew away) my expectations. One of the best beers I've encountered to date."

"Thanks to Tim for opening this for us. The '12 vintage had a much more smokey character than the '11, a little abrasive up front with less sweetness overall, even with the same, big cherry flavors. The booze was also a bit heavier in the '12 and had a solid whiskey-like presence. Overall, I think I liked the '11 better. Smoother and more easily drinking. These could honestly have been two different beers, but they were still both very tasty."

"M: Full bodied. But the carbonation that's there help clear the palate. Very drinkable."
"OVERALL: This was my least favorite of the night. I found the cherry a little too dominant in the 2012 bottle, which somewhat overwhelmed my palate. I actually preferred the more balanced and bourbon barrel forward 2011 version, though I'm not sure if that was a batch difference, a result of aging, or a combination of both. However, the relatively flat feel of the 2011 kind of ruined that one for me as well. In the end, I was happy to try these, especially side-by-side, but it's not one I'd go after again. Much preferred the regular Adam and Adam from the Wood. Cheers again for all the stuff Claaark13. This was a piss load of fun!"
""
"O- interesting beer, one I was glad too try."
""
""
"Thanks Greg, you're the man!"
"Cost: $12 for a 12 oz bottle."
""
""
""
"M - Medium body with a huge chew. Light carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Takes Adam to another level. Each flavor compliments the others and make this a must have."
"O-The combination of cherries and bourbon was cool, liked it but didn't blow me away."

"Much better than the last bottle I had (zero carbonation). Will hold on to my 2nd one for a year or so."

"Poured dark brown in color with a brown ring sitting on top with a very thin head and left very small bubbles of lacing sticking to the glass. Plenty of sweetness consisting of molasses, toffee hints of caramel a little booze underlying cherries and signs of vanilla. The cherries were more prominent on the palate with great molasses toffee sweetness, a little caramel, some dark fruit and a little booze. The brew was medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, boozy and semi chewy finish. Great beer glad I finally tried it."

"This is just crazy good, delicious, and so much fun to drink. Thanks to trystero for a great trade."
"Overall an undeniably delicious, complex beer. I wish I had a case of this stuff."
""
""
""
"This was a great beer even with quite the low carbonation level, but the 2012 vintage definitely has seemed to fix that. I look forward to seeing what some time does to the 2012's I have left, but this is a fantastic beer no matter the version you get."
"O: This is a very rich and complex beer. The cherries are quite subtle and are integrated well with the base beer, which I wasn't expecting. It certainly beats the crap out of some of the big name barrel-aged barleywines/old ales out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think that I like this better than Adam from the Wood. I love it when brewers can take a beer thats already world class(Adam) and make it something special by putting it into barrels! HotD is no doubt a genius when it come to making really unique beers! I love how you still know you are drinking Adam, but with bourbon and cherries. Its nothing but stright up flawless execution by HotD on brewing & barrel aging this beer."
""
"Overall: Would've liked some more complexity on the nose. However. the taste is awesome and highlights the bourbon and the cherry flawlessly."
""
""
"O: Fantastic. Would be great to reapproach this beer with a little age on it or alongside Aftw. The alcohol is nice and warming but doesn't rear its head and drinks surprisingly smooth for a 10% beer."
""
""
""
"O: Well this is a pleasant surprise. More like Adam from the Wood with cherry than Cherry Adam, and as such, the best of the 4 vintages."
""
""
""
""
"Cherry Adam is an excellent beer that I'd happily drink 5 oz of at any point. I'll never turn this one down."
"D - Very drinkable. The barrel aging and the cherries really add some great complexity and depth to the beer."
""
""
""
"D: I have a hard time seeing how this beer can get any better. It's ready to drink now, and it's an outstanding experience. I had no trouble finishing a full 12oz bottle, and the price is a steal (to me). This might be my favorite beer."
""
"Overall – Oh how I wish this had at least just a *hint* of carbonation. That would make this beer almost perfect for me. A nice alcohol warmth, flawlessly integrated flavors (I can’t get over the cherry, vanilla, and oak flavors – they are so REAL and balanced together), and a nice thick mouthfeel. This is a perfect beer tonight on this 60’s almost fall night on the porch. Extremely impressed."
""
"Overall I am very glad I finally got to try this one but I dont think I would be actively seeking this out when I can just run to the store and get regular adam."
""
""
"Overall: I'm sorely disappointed here. I was really expecting quite a bit more, instead, it's muddled, lacking, and rather non-cohesive."
"Smells like black cherry and old barrels in perfect harmony, complex and good. Delicious, good intensity, full bodied, big malt and fruit, almost syrupy but not overly sweet, well balanced by dark caramel and some fruit juice type tartness. Complex, earthy and savory. Long finish. Nice!"
""
"Good flavors, but complete lack of carbonation dooms this one. I like my old ales and stouts on the lowly carbonated side, but this is just ridiculous. It ruins a potentially great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - One of my least favorite limited releases from HotD. I love Adam from the Wood so I figured the addition of the cherries would make this beer even more fantastic. However, that is not the case. I feel the cherries really didn't bring a whole lot too the table. Three lack of carbonation doesn't help but I should be used to it with HotD beers by now. Also, this was in someone else's possession between 2009-2011. So I'm not exactly sure how it was stored prior to my possession."
"A unique and awesome example of American creativity in brewing. One of my absolute favorite beers."
"O Really interesting beer. Lots going on in the nose and taste that makes it one of a kind. The cherries are just enough to add an awesome layer of complexity. Thank you Alan!"
"3, 4, 4, 4, 4.5"
"Very nice, though I significantly preferred Adam from the Wood."
""
"D - It's very unique, the carbonation is really too low here and makes it drink more like a red wine blend. The closest thing I can think of is Arctic Devil, but with the stronger cherry note here I think this stands out a bit. As my good friend Dan says, ""you gotta pop that cherry hard."""
""
"Overall a very nice brew, the most like a dark red wine I've had to date."
"O- Just not my thing, wouldn't drink again. I'm sure its fine if you are into cherries, but I don't care for it."
"O: Really delicious, but unfortunately another HotD beer that could be elevated to phenomenal with just a little carbonation."
""
"Overall: I thought this beer was good, but I enjoyed the base beer and the regular wood version more. I would have another though."
""
""
"So this beer says a great deal about the hype and screaming on BA. This is no more flat than a couple of the big Lost Abbey beers, but nobody mentions this as an issue. Frankly for some of their beers and this one I don’t mind at all. This is a great beer and one to savor. Thanks MadHombrewer."
"O - Great beer. Fantastic tasting sipper. The flavors on this are so good. Almost....almost too good."
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
"Said shortly, it was devoured. Overall an awesome beer. Cherry Adam from the Wood: you have redeemed my faith in Hair of the Dog!"
""
""
""
""
"O - Glad I got a chance to try this one. I had pretty high expectations that may have been let down a bit although this is a very good beer. The cherries seem to keep this beer from being overly sweet and cloying. Could use a bit more carbonation as this is borderline flat."
"Cheers!"
"O- This beer is extremely complex and really well balanced. The cherry presence works very well with the base beer. No carbonation, but still a truly unique beer."
"Drinkability: Why were there only 12 oz. of this? I've heard there are problems with the 2011 batch that the 2009 batch didn't experience, and I'm grateful that I was able to experience this one as it was intended. The 10% is felt but not sensed (also perhaps the result of an empty stomach), which definitely contributes to the drinkability of this one. I'd certainly like to try this one alongside regular Adam from the Wood (though I understand it that that one spends significantly more time barrel-side) to see what influence the cherries have on this one, though I'm happy to read in to their influence wherever I can here."
"Pours a dark burgundy. Absolutely no head, no lacong.... No carbonation either. I can literally count the number of bubbles in the glass. I believe the 2011 batch must be flat. Has strong cherry and oak notes on the nose. Only a very tiny amount of carbonation on the mouth. Beyond sweet. Strong cherry flavor is present. Oaky after taste and a malty finish. I don't know what to expect to age the 2011 but I'm sure it will need more time for this to settle. Nonetheless, this is a nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This bottle of the '11 batch traveled home with me from Portland (along with some of its friends). After chilling for about 30 minutes, I poured this into a Kasteel chalice. Thick, dark brown / bloody maroon, with no head to speak of, just a few stray bubbles around the rim. I would liked to have seen a little head on this, but considering the ABV and the contents, I guess it's just not possible. Aroma heavy with black cherries, raisins, chocolate, booze, bourbon-soaked oak. Taste was equally as big, with a strong boozy sensation right up front, followed by a massive infusing of cherries covered in dark chocolate. Enter mid-palate: raisins and dried fruits, grape skins and sherry, following by a drowning bourbon sensation complimented by the barrel oak. I was surprised at the longevity of the dark chocolate taste. Smooth and heavy mouthfeel, full-bodied; booze is tasted and felt. Well-crafted and delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is a little syrupy and heavy with carbonation being almost non-existent. Overall it was a very good beer. The cherries and barrel aging really added some nice depth and complexity to it that I really liked. It did feel a little overly sweet and syrupy though at times which prevented it from being a really world class beer to me. A little more balance and just a little carbonation would have gone a long way."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark plum purple. No head no lace. Looks like we got a flat one here folks. Super rich bourbon soaked black cherries. Wet barrel wood and hint of playdough. Flavors are bit more subdued. Modest bourbon, cherry, wood and a touch of playdough in the finish. Flat lifeless body. This could have been world class if not for the carn issue."
""
""
"Overall quite good, but lack of carbonation is a bit iffy. It drinks very well for being 10%, smooth. Lots of great malt flavors, nice fruits, dark everything, a bit too sweet IMO but I won't hold that against it since that's what it was going for and I don't usually have anything sweet. The syrupy feel is Ok but maybe just a bit too much as well, but then again it's no Dark Lord. if this had even a little bit of carbonation it would be out of this world."
""
""
""
""
""
"Big thanks goes out to sincereNC for sharing this one with me! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured reddish brown with basically no head present. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, cherry, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, massive cherry, subtle wood, and a hint of sherry. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Based on the pour of this one I was quite worried that I wouldn't like it too much. However, the aroma and flavor really pulled through on this one. Despite it tasting pretty much flat, it was still quite drinkable and tasty. Really glad I got the opportunity to try this one and hopefully I will get to do so again in the future."

"Overall: I do not have much experience with HotD beers but I do love Adam and this one destroys the base beer. The beer is overall solid and was one of my favorites of the night"
"Medium bodied but on the fuller end with a very boost flavor that dominates, slightly overpowering the other flavors. Tons of oak and peaty bourbon folowed by the dark fruit notes. Hints of dark cherry, fig, raisin and currant give sweetness that counters toasted notes from the wood. That being said there is a crazy amount of harsh boozy heat that makes it tough to put down."
"This is a full bodied brew with a very light level of carbonation. When the bottle was first popped I was a bit let down to not see any head formation. However after sipping the brew, I think it is nearly perfect and doesn't need any more carbonation. The thickness of this brew coats the mouth and lasts with a wonderful aftertaste. The 10% abv is felt in the flavor but not carry with it the expected burning quality due to the wonderful mellowing that took place during the barrel aging. This brew was a seriously enjoyable offering and it is still relatively young. I need to get more of this!"
"o - wow. this is a treat and the perfect cherry to top the sunday of tasting beers that this evening was. this is a dessert beer and one I wish was readily available to me."
"Overall this is an excellent beer. I understand its rarity and appreciate the generosity in its sharing. I love the cherry flavor. No candy here... real deal dark cherries."
"Overall - I miss Adam. Where is he amongst all this cherry bourbonity? I remember the carbonation on Adam being too much, but this is the antithesis. Somewhere in between the base beer and this would be one hell of a creation."
"O - Could have been a great beer, but no bubbles completely ruins it for me."
"Medium to full mouthfeel and low carbonation. Glad I got to try this one."
"Overall: It was a very good beer, but honestly, I'm not sure I could even drink an entire bottle of it. Luckily there are people to share with."
"Pours an opaque crimson black with absolutely no head. No lacing on this one. Smell is of toasted coconut, raisins, prunes, vanilla, wood, chocolate, and some leather aromas. Lots of very nice smells coming off this one. Taste is of toasted coconut, vanilla, wood, dark fruits, cocoa powder, and dark cherries in liqueur. Very rich and complex flavors on this one. Unfortunately, this beer has no carbonation and is very thick and sticky in the mouth. Overall, this is a good beer that suffers from the lack of carbonation in my opinion. I am very happy that I got to try this one."
"I really like this beer. There are similarities to port but the combination of barrel, malt and fruit is very enticing and complex and a testament to Alan's excellent ability with these sorts of beers."
"Lovely, lovely stuff. The single bottle of '11 in my cellar (you can buy '08, '09 and '11 at the tasting room, but only for consumption on the premises) will sit for at least another year before I crack it. It's delicious and appealing young, but it's clear to me that this is a beer that will reward patience."
"Are you kidding me? This beer is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of lifting to my lips. Nothing short of amazing. Hope I get another go at this one someday."
"Overall - the lack of carbonation killed this and by far the best old ale/barleywine with a touch of sour is the decadence recently released."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark brown with very little head except along the rim. Smells nicely subtle and balanced with aromas of cherries, vanilla and wood from the oak, some clean sweetness, a refreshing tartness, and some cheery liqueur at the end. The taste is almost a perfect balance between rich, lush, sweet cherries, and clean, somewhat tannic wooden backbone with nice malt notes binding them together and reminding you that this is beer. Delicious. Truly a triumph of flavor, just a tad harsh in the mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this."
"The beer is medium in body and really sweet. The finish is a little dry where I can pick up mild tannins from the cherry wood I suppose. Overall it is a nice beer, I wish I had a regular Adam to drink next to it but alas. I remember really liking Adam and only sort of liking Cherry Adam, I would definitely have it again, but only as a side by side."
"Pours dark brownish red, with just a tiny suggestion of a ring of head. The nose is fantastic. Cherry and plum dominate, with other dark fruits like raisins and just a touch of leather. Wow, the taste is also great. Cherries and plums melded into an old ale (dark fruit, raisin, fig, leather) perfectly. The cherry flavor isn't subtle, but the whole beer is so smooth and well blended - it is stunning. Not boozy at all. Really brings this around and counteracts the overt earthiness of Adam, adding a bit of sweetness and brightness. Unfortunately, it is basically flat, with a heavy mouthfeel. It comes off like a cordial. A bit too sticky for me. Overall, this beer would be unbelievable with good carbonation. As is, it is quite enjoyable."
"Bottle says beer, but the pour looks like wine. Purple wine in fact. No head to be found. I delicately move it around in my glass. Smell is slight booze. Some oak. Sweet grape kool-aid. Tastes like grape juice with a hint of alcohol. Zero carbonation. I was a tad worried there may be an alcohol burn, but it was non existent. Quite a well done beer. Very tasty."
"Overall: Unfortunately, this is another Hair of the Dog beer that has no carbonation and would be amazing otherwise."
"Mouthfeel is dissapointing. Completely flat. If properly carbonated this beer would be exceptional. Instead it is ""merely"" excellent."
"One of those beers that's a treat just to smell, a whirlwind of chocolate covered cherries, bourbon, oak and the smoky, leathery goodness of regular Adam. I'm somewhat surprised that the cherry and bourbon flavors are so potent; they don't quite overpower the base beer, but then again, Adam in all its leathery, smoky glory is about as big and badass a base beer as you'll find. I've only had 2 vintages of Cherry Adam, but prefer the smoother integration the 2008. However, the 2009 is tasty stuff, with a luxuriously smooth and lingering finish. Highly recommended."
"Well, despite it's obvious differences to regular Adam, this is in the same good-to-very-good category. Would like to try this again fresher, I wonder how the cherry & barrels would play without any age on it."
"Great flavor. The lack of carbonation doesn’t destroy the experience, but come on, Alan — give me a little."
"D/O: Certainly appealing, this bourbon-infused strong ale becomes almost indistinguishable from select barleywines that have received the treatment. Its sweetness sets the tone for all that follows, providing the best and most decadent possible canvas for the fruit and the spirit. Sip slowly and savor without distractions."
"O: a great beer. i didn't want this beer to end."
"Overall impression: so tasty and such a great sipper. Exceptionally done. I'm beyond tickled to have happened across this on the one night I was in Portland."
"Took the leap of faith and ordered a $28 bottle of this as my dessert beer on my 25th birthday last year. I was just hopin that it was going to be good, I'm assuming the bottle I had was from 2009. It poured out as a dark red color, the head... Was never there. No lacing at all. The smell of the beer was very wine-like. Strong barrel aromas, blended with cherries, and booze. The taste was a little tart but had a complex flavor to it from the cherry to the wood and then some nut flavors in the far background. The mouthfeel was a little watery I thought. A little too much like a red wine. The overall thoughts I had on this beer was that I didn't think it was worth the amount I paid. Sadly I think there are much nicer beers out there other than this for much less. However I am glad that I got to try it. I don't see myself ordering this brew again."
"Overall a very interesting take with some really strong features; I would prefer a touch of carbonation but I enjoyed it very much nonetheless."
"Notes - This is an incredibly complex beer and I will enjoy this for the remainder of my night. The mouthfeel isnt particularly strong if thats something that is crucial for you, but honestly it is so powerfully complex it is easily one of the best I have ever had. Just incredible."
"Overall: This beer has all kinds of things going on from the aroma through the taste. Knowing what this has been through in it's aging doesn't bother me with the very low carbonation level. Adam is one of my favorite beers and this is a really nice version of it. Highly recommended."
"Just a top notch beer. Really amazing. The flavors all compliment each other perfectly. Nothing overwhelms, only adds to the flavor. Hard to get, but worth the trip to the tasting room."
"Overall, this was amazing. Glad to have at such a great bar."
"Overall- Great beer, would love more carbonation."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer and I'm glad I traded for it, but I'm not sure it's something I would drink regularly. Definitely more like drinking port than beer."
"This is quite good, but I can't help but feel like I would've gotten as much enjoyment out of three bottles of regular Adam from 2009..."
"6.3/10"
"D - No carbonation. A touch sweet, but I still love it."
"Great overall beer very delicious"
"O- Frankly I don't think I would like this carbonated. So that's one thing out of the way, but right now this beer is way way too overpowered with cherries. Hopefully that will start to diminish. For the positive though, this thing warms your soul just a bit as it goes down. A scotch glass was definitely appropriate. This is a wonderful desert beer, and definitely one that demands your attention. I hope this review did it justice."
"Overall, it was a slight disappointment, but that disappointment is tempered by the experience of drinking a 2009 the night before. I have one more bottle of this, and I'm going to try to forget about it for at least a year in the hope that it might somehow acquire at least a modicum of carbonation."
"The flavors are very interesting, the cherry does come through rather prominantly and has a large amount of sweetness behind it, and i think this is why the alcohol is hidden rather well, it is detectable only in some flavors and not so much in heat. The barrels come through with some oak too much not substantially so. There are alot of comparisons to a wine i could make with this actually, but i am not Tomme. Pretty Viscous and near syrupy, having that carbination would cut it down a bit. Basically, how much carbination matters will determine your enjoyment. Think of Brandy Angles Share and decide."
"The is really enjoyable as dessert with a lot of complexity."
"Really a thick robust body on this here. Full and sticky with very low soft carbonation. I'd like a little more from the carbonation, but this is still amazing. Overall an incredibly unique beer. Probably the most enjoyable beer with a dominant sweet prescence. A little boozey, but it's not the most aggressive that I've had. I could see how this could be too sweet after a while, so split your bottles with a friend gang."
"O- A very unique and tasty beer. I've been waiting to try this for a while, and it totally my style of beer. If this had a little carbonation and head, it could be near perfect."
"Overall a fine offering that shows HotD really knows how to nail complex and adventurous beers."
"O: Good"
"Both vintages are tasting very good and are enjoyable as sippable beers. Some may like the '08 version better, which tastes as one would expect an aged beer to taste--somewhat drier than the fresh--but I prefer the fresher taste of the '11 version because I especially like the fresh cherry taste along with the sugar."
"But as it is now, it's a disappointment. Even more so when I think what it could be."
"Overall, glad I finally got to sample this beer, and it pretty much lived up to it's billing. Will definately be seeking out more bottles and age will only improve this one."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is medium bodied and for all intents and purposes completely flat. It's very slick in the mouth. However, it doesn't really affect the overall quality of the beer much in my opinion. This beer is outstanding in terms of flavor profile, and a superb take on an ole ale."
"O: As far as sipping beers go, this is near the top. So many complex flavors that blend together magically. This is the perfect desert beer, every little sip is packed with so much flavor. I could spend all day drinking this and discover something new with every sip. A truly masterfully crafted beer. Very unique with no other beer tasting remotely like this. Amazing job here Alan, keep up the great work!"
"The beer is a dark ruby hue with minimal head and fair lacing. The aroma is fantastic, with scents of cherries, booze, tobacco, brown sugar. Fabulous. The taste is quite wonderful as well. Sweet, but not overly so. Alcohol content is impressively well hidden. Delicious. Would be easy to drink in large quantities. Terrific beer. Highly recommended."
"O - Really disappointed in this year's version. The lack of carbonation really took away from the overall enjoyment of this one. Hoping the 2009's I have don't go this route (I don't think they will)."
"O - A touch hot right now with the very prominent sherry/bourbon flavours but a wonderful sipper. This beast is going to only become only better with a couple years of aging on it, which I would recommend."
"O: A great experience but I believe this will get a LOT better when it has 2 years on it."
"The lack of carbonation didn't really bother me on this one."
"Drink- I want an IV of it. It was boozy, creamy and sweet and and and and...so many adjectives."
"2009 bottle. Pours nearly black with almost no head, or at least none that lasts more than a fleeting few seconds. The beer is a very pretty color though, in a snifter a reddish brown color shows through but all together it's a pretty dark beer. The aroma is cherry and tobacco with some port, some light roastiness, and some pleasant bourbon-y booze. The flavor is moderately sweet with a nice subtle smoke noticeable throughout along with a nice bit of wood and fruity cherry. There is some maple syrup flavor and a nice warming booziness. A very different, well put together, all together unique and decadent beer."
"Overall, a really tasty beer, and it smells heavenly, but this is the second HotD bottle in a row that has been completely flat, the other being Matt. Perhaps they use terrible bottle caps that don't hold up well when being shipped, I dunno, but I have to imagine that the brewer doesn't want their beer to be completely absent of carbonation like this is. Perhaps it needs more time in the bottle to condition and get some bubbles? Whatever the case, this would be a winner if it were carbed properly, but right now it's just an interesting, cherry-infused beer syrup. I'll let my other bottle relax in the basement closet for about 6 months and see what happens, but I don't have high hopes."
"Similar flavors, rich dark chocolate, tobacco, leather, cherry tartness. Supple and mellow feel, chewy with plenty of fortitude. Bourbon heat is minimal, though traces of the bourbon barrel do shine through in the taste. Cherries lend a tanginess in the background, while the oak tannins contribute a dry bitterness that linger in the finish. A slow sipper, a fine after dinner nightcap to share with friends."
"D: This is one to sip, given its complexity and alcohol content, although it's well hidden. Well balanced and very enjoyable."
"2009 vintage. Pours a deep, impenetrable dark brown (nearly black) color, with no more than a smattering of bubbles on top. Aromas of wet leather, dried cherries, oak and musty bourbon. On the palate, low carbonation and a relatively thick body, with flavors of bourbon, black cherries, sherry and raisins. Warming and alcoholic, this is a great beer."
"This is an amazing beer, very complex and incredibly smooth, especially for being so fresh. The ABV is incredibly well hidden."
"D: Excellent. Smooth and rich. The bourbon is a little overpowering right now, but this should evolve into a wonderful beer over the next one to five years."
"D: A beer I look forward to drinking every time I have one in my glass. Turn off the TV, block out distractions, and give yourself time to purely enjoy a great brewing achievement. This is without a doubt one of those beers every beer geek should try before they die. In the world of ""extreme beer"" Cherry Adam defies the convential definition of what a beer should be. I've had the '08, '09, and now the '11. In my opinion, this is the best one yet. Next week when the bottles go on sale the $10 a bottle ($8.33 per if you buy a case) price tag will be the best deal in town. I plan to buy a case and see just how long I can keep from drinking the very last bottle. Its a daunting task but we all have our crosses to bear I suppose. 5/5"
"Drinkability:This is a very tasty beer. Still lots of cherry flavor present."
"very good beer. very happy to have finally tried it. love what the cherries did to this guy. very eager to try it fresh! im definitely going to seek out some fresh ones if another batch comes out!"
"WOw, to quote my good friend, ""I was just floored by this."" One of the best barrel aged beer sI have ever had. Pours a rich mahogany with a thin tan head. Exceptional color. Notes of bourbon, oak, vanilla, cherries, plums, sherry, port, caramel and pecans. Such depth and complexity. Full, creamy body, great finish."
"DB- I can smell and taste the Adam behind a nice Bourbon and cherry flavor set. The carbonation missing is a setback but I still like this as a dessert beer."
"This was disappointing... It's tasty, but I was hoping for a nice leather/smoke profile like the regular Adam, this didn't have too much going on."
"p.s. Remember Don Younger!"
"Low carbonation, but still a little bubbly, not flat. Very very strong feeling, definitely a sipper. I found this to be my favorite FOTD beer to date, and best placed as an after-dinner or nightcap beer."
"Final Thought: I don't know if i just got a bad bottle or what, but right now this beer was a HUGE disappointment. Was pretty excited to taste until i took the first sip and it was all down hill from there. I started drinking the beer a little to cold, but while i drank it slowly and let it warm up to around 50-55 F, i found myself giving it lower and lower scores. Man, and adam was just so good! Probably will have to revisit this with another bottle just to make sure i didn't get a bad egg. But as it stands, this sucked."
"Overall: You must seek this out. It's amazing and I'm glad I live only 2.5 hours away!"
"Bottle. 2009 vintage. Poured into a tall Allagash tulip a very dark brown color with the slightest red tinges. Very minimal head, even with a vigorous pour, with a tannish collared head. HUGE aroma of bourbon in the nose, along with dark chocolate of the bes kind. At 13.5% the booze does show in the nose slightly but not blatantly or displeasing. Served at cellar temp which is probably about 55-60 degrees. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Very bold and smooth flavors the like I am extremely enjoying. Dark chocolate, bourbon, and dark fruit round out the flavor profile beautifully. Slight warming at the end. The smoothness is really nice. I wish it was a tad bit more carbonated though."
"Overall a great beer. This is a complex, well balanced and smooth beer. Worth trying if you ever get the chance."
"Bottle. Pours deep brown with a wispy head. Nose is hugely malty with heavy bourbon and oak. Not as smokey as a lot of other of their oak-aged beers. Hot, sweet, and a bit tart in the mouth. Somewhat medicinal sweetness bordering on cherry. Big and robust malt. More smoke or spice would be nice to play against the sweetness. Not cloying though, pretty enjoyable. As it opens, the bourbon and oak kind of meld together very nicely. That said, I think I would just prefer the regular Adam here."
"drinkability - sipping grade awesomeness"
"D - This sure is a sipper, but it is so flavorful and delicious. I could easily drink a few pints of this if it was available. World class."
"4.5/4.25/4"
"Good, but not great, an example of a beer I'd hoped would be better than its inspiration, but doesn't quite deliver. I'm thankful for the effort, but I'll take the non barrel aged version."
"D: I paid a Jackson for this baby, was it worth it, from the beer probably not, but Beachwood was my only opportunity, and it was my birthday so I'd been eyeing this for a while. Good beer without a doubt, put 2-5 years on it; it will be amazing."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I do like this beer, especially the nose, but when you stack it up against the regular Adam it falls a bit short. The cherry addition adds to the nose, but doesn't do much for me in terms of flavor. Also seems like the barrel aging may have thinned this one out a bit. However, I'd still like to try the 2009 version at some point and this beer still worth trying, especially if you like old ales / English barleywines."
"Overall it's quite nice. I can see how this one is meant to be put down or enjoyed over the course of an evening with some cheese."
"Hair of the Dog only continues to impress. I admit I'm a sucker for a well made, sweeter, little-bit-boozy beer, but Sprints continues to knock them out of the park for me. Really an excellent treat."
"Overall, a great beer. A slow sipper for sure, but incredibly quaffable. I wish I had more of this."
"This one was pretty disappointing. Maybe I'm missing something, but I found this to be too sweet, too syrupy, and a bit too harsh. I don't taste cherries, and the flavors don't really work for me."
"- I was caught off guard with this 12 oz. bottle. It poured like a very weak beer. I thought it was going to be another under carbonated 09' Doggy Claws that I got... and it was under carbonated... but the flavors held true. I would love to rate this higher... but it needs more carbonation and conditioning. If that happened... this could possibly be one of the best ales on earth. I love Adam, and it's my favored HOTD brew."
"Also a little bit of cocoa notes aided with masking the bitter bourbon-esq alcohol flavors. As it warmed the flavors had become a little more like red wine. An incredible beer."
"D-this is very tasty brew, nice blend of tart cherry with a good wood presence, great malt body to compliment the sweetness with an interesting almost tannic wine like quality."
"I wish I had a case or two in the basement. Too bad it is so damn expensive."
"D--Wow, this is a terrific brew, definitely in my top ten easily. I love this beer and wish I had more, seek it out and enjoy it!"
"D - vastly superior to the regular Adam, although I am an unabashed port lover. It's a bit viscous and strong, but I'd drink it all night, without reservation. The best of the night and easily an all-time favorite."
"Drinkable may not be the correct term...sippable for sure though. Easy to enjoy this one...loads of levels and flavors...wow!"
"EDIT- On tap last week 2/2012 at the Tap Room. The chocolate/cheery interplay is one of the most unique taste profiles in all of Beerdom. An absolute treat. This 2009 version is rockin!"
"D: A deep and rich beer that reveals an almost infinite amount of layers of flavor as I drink it, Cherry Adam is the real deal and its a beer that others in its style should strive towards. High ABV is a bit frightening at first but its not boozy at all and is in fact, super easy to get down all things considered. Seek it out!"
"Drinkability? So strong on the bourbon and malty sweetness, it's STILL relatively easy to drink. I'm impressed. This is certainly a goody from HOTD!"
"D - Hype was bigger than what I experienced."
"Drinkability: Drinkable and better after it warms; however I never got any cherry and prefer the brewer's other old ales"
"d - This is a great beer that I enjoyed a lot. I really enjoyed the mixture of cherry, wood, and vanilla in both the smell and taste, and would love to get a bottle of this."
"Dark brown with dark cherry highlights and a pink tinted cream colored head that leaves scraps of lace on the glass. Dark cherries and toasted oak with a touch of buttery aroma probably due to malolactic fermentation. Rich, woody and full of complexity with black cherry and toasty oak. Full bodied and silky with very mild carbonation. Long oaky finish. This beer is truly excellent. This beer lives up to it's ""whale"" status."
"D: Very high. I've got some of this reserved at a store I frequent and after sampling this at DLD, I am very excited to go and pick my bottles up."
"D - Very good. I could drink more of it."
"D - A very nice and quite complex brew, one to sip and savor. Not as good as regular Adam. Reminds me as much or more of Fred from the Wood as Adam, anyway."
"Overall, a lovely beer and I'm really glad I just recently happened upon two more due to the outstanding Matt of Capone's. Can't wait to try some with age on them"
"Overall, thus beer is great. Very drinkable and probably the best old ale I have ever had. Well rounded with lots of flavor. Bourbon barrels + black cherries = heaven."
"While I can polish off a bottle or more of Adam with ease, I think splitting this version was a good deal, this was pretty sweet, but not cloying in anyway. Maybe I'll try to do a bottle one day. I really cant say which one I like more, this or the regular, but I know this is damn good stuff. Side by side is in the works."
"D- its really drinkable in 6oz pours but no way would I want to tackle a whole 12 I mean I'd like to try but I wouldn't need it all. Lovely flavor complexity some of the most complex stuff I've ever had in fact. Baller shit from some serious heads."
"D - Pretty easy to drink, never would have guessed this is 10% alcohol, quite sweet, probably a bit too much to session, but could do another."
"Overall, this was ok. Its very similar to the utopias to me. Its very drinkable for a 10% beer, its almost like a after dinner drink. However, its a little too sweet for me, and there is way to much alcohol taste and feel on your mouth."
"Excellent beer, get this mofo if yo cando."
"Interesting flavor. I would have to personally dissagree with the Old Ale label, it more likely resembles an American style of Quadrupel. Huge raisin flavor...followed by a cabernet like aftertaste. Has low carbonation...with a solid oak, barrel aged like earthiness. Booze is pretty noticeable. Medium to thick mouthfeel/body. Overall, its a little too sweet for me, but no where near as bad as some of the quads/old ales out there where theres severe raisin overkill. Just another solid beer from Hair of the Dog."
"D: It wasn't quite worth the money that we paid for it, but still a fantastic beer. I'd love to try this again."
"2008 bottle - Pours like a purple/dark maroon color very unique. Very small head on it, but still carbonated some what and a bit on sides of glass, but should be expected especially aging over a year in the casks (bourbon/sherry). Big barleywine with fruit (cherry) and a bit of smokiness on the nose. Taste - WOW, very smooth with a bit of smokey character (expected from smell) and a nice cherry tartness (kind of like a chocolate covered cherry) with a smokey/wood addition. A full yet ""gentle"" bodied brew with some carbonation and very delicious. This is a must have and I cannot wait to get more!"
"Bottle vintage 2008. Pours black cherry in color, nearly black. No head to speak of other than a few clusters of bubbles. After 15 months in bourbon and sherry casks though, I am feeling forgiving on the head. A swirl does conjure up some foam and stick some clusters of head along the walls of the glass. The aroma is robust with bourbon, black treacle, brown sugar, tart cherry, oak, sherry, and smoke--no lack of complexity here. The flavor begins with a smokey malt character lightened by tart cherries. Somewhat peppery with a dry bready finish that ends with lingering dark chocolate. Quite a brew. Full bodied with a subdued but present carbonation that is just about right. This beer is quite delicious, more robust than expected and probably better too. Something elegant to be savored."
"Thanks Gary!"
"Smells like.... well the cherries are there, surprise surprise. Some ripe apples too. Just a general dark fruitiness, really. Booze, chocolate and some syrupy sweetness. Taste is the same, with some charred malt and sweet flavors but a bit of a woodiness to it. Fruitiness is apparent throughout along with good complexity. Booze is there in the finish and somewhat lingers without any carbonation to carry it away. Though, this beer is properly carbonated for what it's trying to be. The low carbonation and combination of flavors and booze presence almost create a liqueur quality to the mouthfeel and experience of this beer. The flavors work very well together and I would like to revisit this down the road. I had drank this once before this review and remembered liking it more, so it's possible that my outlook will change again in the future. Thanks Greg!"
"There was only a prickle of carbonation on the mouthfeel to go with a slightly syrupy consistency. It actually tasted hotter than 10%, and it was certainly intended to be shared. This was a beer I wanted to try, but I found it hard to finish towards the end."
"D: I enjoyed one bottle in two sittings and would have had trouble doing it another way."
"D- Its a big heavy beer, but it has so much flavor I couldn't stop drinking it. If I had another bottle I don't think i could let it sit very long and probably would opened it by now. What an amazing beer. I am usually not a fan of old ales, but this is one of the best."
"Drinks pretty easy with nicely hidden abv, another winner form HOTD! One that will probably be better with at least another year+ on it IMO"
"An interesting and masterful creation. Dark colour with virtually no head. Cherry, bourbon and yeast in aroma. Above average mouthfeel, bulked up by caramel. Rich vanilla wood and cherry flavours dominate, the bourbon not far behind. Cannot discern carbonation."
"4.5 Drikability: Super tasty when it warms and goes down easy."
"One of the best-tasting brews I've had in 2009."
"D: Pretty big beer that is very inviting."
"The beer is almost syrupy, with just enough carbonation to make it not-too-thick. The complex flavors roll over each other and the alcohol flavors seem to burst out of the bourbon notes, rather than an alcohol burn. After a few sips I feel the alcohol warm my stomach pleasantly, reminding me that this is a sipper, but the flavors mask the high abv nicely. I am really impressed by this beer and will seek it out in the future."
"No carbonation really hurts the mouthfeel but otherwise this beer is a warming top notch behemoth."
"Overall: Awesome beer. Really really great. Highly recommended."
"A huge thanks to jedwards for breaking this one out. Batch #1 served in my Allagsh tulip. Poured the color of cola with ruby-red highlights around the edges. Head was a light skim of foam that quickly dispersed into nothingness. Incredible nose - lots of bourbon and vanilla. Taste follows nose - bourbon with some tart cherries coming out in the mix. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, a little oily with a carbonation level that was pretty darn close to still and a mild tartness that stimulates the salivary glands. Incredibly flavorful with a well-hidden abv. My first beer from Hair of the Dog has left me wanting more."
"Thank to BA KPlynch for this gem!"
"Drinkability is high in regards to ""desire"" to drink, but I would be lying if I said my stomach wasn't rumbling after 6 oz. Perhaps its because I haven't ate enough today. This bottle is an awesome dessert or nightcap. Awesome beer...on par with both regular Adam and Matt. Seek this one out!"
"Extra from HopHead84. Pretty decent extra, I guess. Dark, nearly opaque brown body with a small tan head that clings strongly to the sides of the glass. The nose is an interesting mix of bourbon, leather and pipe tobacco with a touch of tart cherry. I was expecting a cherry onslaught, but that's not the case; the fruit is just another layer in a very complex beer. The taste is similar, with bourbon up front, lending vanilla, caramel and light tannins. Leather and tobacco follow, with cherries appearing mid-palate, simultaneously sweet and tart, leading into a dry, earthy finish. Incredible complexity on display here, another great beer from Hair of the Dog."
"Drinkability is average. It's a wonderful beer, but also a big challenge to put back. Cheers!"
"Feels dense as hell, yet smooth to sip. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. A really well done beer."
"Note-I am putting alot of faith in the aging process of this beer, because I plan on sitting on a couple of them for a while."
"D - A sipper, but a good one nonetheless. I would search for this and drink again."
"My only gripe is the low level of carbonation, which really does the nose a disservice."
"I would like to see what this beer would taste like served incredibly cold as I feel that may take away a bit of the tartness and possibly give the cherry flavor a bit more of a chance. I would also like to see how this tastes after a couple years in the cellar. I will have to try both."
"I am not quite too sure about the cherry part of this beer, there is a general fruity richness, but certainly not anything I can identify as cherry specific. This could use a bit more texture and heft, a bit more residual malt character in the body would help to smooth out the warm / boozy alcohol and spicy barrel notes. Seems to lack a bit of finesse and the flavors / aromas are not quite as integrates as one might hope. Still this is certainly a tasty beer and I like how the background sherry notes add a lot of richness to this beer. The smoky peat character also adds a lot of background complexity to this beer."
"Smell is very nice. A good amount of cherry is in the nose. Kind of shocked, didn't expect that much. Some hints of oak and bourbon. Taste is phenomenal. I'm a big fan of HotD Adam to begin with, but this takes it to a whole other level. The cherry really works well with the base beer. When this warms up after a bit, the cherry subsides slightly and the oak, vanilla and the bourbon characteristics really come forward and shine. This is like two completely different beers from start to finish. This is a world class beer once it warms up and starts to flourish. Full and creamy on the mouthfeel. This one coats the mouth with heavenly goodness and you never want to see the glass empty. This one not only lived up to but exceeded my expectations. I'm going to have to try to find some more of this beer. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Overall, this beer was huge for me. I try to appreciate all beers, but the one style that I don't really care for are old ales. For me to give the review I did, for an old ale, says something. I never thought a beer from this style could taste as great as this one did. Kudos to Alan Sprints for creating this one."
"drinkability: ok"
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and thick with a small amount of carbonation."
"A very aggressive pour yields a paper thin layer of head that quickly disappears to a few bubbles here and there. Nothing in terms of lacing unfortunately. The beer itself is essentially black as night. Smell has a strong malt character with molasses, leather, and tobacco. Dark ripe cherries, oak, and gooey fudge in the nose as well. Taste begins with tart cherries, rich caramel, and some smokey wood. Midway the fudge flavors emerge with some tobacco leaves and bourbon. Aftertaste is sweet with vanilla beans, leather, and some coffee flavors as well. Full body with a silky smooth feel from the almost non-existant carbonation. The booze is present making this one a sipper for sure. Not bad, but I was expecting a bit more from this highly talked about beer. Thanks again Dan-O you little bitch."
"Drinkability is good, very complex and tasty, a one of a kind, and fun to decipher. But the fact is, it's a very strong, robust, super oaky beer. And since I assume a lot of the boozy bite is from the sherry, I'm not sure how much it will smooth out in the cellar. Plus, it's very expensive, $10/12 oz IIRC. I've got a bunch of them so we'll see how they hold up in the cellar, but honestly I'll probably have to pimp a few as trade fodder."
"Another great beer from HotD and while this doesn't quite stack up to the original Adam for me, the twists definitely make for a unique and tasty brew."
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color ale with some reddish notes and alight foamy head with minimal retention and no lacing. Aroma of bourbon and light cherry with a well rounded malt backbone. Taste is very complex mix of bourbon, cherries, smoke and tar with a heavy dose of sweet malt. Full body with limited filtration and no carbonation and almost no carbonation. Very complex and very satisfying - another great beer coming from a very creative brewer."
"A nice sipper, pretty much turns into cherry scotch near the middle of the glass and stays there. An interesting beer I might try this again sometime."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with mellow carbonation. Perfect body makes for great drinkability. Such a very good beer. Cheers to Hair of the Dog for another beautiful creation and thanks to autumnaldave for sharing this one with me."
"Drinkability- I really enjoyed the brew a lot when cold. The cherry and wood really dominated and the tartness was awesome. As it warmed the tobacco really came out and this reminded me a lot of cherry Skoal. Now I know that doesn't sound a lot like a ringing endorsement but its good, very good. Big thanks to Toby for the generosity!"
"Taste: Strong Cherry and Bourbon right out of the gate balanced by some sweetness. Some Vanilla and Chocolate. Extremely smooth and drinkable for a 10% barrel aged offering."
"This is as complex as one might imagine, given the brewery, the name and the fact this is an adulterated version of an already complex and wonderful old ale. As with most barrel-aged versions, I'd personally rather have the original, but this is still fantastic. ***Thank you very much msubulldog25!***"
"Overall: would love to get one for the cellar"
"flavor is better.. cigar wrapper .. sweet and tobacco.. leathery.. the cherries add a nice dimension.. but are pretty much blown away by oak and catchers mitt... the cherries and oak add a very nice depth.. I think it will get better with quite a bit of age..but still drink one when you can to try it... Alan is a ""homebrewer's"" brewer...not every batch is gonna be stellar... though.. if he did start filtering and counterpressure bottling... wouldn't that take away from some of the allure?? that said.... I've had plenty of carbonation issues with hotd brews .. but overall.. the brew's flavor are damn near always fantastic."
"i am very happy i am cellaring a bottle"
"Overall: A great beer! A must try...let it warm up for a while to help bring out the complexity of the taste...this beer definitely deserves this patience from you. I really want to have this again...hopefully it will come out in bombers. Cheers!"
"Also under-carbonated."
"Poured into a Corsendonk tulip a very nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, which leaves some oil slicks/small islands. The nose is malty, nice notes of bourbon, cherries, vanilla. The taste is sweet, malty, very nice bourbon notes, some tartness from the cherries. Medium/full body, a very drinkable brew at 10% ABV. Thanks Toby."
"Thanks to Sam for a couple bottles of what proves to be another winner from HOTD."
"D: It's aged Adam with a dose of wood and cherry. If you're an Adam fan, this is a must; a warming, rich sipping beer that makes a great dessert on a chilly night. Complex and still boozy, it's great to try now and will be interesting to see how this develops over time. RECOMMENDED!"
"Overall I thought this was excellent, needs a little bit more carbonation, but again I have to say this one comes across excellent. Another winner here and I am very glad I got to try this."
"Despite the one minor flaw, this is an excellent brew."
"drinkability is great. i'm wishing i had several bottles more that i could just keep sipping on. this is well balanced with a great depth from the barrel and the cherries. it's far from obtrusive and truly complimentary. great stuff. must fine more."
"Pours a cloudy and murky dark reddish brown, very muddy, very thin tan head forms, immediately settles down to a thin ring around the glass, but drops some nice lacing when I swirl the glass, good retention. Smell is crazy, like Adam, which is very malty, toffee and molasses, biscuits, cherries, oak, port, vanilla and bourbon, sherry, very fruity, rum raisin character, light bit of smoke, very complex. Taste is crazy too, very oaky, lots of toffee, rum and raisins, sherry, bourbon, vanilla, sourness from the oak, a bit lactice, very fruity, prune juice and cherries, some alcohol, nice smoky finish, lots of fruit, very nice, some brown sugar and molasses. Mouthfeel is full bodied, almost syrupy, with low carbonation. Some warmth from the alcohol, tannic drying mouthfeel, but very smooth. Great beer, super complex, still has the components of Adam but amped up a bit, very nice. Thanks Derek!"
"Thanks to inflatablechair for this one. 12oz. bottle served in a snifter. Bottle conditioned. 2008 vintage. Poured brown with hints of red. Not a lot of carbonation, what head there is quickly dissipates. Great aroma with bourbon, vanilla, oak, fruit, and a hint of alcohol. Full bodied, but the lack of carbonation made it a bit syrupy. Very rich, complex malt profile. More oak and chocolate. Lots of vanilla from the oak. Long woody finish. A bit of tart cherry flavor, but not a lot. The lack of carbonation really diminished the beer to me."
"Major gusher. Quickly diminishing thin foam, brown body. Poor appearance. Nose has some character to it, with a touch of smoke, black cherries and sherry notes. Very thin mouth feel. Notes of black cherry, smoke, and sweet ripe dark fruit. A solid ale, but was expecting a bit more here."
"A good beer that I hope gets better with some more time in the bottle...right now I would take regular Adam over this one though."
"Poured a dark black color, with brown edges, and a smaller sized red tinted, off whtie head. Aromas of dark-black cherries, wood, sherry, and light bourbon. I would say the woodiness dominates the aromas with the black cherries coming in a close second. Tastes of black cherries, sherry, wood, chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. Sweet if a very light tart finish. More sweet and the tartness dissapeared as soon as I detected it. Light to medium alcohol in the finish."
"Pours basically black with no lasting head whatsoever. Just some beige bubbles kicked up from the pour, but not a real head. Smell is smooth and rich bourbon and oak, mainly and is quite nice. Taste is a touch tart and perhaps fruity, but not cherries per se, and of course some bourbon and definite wood character. Tart fruity malt flavor but only a very faint actual cherry flavor, even when looking for it. Some very light alcohol in the flavor and its a touch warming. Beer is flat after 5 minutes in the glass which kills the beer for me, and once again another overpriced and over hyped HOTD beer with a huge bottling flaw... At about 15 dollars for a 12 ounce bottle plus shipping this is ridiculous. This is not something I would buy again if it were 3 bucks."
"Maybe this one needs to lie down for a few months, so that the yeast can work a little longer? Very unique and smooth for all that is going on here."
"Pours a deep mahogany, with very little head & very low carbonation. Has a huge aroma, the cherry is obvious, along with a nice bourbon oak notes. Taste has some nice oak, chocolate, tobacco, and yes, black cherry. Mouthfeel is fairly light for such a strong beer, nice! It's preety tasty, drinkability is good, except for the cost... A nice treat!"
"12 oz bottle from Bottle Trek. Pours murky brown/mahogany. Very small off white ring in the glass. Aroma is wood, booze, tart fruit and maybe a hint of cherries. Flavor is very full...sherry like. Too much booze in the flavor with some tartness and tobacco. I like the regular better."
"Many thanks to vwcraig for giving me the hook-up on HOTD beers or I wouldn't have been able to try this. This gushed despite being properly chilled which is always a disappointment with expensive beers but I didn't lose much. It looks nice, dark black-brown, no head, red edges. It smells like wood, barrels, liquor, alcohol, very interesting. The flavor has a leather quality that I get from regular Adam, the slightest touch of tartness but I couldn't pinpoint it as a cherry flavor. This was pretty good but I'm not sure I'd pick this up again given the price and the fact that I just prefer Fred and Doggie Claws over Adam as a rule. I do have one bottle left to cellar so we'll see how that goes."
"5/16/11. Was fortunate enough to sample the 2011 at the tasting room, and then later back home in Owings Mills. Was told the abv. in this excellent beer is now up around 13%, and frankly it shows. Still, this beer has so much flavor (just an incredibly intense flavor of chocolate and cherry), the alcohol is still very much in the background. I should add that the 2011 version is completely still (no appreciable carbonation), which in no way detracts from the enjoyment of this beer. Fantastic stuff..."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into Delirium Tremens snifter. Pours a dark murky opaque brown with purplish red hue with little head. Smell is a whiff of red wine similar to syrah with spicy red fruits mixed with darkfruits and hint of spice from the oak. Taste is still sweetness of heavy malt and carmel chocolate coffee, followed by the cherry's sweet semi tart flavor intermixed with vanilla oak and portish sherry flavors. Alcohol while well hidden is still apparent in a port like presences. I like the low carbonation on the beer at times but believe that a slighty increased CO2 level would of increased both mouthfeel and drinkability. However this is minor to how stellar this beer is and I think that it should age nicely."
"Love this beer..."
"Pours with a larger head this time, with better retention. The flavors have blended together nicely over the nearly nine months since I last had this. Chocolate notes have come out and they blend very nicely with the bourbon and cherries. Notes of vanilla and a prominent smokiness have become apparent as well. The booze has died down a bit without losing any of the nice bourbon and cherry notes. The carbonation has increased slightly, providing a fuller mouthfeel which is decidedly chalky at times. This is coming along nicely."
"3.4/5"
"I enjoyed sipping on this one for quite some time and i look forward to the next one. I'll probably keep a few in the cellar for a long time from now, maybe the next HOTD release party."
