Very smooth and drinkable so be slow with it. 4.5 out of 5.  Much better than other beers with more hype and brewery induced exclusivity.

4.03,3.1,4,4,4,4.25,4,"This was strong but it never felt heavy and there was a good caramel malt tone to this that reminded me of the Brown Dog Ale that I was more familiar with. The nuttiness and underlying sweetness of the brown sugar and caramel made this a slow sipper but combined with the fruit flavors, made this one of the most complex Old Ales that I've ever had. Worth a go if you can find it as this is a worthy, "Imperial" take on the Brown Dog Ale!","JerzDevl2000","Mar 05, 2015"
4.07,4.1,4.5,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style. it had pretty much all the key aspects that I look for in an Old Ale and in the end I did think it was a little on the boozy side, but the flavors and aromas kept me coming back for more.  This beer has ok drinkability, it's fairly smooth, a little crisp, a little creamy, nor sticky, not too filling and the alcohol could have been hidden better so I think one bottle would be my limit, I might regret it if I drink more than one in a row.  What I like the most about this beer was the aroma and appearance, they are both really nice and some of the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the booze, I think it could have been a hidden a little better.  I would buy this beer again and I would love to age some in the cellar.  I would recommend this beer, especially if you like strong Old Ales.  All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, some aspects were  little impressive and some weren't but in the end it made for a tasty beer and I enjoyed it.  So far it's one of my favorite Smuttynose beers and it's one of the better Old Ales I've had.  Good job guys, this is a tasty Old Ale, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Mar 04, 2015"

It's brash and sweet and maybe lacking complexities but the deep caramel/brown sugar flavors are pretty substantial. Definitely hits the spot as a sipper on yet another cold and snowy night. Will probably buy this to age and save for future winters.","Chico1985","Mar 03, 2015"

4.32,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage bottling. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big biscuit, caramel, toast, molasses, brown sugar, light chocolate, raisin, plum, nuttiness, vanilla, toffee, herbal, oak, light leather, and toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, oak, and yeast ester flavors; with great strength. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, brown sugar, molasses, light chocolate, raisin, plum, nuttiness, herbal, vanilla, toffee, oak, light leather, and toast/oak earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toast, molasses, brown sugar, light chocolate, raisin, plum, nuttiness, herbal, toffee, oak, vanilla, light leather, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and fairy slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding old ale style. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and oak flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 14, 2014"

Caramel and alcoholic sweetness in the nose, along with a bit of dark fruit and maybe some slight esters. This is a fairly sweet beer the high alcohol is also pretty noticeable. But there is more to the taste than just that as caramel is also very strongly present, there isnt much there in terms of hoppiness but there is a bittering character to somewhat balance the sweetness. Pretty slick mouthfeel as the sweetness really lingers for a long time, carbonation is pretty low which helps the beer feel pretty heavy and the alcohol brings a warming character to the beer. Overall, while this is a good beer, I was hoping to like it more than I do, it is a nice sipper although too sweet for me and I'd wish for the malt to be more complex as that seems to be somewhat lacking.","fank2788","Nov 08, 2013"

Thick, full-bodied, slightly chewey and heavy, this is not a beer if you like 'em light or not sweet. The sweet malts overpowered everything but since I have a sweet tooth the balance was just right for me. Caramel, toffee, chocolate sweetness and a bit of sticky syrupiness or molasses as well, but there is a touch fruit sweetness (I swear I picked up cherry). The alcohol is low key but does contribute to a dryer finish. Very slow sipper for me and one that I really enjoyed.","clayrock81","Aug 10, 2013"

The nose started things off on a fair note as well, giving bright butterscotch sweetness and veritable smorgasbord of fruit to behold. While the former translated well into the flavoring, coming across as big, relatively dark, and biscuity, the latter added pecks of sweetness here and there, only becoming starkly noticeable in the end of the sip, where it was left essentially on its own to fight through the harshly bitter, boozy, and musky finish. This was, at first sip, rather off-putting, but as the beer warmed the flavors melded a bit more, calming the booze, while that 10.10% itself started to warm the drinker, and calm that pucker reflex as you sat back and accepted what was in front of you. This is an interesting offering from Smuttynose, but it just wasn’t exactly to the same level we’ve come to expect from them, and especially from their “Big Beer” lineup.","TheBrewo","Jun 19, 2013"

An alcohol bitterness in the nose and very much so in the warmth of the finish. Flavours aren't as well balanced as I'd choose, with an initial sweetness that transitions to pure alcohol and bitterness.

Ethanol creates the burning, essentialy from the front of the palate onwards; spicy arises also from ethanol, with substantial heat and burn from this component. Closes dryly, with some lingering stickiness on lips from sugars.","falloutsnow","Sep 30, 2012"

I also pick up on some brown sugar and date characteristics too. Honestly, it's a very comely smell. I take a taste, and quickly, I am caught of guard yet again by its well-rounded sweetness. Again, it has a nice fruity sweetness, but it is not cloying at all. It finishes a bit dry with some interestingly leathery notes-- almost like tobacco. This is quite a complex beer. It's chewy, it's estery, and it's a success for Smuttynose. Try this beer. Cheers.","JChristopher","May 24, 2012"

Aromas are boozy with some chocolate and caramel. Tastes are complex but the alcohol is hot and takes away from the experience. Notes of chocolate, toasted grain, raisin, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and white pepper are all present. Mouth-feel is medium bodied with good carbonation, while being creamy and smooth, and finishes on the dry side. Overall, good flavors and complexity, but the booze is overwhelming. As far as an old ale goes this is in a category of its own, but I do feel the product is what was intended by the brewery - a fusion between a brown ale and an old ale.

Foggy brown-red colored liquid, cloudily opaque with no bubbles to be seen, the rims and glass bottom shift between orange and yellow. Extremely thick and dense nose of molasses, maple syrup, caramel, toffee, milk chocolate covered raisins, dates, figs, prunes, honey dolloped scones, there is absolutely nothing about the nose that is not in your face sweet, chocolate dipped cherry, apricot, pineapple fruit, can't really expect more concentrated orange reduction than here, defies anything to get in the way of its avalanche of sugar. Full-bodied, at first the tiny bubbled foaminess of the attack thinks you might get something different here but all that molasses maple syrup, toffee, chocolate takes over your mouth like it owns the deed. Date, raisin, prune, fig fruit, you name it, buttressed by apricot, pear, peach, green melon, yellow apple, pineapple flavors, The carbonation is not weak per se but nowhere near being able to handle the weight and momentum of the primary material. Basically, if hops were involved in the creation of this brew, damned if I noticed. Egregiously smooth and satiny mouth feel, creamy.

A whole lot of brown sugar reaches my nostrils though, this one smells sweet but not killer like a certain upstate NY brewery. Taste is a mix of brown sugar, vanilla, roast, chocolate, plum, more dark fruits and some booze. I like the mix, it tastes really good for what seems to be a mix of a big brown and a old ale. Feel is above medium and a bit hot, but this goes down smooth as silk. A nice amount of life on the tounge.

A very nice milk chocolate malt which serves as the backbone for the flavor profile. Some vanilla is present before the dark fruit flavors start to seep in. There is some boozy raisins/plum to go along with fig and carob. There is a bit of a bitter presence in the end. The beer has a moderate to fully body with prickly carbonation, a bit chewy and a light abv hit. A fresh old ale as it was brewed in 2010. It doesn't have the strong vinous fruit flavors which is typical for the style but the flavors that it does have, I enjoy.

Mildly fruity for sure with some prunes, there's also a solid leather character. The flavors and nose make me thing of an amped up nut brown ale. While there's a touch of stale oxidation present, thankfully it isn't too much. Slightly sweet on the finish with a blend of honey and bitterness, this beer is full in body with moderate carbonation.

Dominant flavors were brown sugar and creamy yeast, but it also had banana and caramelized sugar (crème brulee crust) and fresh barley, along with a bit of cherry, bourbon oak, and alcohol. It was thick with some carbonation, and had a sweet aftertaste with some alcohol warming. Overall this was a very interesting beer, not like a typical old ale, but more like a strong brown ale.

The aroma consists of roasted and dark malts, burn brown sugar, caramel, fruit (plum, pear?) and a nice alcohol scent, slight wine like smell (?). The flavors here seem to be a little raw in my opinion, seems like they need to settle out a bit as the alcohol flavor seems a little hot. While that flavor seems to be a little hot the rest of the flavors though raw are nice. Roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, plum and raisin seem to come to mind. As I said earlier the alcohol flavor is there and seems to really to be coming out as the brew warms. Nice warming feeling, growing on me as I make my way through this one, it feels like it would be bigger than 7%.

Little bit of hop presence for balance with no bitterness, no sharp aftertaste. Smooth all the way through. Could use a little more carbonation to add to the mouthfeel, but that's a small complaint.

Sorry to say (as I rather like the regular OBD, and I love SN in general, as well as the beautiful label), I think this is the least of the Big Beer Series that I've tried (S'muttonator, Wheat Wine, Farmhouse).

Some sharp white cheddar would have been perfect with this, as well as anything nutty (perhaps a praline?).

I'd tone down the alcohol presence s bit to make this a bit more drinkable and balance out the flavour a bit more, which could make this one a really good brew. That said, it's still good in it's own right. Also, I can't not mention (even though it's got nothing to do with the contents of the bottle) the truly awesome label for this one.

Aroma is malt sweetness, with touches of chocolate. Taste is surprisingly light on the grains upfront, fruity in the middle, and comes on a bit hoppy at the close. After swallow is when the warm really starts up. Mouthfeel is oddly thin-seeming, and drinkability is reasonable, but the afterburn might slow you down. Have to agree with some others, a bit of age would probably do this one good.","ppoitras","May 22, 2007"

Pours medium almond amber, moderate haze, cloudyness and sits under a tightly knit light tan head, that leaves nice, fine and scattered lacing. Allowed to warm up abit the nose is of some raisins, light alcohol and warm toast. Pleasant malty brew, more raisins, whole wheat toast, vanilla and a slight bite of mellow alcohol. Pleasant sipper, nicely crafted and smooth on the tongue.

Aroma is mainly of some caramel brown malts along with some slight almonds and chocolate. A bit of floral hops hits my nose as well but mainly malt. Sipping reveals a nice, robust mocha maltiness that almost reminds me of a porter. However, the body is a bit fuller (medium) with some nice caramel tones throughout the sip. A bit of alcohol also hits my tongue numbing it on the tip just a bit, while the finish is dry and a bit bitter. Very smooth aside from the alcohol tingle.

Malt profile is well balanced with all flavors having equal air time. Spicy sensation after the malt blast. Leafy hop presence left on the tongue in the aftertaste. Dryer finish is spurred on by a carbonation blast. Mouthfeel could be a bit more smooth and creamy, but unfortunately the carbonation is a bit too much.
