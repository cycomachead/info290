"Serving type: bottle"
"Pretty expensive bottle ($19), which caught my eye due to the Cigar City collab (they are not distributed here, so my first taste of anything CC).A very interesting brew, very woody and rough even with nearly two years age on it. Either it isn't quite my thing or it needs far more aging."

"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. As part of a Widmer/Cigar City barrel aged set. Smooth & tasty. All buttery on the nose & tongue. Less corn than the bourbon barrel. The ABV & price will keep this in check but it is definitely one for the books & bucket list."
"Superior in every way to the rye whiskey aged version, which appears to have taken all of the nice, sharp edges off of this brew. Which is excellent. Wonder which side of the fence the bourbon version will fall on?"

"D - One is enough. Too oaky and high ABV for more."

"Pours a murky honey brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, spice, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel, toffee, and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of wood bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is solid but slightly boring for a barrel aged beer."

"Overall: So… anyway. There’s a lot of wood in here. I would suggest that it is a bit over-the-top. There also appears to be a touch of staling or oxidation, which I assume is intentional, since this beer just came out not too long ago and I bought it cold. Maybe there’s a good beer in there, but behind the light staling and the heavy-handed oak, it’s tough to tell. Overall a disappointment (2.5/5)."

"Dark brown with a small off white head. The aroma is full of oak, grapefruit and cherry with some dark malt in the background. Cherry and molasses with notes of oak and light grapefruit in the background. Medium thick body, moderate carbonation and a slightly sweet finish. Not bad, but not something I would drink again. I think they got more or less what they were shooting for but an old fashioned flavored beer is kind of an odd Idea. The aroma is kind of nice, but the flavor profile ends up being precariously close to cough syrup."

"Gentleman's Club is a highly enjoyable ale, but a slow sipping one. Where it doesn't share the more complex and traditional British versions, nor does it shed its weight in order to prefer a sense of drinkability as do those either, but it trends American Barleywine, but with Olde Ale and Old Fashion influence."

"Overall its an above average beer. It's tasty and enjoyable at times, but I wouldn't seek this one out again. Unfortunately for me it's a big malt bomb. After half a glass I get bored of the flavor."

"O: A good rperesentation of a ""Old Ale"" which really pushes the limits on calling this an ""Old Ale"" since the ABV is a measure higher and Old ALes should not or typically would not have been aged on American Oak. This should really be classified as a Specialty/Wood aged beer."

"Overall: A good beer, but one that ultimately disappoints. Its branding promises a roaring 20's prohibition-like atmosphere that can't exist without some obvious presence of alcohol, which is also a hallmark characteristic of the Old Ale style. I feel that the absence of this quality is a fault that detracts from the enjoyability of this beer, as well as the celebration of its history."

"O - a little weak IMO. Quite bourbonesque, not a whole lot else going for it"

"Tried this side by side with the other two Gentlemen's club beers the bier stein had on offer, and found very little diference between any of them. All of them were dominated by a considerable amount of sweet malt and vanilla. If anything, this particular version was even maltier than the bourbon and rye whiskey versions I sampled, with more of a vanilla presence. Once again though, the difference was pretty subtle. My feeling is that if you've tried one Gentleman's club old ale beer, you've pretty much tried them all. Needless to say, I'm kicking myself for deciding I needed to try all three of versions that were on tap at the Bier Stein."

"o - Overall this was by far the best variation to me. This one had a very similar mouthfeel to the rye version, a slightly better taste, and a much better nose. Tons of caramel malts and toffee and much less fruit, this one also seemed to have a little whiskey to it. Worth getting, especially if you are only getting one of them."
