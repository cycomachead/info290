"Overall, it's a world-class beer.  It's not something to drink a six pack of, maybe not even a second bottle, but each single is an amazing rendition of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great flavor profile--caramel, leather, tobacco, a little burnt sugar.  Delicious.  Just want a little more carb."
""
"Great smoky and raisin aroma and taste. Had a three finger creamy tan head with great lacing. Mouthfeel has balanced, but could be less dry."
""
""
"Not really a fair rating since this bottle was a 1995. But the sum of the parts still could not equal the beer as a whole. An absolutely incredible experience."

"well done brew. unique.  lots of complexity"
""

"12oz bottle poured gently into hotel cup. Cola brown body with no head and great tan lacing. Aroma is caramel, nuts, molasses, dark fruits like plum and fig, anise, a touch of bakers chocolate. Taste initially borders on strong sweetness with chocolate, brown sugar, raisin, and maple syrup flavors. Light bitterness comes on the swallow with nutty and tobacco notes. Some smoke and band-aid flavors come late. Medium-full body, thick syrupy texture, virtually no carbonation, boozy sweet and tongue-coating finish."

"2002 batch 55. 1st time with adam...kinda wierd I know but that's the way the cookie crumbled. To me this dude is all about smokey leather, sandlewood with hints of other spices. I do get some raisin flavors but all and all its a pretty clean beer for being a teenager...."
""
"Bottle from trade. Big thanks on this one, as it is a long time want. Finally! Batch Number 82 (whatever that means) poured 1/31/15. Pours hearty and thick dark brown, looking almost black as it settles in the glass, with a bit creamy khaki brown head. Aroma of brown sugar, some spicy hops, sweet molasses and caramel, toffee, whoah. Smells rich and sweet. Flavor is chocolatey breadyness, peated malts (was not expecting that!), smokey mess mixed with sweet molasses and caramel. Lots going on here, but balanced nicely by the hops and finishes with a light crisp bitterness and light lingering sweetness. Rich body with plus carbonation, lively, yum. Lived up to expectations and included some unexpected flavors win the smokiness/peatyness."
""
""
""
""
"O - Adam certainly deserves its high ratings.  Even after 7ish years in the bottle it holds up and maybe has improved since being fresh.  Great complexity and balance along with a scary drinkability for a 10% beer.  This ranks right up there as one of my favorite strong ales.  Great stuff...glad I have more of this batch to savor in the future."

"Seriously happened to stumble on this one at the tap room, right as it was put on. We had no frickin clue about the brewery itself, let alone what this beer was all about. It was mindblowing. But it was also the top of the keg. I went back the next day and it was gone. They laughed when we were surprised."

"Way too sweet!  Far from the mellow characteristic expected of the style.  Unfinished fermentation, young batch?"
""
""
""
""
"Upon opening the bottle and pouring the first little bit, I was nervous as the carbonation was so thick and high that I thought I had gotten a bad bottle. After about 5 minutes the carb receded and lingered around the top like a crown. Dark in appearance and displayed a wonderful aroma of brown sugar, molasses, and raisins. This was very reminiscent of Sucre in it's body and flavors. At 10%, the alcohol was hidden very well. I need to grab a few more bottle of this on my next purchase. A wonderful Old Ale that is worth drinking over and over. And, if you've never had it, go and find it; I promise you will not be disappointed."
""

"Overall: Great beer overall; bold, flavorful, complex, and a tiny bit boozy. I wish the alcohol was hidden a bit better."

"Poured into a teku, dark brown and murky, with no head. Smell up front is smoke, a dark fruits, raisins, figs a hint of cherry skin. Getting a lot of smoke in the taste. It's a subdued smoke, not like a rauch or anything, but it's definitely there. Was not expecting it and it overshadows some of the other flavors. No carb issue here. As it warms, some of the dark fruit, caramel, burnt sugar flavor is coming out. Super complex. This might have gone over my head. Worth a try for sure. I'll try some with some age on it, see how that compares."

"I'd had Fred, and was a bit nonplussed. Likewise Blue Dot: thought it was OK, but nothing to write home about (unless you consider BA home, because I think I did write a review. But that's silly. Who would make that comparison?). Maybe the intervening years really have matured my palate. Maybe I'm just amped on America and puppies. Either way, Adam really stood out to me as an excellently crafted work of gustatory/zymurgical art, and I can fully understand the hype around AftW and CAftW (even though I haven't had and probably never will get to taste either). Since I've not had it FRESH, I can't speak to how it's changed over the years (this one's only about two years old), but rest assured after this bottle, I'll certainly be picking a couple more up when I see them to test that question. I suggest you do the same."

"O/D - Pretty hardcore. Age has probably mellowed this out a bit but the smoke is a touch too much for me. It's quite a complex adventure though, and quite rich. A decent example, but nothing too wild."

"o: overall is that this beer is INCREDIBLY complex, yet not overwhelming to your taste because it is so well harmonized. so well crafted. this is a beer you just need to try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I might need to go down to the brewery and try this one on tap. It's worth another chance. It's solidly good but not my favorite. I've had other HOTD beers that I've liked better than this one. It would be improved with a little less forward alcohol, astringency, and a little more character in the body."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: was expecting more of a similarity to a barley wine since it was labeled as Old Ale. I found it to be more similar to a Tripel or Quad (which I am not a big fan of). Still the aroma's and flavors are easy to pick out which makes it enjoyable."
""
" I love dogs."
""
"O: One of the best in class. Enjoyable throughout the temperature range. Makes me want to try the barrel aged version."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An odd, off-beat beer. The lack of head on a vigorous pour hints that something was not quite right with my sample. The aroma and taste was unique and sweet, indeed a desert beer if there ever was one!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is big, smooth and complex. It's really good as well and I'm sure this after some time in a barrel is like heaven."
""
"Overall: this has been a beer I have been wanting for a long time and was happy to receive one as an extra. certainly lived up to what I had made it out to be in my mind. great example of a stale-ish and leathery old ale."
""
"Overall- Very impressive strong ale. Very complex with a pleasing mixture of flavours that on their own, would not be particularly appealing but this mishmash of flavours comes together to create a mix of stout-like, smoked porter-like and English old ale-like characteristics all in one 12oz bottle. Very good beer that I highly recommend for a late winter/early spring evening."

"Lots of depth, though some oxidation notes, too. Plenty of sweetness, though not so much on the leather notes. I don’t know enough about dark Dortmunders to say if this comes close, but it’s a solid dark ale with some Belgian characteristics."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown to nearly black in color. A faint bit of khaki colored head rests on top. Brussels lacing is evident. I get a strong aroma of plums and figs along with with alcohol. The mouth is sticky warm due to the alcohol. The taste is strong with a bit of a vinous note and loads of dark malt. The finish is on the sweeter side due to the heavy amount of dark malt."

"Pours deep a dark brown, bordering on black. Good frothy, mocha colored head dies down to a fine lacing. Aromas of dark chocolate, herbaceous hops, liquorice, raisin, dates, figs, sweet malt with a hint of smoke & leather. Flavor follows the aroma, medium sweet to begin with; molasses, sweet dark fruits, malt loaf etc and a dark chocolate bittersweet flows before the spicy hop bitterness hits, giving a nice savory kick. Medium bodied, with a sticky texture. Good, pleasant, soft natural carbonation helps to coat the tongue, leading to a very satisfying, bitter sweet, sticky long finish."

"I've typically complained about old ales, which I will admit is unfair to the style. Or perhaps not... because I don't dislike this. It definitely tastes old, but there is a lot going on here. It's a nice sipper, with some interesting dark malts, dark fruit, and booze."
"Overall: Great beer, if for sure lived up to the hype. If I didn't have to wake up early I would consider doing this side by side with the 4D I have in the fridge, o well. I will be out in Portland in a few months, hope I can find a few to bring back home and see how it does with some more aging and to have a fresh go at it."

"We poured this 12 oz bottle of batch 89 in to two pint glasses. The appearance was very dark in color- almost cola-like with a thick, tan head and decent lacing. We found the malty aroma inviting, despite having very little hops or yeast. We could detect figs and chocolate, and it smelled very sweet and slightly boozy. The taste was amazingly complex- with smoke, leather, and dark fruit. The nose definitely belied the taste. The mouthfeel medium with decent carbonation. This is one of the best beers I have had in a while, so would I (we) have it again?? HELL YES!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Recommended, but perhaps a bit overrated. I'd love to try Adam from the Wood."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a nice beer. The flavors are complex and intense. While this is certainly a sweet, big beer, unlike many beers of this style and ABV, Adam never veers into syrupy or sticky. I especially enjoy the cherry fruit flavors and light bitter twang on the finish."
""
""
"Pours dark brown%2C almost black with a thick%2C copper colored head. Nice lacing. The aroma is complex - lots of dark roast malt%2C chocolate%2C with a hint of smoke. Maltiness on the front of the tongue%2C followed by chocolate and smoke. There's enough bitterness to balance out that malt backbone. Full bodied with lively carbonation. Overall%2C this is an outstanding sipper to enjoy on a cold winters night."
""
"Pours dark brown, almost black. Thick heavy white foam. Snowy. Musty damp smell. Woodsy. Smoky. Hints if leather, peat, dirt. Earthy, grainy taste with a harsh hop that interjects halfway through. Potent bitter. A tough pint for sure. Need to really enjoy Old Ales to get the most from this one."
"O-very complex and tasty ale, love to sip this on a cold winter day"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle. Batch 87. Pours a dark dark brownish black color with ruby hues and a 1/4 inch of light brown head. Moderate amount of lacing. Aromas of dark fruits, earth, chocolate, espresso and tobacco. The taste is tobacco and earth upfront with some dark fruits and chocolate. Espresso and warming alcohol. Hints of cola. Chocolate and tobacco at the finish. Heavy mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Very earthy brew with lots of tobacco flavor. Overall, a solid slow drinker."

"pours very dark brown with the edge showing some translucence. smell is strong on the figs, and a little rubbery, Band-Aid smell. funny I saw someone else refer to the Band-Aid smell. mine is from sucking on my injured finger some 30 years when they made 'em out of that rubbery stuff and the taste was very distinctive. I've gotten it most in stone's vanilla and chipotle porters. but anyway . . . . . . the taste has a little of the Belgian yeast and lots of the band-aid... twisty, funky bitterness. I truly am surprised by the super high ratings as I do not feel it merits them and, hence, the wonder if bouncing it off the tile hampered it any. seems to have a lot of alcohol presence which, at 10%, is deservedly so. to a certain degree. I suppose i'm just a little disappointed reading all the high reviews, finally finding one of these guys, and not being very impressed with it. it's not bad. and it's very decent, considering the high abv, but I probably was expecting too much."

"O - 4.5 - This is a really fine beer. I actually had higher hopes for this one than I did for Fred, and while this one is really good, Fred is the luscious winner in my book. But it's apples and oranges I guess. And this is still a very interesting beer and its complexity and composition are worthy of the Hair of the Dog name. Pros, those guys, among the very best. While I've had a handful of more delicious beers (though this is delicious), what this beer has is complexity. I mean, things are happening in your mouth, different things at different times, an interplay between flavor elements and mouthfeel elements. It's a journey. That's what I'm looking for in a beer."

"Overall - I've only had one other old ale, and it was similar but different to Adam. Both were good, so I think I may have to seek out more of this style. Hopefully they all display the same balance and complexity."
""
""
"OV: A great beer and if the alcohol was better hidden I'd have rated this higher. The flavours are there, but the heat punches through a bit too much for my preference taking away from the smoothness. It's 'only' 10% ABV but drinks like it's at least 12%+. Otherwise very very enjoyable."

"overall, just a great beer. take your time sipping it because it will give you a nice buzz after just one. very drinkable and tastes better everytime I have it. completely unique with its flavor. HotD just knows how to do some things better than others, and this beer is one of their best. balanced and complex and something any beer enthusiast should try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium to medium-high intensity, which manages to foam the beer quite quickly on the palate, but never causing it to feel fizzy. Ethanol can be felt in the nostrils and back of the throat, Closes semi-dry, with substantial stickiness clinging to the palate and lips after each sip."
"Very interesting beer. Bit of a sipper. Not sure I can say I’ve had anything like this before."
""
""

""
""
""
""

"O- This was another fantastic beer from HotD and is easily one of the best if not the best non-BA old ales I've had. There was a ton of complexity but still remained very flavorful with an insane drinkability. This makes a perfect after-dinner desert beer and I'd love to see how this ages, however it is perfect drinking right now with less then a year on it. If you like complex old ales with a ton of flavor I definitely recommend checking this out."

"Pours a murky brown capped by a very light beige silky, but fluffy one and half finger head. Fantastic retention, plenty of splotchy lacing. Grain, fig, dates, bakers chocolate and toffee on the nose. Dark chocolate notes, rich fig, combined with caramel notes, and grain. Finishes with added hints of leather and boozy alcohol. Slick but creamy and velvety mouthfeel. Truly fantastic. Simply an exceptional beer. If it wasn't 10%, I'd crack another for sure!"

""
""
"Pours a deep brown that has a ruby tint that comes out with a light behind it, with little foam or carbonation. Smells of an alcohol burn with deep, rich fruit notes like figs and currants. Rating to style, I can really see why people would love this beer. The flavors are strong and bold, and close out with just a slight bit of bitter on the back end, which all fades away into a smooth blend. For me personally, these aren't flavors I enjoy, so liquefying and fermenting them isn't going to change that."

"Overall: Pretty good stuff, but lacks the ""wow"" factor for me. I'd have this again, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"Poured into a snifter this is a heady beast. Tan, big bubbled and stubborn. Ugly, dirty brown with sediment floating. Aromas of sweet fruit-fig strongest, malt is dominant, some yeast notes here too. Taste is big and rich. Lots of malt with sweet toasted grain taste. Notes of toffee, figs, Finish is warm but not strongly alcoholic. Ends clean and rather quick. Mouthfeel is heavy and velvety smooth. This is what I'd like an old ale to be. A malt bomb that is easy to drink but better to contemplate. Delicious."

"12 oz bottle in a tulip. Batch 69 (brewed on 2-21-07, bottled on 3-15-07). Dark as midnight, light tracing around the glass. Plenty of carbonation for a 6 year old beer. Taste is hot, the alcohol is very apparent. Roasty and sweet. Raisins and dark sour cherry. This tastes like something in RIS territory more than old ale."
""
""
"A unique beer that seems to bring together all of the best qualities of an old ale and a quad. I'd buy this frequently if it was available where I lived. It's truly epic. Unmatched complexity. Not for newbies. I have one other bottle and I'm going to let it go longer than this one."

Overall...wish I had more...everyone who share it at Beachwood 1...loved it..including me"

"Dark chocolate brown color with a creamy head. Light carbonation, but a huge chocolate aroma...quite nice. Very sweet and deep flavor that coats your mouth and remains long after your sip. Big, big flavor, but still quite smooth. This is a great beer in this variety."
"O: This was a good beer in a style I typically steer clear of. I really don't understand why it's so highly ranked, but I also don't appreciate the style. 3.5"
""
""
""
"O: This is fantastic. I can't believe how much flavor this 12oz bottle packed. It was truly one of the most complex brews I've had. It was a little bit of a mix between a barleywine and a belgian quad. Would love to try the ""from the wood"" version at some point."

"Verdict: A really lovely Old Ale from Hair of the Dog. The complexity and balance is wonderful and makes for a really lovely session. It's no wonder why this brewery has become one of the premier in the country."

"One of my favorite beers, just finally took the time to review it. Wonderful for anyone who likes a rich, complex beer/old ale/quad. A great beer fresh or with plenty of age, along with its variants."

"Overall: Old ales are not for the faint of heart, but I love flavorful beers. This one does not disappoint. I wish I could get this one regularly."

"O- very good old ale. Huge head had me worried of infection but was not the case. Has some peat, smoke but not overpowering."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter; Batch 77, bottled 8/13/2009. Pours cloudy almost opaque dark reddish brown color with a small light khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lasts. Minimal spotty lacing, and some nice alcohol legs as well. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, fig, molasses, toffee, caramel, chocolate, toast, dark bread, leather, tobacco, earth, wood, and herbal earthiness. Insanely complex and balanced aromas with big strength; Wow. Taste of big raisin, fig, molasses, toast, toffee, prune, leather, tobacco, chocolate, roasted malt, dark bread, light char, earth, wood, and herbal earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruits, molasses, toast, toffee, caramel, chocolate, dark bread, leather, tobacco, earth, wood, light char, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible flavor balance with huge complexity of malty notes; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very slick, creamy, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is insanely well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a world class old ale! Huge complexity and balance of malty flavors; and dangerously smooth to sip on. This blew me away, wow."
"Overall, this rich, exceptionally complex beer lived up to the expectations that became greater every year I didn't drink it, and I was supremely content to take a long time savoring and contemplating its nuances."

"The smell of was so outstanding I could inhale the aroma all day, however the amazing aroma gave me high expectations that the flavor simply did not deliver on. I was expecting a complex range of flavor while in my opinion this beer has a simplistic flavor."
""
"O: Overall, an excellent old ale. A bit heavy on the leather but if you can get by that, it makes for an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: I think this is my favorite beer on this planet. I just love this beer so freaking much. Incredible complex flavors and aromas. Drinks somewhere between a barleywine and an imperial stout. Love it!"
""
""
"O: I like this beer a lot. It's dangerously drinkable for what it is and very enjoyable. I'm very glad I got to try it."
"This is no doubt a great beer from Hair of the Dog, they could just use a little better QC on their bottle conditioning."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a big beer that is quite filling and one that definitely needs to be sipped due to the complexity. Additionally, the alcohol in this beer is not quite as well hidden as I would have enjoyed and that makes it one that you can only have a single beer during a session. This one will really warm you from the inside, so I'm glad I chose to have it on this below freezing winter evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice flavors, but this is just too boozy for me."
""
""
"O: This is an incredibly complex beer, and with some age on it it could turn it from ""excellent"" to ""world-class"". It's a little boozy, but overall it's pretty fantastic."
"O: Certainly deserving of its high ranks, this is an incredibly delicious brew. Stashed a few in the cellar and I can't wait to see what time does to this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very, very well done Hair of the Dog."
"Medium-full bodied with medium carbonation; alive but also smooth and creamy. Totally complex beer with myriad layers, quite a standout in a long weekend in which a lot of rare beers were ticked."
""
""
"O- A solid Old Ale that goes great with the weather cooling off. A wonderful beer."
"O: Adam is a superb masterpiece of a big beer. It provides such a well-crafted mix of malty flavors accented with hoppy character. Definitely find this beer and I imagine Adam from the Wood is probably amazing as well. Probably the highlight beer of my trip to San Diego."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a well crafted beer that i am glad to have had the opportunity to try. Would definitely do again if available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This needs a lot of calming down. Wish I had another to commit to the cellar. Thanks to SatlyMalty for the chance to try it."
""
""
""
"O: While Old Ales are not my favorite style and I couldn't see drinking this beer on a regular basis, I can't deny it: this is a very good beer."
""
""
""
"Overall. Nice big beer that's smooth and has a bunch going on, all in a nice balance. Exemplary for an old ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Full but not overly syrupy. Very creamy. Fantastic beer to drink."
"Pours as brown as possible before you get to black with a thick, tan creamy head. Smells of dark fruits, brown sugar and toasted malt, and the flavors definitely match up. Love the sweetness, but it's balanced with some smokiness and bitterness and a trace of alcohol. Very rich and full-bodied mouthfeel. This is an awesome, complex beer that could take the place of dessert after a good meal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good Old Ale. Not my favorite but still good. I enjoy a bit more sweetness in the flavor but there are still some nice interesting smoked and raosty notes. Some slight coffee and coca can be perceived too."
"Appearance: Dark brown-orange with a medium creamy brown head. Nice lacing. Aroma: Smokey, caramel, dark fruits, chocolate, and some leather. Taste: Smokey, malt, caramel and dark fruits. Good bitterness in the aftertaste (long duration), but not overwhelming. Body is rich. Overall: Very complex and well balanced."
""
""
"Overall, a great beer. Not one that I would be drinking everyday, but something that I definitely look forward to trying again in the future."
""
"Pours dark brown/black, with maroon highlights. A finger of light tan head with good retention. Interesting nose, with molasses, toffee, nutty, vanilla, fig, raisin and leather believe it or not. As well as a host of other aromas. Very complex and intriguing, could smell it all day. Taste follows with all things mentioned above, again very complex, in fact I'm going to say this is the most complex beer I've had to date. I'd give it a 5, but it's hard not to imagine it couldn't be improved upon with so much going on. Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth, it hides it's alcohol well without too much sweetness or bitterness. Overall a very fine beer, going to have to pick one of these up now and again I think."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great offering from HotD. I had this on tap at the brewery but greatly preferred it from the bottle. I would love to taste it with some age on it."
"O: A bit too dry and leathery for me, but still good - a unique old ale."
"O: Not a bad old ale. Most are very fruity and this one is not. Quite smokey with lots of tobacco too. Great if you like that in a beer but I'm not a huge fan. I still enjoyed it and can appreciate the complexity and balance, but the choice of flavors didn't agree with me that much."
""
""
""
""
"It's a big delicious desert! Thank you Adam."
""
""
"OVerall-thebeerbug comes through again and gives me this insane stout. I have to say I was off the stout kick until I became friends with him. Great brew."
""
"Cost: $5.99 for a 12 oz bottle."
""
""
"O: very fortunate to try this beer that old and was pretty delicious considering how old it was. Good lookin out whoever brought to woodshop tasting."
""
"O- Love LOve LOVE this beer! Simply world claas!"
""
""
"Pours a deep brown with slight hues of red with a huge, billowing head. Nose is dark fruits and leather. Taste opens up with sweet sugary malts up front that slide to some dark fruits (fig and raisin) A bit of ashy burnt flavors are subtly in the background and then a dry woodsy bitterness rounds it off. Mouth is creamy and full. Overall, this is a solid old ale. Chocked full of flavor and really nice complexity. Wish I could have grabbed a couple more of these"
"O – All too often, beers smell complex and leave me asking for more in the taste. Not this time. This is one of the few beers that I’ve had in which the flavor offers even more complexity than the aroma. This was delicious and insanely drinkable for a beer or its style. Great, great offering from HOTD. I’m so glad I got to try this. Thanks James!"
"Overall, excellent. The appearance and mouthfeel are nothing special, but the smell and taste more than compensate. This is an especially expressive dark brew and must be tried!"
""
"Very thankful to have had the chance to try this one. Thanks Matt!!"
""
"Overall this beer is world class I have to pick up more and see how it ages"
"Yum, like Brian said, ""best non-BA old ale there is"". Highly recommended."
""
"O - Best old ale I've had. No complaints at all with this one."
""
""
"Overall: A great readily available Old Ale that has always been enjoyable whenever I've decided to open it. However in the side by side, I think that Adam from the Wood is the superior beer, albeit by a slim margin."
"O- A really nice sipping beer, flavors are complex, the fig and leather flavors are done very well."
"Overall: I tend to be more of a ""Fred person"" but I can't deny the impressive display of brewing that is Adam."
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is wonderful, lots of complexity going on."
"This beer pours black with rust showing under light. There's a thin haed and lasting lace. The aroma is chocolate with molasses and dark fruit. The flavor is dark roasted malt, baker's chocolate, anise and a hint of smoke. It's mouthfeel is thick like cough syrup. It has afleeting warmth as it goes down. Hair of the Dog Adam is a good beer, mild for it's strength. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good sipping beer. Not available around here, but would try again if it crossed my path."
"Pours nearly black with maybe a red tint at the edges. Half finger tan head with good retention and lacing. Dark fruits and a hint of malt in the aroma, sweet. Flavor of sweet roasted malt followed by dark fruit, malt and an alcohol sting. Medium body with a nice mouth feel. Interesting and complex. Worth aging."
"O: This is an A beer for sure for me.  Really edging on A+.  Really like this one.  Surprised I hadn't had it before.  Very Barleywine like."
""
""
"Really quite nice, and easily the best of the three batches I sampled."
""
""
"This was killer stuff. One of the best brews on my trip to portland and I was damn glad I finally had a chance to try it."
""
"This is an extraordinarily delicious beer. I’m pretty sure this batch is pretty green yet and likely to improve with some time in the cellar."
""
""
"O: Awesomely unique. Delicious. Expensive but a great treat."
""
""
"PS: The bartender that served us at the taproom was really rude. We were trying to have a couple of beers on a sunny Friday afternoon and she kept snapping at us and grunted one-word answers at my questions."
"Overall this is a really interesting beer, very complex flavors. Really glad I got to try it."
""
""
"O - This is amazing. I've heard some poor experiences with some oxidized old bottles of Adam, but I think I was lucky here. Everything came together so well. Very complex, but there are signs that would indicate the flavors may be falling off. It may actually have peaked a year or so ago. I don't think this beer can benefit at all from additional aging; drink now if you have it!"
"O: Not the greatest drinkability, abv is somewhat apparent, but it is a damn good beer. Very tasty indeed and can't wait to see what age will do to this."
""
""
"Overall, this beer is astonishing. I just reviewed a beer last week -- Straight to Ale Unobtanium -- that I said was the best Old Ale I'd ever had. Hair of the Dog Adam is better. At least as good, at the very least. Or, this aged bottle is, anyway. I am blown away by this Old Ale. I wish I had more. ISO: Adam from the Wood. ISO: more straight-up Adam. Amazing."
""
""
"Well-aged bottle picked up at The Bruery Provisions in Old Town Orange. Dark, murky brown with a sizeable head of big-bubbled froth. Huge flavors of caramelized sugar with toffee, coffee cake, treacle standing out. Warming brings out smooth alcoholic esters, bread crust, earth, husky grain. Complex, deep, but smooth. A beer for special occasions, but I think I could drink it everyday."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a really nice beer. It was more bitter than I expected, but I definitely enjoyed it."
""
"Overall: For an old ale, this beer is good. Hadn't seen it before till I went to Brooklyn a few months back for the B4B. Happy to have stumbled across it at Bierkraft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A phenomenal beer. Highly recommended; will drink again."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"O - Now I know to age my bottles of Adam for quite some time before digging into them. I've had several from the late 90's that were mind-blowing, but fresh, this isn't my cup o' tea."
"This beer reminds me of a German malt beverage that I accidentally stumbled upon years ago. I love it's complexity, while it is still very bold and makes a statement that it these types of beers can stand on their own. This could have easily gotten too heavy-handed and too thick and rich, but they put it on the verge of the craziness, and slam-dunked a really progressive, taste-forward beer that I will gladly consume any time I get the chance."
""
"D-intriguing beer, very tasty and thick that brings nice fruit flavors with a full body"
"I enjoyed this beer thoroughly, but I'll leave it up to time for my remaining bottles. Recommended for lovers of old ales, wee heavies, imperial porters, and English barleywines. 4.0"
"O: This is beer went above and beyond my expectations. Definitely will seek more of this out in the future."
""
"Overall: Favorite old ale. The hops in the finish is a good counter for the great amount of sweetness throughout the beer. Definitely not too sweet. Aromas and tastes are spectacular."
""
""
"Overall: One of the most complex beers I've ever had. Fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a beauty of a beer. Big complex taste and silky smooth. Easy drinker despite alcohol. Must have more!"
""
""
"O: Woodsies grreattttneeeessss love this thing!go buy"
""
""
"Overall this is an amazing beer. Worthy of the praise indeed."
"Mouthfeel is really good. Full bodied, full flavor, surprisingly smooth and a good carbonation level. Beer has a great balance and really tasty. Adam is an extremely drinkable, but it's a sipper, not a chugger. It's ok though, you really wanna savor the flavor on this one. Thanks googzoid10 for an AWESOME extra!"
"O: Interesting and complex, but not something I'd buy again."
""
""
"Overall, this beer is both incredible and unique. It's like a smoked Baltic porter mixed with an old ale. Unreal complexity, yet highly drinkable. Send me this stuff."
"Batch 81."
"What can I say...all my favorite components beautifully balanced in a creamy, voluptuous body. Leather, wood, smoke, figs, tobacco, and chocolate. Reasonably dry, and constantly compelling, drawing you in for another luxurious sip. Simply amazing, and even more incredible than the bottled version."
"I haves some at home and will age a few and go back to it and see how the bottle develops. I will review again."
""
"O: A very tasty brew: brown sugary and old-ale-rich to the core. To be honest, I expected a bit more craziness from the guys who made Fred, but this is a great, woody old ale. With this base beer, I’m guessing I’d love Adam from the Wood. New beer quest…go!"
"o - a wonderful beer. falls in the dangerously drinkable category, not because you don't notice the alcohol taking effect, but because it's so damn good that you sip it faster than you probably should. worth seeking out."
""
"O-my first beer from Hair of the Dog, and I am extremely impressed. Wonderful balance. Hides the alcohol very well, definetly an easy drinker."
"DOA"
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Highly drinkable. I also tried batch 82 fresh; it was good, but not quite as good. I think this should be aged, if possible."
""
""
""
"O - A pleasant ale to drink, a real sipper."
""
"ISO Adam from the wood!"
""
"O: This is an awesome batch. Really, the only reason I don't put this as 5's across the board is because I don't want to be too huge of a fan boy. But this is, IMO, a standard by which other beers are judged."
""
"overall - a great beer that gets better as it warms"
"O: 4.5"
""
""
"O – One of the better Old Ales I’ve had, and one of the brews I was looking out for at Gravity Head 2012."
""
"Overall this is a massively complex and rich beer. I loved it. The booze is incredibly well concealed, only coming in ever so slightly in the aftertaste. Moderate carbonation and clean, slightly slick but dry finish. Can't wait to drink another one!"
""
""
""
"In my top 5. Wow. Cheers!"
""
"Full bodied with very little carbonation, this beer is practically the definition of silky smooth. While the body is a little sticky and coating, it slides gracefully over the tongue like melted butter. The carbonation is obviously very lacking but doesn't seem necessary."
""
""
""
"Overall a very unique and fun beer. The smokiness underpins the entire beer but never overwhelms. Delicious, need to age some to compare it to."
"M: Viscous and lightly boozy."
""
"O- Great beer. Not sure if I have had an old ale before, but this one is great. Very glad I picked this up when I was in Philly since I have not seen it in MD. Definitely worth picking up if you can find it near you."
""
"O- Second chance at Adam and it's even better than I remembered it."
"O- I have had this beer many times in the bottle and on tap at the brewery. This is one of my favorite beers of all time and snag one whenever I see it. I have never been patient enough to age this one. One of few beers that truly is a journey once you crack the cap."
""
"O - My favorite year round offering from Hair of the Dog. I always buy a few bottles when I see it in NYC. Can't wait to see how this one ages. Such an underrated brew."
"Edit: Did try it again and it's spectacular."
""
""
"Overall – The alcohol is very well hidden and the taste is fantastic. Unfortunately my bottle seemed to be a little flat so I don't think this was a fair representation of the beer. I still enjoyed it and I will be on the lookout for another bottle."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great beer from a brewery I have only had the pleasure of drinking a few beers from."
"O: Before this beer, I wasn't sure I liked Old Ales very much. This beer made me a believer. Nothing short of pure deliciousness."
""
"O - This is a great old ale! I would definitely recommend that everyone who has the opportunity give this a try."
""
""
"great beer. dark rust, great head, retension, lace. smells and taste caramel, molasses, figs, leather, outstanding. smooth, strong, satisfying, and very drinkable. no hint of the alcohol at all. really compares well to bruery cuir, at less than 1/2 the price. would certainly have again, and cant wait to try fred."
""
""
""
"I won't pretend to be an old ale expert but this is a great example based on what I've had before. Flavors are strong but very well balanced. With the boozy finish, certainly not something that you'll have more than one of in a sitting."
"B"
"2.5 D: I think this could be a damn good beer if it was allowed to be. As it stands, it's at the lower end of average. With carbonation, I could see this easily breaking the 4s. But, I won't know tonight. I've been having nothing been trouble with b-wines from the cellar and their carbonation lately. It's starting to grow tiresome."
"Medium body with light soft carbonation there barely registers on the tongue. A bit thinner than I thought the beer was going to be. There is a bit of boozy warmth on the back of the tongue and in the throat, but it doesn't distract from the beer. Overall, really good."
"O - An excellent Old Ale. I wish this was available locally."
""
""
""
""
"Smells like the backroom of a mobster's den. Woodsmoke, vanilla, dried fruit, leather. Intense, but not as rich as a real dark porter or stout, kind of indefinable - not like any beer I've ever had, and consistently surprising every time I have it. Super-carbonated, which I think is kind of distracting, and while it has a huge head it dissipates quickly and doesn't leave much in the way of lacing. Overall, though, a thoroughly excellent beer, and a good way to unwind at the end of the night, if you don't feel like drinking too much and only want one beer to mull over."
""
"Edit - revisited many time since this first review, including a fresh growler shipped in a trade. Carbonation hasn't been an issue since that very first, and unfortunate, bottle. It's complex, unique, and consistent. And I will seek it out permanently as a cellar staple forevermore."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, after being underwhelmed by Doggie Claws (my first HotD brew) I've been won over. I loved this beer from over-poured start to drawn-out finish. Mmmm."
""
"D: A pretty decent beer with some flaws. The bitterness in flavor and odd bubblegum smell are hard to look past, but I continued to drink in spite of them (3.5)"
""
""
"Pours a dark cola brown, translucent, but barely see-through unless held up to the light. Topping it off is a creamy tan head, that retains stubbornly until the last drop, and leaves an equally creamy layer of lacing on the glass. Some trub present, so be careful with the pour, though even with some in there, it is non-offensive. Aroma is thick with heavy malts, creamy caramel, and chocolate chips; notes of dark fruit. Uncommonly smooth on the tongue, tastes of chocolate and molasses, woody, with notes of licorice, caramel, and indistinct dark fruits. Creamy and smooth, full-bodied, and splendidly drinkable, whether chilled or at room temperature."
"Pours with very minimal head that leaves some spotty bubbles on the surface. An off white ring sits around the outside of the glass. The color is deep mahogany. Glints of light come through, but not much. This beer is pretty dark. The aroma is pretty fruity with some figs, roast, and a bit of leather. Flavor is fairly similar, with some caramel and toffee along with a light smokeyness that accompanies the figs and dark fruits. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I thought it would be with a good lowish level of carbonation. Could use a touch more body. Overall I really enjoy this beer. Very smooth and nicely mellow. Unfortunately I have not had this beer fresh, but this seems to have come along nicely."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decently good offering from the Northwest. I could bug my sister for this one, but thanks to matttYCE for this offering, I don't have to."
""
""
""
"Overall: Why have I not drank any Hair of the Dog beers yet!?! I am honestly just blown away by this beer! I can easily say this is the best Old Ale I have ever had. This beer should age really well and its great fresh. Don't pass this beer up."
""
"Overall this is a decently good offering from the Northwest that's not hard to get but obviously not local/have to bug the relatives to get/have to trade for."
""
""
"This is the first Old Ale I've had. I enjoyed it. I have two other bottles of batch 81 that will be cellared away for awhile. I'm interested to see what some time does to this one."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a decent stronger beer to sip on for a while."
""
"Remarkable beer of a forgotten style, unfortunately distribution is sparse. I regret not trying Adam from the Wood while there, but time didn't allow."
"O- the flavor changed from molasses/ dried fruits to a coffee/ bitter sweet chocolate taste over a period of 5 minutes. This is a very strong and complex beer. I was attracted the the name of this beer after a night of several Pliny's and the movie The Shining. This beer does not disappoint."
" This beer is wonderfully complex and beautifully balanced. A very enjoyable beer and given the alcohol content its amazingly drinkable. As I said the flavour profile changes throughout the beer and gets better and better with every sip. Absolutely great beer, lives up to the hype and the name. Thank you Hair of the Dog well done!"
""
""
"Definitely a classic for the style and in general, probably preaching to the choir, but this beer rocks."
"O - A very nice treat, not for everyday consumption, but the more I sip it the more I like it!"
"O-glad this came around. I have been intimidated by the price tag, but might pick some up for a special occasion. Look out other Oregon breweries, here I come!"
""
"Must try."
""
""
""
"D: This is an extremely easy drinking beer, which is exceptional, considering the alcohol content on this one.  The alcohol is hidden very well, allowing the complexities to come to the forefront.  Becomes better and better with each sip, as it warms, and disappears from my glass quicker than I would have liked.  It's been a while since I've had Cherry Adam, but I think I like the balance and profile of the base beer better a little better.  Really top notch."
""
""
"at 10% impossibly easy to drink. HOTD absolutely kills it again."
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer! Thanks to mthomas84 for this one! It reminds me of cbs but with a less overwhelming sugary/bourbon taste."
""
""
""
""
"First few sips are good, but as it warmed and got deeper, it became overpoweringly cloying. This would be a perfect beer to have 4 oz of, but 12 was a bit much."
""
""
"Overall, one of my favorite beers ever and even thought it's the first, it's one of Alan's best. 5/4.5/4.5/4/4.5"
""
""
"Overall Old Ales are definitely my favorite style of beer so I was slightly disappointed by this. I enjoyed the complexity of this beer but this fresh version was just not my cup of tea. I'm hoping the older bottles I have are more mellow in the smoke/ acrid roast and more fruity. We'll find out down the road I guess..."
"Big thanks to Jerz for this one, I really enjoyed it"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Haven't had a lot of old ales, I tend to avoid them, but this one changed my mind. The flavor combinations are great and I love the raisin/fig aftertaste. A big beer for sure but a nice treat."
""
""
"Overall a worldclass brew!"
"Overall|: A solid brew but for some reason, it didn't completely grab me. I liked it but not an ""A" beer for me."
""
""
"Crazy strong prune/plum smell on opening. Endlessly complex nose. Taste falls a bit short of the smell, but is still darn good. Heavily carbonated, which actually hurt the mouthfeel a bit for me. I'd prefer to have more of a classic old ale texture, which I'm sure would come with age. A first-rate sipper, but I think I like Fred more, at least fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear reddish brown. Nice off white head. Looks pretty solid. Smells malty and smokey. Nothing special. Tastes roasted and slightly bitter. Really light and roasty. Overall well carbonated. Not thrilling me though. Meh... Wouldn't drink it again"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this is an excellent beer. One of my favorites. I've loved everything from HOTD so far. Need to get my hands on some Cherry Adam or regular Adam from the Wood soon. Keep up the good work HOTD!"
"O: This is one robust beauty! Dead on for a fantastic Old Ale. Huge dark fruit, leather, tobacco and molasses notes throughout. I can't even imagine what some cellaring would do to this. Alcohol is not detectable. EXCELLENT!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent beer overall, with complex and well-balanced flavors. It makes me want to check out some other offerings from Hair of the Dog."
""
""
"D/O: While plain Adam does not possess the rarified qualities of the barrel-aged and fruit-fermented version, it represents a strong contribution to the field of American strong ales. Flavors are decadent and very English; very much the old ale of repute that has been taken to the next level. At about two years of age it is smooth, yet bitter in the finish with a pronounced earthy hop character whose herbaceousness contrasts every other feature. Roast lingers on the palate, nearly scorched but appealing. Alcohol shows a constant but metered presence, adding to the potential for sipping pleasure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic. Gets you some."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oh my Jebus - wow. What...an...old ale! All the multifaceted characteristics just work so well together - sweetness, fruit, dust, florals, dryness. And with barely a lick of alcohol warming, this is one pleasing devil in disguise."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being below average. Overall it was a fantastic beer. The sweet, malty flavors were good but what really set it apart for me was the lingering smoky, dark chocolate flavors in the finish. Awesome beer to sip on this cold evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wonderful beer - I would definitely try this beer again."
""
""
"Great flavors, but the lack of carbonation makes this a little too thick. I think if there was even the faintest amount of carbonation, this would be a near perfect beer, and my score would be higher. Definitely have to try to get a better bottle."

"Smooth malt and caramel w/ just slight hotness. Leathery with hints of dark fruits. Full bodied."
""
"O: This is a fantastic beer. The taste is 5 out of 5 all the way. There are so many flavors that pop up throughout and they are all balanced and delicious. I am lucky enough to drink a lot of amazing beers living in Southern California but Adam is in my top ten for the year."
"**Bottle reads: ""Batch Number 82"""
"A solid old ale, but something in the taste didn't quite work for me, one of the dark fruits gave it a kind of funk that I wasn't a fan of. Overall though, a good beer that I wouldn't mind revisiting again."
"Very delicious and well crafted, balanced dark ale."
"Really unique, complex, and unlike almost anything I have had before. Definitely try this if you're looking for something different."
"Notes: Tasty and solid. Don't really see what the fuss is about, but this is better than the Fred I had."
" Overall This is a wow beer for me so damn good and complex. I certainly want to get some earlier batches. A definate must try!"
"Overall: Pretty damn good beer. Very enjoyable flavors and despite the 10% alcohol it is very drinkable"
"Given the experiences others have had, I'll give this another try and update my review as appropriate."
"Overall: Wow, drinking experience similar to eating a fine steak. Smokey, meaty, you want to savor every sip. Bitter but balanced to the very intense malt bill. This beer should define the old ale style."
"Overall- Very nice beer. Good for a cool october night or in front of a fire on a winters eve. 4.5/5"
"I am impressed...thanks Dave!"
"Overall:"
"O: I've heard a lot about this beer, sorta hyped. Don't know if I had to high of hopes for this one but I was a tad disappointed. Don't get me wrong it's a great beer no doubt. Lots of alcohol, but kinda good in this incidence. Will be awesome with some age for sure."
"O: I really need to load up on this beer and just taste it at different ages. This thing drinks phenomenally, it just keeps giving sip after sip. If you want an amazing performer in style, look no further than Adam. World class in every sense. I will load up on this, and put it away for constant visitation. I really need to get some Cherry Adam from the Wood to hold onto. If this is this good, then I'd love to see how the other version competes in aging."
"O: I really dig this beer. It's alive. Appropriate now, and I expect will age well."
"Overall, I think this is definitely one of the best of it's kind. It really is a shame that it is not distributed everywhere, because this is one that really needs to be sampled by all."
"O: Nice sipper, fresh or aged. Pretty sure I enjoy this beer a bit more when it's fresh personally, but the beer certainly holds up pretty well over time."
"Pour from a bottle dark brown with a 2 finger white fluffy head. smells of dark fruit and carmell. taste dark fruit slight smoke/ cigar swtt malt complexity but some hops are in the background there reminds of a quad without Belgian yeast . brought at whole foods devon 4.99 a steal in my eyes cheers"
"Pours a very dark brown/ black color, a lot like an imperial stout. Aroma is deceptively light, hops are up from where if I was blindfolded I would think this is a sweeter dipa or a heavily hopped barley wine. Taste is sweet, malty and hoppy. Fruits are present and welcomed. Smooth for what it is, but I want to sip this one, great beer, I'll have another"
"O- Really like this Old Ale. Most of the others ive had have been overly sweet while this one was a little more laid back. The taste was sweet whie still being able to taste everything else. Well done."
"O: This is a big beer. Big flavors, thick body, dark appearance, big alcohol, then again it is an Old Ale. This would be perfect in the middle of the winter after coming inside from the cold."
"Overall- This completely lived up to its reputation. This is exactly what I wanted it to be like and more. Wish I had more than just one bottle."
"Pours brownish-black with a tan head. There is quite a bit of smoke on the nose, melded with hops and a touch of leather. Wow, there is a lot going on in the taste. Leather, smoke, slightly bitter hops, dark fruit, mild roasted malt sweetness. This beer is earthy. Not nearly as sweet of heavy as many old ales. Actually, one might even call it a bit dry for what it is. Having had cherry adam recently, adam is absent any of the brightness that really causes the cherry adam to pop. The mouthfeel is not as heavy as one might expect with a solid amount of carbonation. Overall, this is an enjoyable, complicated beer that is fun to enjoy slowly."
"This brew is big, but not in your face. A delicate, graceful giant."
"Delicious, rich, and wonderful. Not at all what I was expecting from this beer but its fantastic. Way too strong to be gulped though, you have to sip it, but for that, I loved it and would have it again in a heart beat."
"Fuller body, lower carbonation, sticky but kind of flat on the tongue. Plenty of delicious flavor, but the appearance and feel is lacking on this batch - I'd like to try a fresher one again."
"D - It is very easy to drink and I'm forcing myself to hold back so its not finished too quickly."
"O - Very complex beer. So many things going on and for the most part it works together. While I don't love it as much as North Coast Old Stock I do think this is a very good beer."
"Overall Impression- For my first Hair of the Dog brew, this one rocked! I could see this being even better as it ages. Wish I knew when this one was bottled or was ""best by"" so I could see how long I waited to drink this. Thanks a ton for this brew Mark! Will be looking for more Hair of the Dog soon and am looking forward to trading for Adam of the Wood."
"Overall: This beer is very pleasant, anyone who is not used to consuming heavy beers might find this to be too much too much. That’s said this beer is a definite sipper and that is how it should be approached.. This beer would be good to drink on a cold winter day. I have a batch 73 in the cellar that I will be cellaring for a couple more years!"
"I must admit, this was a quite different Old Ale for me. The drinkability of this beer weighed heavily on my scoring, as the flavor profile does leave a bit to be desired. While I appreciate the smokiness of the beer, it was rather confusing on what this beer wants to be. The base of an Old Ale is there but, in my honest opinion, the flavor needs to focus less on the smoke and more on blending it all together, as a whole."
"Overall: a tasty and satisfying old ale. Breaking this beer down to its constituent parts doesn't do it justice, though, I think; as a whole, this is a very good beer."
"I'd imagine the Cherry Adam from the Wood would vastly improve the slightly pedestrian aromatic aspect of this beer. But that's the only negative comment I can muster for this incredible brew."
"Overall - A great old ale. This is what I look for in an old ale. Great malt complexity with a nice hop earthiness. And finally someone made an old ale that doesn't taste like apples."
"Appearance 4/5; Aroma 3/5; Taste 2.5/5; Mouthfeel 3.5/5; Overall 3/5"
"Had this back in 2008. This beer was really cool, I don't know what it is about HotD brewing but they have this style about them that I find really interesting. This beer poured out as a black color with a pretty good sized head on it. The smell of malts and hops are strong in this beer. The taste kicks off with a pretty strong hoppy flavor and then fades into a roasted dry chocolatey flavor. The mouthfeel is a little on the thicker side, it remained smooth and drinkable but has a very nice body to it. Overall I really liked this beer, it opened my eyes to the old ale style. Since this was one of my first of that style. Really wanna have this one again."
"O-a very good and unique beer though the flavors seem to escape me, the more i drink it. this isn't for the long run! i wouldn't want more than one at a time, not because of the alcohol, but because of the thickness of the beer."
"Overall - a really tasty beer."
"Overall: The slight hop kick added a lot of value by removing the excess sweetness that sometimes troubles me about old ales. Nicely done."
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, filling, good kick, nice representation of style. I've been excited to try something by Hair of the Dog - at first the booziness in the nose had me doubtful, but the first taste of booziness subsides to really nice beer."
"O-Wasn't expecting the chocolate when I cracked this beer open, but it was still great. Only have have two HotD brews and both have been fantastic. As I said previously just a touch more bitterness and this beer would be even more amazing."
"O- Couldn't finish. This beer just didn't work for me at all. The tasted faded a bit as I drank more but still, not good. Every sip was a chore. I had to pour it out which I really do not like doing. Undrinkable."
"I was expecting something similar to Old Rasputin upon first sniff, but this was something completely different. Creaminess prevailed as a central theme that wasn't overpowering in this beer. I didn't taste any leather, but it's leathery in the way a man's drink should be: thick and strong in scent. It's a sipper, and a damn good one at that. The alcohol is hidden well, unlike Palo Santo, a good comp. Where DFH's beer kicks you in the face, Hair of the Dog invites you in for a cigar. If only I was closer to Portland..."
"O ~ Excellent, drinkable, double digit Ale. Beautifully crafted with notable complexities."
"Really needs more boldness of flavors and significantly more body. A few years of age would be great too."
"O: A nice beer, but I was reminded strongly of a good number of other beers I've had. Nothing too shocking or interesting in this beer, if you've had enough you've had almost all of the flavors before. That being said, for those who loves those very dark cowboy flavors, this beer is for you and is dangerously drinkable considering the big ABV."
"Overall: This one is dangerously drinkable. The rich, malty sweetness and alcohol would prevent me from wanting more than one in a night, but MAN, it's good! I'm going to cellar a couple to see how they hold up over a couple years. I'm guessing they'll be JUST fine!"
"Overall: One of the best beers I have had. I will buy this at every opportunity!"
"O: I totally wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was and I'm glad I finally made the decision to finally pop this one. Amazing...."
"Overall: I wasn’t really sure what to expect on this one as it is a “Old World Beer”. Whatever it was, it wasn’t my favorite type of beer – almost stout like. I had higher hope given the talk I’ve hear surrounding Adam, but it definitely wasn’t bad. Overall I found it to just be so-so."
"You can read my review of this and a couple other barleywines at dearmondfood.blogspot.com"
"O- This beer really surprised me, I was blown away by how complex and big this beer was, every sip had a big bite to it, really impressed."
"Adam pours a murky, deep mahogany. It's absolutely solid and imposing, even direct backlighting results in nary a shimmer of highlight at the edge of the glass. There's a solid three fingers of khaki colored foam sitting atop the beer. Staying power is off the charts, and a thick solid ring of lacing is left marking the apex of the head, with more spotty lacing trailing down the glass below. The only thing keeping the beer from perfection here is the unpleasant white floaties that remain suspended for a second before pooling at the bottom of the glass. The nose doesn't really jump out of the glass, but there's some caramel/toffee and the aroma of figs soaked in alcohol (with a surprisingly sharp emphasis on the alcohol), as well as a definite whiff of oxidation. It all works pretty well together though, as the booziness stops short of overwhelming. The flavor encompasses just about everything from the nose, and adds a light touch of milk chocolate to make things interesting. No one flavor really acts as the centerpiece of the beer, though I wish the oxidation was a little less prominent. The body isn't as full as I might have expected from a 10%, malt forward beer. That ends up working fine though, as the flavor profile isn't particularly rich/decadent, so a lush mouthfeel isn't really needed. Adam was my first Hair of the Dog beer, and I dug it. My best guess is that this one is maybe 3+ years old, I'd very much like to try one that's a bit more fresh."
"The heaviness coupled with the strength of the beer make this a slow-drinking beer. It's tasty with a lot going on."
"Pour was a deep chestnut. Big malt body with a syrupy aspect. Quite sweet, with brown sugar and dark dried fruit - raisin and prune, that dominates throughout to the dense, bittersweet finish. Perhaps this simpy isn't a style to my preference, but overall this interpretation strikes me as blunt and monotone."
"On the Overall, I find myself satisfied with what I've poured here. At $5 per 12oz. bottle I struggle to call it a steal but again, satisfied. Even more satisfied taking into account the balance of flavor, ABV, and ""lack of alcohol"" flavor I get from it. I feel like it walks an admirable line between deceptively dangerous drinkability and warming fireside sipper."
"O: Very complex with a lot going on. Glad I sat on it for a little bit."
"Overall a good beer. Not earth shattering but still an excellent choice for sitting around and sipping on for an evening."
"When poured into my glass it has a little more than a fingers worth of head. The aroma is malt and chocolate. It has a very dark amber apperance to it. The beer taste of dark fruits such as raisons or plums and it has a very light smokey taste to it. This beer feels wonderful in the mouth followed by a slight alcohol burn in the throat which I love. This is definetly a cigar beer."
"Adam, you're a good fellow. Nicely dressed, good taste, easy to take. Now, I'm going to enjoy comparing you to your cherry counterpoint. Be right back."
"Needless to say, I can read and follow directions, so I used a very gentle slow pour. I got a most impressive dense finger of light-tan head in spite of my low-key pour and it had great retention! Nose was quite vinous, reminiscent of a dry red wine. Color was a deep dark-brown with garnet highlights and NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was relatively full with a lot of carbonation in evidence. My initial mouthful was somewhat hot, giving way to a tawny port-like taste. Wow! I am not a wine guy, but my uncle has been into wine for twenty-five years or so and I have had some exposure to it. The dryness of the finish was gasping in its intensity. I did not experience the hops mentioned on the label, nor did I really get much in the way of maltiness. Instead, this would probably stack up well against a sherry or a port. I am really impressed and will have to get some new vintages for storing. Winner, winner, chicken dinner! Finally, the lacing looked as though it would take a jackhammer to remove."
"This is a full bodied brew that is slick in the feel. It has a modest to light level of carbonation which is very enjoyable. For being 7 years old, this brew is still quite bold in alcohol and hops that are more flavorful than bitter. A very solid sipper with a lightly fusel kick of alcohol. Overall a well rounded and enjoyable take on the style, I have no doubt this brew can withstand 10+ years of aging considering how well this 7 year old bottle is unscathed."
"D - This has good drinkability. It goes down very smooth and the flavor is very nice. It is a bit of a sipper, but hard to put down. Overall, i really enjoyed this beer. I recommend trying it, and I would certainly buy it again."
"Feel is creamy, medium bodied, with low carbonation. Lingering sweetness."
"O- Glad I finally got to knock a big time want off of my list. The contrasting sweet/roasty characteristics in this brew make me think of 50/50 mix of Plead the 5th and aged Bigfoot. Really relieved that batch 77 seems to be carbed, as I have been reading about people picking up lifeless bottles lately."
"This on is flat. Plain and simple. I've heard about some bottles of Adam being flat but I didn't think it was this batch. Otherwise it has a nice full chewy body but obviously some carbonation would be nice. Overall with all things considered this is tasty. I'd love to give this another go sometime. Hopefully not a flat bottle. Everything else is pretty solid but a flat beer is a flat beer."
"This is a beer to enjoy for most of the evening."
"O - A mild mess of a brew... There's a TON of flavor, but it's very hard to differentiate... Worth trying and finding, but I would let it sit for a LONG time! I hope to upgrade this review in time."
"O - A solid beer and would gladly drink another bottle of this. Full of taste and wonderful to just smell, I was happy with this. Would be perfect for a fall night and wonderful to age."
"O: This beer had some ups and downs. The nose was great, but the initial tasting fell flat. The backend picked it back up however and turned a decent brew."
"Comes out of the tap an opaque sable with a yellowish pale tan head. Aroma is mainly malty and has a chocolaty undertone.Malty flavor is somewhat sweet and has a chocolate tone plus nutty and coffee undertones. Texture is thick, smooth and subtly fizzy, on the heavy side. Definitely worthy!"
"Price = $4.99 at Whole Foods (NYC)"
"My first HotD beer and I'm wowed. Gonna have to hit my brother up in Washington to keep on eye out for these."
"My first experience with this style. Heavy dark sweet malts that dominate everything about it. Very figgy and sweet, with a refreshing tang. I'd like some more complexity from the knock-you-over malts, but I'll take it as is. No evidence at all of the huge alcohol presence."
"PP (Price Point) - $4.49 for a 12oz. bottle, A somewhat fair PP, I would feel more comfortable around $3.75 or so, but well worth it when you add up the ABV that it delivers, plus the TASTE! Very good!"
"Overall: It was good, but a little bit of a disappointment. I was hoping for something more complex to stimulate the taste buds, and felt like I got robbed instead. I've heard nothing but good things about Adam, and have actually traded it out on several occasions before I decided to actually try it myself. So for all you that have received this beer from me via trade, please accept my sincerest apology and I promise that I will make it up to you."
"O: Adam is another beer that skirts categorization. It is a well-executed sipper, despite its harsh and astringent finish. "
"My most anticipated of the two Hair of the Dog brews tonight was a touch disappointing. More sedate than expected. Fortunately a nice feel and size made up for a lack of perceived flavour and aroma."
"Overall, this beer has aged wonderfully. Glad I got to try this one. I tasted it side by side with the newest batch (batch 81) and it was awesome to see how similar (and how different) the two beers were. Thanks Alan!"
"O- Definitely enjoyable, and would buy it again (except for the price). A tasty well done beer, but probably not a masterpiece."
"O- This beer is excellent. I traveled some distance to buy beer, and I feel very lucky I randomly grabbed this. Wish I had more. Instantly jumped to my top 5 beers ever tasted. Great combination of taste, complexity, and smoothness."
"Really great ""old ale"" style beer from Hair of the Dog - very flavorful and enjoyable. It is also strong, but not difficult to drink. Quite lovely. I'll surely get this one again."
"O- this beer has a ton going on in it. so much so that im going to be looking for more to further explore. it broadened my perceptions of what an old ale can be."
"O: This is a great roasty, fruity, boozy beer; this is my first from Hair of the Dog and I look forward to trying more"
"O- Amazing complex beer. I love founders Curmudgeon, but this takes Old ales to a whole new level. I would deff drink this again and again."
"O: I absolutely love this beer. Thanks to Alan Sprints for dusting off an old world style and spreading the love. Seek this out."
"O- Not a brew for every occasion for sure, but this was high quality stuff. I probably won't see it here in Ohio, but if I ever make a trip to Cali this will be on the list. Fantastic brew, well done HOTD."
"2011 rate from an ancient batch 21 bottle. Pours a deep, deep burgundy with a surprisingly active foam atop. Nose is brine, olives, salted dried meat, leather. Mouth is dark fruits upfront, rich, some sugars, and a leathery finish with a touch of that olive character. The nose on this is straight up weird, but the flavor is pretty great. Totally unique, and this does crazy things as it ages, in some ways improves massively, unless it's just a major variation among batches."
"Big time leather and chocolate, bitter smoke. Hops provide plenty of bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice, big beer but the ABV is well restrained in the flavor. I enjoyed Fred better than this one, but it is still pretty damn tasty. I would be thrilled to have a case of these hanging out in the cellar."
"Nice and malty with grapefruit, raisins, fudge, Belgian yeast, malt, flaked barley, orange juice, sourdough bread, bitter hops, caramel sugar, toast, brown sugar, wheat berries, agave nectar, peat, ash, grape nuts, spice, burnt spice, cranberries and herbs."
"This is a great old ale. I think I may like it better than 4D. Dangerously drinkable and lots of great flavor. Got this in a packaged trade and may have to request some more. It should be a sipper but it goes down like nothing."
"Overall, I would like to review this beer again from a different batch. Possibly a fresher one. There was little to no smoke characteristics in the beer, which were what I came to believe were a big part of the beer. But as a whole, it was not a bad beer. Just not what I think is the best bottle to represent the beer."
"O - Enjoyed this beer, but it hit on most cylinders that old ale's tick on - nothing really out of the ordinary. Def a sipper, but enjoyable. I wish I would have had this beer as my first and only beer for the day - worth seeking out. I will def keep a few to cellar as I believe age will do wonders on this beer."
"Overall, a fantastically different brew. It's almost like a stout mixed with a quad, without the belgian yeast."
"Overall, its good. A prickle of carbonation could probably kick this one up to great."
"D- Ridiculously drinkable and well crafted brew. It’s so subtly complex that I keep picking up new notes every time I take a sip."
"This is a fantastic beer. I can't help but think that this would be the perfect brew to get your wine-only friend to finally break on through to the world of craft beer. This beer oozes compelexity and begs to be paired with a great meal. I'll be picking this one up again."
"Batch #77. I've had this before but decided to give it another try to review it. This beer pours a medium bodied dark raisin brown that appears black after it fills your glass. It has a creamy off white head that laces the glass. It smells of oak, molasses, figs, raisins, and has light smoke. It probably has one of the best nose's I've encountered in an Old Ale. The flavors consist of oak, leather, raisins, figs, molasses, maple syrup, with a light smoky ham finish. It's superb! I'm glad I decided to try it again because it's far better than I remember it. The mouthfeel is perfect. It is very well meshed and has a nice creamy feel on the palate. It leaves a nice oaky, leathery aftertaste behind that drives me nuts. This is without a doubt one of the best Old Ales around. Kudos to HotD."
"O: this is an incredibly delicious Old Ale that has some characteristics of an imperial stout which makes for a nice over all flavor."
"Overall a solid beer and my first from Hair of the Dog. I look forward to trying more from this brewery. Getting them will be the difficult part."
"Overall, this is interesting and quite good. I'm a fan."
"Overall - This was a fairly unique experience for me, being the first Old Ale I've tried. I did enjoy the flavor, and the aroma was impressive too. I really wish I had some cheese to go with this - preferably Stilton."
"Consumed on 09-15-2010"
"Overall, a very nice brew. Reminds me of a barleywine, with the malts turned to 11 and the alcohol hidden well. Definitely drinkable, but not too much so. Time might improve this one even more."
"This beer that carries my name is amazing, magical even. It could be the best beer I have ever had. The combination of such rich fruitiness with rustic, not over sweetness is not like anything else I have imbibed."
"Overall, this would be a great beer to enjoy on a cold winter day. Or anytime if you really enjoy maltier brews. It is not my ""favorite"" style by any means, as I'm not sure if I like the smokey taste, but I certainly appreciate what's going on here...excellent brew."
"O/D: Good, I could have more if the price wasn't too high for that kind of activity."
"Future outlook: Another beer consumed in California that isn't available around here. Glad to have tried, but not likely to come across again soon."
"Overall, this is a solid brew with a complexity like no other. I'm really glad I had the chance to try this treat."
"Pours a rich dark brown. Complex aroma of caramel malts, whiskey, wood and vanilla. Some alcohol lofts in as well. In the taste, barleywine like with a strong boozy note. Earthy hops are not afraid to show themselves. This was a 2010 vintage but whew, a strong one. Every bit of the 10%abv is noticed. Mouthfeel is full bodied and the alcohol sticks witgh you. Overall, young, this beer is very hot. Id like to see what some time would do to this one."
"Pours a dark copper brown with a huge 3 inch dark khaki head that fades to a tiny cap. Carbonation bubbles rush toward the bottom of the glass before rising to the top again after the pour. Good thin rings of lace around the glass on the drink down. Smells of smoked dark malts, chocolate covered chipotle peppers, and band aids. Very interesting and unusual smells for a beer. Taste is of smoked chipotle peppers, dark malts, band aids, and an earthy cocoa bean flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty flat with a thickness that makes this beer somewhat hard to drink. Overall, this is one of the most interesting and eccentric beers I have ever tried. With that being said I am not too sure I would revisit this one very often. A little too much for my tastes."
"Quite an alcohol bite like a barley wine. Warming. Raisin and Plum are aparent, a nice mouth feel. Kind of a smokey aftertaste. I have not tried many Old Ale beers, and this one is a sipper- and only OK. Again- mine may be tainted a bit due to the lack of any head."
"Overall this is a really great sipper. Not my style but very good. Nice balance, smooth swallow, and tasty. It gets some negatives for the low carbonation, little aroma, and small head but for the most part another solid brew from Hair of the Dog. Thanks guys."
"Pours a deep brown/black with a massive offwhite/tan head (massive, almost 70% of the gentle pour). Excellent lacing and sticks all over the glass. Aroma is of figs/raisins/brown sugar, slightly musty, cigar/tobacco, anise, bittersweet chocolate chips, and pleasantly smokey. Flavor follows the nose with brown sugar, toffee, chocolate chips, burnt wood, and leather. Very slight sour astringency. Moderate hop profile; slightly citrusy/fruity with a bigger presence in the finish. Syrupy sweet, but not cloying (enjoyable sweetness). Creamy and chewy on the palate. Glad I traded for two of these, looking forward to what a few years does to this brew."
"O: A really nice experience. I'm very happy to try one beer of this malt heavy brewery. Very nice bottle. The beer is quite drinkable (if the scoring was still there it would be 3.5). I really wish I could get more of this."
"Great price, great beer, I'm grabbing some to cellar."
"o - Overall this is a very good beer. The flavor is the highlight and this is beer that I will certainly seek out again."
" ~ This bottle is from batch 80. I have two other bottles cellared from earlier batches. I think this beer likely grows over time."
"O: Very enjoyable. A beer to sip over a long period of time, with or for dessert. Alcohol is well hidden, but based on the body and sweetness, probably best to share a bottle of this one."
"Overall a solid beer. I wish the carbonation level on this was a little lower. Still a nice beer and a definite sipper. I'd love to try this one with a good bit of age on it, I could definitely see it getting better."
"Overall - I think I got a bad bottle... the lack of carbonation is really turning me off but the flavor and aroma are simply exquisite!"
"O: At $5 a 12-oz bottle (and I am not even sure how we got it here in Indiana), this will be one to have as a rare treat."
"Got this while out in Cali for the RS Party this year. Batch #79. Served from bottle into a Surly Darkness snifter. Poured a massively dark brown just a shade shy of black with a three finger khaki head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, brown sugar, leather, alcohol, and smoke. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, cream, citrus, citrus hop, leather, smoke, and caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a damn good brew. The flavor on this one was other-worldly when it came to complexity! Really good aroma going on here as well. This was actually the first time that I have ever been able to pick up on leather in a beer I've had and I actually quite enjoyed it in this one with all of the other flavors working quite well with it. You really need to get this on your palate right now!"
"Pours a murky dark brown with some mahogany highlights, suprisingly large plume of khaki head, minimal retention and lacing. First whiff hints at many complex layers... smoke, leather, dark fruit, sherry, earth, charred meat, solid malt backbone (burnt carmel, molasses, brown sugar), noticable hop presence at the rear. Taste brings the components of scent together in a suprisingly well blended package... malt gives way to smoke and leather, good hop bitterness and flavor, mellowing into a richly complex and deep flavor. Medium bodied, maybe a touch highly carbonated for style, smooth and dry finnish. A unique beer which may overpower some tastebuds, but worth a drink."
"Overall: I love Adam! Some reviewer said this is like ""barleywine meets porter"". I couldn't agree more. Dark, strong, sweet, roasty, black... beautiful, different. I want more."
"(O) This was the HotD that I've experienced and it was pretty good. It kind of had a barleywine meets porter sort of feel to it."
"I dig this beer, Next time i run across the border i'll have to pick up a few bottles to have on hand."
"Batch 79. Pours a very hazy dark reddish brown with a medium light-tan head. Scent is a little boozy with some definite aromas of tobacco and leather. There is also a unique sweet smoke aroma with dark fruits and cherries. Very nice! Taste is even nicer! Initially I get sweet dark fruit and sugar with some hints of tobacco. Then I get some delightfully sweet smokiness with cherries and chocolate. Finishes nice and sweet with a bit of booze. Very tasty brew! Mouthfeel is a thick and a bit syrupy. Overall, this is a fantastic old ale with so much flavor and intense complexity."
"O first beer from HotD and i loved it. I need more right now. So give me some!!!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and rich as I said the malt was, but once again, the flatness of this beer is detrimental to it. I want the flavors to pop, and usually a bit of liveliness helps. Other than that, it is fantastic in terms of taste and mouthfeel which makes it all the more frustrating. Drinkability is hurt by the flatness, but the balance of the beer and flavors is pretty good. Tastes are strong, but well done, keeping this from getting out of control."
"A little bit too much carbonation early on, though a few swirls remedy that quickly. The body is medium, with a nice syrupy feel to it. Despite my gripes with the texture, this is an extremely well-done beer, and I hope to pick up a few more bottles in the very near future."
"(12oz bottle from Bruery Provisions. Batch 79). Pours a cloudy cola color with beige head. Aroma has anise, smoke, dark chocolate and some dank hops. Taste is sweet malts with some savory smoke. Medium to full bodied with a slick/sticky texture. Smooth finish with noticeable alcohol warmth in the chest and throat. Getting some hop bite as well. Definitely a nice beer to end the evening."
"drinkability - a really good beer, complex flavors, a lot going on here, if you are a fan of this style, its a must try"
"(D)- I was so excited for this beer, but its terribly infected. Normally I do not post up infected reviews, but I did contact HOTD about the problem with my bottle. After a month of no response, I feel this should be posted to alert others of the issue. Im not expecting freebies or anything from HOTD, I am just incredibly disappointed after what it took to finally get my hands on a single bottle of this since it isnt distributed in my area. I just feel its rude to not respond to a consumer who is genuinely interested in their product. I will try to acquire another bottle of this & re-review it. (1.0) F [1.18]"
"Not my cup of tea. Had this years ago. Trying it again, but not really digging it."
"D- Wow this is a very unique brew. I'm sure its age has a lot to with that. This can be classified as a traditional sipper. It really feels like i'm drinking a slightly watered down bourbon. And that's not a bad thing."
"D - Very drinkable for the abv."
"D - Fairly drinkable. It is a big complex beer (at 10% abv), but it is a well balanced and enjoyable big beer. The booze flavor for the most part is fairly well hidden among other flavors and only comes through a touch at the finish."
"D: This is an intense, flavorful, boozy beer that is a slow sipper. I greatly enjoyed it as a nightcap."
"D - Sky high, almost no alcohol present."
"T: A lot of sweetness upfront followed by a hint of smokiness and a long, lingering, warming finish. Lots of molasses and smoke in the taste, but the flavor always seems like it's changing, which is incredible."
"Very, very dark color wise-borders on black. Some nice sticky lacing on the glass though nothing really head or carbonation wise. Nice aroma-a whiff of peat, dried fruit, slight anise. Deep, bold flavor of plums and dark dried fruits. Mild molasses and a pleasant earthy, yeasty character. Whisper of smokiness. Nice residual sweetness-sticky, gummy candy like. Nice, full and sticky mouthfeel-no trace of the alcohol I was expecting. A great beer all in. Really nice as it warms."
"An enjoyable Old Ale that is not to be rushed."
"The drinkability right now unfortunately will take a hit because it seems I am drinking this one too young, but it is smooth going down for sure. Will have to get my hands on more and age it for a couple years, I see this beer being amazing with some of the edge off of it."
"Drinkability: I know it's a great beer but for me Drinkability was just ok. I think the sweetness and complexity will mellow this beer out in a year."
"The CPJ"
"Very sweet, very bold. Loved it. Definitely nurse this baby."
"D - Probably a little too fresh to taste the full potential of this one, but clearly a nice take on the old ale. I only wish I could have brought more home."
"I have yet to have a beer from HotD that didn't impress me. Consider them a brewery I will continue to seek out whenever possible."
"Very drinkable for style"
"Thanks to Jason for this one!"
"This was one of the best (if not the best) craft beer I've had on my trip to Japan from Jan 18 - 28, 2011. It was so good, I bought another bottle of it (1100 Yen) from Tanakaya Beer store along with a bottle of Cherry Adam (2100 Yen)"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is medium bodied with almost no carbonation. It's right on the brink of not having any. Overall this beer is very good. The carbonation or lack thereof in this bottle is definitely too low to make it outstanding, but I would definitely re-review if I got a Adam from a different batch number that is regularly carbonated. The score would be significantly higher, because this is an extremely complex, tasty beer."
"Overall, a great, bordering on excellent, big ale. A must try if you haven't already."
"Carbonation is pretty mild, but the slickness of this beer really brings about a mild to full mouthfeel.  The high ABV catches up to you, and this one is definitely a sipper.  "
"D - Easy to drink for a 10%, goes down easy. The worst part is the mouthfeel, which is very offputting. A massive disappointment."
"D: Medium plus"
"Overall: I've enjoyed this beer many times and it is insanely good. Cherry Adam might not even be as good as this (especially for the price). If you've never had it, trade for it. I need to buy a case."
"This beer deserves it's spot. It's a dark smooth beer that starts with a chocolate cake taste and ends with smoky finish. I could drink a bomber of this easy."
"This beer didn't pour with much head, but I know due to the higher abv that sometimes happens, even though I almost always like to see it in carbonated beverages. The color is a very dark translucent brownish plum color that is what I like to see in an old ale. The smell is fruity in nature, giving off aromas of plum along with some sweet butterscotch and brown sugar notes. The taste is surprisingly roasty, though that is not the main flavor. The main flavor is again the plum with some black cherry notes and butterscotch as the kicker. The mouthfeel is really very flat and with the highly viscous nature of this beer it doesn't help too much. I must however say that this is the best old ale I've had to date, though I will also go as far to say that I've not had enough to judge."
"Definitely something to seek out."
"OVERALL: This is a wonderful brew. The flat bottle kind of turned me off this one, but I am very happy to have had the chance to try it again. This batch is perfectly carbonated and a real treat. Lots of wonderful flavors and aromas, and a nice, big, creamy body to support everything that’s going on. One I would be glad to have again at some point. Thanks for the bottles gents. Cheers!"
"D: Such a great beer - one that I wish I had the rest of a case of to cellar. Full and robust, yet highly drinkable. Look forward to trying this one again."
"It's drinkable, because it's definitely not boring, and it does not give you a bad aftertaste that you may have with some other beers."
"This is up there with Fourth Dementia as my favorite old ale. Very complex, richly malty, and perfect for a cold, snowy Wisconsin night. Seek this out if you're into the style; it won't disappoint."
"Sweet caramel alcohol dominates with some smoky astringency and a bit of Alan's beard. The aroma is phenomenal, the taste backs off just a bit. There is an earthiness, from the Garden of Eden, perhaps? The blood of Adam hits the dirt, stirs it. The snake still hisses, unsatisfied. Come back for another taste."
"Good beer, good drinkability for the style."
"10% ABV. Batch #77 12oz bottle. HOTD Adam is definitely one of the better Old Ales I ever had. When I first poured this 10% ABV beer, I noticed a very dark appearance - deep brown and black mixed up. Did not retain its lace very long but packed with wallop every time I took a sip. I sensed alot of dark fruit perhaps some raisin, fig, slight leather, and smoke. Full bodied mouthfeel and with little carbonation. What I really appreciated the most was the nice lingering after-taste that tasted so good and what's more is that the high ABV was excellently masked! This beer has definitely made me a fan of HOTD Adam as this beer was pleasantly all over the map!"
"Get some. Great beer. Will definitely be seeking out more for the cellar."
"D - Very drinkable at 10%. Wish I had bought more of these."
"Overall, a really enjoyable, flavorful, and unique beer. I really enjoyed this and would have it a lot ore if it were available to me. Highly recommended."
"Thin head yet a solid layer of densely woven foam across the entire surface, below average lacing but some there. Murky black colored liquid, yellow around rims and glass bottom more than yellow. Huge charred, smoky nose full of ash, black soot, burnt kindling wood, peat moss, diesel fuel, Chinese black tea, bitter dark chocolate, caramel, candied cherries and rum soaked plums, spiced orange peel, comes after you like there's a million dollar bounty on your head. Full-bodied, lots of grip, not sticky but it soaks into every pore it can find in your mouth, dark chocolate, mocha, caramel, brown sugar, grill smoke and molasses baked ham. Grape, cherry, apricot, plum fruit, all over the map, sweet and close to dried fruit concentration. The carbonation brings a softer fluffiness, however, overall a minor factor. Resinous leafiness, tree bark, more black tea, the sweetness registering here tempers the edge of the smokiness. Plays good cop and bad cop all rolled up into one, stings the palate then salves the wound. Main flavors last forever."
"Drinkability- I drank this one way to young. Will probably buy a vintage version at Stuffed Sandwich next time I go."
"A very deep russet color, no head to speak of and a bit of sediment suspended in the beer. There are fruity notes in the aroma with figs and alcohol floating pleasantly over the rim of the glass. Sweet malt flavors abound with chocolate and caramel underpinnings. Excellent malt character on the whole. It pulls back from a sweet abyss just in time to establish a pleasant valley of chocolate, fruity plums, and a suggestion of smoke. The body is formidable with very little carbonation."
"Drink- 3 reviews for HOTD, 3 A's coincidence. I think not. Another great beer from these guys."
"D-Really spectacular. Not sure how old this is, but drinking well right now."
"I haven't had a whole lot of old ales. Coton was the last one and I probably wouldn't spend the money on that a second time. This didn't really blow me away more than a lot of barleywines, but I did enjoy it and want to continue to explore the style."
"Edit: After posting my review I read some of the other reviews. Comments on the batch 76 were that there was minimal to no head/carbonation. I got a ton of bubbles in my beer. I guess its safe to say that there's not just a batch to batch variability, but also bottle to bottle."
"It's an overall bold and relatively big-bodied work of beercraft that is very drinkable and a delight to savor."
"Medium bodied and excellently balanced with nice roasted chocolate maltiness, sweet alcohol, candy sugar and sligh dark fruit. Hints of raisin, fig, plum and dark cherry with a slightly bitter, war finish. Although their is some heat the high ABV is excellently masked, making this beer extremely quaffable. Very complex and delicious. Highly recommended!"
"Overall a very unique and interesting Ole Ale. This is a must try."
"Exactly what I think of when I think old ale. Hair of the Dog Nailed it"
"D- The high abv is pretty noticeable but this is meant to be a sipper. The mouthfeel of this beer is one of the best I have ever had. That alone is worth drinking this beer. Putting a few of these in the cellar to see how they turn out."
"D- A real good brew with a lot of complexity. Lots of different flavors that blend together and transition through the palatte perfectly. Not overdone. I'm beginning to like this style. I'm giving this a nice drinkability rating because the booze is so well masked, but this would classify as a ""sit in"" beer. Definitely want to try others from this brewery."
"D--This will knock you on your ass. Enjoyed a great deal though, highly recommended."
"I really like the mouthfeel on this one (as I did Fred); works nicely with the sweetness. A very drinkable option for a desert sipper."
"12 oz. bottle, batch 74. Pours an opaque cola color with a decent, frothy light-brown head, lacing throughout. Aroma is roasted malts, coffee, a bit of smoke, a hint of floral hops, and dark fruits (raisin/plum). Flavor is molasses, peated malt, dark chocolate, raisins, spicy, and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, syrupy, very rich, warming and bitter. Good beer, very complex, lots of flavor."
"HotD has yet to let me down. Always an interesting experience, and usually intensely amazing. They get their cred for a reason."
"Poured from a 12oz into a anifter. slight tan head that fades fast. Smells very floral and chocolatey. Tastes like pork, one of my least favorite flavors. Also a lot of chocolate. Drinks real well and moderately drinkable but that pork flavor stays. Unique but not amazing. Fred is exponentially better."
"to sip this beer because it just totally transforms the more it opens up. ill have to see out a few more to store away, id love to see what a little time will do for it."
"This is a very interesting beer, and my second experience with an old ale. Founders Old Curmudgeon is the only other reference I have to this style and that was before I really took notes. This is definitely a slow sipper, but each flavor is rich and robust. I should have saved this for a cold winter night, because the smoke and tobacco flavors would be perfect."
"drinkability: A fine beer. Still have 2 from Batch 75. Let's see what more age does to these."
"D: For the ABV and style ... this is dangerously drinkable. Adam is in the top 5 reasons to move to Portland ... no joke. This beer is legit."
"The taste is not quite as complex and leans a bit too heavily on the tobacco and earth notes, but it's still quite nice. Really good flavors accompanying what was found in the nose plus a bit of brown sugar and dark molasses. Nice feel with a bit of booze. Good body and carbonation. The drinkability is affected by the fact that I think there's a bit too much tobacco character, but overall this is a really nice beer."
"D - This is a phenomenal brew, worth seeking out, aging, etc."
"D: Very drinkable ale that i can imagine myself drinks lots of. Hard one to put down."
"Highly recommended."
"Batch 75 poured into new belgium snifter. A normal pour yields a huge three finger creamy mocha head with a slightly murky dark brown/black liquid. Great lacing and head retention for the abv. Smell is milk chocolate, dark fruits, peat, roasted dark Vienna malts, smoke and a it of an alcohol bite. Smoke and peat smell are a bit too much at first but mellow out as it warms. Taste is smokey up front followed by a hint of peated malts and bitter hops. The smoked flavors overpower at first but then are balanced out by the resinous fruit flavors - fig, raisins, sweet black cherries. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light to medium carbonation. I would have expected this to be near flat, and i am glad it is not - the carbonation helps the finish a lot. A bit of alcohol heat as it goes down. Drinkability is very good for an old ale - this is one of the best of the style, very unique and balanced."
"Drinkability is dangerously good at 10% abv."
"Adam is a perfect convergence of flavor, complexity & structure. I do believe this is the cigar beer I've been searching for. Highly Recommended."
"D: Was thinking about another beer after this one, but this may take a while to get through this one. The flavors are very unique, as I have noticed with the HOTD big beers. An enjoyable beer, but not sure if I'm willing to shell out the dough for another one of these in the near future."
"D: A real treat, something to be enjoyed in the study on a contemplative evening."
"EDIT: Had another bottle with elrogish, much better, cleaner."
"Very drinkable for 10%. Bottle must have some age on it. A tasty and complex Old Ale great for a winter night. Big dark roasty smokey brew."
"While it's certainly not a warm weather chugging beer (I had this on an 80 degree day), this is an excellent sipper for cooler climates."
"Taste was of some leather, but giving way to a tobacco afterfinish. Not a personal favorite due to the big molasses front, but it could appease other drinkers I think very easily."
"Drinkability- I would have a hard time drinking one of these. I would also have as hard time standing after drinking more than one of these. A little too much alcohol burn for my taste, will have to try it aged."
"D: A slow sipper, this is an ideal beer for a cold winter day. Very impressive."
"The alcohol is hidden well, and the rich, deep flavors are balanced by the fizzy feel. All adds up to a pretty drinkable beer."
"D - I honestly didn't know what to expect going into this beer and I'm perplexed coming out the other side. Really overwhelming and distinct flavors coming out of this, a lot of characteristics that I would not associate with beer at all. Maybe I'm a noob and I don't know what to expect from the style but from what I've read it lives up to every aspect. If I ever have this again I'll split with at least 4 people interested in drinking a cigarette stuffed puree of Fonzie's jacket."
"Beer is medium bodied and pretty sweet. Mild booze on the front end. Pretty smooth mouthfeel and good drinkability. A little dry, there's a tobacco like flavor in there as well. It's complex and good, a great old ale."
"D-This is only the second Old Ale I have had and I love it. My only regret is I only bought one bottle. Fabulous."
"Drinkability is good. This is a very enjoyable sipper. I found the 10% ABV to be well integrated, making this even more enjoyable than I would have expected. Adam is an excellent Old Ale and I'm sad that this is the only bottle I currently have. I will definitely have to pick up a few more for the cellar, since I think this beer will only improve with time. If you enjoy Old Ales or English Barleywines, then seeking this one out is a must. Nice work Hair of the Dog"
"Overall I am very pleased. Looking forward to trying its variants."
"Bottle. Hearty old world ale is right. Dark brown pour with thin off white head. Aroma is full of coniferous sap mixed in with molasses malt aromas and some booze, very nice. Taste is quite sweet, with a hoppy/sprucy freshness. Palate is somewhat heavy and slightly hot. A nice sipper."
"Poured a dark down w/ a very thin layer of head that faded quickly and left a minimal amount of lacing. Smell was very sweet and malty. I picked up big ripe fruit aromas w/ a little caramel on the back end. The taste was the same as the smell but w/ more caramel sweetness. I picked up a little hop character but it struggled to show itself through the sweetness of the malt. The mouthfeel was full. The drinkability was amazing. The alcohol is hidden very well and gives this beer a wonderful smoothness."
"Tasty, and smooth. Rather easy to drink."
"Interesting beer. I'm not sure it hits all the right notes for me as the alcohol, sweetness and vegemite are all just a touch rough."
"OK, this is painfully bizarre. Pours with absolutely no head, a dark, almost opaque mahogany. Obviously no lacing. Aromas of dark chocolate with bacon - maybe honey roast pork. Figs, medjool dates. Weirdness....Flavor is crazy bitter, and bourbon-y. Lots of alcohol (10% ABV)...Is this supposed to be this strange? It's like a train wreck in a bottle. Hard to say if I like it, and I probably shouldn't, but I keep sippin'. Not cheap, either. Not worth it folks. Look elsewhere unless you are into very strange things."
"Drinkability has to take a bit of a hit due to the potential for a cough medicine like taste when consumed a bit too fast. It hides the alcohol alright until the very end where it hits you. I've had this beer aged, and I have to say it does wonders for eliminating the heat and the drinkability score would be raised in that case. Such a great tasty beer to contemplate over the course of an hour."
"Drink- Good beer, but very heavy and difficult to enjoy in much quantity as is expected with this style. Would definitely recommend it."
"So very approachable and enjoyable with the heat only making an appearance as Adam reaches room temperature. In reading the bottle it seems this beer memorializes a fallen friend. What an amazing tribute."
"Adam pours a dark cola color with very good head retention and considerable lacing. The beer looks impressive, and is a presage of what's to come. On the nose this beer smells almost sinfully good. There is considerable chocolate, but with some underlying vanilla, golden raisans, coffee and light licorice. On the palate, this beer is every bit as good. It's fairly sweet of course, but the melange of sherry, wood, vanilla, cherry liquer, dark chocolate and light licorice (in the finish) keeps me coming back, wanting more and more, after every sip. Fresh Adam also seems to have some noticeable hoppy bitterness in the finish that helps to counter and balance out the sweetness as well. Mouthfeel is full with a long, drawn out finish in this richly delicious beer. Drinkability is pretty good, though I'm aware of the 10% abv. in this beer as I go along. Hard to imagine having more than one of these at a sitting, but nevertheless, this is just an exceptional, well made beer, and an absolute treat to have on tap. Yummy!!!"
"[Previous notes from 3/5/2007] I snagged a bottle at Higgins for dessert, and I couldn't of made a better choice. Poured a deep brown/black with a huge tan head. Sweet cocoa-like, malty aroma... flavors of chocolate, figs, tarts, smoked meat or cheese, and maybe something like a coffee undertone. Had amazing smokey, leathery, charred finish."
"The strong taste of smoke, coupled with the price will probably prevent me from purchasing more of this beer."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with no head, but a few tan bubbles. The aroma is chocolate, roasted malt, smoke and some soy sauce. The flavor is smoke, burnt malt, chocolate, roasted malt and soy. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"T + M + D: Like the head would have suggested, carbonation is minimal. What is there suits it, though, I find... with a beer with a flavour as big as this, it makes sense. Toffee, some dark chocolate notes (though not too big), fig/currant, with a little sting of alcohol on the back of the throat. Despite being a big sipping brew, it is strangely easy to drink. I'd be interested in trying this with more carbonation, as others have seemed to mention, because it worked out great the way it was. Maybe the bottle conditioning didn't take off, maybe there was some age on the shelves, but either way, it didn't cause any harm at all."
"Sweet, rich, malty, chocolate, mild smoke. I really enjoyed this one. Strong alcohol presence has that warming feeling. This was batch 76. I would love to get some more and cellar a few for a couple of years."
"This beer will age magnificently for a few years. Now one of my absolute favorite beers. Look out for #75 as it is a winner. Bravo."
"I'd drink this again, but am probably not likely to seek it out..."
"T- It has a very fine chocolate stout/lager taste. It's malty. It has a strong alcohol taste, but not overbearing. It has the feel of a stout/porter, but there is a lager taste toward the end. Confused. But good."
"D - This is a fantastic old ale. It manages to be sweet and malty without over doing it."
"Perhaps a little too sweet and too much alcohol heat, but otherwise a really tasty beer. THey did a great job with this one, maybe my favorite HotD yet, as far as I can remember that is."
"Drinkability is great but I can see others who would find this beer overwhelming because of the BIG flavors. It is right down my alley."
"Poured as if flat, but there's definitely enough carbonation. Smells like deep English barleywine and chocolate cake. Tastes like chocolate, tobacco, leather, lots of fig, lots of rum soaked chocolate cake. Seems hot at first, but mellows considerably early on. This is a great, great beer. Smell develops subtly throughout, and the interplay of sweet, rich, smokey, savory, leathery in the flavor is world class."
"Note: Batch #77"
"Big thanks to jgasparine for this awesome extra! 12 ounce bottle, Batch #68. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch and a half tan head. Head retention is excellent, and there's a good amount of lacing as well. Aroma is molasses, dark fruit, wood, roasted malt, brown sugar, caramel and some smoke. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's a really good fruity, smoky and malty brew. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's creamy and velvety with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good brew. I'm not sure exactly how old this is, but I do know it's aged pretty well! It's a great brew, if you have a new bottle I think you should definitely age it for a while before drinking it. It's one of the best brews I've had lately!"
"Overall, I expected better, but I guess I'm just spoiled."
"D: Delicious, but drinking a fresh bottle is missing the point, in my opinion. Hair of the Dog is one of those breweries that I generally buy, wax, and age without tasting. That's because as good as this young Adam is (A-), it gets even better after a few years (A+). Do yourself a favor and put some away."
"Most of this brewery's beers offer contemplation in place of mindless drinkability - Adam is a perfect case in point. This beer's complexity and uniqueness were, if not firsts in the American craft brewing Renaissance, certainly amongst the longest-running and leading examples. If you're sick of ordinary beer, this Hair of the Dog will do the trick!"
"The smell is huge leather and tobacco--like a smoking jacket--and prunes and dried dates with some sweet honey. I sip and taste heavy tobacco and smoke, dark fruit--plums, now, mostly, slight alcohol burn of malt and maple sugar with some roasted bittersweet chocolate. There are some woody, cedar/oaky hints that tame it well. Mouthfeel is smooth and while the alcohol is present it is not overpowering--toffee and creamy with little carbonation, but still silky. Leather and tobacco are the most dominant though it is so balanced and tasty it's easy to take down. Batch #77. It's a good one."
"Great mouthfeel. Amazingly thick and perfectly carbonated. The drinkability is limited only by thickness and abv, otherwise, I could drink this all the time."
"D - Hard to drink due to the pungent tastes and the high abv. Had trouble splitting the bottle."
"Overall, this is not a good beer, not one to search out."
"Mouthfeel is medium to heavy. Nice level of carbonation makes it easy to drink. Not a beer I'd ever have more than one of in a session, but still very enjoyable as a special treat. I think this is a true beer geek's treasure. I've never had anything like this - thanks to HOTD for challenging me a bit for my 350th review and thanks so much for the bottle, Cameron!"
"Taste is awesome on this, at 10% the alcohol is noticeable but that's to be expected. Otherwise this is one of the most complex beers I've ever had. It starts out sharp and sweet then the carbonation just explodes in your mouth. The caramel and toffee flavors come in an then on the finish gouged this crazy smokey/woody note that's just fantastic great beer!"
"This seems to be a very good beer but it was a just flat. A bit disappointing. Glady I picked up two of these bad boys. Hopefully the next will not be like that."
"The alcohol is hardly noticeable. This is one awesome beer. Why am I not drinking this regularly?"
"Deep raisin brown with more carbonation than the above vintages (interesting). Muddy smelling and def not as sweet. Caramel and raisins are muted, still some notes of figs and sweet fruits. This actually drinks really well but it's obviously a shell of itself and muddled. No oxidization though, very impressive. Tastes better than some old ales after only a year or two of age."
"Aroma is molasses, figs, and leather. Flavor follows suit but adds a slight metallic note, lots of layers, dark fruits, leather, burnt brown sugar, not much hop presence just a light drying in the finish, hint of smoke, cocoa powder, spicy rum. Some sweetness, on par bulky mouthfeel for style, low carbonation, silky. Certainly unique and I kinda dig it, no problems finishing a bottle."
"I've not had much success with Hair of the Dog, and I struggle to see the basis for their great reputation. This made for an interesting beer, but interesting isn't always good."
"Some notes from a Batch 76 bottle I picked up a while back in Philly, a little over a year old at this point I believe. Smell and taste are excellent, with rich flavors of caramel, dark fruit, leather and tobacco shining in all their glory and lingering forever. Unfortunately I could tell from the pour that this was just about flat and I was correct. Mouthfeel is watery and pretty much flat but the flavors are so good it makes up for it for the most part. Like I kinda noted in my original review, 6oz goes down easily, 12oz is a bit more tolling because of the richness. I also had a flat Cherry Adam a couple months ago, so I'm a bit weary of HotD's beers in fear of carbonation issues, but in regular Adam's case to me it's a small chink in the armor of awesomeness."
"DB- Love the big smoke flavors. The big surprise of the night for both Chico and I. Expensive but it is definitely a one bottle thing or a dessert beer like they suggest. Awesome."
"Drinkability -- Decadent, earthy, and incredibly drinkable for the body and abv. The dark roast and the heavy hop addition lend a really deep, earthy flavor that prevents this beer from becoming too sweet and cloying. Can't wait to drink this again!"
"Overall: The body of the beer is thick and full. The finish is complete and full. This beer has a lot of complex flavors and layers. There is a nice flavor in the beer and is very easy to drink. I am very glad that I got to drink it."
"This is a very intense and flavorful beer with an overall sweet taste and a nice balance of dark fruit, malt and hops. Quite unique and interesting, my only qualm is the low carbonation which could be just this bottle due to the carbonation being formed by bottle conditioning."
"This was the first Old Ale I liked, and has made me a convert. Pours a dark brown/gray/black with a small head (some times there is less carb, on tap there was a bit more). The aroma is complex: dark fruits, dust, caramel, earth. Taste is more of the same with the dark fruits up front with caramel and some tamed sweetness, the dusty smokey flavors in act two, and some sweetness mixed with dirt at the end with a mild alcohol warming. Mouthfeel is medium heavy and very pleasant. Quite drinkable for what it is, and feels like a true 10% on the brain."
"D: Even though this is full of big flavors, it is smooth and well balanced. I found this to be a very nice beer and look foreward to another."
"Full bodied, nice carbonation, smooth, and creamy. This is a nice drinkable beer, which I will need to buy again online, when I get a chance. I only wish this beer was somewhat less sweet."
"Update two: having tried several batches since 77, I've found that most are much more carbonated and improve the feel quite a bit. Now this is hands-down one of my favorite beers."
"Overall really enjoyed and was surprised by this beer. Complex tasty and easy to sip."
"*NB - the 2011 batch is inferior to the prior batch."
"D- well for 10 abv and about as much flavor as one can cram into a beer its super fucking drinkable. Oh yea I love it too."
"Honestly one of the best tasting beers I have had in a long time. Complex, dark and everything that I would want in something labeled a ""Hearty Old World Ale."""
"This beer pours a very, very dark brown that is almost stout like, but it allows some orangish brown color to shine through when put up to a light. This particular bottle (batch 76) has no head at all and very little carbonation. The aroma is quite sweet with plenty of dark sugar notes and some smokiness, as well as some alcohol. Seems pretty subdued for style. So far I am not impressed. The taste, however, is another story. Sweet, smokey, roasty, rich and delectable. It also has some cocoa notes and perhaps some tobacco like flavors as well. Dark dried fruit, maybe a bit of anise, leather? There is considerable alcoholic strength in there as well, but this beer masks it well. This is one masculine beer. I can see myself drinking this in a garage while smoking a cheap cigar. The body is pretty full, and very smooth. This is likely due to the fact that it has almost no carbonation, but it is smooth none the less. The finish is decent, but leaves a wonderful lingering roasty smokiness that is quite nice. This is also one of the more drinkable old ales I have had. This would go awesome with BBQ of any sort. This was a total random buy from my wife, and I will definitely seek it out again."
"D- This beer means serious business. It makes for an excellent sipper. Very unique and enjoyable. Worth seeking out."
"Thanks to hoppymcgee for the extra. 12oz. bottle served at 49 degrees in my Old Stock snifter. Batch #73 indicated on the label. Poured the color and clarity of cola with a dense, 2.5 inch creamy, khaki-colored head. Head exhibits excellent retention, barely allowing for the glass to be refreshed, before condensing into a solid quarter inch head with a band of lacing that coats the bowl of the glass down to the cap. Nose reveals dark fruit (plums and prunes), cocoa and perhaps a slightly metallic character. Taste follows nose; however some acidity hits early on and there is also a slightly roast/smokey quality in the mix that lingers between quaffs. A bit of alcohol also professes itself towards the middle and nicely muddles with the sugary sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a lively effervescence and a slightly viscous, although not heavy across the tongue. Really tasty, complex and enjoyable. This one might be a little young, but has great potential for cellaring. Now if I can only score myself a few more bottles."
"Awesome! Great flavors, texture. The only thing standing in the way of putting this over the top is the strength of the alcohol, resulting in intoxication & slight sharpness in the taste & feel. I bet a year or so would really put this one in the sweet spot."
"D- for the style and strength, it's pretty good- yet it still takes awhile to tame this beast"
"Notes: I'm not a cigar smoker, but I have a feeling this would go well with a good stogie."
"Drinkablility is such that I wish I had more and it made me not want to have to share the bottle haha."
"Truly outstanding. My head floated away in malt-lover ecstasy as I drank this. A near perfect beer."
"Thick almost black body with a small tan head that fades quickly but regenerate easily with a swirl. This is limited carbonation, it sits fairly still in the glass. The aromas are huge, tons of roasted malts with notes of chocolate, and a touch of coffee, before some peaty, almost soily aromas. The taste is rich and just as big as the aroma suggests. Heavy roasted malts up from, with more chocolate, molasses, caramalised sugars, and a rich roasted coffee. Towards the end the bitterness begins to take over with the woody peat flavours entwined with a dry hoppiness. Truly remarkable beer. Hope I get chance to get my hands on this again."
"This is my first taste of a beer of this style. Not really my bag, but from what I understand of the style, this fits in nicely. I'd recommend, but wouldn't pick up again for myself."
"This beer is quite thick and lightly carbonated, in a manner that suits it well. Outstanding beer for slow sipping and contemplation. Demands careful attention."
"Overall it's an ok beer. I'd definitely buy it again if I could find it locally but from what I have found it seems like this stuff does not make it out here to Mass at all any more so I will just have to savor this bottle for now."
"D - Obviously a well-made brew but the unique flavors were fine for a treat but not a session."
"D: Old Ales are quickly becoming a new favorite style of mine. I really enjoyed the complexity of this beer and I'm pleased to have ready access to this beer."
"Bought this guy during a December trip to Oregon in 2009. Wanting to age it a bit, I waited as long as I could to drink it, so...about three months. I feel like this one hadn't reached its peak yet, but it's already incredible. I'll definitely seek Adam out again, and this time, I'll buy in bulk."
"drinkablility suffers as this packs a punch."
"drinkability - a very complex and enjoyable beer but quite heavy and not so easy to drink a lot of"
"Drinkability: This is a nicely drinkable Old Ale and I'm sipping slowly to make it last as long as possible since I won't be opening another for several months and already I'm tempted to put another to chill. This is certainly a one a night beer with this ABV, but I'm also convinced that being from last fall's brewing this bottle is way too young and I'm definitely looking forward to another."
"Body is thick but not syrupy. Its actually very smooth in texture. Drinkability is ok. As this warms the booze character starts coming out a bit more and I'm sure because of it being 10% and thick, I'd only want to have one 12 oz bottle. But its an interesting style and I am glad I tried it."
"d - Overall I enjoyed this beer. It is a thick old ale that smells and taste strongly of dark fruits, with hints of booze that let you know that it is 10% ABV. I would definitely have this again."
"Overall this is my favorite Hair of the Dog beer to date. So complex and flavorful, while remaining to be very drinkable. A well-crafted Old Ale. Highly Recommended."
"Overall not a real winner in my book. A nice beer but I probably would pass on if given another chance."
"D - A sipping beer that's totally earthy with some good nuances. The alcohol is a bit much I think. With some more age all the flavors will blend pretty well."
"Thanks slayer3406!"
"Awesome drinkability. So smooth"
"D- High. This is the smoothest, tastiest, and best old ale I've ever had. A true masterpiece. Not sure how old the bottle is, but I can just imagine what this beer is like with some more time on it. Sublime as is, though."
"HV"
"Pours a very deep, dark maple, with a bit of light tan head that laces fairly nicely. The smell has a good deal of sweetness, made up of brown sugar, molasses, powdered sugar, figs; on top of that is a general booziness and a decided undercurrent of oily leather, almost a WD-40 scent. Though that may sound at least a bit off-putting, they all combine to create an overall pleasant aroma. The taste is ostensibly bitter, in terms of hops, herbs (something akin to wormwood), and leather. There are also hints of anise and raisins. The body sits a bit heavily on the tongue, and the alcohol is not exactly subtle, making this brew more ripe for sipping than straight drinking."
"D=3.5 Lots of alcohol and heavy bodied. I couldn't handle too much of the smoky flavors. A 12 oz bottle is perfect. Wouldn't want much more"
"Love this one, special, i ill buy it again and again as it becomes available."
"D: Tasty but too heavy and sweet to have more than one in a sitting."
"D: High. Fantastic flavor. Put one away and forget about it. You'll be happy when you find it."
"Pours a clear and dark brown color with an instant huge creamy head. Not really attractive until after all the foam finally settles. The smell is also interesting and complex with strong vinous, leather, and prune esters. The flavor is similar with fig/prune flavors, warming vinous flavors, and a pleasant campfire smokiness. The smokiness continues through the finish which is gradual and slow."
"All in all, this is a pretty decent brew. The best from HOTD for me so far. Great if you are looking for a toned down version of Papier. I'd definitely recommend trying this if you like ales. You will not be disappointed."
"D: Very drinkable beer, this one was gone before I knew it, really really great beer for sure. I wish this one were available around CT!"
"It is a bit scary how drinkable this beer is considering the ABV, and surprising considering the amazingly complex and rich flavors. I will definitley be picking up much more of this for further aging and enjoying fresh."
"Drinkability: The ABV is high and the flavors are boozy as hell, but I don't care is as it tastes sooo damn good to not drink as much as possible when this precious liquid is in your possession... I could smell this beer all day, and drinking it HAS to be an option; the tastes are wonderful... Granted, this is a beer that you should take your time with and enjoy every sip and avoid extreme intoxication. I would love to get a hold of a few bottles to wax and age for several years to see if the boozy quality smooths out."
"Good stuff - well worth a purchase, and the cherry version presents a whole 'nother gamut of flavor."
"Big thanks to CaveDave for this brew, Cheers!"
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip. Pours a deep brown color with a thick tan head. Smells of brown sugar, molasses and a bit of coffee. Tastes similar with a roasted coffee flavor up front, but as it warms it gets more of a sugary, sweet flavor. Extremely creamy mouthfeel. Fantastic beer!"
"Strong carbonation, thick mouthfeel - drinkability is lowered by the high abv, if I were to do one thing to this beer it would be to reduce the molasses a notch - the other flavors not normally tasted in old ales are a welcome surprise."
"Poured a deep, deep brown with good carbonation and a tan head. Nose is oh so good. Lots of chocolate, leatheer fruits and a whiff of smoke. Man. This beer smelled good. Taste, whoa! Awesome. Loved it from the get go. Lots of roasted malt, smokiness, chcolate, booze, tobacco, leather. Lots of things going on here but all very detecable and not muddied togethe. Mouthfeel was nice, boozy, hearty, roasty, leather, wood, cocoa and more. Damn good and very drinkable for the style!"
"Super easy drinking. This is fantastic. A real poster-child for aging a beer (with the exception that it loses whatever smokiness people report in the young beer). Balance is perfect, flavors are complex, and it's just going down in a flash. Only defect is the booziness that grows as it warms. This is probably best between 50 and 55, and is suffering a bit as it warms into the 60s."
"Just a flat-out amazing, unique brew. Wish I could drink it every day."
"Worth a try."
"One of my favorite readily-available beers, this is the one that opened the door to smoked and smoky beers for me. Delicious, complex and satisfying."
"Bubbles falling down. Pours a huge creamy tan-brownish color head, extremely lasting. Thick and foamy. Muted aroma, some rosted notes, some light mustiness, earthiness. Inhaling deeply, some dark fruit and coffee. Some alcohol too, but overall very muted. Somewhat thick mouthfeel, strong taste. Roasted coffee, some toffee, alchol. Some bitterness from the chocloate and roast. Some smoke and dark fruit. Imperial stoutish as it warms up more, chocolate, coffee, roasted notes. Strong, a sipping beer."
"Re-reviewed bottle opened New Year's Eve, Batch 75. Huge Duvel-like rocky tan head (no complaints about carbonation here), ultra-slow dissipation, exquisite lacing. A truly beautiful beer (bump up from 4.5). The nose is tres complex, big smokiness like a fine cigar, floral hops, a bit of bittersweet chocolate and leather, kept beckoning me back to take another whiff. The taste mirrors the nose, this is one smoky beer, while I haven't had any real Rauchbiers this is by far the smokiest beer I've enjoyed. A bit sweet, candi sugar, leather and figs towards the back end. The hops are noticeable in the finish, but not overpowering. The complexity grows as the brew warms. Alcohol is a bit noticeable on the back end, but not overly so. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky and certainly smoky dry. Good drinkability for this ABV, certainly a late night sipper. A nice nightcap beer, perfect in a snifter besides the fireplace. Another world-class beer from one of America's best and most innovative brewers. Cheers, Alan!"
"Yep, very drinkable even at 10%. I could enjoy two but would prefer to have the 2nd on another cold night. There are only hints of alcohol in the aroma and taste. I like the style and this is one of the best."
"This one seriously knocked me on my ass, both from the incredible flavor and the booziness that stuck with me. Definitely a sipper, but one that'll keep you happy for a long while. Wish I could find this in DC."
"D- I know that there was way more to this brew than I could pinpoint but I do know that I liked it quite a bit! Definitely worth trying."
"Iced tea colored pour with a small, loose, white head. Ripe dark fruit aroma balanced with citrus, caramel, molasses, and alcohol. The flavor is a big tasty bomb of dark fruit and clover honey. There's some notes of pine, grapefruit, rye, and pepper that add some nice layers of complexity. Sticky medium body with soft carbonation."
"Overall, I can see some of the draw to this beer, but I have to say that either my expectations were too high or it's just not hitting all the right notes with me. Perhaps I need to purchase another and cellar it."
"Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. This was an excellent sipper!"
"I could drink a six pack of this, but...HOTD beers are just exceptional beers that deserves to be treated with respect...I can probably only drink one or two bottles before maxing out my taste buds. Props to Alan for creating a great beer!"
"I'm interested in seeing how these age."
"This is a real sipper, a beer to take some time enjoying. How do you rate drinkability for an old ale? Guess it's good rated to style, but I would have trouble drinking more than two of these."
"Value: C"
"D- Great beer. One of the most drinkable old ales I have had. Obviously, it is a sipper, but not a struggle to get through at all. Lots of really complex and great flavors that work so well together. It's only a couple of months old, but drinks like a beer that has been aging in my cellar for years."
"Notes: Over all I enjoyed it. I didn't really know what it was when I grabbed it. Just saw hair of the dog and knew I should try it."
"Cigar smokers should note: If you are looking for a terrific brew to pair with your stogie, I can imagine no better one than this."
"Overall...a pretty great brew!"
"D - This beer was a quite a treat, after being very disappointed with Ruth, this beer showed that Hair of the Dog can make some incredible beers, cannot wait to try more"
"Delicious, thick, rich beer. Adam pours a dark, murky brown, tan at the edges. The head is tan, thick and creamy with tiny bubbles. The aroma is sweet and malty, brown sugar on malty toast. This isn't a vintage bottle, so the hops still come through with some citrus. The flavor is somewhere between a doppelbock, a barleywine and an English strong ale. There's sweet malt with some light toasty crystal malt. The malt has some good fruity notes, prunes, apricots and raisins. It's a really delicious beer - Hair of the Dog is an incredible brewery."
"12oz, batch 75. I was pleasantly surprised to find this one while in Indiana. Poured a deep brown color with an obnoxiously foamy beige head that foamed all over, but patience was the key here. Once the ale was finally in the glass, the head retention was magnificent and left some crazy lace on the glass - looks like a bomb went off. Aromas were earthy with hints of fig, leather, molasses, and chocolate with some faint alcohol in the background (the bottle does a fine job of describing what is inside - even the leather part). Tastes are very complex and warming - earthy, tobacco, fig, leather, raisins, molasses, and chocolate. Mouth-fell is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Alcohol is present by prickling the tongue and leaving a burn on the way down the throat - once again warming. Overall, I love it's uniqueness, but I'm not sure that I would buy it again. Recommendable at least."
"This beer is really good, IMO. Dark dark molasses color with a decent creamy off-white head that sticks around for a while. Smell is a lot like the label suggests-- a hint of leather (I couldn't believe it), figs, raisins, and alcohol. Taste follows the nose well, very robust and flavorful. Smooth mouthfeel, a bit prickly from the alcohol. Tough drink from the flavor and ABV, but delicious nonetheless. Definitely one worth seeking out. Complex and tasty."
"an old ale on the side of belgian quad. this beer had a nice fig quality but also a tobacco and smoke finish. the head was huge but with large bubbles. alcohol was undetectable. a mild sour of leather that gave it a nice english appeal... had it along side a trios pistoles to get a grip on its... very smokey. acidic. meatier. earthier. and a somewhat of a overpowering protein of breadiness. really worth trying. fantastic cigar beer. brings out the fruit end."
"Adam is a beer made with careful attention to details and top-notch ingredients....for my taste this beer is best as a slow sipping night cap brew - strong stuff."
"This one didn't let me down. An excellent brew that exceeded my expectations. This style is still a surprise every time I have one, but it is a pleasant surpise more often than not."
"The taste is rich but not to heavy, complex, highly balanced. It is faintly smokey, with dark caramelised fruits, hints of spices, hints of leather (as the bottle indicates- I didn't notice it at first but it comes on clearly after a few sips), light hints of bourbon, stronger near the finish. It tends slightly towards the sweetish side, but not cloyingly so, with a little faint bitterness, spice, and alcoholic warmth to help balance and carry it, however all of these are tame and the result is smooth. It is highly drinkable for the strength."
"Pours a deep copper brown color with a thick but small tan/brown head. Big, rich nose of strong roasted malts and sweet boozy wood. Notes of chocolate, coffee, caramel, fig and dates grace the tongue. Very complex and full bodied but still very drinkable. A fantastic beer."
"Note: I also sampled a bottle of Batch #40 alongside this one... and I can attest that this beer ages EXTREMELY well, developing a significant madiera character with time!!"
"Poured a very deep brown with reddish tints that only showed against a light. Dog had a generous one inch head that reduced to a thick skin. The aroma was that rich, boozy smell. There was some figs, or plums, or other dark fruit in there too. The taste was thick, sweet, rich, cloying but all good. I got some raisons, reminded me a little of The Beast. Feel was full bodied and chewy. Drinkability was average due to the high ABV and the syrupy sweetness."
"Glad I have a few more of these. While I would drink two in a night, I think some cellaring would do these puppies good, although great now. This one needs to be sipped and savored while relaxed, total bliss, this stuff kills. I have had two other HOTD brews(Fred,Ruth) and was underwhelmed. Adam is not the case. I would buy a case."
"Not too high of marks for drinkability, as everything about this beer cautions me from drinking another. A tasty example of the style, however. Maybe, I'm coming around to the strong ale and barleywine camp. I need more empirical evidence."
"D - A good beer for the style I'm normally not a huge fan of the style but I like this one has a good taste that I enjoyed worth trying if you can get it"
"D: Devilishly easy to drink for such a high abv"
"A beer you'll enjoy taking your time over - perfect for a cold Winter evening (not that we get any of those in Los Angeles). Was kind of expecting to enjoy this more than Thomas Hardy's Ale - but still find that to be my favorite example of the style I've tried..."
"Drinkability - Very rich and some alcohol burn."
"D: This is just a fantastic beer. Very complex and oh so balanced. Drinks like a fine wine."
"D - Wow. Drinkability isn't even a factor here, it is huge and complex; it's like asking if 40 year old port is sessionable. The complexity is immense and while I would guess that it would age well, this one was great already. This beer, more than any other I have ever had, reminds me of tobacco; not a cigar, but really good pipe tobacco. This is an excellent beer and it stands up with the likes of vintage J.W. Lees as one of the world's great sipping beers."
"D- The flavor and the balance of alcohol in this beer is remarkable. I paid $5.50 for this in a little shop in Pennsylvania and was taking the recommendation of the owner. He wasn't kidding that this beer is something special. If you can find it and like the Old Ale Style you need to give Adam a whirl."
"D: This beer is as drinkable as one would expect it to be. It is a 10% Old Ale that is pretty complex and meant to be sipped so for that purpose this beer is pretty much perfect. I think after 6 months to a year the booziness might balance a little more and make this more complex and a little more drinkable, but overall this is a fantastic beer."
"O: A pretty good beer that impressively lived up to the description on the side of the bottle - although the price seems a bit steep. Could stand to decarbonate a bit and sit in dark room for a year or two."
"D: Wow, HOTD is officially 2 for 2 and this one is going into my top 10 brews to date as well! What an amazingly complex brew, brave and bold yet extremely approachable at the same time, a tour de force. This clearly sets the bar for Olde Ales and also elevates itself in the elite league of Dark Ales with Stouts and RIS's. This is a gem, all beer fans should find it and enjoy it!"
"A sipper for sure, very complex flavors."
"still pretty nice, but may benefit from age."
"This is a really great beer. Lots of flavors going on but it remains well balanced. Everytime I have this beer I love it more and more. It's really world class and one of the best beers ever made!"
"taste is strong, smooth, prunes and other dark fruits, touch of chocolate, a smokiness comes through, very warming on the way down, ends slightly bitter and dry."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer, but way to hot. I will all the complex flavor in it, but 1 bottle will be enough for me."
"D - An intense, dark beer with plenty of character & alcohol. A real sipper."
"Imperial Stout meets a rauchbier? I'll take it! A very unique offering overall."
"Dark brown to black color with a creamy, thinly laced head. Aroma is just spectacular with this beer! Has an assortment of aromas ranging from raisins and juicy dates to wet grass and even burnt bread. Alcohol comes through in the smell and makes the beer a little spicy. The taste is more date, Fig Newton cookie, and bold coffee in the finish. Bitterness is more assertive than I would have imagined, but works well. A warming and delicious beer!"
"Drinkability: This is a spectacular old ale. It really takes the style to it's limits and pulls it off gracefully. I'm glad I have a lot of it."
"I'm surprised this is classified as an old ale. Two beers that I find similar are Stone RIS and World Wide Stout. I thought it was too dark and roasty to be an old ale. Also, a little too clean for an old ale."
"What a beer. Hair of the Dog is one of my favorite brewers, and Adam is another reminder of how original and creative they are."
"Overall a great beer from the Hair of the Dog crew. I couldn't wait to cellar this longer than a few months as it was too tempting everytime I opened the man fridge, but I would recommend cellaring as long as you can to see subtle changes to the Adam experience."
"D= This is a big malty, hoppy, complex ale that took me a long time to figure out before I felt that I ""got"" it. Delicious! Though neither the alcohol nor the sweetness ever seemed cloying, I don't think I could or ever would drink more than 1 or 2 in a sitting. A great sipper or nightcap though!!!"
"- Way big on drinkability... very smooth for it's strength.. and goes down very well... tastes great.. warmth only in the stomach.... overall one of the better Portland brews I have had bottled."
"D - All things considered, pretty good. A 12 oz'er is enough for one session for sure, but it sips easy enough and I enjoyed it all the way through. Goes down smooth and I could see it becoming a regular if it was a bit more value priced."
"notes this beer would probably be amazing if it was barrel aged or just aged in general but over all still a damn tasty beer"
"UPDATE 3/14/10 -- Tried another Batch 74 and it has grown into something quite incredible. Nice rounded smoke/chocolate/resiny hop flavor profile."
"It is a great brew, which I somehow managed to miss for this long. I need a case to cellar as I am sure it will lose some carbonation, mellow out and turn quite spectacular."
"A very tasty sipper. Lots of things to like about this - boozy and dark, smoky but refined. Almost too much to drink a 12oz bottle by yourself. My suggestion is to pour it into snifters and share with friends."
"Overall, there is just so much going on here...almost too much at times and a bit sweet, but it all works together quite nicely. Can't wait to see what a couple years downstairs is going to do to this monster of a beer!"
"I'd love to get my hands on some of the earliest batches to see if/how it has mellowed."
"Dark amber color with nice head. Very pleasant sweet nut nose. Lots of fruit and sweet malt flavors and characteristics with good hop balance and nice mouth feel. Big flavors with a long hop finish. Appealing carmel/coffee flavors in the finish. Nice big beer."
"When I poured this into the glass I noticed that it looked light but as soon as I was done pouring and looked at the glass I was amazed and how deep the color was. It poured black with brilliant mahogany edges with a long lasting moderate tan head. The aroma has a lot of smoke, a touch of booze and a bit of dried fruit and tobacco. The flavor has quite a bit of smoke, some chocolate and leather. Its a bit hot in the finish. Definitely a robust beer. Very unique beer and well done."
"The beer pours a cloudy dark brown color with a thick frothy offwhite/tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is near perfect! It has a warm, roasted malt scent that screams of figs and charred caramel malts. It's rich and fruity. The taste is good. It has a rich, roasted and smoke malt flavor. I'm sure the smoke comes from extended boiling and caramelized sugar. Whatever, It's amazing. It goes down smooth and finishes warm with some subtle chocolate notes. The mouthfeel is great. It is a full bodied beer with perfect carbonation. This is a real treat. It's one of the best old ales out there."
"Aroma is very nice, chocolate, dark fruits, oak and leather. Flavor is nice and complex, a lot of fig, chocolate, smokiness character, brown sugar and some whiskey like notes. A very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, a slow sipper in my opinion."
"This beer is a bit heavy, and definitely coats the tongue. I could drink 2 of these but I would need a water break afterwords. This is an amazing beer, and when I'm in the right mood, one of my favorites."
"Overall, I am in love. This is an outstanding beer. Unbelievably outstanding!!!"
"Spectacular beer."
"D - At 10%, I couldn't have more than one, but that one is magnificent so I would call it great!"
"nutty, nutella, brownie batter,"
"The mouthfeel: thick and hearty, but unfortunately not very smooth. All in all, I give it an A-. Like an incredibly intense Imperial IPA, this beer would not invite more than two servings per drinking session. But for all its combination of sweet, heat, and earthiness, it does invite repeated returns. I long for another."
"This is a tasty beer, and I will keep it in mind the next time I want to sit around and concentrate on enjoying a complex brew."
"Batch 72 12 oz bottle poured into a Rochefort chalice. The dark brown beer forms a pillowy 3 finger light brown head. Nice head retention and some spotty lacing on the glass. Beer smells of molasses, chocolate, and coca cola. Taste is dark chocolate, expresso, and a cola sweetness with dark chocolate bite of bittnerness and a warm alcohol burn. Beer is appropriately carbonated lightly and is a sipper. Needed the beer to be a bit more balanced to make it a 5, but overall, an extremely worthy effort for this style."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied with a small amount of carbonation."
"For a ten percenter, this is dangerously drinkable. Some age would almost certainly mellow the burn and make this even better."
"D: Not sure how many of these I could drink in a night but I'd sure love to find out. This is a very nice complex beer. I hope to get more of this soon!"
"D: This is a very unique and dangerously delicious beer which makes it one of those that is drinkable while you are drinking. However, not one that you could indulge in on a regular basis (at least I couldn't). Still a very amazing beer that is well worth your time. Hollenthon helps to add to the experience."
"D - Damn is this stuff good, though I do wish there was at least a little bit of carbonation to speak of. The beer is wonderfully complex and rich in flavor."
"A unique and stellar beer. This will definately be a staple in my cellar for years to come."
"Pours a coca-cola brownish black. Off-white to tan head. Smell is of the dark fruit variety, hint of roastiness way down deep in there. Taste is of dark malts and fruit, just that touch of roastiness, and a slight resinous hoppiness in the finish that clings to the palate. Body is a heavy-medium. Alcohol didn't seem too apparent."
"Overall this is one of the most interesting beers I've ever had. The flavors are such that they all allow room for each other, and there's a whole lot going on. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours an opaque brown. Thick lighter tan head. Nose is chalky malts. Tar is quietly there and you really have to pull for it. Smoked caramelized sugars. Flavor is quite smokey. Clearly, this is much like a rauchbier. Not to sound like a grade A jerk about it, but damn. I get smoked ham tones, charcoal edges, but a brown sugar thing mixed in. Feel has a smooth carbonation and a slick liquid. Extremely good and extremely unique. To me this comes off as a Belgian rauchbier. Extremely unique. I definitely suggest the beer geeks try this one. IMO an unparalleled beer. A must try."
"A very tasty beer, this hits the spot after a dinner of apple-braised pork chops. Not so much a session beer, but it makes a great dessert or nightcap. If this were just a little bit cheaper, I'd be buying this regularly. Even so, I think I'll grab another bottle or two and lay them down to see how they age. Good stuff!"
"Overall a good brew but it wasn't that special to me. I would have it on tap if I saw it but I don't think I will buy it again unless I get one of the beers mixed up since they are all named with a first name and thats a little hard to keep track of and not mix up."
"Overall impression: Incredible beer, my absolute favorite brew. Get some for now, but save some of this bottle conditioned elixir for later, too. Have a little patience and you'll be rewarded with something special."
"Pours a dark brown with garnet highlights when held to light, huge bubbly tan head takes forever to dissipate and sticks itself all over my glass. Smells a bit sweet with aromas of peat malt, dark dried fruits, licorice, a bit of alcohol, maybe even some whiskey. Taste is at first very smokey then lots of dried fruits, sweet malts and a bit of alcohol, some vanilla in the finish. Very complex, very tasty. Body is thick, carbonation is high, mouthfeel is sweet and sticky with a bit of alcohol. Great brew! Very complex and drinkable smell and taste. This brewery is slowly becoming one of my favorites."
"I want more!!!"
"D: Pretty damn drinkable for as huge as it is. Alcohol isn't too much and it's very smooth."
"D: Alcohol bite is very subdues. At 10% ABV, it'd be easy to get carried away with this beer."
"Good brew with complex flavors."
"Highly Recommended!!"
"I could drink this all day, if it had a year on it."
"Poured this into a snifter and it presented an extremely dark brown to black head with red hues. Offered a thick, pillowy head receeding rather slowly and leaving sticky lacing. Smells of smoke, with bourbon barrel-esque tones and a malty/toffee/alcohol finish. Taste is a conplex compilation of woody and dusty (in a good way)notes, malty, smokey, some sweetness and a blue cheese like finish. It hits the palate in the same away a great blue cheese wouuld. This is a great blue cheese brew. The body is thick and full with just enough carbonation. Awesome!"
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with a very good drinkability despite the high alcohol content. Fantastic beer."
"Drinkability: Not so good for a hot day. It's a very tasty brew but even after only drinking half a bottle I'm already a bit overwhelmed by the fruity notes. Would make a nice desert beer on a cold day. Now that I revisit this beer and I'm drinking it out of a pint glass rather than a snifter, I see a marked improvement in drinkability. Originally had this at a 3.5 but its cold out now and the pint glass doesn't amplify the fruitiness as much as the snifter."
"Drinkability: Mouthfeel definitely helps out the drinkability for this one, but I personally like other old ales better. Alcohol is a bit too strong and astringent in this one. Still good, but I'd rather have an Old Stock."
"Aroma is hops and ripe fruits. Taste is very sweet, roasted malts, raisins and dark fruits, hints of dark chocolate. Some well balanced hops, and a well hidden 10%. It's already halfway gone. Very drinkable, and an excellent desert beer, as the label suggests."
"D - Nice and complex but will have to re review a different batch that is actually carbonated."
"Highly reccomend checking this beer out if you see it."
"D: A great beer. Unlike others. I would love to pair this with a nice rustic dish or a mushroom risotto. Wonderful!"
"D: I'll say right off the bat that this would probably benefit by sitting a while. I've had this one for at least a couple months and it's still pretty raw. That being said, it's a got a solid flavor with a lot of interesting things going on. Big alcohol on this one means that 12 ounces is more than enough for one person. I don't have much to compare this too stylistically, but it's certainly an enjoyable drink. I will definitely have to buy some more and let it sit a while to really get a good idea of what this beer is all about, though."
"For 10%ABV this is ridiculously drinkable. Balanced, tasty and complex. This is something I would pair with a dessert for sure. Overall a great beer that I will seek out again, I'm very curious to try aging this. I could see it going multiple years and still improving."
"The beer pours dark brown, almost black with an amazing thick frothy tan head that seemed to grade from small bubbles at the bottom to larger ones on top before you start drinking it. It leaves a very nice lace, and the head is very long lived. I haven't seen many nicer looking beers. It has a rich malty aroma that is smokey, a little fruity, musty and robust. Big, delicious malt flavor transitions to an almosty perfumey bitter aftertaste that has a good heat but is not distracting. Warm, thick mouthfeel that is full bodied, very smooth, and has an alcoholic finish. This is a rare beer that I think is worth what they are charging for 12 oz. bottles. I have had mixed luck with their Fred, but I am very excited about Adam."
"D - The higher abv is felt, but doesn't detract too much."
"Very dark brown with a beige head that had very good retention and lacing. Smell of caramel, dark fruit, earthy hops, smoke, and also some medicinal notes. Taste is smokey, caramel, and very medicinal. There also seems to be some sweet cherries in the taste, but most of it is medicinal. Medium carbonation and light to medium body. I'd like to try this again from a different batch to get a better idea of the beer."
" First taste opens a mass of doors, from molases and dark fruits to a little dirt and oak. Hard to tell what they were hoping for but it is anything but simple. Hair of the Dog fits quite well. Definately a sipper, even when splitting a bottle."
"This is quite drinkable and I wish I had access to many more."
"Pours a thick black hue, no head. Subtle tabbaco and chocolate aromas, very subtle burst of liquor aromas as well. The combined aromas almost reminds me of a strong mousse cake. Thick n syrupy mouthfeel. Notes of English Barley Wine flavors cut through the thick elixir. This drink is very malty, but in a great way. Cloves, some hops, something herbal... DELICIOUS! I wish I had a case of this beer in my cellar, make that several cases."
"I had a bottle from batch 72."
"Batch 69 and shared with pghlee. Poured dark brown with a creamy finger of nougat snickers head. Molasses, licorice with a touch of smoke on the aroma. Nip of carbonation sting on the tongue @ first, which gradually vanished. Very bright middle flavors of sweet molasses with a hint of chocolate. 10% alcohol felt in back of throat, but very balanced for such a complex, unique brew."
"Big body with good complimentary carbonation and a boat load of alcohol...very drinkable if you love this style and can handle the punch. This is a great brew."
"Awesome."
"Batch 54, magnum. Poured dark, opaque mahogany with a small tan head. Aroma was smoke, malt, and chocolate. The taste was strongly alcoholic, with mocha, toasted malt and finished with an alcohol bite. Some peat and a nice resiny base. A big, earthy beer with a sweet side."
"Black pour in my large snifter with a big rocky layered head that starts out cream colored and darkens to brown. Really interesting looking brew. Does not disappoint. Roast malt and surprising piney hop aromas. A little hop/coffee bit at the very front, mellows quickly. Lively mouthfeel, almost creamy at the same time. Foamy head barely recedes enough to not give you a mustache, but never completely goes away and grips the side of the glass. Roastiness really comes out in the middle and finish. Notes of mocha, raisin and booze. Not overly warming with alcohol for 10%. Clean but lingering finish. Was expecting alot waiting for this to ship to the east coast, appears it was worth the wait. Have a 2nd bottle that I will be curious to see how it ages. For the style, probably the best I've had."
"Drinkability was good. I finished a 12 oz. bottle craving more."
"World class beer, a must seek. This could beat out Westvleteren 12 any day."
"D - I enjoyed this brew, but I think the sweetness is a bit too much for me. This is a one and I'm done for me."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, this is batch 70. The appearance is a near opaque dark brown with a red glow when held to a light. The head is generous, clumpy and has good retention. The aroma (which is quite strong) mostly consists of dark fruits; raisins, dates, plums and figs. This bouquet has a Belgian quad type of personality. The flavor absolutely follows the nose, all the dark fruits are there plus a touch of light molasses and some well balanced biter walnuts. The mouthfeel is thick, smooth and creamy. The finish is long with lingering raisins. As for Drinkability--this one begs to be sipped and savored. Very nice brew. One of my favorites."
"A great show of American creativity. A work of art! Wonderfully made - complex, big and bold, yet drinkable. An enjoyable brew, to say the least!"
"The alcohol is hidden well in the rich complex flavors, but drink this one slowly otherwise it will bite you quickly."
"4.0/5"
"Drinks like a 10% abv, old ale, nice, but lethal! Taking the chill off this cold November evening nicely!"
"D: This beer is absolutely drinkable for the ABV. I find it to go down incredibly easy. The diversity of the flavor profile which is ever changing just makes you want to drink more and further explore this brew. This beer is quite good and I very happy I had the chance to drink it. THANKS MATHEW!"
"I'm quickly becoming a fan of H.O.T.D."
"I could drink this for hours and pick out so many nuances that I could write about it pages on end, but I am satisfied with this one great experience. Will seek it out again"
"Overall: This beer is good. It is definately not a bad bottle, like the head led me to believe. I would drink it again."
"Sweet chewy caramel and roasty. Has some scottish ale elements, a smokey/peat flavor and a complex malt bill. Alcohol is strong but smooth, very nice! Certainly one of these will do it for anyone...its just a great big beer with classic old ale flavors."
"not quite an old ale, not quite a barleywine. tasty but most likely better aged to let that hop note fade out. glad to have tried this though."
"Pours a dark murky brown with a half finger khaki colored head that dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Some spotty lacing left behind on the sides of the glass, you can tell this is a thick ass beer. Smell is extremely rich with sharp alcohol, molasses, and raisins. Some leather and tobacco with a touch of oak and dates as well. Very powerful aroma, one that sticks in the nostrils a good while. Taste begins with big smokey malts and wet leather. Midway the dry figs and gritty dirt hop flavors emerge on the tongue. The booze and bitterness lingers in the sweet malty aftertaste and warms the back of the throat. Smooth, rich, hearty mouthfeel with a full body and a light prickly carbonation sting. Yeah this is a beast of a beer, but with the name what would you expect! Sip and enjoy all the complexities this beer has to offer. I'm not much of a cigar guy, but I would imagine this beer would pair perfect with one."
"d. Wow. Amazingly complex, almost overwhelmingly so. Definitely a slow sipper, but a beautiful one at that. Definitely worth experiencing. The alcohol is borderline-harsh at the moment... I'd imagine that this one would age beautifully... if I can ever purchase one and not be compelled to drink it."
"Notes: This is the first beer to challenge my tastebuds in a long time. I've had this bottle quite a few months, and to imagine it aged for a few years is something I can dream of. I WILL go out of my way to get more of this."
"D: I love it, but one and done for me."
"I will probably re-review this in a year or so. BATCH 71 NEEDS TO AGE ANOTHER YEAR!!!"
"Carbonation is light and the feel is smooth. Medium bodied. A fine sipper and nightcap."
"Picked up a bottle of this and the Fred at Belmont Station in Portland, Or. Manily drank it staright from the bottle, but did pour a little out into a pint glass to see the color. Was darken then I expected more of a dark amber almost violet. The taste is very complex and interesting."
"pours a chocolate color with a nice big, tan head. the nose is dark molasses, caramel, subtle cherries, roasted malts. Wow! the taste! subtle cherries, great multiple hops, leather, dark chocolate, coffee. full bodied! intense! very smoothe! Deelish!"
"Note: This beer is something from a post-apocalyptic movie where most of the world was wiped out, but one crazy brewer survived and somehow managed to make some intense, fantastic beer out of anything he could find. I'd say, if you can get it, start collecting vintages because every bottle is different."
"Overall: worth a try"
"i would drink this beer 8 days a week. i cant wait to try some more from hair of the dog."
"Thanks Dansting. 12oz. bottle, Batch 71. Bottle conditioned. Served in a snifter. Poured a deep amber/brown with little carbonation. Huge malty aroma. Lots of molasses, raisiny fruit, and some hops, along with a little alcohol. Full bodied with a fantastic malt complexity. More molasses. Rich mouthfeel. Long dry finish with some hop bitterness. Tasty."
"Drinkability: A malt bomb, and not a bad one at that. Gotta be in the time and place for it (the abv% is dangerously high, and it is crazy sweet), but overall it's very nicely made. Recommended, but in moderation!"
"Mouthfeel is sticky, kind of thick and syrupy. Overall, it's one of the most interesting and complex beers I've had. It's like a chocolatey, smoky barleywine. I'm only giving drinkability a 3.0 due to the high alcohol content and the strong, intense flavors and smokiness. Definitely couldn't have more than one bottle, but I'm very glad I got to try this one."
"12oz bottle shared with wagenvolks, my share poured into a Corsendonk tulip. Pours a nice dark brown with a massive head that eventually diminishes to a thin layer and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is rich caramel and chocolate malts and a hint of smoke. The taste is somewhat reminiscent of an easy drinking Barley Wine with a bit of chocolate added, some dried fruit presence as well. This is certainly one that only gets better as it warms. The beer is slightly on the heavy side, but the alcohol is somewhat hidden. This is certainly a wonderful beer that I would love to try again."
"The flavor brings notes of choclate syrup as well, moreso than the other offerings I've tried from Hair of the Dog (i.e. Fred, Doggie Claws), which seem to be heavy on the caramel notes. Musky, resinous hops and chewy, dank raisins balance the choco-malt presence well, while a heated, boozy finish warms the back of the throat. Although the alcohol is masked quite well, the heat is certainly noticable. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a spot-on carbonation level and a nice finish that leaves me wanting more. All in all, Adam is another exceptional brew that continues to elevate Hair of the Dog among my ranks as ""favorite US craft brewery"". Highly recommended."
"I eagerly want more of this beer and the others from these guys, whatever way possible. Hell, I might be moving to Portland soon."
"The drinkability is very good but a 10% just sip. Prosit, MK"
"Dark, with no light passing through, save for some reddish highlights around the edges. Almost zero head. This is one serious-looking beer. The smell is RICH: fig, subtle smoke, very slight coffee and burned aromas and some very subtle sweet notes. Flavor is... wow.... intense. The bottle says ""leather."" And it's correct! Earthy. Fig. Bold. Heavy. Flavors unfold slowly in the mouth. There is a nice slight alcohol warming that shows up at the end. So nice to drink, but I'd better stop at one! This would be great on one of these crappy Portland January nights."
"D: very nice brew. only one for me but wow!!"
"This is definitely a sipper. Good nitecap."
"Drinkability - an interesting brew, but not one of my favorites. Some interesting flavors, I'm just not that high on them. Thanks to udubdawg for getting me one of these at DLD08."
"I originally got this beer in a BIF. Ive been looking to trade for them, but I think the price is a bit high. I might try to find some on the cheap any way possible."
"Nice dark mahogany color with a tan head, The nose had some nice sweet malts along with bitter english hops. The taste had large amount of fruits, candy, and residual malt sugars balanced by floral hops. A thick body goes down well. Quite a delicious brew."
"such a powerful and smooth first few sips ... intensely flavourful with dark cherry, dark chocolate, some smokey leather, piney ... very good stuff, ...LS .... had after a particularly annoying day at work and the aggressive hops melted the annoyance away.. recommended!"
"This is a great beer, it has great malt complexity without being muddy, a good hop kick, and some very nice fermentation characteristics (alcohol, esters, etc.)"
"Hair of the Dog has brewed yet another great beer, this would only get better with age too, this aged version on wood is probably incredible, glad this beer is now available near me at Beverage Warehouse, will be drinking more of this stuff in the future, recommended"
"d: Big thanks to JohnGalt1 for the fantastic extra. I need to try more Hair of the Dog."
"also highly drinkable fro the alcohol, I find this beer inoffensive yet striking. I have to say that I absolutely love this beer. It's so yummy, so smooth. It's right up there with some well aged Old Stock."
"D- Easy to drink, which might be a bad thing since its got such a high abv."
"A sipper that gets better as it warms. Just like other Hair of the Dog offerings, this is a winner in my book. I feel lucky to have spotted this in CO, I only wish I could find more."
"ABV is high, but I can think of plenty of occasions that this would be my go to beer to sip on if I could get more of it."
"Adam's a damn good beer. It has a unique, natural flavor that's really going to stick with me. The only improvement this beer could really stand would be a slight relaxing of the carbonation. It's not a huge complaint, but it's a tad high. Otherwise, this is an impressive beer. Recommended."
"Drinkability is moderate. High alcohol and heavy flavors limit consumption, but everything is right about this beer making it very easy to consume."
"Really unique beer all around. A lot smokier than I expected, and quite port-like. I honestly would have guessed this was oak-aged. A great nightcap sipper."
"D : This is one that has to be tried. I plan on getting plenty more of this and trying it again and again."
"This is not the best offering from HotD."
"I still have half a bottle... and it is going to take me a while to finish it.. not because it is bad .. but because.. My mind and palate need more time come to terms with all the complex nuances in this one... I REALLY wish HotD was still available in Boise... I have a few labels from (my guess) back in '03-'-04 maybe earlier.. and then the supply dried up... now I have to beg friends to pick them up for me when they go to Oregon... Sam is that friend... much appreciated."
"Pours a clear opaque darkness with a full finger light tan head that fades slowly. Spotty patterns of lacing generated. The smell is an aggressive fig & currant dark fruit medley. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is equally rich and full bodied. Full flavored, the berry currant taste is assertive and the mild chocolate and smoky characteristic lingers significantly. A bit of a sipper, the 10% ABV is present in the mouth and amplified by the sharp tart characteristic of the currant. Scoring points for imagination and passion. There are some serious ingredients involved with this one. Recommend giving this one a spin around the block."
"It still drinks flat, but it's not a bad thing. Very hard for me to describe as I know I need another sample seeing as some reviews are similar to mine, but many more describe something different. I need more."
"I was going to say that Adam is my favorite HOTD beer when I glanced at my reviews for the others. Fred, Rose Cassis and Blue Dot Imperial IPA scored almost this high. These guys should be commended for pushing the boundaries of what constitutes outstanding craft beer and for delivering incredibly delicious, infinitely cellarable ale much more often that not. Do yourself a favor and buy Adam by the case whenever you run across it. I know I will."
"D: Overall, this is a tasty brew akin to an fruity imperial stout. It's somewhat boozy so you are aware of the 10%ABV. Wouldn't really want to drink more than one of these in a setting."
"D- great beer, with unique flavors but couldn't drink more than one at a time."
"D-A good desset wine but not my style."
"Pours a thick dark black with ruby around the edges. Nearly impenetrable. a vigorous pour produces a small head, but it retains well. Nose is of dark fruit, raisin, fig, rum, alcohol. Taste follows with dark fruit and rum soaked raisin or plum. Slight cherry. Some leathery taste with a little bit of boggy smoke. Alcohol is very apparent on the finish, and hops are much more noticeable on the finish than one would expect. Alcohol soaked dark malt and fruit remains on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thin side for the style, but still quite viscous. Drinkability is excellent for the style and the abv. Overall a great brew from HOTD, would love to try it from the wood, even though this one almost tastes like it already is! Seems to be an excellent cellar candidate, for a good couple years. Great beer."
"While dulled with age, this is an incredible beer. Sherry toffee leather, earth honey tobacco and a pleasant oxidation are present.  The Palate is similar and less assertive than younger versions. More oxidation with sherry Earth and tobacco. Very nice 4.5/4/4.5"
"D: Wow, I'm not sure I could have more than a couple of these in a week or so. Massive beer all the way around and the sensory assault just slightly takes away from the drinkability. Despite that, I will actively seek out other HoD brews after this baptism by fire."
"Sippability is great wouldn't mind having a few of these for special occasions"
"D. Way far from a session beer. Pairing it with food may not be such a great idea as it stands so well on it's own. Maybe keep the food pairing somewhat hearty but neutral (German) in terms of spice. A cigar would probably be ideal."
"Purchased at South Bay Liquor. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Dark with a thick off-white head that sticks around. Aroma of plum, berries, malt, and a touch of smoke and hops. Tastes of sweet malt, smoke, berries, and a slight amount of alcohol. Aftertaste is bittersweet. Medium-bodied. Probably couldn't drink a lot of these, but one is very nice."
"Overall: A damned delicious beer. I love HOTD, and this is no exception. It's an outstanding, careful, exciting, innovative, interesting beer that is intensely drinkable. $4.50 for a 12 ounce bottle is steep, but I'd pay it again and again."
"D - Can't do more than one."
"Notes - Excellent; really unique and interesting stuff."
"Some warming alcohol, but hidden rather well overall. Full body. Such a complex treat. I could sit and sniff this all day. Very enjoyable."
"Even so, a very good beer, in fact, one of the better beers out there."
"Pours with a dark brown body and a very nice creamy and beige head. There are fine lacing too. Nose primary of hops and malt. Sweet flavour of burned malt, dried fruit, raisins, mild coffee and liquorice. Ends up more dry with some alcohol. A very enjoyable brew."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. I nursed this thing for over an hour and it was sad to see it go. A bit pricey for bottles from this brewery, but totally worth it. Will be seeking out their other ales for sure."
"This is a beer I can't stop talking about, and am recommending to everyone. Go get one."
"D- This one is a nice beer to sip on. I think I would give it at least a year or two in the future. Seems like an old ale and a stout mixed to me but what do I know."
"Overall: Pretty good brew with lots of smoke. I had Fred recently which I liked a bit better. This is a rather tasty beer though. I have one to share with BeerTruth, and the other to age for a bit. I look forward to seeing what a little age may do to this one."
"Bottle courtesy of msubulldog25, batch #67. Dark brown almost black color with a khaki head. It has a smell like chocolates. It tastes like leather with some tobacco, then chocolate, some faint phenolic band-aid flavor which thank fully completely faded as teh beer warmed. This was good stuff and I was glad to get the chance to try it again as these are no longer distributed to CO."
"Pours a dark brown with a reddish hue. A nice frothy head sits atop. Smell is absolutely wonderful. The smell consists of dark fruits and yeast. Taste is the same with some astringent coffee notes. There are some port like qualities present as well. This is a magnificent beer. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. There is a bit too much carbonation/acidity that holds this one back a little. Easily my favorite HotD beer I've had yet."
"Drinkability is moderately high, this presents as a nicely sweetened version of a rauchbier with a bit more fruit and syrupy essence, this too would be amazing with smoked meats and bbq, definitely a must try from Portland. . ."
"Drinkability: I would love to cellar this beer and see how it changes in time. It's an excellent night-cap, but the sweetness and alcohol make it hard to drink. I could, however, have about 3 ounces of this fairly regularly."
"Like all Hair of the Dog beers, I wish I had easier access to Adam. This is a great beer that is very drinkable for the high abv, but 10% is still 10% ."
"Probably one of the best Ole Ales in my short career."
"This is one of my favorite beers. It pours a very dark brown, with a small light brown head. The smell is encredibly complex, with dried fruits, roasted malt, coffee, and molasses all coming through. The taste is even more complex than the smeall. A fantastic beer, and one of my favorites."
"Poured from 12oz bottle from PP bottle shop into a PP pint glass. Poured a dark brown color bordering on black with a thick light tan head. Smell is of dark fruit, sweet malt, and a hint of smoke. Taste is coco with figs with a leathery smoke finish. Mouthfeel is full body with creamy carbonation feel on the tongue. While a 10% abv makes this far from a session beer its alcohol is well masked by the bold flavors."
"It's a beautiful beer. I hold it up to the light (and my kids hold up their milk) and no light shines through. Nice thick and creamy dark head with good lasting power. Smells malty and creamy and caramel and bandaids. Tastes malty and thick and creamy and sweet and fruit and caramel and (faintly) bandaids. Big in the mouth and I couldn't drink another of these if you paid me to."
"The 10% is very warm in this beer. I couldnt drink more than 1 of these as it is very complex, over the top. I think 2-4 years in the cellar will make this a top 5 barleywine, i need to find some to cellar now!"
"This beer poured a deep, dark brown with a huge, frothy tan head. The aroma was of smoke and figs. The taste was of chocolate and smoked malts and alcohol. Overall mouthfeel was heavy body with medium to high carbonation. this beer was overall a great beer. A nice beer to just sit, relax and sip."
"IMO, a bit jumbled right now. Would likely benefit from at least a year, likely five, of age in a good cellar. Rich umami flavor characterstics."
"Smooth creamy carbonation, but it can turn a bit watery. Utterly drinkable."
"12oz glass enjoyed at Redbones in Somerville, MA - along with some good BBQ. Pours black, with no head. The aroma is smoky with some hops, but overall not that strong. The taste is a lovely, rich and deep. Tastes more like an typical imperial stout to me - although I haven't had all that many, I must say. Nice balance of malt and hops."
"Dark brown, nice compact head retained exceptionally well, almost as if this was right off the tap or cask. Odor of smokey prunes, hickory chocolate beer. Flavor is so, so great. chewy wood and truffles with campfire smoke. Strong hops mix balance the high alcohol well. Sticky and bordering on syrupy. A fantastic example of the style and the second of two HotD beers i've tried that I've also loved. REALLY glad I got this and that i have another Fred at home to drink some day soon."
"Colonel Mustard drank this beer, in a pint glass, in the living room."
"Got a bottle of batch 68 from New Beer in NYC for 4.25. The color was really interesting - very dark, but not black as a stout. More like a very dark red. you could see a brighter red tint in the light, kind of like wine. nice head that remained for a while. i couldnt get much of a smell for some reason - maybe because i was in an indian restaurant when i cracked it open. this was my first old ale and it was nothing like anything ive had before. the blurb on the bottle was spot on when it said its been compared to figs and leather. craziness..also very raisony, and some smokiness and bitter coffee beans. as complex as it was, these flavors did not all seem to mix seemlessly. it exploded in my mouth but caused some damage. shared a bottle with a nice girl and it was very hard to finish for both of us but this was probably because we had just ate a huge meal and a bottle of southampton grand cru. nevertheless i still couldnt see this one going down easy. my bottom line for this beer is that it desparately needs some age. i know HOTD does that anyway to their brews, but this one especially needs to sit in the corner and think things over for a long time. If you own or are soon going to purchase batch 68 of Adam please do yourself and the beer a favor and let it age for at least another year or two."
"It is a sipper and it is not for people that do not enjoy complex beer."
"The question now is, why did I always pass these up when I see them in beer stores outside of town? I have finally found a beer that can easily compete with Old Stock as far as a top notch Old Ale."
"Wow, that is about all I can say about this one. This was one of the best beers I have ever had, hands down. I dont even know where to begin on this one. Lets just start from the top. Poured a very deep dark brown with a big three finger plus head of tan lace and just a really full overall look. This was really nice looking with tons of residual side glass lace and a sticky foam top that would not quit. The aroma was wonderful, full of sweet smells of caramel, sugar, chocolate and nuts, with a nice hop essence in the back. I am not sure what the style of this is, but the flavor was robust and full. Very nutty with a decidedly caramelesque sugar to it and a really great fresh, and dry hop like finish. There were hints of chocolate and coffee throughout, but not enough to make it rely totally on those. Such a very full bodied feel, very creamy and rich. This was a magnificent bottle and one that I was really glad I got to try. It really was different than almost anything I had had before and I look forward to one day getting another to compare. And for reference this was batch number 68, and it was fantastic!"
"d: A sipping beer, but much more drinkable than most beers with this kind of flavor and abv. It has a great complex flavor and would obviously be great for aging. Will definitely try to get my hands on another."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth, but this beer sure is a sipper."
"Overall, a very fine beer. It tastes a little like a super-charged Hibernation, but with more burnt tar and anise (which come out more as it warms). I liked it better colder."
"D - Complex, interesting, Don't want another one tonight, but tomarrow... and the next day..."
"12 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Strong tan head, not too thick and creamy, but great head retention and pretty serious lacing. Color is a cola brown/black. Smell is peculiar and somewhat hard to describe. Its sweet, with licorice, i suspect probably really brewed with a decent amount of brewing licorice. Its hard to pick up the malts behind it but probably an amber base with a bit of black and or peated malt. Taste isnt thin, slightly bitter with a malty peculiar finish. Its quite enjoyable. I'm not familiar with many other examples of the old ale style, but this is enjoyable and one to revisit. I suspect a bit of aging would significantly improve this offering and mellow the bitter bite and smooth out the smoke."
"'04 Vintage. Picked this up at Belmont Station in '05. Really thick half inch head, light-brown, mostly lasting, almost black. Mmild coffee aroma, dough, raisin, plum, cherry and red wine. Extremely long finish. Quite thick - really coats the tongue. really outstanding!!"
"Man this is a fine beer. Much more raisin and dried berry in the flavor. Big black mission fig and a nice alcohol burn in the chest but not noticeable in the mouth. Layers of sweet chocolate and brown sugar with a thick visceral mollassesy mouthfeel. Blue berry and more milk chocolate with some hop bitterness to balance the long drawn out, candied nut finish. Just a sipper and so big and complex may be hard to sip many but if need be I could drink this daily and multiple times daily as well. Great beer."
"D - Complex and tasty. A great sipper."
"I know, I know. I live in Portland. Hair Of The Dog is brewed in Portland. But this was my first time trying Adam. I went into this with no knowledge of it's style and without reading the label or any reviews. I poured it from 12 oz. bottle into my snifter. It was a beautiful opaque reddish black with an astounding 3 finger pillowy latte cream crown with great retention, thick lacing, and a really nice nose of honey, roasted grains, and some hoppy florals in back. Coffee with cream came up as it warmed. I realized I was in barley-wine territory right off. Big roasted malts with alcohol where first registered, then dark fruit, subtle molasses, and some not-so-subtle bittering on the finish. It's a big beer. Not really my style (I picked it up with a Rogues Dead Guy Ale) but well crafted and interesting. I will try it again."
"Drinkability: Great. I would love some more to lay down for the future. Superb taste and sweetness would make this beer enjoyable for non-beer lovers. Pick this one up."
"D - another nice brew from Hair of the Dog, a good sipper."
"Drinkability- There is a lot of flavor in this beer but it is balanced nicely. After my first sip I was surprised to how smooth and unobtrusive this beer is yet it still is so full of flavor. By far the best Old Ale Ive ever had. Great beer!"
"Pours a muddy dark plumb color with a huge immovable head and oversized lacing. Smells of fig, dried fruit, plumb, dark caramel. Tastes of malt, some dark jam, wonderful hops and flavors my palate cant describe. Tasty and unique. Thick in the mouth with a lively carbonation on the tongue. ABV is well hidden in the taste but the warmth cant hide and shouldnt. Shes a sipper for sure. Hair of the Dog will put hair on your chest. A delicious and complex brew that must be tried."
"D: Incredibly drinkable for its heft, I couldn't get enough of it, I can now believe the tale that this style of beer knocked out the Prussian king Frederick the Great out for 24 hours, a masterpiece of brewing."
"A thick, velvety body borne about fine conditioning make this a pleasant sipper. A very unique and distinctive ale which defies the standard syrupy sweetness which would be expected of a beer this strength. Cant say it was my favorite as I prefer more hop presence, but was an enjoyable diversion nonetheless."
"This beer is a monster, plain and simple. Loads of flavor and complexity, it certainly lives up to the billing. The sweetness is a bit prohibitive in it's drinkability, and caused me to sip this as slowly as I have ever consumed any beer. I would certainly like to have this again, but it will require a particular mood and a big block of time."
"A truly delicious beer."
"My example was aged 1 year. Pours Black with ruby highlights. Huge khaki head with very good retention and lacing. Even after the aging, there are big smells of alcohol. Other aromas include bandaids, coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit. Quite powerful. The taste also packs a punch, with flavors of coffee, bitter chocolate, bitter orange, gentian, and something elusive that is slightly sour and fruity- maybe raspberries and cream? The mouthfeel is substantial and mouthcoating. This beer is huge and intense, and with its unusual flavor profiles is quite an interesting drink. Very, very good, and a powerful brew indeed."
"Heavy on the palate with silky smooth finish. Pretty damn drinkable for being such a huge beer. Recommended."
"OK, just gets more acidic. There's a cloying sweetness under the bitterness that makes it a little less drinkable. One is fine for dessert."
"D: This is a great sipping/desert beer. It would be great in front of a campfire."
"Aroma of a classic ale, fruity and a little musty. Coffee-brown color. This is a wonderfully intense ale, almost a hybrid of a good hearty dark ale and a porter or stout. A base of coffee-tinged malt flavors has overtones of fruitiness, plus more complex things I cant identify -- maybe some roasty molasses. It has a bittersweet finish, with a late dryness on the tongue. The mouthfeel is smooth, almost milky. Because its bottle-conditioned, there were particles visible even in the murk, and a noticeable residue on the bottom of the glass -- but thats not necessarily a bad thing. Highly recommended."
"The aroma is only a small hint at what's to come. Yeasty, fruity, smoky, and alcoholy. Holy, indeed. It just smells like the Adam to me. Did I mention I love this beer? The taste is a beautiful balance of smoke, fig, alcohol, chocolate, yeast, coffee, hops, and whatever else is in there that's combining to create perhaps the most unique overall flavor I've tasted in a beer. Maybe I should try some more Old Ale's though. I love how it reminds of a RIS, but it's just got so much more going on. I love the flavor presence of the yeast and the fruits. I don't think there's anything I'd change about this beer. The mouthfeel is very creamy, yet balanced perfectly by the carbonation. Like a root beer float. Hmm. Now that's an idea! The sweetness in this beer is in perfect harmony with the bitterness that the hops and chocolate/coffee flavors provide. Three words summarize my thoughts on this beer. Amazing, unique, and balanced. Highly recommended."
"Overall, an interesting sipping beer. Can't drink many. Lots of flavor and very rich. Certainly worth a try since it is unusual, but not something I would get too excited about. Perhaps some aging will help."
"Cheers!"
"Pretty darn good."
"D: In a world of copy cat beers, this one stands alone. Not only is there no other beer on the market like it, theres nothing even close. It contains explosive flavor that defies categorization. Superb."
"D: Such a complex range of flavors, 10% abv, yet almost no noticable alcohol presence puts the drinkability at near perfect levels. This is an excellent beer that I'd love to try on draft someday."
"D: At 10% I could easily have another but no more than that. A bomber of this stuff would be perfect. Great beer."
"* Edit: for the record Batch 67 was reviewed."
"Recommended."
"Pours a very nice medium amber with lots of sediment and half finger head which sticks around for a bit. Aroma is cotton candy, brown sugar and malts. Taste is red grapes, lightly toasted dark malts, dark chocolate, and mild smokiness. Alcohol comes out on the finish which hurts drinkability. Perfect winter brew, wish this one was available locally."
"Pours dark ruby red with a light nut-brown head, thick and lacy. Aroma of dark chocolate, cascade hops. Taste was huge raisiny-malt with chocolate and slightly burnt finish, iron-like. Mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy. This is a good beer, better to split though, one is almost more than enough."
"Pours crazy violent, huge brown head forms, starts to disappear, leaves behind a lot of lace, clear very dark crimson/brown, very nice. Smell is sweet, toffee, grainy, citrus and floral, lot of yeast, bit of alcohol, burnt fruits, smell I can't place, kind of interesting. Taste is crazy, deep chocolate and toffee, very caramelized, rich, some dark fruits, neat smokiness/licorice character, alcohol is nicely hidden, very tasty. Mouthfeel is full bodied with very high carbonation. These batches have strange carbonation, gotta let it sit for a while in order to drink it. But very nice."
"Batch# 68 Deep dark brown ale with a monstrous l brown bubbly head. Aroma of prunes, figs, blackberries ,aniseen and liquorice, brandy like alcohol whiffs detetcted. Sweet deeply malted taste, first noticed then a busrst of fruity goodness, followed by strong liquorice notes and even notes of apricot. Very smooth and silky on the palatre, then a nice lingering bitter aftertatse and warming alcohol. An excellent beer. I have no idea why I waited so long for this classic. Great beer"
"The aroma has notes of fermented prunes, spicy piquant notes, smoke, meaty malt character and a phenolic almost plastic like note that is light but perhaps tied up in the smoky aromatics. Somehow I want to describe the aroma as a cross between cherries and beef jerky. The taste is still lightly sweet after all these years. The finish has a nice, smoky pet character to it that even evokes a salty sensation upon the palate. The chewy malt character seems to have lost some body over the years. Actually the smoky peat notes seems to have picked up over the years as the malt backbone has mellowed. This is definitely my favorite of the three 1998 vintage brews. This has aged quite fantastically and is a great argument for sticking a bunch of these in the cellar for long term aging."
"All in all, another masterful offering from Hair of the Dog, with a great name that I'm happy to share as my own! I'd love to grab some more of these to cellar, but holding off on them would be a very difficult test!"
"Drinkability is good despite ABV, but one to take your time with and savor."
"Old ale is my favorite style. Adam is a very different take on the style but still one of my favorites in it's class."
"Interesting, and tasty beer. It was like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale with some Schwarzbier and a dash of imperial stout thrown in. I can say I've never had anything like this before. Very enjoyable, and an interesting take on the style! Recommended!"
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark brown color ale with a super huge foamy head (so much foam coming out of the bottle that I thought the beer was infected) with good retention. Aroma of chocolate and tobacco is interesting and different. Taste is mix between some chocolate malt with some tar, tobacco and probably some smoke. Taste is very complex with quite of few layer appearing as the beer warms up. Carbonation was slightly below average with no alcohol being discernable. I will definitely try to pick-up some more bottles as I would like to age a few."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, syrupy, sugary, slightly astringent, and dry."
"A little ragged after it's long dark wait in my closet, but an interesting experiment in aging. Time to find a fresh one while the aged sample is still fresh in my mind."
"D: The ale is a real treat, having held up well all this time. The dark murky depth of the ale has been accentuated, bringing out a bigger malt body."
"Conclusion- My first brew from Hair of the Dog and I was not let down in the least. I'll be seeking out more of their stuff- whatever I can get my hands on."
"D: Decent and definitely an interesting beer, but it's not one that I would go out of my way to get again. Worth a try."
"The drinkability is low for me, as the flavor was just too rich with the tobacco & leather. Maybe this would be a good beer to sip with a cigar, but it isnt for me. Its tough to rate this too low, as there is certainly a complexity about it. Personal tastes, obviously, heavily influence my lower scores, but ultimately, this is a unique brew that smokey beer lovers should try."
"drinkability is very good, higher than i expected. really enjoying this one and look forward to trying this with a little age on it. my first taste made me immediately think of a porter, but subsequently it's coming through less prominently. interesting at around 45F, but it really shines as it warms."
"Batch 55. This hairy dog is still throwing up foam like an angry coastline after a storm, and it's been sitting for 4 1/2 years so far. Heavy peaty roast bite with a deep burnt caramel nose and taste. Rich mouth feel, still quite carbonated. Many other American craft brewers should take notes from HOTD on how to brew beers that will age well beyond the typical three year window most seem to lose pizazz after. Just my opinion though. I've never had a decent American craft brew that tasted interesting beyond three years until Adam, and yes I am quite aware of proper cellaring techniques. It's just my opinion - I didn't mean to insult your favorite vintage of Stone Vertical Epic. I've got one more of these batch 55 Adams, and I suppose I ought to hang on to it for another couple years."
"Poured into a chalice a dark brown color, nice carbonation, fizzy tan head, leaves very little lacing afterwards. The nose is of roasted malts, slight hops, alcohol, toffee, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, nice toffee flavor, slight alcohol. Medium body, well rounded brew. Very drinkable for the ABV, a nice offering from HOTD, nice rendition of the style. Highly recommended."
"Incredible beer. I had at on tap at Hair of the Dog while doing the tour and brought a bottle home. The bottle has more smoke that non tap, both are woody with a lot of alcohol in the nose. The 10% ABV is less noticable in the taste but still there. Very ""hearty"" as per the label, leather and figs, and lots of dark fruit. The smoke mellows as it warms, so I think I drank it too cold but was unfortunately in a rush drinking it in the hotel and unable to bring it on the plane. Great lace, strong smoke. Alan Sprints, the brewer, said the style is between an alt and a rauchbier. Brewed in memory of friend and brewer Adam Kerchival. Great beer--go get a bottle."
"M/D- A nice beet to sit and sip....light bubbles and light alcohol...rich and slightly syrupy."
"D- It is a good sipper. Maybe with some age it would of been better. It is still very young and needs time for all the flavors to blend better. Still a very nice beer. Big complex...well everything."
"This is a beefy beer that hits you where you live, in a good way. It's earthy, savory, and a joy to drink, if slowly. The moderated sweetness artfully shifts to a grounded dark character, lending complexity to a fine blend. The ABV is a warmer, and is notable in itself, but it's a complement, not a hinderance. In closing, Adam's welcome in my garden anytime, whether Eve likes it or not."
"Again, another bad experience. I, however, want to point out that I dont know for sure if its a bad batch or just extremely overrated and overpriced crap in a bottle."
"D: Fans of big bold beers will love this. I found it to be very unique and very tasty. This is in my top 10 all time favorite beers."
"[NP: all kinds of Peter Hammill]"
"Cheers!"
"Pours a beautiful dark brown color with a moderate head. The smell is wonderful, like dried fruit, candided sugar, and sweet malts. The taste is huge, much like a doppel bock with more depth and more carbonation. The candided fruits really take the center stage with this beer, and come off almost as big as a quad. Quite a beer."
"This is a prime example of trying a beer a different tempatures, I started with this one too cold on accendent and I was really put off by it and I almost drained it, but I gave it a chance to warm up I left the room did other things. When coming back to it just slightly colder then room temp if not room temp and it was a much better beer. I started my review over from the smell point with the warmer beer."
"Batch 61,when I popped the cap foam started coming out the top, poured a nice mahogany with a nice dark tan head that stayed aaaround for awhile. aroma roasted malts, caramel, molasses, dark sweet fruits, just a hint of hops, alcohol. flavor wow where did that come from got nothing in the aroma that would of suggested that there was smoke in this beer, a nice chocolate sweetness, the alcohol comes out nice and smooth, malts . I had this with pizza and it went very well with it the smoke worked will with the meat on the pizza."
"This beer pours a brown amber almost opaque with a frothy tan head that holds amazingly well and laces nicely. The smell is sweet and malty and sort of reminiscent of a dopplebock. The taste is malty and reminiscent of dark berry fruits. There really is no hop flavor to speak of but there is some associated bitterness that balances it out well. The alcohol flavor is masked well but is still strong enough to keep you only sipping this one. The mouthfeel has a good carbonation and the mouthfeel is good but not overly impressive. Overall a nice beer to have around in the winter, a good beer."
"Overall very interesting and complex. Not the most drinkable beer but for an old ale it was quite enjoyable."
"Interesting brew. For a historical beer it's not as bad as I expected. Good to know my ancestors didn't always drink swill."
"Poured a golden amber color with a large head, that left light lacing on the glass. Has a malty alcohol aroma. Taste was mild malt with a big kick of alcohol. I was expecting less of an alcohol taste. I was hoping i'd like this more, but I just wasn't a huge fan."
"As it is a big beer, this one can wear on the palate, but is rated as highly because it is a joy to take every sip."
"This beer pours a dark brown almost black color. The head is enormous, three fingers in height. Lacing is thorough through out the whole glass. The aroma is of caramel, butter, and grape fruit. The taste is rather balanced begining with a large caramel flavor and ending with some grapefruity hops. The mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonation Overall, this is a wonderful brew. It isn't as much of a brash hop bomb as I would expect from a West Coast brewery, but I think that is a good thing. It is certainly something I would purchase again."
"Drinkability- Other than the carb, it's got great flavors, a great nose and looks good too. All together a very good beer which may just need to mellow out before becoming outstanding."
"Pours black to dark brown with a good size light tan head. Strong smell of prunes and raisins, a little caramel and alcohol behind it all. First taste is quite smoky, maltiness follows with a sweet chocolate and a little pruniness and balances the smoky and roastiness. There is some peppery spicy alcohol in the finish as well, not unpleasant or overpowering, but well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body, a little oily slickness and a spicy tingle in the finish. An interesting old ale, I've got a two year old version that i look forward to trying to see how the malts develop and if the pepperiness dies down. This serving was Batch 66."
"This is a great beer from Hair of the dog, I will definatley be picking up a few bottles to put away for a year or two."
"Almost chewy mouthfeel, full without being oily or filmy. Highly drinkable, but a slow drink. There are alot of flavors to enjoy and savor. The alcohol sneaks up on you slowly but then kicks you in a good way."
"Batch # 65--A very complex beer. It starts out with a dark brown pour with a thick tan head, resembling a stout. Has a hoppy aroma and taste of dark fruit, like grapes, plums & figs. Spicy with a hint of the alcohol to come. As it warms up around mid-bottle, aroma and taste switch more to chocolate with a hint of malt. Alcohol becoming much more evident, but in the after taste and warming sensation, not the mouthfeel. At the end of the bottle, it begins to resemble a barley wine in taste, texture and alcohol. I think Hair of the Dog covered about all beer styles with this one. Good job!!"
"Thanks to jgaston for this bottle. Pours jet black with a substantial taupe head. Dusty roasted malts vie with espresso notes on the nose. Slight ripe figs, vanilla spice and fresh yeast aromas as well. On tasting, creamy mocha, slight dark fruit tartness and treacle sweetness are present. Quite a bit of hop bitterness at the mid-palate gives way to an alcohol burn on the finish. The finish is remarkable in that all the different flavors established already linger on the tongue at once, with no single one dominating. Big, chewy mouthfeel that makes for a meal of a beer. Great beer here, loads of interesting stuff going on, all of it good."
"D: I didn't quite know what to expect with this one, never had the style before. Was very good would for sure drink this one again."
"M&D: the mouthfeel turns creamy-smooth after the initially rough edge, this beer is full-bodied, yet ever so approachable and easy-drinking! An extremely well-crafted, hugely hoppy ale, unlike any English old ale I've tasted so far--presumably the big entry of aromatic American hops makes a significant difference here? But I take it as a healthy input, as the result is harmonious and quite balanced: ""a heavy-weight without making a big entrance"" (if that makes sense?). Still, I wonder if it'd be termed as an old ale--it has so much in common with other hoppy bombs made in USA and much bigger, bitter-er, freshly hoppier than English Old Ales~~ A brilliant and delicious drink all the same. Huge thanks go to Chris for choosing this ""gigantic gem"" for me!"
"The body is full but should have more (in my opinion). Old Ales can vary, but this seems lacking for an old ale. Overall the taste is good with a unique fruity flavor, and worth another try. As for my batch, Im a 61! Go 61!!!"
"Overall, I did not find this very drinkable with the strong, conflicting tastes and high ABV. Perhaps with age, though, it could be great."
"Wow, this head is way too big for a 10% beer. It's light brown resting on top of an almost black body. The nose is very sweet, roasty, and peaty. This tastes like a smoked porter and Baltic porter hybrid. It has tons of malt, roasted, sweet, and smokey, as well as bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and slightly hidden grassy hops. I can taste, and feel, the alcohol, but it's not overpowering. This was my first attempt at cellaring and I'd say it worked out deliciously well."
"I think this beer is close to being something great. It's got some rather interesting characteristics that just aren't cultured enough to really show through. I think it would be great with a few slices of smoked ham and some dark brown bread."
"The tan head pours so massively I can only fit about half the bottle into my glass. It doesn't subside too quickly either. The liquid is very, very dark, a deep brown, almost black color. Nose is fruity and raisiny, reminiscent of a dark belgian style ale, fairly strong on alcohol. Nice aroma, could have been a little stronger. The taste is woody and earthy, with a nice raisiny malt flavor yielding to a roasted coffee finish. Moderate in bitterness, warm alcohol also present. I also detect notes of chocolate, and tangy fruit. The flavor complexity is spectacular. The mouthfeel has a nice thickness, but isn't viscous, so it goes down smoothly. I enjoyed it very much and could drink it easily despite the strength of alcohol..."
"Much more enjoyable than the two others from the same batch that poured as pure mucous."
"Bottle Pours a dark brown with a light brown small fizzy head. The head quickly deminishes and the lacing was only okay. Has a good aroma of roasted barley and hops, a real nice mix. Has an average carbination. A rather nice mouthfeel. Has a good duration and a firm strong finish. This has a good bold taste with a nice smooth bitter finish. A hearty ale with great flavors. I find this beer really enjoyable."
"Pretty thick and heavy mouthfeel, but I think that may be right for the style. Not one I could drink all the time, especially at 4 bux for a twelve ounce bottle. Had a little trouble with this one, since my only style reference is Old Stock Ale. But Adam is a totally different animal. Now I'm kicking myself for not buying some Adam From the Wood when LiquidSolutions was selling it like a year ago..."
"DI like ita lot, but couldnt have more than two. Its a bit heavy and the high abv would sneak up on me"
"Nice mouthfeel and a decent sipping beer. Overall, this beer was way short of my expectations."
"Pours a deep garnet brown with a towering fluffy head that eventually subsides, though never completely. Smells of brown sugar, molasses, plums, spicy alcohol. Huge flavor all swirling around estery fruits, molasses, plums, oak, roast, raisins and just a lot of stuff. Starts off quite sweet but the mountain of earthy hops ends it quickly, ends surprisingly very very dry with a ton of earthy dirty hops and lingering vanilla. Smoke becomes more apparent as it warms, as does peppery spicy alcohol. Very belgian in style, similar to a quad, absolutely terrific. Body is medium with a lot of carbonation for the style, fluffy, creamy, a tad abrasive. Too drinkable for safety. Kicks ass."
"Taste is dark malts and extremely vinous --some depth as it warms. Metallic aftertaste which is especially undesireable for an old ale. Very disapointing-especially since this brewery was in American Beer--the movie--I'm dumpin it."
"I've been waiting to taste this beer for a while now..here it goes. Poured almost completely black, with a little bit of brown showing up when held up to the light. Smell was of fig, plum, heavy heavy alcohol and also a medicinal quality pairing itself with the alcohol. Taste was very similar to the smell, except for the fact that the alcohol/medicine flavors hit me with a vengence. Another flavor that hit me was heavy molasses and sugar. Mouthfeel was thick and syrupy, however it was more the taste then anything that made this beer not so easy to drink. Damn! this is some odd stuff to quaff. The alcohol doesn't even make an effort to mask itself...maybe thats a good thing. My final thoughts are that this may not quite melt my butter, but I still give a big kudos to the brewers for making such an out there beer."
"Didn't know what to expect. Pours a dark black with a light brown head. Smells of chocolate malt and roasted barley. Tastes of sweet coffee, maple, and a slight smokey woodish bitterness. It has some very similar qualities to Bell's Batch 7K."
"Aroma is quite fruitcakey..lots of spice and sweet malts. Dark cloudy brown with a mostly lasting thumb thick, tan head. Dark fruits, licorice, pumpernickel, bakers chocolate and alcohol. Not as good to me as others seem to think, but I still find it good."
"Simply another fantastic offering from Hair of the Dog that is well worth trying."
"Drinkability: This is a spectacular Old Ale that is well worth the effort it took to seek out here in NC"
"Batch 62. Very dark brown with some cloudiness and a dense, light brown head. Clumpy lace. Malty aroma with milk chocolate notes, some cherry, slightly vinous alcohol and a hint of charcoal. Moderate malt sweetness with chocolate, licorice, and cherry rounding out the flavour. It ends with a big dose of malt and lots of warmth. There's a heavy alcohol character throughout that covers up the other flavours, especially in the finish. Carbonation was a little high, but the texture was still decent and the body full. It's a little rough right now and it seems to need to rest for a while before it hits its prime. Thanks Viggo!"
"D - All around a very good beer. Easy to drink as well. for this style, it is hard to envision something superior."
"Sitting in a pint glass, this beer fades from a brownish burgundy, to brown, to black with a thin tan head. Looks very good. Smells of intense bread dough and oats with some sweet cotton candy, brown sugar and earth. Tastes of sharp molasses and caramel with a bit of dry wood. Theres definitely some alcohol here that lends a great warming. The finish is a subtle dry hop and a slightly fruity coffee. Over all, I found the flavor rather subdued, flat, and a bit on the sweet side but remarkable none the less. Mouth feel is medium body with a lot of tiny bubbles."
"Beer comes across a bit bossy. You hear many times about a ""meal in a bottle", this one is it. Heavy on the tongue, taste is too dominant."
"Finally tried the beer that I share a name with. Thought it was my 200th review... turns out it's #201... oh well. 12 oz., batch 48, no freshness date. I saw gunsmoke shoot out from under the lid right as I cracked it. After removing the cap it proceeded to foam up, almost spilling over, but I poured just in time. It's a murky (maybe too murky) dark dark red with some sediment and 1 inch of beige head that retains 1/4"" throughout, which is surprising for a beer of it's strength. Smells of coffee, chocolate and caramel, sweetness/fruitiness, and tobacco. It's thick and extremely smooth on the palate, with flavors of citric hops, chocolate, tobacco juice, fruitiness, and a bitterness that is definitely there but subdued by the massive amount of malts. It's so smooth I can barely feel the last sip in my mouth. Like silk. I shared this 12 oz. but I could easily drink 2 of them by myself."
"An old ale... I don't think so. Their website calls it an historic german style that is no longer produced. Overall a nice beer to help chase away another rainy day."
"4.5 years later, a vintage 2006 is brought out by Jonah. Looks lik a cask ale, with the small amount of light brown bubbles. The best part us the aroma of spices. The taste, malty, some chocolate, even cloying sweet."
"This one is not for me."
"Drinkability: The alcohol content of this one means that you'd likely not being drinking too many in a row. That said, it's a real pleasure to drink and I think it deserved above average scores for the style."
"Thanks Kevin!"
" This is similar to Batch 5000, but not in the same league. Drink this close to room temperature. My ratings would be much lower at colder temperatures."
"Drinkability is just plain super here. Tasty and thick without being abusive of the tongue or unbalanced. This was worth every bit of the $4 I paid for the bottle and I absolutely will be looking for more of this brew."
"Dark brown with ruby and garnet highlights when held to a light. Poured with a creamy tan head that leaves a nice ring as you drink. Chocolate, toffee, prunes and raisins, some roast. Maybe some hops, but this babys about the malt. Chocolate is the overriding flavor here. Sharp bitterness and alcohol burn. Very mouth filling. Definatley a night cap."
"Taste is again of dark malts with a big hop backbone. The malts lent dark chocolate and coffee flavors to the beer. There was also a light smokiness and some slight fruit notes present. Finishes with a coffee hint and a considerable hop bitterness."
"drinkability: not for the meek, one is probably plenty"
"12 ounce bottle, Batch number 47. More of a huge robust porter than an old ale, but a heck of a beer!"
"10% ABV is noticeable, but not overpowering. Definitely enjoyable, but a sipping beer for sure. I don't think I could have more than one at a sitting."
"Flavor is malty with chocolate and brown sugar mixing with caramel. No hops here. There is hot alcohol present from middle through finish that keeps this beer in the sipping category. A roasty malt and chocolate presence is also lingering with each sip. Quite a nice robust beer that is not for the meek beer drinker!"
"Very dark body, similar to a porter or a stout, with only a little light shining through the bottom of the glass. Head is pretty big after a fairly standard pour (goog retention, also). Raisins, alcohol, , slight acidity. This has a nose very similar to a barleywine, only with a lower hop profile. Taste is very large. Acidic and earthy, very malty and strong. Slight coffee and cocoa tones are also present. This is a great beer from an underrepresented style, I could definitely session this one."
"The noticeable alcohol and complex flavor keep this beer only moderately drinkable, but I find it fascinating. An excellent counterpoint to a barleywine or double IPA, this beer has a very unique character."
"Overall: A ridiculously drinkable and smooth enormous beer. It's beautiful from the first pour, and its flavor is extremely complex and can stand up to quite a bit of scrutiny. My first Hair of the Dog, and I'm looking forward to trying some more of their wares."
"Last swigs: Rauchbier and old ale. $3.99 at Johns Marketplace. This might join the ranks of my Must try to 10...maybe 25 beers."
"The taste is no letdown. Chocolately/malty...full, thick and creamy. There is alcohol in the aftertaste, which is to be expected with 10%....it adds a nice warmth to this full beer. More balanced towards the malt, but there is some slightly bitter hops here. A little bit of acidity in the finish. The liquid is very creamy and velvety in the mouth. I can't say that I would be able to have more than 2 of these as much as I like it. Even still.. a delicious beer that would be even better in the fall or winter. I recommend you pick one up and give it a try...you won't be dissapointed."
"D- This is a very impressive big beer that has lots of complexity but blends it all together. Great beer that will really improve with age or wood I imagine."
"Pours a murkey, dark brown color with a small head that falls to a small ring over top. The nose is intense, with lots of big fig aroma, soy sauce, molasses. I like it. Very intense. The flavor is a bit different. I get some smokeyness over some soy sauce and slightly woody/tanniny flavors. Damn this beer is good. I can see why the Adam from the Wood is sooo damn good. The feel is moderate with a small to minimal carbonation. Right where I expected it to be. Drinkability is top of its class. 10%...where is it? Not in the nose...not in the flavor. Damn good beer. I will be getting more of this one."
"On the tongue, a huge and complex flavor profile runs wild! Very old world, indeed! Heavy bodied, sweet fruit and a wealth of complex malt. This plays with a hoppy background that works very well with the overall balance. There is a big smokey side to it as well as the more familiar Old Ale characteristics. On the back of the tongue, the alcohol starts warming the palate, and doesn't stop for a good length of time. There is alot of personality in this ale... many elements to sit and appreciate for a good spell."
"Opaque, dark chocolate in color, topped by a medium-thick, light brown head. Way darker than I expected but not a bad thing at all. Smell, out of the gate, was flat-out amazing. Brown sugar to start, lots of caramel, baking spices, toasted malt... as it warmed, faint aromas of maraschino cherries developed, big-time toffee, maple syrup, cafe mocha - goddamn, I said goddamn. Taste captured just about everything in the aroma at some point or another. Tons of brown sugar sweetness backed by a zing of spicy hops that rounded out into a mouth-drying, extremely smooth bittering. Major candied-flavors, some light coffee, something grassy and just before I finished, I swear I tasted a bit of smoke. Mouth was big, thick and full with a near perfect blanket of bubbles across the tongue. The ABV warms the tongue and stomach almost immediately. This stuff is just amazing. Another killer from HOTD."
"smooth taste at first followed by a spritzy carbonation that opens your mouth up and a mouthcoating mellow sweetness in the finish. no hint of the alcohol at all...nicely balanced over all although the co2 is much a sometimes...balances out what could be too sweet though. very good."
"This is a unique one. Appears a dark russet cabinet color with a large offwhite head. Light brings out some red coloration in the beer. Smell and taste are very complex; lots of must and alcohol, as well as a ton of fruity smells, such as figs, raisins, dried fruits, etc... you could find anything you want in there probably. A little wine like perhaps and I'm picking up on some spices that vaguely remind me of a Belgian Dark Ale. Also has a pretty present alcohol character which burns a bit on the way down, pretty intense. Slick mouthfeel, but this one isn't meant to be drank in mass quantities, one was enough."
"Comments - Watch out! This is really good stuff, with some serious oomph! to it."
"Thick, plumy cumulus cloud of head. Coca-cola hue with a thick, maple syrup look to it; some active carbonation around the sides. Malt up fron for bouquet, with lemon and lime notes, and some moss in there as well. Pine flavors, jam of malt, ginger, sweet raspberry, and roasted characters make for an interesting rendition. Despite the alcohol, there is quite a light feel to the whole production. One will do it for me, though it is quite fine."
"Drinkability and Overall: An excellent Old Ale. Though it's still quite young, it's tasty as all hell. I'm going to let the other one chill for a while and I'm almost damn sure it'll be perfect in a few years. Mmmm I can't wait."
"Drinkability: Something about the nose made this less drinkable than other high-alcohol beers. I have a feeling this beer will do very well if allowed to mellow out for a year or two in the cellar."
"Brick red-bown, clear, tan head. Big carbonation. Sweet and sour aroma. Sweet and Sour tasting. Interesting beer. Pleasant. Malty sweet flavor. Some chocolate notes . Slightly bitter finish. Complex tasting. Sweet and sour aroma. Not bad."
"The brewer suggests Adam as a dessert beer served with chocolate or cigars. I heartily concur."
"An enjoyable old ale with a twist; a big smoky flavor in this beer melds well with the sweetness, and very little alcohol makes this dangerously drinkable. Quite good, and one I'd have again!"
"Light brown head over a dark chestnut colored beer left some small islands of lace. Rich aroma, some caramel, chocolate, and roasted notes. Dark malts and caramel up front mix in with some sweet dark fruits and alcohol. There's a light coco bitterness towards the end, and then a warm stomach. There's plenty going on in the big smooth beer."
"Batch No. 56. Pours with an outrageously massive head, a dense, simmering mass of eggshell brown rising over the rim of the goblet like a souffle. Gooey, sloppy lacing dries out into strata of geologic proportions. Average viscosity to this opaque, gleaming ebony liquid. What a visual feast! Pungent licorice and beechwood aromas along with heaps of near Rauchbier-like smokiness are wrapped in a marshy nosefeel. The flavor, too, begins with a very strong, burning wood smokiness that develops into something more like heavy black pepper. Whiffs of vanilla bean and juniper (or thyme?) mingle with salt as the beer warms on the palate. By the end of the glass, it's like drinking liquid kalamata olives, with a round, herbal bitterness, and tenacious smoky aftertaste... almost ""gamey."" Saline mouthfeel has a body thick and syrupy enough to rival the most nefarious Imperial Stouts. A slow motion punch of alcoholic fire connects with the gut hard, but this is still very drinkable. Seriously tranquilizing. This must be beer's answer to opium or Thai stick. Amazing."
"Overall: Its a cold stormy night in Long Beach for once, and this warming thick malty sipper fits the bill perfectly. Very nice indeed, along with the Doggie Claws this is definitely one of my favorites from Hair of the Dog. I bet this is wonderous when aged. More please!!!"
"Dark, dark btown with a pillow head that lasts. Smell is fruits, molasses, malt..very inviting. Caramel, fruitiness and disntinct alcohol presence dominate the taste...hops on the finish. Potent. Mouthfeel as expected is a tad on the heavy side...but who would guzzle this brew? Drinkability id a tad tricky...I gave it a 4.0 beacuse it foes down nicely fro a high abv. Whether I could have two in a night...well...."
"Deep smooth chestnut with low, dense tan head. Caramel scent. Thick caramel with smoky tones that take on a touch of creosote toward the end. The smoke makes it intriguing, but I'm not interested in having another. A hair on the syrupy side. Subtle warming that's just what you need on a freaking cold evening."
"This one is definitely a sipper. The carbonation is too intense to enjoy this right out of the bottle, and requires sitting at room temp to mellow to the point of being enjoyable. The smoke becomes burdensome, and the alcohol is a bit boozy, making this one difficult to finish."
"It tickles with carbonation and alcohol. You can eat this in wedges. Treacle. Italian plum tart with whole wheat pastry and farm fresh butter. A little bubble gum. A touch antiseptic. Plums. plums,plums,plums. Shot of espresso. Reminds me of a cat I had that curled up and had you pet him, then he'd turn around purring and smiling and slash you. Nice."
"The liquid is a deep, opaque brown color, topped with a no-nonsense tan head. The foam has considerable staying power and produces nice lace. The aroma is the centerpiece of the brew: alcohol, mixed with fruitblack cherries? Theres a sweet-like malt smell thats almost syrupy, along with smoke, peat, and fresh-cut wood smells. I love aromas like thiscomplex and fun to sniff. New aromas throw themselves at you every time you take a sip. The taste is considerably sweet, hinged with a powerful alcohol warming. Theres a spiciness and continued fruitiness in the taste. This is a thick, chewy, substantial beer, and is extremely enjoyable."
"Small, dense, tan head. A ruddy brown-black beer, hazy blood against strong light. Some swoops of lacing. Sweet, bready, toffee, molasses, tangy, pruney nose. Buttery, tangy, spicy, rotten fruit front. It's almost salty. Flat, oily middle. Almost overpowering in salty, rotten fruit. Spicy, sour fruit and alcohol in the finish; almost smoky aftertaste. This is interesting. It's a tasty, intense, spirit beer."
"This puppy ?sploded out of the bottle and made an enormous tawny head. The color is deep ruby red. Head retention dwindles and leaves some good lacing. Strong hop aroma with malt, chocolate, caramel dark fruits and whiskey. Flavor is quite intense; malty sweetness, fruits, raisins and a sharp hop finish. Palate is complex and stimulating with an aggressive fizz, a hoppy biting middle and a dry metallic finish. A well-done conglomeration of intense qualities with a good balance. I was expecting the usual over-the-top hop, etc., but got an interesting experience."
"Adam was full of the malt aroma with hints of plum, dates, and raisins. The taste is not far from the aroma with malt sweetness, tones of plums or prunes, dates, currants, and alcohol. The mouth feel is full-bodied, thick and comforting. I will be returning to this one as often as I can get my hands on one, but of course, I haven't tried Fred, Rose, or Ruth, yet."
"Full bodied, it's nice to try but I wouldn't go back to it - the smoky note was interesting."
"Aroma is sweetly malty, with spicy and yesty things happening as well. Alcohol presence is obvious. Taste is of spicy dark malts, dark fruits, and warming alcohol works its magic in the mouth and throat. Mouthfeel okay, just a bit overboard on the everything, and drinkability isn't the best due to big-time foaming issues (I hate to wait), and just plain hard to get down overall."
"Drinkability and overall: Definitely suffers due to the alcohol taste. I have to admit, this is the first beer that ended up down the drain. It got worse with each subsequent sip. Totally ruined my taste for any beer the rest of the day. I would avoid it. Not a good beer."
"Enjoyed this with my favorite everyday cigar, a Padron 4000 Maduro and they complemented each other very nicely. Wow."
"I don't mind alcohol flavor, but when it burns I take it as a sign that I am drinking something that I should not drink. This also gave me a headache. This beer is great except for the huge alcohol flavor, burn, and headache. Tone that down and you have yourself an absolute winner. As it is, I might try it again some time."
"My advice is simple... if you see it, get it and try it. It is well worth it."
"A remarkable brew!"
"Outstanding. This is up there with the best of them."
"This is a beautiful beer ment to be aged for special occasions although i would find it hard to keep it in the cellar for long."
"Pours with the vigor of an over-charged homebrew or a lively Belgian ale. Forms a massive tan colored head. An aromatic brew to say the least -- dry rot, chocolate, charred graham crackers, and bits of smoke. Soft enough in the nose to leave the vague impression of fruit -- or at least some sort of essence of fruit. Acidic in a smoky sense: Imagine gulping a mouthful of eye-burning, campfire smoke while tending a fire. That sensation is buried in there under the surprisingly light, chocolatey, malty, wood flavors. Incredibly complex. The levels and variations through which this goes on one's tongue before one finishes a single bottle is mind-blowing. Alcohol isn't terribly noticeable, but as tends to be the case, it hit me hard nonetheless."
"12 oz bottle from batch number 54. This pours a dark brown color with a deep red tone. The head on this is a monster, I poured it into a 23oz glass and by the time I was done the head was almost overflowing. Its was a rocky frothy head that was light tan in color and had at least a finger in height worth of head the entire session also leaving nice lacing as it was consumed. The aroma is extremely fruity with the smell of smoke and alcohol lingering about as well. Very interesting smell with some hints of medicine as well which actually blends into the smell quite nicely. The taste is big on roasted malts with notes of smokiness and dark fruits as well. This beer seems to be a style all its own with properties from a variety of standard styles incorporated. There is a slight hop and bitter finish to this one. The body on this is medium to full and it has good carbonation. I found this to be highly drinkable with not much of the 10% in sight. A very unique beer that is fantastic, highly recommended."
"Sweet, fruity, some smokey tobaco leaf flavours. Very complex, & quite tasty with a little bit of dark chocolate."
"I havent been impressed with any of the hair of dogs Ive had recently, but this damn. This is a great beer. Its not quite a Belgian, not quite a stout, and not quite a smoked beer. It sort of falls someplace in-between. All perfectly balanced and oh so tasty. Id drink this all day if I could."
"This beer has a jet black, motor oil body, with a tan foam head. The scent is thick malt. The taste features alocohol spice, dark fruit, caramel malt, and a touch of hop. Full mouth. Basically it is an intense tasting brew, a little over the top i think, but overall pretty dang good."
"I found this to be very drinkable but I forced myself to sip and savor. I really wish I had bought more than one bottle in Loveland, CO. That was a foolish mistake. Highly recommended."
"Nice to finally try this beer,poures an almost black definently very dark with a great creamy head that leaves waves of lace.Aroma has a spicey quality to it like roasted peppers and some alcohol notes,taste is complex with some peppery taste along with a chocolate note with some smokey flavors coming out as it warms.A beer to sip and savour well made and worth its press clippings."
"""Batch 57"" 12 oz bottle, strong tasty stuff, enjoy with care. Poured dark amber, dark tan head, good retention and lacing. Bready, yeasty nose, burnt fruit, alcohol, figs, raisins and brandy notes. Medium bodied,vinious, rich malt flavors. Resiny hops come burning through. Fine brew."
"Batch #58. Pours a dark garnet brown and makes a thin cream colored head. This is very much opaque and makes a medium lacing. Smell is mild and initially makes me think of a hefe with subtle hints of clove and banana, but theres a smokey aspect as well. The flavor is none like any other I have had before! Banana, clove, coridander, figs, raisins, dark bittersweet chocolate, roasted nuts, tobacco, fruity, sour, what the hell... all rolled up into one brew?! Wow. By far the most complex flavored beer I have ever had. Party in my mouth and everyone was invited. Medium to full body, starts out very carbonated and mellows out a bit. It is thick and syrupy on the way down coating the throat. Adam is a really nice one, he's welcome in my fridge any time."
"Appearance: Deep amber brown mahogany hue with a nice sized tan head leaves lace down my snifter. Aroma: Pine cone scented hops deep aclohol infused fruit tones robust explosion of malts producing caramel and toffee in the air. Taste: Orgy of hops and loads of malt yield this creation we know as Adam, big old ale the way it should be done with deep over ripened fruit in it's gullet. Heavy handed on hop bitterness and pine cone like flavor, great stuff. Mouthfeel: Big slightly chewy full bodied evenly carbonated. Drinkability: Amazingly complex, the delicious flavor brings a satisfying challenging experience to the palate a must try for any beer lover."
"Thanks again to Skyhand."
"A yeasty hoppy aroma with all kinds of hints of other things, a nice sweet malty blend of raisin banana lemon, almost like a weiss, thickish mouthfeel little bit of hop bitterness in the aftertaste, a complex sweetness lingered till the end.I seem to feel this is a great brew, but the blend just isn't something I'm into right now."
" I am absolutely enamored with this Adam. This is like a perfect, strong Scotch ale, with extraordinary drinkability and taste. I will be seeking more of these Adams, the sooner the better. Very highly recommended!"
"Batch 47 - An interesting beer created from written accounts of a beer once brewed in Dortmund, Germany. Nobody truly knows what the original recipe was, but the brewer has created this wonderful dark brown interpretation with its soft tan head. It has a fruity and spicy aroma and a very complex taste. The oily body is very malty and tastes of chocolate, peat, and spruce/pine can be found before the hoppy finish leaves you in bewilderment. It is as unusual as it is addictive."
"This beer rocked!"
"Hair of the Dog Adam ""batch 59"" was served from a 12 oz. bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was an attractive dark ruddy brown, with an abstract scattered stiff tannish head. The perky nose contained roasty and rich sharp malts, with strong notes of plump raisins and subtler banana. Smelled like tasty meal in a bottle. My suspicions were proven correct on the first taste, which revealed a robust and sharp, rich and roasty raisiny malt body, with notes of earth and banana. A moderately bitter finish rounded out the deep and complex malt profile, with lingering pruny-raisin oaky essence that satisfied the palate to the very end. The body was full and rich, like the flavors. Alcohol was completely hidden throughout. While quite rich, this beer was quite drinkable due to the fine balance of it all. This is probably my favorite example of the style. A must try for enthusiasts of rich/strong ales."
"Adam poured a dark, reddish-black with a beautiful tan head. Smell is oaky, musty earthiness, and sour grapes. Very unique and intrigueing. Taste is oaky, with molasses, rich earthy malts, some smokiness, a winey fruitness, and tangy bitterness. Very complex. Finish is vinous, tangy, and warming. Chewy thick mouthfeel. I think I'm going to get a keg of this for the big softball game...hahaha."
"Batch #57. Pours a three-fingered thick, creamy, off-white head that goes very slowly and leaves gobs of lace. Pour this very slowly. Opaque muddy color. Medium carbonation. Nose is malty. Starts different - sweet with hops, finishes slightly hoppy and bitter but not bad. Alcohol is less noticeable than in the Fred. $3.90 for a 12oz bottle."
"Overall: A must try!"
"I kept going back and forth from 4.0 to 5.0 on most of the categories for review. I don't know if that's an indication of my own indecision (I'm not so cock-sure as others on my first shot at a new brew) or something to be said about the complexity of this beer. It's damn good, I know that."
"What a treat. A nice brown head that lasts and a body dark enough that no light shines through, it has a pleasing roasted aroma and a full, substantial mouthfeel and flavor. Smooth, not bitter, its 10% alcohol is noticeable, but not at all distracting. Unusual that a strong offering like this would seem to be so drinkable. Some self-control may be required for this brew!"
"Very nice beer, kind of surprised by the porter undertones but solid effort."
"I didn't know they had trappist breweries in Oregon!"
"Batch#55. Poured a huge head that took forever to die down. I actually had to scoop a bit out.Dark murky brown. Aroma is of raisins and figs with aa overall earthiness. Flavor is malty sweet like a Belgian, fruity with an alcohol kick. Has a sharp carbonated mouthfeel. Overall a pretty unique brew with alot of character."
"Apperance is a dark brown with ruby reflects. Generous beige head that sticks to the glass like glue, every bubble is ultra-small and identical to its neighbor. Complex aroma reminiscent of port wine, grapes,licorice, plums, alcohol. Mouthfeel is creamy with a medium to full body. Very complex. There's just a little bit of everything in that beer it seems. Plenty of malty fruitiness with figs, plums, raspberries without neglecting brown sugar, smokey chocolate, nuts, spices. I hate to say it, but Et Cetera... That's very big and deep stuff, but anyone would like it I believe. A lot of fresh hops character contributes to the intensity. The aftertaste is great, delicate, hoppy, but almost not bitter, superbly warming and pleasant. Out of this world balance considering the enormous quantities of malt and hops. MartinT had warned me this was religious stuff-> RIGHT ON! Probably the best beer to ever cross my glass. I bet this ages well too. At 4.12, this is almost under-rated. If I have the chance to taste something better than this, I don't mind going to hell. I owe you one Jazz88!"
"*Note* - I got a six pack and went back and tried the others and the amount of foam is rediculous. All of them exploded out of the bottle and wouldn't stop foaming. I even changed refrigerators in the case that there might have been some vibrations. Insane how they do that. Other than the extreme foaming (and 20 minutes to get it into the glass), it's a great tasting beer."
"Good brew. Can't wait to try the other Hair of the Dog's...."
"Drinkability: I bet this would be an ideal beer for BBQ'ed ribs. A special occasion beer, but one worth getting and savoring. More than one in a sitting? No, but you'll want a litter of these puppies lying around the house. Perfect for a late fall/early winter day that's overcast and has a light breeze. Sit, sip, and think. So far, the best of the Hair of the Dog beers I've had."
"A perfect afterdinner beer with some strong cheese or a cigar."
"Batch #54. 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep rich brown color with the most head I've ever seen on a beer. It took about 10 minutes to pour. Despite the massive foam, there is only a little lacing. The smell is very malty and strong with cocoa and plums, fairly sweet. The taste is malty at first with raisins and chocolate up front. A bit of an alcohol and hops kick to the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly nice and thick. The drinkability is fair for this very unique brew."
"Batch #54. Pours a very dark mahogany brew with a massive cream colored head which leaves a ton of lace and stays well. Pour this one very gently! Aroma of fig, raisin, and lots of smoked peat. Very spicy on the tongue. Lots of carbonation, almost too much, which takes away from the mouthfeel. Dark fruits abound along with the smoked peat character. A tiny bit of bready malt is noticeable. Nice and robust. Reminds me in ways of a good scotch ale. In my opinion, it's best if you let it warm to around 55°F. A wonderful and unique brew, all it needs is a little less carbonation."
"Batch #53. It poured with a black body that had ruby notes when held to the light, and a khaki head. Aroma was dark malt and expresso. The taste was malt, prunes, port wine, leather, caramel, cola, and an alcohol bite. (With a 10% ABV, I'd be surprised if it didn't...) The mouthfeel was a medium oily one, with light carbonation. The finish was malt and cola, with light hop notes. Watch out, this is NOT a session beer, more like a rum-soaked fruitcake dessert in a bottle. Perfect as a nightcap!"
"Notes on Batch 59: Tasted a bottle of this batch the other night. Not sour at all. The lactic aroma/flavor was nowhere to be found. This leads me to believe that Batch 52 was definitely contaminated. 59 was all about the chocolatey sweetness with big notes of burnt caramel and peppery alcohol. Also mocha and a fait amount of smoke. Finish is sweet with a lot of residual roast and smoke. Because of this difference, I have increased the score from the previous score of 3.2."
"This is a gorgeous looking beer, as it looks like something straight from Belgium. A huge, rocky, pillowy off-white head tops the amber brown body. Head retention is great. Nose has a hoppy twang and some very strong smoke and alcohol notes. I think it smells kind of like roasted pork. Has many flavors to pick out..grape, raisin, and other dark fruits. Finishes dry, slightly hoppy, with warming alcohol. An interesting brew indeed. Not a huge personal favorite, but highly recommended."
"Deep black color, large head. Very roasted caramel nose. Very rich caramelized malts, intense hop flavor. Very intense flavor, yet a very mild taste. Hardly any bitterness. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, there is very slight alcohol taste, sort of subdued. WOW! Very nice beer, from a very non-traditional beer maker."
"Many thanks to MJR for donating this one to the cause."
"The beer sits heavily in my glass. Deeply stained mahogany that reddens at the thin parts of the glass. Great head that seems to have a never-ending supply of carbonation. I see it rising from around the glass. The smell is malty, dank, and slight hints of the countryside (manure). Tasting it reveals a bold wave of malt flavors, hot alcohol sensation, sour spin, and tart, fruity finish. There are delicate flavors, but the are masked to well by the bold creatures. Somewhat of a challenge to drink all 12, but still worth the trip."
"Notes: Overall a very good beer. A bit daunting in appearance, but much more mellow in flavor. Would have liked it to have a bit more body."
"Update  For my 2005 review we are back on track. The sourness is gone, the rating is back up, and for the first time in history the bottle didnt explode all over my kitchen floor. Yeehaw!"
"Drinkability: Excuse me? 10% ABV. Are you *sure*? A wonderful beer to be had. It got much better as it warmed, with the flavors being more pronounced. A very smooth and quaffable beer. I really had to slow myself down with this one, lest this concoction disappear too quickly. Do yourself a favor and pick one up. Reward yourself for a job well-done with Adam."
"Originally sampled on 1 June 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. It poured with a huge head. It's very sweet. As others have noted, it would go well w/ chocolate. Also, the alcohol is very apparent. It does have a sweet taste to it. This is a unique brew."
"A big beer, a sweet sort of English Strong Ale (not a barleywine!). Definitely good but surely not great. Serve slightly chilled for best results."
"This is a profoundly good beer. The head is sculpture. My first encounter was on draft at Floyd's in Seattle. I've tried batches in the 20's, 30's,40s, and 50's, with tonight being #52. The last time was #33. This beer is an example of Beer as Art. It is beguiling. Like a good meal the components are so integrated that no one element stands out. They tease. The flavour changes from Imperial Stout to Harvest Ale. All the leathery,woody, chocolatey flavors dance interchangeably throughout the taste. When I think I have a flavor pegged it changes. Alan Sprints is an alchemist. This is gold turned into beer."
"All of that being said and the St. Loki's day massacre being recorded, I would gladly recreate the event if I was to never see Adam age and achieve the temperament of an aged wise guy."
"Lovely."
"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights. Forms a light brown head that leaves a decent amount of lacing. The aroma is malty, bready, and peppery with a bit of roastiness and chocolate notes. The flavor is sweet, bready, raisiny, with a super sweet fruity flavor and a sweet syrupy finish. It is a full-bodied brew that is very tasty."
" Outstanding."
"Man, the head is huge on this, puts my gourd to shame, I had to wait to let this puppy settle. A very dark amber brown, light doesn't find its way through very well. A sweet, smoky aroma, malty, with a hoppiness at the end. The beer has a definite roasted malt flavor with a smokey, earthy flavor. A pretty smooth drink considering the complexity of the taste and the ABV. As you go further into this beer, the hop character becomes more apparent. A slight caramel aftertaste. A very good beer but not something that you can drink alot of."
"Its a sipper, its very strong in its flavors and alcohol, and takes some getting use to."
"[ STATS:>> 12 oz bottle / ABV: 10% abv / PRICE: $3.39 USD ]"
"Color is a dark mahogany, with a full, thick, sturdy, creamy head. Aroma is nutty, creamy, and sweet. Palate? Unparalleled!!! Marvelous, magnificent, with layers upon layers of malt. Hops give a cameo, not much screen time at all. So strong, so full of flavors, it's hard to know where to begin! Where, oh, where to start, where, oh, where to stop? A toffeeish flavor comes through on the palate, but before long everything is overtaken by smoke! Loads and loads of malt, rich and warming, earthy, chocolatey flavors peek through, but the notes of smoke and tobacco become dominant. Profound. Rich,and thick, and continually smokey, though the main flavor is a suggestion of being encased inside a nut. This is a true American classic."
"Batch 54: Finally able to get this in Ohio. Pours a motor-oil dark brown, and 9/10 glass light beige foam to start out. I barely noticed the foam creeping out of the bottle in time to keep it from ending up all over the table while I was waiting for the foam in the glass to die down. That was kind of irritating. It is never good when it takes you longer to pour a beer than it does to drink it. Head took forever to dissipate. Aroma was a great blend of roasted nuts, raisin, malt, and alcohol. Flavor is an earthy concoction that doesn't even bother to try to hide the alcohol content. Very complex, with flavors of malt, fruit, caramel, vanilla, chocolate, and a myriad of other things. Great beer, but the crazy foam attack needs to go."
"A very nice, complex old ale. Definitely one I'll get again."
"Batch #41. Pours a deep, deep auburn color with no head , hence no lace. Extremely sweet and fruity aromas; figs, raisins, caramel and alcohol. Brandy like on the nose. Slightly bitter taste, coffee, deep roasted malts, alcohol. Suprisingly dry with a thick mouthfeel, almost no carbonation. Hop presence comes through mid glass, but takes a back seat to the alcohol. Finishes flat. I didn't see any other reviews for this batch so I don't know how it fared compared to their other batches."
"Batch 54. Frenetic bubbling. The apparent overcarbonation precludes a simple pour into my favorite ""Schwenker"" glass. 1/8 beer, the rest foam. Ridiculously thick tan, creamy and sticky head. I used two glasses at first. Quite manageable after a short deliberation to allow both me and the beer to calm down. The head is seemingly molten like in viscosity. Lightly murky deep crimson hue. Ripe pear esters, woody oak, with a robust, leafy tobacco - like dark fruit and earthy hop nose combination upfront in aroma. Mellow beechwood smoked malt and butterscotch are secondary. Hint of bittersweet chocolate. Absolutely unique, rich overall and intriguing aromawise. Combination of chocolate and dark caramel laced sweetness initially in flavor is ceded by assertive fruitiness comprised of sugary plums and dried dates, with mild banana esters emerging late. Rounded, judicious smoked malt complements the malt character well. Hop bitterness is moderate and non descript, but offsets malt sweetness enough to aid in the oddly quaffable nature of this brew. Full in body and dextrinous, with the high CO2 levels lingering, lending a paradoxically crisp, yet rich mouthfeel. Finishes lightly smokey, with quasi black patent like malt bittersweet note pleasantly lingering. Adam is a flabbergasting brew. It's reminescent of Schelkerla's Rauchbock / Anchor Old Foghorn hybrid. Absolutely delicious, but somewhat perplexing. This fine beer is certainly worthy of a 750 ml portion."
"F"
"Way too much head with this beer, even with a gentle pour. Albeit a thick head; I do hate having to wait to drink my beer. The beautiful lace in the glass was the only reward from this foam Bitter sweet aroma. Bitter, yet smooth flavor. As with most Hair of the Dog brews, this as a very unique taste to it. At 10% abv, I'll definately get rewarded for my patience."
"Not sure if I got a bum bottle, but the fizz was real low on this guy."
"Batch number 26. Dark ruby-black in color, not much carbonation, thin head, woody-liquorice aroma. Full body, very smooth soft, creamy mouthfeel. Oak and smokey sweet chocolate flavors, nice warming alcohol feel, beautiful."
"Folks, if you're planning on tasting others beers in the same night, do this puppy last. Taps with a nice faomy head and deep amber-golden color. The striking aroma wafts heavily with malt of earthy character. The heavy smooth body supports flavors of heavy malt and earthy, musty grape tones. The warming effect is undeniable. A sipper for sure. A beer that drowns the senses for quite a period of time post-taste."
"""Yo DAWG", the pour looks more like a ""Guinness", deep brown, as my vision is still blurred from the Fred. The head is Brobdingnagian in size, creamy in consistency, with lace that adheres to the glass in oversized sheets. Nose is caramel, deep earthy malt, smoky or better yet a peat and musky aroma, fresh ""Black Walnuts"" also come to mind. Front is malt, the top is middling in mouth feel, finish is penetratingly acidic, scrumptiously hopped and the aftertaste dry. The alcohol hits you like your 5 ""X" spouses looking for their back alimony! One damn fine beer, and I need to find a local source for Hair Of the Dog Beers, as they are Magnificent in their robustness, and as you know, I like these mean spirited beers."
"Poured very dark with no head at all. The smell is the best part as you can find apple,sherry and some great fruity flavors. The taste is much the same as the smell with a mild chocolate flavor coming through. Sip this after dinner but watch out because this one could hurt."
"Overly drinkable barleywines can be a dangerous thing, this beers name is dangerous. Goes down some smooth and creamy, with layers of sweetness that are no cloying at all caress the taste buds to bring them closer to heaven. Highly recommended especially on tap."
"Deep brown to black (garnet) colour ( a bit murky), Off-white head, which sticks around, but is very thin. Hugely malty aroma, with some citric hops as a backdrop, winey, touches of oak, some anise, the nose smelt quite acidic, fruity (raisins) and a bit of fruitcake or something, some alcohol aswell. First thing you notice when you take a sip is the fruity/chocolatye sweetness (yes, hugely malty), leading into some nice coffee roastiness, then quite a bitter acidic finish with some piney/citric hops, a touch winey, a touch oaky, a touch citric, a touch of spice, even a touch smokey and perhaps a bit earthy. yep its complex, the palate wasn't as round as i would have liked, but theres so much good stuff happening in here, that it didn't really take off to many marks. Satisfying bitterness to back up the sweetness. Unlike anything that i've tried, but contains so many different characteristics from different styles of beer, hardcore. Man, i'd love to age a few bottles of this. Also noticed that the price was still on the label, $1.99 at Trader Joes,, i reckon that a pretty top deal for a beer of this calabre. Thanks Andrew for this, a top brew!!!"
"Batch Number 48. Pours an opaque brown with absolutely no head, which lets one know that this one is big on ABV. Definitely some bottle conditioning by-products floating about. Smell is diverse with a variety of characteristics. It's rather sweet and fruity with some notes of chocolate. First sip indicates the plethora of flavors that are part of this ale. Adam attacked my palate with notes of raisins, figs, alcohol, chocolate, bittering hops, and more. Mouthfeel is rather syrupy and oily. The alcohol content presents itself toward the bottom of the glass, decreasing drinkability a bit. It's good now, but it can certainly stand to mellow out a bit with some cellaring. Sip and enjoy."
"Easily the most drinkable double digit ABV beer I have had.  Not for beginners, like Stone Arrogant Bastard, this beer just wants to kick your ass.  My suggestion is to let it."
"Big malty aroma with a hint of belgian yeastiness, but not really. Flavor is big on the malt with chocolate and other dark flavors predominant. Not much in the way of hops, but what was there fit in nicely. Surprisingly you get a bit of burn from the alcohol despite the fact I've had stronger beers that left no burn."
"Dark brown in color with very little foam on the head. When I first tasted Adam it had a sweet and smoky taste on the palette. Complex in flavor, but the sweetness and the smokey after taste was a bit to much for my palatte."
"Batch #53:  This beer poured a very dark brownish black color.  No light is getting through this one.  It didn't form much of a head, but maybe I had it a too cold or didn't pour it right.  It was a light tan color and did leave some lace.  The aroma was of raisins and cherry, malt and some chocolate.  Interesting flavor of a smokey fruit.  It has a medium body and a glossy, somewhat burnt finish.  A hint of the alcohol when it goes down.  A nice beer that is probably better at a warmer temp. and with some aging."
"An excellent beer although Batch #53 seems to need to age a little bit. It's nowhere near as round and supple as it can get."
"Update 6/29/03: I was playing with my ratings and saw that this is one of my top 5. I wasn't quite sure of that, so I popped one for validation (courtesy, once again of Mr. Bighuge himself). Conclusion? This is the real fucking deal right here. One of the best in the States."

"Great dark, dark brown color, excellent firm head with rings of ""mountains"". Murky, with lots of sediment chunks. Burly aroma, with raisin and cherry tones. Deep flavor, like a java with prune liquor and some complex grassy tastes. Taste is somewhat like a better-controlled Bell's Batch 5000 without the smoke. Hops are very flavorful, together with lack of heavy carbonation, add to a long lasting and changing flavor. Just dang interesting in the mouth. Alcohol is notable but the brew is more heavy than sticky. Excellent beer!"
"A very interesting beer. Wonderful aroma featuring a smoky mustiness along with a boubon like smell...dark brown in color..with a nice creamy head that settles and remains..a plethora of flavors...a real herbal/earthy texture...some notes of blackberry, and wood aged bourbon...sweet but bombed with hops as well...it balances nicely..smokiness on the finish..."
"This beer is a little charged up.  You need to be careful pouring this one.  Pours a big rocky tan head. Has very good head retention.  Color is close to black.  Aroma is of earthy hops and slight smoke.  The first thing your buds tell you with this one is that it is one great brew.  The mouthfeel is very light for an old ale.  This is incredibly easy drinking for a 10% a/v old ale.  It has a ""belgian-like"" alcohol taste present.  Very mellow.  Has some slight roasted tones and beautiful hop character.    Was well worth the $3+ I spent on 12 oz.  Top Notch."
"Wow.  Pours a dark brownish amber with a thin head that sticks.  Complex aroma with roasted malt and alcohol dominating.  Slight wooden undertones.  Roasted malt, chocolate, slight whiskey, and slight smokey wood characteristics in the taste.  I know there is a lot of alcohol in this beer but I can't find it in the taste.  Very subtle hop character.  This is one awesome beer.  A lot of subtle characteristics that just beg you to analyze them.  A nice beer but not for the faint of heart."
"This is an awsome dark rich, smokey ale. not for the beer wuss. Big, stong and tasty."
