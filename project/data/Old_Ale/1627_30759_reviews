"Look: clear dark amber, creamy head, and plenty of yeast chunks so that's never appetizing but it is probably bottle conditioned. Smell: mineral,light caramel malt, ripe stone fruit. Taste: sweet almost cloying, plummy,spicy, malty but not grainy bitter toffee and there is some hop bitterness but not overwhelming. Feel: medium high body good carbonation, low astringency. Overall : a solid old ale"

"O: An interesting beer that is worth a try but nothing I could drink too much of. Stronger chocolate presence than I expected."
""
"Overall: Admittedly, I am surprised, I have had several Eel River brews, Raven's Eye is my favorite, this is second. I am going to pick up at least another bottle to age. This is a beer that is well balanced, the sweetness though prevalent does not overwhelm the malt and bitterness."

"Taste: Hot sake and carmel. Cheap vodka on the tongue, with a malt foundation."
"Poured from bomber (650 ml bottle) into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass)."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very nice beer, but the flavor comes across a little dramatic. I would love to have this same beer dialed back about twenty five percent in both the bitterness and the alcohol. 80 IBUs seems to be a bit much here. The aroma is incredibly inviting, but once it hit my mouth it became a little obnoxious. But in the end I am impressed (3.75/5)."

"Pours a clear dark amber, with minimal, quickly dissipating head, looking a bit like a whiskey in the glass. A bit more like a whiskey or brandywine, especially when the minimal carbonation stilled, it is really only the malty bready richness, smooth on the tongue, which reminds the drinker that this is still a beer. A fine sipping beer for me, but hard hitting and not very subtle in character...perhaps some dried fruit notes, molasses sweetness, but not true 'esthers' as in a barleywine, and a slightly metallic alcohol edge although the creaminess covers this... Not bad, but a little too direct for me, LOL."

"Overall solid beer. It's a big old ale."

"A well made and almost classic example of the style. Something I always enjoy when I have it, and always wonder why I don't order it more often."
"Pours the darkest copper hue with creamiest three finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is burnt toffee,caramel,ripe fruit and candied figs,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and has tastes of candied figs,fresh plums,burnt toffee,brown sugar and finished with a roasted maltiness and caramel bittersweetness and overall a nice old ale that would age well cheers."

"glad i tried t. would definitely drink again but not sure i'd seek it out."

"Overall this was a very good beer although it is still not a mind blower in the old ale spectrum. The flavors are a bit too alcohol heavy, preventing complete enjoyment/savoring. The flavor profile is good but lacks the true greatness of say Kuhnhenn 4D."

"The beer was dark brown in color, hazy that produced a nice white head. The aroma was of dark fruits, alcohol and maybe brown sugar for that hint of sweetness. The beer was pretty malty sweet with that hint of dark fruit and alcohol, but the taste was certainly big. As others have noted the beer felt more like a Barleywine, very heavy. Overall, I got to say that I am not into the darker beers with the dark fruit flavors, but the beer was good and I enjoyed it, but doubt I would drink it again."
"D: Pretty easily drinkable for a near 10% beer, it hides its alcohol well. Drinking this makes me wonder why organic beer can be so good and so many organic foods can be so bland."

"O: This beer really tastes similar to an American Barleywine because it is quite hoppy for the style. It would have been nicer if the alcohol was better masked from the smell and taste."
""
""
""
"O: A nice beer, it is interesting how the palate differs from the nose, offering something refreshing and easily drinkable for the style."
""
"The beer pours a dark, brick red color with a white head. The aroma is fairly sweet. I get some molasses notes as well as some dark fruit. There is also some sherry, alcohol and caramel malt thrown in. The flavor is full of alcohol and brown sugar, with a little bit of dark fruit (mainly cherries, grapes, dates and raisins). There is also a strong, sweet malt backbone as well as a little bit of resinous pine. A big, flavorful and alcoholic American Barleywine that is fairly easy to drink, but I wish it came in a 12 ounce bottle. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"It's a strong manly beer, there's just not getting away from it. For the most part, it's an easy sipper (definitely something you sip), it's just very strong and aggressive. It never crosses the line, but it stands defiantly on the line. I've got about 19 more ounces to go from the bomber I bought and I'll surely be sleeping well tonight."

"Pours a medium brown with tan head that sticks around for longer than I was expecting. Mega caramel & molasses character to the nose and taste. Really sticky sweet. Not particularly a fan of the stickiness, but it comes with the flavor (more or less). Other old ales I've tried - most notably Curmudgeon - have been a little lighter in color and texture. I prefer the style that way. It was nice to try in any case. The old ale is kind of underappreciated."
"Review from 1/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium orange brown amber with a two finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of bready and caramel malt, earthy with some nuttiness. Flavor is understated nutty, caramel malt up front with a big hit of alcohol and hops. Interesting spicy wood flavor middle and hop finish. Nice job. The alcohol is a little hot, but the flavor progression is good and malty. A nice old ale."

"Overall, an amazing beer. I highly recommend it."
""
""
"Nothing to really keep me interested here. A decent beer, but nothing stands out and really makes me want to drink more of it. The look is outstanding, but the overall beer lacks real character."
""
"Pours a nice, deep amber color with a two finger light tan head. The head retains relatively well. Sticky foam laces the glass as the head attenuates. Butterscotch cream up front. The mouthfeel accentuates the finish, which is a little to bitter for this style. The alcohol warmth that appears at the end further exacerbates the unappealing finish."
""
"Pours a lightly clouded brown color with big, frothy khaki head, little retention. Scent leads with nice notes of brown sugar, vanilla, roasted nuts, hint of dark fruit, booze. Taste leads with a little bit of booze, which is my only knock with flavor, eases into nice notes of vanilla, booze soaked cherry, brown sugar and faint splash of oak. Medium bodied, a touch light for the style. A decent Old Ale that opens up and becomes better as it approaches room temperature."

"Overall: I've had this before and was not impressed. A little age has served this brew so very well. Drinks quite beautifully, considering the strength. Superb taste."
""
"Overall: quite a tasty brew. There's a pretty big alcohol bite along with the strong bitterness toward the end, so it's not hugely drinkable, per se. Still, a good sipper on this, a cold snowy day."
""
"Overall: I personally think this is a great Old Ale. Great depths of flavor. Just delicious"
"Very much a high alcohol barleywine reminiscient of Bigfoot under the old ale title. This is a bit hoppier than your standard old ale. Dark ruby body with a thicket of khaki tan head, this thing pours pretty viscous for the color. Aroma has big earthy piney notes with big ripened fruits, plums, raisins, and tart apples. Malt sweetness is layered between caramelized sugars and toasted malts, with interwoven layers of big ripened fruit...more raisin, plums. You could definitely lay this big bruiser down and not worry about it's aging potential, you know this thing is going to get better. Mouthfeel is full bodied a bit tamer with hop bitterness than your average Bigfoot release, finishes balanced between hops and big malts. Moderate carbonation carries things extremely well, doesn't become cloying or harsh despite the big malt/hop action going on, highly excited to try this beer...much better than any other organic offering I've come across."
"O: Average"
"Poured into a 20 oz giant Duvel tulip. Pours a lovely bright reddish / orange, with a 3 inch off white head, that settles slowly, into a layer of bubbles. Bountiful lace, nice. Smell is carmel, toffee, brown sugar, bread, dark fruit raisins/figs, and some alcohol. Taste is all of those flavors, dominated by Carmel, brown sugar, and dark fruits. Body is on the larger side, nice carbonation, not too dry, and drinkability is pretty good for its sturdy abv. This isn't my favorite style, being a hop head, but I think this is a nice old ale. Thanks mom for the early Christmas present."

"Overall I like this beer and have been glad to enjoy it as much as I have. Get it if you see it."
"The downside: Not much in the finesse side. Huge sweetness, huge bitterness, huge alcohol, not much attempt to blend them together. ""[They] would use a bulldozer to find a china cup"" - Raiders of the Lost Ark"
"I'm gonna say this rates just slightly below ""middle of the road"". Potent. Does pack a punch. Guess that I have no idea regarding ""Old Ale""."
"D - Just did not do it for me. I am not looking for a sessionable beer when drinking Old Ale, but you should want to finish the glass. Not this time."
"Overall, a decent, in not special, example of the style. Worth trying if you see it."
"This is a style I usually shy away from, but if I ever see this on a shelf, I'll by another one!"
"Overall: ABV saves the beer, It does pack a punch and is a decent overall, but Eel River doesn't really do much for me, they are a good decent brewery with their heart in the right place. This beer is a slightly better one of theirs."
"Full-bodied with a sharp initial effervescence that drops in the middle. A dryness in the finish but relatively rich at the fore and continuing throughout. Nicely warming from the get-go. A bit more nose and flavor would really make this a great beer."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet to dry candy sugar. In the taste, dry fruit, candy sugar, and a small yeasty presence. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry fruitiness in the aftertaste. OK, but average."
"D - easy to drink but old ales aren't session beers. drinkability is average for the style."
"glassware: tulip"
"Smooth and thick and mellow, this is a pleasure to drink. My first experience with Eel River, I think I will pick up a couple more of their brews."
"This is a bold beer, and proves that organic beer can be great in the right brewer's hands. I don't know about Eel River's other stuff, this is my first, but I like what they've got going on here. Probably a little demanding for a higher drinkability rating, but yeah, this is definitely recommended."
"Overall, not that complex but it has a good clean flavor."
"- Drinks very well... is very well balanced.. and for a sweet brew.. it really has enough other balanced flavors to make it not seem so much like a malt power punch to the gut. Great brew."
"Downtown Wine and Spirits in Somerville MA."
"Overall I find the beer to be overly sweet and rough around the edges. This was not undrinkable but it was not very good."
"Definitely a sipping brew, and quite good to be sure although I still would prefer some old stock over this one."
"D: This is an uneven beer, but still oddly drinkable."
"Perhaps it was the name that got my hopes up, but I've tasted much better brews from the folks at Eel River. Maybe it would have been better to let this one age a year."
"a burning question persists: does an old ale crammed full of hops (and thus resembling a different style) get to call itself an old ale?"
"Pours a really deep amber/ruby color with a short but sticky off-white head. Smell is really sweet and dominated by dark, dried fruits (mostly fig) and caramel. Despite the sweet and malty aroma, the taste has a good bit of hoppiness to it. Alcohol is hidden very well. Definitely not the sweet malt bomb that the scent suggested. The fig appears on the tongue as well, along with plums, toffee, and a hint of coffee. You also get a molasses that seems to appear after a few swallows. Rich and creamy feel. This goes down very nice. I'm pretty impressed with this offering."
"D: While this beer does not offend the palate--it goes down pretty easy for a ""big"" beer--it lacks the subtle complexities and refined character that should be present in an English-style strong ale. I would look for an opportunity in the future to taste this beer with some age on it, for the sake of comparison, but I'm not rushing to add a bottle to my own collection. Not surprisingly there are some similarities to North Coast Old Stock, although this beer still seems to have the training wheels attached."
"D - This is a very nice old ale. A really good brew from Eel River."
"22oz bottle "
"S- The aroma is malty with dark fruits and a hint of caramel and alcohol. "
"D- Overall, Triple Exultation is a pretty solid Old Ale. At 9.7% it is definitely a sipper. Worth a try."
"D: This is very tasty, but watch out for the ABV. Easy to polish off a bomber."
"An old ale that goes up to 100 IBU's? That's crazy. Eel River manages to pull it off without creating a mess."
"Very pretty, dark ruby colour. It smelled strongly of bourbon/liquor, but it didn't have too much of a kick to it. It was very sweet and pruney, slightly like raisins. It was very smooth, and very tasty. Quite drinkable, but a little high in the ABV to have too much."
"Drinkability - worth trying. No real issues for me but not distinctive enough to take note."
"Flavor is much nicer than the nose led on...has a rich, almost pudding-esque sweetness and thickness. Some oxidized malts are present, but it has held up pretty well for being 3 years old. Has a toasty and mild hop finish. Alcohol is a bit much and is in the forefront and on the back end of tasting. It does have a nice, full creamy mouthfeel and some pretty nice flavors going on. Vanilla and maybe even some bourbon characteristics come out as it warms. Some nutty malts are there as well. Pretty smooth...I like it, albeit a somewhat simplistic Old Ale."
"Interesting but not what I was expecting at all."
"This was worth the money, but it definitely won't be a regular purchase. I might pick up one bottle once winter rolls around again, but overall I'd much sooner grab a 4-pack of North Coast's Old Stock Ale"
"First off the head was so much better. I don't know that this had anything to do with cellaring but it was thick, creamy, and left globs of lacing. The aroma was still tight but the flavors opened up a lot more, especially the sugars. Overall a huge improvement and will even get better over the next six to twelve months."
"Drinkability - deceptively easy."
"The body is really light for the style, and the carbonation is a bit high. Alcohol is felt, although not overly hot. Overall a nice beer. The aroma was awesome, but it went a little downhill from there."
"Overall I enjoyed this one, Although the Old Stock Ale by North Coast may be my favorite in this area. A Solid second though!"
"D- Very drinkable for such a high abv. Really like this beer. Man what a step up from the amber (which was not good at all) Surprised that the two beers are even made by the same brewery. I would put this one up with Hibernation. Maybe not as balanced as Hibernation but man it has a great flavor. If you like Ole Ale's I highly recommend this one. I bet it would be killer in a year."
"A quite nice old ale. While I generally prefer this style to be a bit heavier (and slower drinking), they did a nice job here. Some hints of a barleywine here too. An enjoyable drink."
"Not quite what I was gearing up for when I opened the bottle but good stuff nonetheless. Makes me interested in other offerings from Eel River."
"22oz bomber: This one pours an amber-brown color that is fairly opaque. There was a bit of a frothy dark tan head on it, but it dropped away quickly and left no lacing. Interesting aroma. Spicy, woody, some alcohol on top. Caramel malts begin to punch through rather quickly. Interesting taste. Definitely some alcohol up front. It subsides quickly and is followed by smoky, woody, caramel. Some roasted flavors and spices also. Wasn't sure I liked it on the first sip, but it grew on me as I drank more."
"Drinkability- It was pretty good. I would drink it again. I liked the smell and flavor a bit."
"Triple Exultation is a good beer. I think if I were in the mood for this kind of thing, 9 times out of 10 I'd opt for Great Divide Hibernation Ale, which has a better mouthfeel and (for me) a better taste. 1 time out of 10 though, I'd take this somewhat more complex but less refined old ale."
"d: an interesting beer that really blends some of the sweeter toffee malt flavors with some of the sweeter and bitter sides of the hop; worth a try"
"I would recommend this one only to beer fans looking to try new beers. But there are others out there that might be better choices."
"Eel River Triple Exultation pours a bare finger of foam over a cinnamon-colored brew that collapses to a ring of bubbles pretty quickly. That ring is maintained by a very spritzy carbonation. The nose is clean toasted malts, herbal hops and notes of butterscotch. The flavor is pretty straightforward- sweetish, rummy malt with molasses notes stiffened up by grassy/herbal malts and a touch of alcohol sharpness. Mouthfeel is round and clean, trending dry due to the sharp hoppy aftertaste. Pretty decent, though I feel it's a tad hoppy for the style ( I was a little surprised, visiting their website, that they claim it's 100 IBUs). I must have gotten a pretty fresh bottle of the stuff- a little aging would take the edge off nicely, and at 9.7% ABV, you can let it sit for a while. Worth a try, and one of the few 100% USDA organic breweries out there."
"I thought this was a very tasty Old Ale, not quite to style, but very tasty."
"D: I'm not going to run out to the store and gush over this, but I found it enjoyable, and I will pick it up again."
"Definitely worth a try if you can find it....and it's organic to boot!"
"This poured a clear, dark mahogany with good tan head. It smelled like honey wheat and caramel, with some spicy yeast and molasses. It tasted like a mix of spiced breads such as rye, pumpernickel, sourdough, and fresh wheat, along with some caramel and honey and copper hops. It was fairly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter metallic aftertaste. Overall this didn't taste like I expected, with a lot more spice and hops, and a lot less malty sweetness. It still tasted clean and was enjoyable, and it hid the alcohol well, so it was pretty easy to drink. It would be nice if age would provide a more prominent maltiness, but I think there is an equal chance the flavor would simply ending up fading over the years. Who knows. While fresh, this is a good and interesting beer, but certainly not the best old ale."
"nice nd of the night beer. not much hop feel but a good english barleywinish beer."
"Great atmosphere first off. Really great appearance, and very pleasing, full-service nose. Flavor does not disappoint. Full, hearty, and robust, with great complexity. Good balance though, nothing overwhelms. Overall, this is a really great quaff."
"Overall a good beer."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into a nonic Imperial pint glass. This old ale appears a hazed deep crimson walnut color with an inch of foamy head. Nose and flavor are of dark fruits such as cherries and prunes, dark brown sugar, quite sweet, slight citrus note as it warms, and a noticeable dose of alcohol. Just above medium bodied with adequate carbonation for it's style. Glad to have had the chance to try it."
"Probably good with some BBQ or flavorful meats, maybe even a roasted chicken. My initial tasting of this beer was a big zero. This second tasting warrants the review and I'm glad I went back to it. Solid burnt grain character provides depth and interest."
"Bottle: Poured a murky brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and great lacing. Aroma of dry fruit with some nice sweet malt. Taste is also dominated by sweet barley malt with nice notes of dry fruit, some sugar and some lightly fruity ester. Body is quite full with some great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done with enough complexities but also keeping a nice drinkable profile."
"D: If it didn't turn slick, I'd give it a higher score but I'm not sure how often I could drink this one."
"Clear mix of ruby and amber colors. Very quick head, ok bubbling, and no lacing or stickage. The aroma is an even blend of spicy orange hops and sweet toasted bread mlts. Too much hops in the aroma of this old ale. The taste starts with mildly sweet, almost candy like toasted bread malts. The spicy, somehwat peppery and definetly orange peel hops. This beer is balance, but not enough of the malt is allowed to shine through. I like old ales for their maltiness. This palate is a touch to spicy and bitter for my taste."
"Beer poured into my Kapittel Watou chalice. Dark chocolate brown in color with a ruby hue, beer forms a 2 finger light brown head that dies quickly. Intricate lacing weaves itself across the glass. Nose is subtle with hints of molasses, oatmeal, candi sugar, and dark fruit. Taste is a bit disappointing after the opening, but it's still above average. Some malt sweetness and caramel up-front, but nothing too complex. Finish has a bit of late touch of bitterness. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with the right amount of carbonation and medium body. A pretty good beer from a brewery I know nothing about. Overall, it was a pleasant surprise. One note, many stronger beers get better as they warm but this one had the opposite effect for me."
"Its a good brew, recommended for sure."
"D- this one was a let down for me. not one i would grab another one of for a long time. maybe with some time in the cellar the malts will come out more and make this alot more interesting and easy to drink. ill check back in 2-3 years."
"D - I asked the owner to make sure this one stays on tap. Classic example of an old ale/Christmas bier style. Exceptional beer."
"I'll skip this one next time."
"I am almost certain that I have an old bottle. If I buy another of this, I will have to compare that taste session with this one. As it is, if this is the aged version, I like it."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a nice robust, American style olde ale. Pretty smooth, tasty, decent depth. The strength is pretty overt, but I've got another one that should easily be able to run 2-3 more years at least."
"At 9.7% ABV, and fairly easy to notice (not that it's overpowering), this is one that most people won't be slamming down by the case. I like it and would gladly drink it again, just probably not more than one per session."
"Not bad, not outstanding. A decent price point for how strong it is($6.29 before tax/CRV). Would like to revisit this beer once it has at least a year on it."
"D-OK drinkability. I remember when I purchased this bottle, the salesman at Heritage commented about how this brew was different than so many other old ales, in that it had a huge hop presence. I think I enjoyed this interpretation of the style, and I'd definately enjoy this one again."
"Nice solid off-white one finger head of mixed bubble sizes, nothing dramatic about it, steady presence with good lacing. Deep murkiness to the red-brown clay color, complete opacity, an orange aura sneaks in around the rims. Unctuously thick nose of scotch whiskey, molten caramel, butterscotch, carob coated raisins, ginger cookies, barley, plum/prune, not crisp enough to seem toasted but it's all malt and no hops. Full-bodied, more of that alcoholic rum or whiskey action, no burn but ""heady"" to say the least. Caramel, toffee, molasses, all the standard descriptors, oats and barley, mulled prune juice, dates, milk chocolate, orange juice. The carbonation makes a good faith effort to rev things up but ultimately can't. So, better just relax and accept the steamroller of sweetness flattening your tongue. The hoppiness does not truly show strength except as aftertaste. It's flavorful and easily gives pleasure but it's kind of like trying to eat a whole fruitcake yourself."
"It's not a *bad* beer, but it's not astonishing."
"Dark amber color, a little light for the style, with a creamy beige head. Nice lacing. Aromas of alcohol, fruity esters, alcohol, caramel, and fusel alcohol. Flavor is malty with a thinnish mouthfeel. Solid bitterness. Again, lots of booze. Dark and red fruits and a burnt character. High carbonation, too much alcohol, not very drinkable, however it doesn't have a bunch of absurd off-flavors like most organic beers. Not recommended."
"Another organic bomb. Pours a murky reddish-brown, with no head. Reminiscent of rusty water. Ethyl alcohol, caramel, and the smell of burnt sugar. Viscous, soilid mouthfeel has me looking up, maybe the taste will redeem this one. Nope. Raisins, prunes, and malt doused in alcohol and molasses. This is like one of those nightmarish Christmas homemade candied plums. Boooo."
"Take you triple exultation and stick it-- ...in a cellar for a couple of years before drinking it."
"D: I have been hearing about this brewery for a while now. Not bad and it did not have that organic commonality so many organic beers have. I have another bottle in the cellar and I think it might benefit with some time but it is enjoyable now."
"As the beer warms up some hemp like aromatic notes start to become noticeable in the nose. The flavor too becomes a bit more balanced between the malt and hop character. In fact the hop notes get quite a bit more aggressive, with quite a sharp, herbal edge to it as the beer warms up. The malt picks up a hint of roasty character as it warms up as well, though this is pretty subtle. This ends up being a nice beer to be drinking in the colder months of the year. The rich malt plays the leading role, but it ends up being nicely balanced out by a biting hop character. Despite this balance, the beer ends up not as well integrated as I would prefer. Not bad, but it could be beer; perhaps a bit of age might help with this."
"Flavor is sweet malt as expected, brown sugar and some toffee notes with a bit of warming booze on the finish. The beer is very tasty but doesnt mislead you into drinking too many. I enjoy this beer and will be purchasing it again in the future. Plus it is certified organic, bonus!!"
"Pours a deep clear brown color with a decent head and nice belgian lacing. The flavor is of rich malt with a very apparant alcohol bite aftertaste. The aroma is a light roasted coffee or maybe even a sweeter toffee. A really good beer to warm up next to if you are looking for a sipping beer, not one to quaff down fast."
"Bottle from the Davis Co-Op. Pours a dark red, like black cherries, with a short tan head. Laces in a pathwork, kind of oily fashion. Smells of well roasted, almost burnt sugar, caramel malts, some smokiness. Flavor is somewhat fruity, with dates and cherries. Sweet malt and an obvious ethanol flavor/warmth grow on the tongue. Smokey, rauch notes. A bit underdone overall though in terms of the flavor...everything seems a bit muted (except the alcohol). Im a little disappointed with this one, which is a shame because i love old ales and their incarnations are so few and far between."
"D - Reasonably drinkable, but kind of a weak old ale. The aroma is quite nice, but the flavor really falls flat."
"22 oz. bottle, w/o bottling/freshness date, sampled in a tulip. Pours dark,dark cherry tinged amber, under a quick to thin dark tan cap, leaves ringed froth and leaves plenty of lace. Pungent nose of sweet smoke, dark cherry and layers of maple malt. Rich and tasty, notes of more cherry, bourbon, light smoke, rum soaked raisins, chocolate covered cherries, plenty of sweet malts, some alcohol. Quite dry with resiny hops late. Thicker, smooth mouth feel. a lot going on here, and its all good. Surely one of the better offerings among Eel River's organic lineup.* I would suspect that this one would improve with with 6+ months in the bottle to mellow a bit and to allow the flavors to mingle together."
"I had this on tap at Papago Brewing in Phoenix. This was absolutely delicious. Notes of vanilla and pear over a great, intense, wonderfully sharp classic American strong ale taste. CA caramel malt backbone holds it all together. This has a perfect balance. Highly recommended."
"Big, girthy body to this oldie, complimentary carbonation and rich flavor keep things rolling right along. A very tasty and strong ale thats a pleasure to consume, and hey, it's organic!"
"Poured a dark brown/reddish color with fluffy head that lasted a little while. Aroma was malty and had hints of dark fruit. Taste is similar to the smell with some nice hops bitterness to balance it off. Mouthfeel was very pleasant. Drinkability for a beer of this abv was not too bad. Good stuff that I would have again."
"As for me, my taste buds aren't completely sold."
"The beer pours a dark red/brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very nice, warm burnt toffee scent along with roasted, almost raisiny aroma. The taste is awesome. It has a super smooth, malty flavor that goes down with ease and finishes warm and dry. It has the most intense burnt toffee flavor I've ever encountered. The mouthfeel is perfect. It is a full bodied beer with just the right amount of CO2. This is an exceptional beer. I can't say enough about the malt character as well as the mouthfeel. It's incredibly drinkable for 9.7%."
"Pours a solid dark brown with beautiful ruby highlights. Thin bubbly off white head that leaves spotty lacing on the way down. Aroma of caramel, figs, sugar, and a bit of spicy hops, smells like it will be sweet. Taste of caramel and burnt sugar, followed by some spicy hop bitterness and a bit of roast. Finishes with a bit of alcohol and a lingering hop bitterness. Nice tasting old ale. Medium body with a crisp bite of carbonation. Great Old Ale! I wish I could get them here, I'd like to try more of their stuff."
"A touch of heat from the alcohol helps the sweet dry finish the rest of the way down."
"D: This is an enjoyable and recommended old ale."
"The aroma was of chocolate and figs. I could taste the high ABV right away and it had an aggressive malt and hop profile that blended well. In the mouth it was semi-chewy that left a burning sensation after it left. This one was good but definitely a sipper as the lips were burning a tad."
"Pours a clear dark mahogony with a giant tan foamy head that leaves great lacing, a very good looking beer. The smell is sweet with dark fruit, candy sugar,mollasses,bread yeast,and alcohol. The taste is much like the smell with roasted malt,candy sugar,alcohol,dark fruit,and chocolate. The m/f is strong with all the flavors mixing pretty well. A strong beer that's not bad,but not as good as other Old Ales. Still, if you see give it a try."
"drinkability: ok"
"Drinkability- this was much better than I was expecting, as dbalsock kind of downplayed it. I'm still working on finishing this bomber, but I don't foresee any problems in doing that."
"Brownish colour with enormous off-white head that was bubbly and lacey. Funkey aroma. Brandyish taste, that was both a soft caramel mouthfeel but also sourish.Well, silly me. Thought it was going to be a triple Belgium and thought it was of. In fact, as an old ale well yes. And all me super-beer geeks did not also get it so I don't feel so bad."
"Even after a 22 ounce bottle, I have some mixed feelings - began very drinkable, but didn't sustain enough depth and balance (too bitter) for the style. Even though alcohol is noticeable it's not too sharp. There is a metallic characteristic going on. Still, there's enough to it to make it be fine to sip on a 22-ouncer. I don't know that Old Ale would have come to mind, maybe a DIPA? But, it would have been in my first few guesses, I suppose. They tried to add a hoppy character to it while maintaining sweetness, I assume. Works well enough, but not to any great degree, IMO."
"I would recommend this beer. I bought this bottle at 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"Overall Score: 91 of 100"
"Poured into a Westy glass a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tannish head, not much sticky lacing at all. The nose is malty, with some dark fruits/dark chocolate notes. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with dark/chocolate/fruit notes. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden pretty well with this one. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, highly recommended."
"I expected Triple Exultation to be at least as good as Raven's Eye Imperial Stout, a beer that was mucho enjoyable. Instead, it's about the same level of quality as the rest of Eel River's lineup. In other words, it's average to below average and isn't worthy of a repeat purchase. Ozzy deserves to be compared to much better beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, sugary, boozy, with flowery bitterness in the finish."
"D- All in all an excellent old ale. The smell wrote a check that the taste couldn't cash but it still ended up being a bit better than average."
"Pours a deep clear mahogany brown with a decent big bubbled tan head and better lacing. The aroma is a coffee malt with toffee elements, warm and inviting. The taste is a malty mouthful with a certain warming alcohol that is obvious but not all that distracting. It is aqueous but it shows a nice viscosity, almost resinous, plenty of maltiness here and plenty of alcohol. This sometimes almost seems like a ""malt"" liquor, not Colt 45-like, but a liqeur of malt. There's a sweet Dr. Pepper quality about it and the bitterness is pretty steep, dry and perhaps herbal. It's drinkability is probably minimal due to the alcohol presence."
"a touch roasty and hoppy to call it an old ale in my book, with about a year or so of age on it this is coming around nicely. I'd consider throwing a case in the basement and letting a few years elapse to enjoy this down the road."
"D-Very nice....not sure if this is really an old ale or a malted up DIPA. Lots of malt and hops keep this big boy going. A nice beer and my fav Eel River brew to date."
"For an old ale, this is one of the more enjoyable taste-wise. Rich, thick notes of caramel candies (think ""melted Sugar Daddy"") balance well with brown sugars, raisin, plum, and resinous hops. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side of medium, and the body is smooth--not exactly creamy--but chewable. Finish is sweet caramels and some pine, with the alcohol note very well masked. Overall, Triple Exultation is a winner, just like Eel River's Ravens Eye Imp. Stout...they're 2 for 2 in my book. I'd definately seek this out again."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a clear rich deep amber with a little mahagony tint a larger creamy off white head atop that never totally subsided,a great mix of citric resiny hop and malty dark fruit and caramel in the nose after it warms a little a light sweet acohol note shows through as well.This is an American influenced old ale no doubt on the palate a big dose of piney citric hop really hits up front with some sweetich dark fruit and a even a little nuttiness in there as well just well balanced the alcohol does creep a little and you do feel it after a bit.Started out a little prickly in the mouth but it subsided after awhile,a very nice sipping brew I enjoyed it."
"it's still very boozy despite being clearly warmer. it's got some good flavors in there, i can tell. i really want to like this, as it aspires to be something individual. it commits beer suicide by trying to be overly imperial. probably won't try it again."
"paired nicely with some Madrigal cheese."
"Dangerously smooth and easy to drink, but with plenty of body. I would visit this one again."
"D: A great dark and sipping tripel that was boozy and alcohol fueled. Halfway through the drink you start to warm up to it and becomes much easier to handle and enjoy."
"Recommended..."
"Drinks pretty good for the ABV & style. The hop mix isn't exactly my cup of tea, but a solid Old Ale all in all"
"Drinkability: decent overall beer worthy of a try. Slow sipping beer but alcohol creeps up on you."
"Well this is an interesting beer. The look upon first pour is picture perfect as a postcard, fine color with a substanial beige head, like clouds looming overhead. The head disapates a bit with each sip but leaving an almost perfect ring of lace on the inner surface of your glass. There is a real sweetness early as each sip rolls over your tongue. I get a real taste of candi sugar, that come to a quick halt, taken over by the alcohol burn. The alcohol while not harsh or an off flavor but is pronounced enough for me to quickly think about laying a bottle of this brew down. My bet is one will find time will be a real friend to this beer. The finish is balanced by a west coast hop finish very apparent with a lasting drying out effect, that precedes a lingering carmel aftertaste. While so far, I've found some ups and downs with Ell River beers all will be revisited to confirm my taste. This one; I will look forward to with much antisapation, perhaps 2 to 3 years down the road (from that aged bottle) when the alcohol and hops have found an even better marriage."
"A very attractive beer: clear, clean ruby-amber with a strong frothy head and tons of lacing. Notes of caramel, brown sugar, and citrus emerged in the nose. The flavor included lots of hops in this one, and much of it right up front. Notes of light brown sugar, prunes, and some coffee made appearances. Very bitter on the back end and the alcohol is well hidden. Less malty than some Old Ales I've tried, but I liked the extra hop punch. Overall this beer was not as complex as I expected, but I bet it would age nicely."
"Fantastic looking ale, the colour is so neat. Its dark,smoky brown with a hint of purple through it, its hard to describe, but beautiful, lovelly medium sized tan head.. Aromas of dark maltiness, prunes, figs, demerara sugar, dark 70% chocolate. Taste is thick and bitter smooth malts, toffee, ,extra strong black coffee, pipe tobacco , ashy and a hint of marzipan, all finished off by noticable ,yet pleasing alcohol. Great palate on this one, I relished the feel of every sip. Over all a very nice ale. Good one ,Eel River!"
"This beer poured a nice dark brown with ruby highlights and a thick off white head which disappates slowly. Great lacing. The smell was malty sweetness with roasted smells as well. The taste was roasted malt with a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is full with medium carbonation with strong alcohol taste present. Overall great beer. I would prefer this during the winter months."
"This beer poured a deep dark brown with a thin tan colored head. The aroma is sweet with malt, raison and molasses characteristics. The taste is malty and not as sweet as the aroma would have suggested. It has a bitter finish. The mouthfeel is full with the alcohol definitely noticeable. This is above all a great smelling beer. The flavors do not follow, but Id love to cellar this for a while and review again in a year."
"D- Pretty good- never took notes on a fresh bottle (tho i do remember rather enjoying it), so I can't recall if the astringcy/black tea (which i find a little 'off') is a result of age/oxidation, or if more time will reduce it."
"Great beer; I'm ecstatic that I haphazardly chose this one to try."
"D: Big, huge brew. Reminds me a lot of HOTD Adam but just not as complex. This too would be a very nice cigar beer. And this beer barrel aged would probably be quite a treat."
"Drinkability: With it's sharp, punchy bitterness, this one's definitely an Americanized old ale."
"Nice dark coffee color. Small tan head, tightly packed bubbles. Smells good, tastes good, at first, but oh that aftertaste, quite bitter. Hits the back of the tongue hard and stays there. A verystrong hoppy ale, nothing subtle or nuanced about it. A bit syrupy going down the throat too."
"Dark red bordering on brown with a minimal head ringing the glass. Smell is good and taste is chewy caramel toffee with some bitterness at the end. This is delicious and does not remind me at all of a barleywine (I have trouble differentiating the two styles). I bet the barrel-aged version is a tasty beer."
"Overall, a good and drinkable old ale. If i buy another bottle of this, it will be for cellaring."
"Pours out a very dark ruby with a frothy off-white head that leaves some nice lacing. Nose is a mix of dark toffee malts, citrusy hops, booze and a touch of diacetyl. Taste starts off with some dark malty sweetness but is interrupted by some harshly bitter hops (which give flavors of citrus and lots of aspirin), out-of-place butter, and medicinal alcohol. Finishes sweet like drinking a piloncillo syrup. Mouthfeel is full, slick, and oily. This could use a decade or so to rest. Heavy handed, to say the least with no subtle nuances at all. Nearly a drain pour, but I want to get my buzz on."
"The color when poured was a medium dark thick amber with some foam and a nice amount of lace on the sides of my glass. The smell of roasted malts filled the nose. The taste of roasted malts and mild hops filled my taste buds, with a hint of caramel. Nicely balanced with the sweet/tart/bitter on the finish. A pleasant surprise."
"Very solid old ale. Maybe the hoppiest old ale I've had in a good way. Long resiny bitter finish. Mouth is chewy and medium bodied. The citrusy grapefruit hops mesh well with the thick syrupy toffee malt. Milk chocolate covered caramels and fig with dates, maple, brown sugar, vanilla, orange peel, and mixed nuts. Very nice and very drinkable. Alcohol is nicely hidden with some showing through on the mouth and finish but adds to the experience. Would love to try the barrel aged version."
"This is a nice Old Ale. A bit more sturdy and strong tasting than some others in the style, but it is still enjoyable, and a worthy sipper. This seems like a beer that would really benefit from some aging."
"Good tasting for the style, but man, glad I split this one. The alcohol taste is strong, this could cellar for years and just get better. Still, a good beer at this age."
"This is a nice release from Eel River. Pours a clear reddish brown with a lacy tan head. Lightly sweet aroma of caramel with an herbal, hoppy nose. Apricot, pepper and the malty-rich flavors of rasins, plumbs and figs. A nice toffee-rich dessert beer. Overall a soothing and mildly warming beer.Delicous!"
"Pours a dark copper to amber color, slight haziness, with a cream colored head Sweet caramel breadiness, cereal, some sweet pruniness and dates in the aroma. Booziness also evident in the smell. Taste shows some sweet toffee, dates and fruitiness, a decent drying somewhat grassy bitterness, and a slight hint of licorice and roastiness. Hint of the alcohol in the taste as well, but fairly well hidden. Somewhat creamy, medium body, just a scant thinner than what I like. Somehat unique taste made this beer interesting."
"Big beer that is on the sweet side. I like it but I can see where some will find it sugary and too sweet."
"D - This one definalty will pick up as time goes by. Just a bit too young still and this is really dampning some of the more subtle and complex tones that are definatly there. Will leave a few in the closet and come back in 6mos and try it again."
"(the best part is I traded him for two bottles so I have another in the cellar to enjoy at a later time...woo hoo)"
"D- Not overly drinkable, but I could smell it all day. The taste is honestly disappointing after the wonderful immense nose."
"Drinkability: I was expecting a bit more fruit and a bit less bitter flavor, frankly, but this is a decent enough Old Ale"
"Good beer, give it a try."
"Poured a nice brown that gleams of crisp dark amber when held to the light. There was a thin head that was slow to diminish but left no lacing on the glass. The aroma was a rich array of malts, burnt caramel, maple and some dried fruits. The taste is also very complex. Good variety of malts dance on the palate. There are characters of burnt caramel and dried fruits with a good subdued hop base that is doing its job in the background. The alcohol certainly weighs down the beer on the tongue, it is heavy, but not so much that the beer is undrinkable, it is definitely a sipper. While I do consider this a very enjoyable beer, I can't see myself drinking it all that often, I'll stick to barley wine if I want something heavy like this beer is."
"Pours a deep brown color with garnet highlights when held up to the light. A smallish tan head diminishes quickly. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, fruity hops, and more than a little alcohol. Palate is rich and malty, with a little bit of a port wine character. Dark sweet fruit (raisins, etc.) and a touch of toffee flavor come through mid-palate. Finish is sweet and a bit hot from the alcohol. Body is thick, a tad sticky, and occasionally foamy if you're not careful. A tasty beer, very assertive and flavorful, but a little rough around the edges."
"Purchased in the local COOP in a 22 oz bottle. Poured a very dark cherry color with a big foamy tan head that lasted a long time. Very rich nose of burnt malts. Fruits and carmel are added to the flavor and with the high alcohol content this is almost too rich and powerful. A bit of sweetness. Somewhat bitter finish. Interesting brew however, and should please those that like their dark beers big and bold. I opened a second bottle. I let this warm up a little to about 45 F. It again poured with a giant foamy light brown head you could have eaten with a spoon. Nose is even more intense. The flavor was much improved, and much smoother. Dont drink this too cold and this is about a good as an Old Ale can get."
"Many thanks to lou91 for this one."
"Really good, but even the viking on the label probably wouldn't drink this every day (nor more than one bomber in a night, I hope). It is surprisingly drinkable, but it's really substantial, and best reserved for cold nights when you feel like a beer that will stick to your ribs."
"Pours a two finger pillowy light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Deep mahogeny color. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Sweet raisin nose. Starts sweet like sharp raisins, mellows into hints of alcohol with a definite alcohol aftertaste. A decent old ale. $4.50 for a 22oz bottle from Liquid Solutions Tigard, Or."
"Triple Exultation indeed. Because there are three beers packed into a 22-oz bottle. This beer is part Imperial Stout, part Doppelbock, and part Wee Heavy. Hell, maybe it should be called Quadruple Exultation, because there might be some Barleywine hiding in there, as well. Theres a lot going on here, its all good, and it all works together. Malt, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, fruit, smoke, roast, a nice dose of balancing hops, full mouthfeel, and a reasonable alcohol bite. Incredibly complex and tasty. One of the best beers Ive ever guzzled in any style. Or, in this case, almost every style."
"Damn!!!! I dont write a lot of review these days (not much time) but this is one hell of an old ale. Dark brown in color with a dense sticky head. The aroma is sweet caramel, fruity ester and a floral hop. The flavor is chocolate with toffee tones, a light bitterness, and a spicy alcohol hit. It is everything I want out of an old ale and a decent price."
