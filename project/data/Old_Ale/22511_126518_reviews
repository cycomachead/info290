"A perplexing beer with the caramel, vanilla, and sweetness of an old ale, but then a medium tart quality hits in the middle, along with cherries and dark fruit."

"Overall, very tasty and complex beer.  A sipper for sure.  I would drink this any time it presented itself."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is unique and im glad to have the opportunity to try it. However, im at a lost as to how to score this appropriately since this apprently falls into the grey area of old ales and whether they are accurately portrayed as boozy malt bombs or wild ales... regardless i enjoyed it."
"O-An interesting take on the style, not one of HF's better beers but yummy none the less."
"Pour is dark copper brown, virtually opaque, with a tight small bubbled tan head.  Nose is assertive brett, strong dry leather, toasted malts, caramel, and a touch of malty berry sweetness.  Taste is stronger malt and a bit sweeter.  Brett is there, leathery for the most part, toasted malts and caramel mid palate, a fair bit of cherry sweetness.  It has a fairly high bitterness through the finish, incredibly soft body, and clean light carbonation."
""
"Overall - It doesn't smack of an unintended infection, but it's much more controlled.  The tartness works pretty well and keeps it a very interesting beer."

"Chestnut brown colour, ring of off white head, not much in the way of lace. Smell is woody with dark fruit soaked in bourbon followed immediately by a brett-funk, butterscotch and a light roast. Taste is tart upfront, oak with dark fruit, bourbon and caramel flavours, quite delicious. Medium carbonation, fairly full drying body. Really nice, good mix of tart and malt with a nice barrel character."

"Overall:  Very interesting take on an Old Ale and I like it.  Its like an Old Ale and an Oude Bruin combined. I see this beer getting better with time in the bottle."

"Pours a mahogany hue with no head. Nose is oaky, malty and expresses tart notes (cherries) and a suggestion of bourbon, wood and maple. All I can say is that the taste is consistent with a very well-made flanders oud bruin. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a light carbonation and some acidity. Overall - I can't really describe this as an old ale; however, I found it quite enjoyable."

"O~ old ale? i'd call it a flanders brown haha. its only any old ale because well... its old lol going senile in those bourbon barrels for far too long haha. aside from Ann this is one of the most interesting brews they have put out for sure. probably just because it wasn't what i was expecting but hell i don't think anyone is expecting what this has to offer. a very solid brew! lets just say HF's resident microflora really took over!"
"Not really sure what an old ale is, but this comes across to me more like a flanders/old bruin sorta thing with a great oak presence from the barrel.  Not my style of beer typically but very much appreciate this one.  I think folks who dig flanders/old bruin type styles will really dig this."
""
"Well, I wasn't sure what to expect on this one. Still having trouble describing it in the review. Definitely different. I was expecting the bourbon barrels to show up more, instead they mix in with all the funk. Lots of sour funk and dark fruit."
