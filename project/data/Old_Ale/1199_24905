I like how the brewer used the oak's astringency coupled with the hops and alcohol. The Fact founder's only adds oak, not oak and bourbon is also nice because the oak only adds a note to the beer's overall profile, without dominating it. It's a good beer that's fairly unique.","riverotterrob","Saturday at 05:51 PM"

The strong ale hits you first followed by the oak/whiskey flavor but then fades quickly into a kind of sweet aftertaste.  I think the molasses helped balance it out.  This is not a sweet beer it is dry and kind of bitter but I thought the bitterness subsided as the beer warmed.  This is definitely a sipper beer with some good friends or some good old alone time.  I do not think it would be enjoyed with food.  Overall, I have purchased every bottle I have seen and can not wait to seek this out again in the spring.  I still have two bottles in my cellar from this year.  I was fortunate to drink more than my fair share this year!  Seek this out I can not see how you could be disappointed.","VTR","Dec 22, 2014"

A lot going on in this one. A nice level of sweetness with some dry bitterness in the finish. Full body, soft carbonation, smooth yet sticky texture and soothing level of alcohol warmth. Grab a good novel, your smoking jacket and relax in comfy chair with this one.","magpieken","Beers"

Has an oily, spicy maltiness to it, with vanilla and cream underneath, which defines the character of this brew. It is still pretty sweet on the palate, but without loosing its balance, as it finishes with a gentle, hoppy bitterness of matured hops and oaky hints. The alcohol gets perfectly hidden by the sweet malts, creating a smooth mouthfeel with a slick finish, while being medium-bodied.","aleigator","Oct 07, 2014"

Even so, has some good old ale qualities of maltiness, light colour, etc.   Drank on June 14, 2014.","patre_tim","Sep 06, 2014"

Same body and carbonation. Like the nose, flavors have also gone downhill. Age has decomplexed the flavor profile. While still outstanding, it just doesn't reach out and grab you. Everything is there, but in a subdued fashion and more of a blended presentation rather than a progression on the palate. On it's own, I would give the aged version a 4.1.","tillmac62","Beers"

Strong aroma of light malt is present to the point of a gentle sweetness. The taste is an assault of light malt with a strong sweet component. There's a thick,sticky mouthfeel. If you like plenty of malt,this is up your alley.","Franziskaner","Jul 03, 2014"

It's a great dessert beer for when you don't want a BA stout - it treads the same waters, but is much less heavy. It kind of reminds me of what a super-easy-drinking bourbon would be like, with the caramel, oakiness, and robust alcohol presence. Such an incredible beer!!","MasterfulIdiot","Beers"

Here is a fine example of how pervasive oaking can be..until, of course it meets something just as persuasive as the molasses used here. Not a lot on the nose & no head to speak of so that leaves the battle on the tongue between the oak & the treacle. Each as it's moment but neither comes out a winner. I enjoyed it but could not get past the novelty effect. I suspect a draft portion...or better yet, a nitro pour could lift this to another level.","seedyone","Jun 27, 2014"

Rich, full-bodied, sweet, chewy but not syrupy - a little bitterness but predominantly molasses.  Alcohol definitely makes its presence known, but complements the flavors rather than detracting from them.  Nice sweet aftertaste.  One of my top ten beers of ANY style.","dbl_delta","Jun 22, 2014"

It smells like old wood, probably aged in barrels, and like wine and fruits. Taste not like a beer in the traditional sense. Very flat and without fizz. It feels like drinking a fortified wine. Interesting to say the least. If Old Ale was not on the description, I would have dismissed it.","JulioH","May 11, 2014"

First sip is not much sweetness but you can definitely taste the oak barrel and finishes with a strong alcohol kick. Was looking for more maple goodness. As you drink more and the beer warms up, the maple and molasses start to come through. A very nice beer. Starts becoming like a fine cognac. Be careful as that almost 10% will kick you real quick.","Richardbeerlover","May 11, 2014"

The beer leaves quite a bit of lacing. The smell is very sweet and a little bit tarty. The strong notes are caramel with mix of molasses and oak with a bit of a cherry smell. The oak is weakest of the notes but still works very well giving that nice harsh non-sweet note at the end of a very sweet bouquet. The smell also contains lightly roasted malt notes that add a bit of a cereal smell without compromising the rest of the beer. The beer taste is similar to the smell with a few exceptions. The oak note is stronger and dulls the caramel and fruity sweetness. No roasted malt notes. The molasses note is weaker in the taste and adds a nice tarty note at the end. The taste also has an overall cherry note to it. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied and a little a bit thick. While overall smooth, the beer feels like it's going down a little slower. Biting carbonation. Overall, a pretty good old ale and worth getting when you can.","HattedClassic","Apr 29, 2014"

It also comes across a little hot on the alcohol side. I know it is a strong beer, but it doesnt hide that fact well. I really think it could improve over time. If not, maybe dial it back a bit on the ABV. The alcohol is  suppressing some of the flavors. It is still a very good beer that will kick you in the ass and warm you up on a cold rainy day.","WesMantooth","Beers"

Dark fruit, oak, super clean and smooth, not overly sweet/molasses, etc., overall a really nice balance. The bitterness cuts in nicely without being overpowering. Medium body, covered the palate nicely, and had a really smooth finish. Just a strong example of a sipper that will put you in a luxurious state of mind. Get some.","Mikus","Beers"

2.8,-30.3,3.5,3.5,2.5,2,2.75,"Beer's body is medium-heavy, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a lightly foamy (1/4), mostly smooth (3/4) mouthfeel that is appropriate for sipping a beer of this style. Unfortunately, ethanol is easily felt as heat in the nostrils and across the palate, and as a burning sensation on the throat. Though "only" 9.8% ABV, this feels like a much stronger beer; ethanol not well-hidden. Closes dry, with heavy stickiness lingering on the palate and lips.","falloutsnow","Jan 16, 2014"

The flavors mellowed out a bit, the oaky flavors dropped off a bit. It seems like it is in a good balance with the sweetness, the woodiness, and the alcohol right now. Overall this is a great example of the style. Not overpowering wood aspects but it provides a nice extra note. Molasses on the other hand really comes out. Good fresh and aged and worth picking up and stashing a few away.","FreshHawk","Beers"

4.15,3.2,4,4,4.25,4.5,4,"Reddish orange color. Smells sweet with a bit of hop. Definitely different than an English style old ale, but very good. Taste is surprisingly bitter. Ends up being like a barelywine. Very good taste. Just not what I expected from my experience drinking English style old ales. Mouthfeel is fantastic. The carbonation is really where this beer shines. It gives it a creamy and viscous feel. Overall it's good!","wd40","0"

The aroma was malty with a spiciness that tickles the insides of the nose. On can even detect a faint hint of vanilla from the oak. In the initial taste, one gets the burn of spicy cinnamon, caramel, dark fruits, mild vanilla, and of course the malts. The malts bring to mind a well constructed dark bread. In the aftertaste, the spicy alcohol meshes with the dark malts to make this ale come full circle. The thickness allows the malt and alcohol to linger. With time, this old ale will mature and reward its owned. The rest of this 4 pack is going to the cellar to sleep","JohnnyHopps","Beers"

Curmudgeon pours a hazy red-orange with tons of sediment. It has a rather attractive glow though. The aroma is muted, presenting sweet toffee, oak, and honey. The taste hits with an intense sweet oak right away, along with a big sweet malt and honey presence. Sweet is the name of the game here. Surprisingly for all the sweet flavors, the aftertaste is very clean. The mouthfeel is relatively light, with a high level of carbonation for the style. The drinkability is good - probably better if you can down sweet beers quickly. Overall, Curmudgeon is a good example of a style that's never been my favorite.","shand","Apr 28, 2013"

4.32,7.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 4/6/2012. Pours fairly cloudy red-orange color with a small dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, oak, biscuit, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with great complexity and balance of malt notes with light-moderate oak character that does not overwhelm. Taste of raisin, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, biscuit, nuttiness, oak, light chocolate, light clove, floral, and toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, toffee, biscuit, molasses, oak, nuttiness, light chocolate, and light earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of malt notes with moderate oak presence; with a fair amount of hop balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible old ale! Awesome complexity and balance of malt flavor with moderate oak presence; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 24, 2013"

This is a great warm weather brew that distinguishes itself from the "refreshing" crowd that usually features citris notes. I want to age a few bottles, and see what I get.

If you like Old Ales and Barleywines but don't want the big bitterness that goes along with them then I'd recommend it.

Malty, caramel, maybe fig, sweet grapes, maple syrup notes, and more vanilla than the nose. Sweetness builds, vanilla and maple notes linger. Soft and smooth on the palate, not too carbonated, some tingle from the alcohol. Some syrupy sticky sweetness stays on. Overall, warming and fun to drink. A lot going on, but seems well blended. As it warmed, cleared and had many tiny bubbles. Also became very brandy like in character. Liking this a lot.","LeRose","Jan 04, 2013"

4.17,3.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Curmudgeon Old Ale pours an opaque amber, with some scattered straight orange highlights. A bit more than a finger of bone colored foam caps the beer. Head retention is alright, and there's just a little lacing left behind. Caramel, oak, and biscuity aromas all leap out of the glass towards my nose, with none dominating above the others. There's a prominent note of very caramelized brown sugar in the flavor profile. Waves of toffee, toasty bread, vanilla, and oak fall in to create a very layered flavor profile. The body is full, though not quite chewy, and well short of cloying. The carbonation is on the muted side, completing the picture for a solid malt forward mouthfeel. Curmudgeon is just another entry in Founders' impressive stable of malt forwars beers.","axeman9182","Nov 06, 2012"

This is a good, basic, straight-forward old ale; and, it is this bold simplicity that makes this beer so appealing to a fan of the old ale style. Also, for almost 10% ABV the alcohol is very well hidden. It is a smooth and easy drinking beer. So be careful, and enjoy.","Beer_Runner","Nov 04, 2012"

While I probably wouldn't consider this much of an old ale by my standards, it's certainly a unique beer, and I certainly enjoyed it.","Converge","0"

Taste follows the nose very similarly, except for sweetness. It's very sweet and for me, not particularly drinkable, meaning I don't think I can drink this every day. Vanilla is prominent, with malt and molasses; the sweetness somewhat masks the oak. Mouthfeel is smooth, syrupy, medium bodied, with some carbonation. Aftertaste is sweet and vanilla.

Aromas are sticky sweet with toffee, vanilla, oak, honey and biscuit. Tastes are bold and sweet, cloyingly at times. Notes of vanilla, oak, toffee, caramel, are all present with it being rather boozy, especially as it warms. Finishes with a peppery prickle on the tongue. Mouth-feel is velvety smooth and creamy.

The smoothness has fallen off a bit and now more molasses forward rather than a nice balance of vanilla, spice and hops.

Aroma is molasses, oak, HUGE malt, and actually a bit of dark fruit. Very low carbonation, and a thick viscous mouthfeel. Flavor is all malt forward with a definite oak presence. Sweet and sticky, with the sweet coming from a combination of caramel malt and some fruit flavor. Will certainly warm you with the alcohol, though it isn’t too assertive. I can appreciate the massive malt presence, but I’m not sure I believe this is "balanced", as Founders claims. Still not a huge fan of this one, but certainly better than the first bottle I had (that one got a 1.8). Up front it is a bit much, but it can grow on you a bit as you sip through","BMMillsy","Beers"

The taste reflects the aroma, with flavors of sweet malts, toasty, dark sugars, fruitcake, tangy alcohol warmth, with a tinge of citrus and hop bitterness in the finish.

4.12,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, rich, copper-ruby coloring with a good amount of bubbling in the beer that doesn't really move around much. Looks heavy. No head, but there is a ring of film around the edge of the surface. Aromas are rich and smooth, and extremely malty and layered. Some rich dark fruit and earthy highlights on the nose, also. Flavors are super smooth and rich, with a boozey, roasted, and old world fruit sweet in the backbone. Dates, raisins, and fig throughout the beer layer nicely with the heavier malt profiles of molasses. Earthy characteristics rough the beer up a bit and keep it interesting for your tastebuds. A slight peppery hopping at the end cleans the palate and prepares you to jump back in to the brew. The aftertaste is rich and slightly cloying, but pleasantly so. This one keeps stringing you along for more. The finish is rich and smooth, with a surprising cleanness at the end. Very tasty, and not overpowering despite the strong flavor profiles and increased ABV.","GarthDanielson","Mar 09, 2012"

The taste has caramel, brown sugar, more dark fruit. Booze comes through in taste, as well as some bitterness. MF is crisp, nice as it warms up, goes down fairly easy.

Smell is sweet honey caramel with some heat tingling the nose hairs. Very sweet taste. Honey is the dominant flavor, with traces of cream, caramel, sweet malt, and a touch of fruit. Quite complex. Sweetness is followed by booze for a hot finish. Very interesting overall flavor. Mouthfeel is warm and heavy, creamy-boozy, low carbonation. I like this beer.

While no part of it qualifies as offensive, there is a discordant note than is struck early on in the taste by a precocious bitterness that is awkwardly fresh in its plant-like way. Then on its heels is a similarly lively acidity; taken together, these two elements have the effect of splitting the flavor profile into asymmetrical halves. Deeper on things seem to normalize, with a remarkable complexity coming on by the finish.","beagle75","Dec 31, 2011"

4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Taste is sweet with a hint of bitterness but mostly a biting alcoholic note that really ends warm on the tongue. Makes my head fuzzy right away and fills me with warm cheer. Great brew!","Litterbean","Nov 03, 2011"
3.58,-10.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Murky brown with some sediment and a touch of light tan head that left pretty quick, perhaps cracked this a little too cold. Some spotty lacing and minimal retention. Smell is of dark fruits, raisins, carmel and burnt sugar. Taste follows more of the carmel/molasses that is very strong and a bit on the boozy end. Picked up a little fig note on the end, but reminded me of burnt carmel and hops bitterness. A decent amount of carbonation with a very thick feel on the tongue. Heavy with a hint of silk. Overall- Not my style I guess. Was wanting the booziness to give way to the rich flavors, but it was kind of over the top carmel with some hops on the end. Not sure I'll grab another. Shame because I like some other Founders offerings-","TheDinger","Nov 03, 2011"
3.87,-3.7,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall, Curmudgeon makes for a pleasant night cap, but I would probably buy Hibernation, the Ola Dubh series, and North Coast Old Stock before grabbing this one again. A serviceable Old Ale that falls short of the greats.","cratez","Oct 31, 2011"
3.53,-12.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"For me, this style is certainly hit or miss and while I don't think this was a complete miss, it wasn't a dead-on hit either. There are some really nice complexities in the beer but also some very tangent flavors. There doesn't seem to be a mastered balance in the flavor profile, but it still does have qualities that make it enjoyable.","ShanePB","Oct 30, 2011"
4.05,0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Taste is of brown sugar, caramel, maple and pretty boozy. Very sweet. Mouth-feel thick and syrupy. Alcohol is very present. Not in a bad way, just definitely a nice warming/sipping brew. Overall this is really good and enjoyable.","tfratzke","Oct 25, 2011"

Scents of dark fruits and molasses are nice if a bit weak, and there's a bit of a boozy smell too. Caramel and molasses are up front in the taste, with a punch of booziness in the finish that I don't find particularly pleasant. High pucker factor and plenty of burn going down the throat. This is not one of Founder's better offerings.","DeltaGolfSierra","Oct 05, 2011"

Aromas are spicy, bready, yeasty, malty and boozy. Slight papery or woody like character to the malt. Many dried fruit flavors, raisin, fig, plum. Lots of bready, and woody malt and caramel flavors. Spicy, boozy, oakey, bits of whiskey linger in the finish. Good rich mouth feel, a bit wet, but malty enough to balance this to make an overall medium bodied beer. Definitely some heat going in and down the hatch. Excellent brew here.","manitouman84","Oct 04, 2011"

3.72,-7.5,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured kinda hard due to the fact I knew it was an Old Ale. Lots of chunkies and yeast cake, what the hell? Off white head, deep aubern color, floating yeast matter. Pretty ugly except for the uncharicterstic lacing. Aroma of malt forward English yeast, sweet malts, and specialty malt. Some cherry notes on the aroma, but their light. Flavor, really malt forward, some caramel wait no alot of caramel, some light molasses. In addition some phenol like English yeast flavor is present. Thick under-attenuated beer, sweet, thick mouthfeel. And even a little bitter on the finish from some hops. Not bad. In the panthion of Old Ale it isn't a victory but it's ok.","pmlondrigan","Sep 28, 2011"
3.71,-7.7,4,3,4,4,3.75,"Pours a nice brown with some orange tones. There is very little head on this beer at all. There is not much of a nose to this beer; perhaps one can sense a bit of caramel, but that is it. The taste is rich and malty with an alcohol bite in the finish. The flavors become deeper as the beer warms. I think that this is a strong effort from one of the most consistent breweries in the U.S.","57md","Sep 14, 2011"
3.53,-12.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O- A good old ale that is for sure a solid beer. A little hot and nothing to special on this one, unlike it's Kieser variation, but still a good ale from a great brewery. I think the drinkability for me makes this a food pairing beer or a sipper defiantly not a session beer.","lanamj","Beers"
3.97,-1.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This is a heavy one and defiantly one that you want to sip and take your time drinking. Though for as heavy as it is, I thought it was on the smooth side with a pinch of carbonation and some stickiness. Like others have said this is a good winter beer and really should be coming out in the late fall instead of the late spring.","Dan3279","0"
3.53,-12.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall: man, I came into this beer wanting to love it, and instead I have rated it dramatically low. If you love a biscuity malt flavor; if Fat Tire is your favorite beer ever; if you ever wonder why they make anything other than Victory malt, then this beer may be for you. It is not, however, for me.","flagmantho","Sep 10, 2011"
4.12,2.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"O - A really interesting outing. Not sure if its oak-aged, but I wouldn't be surprised. The grains predominate, but there's enough going on behind it to give it a really unique and flavorful character that is highly recommended.","doopydoogle","Sep 10, 2011"

4.11,2.2,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very nice. As I continue to explore sweeter beers, I stumbled across this one perusing other reviews. My focus has been stouts/porters, trying to find best of breed in this category (in my opinion!). This one came to my attention based upon reviews I read. Perhaps I just stumbled on a unique Old Ale ... but this is right up may alley. Has all the sweetness I like, minus the hop bite of course. Guess I need to expand from stouts/porters into a new category!","Vierenner","Sep 06, 2011"
4.12,2.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Depth of flavors really interesting. I am tasting a lot of sweetness, specifically cherry-vanilla and caramel. Whopping alcohol is apparent, with an astringent note. Minimal bitterness. Aroma is boozy caramel and butterscotch. A little syrupy. Appearance is cloudy, and muddy, like liquid clay. Not for the novice ale drinker.","SkipWeathers","Sep 04, 2011"
3.45,-14.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Not a huge fan of this one, but with some age, maybe the booze will fade and the malt can become more prevalent to create a better balance. Probably my least liked beer I've had from Founders.","mocktm","Sep 02, 2011"
3.97,-1.2,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"O: solid, drinkable beer. It's not at all cloying. About right at about $10 for a 4 pack.","Holland","Aug 31, 2011"
4.12,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Really easy drinking here; other reviewers' claims of strong, biting booze don't hold true for me. Completely delicious -- I'll be buying another 4pk to cellar.","brystmar","Aug 28, 2011"
4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall I was very surprised by this. Kind of a barley wine meets the roasts of a barrel aged stout. That is a bit dramatic but not far off. Thanks to davesway10 for this extra.","azdback","Aug 25, 2011"
3.73,-7.2,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"This is basically a somewhat dulled version of Founders' Backwoods Bastard, which itself is one of the finest bourbon Scotch ales made in the US. OC has most of the same features of BB-- heavy on the apricots and butterscotch, with just enough oak to make everything fat, round and happy-- only less by about 25%. But then, this is a good deal sweeter as well. If you like Founders' Dirty Bastard or Backwoods Bastard, you'll like Old Curmudgeon. For me, it's a tad sweet but still nice to be drinking as I sit in a small house on the beach in Truro, MA, watching hurricane Irene blow north. Things could be worse.","gfreed","Aug 23, 2011"
3.9,-3,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall this is a pleasant slow-sipping beer. This style in general is not a favorite of mine, but I think this is a good representation. For price point though, I'd rather get a great DIPA or RIS.

3.65,-9.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: Without looking through my notes to be sure, I think this is my first old ale. I will search for more in this style, and am glad I tried this, but personally this particular bottle is not for me.","ONUMello","Aug 21, 2011"

3.21,-20.1,5,4,2.5,3.5,3,"D- I didn't hate this beer but it was far from what I was going for in an Old Ale. The hops really cover up most of the complexity that it might be able to have, I would like to see how it ages but I don't know where to get a bottle.","Guden","Aug 14, 2011"
3.97,-1.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall, our favorite thing about this beer was that it tasted very much like a dubbel, but with a more complex nature about the aroma. The nose was perfectly balanced to allow for the sweet components to shine through over top of the bitter roasted malt presence. Where this beer lost points was in the over the top sweetness. It is not that the sweetness was so offensive that it made the beer undesirable, however, by the end of the glass it did prove a bit overwhelming.","TheBrewo","Aug 12, 2011"
4.08,1.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall: Strongly in favor of this beer, not familiar with this style but would rate this as a strong 4.","StayWounded","Aug 03, 2011"

3.72,-7.5,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Since the body can thin out as it ages I don't see this improving much with cellaring. Maybe the complex aromas in the nose would impart into the flavor...that would be a plus...and mellow out that sensation of burnt malts. I do really like this beer, but not as an old ale. If they didn't have "Old Ale" written on the label I would have given a higher rating as I would not have reviewed against the style.","Naugros","Jul 31, 2011"

4.52,12.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"O- Really great beer, especially the rich mouthfeel. The hop-malt balance is near perfect. The only problem is I drank it way too fast, I could easily drink a few of these in a single night. Definitely worth seeking out.","MikeyMikee","Jul 31, 2011"
4.67,16.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, my favorite "old ale" because the complexities in the taste aren't overrun by the hops, or even by the bitterness (which Founders can do on certain brews) Top notch brew.","JWU","Jul 27, 2011"

I'm not a huge fan of the herbal hop character here, but all this being said, I still think this is a really solid beer, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this ages.

Smells of malt, caramel, and maybe some brown sugar. Taste is of malt, caramel, brown sugar, with a spicy hop bite. There is a little bit of bitterness that quickly fades after each sip. A very low level of carbonation makes for a thick and chewy mouthfeel that is a bit flat.

Taste is complex - it started off with a heavy character of toasted malts, sweet bread, and caramel. As the it warmed up, there was more and more strong dark fruit flavors especially plum, which combined with the alcohol gave it a somewhat boozy quality. As my palate grew more accustomed to the heavy malt bill, I noticed more of the subtle hop bitterness that was lying underneath. Palate was full-bodied, thick in texture sitting heavy in the mouth, light and soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. Not my choice from one of my favorite breweries, Founders.","CuriousMonk","May 23, 2011"

The only other Old Ale I have had was Third Coast Old Ale, so I don't have tons of experience with this style but I find it to be pretty similar to a Barleywine. For being almost 10% this beer was pretty damn drinkable, it went down a lot faster then I expected, even though the alcohol was there and a little warming it was still hidden and blended nicely with the other flavors. I would buy a four pack of this to age till the winter, this beer seems like it would make a nice big beer to drink around the fireplace during the winter, seems like this beer is more suited for a winter release. My only complaint about this beer was it's head but that is borderline nitpicking. If you like Old Ales, Barleywines, or just big beers in general this is a must try. Founders truly is the king of big beers, they just alway turn out kick ass, and thats what makes Founders one of Michigan's best brewing companys.","StoutHunter","May 19, 2011"

4.07,1.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"As I'm mulling the fact that I will likely be snowed in tomorrow, I figured I may as well reach for something to hopefully warm me up. On a recent trip to Kansas City I was excited to find some Founders. I picked up a sixer of their Old Curmudgeon. This beer pours a deep orange to brown, and is apparantly bottle conditioned. Who knew. (I did not). So the color is a little murky but I blame that more on my ameaturish pour than anything else. Not a lot of head. Smells sweet, with dark molasses and brown sugar undertones. Taste is hefty, with a very very thick mouthfeel and clearly apparant alcohol level. The amount of hops present in the beer makes it taste almost like a Barleywine, as opposed to an Old Ale as it claims to be. Beer lends itself to meandering, as it's more of a sipper than something you want to go back to. More of a "one and done" type to be enjoyed at the end of the night.","eclaycamp","Mar 17, 2011"

On the nose there are vanilla, sweet bready malts, prunes, and some slight booze. Nice to see a big barleywine-type beer in America made that doesn't taste like a cousin of a DIPA. In the mouth, a huge body carries down a slightly prickly breadiness with some vanilla and oak notes. The finish is quite long, mostly alcohol and sweet bread up on the front of the tongue.

Now at 9 months, it is quite yummy, though I can't help but wish I'd squirreled it away a bit longer. Brandy, dry oats, caramel, a tiny bit of anise. I'd like the malts to stand out a bit more, right now I'm getting that oaked-vanilla taste lingering in my mouth and the malts in the background, whereas I want them in opposite roles with the malts nestled snug above the oak... a short time did wonders for the beer, with patience this could be an excellent old ale.","nsabo","Feb 20, 2011"

Starts off a little bit sweet and I think I taste some hoppiness at the end, but it really isn't bitter at all, the aftertaste is still bit sweet. This is a thick, syrupy, sticky beer with a high alcohol content and I wouldn't want more than one in a sitting, but this is what I have come to expect from the style and I think it's delicious.","hwy61mb","Jan 20, 2011"

The aroma is very sweet with notes of caramel, golden raisins and sweet bread. There is also a bit of earthiness to it, but it's mostly just malt that I am picking up. The flavor is malty and wonderful. Plenty of caramel, brown sugar and toffee mix with a sharp hint of alcohol that works to further enhance the flavor. Also in the mix are raisins, sugary orange peel, some peppery earthiness and touch of honey. There seems to be just enough bitterness in this beer to keep it from being too malty. The mouthfeel is pretty damn impressive. It is not quite as full as one might expect, but also far from too thin. The finish a mile long, but not too sticky. A beer to savor, but a beer I would love to savor again. I am pretty sure my friend didn't purposely pick out an older bottle, but I am glad he did.

The nose comprises biscuits, walnuts, rich caramel, and a stinging underbelly of bright fruit. A healthy boozy feel slices through dully, marring the nasal proceedings. The taste continues the malty tradition set forth in the smell, in the process transmogrifying the fruit into a hoppy bitterness, strong and dull. A touch of leather rules the aftertaste. I can't call this a balanced flavor, but I won't go so far as to declare a state of koyaanisqatsi either. Hell, that damn droning is just annoying (and kinda boring after a while, too). Ahem.

Taste has a welcoming warmth of alcohol that is also solvent in flavor upfront with a sweet malty caramel backing and light citrus hop bitterness that mingles with a flavor of bitter orange rind. The hop bitterness lingers in the mouth with a bit of a resine-like piney flavor. Medium to heavy body with a light amount of carbonation. Other flavors of grain linger in the mouth. As it warms, more residual sugars come out in the taste much like dark sugar akin to caramel that has somewhat of a smokey quality about it. Overall pretty decent but doesn't have the wowing factor that I have come to expect from most Founder's offerings.","stakem","Jun 11, 2010"

The taste has a very mellow toffee and vanilla flavor, nothing sharp, quite smooth and sweet. The flavor is different from most old ales, seems to focus on vanilla. I worried that it might be cloying but it never does, very good. A moderate feel with tingly carbonation which helps cut the potential cloyingness of the brew. The ABV is no where to be found.

It is reminiscent of Nemesis 2009, but in a bad way, as the barrel aging notes and the base character of the beer are a bit similar, but the strength of flavor that, with Nemesis 2009, works so well, in this beer works to its detriment.

Medium-bodied and actually a lot lighter in its feet than one might expect given the sweetness factor. Molasses, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon and coconut cream waste no time in asserting themselves, soft and inviting, at the same time the carbonation subtly lifts things up and prods them forward. Rich peach, apricot, nectarine fruit flavors too while tangerine and pink grapefruit citrus abounds. Full finish that fills the belly and makes you want to refill the empty glass.","farrago","Nov 14, 2009"

A medium body that passes smooth with a just a little roughness - osome type of oakiness makes it go down easy with small amounts of bready and roasted malts behind a large chunk of sweet malt. Little bit of fruity hops balances this stick, slow sipper and the ABV complements it with a dry backbite. Just a quality sipper that is very enjoyable.","clayrock81","Nov 05, 2009"

I feel that the carbonation here is just to aggressive, the bubbles are fine in texture, but they just attack so vigorously that I think it takes away from the beer a bit. At first its fine, its after the brew's been in the mouth a bit, somewhere around mid palate that they all aggressively break out and assualt the palate. I think it could be toned down a bit, but by no means is this a fault, but in my opinion it could be better. This is an extremely drinkable beer, and dangerous especially on a day such as this. 60 some degrees in the middle of summer, breezy out, refreshing air, the smell of fall in the wind...it would be real easy to get real wasted easily with this one in hand.

The roof of the mouth gets a sense of the level of alcohol, however, the alcohol level is not fully evident. Thus "caveat bibor" is appropriate. This is not a session beer or a vorspiel beer. Medium body with a sweet, long lingering. This is a multidimensional old ale. If I had the patience and cellar, I would attempt to age the Old Curmudgeon a few years to see how it develops. It should age well. A great ale to accompany hearty food and BBQ. The richness and residual sweetness would also work well with spicy food.","carlborch","Jun 30, 2009"

It tasted like honey wheat, toffee, raisins and prunes, and a bit of copper and orange and alcohol. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a mild bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a pretty good old ale with a nice, malty taste that was sweet but not over the top. It had good body too, and kept the alcohol mostly in check. So this was pretty easy to drink fresh, but I can easily see this improving with some age (1-3 years...maybe longer?). This is a solid beer, although it's not my favorite for this style.

Lots of spicy hop flavor and bitterness, balanced by fruity alcohol and a chewy, complex maltiness that imparts ripe raisin and sweet, dark bread.

Tastes burnt without that flavor dominating, it adds sort of an oaked sensation to it. Also reinforced by a whiskey-like bite to it at the end, as well as a whiskey-smokeyness after in the throat. Hops bitter towards the end of the palate, there for bittering effect to balance out the sweetness, and don't really add the taste of pine or another particular hop taste. Mouthful is thick and syrupy, it coats the palate and doesn't want to let go. Big bodied beer. A nice sipper, but the heavy presence of hard liquors/alcohol, combined with the harshness of the other flavors prevent this from being more than that.

Strong scent, but it's a hodge-podge of aromas; a huge maltiness with an interesting hop scent, with hints of cinnamon, caramel, and jerky, as well as alcohol. Strong, deep taste, but it has an odd varnish flavor to it, to go along with a deep pine malt. Goes down fine, with a bit of alcohol roughness. Not the best old ale I've ever had, or the best Founders; although I would never turn one down, either.","JamesS","Dec 27, 2008"

I would only really 'enjoy' one of these in a sitting. I also rated it a little lower because if I didn't know any better (I guess if I was illiterate) I would have sworn this was a Barleywine opposed to an Old Ale - even though they are similar styles.

Malt sweetness blanketing a somewhat juicy, citrusy hop character underneath. Holy mother, more of the same for the taste. Lots of vanilla sweetness to the point that it's overbearing and masks the rest of the brew. A bit spicy and warming for sure. Big, full, and creamy in the mouth. A faint burn but not in an entirely distracting sort of way. The bourbon essence is just too much for me. I can handle one and one only, if that.

A little bit young I think, I bet the other three will age very nicely. Right now I'd say the Ola Dubh version I've had are a little bit better, but they're aged. This should have no problem competing with some age and at a bargain of a price comparitively.

Rum, dates, leather, and gooey caramel to start things off in the mouth followed by tingling hops. Toffee and bark flavors emerge midway finishing with a lingering vanilla bean sweetness.

The beer poured out showing a strikingly perfect color for my tastes in a beer like this: a blend of brown caramel and burnt pumpkin orange colors surrounded the glass while at an angle looking upwards towards the thin head I see a deeper brown, almost like a stained mahogany. I know this is a "thick" beer and I haven't had a taste. Smell was of slight vanilla, caramel and raisin. No single smell seemed outright dominant. Extremely pleasurable smell in this beer. Upon first taste I am almost overwhelmed. First opinion was that this was indeed a "thick" beer. The mouthfeel was a tad surprising at first but soon I adjusted and the thickness of the beer was preferred. I soon realized how wonderfully balanced tasting a beer of this complexity is. Malty to my tastes, but not in a bad way. Just the right amount of caramel and mild malt balances things out by cutting the smack you get from the strength of the beer. This makes this beer very, very drinkable despite the punch it packs. I'm not 100% sold that I want a beer with this much action in the mouthfeel (initial lip hit, tongue fall of the beer, the follow-up coating of the tongue with thickness of the malt) but if you know you want an Old Ale, this has to come recommended. I think this is a solid A- on my personal scale. Only reason I say it can improve is the mouthfeel to me at this young age is still really thick. I have 3/4 of the pack down in the cellar for aging. I strongly believe this is a candidate with some aging and will be researching to see just how long people have been holding this for.","jerrytrey","Dec 08, 2008"

There is also a nice hot alcohol finish. The mouthfeel is a touch lighter than full bodied, with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a wonderful old ale.

3.9,-3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"I saw the bartender pour it straight from the tap and it looked like he was pouring a slow thick molasses into my pint glass. When the beer settled, I saw that it was a hazy cranberry orange color. It had more cranberry than orange in it. On top of this hazy brew was a good 1/2 an inch head of pure white foam. This head of foam had decent retention that left behind a long lasting skim of white foam, a small string of white rings, and one streak of white lace. The aroma was no joke! This Old Ale was on the sweet side with roasted wheat, plenty of sweet black cherries, a touch of caramel, a subtle hint of grapefruit, lightly roasted pine needles, and a few dried herbal hops at the end. The taste was messing around either. The taste kicks off on the sweet side with toasted caramel malts, a speck of roasted wheat, and a splash of dried black cherries. Then after the black cherries leave the tongue, the taste then goes dry, bitter, and alcoholic with dried citrus hops, a few dried citrus fruits, quite a few pine needles, and a big bite of alcohol. Sometimes the hops and alcohol will mix together to make the taste a little harsh to drink. This was clearly a full bodied beer with a strong full flavored aftertaste of dried citrus hops, black cherries, a gentle touch of caramel, and plenty of alcohol. This strong aftertaste will linger on for some time. This beer doesn't even try to mask its high alcohol content. It was a nice lightly sweet big beer, but like I said before, it can get a little harsh to drink sometimes. Be careful with one. Take your time sipping this big beer.","AltBock","Nov 28, 2008"

Heavy dry yeast tone with a soothing alcohol burn at 9.3%. Mouthfeel is full bodied yet doesn't hit the viscous level on my texture scale. Carbonation is natural smooth and cleansing between the brash bitterness and dry yeast profile. Ending notes on the palate are a blend of excessive malts and bitter earthy hop, great stuff.

Including the other famous Michigan version, this beats the pants off the Third Coast Old Ale, grab a Drew Estates Natural cigar and a four pack of this for an Old World experience.","WVbeergeek","Oct 01, 2008"

Not quite opaque, as there was some light penetration, put extremely diminished clarity. Quarter inch off-white cap quickly dissipated into a swirly skim. Nose is pretty incredible; wonderful complexity. Picked up vanilla, bourbon, caramel and oak on this one straight out of the bottle. Taste consistent with nose, but some more booziness comes out as well as a mild dark fruit character. Really quite tasty (I had a hard time deciding between a 4 & a 4.5 on this one). Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a light-effervescent tingle. Some viscousness to the body, but not overwhelmingly so. Definitely a sipper, but very pleasurable to drink and savor as it warms.

The head is off white, retains a bit, not much lacing. The aroma is profoundly whisky alcohol, dark and heavy fruits, such as fig, rind, apricot, raisin. This is a full bodied beer, quite syrupy in consistency, and just plain thick and overly sweet. There is also an oaky aged quality to the beer. The taste mimics the aroma. You'll get the full gamut of heavy fruit flavors, a cloying candied sugar sweetness, and a syrupy thickness that is just over the top, and that oaky aged quality that is more apt in a bourbon. The killer for me is the alcohol throaty burn. I feel like I'm drinking a sweet whisky drink and it just burns on the way down. This is the type of beer that leaves me with a heartburn afterwards. It's just not drinkable as a beer. For a 9.3% ABV, this tastes like it is thrice that much. Way too much alcohol, and not my cup of tea at all. It's too bad, because the beer does have its virtues, just not as it is presently consistituted. The aftertaste is just doing me in.

Quite vinous, with raisins and a sort of acidic aftertaste. Again, principally strong toffee malt but with a nice fruity background as well. A highly sweet beer, and fairly alcoholic (the 9.3% is fairly well hidden in the fruit and spiciness though). Body is medium with very mild, smooth carbonation, as is fairly standard for the style (and for a beer this high in alcohol).

Taste is right along the same lines, with the maple syrup and raisins shining the most...is very sweet and sugary. Body is full and isn't afraid to throw its weight around with the alcohol. It is there and you will know it after a bottle. Great beer, but the intense flavors and in your face alcohol make it a difficult beer to drink.

The coconut flavor overwhelms the smell of the beer. Taste is a little better. Hops, then raw coconut and vanilla, followed by a heavy alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is heavy, but lightly carbonated.

The closest beer I can think to compare this to is Avery's Samael's Oak Aged Ale. This doesn't come close in pleasantness though, it lacks all the pleasant fruit flavors and has a shitload of butter. It also reminds me a bit of Weyerbacher's Prophecy, but not as offensive, at least in my opnion anyway. This is just way too buttery throughout. If you like drinking bourbon butter, then drink this. Otherwise avoid it.","mrasskicktastic","Nov 23, 2006"

The caramel is there, along with alcohol, and not much bitterness - just a little in the aftertaste. In the mouth it's good - creamy, smooth, and thick. Nice.

4.03,0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"12 oz stubby. I had this one a while ago and thought it needed some time, so we'll see where it falls now. It pours a deep deep tea brown color with golden to amber highlites. A light head falls to an almost full coat over top with a solid ring. What I expected. The aroma brings lots of malt. There are incredibly deep caramel tones with a kiss of raisin fruityness and brown sugar. This definately is focused on the caramel and brown sugar with fruityness being in the background. I like it. There is a light kiss of alcohol in there too, but it adds a light spiceyness as opposed to a boozeyness. Flavors are along the lines of the nose. I find deep caramel and brown sugar, with a moderate earthy hop playing well with it. There is a modest bitter on the finish with a fairly prominent puff of alcohol that hits in my nostrils. Again, this is not offensive, but just present. There is a nice solidness about the flavor...the best I can do is to call it deep. The feel is thick with a light slickness and a very light carbonation. I'm not a fan of the slickness. It pulls a little bit of the thick feel away from the beer. This one definately carries the 9+% with it. I will sip this over the next hour or so and I won't be having anything more after it. I enjoy the flavors and aromas. I think there is a little more blending that will happen after another 6 months with this one.","kmpitz2","Sep 07, 2006"

Taste follows suit although has a little more going on. There is a sweet grape-raisin flavor along with nice sugary caramel sweetness.

Head quickly fades to an uneven layer of bubbles, and lacing is average, both somewhat expected for the style. Aroma is vanilla oaky alcohol, possibly over the top, but the variety of flavors is enough to possibly overcome the somewhat exceptional intensity. Taste is also vanilla and oak, with strong alcohol throughout and a warming close. Wish there was a bit more of a malt sweetness background to support all the strong flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth, even if the drinkability is somewhat limited by the flavor harshness, in my mind. Age might help this mellow a bit and make a winner.","ppoitras","Aug 01, 2006"

In the glass the two mesh equally and a bit of floral hops lays beneath. The body is opaque and brown/amber in color. It had a head the size of a quarter, but only very briefly. The fore is a blast of smooth sweet malts and bourbon...lots of bourbon. Oak, vanilla (combining to coconut) and the faintest traces of sweet tropical fruits follow. I want to know where these bourbon barrels came from. Tastes a lot like a a bourbon with melted ice, but the thick palate and smooth malt undertones keep it from getting too far down the road away from the realm of beer.

4.74,17.9,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"The bottom line: A nice effort by Founders...truly distinct from the other old ales that are out there with a beautiful oak cask flavour that is worth trying out. One of my favourites from Founders, and I've had most of their portfolio on multiple occasions. In terms of its style, it's my favourite domestic offering, and the taste chracteristics here are almost scotch like in certain ways, which is, of course, excellent. If you like ole ales you must try this.","CortexBomb","May 11, 2006"

4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very deep amber color with tons of ruby highlights. A small cream colored head forms, but leaves quickly, leaving some spotty lacing. Very hazy. This beer reminds me of Jolly Pumpkin's Biere de Mars, but heavier on the alcohol. Boozy, oaky, malts are the aromas that really jump out at you. Some tropical fruit smells and spices are also swirling around. Taste mimics the smell, heavy on the malts, oak and booze. Finishes with a slight hoppy bitterness. Semi sweet. To me, a complex beer, that reveals more as it warms. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, with adequate carbonation. Kinda heavy, a definite sipper. I really enjoyed this beer, it might take some time for this one to grow on people. I have a couple bottles to age and compare notes. Give this one a shot! Another great beer, from my favorite brewery!","BigDaddyWil","0"

4.43,10.2,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"On tap at Pizza Plant on Transit in Williamsville, NY. Awesome, since I've never seen any Founders beers anywhere in WNY. Served in a goblet. Hazy mahogany. Thin but dense beige cap. Utterly beautiful sticky lacing. Nose is quite faint: roasty caramel malts, bourbon, fruity esters, mild citrusy-floral hops. Port-like flavor; rum-soaked citrus peels, piney bitterness all on a sturdy cherry and caramel malt platform. 9.3% abv is apparent, but not inappropriately so. Rich, full mouthfeel; medium bodied and assertive. This is really tasty stuff, but the alcohol strength is definitely of the ass-kicking variety. I'd love to have more than one of these, but it would require that I have a DD. Top notch.","orfeu","Aug 31, 2005"
4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"On-tap at Pizza Plant Transit. It was so good it was as if it was brewed right here. Dark boddy with thin head. Stouty roast aroma. Hoppy and spicy. Medium-full body. I like the style, it's more drinkable than a barleywine. The understated carbonation at this location does it justice.","Sammy","Beers"
4.05,0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability: The good malty base, rich fruity sweet combo and nice toasty tang make this a very tasty brew. The waitress/barmaid told me this was a brown ale, but perhaps she was mistaken.","BrewMaster","0"
