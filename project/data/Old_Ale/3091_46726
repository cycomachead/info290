Pours a clear sepia with a nice fluffy and fine-bubbled wheat head. Malty flavor has a strong cocoa overtone, which I found rather enjoyable. I detected hints of apple and caramel as well. Texture has firm body and good fizz, leaving a malty and chocolaty finish. This is a good beer for the fall, when the leaves are turning and it’s time to break out the down comforter.","Cyberkedi","Dec 05, 2014"

I think a chocolate version of the Old Tom would be a nice beer, but they need to beef these up with more malt, more body, and more flavor.

3.8,7.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,"a variation on the classic old tom, i like this chocolate version for two reasons. the first is its lower alcohol lends to easy drinking. i could have many of these without losing my cool, which counts for a lot with a winter beer like this one. second, its not the least bit sweet, and is in fact shockingly dry, which also lends to greater drinkability and is a marked departure from the other chocolate ales out there. as an old ale, its less than remarkable though, not as malt driven or full bodied as it could be, but with the chocolate it just works. good toast to it all, bakers chocolate meets milk chocolate without the sugar, and the carbonation is light but the beer froths up nicely on the palate. a well refined brew, steeped in tradition yet modernized in a very appropriate way. something quite unique, fairly priced, and outstanding in winter weather.","StonedTrippin","Jan 23, 2014"

3.71,4.8,3.75,4.5,3.75,2,3.5,"Overall - I'm not completely sold on this beer. Its quirky flavor might have worked, but the uber thin body undercuts any potential. There's a bottling code of L1312, which I assume is a date of December '13. Based on web gathered info from the net, this is a best before date, and Old Tom has an 18-month freshness window. If my assumptions are correct, this beer could be nearly 2 years old. This might account for the weak and lifeless mouthfeel. If so, my main hesitation toward buying imports is yet again reaffirmed.","TheSixthRing","Jan 04, 2014"

The nose comprises cocoa, molasses, light clove, light cinnamon, light roasted malts, light oak, and a touch of black tea. Things are a bit more ephemeral than the Old Tom, though thankfully still quite pleasant. The taste brings in more of the same, with the emphasis decidedly on the cocoa, which now takes on a powdery character. There's also a slightly deeper roast, a pinch of black pepper, and a hint of dark fruits way in the background. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice beer, one that shows you can go crazy with chocolate without overdoing it or completely overshadowing every other flavor.","TMoney2591","Oct 05, 2012"

It's an odd brew - the chocolate and strong ale flavours don't entirely blend or complement each other, yet it seems to work nonetheless. It's different from every other chocolate beer I've tried; the usual pairing is dark roasted malt and chocolate, which results in a deep bitterness that is absent here. It's not as good as the original Old Tom, but goes down nicely. To summarise: unusual but tasty. Worth trying if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","0"

What's really remarkable about the beer is it's aroma...it's an intense mix of both vanilla and chocolate. At times one or the other seem to dominate, but they are the cornerstone scents of this beer. The chocolate is reminiscent of sweet, fine, chocolate powder (think an up-market version of nestle quick). Following the primary scents, there is a little toasted malt character, and very little (almost no) hop smells. The flavor is interesting...the same qualities that are present in the smell, but significantly muted. The beer is not nearly as sweet the aroma telegraphed. Lots of malt flavor, which pair nicely with the chocolate. The beer dries out by the finish, which does have a firm bitterness for balance. It's not the kind of beer that I'd have more than one at a sitting, but it is worth a try.","Suds","Beers"
3.81,7.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.0%. Mahogany coloured beer with a thick off-white to beige head. Strong and dominant sweetish aroma of chocolate and vanilla, not unpleasant, but pretty close ... The flavour has loads of cocoa and vanilla, on a malty base with some vinous notes, but the beer is not nearly as sweet as the aroma made me fear. There are some moderate hops in the finish. This is a nice change-of-pace beer, but I would normally prefer the ""ordinary"" Old Tom.","Sigmund","0"
