4.59,21.8,5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this is quite reminiscent of a Belgian dark ale. But a Belgian dark. It isn't quite as yeasty an stacked up with fruit esters as a Belgian dark ale, but one can easily find the similarities in the rich dark fruits, spiciness, breadiness, and booze. The ale is of a very good quality, you can easily tell and it is also quite a bit better than some belgian dark ales that I have had. I would drink this again and am actually pretty interested in having the chocolate beer they do as well.","Misanthropy_Sipping","Apr 24, 2014"

3.78,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, L1298 bottle code. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, molasses, raisin, apple, toast, dark bread, light nuttiness, earth, pepper, herbal, and light phenolic esters. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, molasses, toast, dark bread, chocolate, apple, raisin, light nuttiness, earth, toffee, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, dark fruit, apple, toast, biscuit, earth, toffee, nuttiness, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; almost no cloying flavors present on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good old ale. Nice flavor complexity, robustness, and balance; very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 16, 2012"

3.94,4.5,5,3.5,4,4,4,"Strong, malty aroma has a firm fruity overtone, mainly apple with a hint of banana, and touches of caramel, yeast and - varnish? Actually the latter is not really bad. Pours a dark reddish amber, almost mahogany, with a thick and fluffy pale golden tan head. Very appealing! Flavor has a strong malty core and notes of apple, banana and caramel. That darn varnish-like taste pops up, though. Smooth, firm texture has plenty of fizz and leaves a lasting tingle. Finish is malty and fruity. This ale is the cat’s meow!","Cyberkedi","0"

Booze well hidden until the finish where it burned slightly, finish also had a note of espresso. Medium body, very smooth, not much carbonation. Overall a malt forward strong ale, complex but not in the extreme. Could be very good if given a year or two to age.","jonb5","Jul 22, 2012"
