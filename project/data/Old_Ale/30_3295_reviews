"Poured a deep clear reddish brown body with a thin cap of head. Overall impression of appearance is true to style, quite nice. Scents of rich, sweet malt with notes of caramel, molasses, toffee, raisin and fruitcake in the foreground, supported by aromas of nutty malt, hazelnuts and coffee in the background with a mild warm alcohol also present. Overall impression of aroma is of a true to form, very complex example of an Old Ale. Malty, rich and warming. Very well done. Flavor begins malty sweet with notes of hazelnut, caramel and molasses upfront with medium-low levels of vinous and sweet fruity esters and a light roasted malt and chocolate presence. Middle continues these flavors, picking up more pronounced notes of raisins and hazelnuts, alongside a slight warming alcohol. Finish is sweet with notes of raisins, vinous flavors, caramel, molasses, light nuttiness and medium-light bitterness from roasted malt contributing flavors of coffee and chocolate and a light warming alcohol. Aftertaste is lightly bitter and nutty with notes of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and hazelnuts. Overall impression of flavor is of a nice Old Ale, one that fits well to style, with just a touch higher bitterness than is usual. Still a good example of the style and quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy, with low carbonation and a sticky feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very true to style Old Ale. Overall this is a fantastic Old Ale. It has a pleasant aroma and a very nice flavor, aided by a pleasing mouthfeel. A very nice Winter ale, one of the better examples of the style."

"Overall: a hearty and tasty brew, this definitely fits the definition of a ""winter warmer"". Excellent to sip on a frigid winter night."

"Brown to dark brown with a fair amount of light still permeating the glass.  A fingernail of beige head coats the top almost entirely.  I smell caramel and toffee.  I taste caramel and mocha in this rich winter warmer.  The body is chewy and lightly sticky."

"Had this poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Color was a rich brown, average head, not a ton of lacing. The flavor had a pretty strong boozy finish after notes of brown sugar and malt. The mouthfeel was smooth, very pleasant. Not bad."

"Very good. Dark, smooth and balanced. Tastes terrific paired with gingersnap cookies."

"My experience with Old Ales is limited but from what I have experienced I found this beer to be very well done.  In my opinion the nose was not off the chart but the real experience is when I began to sip it.  The beer poured very dark and looked appealing from the get go.  It had a good amount of carbonation and mouthfeel to make it enjoyable and lively.  The malts kept this beer at a enjoyable sweetness level without pushing it into a desert beer category.  I did not think the alcohol was ""hot"" and was masked by the beer.  The beer changed in a favorable way for me as the beer warmed.  The bitterness was very mild.  Normally I am disappointed by some seasonable/holiday brews but what started as a single bottle turned into a trip for a six pack for me.  Very well done!"

"Gets better as it warms.  Had to come back to re-rate it."

"I was very whelmed with this beer.... just whelmed. It's a pretty decent example of an old ale. In my opinion, nothing really stands out about this beer. Maybe I'm just expecting too much out of the style/my palate is spoiled by so many good RIS's...... It just needed to have a bit more punch for me. If it were a bit cheaper I think I'd be a little less critical but I've mostly seen all Avery beer checking in at around $10-11 a six. I've been unimpressed with all the Avery offerings that come in a pack and not a bomber, just my honest opinion."

"This is rather dry and definitely warming to the chest. Depending on your particular taste this is a very good winter warmer."
"Solid ""go to"" winter warmer. Gotta have at least a sixer every December!"

"This is typically a favorite style for me so I had some expectation coming in.  I was disappointed, there was something that just did not work.  The beer just did not seem balanced.  It did improve a little as it warmed which saved it from a lower rating.  Okay, but nothing special."

"really nicely balanced, slightly sweet with cherry like malt.  a little spice like a winter warmer.  definitely a good winter beer and not cloying, or overly sweet, spicy or anything.  not all that nutmeg cinnamon nonsense.  considered an Old Ale.  not really that hoppy like an American old ale.  maybe more like an English old ale?  not really sure"

"Very good winter beer. I feel like it takes the Samuel Smith brew and keys in everywhere that needs to be keyed in until they got an even better beer. Well done."
""
"Overall - It's no North Coast Old Stock, but few brews are! It's enjoyable as is; a laid back, well-attuned brew that's easier to drink than that 8.3% label would have one believe. I bought a single, but I'm seriously considering picking up a sixer before season's end."

"BOD 267/14.  Dark amber pour with a very deep dark ruby cast.  Below average head, lacing and retention.  Subtle, but nice, nose of dark fruit (plums, figs) over a biscuit like sweet base with strong caramel notes.  Almost medium body with a slickness that becomes more pronounced as it warms.  Above average carbonation with some effervescence in the middle and finish.  The flavor profile is intense, very complex and well balanced until the finish. It begins with a smooth blend of flavors that tend to cascade to the forefront.  Sweet biscuit and caramel begin, then yield to the dark fruit over a very mild toffee note.  The middle is mildly bitter with a citric rind like note that fades into bitter dark chocolate. The long finish is where the alcohol comes to the forefront, but is somewhat masked by a residual sweetness.  A grain alcohol like aftertaste lingers."

"This is a really nice winter warmer.  Had it on a cold night with a buffalo burger and it paired very nicely.  8.3% is a little high for the alcohol content, but Avery seems to like that sort of thing, so I went with it.  Nice and dark and roasty, not at all bitter despite the 45 IBUs, but not overly sweetened by the malts.  Definitely a fan of this one, and it's among Avery's best beers."

"It comes off like a stock winter warmer barleywine, and love the classic integrated winter warmer sensing flavors and character. Somewhere in between, real memorable and nice. Great to go back to these old classics."

"12 ounce bottle, a friend gave a bottle of this to me a month or so ago so I assume it's from this past winter's batch. Served in a DFH Signature glass, the beer pours a murky brown color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is nice and malty, the brew smells like caramel, toffee, nuts, and some chocolate. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some dark fruit, brown sugar and dark bread flavors noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and smooth with moderate carbonation. I liked this, it's good on a summer day and would probably be good on a winter's day too!"
""
""
""
""
"An interesting take on the style. Not as dense and oily as some but has a nice, crisp mouthfeel. More carbonated than I expected. Color is a dark nutty brown. Scent is toffee, caramel, and honey. I'm surprised it's not rated higher here. It's a big, flavorful beer that's surprisingly drinkable for an old ale. I'd love to have this after a fall day raking leaves."

"Bottle from last fall. Label says cellarable upto 3 years. Pours clear mahogany with nice firm head with lacing that sticks to glass sides. Tastes of toffee, hazelnuts and mocha just like the label describes. Some alcohol warmth in the nose. Brown sugar & candied chocolate. Feels medium full. Ample bitterness with lingering sweetness. A very nice beer overall. Satisfying in the winter. A nice treat to sub as dessert in the warmer months."

"O: The assertive hopping was a bit of a surprise, but a welcome one. This beer perfectly fits its winter seasonal role. Rich, robust, and warming. No need to kill a beer like this with spices. A pleasure to sip, and an excellent buy at an approachable price in the six pack. Cellars very well to boot."

"Pour is deep ruby red, transparent, with a tan head and fair bit of lacing. Nose is salty and meaty. A bit of berry and malt sweetness, slightly oxidized in back. Taste is more sweet, tinge of alcohol, faint herbal hop. Seems a hint sugary with some brown sugar and caramel lingering. Medium body, soft carbonation, a hint slick."

"O: A great old ale in a six pack. I love that this isn't a pricey bomber and its well executed. Tons of figgy goodness with cherries, booze and spice. A nice holiday treat."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/8/2013. Pours moderately cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, plum, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, brown bread, pepper, herbal, floral, light chocolate, light roast, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, biscuit, raisin, plum, brown sugar, brown bread, pepper, herbal, floral, light chocolate, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, brown sugar, raisin, plum, pepper, herbal, floral, light chocolate, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy/spicy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick, bready, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice old ale style. Good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and herbal/spicy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Bottle from Gator Beverage. Pours murky brownish purple with a half finger of creamy off white head. Aroma is chocolate, figs, molasses, sweet malt, prunes. Flavor is big dark fruit notes with plums and figs, molasses, just a hint of chocolate, some brown sugar, black cherry. Mouthfeel is medium heavy with medium carbonation and light bitterness on the finish. Overall a nice malt bomb that would be warming on a cold winter day. Good stuff."

"This beer lacked some balance or the parts quite didn't match. I believe Avery tried to turbinate this Old Ale, but it did not work out well, it came out too sweet."
""
"Overall: I am a big fan of the old ales. but the flavors in this one just don't suit me. not enough malty sweetness."
""
""
""
"An okay beer. The flavor is rather disjointed and the mouthfeel is surprisingly weak for the style. There is a wide variety of flavors to pick out, all suggesting the style, but things just don't quite mesh overall."
""
"A decent British style ale."
""
""
"Overall: A very enjoyable old ale beer. Sometimes it is good to refresh my tastes buds of this style I really don't see much of. Thanks Avery for bringing this back every year."
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer it, has a mahogany color body with a very small head. Ths aroma has a dark fruit and cherry smell to it. The taste has a deep dark fruit taste and some sweetness also. The mouthfeel is nice and overall a good sippin beer. This isn't my favorite style, but this is one of the better ones I have had."

"From my tasting notes: The Old Jubilation was definitely big on the malt both in the sweet aroma and the initial caramel, dark chocolate taste. It was a nice big beer with a hint of booze that will easily keep you warm during these cold winter days. This beer leans more on the malty side and says it has no spices, which is a big plus for me. It is definitely a beer to look forward to each Holiday season."

"Not the most complex or layered old ale but it is balanced, flavorful and sessionable despite the ABV. My only regret is not having tried it sooner, good one Avery."

"O - a little thin and a little to boozy to be ideal, really nice sweet flavors though"
""
""
""
""
"I immediately wanted another. This was pretty great, especially on a particularly brisk fall day in Philadelphia."
"Pour a dark orange-amber and smells of dates and dried fruits. Mouthfeel is quite nice with appropriate carbonation. The taste is where this beer shines. An excellent example of the old ale style with heavy malt and a dark fruity taste. Overall, I enjoy this beer quite a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decently well-rounded old ale, with winter warming aspects, that isn't too sweet. Complex and enjoyable, what with the elevated ABV keeping mostly to itself. I'm glad to be stateside, not in summertime, so that I finally get to try these kinds of offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A solid example of an old ale. And it seems to be still drinking great even after 10+months. A wouldn't mind a touch more sweetness and a little less earthiness, but still a beer I'd drink again."

""
"Overall:Saw a six-pack of this asking for me to buy it just a week ago at my local beer shop and though I can't say too much about this beer but then again I can't say too little...it's subtle and hit's you in the end. That is definitely when you appreciate this ""winter warmer"". This beer plus your favorite glass equals one pretty good time. Salud!"

"The Old Jubilation is a big strong beer and I probably did not try it at the best time. I was having lunch at our local watering hole and it was a warmer day , which I think plays against strong ales. The beer poured a rich deep amber color with thick foamy head that laced. The smell was like a dark malt and alcohol. The taste was malty mix that seemed to give the presence of subtle spices like a cinnamon, ginger, etc. along with big alcohol. The mouthfeel was full body with smooth carbonation. Overall it was ok....not a huge fan of strong ales."
"Overall, a very good winter ale."

"O: decent brew and I enjoy the take on the holiday season with the addition of the nuttiness. just a bit off balance, but its still a nice drinkable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as much character as I recall from the bottle. More bitter than anything, which is surprising for the style. Lacking in big flavor and esters."
""
""
"O: Really good brew -- this is a 2011 Vintage. So, ages well -- I think it gets extra points for that. Great smell, nice flavor -- this is a good one from Avery."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good example of an Old Ale. The taste was less complex than I was hoping for, but not bad."
""
""
""
""
"I've never tasted bullion hops, but I get a hot, piney flavor, like that of an evil pineapple. In a way, it reminds me of Chinook, as it has some grapefruit and a distinctive note that I can only describe as cat piss."
""
""
""
""
"Overall even though this beer isn't classified as a winter warmer, to me this is what all winter warmers should taste like. Really nice drinkable beer."
""
""
""
"Dark carmel color with thick foam. Nice lacing that hung on. Scents of chocolate, caramel, and some slight grassy citrus aroma. Taste hits you right away. Extremely smooth, medium chocolate flavors with toasted barleys. Really smooth - could knock back several of these. High alcohol content makes 3-4 just perfect."
"O: A fine Strong Ale and Winter Warmer, although not a favorite."
""
"Old Jubilation pours a muddy brown-red color with a small head. The aroma is malty, boozy, and slightly fruity. To attempt to get notes further than that is an effort in futility. The taste also hints at complexity that never quite makes it's way out behind the thick wall of lightly roasted malt and fruit. A very light booziness and a light amount of citrusy hops adds a bit of life to the beer. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, Old Jubilation is a good beer. It's best aspect is probably it's drinkability, this goes down very easily for the relatively high ABV and strong malt flavors."
""

"O: Not a bad beer, just average. I am not sure I would buy this beer again but I wouldn't discourage the purchase."

"Bready, toasted, caramel, nutty. Alcohol is present, almost rum like. Hop bitterness is mild-medium. Dark roasted finish. Body is full, warmth, semi-dry, easy drinking."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good winter beer. Really nice use of malts that give a complex mix of flavors. Sweetness and body is just right."
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Pours deep, dark amber accented with copper highlights and capped with a fluffy off-white one and a half finger head. Average retention and some light lacing evident. Light cocoa, toffee, malt, and dark fruit on the nose. Fairly complex, caramel, molasses, raisins, plum, some anise, and finishes with a citric note and a note of warming alcohol. Semi-dry, medium bodied, smooth with a hint of syrup. Moderate carbonation. Very enjoyable and easy drinking."
""

"Notes: A great malty backbone mixed in with good drinkabilty and quite good for a cold night. Cheers."

"O: Seasonal beers can be very interpretative. I would recommend this beer for people who enjoy beers with a more roasted and malty character. A person who enjoys Rauchbiers or Stouts would undoubtedly like this. It would go well with seared meats or sharp cheddar cheeses. I enjoyed the beer, especially because it was a different take on a Christmas beer. I felt that it could have been a little bit thicker on the mouthfeel."
"I'm pleasantly surprised and impressed. Good stuff."
"Pours a dark brown but yet opaque enough to see through. Two finger ivory colored head. Solid mouthfeel. Smell is awesome - all malts - rich, dark, some chocolate. Flavor reveals more of the same. I really appreciate this take on a holiday brew - no crazy spices - just a nice, thick, quality beer for warming up with by the fireside."
"Overall: Very tasty…the dark, bready malts do dominate and are accented by the candy, sugar sweetness…the aroma brings a bit more than the actual taste does, I’m not getting all the toffee or chocolate that my nose picks up…the flavor though is solid and very drinkable, but I think it could be taken a step farther and would really separate itself from the others in this class…the spices do warm my belly and the higher alcohol content (which the flavor does mask) is more evident as I drink more and it gets a bit closer to room temp…great seasonal ale flavor, recommended for your consumption…"
""
""
""
"Opened a 2011 vintage on 11-25-12. What a difference a year makes! This is a totally different beer from when I purchased a year ago. The strong coffee and anise flavors meld nicy together into brown sugar and caramel. Do your self a favor and buy a six pack for 2013/2014."

"O: Overall, probably the biggest disappointment of the season so far. Not bad, but not much of an old ale. Mainly just roasted malt with a little bit of hop bitterness on the finish, more of an extra roasty brown ale than an old ale in my book, which is disappointing. Its not bad, but with so many great winter seasonals I dont think this is one I would have again."
""
""
""
"O-Not a bad effort. It was a touch sweet and a little more spice would have balanced things out, but the alcohol was well-integrated and the flavors pleasant. All in all, this was a worthy winter-style brew that worked well for dessert."
""
""
"O: This is an enjoyable and pretty easy to drink winter beer, though I would recommend sipping this beer rather than drinking it more quickly. Nice complexity to the flavors and smells as the beer warms up."
""
""
""
""
"Medium-full mouthfeel, smooth carbonation, creamy, pleasing feel overall. Maybe not the heights of depth and complexity for this style but it's quite nice and an apt seasonal selection for a cold evening."
""
""
"This is a good beer...one to drink on a cold winter's night. Nice job as usual Avery."
"O: If you are looking for a beer to ruminate about for hours on end about how it is like an onion that you peel and there is another layer then you ain't gonna dig this beer. If you are looking for an Old Ale/Winter Warmer that is all about comfort food like rich, sweet, malty goodness with a cleansing aftertaste then pull up a stool and grab a glass. This puppy is going to warm your tummy on a cold winter's night."
""
"Pours a somewhat murky dark brown with a foamy orange-beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, roasted nuts, slight cocoa, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with a high level of roasty bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat and gritty mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer with a nice smell but the flavor is not all that good in my opinion."
"O - An average, not bad not great brew. I enjoyed it, but didn't love it. I bought a six pack, I'll drink a couple over the next couple weeks and put 2-3 down for a couple months just to see what happens. Barring some unforeseen improvement with age (given lack of complexity, I do t expect it), I probably won't revisit. Glad to try it, just wanted a little bigger complex brew."
"On tap at my job. Pours up a mahogany clear coloration with an extremely nice off white head. Stayed with it throughout the entire ride. Good lacing. Reminds me of your mom. Aroma is malts and spices. Taste is the same but bigger, also caramel, some kind of nut, floral and slight citrus hops. Crispy carbo. Medium leaning light bodies. Easy, tasty, ive been a fan of Avery for many years now. I dig this winter brew"
"B-"

"an american take on an old ale. pours nearly black, not thick, but no light is passing hardly. theres a two inch head lacey and sticky, with good retention. the nose is quite alcoholic. lots of dark roasty malt, that birch syrup flavor is there a little too, akin to sierra nevada life and limb. flavor is curiously dark malts, they are sweet, but dont seem to have any of that bitterness that comes from such dark roasting. also curiously devoid of smoke flavor. the feel is a little thin in body, which lends drinkablility and makes this beer not feel as big as it is. carbonation if mellow but adequate, and the alcohol only really comes out in taste when it warms. this is a beast of a winter beer, perfect for slow fireside sipping, but a 6pack would do you in. one of my favorite avery seasonals."
""
""
""
""
"A great Holiday brew! Highly recommended for any occasion. Avery nailed this one and I look forward to it every year."
"O - I really wanted to love this one and I just couldn't find it in me. It is fairly drinkable for a winter warmer, yet the beer is just to intense for me and overwhelms some of its complexities."
""
""
"O- I've been seeking this one out for a while and, now that I've found it, the waiting was all worth it. Such a smooth, balanced old ale with complexity and a subtle sweetness that makes this an excellent example of the style for me."

""
""

"Overall this was a nice beer. The aging rounding it off nicely, although the fresh version is almost equally as good."
"This is a decent representation of a strong ale with lots of complexity."

"Review from 3/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark orange amber, nice thick head and some lacing. Mild to medium dark fruits and light malt start with hoppy middle and finish. Hops dominate finish. Somewhat like a mild barley wine. Medium mouth feel, creamy. Avery nice winter warmer."

"O – Old ales are not my usual bag but I think I may pick a few bottles up this year to cellar for a bit longer than this bottle. It had lots of complexity & character that when combined with the drinkability was a nice surprise. 3.5"

"Pours brownish with orange and ruby tones to it. There is little head to this offering and the nose has only a subtle malty presence to it. There is a distinct malt flavor upfront and this offering finishes with a nice roasted character to it. To me this tastes like a tuned-up ESB. In any case, it paired well with my pork and feta burrito."

"Dark mahogany, translucent, with a half inch of khaki foam that recedes slowly leaving copious lacing. Smell is thoroughly caramel sweet malt and dark dried fruits with pervasive chocolate. Taste is caramel and dark chocolate malt, mildly sweet throughout but reigned in, finishing dry, subtle hop bitterness. Is there some coffee in here too?  Chocolate on the finish too. Mouthfeel is silly and well crafted. Perfect carbonation.  Very, very good. I added this bottle at random to a make your own six pack.  I'll definitely revisit it in the future. Jubilation indeed. "

"A final note: I've always known this as a winter warmer. BA labels it as an Old Ale, while Avery's website calls it an Old Strong Ale. Hmm"

"D: A very nice old ale that's perfectly appropriate as a winter seasonal. Robust and quite malty, with a measured hop bitterness that manages to stay out of the spotlight while bringing good balance overall."

"09/2010 vintage pours a very deep mahogany with ruby hues very striking color. with a creamy head sitting on top showing minimal retention and spotty lace. the aroma very sweet, caramel, dark fruit, figs with a touch of heat. the taste is a mellow caramel malt, with some and nuttiness and toffee sweetness that play a complimenting balance. alcohol is slightly present and warming. the mouth feel is nice and the carbonation is moderate. easy beer to drink and enjoy on cool evenings. overall i wouldn't have minded having this with a fresh one but i haven't seen it around. enjoyable brew for the season. ho-ho whoa! i don't know why i felt obligated to type that, forgive me and move on. thank you."

"12 oz single from ""Lifesource"" S.Salem. $1.99 I havent rated the beers I have had from Avery very highly maybe this will change as it is one of my favourite styles. Tawny red ale with a small light tan head and plenty lace. Aroma of milky bar chocolate and some caramel, some nuts,,hazelnuts, Smooth taste of coffee and cream, hazelnuts,white chocolate,figs and some whisky fudge. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, gives the impression of fullness but its actually very drinkable I liked it but again its not as good as i wanted it t be. Maybe the bottles just dont travel to Oregon very well"

"D- delicious."
""
"Taste is malty, but doesn't share the depth of the aroma. Light sugar and a bit of a chocolate to it, I guess some of the fig/raisin. Medium smooth body. Overall a decent beer."
"D: This was a decent winter warmer. It had cream-sickle character, which was nice, but it could have been better executed. Alcohol was well hidden, so it was easy to drink and enjoy, but not a really great beer overall."
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall a pretty boozy beer with heavy medicinal flavors. Not very drinkable."
""
""
"Malty aroma, with a malty, nutty, and sweet flavor that improves as the beer warms up. Definitely better at cellar or room temp. Hides the alcohol very nicely--quite drinkable for 8+%. Medium body, very pleasant, but not astounding."
""
"A copper color ale with a smallish off white head which laced nicely. Clear but with some sediment floating about. Aroma is malty but lite. Taste finds this beer rich and malty. A suggestion of toffee. Its smooth but gritty, too gritty for me. Drinkable yes but with loads of grit or something almost to the point of undrinkability."
""
"Overall, this is an excellent beer to take some time with by the fire. It's got a lot of complexity in the taste with the sweetness and spices. One of the better winter warmers in 2011."

"O - A hearty ale for a cold afternoon right after freezing my you know what off on a long bike ride."

"Overall- decent. I am not pressured to buy more and see how aging the recommended period affects the beer- perhaps because I have good beers I have to get through already."
"Overall, this is a nice non-spiced Christmas beer with a very boozy warming quality."
"D/O: I guess I'm just a beer drinker who likes/wants either big hop/citrus/floral/pine/bitter flavors, or big dark roasted/coffee flavors (and sometimes both of those together), or something ""belgian"". This beer is none of those things. My gut is telling me that, for what this is (with my limited experience with such styles, as based on my preferences, I generally avoid beers like this), this is fairly good. It's just not good FOR ME."

"overall - flavor leaves a bit to be desired coupled with a weak mouthfeel, strength is probably the unique flavor profile if you're into trying new brews"
"O: Another massive malty winter brew. I’m appreciating this turn on winter seasonal - -stripped down and not dressed up with any outside spices and flavors. Just beer being beer. A good hefty winter beer that reminds you of a wool coat."
"Overall - Definitely not a bad winter warmer, since it had the thick body and smooth ABV I wanted but the oak and bitterness of hops was a bit cloying. Still a decent Old ale."
"Overall - Decent, a little to much booze up front and maybe a little unbalanced to be truly great. Its worth a drink but not world class by any means."
""
""
"O - this is pretty good, an interesting and complex beer. Could use some time to mellow out, I think."
"Drinkability/overall- i very much did enjoy this beer you appreciate the dryness as it build up more and more as you go, this is overall a very nice beer with great balance, i think i have to now start searching out many more old ales as right now this style of beer is just hitting me so perfect this winter"
"Overall: Easy drinking. Bold, pleasant brew. One of the better seasonals this winter."
"O: A good but not great beer. Enjoyed it, but will not seek it out in the future. Glad I tried it."
"Overall Impression- Enjoyable but would I drink this by the fire on a cold winter's night? Probably not. Not as much body and attribute as I wanted or was scoping out. This brew says its an ""Old Ale"" but more the most part, it was an Ellis' Brown Ale w/ a bit more ABV and malt and no caramel character. Not sure what to think. Still an above average brew but many other fantastic winter ale's I would go for before returning to this one."

"It paired very well with stella fontinella cheese."

"o - Overall I thought this was a really nice old ale. Lots going on and lots of fruit. Alcohol was present in the nsoe but not really in the taste. Something I'd certainly have again."

"O- This beer really shows good flavors of vanilla, cherries, dates, some chocolate, almonds, and a touch of spicy hops. It isn't quite a holiday spiced beer, but it is still one to enjoy by the fireside. I recommend a sixer to get through the winter."

" For a cold day, I supposed this would be a decent choice since the alcohol could warm up anyone who polished off a bottle of this. There's not enough flavor and uplifting aspects to this to justify enjoying this often but once in a while, this would be a good beer to down without much thought. This is a relatively quiet old ale and for anyone who can get past the amount of booze in this, this is a sufficient beer for this time of the year."

"Poured a orangey-brown with a half-finger of head, there was light lacing. The smell was nutty and pleasant enough but the taste was surprisingly aggressive and bitter, especially the finish. I wanted to like this because I like their other offerings, but I didn't even finish this one."

"Pours a brownish red hue that you can see through when held up to direct light. Two finger white head, spider web lacing. The smell is odd at first. I get a faint unpleasent odor that fades as the beer warms. From then on, just chocolate and vanilla. Possible oxidation? The taste is far better than the smell. I detect hops, chocolate, vanilla, and an over all sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. A good beer for the holidays. Must try."

"Recommendation: Get one"
"Overall- This winter warmer uses a silly amount of malts, and it really works. The complexity of the drink is what makes this winter warmer the good drink it is. If you enjoy winter warmers, this beer will not let you down."
"Decent, but not an immediate must-have-more bottle. A palate warmup before I delve into some 10%abv+ beers with more going on."
"O: Another good cold weather sipper, look forward to this beer every winter."
"A good winter warmer for the hop head, as there is still a good hop profile even after a year."
"This winter warmer pours out as a nice deep brown color with a tan colored head on top. The head fades with a light sticky lacing that grabs the glass. The smell of the beer was sweet and a little spicy on the nose as well. The taste of the beer gives of a little bit of warming spices along with some sweet malts. The mouthfeel of this brew was decent. I'd say it's about medium bodied. Overall this beer wasn't bad. I'd drink it again but it wasn't something I'd crave."
"O: This beer is very nice. It is the best winter warmer I have had and I wish this was year round. I will get this as many chances as I get."
"Overall: this is a very nice quaff on a chilly October evening. I'm sure it would be even better with a dusting of snow outside."
"Overall it is good. Winter Warmer is a very vague catagory, similair to barley wine the range is broad. This is very malty without being sweet. It has a smokiness to it that resembles a scotch ale."
"Malty but not overly sweet. Really nice beer; I bought this bottle last year and stuck it in the cellar, and now I'm curious to try some fresh as well. Up there with Jubelale as a favorite winter warmer."
"Brownish red in color, good head and lacing. Smells of some piney hops and weak malts. Sweet malts hit the tongue first, some caramel and toffee as well as hop strength in the back. Like it. Warming and pretty thick for a sixer beer. Simple, does the trick. I'd have two."
"The creamy head and the smoothness already mentioned, followed by the hoppy bitterness makes this one of my favorite winter seasonals. The alcohol adds to the overall complexity; great for any cold evening."
"Edit: Woah!!! I did a side-by-side of this fresh v one-year old, and the year-old version is simply amazing. Has a lot of barleywine characters...sweet, not hoppy like the fresh release. Age this beer."
"Good medium body, smooth, warming, and enjoyable. Very good beer."
"The alcohol here becomes more potent as the sips progress. It starts balanced, smooth, and drinkable, but it ends warm, boozy, and sip-able. Overall though, it's not a bad beer to warm you up in the colder months."
"Overall, it is good. It does a great job of drawing from sweet elements without actually creating an especially sweet product. The alcohol has a nice warming sensation, making it a great winter beer."
"mouthfeel - thick body, not cloying whatsoever, medium carbonation to light. exactly what a winter warmer should be, maybe a bit more creamy and thats why no ta 5."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. I enjoyed this one much more than I was expecting. While BeerAdvocate lists it as a Winter Warmer, the Avery site itself designates this as an English Old Ale, and I can definitely get that immediately after sipping it. The roast is something not typically seen in an old ale, and I think it works great here."
"Overall not a bad winter warmer at all. But in a sea of similar beers, this one is fairly middle-of-the-pack."
"O - One of the better winter warmers I've had. I'm not a fan of black licorice and thankfully the whiff of it in the aroma barely transferred into the taste. This is a bit more bitter than many winter warmers without wandering into the black IPA territory. Thumbs up."
"Picked up a couple of these on discount, as i guess like many places they were trying to get rid of winter and holiday seasonals. But the bottle says this one can be aged for up to two years, so i put one away until maybe next year around this time. Poured a deep brown, into a chalice glass. Smells malty and bready. The taste is rich of toffee and even some slight chocolate notes with some nice alcohol warmth in the finish. I could see drinking this on a cold night around the holidays. Overall it's a decent brew, i enjoyed it, but curious to see what some cellaring time will do for it."
"The color of this holiday brew is a semi-transparent dark brown with a fair tan head and good lacing. And placing a finger aside of my nose, I detect a mild evergreen aroma over a stout-like charcoal malt. There’s a near cherry spritz to it. Pretty decent. The palate finds deep licorice malt and more evergreen. It blends nicely with a unique herbal sweetness. This may not be everyone’s favorite but I’m liking it. It’s medium to full bodied with very subtle but effective carbonation, resulting in a heavy, near chewy feel. This is pretty impressive. Not a session beer but it goes down readily considering the style and ABV of 8.3. Very enjoyable and recommended for your holiday pleasure, or a cool June night like tonight."
"O: Pretty good, a different take on a winter warmer, and it would definitely warm me up in the middle of winter."
"D/O: This beer is appealing in concept--strong and malty, but with the omission of those troublesome spices that are meant to invoke the spirit of wassail, only to trip up so many winter warmers. Unfortunately the transient urea notes take one completely out of the experience, limiting enjoyment. Still, it is not without its charms; considering it is an Avery product, it may be considered a qualified success."
"D - A very drinkable beer for one that is so complex. Great for sipping by the fire in the winter."
"I would recommend this one as something different to try later in the evening. The taste and the ABV are a little too much to start the night with."
"This beer pours a clear brown with a rapidly fading head. The aroma has hints of roasted nuts, chocolate, and raisins. The flavor has a mix of toast, brandy, and a coffee note and a bit of brandy. It's got a creamy full mouthfeel and a warming feeling as it goes down. Avery Old Jubilation is a good representative of the style, a bit too much like brandy. Not recommended."
"O - Really nice example of a Winter Warmer, I'll definitely look for this next Winter."
"Not my favorite offering from Avery, too reminiscient of Deschutes winter beer."
"O: This has been one of my favorite winter offering for a long time, and really enjoy to give it the proper respect that it deserves here on BA. As it is well balanced and an all around great brew, my most found memories of this brew are when I got back from a week long backcounty ski tour in the south-eastern San Juan mountains of Colorado (with not a drop of beer), sitting at home and kicking up my feet with this brew had truly made a deep connection. Great beer, one of the seasons best offerings."
"A good example of the style, but a bit hot with the booze. A decent beer."
"Avery Brewing Company--Old Jubilation Ale--Limited Release 2010 12 oz. Bottle. 8.30% ABV. 30 IBU's? (3.75 / 5.0) Winter Old Ale? Lacy dense tan 1/2"" head. Clear dark ruby walnut color.

"well done."
"This is a complex drink that is sure to make a coffee lover drink as much as Avery will tap."
"It's got a nice creamy texture, and a long lasting foamy cap."
"D- This is a tasty winter warmer. One is enough to make a good evening great."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Was a dark reddish brown with a thin light brown head that lasted a very long time. Aroma was slightly sweet, slightly syrupy with a small spicy hints. Taste was fairly subtle to begin with. Grew to a spicy tangy sweetness over time. Felt great in the mouth. Coated extremely well, just the way a winter warmer should, with a good amount of carbonation. A pleasure to drink, not a session beer, but a solid sipper that made me want more."
"D-A very enjoyable warmer with just the right amount of spice for my palate. Highly drinkable for a spiced beer in my opinion."
"Poured out of 12oz bottle into dimpled mug. Amber-brown in colour, creamy and rich beige coloured head, excellent lacing. The aroma is malty, chalky, some chocolate, plums, high sweetness. The aroma is malty, rich, sweet with lots of fruit and some chocolate. Sweet but still some bitterness in the mouthfeel, medium body, medium carbonation. Finishes sweet, fruity and malty but dries out at the end."
"M&D- A very full beer. I could drink a lot of these. This is not my favorite type of brew by compliments the style well."
"It pours a deep brown with nice amber highlights when held up to the light. The aroma is dominated with rich toffee and molasses notes that are lifted into you nostrils on a cloud of ethanol vapors."
"Thick body but the heavy flavors make it a definite sipping beer."
"D: I could certainly knock several of these back despite the high ABV. Just an excellent balanced beer."
"Cellaring this beer for a year didn't hurt it one bit. My only disappointment was that I was not able to find a 2010 vintage (which was why I saved this from last year) to contemporaneously compare this to. Highly drinkable, this is an excellent winter warmer."
"Pours blackened amber with red edges and a white head that disappears. Weak aroma of spices, dark fruit, slight chocolate, and caramel. Tastes of maple syrup, brown sugar, grains, caramel, hop bitterness towards the finish but it is still overwhelmed by the dark malts. Medium carbonation in a medium bodied brew. The booze is hidden well behind this syrupy malt bomb but an enjoyable winter warmer all around."
"T - A very drinkable beer. Unfortunately I only have this one left plus one in the cellar so I won't be having more any time soon as I'm curious what the malts will do over a six month period or so."
"Cellerable for 3 years? Interesting, might be worth it. As is, a slightly above average taste with a nice malt profile for cellar potential and it does have a great mouthfeel."
"Great winter time brew, I always look forward to Old Jubilation. The flavors aren't in your face, just subtle and tasty. Recommended."
"Overall this one's OK. Wouldn't purchase it again, but nice enough to try."
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Rich dark brown appearance, with a frothy head and plenty of lacing. Nose is a nice combination of malt with the customary winter spices. Flavor is heavy and rich malt with a lot of pungency. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"Thick chewy mouthfeel. It has a medium body that is more on the heavier side of medium. Has a little bit of a chewy quality to it. It has a creamy quality to it, and warms the mouth. Not balanced enough to revisit in my opinion, will not revisit."
"Appearantly this beer is cellarable for 3+ years. This blend from colorado only uses Rocky moutain water which lends to its pureness."
"d - really great winter warmer and goes down easily."
"A beer with good drinkability for cold winter nights. I usually turn to a big old imperial stouts for comfort on a chilly evening, but I wouldn't mind knocking back one of these to mix things up. Not bad for my first winter warmer."
"D - Very high. The alcohol taste is present, but not as much as you would expect from a higher ABV beer. It is masked pretty well. I will be buying this one again."
"Overall - A pretty solid winter warmer. I've had beers that do a better job 'warming', but this is a great beer to sit in front of a fire with. Very full smell and taste. Bravo."
"overall: smell was not very good in this one but everything else was very enjoyable."
"This is not a complex beer but it is really good and is a great beer to drink by a fire."
"Had this one on tap at the Sink in Boulder. Good chocolate smell. Very good flavor, chocolate, raisin and coffee. Not too carbonated and lighter than I expected. Very drinkable, and recommended. I need to get around to trying more Avery Brews. If you are looking for a nice dark brew that is not too intense, this is the ticket. They had Deep Purple In Rock playing; one of my favorite records and one that goes well with this brew."
"Excellent drinkability for the style. Moderate alcohol presence is somewhat masked, and a six pack of these would make for a nice, relaxing evening indeed. The beer has character, though I was expecting something sweeter, darker, and even heavier."
"D - A hearty Winter Warmer with a stronger roasted malt profile than most... Assertive and enjoyable... Not my favorite winter offering, but a unique take on the style that I had no problem finishing..."
"D: Very drinkable considering the abv... wow, the alcohol is well hidden on this one. A great winter warmer... one of my favorites for sure... similar to an old ale. I look forward to this one every winter - seems like its always gone too early."
"A winter warmer without spices done in the tradition of a English Strong (Old) Ale style. This beer is dark brown color (deep ruby when held to the light), fairly low carbonation with only about a finger of head. Aroma is dominated by the roasted nutty malts and mild earthy hops. The flavor lacked the balance of the aroma though. I thought the roasted malts took over and had quite a bit of bitterness in the taste. It's a good refined medium bodied beer, but lacks the drinkability of other winter warmers I've had."
"Very malty, caramel and toasted, slight chocolate. There seems like there's something of a spice to it, but it may just be some long-chain alcohols throwing some scent. The chocolate is a nice competitor the slight sweetness. Nice pine hop supplement. Really enjoyable beer."
"Drink- A very good rep of the style. I need to go get another one to age it."
"This one was pretty easy to finish - and esp good for those who enjoy their beer on the sweeter side of the equation."
"The beer pours a medium brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is a mix of chocolate, toffee and some nutmeg. The flavor is more complex. I get some chocolate and toffee, but I also get anise, coffee, cinnamon, roasted malt and some alcohol. Full mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice winter warmer."
"Smooth and full mouthfeel, The strong abv is apparent but not harsh. At the time of this review, Ol' Jubey is at the top of the list for this style (that's why I shelled out the $9 for a 6er) Overall this is probably the most unique winter warmer I've tried and a damn fine ale."
"Overall impression: bland, average winter warmer. wouldn't drink on a regular basis."
"D: Outside of the odd aftertaste, this beer is surprisingly drinkable. I was excited to find this beer from Avery, as I usually enjoy their offerings, however, with all the ""christmas ales," on the market, I would look elsewhere next time."
"Pours a dark mahogany with about a finger of light tan head. Head is fizzy and disappears quicker than I expected leaving a trace of lacing. Scent is pretty malt forward, with some roastiness and dark fruits. Taste is again lots of malt with some chocolate and roasty notes as well and just enough earthy hops to provide some balance. Didn't have the spiciness I expected for a winter warmer but quite frankly it was fantastic even without it. Alcohol is well hidden making this quite a drinkable beer."
"The flavor brings some mild hops with a bit of earth and citrus as well as some caramel. There some slight spicing and a bit of booze in there as well. The body is nice with a bit of booze and is a bit thinner than expected, but has a good amount of carbonation to carry the flavors. Drinkability is decent. This is a well-made brew, but just doesn't really stand out in any direction."
"D - Between the strong alcohol presence up front and the bitterness on the end, I wasn't impressed with this beer. That aftertaste is the last thing I have to remember and it's making me not want to try another one."
"Very nice deep dark mahagony color with caramely highlights. Cream colored lacy ring around edge of glass with a super thin coat on face of beer. Not the spicy aroma I was expecting for winter beer. Very deep malty aroma. Chocolate and roasted malt very evident. A little bit of coffee. Very sweet start. Moderate carbonation, continues throughout entire drink, always brings head with a swirl. Not super heavy. A little bit of a candied sweetness. Coffee malt becomes more evident at end. Dry finish, not astrigently dry. Slight alcohol warming at end of swallow. Very nice winter beer not using any spices. Drinkable and not super heavy."
"D - This seems like a nice beer to sip, maybe 1-2 12oz bottles on a cold day. The drinkability is around average for the style but I thought the flavor profile was lacking in complexity. The aroma could have been more inviting as well, overall not bad and worth a try but I probably won't ever come back to this one."
"Overall, i'm not liking this too much. It seems that the flavors don't fall into place as they should and just isn't all that pleasant to drink. That's not to say it's bad though. I'm glad i tried it but i'll probably not be getting it again."
"D - This has a pretty good drinkability. I think this is a perfect beer for chilly nights. Good taste, good price, I would definitely pick this one up again."
"The appearance is of a nice winter warmer beer. A very dark ruby color, with a finger of white foam. The aroma is most akin to orange blossoms, there are some other hop esters along with brown sugar and clove, but the orange blossom smells of a wonderful floral bouquet. The taste however let me down so very much. The flavors are of burnt biscuit and coffee, with an odd aftertaste that really messes with you. The hoppy bitterness doesn't really help the beer, in fact I would say that it hinders it. However, amongst all of this it is a palatable solid brew that I would still consider good. It just really isn't my cup of brew."
"Notes: Old Jubilation starts sweet, and finishes dry. This full-bodied brew has the balance, along with the strength. A true winter warmer by any means. Avery continues to impress, once again."
"And our day at the Firk is nearing an end. Soon, we bottle some of our own beer! In the meantime, this one pours a dark ruby-brown topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, light fennel, brown sugar, light maple syrup, and walnuts. The taste holds notes of brown sugar, light roasted malts, walnuts, and light maple syrup. There's a decidedly watered-down kind of feeling to everything. The body is a straight medium, with a light carbonation and a kinda watery feel. Overall, a decent Winter brew, but nothing I would heartily ask for or recommend. It's all just a bit watery for my liking."
"Thick chewy mouthfeel. Nice. Alcohol is well hidden for an 8% beer. Reminds me of Oskar Blues Old Chub in a few ways."
"Very good!"
"Drinkability: Not too bad, nothing overly special though; good for a cool night as it does have a bit of a warming presence; the body really isn't too heavy at all either, but I do think the ABV would start to catch up if more than 2 were had in a night."
"D: moderately complex and pretty tasty. If any quarrels exist I would say that the alcohol notes are a little too exciting, but not unwelcoming"
"The mouthfeel is surprisingly thinner than I was expecting. Carbonation is decent and is relatively smooth on the palate. This would seemingly make it more drinkable but the heavy malts and inherent alcohol bring it back down. This one is definitely something to warm you on a cold winter night. While there are superior winter warmers, more easily available, I did enjoy this one and thought it was pretty good."
"D - Ho Ho WOAH!!?! This beer is 8.3% ABV? Absolutely nothing about this beer hints of that kind of strength. Utterly drinkable for how big it is. A truly wonderful Winter Seasonal that I will certainly enjoy again. This one really surprised me, and is now going to be a beer that I seek out annually during the Holidays."
"All in all a decent warmer. This beer improves with warmth. Don't drink right out of the fridge."
"Avery Old Jubilation has the look, flavor, and feel of flat root beer."
"Drinkability - For such a high ABV, quite high. Not overwhelmingly spicy for a winter warmer, so I could definitely see myself putting back a couple of these with no problem and getting some nice psychological warming from the high alcohol on a cold winter night."
"Pours a clear dark reddish brown with a creamy thin tan head. Smells of buttered toast. Taste is an earthy phenolic beginning, with a toffee middle, and a piney, tart finish. Rich mouthfeel, slightly prickly carbonation. This beer is certainly a sipper, but I would definately get it again."
"D: Take it or leave it ... I'll leave it for the most part."
"D - A good beer. I am enjoying sipping it on this (finally) cold night. I will probably have one more from the 6-pack and save the others for the next few years. Avery says that they can be cellared for a couple years so we will see if anything changes with time."
"Overall: Average beer overall. There are better options available in this style."
"so overall review? The beer is worth checking out...and I'm interested to see how it progresses over the next 1-3 years. A tiny gem among the Avery jewel chest."
"D: This needed to warm up quite a bit, but it sure tastes great now. Quite a smooth, malty beer that can probably get better in a year or so."
"D: Not the best Winter Warmer. I was expecting more from Avery."
"A very fine example of Old Ale. This one is pretty fresh and it's great as is, but would be just as interesting with some age on it. Old Jubilation is one of Avery's most overlooked and best put together beers. A perfect choice for sipping by the first fire of the year."
"Drinkability - I think I could have a couple of these on a cold winter night. At 8% it'll be sure to keep you warm. Nice to see it that they make it all year around but I like to keep it special for the winter/holiday months!"
"Verdict: Very good and well-priced, worth finding and driking but beware the finish!"
"Edit: No spices are used in this beer and I think that is skewing some of the ratings/palates.."
"This has a distinct shortage of sweetness compared to a typical winter warmer. I'm usually the one complaining about a beer being too sweet, but the lack of it definitely hurts this style and this particular beer. Not a ton of punch to the nose, but the flavors are pretty interesting. Dry malt profile with a fair dose of burnt character and toasted wood, perhaps a little smoke. Bitterness aplenty, flirting with astringency. Hop flavors are quite earthy. As it warms, it gains sweetness that seems to be lacking a partner in crime. Finishes way too clean to be a proper ""warmer"". Decent brew, a little unfocused. A bit of aging might do this one some good."
"This stuff is at a pretty reasonable price,is complex and worth pondering. Perhaps it is a beer that becomes an acquired taste?"
"Overall, this is a decent beer nothing to complain about nothing to rave about."
"Another great Avery Brewing product at a great price."
"Note: The taste is not bad but its nothing too exciting. It is however a lot better then the smell."
"Poured from the bottle into my snifter a nice deep dark ruby color with ample offwhite/tan head. Smells initially of caramel malts and some piney bitterness, with a spicy aftertone. Spiciness is more evident in the taste with the malts and pine notes finishing. Good feel with medium carbonation and smooth finish. Overall a nice winter beverage."
"pretty drinkable, but the abv does catch up with you. for being just shy of a year old, this beer seems to have lost nothing. would be great to save for the cold weather months."
"Really nice. I could drink a few of these."
"Update: it turns out this bottle was from 2008, so I would note that it ages superbly."
"Pours a deep, rich, reddish-mahogany color, with some light brown foam resting on top. This is one of the better winter beers out there, with aromas of milk chocolate, caramel and hops. Pretty similar on the palate, with molasses and dark fruit added to the mix. A welcome addition to the fridge every November."
"Drinkability? Good drinkability held back only by a slowly increasing amount of alcohol that's mostly present after the swallow. But at 8%, it's still not a chore to drink by any means. A very solid example of the style."
"Drinkability: Old Jubilation isn't too sweet and doesn't really show it's ABV% at all except in the smell, thus it's extremely drinkable."
"Ah, the ever ambiguos ""Winter Warmer"" style, if only i knew what that meant. Well this time it means dark copper color tone with good lacing with raisons, cherries, and spices galore with a very sweet tooth malt body with a bit of campfire smoke inside of a gently carbinated medium viscosity easy drinking top fermented ale."
"D - A good winter warmer that hides the alcohol level well, it's almost worth getting more singles and aging to see how much more it smooths out. Tasty and well-balanced."
"Drinkability is good. Hop bitterness balances well with this brews caramelly sweetness and the 8.00% ABV is well hidden."
"Quite good. A nice winter seasonal to sip and savor. Well balanced and gets better and better as it warms."
"The body was good and robust, very mouth-coating. The carbonation kept just enough crispness as it slid down. Considering the hardy body and 8% ABV, it's very easy to quaff."
"D - Not real drinkable. The hops will eat away at your tastebuds after a beer and a half. And the ABV is considerable for a winter warmer. A better spring/summer beer."
"D - goes down smooth and easy."
"Overall, a good winter warmer that does well for the style. For me, I'm not in a rush to have another but that's more a style thing. If I want a warmer though this is on the short list. Rotation - might be available here in TX but I shipped one back just in case and also cause I could get a single of it. It's good for a warmer but one is enough for me [1-style]"
"This demands to be consumed with something, preferably with a strong aroma and texture. Others seem to view this far more positively then I do, so I'll try another next year, and amend my review if it proves to be better."
"D= This is a very good beer, but it is certainly too ""Americanized"" to call an Old Ale...hence the Winter Warmer tag. Very drinkable (almost dangerously so). I'll be drinking more of this and am curious as to how this might age."
"Overall impression: very complex and well rounded beer with a great alcohol warmth very enjoyable on a cold night!!"
"Value: As with all these Avery beers, you get more than your moneys worth."
"Overall Impression: I like this style of beer this time of year (Feb). Avery is a solid brew, hearty and fulfilling, it hits my QCB spot!"
"Of all the wineer warmers I've tried/enjoyed, including some that are a bit too hoppy to provide that soft, wide warmth that is so nice on a cold day, this is one of the best. Can't wait until next winter!!"
"Pours slightly hazy, amber/copper with nice head and good lacing. Aroma is malty, caramelly and slightly spicy. The flavor is malty, caramelly, with a cinnamon-like spice and a rich hop bite and bit of bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and mellow. The spice and bitterness linger on the finish."
"Medium bodied. Smooth, creamy texture. ABV is never detectable, and it's an easy drinker."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0810-DanielleV"
"This is a great example of the style and definitely something to sip on this winter."
"D. Packs an alcohol punch. Good taste but a tad on the harsh side and wouldn't go looking to down two or more of these. However, I thought this was a good winter warmer and increased my appreciation for this style."
"has a medium body, fine carbonation. very drinkable, wouldve definately thought this was around 5 or 6%. get this if you can, one of the better winter seasonals out"
"Comments: Bottle pour."
"Very drinkable. This beer was a very nice surprise. It's not exceptional, but it's very good."
"Had this a couple of years ago but didn't take notes, I'm enjoying this years, although the first half of the glass was much better than the second. Fuller body, bigger flavors, especially the hops."
"Amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head that remains on top as a thin film.Aroma is faint caramel.Taste is malt, biscuit and alcohol.A pretty darn good beer that leaves a small warmth behind.Recommended for the winter months and this issomething I would buy again."
"Moderately sweet and earthy aroma of licorice, caramel and wood. Gorgeous deep reddish brown color with a thick, rocky head that lasts beyond the final drop. Substantial lacing. Medium sweetness with hints of nuts. Substantial alcohol warmth. Full body with a hefty mouthfeel. Lively carbonation with a lasting sweet malt finish. This is a big winner. Highly recommended for those cold winter nights, or anytime, really."
"D: Nice here, even at 8% this is easy to drink, this is the last bottle of the six pack, and I've enjoyed what I've drank of these. Nothing incredibly exciting, but definitely something to enjoy in the winter time."
"Not my favorite style by far but this is certainly a well made beer."
"D. Pretty drinkable. This is a good winter warmer."
"Drinkability: Not a bad by for the winter, however, the burnt taste is strong and the alcohol present, it is not a beer for multiple consumption."
"Brown/red color with a small tan head, lots of lacing . Smokey malt aroma. The flavor is also smokey, and earthy and fairly bitter but not a hop bitterness. Thankfully no cinnamin or other seasonal spices that are used on plenty of 'Winter' beers. It has a nice thick feel. For me this beer is best as a night closer. The last beer of the night after a few lesser beers."
"Overall: A very good winter beer, lots of flavor and warms you up nicely on a cold night."
"A nice winter warmer that will appeal to those who aren't fans of spiced winter beers."
"D: A really good winter beer that avoids the spice parade by being a super-solid ale with big, complex malt and hops flavors. I'm going to cellar a few and see what develops over a couple of years."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Great clear copper color with a thick stiff head that lingers for a while until it is a thick film. Has excellent lacing marking each sip. Hoppy floral and nutty aroma. High hopped taste but also very malty. Has a bitter sweet finish hints of toffee. Not a bad winter warmer. Also seems to be barrel aged since the hoppiness has a mellow character to it yet there is no mention anywhere that this is the case."
"I don't think I've ever met an Avery brew I did not like. These guys are really top notch, and this is a really great interpretation of the ""non spiced"" warmer style."
"Clear dark mahogany pour. Off white head quickly fades to a thin sheet...lots of lacing. Some citrus in the nose along with cherries and dark dried fruit. Malts come across in a toffee-like aroma. There's much more hops presence than I was expecting...floral and citrus. There's an odd bitterness at the end that is somewhat reminiscent of chewing an aspirin. I would quite like this beer if I wasn't left with that aftertaste. Love the creamy feel with some biting carbonation."
"D: I m glad to have try this but would only want one and dont need to go back again anytime soon"
"I like Old Jubilation but not enough to buy a case or anything."
"Dark amber body, one finger light tan head, medium dissipation with significant lacing. The nose is fairly sweet and very complex, chocolate and fruity esters (cherries) up front, sweetish malts at beginning and bready malts towards the end. The taste is tobacco, chocolate, toffee, leather, citrusy hops with a bit of smoke at the end. Mouthfeel nicely carbonated, a bit sticky. Drinkability good for the ABV. Tough to categorize outside the Winter Warmer catchall, my best attempt would be Old Ale. Pretty tasty, one of the better beers I've had this holiday season. Recommended."
"'Jubilation' is another word for celebration, festivity and merriment - all things you're likely to experience while drinking this beer. The holiday season is full of fantastic things: feasts, presents, traditions, acts of good will and, naturally, seasonal beers. Avery's winter offering is warming, hearty and flavourful; it is fantastically designed for this time of year."
"Not a bad beer but nothing spectacular."
"Drinks great, while there is a boozey quality it really just adds to the warmer's flavor and this drinks great!"
"This is a nice brew from one of my fave breweries."
"Pours a reddish, copper color with 1 finger of head that faded into a ring. Smells toasty, with lots of sweet, caramel malt aroma. Bitterness is first on the pallet, quickly followed by a nice, full body with light carbonation and some really good malt flavor and some earthy, nutty-ness, but always with some bitterness around. That bitterness comes back in to dominate the finish, which is quite lingering. You don't taste the alcohol in this beer, but it definitely leaves you with a nice, warm feeling. This might be my second favorite winter seasonal after Celebration."
"Pours a deep crimson with a one finger light tan head that has good retention. A preview of medium lacing is already starting to form on my glass. A nice, random pillow tops the beer after head dies down a bit. Smell is weak (hard to pick up) but I can get notes of roasty malts, light hops, and dark fruits like cherries. I get a tiny note of cocoa in the nose too. I wish this one was stronger, would be awesome blend if it was. Taste is pretty cool. Get some nice malts, roasty ones, a decent hop profile, cherries, cocoa. There is a bit of a dry alcohol taste that really keeps this one from shining. Tastes like a scaled back stout with some fruit. Mouthfeel is moderate bodied with appropriate carbonation. Not much warming is present in this 8.00% beer. Drinkability is good. Good taste, price was not bad, dunno if I'll try this again."
"D: A good winter warmer. Would highly recommend."
"D- Not terrible for 8%, but definitely one of the worst offerings I've had from Avery. Drank this after a homebrew spiced ale given to me by a relatively new hombrewer, which significantly beat out Old Jubilation."
"When I started keeping notes several years ago this was the first beer I reviewed. It was also the first Winter Warmer I had ever tried. As an introduction to the style I'm sure I made the wrong choice. I graded this an F and found it ""horribly undrinkable"". Oh how the palate has changed! This example is a bit more hoppy than many of the winter warmers I've had since and is a very big beer. With that being said I'm a fan. You definitely taste every bit of the 8.0% alcohol but its balanced out by some beautiful toffee and caramel notes with just the right amount of spice present in the background. Still a ""once in awhile"" beer but a darn nice occasional sipper."
"A really nice beer, very malty with just enough chocolate and roastiness to complement the toffee like sweetness. A great example of a winter warmer, i could drink a lot of this."
"Gotta say, glad I only bought one bottle to sample. This will be the last one of these that I have."
"D: the abv is extremely well hidden in this well balanced winter warmer. Definitely worth the try!"
"D: Pretty drinkable and pleasant thought the sweetness and slight funk wears on you."
"D - Ok but not a big session beer. Definitely fits in the category of winter warmers."
"D = This drinks well, but only as a slow sipper."
"The feel of this beer is pretty pleasant, and is quite light for a winter beer that is still a bit malty. Is medium bodied and goes down pretty easy."
"Drink ability was great. Rather session able strong ale. Very complex beer, almost flawless. Winter is my favorite season for beer and this one is one of the best seasonal beers around"
"Creamy tan head of two fingers plus of microfoam, very deep dimples, high quality retention, hence not much room for lacing. Clear red-brown in color, sufficiently dark that you feel it is ""transparent"" per se even though it is, touch more red-orange around the rims. Sweet nose of mocha, malts, anise seed, chestnuts and cherry, plum fruit scents, there is an odd pepperiness to it as well, not sure why it's there, turns a bit herbaceous just before it dissipates, overall clings to your nostrils well and lingers for some time. In the mouth it's medium-bodied with a dense, muscular feel, the carbonation is tight and kind of explosive, not the creamy or soft sort of fizz. Even with palpable caramel, malt, chocolate elements not that sweet, restraint found in the currant, cherry, plum flavors. Hint of clove spice and cola. Some grain, grass bite, goes with with the undercurrent of smokiness. Deserves kudos for the broad array of flavors presented, however, doesn't cohere into a unified whole as one might want."
"D: Purchased a single bottle, will probably pickup a 6-pack to cellar for a year or two. The beer is very well balanced and very drinkable."
"drinkability takes a hit - while i enjoyed the all the flavors this beer had - one and done - maybe it was the 8%abv"
"I'd say it's a definite style benchmark contender."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint-glass a crisp copper with a thin off-white head that diminishes to a ring and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet malts with mild spice. The taste is a nice blend of burnt caramel malts, pine hops alongside cinnamon and brown sugar. The beer is medium bodied with decent carbonation. While it's no Highland Cold Mountain Winter, this one is still an enjoyable Winter Warmer, especially for a hophead."
"Drinkability- Another great brew by avery, this beer's flavors are focused and not overpowering like many winter warmers can be."
"After all I've heard about this beer, a bit disappointing."
"D- Next!"
"Drinkability: Overall, a big, full flavored beer that is a showcase for both English malts and English hops."
"F: Finishes slightly sweet with some lingering creamy flavors and chocolate malt, as well as roasted malts and dark fruits. A slight hop bitterness comes through on the finish, but its not very heavy. It finishes slightly clean, with a sticky feeling around the mouth that never really fades."
"D- Decent drinkability. The alcohol isnt overpowering."
"Poured a clear, medium brown with a respectable head that reduced to a thick skin. The aroma was hop citrus. The taste was a nice, almost maple syrupy, malt sweetness hitting the tongue first, and then the hop juice kicked in. The feel was full bodied with sufficient carbonation. Drinkability was pretty good, a second bottle would be fine but the 8.00 ABV would make any more risky. Overall, Old Jubilation had a well balanced flavor that reminded me of an APA, more so than winter warmer. Solid beer."
"Very creamy mouthfeel and very drinkable. alcohol is not prevalent at all."
"Recommended"
"Love this one every year. Dark and subdued in the nose compared to the amount of flavor it packs, this one shows a chocolate malt presence as well as a generous hops and dark fruits like plums and chocolate cherries. Nicely welded together with spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and a big shot of warm cider. The booze is faintly present and warming which is appreciated. Nice lacing, mouthfeel is full, luscious and sudsy with understated carbonation."
"Hits first with a bready flavor with a super creamy texture, this then develops into cookie-like malt sweetness with just a bit of hop bitterness, to fill out the flavor a bit it seems. The alcohol is slightly present on the backend but it's not harsh, just slightly warming. The moth feel is smooth and full on this and the taste seems to have a light taste of cream, or maybe vanilla, and definitely a kind of warm honey like flavor involved. Over all this is delicious and pretty drinkable for its 8% booze. My first winter on BA and I'm looking forward to the styles."
"D - For a winter warmer this is a pretty sessionable ale that is not weighed down with a large amount of spices."
"This may not be what one would expect from a winter warmer (being a very ambiguous ""style""), but it's nicely-crafted and a good beer."
"not overly spiced like most winter warmers."
"D: A nice, well-balanced, drinkable Winter Warmer."
"Drinkability: An above average winter warmer with a slightly off aftertaste. I would have this again, but only once per sitting."
"D - on a cold night by the fire? 5.5! a sixer of this would go great w/ a game of poker with friends on a chilly winter eve. this is a sipper w/ a ton of malt. overall not bad, not greatness either. However I appreciate Avery's diversity and ability to craft so many different styles w/ such success and consistency."
"Overall, a nice holiday ale-not overpowering on spices, nicely balanced and drinkable for the strength."
"Easily drunk by most, good to age for a litte bit, and easy for 8% abv"
"The annual Holiday/Winter offering from Avery presents their usual rich complex take on English Winter ale. A bittersweet chocolate profile, highlighted with orange citrus notes, with very substantial malts for support. This is despite its full strength and body, a very drinkable ale, An American craft recipe classic."
"D-- ABV is there in the warming but a very nice winter warmer on a cold night in front of a fire. A little bigger at 8% but a good beer."
"glassware: pint"
"Old Jubilation pours a dark coffee bean brown with ruby highlights when held up to the light. With a normal pour, this beer produces an immaculate 3 inch latte beige head that leaves just a slight bit of sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is immense. Notes of caramel, coffee, and burnt malts dominate with dark fruits finishing. The flavor follows suit but much more complex. Hazelnut is right there, with caramel, toffee, roasted malts, toast, dates, and just a bit of vanilla. This is really a great tasting beer. I don't know if its the fact its been sitting for close to 6 months now and has really come together or it is that great. I think I'll have to re review when it comes out again in November. The mouthfeel is full, leaving a latte froth creaminess lingering on the palate. This is a very good beer. I find Avery beers really hit and miss. This would definitly fall under the hit moniker."
"A well-rounded, easy to drink beer."
"Over all outstanding!"
"It's still quite drinkable but otherwise, i don't see much to rave about here. A solid winter warmer worth your consideration."
"D- This is delicious and dangerously enjoyable. 8% ABV makes it a sipper, but a welcome one at that."
"Nose is sweet, spiced malt with notes of brown sugar and dark fruit. A hint of roasty aroma in the background, lightly reminiscent of coffee. Taste is sweet malt with a quick sort of astringency. Warming alcohol in the finish that lingers. There's an earthy quality that comes in fairly quickly on each sip and stays through the finish. Well balanced on the whole. Medium to heavy bodied, with a good bit of stickiness. Certainly a sipping beer."
"M/D: Thick and syrupy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Masks the alcohol well. The beer just lacks a striking and unique character, so I am not compelled to keep drinking."
"The taste does not disappoint, as raw vanilla beans, oak staves and dark chocolaty maltiness assault the tastebuds. All this with no spices? That is a mighty feat indeed. Malty goodness with a nice hop balance. This is a fine winter warmer from Avery."
"D - For the style, would take some to get tired."
"Aged very well as when I first had one this winter I hated it. Now I really like it."
"D - solid. Perfect for three or four pints on a fall evening."
"The Foam was whole wheat/oat in color and smooth. The color was a deep burgandy/cola with mahogany highlights. It had a deep hops smell with a small accent of licorice and was a little bitter. The taste was a little bitter, hidden fruity undertones, deep and a very malty undertone. Mouthfeel - smooth and crisp. Drinkability - it was alright, but the bitter hops taste made it from getting a better score."
"D: Not all bad. I would think that aging this beer for several years would help to cool the alcohol down. However, I would never buy a case, or even a six pack of this stuff again. There are just too many beers out there to try and this doesn't make the cut for a repeat performance in my book."
"(D) Not nearly as potent as an usual winter warmer. Very delicious combination in the flavors."
"I could drink this one for a session easily. I do not notice the 8% abv at all."
"D: Flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, it's a little strong than most beers in the style and worth drinking for a while, but there are others I would pick first."
"D - This is another highly drinkable beer from avery. Bottoms up!"
"Pours a muddy brown with a thick tan head, that seems like it might be around for a bit. Smell is toffee some caramel notes, brown sugar, real heavy on the malt, not much in the way of hops. Taste is rather odd and a complete let down from the smell. first is a rather cloying sweetness of brown sugar and then comes a piney hops. Some winter spice is a bit abrasive on the tongue too. Mouthfeel is decent enough. Good carbonation to carry the alchohol and the stickiness of this beer seems to work. Drinkability is a bit lackluster for me. Not sure I would ever need to try this beer again."
"Nice winter warmer. Even on this almost 90 degree February evening."
"This a nice winter warmer. Its well balanced and drinkable for its strength. A wonderful brew to pass the winter months with."
"Notes: Never have I been disappointed by an Avery brew. This one is very good."
"Drinkable but not great. The taste is a bit off, and I don't care much for the scotch ale style."
"Nice copper pour with a small just off white head that disipates slowly. Lacing down the glass is real nice. Glass to nose, and I get a nice american hop aroma, mainly floral hops. Also brings a nice caramel and biscuit malt aroma to the table. First taste is real nice with a touch of spice and caramel, backgrounds of biscuit and nuts are there. The hops give a different candy like taste. Feel is undercarbonated to me, but that is a minor part of a nice coating feel. this is a very easily drinkable brew, and I really feel this Winter Warmer has the character of an English Barleywine."
"Great mahogany color with very little head. Taste was good with a bit of a hoppy finish but a straight forward approach to the general style. Lacks a bit of alcohol to truly fulfill my expectations of a warmer. The added advantage is that its one of the few brews offered in a 12 oz with so much punch/flavor."
"Nice brew but I would not seek it out."
"M/D - Nice winter warmer and something i'd like to try again, I just don't think i'd go out of my way to find it. Overall though a good example, but far from the best."
"Clear and dark brown, perhaps a reddish tint. A hard pour produced a thick cap of tan foam about a half inch thick. Good head retention, lots of clinging lace. Malty aroma, lots of chocolate/cocoa, toffee and caramel. Mild fruit tones and faint hops, maybe citrusy, maybe floral, hard to tell. Nicely balanced flavour, still a lot of malt character but with mild bitterness and fruity notes. Faint mint in the finish along with subdued alcohol and lingering chocolate/toffee malts. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation, fine bubbles, slight dry astringency from the dark malts. Pretty good overall. A tasty winter warmer."
"Tasty. A very good sipper."
"Another solid brew from Avery. Quickly becoming my fave winter warmer. (Okay, it's in a tie with Great Divide Hibernation.)"
"D - The taste of alcohol is present in the finish which makes this a litle less drinkable. Overall, pretty good."
"D - Very drinkable winter beer. Not something I'd drink all night due to the ABV, but perfect for sipping by the fire."
"I have yet to find a Avery brew that has wowed me sadly."
"D-I couldn't think of a better brew to enjoy while warming up after cross-country skiing. This beer features a multi-faceted flavor that shows more of itself with every sip. With that, this beer is also not difficult to consume."
"Mmmm, winter warmer - the Cinnamon and nutmeg flavors make this perfect for the holiday season. Even so, the ""winter warmer"" name for this category is a bit of a misnomer -- I'd much rather have a room temperature stout to warm me up on a cold winter day. But back to the Old Jubilation -- this has a great dark amber color, and has a wonderful mix of spices, with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, and a rich flavor."
"Pours a clear ruby red color with a sticky egg shell colored head that left some lacing. The aroma is of sweet red grapes, candied cherries, a bready honey malt, and a hint of hops. The taste is big on bitter resiny hops which is supported by a sweet bready malt. The dark fruit flavors (grape and cherry) serve as subtle notes towards the end. The feel is thick and chewy, borders on being slick from the ABV, fairly soft carbonation, finishes sweet. The drinkability is fine, again a bit thick and boozy. Good if you are only looking to drink one."
"Alcohol is mellow, but decidedly apparent, especially with the hops having faded a bit, there is a strong note of pepper that must be the alcohol. Lots of fine bubbles that scrub at first when it's chilled, but later are more creamy, if not massaging. Mouthfeel is decent, but a hair thin. Still, I like it quite a lot."
"Poured a dark brown with a nice tan head. When held up to light, it was dark ruby red. It looked like the red light district in amsterdam at around 3AM, pretty cool. Smelled sweet and malty, some hints of christmas flair-type spicing around the borders of my smell capabilities. The taste was very malt forward, with hoppy bitterness on the finish. Thick and gooey, the flavor got more interesting as the beer warmed. You defintely knew the alcohol was there the entire time, but it wasn't too overbearing. I am not a fan of the majority of christmas beers out there and this didn't break from that trend. Better then most holiday brews though and on a cold winter night, I could see sipping on one of these for an hour or so."
"Taste is of cocoa powder, sweet caramel, and raisins. There is a touch of bitter hops in the background. Finish is very dry and slightly acidic. I would prefer a more viscous mouthfeel. Not bad for the cold winter months, Not great though."
"First impressions: rich, slightly burnt malts, with winter spicing taking a back seat at first, yet after the beer goes down it's the spices and hops that linger on the palate, the hop bitterness stays for a bit. Yes, there's a nice hop presence for balance, nothing to extreme, but good to see considering a lot of winter warmers don't seem to care about hops. That's one thing I notice, the other thing is that it seems a lot fuller than other winter warmers. It's not thin at all, a nice rounded-out medium bodied beer. The carbonation helps promote a nice slick mouthfeel, slides right down the palate. The only thing I have against it is that while some hops are nice for balance, this one seems a little too hopped by my tastes, and for me, that takes away a bit from the drinkability. Keep in mind though, I love malt bombs and am less big on IPAs, so a lot of you folks will probably appreciate that quality more than I. I have to say, I didn't notice it was 8% ABV until I was halfway through the pint and looked at the top of the review page. The alcohol hotness doesn't really stands out, but blends with the bitterness a bit. Still, one of the better winter warmers out there it seems, and while not spectacular, not a bad brew during the long cold months."
"A clean dark brown beer. Has a nice creamy beige head and leaves good lace. The aroma has a nice sweet spice character. With a sweet toffee note and a good backbone of spice. As it warms notes of cinnamon, allspice and clove wander through the aroma. As the beer hits your mouth it is filled with flavor. Sweet toffee, spices, coffee and tobacco all run all over your tongue. Then there is a nice dry hop bitterness on the finish. This is a great winter treat."
"Overall an excellent Winter Warmer. One of the better ones I have had actually. Excellent balance and very drinkable. The alcohol content is also very well hidden."
"A nice Winter Warmer that fits the style well but doesn't particularly excel in any category. Old Jubilation has a nice appearance, deep brown liquid with a good beige head. The aroma is predominantly light malt with a metallic tinge. It's not bad but a bit weak. The taste is somewhat boring caramel malt with good spicing and a lightly bitter finish. The spices are particularly well done with clove and cinnamon dominant and never take on the annoying artificial character of so many other beers in the style. Unfortunately, Old Jubilation just fades into the background of my winter warmer memories. It's well done but a bit boring. I would recommend it to fans of the style or those looking for a simple entry point to winter warmers (of course, the latter seems like a bizarre audience that I just invented)."
"Poured with a nice large head and good lace. Brownish amber color. I claim an aroma sensory handicap due to sinus problems. With that, I can't smell a lot going on with this beer. Taste is way bigger though. Yum! Very malty, dark fruits, earth, leather, and a bit of toffee. Some booziness. Not really a session beer. Good for a cold snowy night. Pass the bottle."
"Drinkability: This beer is just above run of the mill for me. Nothing clearly stands out (hope that's not due to the IPA beforehand). I rated this beer a little low in drinkability based on the fact that there are so many great winter seasonals that I would go after rather than this beer. I intend on having it again and will change my rating if so be the case."
"D: Nicely done. I still have a couple more Winter Warmers to go through for 2008, but this one of the best I've had this year."
"D: ABV appears to be high, noticed in the flavor. solid beer for the holiday season. wonderful brew. about two of these should warm you up."
"D- Overall, Old Jubilation is a solid beer to enjoy on a cool night. The higher ABV limits the sessionability, but it is a solid brew that is worth a shot."
"Very drinkable. Go and get yourself some of this great beer. Drink it on a cold and rainy or snowy day."
"1/2 inch thick creamy head on top a body of dark orangish amber. The beer has a fruity aroma of oranges, a kick of anise, more orange, and more spice. Into the mouth it goes, the beer knocks down the door with a kick. Strong malty flavor upfront. Burnt sugar, syrupy, passionfruit...and what's that spice called I'm tasting? Piney too. I like this winter warmer...once you get passed how strong it is."
"Drinkability: I love how sessionable this one is, it's got great flavoring with the mix of spices and malt, yet the hops aren't muted too much, still prevalent to make it a bit bitter but boisterous on the tongue. An excellent winter warmer at 8.00ABV that nails down exactly what a good warmer should be like. Kudos to Avery."
"Drinkability is excellent for the style. I could easily have two more and not feel like the flavor is overdone. It's something I could see drinking anywhere from Sepetember to March. Very nicely done."
"I drink this first straight out of the bottle and really enjoyed it. The next day I was at home and was able to pour it in a glass. Poors an interesting amber brown color with a small bit of tanish white head. Has some sediment floating around the glass. The color is much lighter than I had anticipated. Has a nice mildly spicey taste with a nice caramel note and a hint of hops. Nice smooth mouthfeel and you cannot taste the 8% ABV. I would even consider this a session beer, but at 8% I better be careful."
"A well-balanced combination of hops, toasty malts, a bit of nutiness, and a drop of citrus, making you breathe in and out through your nose, continuously recyclying each flavor again and again. Much like the snow in a snowglobe, I can imagine it blowing from the back of my mouth, across its roof, and back atop the tongue. Undertones of cinnamon and spices tie it all together, making it an exceptional way to warm through the winter."
"Great winter warmer, easy to go down and want another. A keeper for the winter."
"I will surely buy this again."
"Overall: This is a nice beer with a good healthy dose of hops followed by a good malt complex laced with a nutty caramel, and molasses. It has a clean and easy finish. Enjoyed this spiciness of this Christmas ale."
"D: I'll try to drink this fresh but this is fairly solid."
"D - Nope!!! I don't think so. Maybe on the grandma sleigh to someplace really warm. No place where I want to go. See Ya."
"The dry hoppiness offers a decent drinkability factor, but the high alcohol content shows itself after one drink, and more than two would most likely be a bit too much. Overall, though, a superb, complex, and characterful Winter Warmer."
"Someone spilled their Scotch Ale in my English Strong Ale. Pours dark mahogany with a tiny tan head. Nice lacing. Aroma is nutty and full of roasted malts. But, this tastes a lot like a stronger black and tan or Scotch Ale. Very malty, very nutty, and a big finish of toffee and roasted malts. Almost too flavor without the alcohol you would expect. In the end, its still a good beer"
"Overall, I really like this beer and it's easily one of my favorite winter selections."
"Very easy drinking winter warmer, recommended."
"D: Pretty solid offering from Avery, enjoyed it very much and was glad for the chance. Good winter seasonal with mix of dark ale and not too heavy to drink. Enjoyed my first Avery and I'm looking forward to trying more of their higher rated options."
"The aroma has roasted malt, molasses, chocolate, vanilla, and fruit. The appearance is red/brown with am medium head. The flavor is like the aroma with more bitterness than I was expecting. The palate is soft and smooth. The aftertaste is toasted malt and nuts. Overall I like it."
"Drinkability: A solid, enjoyable winter warmer. Very crisp, bright, and festive, with very well hidden alcohol. Dunno if I'd make it a seasonal go-to beer, but I'm definitely glad I tried it."
"Some warming spice flavors come through in the flavor..heavy toasted malts blend with dark fruits to create what's almost like a robust apple cider. Very fitting for the upcoming season, i must say. A solid brew from Avery."
"The aroma was not spicy which I have become accustomed to with the winter warmer but was more of chocolate aroma and maltiness. The taste was again that choco flavor and toffee sweetness. The finish is toffee on the the tongue and a chocolate malt that lasts quite awhile. The abv is a good and leaves you warm in the cheeks. Overall a wonderful winter and I only wish it was more accessible. I picked it up at John's Market."
"Burnt amber color poured with a towering light tan head that remained 1/2"" thick for the entire time (surprising considering the strong alcohol content). Powerful carbonation inside the glass. Drinkable and lightly warming. Only wish it were fuller, but it's still a hearty brew. Aroma has a thick malt scent with some grassy yeast. Taste is oh so slightly bitter at first soon mellowed by the thick malts with a tinge of alcohol burn. A touch of nuttiness. This one really gets bitter after a while, different but nice."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, considering the alcohol level. I'm usually not a huge fan of winter warmers, but this one is pretty damned good."
"Another good beer from Avery. It is a good representation of the style. I enjoy it, and get some every year. This is something I would recommend."
"Pours a reddish-brown color body, fizzy. Huge tan head, okay lacing, foamy. Not too strong an aroma. Some grapefruit & hops, but very weak. Malt, coffee flavor, watery, smoky. Some spices. English alcoholy taste. Coffee aftertaste, almost porter-like."
"Really smooths out. Nose has gained subtle hints of dark fruits. The hops that were there have faded a bit, specialty malts have melded into a slightly spicy sweetness; not as messy as before, but still retained complexity. Alcohol is dangerously undetectable. Not a big beer anymore. If I didn't know the ABV I would say this is a session beer. Mouthfeel is smooth now. Definitely an improvement that deserves some extra points."
"Poured this deep robust dark red into a pint glass. There was low foam at the beginning but it reduced to a large amount of lacing. Hints of juniper and cherry mix the aroma while the spices tickle the senses. Malt greets the mouth and gives the juniper and cherry mix in the palate of the mouth. Changing to the warmth of a winter beer and the spices that linger in the after taste."
"The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than expected, its rather smooth. The abv is deceiving until the aftertaste where you are able to get that warming feeling as it goes down. A very pleasant winter warmer"
"D: Very drinkable for all the flavors and big malt and fruit tastes."
"Medium/heavy bodied, filling, but smooth and easy to drink. A very nice winter drink, especially after a holiday meal."
"Overall, very old ale, and good for a winter evening."
"D - ok drinkablity for the high strength"
"I loved this one..."
"mouth is medium, nice carbonation. goes down easy and smooth, such a start to the winter season of beer"
"D-This one will find its way to my fridge this winter more than once, very easy to drink."
"I knew this beer is a year old but knew it was 8% ABV so it would hold up well, but I'm not sure how it was stored. It was very foamy on the pour.. indicating a little bit of ""lack of freshness"" to the beer. Anywho, I thought it just an above average beer. For 8% it isn't harsh by any means and goes down easy, but I find it lacking in taste and aroma. Both seem to be a bit subdued especially for this style.. not sure if it's related to the oldness of it. But, I'd try a fresh one again for sure."
"Pours a very dark mahogany with about a finger of light khaki head. Aroma is rather subdued, some malts, piney hops, some spices and a bit of alcohol. Taste is fairly malty throughout. Midway through the taste I begin to detect some spices and alcohol. A solid piney hop character is present throughout but begins to build up and becomes very prominent in the finish. Mouthfeel is ok with medium body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty average. Overall I found this beer to be rather pedestrian with too much alcohol presence. I really didn't enjoy it all that much."
"2.5 on the positive side, there are some things going on. but they don't come together harmoniously. this definitely reminds me of one of my old homebrew experiments that went a bit awry. i've had every bottle of a sixpack over the course of several months, and still can't figure out why this beer is rated so well."
"I've been told this cellars very well. Well see how it is after some years are put on it."
"An auburn body with some dark tints and a good, two-finger head that left some lacings. A sweet malt smell like caramel is in there, along with some dry hops and hints of earthiness. Even with a minor alcohol burn, not warming sensation, on the backend, this beer is great. Flows down smooth with loads of malts on the tastebuds, has somewhat of a sweetness to it and has that dry backbite, although like previously said it can get a tad rough as it warms. Hints of citric hops as well. Good winter beer."
"Recommended..."
"Pours a dark caramely red,when back lit it reveals some small floaties,the head is a medium beige with good retention and small lacing as it falls to a thin sheet. The nose is malty and sweet,with just a touch of alcohol and leather,I'm intrigued! This Ale is packed with big caramel malts roasted just beyond medium,some dark fruits blend in unison with some light smokey sausage flavors,yuuummmy. This Ale has a medium to full body,leaning toward the lighter side. Definitely a warmer,nice softness to the body,with a sweet,alcohol finish. A top notch offering from Avery."
"D: Pretty darn sweet, so it's hard to gulp. This one is a sipper for sure."
"The drinkability is just fine the is a good Winter Warmer for me as I don't go for the spice much. Prosit, MK"
"D: Pretty drinkable and all the flavors blend very well together and it seems to age well."
"I detect no inkling of the ABV in the drink, but the warming in my belly belies the true nature of this friendly beast. Great drinkability, and it's 90 outside!"
"D- the year this has sat in the cellar has worked out in this ones favors. ill be interested to find out what else happens to it. ill try this one again."
"Good beer."
"Drinkability- It is a good beer for the season, especially with desserts. ""Cakes and pies"""
"D- Eh... one seems to be enough for me. This is a big beer with some nice complexities. I tend to sip this one and relax. Given I am tasting this in July, might be able to pack more away in the depths of December."
""
"D: Pretty drinkable, not for the summer month I broke it out for, but still very nice. Really feels like winter in the blend of flavors."
"Above average for a winter ale."
"I would drink this beer again and wish I could get it here in Michigan."
"Drinkability: A contenting drink, but doesn't beckon to be followed with another. One is fulfilling enough for me."
"D - Very significant caramel character. Nice example of the style, but the oxidized notes are a bit too much."
"A nice winter warmer and pretty easy to drink. Definitely one for the colder months."
"Well, I was doing some spring cleaning of the beer fridge and saw that I had missed this winter warmer. Whoops. Old Jubilation pours a deep, clear, reddish-amber color, with hints of orange and a pretty creamy light tan lid. Quite sweet and malty nose with lots of plum and red grape fruitiness, and hints of spice. The flavor is chocolatey malts at first, with a nice fruitiness and a lightly bitter and spicy lingering along with a touch of alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is soft, pleasant and creamy. This stuff is pretty good, but not really stand-outish. Maybe I'm just not in the mood for the style though."
"My 700th review! Good choice Gary. :)"
"D- pretty solid"
"D- Very nice brew. Maybe a bit more of a sipper and would like to have again."
"nice drinkability"
"Overall - I liked it a lot. Smooth and alcoholic. Warming and and sweet. A good winter ale and a nice smooth olde."
"Clear dark ruby colored pour. Smell is slightly chocolately malt but not a rich roasty chocolate smell. Taste is the same, except with an unpleasant alcohol taste to finish. No need for this to taste as alcoholic as it does, and it really detracts from the decent flavor. Still, overall it's thin, boring and the alcohol doesn't fit well. Unimpressed."
"It's an ok warmer but one at a time is enough"
"Not a complex beer but it is also well-balanced and full flavored."
"Drinkability- Looks like this one is 4's across the board. Not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination. Well spiced with the American touch that would be expected of Avery. A nice winter warmer for a blizzard, which is just what I was hoping for."
"Dark mahogany with a silky tan head. Good lacing and retention. Smell is of dark dried fruits and sweet malts. A faint hop presence adds some spice. Taste is very malty with some molasses, plums, figs, caramel and earthy hops. Good fullbody with medium carbonation. A nice example of the style."
"Pours a dull semi-clear brown with a very thin head. Aroma is sweet, dark brown sugar. Taste has a bit of the brown sugar, but more overripe fruit. Fruit rapidly gives way to a very alcoholic, solvent finish. A bit of harshly astringent (hops?) flavors come out as it warms. Not enjoyable. I'll pass on this one next time."
"The bottom line: A serviceable warmer, but not what I prefer in the style. Low on my list of potential rebuys, and not something that I will likely have again."
"D-After it warms a bit the flavors start to meld better. Becomes a tasty brew....but not one that I could sit and enjoy all night long. A solid effort."
"Special thanks to ilovedarkbeer (on ratebeer). Smells sweet and fruity with cookie malts, cherries and hazlenut. Beautiful dark red-brown color with some small particles floating around. There is a small creamy head with excellent lacing. Taste is of chocolate malts and is somewhat bitter at the end. Taste reminds me of a Porter a bit. Medium to full body with a dry mouthfeel and a bit too fizzy carbonation. Overall very good!"
"Drinkability: A disapointment all around. No need to visit this beer again."
"UPDATE! It is now 2010, 2 years after this review was written and here is my follow-up. Still very bitter. Great malt profile and maybe it is my age, but I don't mind the less than average carbonation and actually I think it fits the style pretty well, so I will change my mouthfeel score."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful malt scent that boasts of burnt toffee and roasted malts. The taste is good as well. It is a very malty brew with a sweet crystal malt flavor up front and a roasted malt finsh. The 8% abv. is well hidden was just minimal warmth. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with perfect carbonation. This is a great winter warmer. It's rich and flavorful with that warmth you need for those cold winter days."
"D- nicely balanced though hoppy for style (not complaining), a winter warmer for the hop loving crowd, worth a drink"
"I was not that impressed with this beer."
"Mmmm, yeah, I like this. I could drink a few more of these for sure. Never would guess it's 8% as it's hidden very well. This is a fine winter brew for a cold winter's night."
"Pours a clean deep amber/ copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, cinnamon and nutmeg spices. In the taste, primarily cinnamon and nutmeg spices. A spicy bite in the mouthfeel and a semi dry cinnamon spice in the aftertaste. Big in cinnamon, very nice, yet nothing to out of the ordinary for a winter beer."
"Overall: This is one the the premier winter warmers as far as I am concerned. A perfect balance of malt and hops, full of character and the robust taste you need this time of year. Excellent!"
"Pours a clear dark brown with a creme head that rises and falls just about as fast. Nice caramel laiden sweet nose. Flavor profile is nice. Nice smooth sweet tones with woody after edges to it. Smooth liquid feel and a biting carbonation. Very easy to drink. A nice winter warmer."
"The ale despite its size slides down very easily and could result in an unintended nap. I really had to pace myself to make it through the playoff game."
"I saw this brew tonight and decided to give it a try, which IMO turned out to be a very good decision. The brew poured to a nice clear auburn color with a solid sized medium tan head that had good retention and left nice lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma was nice, sweet malt backbone with a nice hop presence that seemed to be floral giving a nice mix. Also a touch of alcohol is noticeable and welcome. The flavors are very good, malt really sticks out at first along with a warm feel from a nice alcohol taste. The finish is a mouth coating hop flavor that give a nice bittering spicy. Overall this is a nice brew, one I would get again. A great pickup tonight."
"D - really enjoyable; too bad it wasn't a bid colder out last night for this winter warmer! I could definitely see hunkering down in the pub and rocking a few of these though; it wasn't available in bottles around here (hardly anything from Avery is it seems like) but I would've picked it up"
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of brownish red, with a tan colored head - nose of hops, dried vegetation, and red cherries  taste of hops, sweet, lime zest, alcohol, and syrup- body is medium, and robust , and with low carbonation  aftertaste of red fruit, citrus zest, and hops"
"Update January 2010: The beer is quite clear, not cloudy at all. There are ABV warming notes to the beer than I first reviewed. The beer is quite sweet too. I'm getting slightly less of the butterscotch on the tongue, a bit more ABV and sweet malts, some spiciness too."
"Due to it's high abv and resultant ""heat", this beer comes closer to truly being a winter warmer that any other beer I've had this season. For that reason, I'd probably decline several of them at a sitting. But as a night cap or a beer to revivify meself with after being out in the cold, I'd happily quaff this beer."
"This beer pours a fairly clear dark brown with nice amber highlights and a thin off-white head. The aroma is moderately malty; roasty, some dark fruit, fruity esters and a bit of alcohol. The flavor is rather sour; moderately malty-some roast and dark fruit. There is a also a bit of an alcohol bite and medium-low bitterness. The body and carbonation are medium. The overly sour nature of the beer leads to low drinkability. Overall I could not get past the sour flavor. I think the bottle may have been a bad one, but Ive had old/oxidized beer before and that is not the case here. A disappointment from a brewery that has satisfied me in the past."
"Overall this was easily my favorite of all the winter beers I have had so far this year. Almost perfectly created you really could not go wrong here. I would have gladly put down a few more of these, as they were just that good. A very solid offering and one that is sure to please. I would have to highly recommend this one."
"Best winter warmer yet. There are other seasonals that I like better, but for the style, this is it. Wish I had bought more than one bottle."
"Drinkability: This is probably the best winter warmer I have ever had, and I'm not a big fan of the style. In fact, it's probably my least favoritre style. So for a beer like this to impress me, is seldom seen. Overall, thebest winter warmer I've had. Nice for Xmas Eve. Worth trying, and possibly aging, to calm the lingering bitterness. Will age my other bottle."
"m: medium to full bodied beer with a good amount of carbonation"
"Overall- Despite any critical remarks in my review, it's really a solid beer. For whatever reason, the flavor just didn't really do it for me."
"D: Pretty good. For a pretty heavy offering, I didn't feel myself getting bogged down."
"Poured into a pint glass. It poired a dark brown almost black color, with a white 1 finger head and minimal laceing.The aroma was of roasted malts with a hint of coffee. The overall taste was a strong malty flavor with a hint of roasted malt after taste. The mouthfeel of this beer is very watery and light. And the overall drinkability of this beer is decent. If I can buy a single, I would go that route, but personally wouldn't drink an entire 6-pack of this stuff. It's a decent beer that I would recomend somone to try, but I wouldn't make the effort to find this beer anywhere if it's not readily available in your area."
"Overall, a very nice winter beer. Seasonal spices and warming alcohol make this perfect for a cold winter night."
"Anyone looking to try and cellar this I recommend as this was a 2006."
"Drinkability is good. Nice Winter Warmer that I am glad I was able to get my hands on at a local store. Definitely worth a try, and a nice beer for the cold weather."
"Crisp and clean mouthfeel initially with a nice warm finish. Medium to full bodied with moderate to high carbonation. The carbonation and the fruity finish make for a refreshing example of a winter warmer."
"This is quite good, yet another gem from the hopped haven that is Avery. I'll certainly grab a couple sixers for storage, since I'm sure this Winter Warmer will be needed to beat back the Midwestern cold. Delicious."
"Pours a clear red-tinted amber capped with a fluffy tanish head that settles slowly and leaves decent lace. The nose has a bit plum like sweetness and plenty of spicy, piney hops. Alcohol comes through in the nose. On the palate malt sweetness is short-lived before giving way to the strong hops flavors and medium-high bitterness. Alcohol has a definite, biting presence and sticks in the mouth for the short, bitter finish. Medium and light carbonation mouthfeel with large alcohol presence. Drinks fairly easily for the ABV, but makes a nice sipper. The high bittering and alcohol keep it from being greatly sessionable, but a few of these would certainly warm a cold winter night."
"Overall a nice winter ale. Cheers"
"Very dark brown with a soap-sud beige head, had to pour kind of aggressively to get the head to show up. Whoa, it smells like alcohol just pouring it. I'm getting some dried fruit smells here too and some kind of funkiness.. not exactly bread-maybe kind of chocolatey? Ok, on to the taste. Doesn't feel as heavy in my mouth as a stout or a porter, but it's not light bodied. Finishes a bit dry, with a little taste of hops back there and a little taste of alcohol, but its not overwhelming like I expected from the pour. I'm not getting a lot on the front end, maybe some chocolate and bread flavors like the smell again. This is a tasty beer--a little different than I expected, but I haven't had a lot of this style. Looks like I have more research to do this winter."
"Poured almost black but not quite. not much head. smelled like a lot of hops and a little spicy, some plum-like fruittyness. i havent had many of the winter warmer style, but this brew was a lot hoppier than i expected. to the ipa level even. this is not a bad thing, as i love hops, but while the beer was still cold the spices were barely detectable at all. as it warmed a bit of cinnamon emerged, and thats about all. tasted like a victory hop devil but with a more snappy spice taste. regardless, though, this one was real tasty. effectively hidden alcohol, low carbonation, and a medium body makes it dangerously drinkable. wish i picked up a 6 pack instead of a single 12 oz. recommended."
"D: Pretty good. No alcohol taste/feel."
"Poured a beautiful deep red with an inch head that had good staying power and left nice lacing all the way down the pint. Aroma was failry sweet. Initial taste is almost, but not quite cloyingly sweet, with hints of raisins and prunes on the finish. The alcohol shows itself just a bit in heat, but just enough to make this a real ""warming"" winter ale. One of the best winter beers I've had, must find more!"
"Tastes mainly of sweet doughy caramelized malt, and appley plummy whiskeylike solvent. Some balancing hop flavor and bitterness, but solventy fusel alcohol and/or esters dominates the finish. Certainly warming, and oddly alluring, but in an Edgar Allan Poe way, not a ""jubilation"" way."
"Dark brown appearance with ruby red highlights when held to the light with a pillowy white head that lingers. Smells of malts, toffee and spices. Maybe a hint of cinnamon, fruity esters and some citrus hops. Tastes malty, pretty sweet and a definite hop presence that isn't overwhelming but was unexpected. A little alcoholic but I couldn't really tell it was 8%. Medium bodied with a nice carbonation and mouthfeel. One of those beers that is kind of a sipper because of all the flavor but you can't take it away from your mouth so the drinkability is above average for the style. Would definitely buy again."
"Poured amber-garnet with a rich, creamy head. Smelled of whole-grain bread and sunflower seeds with some nice fruity esters and hop bitterness. Flavors of whole grain bread mingled with a hop bite and metallic undertones; some nice, sharp, fruity hop layers occupy the taste buds for the majority of the taste. The alcohol is late in coming and doesnt taste as strong as it really is, noticeable only after a few sips as it begins to warm the insides. The low point of this beer was the distracting metallic aftertaste. But eventually the 8% ABV takes over and warms the insides. All is forgotten."
"I haven't had too much experience with Avery brews, but their winter warmer was an excellent foray. If they hit home runs like this often, I might have to put them into my regular rotation."
"M/D: Carbonation is spot on in this one with a medium body that is a little thin. Drinkability is nice as well although I get the feeling that the 8% will catch up with you sooner rather than later."
"The color was a medium deep brown with a reddish hue when poured. Very little foam, but what little foam their was left a little lace on the side of the glass. The smell of roasted malts and hops filled the nose with a pleasant aroma, with just a slight hint of fruit and alcohol to finish out the aroma. The taste was of roasted malts, medium hops, with a fruity aftertaste with just a hint of alcohol. Not overpowering on the flavor, but well balanced. I would think to let it rest a couple of months and would even be more complex than it is now! I like it, another winner from Avery!"
"This one is dangerously drinkable. I'll definitely be buying more of this during the season. Awesome example of the style."
"t: the taste almost seems to have some chocolate notes in it with some very vague fruit its a good beer with a well balanced taste. nothing insane, nothing too mellow, just around good"
"Drinkability: Sit by the fire and realx, it might take you a while to finish this one. With its heavy alcohol presence and thick mouthfeel, this is a very enjoyable sipping beer. I might try it with a rich smoked chipotle barbeque dish, or maybe a spicy Chinese food. But it might be best by itself after dinner."
"D: A fantastic sipper. Even if it gets to room teperature."
"Pours a dark amber with a one-finger off white head that sticks around a bit. Smells of roasted malts. Tastes of malts, some raisins, a slight bit of coffee and almonds. Mouth-feel is smooth. This beer is quite drinkable with the alcohol being well-hidden at first with some slight heat at the end. I could have a few of these on a cold day like this."
"Not my favorite winter brew - I would reach for a Hibernation before this one any day."
"Rich mouthfeel, tingly on the tongue, full in the cheeks, slightly warming in the finish."
"Clear brown in color with some bronze tints. Thin head that leaves no lacing. Not much to look at. Things start looking up at the first sniff. Roasted maltyness, nuts and some booze burn. Taste falls right into line with the smell. The taste is nice and solid but in the end it comes across somewhat subdued. Nothing really stands out and gives that wow sensation. Finishes dry with no aftertaste. Overall a solid beer that is worth trying but it didn't knock my socks off."
"Pours a dark amber/brown with little to no cabonation. The coarse head was minimal and left quickly, no biggy though. Nice burned malty aroma. Taste is initially hoppy, piney and citrusy. However, it quickly reveals a healthy malty nutty backbone, nice and roasted. Nice mellow finish, doesn't linger too long. No real spice to it, seems more like a mild American barleywine. Overall it is a very good beer and I will be consuming more on these chilly nights we are starting to have."
"I like this beer. Enjoyed the full glass, but that funky bitterness at the end becomes a touch overwhelming. Definitely worth a try, but I'm not drinking more than one in a sitting."
"Taste finds itself meandering around my tongue and mouth. Creamy mellow base of yeast, vanilla, and spice split between a slight hop citrus bitterness."
"I love that Avery can brew this holiday beer. I am slowly gaining more and more respect for Avery brewery."
"Drinks really good for the abv, makes me wish for some roast pork or goose. I do think the dryness would get to me before the abv,"
"I really liked this beer. Nothing really stands out, but nothing really detracts from it either. It is solid and enjoyable."
"Pours a rich brownish, red color with a nice frothy off white head. Smell is sweet, with a bready, doughy type aroma too. Sweet caramel malt as well. Taste is dried, fruits, and some viney grape flavors. A little watery, with some light carbonation."
"Drinkable and enjoyable even when the weather hasn't yet turned cold. Avery pleases once again."
"Worth checking out!"
"Drinkability: Perhaps not the most drinkable on a 90 degree day, but this would improve come fall and winter. Would not want another on a hot night, should come back to review this winter to see if this changes. Good beer, just not a good hot summer night brew."
"D: Another good Winter Warmer, I enjoyed it even though it is 80 degrees out here everyday on the coast, one of Avery's better brews in my opinion."
"pours a very dark brown color with a one inch light tan head that holds well and a good amount of lacing. fresh coffee smell along with some fruity notes. taste, again fresh brewed mild coffee with ripe fruit in the background some kind of melon maybe? also slightly sweet tasting. mouthfeel is light, very smooth, and light to medium carbonation. overall a nice fall, winter very drinkable beer."
"I did feel that it was perfect in terms of drinkability. I was commenting that it must be a lower alcohol, thinking of an English Bitter, allowing you to drink several in a short amount of time - but was wrong. I still think you could easily drink several of these in a night, but you will be feeling it!"
"Drinking a fresh one in 2011, it is not as well behaved on the mouthfeel. The taste also is a bit harsh, needing mellowing, so aging a few months apparently helps. It smells much better, though - a 4+."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a dark amber-brown color with a thin, creamy-looking head. Beer has a sweet malty presence with vanilla and caramel notes. Smells like candy. The taste is also quite sweet, there is an amber/caramel maltyness and the alcohol is pretty well covered. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly creamy finish. Drinkability is decent, not a quaffer though."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this is a nice change from what I'm used to. Nothing too unusual, mind you, but nice malty beer."
"There is a nice soft mouthfeel to this warming brew. This is a good winter warmer, tastes like an Amber Imp Stout maybe, to throw words together."
"Nice. I regret not opening this one sooner."
"I still think I like this best fresh, but it is not bad aged. Recommended."
"Deep, dark brown with a good, thick, creamy white head that takes minutes to settle. Smells of toffee, chocolate, piney hops. Tastes of sweet malts, slight hop presence, end with an alcohol bite. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel. Very sweet, very syrupy. Good beer, Nice warmer."
"Pours a dark mahogany, with a tan head that dies down but swirls on the top and leaves rings on the pint glass most of the way down. Smells wonderfull, but very unlike a typical warmer -- more like a double. Plum, fig, cherry ride over a chocolate-caramel malt with none of the spiciness that I associate with winter beers. A delectable dessert. Tastes much the same, but less pleasurable for whatever reason. Like some malty fruitcake, it's got a creamy mouthfeel and a suprisingly dry finish. It masks the 8% very well, just the warmth makes it through, not the fire. It is more drinkable than most dubbels, actually, but compared to other warmers, I think it's too sweet to drink more than one unless you've got a real craving. Look forward to picking these up again next year..."
"Alcohol? Where is it? Great job of hiding the high ABV, and with just a few tweaks this could be great. I could drink a few."
"Solid medium brown pour with yellow/brown head. Head held at about 3/4 inch until dissolving to a thin lacing on surface of beer and around glass. Smells barleywine-sweetish, notes of fruit (strawberry?) and some generic licorice. First sip impressions: bitter! strong, full mouthfeel. Toffee flavor, more berry. Wow, is this stuff good. Very rich, amazing feel on the palate. I just got some old school bubblegum, you know the rock hard sticks of bubblegum that came in Topps baseball card packs in the late 80s? That is the prevailing aftertaste right now. A nice, almost spicy bitter cocoa comes through quite soon in the pint. This is a fantastic English Strong Ale."
"D - Okay. It is an enjoyable beer, component by component there isn't much to complain about, but the gestalt of the beer just didn't click with me for some reason. I might try it again and find it more enjoyable at a later date."
"Poured from the bottle to a regular old 12-oz pint glass. Nice deep amber brown color with some orange tint when held up to the light. Good looking, thick and creamy head settles on top, and leaves a nice lace as the beer recedes. The aroma is a dull, muted malt scent. Nothing special, but definitely more malty than hoppy. It does mellow out a bit as the beer warms to room temperature, and reveals some fruitier tones. The taste is quite good. Rich malt flavor with notes of caramel, plum, and coffee. Possesses a nice hoppy balance, even the hops are not terribly prominent. Very nice beer, here. Mouthfeel is sturdy, but a bit thinner than I might expect from a warmer. The high ABV is masked neatly by a slew of quality ingredients and excellent brewing. More high marks for Avery."
"Very good and easy too drink."
" smooth, rich and complex, this is my favorite winter warmer selection this year."
"Overall, this is a very ""big"" winter warmer (big on both taste and alcohol). While I enjoyed this beer, I felt the alcohol overshadowed many of its better aspects. Nevertheless, I would definitely prefer this to many of the more typical examples of the style."
"Comments: This would be a nice one to accompany a rich, warm dessrt like a christmas pudding & brandy butter."
"D: This is one of the better winter warmers I have tried this season. Big bold flavors and alcohol do not get in the way of this beer's drinkability."
"D: This could be my favorite winter warmer. Perfect sipping brew for a cold, snowy day. A definite ""must buy"" each winter season."
"Beef Notes: I'm certainly glad I picked up this holiday offering. I'll be looking for it next year."
"Overall an excellent brew, and was a great way to warm up after coming inside in an Ithaca blizzard. Warms me right up. Probably could be a little less hoppy, but that's just my taste."
"D - This is a very good winter warmer. A nice spicy/hoppy beer on a cold snowy night."
"I gotta be honest, this is super malty and smooth. I like."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; mouthfeel is medium bodied, and very smooth, with a bit of alcohol in the finish giving it a bit of a drying character. Drinkability is really good, especially if you like lots of roasted malt flavors."
"Drinkability: A great label on the bottle doesn't make for a great beer, but this one did. The dark roasted flavors can warm you up on a very cold day. Would I drink this again? I sure would, even in the summer time I could drink this beer. Is this another good Avery beer? Yeah, it is! If you like malty roasty winter warmers, then this is the beer you should pick up."
"Drinkability - While nothing in this beer stood out to me as being exceptional (ok, the smell was really good), I'm very drawn to this beer. It just has a nice, comfortable feeling that, well, does a good job of warming you up, just like it's supposed to. Not at all over the top, a quality beer."
"The taste is an understated sweetness that immediately goes to a spicy flavor of earthy hops and black pepper, among others. As this rolls across your tounge you know it's a heavy beer, but one you will find yourself coming back to again and again."
"Pours a dark hazelnut color and red hues up to the light. Nice creamy off white head and good retention and lacing to the end. Nutty malt nose and wafting bright fruit notes. Nice rich malt complexities, charred espresso, slight alcohol burn, roasty caramel, light molasses, and some faint licorice notes. Complimentary spicy hop balance that is bitter but not overpowering. Roasted woody finish. Medium carbonation and a thin and watery mouthfeel with just a little fizz around the edges that gets a little silkier as the glass goes down. This is a good beer to have on a cold night by the fire"
"Bottle: Poured a deep burgundy color ale with a nice medium foamy head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of deep malt with some sweet dry fruits is really enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by the sweet malt with some presence of dry fruits and a hoppy slightly bitter finish. Body is above average with a nice level of carbonation and no alcohol is discernable."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - this is very good ale, and only the high abv suppresses sessionability. This is very hearty, and I wish it was a year round option."
"UPDATE 1/4/11: Just had a two-year old bottle. While I wouldn't let it go any longer (oxidation was starting to creep in), this was a fantastic beer with a great mix of cocoa, fruit and subtle earthy spices."
"Overall,a very good winter beer."
"D - A pleasant winter warmer that will most likely satisfy, but its high ABV can get to you after a few. For my money though, I would probably go with Odell Isolation over this beer, although they are both worth the money and time."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"clear, dark brown with ruby sparkles. no head, but cavernously cascading lace lingers in lascivious layers. aroma is plum weird. speaking of plums, they're there.. plus grapes. something creamy like an artificial vanilla milkshake complements an almond nutty waft. confusing, not really appetizing. scotch aley at first, then the grape takes over followed by scratchy hop earthiness. sorely lacking in a resiny juiciness which would provide some balance and cover the sweet astringency here. unbalanced and existing blandly between strong ale styles. fails to define itself with substance or spice. there might be some bitterness like raw nutmeg or cinnamon stick, but it's not flavorful. will not repeat."
"Nicely crafted brew that fits it's style very well. I'd buy more."
"Drinkability and Notes: A very nice holiday beer, reminded me of Anchor's production. Has that musty character."
"The body is good and supports the complex malty flavor. Good carbonation. One deterrent is the phenolic flavor that leaves a harsh alcoholic after taste. Although this is not obnoxious it still is there. Overall I really enjoyed this beer and very nice warming flavors on a cold winter night."
"Medium body with active carbonation...almost too active for a winter warmer IMO. Nice brew to have around the holidays, but if it only could match it appearance it would outstanding."
"Good beer, but not really sessionable in my opinion. 2 or 3 would probably do the trick. I would prefer a bit more hops and/or spices to liven it up a little."
"This is a very tasty malty beer that hides its 8% alcohol very well. The mouthfeel was a tad bit thin, but otherwise I really enjoyed this beer. I look forward to getting more of it next year."
"Merry Christmas"
"This beer is awesome and quite nice as compared to some of the spice bombs you get in a winter seasonal. I will drink this again for certain."
"Fairly drinkable, but there is something curiously lacking here."
"A mighty and tasty beer here that is among the best of the winter warmers. The main feature of this beer is it is perfectly in balance with all its parts. A tasty beer that isn't overly sweet, bitter, spiced or dumbed down to suit the Budweiser fans. One of the better beers that Avery makes probably the best one in fact."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a amazing dark murky brownish black with a serious thick head that leaves some big time lace on the mug, this is one fine looking brew and one of the best I have ever seen. Smell is of some dark roasted malty yeasty smells with a bit of some hop presents. Taste is of a malty good time, I can taste about 4 different malt flavors in there like roasted chocolate and figs and nuts, this taste as awesome as it smells. This is a fine drink to behold and one that goes well with that holiday mood, Happy Holidays!!"
"Deep, clear garnet-brown with a massive undulating cloud of khaki-cream foam; killer frothy lacing. First whiffs are faint and of rasin-studded poundcake; then a huskier grain mash aroma settles in, providing chocolate and slightly overripe apple notes. There's a surprising vinous quality to the flavor, with black cherries, plum juice, and a slight cinnamon bitterness at the back. A noticeable alcoholic sharpness finishes the swallow, all angular-like, leaving a woody-earthy-vegetal kiwi fruit dryness in the aftertaste. Substantial abv (8%) lends a decidedly slick quality to the mouthfeel. A very slight peppery sensation as it goes down. This is a fine brew, but it leaves me somewhat puzzled and unmoved. I'm really going out of my way this year to try as many winter seasonals as I can, and I must say I still am having trouble getting my head around what ""Winter Warmer"" means stylistically speaking. That said, I will revisit this beer to see if it grows on me anymore."
"A very likable beer, and a real pleasure to drink. Impressive."
"Interesting, very interesting."
"D- This beer has a slight sweetness from the malt that blends into a bitterness from the hops that don't really work with each other."
"D: Well, if that dirty flavor hadn't popped up, I think I would have rated this beer much higher. It is what it is."
"This is a very drinkable beer but not sessionable due to the alcohol content. It is, however, a pretty good sipper."
"Reminds me of a min-barleywine in some respects, but rather mild in flavor. An interesting Winter Warmer to try, but one I probably won't be going back to."
"D - Pretty damn good. The extrra full body and the sweetness may hinder sessionability, but that's not the point with this beer. Sip slowly and enjoy this wonderful winter warmer!"
"Cheers!"
"D: A nice example of the style. Satisfying blend of flavors and aroma, easy to drink. When my wife poured it, tasted and brought it over, saying, ""oh, I KNOW you'll like this...", how could I go wrong?"
"Pretty good effort by Avery but there are better examples of the style available."
"Overall a good beer, not great. Probably not my favorite of the style."
"Overall expected something spicier. Came off more of an old ale type brew. ETOH snuck up on me either way."
"D: Nice seasonal beer. No spices, just a dark, malty backdrop for a hop explosion. Strong beer, but the alcohol sneaks up on you."
"I'm delighted beyond words that our little muni decided to pick this up. I expect I'll be drinking a lot of this over the winter months."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer and one of Avery's best. It's also inexpensive, which is an added bonus. A great seasonal beer and well worth seeking out."
"Very drinkable. Quite refreshing. Rich and sharp Winter Warmer taste and feel. Nice blend of malt and hop."
"Color: Very dark Amber"
"Old Jubillation pours an opaque dark brown with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I mostly notice the hops in the aroma, alcohol is definitely there too. There's a chocolate note that is quite nice that dominates the flavor, hops are also quite noticeable. The alcohol really isn't noticeable in the flavor. Pretty good overall."
"D - Quite drinkable. I could drink this all winter."
"Drinkability: This brew suffers a tad with drinkability only because the bitter aftertaste. I like the aftertaste, but it slows you down a bit."
"I definately have to stock up to last me through the year."
"I like that its not overly-spiced if at all. Perhaps a little different than the norm for this style but up on my list. Seems like it could somehow possibly (though not likely) be a sessionable full bodied winter beer."
"A malty brew that is a little on the sweet side. Very nicely done. Flavors are balanced and enjoyable. There is also enough complexity too keep you interested. A great session brew for the holidays. For best results let this one warm a bit. Recommended."
"What a delicious malty treat this is. Stuck inside on a cold day? This'll put you in a good mood. Its not a huge beer, but its probably worth cellaring to see what would happen to it."
"The Old Jubilation poured a dark opaque brown, only to turn to a see-thru red when held up to the light. Very similar appearance to a porter, with a thin off white head as well. Smells of roasted malts and a little nuttiness. The taste is very very smooth and well put together, very similar to a standard porter to me. The moutfeel is just towards the slick side with a good bit of carbonation as well. The high alcohol doesn't really show through too much until it warms up."
"Wonderful brew. I'll certainly be checking this one out again."
"The alcohol level is just right. They say this brew really shines at about two years in the cellar."
"The aroma and flavor of this beer seems to go perfectly with the cold winter days. Recommended."
"Pours a mysteriously dark brown, almost black, that only gives off highlights when held up to direct light. Sticky Brussels lace gets left behind in spite of a head that starts out fluffy and ends up sparse. The aroma has very prominent hops, metallic and cirtusy with a minimal malt payload that shows up mostly as a graham crackery smell. On the palate, the first thing to come out are sweet malts that remind me of sweetened citrus fruits. After that, the hop bitterness arrives, tickling the sides of the tongue. The finish is long and actively bitter, with plenty of action on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is prominently harsh with hop oils and relatively unbalanced by malts, especially for a beer of this style. Overall, this is a hop-head's winter warmer, with little in the way of malt feel and balance, but it is nonetheless pretty tasty."
"Pretty drinkable. I can take down a few of these relatively easily."
"This beer has a lot of flavor and body; a nice, warming brew. A little heavy to drink more than one, but one is really nice."
"An interesting pour that starts as a medium-brown with tons of bubbles but quickly becomes a dark cola-like color with thin, but prevalent lacing. The smell is nice with dark roasted malts the most prevalent. The taste is smooth and sweet with a bitter, dark coffee-like finish. Noticeable taste of the alcohol as well. A weak-mild low carbonated mouthfeel. Will definitely warm the body. Solid choice."
"Deep brown color with mahogany highlights, and topped by a light, short lasting tan colored head. A delicate lace is left on the side of the glass as I drink the beer. The nose is reminiscent of a belgian dubbel. It has layers of dark fruit. Dates, figs, mild dark berry are blended well with some mild spice. The flavor echoes the nose well. More of the dark fruit. The date really comes across strongly. Spice is milder than I expected. The finish has a lingering bitterness. Hard to characterize. The spice does not meld well with the citrus hops. Still, this is a nice winter warming beer. The mouth feel is full, and smooth. Good drinkability."
"It's hard to believe the Winter beers are here already! Pours deep chestnut brown. Thin tan head, very good retention and lacing. Smell is malty,and spicy. Body is light to medium with carbionation. Taste is warmed nicely. Sweet fruit and spice with a good balance of malt and hops."
"This brew pours a clear mahogany color. The head is massive, and recedes slowly into thick lacing that sticks to the sides of the glass the whole way down. The aroma is of malty with faint chocolate and ginger notes. The taste is like the like the aroma, but with a more pronounced spices. The mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice beer that I would certainly buy again."
"D- It is pretty good. First real winter warmer. Is very decent though. Can't wait to try more."
"Pours a dark mahogony with a smallish tan foamy head. Very dark and hearty looking,great for winter. The smell is alittle light with roasted malt, vanilla, nuts, and coffee. The taste is chewy with nuts,coffee, roasted malt, alcohol, and dark fruit. A very hearty beer that hides the alcohol well and is a sipper. The m/f is medium and the flavors mix very well. This is a reason to look forward to winter. A damn good beer, good job Avery."
"Pours from the bottle to a dark brown, with hints of ruby redwith good carbonation, and a medium tan head that lingers and then reduces to good lacing. The nose is a mild aroma of malty dark fruit, and the taste is a nice mixture of this malty sweetness and hop bitterness. The 8% alcohol creeps into both the aroma and taste at mid-glass, and leads to a sweet, warming finish. This bottle depicts a winter scene, and thgis may be better as a winter warmer, but I was not disappointed having it on a warm, early Fall evening."
"Initial flow over the palette was an attack of fruit (apple and raisin) with a malty, hop finish. It took about three sip to actually adjust to the high amount of fruitiness. Half way through and now I get a a smooth dark, malty, chocolatiness that flows over my tongue with a sweet nice dry finish. It is becoming very drinkable and enjoyable the more I drink."
"This year-old Old Jubilation pours with a good amount of carbonation creating an off-white head that settles slowly to a collar of foam. The color is a sort of light to medium brown. The aroma is malty, with a touch of a nutty character. Very smooth mouthfeel. Starts with fruity, malty flavors; predominantly caramel malt flavors and some nuttiness. However, the roasted, coffee-like flavors detected in younger versions of this beer are quite muted. The finish is not nearly as bitter and the hops overall have diminished quite a bit and remain mostly in the background as compared to an early review. A very enjoyable old ale that holds up well to some aging."

"old scores 45/45/45/4/4"
"Drinkability: It's strong, for me the alcohol doesn't make this one non-sessionable, just the overloading taste. I really dig it and I have had it on draft and in the bottle several times. I recommend you try it even if you aren't a big fan of winter warmers."
"I'd love to try it fresher and see what the difference is. For a winter warmer with some time and shipping under it's belt it was a nice brew. I'd definitely buy a 6 pack if it was in my local market."
"An awesome beer to have in the Winter, or just about any time. Recommended."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Something else unfortunately common in the Avery beers I have tried is a is a strong sweet aftertaste which doesn't suit me well. The aftertaste is a reiteration of the aroma, sweet and heavy in alcohol which was well concealed by the taste itself. This probably won't put me off picking this up again, but it keeps me reserved in my praise."
"Nice smooth mouthfeel which leads to a mouth puckering back of the mouth tartness (a good thing) followed by a sublime malt sweetness that has hints of dark fruit and a dash of coffee thrown in. Avery has been hit or miss for me, but this one is superb. One of the best ales I've had in recent memory."
"Pours a mahogony with a tan head. Smell is hoppy with some sweet notes, very inviting. The taste is layered and good. It starts hoppy with a bitter bite, but not harsh. It is smooth with a sweet subtle chocolate finish, and a tiny hint of a burnt aftertaste. This beer has a great balance, and I question why it is a winter beer because I could enjoy these all year round. This beer has multiple personalities but treats them all very well. The 8% ABV is not even noticible, I would have never guessed. This is a well rounded beer with many positive attributes. Do yourself a favor and check this one out."
"Drinkability: 8% ABV? I don't see how it all. I may have to grab a case of this stuff next time it's released, which I imagine will be, well, you know when, and that's soon enough. Very delicious, not too heavy, and enough flavor and complexity to make it a delicious long sipper, so your bottles, if you choose to buy a few, will hopefully stay around for a while."
"Cheers!"
"Like their brews so much that I stopped at their brewery when I was in Colorado. Old Jubilation has a knock you down fast potent alcohol content. Definitively a sipper. Dark in color, full of complex favors. A party favorite with beer snobs. Look for Old Jubilation starting around Thanksgiving. Put some away for those cold February days."
"Dvery good, but a sipper for sure. I will buy this again for next winter."
"D - Drinkable. I really like this one, very tasty, nice brew from Avery."
"A good drinkable winter."
"Pours a dark chocolate with a pillowy head and great lacing. Smell is a nice blend of spices and distinct malt. Taste was composed of malt, smoke and some hop notes...nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and finishes dry. Very easy on the drinkability scale...refreshing dry finish."
"Full mouth that stays smoothe. One of the better Winter Warmers out there."
"Darkened brick. Roasty, malt accented aromas, with hints of hazelnut, raisin and caramel, along with a hint of black currant, which I believe is from the Bullion. Soft feel. Complex malt flavor, with hints of chocolate and coffee, raisins and plums and perhaps a bit of toffee. All about the malt, presented in a classy way. Ive always liked this beer from Avery."
"This beer drinks well. I can't wait to try a fresh version at the pub. I think ""my minds eye"" might be inflating the score on his one."
"This brew poured a reddish brown with a tan head that has dissapated quickly. Nose is malty and perfumed with dark fruits and some spice i cannot put my finger on. Taste is very malty, with a nice cherry chocolate hint, and a very mild dry hopping to finish. Mouthfeel is OK, but it is not as heavily bodied as I would have hoped for the style. Overall drinkability is good. The beer warms one up without a noticeable alcohol taste. Nice brew that I will put into the winter warmer rotation next fall!"
"pours a dark reddish brown with deep red highlights a light tan 2 finger head in a tulip glass. head is nice and tight with great retention and lacing. pretty beer. aroma is both hoppy and malty. sweet caramel over sweet bread and chocolate covered cherries. nice fruity aromas. first taste is a light peppery hop flavor with a mild bitterness that's quickly overcome with a malty and yeasty bready flavor. mostly dark fruit, grapes and a touch of anise. unfortunately there's a slight metallic taste. finish is dry and yeasty. mouthfeel is a touch light in body, but with good carbonation. swallow clunks too much. easy to drink as the alcohol seems to be well hidden, but the metallic flavors hinder a tad. overall, not a bad winter selection and a nice try, but not one of my favs."
"Very enjoyable...one for the malt-fans. Glad we finally got Avery stuff here in Albany. I've got The Czar and The Reverand yet to try in my basement...should be good."
"Overall: Very nice winter warmer. Not cloying or overly-spiced and with a few new twists. A new favorite in the style."
"Maybe it's just me. Maybe I just don't like Winter Warmers all that much. Old Jubilation is above-average but still not too thrilling."
"It's pretty easy to drink, but also easy to forget. Another one of these omni-style ""winter warmers"" that strives for mediocrity - and achieves it."
"From the wintery label reminiscent of a Currier and Ives lithograph; to the deep, multi-faceted maltiness; to the warming sensation currently residing in my belly, Old Jubilation is a fine ale that was a pleasure to consume. Avery has brewed another winner that, thanks to its cellarability, can be enjoyed all year round. Well done."
"Drinkability:This is a nice Winter brew. Goes down easily but you might want to watch yourself at 8%"
"Pours a red shade of brown with a decent head but poor lacing. Smell of caramel and raisin with a hint of floral. The taste is really raisin like to me, seem there is some nice dark malt flavors with sweetness and a little spice. Nice full mouth and a easy drinker at 8%. Would turn it down, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Pours a beautiful shade of mahogany or dark stained cherry wood. Looks like expensive furniture stain. Head dissapates quickly, but does leave a nice lacing on the glass. As far as I can tell, the aroma does not offer a great amount... a hint of hops, and some dryness, but fairly subdued. The flavor on the otherhand is a veritible explosion of goodness. the best way to describe this I think is a heavily roasted, slightly spiced porter. The roasted malt flavor is phenomenal, and finishes out the palate without being overly dry. A very light amount of spice can be detected, but very mild, coriander, and perhaps cardamom. Finishes dry, with a slight bite that lingers for a few minutes. One of Avery's better 12 oz. beers I think, and it does quite a nice job of hiding it's 8% alcohol too."
"The taste is richer, with strong malt presence (bready, yeasty, and fruity), some chocolate hints, a certain woody-ness and a stronger hops finish (floral). A very nice winter warmer. Maybe my favorite this season. Mouthfeel is solid, and is very drinkable. Good stuff. Worth seeking out imo."
"Still looks great, but the aroma and flavor components are just a bit diminished in the bottle. Still, a nice beer. I'll be looking for some when it comes out next winter."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a nice body and the perfect amount of carbonation. Almost taste as if it was cask pulled. Wonderful drinkability. Good thing I have five more beers and lots more time."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" tan head over the clear reddish brown brew. Head lasts very well, with sticky lacing. Aroma is ample grains, little else, maybe the lightest of spicing. Taste is hearty maltiness, with light fruitiness and alcohol present as well, with the aftertaste a bit boozy. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both pleasing. One of the better winter warmers I've had."
"This beer was alright, but nothing I will probably buy again. Not to say its a bad beer, but this beer had no qualities that make it special."
"Not bad, but there are better/more interesting winter warmers out there. Still, this one is worth a try. Recommended."
"Deep Ruby-brown color with a thick, creamy, tan headintricate lace: this is a nice-looking brew. The aroma has a lot going on: toasted malts, spice, fresh-cut wood, dark chocolate, and just a little ethanol. The taste is enjoyable, with a very dry wood-like charter. At times it seems a little astringent. The alcohol is hidden fairly well. Chocolate and roasted malts form the under-belly of the beer. Finished dry, with a lingering hop bitterness. Well crafted, and very enjoyable."
"This is as much a niche beer as Hop Wallop, Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner, Duvel, or anu other category leader--with the caveat that it doesn't compel me to have another one."
"This beer is tasty enough, but it's hard to say anything more of it than ""Yep, it's thick"" and ""Yep, it has a high ABV"". That being said, it's a very appropriate beer for a blustery January night in Nebraska."
"Drinkability- Pretty good winter warmer. Worked on an actual cool day in the Arizona valley."
"Flavor of brown sugar and malt. Enough bitterness to keep it drinkable. Rich, smooth, nice. Medium to full body, thick and sticky on the tongue. Hop bitterness finishes it but the malt never really goes away, hanging on the back of the tongue. One of the best winter beers I've had this year and one of the most suited for a cold evening."
"Fruity and richly malty. Plum and caramel. some decent hops in the finish. Sticky with hints of the alcohol. Not overly complex but a good winter warmer."
"Flavor is quite decent for the style. The aromas of fruits follow though, somewhat sweet, but with an astringency from a hop finish. Alcohol burn is a little stronger than I like, telling me that they haven't hidden it as well as I think they should. Mouthfeel is pleasantly full, and drinkability is decent, although I wouldn't want a lot of this style at all."
"Jen: Yummy! Just what I look for in a winter ale. This has a nice blend of malts with a dry coffee and toffee and a mild bittersweet chocolate taste. It has a nice medium mouthfeel with slightly hoppy, yet sweet and toasty aftertaste. This is worth the $$, and it will be purchased again."
"Drinkability: If the maltyness to hoppyness had a bit more balance I would say this was a very easy to drink treat. This beer is not bad and I will buy again."
"Color is brown, high in clarity with not much foam. Smell is roasty, of sweet malts, chocolate, and raisins. Taste is very sweet. Toasty, nutty chocolate flavors are present initially, the finish is unremarkable, however, lacking the bitterness to even things out. It has a nice medium body but felt a little flat. Overall a good malt flavor here, but not enough balance and low carbonation keep this brew only slightly above average."
"Music: ""My World"" by Illogic"
"drinkability: pretty drinkable, but a full flavored beer"
"Notes: Ok, enough said."
"D - Very good drinkability. Nice complex winter seasonal."
"Spice free does not mean 'without flavor' and our friends at Avery have proved that again. Many thanks to my main man Kenny @ Holingsheads Deli for flinging this bottle of Old Jubilation my way!"
"Tastes of deep malts, yet the dominant theme is the spices. Almost a little too aggressive, has a kind of disturbing end, but I'm still ok with it. Kind of reminds me of a barley wine, somehow. Body is thick, and somewhat too agressive of an alcohol tingle."
"D-I would have liked this to come on a little stronger in the malt field to come across as a huge, full-bodied, winter brew, but was a little overdone by the spices and hops. Probably great after sitting a year."
"D - I drank it all night long. It didnt bother me a bit. Loved it."
"This is my first Avey brew and I am not dissapointed."
"This is a pretty decent brew. Has almost porter-like texture. Very malty upfront but unlike a lot of other porters I've had, very hoppy at the end. Interesting I'd say. Lots of roasted chocolate malts and bitter sweet tangy hops. Very quaffable. First Avery I've ever had and won't be the last."
"This beer has the color of slightly watered down soda with orange-brown hues and an overall medium brown color. The viscosity is higher than expected as it is poured with a nice thick head that keeps and leaves behind nice lacing. Aromas of ginger root, roasted suger, alcohol, and other spices seem to come out. The taste is almost entirely sweet with hardly any hop characteristics. The alcohol is reasonably hidden, but it makes its presence known a few sips in. The varying 'sweet' flavors blend together very nicely so as not to compete with one another. Although this beer is sweet, it is not too sweet to enjoy. An excellent beer with the typical warming alcohol sensation resulting. The drinkability takes a hit because of the high ABV and the richness of the beer."
"Drinkability: Fairly decent. The metallic aroma detracts from the overall experience. Still, in a sea of sometimes bland winter warmers, this keeps the palate interested. Recommended."
"Overall an enjoyable winter warmer. Another fine Avery offer. May be lacking in the mouthfeel dept., but I'd recommend it."
"Drinkability is decent, overall a pretty solid offering from avery."
"The 8% abv is well hidden in this one.. quite a drinkable brew, although not one of my favorites."
"The color is dark brown with a ruby glow. The light brown head is large, thick, and creamy. Retention is very good. The aroma is that of rich, dark malts. Flavors of sweet chocolate stand out with notes of coffee. The taste is fantastic, many different flavors come together to create an excellent winter warmer. Rich, sweet malts stand out at first. Sweet chocolate tastes are most notable, with a touch of dark, bitter chocolate in the mix. A mild roastiness compliments the dominating flavors nicely, and a burst of dark fruit flavor towards the middle of a sip is a great touch. Hop bitterness is notable along with a mild dry hop flavor towards the finish. A trace of alcohol flavor rounds out a sip. I haven't had very many winter warmers, but, to date, this has to be my favorite. Highly recommended."
"There are just too many elements awry here that I can't praise this...brash, boozy, and weirdly metallic."
"(Swigged at McMenamin's in Philly's Mt. Airy section.)"
"Drinkability: I could drink this one all night, after a cold day of being outside all day, it really hits the spot."
"Overall, Old Jubilation is a great biggish beer. All of these beers have done a great job of hiding their higher-than-average ABV; on second thought, perhaps it's the rapid consumption of several beers high in alcohol that's disguising the booze."
"Good start  deep caramel (root beer) pour with a sticky tan head. And those fall spice malts in the aroma were enticing. The quaff had a sugar cane sweet start, and finished with a proper hop kick. But the alcohol was very noticeable, and it came with a cherry medicine after burner. Just too tad too hot for a good drinker brew."
" 8/29/06 Edit: Tastes much smoother, the various flavors have blended together. The hops are much milder, and the mouthfeel has thinned slightly, which is a good thing. Very drinkable, but drink now if you still have the 05. My new scores reflect this tasting."
"Definately a beer to grab if you can find it."
"I've enjoyed every Avery product so far, and was in the mood for a seasonal, so I picked up a 6 of this. Pours a deep nutty brown color with a hint of red. The head bubbled to two fingers, decent for a slow pour, a foamy tan that laced well. Smell was nutty and malty-sweet, with some cocoa and plum. Taste was excellent, deep and rich, with hazlenut, cocoa, dark fruit and black tea, with a just-right hoppy finish. Not so thick as to be too filling, extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability: Oh, its drinkable alright! Especially for the 8% alcohol. Absolutely a joy to drink, even without the spices, bush berries, and twigs present in so many of these seasonal offerings. A hefty brew, and certainly a tasty one, I am pleased to have given this Avery offering a try and look forward to the remainder of the six-pack. Way to go, Avery!"
"Pours a brown/dark amber with a 1 finger head and good lace. Heavy malt aroma - chocolate, coffee and nutty. Good roasted malt taste mixed with coffee, chocolate and a hop as well as roasted bitterness. Slightly alcoholic and warming. Raisin and plum flavors noted. Higher than normal carbonation. A good complex brew but a bit harsh still. I think I will let the other 5 sit for a bit and try one again when it gets closer to Christmas - it should smooth out some."
"One of the latest effects of the change in the ABV limit law in Georgia in 2004 is the major increase in availability of good domestic micro brewed beers, one of which I poured in my oversized wine glass tonight. Avery Old Jubilation came is a longneck brown bottle with a wintry scene on the label. The poured beer looked clear, chestnut brown, with a tinge of red. The head was dark beige, and formed quite nicely to a one finger thick foamy consistency before fading away to a covering of bubbles. The aroma was accentuating the malts in a big way with a sweet, musty, roasty smell. The hops were there as well, but provided more of a floral background smell. The taste was much more of a balance between hops and malt, with a stronger than anticipated leafy bitterness reminiscent of tobacco juice. The malt was a mix of brown sugar, toffee, chocolate, nuts, peat smoke, and dates. The mouthfeel was silky smooth and rich with a sticky quality to it. The aftertaste was like a lingering peat flavored candy. The alcohol content was well hidden behind the subterfuge of all this complex layering, with no noticeable burn. A good seasonal offering from the Colorado brewery who can do big beer right most of the time, and this is one of those times."
"found this bottle in the single section. from the bottle. poured a mahogany with a off white head that left a small amount of lacing. aroma, caramel, apples, brown sugar, with just a hint of alcohol. flavor there is the hazelnuts, toffee, malts, chocolate, alcohol. this was a good beer."
"Taste: A nutty, husky malt flavor emerged upfront. Like the aroma, there wasn't much sweetness to it. The nuttiness lingered and mixed with some vanilla in the middle. The finish saw the rise of a cherry flavor that was medicinal and reminded me of cough syrup, especially late in the aftertaste. A light, spirit-like alcohol flavor was evident on the finish, but it wasn't overpowering."
"A careful pour yields a healthy white head atop the sea of deep, clear crimson. Aroma is full of malt and I kept getting hits of gingerbread. Taste is surprisingly and pleasingly balanced coming from Avery. Starts sweet and finishes with slight tartness. Mouthfeel is fairly full and slightly creamy. The carbonation is soft and the alcohol is barely noticable in the taste. Good drinkability for an 8% brew. I could enjoy a few of these without too much protest on a chilly winter night."
"Pours a transluscent cola color with a thick, frothy beige head that retains well, nice looking beer. The aroma is very hoppy (citrus and some pine resin), slightly spicy (nutmeg and allspice) and a light toasted bread scent. The flavor is initially quite hoppy like their IPA (citrus, floral and some pine) followed by a spiced character (nutmeg and allspice), some chocolate, toasted bread and some warming alcohol notes. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but smooth and the drinkability is pretty good. A very tasty winter warmer, definately a new school craft beer interpretation of a traditional english style but interesting and delicious all the same."
"Georgious dark and auburn colours, lasting head. Moderate spicey aroma. Intense taste, well carbonated. Well to drink with spicey food. Good malts throughout to balance out the flavour, and noticeable hops. Dry finish. Citrus and cherry and vegetable aftertaste."
"Pours a dark brown with hues of red, two fingers of a beige head that quickly subsides to a small cap,and some great lacing. Aroma was sweet molasses, caramel, plums, and other dark fruits with a nice dose of grapefruit hops coming through, an indication of what is to come. Taste has a nice sweet complexity upfront, with hints of figs, prunes, roasted malt, nuts, and toffee followed by a big dose of piney resinous hops and a slight alcohol taste on the finish. This is a lot more hopped than most Winter Warmers I've had, and in this case it really turns out well, since the balance is right on. Medium bodied and very drinkable for it's alcohol level. I'll have to pick one up in season to compare against this one."
"Tried this one before, I didn't remember it tasting so well. It has a full body evident in the toasty aroma and sweet body. Very malty and complex with dates, nuts, barley, caramel, toffee, and slight roastedness. The higher amounts of hop flavoring and sweet alcohol get your attention toward the finish. A little bready and tartness shows in the aftertaste although remaining quited sweet. This is a good beer."
"Opinion: I think that this is a very enjoyable beer, and I like to keep some around to sample throughout the year. It is one that keeps well, so that's why I am reviewing a winter seasonal near the first of August. This beer is big and bold with a whole bunch of flavor. It is very close to a British Stock Ale in flavor and strength, though with a bit much hops for both styles. It is a really tasty brew, and one that I will be getting as regularly as it is released."
"Head is brown, thick and strong as concrete, straw colored. Good nose with lots of C(itrussy)-hops that do their work fine as making this a very fresh and fruity brew, are there further orange peals used? Certainly tastes like it. Underneath this wall of citrus there is some maltarome mostly chocolate/roast and some caramellic notes. Impressive and wel dosed arome's with maybe litle overdone dryhopping but alltogether a wonderfull adchiefment. Tasting this is also something, roasted nuts in orangejuice with wodka is a way to discripe this warming, fresh & fruity and bitter barleybrew. Woww maybe litle to much for time and wheather( sunny and round 85-90 outside at 1:30 pm) but most welcome to my tasting buds! Maybe litle overdone( on roasty and alcoholic side) so drinking gets tougher but well done Avery!"
"Thin, light brown colored head looks dead. Deep mahogany colored beer with a ruby hue. My nose clogged up and all I can smell is a vinuous malty sweetness. I was thinking big malty sweet beer, and it is a bit sweet up front, but oh look out for them hops. The flavor kicks in midway through, and by the end you've got a big ball of chewy piney hops in your mouth. It's pretty bitter towards the end, but not overwhelmingly so. After a few sips my stomach is nice and warm. A tasty, interesting brew that redeemed itself after the pour."
"12 oz bottle with no date. Pours a gorgeous clear, dark mahogany with ruby overtones. Generous two-finger bubbly head that slowly fades, leaving sticky lace. Nose is sweet, sweet, with fruity tones (grape?) as well as malt and molasses. The nose definitely lets you know there will be hops in the tasting that follows. Taste is sweet, dark fruits and malt. Hops prominent, moreso than I usually expect in a winter warmer, but not overpowering. Alcohol is evident throughout. Velvety mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Certainly not a session beer, but for the style I find it drinkable."
"Nice brown-amber color but the head was virtually non-existent. The aroma was dominated by sweet caramel and molasses along with some slight piney hops - rather nice, though perhaps a bit subdued. The flavor was definitely spicy overall - a nice blending of the sweet complex malt flavors suggested by the aroma along with maybe a hint of a roasted character, overlaid with spicy hops that finished with a slightly harsh character. Overall, strikes me as more of an IPA than a winter warmer - but delightful anyway! thanks to my Secret Santa for this one."
"Great mouthfeel in here, good lively beer with a nice thick body. The alcohol seems just right here. Unlike most Avery beers that show much more alcohol than they really have this one packs the perfect punch for what a Winter Warmer should be. I was actually kind of hoping for some fusel alcohol's since its so damn cold up here in Michigan and I thought I'd get that with an Avery, but this one surprised me. Very good. Thanks Craig!"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours clear mahogany brown color- ruby if held to a bright winter sun, the head rose 2 fingers or more of good light tan foam, the lace a filmy sheet persisted and finally receeded to the edge in a ring. The floral-citrus aroma of the hops and sweet malt blend with a hint of alcohol. I reminesse of brandy like on tap brews tasted at Schlafly's 2005 Winter Beer Fest that I found thickly malted and tangy with great mouthfeel and returned to again and again. Jubilation finishes with a big acidic feeland the hop spiciness, dry and lingering goodbye."
"I can see why some might enjoy this, but for one who enjoys more malty & spiced winter warmers, this isn't my beer."
"This was a nice suprise. The big, bubbly head turns into a thick, whipped lacing. The color is dark red/brown and only allows a small bit of light to shine through. The nose is a sweet, malty sensation that lets the slightest breath of hops come through. The first taste reveals all sorts of flavors...chocolate, raisin, fig and apple come to mind. The ""Jubilation"" is evident as the alcohol makes itself known rather quickly. Definitely a sipper. The flavors become more pronounced as the beer warms. This is a great winter warmer!"
"Pours a dark brown yet clear color with a very modest, but dense light tan head. The aroma is of roasted malts, chocolate, and buttery diacetyl. At first the diacetyl was overwhelming, but after sitting for a bit, the smell improved. The taste is a very creamy smooth repeat of the aroma (although a better balance of the buttery flavor) along with a nice blend of hops taking a backseat to the malts. This smooth beer is a medium to heavy bodied beer that drinks down really well for the ABV. Very likeable beer! Thanks to pineywoodsrooter for this one! Cheers!"
"This beer is big. Alcohol warmth is there - but not burning. It pushes me just to endge - slightly harsh, but enough complex flavors to get me. I thought the 2003 version went just over that edge. This year, it does not. A fine version of an americanized style. My favorite Strong Ale of this season (so far)."
"Had this on tap at Rich O's Public House. Pours a medium brown color with a tall head and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has lots of citrus hops but also has a nice malty backbone. The flavor has a great caramel malt character, but is joined by the citrus hop flavors. More hoppy than expected, but very well balanced. Very enjoyable. Drinkability is great for an 8% brew."
"On-tap poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep brown-red color with two fingers of head. There is no lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and malty, with a touch of chocolate and some candied plums. The taste is fairly light. Nice and sweet with more dark fruit and just a hint of caramel as well. The mouthfeel was fairly nice and strong. The drinkability was unlike anything I've ever seen from Avery. This is an 8% beer, and it drinks like it's under 4%. I could easily have a few of these."
"Just brown, dark brown. Fluffy toasted froth. Holds well. Beautiful lace. Toasted whole wheat bread burnt on the edges, made with a touch of molasses, spread with homemade syrup; good hop funk steps through, and boogies on down the palate. Jazzy mouthfeel. Warming. Creamy. Mocha cappuccino made with Italian roast."
"Chosen from the list of ""beers for men"" at the FlatRock in Manyunk, how freakin' funny!"
"This beer poured a deep ruby brown color with a small head that didn't have much retention at all. Citrusy and spicey hops dominated the aroma, with a sweet caramel background in there as well. The flavor was much the same as the aroma, wtih sweet citrusy hop and nice spicey hop laying over a nice caramel backdrop. The feel was moderate to thick. Overall, I enjoyed this beer. IT was very smooth and I could easily have had a full 20 oz pint."
"Taste begins with the sweet toffe malt, along with raisins and spicy licorice. Nice. But this is an Avery beer, and the hops come on strong. Big, sappy, with a little scotch tape. Bitter enough to balance the rich malts. Full-bodied, and warming."
"A pretty good winter brew."
"12 oz. bottle, no freshness dating. Pours a clear deep mahogany color with a white foamy head. Good head retention, and nice lace on the sides of the glass. Caramel and nutty smells. Big toffee malt character, combined with some hop bitterness. Very well balanced. Alcohol is somewhat noticable. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Very nice winter warmer. Big, well-balanced."
"12 ouncer sampled, no freshness dating. Pours very dark almond, clear, dark tan head, tiny bubbles , frothy, well dispersed sticky lacing. Nose is malty, spicy, oats. Rich,creamy solid mouthfeel. Bold malty body, some winter spice picked up, nutmeg,cinimon,ginger. Tasty and warming with alcohol well in background. 2 or 3 of these and I'll be seeing two old Saint Nicks! Fine winter warmer, seek and enjoy."
"Poured a deep brown color with splotches of red hue around the corner of the pint glass. There was some bubbly head that slicked over the top, but nothing lasting. The smell was sweet caramel and toffee flavored. The taste was minimal in the hops department, but had plenty of sweet coffee, toffee and chocolate flavors. Good crisp mouthfeel. This is a great beer to sip while sitting next to a roaring fire."
"Pours darker than expected, deep red/brown with a superbly thick and creamy head that lingers until the end with intricate lacing. Aroma is mild, too mild, but I pick up on dark roasted malts, cocoa, light caramels, ans very German-smelling hops. Flavor is dark and malty upfront with a decent amount of chocolate malts, and finishes with a blast of warming, spicy hops. Tastes better room temp, smells better too as it warms. Matlier than expected but balanced by a hefty dose of sprucey, piney hops. Medium mouthfeel and thickness. Nice, soft carbonation make it quaffible. Alcohol makes it's presence known at the end as it warms my belly. I like, I like!!!"
"Enjoy one or a few over the holidays."
"I would not buy another six pack, but then again, this is not my thing. If you like hoppy beers, I would definitely give this one a try."
"Drinkability: Very satisfying with good complexity; I note from Avery's website that they consider this an English Strong Ale rather than a Winter Warmer"
"The start was smooth with a mildly crisp finish. Alcohol was barely noticeable. The caramel seemed to ride the tongue the longest after swallowing. Since this is not overboard with strong flavors, I found this to be quite enjoyably drinkable - more than one can easily be quaffed."
"A fantastics example of the winter warmer style"
"Pint on tap at Bass Lake Draft House in Holly Springs, NC. Yee Haw! I don't know how this one got by the alcohol police in NC, but keep 'em coming..."
"Drinkability/notes: A excellent winter beer which seems to adhere to the Winter Warmer style quite well. Not to be missed."
"This beer came to me a rich mahogany red color that was crystal clear, and well carbonated. The head that was created was a light tan/beige color, creamy and bubbly in consistency, and it lasted fairly well considering it sat at the bar for a few moments before it made its way to me. The lace that was produced was fairly intricate and present all throughout the glass down to the last sip. The aromas that came forth were on the non-complex side, sweet malts, grains, dark fruits (raisons, prunes, plums), some earth notes as it warmed, hops and some alcohol notes. The flavors showed more complexity then the aromas, notes of chocolate malts (tad bitter), dark fruits (raisons, plums, prunes), which complimented the bitter chocolate, light hops (spice) tad on the alcohol and hops throughout. If finished on the slight bitter side (chocolate malts) with slight spice and on the dry side. Body was on the fuller side. Again one of those beers that become more complex as it warms. A good seasonal beer."
"Dark deep red almost brown with a tan head that falls quick to a ring of foam that leaves sheets of light lace. Sweet malt, fruit cake like, plums and candy. Taste sweet malt mingle with fruit. A lasting sweetness mingles with light spice and light grapefruity hops for a fine finish. Mouthfeel is big full nice tastey treat. Drinkability is good a solid feeling brew with no alcohol really present, but feels like a bigger beer then it is."
"Pours with a one-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving traces of lace. Clear amber color. Medium bodied. Nose is malty. Medium carbonation. Starts with a mix of malt and hops but as it warms more maltiness comes through. Different from other winter wamers - no spices, very warm finish. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Liquor Barn Lexington, KY."
"Very good strong autumn beer. Now that I've finished reviewing it, I have a plate of Borough Market farmhouse stilton that I think should go perfect with it. Mmmm."
"Fantastic winter warmer, one more reason I love this time of year."
"Paid less than $1.50 by purchasing a single in a six pack mix. What a deal! Pours fantastic, a great head and lacing that sat in the glass for a good while. Not sure about the 8% alcohol content - North Carolina still limits selling beer over 6% and I could not find out anything on this. Drinks great from start to finish. Would definitely go back and purchase this ""winter warmer"" again."
"This one pours a dark mahogany color with a good-sized tan head. The head retains for most of the beers life and leaves rings of lace around the glass that melt away. Sweet malts are in the air with this, dark fruits, caramel and molasses are the main contributors to this sweet aroma. There is also slight earthy hop notes appearing here and there as this one was put down. Taste mimics the aroma in most ways with the sweetness hitting you first and strongest with the same fruity and caramel malt flavors with an earthy hop tone keeping it from being overly sweet. As this one warms and you consume more subtle complexities start coming out with various spices and flavors coming forward. There is a slight bitterness to the finish and a pleasant lingering taste as well. Excellent mouthfeel here with every sip covering your mouth with a thick, rich and creamy taste. Drinkability is high as well as only trace signs of the high alcohol content can be found in this. Highly recommend for the strong ale lovers out there. Another surprisingly great brew from Avery, but at this point in not as much a surprise."
"Extraordinary complexity of flavors. This strong old ale begs for your friendship, and your time. Spend a pleasant evening with this ""ole fellar", and sip the night away with an American classic."
"Overall, a solid winter seasonal."
"Pours a very dark cherry color with a nice creamy head. The beer has very strong oak and fruit smells and flavors, that are very well balanced. Each sip finishes off with a nice bitter bite from the hops, but nothing too overpowering. The hops blend very well with the toasted malt, to form a caramel type flavor. This is a very good beer, too bad it is only available at winter."
"Thanks, CRJM for this one!"
"12oz Bottle No Date. Pours a clear dark amber with a thick head that is very foamy. Aroma is excellent with caramel, toffy, nuts and a slight sweetness. Slight metallic in the aroma as well.The body on this is also excellent. Very soft and full with low carbonation. Quite smooth and very drinkable. And the flavor does not dissapoint. Nice and sweet with a fantastic blend of malts with a chocolate note and a mild hoppiness in the background. Overall this is a fantastic brew."
"Pours a nice dark reddish brown color with a tiny tan head of lace that disappears after the first few quaffs. This beer smells of sweet malts and light choco with some fluttery hops in the end. The taste was somewhat thin. No real discernible spice addings, which I expected from the scenic winter label. Sweet bread like malts, medium somewhat chewy mouthfeel, sweet caramelized sugars, and light phenolic fruit. Tiniest hint at rum or brandy, but only behind the heavy sweetness. The hop blend seems to have wimped out in my bottle. I don't doubt the prescence, but there was no real oomph. Not quite what I think of when I hear American Strong / Ole Ale. Try a Stone AB, I think it holds more interest. Not bad, the 8% is cloaked well, but not one I'll be seeking out again."
"Not bad.. just a little wrapup of alcohol and a run of warmth down to the gut."
"A very good brew. Definitely one that could warm you up and be your friend during the cold winter nights."
"Drinkability is pretty good, could see myself downing another."
"Clear, dark amber in color -- almost red, actually. Head is a spotty, dirty white. Nice aroma -- molassess with a slight fruitiness and a floral hop bouquet. Rich in flavor -- brown sugar with a somewhat burnt malt taste. Unsweetened chocolate, raisins and other dark fruit. Finish is pleasantly bitter with a light smokiness to the aftertaste. Full bodied but well carbonated and balanced-seeming in terms of flavor. Good stuff, no less than what I'd expect from Avery!"
"Pours a deep crimson color with not much head to speak of,aroma is on the malty side oranjy with some hints of chocolate but a hint of leafy hop that lingers.Taste has a light soapy quality with nice complexity dry biscuit malt with fruity estures big hit of hops comes thru though in the finish.True to the style a nice balanced complex old ale a very unexpected find here in North Carolina with the alcohol laws the way they are."
"Drinkability - a little high in the abv, but a great beer and easily worth multiple orders in a paced out session."
"Drinkability  This has winter warmer written all over it. It harkens back to memories of log fires, Christmas trees, and frosty window panes. Youll want to sip this hearty ale for sure."
"Thanks goes to Gusler for the sample of Avery brews!"
"A well made beer that is sadly illegal in North Carolina. I'll have to make it myself."
"Poured picture perfect into my chimay glass with a 1/4 in head with tight bubbles and a wonderful hoppy/malty nose. The taste is so beautifully balanced with elegant hop flavors and a hearty malt backbone. It is sweet like a Mackesons stout and just as light and drinkable. Nice hints of roasted coffee/bittersweet chocolate. Good cold as it is when it warms. Got it at the stuffed sandwich in san Gabriel."
"This brew is murky brown with a small beige/tan head of foam. The aromas are very hoppy and malts all at the same time. This is what a strong/old ale is supposed to smell like....wonderful! The taste is malty and strong, but the alcohol is well integrated in this brew and the hops that hit hard on the finish round things out nicely. The mouthfeel is creamy and chewy and the drinkability is excellent as well. A great strong brew..."
"Pours a deep, translucent red with a light creamy head. At first, the nose is full of robust malt aroma, progressing towards a sweeter, more herbal nose with noticeable alcohol as it warms. A number of flavors jump out of a thick, warming body: sweet malt, allspice, honey, and molasses. The bitter, malty finish lingers on the palate for quite a while. A good winter warmer, with emphasis on the warm. For >6% alcohol, it still packs a punch."
"A nice deep garnet color, and it is quite clear when held up to the light. It has a nice fruity, lightly spiced and hoppy aroma. This beer has a nice hop contribution, for some reason I was not expecting this, but it is good. The taste has some fruity - cherry notes as well as some light subtle spice character (as I understand it this is all done without the use of any real spices). The finish is slightly astringent, and is accompanied by a light sweetness. There is a bitter hop finish as well, though not IPA like but it is quite pleasing."
"The small, off-white head is filmy, leaving tiny little spots. Dark, dark, clear mahogany liquid. Nose is nutty with toffee (almost like peanut butter in burnt toffee). Dark chocolate toffee is joined by bold hops in the front. A thick chocolate malty middle finishes hoppy bitter. Yum! Aftertaste is just a little metallic, but only when cold. This one needs to warm up to show itself off. This is a very good, aggressive Christmas beer. Kind of like a maltier version of the New World Porter. I could drink lots of this!"
"Deep reddish-brown color with a decent off-white head that leaves a good lacing in my glass, fruity and malty aromas. Smooth nutty and chocolate flavors, full bodied with mild carbonation, full creamy and smooth mouthfeel, finishes kind of dry, alcohol well hidden until it warms, a solid winter ale."
"This brew went down quite smoothly and in pretty short order. No one characteristic overwhelms any other, giving Old Jubilation a nice balance. Worth trying out if you see it."
"Drinkability: Not what I expected. The mouthfeel makes this fairly undrinkable for my tastes. I was really looking forward to this and may have built it up to much. The stickiness fades some as it warms."
"The Old Jubilation poured a dark reddish-brown with a medium head that quickly went down to a nice lacing and collar. It had a very appealing citrusy, malt smell. It had a big malt taste with some citrus tones that was nicely balanced with a slightly hoppy finish. Overall, a very nice, highly drinkable holiday brew."
"A deep mahogany brew rests in my glass, topped with a creamy, sticky head of cream-color. The nose suggests Christmastime spices, but the website suggests that they used no spices whatsoever in the brewing of this ale, apart from, of course, our friends the hops. A woody and nutty aroma with hop crispness is present moreso than the aforementioned, however. It's very crisp on the tongue as well, but also deep and malty in a warming way. A well-placed hop bite at the beginning, balanced in the middle by thick grain and caramel malt with a nutty and woody character. Leafy at the back, leading to a crisp finish. Subtly creamy mouthfeel. A fine beer, perfect for a winter night with a book or other form of quiet enjoyment."
"Overall Impression: Very tasty. Big brew that hides it’s alcohol well, and tames a generous dose of hops. The spice taste is so mild that it's hard to call a Christmas beer, but who cares? It's good! I'll be grabbing a few more for the cellar, if you see some, give it a try!"
"Pours out to a a dark amber in the glass with a very slight head. The aroma is somewhat fruity with some fresh malt thrown in. The taste is good, with a nice malty, slightly sweet mouthfeel giving way to a light, yet tasty hop dose on the finish. A very, very drinkable beer and one that masks the 8% ABV very well. This breweries offerings have been readily available in my area (Detroit) for awhile. I'll be exploring their other beers soon."
"A very well-rounded winter ale. Dark garnet red color and spicy aroma. Big malt, with faint pear essence and carbernet wine. Hops are well balanced against the malt, giving a beefy finish to the beer. The high abv is woven into the flavor and not at all prominent. Overall, a very ""traditional"" sort of strong ale, and a very nice seasonal offering."
"On to the good stuff, the taste! Wonderful, bold, and quite complex. Very balanced between hop, malt and yeasts. This is one smooth brew. Did I say great color? Well it's richly dark and mysterious. I'll be buying more of this stuff."
"This is a good beer that I will definitely try again."
"On the pour a transparent bruin with a majestic crown of creamy head that is a beauteous beige color and the lace an all encompassing sheet to obscure the glass. The hop floral aroma greets you first, followed by the fresh and slightly earthy malt sweetness; also a fine brandy like top also present in this magnificent nose, start is ambrosial, rich in malt, with the top middling to full in its feel. Finish is moderate in acidity, the hops forceful in their spicy presence, bittersweet aftertaste ends this great work of the brewers art, with each new beer I sample from this brewery, my admiration grows by leaps and bounds."
"I like this one. At first, it was alittle bit too hoppy for me, but then the hoppiness ""calmed"" down. The color was a deep amber with a nice frothy creamy head. The head lasted a little bit and then went down to a thick laceing. The smell was quite malty, mixed with a beefy and fruity body. The taste was similar to the smell, but more on the semi-fruity side. Mouthfeel was creamy/bubbly and balanced out pretty well. All in all a good offering from Avery. The first brew from them that I have had, and most likely not the last."
"Overall: Fantastic, very reminiscent of some English Strong Ales that I drank in the UK. I must return to the beer store where I found this offering standing on its own, and pick up a whole 6-Pack if I can. Avery has yet to disappoint me."
"This is one heck of a solid holiday beer, as I am getting tired of Holiday Ales with cinnamon and spice. This is an old school old ale. Nice strong maltiness toffeeish caramel tones. I love it. a nice warming brew for cold winter months. I'd recommend this to anybody."
"Alright for a winter seasonal. Lack of spices in the brewing process is alright. Not all winter seasonals have to be brewed with spices, which in this case makes the beer rather mellow. Could be because of an older sample or maybe that's just the nature of this brew. Definitely stands out from the Avery stable of beers."
"Pours a very dark amber color with a light tan head that fades into a nice amount of lace. The nose is quite lovely and is the highlight of the beer with aromas of dark fruits and rum-soaked raisins and just a bit of molasses. Fairly full-bodied with a nice delicate level of carbonation. Taste begins with notes of plums and raisins with a touch of brown sugar followed by some unsweetened chocolate. A roasted nuttiness has a brief showing before some drying alcohol finishes the taste. Overall, the 8% ABV is well hidden and this makes for a fine drink on a cold evening."
"I'm guessing this one is from last Christmas season, and at 8% abv and bottle conditioning if handled properly by the good folks at Vintage Cellar this beer should have survived. Bottle gives no dates or info about the brew. Appearance: Deep ruby brown colored body with nice sized tan head leaves perfect rings of lacing with close clusters of tiny patches clinging to the glass very nice. Aroma: Plum like over ripened sweetness with some deep piney hop character going down, a layer of bready yeast note all flows very well aromatically. Taste: Deep thickets of hop bitterness here a mild sweetness comes through with a bready yeast flavor a bit musty but suprisingly quaffable and interesting. Mouthfeel: Medium to full body mild carbonation goes down too easy at 8% abv. Drinkability: A bit complex to enjoy in session but a wonderful beer to sample and enjoy may track some more fresher bottles this coming winter."
"Dark Amber color. Large head. Aroma is malty and nutty. A medium bodied. Malts are nutty, dark fruits and molasses. Hops are spicy. Well balanced. Smooth taste. No hint of the 8% alcohol. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and dry. Nice.."
"Good dark brown color with a thin amount of head. The aroma is pleasant with some hoppy, maltly, and spicy notes but a little sour (bot too bad though). Rich in taste with a large amount of malts and spices floating around. It gets pretty bitter towards the end and finishes dry and tart. A good seasonal thats not over spiced, very well balanced."
"Rich red hints around the deep molasses body. Low carbonation provides a slight head, it dies with time, leaving little lace. Rich warm spiced flavors, a heavenly malt syrup that will certainly show up on my rain season table. Is this the answer to SAD? Who'd have guessed it comes from a place that has plenty of winter options that don't require an umbrella."
"Hats off to Gromit for getting us together!"
"Where did my beer go? Where is it? Oh, there it is... it's the same color as the bar -- mahogany, that is. Big bubbles form a billowing, rocky head that doesn't hang around terribly long but doesn't disappoint either. Smells like the outside of a not-quite-sealed bag of chocolate malt, some prunes, and some very light spices. Great taste! Very smooth and easy to drink. Malty sweetness with a tofee kick. I could see a latte lover enjoying this beer -- but tell mom not to get the ""grande"" size with this one. So drinkable despite it's abv. Very good beer."
"Crystal clear, mahogany in color with a quickly thinning dark-beige head (despite a vigorous pour) atop medium-sized bubbles and mild to moderate carbonation. Lacing is coincidentally, like frost on a window. Aroma is rich with plentiful, citrusy hops (Bullion); warm, bready, sweet malts; a hint of caramel, and faint nuts. There is a distinct ""lime"" character to the hops, and makes for an interesting aroma. Mouthfeel is moderately smooth and soft in finish with a medium-firm body. Taste starts with brisk, floral hops, fades into a firm, yet not overly sweet, earthy malt backbone, and is followed by a soft, toasty graininess. Raisins, dates and figs are minimal without any noteable vinous qualities. The finish is extremely smooth in mouthfeel, however there is a harsh flavor hop towards the end with some astringent roasted grains...the malts are beefy and linger while coating the tongue. Alcohol is hardly noticeable in taste, but creates a pleasant warming effect. Despite others comments that they taste spices, Avery's webpage states that this brew is not flavored with spices, and I don't taste them. This is a complex and rewarding brew, and certainly would benefit from cellaring (the hops are a little rough at this point). If it were a musical scale, it would be Dorian:)"
"Old Jubilation has a medium-full body (about as expected from an 8% offering) with a nice, tight, non-prickly carbonation falling somewhere between soft and crisp. The flavor is malt driven, but not Crystal maltsI taste mostly dry chocolate malts. In fact, its the dryish aspect of the darker malts that give this beer a good chunk of its earthy, dry, pipe-tobacco-like character. The finish is the samelingering, dry, roasted maltiness with a solid bitterness that doesnt taste particularly hoppy. I understand that this beer is single-hopped with Bullions, but I wouldnt know what a Bullion tasted like after having this beer alone, as the hops seem to mainly impart malt-balancing bitterness in the case of Old Jubilation. The sweetness is very appetizing, even as its juxtaposed against the dryness of the high-kilned malts and the hops, leaving a beautiful combination of brown sugar and roasted, sweetened nuts in my mouth. What a beautifully balanced, complex ale. I wish I had more of this one"
"Brilliantly clear crimson hue. Topped by a thin, spotty but well retained foam layer that leaves isolated pleomorphic foam aggregates. Sweet, maple syrup laced dark caramel sweetness is ensued by hints of buttery malt and faint dark caramel seemingly above 100 lovibond that provides a roasty edge. Pleasant, mild, dark figgy fruitiness couples with mellow spicy hops to round out the aroma. Brown sugar sweetness at first in flavor is immediately ensued by bready, lightly burnt malt notes and an mildly earthy hop flavor. Light buttery diacetyl emerges slowly and complements the rounded dark caramel. Subdued, dryish date like fruitiness appears late concomitantly with moderate, non descript hop bitterness. Unfortunately a bit shy in body, with an unexpectedly thinnish mouthfeel that falls short of supporting the malt profile. Finishes cleanly sweet, w/ notes of dark chocolate and brown sugar sprinkled crusty bread lingering on the palate. Old Jubilation is a delicious brew. The only noteable weak link in the chain is the weak mouthfeel, perhaps a result of excessive filtration. It is nonetheless an absolutely drinkable, tremendously quaffable brew. It's akin to a Goose Island Christmas Ale / Youngs Special London Ale hybrid, albeit filtered and/or heavily fined."
"Fluffy, cobwebby off-white head which leaves some lace on the glass. Aroma is mild floral and spicy hops with notes of chocolate. Deep copper-red, which is more brown than red. Full-bodied and moderately carbonated. Flavor is notes of chocolate, caramel, nuts, slight diacetyl, dark fruits, followed by spicy hops and slight warming alcohol (this is 8.0%? I'm surprised) Finish is roasted malt, paper, and light grain bitterness."
"This bold holiday seasonal presents a deep, reddish-mahogany body topped by a frothy light-tan head that holds well and leaves some interesting Brussels lace throughout the glass. The nose is somewhat limited but reveals a sweet grainy malt, some dark fruitiness (raisins, prune), and a touch of floral hoppiness. The body is full with an exceptionally fine carbonation that caresses the tongue before becoming nicely creamy. The flavor is quite rich with a chocolatey note that's entwined with threads of soft dark fruit (raisins, plum, red grape) and balanced by an understated bitterness. The long finish lingers with residual semi-sweet & lightly chocolatey malt, a drying touch of alcohol, some thin hop flavor, and a light bitterness. Very nicely done with alot of character and a very good drinkability despite it's full maltiness and strength."
"Aromas of citrus and caramel. This rolls into a tea-like caramel/toffee malty flavor that has citrus, spice (cinnamon?), and chocolate around the edges - very, very good. For some reason a hint of mint (due to the hops & spice, if any spice is actually used?) appears in the finish - not a bad thing, and sets the flavor of this one apart. The alcohol is very well controlled. Nicely done."
"Pours a nice deep garnet color with a decent lasting, frothy, dense, tan head. On the nose the aroma was of caramel malts, and slight floral hop aroma. On the palate the flavors consisted of caramel malt, slight roastiness, slight dark fruity flavors, nice sweetness, nuttiness, and brown sugar. The alcohol is not over done, and hardly detected, very drinkable seasonal winter brew"
"Found at Jungle Jim's in Fairfield, OH. Avery's brews have all been pretty good so far and this is no exception. This is a pretty good seasonal ale to boot. Pours a pretty amber color with a medium thin beige head. Spicey aroma of connamon and hops. The flavor was a mixture of malts, brown sugar, cinnamon etc and was surprisingly rich. Good stuff!"
"Copper, auburn color with a nice tan head that leaves good lace. A hoppy malty balanced aroma and taste. Piney and sprucey aromas from the hops (?) Hard to tell if this is spiced or not ... Full bodied (leans medium) and creamy with a bitter finish."
"Happy Holidays!"
"A very nice old ale....great nose of raisens/dark fruits and some floral hops....reddish borwn with a nifty little tan lace that rims the glass....great maltiness on the buds...has a bit of a Barley Wine flavor to it...dark fruits and also some nutty characteristic...the floral hop finish is wonderfull....some alcohol is evident but it is 8 %...pretty easy drinking...very solid overall"
"I also recoginize a slight dry roasted character to this brew. And I upped the drinkability since I no longer notice the lingering off bitterness. Thank you to Davo for my second sampling of this brew."
"Dark ruby color with nutty malt nose.  Very malty upfront, almost cloying, with too much hop flavor.  Hops actually detract from the malt flavor."
"A very nice seasonal."
