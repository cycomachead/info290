"Oaky and nutty. Pours a dark brown. Really enjoyed this."

"Hm, it is strange they decided to change the name. Although it's same strong suffolk I love."
"Poured from a bottle named ""Greene King Strong Suffolk Dark Ale"" with a picture of a bull on the label. The beer is a dark, crystal clear, ruby coloring with no head. Pretty vibrant in the glass. Nose of very sweet, rich toffee, tangy caramel, sugary sweetness, fig, date, and hints of roast. Very sweet throughout. Flavors of plum, date, dark cherry, and roasted toffee, all on a bready and sugary backbone. Very slick, oily, robust bodied, with an old world fruit rich and sweet aftertaste. Rich, dark sweet linger on a slick, smooth finish. Big beer."
"Poured from a half liter while sitting in my house London.  Still working my way through so many English brews I haven't tried before moving here.  Mostly interested in seeing how this compared to Old Peculiar.  Brown...not much else to say...not much head or staying power, but could be the glass wasn't cleaned properly.  Nose...light malt with that old ale stale hop smell.  I find it odd that I'm starting to like that a little bit after smelling it in so many beers here.  Overall flavor and mouthfeel seemed to style based on the other English old ales I've had here.  Enjoyable, but probably not everyone's bag.  Pretty good beer.  I really need to do a side-by-side with Old Peculiar and will update this review if I get around to that."

"So I feel a little unfair at reviewing this ale as it's not really my bag. Pours to a very dark red almost brown colour with a head which quickly disappears making this ale appear flat. Smells like Christmas cake with spices, malt and treacle coming through. Tastes lighter than its appearance would suggest and lingers long after swallowing. There will be people who love this beer but I'm not one of them but that's down to my taste rather than the ale"

"Dark brown color , good beige head. Aroma of fruits , malt , wood . Taste is malty , fruity with notes of oak and chocolate, hint of sourness. Light bitterness in finish. Very good beer"
""
"The smokey, vinous quality is welcome, though the malt presence is disappointingly subdued. Nevertheless, visually appealing with a terrific aroma and ultimately quite enjoyable."

"Started very well with a lot of sweetness & various fruits & held up well right until then end when it started to fade ever so slightly. Not a bad beer at all but it falls short of being a great one."

"The only beer I've ever had that i would rate a 5 all around. Appearance is a rich dark red almost brown. Small head. Flavor is instantly fruitcake, then smoky and finished off by anise. Velvety texture, which only enhances. It is amazing. Even if you only try this once it is absolutely worth it."

"Overall: It’s interesting to go directly from The Bruery’s Coton to Olde Suffollk. Both beers are great examples of the style, but on completely opposite ends of the spectrum for alcohol by volume. Both have been aged to perfection. Both have a minimal contribution from hops. Both have rich dark cherry and brown sugar flavors, but one clocks in at 14.5% and the other is 6.0%. It’s enlightening to see that these Old Ale flavors can develop, regardless of the alcohol. I guess you could call Olde Suffolk a “sessionalbe” Old Ale (4.25/5)."
"Easily drinkable and smooth."

"I love the distant sour notes of the 5X and the way it balances with the fruity sweet maltiness of the rest of the blend. There are far too few brews that are so well bended as this one."

"Overall: a good, reasonably heavy English ale. It does seem like a stronger English mild ale, which is a nice change. I would have expected some more complexity however - as it is, it is more like a slightly richer Newcastle Brown, which is much cheaper. So, a nice beer, but nowhere near worth the price of AU$100 a case of 12 x 500mL."
""
""
"O- a really good English strong ale."
""
"O: Sad to say, disappointed overall. Has potential, especially with regards to the scent and flavor, but came off a bit weak. I was hoping for some more complexity, depth and assertiveness. I believe I'll pass in the future."

"Presentation: Packaged in a custom embossed pint bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a Samuel Adam Boston Lager sensory glass."
"Atmosphere is really nice. Not just a whole lot to look at, but a fair head with substantial effervescence; however no real lacing. Nose is really nutty with some sweet and herbal components. Complex flavor consisting of roasted malt, accentuated with bitter, sweet, herb, and nut components. Bitter and sweet with a high alcohol feel, but not overwhelmingly so. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""

"Aged 3.5 years in the cellar."
"A very traditional beer. Not to be confused with a barleywine or modern-day booze bomb. No roasty bitterness and very little in the way of hops. Just lots of rich, chewy malty goodness."

"overall, this is a beautiful drink. and at 6% it's relatively promising. i love the sweetness- it's like a dopplebock but has an entirely different set of parameters. i have a suspiciousness against myself for wanting to award another set of strong 5's in two beers in a row. and after much consideration, i have to admit this is an outstanding brew and i have no 2nd thoughts in rating this very highly. let me know what you think. i recommend this completely and will purchase a few more tomorrow to affirm what i feel now!"
""
""
""
"I like this one. Something keeps me from loving it. I think it's the aging--just wonder what the original brew is like."
"Overall, a really nice beer if not exactly Earth-shattering. I enjoy the added depth from the blending of wood-aged beer but it is just missing a little something. It is still nicer than your typical English ale and I appreciate that it is not skunked despite the clear bottle."
""
""
"Food match: Christmas fare; roast turkey, honey glazed ham, sides of roast potato, onion, squash, carrot, peas and a heavy gravy - all are viable options."
""
"D - Not my style for a session, but a pretty good example of an old ale, literally made from an older ale and a newer ale, just like in the old days. Fun."
""
""
""
""
"All in all, a solid beer. Not a great one. Interesting - when drunk slowly, no great change from intial serving temp to nearly room temp."
""
"Overall, very complex, nicely developed malt flavors accompanied by beautiful esters. It's very balanced, yet intriguing."
""
""
""

"O - Quite a decent old ale, one that I could revisit and could recommend without reservation."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear caramel brown with a tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and toffee aromas. Taste is very much the same along with some dark fruit flavors. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some very rich aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brown color with a white head. The scent is a normal fruity scent not too overwhelming. The taste is a bit like Boddingtons. If you haven't had that then it is like a brown with some sweetness to it. This is a smooth session beer that would be good in a pub. I would recommend this if you have a chance to try it."
""
""

"Not a bad old ale, though the flavors seem a bit dull. The aroma opens quite nicely and the flavor begins impressively, but quickly fades to a dull, thin, and somewhat vapid finish. I would love to taste this one in its native country, but I'm not terribly impressed with the condition I find it in here."
"This was a real quality ale to drink. Very drinkable with good depth and aromas. The flavors are lacking slightly, but what is there is very good"
"Couldn't resist tryin' this one. It pours a very dark ruby-brown topped by a short finger of ashen foam. The nose comprises flaky biscuit, light toffee, light honey, light vague dark fruits, and a touch of toasted wood. The taste holds notes of dark greens, graham crackers, light cardboard, light tobacco, tea, sweetgrass, and a vague sense of cedar. The body is a stolid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a creamy feel. Overall, a nice brew, one that's clearly benefited from the oak-aging."

"Notes: Reminds me of Yorkshire Stingo a little. This is a tasty malty sipper."
"O – I enjoy this example much more than my last review; perhaps the previous one was not well-kept. This time it is complex and very enjoyable."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a aged beer to for a while but a bit over-priced when there are better less-expensive choices out there."

"I ended up rating this beer 4.0 across all categories. I stopped and reconsidered each but in the end decided that they were all indeed ""fours," that is, all very good but not quite exceptional. I really enjoyed this beer and will try it again when in the mood for this flavor profile at a relatively lower abv."
"I don't remember what I paid for it, so it very well could have been worth it! A nice take on the traditional english session brown. Wish there was more barrel and/or alcohol, personally, but for what it is, it was above average. Part of this beer was aged in oak for 2 years. Where is it?"
"Conclusion: I continued to sip this beer after I finished the above review and waited till the last sips were left before writing this. Despite the odd flavors of this ale, and the way it isn't quite like anything I have tasted in an old ale or otherwise (the closest was a 3 year old Cooper's Vintage Ale), I sipped it greedily till the bottle was fully drained into my glass and my glass was almost empty. From this, I conclude that this is a tasty ale that should be regarded with respect considering its unusual aspects. If you have the chance, try it."
"I want more! Really really addictive!"
"Pours ruby brown in color with a creamy, vanilla head. I read that this has been aged in oak vats. Never had an old ale before, very excited for this beer. This one is a blend of stock ale that's been aged for 2 years along with a fresh batch. Aroma of dried fruit, oak, wet hay, tannins, and a hint of alcohol is very complex, yet pleasant. After a few sips, the dominant caramel sweetness gives way to a more roasted toffee like character. For a supposed heavy-bodied beer, the finish is somewhat dry, probably from the higher than expected carbonation level. If I had a library adorned with leather & rich mahogany, I'd probably dabble with this style more often (in a snifter of course). Unexpectedly delicious. Would be curious to see how this would play out a year from now."
"D- a real treat even though it's probably past its prime. i love old woodsy things, things that feel antique. not like decorations and shit, i mean like old ales and kellerbier. this one from greene king definitely satisfies."
"Overall a pleasant example of the style."
"O- I think this could have been a very good beer, but it just wasn't all the way there. Fairly bland. Still Euro metallic tasting. Good but nothing more."
"Overall- Could drink many of these back to back. Very rich, smooth, creamy, and has attributes of a Guinness and English Ales. Perfect! Will be keeping my out for more of these!"
"O: I'd like to try this beer again to see if the bitterness is intentional. Overall I think it has a solid base but it could definitely be improved in a number of ways."
"Nothing remarkable about the beer ... nothing to cause me to purchase again. Cool bottle though!"
"Number of brewery formerly of England raised their beer in the woods. A blend of young and more mature beer for a better balance. Old beer aged in oak for 2 years."
"Flavour - an echo of the chocolate, figs, and oak of the aroma, with a lasting smooth, fruity finish like really dark chocolate, with a hint of sourness and a gentle mineralty on the finish."
"Flavor of light caramelized toffee and a bit of dark toast. Rather light bodied for the style though not unexpected for a beer of 6.0%, and with a slightly watery flash of caramel and chocolate on the finish. Malt flavors are reasonably well balanced given the light body. Finishes with a bit of cinnamon and chocolate spice. An intriguing beverage."
"Went real nice with aged extra sharp cheddar cheese."
"D- Goes down incredibly smooth. All the flavor of a beer twice its gravity. So quaffable- unlike any other Old Ale I have had."
"drinkability - this is a good beer that I am glad I tried. i'm not that well versed in the Old Ale style, but what I've sampled so far, I am a fan of, with this being my second foray."
"I suggest letting this one sit a few minutes after the pour because it opens like a wine, gradually becoming fruitier, it's full range of flavor evolving. A regular in my fridge. Highly recommend."
"D: Given the low alcohol content, the beer is quite drinkable and goes down smoothly."
"Not a bad beer, but I've certainly had better examples. The carbonation is off, there's not much nuance or complexity, and overall it tastes like a weak knock-off old ale."
"Is pours a brilliant deep red with a small but lasting head that developes a gentle lace down the glass as the volume receedes. The aroma ad flaovor are caramel/ toffee and just a touch of tropical fruits and just enough bitterness to dry the tongue. The mouthfeel is light but with that annoying thud. I'm under the ipression that Greene King doesn't care for their beer very well and by the time it reaches out here on the west coast it's drinkability has greatly suffered."
"D - not much drinkable, however must be great with some cheese"
"Lastly - Greene King, please, please, please, please bottle old 5x and send me a bottle !!!"
"Overall: I met someone that went to England and swore up and down about the quality of this beer. With that in mind, I picked it up to try. It has nice flavor and a bit of complexity, and it blends the alcohol very nicely. However, its light and watery mouthfeel distracts true enjoyment. It could use more body. This is not a bad beer, but it is not an excellent beer."
"The foam was dark wheat in color, bubbly and smooth with nice lacing. It had a almost opaque color with a ruby red tone with burgandy and brown highlights. It had a very deep roasted barley and fruit aroma underlined by hints cherries, carmel and toasted wood. It's taste was a very deep toasted oak, barley, fruit, with a carmel toffee hops accent. Mouthfeel - full-bodied. Drinkability - I loved this beer! Deep, rich, full of complex flavors and aromas. This would be a perfect holiday beer during the winter."
"Drinkability: Quite high, the flavor is really quite nice in that it embodies the roasted 	malt and wood notes of an oak aged ale, while simultaneously maintaining a lighter, fruitier side. I need to pick up a few more of these."
"the flavor profiles are perfect for the mouthfeel and this old ale reminds me why I love old ales so much. a bit lighter and smoother than most of the american iterations, this one hits a home run again and again and leaves me wanting another one."
"Nice clear, deep ruby-brown pour with quickly fading head and decent lacing. Nice malty, complex nose with hints of vanilla, oak, burnt toffee, tea, tobacco, bread and dark fruits. Taste is much the same, with the vanilla, burnt toffee and oak becoming more prominent as it warms. Also get a very pleasant, subdued spiciness with just a touch of bitterness that nicely compliments the caramel sweetness. This is an incredibly smooth and drinkable beer. I was slightly disappointed that the oak aging didn't come through more in the taste, but overall this is a great beer that I will be visiting again very soon!"
"500 ml bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a brown/ruby red color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both nice. The brew smells like toffee, raisins, bready malt and caramel, but also some skunk (I'm sure the clear bottle didn't help). Luckily the taste isn't skunky at all. It's a good malty beer, it tastes like caramel and bready malt, toffee, nuts, and some oak. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with low carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. I think this is a decent enough brew, it's worth trying."
"Bottled version. Pours out a deep amber. Frothy head fades quickly. Low carbonation. Aroma of sweet nuts. Very smooth and malty drinking brew with flavors of roasted nuts, raisins, slight licorice. Very well balanced. Nice nutty finish. Another sturdy English brew!"
"Mouthfeel is very smooth. Moderate carbonation. The flavors cascade through the mouth and envelope the taste buds in a warm embrace. I find this beer to be very drinkable. Excellent contemplative brew that is very nuanced and complex. I will be savoring more of these in the future."
"This is a very tasty beer that is very complex and not to high in alcohol. The metallic aftertaste is something I've noticed before in English beer but it does disappear warmed up which also releases more of the complex flavors. Definitely a good buy."
"D: High. Very mild and smooth Beer. A winner, no doubt!"
"D: Rich flavor makes the beer delicious but not super drinkable. This is a sipper beer not a ""guzzler"" beer"
"Drinkability: The only bad thing i can say about this is: that it's only brewed in limited qualities. My expectations were shattered with this English ale and can't wait to get my hands on another one. The label said that it is a perfect accompaniment to ""mature English cheese", but I can tell you that a nice simple pizza, with spinach and cheese is not too shabby either. If you see this one on the shelf, grab it and enjoy....you'll thank me later."
"For anyone who likes to explore complex, malty beers, this one will captivate you. But you have to wonder what the 12 percent Strong Beer tasted like on its own. Boursin cheese and basil-stuffed chicken breast over Parmesan risotto is a very appealing pairing."
"Not bad. I bet it would be even better fresh and on tap. Still, worth a try if you like this brewery's output."
"kind of average english ale, lots of malt and light hops. good though."
"Pours a brilliant ruby color with a minimal fizzy head that leaves some lacing along the glass. The nose is sweet fruits, raisins and maltiness. Some aged oak and toffee are noted as well. The taste is smooth and delicious. Has sharp malts, raisins, and a slight alocholic bite that finishes off the quaff. Mouthfeel is crispy and drinkablity is pretty solid. I think this could survive another year or so in the cellar to settle down some of the bite, but overall a great beer."
"Hmmm, fix that very bitter aftertaste. Either the hops were used incorrectly, or the clear bottle has something to do with it. Otherwise, it is delightful ale."
"The lower ABV is a bit refreshing for the style, makes it easier to drink in the 500ml quantity. Still, it could have been rounded out with more malt, and honestly I'd do away with the label proudly advertising ""Caramel Color Added""."
"D- Smooth, fairly mild, and very agreeable with a low alchohol content for the style."
"Fantastically drinkable. This beer strikes a perfect balance between bold flavors and drinkability. The beer dork in me says I'm drinking a big, aged, sophisticated beer, and the responsible worker drone in me says I'm drinking a beer that won't kill me tomorrow if I have a couple. It's a damn shame it's not easier to find. If you have a store near you that carries it, I strongly recommend picking some up. I should add that I poured mine too cold and it warmed up as I drank, and I enjoyed it across the entire range. I recommend drinking colder than some of you normally drink an old ale, definitely no warmer than 55, in my opinion."
"D - A great sipper, this beer is the epitome of the English old ale, and at an affordable price."
"A truly unexpected surprise! ~"
"A great sipping beer, with more complexity than many beers with 50% more alcohol. This grand Old Ale is a classic example that beer can be many things - in this case a drink that can be appreciated in a slowly sipped pint, or in a brandy snifter with some vintage cheese. A lovely beer whose complexity belies its strength."
"Olde Suffolk poured a very dark amber/brown color with almost no head, but showed decent lacing. The smell was full of brown sugar, hints of milk chocolate. The taste was like raspberries and milk chocolate together, very nice flavor. Mouthfeel was good, and for the style the drinkability was good as well. Overall this beer was very nice. Old ales tent to be hit or miss for me but this was one that I enjoyed. I would buy this again."
"I am impressed and will try it again."
"A richer body would do wonders for this beer, at times it seems water, especially considering the robust flavours."
"Taste is smooth and malty with a bit of oaky wood and even a touch of sherry sweetness. Chalky minerals find their way into the flavor, as do some of the darker fruits. Has most of the pretty typical flavors found in an English ale, but what is so surprising about Olde Suffolk is the incredible smoothness of the beer. It just goes down soooo easy, tasty stuff."
"D: 'Only' 6% makes this a remarkably easy drinker. Pleasant flavors and a seductive aroma definitely earn this a spot of my 'must repeat' list. Recommended; I'd love to try this on cask."
"D: Well done. This beer has a fairly complex and sophisticated flavor profile that ends up going down easy, although I prefer to savor it a bit slower than my average beer, since it's not every day I try a beer like this. Recommended unless you're exclusively a hop-head."
"Pours mahogany with a nice tan head. Nose has fruity malts, spicy yeast, toffee, oak, vanilla and caramel. Taste has bready malts, dark fruits, cloves and oak. Medium body has a clean carbonation. Not bad, could use either a bit more depth or a few years of age to develop."
"Overall: Great drinkability, very nice flavors. Sweet dark fruit, roasted malt, and oak flavors are all very well balanced. It is a little thinner than I would like and there is a small metallic flavor but other than that this is a GREAT beer! Wonderful character throughout."
"Sidenote: While I enjoy most English brews at cellar temperature or warmer (in the case of some Barleywines and Old Ales) this one was definitely better a few degrees cooler than cellar temperature (IMO). The complexities were actually a bit more apparent slightly cooler and the alcohol/vanilla oak notes were slightly more aggressive as the beer warms."
"With the good and rich flavor, along with refreshing crispness, this is a very drinkable and enjoying beer to consume."
"D: Very easy to drink and a nice balanced taste. I definitely could drink a couple of these during a night."
"The taste is definitely caramel, some slightly boozy aged vat bourbon notes coming through. There is plenty of old fashioned toffee and caramel and butterscotch flavors. There is a slight bite in the finish but the beer tastes a lot like a slightly boozy caramel, butterscotch, and uncarbonated mix of things. The beer is reasonably complex and there is some dextriny sweetness to the beer, but it is the boozy old fashioned toffee that pretty much defines the beer."
"Overall a decent brew. However this is best enjoyed when your full attention and senses can be given to this beer. I would consider this as great choice if your are only drinking this one beer in a sitting. Try other aged English Strong Ales and Old Ales before proclaiming this beer is at the top of its class."
"Would revisit this."
"D - Quite drinkable. It is a nice beer with an ABV that isn't too high. The beer could be a touch less cloying though."
"D- For the ABV, this is little bit of a slow sipper due to the richness. A rather boring take on the style. I was expecting a little more from a barrel aged old ale."
"Olde Suffolk's a pretty impressive Old Ale. The aging process in oak barrels had a positive impace that's appreciable in all respects. The flavor has a slight buttery taste that throws it just a little. It's doesn't have a huge negative impact, but does hold it back a little. That's the only small qualm I have with it. Impressive all around nonetheless. Definitely worth picking up."
"A nice brew - well balanced. Very smooth. It has an oaky character that doesn't overpower. It began at higher end of cellar temperature, yet subtle complexities (such as chocolate) arose as it progressed. Very drinkable. A nice ""treat"" from across the Pond."
"Poured from bottle at cellar temp producing a dark ruby color below a thick light head that clings to the glass for much of the session. There is a full malt and carmel nose that isn't at all overpowering but lends a good compliment to each taste that again is malt with sweet, carmel, toffee and later a hint of alcohol and slight bitterness. A dry finish and overall a very good ale with nice oak notes that balance the flavors and pairs well with a cheese plate."
"Overall, not quite what I was looking for. Thomas Hardy's is far superior for a strong english ale."
"This beer is astonishingly reserved. It makes no bid for your attention and yet you're all too happy to give it. It acts coy and indifferent yet everything about it - its scent, its colours - are magnetizing and entrancing. It is spellbinding. You become so fully immersed in its complexities that all deliberations become focused on this all too modest but deserving ale. ...only to have the bottle finish before you really feel you ever got to know it."
"D: Exceptionally drinkable. Good complexity in a great session beer. Interesting how it's made too...a blend of old (aged 2 years in oak tuns) and young beer."
"a decent ale indeed. this is so easy to drink that i loved reviewing it. a stronger english ale indeed. great flavors."
"Poured a super ruby red color with the entire glass being coated in tiny bubbles. The one finger width head stuck around for about a minute. The aroma is woody, sweet and of dark fruit. There was also a very pleasant apple scent. The oak flavor from the barrels is very noticeable. This was super malty and sweet with a nice roastiness to it. Not much hop bitterness here but thats alright, there is barely enough. The feel is a tad thing but not bad. This is a very drinkable EPAish old ale. Nothing super special like i was hoping, but solid."
"A pleasant, complex drinker. While it's very enjoyable, I'm left thinking it could be even better. I agree with the reviewer below me, this should be bottle-conditioned. There is the likely difference between this, and an exceptional Old Ale like Fullers Vintage. That said, it's still pretty damned good."
"Very drinkable, with a sense of refinement and depth of flavor that belie the low abv. Overall, a tasty beer that exudes class in the same way the smell of old leather does. It's a shame this one isn't bottle-conditioned, as that could really be the final leg needed to elevate this into a whole other realm."
"Very good brew."
"big mouth feel, strong malt flavors, whiskey, malt, a very tasty british ale"
"I shouldn't look at previous reviews as it may bias me, but I have to say I'm going to run against the grain on this one. It just didn't do it for me."
"D: The only thing that could make this better is if they brewed it with some chocolate malt. Really very nice."
"Much better than the Speckled Hen. Mahogany pour with nearly no head. Earthy, malty, oak aroma that is very sweet. Velvety mouthfeel. Smooth taste of caramel malt and some vanilla mellowness from the oak. Slight bitterness in the back. Nicely balanced."
"Poured a 16.9oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours an extremely muddy dark brown with just a slight light brown head that disappeared quickly and left no lacing at all. The aroma reminds me of toffee, caramel, vanilla and oak. The flavor has a big toffee component but there is also just a slight tart funk to it. Vanilla, and caramel are both there also. The mouthfeel is light with just a slight carbonation to it. This is a good beer and a style that I would like to delve into just a little more."
"Light sweetness with oak and toffee, that tastes more nutty than fruity like the smell. Some nice tannins in there that add to the flavor, but step down the mouthfeel. The carbonation is fine, the alcohol not to noticeable for an Old Ale. Overall it's very tasty and easily consumed. I would definetely enjoy this one again in the future."
"Overall Impressions: Not a great big fan. The raisins really chase me away from this beer. If you like that sort of thing then give it a try. Rating this beer higher than I enjoyed it for the complexity of the taste."
"Drinkability is fairly good, although it somehow tastes and feels stronger on the alcohol than one would expect for 4.5% ABV."
"i was really surprised by the flavor on this one, especially after tasting my friend´s disgusting greene king ipa (made by the same brewers). lots of dark fruits like plum, currant, and apple, with a big malty backbone that delivered notes of sweet, sugary caramel and butterscotch. the alcohol could´ve used a bit more oomph, however, but the 2 yr oak aging threw in a bit of a bite to the finish. i´d definately have this again, and probably will have another bottle on this trip."
"overall a nice old ale that improves as it warms."
"I debated for some time in the store if I should purchase a bottle of this or not. I'm glad that I decided to! Pours a dark red almost purple with a decent head and good lacing. I let the beer warm up in the glass for a bit, the aroma is very fragrant. Feels smooth going down and finishes even smoother. Very drinkable indeed, and the flavor is nothing short of spectacular. The blend of two ales must be the key with this one cause there is a fresh hoppy taste followed directly by a strong smooth burst. Almost finishes like a whiskey or a dry wine, I can't quite put my finger on it but it works well. This beer is a bit pricey for my liking but it worth every penny to enjoy once in a while."
"This beer pours a sheer brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of molasses, milk chocolate, and hints of wood. The taste is of caramel, nuts, and tannins. It is rather weak when compared to the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a watery texture. Overall, this is a nice beer that I could drink again."
"Weird review...I expected to like this quite a bit more but I have to say I was dissapointed... Just ok to me.."
"Let's set sail."
"Good interesting beer, I enjoyed this."
"The taste is similar, rich, complex, yet fairly subtle. There's a clear light bitterness up front and in the finish, more mellow in the middle. The palate is full and complex, and lively. It's easy to drink, complex, and very flavourful."
"This is a tasty brew from Greene King. I was just over in London recently and had one of their Abbot Ales and liked it, so I thought I'd try their old ale. Very tasty indeed! Nice dark brown body with a decent tannish head. Nice malty scent and flavor. It's right in between a bitter and a stout, with the notion of a brown not far off. Delicious from first to last sip!"
"D - Overall, I was quite impressed. A very good old ale."
"Nice and thick and so smooth. The carbonation level is spot on, and it leaves a nice coating around the mouth. Drinkability is also good. Goes down easy for being rather heavy."
"drinkability is great. this brew is in a class of its own. the sourness from the aroma does not show on the palate, and the clean finish is rare among brews with dark malt complexity. cheers!"
"D: This old ale is very drinkable. The alcohol is not overpowering at all, and it didn't weigh me down despite the richness of it all. Also, with such complexity, there is always something to be appreciated, much like the War Requiem."
"This is a serious, heavy sipper. Perhaps a bit more hop or yeast spice might make this brew even more interesting, but it's just fine as is."
"Not bad at all, worth a shot..."
"Overall - A luxurious and thick, chewy beer. Plenty of taste and mouthfeel. Finishing with a slightly sour and bitter malty blast. The alcohol is almost an afterthought, well hidden but present if searched for."
"Pours dark tea-like brown. Thin head leaving just a thin ring. Aroma is strong mail and caramel. Flavor has roasted malts, oak, caramel, along with some dark fruits. Good robust flavor has some hints of sherry flavors, I assume from the oak aged ale blended in. This is one of the beers we tend to keep on hand all the time."
"ruby reddish brown with a tan head that had pretty good retention and lace. nose is oaky, caramelly, and yes... fruitcakey. taste is the same with some roasty flavors, burnt toffee and a faint hop presence. lighter side of full bodied. nice and silky. i'd like another please."
"D = I will definitely have this again, and would not feel obliged to limit my intake to one."
"Drinkability: This brew is amazing, and I will be looking for another bottle asap"
"Purchased last year at the LCBO. Nothing spectacular, but a very drinkable beer, and less overpowering than some of the other old(er) ales I've had. Lots of caramel and toffee flavours all the way through, with a decently thick mouthfeel and bready aftertaste. Hints of wood in there as well, although very little of the vanilla flavour you usually get from oak (this was oak aged, right?)."
"D: I like and recommend as it commands attention when drinking. Each sip or gulp seems new and different to the mouth. This is like drinking an entire song instead of some drinks that have just a few notes to offer. I would like to send a night with a number of bottles of this, a good dinner and friends and family."
"Tastes of oak, caramel, tart, and a dry lingering finish. A great Old Ale, one I would not pass up."
"Drinkability: A complex and satsifying brew that works the diacetyl in to its advantage"
"Taste is tart at first, without being sour, the complex smells are a bit muted in the taste, but still the taste is full of different tastes, dark overripe apples, wet soil, wood, a spiciness which reminds me of Christmas. Alcohol is a little hot and there is a slight trace of oxidation in the beer."
"Very nice ruby/garnet color, smallish head, no lacing to speak of. Nose is of fruitcake, spice and caramel. Flavor can be described with burnt toffee, slight oak finish, and some raisin. Mouthfeel is slick, light-medium body. Carbonation on the light side but expected in the style. Drinkability is decent, might be the best beer I can readily purchase in HK so I'd better get used to it."
"An interesting beer, it is much better than I was expecting, but it is still a touch more simplistic than I could wish for. I wonder if this beer was heavily filtered before being bottled, it seems a little stripped of flavor and complexity. Somehow, despite all my gut-feeling hesitations about this beer, I am really enjoying it. I think that this is because there is still quite a breadth of flavor here (despite the guessed at filtration). Sure I think this could be a lot better and more complex, but there is something about it that make it work despite that the individual components don't quite cut it on their own."
"D: Drinkability is ok. There ares some gaps in this beer. Would have liked a more sweet malty character in both the nose and taste."
"This full flavored beer has a nice strong aroma and is quite easy to drink. However, it's a bit thin in the body and there's hardly any head or lace. Definitely worth a try. Grab a bottle if you can."
"This had a bit of promise, but it's boring, overall. Plus, the acidity is too high. Oh well."
"Notes: I would definitely pick this up again and would also put in some effort to seek this out. The character from the oak aged brew that is then blended work out very well. It has enough ""Livelyness"" to keep this old dog learning new tricks."
"Pours a dark brown color, nice carbonation, tiny little fizzy head, basically no sticky lacing at all. The nose is malty, slight touch of pears, and caramel/toffee. The taste pretty much follows the nose malty, and lots of caramel/toffee. Light/Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew at that, recommended."
"The smell is god awful, like bad wine, and the taste is horrible....""how does this beer have such good marks, its truly terrible BUT it just shows you how different some people can think... and brew. It first tastes bitter sweet then starts to sharpen as it warms,....its aftertaste tastes like wine when you breath out the nose, but alot of people like that bite to there brew...but not me really. i did a re-rate twice!, this beer is ...well, crap, i hate it , to damn tart and sour and ...geez, tastes like a beer that went bad!!! a wine beer if u will"""
"Overall: very well done old ale. Don't see enough of this style in the US. Complex without being messy, intense yet still balanced, this is a quality beer. I will definitely be buying more of this."
"Not what I was hoping...I probably will not purchase this beer again. It's drinkable, but then again so is water."
"Poured from the bottle to a dark brown with a ruby red tint. Aroma was a little faint, but what was there was a pleasant malty dark fruit, mostly grapes and cherries. Flavor was more of the dark fruit, and mouthfeel was carbonated and a bit tangy. As the beer warmed, the alcohol became a little more noticeable in both the aroma and flavor, which all led to a smooth, warming finish."
"Cheers."
"Tasty, solid brew. With some cheese and bread, this would make a great meal."
"Green King get a lot of stick from some of British real ale drinkers, but this is a fine beer and they should be applauded for producing it."
"I think I will have another."
"This style is a holdover from the days when beer was aged in wood for up to and over a year. Olde Suffolk is a prime, tasty example worthy of recommendation."
"Mouthfeel is very good, filling the mouth, but not too much so and a crisp finish. The beer is very drinkable. I will keep this one in mind when I was a solid old ale. Recommended."
"This poured rather flat, not much head to speak of, wonderful aroma,....fruity, and a hint of tea aroma as well.Taste is interesting, some tea flavor here, but just as aroma, some ghost-like fruits in the back ground, actually a very bold flavor, hard to describe, but pleasant, well balanced hop bitterness, with a nice touch of malt, but leaning towards the hops..mouthfeel is crisp and satisfying..drinkability is fine!..this is a well crafted beer, that I will certainly have again."
"Appeared a bronzy amber color with a soda pop colored head and nice bubbles dancing up the glass. Aromas of toffee, molasses and candy corn solidly fill the nose. The taste of butterscotch and caramel corn mixed with a mild sourness make for quite an exquisite flavor. Very delicious. The flavors just play on the tongue and it's very memorable. Medium bodied with nice carbonation and on the tad dry side. I can drink this then have another one. I picture myself reading a book by the fireplace just widdling the time away with a constant pints of this. Very tasty!"
"Drinkability: This is a very nice ale, easy to drink and fun to savor. Goes very well with tangy foods like pickles or olives."
"Deep red color with nary a head to be found. Smells of dark cherries, plums. Taste is slightly acidic with a big dark cherry flavor up front followed by a drying, slightly charred flavor. Somewhat tangy in nature. Mouthfeel is on the thinner side but doesn't detract from the enjoyment of this beer. A pretty interesting beer to say the least."
"Good body and easy to drink. Not an excellent old ale, but an all around decent one."
"Overall, the flavors and mouthfeel seem to be opposites one another, but combine to make for a very enjoyable and drinkable ale."
"Light to medium light in body, very good drinking at a slow to moderate pace, although if your the type to throw it back fast it won't kick. But that just ain't right."
"D: Blending the old ale with some fresh brew has made this quite drinkable. I could session this... but I'd be in trouble!"
"Pours a clear brown, some red in the edges, thick off white head, some spots of lace, nice retention. Smell is sweet and malty, some iron and minerals, dark fruits, alcohol, not bad. Taste is sweet, some toffee, dark fruits, really malty and coating, brown sugar, little alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, almost thick, nice coating, decent sipper."
"This really is a beautiful beer with it's deep amber hues and dense mousey head that clings to the side of the glass. The aroma yields strong doses of caramel and oaky vanilla but mostly a very powerful citrus. The tast is really complex. For the most part, a sour citrusy taste dominates with oak in the background from start to finish with flashes of many other elements such as caramel, grain, vanilla, and dried fruit. Not sure if I cought it all as it seems with every sip I catch something else in a flash. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than what I would expect with a beer of this compexity but I like the moderate carbonation. Overall I have to put the drinkability just a little above average because, while it's a complex and interesting beer that I would have again if offered, the sour citric quality leaves an odd character to it that for just doesn't quite meld well with the other flavors... definitely worth a try though as I can see how someone else might rate this one much higher than I have."
"Overall an enjoyable beer."
"D - Very tasty; I like this a lot."
"Bottle: Poured a dark burgundy color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of semi-sweet malt with some light oak. Taste is a mix between some sweet caramelized malt with some very subtle notes of oak and fruit. Body is way too light and carbonation is low which is to be expected of. I have to admit that this one was a bit deceiving and definitely lacking in complexity."
"A beautiful dark ruby red with a lush tan head. Lots of complex flavour experience here. In fact it's hard to pin down as the taste goes through various transformations that I'm just not expert enough to characterize. All I can say is that this tastes like quality.Full bodied sayeth the label. This is a very smooth beer though with spicey aftertaste. I'm at a loss for descriptors but you should try it. If you like complexity in your beer this one will do it and it goes down like a river of melted butterscotch (with hops)."
"Medium body and relatively lightly carbonated, this beer has something for everyone. On one hand, you have a rich, flavorful brown ale. On the other is a refreshing acidity. Either inspired by or the inspiration for Flemish browns."
"This isnt an 'oak bomb' by any means, but it has a very definite oak flavor. Tastey and complex, worth a try."
"Three thumbs up on this awsome mellow smooth blended ale....wish I could taste this one unpasturized."
"LCBO advanced tasting- This pours a faintly carbonated copper liquid, with just a petit amount of beige dusting. Nice malt based aroma(toasty, roasted malts, bready) with woody, nutty, burnt sugars. Flavours are a wonderfully balanced interpretation of the aromas. Lots of vanilla/wood, with sweet nutty malts, toasty, with a smidge of the ABV shining through. Very warming, and dangerously drinkable. Finishes with a big malt bang, and a wonderful warmth."
"Pored this into a 16 oz tumbler with a wide top. Whew!!! this brew really has a smell that is like whiskey. Taste was strong and when you exhale that oak/whiskey smell was very evident. Was a decent different brew, but most likely will not buy one again."
"Pours a dark brown-black with red in the light. The thin white head dissipates quite quickly, but the ale is obviously quite lively. Aroma of walnuts and bit of oak, and some malt as well. Lots of caramel appears as is warms and dark wood. Taste was very complex sweet, peppery, sappy, some piney hops, dry finish. Mouthfeel was spitzy, tastes like they used hard water to brew. This is very complex and takes some time to finish, which is great."
"Lovely malty (chocolate, toffee) and sweet dried fruit aromas. To taste, similar initial flavours, alcohol noticeable, but it has such a beautiful long lasting bitter finish that goes on and on. Overall everything comes together in this excellent English ale, which I'd be happy to drink all day long."
"Complex and robust at the same time. This is a highly enjoyable beer, although a bit expensive (but that comes with the territory). Be sure to enjoy this one."
"This is a solid old ale, not quite on a par with the best, like TH or Engine Oil, but good in and of itself. Give it a go."
"D- Bit to watery and laid back for me. I like stronger flavors and this was lacking that quite a bit."
"Beautiful garnet color with a decent tan head with some urging. Nose is reticent, deep malt is obvious but it's very stingy here. Smells a tad sour and dusty. Taste however is exceptional. Bits of dark fruit here and there, more than a touch of sourness, hints of vanilla, oak, some acidity, cocoa powder and mild earthy tealike hops drying it out. Good mineral aspect and very nice. Mouthfeel is full with soft, low carbonation. Very creamy. Very drinkable too."
"Either it's way past due, or is just plain mediocre beer, and I'm inclined to think it's the latter. Good example of an import in a pretty bottle that isn't worth my time or money."
"Quite an unusal beer. Drank it as a part of a beer tasting flight. The others in attendance were uncertain...some liked, some not so. Its overall score was 3.4, from 6 tasters."
"This is one beer that makes me proud to be a Beer Advocate. A must try!"
"Drinkability - Oh my, this was a pleasure to drink. So very smooth, so clearly representing what an English Ale should be. Except for the price, I would often say, pass me another."
"Poured into a pint glass, had a half inch off-white/khaki head which dissipated soon after the first sip and left decent lacing. The smell was complex, albiet not very strong, with notes of caramel/chocolate malts, and an almost berry-like fruit aroma that reminded me of red wine (specifically some cabernet cavingions i've had). I really enjoyed the taste, the caramel and chocolate malts stand out again firstly, and a berry/grape taste follows, ending with a dry finish. There are a lot of flavours going on, but they all seem a little subdued, however this didnt hamper my enjoyment of the beer. It is medium bodied and the carbonation is perfect so it actually feels very light. Would definately drink this again."
"I was impressed by the age stuff, so i was wondering if this one was something like a blurred Porto wine, Jerez or something like that. No, it's a dark beer, with strong (but not as much as i expected) body, nice concentration of malt, smell and taste. But nothing soooo special. It's a good beer. Good, good, good. But that´s all. It works as an ordinary black ale, crafted far away from the barrels."
" Very well done. Exceptional drinkability. Worth the effort to find and try this fine Old Ale."
"Didn't quite know what to make of this one. Its colour, smell, and taste were all totally different from what I was expecting. It poured a crystal clear dark reddish brown colour. The head was khaki in colour and approximately 4mm thick. It subsided to nothing in less than 45 seconds. The smell was very interesting, and also unexpected. Very wine-like. It actually had a fruity / grape smell. There was a substantial amount of roasted malt in the background, clearly identifiable, but the wine - grape - alcohol smell was easily noticeable and right up front. Peculiar. The taste was reminiscent of wine, as well. Malty for but a moment when you take a sip, then turning tart and very wine like. Odd indeed as I have never had an ale with these characteristics, though I have read of them. Mouthfeel seemed light and was much more carbonated than I was expecting. I didn't think this was awful, but I certainly wasn't impressed. Very peculiar brew."
"Pours a very dark red which has been typical of most of the old ales I've tried. Brandy-ish scent is very heavy in the smell. Taste doesn't overhwelm, but hints of brandy and raisins are easily detectable. Much more drinkable than my other favorite old ale, Thomas Hardy. Not quite a session beer, of course, but if you're looking to have 1-2 beers one night, this is definitely recommended. An all-around solid old ale that's easy to find."
"Not entirely successful, but worth a try."
"Taste; theres's chocolate covered cherries, caramel malts and dried figs. The oakiness is really blended well, and doesn't become overpowering. A bit of a sourness comes out as this gets warmer along with some vinous qualities, and a little alcohol burn in the finish. A very nice, relaxing beer. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but this is still very easy to drink."
"Drinkability would be good if I was able to get a fresh batch, but I don't think it survived the trip over very well."
"Overall: I remember my last bottle (bottle-conditioned, as I remember it) being much richer on the palate, but that was four years ago. I'm not sure if the recipe has been changed, but the beer as it is now is quite drinkable and thirst-quenching even. But why has it been changed to the pasteurised+filtered(?) version? Or is my memory a bit too hazy to get this fact right?"
"But overall, this is a nice complex brew that has a lot going on in it."
"From a bottle shared at the March Michiana Coalition of the Drinking meeting. dark, very little head. dark amber colored. has a caramel, woody odor. Malty flavor that is syrupy and sweet. sweet caramel and molasses flavor is very strong. i can see drinking this but its really unlike anything else i see in the U.S."
"1998 Vintage: Clear ruby/mahogany with a short tan head that reduced to a thin wisp of bubbles. Some lace. There was a light vinous/sherry aroma that melded nicely with ripe/dried fruit and a hint of oakiness. Complex fruit and woody flavour with a light tartness, hint of cherry and a bit of chocolate/toffee in the finish. Medium body, low carbonation, smooth and slightly drying. Very tasty. This beer has aged well and the bottle I shared was in excellent shape. 4/4.5/4/4/4"
"Very smooth and drinkable, a very nice strong old ale."
"while this reminds me of the traquair beers (oak-fermented though pasteurized) it also has a lot of similarity to the flemish reds without the sourness. i recommend it to anyone who likes any of the above."
"The bottle indicates that this is a blend of two ales that have been aged in oak for two years. This beer pours from a brown bottle a dark brown with ruby being evident with a decent head. Smell is malty and vinous. Taste is definitely vinous to some extent, malt is a strong part of the taste, notes of oak are also apparent. This is the second one I've had, I liked it more the first time, they were labeled differently, this is a review of Olde Suffolk, last time I had the Strong Suffolk. I'm not sure if there is any difference between the two, or if any differences could be attributed to how the beer was cared for or just my mood. Definitely an interesting beer, I doubt this will be the last time I try it."
"Overall - A very good beer.... Recommended..."
"Probably a little better than I expected. Pours a heavy dark brown color with a fair head that fell to a trace, though laced well. Rich malt aroma with light roasted, toasted character. Tastes as malty as the aroma suggests. Big sweetness with a faint, sweet alcohol flavor. The periphreals are decorated with coffee, cocoa, stout-like flavor and bitterness. Moderately full and heavy to the mouth respective to style. Sweet with a mild relief with the roasted bitterness. Finishes full and savory, but without the syrupy, thickness, and aged characteristics normally found in Old Ales."
"Overall this is robust and interesting brew. I enjoy the character more as it warms. It is mild enough to be a session beer. I would recommend this one."
"Very full, complex but well balanced and mellow flavor. This will go well with a variety of food but deserves to be appreciated by itself. Marvelous."
"This beer was one of the best beers I have ever tasted. It poured nice and dark with a good head. the smell was pleasing. the taste was the best part on taking a mouthful it covered all of the tastes perfectly in my opinion, slight coffee flavor. If you have a chance to try this beer do so it will not let you down."
"A clean dark chestnut brown beer with some mahogony highlights. Has a nice creamy dark beige head with just a little bit of lace.. There is a nutty sweet malt aroma followed by an intrigueing oak note. Malty sweet down the middle of the tongue with a bit of roasted malt bitterness down the sides. good mouthfeel and a satisfiying finish."
"Wonderful beer. One of the things I love I love about it is that the finishing bitterness is so subtle as not to totally and abrasively balance the malts out, rather the flavors flowed from sweet to mildly bitter. Fantastic."
"Despite this beer's high ratings, I am not feeling it. Lacks complexity, especially on the tongue."
"A dark ruby tinted beer. Poured out with very little head and no active carbonation. Smells a little sweet and alot of dark fruit (dates, raisins, plums) and mildly oaky and peppery. Tasted of dark fruit, a bit of caramel and dry vanilla though flavours are not pronounced really...somewhat mineral or metallic notes which where slightly off-putting. Of all, i disliked the mouthfeel most. There was some carbonation, but it was a little thin. I would have liked and expected a bit more fullness. This thing was easy to put down with the low abv and it's relative lack of complexity, though warmth brought out a little more flavor... but don't know that i'd seek this out often. Just wasn't ""alive"" enough for my tastes."
"Pours a deep mahogany with very little carbonation and a tan head. A single finger head quickly setlles down to barely cover the surface of the beer. Rich sweetness in aroma, but rather faint and hard to pick up. Very smooth, not too heavy with some smokiness. The flavour envelopes the entire palate as you sip on this one. A lot of character with hints of coffee and caramel as it warms a bit. Overall a fantastic Old Ale. My favourite style, and this is definately one to seek out. A terribly enjoyable brew."
" -cheers2beers"
"Really enjoyed this one and I would recommend it as a great changeup from the usual."
"Drinkability and Overall: A nice, robust Old Ale from England. A very good, complex yet balanced beer that I won't soon forget. Highly recommended, as it's such an authentic old ale. Mmmm..."
"Drinkability and Notes  Certainly not a chugging beer, but for a full malty, complex beer it is pretty easy to drink. This is a good beer with loads of flavor big beer flavor, but much less alcohol than I am used to in Old Ales. Im sorry I cant get this around me."
"Notes: I review ""Old Suffolk Vintage Ale"" here, nothing very special, just very good all around English ale"
"Age has taken away some of it's complexities and dulled the pallet."
"This is has been down in the cellar a couple of years and it looks like tawny bootpolish with a slight haze. The nose is all old fruit and old hops with a iron undertone. The taste is complex as hell with tobacco, dried fruit and a solid malt backbone. A pleasant metallic twang sits on the back of your tongue with the finish. This is much like a Brown from Belgium in its continual ability to challenge and delight the senses."
"Opinion: This is a very well crafted beer. British ales aren't my favorite styles of beers, but this is one that stands out among the rest. It has a bold flavor, but ends up finishing pretty balanced and refreshing. I would definitely say that even if you are like myself when it comes to British beers, that you should give this beer a ""day in court""."
"Dark brown with ruby hints. Medium carbonation and full bodied. Strong aroma of malt, sweet berry fruits, and apple. Very malty flavor, with some hops. Fruity, spicey, and some suggestion of coffee, licorice and chocolate. Quite a long finish. 2000 vintage."
"D - This is an enjoyable ale. Mild in just about everyway."
"500 ml bottle, as ""Greene King Strong Suffolk Vintage Ale", vintage 2000, sampled May 2005 at the Champion of the Thames, Cambridge. Served too cold from the fridge. Deep brown to ruby colour, large thick head. Vinous aroma, oak and claret, hints of English pipe tobacco. (One of the punters was smoking his pipe in the pub when I sampled this beer, but I swear the beer had some unsmoked pipe tobacco aroma too.) Vinous flavour (old port wine) with caramel and raisins. A bit too sweet for my taste (or maybe I was too drunk to fully appreciate the sweetness?)"
"I've had 4 or 5 of the 2000's, all great. I managed to overwrite the old review...but i had the 2000's before the fresh bottles"
"I was expecting something a bit grosser, frankly. I've had a string of bad luck with british vintage ales, but this one's a keeper. The malt is intense enough to keep you interested, but not enough so that you're all set with one. I enjoyed the barrel aged flavors, the sharp wine sourness added quite a bit of complexity. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Other comments: Tried this on cask at Charlie's Bar in Copenhagen. According to the bartender, this is the only place where you can get it on cask. It is done especially for them. Since it is one of my favorite British beers and I've only tried it in bottled form, I had to give it a try. Of course, even better than the bottled one!"
"Olde Suffolk English Ale is different and is very good. The two years that (part of) it spent in oak were years well spent. That woodiness gives it that *certain something* that makes it distinctive. Since the flavor is becoming richer and more intense with warming, I'll take my leave in order to concentrate on the second half of the bottle. The most amazing thing of all is that this fine ale is available at my local grocery, right alongside the Bud Select and the Coors Light."
"From bottle, 2000 vintage. What an interesting beer! Pours dark ruby/mahogany (almost the colour of a tawny port) with a small but creamy head which retains fairly well but with no lacing observed. Complex aroma with sweet malt dominating, and hints of freshly removed wine bottle cork. Very complex taste, hard to pick up anything in paricular until the pleasantly bitter espresso finish which lasts a long time. Very nice drop."
"Full bodied, a bit warming, seems stronger than it is."
"Thin mouthfeel but very pleasant. The oakiness may be a bit powerful at times. For something different, refreshing, and surprising, this is a great brew."
"A very nice beer, but very rich (n flavor, not in how it sits on the stomach). Be prepared. Probably very good for a late end to the day, especially a cold and wintry one. Very recommended."
"Good mouthfeel."
"This is just a wonderful tasting beer. Excellently balanced with a great frutiyness and freshness. Really enjoyable and easy drunk, great brew!"
"Lacks the punch to be a winter warmer, but the drinkability is excellent. An exceptional array of flavors are displayed from start to finish. Give me three bottles of this and I could spend a full afternoon and evening trying to decipher the complexities of this magnificent ale. This is one of the better English ales I've enjoyed recently. I look forward to getting my paws on a few more of these."
"2000 issue. Light brown cover surpasses a deep brown garnet. Aroma is complex, vinous and malty. Shy balsamic cherries initially surprises until they are reached by mellower red grapes reminiding of a tart red wine. Added to the yeasty hints, this was like a liquid raisin bread with an interesting dark malt profile (roasted chocolate, nuts). Unfortunately, it didnt really hold up in the taste department where its more meaty rather than richly bready and desserty and just far less complex and developping. Theres this unique fruit tartness thing going on under an apple clothe, but it heads nowhere. Flavor evolution made me think of a cone without a summit. Fine mouthfeel though, medium body with appropriate carbonation, a bit higher than expected."
"2000 Vintage, thanks Bob. This one pours out a dark brown colouring with a big beige head that lasts quite well for a ""strong ale"" hehe. Aromas are complex and consist of sherry, vanilla, a bit of oak, and the normal slightly roasty malt aromas. The taste is smooth up front with the subdued oak and vanilla flavors leading into a nice malty middle and a slightly strong finish of subdued hops and a bit of chocolate/almost coffee. Mouthfeel is creamy, and smooth, but not too thick. Drinkability is very good. This is probably amazing on cask."
"Great Drinkability, a very easy drinking english ale."
"Had the recent edition in early 2007, 2.3 years later and it was really noticeable woody, and well hopped. Do a side by side with oak aged AB. Still very nice. Review based on the first aged edition."
"This is a blend of a fresh ale and a strong ale that have been matured in oak casks for two years, giving it a very multifaceted taste. World class!"
"Once you get past the rush of liquid cardboard I initially noticed, this is a good English experience. Its rather hard to describe in its astringency, however. Slighly thin mouthfeel, med to low drinkablility."
"mellow creamy smooth beer with a touch of bitterness on a long finish. very tasty beer"
"I'd love to try this on tap!"
"Very robustly malty, with about as much caramel malt as one could pack into the flavor profile. Given the hype of the barrel maturation, I expected a bit more complexity than what presented. There was a bit of soft acidity in the malt, lending a touch of liqueur to the flavor. Finish was bright and a bit astringent, which cleaned up nicely. An interesting beer, but not one that engaged me."
"I don't get this beer. So much time and work go into making it, and this is the result? It looks great, it smells great, but bluntly, there's not much flavor to speak of. I think I may have to come back to this beer, maybe I'm having an off night. Right now, not a favorite."
"Super drinkable brew, one of those beers than can pull off the difficult trick of being complex and mild at the same time."
"Pours a one-finger light brown head that fades to a ring and leaves hardly any lace. Light carbonation, light to medium bodied. Color is a nice clear amber. Starts wth coffee overtones and has some hoppiness. A good ale too bad it is ""brewed in limited quantities"". $3.90 for a 16oz bottle at Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Clear dark copper hue under a reddish-tan one finger head that fades quickly to film and collar. Lacing is minimal. There's some floral hops in the nose, along with a bit of citrus fruit. The mouth is heavy and medium carbonated. The taste opens with substantial heavy malt, plus some plum sweet and sour notes. Strong, crisp British hops follow in the finish, leaving a nice dry bitterness in the aftertaste. The fruitiness is a bit of a distraction for me, but this is a good drinking brew. Yum."
"This smooth ale starts out with a nice sweet malt taste that has hints of carmel and raisins as in the aroma. It also has a slight coffee note to it and a nice bit of bitterness in the end."
"Pours a nice deep reddish brown color with very little head and no lacing whatsoever.Nice aroma-somewhat sherry like.Malty,no noticeable hops.Nice flavor-caramel and toffee.Slight alchohol burn in the back.Lingering sweetness.Full mouthfeel-oily,smooth.A very enjoyable beer.Pleasant sipping on a relaxing,cool spring nite."
"pours out a deep dark red tinted brown/copper. somewhat small bubbly head, light lacing. smells of sweet malt, raisin bread, alcohol and caramels rise up making for a most mouthwatering aroma. full bodied with smooth carbonation, silky. taste wise its sweet and malty, once again caramels, raisins, some coffee notes and a light hop bitterness. an awesome ale, one to be savored while relaxing. yum."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth and sticky but the drink is a little heavy for a session beer. A fantastic offering nonetheless, and the blending and aging really improve the flavours."
"Pours a rich crimson brown (cola brown) with a an off-white spider web lacy head. Smell is a delightfully complex mix of ripe fruit, whiskey, oak shavings, plums wine. Very nice. Taste starts vinuously sweet, tart, and vinegary. Toffee cookie dough malt notes come in strong and then give way to a gentle finish of tangy hops. Oaky character throughout, and the flavors linger forever. Full feeling, especially for its strength and well worth the money."

"Pours a dark cola color and appears to be clear with a small modest dense light tan head. The rich smell of sweet malts and is also a tad fruity blends nicely enough to make the mouth water. The flavors of heavy malts with a nice sweet tone, perfectly blended hops, and finishes with a light raison on the tail. This is a medium to heavy bodied brew that ends with a smooth sweetness. This is one good brew! Wow! Cheers!"
"This is an interesting bottle containing an interesting brew. It comes in a pint bottle with a long thin neck. It pours an eye-pleasing mahogany with a smallish head that disappears quickly. The smell is an intriguing mix of toffee, oak, pipe tobacco, and a bit of hops. Although the beer screams English, it's somehow reminiscent of a dopplebock at the same time. It's a very nice beer and worth seeking out."
"ive rolled out the superlatives here i know, but geez this is a fine brew. anyone who comes across suffolk vintage would be a madman not to give it a nudge. a classic example of a strong english ale. it sits along the likes of adnams broadside, fullers 1845 and ESB as the best in the biz in the genre."
"[About 1/2 way though I lit an Aristoff Black Robusto Extra, and flavor-wise it was a perfect match, but it was about 10% too much for the beer.]"
"What a great English ale this is. Dark amber brown and cloudy with a nice thick head. Good retention here with scattered lacing. Big sweet malt aroma with a woody, fruitiness. I detect some herbs as well in there. Flavor is noticably English, a good strong malty ale with a slight bitterness in the finish. Overall one of the best English ales I've had in a bottle."
"Pours dark burgundy in color with a tall and foamy tan colored head that only remains for a second before fading into a thin lace. Nose is rather wine like with some additional notes of molasses. Full mouthfeel with little active carbonation and a smooth, slightly oily, texture. Taste begins with sweet roasted malts and brown sugar followed by some oakey notes and a sour raisiny flavor that gives way to some noticeable hops that leave a dry finish and lingering aftertaste. An enjoyable brew thats a good choice for a nightcap. Some additional aging would probably also benefit this complex beer."
"Dark burgundy hue with snippets bronze from the penetrating light, it is awesome eye candy. The beige head never development much height, not that I was expecting it too. It topped off at a half finger, which quickly faded to a soapy residue. Did not lace. The nose on this ale is wonderful; great potency initially, the aroma, at its best, is literally mouthwatering. The strength does die a little in time. The bouquet is wine-like upfront, followed by oak, light but noticeable raw alcohol (like brandy), malts, and a hint of buttery-cream. The palate is not as biting or raw as some Old Ales; this could be an attribute of the blending of the two ales (see the back of the label) or I have an older bottle. Anyway it is very unique tasting, malty upfront but that is quickly followed by a mellow woody-winey-creamy taste then a kiss of alcohol follows; the finish is divine, seriously. Figs and fruit, subtle sweetness, distant and suppressed hops (aged?), a kiss of wood, a note of dry bitterness. Yeah, it is that damn good. The carbonation is light but appropriate, medium-full body, all in all, a very respectable mouthfeel. A tremendous quaff, something to savor, I would love to drink this on a regular basis. I snagged a couple bottles of this fine brew in Des Moines for $3.50 each. I wish I bought more. Recommended. Seek it out."
"Pours with a light tan sticky head. Clear dark brown in color with garnet highlights. The head reduces to a thin lace that covers the surface. Rich sweet caramel malt and dark fruits notes in the aroma. Nose is also somewhat vinous with a little noticeable alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium, but seems a little on the lighter side. Theres a fine carbonation one the tongue and the feel is quite smooth on the palate. Sweet malt starts with some dark fruitiness. Vinous notes come through quite well along with a woody/oak flavor. Theres a mild yet tart hoppy finish that is just a touch roasty. A little alcohol is noticeable on the aftertaste. This is a well balanced and very drinkable brew. A complex yet very enjoyable old ale."
"Overall Impression: Nice stuff! Both the malt and the hops are given a chance to show their stuff. The blending of old and new works nicely, almost like getting 2 beers in 1. Satisfying, but drinkability isn’t impaired."
"Well worth seeking out and even sticking some into the Cellar for a bit longer. I know of a few people in the UK who have actually tried one of the base beers, the Olde 5X, during tours of the Brewery  if that ever got released, now that would be something!!"
"Nice dark brown English Ale that pours with very little head but gives off a rich aroma. The oak barrel aging is easily apparant, but not overpowering. Has a bit of bite but is firmly founded on a chocolate malt. Tastes better as it warms, and broadens in it's mouthfeel."
"Pours to a mahogany color with a light tan head. It forms an excellent amount of lacing when sipped down. The aroma is malty, with chocolate notes. The flavor is rich, malty and chocolatey with a slight oakiness in the drying finish. It is a full bodied brew that is very tasty. It was a very enjoyable beer that took me by surprise."
"Small, coarse, yellowish tan head. Small spots of lacing. Very dark color: toffee/brown, red through light. Tangy, metallic, vinous nose with hints of magic marker. The front is toffee, fruit, sugar. Middle gets a little sour, but there's still plenty of toffee and fruit. Metallic finish fades with temperature, leaving nice tangy apples. This is not bad at all. Tangy, apples and creamier with temp."
"Grab me a bib if I ever come across this on cask."
"The feel is just as one expects - smooth, clean, not crisp in the ending, but rather a bit lingering and creamy. Drinkability is high for a substantially high alcohol beer."
"Deep clear mahogany color, head was good at first but shrunk away to near nothing. lacing was a few wisps here and there. Aroma was of sweet malts and fruity hops, classic English aroma. Very smooth malty taste that was both slightly sweet and a tad roasty at the same time. Fruitty hops so typical of fine English ale were in perfect balance with the maltiness. Full bodied and rounded, very drinkable on this coolish September day (not normal) here in California. Outstanding, and bring on winter so I can enjoy more of these types of brews again."
"This is a wonderful beer. It is reminiscent of holiday ales but without the sweetness; yet, it is slicker and sweeter than most English bitters. Eminently drinkable."
"Dark black color, medium head. A full bodied English Ale. This beer is a blend of 2 year old aged in oak beer with fresh young beer. Rich full malts, very complex flavor. Some hop spiciness. Rich, robust complex flavor. Nice taste. Mouthfeel is full and complex. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Very interesting beer."
"On the bottle it is claimed that this is a blened beer, using an oak barrel aged beer and cutting it with a younger beer, a BPA. In this beer I think this works. The roast character is not overpowering and seems well placed in the beer. The blend of the fresh beer definately adds a youth to the final beer that makes it enjoyable. A bit more flavoring hops would make this beer stand out, but that might not be to style."
"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Aug 4th, 2003: Pours a dark amber-brown with a medium beige head and thin lacing. Aroma of smoke, caramel and malt. Smooth drinking with a nice caramel/maple and malt character. There is also a nice spiced aspect to the flavor that offsets the sweetness. The finish is semi-sweet fruit and malt. Good stuff."
"I really enjoyed this beer and mix of flavors, gets better as it warms, complexity and balanced seemed right on."
"It's dark amber with a solid thick coating atop. A strong malty aroma is very pleasant and full of caramel notes. Flavors are dominated by malts at first and it's wonderfully toasty and sweet. Hops come through just enough for an awesome finish. This stuff is friggin awesome, kind of similar to some Scotch Ales I have tried, but smoother."
"Thin, small-bubbled head. The beer very dark and murky... cloudy and dark brown. Smells like honey and woods. Not too sweet. I really like the oaken flavor. It really tastes and feels well-aged. Smooth, with a little bite. No lingering sweet aftertaste. wonderful beer."
"Very buttery on the palate - smooth, oily, hints of diacetyl but not from Ringwood. Then the flavors expand - coffee, chocolate, bitter hop, molasses, and a certain hardness that I can't put my finger on. Undercurrents of alcohol are also present. Finishes with a molasses and toffelike flavor that works well. Simply unbeatable with a well-aged cheddar. Very drinkable, as I keep trying to nurse another sip out of my empty glass. Very complex, eminently drinkable brew - three of these, a fire in the fireplace, and a hunk of 5 year old Balderson's cheddar would be an evening fit for a king."
"You can smell the alcoholic grains right away, even as it pours out. Has a strong musty bread aroma, yeasty but perhaps more like a burgundy or whiskey. Has some molasses, citrus fruit, and wood-like notes. The taste echos the smell, very complex and multi layered. Its smooth and mellow with a nice fruity dryness that speaks volumes of fresh grains, lets see, had sweet caramel maltyness, some molasses, fresh bread, flour, citrus fruits, small woody and hop notes dance around helping balance out the citrus and alcohol. It has a wine-like feel in the finish and feel, sweet citrusy and dry. Highly drinkable with its complex smell and flavor you'd expect it to knock you on your ass. But its so mellow and smooth. It reminded me sort of a dry lemonade spiked with whiskey. It became more drinkable and dry as it warmed, I liked it a little more when it was colder, but had to drink slowly when it was cold. Packs a good punch when cold."
"Drinkability...with the nice flavor and a little alcohol warmth...I could drink many of these"
"It poured thick and the color was a clear reddish brown, with a tan head and nice lace on the glass. When first smelled, I got a french vanilla and candy aroma. The taste of chocolate, molasses and roasted malts, with a hint of yeast. This is a smooth ale, with a little bitterness in the end to balance out his fine beer. As it warms up I started getting a different flavor, like french vanilla and other complex flavors. What a pleasant surpise to find this beer. Everytime I take a sip, the flavor changed as this beer warms up."
"Comments: Unfortunately the aroma ruined the enjoyment of this beer for me."
"Absolutely brilliant deep mahogany/ruby colorperhaps even lovelier than the gem itself. Magnificent malty and fruity aroma. Complex flavors consisting of a deliciously hefty malt backbone, huge fruity grape, plum, raisin and toasted caramel. Hops are only for balance, though some faint piney notes can be detected. Alcohol gently warms the body and soul. Mouthfeel is medium-full, carbonation is low-moderate. Mmmmgrape juice burps. This brew is a unique blend of 2 year old oak conditioned and new ales. Incredible beer, an automatic classic. A must try, seek this out."
"The taste develops as the beer warms. Nice caramel and bread flavors, with a winelike acidity biting the tongue slightly, or perhaps it is the tannins from the oak vats. Nonetheless, this is a very mellow and smooth beer, that has a very nice body behind it. A real winner if you can find it in your area."
"Pours out a deep, dark brown color, under a full, lush cocoa-colored head. Generously aromatic, issuing hints of nuts, coffee, cream, toffee, butter. Malt is very prominent, hops take the backseat. Taste is smooth and delicious, with a slightly oily palate. Body is thick, rich, texture is very nice, and the finish continues the sweet, candyish flavors found initially in the nose,and they rest leisurely on the tastebuds. Puts me in mind of a brown ale, but done right, with flavor. Perfectly balanced, perfectly enjoyable, a tasty treat. A good ale with dinner, or in lieu of dessert."
"Deep ruby in color with a thin, tan head. First aroma open opening is sherry-like with a medium-strong alcohol nose. As it sits, the malt comes to dominate with hints of molasses, a bit of cinamon-like spiciness, and a noticeable tartness. The flavor starts smooth and malty, but then quickly develops some spicy hop notes. A very light fruitness as though from an English pale ale is detectable mid-palate, but soon yields to a re-assertive spiciness as the finish develops with a moderate hop bitterness and a roasty malt character which lingers on to the aftertaste. Medium-full in body with a slightly dry finish, but *very* well-balanced. Quite pleasant."
"The palate is much better than the nose (yeah, I tasted it during the sour milk nose too). There is rich bready licorice, and molasses. Although this was initially served at cellar temp (today 55F) it got better and more complex as it warmed. The finish is long and winey, and there seems to be some tannins giving structure. An interesting brew that I'll try again to see if that sour milk thing was an abberation."
"A deep brownish ruby color when held up to to the light in a glass. Smell of faint oak. I taste a hint of caramel with a sweet aftertaste that remains a while. The most noticeable thing I get is the mouthfeel with a syrupy coating. It will cause you to sip the beer rather than gulp it. There is some biting alcohol presence if you allow the beer to sit still on your tongue for a bit. I let the beer warm up some because it seemed so subtle but it didn't change too much. A subtle beer other than the mouthfeel."
"(Note) It is now available in the states, and Ive found it at two local Beer Palaces!"
"Happy Halloween."
"Smashing! Dark and lacy without much head. Malty black currant nose. Caramel and light chocolate balanced with some mossy hop. An odd style, nonetheless tasty. Indeed, quite tasty."
"Very dark ruby-brown color, nice 1/2 inch head that holds an elevated ""ring"" inside the pint glass. Dank aroma, a little molasses. Nice roasty flavors that persist to the swallow. Coffee flavors, a little raisin, and chocolate. Some sense of grape, as well. Nice complex malt flavor. A blend of an ""Old"" Ale with a new batch, this brew reminds me of the blended beers of ""yore""...very nice stuff."
"an awesome little english strong ale, an excellent blend between, malt and hops, medium body with a dry finish, i like it a lot."
"Solid beer. Dark with a brownish-tan head. Smells of roasted chocolate and caramel, hints of coffee. Very unique taste, all of it good and just sweet enough. Definatly a keeper."
"Nice reddish brown color with light brown head with reddish hues.  Aroma is very enticing.  Really unique flavor with quite a bit of complexity...  every sip seems to bring out different flavors.  Hint of sourness in the finish.  Very easily drinkable. Didn't know what to expect when I opened the bottle, but I was pleasantly surprised."
"Wow did this beer surprise me. I expected a pale english style ale. The color is a dark caramel with a thin light tan head, that quickly evaporates. The smell is simialer to a stout or dopplebock and its appearance is too. The first tast is a strong heavy roasted caramel that finishes with a crisp hop flavor. This is the most complex beer I have ever tasted, and it is very very good ! Nice warming finish from the alcohol. I would keep this one for special occasions."
"Poures a deep brown with some ruby-like tint to it with almost no head to it,very nice aroma of oak and caramel with some brown sugar.A real sipping brew here to savor the different flavors some big oaky notes along with some brown sugar and caramel with this,an almost cola-like flavor as well, as it warms the oak comes thru even more.A real nice old, ale here one to savor."
"This is a quality, unique ale.  Pours dark brown with a tan head that leaves a nice lace.  Loads of flavors packed into a relatively light beer.  It's winey, oaky, with a tad of sourness.  Finishes easy.  Makes you want another."
