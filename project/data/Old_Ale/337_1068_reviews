"Pours with a small, white head. Has a dark amber color with small particles floating within the ale. Smells sweet from the hops.  The hops give it a pine and citrus taste. A hint of malt is also present. Overall taste is great. Somehow, the brewers at Saint Arnold have actually captured Christmas in a bottle."
"But, as I stated at the outset, it's a good beer—and a welcome break from much of the holiday fare one sometimes encounters.  However, at the same time, had it been sold consistently at $8+ per six-pack, I probably would not have swooped in for seconds, much less more."

"My favorite beer during the holidays."
"Mellow and tasty, yet strong and distinct. Spices work well with this brew not overpowering."

"Overall:  I enjoy this beer for what it is, a hearty malt-forward ale.  There is no ""spices"" added which is what many people associate holiday beers with.  I personally consider it a celebratory, beefed-up version of their amber ale."

"winter warmer or old ale -- either way, it's not my favorite style, so my numbers will be off by 0.25 to 0.50 or more. i personally wouldn't recommend trying more than a single brew or two of this ... i made it through a 6-pack fine, but i won't touch this one again."

"Pours dark amber color with thick foamy head that quickly dissipates, although head retention is decent.  Mild lacing.  Has a mildly spicy apple aroma.  Bready taste up front with a mild nutty hoppy spiciness.  Mildly bitter, apple like aftertaste.  Good beer for holiday season."

"12oz. bottle: This one pours a clear, orangish amber color. There was a very small off white head on it that didn’t linger or leave any lacing. Pretty decent nose. Caramel malts, some fruits (apple?), hints of spices. The taste is pretty good too. Caramel malts, with a hint of roast. A subdued sweetness with some bitterness trying to come through, resulting in a hint of dryness in the finish."

"A decent tasting Christmas beer, you can taste the spices but they don't overwhelm the beer taste."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours copper with an off-white head that dissipates at a moderate pace. There are a lot of visible tiny bubbles in the beer. The beer smells of toffee and chocolate. There are some floral notes as well from the hops. What hits the tongue is a big malt presence with toffee and chocolate. The alcohol comes through in the taste as do the hops, which bring some floral, earthy, and mild spice notes to the taste. The body is medium to full with strong carbonation. This leads to a cleaner than expected finish. This is a very good beer."

"O - Very yeasty, very malty. Sweet, Christmasy beer, but I feel it could be more balanced. It's not as satisfying as a lot of Saint Arnold's beers, but it still has a unique flavor and feel. Worth a try, but I don't drink more than one or two of these a year."
""
""
""
"Nice for a winter warmer, but I'm not getting why they call it a Christmas Ale. I generally tend to think of Christmas Ales as spiced beers, but there is not a trace of spice or ""holiday flavor"" in this beer. Don't get me wrong, it's delicious!"

"Overall Impression- Not sure whats going on with this one... A nice brew but a Winter Warmer... Couldn't even believe this one was 7% when I looked at it again. I wouldn't dis this one, just won't be going back to it and has some work to do."
"O: I suppose it's a little bit above average, stylistically, but in general, I wouldn't particularly recommend it. I suppose I'd drink another, but I'd have to be in the mood."

"O: The beer is ok, but I would pass over this for other holiday ales."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A low-key Christmas ale. Not bad, just doesn't have any Christmas spirit. Dandy with baked chicken."
"O: Not a fan of this beer at all. It's like a spicy lager. No thanks. I've had other beers from Saint Arnold that have been outstanding, but this beer falls short for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The finish on this beer was overly dry. Still a very good beer and I would have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'd get this one with Breckenridge's Christmas beer."
"O: I have passed this one up on the shelf all the time but never purchased till now and I will say I'm kind of impressed. This is what I imagine a true christmas ale to be. Add some belgian yeast to this one as a variant and I bet it would taste like a nice quad."
""
"I'm not entirely sure what the difference is between this and the brown ale. Although, to be honest, I haven't had the brown in a while. This is a nice warming ale but really not that special to me."
"I recommend you pick up some up now and decide if this is something you want through New Year's. I wouldn't be surprised if it was a standard for the next few weeks."

"Overall-Honestly haven't had too many winter warmers, and I think their just a malty, spicey beer, that's similar to a Pumpkin beer minus the pumpkin. I like where this beer is going but needs a little more body to it."
"O - For a 7% hides the alcohol well, the lightness of the flavors works a bit in its favor as is a Christmas brew you can drink a couple of and not feel overpowered."
"d"
"O: This is not the greatest winter warmer I have ever had, but a very solid one for sure."
"Not a bad beer - just doesn't fit style. I'll call it a strong amber ale."
"O: a very nice winter seasonal from Saint Arnold. Would definitely drink this all winter if I still lived in Houston."
"Pretty good, but the body is too light."
"This pours a nice copper color with a good off white head. The smells are very malt heavy, break caramel and toffee. The feel is medium. The taste is very malty with just a little hop bite, the taste is mostly of caramel and toffee malts, very good stuff."
"Very good job with this one Saint Arnold!"
"Overall: Not a bad winter warmer but not a great one either. The spices are subdued and not in your face but there is not enough complexity provided by the beer to make it anymore then a spiced beer."
"O: Very faded in its time. This beer really doesn't hold up well. in terms of flavor profiles, but it is far from undrinkable. I would love to try this beer fresh to see if there are any spices or anything else that may have faded."
"note: Had some on tap that was aged for a year and I enjoyed it even more."
"Overall this is a delicious offering from Saint Arnolds that I look forward to every Christmas. Excellent blend of caramel malt and spice. Definitely worth picking up a six"
"O: A tasty beer from SA. Always one of my favorite local seasonals, though a bit light for the winter. I look more forward to the Winter Stout in January."
"Overall, a very interesting winter ale to be drinking while the weather is in the low/mid 100's here in TX... but it works for me! Although I'd probably consider this more of a cross between a Winter Warmer and an Amber Ale."
"Considering there isn't much of a ""winter"" in the region of South Texas, it's nice to see a fresh offering from a nearby brewery in the Winter Warmer category. Into a brandy glass, this pours a clear and glimmering amber red color. Aroma is a lush one of candied sweet roasted malt and fragrant bright fruit. A robust yet crisp and refreshing body sweeps over the palate into a dry and warming finish with notes of mild cinnamon and roasted sugar. I'm look forward to next year's batch already..."
"Thanks Matt!"
"This brew has great flavor and is very well balanced."
"RJT"
"Awesome Beer!"
"D - Drinkability is moderate. Flavors are a bit traditional and just kind of 'there' but it certainly hides its alcohol well. Could've helped with just a touch more carbonation."
"It's a good beer, but a confusing beer."
"D - Goes down nice and leaves you refreshed. You can taste the alcohol, but it mixes well with all of the other flavors."
"Overall- I honestly really like saint arnold's Christmas ale. I will definately be drinking this again. I love what Brock Wagner is doing at SA and I enjoy his beers."
"Atmosphere is decent. Nice appearance and a malt and sweet balanced nose. Flavor is a syrupy sweet malt base with a little spice. Overall, this is a solid quaff."
"D: Easy, easy drinkin'."
"D- This is by far my favorite winter warmer. It is delicious, with enough complexity to keep your interest without overdoing it. If you are luck enough to come across this, stock up on a sixer or two."
"Light to medium body with light carbonation. Overall this has a nice mix of spices and drinks well. A little plain, but worth a try."
"D - A good seasonal, cold weather, occasional drinker. Fits the night well...a fresh snow on the ground and rather chilly. Working well sitting on the couch in front of the fireplace. I couldn't have this every day, but it is hitting the spot at the moment."
"D - Fairly drinkable, but the flavor leaves a little to be desired. Nonetheless, it is enjoyable and worth a try."
"Pours a copper-bronze color with a very thin head that quickly fades into a thin white color. There are a few bubbles on top as well. The nose is quite plain with just a tad bit of pine and cinnamon along with some caramel backing. The taste is along the same lines--pine and a bit of faint spicing plus a bit of caramel sweetness. Medium body with average carbonation. Overall, nothing offensive as it doesn't take the spicing too far, though it's quite boring."
"D - Very clean, a little high in ABV to be highly drinkable for me."
"Overall, it was an above average Christmas brew. Thus far I have tried Sam Adams Winter Lager and Shiner Holiday Cheer, and between all three, this one was my favorite. It had a good bitterness to it along with a nice malt profile."
"D: This beer does not seem to be at 7%. the alcohol is very well hidden. Could drink a few."
"I definitely would not have this at my Christmas dinner"
"D: Not nearly as bad I was anticipating, to be honest. A nice little winter warmer in the beginning of Southern California summer."
"Medium-full body, with tingly carbonation. Very ""active"" beer. Slightly off-putting finish, but still a tasty beer. Not bad per style."
"Thanks, ericandersnavy, for the oppportunity"
"D- I could see having a couple of these in a sitting."
"D- This was a very drinkable winter warmer. The ABV was not so high as to distract it from the beer. Even though the flavors were a bit muted at times this beer was still very enjoyable. Would recommend this to most people who don't want to drink hop or malt bombs but still want flavor in their beers."
"D: Goes down easy, relatively tasty, decent drinkability on this beer."
"M/D: Fairly drinkable, especially for the 7 percent. Okay mouthfeel that is not overly smooth, but not great."
"Overall its a decent winter warmer."
"Overall, this is a good beer, but for a winter warmer its not my cup of tea [beer?] Im looking for a dark, creamy beer for a WW, but I don't feel this beer is really out of style, just not what I look for."
"Reddish copper with a thin, creamy head and a celebratory little bubble show going on. Smells of biscuits, caramel, and roses. My mouth watered as I wrote that. Taste is sharp and spicy up front, then mellows to a warm malt. The end stays a bit sharp, just a hint metallic. The mouthfeel is soft and tingly, just like I like my women. The drinkability is very good, the dry notes make me want more."
"Thanks Exiled!"
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, it's a solid beer overall but there are other beers in the style that I would choose first."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a small head that leaves moderate lacing. The appearance is amber and clear. The aroma is a little spicy and malty. The taste is sweet malt and mild hop bitterness with a little spice, perhaps coriander. The feel is light bodied with a bit of a sour finish. This is a nice local choice for me."
"drinkability much better this time. actually this is the best Saint Arnold beer i'ver had."
"for a cask the head was a bit disappointing. a very bright smelling winter warmer of apple fruit and pineapple citrus candy quality. palate was mild and exactly that. body wise for a cask it was flat. not much of a voluminous quality. not much of a expanded malt woodiness... which was in part because the beer didn't have much of a bitter sweet finish. it was just mainly the fruitiness. quite easy going down. but not a winter warmer of choice."
"D: It's ok on drinkablity. Can't really detect any alcohol flavor. It tastes ok, but comparing it to other christmas releases I'd have to say it is just average."
"Notes: A solid drinking winter seasonal with good spice flavor and hop profile. However, nothing stands out to me, just above average all around."
"D-Very drinkable indeed. I highly suggest this beer to any beer lover. I can't believe it took me this long to try this beer."
"Pours burnt orange with a minimal white head. The smell is malty sweetness, with a little bit of unidentifiable spices. The flavor is more malt, possibly biscuit malt, with a strong aftertaste of spices such as cloves. There is more in there, I just can't tell exactly what it is. Nothing about this beer really stands out, but it is a very easy drinking, lighter winter warmer with no trace of the 7 percent alcohol. Nice beer."
"This Christmas ale improves significantly as it warms, delivering a sweet, dried fruit note on the front that gives way to soft spices, pale malts, gingerbread, and a hoppy, piny finish. The medium body is crisp and peppery on the palate, with an uppity carbonation level that livens up the mouthfeel. Overall, Saint Arnold's Christmas Ale delivers on what it promises--a solid beer to accompany the mildly chilly winter nights in Texas. Reminds me of a toned-down version of Great Lakes' Nosferatu...not the most drinkable, but good."
"drinkability: sessionable yes, and affordable, but there are a few other holiday ales that are just a little more my style."
"burnt orange. thin eggshell head. smell is cloves with cherries, dark fruits, maybe a slight hint of cinnamon or some other earthiness. taste is spicy, with many tastes going on. there is cinnamon in the taste, coriander, maybe some nutmeg in the finish. has a bready quality to it, some maltiness to give it a bit of backbone against spiced nature. mouthfeel finishes dry and it is a bit sticky upfront. tongue even feels a bit strange like one had just had cinnamon or nutmeg. overall, i'd say this suffers from a lack of simplicity. there is just too much going on in this beer. maybe time would mellow this one out."
"Quite interesting! had not expected this beer for a Christmas ale, because I had expected darker, but this was definitely refreshing."
"D: Christmas in July! Heavens no, hell yes!!!"
"D: It's an enjoyable winter warmer. Well done, St. Arnold, this is the best beer I've had from you guys yet."
"Consumed at my cellar temperature, low Sixties, and not recommended mid-Fifties. Bonus in trade from a generous Texas trader. Like a Belgium, with a good mix of malts. Alcohol aroma. Pours medium body and significant white head. Yeasty taste, very drinkable indeed. Above average mouthfeel."
"Pours a reddish brown with a soapy tan head that dissipates quickly but leaves some thick lace. Smells mildly of some spice (yeast spiciness, not literal spice -I don't think they added anything to it), a sweet caramel-like something, and piney hops. Theres a piney, sticky hop flavor when you first sip it followed by some big malty sweetness. There is, as is typical for a winter warmer, there's a good amount of hop bitterness in the finish. At seven percent this isn't the biggest warmer around, but you can definitely feel it. I was a little worried about freshness when I found some dusty six packs in the liquor store, but the alcohol and hops have held this one up well."
"taste is nice - but nothing that is wow-ing. medium body - malty and crips. cracked pepper in there. struggling to get much out of this. mouthfeel and drinkability is nice, but taste itself is very average."
"A malty, yet with a touch of hops, brew that serves as a nice winter warmer."
"Not bad. The doughy sweetness and spicy nature of the hops used really made this stand out as a decent Christmas beer. Despite the lack of depth to the body, this still stayed fairly quaffable."
"Drinks pretty easy for the style/ABV, a nice winter warmer that is going down well on a cold March evening, yummy"
"Drinks fine. The ABV is somewhat hidden. Much better as it warms up. Decent enough, just not my bag baby."
"Decent but all in all seems like a slightly stronger version of their brown ale."
"Pretty good for our winters in Texas."
"Fresh piney hop and toasty bitterness are first noticeable along with a sweet caramely malt blast. Finishes off with a bit more bitterness and slight alcohol warming. While this one does not scream winter warmer or christmas ale, it is one of Saint Arnold's better beers and I always throw a sixer or two into the holiday beer mix."
"This was pretty good but there are Christmas ales out there that I enjoy more."
"D- A decent offering, sort of a more powerful amber ale. Certainly not my favorite winter offering, even from SA I'd much rather have the Winter Stout."
"D: Quite drinkable for its strength."
"A pretty good christmas beer."
"This is a fairly spicy winter warmer and a nice cold-weather sipper."
"D - goes down pretty easy for 7% abv."
"Overall, this is a really easy to drink and at 7% I could easily session this beer. It is complex and has a lot of taste to it. I really like this winter beer."
"D - Certainly a drinkable beer. The spices aren't dominant and a fairly dry finish helps increase the consumption factor. I only received one of these via trade and I'm wishing I had at least one or two more to tide me until spring."
"As far as winter warmers go I must say that I have had better. It might be the fact that this has been sitting in my cellar/closet for a few months but to me the taste expressions seem to be muted. Pulled this out because it has been cold this past few days so I felt this was as good a beer selection as any. I have a few more Saint Arnolds from whoneeds8 so I am hoping to get a better understanding of their flavoring after trying the other brews."
"Good beer, tasty, drinkable...but nothing special.For a Christmas Ale, it should have some darker malts, and some outstanding flavors. This is no better than average."
"Pours a murky reddish/brown, very small tan head fades almost instantly, leaves a few stray spots of lacing on the glass. Big malty aromas wafting out the glass, sweet caramel, some gingery spice, and a slight boozy undercurrent. Taste follows the nose, with a touch of cinnamon in the mix...nice. On the heavy end of medium-bodied, some lingering spice and bitterness. A nice Winter Warmer."
"Drinkability- Good drinkability, I could definately sit and have a few of these back to back."
"so I don't normally go out of my way to find christmas ales. Some are great but I've been dissapointed as well. This one I enjoyed as it hand a nice vanilla / caramel note which I found tasty in a 12oz serving. 115 reviews as of this writing so I'll leave the expansive review format for today. worth a try."
"Drinkability: Well-balanced and remarkably easy to drink considering the ABV percentage. A fine, end-of-the-year brew from St. Arnold."
"Taste and feel is creamier than anticipated which is a bit strange considering how decently hopped this beer is. Honey, toffee, nutty, clove, nutmeg that rounds out a pretty unexpected blanket of complexity for this beer. The malt aspect of this beer is pretty bitter and almost matches the hop bitterness, really enjoy what is going on here in terms of spice, sweetness and bitterness. Everything thing is here and all represented equally they all blend together nicely but can be picked apart just as well if you want to. My glass is disappearing pretty quickly, alcohol is well hidden and makes for an easy drinking brew."
"pours up a reddish amber color with a quickly fading tan head. great lacing. the nose is malts, candied raisins, a wee bit boozy (not much though). the taste is dark fruits, raisins, malts, subtle spices, candy sugar, a crisp hop balance in the finish, kinda like a Sherry beer or something like that. light to medium bodied, low smoothe carbo, a nice sessionable Winter Warmer."
"Good stuff. Glad I was granted the opportunity to try this on cask during a recent visit to the Lone Star State."
"Pours amber-gold with an off white thick head that lingers for a while. Lacing is ok. Smell of roast malts, but not much else. Taste is about as bland. There's just not a good warming effect from this winter warmer. The mouthfeel is also a little too carbonated. It's a decent beer, very drinkable. But just not all that."
"MK"
"12 ounce bottle received as an extra from MiguelMandigo, thanks Michael, poured into a pint glass, consumed 12/2/08, reviewed from notes, color was a dark brownish orange, 3/4 inch bubbly off white head that did not last long, weak retention and lacing, smell had spciy hops, bread, sweetness, caramel, toffee, and roasted malts, flavor had some mild dryness at first, chewy caramel in the middle, light spice and bready malt in the finish, got sweeter as it warmed, spice comes out more by the end, mouthfeel was slightly spicy and sweet, also dry at first, medium bodied, good level of carbonation, does not linger long, could drink a few bottles of this, tasted good on a cold night, not heavy on the stomach and ABV is hidden, worth trying"
"D- Great beer, very well rounded. I could do with a bit more spice though."
"There's a really heavy mouthfeel to the beer, which kind of limits the drinkability too. The butterscotch flavor really comes out when it hits close to room temperature, and is a tad cloying. Definitely a sipper."
"Pours a clear copper with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Little lacing. Smells of sweet, almost syrupy malt. Reminiscent of a barley wine. The taste is similar, but the malt is less dominant and hop bitterness comes through. Slight date and banana esters. A bit of alcohol burn at the end. Mouthfeel is nothing special. A bit on the syrupy side. Decent overall."
"D - Since there is nothing at all offensive about it, it is a very drinkable beer."
"Verdict: Whenever I check the beer aisle, I always check to see if it's time for the next Saint Arnold seasonal to come out. Christmas Ale is just another great reason to be on the lookout. Nicely balanced malt and spice, with a good splash of booze, it's a proper winter warmer. Well worth picking up, especially at the bargain prices you see here in the Houston area."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy off white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some spice. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, with some spice. Medium body, you can feel the warmth from this brew. Drinkable, a very nice winter warmer."
"Drinkability: Overall an interesting and tasty beer. Not quite as ""warming"" as some other winter warmers, but that doesn't take much away. Would be great for Thanksgiving or Christmas (duh)."
"D- You can drink two or three of these over the course of a night, but anymore than that might be a little too tough to swallow."
"Pours into the glass a brown colored body. Has a dark malty aroma. A sweet taste - with some grapes, raisins, and some fruitiness. Has a dark fruit taste. Also, it does have a strong alcohol taste to it. Sweet spices. Very tasty brew."
"I'm looking forward to some great winter warmers this year, and if even half of them are this good, I won't be disappointed."
"D: This is actually fairly drinkable for a christmas beer because the spice is nicely in check."
"D= A very drinkable ale, and one that let's you know the alcohol is there without hitting you over the head with it."
"Thanks to ballewblake for the opportunity to try this one. 12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured a translucent copper with a one inch loose, off-white head the sizzled and popped around the edges as it slowly receded. Concentric half bands of lacing coated the side of the glass. Nose is sweet and bready with a hint of spice (perhaps nutmeg) and caramel. Taste follows nose with a little bit of hops revealed. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a mild, consistent effervescence throughout the background. A little slickness also detected in the consistency. Excellent drinkability for the style. Elements of the winter warmer are expressed without being cloying and overwhelming. An easy drinking representation of the style."
"A bit too carbonated for my taste. Interesting combination of hop and spice."
"My glass is looking pretty sad now, but I have to fight off the urge to grab another. After two of these I can definitely tell I've been drinking."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer at all - pretty mild, but with good spice notes, good malt notes, a nice expressive, crisp body, and well-hidden alcohol. Give it a shot!"
"Thanks to ballewblake for this one."
"D - Excellent cool weather beer but I also enjoy it through out the summer as well."
"nice beer. i would like to drink it again soon."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark orange, almost red, thin off white head forms, settles quickly to a thin ring around the glass, no lacing. Smell is quite sweet at first, caramel and honey, a sharp citrus twinge, like grapefruit rind, some fruit, bit of a biscuity dryness, light spicing, smells okay. Taste is nice, very caramelized, like bread pudding, biscuits, grainy, brown sugar, very malty, kind of frosted mini wheats and brown sugar like, like bit of floral and spicing in the finish, light alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, nice and drinkable. When it warms up its quite nice, not over the top spicy or sweet for a winter warmer, thanks Greg!"
"Anyhow nice primer for when it cools down and I can break out all the winter warmers!"
"Cheers to SA!"
"Poured in to chalice, dark amber with a one finger off white head. This is the summer release of the brew, love it on draught in the winter. Really light malts and hops in the smell, very mild aromas. Taste is great after working on the house for a few hours, really digging the mild spices and malt balance. A good year round xmas brew thats super easy to drink."
"Interesting beer, even more so when I am trying it for the first time in 100 degree heat."
"D: Definitely drinkable, I look foward to having more in the fall and winter when the Texas weather turns cooler."
"Quite an interesting beer to drink in the summertime -- when it's 105 outside. A nice break from the hop monsters that I usually crave in the summer."
"Thanks to turbine2475 for including this beer in a trade and giving me a chance to try it. Pours chestnut with little head but a swirly cap once it settles. Smells of honey, nougat, orange, light spice, and a bit bready. The taste is a bit spritzy, there is more breadiness, a good bit of sweet malt, figs, sweet orange, pear, mace, and maybe some clove and anise on the finish. Fairly complex. The mouthfeel is a bit thick and it is a tad overcarbonated, but it is also nicely creamy and full. This is a decent winter sipper, and I'm glad I got a chance to try it."
"D-Nice job overall. A nice, solid brew. Nothing screams out for attention and the beer is an entire body of work that works nicely together."
"A very good winter warmer, or in this case, a cool spring night warmer ;) Would love to have more of this"
"Does not age very well."
"Overall, I would have to say this was a really nice beer. I am not sure the style, but a Christmas porter would probably fit the bill. Sure, there are better ones out there, but this was still solid and I would in no way turn it down if I say it again."
"D - I think this is a good winter warmer brew it helps make it feel like winter while drinking it in Texas"
"Clear copper pour with an offwhite head. Metallic toffe malt aroma with a hint of spice as well. Taste is light toffee flavored malt again, with a light note of spices coming into the flavor as well and a light bitterness. Slightest hint of alcohol shows, but still very drinkable. Decent beer all around, but just not my favorite style."
"D - Malty and smooth brew that is very welcoming and a good addition to any fridge."
"I would stock up on this beer and try to keep some on hand year round. Its a good price for a strong very above average beer."
"Pours a bright, crystal clear dark golden/amber with some red highlights when held to the light. Has a fluffy white head and lots 'o lacing. Beautiful color! Aroma is of caramel malts, and some nondescript spices. Taste is weak caramel malt and some grapefruit. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Not a bad brew, could use some more malt and a bit more body. Didn't really notice the 7%abv."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 2"" beige head over the clear orangey amber brew. Thick head holds steady, with heavy coating lace. Aroma is minimal, with light spicing evident. Taste is average, again with spicing the only real standout characteristic. Mouthfeel is a bit on the harsh aide, and drinkability is kind of limited by all of the above. Winter warmers are not usually my favorite style, and this one seems to fit into that mold. Your mileage may vary."
"This would be a good introduction to the style for someone not familiar with the style, but it's a little watered down for my taste. If I was looking for the flavors of the winter warmer but a bit lighter, this would be the way to go. Maybe a Fall Warmer?"
"D: very crisp, not too complicated, but enjoyable nonetheless"
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. Saint Arnolds has done it again, with this winter seasonal, they still amaze me at how good the beers are. This poured an amber color with a foamy white 2-finger head that left a decent amount of lacing down the glass. The smell of this beer is of malts and a hint of spice, probably nutmeg. The taste of this beer is somewhat spiced, maybe cinnamon and nutmeg, but has a malt characteristic to it also. The mouthfeel is very light and fluffy. Overall a very drinkable beer. And one of my favorite seasonals to come out of the Saint Arnolds brewery."
"D: Probably my favor winter warmer... still something I'd only want a few times around the holidays."
"Pours a clear bronze with a tan head that dies completely. Smells sweet, candies with a little spice. Tastes of sweet malt, a little fruity with a spicy finish. Medium and smooth in the mouth with the perfect amount of carbonation. Very drinkable and delicious."
"Looks like a nice IPA, wonderful clear copper with an easily provoked head that is slow to settle to a fine layer that leaves minimal rings as it progresses down the glass. Smells like sweet malt (DME) and piney hops. The taste is basically the same but in opposite order with some alcohol at the end. I am not a huge fan of the malty sweetness, it tastes like the final gravity is too high. Aside from the alcohol warmth at the tailend I wouldn't really consider this a ""winter warmer."" The mouthfeel is pleasant. As it warms and opens up a caramel nuttiness is discernable in the aftertaste. Its not a bad beer but doesn't represent the style very well."
"Not really recommended, but not too bad (can't say too much negative about it)."
"At first, it was hard for me to detect some characteristics of this beer, but as time goes on I can make out more and more. This is a very enjoyable beer. A really good Winter Warmer. Something I highly recommend."
"D: This is an excellent seasonal offering from Saint Arnold. Highly impressed, especially considering that I was a bit disappointed in their O-fest. According to their website, this is an ""old ale", which I was actually just introduced to several months ago, and I really like the style. This beer literally tastes like Christmas! All of the good spices are there. At the same time, it has a nice malty backbone to keep everything in check. Perfect ABV, as it's warming, but not too strong so you can have a few. I am already starting to get into the winter brews this season, and this will definitely be one I drink many more times. If you are in Texas and like a good cold-weather brew, do yourself a favor and give this one a try."
"Saint Arnold belongs in the discussion of overrated brewers. i wished this stuff was distributed in Ct. hmmm... incentive to move to Texas though!"
"Christmas in July! This Christmas Ale seems to take a slightly different tack than many. It has a reddish brown hue with little head that eventually disappears. The aroma is heavily accentuated with spruce and spice (primarily nutmeg and allspice) and these flavours dominate the palate too. The beer also has some slight hops to the finish. A good beer, but I think it makes a better drink during the winter."
"I know . . it's weird that I am reviewing a Christmas Ale in April, but anyways, it poured a great amber color with little lacing and a decent head with tight bubbles. The smell is bready and light. The taste however lacks character but I find to be very accessable and creamy. This is a Christmas Ale that would be greatly enhanced with more spice or citrus, but is an excellent beer to have at the house when guests are over and anyone could cozy up to."
"D - this is a pretty good Xmas seasonal. It's got some nice spice with warming ABV perfect for the holiday season. It took me a while to really enjoy it but once I was able to taste the spicy hops and maltiness I was quite pleased, or maybe it was the ABV that got me."
"D - A pretty good beer. I wouldn't mind keeping this on stock for a while, but that was my last one."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Almost no head, fizzles away too quickly even after holding the bottle several inches above the glass. The smell is promising but unfortunately the taste doesn't quite deliver. I expect a little more out of a seasonal ale such as this. It definitely has a little bit of spice one should find in the style but not enough. Too much of the pervasive caramel, slickness off the tongue that one gets from St. Arnold's beers. I've got a couple left in the fridge but they're not calling my name!"
"drinkability is good. alcohol is a little warm (perfect for a winter warmer) but this is a nice solid beer."
"On tap at BJ's, also at Molly's, but I have a good many bottles at home. Rich brownish red color, nice fine head (flufs more from the bottle, but probably the bartender). I want to say I can smell spices and definitely the malt - not much for hop, which is good here. Goes down smooth and creamy, better than most christmas ales. I could sip this all night, at least until the 7.3% ABV did me in."
"Overall impression: A decent christmas beer - typical flavors you would expect this time of year."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no date into pint glass. Was a solid amber color with a small head that faded to a thin wisp for the remainder. Smell was weak with sweet malt blending well with spicy from the hops. Mouthfeel was pretty standard. Overall was a decent beer and worth trying. (3, RB, T,O)"
"this is a fun beer to drink.anything with the name christmas in it cant be all bad.nice creamy head moderate lacing done the glass.comes in a screw top top for ease in opening.not a advantage to the home brewer.nice floral aroma and nice hoppy flavor.taste good perfect for the holidays."
"It might not be the best night for me to review this brew, but I like it."
"Overall, just didn't do it for me. Too malty (appropriate for style though), overly spiced, and too flat."
"This one is a little too spicy for me. Among the spiciness are some bittersweet flavors."
"Quite different from what I remember, having it on tap, but it grosses me out just the same."
"I was not impressed with past tastes of St. Arnolds a few years ago, but I'm glad I gave this one a try. It might be one of my favorite Christmas ales. The only thing I would change is maybe add a bit of spice to the mix (like Sierra Nevada does)"
"Very tasty - I am impressed. The fruit and noticeable alcohol leaves Christmas Ale delightfully smooth and thick. I would very much like to be warmed by it on a cold winter day."
"Drinkability; easy to drink winter time brew. I really enjoyed it. It's weird that this brew is out now. It's not quite winter yet."
"So, I'm visiting family in Houston and I see this in the local Kroger. I don't know when this comes out, but winter beers haven't appeared in Maine yet. Maybe when the humidity drops below 100% it's considered winter in Houston. Anyway, I'm glad this beer was available. It was a reddish/brown color with a medium off-white head. It had a malty aroma and a nice, kicky spice flavor. I had a few of these with some beef fajitas, and they went well together."
"Pours a dark orange or reddish brown with an off white head. Initally 1.5"" head the quickly recedes to a ring and a thin film on top. Aroma is malty sweetness and fruits. The malty sweetness is the dominant flavor, hop bitterness and alcohol balance it out. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Because of the sweetness and high alcohol, this wouldn't make a good session beer, one is enough. This is probably my favorite of Saint Arnold's beers."
"Ok, this beer is incredibly sweet, almost puckeringly so. There is an intense raspberry tartness that sits on the tongue while other sugars creep up to ""fuel the fire."" A light chocolate flavor in the finish is there to tug the reigns and tame this beast. The mouthfeel is interesting, because it feels like I'm taking a bite of a really rich dessert chocolate. Something so rich that it's good in small doses, but 12 ounces is a little too much for me."
"The beer has a nice heft to it as it rests on the palate. Not too heavy, but enough that the beer sticks just a bit to the mouth. The beer is not nearly as malty sweet as I would have guessed from the aroma, instead it has a rich maltiness to it that while not sweet is fairly substantial. In the finish is a nice, though light, herbal bitterness and a lingering suggestion of toasted malt. Solid notes of toffee and caramel combine with a hint of oxidation; all of which contribute to the nice malt character of this beer. Despite the heft of this beer it seem a bit thin, it just seems to disappear from my tastebuds faster than I would expect. Something just seems to be missing here, for some reason I am expecting a richness to this brew that is just not here. It is enjoyable though, and I definitely would not turn down another go at this beer."
"Probably the toughest of the seasonals to track down. Great smell for a winter warmer, really put me in the mood from the get go. The taste had a little bit of sweetness, but what struck me the most was the overwhelming strength of the beer. This will certainly keep you warm on a cold Christmas night"
"Overall this beer is decent but nothing too special, especially given the other options that spring up around the holidays."
"Pours a brilliant clear red, with a so-so head. Aroma is fruity, some malts, and no spices that I pick up. Taste is minerally, some hops and some malts there, an okay balance there. Mouthfeel is good, not great. A very drinkable beer, reminds me of a mineral water overall."
"Overall, a very nice brew. A good one from sipping by the fire on a cold Christmas Eve. I'm going to save some of these bottles to see if a year in the cellar makes this ale even better."
"This is one of the better christmas beers i've ever had. i really liked it. i had it on tap at a bar in dallas and i think it is great. i also had it in the bottle, where its not quite as good. if its poured enough, you can get a great brew. you should really try it. its not too spicy, although you can clearly taste the spices in the beer. its not overwhelming. it is very drinkable, which is key here. most christmas beers make me wanna puke after about four. not here. this one has a great head and overall great color. check it out if your in texas."
"Overall Impression: So drinkable, I believe I could drink my body weight in this beer and still want more. If youre lucky enough to see it, I dont think I can recommend it strongly enough. Great job St. Arnolds!"
"I was fortunate enough to sample a year-old Winter Stout on-tap at a brewery tour this Saturday. The color is dark brown with ruby highlights. Head is light brown and has good retention. The aroma is of sweet, dark malts with hints of coffee. Taste has a full-on sweet, roasted malt flavor. Coffee and chocolate flavors play a big part in this beer. Roast flavor is also in the mix. The finish has a strong malt flavor with touches of dark fruit and just a hint of alcohol. This aged version is notably better than the bottled version I remember from last year, the flavor is much fuller and nuanced. Thanks to Saint Arnold for the opportunity to sample an aged version of this brew."

"Opinion: This is a really nice beer, and I believe it to be one of Saint Arnolds finest...if its not their best one. I enjoy drinking this beer not only because it is a quality brew, but also Brock (the owner of Saint Arnold brewery) is a really great guy...and I enjoy supporting his efforts."
"A fine addition to ones Saint Nick beer stein."
" Another great one from South Texas."
"I really enjoyed this beer and could easily recommend to my friends. This beer is a nice example of a Christmas beer that is not too complex or complicated. It is one nice drinking experience."
"Lots of people really like this beer. I appreciate it, I would love to find it on tap went I go out to eat. Just doubt I will ever find myself picking up a six pack. Thanks go to Kindestcut for the bottle."
"Not bad, but really didn't give me what I wanted in a Christmas beer."
"A malty sweet aftertaste leaves me wanting more. A good beer and I can see why this would be classified as a ""winter warmer"". Thanks again to HardTarget for hooking me up with this nice brew."
"In my opinion, Saint Arnold's best. Too bad it's not available year round. Very smooth, but with just enough spice to make it interesting. Warms you up nice in cold weather, and really evokes the holidays from the label to the last drop. Excellent every year from an extremely underrated brewery."
"This beer is a gorgeous, clear mahogany. The head is small, tan/cream. Sweetish front with some grains and a little milk gone bad. Sweet fruit and floral hops in the front; strawberry ice cream and chocolate in the middle; dark grains and more floral hops in the sourish finish. There's a bit of a strange, deep chocolate and fruit combination going on. I can't quite put my finger on the taste, but it's not really pleasant."
"Acquired via trade. Pours a pretty reddish-brown with a medium beige head that lasted pretty well. Decent lacing. Sweetly spiced aroma with a hint of malt as well. Very smooth mouthfeel, with flavors of sherry, malt, and spice. Mild alcohol flavor in the finish. A great winter warmer!"
"many thanks to Beer Angel for sending this up my way!!"
"Thisone came to me out of Texas,so im not up-to-speed on st.arnolds brews. This one poured a clear deep amber with a very short-lived head. I mean it dies to nothing with no lace to be had. Some reviews read it takes a look of ice tea and I agree. The aroma and taste are of toasted malt, husk & grain. It was slightly sweet with a hint of a caramel tone. For a holiday brew I expected a little more bells than thisone rang."
"Thanks to Beer Angel for the opportunity!"
"This fact that this was a refreshing Christmas brew made the experience kinda fun. Unlike most other winter seasonals this wasn't a thick, black, hoppy assault. The beer was much more balanced than most, even approaching malty. This wasn't a bad thing, only different and unexpected. I guess they don't need the ""winter warmer"" types of beer in TX."
"Thanks to Beer Angel, a welcome receipt as part of the Beer It Forward !"
"Nice coppery brown with fleeting white head. Nice dry malt nose with prominent but not overpowering spice (sorry, but I'm bad at identifying spices) but it'ssomething in pumpkin pie (nutmeg?). The flavor is more of the same plus some brown sugar and it's fairly dry. After a few sips it the flavor fades and becomes a bit bland and suffers from lack of malt background. It's not bad but there's better winter beers out there."
"Like the rest of the SA brews, Christmas is a showcase for the grain bill. The hops perform their duty, but will win no award for their leading performance. I personally like SA Christmas and I respect Brocks vision of a Christmas ale without 60+ IBUs, but I have a hard time with the dog food aspects"
"Pours a medium copper color with a thin white head. Aroma is sweet malts and grains with a touch of fruit. Nice taste with flavors of toasted grains and spice and a slightly bitter hop finish. A nice winter beer."
"Pours a hazed semi-dark caramel with a very small off-white head. The head disappeared into nothing very quickly. The smell is a lightly sweetened bread and fruity smell with a hint of spices. Taste of toast and roasted malts and spices...perhaps just a hint of cinammon on the tail. Very tasty! This is a fairly light to medium bodied brew and finishes with alcohol and spiced notes. A good offering from Saint Arnold. Cheers!"
"Deep and clear copper-red color with a head that fades away in mere seconds, faint carbonation, a little lace.  Toasty malt aroma and mild alcohol notes with a slight spiciness.  Taste begins with toasted malts, bitter chocolate and coffee notes, followed by sweet berry-like fruit flavors, finishes with mildly bitter, understated hops.  At 7.0% ABV, it packs quite a punch.  A unwaveringly superb winter beer, not to be missed."
"Nice dark-amber color and clarity.   Not much of a head.  Am I the only one that has a problem with St. Arnold's house yeast strain?  I detect it in almost all of their beers --it imparts a kinda funky nose and taste to this otherwise fruity-malty brew, which could also use some hops to balance the flavors better."
