4.15,-4.2,3.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"very few beers can rival this one in terms of complexity and depth, its downright enormous, and is so unique in the corded american strong ale world, i love it. thanks to drlovemd87 for unselfishly sharing yet another bottle of exceptional ale with me. dark auburn in color, syrup textured, dead still, heavily sedimented brew. black cherry color to match its added fruit. intentionally flat, i think maybe the carbonic acid exposure over time on a beer thats meant to be cellared like this one may denature or corrupt some of the fruit character and smoothness, which is why, i presume, they didn't carbonate it. a nose of medicinal cherries, over ripe black cherries, and a whole heaping tone of sweet grain. toffee and coffee and dark chocolate covered dried cherry come out in the flavor, and I'm amazed how little the alcohol shows up. its so thick too, viscous and pushing gelatinous in terms of mouthfeel, but i don't want it to have bubbles. the decadence of the feel makes me inclined to sip on it, rather than hammer it, which allows it to warm up, and man oh man does it warm up beautifully. the grain is never lost, but the cherry is dominant i think, especially at temperature, and especially in the finish. it kind of reminds me of one of those home spun booze infusions with fresh fruit, where you forget about a jug of whiskey for a few decades loaded with plums or something, very grandpa-like. so much texture, its palate coating and increasingly cherry focused as it warms. wonderfully done beer here, like nothing else I've come across in terms of enormity and grace. as much a cordial as it is an ale. wish we could get their beer in colorado, i don't think anyone here does beer quite like this.","StonedTrippin","Jun 30, 2014"

4.7,8.5,3.75,5,4.75,4.25,4.75,"The 2014 vintage is a hit. Very much a beer to sip and contemplate. I'd compare it to a liqueur due to it's puny carb presence but it's much more than a liqueur could ever be. Huge depth of flavor, keen integration of the cherry, barrel, and base beer flavors. It's hard to knock the beer for something that actually may help it stand apart from others. Not many beers are near flat and most that are fail to offer any intrigue, yet Cherry Adam has such sharp, vinous, deep, and rooted flavors that it delivers a near wine-like, spirit hybrid type experience.","MarcWP","May 23, 2014"

The cherries do cover up a little bit of the complexity that Adam has, but at the same time, it contributes a lot to the character of the beer to make it an equally tasty and unique take on the old ale. Would definitely love to try Adam from the Wood now which has to be great, but not going to worry too much about getting my hands on it when I can more easily drink the base Adam.","Stevedore","Mar 23, 2014"

This beer completely blew me away. for some reason I was not expecting it to be this good and just wanted to try one of the many " wood" beers they had available. very happy this was the one we chose. the cherries and barrel aging come though perfectly and are so well balanced. I could have drank this beer all afternoon if it wouldnt put me on the pavement. luckily I work 5 minutes from the place and I plan to visit again this week.","derftron","Jun 13, 2013"
4.07,-6,3.75,4.25,4,4.25,4,"Verdict: A very nice take on Adam, a really solid Old Ale as it is, but one that might have a little too much going on. It has lots of components from the base beer, the cherries and the barrels, but none of them really seem to meld together in harmony. I enjoyed sipping this over the course of nearly an hour, and would do so again, but I'm not convinced this is a better version than the base beer.","kevanb","Jun 12, 2013"

4.23,-2.3,4,4,4.5,3.75,4.25,"Thanks to Tim for opening this for us. The '12 vintage had a much more smokey character than the '11, a little abrasive up front with less sweetness overall, even with the same, big cherry flavors. The booze was also a bit heavier in the '12 and had a solid whiskey-like presence. Overall, I think I liked the '11 better. Smoother and more easily drinking. These could honestly have been two different beers, but they were still both very tasty.","tectactoe","Mar 20, 2013"

2.91,-32.8,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"OVERALL: This was my least favorite of the night. I found the cherry a little too dominant in the 2012 bottle, which somewhat overwhelmed my palate. I actually preferred the more balanced and bourbon barrel forward 2011 version, though I'm not sure if that was a batch difference, a result of aging, or a combination of both. However, the relatively flat feel of the 2011 kind of ruined that one for me as well. In the end, I was happy to try these, especially side-by-side, but it's not one I'd go after again. Much preferred the regular Adam and Adam from the Wood. Cheers again for all the stuff Claaark13. This was a piss load of fun!","Jeffo","Feb 12, 2013"

Plenty of sweetness consisting of molasses, toffee hints of caramel a little booze underlying cherries and signs of vanilla. The cherries were more prominent on the palate with great molasses toffee sweetness, a little caramel, some dark fruit and a little booze.

The 10% is felt but not sensed (also perhaps the result of an empty stomach), which definitely contributes to the drinkability of this one. I'd certainly like to try this one alongside regular Adam from the Wood (though I understand it that that one spends significantly more time barrel-side) to see what influence the cherries have on this one, though I'm happy to read in to their influence wherever I can here.","CrellMoset","Feb 03, 2012"

I would liked to have seen a little head on this, but considering the ABV and the contents, I guess it's just not possible. Aroma heavy with black cherries, raisins, chocolate, booze, bourbon-soaked oak. Taste was equally as big, with a strong boozy sensation right up front, followed by a massive infusing of cherries covered in dark chocolate. Enter mid-palate: raisins and dried fruits, grape skins and sherry, following by a drowning bourbon sensation complimented by the barrel oak. I was surprised at the longevity of the dark chocolate taste. Smooth and heavy mouthfeel, full-bodied; booze is tasted and felt. Well-crafted and delicious!","Rifugium","Jan 21, 2012"

The flavor was of sweet malt, massive cherry, subtle wood, and a hint of sherry. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew.

Cherries and plums melded into an old ale (dark fruit, raisin, fig, leather) perfectly. The cherry flavor isn't subtle, but the whole beer is so smooth and well blended - it is stunning. Not boozy at all. Really brings this around and counteracts the overt earthiness of Adam, adding a bit of sweetness and brightness. Unfortunately, it is basically flat, with a heavy mouthfeel. It comes off like a cordial. A bit too sticky for me. Overall, this beer would be unbelievable with good carbonation. As is, it is quite enjoyable.","seeswo","Aug 18, 2011"

I'm somewhat surprised that the cherry and bourbon flavors are so potent; they don't quite overpower the base beer, but then again, Adam in all its leathery, smoky glory is about as big and badass a base beer as you'll find. I've only had 2 vintages of Cherry Adam, but prefer the smoother integration the 2008. However, the 2009 is tasty stuff, with a luxuriously smooth and lingering finish.

I was just hopin that it was going to be good, I'm assuming the bottle I had was from 2009. It poured out as a dark red color, the head... Was never there. No lacing at all. The smell of the beer was very wine-like. Strong barrel aromas, blended with cherries, and booze. The taste was a little tart but had a complex flavor to it from the cherry to the wood and then some nut flavors in the far background. The mouthfeel was a little watery I thought. A little too much like a red wine. The overall thoughts I had on this beer was that I didn't think it was worth the amount I paid. Sadly I think there are much nicer beers out there other than this for much less. However I am glad that I got to try it. I don't see myself ordering this brew again.","Knapp85","Jun 24, 2011"

The barrels come through with some oak too much not substantially so. There are alot of comparisons to a wine i could make with this actually, but i am not Tomme.

The aroma is cherry and tobacco with some port, some light roastiness, and some pleasant bourbon-y booze. The flavor is moderately sweet with a nice subtle smoke noticeable throughout along with a nice bit of wood and fruity cherry. There is some maple syrup flavor and a nice warming booziness.

Perhaps they use terrible bottle caps that don't hold up well when being shipped, I dunno, but I have to imagine that the brewer doesn't want their beer to be completely absent of carbonation like this is. Perhaps it needs more time in the bottle to condition and get some bubbles? Whatever the case, this would be a winner if it were carbed properly, but right now it's just an interesting, cherry-infused beer syrup. I'll let my other bottle relax in the basement closet for about 6 months and see what happens, but I don't have high hopes.","KeefD","Mar 13, 2011"

Next week when the bottles go on sale the $10 a bottle ($8.33 per if you buy a case) price tag will be the best deal in town.

After 15 months in bourbon and sherry casks though, I am feeling forgiving on the head. A swirl does conjure up some foam and stick some clusters of head along the walls of the glass. The aroma is robust with bourbon, black treacle, brown sugar, tart cherry, oak, sherry, and smoke--no lack of complexity here. The flavor begins with a smokey malt character lightened by tart cherries. Somewhat peppery with a dry bready finish that ends with lingering dark chocolate. Quite a brew. Full bodied with a subdued but present carbonation that is just about right. This beer is quite delicious, more robust than expected and probably better too.

Booze is there in the finish and somewhat lingers without any carbonation to carry it away. Though, this beer is properly carbonated for what it's trying to be. The low carbonation and combination of flavors and booze presence almost create a liqueur quality to the mouthfeel and experience of this beer.

The taste is similar, with bourbon up front, lending vanilla, caramel and light tannins.

Seems to lack a bit of finesse and the flavors / aromas are not quite as integrates as one might hope.

I'm a big fan of HotD Adam to begin with, but this takes it to a whole other level. The cherry really works well with the base beer. When this warms up after a bit, the cherry subsides slightly and the oak, vanilla and the bourbon characteristics really come forward and shine. This is like two completely different beers from start to finish. This is a world class beer once it warms up and starts to flourish. Full and creamy on the mouthfeel. This one coats the mouth with heavenly goodness and you never want to see the glass empty. This one not only lived up to but exceeded my expectations.

Aftertaste is sweet with vanilla beans, leather, and some coffee flavors as well. Full body with a silky smooth feel from the almost non-existant carbonation.

I do have one bottle left to cellar so we'll see how that goes.","ArrogantB","Nov 29, 2008"
4.69,8.3,4,5,5,4.5,4,"5/16/11. Was fortunate enough to sample the 2011 at the tasting room, and then later back home in Owings Mills. Was told the abv. in this excellent beer is now up around 13%, and frankly it shows. Still, this beer has so much flavor (just an incredibly intense flavor of chocolate and cherry), the alcohol is still very much in the background. I should add that the 2011 version is completely still (no appreciable carbonation), which in no way detracts from the enjoyment of this beer. Fantastic stuff...","John_M","Nov 28, 2008"
4.55,5.1,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"Poured from 12oz bottle into Delirium Tremens snifter. Pours a dark murky opaque brown with purplish red hue with little head. Smell is a whiff of red wine similar to syrah with spicy red fruits mixed with darkfruits and hint of spice from the oak. Taste is still sweetness of heavy malt and carmel chocolate coffee, followed by the cherry's sweet semi tart flavor intermixed with vanilla oak and portish sherry flavors. Alcohol while well hidden is still apparent in a port like presences. I like the low carbonation on the beer at times but believe that a slighty increased CO2 level would of increased both mouthfeel and drinkability. However this is minor to how stellar this beer is and I think that it should age nicely.","sfoley333","Nov 24, 2008"

4.42,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours with a larger head this time, with better retention. The flavors have blended together nicely over the nearly nine months since I last had this. Chocolate notes have come out and they blend very nicely with the bourbon and cherries. Notes of vanilla and a prominent smokiness have become apparent as well. The booze has died down a bit without losing any of the nice bourbon and cherry notes. The carbonation has increased slightly, providing a fuller mouthfeel which is decidedly chalky at times. This is coming along nicely.","HopHead84","Nov 15, 2008"
