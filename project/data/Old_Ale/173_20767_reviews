"Extremely dark in appearance and rich in flavor but poured completely flat, and the booze is very forward on the tongue."
""
"Hot & boozy. Notes of coco, soy, and earthy dried fruit (plums & apricots). Not really my thing, but gotta respect what it is & how it was made."
""
""
""
""
""
"2014 version.  Flat (as stated on the bottle) but amazing smell and flavor.  Great beer."
""
""
"Great, but normal Adam is just so good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It says it's flat and it is. However, that has no impact on flavor and is damn delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Just didn't seem to have a great flavor.  Nothing stood out for me."
""
""
"Lack of carb in this really killed it for me."
""
""
""
""
"I prefer the base Adam.  The barrel just added basic wood notes and detracted from the overall taste."
"2011 release. Hair of the Dog when they're on point."

"Bottle: Poured a murky dark brown color ale with zero carbonation. Aroma of tobacco, bourbon, light vanilla and molasses is quite singular. Taste is also dominated by tobacco with some molasses and bourbon notes clearly identifiable. Residual sugars are also easily identifiable with light warming alcohol. Body is quite full with almost zero carbonation. This is almost like drinking an old sherry or xeres and makes for a perfect nightcap."
""
""
"The lack of carbonationis not a big issue and I thought it would be. The complexities of the beer linger and the medium plus to full mouthfeel make up for the lack of carbonation."

"Way too sweet, sickeningly so!  Unfinished fermentation?"
"draft @ HotD.   big beer, though not hot.  bourbon really changes the base beer, tobacco and smoke are gone, not huge on bourbon flavor tho.. it just smoothes everything out. Terrific"

"O- If you read this, heed my advice: don't bother letting this get too cold, as it must be had warm. Unless, of course, you enjoy muted flavors and a thin mouthfeel. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and am eager to try the cherry variant."
"This is wonderful. It's meaty yet sweet like dessert. But it's not cloyingly sweet as the oak really drys out the finish. I think the lack of carbonation is what gives the impression that the beer is sweet since there are no scrubbing bubbles to clean the palate. I love the aroma, enjoy the flavors, and would be ecstatic to have this around all the time. I still think I prefer Cherry Adam though."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is outstanding, very glad demand was down and I got several bottles. This will be fun to revisit the next few years."

"Verdict: I liken this to something like a tawny port wine, a very fine one at that, but with so many flavorful and complex oak aged beers on the market, this just doesn't seem to match up with a flat body. I definitely enjoyed sipping on this over the course of an evening and it was a lovely after dinner beer, but the potential for true greatness slipped past this one."

"Drink- I pretty much made a trip to PDX for this and I am glad I did."

"Overall, this is just about the most magnificent beer I have ever tasted. Very unique, and crazy delicious. Beyond World-class."

"O: One of the best beers out there. Its got that undeniably Hair of the Dog quality and takes it close to the apex. Even the flat 2014 batch beats out most other big barrel aged beers for me, although it is of course better with carb on tap or from 2011. Superb!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"d - delicious and decadent. A beer for an ocassion"
"Overall- Great beer. Really solid. Definitely worth a try. Is it 20 bucks good- I'm not sure but probably not."

"Outstanding beer, though no surprise to anyone. Worth it if you're ever in Portland."
""
""
"O- Complex, interesting, but too sweet for my taste. Alcohol hit well hidden. It's tight like a three year barrel aged beer should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good stuff, but not what I was hoping for. It's flat, and that's problematic, as it's a heavy beer and it ends up feeling sludgy. Also, the flavors are potent and varied, but not to the degree that I'd like. Don't get me wrong, this is a really good beer. But, IMO, it's not on the level (at least at 2 years) of many of my favorites. HotD Matt, for example, has much better barrel integration and is just a much better beer. I even like the regular Adam better than this one."
"Overall: Adam from the Wood is an outstanding barrel aged old ale and had it not been for the little bit of oxidization in the flavour, I am quite sure that it would have been in my all time top 5 beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Glad to finally get a chance to try this beer and see what everyone has been raving about. No wonder people love it. As good as it is, though, I still prefer Matt just a bit, as it's slightly more complex, yet even more drinkable, or at least as drinkable as any 10% ABV old ale could dream to be. No matter, Adam from the Wood is fantastic, and I need to keep my hunting spears ready when the next batch is (hopefully) released."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer, and I am happy to have had it. A big beer that doesn't get carried away with sweetness, and incredibly smooth, both in terms of flavor and feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fuller medium body, softer carbonation, chewy and soft on the tongue. Holy crap, these barrel-aged HotD beers are seriously out of this world. Between the Cherry Adam and this I was reeling, immediately fawning all over the place, telling people how great it was. Complex, warm and explosively flavorful. I want more."

"Adam from the Wood is a world-class beer. Its one of my favorites from Hair of the Dog!"
""
"OVERALL: This was excellent. It's definitely barrel heavy, but the interplay between barrel and base beer works here, with enough leather and smoke from Adam to make an impact. A really good barrel aged ale that lived up to my already high expectations. Would definitely drink this again. Cheers Claaark13!"

"O: Most excellent. Super complex and smooth. This would age very nicely. Thanks again Brian."
""
"I also had this this past weekend thanks to Mike. The above review still holds."
"I would highly recommend NOT aging this since it is A) already so old, B) is slightly red wine and port tart so may gain acidity, C) is already delicious, D) can really only gain more of an old/oxidized character. 1/31/2012 8/3/8/4/16=3.9"
""
"Bottle thanks to my 2011 SecretSanta. Dark, hazy brown pour, red highlights with no real head. Aroma contains strong bourbon notes, vanilla, lots of sweet malty port like aromas as well, dark fruits, woody, multi layered and complex. Traditional tobbaco notes, very ashy. Taste is sweet, dark fruits, fruity with a lot of vanilla/bourbon and tobacco, slightly boozy finish. Palate is heavy, low carbonation, warming alcohol finish which makes it even more decadent. Really nice sipper."
"12 oz bottle generously shared by mrfootstones. Thanks Brian. Pours a cola brown with a small white head that settles to a ring and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is lots of bourbon, oak, and caramel. There is also some smoke, a bit of tobacco, and quite a bit of alcohol. The taste is very sweet with lots of bourbon, some plum, and a hint of cherry. There is also lots of caramel, some vanilla, a bit of leather, and a light smokiness. The finish is quite boozy with lingering sweetness. Full Body. Low carbonation. Enjoyable, but I could not drink much of this."
"o - ovearll, really enjoyable. great beer and very much worthy of the hype it receives. i've had this one before and remembered digging it a bit more the first time around, but still an incredibly impressive beer. my favorite of the three."
""
"Overall amazing...I love regular adam so this beer more than lives up to the hype for me"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The palate opens bourbon-forward, mildly apple like with vanilla, oak and alcohol. The mid-palate is chewy, smoky, leathery and with a tobacco character that's awesome enough to make me want a pipe, this beer is a treat. Brash but harmonious, this beer is full in body, medium-low in carbonation and mildly boozy on the finish with mild vanilla and oak tannins, this is exceptionally good. Lives up to the hype IMO."
""
"My only complaint: I wish there was more Adam below the bourbon. Great blend though. Very rich; a beer for sipping."
"I had this side-by-side with the Matt, and this was clearly the lesser of the two (although that's comparing something to near-perfection). This was sharper, crisper and harsher. But there's no doubting the complexity and scope of both these beers. They are truly impressive examples of the craft."
"Overall: I really liked this beer, and while it's a 4.5 on my rating, I'd say it's closer to a 4.75. What a great treat from Barry, which was definitely appreciated in December 2011 when he gave me the bottle, but even more tonight when I drank it. ISO more bottles!"
""
""
""
"O- Really complex and another great sipper from HotD. Would love to get another bottle and age it for a year or two."
"Carbonation is a bit high but the flavors meld wonderfully and this beer is a sublime sipper. As a lover of the base beer, I am pleasantly giddy with this incantation. A must seek for sure. If you don't like this beer, please bm me and I'd be happy to work something out with you."
"o - Overall I thought this was a really nice beer. The nose was a little old and boozy, but that booze didn't come through much in the taste. It is a sweet beer but a good one. Would like to have it again."
"Pours a burnished deep brown, thin ring of head around the edge of the glass, nary any head, sans dissipation, no visible carbonation. A truly complex nose, the light charring of the barrels produces a clean wood character to go along with the ever-present Adam leather and smoke notes, much more subtle than the base beer. Taste is equally complex, leather, smoke, some vanilla, raisins, a bit of chocolate, brown sugar, hops are a secondary partner in this ultra-complex beer of the gods. Mouthfeel is medium, not much in the way of effervescence. One of the best beers on Earth, period. Well done Alan!"
"3, 4, 4, 3, 4"
"My favorite Hair of the Dog to date, and I'm a big, big fan of the brewery."
""
"Edit - A revisit of the same batch at HotD's brewpub confirms that this is some stellar shit."
""
""
"O: This brew absolutely lives up to the hype. One of the best I've ever had in any style, and totally unique. Seek it out."
"A special and unique beer once again from HotD."
"O- Nice beer but not out of this world. Enjoyed it but probably fell victim to the hype. Good bourbon character."
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle (2011 vintage) into snifter glass. Pours dark brown with a small light brown head that lasted decently throughout. The aroma holds coconut/vanilla from the wood, dark chocolate, dark bread, earth, tobacco, wet leather, soy, figs, prunes, raisins, and a touch of old hops reminiscent of the regular Adam old ale. Robust and oxidized nose. The flavor is medium sweet, medium bitter and light acidic with notes of vanilla, coconut, wood, caramel, dark sugar, dark fruits, leather, tobacco, earth, dark bread, chocolate, earthy licorice, light citrus and a touch of soy. The mouthfeel is rounding, soft and sticky with a light carbonation. Vinous and complex finish. Medium-bodied. Overall, a very nice old ale. Didn’t blow anything out of the water for me. I will not go at great length for this brew anymore and stick with the more accessible Adam which is one of my favorites for the style."
"Overall: I strongly suggest trying this at some point it is one of the best old ales I have ever had. I personally prefer the Cherry adam to this one but this is one is still exceptional"
"Pours a murky dark brown with a tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, molasses, citrus zest, dark fruit, and bourbon. Taste is the same with some slight leather, tobacco, and ash flavors. This beer has a very low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a very nice set of complex aromas."
"Overall a fantastic beer. Great all around. Easy to drink actually. "
"2011 vintage, courtesy of classroom13, thanks Sean! Adam from the Wood pours a medium bodied cola brown in color with a one finger, creamy light beige head. It looks perfect and the creamy head stayed for the entirety of the beer. The nose is smooth and creamy. I get a lot of dark fruit and cola along with vanilla and cream. It smells like the perfect old ale. The flavors are ridiculous. It's plenty malty with just a touch of bourbon. There is smooth cream and vanilla with some figs. It's really interesting and complex. It drinks light and velvety, so smooth. I really like it although I prefer Old Stock Bourbon and Bourbon Barrel Fourth Dementia to it by far. The difference is the amount of bourbon. This tastes like it is aged, since it is, and is a few years old and I would assume it has mellowed out a tad. I'd would love to try this at year two from the barrel."
"O - This is a fantastic beer. I really don't know what else to say."
""
""
"Overall - I enjoyed this quite a bit. Regular Adam is just as good, but less complex."
"Overall: This is a fantastic beer. The difference between this and the regular version is huge. I would love to have more of this beer."
"Huge, viscous body brings everything together. Tons of well-crafted flavors make this immensely enjoyable; AftW is something every beer geek needs to sample. One of my favorites!"
"Overall - It's an impressive beer with impressive flavors. Too sweet, which is strange, because Adam is hardly sweet. I'm also surprised it isn't as dominated by Bourbon. Three years is a long time."
"O - Wow, Adam is already one of my all-time favorite beers and this takes it to another level. This is one of the best beers I've ever had and can't wait to see how it ages. I had this the same night as I had a Dark Lord and it boggles my mind how Dark Lord gets so much hype and a beer like this almost flies under the radar."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had next to 8 or 10 different vintages of Adam. Pour is dark brown with red edges and a thin tan head. The nose is heavy barrel, rather sweet bourbon almost on the verge of Brandi. Light olive and some heat. The taste is more Base Adam forward but still has a strong barrel presence. The chocolate is stronger, sweet dark fruits, notes of bourbon and faint heat. The body is a bit thinner, still silky but not as creamy, fair carbonation. Not as good as base adam but still a nice beer."
""
"Full bodied. Great beer, complex, balanced, and delicious."
""
"O: A slow sipper with phenomenal complexity and flavors. Fantastic stuff, this shows so many flavors over the course of a bottle. Another winner from HotD."
"O - One of the best barrel aged beers that I've had. This one reminds me a bit of King Henry with maybe a bit more complexity. Perfect amount of bourbon, not too hot, not too sweet or cloying this is a top notch of a beer and worth getting your hands on a bottle if you get a chance."
""
"Pretty good beer, but not sure given how much it takes to trade for, if I'd value it that high. Glad I got to try it."
"4.0 T: It's very tasty, but probably not worth the hefty trading value. BB4D blows this out of the water anyway for half the price. In any case, I'm glad I could try it."
""
""
"The mouthfeel leans a little towards the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Overall, I thought it was a fantastic beer. The bold mlatiness of Adam is perfectly complimented by the smooth bourbon. It really comes together well and they balanced the barrel and beer flavors perfectly. it was incredibly smooth for 12% as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Relentlessly decadent brew that is an absolute must for sweet-tooths. Those who aren't will undoubtedly prefer the base beer."
""
"O - A real good ale, tasty and heavy."
"2011 vintage overall score of 4.6."
""
""
"As a side note, I tasted this one side-by-side with Matt and Adam and this one was the best, no comparison. I thought Matt was world class, so I was shocked this one was clearly superior. So glad I got to try this one."
""
""
""
""
"o- wow! i was going in expecting a lot but this one still succeeded to impress me. i cant find one bad thing with beer. id love to have this side by side with ba 4d, both beers are world class, i think this one might beat it just barely."
"O - An awesome beer in the vein BB4D, BA Coton, and BA Papier. This is one of the best beers I've had ever. I don't know if the new batch is as good, but if it is, I'm going to get a ton of it."
"A beer to savor and enjoy. I like it, but it’s not as epic as I thought."
""
"Cheers!"
"O: A great beer. You can really see how this benefited from being in the barrel for over 3 years."
"O: Exceptional!"
""
"Look, I liked this a lot and would without question drink it again. But when asked what my favorite barrel aged Old Ale is, I can assure you that Señor Adam de la Wood won't be topping my list."
""
"Pours a dark brown with a reddish hue, head is tan, beer and head are both noticeably darker than the regular Adam. Smells of bourbon and dark fruit, interestingly a bit like a quad. Taste is awesome, the bourbon really mixes perfectly with the dark fruit and the maltiness of the base beer, has notes of vanilla as well. Incredibly easy to drink for the abv, delicious! Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and pretty much spot-on. Overall, this beer is really amazing, an incredible execution of barrel aging with an already fantastic beer."
""
"(D)- Yet another profoundly excellent beer from Hair of the Dog. Each release just makes me more and more impressed particularly when taking into account the barrel aged beers in their portfolio. Definitely a sipper if there ever was one, but one I would and could easily have a whole bottle to myself. Right up there with Matt as their best beer I have had from them so far."
"2011 bottle. Pours a very dark burgundy/chestnut that appears near black in the snifter, with a small creamy beige head of super tight bubbles. Nose is dates and cherries soaked in brandy, leather, smoke, a touch of brine which is just classic Adam. Very decadent alcoholic details on the nose. Mouth is very creamy, rich, alcohol heat throughout, lots of dripping dark fruits in brandy, bourbon, brine and leather in the mid palate, with a pleasantly hot finish. Takes the edgy qualities of a 2 year old Adam and just adds dimensions of complexity. I've been looking for this beer, wistfully, for years and was stoked to see it was being released again, and it doesn't disappoint at all."
"'11 batch shared by beerdy last month. Pours a dark brown that borders on black, topped by a thin cap. The nose is rather decadent, showcasing a ton of bourbon and oak. The signature leather and tobacco aroma of Adam is still present, along with vanilla, light nuttiness, smoke and somewhat brash but not unwelcome alcohol. The palate is warming and sweet, bourbon at the forefront with plenty of oak, tannin, vanilla and caramel. Lightly oxidized, still surprisingly hot despite all the years in the barrel. The earthiness of Adam shines through past the big barrel flavors, contributing leather and tobacco, dark fruit, subtle smoke. The body is medium-full; it feels a bit more hefty than the non-barreled Adam. A fantastic beer overall, though it may benefit from some time in the bottle to tame the heat."
"I have a few bottles of Cherry Adam that I'm looking forward to trying soon."
""
""
"O: Adam FTW doesn't quite live up to the hype, but only because people are asking for 750mL bottles of CBS for one 12 oz bottle of it. It is a spectacular BA Old Ale that should be sought and savored. Just don't trade your cellar for it."
""
"Old ale, indeed. I don't think sitting on this is going to help it. It's aged already, and ready to drink."
""
"Were this still drinkability a 5 here would be a no brainer. Forget it, you won't find a beer of this style of delicious and full flavor as drinkable as this. Still a 5 best of the class here."
"I didn't find the bottled version to be as intense, complex, or interesting as the sample I had on tap in September at the brewery."
"Adam from the Wood isn't just the best beer I've had from Hair of the Dog, it's one of the best big beers to come off the West Coast in a long time. Highly recommended!"
""
""
"Edit from 3/14. Lucky for me, I now live near the HOTD tasting room again, and so get to taste this beer from time to time. As expected, time has been this beer's friend, and bottles of this now taste incredible. I have modified my ratings and score accordingly."
"O: Just delicious, I can't get over the smell... it was fantastic."
""
"Awesome! Amazing! Delicious! I want more! So much more! what else can I say?...If this isn't on he top of your wants/whales list....PUT IT THERE!"
""
"Awesome. Excellent beer. My favorite of a night of good beer, this is top-shelf."
""
"A great beer. I was mostly tasting the barrels, would probablly change with some age on it. To me does not have the complexity of Matt but is still outstanding."
""
"Beer is medium in body, a little thinner than expected, a little stronger than I expected, very oaky, very vanilla and bourbony, strong throughout. Very good, an interesting variant on Adam. Adam still is awesome but this beer is slightly more awesomer."
"The body is nice and full with soft carbonation. Overall this one is great. Tough to beat."
"This is delicious."
"Pours a very dark brown with a bit of a thin tan collar. The nose carries a good amount of musty oak and bourbon plus malt and some slight tobacco. Flavor has a bit more bourbon and isn't quite as integrated but is still quite nice. Medium body's with no alcohol and low carbonation. Standout stellar beer. Boom."
"Very sweet and smooth body with light carbonation. Barrel is much more well integrated than Bourbon Fred. Bourbon, cherry, plum, tobacco, oak and brown sugar carry the flavor. Rich and sweet, but more enjoyable than Matt, bourbon Fred or Cherry Adam. Alcohol is present throughout but not off putting. Amazing."
"The beer is dark brown with a thin beige cap. The aroma offers bourbon, oak - very enticing, but lacks the complexity of regular Adam. Bourbon overpowers some if the more subtle aspects of the beer. Great flavor. Melts in your mouth smooth feel with alcohol heat masterfully contained. Lingering bourbon in the aftertaste, though exceptionally soft on the palate. Overall, outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a full bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. While the individual ingredients and flavoring of this can be picked apart as drastically unique in their own right, they really blend and tie together very well in this. This is a fantastic sipper of a brew with a great depth of character. I know it is already so many years in the making but honestly I am curious what more aging would do to this already fine example."
""
"O: I am blown away by this beer. Full flavored, perfectly balanced, and just a pleasure to sip on. A must try. Cheers."
""
"Positively amazing."
""
""
"Overall, this beer is just what I expected, and more. Great job HotD. If this ages like your other beers, this will be even more heavenly in a few years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Definitely a wow factor beer. Big, complex and in your face. Just delicious and an improvement on one of my faves in regular adam."
""
""
"The body is full and creamy and perfect, but overall this beer was a total letdown."
""
"Pours a dark reddish brown. A touch of light off-white head. Smells barrel heavy with some slight odd aromas. Smells similar to the tequila black hole. Interesting. Tastes very sweet and bourbony. Well carbonated. Overall good but not stellar. A bit boozy. Would drink it agin but it didn't blow me away"
"O-very, very stellar beer"
"O: If there is any beer out there to slowly savor and sip on, this is it. So much flavor packed into every little sip. Adam is a fantastic beer to begin with, but put him in bourbon barrels for over three years and you have a masterpiece. Many thanks to Alan for continuing to create such incredible and unique beers!"
"Taste was incredible - think Adam with strong bourbon, coconut, and vanilla notes. The bourbon was in perfect balance with the beer and not overpowering it. It doesn't feel hot at all either - it's wonderful to drink immediately."
""
""
""
"O: Very solid. It's a bit young, but I predict it will age phenomenally. I'm looking forward to tracking its progress in a year or two. In retrospect, I regret not asking for more of this."
""
"Overall: This beer is quite an experience. It's among the best I've ever had. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Alan, you've made another masterpiece...like I'm surprised lol."
""
"O: Amazing beer. Not the best ever but certainly complex and good. Scary drinkable for 12%."
"O - While I thought the 2000 vintage had too much oak, the 2011 vintage is just spot-on outstanding. The booze is well-hidden, the oak is perfect, the the sweetness is top-notch. An awesome beer, to say the least."

": Thick and carbonated. Easily drinkable for its ABV and despite its heft. O: Doing really well at 1.5 years old. Drained this way too fast considering the price tag. Good thing there’s more."
""
""
""
""
"O: A truly wonderful beer. Just like the base Adam, it's one of a kind. Call me crazy, but I think I actually prefer the non-barrel aged base beer though. That could be due to (as I stated in the mouthfeel) the alcohol being too big and hot at the moment. I'd love to stash a few bottles of this away for a year or so and see if that helps it integrate better. Just let me know when these are getting released and count on seeing me in line. 4/5"
"O: I am very impressed with this beer. After the let down known as Cherry Adam, I wasn't sure any barrel aged Adam was going to make the cut and I was wrong. This beer is exceptional."
"O: This is a spectacular beer, utterly delicious and perfectly balanced. A benchmark for barrel-aged beers. I'll be at the tasting room any time Alan puts this on."
"bottle... dark brown, a bit shiny no head... the nose is phenomenal, one of the best smelling beers I’ve had, sweet molasses, bourbon, brown sugar... the taste isn’t as bursting as the nose, a little flat, but outstanding, brown sugar and molasses, the finish is a bit too oaky with smoke, a small complaint, but still great... try this"
"This is pretty impressive, one of the better examples I've come across of both an Old Ale and barrel aging in general."
"Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had. It's hard to describe the layers of complexity. I could drink this daily for a long time and discover new facets every time. Truly phenomenal."
"Overall: A highlight of an already star-studded beercation. Nothing can compare in the real sense of the word. I've had nothing similar."
"D - Delicious stuff that has aged extremely well. I'm curious how the new batch compares, seeing as it was only aged for roughly half as long. In any case, this was a real treat. A sipper, with it's rich flavor and deceptive alcohol."
"O: One of the best beers I've had in a long while - a 'WOW' that I was sad to have come to an end but so happy to have tried. I have been in love with the Adambier from Day 1; this just takes it up a notch or five. A rumored bottling in Fall 2011 should put this acclaimed ale into many more eager hands and bellies... the line begins forming now."
"d- YES!"
"at 3 years, this is definitely bourbon heavy.. in addition, they did not choose a particularly smoky adam to put in those barrels. and even after 3 years, its still pretty damn hoppy and bitter. i'm thinking the smoke is dwelling in there, but the beer needs another couple years to meld the heat and suppress some of the hops, vanilla & oak. as a bourbon barrel aged strong ale, this is a hands-down great beer. compared to the 2000, this is just good. this will be released in bottles this fall (guessing $15/12oz) and it will be imperative to purchase several to sit on. if i can recreate the magic of the 2000 batch with age, it will be worth every penny."
"O - I was amazed by the carbonation and the complex flavors. A++ in my book. I could drink this till I fall off the stool."
"O: Just f*** awesome. Best beer that I have ever had hands down. Nothing else can compare. I wish I could take a keg home!"
"D- Its a big heavy beer, but it has so much flavor I couldn't stop drinking it. If I had another bottle I don't think i could let it sit very long and probably would opened it by now. What an amazing beer. I am usually not a fan of old ales, but this is one of the best."
"Magnum that was shared at the opening of the new Hair of the Dog Brewpub!... Poured opaque, brown with no head, except for a little bit of bubbles at the surface. Aroma had lots of bourbon, and brandy-like booze, heavy with alcohol and even notes of cocoa, and buttery malts. Not as smokey as regular Adam, it seemed to have lost that in either the barrel aging or the bottle aging. Little carbonation, hot with whiskey flavors, and notes of prunes, currants, savory meats, and a little bit of roast. Very fortified, like a fine port wine."
"D: A fairly high ABV beer, but very smooth and easy to drink. The bourbon presence might be a bit for some, but I found this on quite enjoyable."
"Get to stuffed sandwich stat."
"I've had Adam before, but from the woods, this was beautiful. There wasn't very much head and it did fall fast.The flavors settled really well and stayed in your mouth. Thick cream but smooth finish. Definately a winter warmer but there was no part of this beer that i didnt enjoy. All the way through it was unbelievable. SO TASTY ! I sank into the moment with the first mouthful. mmm"
"12oz bottle. Pours a dark brown/red color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is very alcoholic - bourbon, oak, coffee-roast malts, some dark fruit. The flavor has a lot of caramel and bourbon/oak flavors, but even more alcohol flavor. Fairly sweet finish. Also has some earthy bitterness that sticks around on the tongue. The mouthfeel is moderate, but the alcohol and bitterness stick around on the palate making this one a little less drinkable for me. Very interesting beer."
"Very well done and very tasty."
"I knew I would like this and who would not enjoy Adam that spent over seven years in a barrel, another great brew from Hair of the Dog, cannot wait to try the cherry version now and compare these, I hope this is released again in the future, I want more, recommended"
"Murky, swampy brown, with no head at all. Honestly, it didn't look particularly appetizing, but to convey the overall awesomeness of this brewski, I have to give it a higher score.Pretty light aroma, consisting mostly of port-like dark malt, tons of sherry steeped fruit, vanilla, and oak-soaked creamines. Smells like it's been waiting for me to sip, and waiting patiently. The flavor follows suit, with malt engraved into wooden slats, absolutely soaked in vanilla-like oak. No ""barrel"" feel, just straight oak and all its creamy wildness. Powerful roastiness. Minimal, if any, carbonation. The barest sparkle on the swallow. Pretty much flat. If you like cask ale, this is great. If not, this might not qualify as beer to you. Huge, thick body with a coating, lasting mouthfeel. The juicy malt flavor lingers forever. Hops leave trace residue of earthiness, but contribute no bitterness at this point. Finishes molasses-like and hugely biting in its sweetness. Very sweet, so much so that it's reserved for true beer aficionados only. Many people at the gathering could hardly manage three or four ounces of the stiff. More for the rest of us!!! I certainly indulged, and enjoyed every sip. Adam should always be kept in the wood. Imprison that evil bastard."
"A most interesting aroma of peat, alcohol, scotch, port. Appearance was deceiving because of soap like bubbles, no head. Taste barley, bourbon, salty, barrel wood. Thanks to Woolfs at Doug Shoemaker tasting. The taste, the alcohol - must be sipped. Speed bumps slowing us all down."
"Mouthfeel is nice and smooth with a syrupy, nearly liqour like consistency. Just a damn fine brew that I dunno if I'll ever be able to try again. Highly recommended and I seriously hope I get the chance to run across this again someday."
