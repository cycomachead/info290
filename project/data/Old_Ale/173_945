Aroma is caramel, nuts, molasses, dark fruits like plum and fig, anise, a touch of bakers chocolate. Taste initially borders on strong sweetness with chocolate, brown sugar, raisin, and maple syrup flavors. Light bitterness comes on the swallow with nutty and tobacco notes. Some smoke and band-aid flavors come late. Medium-full body, thick syrupy texture, virtually no carbonation, boozy sweet and tongue-coating finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 25, 2015"

Pours hearty and thick dark brown, looking almost black as it settles in the glass, with a bit creamy khaki brown head. Aroma of brown sugar, some spicy hops, sweet molasses and caramel, toffee, whoah. Smells rich and sweet. Flavor is chocolatey breadyness, peated malts (was not expecting that!), smokey mess mixed with sweet molasses and caramel. Lots going on here, but balanced nicely by the hops and finishes with a light crisp bitterness and light lingering sweetness. Rich body with plus carbonation, lively, yum. Lived up to expectations and included some unexpected flavors win the smokiness/peatyness.","BMMillsy","Jan 31, 2015"

Great complexity and balance along with a scary drinkability for a 10% beer.  This ranks right up there as one of my favorite strong ales.

After about 5 minutes the carb receded and lingered around the top like a crown. Dark in appearance and displayed a wonderful aroma of brown sugar, molasses, and raisins. This was very reminiscent of Sucre in it's body and flavors. At 10%, the alcohol was hidden very well. I need to grab a few more bottle of this on my next purchase. A wonderful Old Ale that is worth drinking over and over. And, if you've never had it, go and find it; I promise you will not be disappointed.","Cubatobaco","Aug 24, 2014"

It's a subdued smoke, not like a rauch or anything, but it's definitely there. Was not expecting it and it overshadows some of the other flavors. No carb issue here. As it warms, some of the dark fruit, caramel, burnt sugar flavor is coming out. Super complex. This might have gone over my head. Worth a try for sure.

Likewise Blue Dot: thought it was OK, but nothing to write home about (unless you consider BA home, because I think I did write a review. But that's silly. Who would make that comparison?). Maybe the intervening years really have matured my palate. Maybe I'm just amped on America and puppies. Either way, Adam really stood out to me as an excellently crafted work of gustatory/zymurgical art, and I can fully understand the hype around AftW and CAftW (even though I haven't had and probably never will get to taste either). Since I've not had it FRESH, I can't speak to how it's changed over the years (this one's only about two years old), but rest assured after this bottle, I'll certainly be picking a couple more up when I see them to test that question. I suggest you do the same.","kemoarps","Jul 04, 2014"

Aromas of dark chocolate, herbaceous hops, liquorice, raisin, dates, figs, sweet malt with a hint of smoke & leather. Flavor follows the aroma, medium sweet to begin with; molasses, sweet dark fruits, malt loaf etc and a dark chocolate bittersweet flows before the spicy hop bitterness hits, giving a nice savory kick. Medium bodied, with a sticky texture. Good, pleasant, soft natural carbonation helps to coat the tongue, leading to a very satisfying, bitter sweet, sticky long finish.","jbaker67","Feb 13, 2014"

We found the malty aroma inviting, despite having very little hops or yeast. We could detect figs and chocolate, and it smelled very sweet and slightly boozy. The taste was amazingly complex- with smoke, leather, and dark fruit. The nose definitely belied the taste. The mouthfeel medium with decent carbonation.

I've gotten it most in stone's vanilla and chipotle porters. but anyway . . . . . . the taste has a little of the Belgian yeast and lots of the band-aid... twisty, funky bitterness. I truly am surprised by the super high ratings as I do not feel it merits them and, hence, the wonder if bouncing it off the tile hampered it any. seems to have a lot of alcohol presence which, at 10%, is deservedly so. to a certain degree. I suppose i'm just a little disappointed reading all the high reviews, finally finding one of these guys, and not being very impressed with it. it's not bad. and it's very decent, considering the high abv, but I probably was expecting too much.","pkalix","Dec 07, 2013"

And this is still a very interesting beer and its complexity and composition are worthy of the Hair of the Dog name. Pros, those guys, among the very best. While I've had a handful of more delicious beers (though this is delicious), what this beer has is complexity. I mean, things are happening in your mouth, different things at different times, an interplay between flavor elements and mouthfeel elements. It's a journey. That's what I'm looking for in a beer.","BrownNut","Oct 01, 2013"

The flavours are there, but the heat punches through a bit too much for my preference taking away from the smoothness. It's 'only' 10% ABV but drinks like it's at least 12%+. Otherwise very very enjoyable.","GuinnessAtRogerWilco","Sep 19, 2013"

There was a ton of complexity but still remained very flavorful with an insane drinkability. This makes a perfect after-dinner desert beer and I'd love to see how this ages, however it is perfect drinking right now with less then a year on it. If you like complex old ales with a ton of flavor I definitely recommend checking this out.","jaasen64","Jul 13, 2013"

Smells of an alcohol burn with deep, rich fruit notes like figs and currants. Rating to style, I can really see why people would love this beer. The flavors are strong and bold, and close out with just a slight bit of bitter on the back end, which all fades away into a smooth blend. For me personally, these aren't flavors I enjoy, so liquefying and fermenting them isn't going to change that.","yankeepride","May 12, 2013"

Aromas of sweet fruit-fig strongest, malt is dominant, some yeast notes here too. Taste is big and rich. Lots of malt with sweet toasted grain taste. Notes of toffee, figs, Finish is warm but not strongly alcoholic. Ends clean and rather quick. Mouthfeel is heavy and velvety smooth. This is what I'd like an old ale to be. A malt bomb that is easy to drink but better to contemplate. Delicious.","deebo","Apr 19, 2013"

Pours cloudy almost opaque dark reddish brown color with a small light khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lasts. Minimal spotty lacing, and some nice alcohol legs as well. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, fig, molasses, toffee, caramel, chocolate, toast, dark bread, leather, tobacco, earth, wood, and herbal earthiness. Insanely complex and balanced aromas with big strength; Wow. Taste of big raisin, fig, molasses, toast, toffee, prune, leather, tobacco, chocolate, roasted malt, dark bread, light char, earth, wood, and herbal earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruits, molasses, toast, toffee, caramel, chocolate, dark bread, leather, tobacco, earth, wood, light char, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible flavor balance with huge complexity of malty notes; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very slick, creamy, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is insanely well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a world class old ale! Huge complexity and balance of malty flavors; and dangerously smooth to sip on. This blew me away, wow.","superspak","Feb 01, 2013"

Taste follows with all things mentioned above, again very complex, in fact I'm going to say this is the most complex beer I've had to date. I'd give it a 5, but it's hard not to imagine it couldn't be improved upon with so much going on. Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth, it hides it's alcohol well without too much sweetness or bitterness.

Super-carbonated, which I think is kind of distracting, and while it has a huge head it dissipates quickly and doesn't leave much in the way of lacing.

Topping it off is a creamy tan head, that retains stubbornly until the last drop, and leaves an equally creamy layer of lacing on the glass. Some trub present, so be careful with the pour, though even with some in there, it is non-offensive. Aroma is thick with heavy malts, creamy caramel, and chocolate chips; notes of dark fruit. Uncommonly smooth on the tongue, tastes of chocolate and molasses, woody, with notes of licorice, caramel, and indistinct dark fruits. Creamy and smooth, full-bodied, and splendidly drinkable, whether chilled or at room temperature.","Rifugium","Jan 09, 2012"

Flavor is fairly similar, with some caramel and toffee along with a light smokeyness that accompanies the figs and dark fruits.

Flavors are decadent and very English; very much the old ale of repute that has been taken to the next level. At about two years of age it is smooth, yet bitter in the finish with a pronounced earthy hop character whose herbaceousness contrasts every other feature. Roast lingers on the palate, nearly scorched but appealing. Alcohol shows a constant but metered presence, adding to the potential for sipping pleasure.","beagle75","Nov 23, 2011"

Actually, one might even call it a bit dry for what it is. Having had cherry adam recently, adam is absent any of the brightness that really causes the cherry adam to pop.

The taste kicks off with a pretty strong hoppy flavor and then fades into a roasted dry chocolatey flavor.

It's a sipper, and a damn good one at that. The alcohol is hidden well, unlike Palo Santo, a good comp. Where DFH's beer kicks you in the face, Hair of the Dog invites you in for a cigar.

4.23,-0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Adam pours a murky, deep mahogany. It's absolutely solid and imposing, even direct backlighting results in nary a shimmer of highlight at the edge of the glass. There's a solid three fingers of khaki colored foam sitting atop the beer. Staying power is off the charts, and a thick solid ring of lacing is left marking the apex of the head, with more spotty lacing trailing down the glass below. The only thing keeping the beer from perfection here is the unpleasant white floaties that remain suspended for a second before pooling at the bottom of the glass. The nose doesn't really jump out of the glass, but there's some caramel/toffee and the aroma of figs soaked in alcohol (with a surprisingly sharp emphasis on the alcohol), as well as a definite whiff of oxidation. It all works pretty well together though, as the booziness stops short of overwhelming. The flavor encompasses just about everything from the nose, and adds a light touch of milk chocolate to make things interesting. No one flavor really acts as the centerpiece of the beer, though I wish the oxidation was a little less prominent. The body isn't as full as I might have expected from a 10%, malt forward beer. That ends up working fine though, as the flavor profile isn't particularly rich/decadent, so a lush mouthfeel isn't really needed. Adam was my first Hair of the Dog beer, and I dug it. My best guess is that this one is maybe 3+ years old, I'd very much like to try one that's a bit more fresh.","axeman9182","Jul 29, 2011"

4.82,13.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Needless to say, I can read and follow directions, so I used a very gentle slow pour. I got a most impressive dense finger of light-tan head in spite of my low-key pour and it had great retention! Nose was quite vinous, reminiscent of a dry red wine. Color was a deep dark-brown with garnet highlights and NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was relatively full with a lot of carbonation in evidence. My initial mouthful was somewhat hot, giving way to a tawny port-like taste. Wow! I am not a wine guy, but my uncle has been into wine for twenty-five years or so and I have had some exposure to it. The dryness of the finish was gasping in its intensity. I did not experience the hops mentioned on the label, nor did I really get much in the way of maltiness. Instead, this would probably stack up well against a sherry or a port. I am really impressed and will have to get some new vintages for storing. Winner, winner, chicken dinner! Finally, the lacing looked as though it would take a jackhammer to remove.","woodychandler","Jul 20, 2011"

For being 7 years old, this brew is still quite bold in alcohol and hops that are more flavorful than bitter. A very solid sipper with a lightly fusel kick of alcohol. Overall a well rounded and enjoyable take on the style, I have no doubt this brew can withstand 10+ years of aging considering how well this 7 year old bottle is unscathed.","stakem","Jul 19, 2011"

It smells of oak, molasses, figs, raisins, and has light smoke. It probably has one of the best nose's I've encountered in an Old Ale. The flavors consist of oak, leather, raisins, figs, molasses, maple syrup, with a light smoky ham finish. It's superb! I'm glad I decided to try it again because it's far better than I remember it. The mouthfeel is perfect. It is very well meshed and has a nice creamy feel on the palate. It leaves a nice oaky, leathery aftertaste behind that drives me nuts.

Smells of smoked dark malts, chocolate covered chipotle peppers, and band aids. Very interesting and unusual smells for a beer. Taste is of smoked chipotle peppers, dark malts, band aids, and an earthy cocoa bean flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty flat with a thickness that makes this beer somewhat hard to drink.

Flavor follows the nose with brown sugar, toffee, chocolate chips, burnt wood, and leather. Very slight sour astringency. Moderate hop profile; slightly citrusy/fruity with a bigger presence in the finish. Syrupy sweet, but not cloying (enjoyable sweetness). Creamy and chewy on the palate.

Poured a massively dark brown just a shade shy of black with a three finger khaki head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, brown sugar, leather, alcohol, and smoke. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, cream, citrus, citrus hop, leather, smoke, and caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a damn good brew. The flavor on this one was other-worldly when it came to complexity! Really good aroma going on here as well. This was actually the first time that I have ever been able to pick up on leather in a beer I've had and I actually quite enjoyed it in this one with all of the other flavors working quite well with it.

First whiff hints at many complex layers... smoke, leather, dark fruit, sherry, earth, charred meat, solid malt backbone (burnt carmel, molasses, brown sugar), noticable hop presence at the rear. Taste brings the components of scent together in a suprisingly well blended package... malt gives way to smoke and leather, good hop bitterness and flavor, mellowing into a richly complex and deep flavor. Medium bodied, maybe a touch highly carbonated for style, smooth and dry finnish. A unique beer which may overpower some tastebuds, but worth a drink.","rfgetz","Apr 01, 2011"

The color is a very dark translucent brownish plum color that is what I like to see in an old ale. The smell is fruity in nature, giving off aromas of plum along with some sweet butterscotch and brown sugar notes. The taste is surprisingly roasty, though that is not the main flavor. The main flavor is again the plum with some black cherry notes and butterscotch as the kicker. The mouthfeel is really very flat and with the highly viscous nature of this beer it doesn't help too much.

I sensed alot of dark fruit perhaps some raisin, fig, slight leather, and smoke. Full bodied mouthfeel and with little carbonation.

Full-bodied, lots of grip, not sticky but it soaks into every pore it can find in your mouth, dark chocolate, mocha, caramel, brown sugar, grill smoke and molasses baked ham. Grape, cherry, apricot, plum fruit, all over the map, sweet and close to dried fruit concentration. The carbonation brings a softer fluffiness, however, overall a minor factor. Resinous leafiness, tree bark, more black tea, the sweetness registering here tempers the edge of the smokiness.

The smoked flavors overpower at first but then are balanced out by the resinous fruit flavors - fig, raisins, sweet black cherries. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light to medium carbonation.

On the palate, this beer is every bit as good. It's fairly sweet of course, but the melange of sherry, wood, vanilla, cherry liquer, dark chocolate and light licorice (in the finish) keeps me coming back, wanting more and more, after every sip. Fresh Adam also seems to have some noticeable hoppy bitterness in the finish that helps to counter and balance out the sweetness as well. Mouthfeel is full with a long, drawn out finish in this richly delicious beer. Drinkability is pretty good, though I'm aware of the 10% abv. in this beer as I go along.

Toffee, some dark chocolate notes (though not too big), fig/currant, with a little sting of alcohol on the back of the throat. Despite being a big sipping brew, it is strangely easy to drink. I'd be interested in trying this with more carbonation, as others have seemed to mention, because it worked out great the way it was.

Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good brew. I'm not sure exactly how old this is, but I do know it's aged pretty well!

Unfortunately I could tell from the pour that this was just about flat and I was correct. Mouthfeel is watery and pretty much flat but the flavors are so good it makes up for it for the most part. Like I kinda noted in my original review, 6oz goes down easily, 12oz is a bit more tolling because of the richness. I also had a flat Cherry Adam a couple months ago, so I'm a bit weary of HotD's beers in fear of carbonation issues, but in regular Adam's case to me it's a small chink in the armor of awesomeness.","Chico1985","Jun 16, 2010"

This particular bottle (batch 76) has no head at all and very little carbonation. The aroma is quite sweet with plenty of dark sugar notes and some smokiness, as well as some alcohol. Seems pretty subdued for style. So far I am not impressed. The taste, however, is another story. Sweet, smokey, roasty, rich and delectable. It also has some cocoa notes and perhaps some tobacco like flavors as well. Dark dried fruit, maybe a bit of anise, leather? There is considerable alcoholic strength in there as well, but this beer masks it well. This is one masculine beer. I can see myself drinking this in a garage while smoking a cheap cigar. The body is pretty full, and very smooth. This is likely due to the fact that it has almost no carbonation, but it is smooth none the less. The finish is decent, but leaves a wonderful lingering roasty smokiness that is quite nice. This is also one of the more drinkable old ales I have had. This would go awesome with BBQ of any sort.

Poured the color and clarity of cola with a dense, 2.5 inch creamy, khaki-colored head. Head exhibits excellent retention, barely allowing for the glass to be refreshed, before condensing into a solid quarter inch head with a band of lacing that coats the bowl of the glass down to the cap. Nose reveals dark fruit (plums and prunes), cocoa and perhaps a slightly metallic character. Taste follows nose; however some acidity hits early on and there is also a slightly roast/smokey quality in the mix that lingers between quaffs. A bit of alcohol also professes itself towards the middle and nicely muddles with the sugary sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a lively effervescence and a slightly viscous, although not heavy across the tongue. Really tasty, complex and enjoyable.

Though that may sound at least a bit off-putting, they all combine to create an overall pleasant aroma. The taste is ostensibly bitter, in terms of hops, herbs (something akin to wormwood), and leather. There are also hints of anise and raisins.

A truly beautiful beer (bump up from 4.5). The nose is tres complex, big smokiness like a fine cigar, floral hops, a bit of bittersweet chocolate and leather, kept beckoning me back to take another whiff. The taste mirrors the nose, this is one smoky beer, while I haven't had any real Rauchbiers this is by far the smokiest beer I've enjoyed. A bit sweet, candi sugar, leather and figs towards the back end. The hops are noticeable in the finish, but not overpowering. The complexity grows as the brew warms. Alcohol is a bit noticeable on the back end, but not overly so. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky and certainly smoky dry. Good drinkability for this ABV, certainly a late night sipper.

The aroma is sweet and malty, brown sugar on malty toast. This isn't a vintage bottle, so the hops still come through with some citrus. The flavor is somewhere between a doppelbock, a barleywine and an English strong ale. There's sweet malt with some light toasty crystal malt. The malt has some good fruity notes, prunes, apricots and raisins. It's a really delicious beer - Hair of the Dog is an incredible brewery.","popery","Oct 30, 2009"

Poured a deep brown color with an obnoxiously foamy beige head that foamed all over, but patience was the key here. Once the ale was finally in the glass, the head retention was magnificent and left some crazy lace on the glass - looks like a bomb went off. Aromas were earthy with hints of fig, leather, molasses, and chocolate with some faint alcohol in the background (the bottle does a fine job of describing what is inside - even the leather part). Tastes are very complex and warming - earthy, tobacco, fig, leather, raisins, molasses, and chocolate. Mouth-fell is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Alcohol is present by prickling the tongue and leaving a burn on the way down the throat - once again warming. Overall, I love it's uniqueness, but I'm not sure that I would buy it again. Recommendable at least.","barnzy78","Oct 29, 2009"

It tends slightly towards the sweetish side, but not cloyingly so, with a little faint bitterness, spice, and alcoholic warmth to help balance and carry it, however all of these are tame and the result is smooth.

The taste is somewhat reminiscent of an easy drinking Barley Wine with a bit of chocolate added, some dried fruit presence as well. This is certainly one that only gets better as it warms.

Musky, resinous hops and chewy, dank raisins balance the choco-malt presence well, while a heated, boozy finish warms the back of the throat. Although the alcohol is masked quite well, the heat is certainly noticable. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a spot-on carbonation level and a nice finish that leaves me wanting more.

Full flavored, the berry currant taste is assertive and the mild chocolate and smoky characteristic lingers significantly. A bit of a sipper, the 10% ABV is present in the mouth and amplified by the sharp tart characteristic of the currant. Scoring points for imagination and passion.

Alcohol is very apparent on the finish, and hops are much more noticeable on the finish than one would expect. Alcohol soaked dark malt and fruit remains on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thin side for the style, but still quite viscous. Drinkability is excellent for the style and the abv.

More like a very dark red. you could see a brighter red tint in the light, kind of like wine. nice head that remained for a while. i couldnt get much of a smell for some reason - maybe because i was in an indian restaurant when i cracked it open. this was my first old ale and it was nothing like anything ive had before. the blurb on the bottle was spot on when it said its been compared to figs and leather. craziness..also very raisony, and some smokiness and bitter coffee beans. as complex as it was, these flavors did not all seem to mix seemlessly. it exploded in my mouth but caused some damage. shared a bottle with a nice girl and it was very hard to finish for both of us but this was probably because we had just ate a huge meal and a bottle of southampton grand cru. nevertheless i still couldnt see this one going down easy. my bottom line for this beer is that it desparately needs some age. i know HOTD does that anyway to their brews, but this one especially needs to sit in the corner and think things over for a long time.

Lets just start from the top. Poured a very deep dark brown with a big three finger plus head of tan lace and just a really full overall look. This was really nice looking with tons of residual side glass lace and a sticky foam top that would not quit. The aroma was wonderful, full of sweet smells of caramel, sugar, chocolate and nuts, with a nice hop essence in the back. I am not sure what the style of this is, but the flavor was robust and full. Very nutty with a decidedly caramelesque sugar to it and a really great fresh, and dry hop like finish. There were hints of chocolate and coffee throughout, but not enough to make it rely totally on those. Such a very full bodied feel, very creamy and rich.

Smell is peculiar and somewhat hard to describe. Its sweet, with licorice, i suspect probably really brewed with a decent amount of brewing licorice. Its hard to pick up the malts behind it but probably an amber base with a bit of black and or peated malt. Taste isnt thin, slightly bitter with a malty peculiar finish. Its quite enjoyable. I'm not familiar with many other examples of the old ale style, but this is enjoyable and one to revisit. I suspect a bit of aging would significantly improve this offering and mellow the bitter bite and smooth out the smoke.","lifeboyq","Oct 15, 2007"

It was a beautiful opaque reddish black with an astounding 3 finger pillowy latte cream crown with great retention, thick lacing, and a really nice nose of honey, roasted grains, and some hoppy florals in back. Coffee with cream came up as it warmed. I realized I was in barley-wine territory right off. Big roasted malts with alcohol where first registered, then dark fruit, subtle molasses, and some not-so-subtle bittering on the finish. It's a big beer.

The taste also packs a punch, with flavors of coffee, bitter chocolate, bitter orange, gentian, and something elusive that is slightly sour and fruity- maybe raspberries and cream?

A base of coffee-tinged malt flavors has overtones of fruitiness, plus more complex things I cant identify -- maybe some roasty molasses. It has a bittersweet finish, with a late dryness on the tongue. The mouthfeel is smooth, almost milky. Because its bottle-conditioned, there were particles visible even in the murk, and a noticeable residue on the bottom of the glass -- but thats not necessarily a bad thing. Highly recommended.","Flyer","Jun 30, 2007"

The taste is a beautiful balance of smoke, fig, alcohol, chocolate, yeast, coffee, hops, and whatever else is in there that's combining to create perhaps the most unique overall flavor I've tasted in a beer. Maybe I should try some more Old Ale's though. I love how it reminds of a RIS, but it's just got so much more going on. I love the flavor presence of the yeast and the fruits. I don't think there's anything I'd change about this beer. The mouthfeel is very creamy, yet balanced perfectly by the carbonation. Like a root beer float. Hmm. Now that's an idea! The sweetness in this beer is in perfect harmony with the bitterness that the hops and chocolate/coffee flavors provide. Three words summarize my thoughts on this beer. Amazing, unique, and balanced.

Somehow I want to describe the aroma as a cross between cherries and beef jerky. The taste is still lightly sweet after all these years. The finish has a nice, smoky pet character to it that even evokes a salty sensation upon the palate. The chewy malt character seems to have lost some body over the years. Actually the smoky peat notes seems to have picked up over the years as the malt backbone has mellowed. This is definitely my favorite of the three 1998 vintage brews. This has aged quite fantastically and is a great argument for sticking a bunch of these in the cellar for long term aging.","Gueuzedude","Mar 17, 2007"

Heavy peaty roast bite with a deep burnt caramel nose and taste. Rich mouth feel, still quite carbonated. Many other American craft brewers should take notes from HOTD on how to brew beers that will age well beyond the typical three year window most seem to lose pizazz after. Just my opinion though. I've never had a decent American craft brew that tasted interesting beyond three years until Adam, and yes I am quite aware of proper cellaring techniques. It's just my opinion - I didn't mean to insult your favorite vintage of Stone Vertical Epic.

Slight ripe figs, vanilla spice and fresh yeast aromas as well. On tasting, creamy mocha, slight dark fruit tartness and treacle sweetness are present. Quite a bit of hop bitterness at the mid-palate gives way to an alcohol burn on the finish. The finish is remarkable in that all the different flavors established already linger on the tongue at once, with no single one dominating. Big, chewy mouthfeel that makes for a meal of a beer. Great beer here, loads of interesting stuff going on, all of it good.","geexploitation","Jun 30, 2006"

An extremely well-crafted, hugely hoppy ale, unlike any English old ale I've tasted so far--presumably the big entry of aromatic American hops makes a significant difference here? But I take it as a healthy input, as the result is harmonious and quite balanced: ""a heavy-weight without making a big entrance"" (if that makes sense?). Still, I wonder if it'd be termed as an old ale--it has so much in common with other hoppy bombs made in USA and much bigger, bitter-er, freshly hoppier than English Old Ales~~ A brilliant and delicious drink all the same.

This tastes like a smoked porter and Baltic porter hybrid. It has tons of malt, roasted, sweet, and smokey, as well as bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and slightly hidden grassy hops. I can taste, and feel, the alcohol, but it's not overpowering. This was my first attempt at cellaring and I'd say it worked out deliciously well.","goschool","Apr 29, 2006"

Nice aroma, could have been a little stronger. The taste is woody and earthy, with a nice raisiny malt flavor yielding to a roasted coffee finish. Moderate in bitterness, warm alcohol also present. I also detect notes of chocolate, and tangy fruit. The flavor complexity is spectacular. The mouthfeel has a nice thickness, but isn't viscous, so it goes down smoothly.

Huge flavor all swirling around estery fruits, molasses, plums, oak, roast, raisins and just a lot of stuff. Starts off quite sweet but the mountain of earthy hops ends it quickly, ends surprisingly very very dry with a ton of earthy dirty hops and lingering vanilla. Smoke becomes more apparent as it warms, as does peppery spicy alcohol. Very belgian in style, similar to a quad, absolutely terrific.

Smell was of fig, plum, heavy heavy alcohol and also a medicinal quality pairing itself with the alcohol. Taste was very similar to the smell, except for the fact that the alcohol/medicine flavors hit me with a vengence. Another flavor that hit me was heavy molasses and sugar. Mouthfeel was thick and syrupy, however it was more the taste then anything that made this beer not so easy to drink. Damn! this is some odd stuff to quaff. The alcohol doesn't even make an effort to mask itself...maybe thats a good thing.

It ends with a big dose of malt and lots of warmth. There's a heavy alcohol character throughout that covers up the other flavours, especially in the finish.

Theres definitely some alcohol here that lends a great warming. The finish is a subtle dry hop and a slightly fruity coffee.

I saw gunsmoke shoot out from under the lid right as I cracked it. After removing the cap it proceeded to foam up, almost spilling over, but I poured just in time. It's a murky (maybe too murky) dark dark red with some sediment and 1 inch of beige head that retains 1/4"" throughout, which is surprising for a beer of it's strength. Smells of coffee, chocolate and caramel, sweetness/fruitiness, and tobacco. It's thick and extremely smooth on the palate, with flavors of citric hops, chocolate, tobacco juice, fruitiness, and a bitterness that is definitely there but subdued by the massive amount of malts. It's so smooth I can barely feel the last sip in my mouth. Like silk. I shared this 12 oz. but I could easily drink 2 of them by myself.","mmmbeer","Nov 28, 2005"

Pungent licorice and beechwood aromas along with heaps of near Rauchbier-like smokiness are wrapped in a marshy nosefeel. The flavor, too, begins with a very strong, burning wood smokiness that develops into something more like heavy black pepper. Whiffs of vanilla bean and juniper (or thyme?) mingle with salt as the beer warms on the palate. By the end of the glass, it's like drinking liquid kalamata olives, with a round, herbal bitterness, and tenacious smoky aftertaste... almost ""gamey."" Saline mouthfeel has a body thick and syrupy enough to rival the most nefarious Imperial Stouts. A slow motion punch of alcoholic fire connects with the gut hard, but this is still very drinkable.

An aromatic brew to say the least -- dry rot, chocolate, charred graham crackers, and bits of smoke. Soft enough in the nose to leave the vague impression of fruit -- or at least some sort of essence of fruit. Acidic in a smoky sense: Imagine gulping a mouthful of eye-burning, campfire smoke while tending a fire. That sensation is buried in there under the surprisingly light, chocolatey, malty, wood flavors. Incredibly complex. The levels and variations through which this goes on one's tongue before one finishes a single bottle is mind-blowing.

Its was a rocky frothy head that was light tan in color and had at least a finger in height worth of head the entire session also leaving nice lacing as it was consumed. The aroma is extremely fruity with the smell of smoke and alcohol lingering about as well. Very interesting smell with some hints of medicine as well which actually blends into the smell quite nicely. The taste is big on roasted malts with notes of smokiness and dark fruits as well. This beer seems to be a style all its own with properties from a variety of standard styles incorporated. There is a slight hop and bitter finish to this one. The body on this is medium to full and it has good carbonation. I found this to be highly drinkable with not much of the 10% in sight.

The perky nose contained roasty and rich sharp malts, with strong notes of plump raisins and subtler banana. Smelled like tasty meal in a bottle. My suspicions were proven correct on the first taste, which revealed a robust and sharp, rich and roasty raisiny malt body, with notes of earth and banana. A moderately bitter finish rounded out the deep and complex malt profile, with lingering pruny-raisin oaky essence that satisfied the palate to the very end. The body was full and rich, like the flavors. Alcohol was completely hidden throughout. While quite rich, this beer was quite drinkable due to the fine balance of it all.

Dark fruits abound along with the smoked peat character. A tiny bit of bready malt is noticeable. Nice and robust. Reminds me in ways of a good scotch ale.

Where, oh, where to start, where, oh, where to stop? A toffeeish flavor comes through on the palate, but before long everything is overtaken by smoke! Loads and loads of malt, rich and warming, earthy, chocolatey flavors peek through, but the notes of smoke and tobacco become dominant. Profound.

4.57,7.3,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Batch 54. Frenetic bubbling. The apparent overcarbonation precludes a simple pour into my favorite ""Schwenker"" glass. 1/8 beer, the rest foam. Ridiculously thick tan, creamy and sticky head. I used two glasses at first. Quite manageable after a short deliberation to allow both me and the beer to calm down. The head is seemingly molten like in viscosity. Lightly murky deep crimson hue. Ripe pear esters, woody oak, with a robust, leafy tobacco - like dark fruit and earthy hop nose combination upfront in aroma. Mellow beechwood smoked malt and butterscotch are secondary. Hint of bittersweet chocolate. Absolutely unique, rich overall and intriguing aromawise. Combination of chocolate and dark caramel laced sweetness initially in flavor is ceded by assertive fruitiness comprised of sugary plums and dried dates, with mild banana esters emerging late. Rounded, judicious smoked malt complements the malt character well. Hop bitterness is moderate and non descript, but offsets malt sweetness enough to aid in the oddly quaffable nature of this brew. Full in body and dextrinous, with the high CO2 levels lingering, lending a paradoxically crisp, yet rich mouthfeel. Finishes lightly smokey, with quasi black patent like malt bittersweet note pleasantly lingering. Adam is a flabbergasting brew. It's reminescent of Schelkerla's Rauchbock / Anchor Old Foghorn hybrid. Absolutely delicious, but somewhat perplexing. This fine beer is certainly worthy of a 750 ml portion.","marc77","Jan 20, 2003"

4.05,-4.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Folks, if you're planning on tasting others beers in the same night, do this puppy last. Taps with a nice faomy head and deep amber-golden color. The striking aroma wafts heavily with malt of earthy character. The heavy smooth body supports flavors of heavy malt and earthy, musty grape tones. The warming effect is undeniable. A sipper for sure. A beer that drowns the senses for quite a period of time post-taste.","beernut7","Dec 03, 2002"
4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"""Yo DAWG", the pour looks more like a ""Guinness", deep brown, as my vision is still blurred from the Fred. The head is Brobdingnagian in size, creamy in consistency, with lace that adheres to the glass in oversized sheets. Nose is caramel, deep earthy malt, smoky or better yet a peat and musky aroma, fresh ""Black Walnuts"" also come to mind. Front is malt, the top is middling in mouth feel, finish is penetratingly acidic, scrumptiously hopped and the aftertaste dry. The alcohol hits you like your 5 ""X" spouses looking for their back alimony! One damn fine beer, and I need to find a local source for Hair Of the Dog Beers, as they are Magnificent in their robustness, and as you know, I like these mean spirited beers.","Gusler","Nov 29, 2002"
4.37,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured very dark with no head at all. The smell is the best part as you can find apple,sherry and some great fruity flavors. The taste is much the same as the smell with a mild chocolate flavor coming through. Sip this after dinner but watch out because this one could hurt.","CharlesRiver","Nov 20, 2002"
4.44,4.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overly drinkable barleywines can be a dangerous thing, this beers name is dangerous. Goes down some smooth and creamy, with layers of sweetness that are no cloying at all caress the taste buds to bring them closer to heaven. Highly recommended especially on tap.","Jason","Nov 18, 2002"
4.5,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Deep brown to black (garnet) colour ( a bit murky), Off-white head, which sticks around, but is very thin. Hugely malty aroma, with some citric hops as a backdrop, winey, touches of oak, some anise, the nose smelt quite acidic, fruity (raisins) and a bit of fruitcake or something, some alcohol aswell. First thing you notice when you take a sip is the fruity/chocolatye sweetness (yes, hugely malty), leading into some nice coffee roastiness, then quite a bitter acidic finish with some piney/citric hops, a touch winey, a touch oaky, a touch citric, a touch of spice, even a touch smokey and perhaps a bit earthy. yep its complex, the palate wasn't as round as i would have liked, but theres so much good stuff happening in here, that it didn't really take off to many marks. Satisfying bitterness to back up the sweetness. Unlike anything that i've tried, but contains so many different characteristics from different styles of beer, hardcore. Man, i'd love to age a few bottles of this. Also noticed that the price was still on the label, $1.99 at Trader Joes,, i reckon that a pretty top deal for a beer of this calabre. Thanks Andrew for this, a top brew!!!","rastaman","Nov 13, 2002"
4.25,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Batch Number 48. Pours an opaque brown with absolutely no head, which lets one know that this one is big on ABV. Definitely some bottle conditioning by-products floating about. Smell is diverse with a variety of characteristics. It's rather sweet and fruity with some notes of chocolate. First sip indicates the plethora of flavors that are part of this ale. Adam attacked my palate with notes of raisins, figs, alcohol, chocolate, bittering hops, and more. Mouthfeel is rather syrupy and oily. The alcohol content presents itself toward the bottom of the glass, decreasing drinkability a bit. It's good now, but it can certainly stand to mellow out a bit with some cellaring. Sip and enjoy.","Jon","Oct 23, 2002"
4.87,14.3,4.5,5,5,4,5,"Easily the most drinkable double digit ABV beer I have had.  Not for beginners, like Stone Arrogant Bastard, this beer just wants to kick your ass.  My suggestion is to let it.","dolem98","Oct 06, 2002"
3.84,-9.9,3,4,4,4,3.5,"Big malty aroma with a hint of belgian yeastiness, but not really. Flavor is big on the malt with chocolate and other dark flavors predominant. Not much in the way of hops, but what was there fit in nicely. Surprisingly you get a bit of burn from the alcohol despite the fact I've had stronger beers that left no burn.","aracauna","Oct 06, 2002"
4.17,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Dark brown in color with very little foam on the head. When I first tasted Adam it had a sweet and smoky taste on the palette. Complex in flavor, but the sweetness and the smokey after taste was a bit to much for my palatte.","BeerManDan","Sep 28, 2002"
4.47,4.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Batch #53:  This beer poured a very dark brownish black color.  No light is getting through this one.  It didn't form much of a head, but maybe I had it a too cold or didn't pour it right.  It was a light tan color and did leave some lace.  The aroma was of raisins and cherry, malt and some chocolate.  Interesting flavor of a smokey fruit.  It has a medium body and a glossy, somewhat burnt finish.  A hint of the alcohol when it goes down.  A nice beer that is probably better at a warmer temp. and with some aging.","Wildman","Sep 10, 2002"
4.55,6.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"An excellent beer although Batch #53 seems to need to age a little bit. It's nowhere near as round and supple as it can get.","NeroFiddled","Aug 15, 2002"

4.42,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Great dark, dark brown color, excellent firm head with rings of ""mountains"". Murky, with lots of sediment chunks. Burly aroma, with raisin and cherry tones. Deep flavor, like a java with prune liquor and some complex grassy tastes. Taste is somewhat like a better-controlled Bell's Batch 5000 without the smoke. Hops are very flavorful, together with lack of heavy carbonation, add to a long lasting and changing flavor. Just dang interesting in the mouth. Alcohol is notable but the brew is more heavy than sticky. Excellent beer!","ADR","Jun 10, 2002"

Wonderful aroma featuring a smoky mustiness along with a boubon like smell...dark brown in color..with a nice creamy head that settles and remains..a plethora of flavors...a real herbal/earthy texture...some notes of blackberry, and wood aged bourbon...sweet but bombed with hops as well...it balances nicely..smokiness on the finish...","ZAP","May 23, 2002"
4.65,9.2,4,4,5,4.5,5,"This beer is a little charged up.  You need to be careful pouring this one.  Pours a big rocky tan head. Has very good head retention.  Color is close to black.  Aroma is of earthy hops and slight smoke.  The first thing your buds tell you with this one is that it is one great brew.  The mouthfeel is very light for an old ale.  This is incredibly easy drinking for a 10% a/v old ale.  It has a ""belgian-like"" alcohol taste present.  Very mellow.  Has some slight roasted tones and beautiful hop character.    Was well worth the $3+ I spent on 12 oz.  Top Notch.","Bighuge","Mar 31, 2002"

Roasted malt, chocolate, slight whiskey, and slight smokey wood characteristics in the taste.  I know there is a lot of alcohol in this beer but I can't find it in the taste.  Very subtle hop character.  This is one awesome beer.  A lot of subtle characteristics that just beg you to analyze them.  A nice beer but not for the faint of heart.","Murph","Mar 22, 2002"
