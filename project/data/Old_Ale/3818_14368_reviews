"Pretty hoppy for an old ale -- more like a strong APA."
""
""
"Not a hoppy beer guy"
""
""
"Overall:  This is not one of my preferred beers from Southern Tier, or in general, in fact.  It just has too much hoppy bitterness for my tastes.  Hop heads should love it, though."
""

"Nice color, good mouth feel, good tasting without a bunch of overpowering spiciness to muck up the experience."

"Again I am confused by Southern Tier with the styling of this seasonal ale.  It taste more like an IPA than an ale.  I had this problem with their KRAMPUS beer as well.  Infact, I am having trouble separating the taste of this and KRAMPUS.  They taste way too similar in my opinion.  Anyway, this is the second sampling from Southern Tier that is a good beer, but I am not tasting anything different or distinguishable.  They all taste like IPA's even though they are supposed to be a different style.  I am not saying that this OLD MAN is a bad beer.  It is a good beer.  I find it to be very bitter and hoppy which I like.  I wouldn't call it an ale or old ale though.  I guess my expectation from this company is to always blow me away since my first two Southern Tier samplings were their PUMKING and WARLOCK which are phenomenal!  This is a solid beer if you like hoppy, bitter beers with all the characteristics of an IPA.  I just wished for more of a creamy ale."

"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and I thought it was pretty close to being an average example of the style, I know this style always doesn't have to be on the stronger side, but i felt like this beer was missing some of that complexity that I look for in the style and when it came down to it I didn't find it to be too memorable.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little watery, pretty crisp, slight prickly, not too filling and the taste didn't do a great job of holding my attention, one is enough for me any more than that and I would start to get bored with it.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance, this was a pretty good looking beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel and that it was jut a little bland and not to memorable, those aspects held this beer back.  I don't think I would buy this beer again, but I wouldn't turn one down.  I can't say I would recommend this as a good Old Ale, but it may be worth a try to see what you think of it.  All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer, it didn't really have anything that made it stick out to me and it reminded me a lot of how an IPA tastes when it get too old without that stale malt aspect.  This one was falls right in the middle for Southern Tier and it's very average for an Old Ale.  I just wasn't that into this beer, better luck next time guys."

"Far too bitter for my liking. Much better winter ales out there."
""
""
""
"This just hit me as really damn good. Nice deep amber in the glass, and nice hints of pine on the nose. Many of the same notes (IMHO) as Brown Shugga, just not as sweet or strong. Really set off a nice winter evening with the wife. I am really glad I tried this one!"
"Nice beer to start out but has a bitter ending to it that I am not sure can be equated to the hops."
""
"Had better winter warmers from local breweries, no need to keep this middle of the road example from across the country."

"Bad after taste!"

"Overall / Drinkability:  Overall this isn't like any Old Ale I've had.  The hops and malts play very nicely together but I'd have a hard time calling this an Old Ale.  Maybe a very hoppy Amber or just an APA with some unique malt / hop combos.  So while overall it isn't an Old Ale to style, it is a beer that grew on me over the course of the glass.  It went quite well with food (pork chops with roasted potatoes & sweet potatoes) and by itself was rather tasty.  I think if another one was offered I'd probably take it telling me its drinkability is actually pretty good, and dangerously so at 7% ABV."

"I feel like this is a pretty solid brew but serving it as an Old Ale is just a bit of a stretch to me. It has some Old Ale characteristics but to me it drinks like a balanced sweet Amber. That being said, the interplay between the toasted sweet malts and the hops is pulled off quite nicely."

"Pours In a pint glass from a 12oz bottle with a nice head and leaves good lacing. Pours a nice cooper color with nice spice notes. A little hoppy sort of a winter IPA. Nice on a cold winter day. Husband is having the great divide hibernation ale but I like mine better."

"always get this beer when it's out.  good blend of malt/hop flavors.  definitely a more Americanized old ale."

"BOD 9/24/14.  Clear amber pour with a slight garnet cast.  Outstanding massive head, lacing and retention.  Very light nose of sweet malt (biscuit and caramel) with hints of tropical citrus and either plum or pear.  Light medium body that has a nice oily texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the finish.  The flavor profile is of normal intensity, fairly balanced and has a bit of complexity.  It begins with hop flavor (pine and citrus rind) that flows into a medium bitterness.  As the bitterness fades, mostly caramel sweetness is noted.  This sweetness lingers through the finish and becomes totally caramel in nature.  The finish leaves you with a nice alcohol burn at the back of the throat and a ""peppery"" note with a grain alcohol residual flavor."

"Taste: this is where this beer surprises me I was expecting a beer that was generic but I found d this had the complexity of a dips but darker I got sweet raisin with apricot fruitiness ...its not a flavor bomb Luke dogfish head 120min IPA or Keegan ales super kitty but it has legs. I think this WL deff be my new go to winter beer...THANK YOU SOUTHERN TIER"

"Strong brew. Another great beer by Southern Tier."
""
""
""

"Good tasting beer in the front and finish.  Not too spiced for a winter, which is welcome. A bit of a lingering aftertaste which I credited to a OK feel.  I would revisit this beer - another good - very good offering from southern tier."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The malt characters play up first in the taste and the hop finish a mildly bitter and earthy. But I am also picking up that odd sort of peanut butter thing."

"Soft nose of toasted malts under a thin, subtle blanket of piney hops.  Much more hop-forward in the taste, with the malt and hints of caramel quickly surrendering to pine and dried floral hops along the sides of tongue.  Too unbalanced, especially given the style."
""
""
""
"Pours a clean copper color with plenty of sticky fizz. Piney hops , bitterness, tea leaf malt and a meaty smoky aroma. There's a good balance of bitter hops and biscuity malt with some backdrop of molasses and dark fruit. The hop character seems mostly bitter and the malt has that tea leaf, biscuit and caramel flavor. This is an Old Ale? Seems like a decent Pale Ale."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/30/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, toffee, orange zest, floral, grass, light pine, light raisin, nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity of dark/bready malt and moderate hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, toffee, orange zest, floral, grass, pine, herbal, light raisin, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine/floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, toffee, orange zest, floral, grass, herbal, light pine, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy/piney hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a light creamy and moderately sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Old ale. Good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy/piney hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O: Southern Tier is one of my favorites and they produce some to quality brews but this old ale was an IPA in disguise. Maybe I need to try so more old ales to make sure im not confused. Nonetheless its a great beer."

"Pours from the bottle with a deep amber color and a light, foamy tan head. The aroma is initially dominated by caramel and sweet bread, with the woodsy, earthy hop profile being comparatively soft at first, but the hop aromatics become more dominant as the beer warms. The flavor is similarly rich and malty but well-balanced by the mildly-astringent woodsy hops. I would say that the taste is crisp, but not in a refreshing way. Rather, it tastes like standing outside at night after a new snow. The mouthfeel has a solid, somewhat resinous feel, with a fine, soft carbonation that lifts the flavors up rather than obscuring them. Overall, this beer is hearty and flavorful without being overly assertive or syrupy, making a nice complement to cool winter weather."

"O - A good winter warmer. Not great, but good none the less"
"O-I enjoyed this beer, but it was hoppy for an old ale, and not as much malt flavor."

""

"This is not a sticky, thick old ale that coats the mouth and finishes with an whisp of alcohol. Really belongs in the Red Ale category. If you are looking for a real old ale- look elsewhere but it's a fine beer that's unoffending rather than a wow beer. Put it this way, if I saw this at a holiday party I'd be thrilled to not have to drink Bud. The problem is, if I want an old ale - this ain't it (I'll get a 4-pack of Old Stock for almost the same price). Other than that, Celebration is a cheaper/better beer. I don't see a reason to buy this again."

"O: This is an alright beer; I picked it up because it was the only beer down to one bottle, and it turns out that wasn't a bad call. Not a favorite but if I was having a big Christmas gathering I might pick up a sixer of this for variety's sake."
""

"Overall, this is the lowest %abv old ale I've had (in fact I think it's the only one under 10%) but it still holds up pretty well against its high-gravity brethren. Good flavor, and still that 7% isn't anything to sneeze at, and a few of these will certainly warm you up on a winter's night."

" This is my second time and it is better . Overall this is a pleasant ale with some surprising complexity."

"Overall- I like this beer, got a case last year after digging my six pack so much. It really isn't a ""traditional"" old ale, but its good and worth a try and it fits the season well."
"Overall, the best thing about this brew was its flavoring. While the aroma was nice and fruity, it gave way to a much more complex and bittered, with bite and metallic grittiness to the bone. All the while the fruit was echoing across the top, but dynamically, and not as strongly as the nose would suggest. This is not what we would classify as your typical “old ale”, but it did show strength of musk and depth to the grain bill throughout. This is one of Southern Tier’s last “major-line” beers for us to rate, and we feel it fits the pedigree well. We’ve probably been avoiding this guy in particular for so long on account of some local friends warning us away from it, but as locals ourselves, we will stand by this beer as a decent upstate seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This would be great if I could pick up more distinct flavors but at least with this bottle it's a no go. I'll certainly be revisiting it next year to see if this is vintage or bottle variation"

"Atmosphere is really nice. Really nice foamy head, plenty of lacing. Nose is bitter and pungent. A little hoppy with earthy roasted malt grains ans some bitter pecan. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: in my opinion - not a good representation of the style. The flavor isn't bad but why not call this a strong ale?"
""
""
""
""
"This was a cheerful winter ale that wasn't a spice bomb. The spices were light and the bread never ended. The hops gave it a vibrance and it drank with a bit of caramel sweetness. pretty nice and before you know it you will have had 3 or 4 of these."

"Old Man Winter Ale poured a orange-ish amber color with an off-white head. The only really distinct note in the aroma was the malt. I could not detect any sense of spiciness or notes typical of a winter ale. In the taste, one gets notes of orange, some mild spice, and alcohol. For a winter beer, I thought the mouthfeel was fairly thin. The finish was a tart malty after that brings a fairly bland winter ale to a head. I love winter ales, but will pass on this one in the future."

"Wow, some not so good comments on this brew...I am an IPA and a English/Scottish Ale fan. i am definitely an amateur with all the lingo....however i know what i like....Old Man is a very nice beer that you will not be disappointed with....it has a brownish tint with a light head....but who care, it is taste and ABV....you cannot go wrong with this beer as it has a little darker taste, tad bit floral, but not so much...then follows with that of a warming alcohol....what better feel do you need for winter time...perfect, only thing better would be a Skull Splitter"
""
""
"Lacks the character of an old ale, minus the booze. Pretty lackluster, and more bitter than anticipated. Just hot and bitter."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a solid Old Ale. Looks, smells, and tastes like it should I think."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a clear, medium brown color with a slight, beige head. Just some grains and slight hops in the aroma, but nothing too fancy. There are some floral tones and spices in the flavor. A decent overall texture as it finishes with a slightly bitter taste. It has a kind of dry taste overall that gives a unique tasting experience. This is my first Old Ale, so I don’t have anything to compare it to, but this is pretty good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"however, To ward off the cold, this beer does nicely. It really delivers a good hoppy brew, and I feel that it deserves a solid 4/5"

"Overall, another great tasting brew from southern tier, clean tastes good hop and bitterness profile; a nice winter take on the hopped up beer, and a unique take on the old ale style, maybe more clean and hoppy than i would have expected but a solid brew."
""
""
""
""
"O: Nicely bitter for an an Old Ale with a bit of hops in the and peppery phenols in nose. Many of Southern Tiers beer caters to the hops lover and this is one is no different but mostly just the bitterness. I has a good hops bitterness but still manages to be a bit on the sweeter side, though no where near as sweet as most Old Ales."

"A well hopped, not spiced, or overly sweet, winter seasonal. There is a well balanced blend of piney citrus sweet hops and subtle toasted malts that make this a wonderful winter ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""

""
""
"a nice winter warmer, sweet and malty, not to the point where it's undrinkable.. in fact it's quite enjoyable. a roasted nutty characteristic that satisfies the slight want for bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A pretty decent winter ale. It was a good blend of spice, roast and hop. Not bad and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it is a pretty good beer. Would definitely poor another, oops, just did. I enjoy the way that the taste is not overly complex and changes significantly from the front to back. It may be the gravity of beers I drink but I find the alcohol tones fairly laid back though you still get a nice warming in the tummy."

"Overall: I like this beer. It's somewhat genre-defying in its hop character, but overall it's a very tasty beer I would gladly have again."
""
"The hops have mellowed big-time, but still leave a nice resinous, semi-bitter aftertaste. I can taste both red and white grapes... not what was expected! Very drinkable for the style- not sweet, only a little sticky. It's too juicy; leaves me wanting characteristics of wood, DRIED grapes, alcohol warmth, etc... the stuff that makes me love the old ale style. It's wintery in the spiciness, sure, but could pass for an IPA, esp. fresh, in its lack of malt backbone or character. The malts are certainly detectable in the feel of the beer, despite being largely absent from the taste. I'd be happy to encounter a fresh one, just for comparison's sake."
"Given how strong this was, the alcohol wasn't that detectable and there was only a slight warming sensation as I worked my way through the bottle. This was an extremely accessible beer and for anyone unaccustomed to this style, this would be a great choice to start out with. Even in this freakish heat, I would have certainly popped open another had I had a second bottle with me."
""
"Overall, a nice winter drinker."
"Overall: Had it two years ago and thought it was fine. Two years later, it's still fine. I'd say I wouldn't revisit it, but, here I am, two years later."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a 14 oz. ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark copper color with a smaller white head with good retention. Smells of dark malt and not much else. Tastes of caramelized malt and slight floral hop, pretty tasty. Is a lighter body than expected, but is made pretty well with it holding its own and having good carbonation. Overall, an above average beer."
"330ml bottle.Pint glass.Enjoyed on nov´11.Light amber in color. Close,dense white color head.Good retention.Piney & slightly tosted malt aromas.Dry hop upfront. Sweet toasted malt. Flavorful body, malty tendency.Correct carbonation. Not bothering ABV. Smooth astringent finish.Fruity & resiny wood aftertaste.Nice drinkability."

"Overall: A nice drinkable beer, a little dry in the finish. Nothing special but an easy to enjoy beer"
"Overall, this beer seems to accomplish what it wanted. It is hardy, warm, and appropriate for winter."
""
""
"It's an interesting cross between an Old Ale and a Pale Ale, malty but hoppy."
""
"Overall, it's a decent beer. There's nothing to write home about, but it goes down relatively easily."
"O: Really flavorful winter beer, I would love to have regular access to this in the winter. Very nice beer, glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
"There is a slight bitter aftertaste, but there are hints of fruit too. For the decent abv, there is not event he slightest hint of alcohol in the aroma or taste and that's a big plus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clean yellow to orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a small caramel and gingerbread like smell. In the taste, coriander and cinnamon spices, and a malty gingerbread like flavor underneath it. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cinnamon to clean aftertaste. Spicy and malty, with a nice spice blend."
""
"Overall a good winter beer that will keep you warm."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- solid very drinkable winter brew, complex flavors but nit overpowering."
"Overall: A beer I find myself drinking every winter. Solid brew from a great brewery. Can't argue when its flying solo at $1.65"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really descent winter ale. Nice and spicy. Fire crackling good. This is one slow long traveler like the Mad Elf."
"O: this is good for the style and for me."
""
""
"Overall--There's not much excitement to this beer. I paired it with some abergele cheese, which gave it a little more purpose. I would strongly recommend drinking this beer with some sort of food. It doesn't have enough character as a standalone, but the flavors really popped when contrasted with the cheese."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty darn tasty, the hoppiness and maltiness are balanced quite well. Definitely a good cold weather ale, maybe just a bit too heavy to drink a lot of, strength notwithstanding."
""
"O – I would drink this winter brew anytime, really nice and refreshing."
""
"(D)- Not bad; a straightforward old ale. And a very approachable one for the style. A nice little winter styled ale for the season."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a clear medium red-orange amber. Half finger fine white head dissipates slowly, leaving lacing. Mild aroma of fresh light fruit and slight hops. Flavor is fairly subtle, dominated by roasted and bready malt, light citrus. Finishes rather dry with a bit of a phenolic flavor that may be contributed by the spicing and hops. Medium bodied. The main flavor is nice but the finish taste combination doesn't work for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was duped a bit into thinking Old Man Winter would be a darker more stout like beer. Very light for what I had been expecting. A decent beer, though if I knew it were going to be so light I would want some heavier hop to it. I would drink it again if I see it on top, but I would not buy a six pack again."
""
"This really shouldn't be called an Old Ale, although it's still a good beer in general. Stylistically, in color, bitterness, ABV, OG, and flavor, it's an IPA. Go for Northcoast Old Stock, Hibernation, Curmudgeon, Third Coast Olde Ale, or Jubilation if you want a real Old Ale."
""
""
""
""
"O- Not bad at all. Pretty well balanced. Booze is hidden. Very easy to drink."
""
""
"Appearance is pure amber, clear too. Smell is hoppy and nice with hints of malt. Mouthfeel, Ah, very nice leaves the tongue nicely. Like the hoppy finish. Taste is very nice, but this resembles an IPA over the winter ale. We will take it, because this is a nicely done beer. Overall this beer has a nice flavor and finish. The blend of hops is good and mixes well with the malts. Great burger beer."

"A fine mix of malts and earthy hops, There's a hint of cannabis in both the aroma and the flavor -- a reflection of the biological affinity of hops and cannabis? This ""winter ale"" is not spiced, at least not perceptibly so. Good, lingering, hoppy aftertaste."

"O: A well-hopped and unconventional old ale. Strikes me as a cross between an Extra Special Bitter and Winter Warmer. I look forward to savouring my last bottle."
""

"O= This really struck me more like an IPA without a strong hop flavor burst. I was expecting a lot more malt sweetness. The alcohol comes though in the finish, I would have preferred if this was sweetness. Despite all of this - not bad maybe as a winter warmer - but I wouldn't want to drink more than one at a time."

"Overall-a nice beer, as others have noted I'm not so sure it's really much of an old ale but it's a flavorful hoppy beer with some nice characteristics. Worth a try."
"Not truly an old ale to me but drinkable enough & certainly knocks the chill off ya"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops are present. Taste is piney hops up front, some alcohol, a touch of malts at the finish. Feels light in the mouth and overall this is a pretty good beer."

"D: Sort of in the same vein as SN Celebration. Less bright and caramelly sweet, darker & more toasty, drier malts, different hops (more tangerine & less grapefruit). More ESB rather than APA. A bit of an American style Old Ale. Great as a winter seasonal."
""
"O - This is an interesting beer, definately makes me think of opening presents under the christmas tree."

"This was an average brew that I don’t believe lived up to an Old Ale, but would make an excellent IPA for the winter season. One comparison that came to mind was Heavy Seas Winter Storm - based on the hop profile and bitterness levels. Also Winter Storm didn’t seem to match its style either (labeled as an ESB)."

"Pours a clear dull reddish orange with two fingers of dense white foam; sheet down the glass. Smell: caramelized sugar, slightly nutty, reminiscent of baking spices, herbal and piney hopping, a note of sweet plum as it warms. Taste: caramel, yeasty and slightly nutty, toasted grain - snappy, hopping is orange citrus, lemon peel and a little pineapple. Medium bodied and properly attenuated (woohoo ST!). Not sure what style... medium grav winter ale hybrid. Enjoyable for sure. Bottled 11/2/11."

"O - An average beer. I'm not familiar to reviewing old ales, but this one is still pretty tasty."
"This one was really good, but fell slightly short of my ""excellent beer"" 5 stars...this could really be because I have very high standards for Southern Tier as it is one of my favorite breweries. The flavor was really smooth and consistent from first to last sip but something was missing. I think the spice level could be turned up one click and it would be perfection. I am curious to see what this tastes like out of the bottle - seems to me beers like these tend to pack a higher punch of the intended flavors when poured from the bottle into a frosted pint glass then enjoyed."
"O: A nice winter seasonal. Not my favorite. I honestly don't prefer hoppy brews for winter seasonals, but this one balances the hops with a nice roasted malt and caramel profile, so it's all good."

"Overall, I LOVED this beer when I first had it at Thanksgiving a few weeks ago. Now, it doesn't taste like I thought it would. It tastes much like a German style beer - which I've learned to love, but wasn't expecting. I'm giving it a B."
"Pours a clear amber with a thin bit of head. Not too much going on in the way of nose, but it smells decent enough, a bit resiny. Spicy hops dominate the flavor with some bready malt. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth with a slight bit of stickiness. Overall, this is not what you'd expect from an 'old ale', it's kind of just a generic high abv amber. Decent, and drinkable, but nothing more."
""
"Overall it's not my fav from the brewery, but it's decent enough. It's only my second old ale so I reserve the right to alter my judgment of this one in the future."
""
"unique beer for sure, and excellent for winter. pours a dark copper color, like a tarnished penny, with a small vanishing head. smells a touch smokey, and strong. my brother described the taste to me as ""what an old man's hat would smell like"" in a good way. he was right, it has a sort of dusty burlap malty base with brighter winter flavors like pipe tobacco peppered throughout much like an old man's cap might have a fishing fly on the brim, a feather in the band, and some funny stain inside, this beer cannot be described in any other way now. its got a full bodied low carbonation mouthfeel which makes it quite easy to appreciate its complex character. my favorite winter beer of the season so far."
"There are much better examples of and Old Ale I would reach for before trying this again."
""
""
"Overall - This really wasn't what I was expecting but it was still a really good beer. It almost seems like this is their attempt at making a Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. It's got a surprising amount of hops and it's worth trying if you happen to see it on the shelves."
""
"Overall, it's not bad, but in comparison to other Old Ales and ST offerings, I feel it stumbles. It's still worth checking out though."
""
"Overall what a fantastic beer that makes me want to grab a fresh case for the winter. Very surprised this is an Old Ale since it drinks more like a hoppy Oktoberfest. Great beer!"
""
"Taste is sweet caramel and some pale. There is a pretty desent toasted or biscuit aspect. Hops are light. Drinks a medium weight on the palette and has a smooth sticky feel. I had Old Man on tap at Jamison Brew house and must say that it's way better out of the tap. Not bad out of the bottle but way better out of the tap."
""
"D: The alcohol isn't present on the palate, therefore drinks quite easily."

"A nice winter release from Southern Tier, and definitely different than most winter offerings. But I prefer the darker, maltier, fuller-bodied and stronger ales that this season brings."
"My pour created two dense fingers of deep mocha-tan head with excellent retention. Color was a deep brownish-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose smelled of snow-covered pine forest and I was in love! Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but the taste was clean and minty on the tongue. Who need mouthwash when I've got this in my glass? Finish was breathtaking, but in the right way. It was a big beer, to be sure, but not hot like the Cigar City Winter Warmer Warmer Winter mess that I was faced with on Friday night. It was a very pleasant jump start to the day."
""
""
"Yummy beer, but it's just not what unexpected from an old ale or a winter warmer. Not disappointed but underwhelmed."
"o-its not horrible by any mean. but it is a somewhat let down from S.T. as i have grown to enjoy more and more of their beer this year. will try again in the future but look more forward to their fall releases than this winter one."
"Overall, I would say this is a good take on an Old Ale, definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe I'll revisit this one someday, but for now I feel as if it isn't even worth drinking the rest of it....hopefully this is just a bad batch..."
"Overall: A pretty interesting take on an old ale. Flavors are pretty laid back but whats there is tasty and well balanced."
""
""
"O: This was an enjoyable beer but not exactly what I had in mind when I was thinking old ale. The malt/hop flavors were well blended and made for a good drinking experience. I might pick this one up again."
""
"O: A very nice Winter Ale... I'm a huge fan of Southern Tier's more subtle beers. I've been drinking so many extreme brews that these kind of medium-body ales are becoming my refreshment drink. It's late fall in NYC and they sell this around the corner, I'll definitely drink a few more throughout the cold season."
"Pours a reddish copper with a frothy off white head that leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is hoppy, sweet, roasted malt, with some spice in there as well. Taste has a nice malt presence that revolves around sweet hop flavors. Finishes with a nice malt backbone. A nice medium mouthfeel, very smooth, and not a highly noticeable ABV. Overall a nicely done winter ale, great flavors, and well balanced. Very tasty and enjoyable."

"Pours a dark and hazed copper with moderate cap of khaki froth, decent retention and good sticky lacing at the top of the glass. Scent is hop forward, lots of orange zest, and the malt comes across as more toasted than sweet, decent lingering spice notes on the rear. Full flavored beer leads with the hops again, mostly citrus with firm notes of spicy and piney, malt backbone is quite deep ranging from dry and tannic roasted grains, toasted and nutty to lightly sweet and caramely, again a decent spice profile lingers on the end. Medium bodied and dry finish. Overall, a style bender for sure... firm hop and malt character and a nice splash of winter spice."

"The appearance was a deep burnt orange with little head and no retention. The smell was not very strong or definitive at all. There are rich malts up front with a good dose of hoppiness in the finish. A reasonably good effort from a brewery that I like more than most."

"I really dislike this one. It is nearly to the point where I may just drain pour it. This isn't for me at all."
"Starts to crackle and pop immediately as I pour. Very loud beer. Pours a vibrant copper/amber color and is nice and clear. Smells of a ton of roasted malts and even some hazelnuts. Very well balanced, silky and big bodied. As expected a nice hop presence despite it being a winter brew. Butterscotch and roasted malt sweetness up front. These tastes wash away pretty quickly though as a spicy hop presence sweeps through. Also has some burning wood like characteristics to it. This slightly burnt characteristic lingers in the mouth a little. Makes you feel as if you've been sitting by a fire all day. Definitely could make for a more than solid winter session beer!"
"A viscous iced-tea colored liquid with a minimally satisfying off-white head is off-set by the encouragingly hoppy smell. There is an excellent balance between the hop and malty taste lending to a medium mouthfeel. Tastes like a hop bud, lightly coated in Carmel, is sitting on my tongue. In conclusion, I could drink a lot of this very easily."
"Not a bad winter beer. The malt has a unique character. Some nice spiciness without any of the usual cinnamon/nutmeg stuff. Haven't had many old ales, but I'm pretty sure they tend to be darker, sweeter and thicker than this."
"Maybe not an old ale under ""British"" but without a doubt, an excellent beer, all in balance."
"O- A very tasty beer. A good example of how beers can have big flavors but stay balanced."
"O: Old man is a winter ale that packs a punch. The bitter hops are stars from start to finish.Though the alcohol is modest for winter beers, 7.7%, it is noticeable, though some of the edge wears off as the beer warms. While winter beers are not always ""balanced," this beer seems like it could use a bit more of that very trait. The hops consume the beer, and the finish is harsh because of the alcohol; it could be blended better."
"Poured a coppery amber color with a nice, solid white head, that receded to a patchy layer and left some spotty lacing. Aroma of fresh hops, mildly bready, and somewhat vegetal...I almost get hints of peas and carrots? Crisp taste, initial tones of toffee, quickly overcome by fresh piney hops, pith, and wood-roasted malts. Pleasantly bitter, providing a rather dry finish. Medium body, and quite drinkable. Not what I'd have expected from something labeled a ""winter ale," but there you go."
"Overall - An excellent and nicely spiced example of a Winter Warmer.. recommended..."
"O: Actually quite enjoyed this beer. Unlike most in the style was pretty easy drinking and smooth."
"Overall I was a bit let down by this. I have loved everything from Southern Tier, but I barely liked this one. Don't go beating down the door for this one, but not a bad try if the effort isn't great. Thanks to merc7186 for this extra."
"Deep amber in color, very clear, with a white head that left some lacing on the glass. Aroma of caramel malts, citrus hops, and spice—very nice. Flavor of caramel malts with some alcohol in the finish. I didn't notice the hops or spice in the flavor. After it warmed up, I tasted some smoky malts. Medium bodied with an effervescent mouth feel. Very drinkable."
"Overall not bad, interesting malts and syrup sweet flavors, nothing spectacular though, a nice would be winter ale mid hurricane without power."
"D - Very drinkable. The spices and the booze feel nicely balanced against the other flavors in the beer, especially after six months of aging."
"One of the better (domestic) Xmas-time brews out there. Surely give it a try when it's out."
"O - Awesome brew! Held together wonderfully with time. I would love to try this brew fresh! Awesome brew collected as an extra in a great trade."
"Seems a bit more than 7.2%."
"O: A well balanced, easily drinkable, well put together winter ale. Just enough alcohol to make it interesting."
"Old Man Winter in my opinion was very good. The beer poured out as a reddish brown color, pretty dark looking. The smell was sweet with malts and perhaps some brown sugar. The taste was sweet also with a slight spice to it. There is a really nice caramel flavor upfront in this beer that realy keeps me going back for the next sip. The mouthfeel is a bit thick which I enjoy too. Overall I like this brew a lot and I look forward to having it again some day."
"Not as full-bodied as one might expect. Carbonation is pretty strong. Finish is dry. Though there is an aspect of warming, it fades pretty quickly."
"Again overall not bad at all, I really enjoyed it, and while not being the best one of the night, was certaing more then deserving overall. Very solid offering here."
"This is a sweet, tasty beer that hides its 7% abv well. Easy to drink and would go well with a hearty meal."
"Very enjoyable but with a 7.2% abv it's more of a sipper than a session beer."
"O: Overall the beer was pretty good. It resembled much more of an IPA than a winter ale. I would have preferred a little less hops ore more sweet flavor to balance out the hoppyness. Any IPA drinker will definitely enjoy this beer."
"O - Easy drinking, begs to be drank with food. Meaty stews would be perfect."
"Taste has just a tiny hit of fruit, and is malty with a bit of hopped bitterness. Quite rich and a little creamy, it has a little booziness that almost implies an even higher alcohol level than the 7.2%. Not tremendously complex, it nonetheless balances the malts and hops nicely. It is very pleasant and is a nice winter ale to warm one during the cold months."
"Overall, misses the mark as an old ale. Good winter warmer/ESB (americanized)."
"D - I was really surprised with this winter ale...I think this would have to be one of my favorite winter warmers this year...a great balance between the malts and hops and it allows both to be showcased"
"D: I was expecting an Old Ale so this was quite a surprise. It was enjoyable and certainly more so than the other hoppy offerings from ST."
"Drinkability- Very different from the time I had on tap. This one actually was tougher to drink. Whenever there is a beer which is Medium bodied and above, I always say these are the toughest to drink. Who knows! I enjoyed this greatly again!"
"Iechyd da!"
"A dark copper color with a fair off-white head and plenty of lacing like a wall on the pint glass. The aroma suggests skunk malt and evergreen hops. Nice and swampishly delectible. The flavor brings heavy juniper hop and honey cabbage malt. A solidly medium body brew with medium carbonation and a easy feel to go with it. Slightly dry on the finish. A very satisfying and reasonably drinkable brew."
"D: I thought this one was good. Very easy to drink, probably 4-6 of these easily. For those interested in old ales, this would be a good starter. The only downer is it was not that interesting to me."
"Picked up a single to try, this pretty much tastes like a standard pale ale or lighter hopped IPA. Nothing too special going on with malts or spicing like you might expect in a winter themed beer."
"[25 Dec 2007] Southern Tier Old Man Winter Ale is clear and tawny with a small off-white head. The aroma is of dark roast, sweet sugar and perhaps spice. There is grain in the nose. It is light-to-medium bodied and crisp. The flavor is dark, sweet and bitter with almost a smokiness. I don't think these guys make any bad beers."
"Pours a deep reddish bronze with one finger of off-white head with decent retention. Aromas are predominantly of sweet malts, reminiscent of toffee; a bit of a one-note-wonder. Flavors redeem the simplicity of the nose by bringing in several austere layers of taste. There's something about the overall effect of the flavor that makes me think of a Baby Ruth candy bar: nuttiness, caramel, and chocolate. As far as old ale's are concerned, it's one of the more drinkable members of the style in that it avoids being cloying."
"An old ale brewed for the season that grows old - I love the idea. I'm also pretty fond of the beer. Old Man strikes an uncommon but appreciated compromise between bold, elegant flavours and quaffable, carefree drinkability by blending the cold weather comfort of rich, sweet maltiness with the sunny, tropical goodness of hops. Nicely done."
"Mouthfeel is medium at best, and the high amount of carbonation that I was assuming from the look of this thing isn't represented at all. Not a huge ABV compared to some of the other old ales I have had, but drinkable nonetheless. There is some alchojol present after it leaves, but just enough to let you know your drinking a beer. "
"D - really quite drinkable for a winter weight beer without being ponderous"
"D: Very drinkable. I could walk into a bar and drink this one all night. Good beer."
"Pours a modest one finger head of off white foam. Nice clear light brown body. A good ring of lacing and some big bubbles remain. Smells initially of some earthy english hops. I also get some carmel, slight citrus, sweet malt. On the taste I get some carmel toffee sweetness at first. Then some resinous piney bitterness. A pleasant neutral moist finish. Maybe some smoky notes in there too. Light carbonation. Medium bodied. I enjoy the finish this neutral balanced clean finish. A touch of lingering bitterness but I can drink this quite easily. Nice job ST. $1.75 for the single."
"The heavy pine flavor of the hops combine with the taste of bitter orange rind to give this beer an intense start. Light caramel provides some sweetness, but it takes the back seat to the bitter qualities. The raisin flavor comes out before the finish, which is also when the alcohol is most noticeable. Spices are also present near the back end. Overall, a little more bitter than what I prefer in an Old Ale. I would have liked a stronger sweet/caramel balance to give this the depth that I usually enjoy in this style. Mouthfeel was very smooth and enjoyable."
"this was a nice suprise for a winter warmer. Excellent malt base with a nice bitter hop finish to offset caramel notes. not over spiced as a lot of winter warmers. I expected a degree of quality from Southern Tier and was not disappointed. An excellent choice while sitting outside on the deck on a winter's eve."
"A solid winter ale for the season."
"D-Very drinkable, could have used a little more spice-flavors for a winter beer, more hops than I was expecting (although that was not a bad thing)"
"Pours equal part brown and amber with a thick looking off-white head. Lacing really sticks to the glass and the head retention is good as well. Aroma was lacking. Had to reach to get a bit of caramel, some earthy hops and spice. Earthy flavor. Initially a bit of sweet toffee/caramel malt, but bitter earthy hops and a bit of spice push the malt to the background. Interesting blend. Thick, creamy mouthfeel."
"D: This sixer I bought will take me no time to finish. This is an exceptional beer and it could rival SN's Celebration Ale for my favorite winter seasonal."
"just as a note this is my first review...thanks"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimpled mug. Bottle pours clear dark brown/caramel color with off white head. It laces the glass as you drink it. Aroma is citrus hops and tobacco. Mouthfeel is a touch thin. Flavor follows the nose. Citrus hops, almonds, tobacco, caramel, and some spice. Maybe ginger and cinnamon. One of my favorite winter brews."
"I drank this beer in a matter minutes. Serious drinkability! Sort of a different spin on a traditional winter brew. The hops are predominant upfront which blends nicely with the roasted malts, pine, grapefruit, orange, lemon, and mild caramel. Like many Southern tier brews, this one is a step up from a traditional winter seasonal."
"I could session the hell out of this - another well done brew from Southern Tier."
"Good mouthfeel and very drinkable. This was one of my favorites this past Christmas."
"D: Pretty drinkable, considering the hoppiness and abv... a good / interesting take on a winter ale."
"Drinkability - Not to bad was impressed with a Witer Ale that wasn't overly spiced , decent hops with a good malt backing."
"Enjoy!"
"Amber colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is nutty and hoppy.Taste are hops,dark fruits and nuts.This beer goes down relatively smooth for a beer of 7%ABV.Just like the bottle says an ale that is probably best during the cold winter months.I would recommend and purchase again."
"This is a very drinkable brew. It has a nice balance that gives it the great bitter/sweet flavors. Its a great winter style brew, that would be great to have on a cold winter night. The ABV, though not high, gives a nice warming feel as drink it."
"Southern Tier Brewing Company--OLD MAN Seasonal Winter Ale--Brewed with 3 Varieties of Hops and 2 Types of Malts--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 8.00% ABV. 65 IBU's? (3.0 / 5.0) Lacy white lasting light head. No sediment. Clear dark copper amber thin rich color. Slightly earthy toasted no spice mild hop front. Dry sweet thin textured fully fermented toasted caramel body. Crisp dry rich hot hop spice end. Big bitter but unbalanced. Sampled 1/14/2011. 6-Pack purchased for $9.25 @ PCC--Fremont, Seattle on 12/2/2010."
"A great tasty, hearty beer. Lots of complex sweet flavours well handled."
"Maybe I'm a little too hyped since most ST brews I've had have been kick ass. Hoped for a heavy duty Old ale or Winter Warmer."
"Taste is where this is most disappointing. Hops overwhelm (though aren't that strong) any of the characteristic malt for this style, or even some of the vinous or fruity flavors. This tastes more like an IPA to me, which is fine, but its not the right style. Mouthfeel is light and its fairly smooth."
"4.0 D: This isn't a bad beer. The mouthfeel could benefit from a few changes, but the taste is good enough and it gives a hoppy bitterness bite that is a welcome change from most of the beers of this style out there."
"Medium-full body with the malt and hops trading blows all the way to the finish, where the hops edge it out by a hair."
"D: I found this to be a readily drinkable beer. The balance of malts and hops meant that it was neither too sweet or too bitter. Just a great beer for a cold night."
"The mouthfeel is alright, it's medium thickness and carbonation. The drinkability is alright as it goes down, but the overwhelming aftertaste really hurts it. As a Southern Tier fan, I'm a little let down by Old Man. It's just not very good, the flavor never quite meshes together correctly. It's almost like they threw everything they had in the bottle, and it never quite works right."
"Solid drinkability. I like the bitterness of it and would drink it plenty."
"Dark amber with a modest off white head that recedes quickly and leaves a good amount of lacing mostly on the upper half of the glass. Aroma is floral and caramel malts. Taste is semi sweet caramel with a good portion of pink grapefruit bitterness. Alcohol is quite well hidden. Mouthfeel is good with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is perhaps too good and this brew will send you to bed early if you try to drink too many. Excellent Winter Warmer without the cloying sweetness of many of that style."
"Another brew not available in CO I was glad to try while home for the holidays. Pours a deep, clear, amber with a tan head. Head is big and foamy, leaving some nice lacing as it slowly recedes. Big malty nose with a pleasantly surprising hop character. Taste is lots sweet malt and dark fruits up front with a nice hoppy bite to the finish. Alcohol is well hidden as there is only a subtle solvent like flavor that actually plays nice with everything else. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Glad I got to try this and would definitely drink it again."
"This one doesn't really fit the bill of an ""old ale", but makes a good one to enjoy in the winter time."
"D- a sipper nice winter warming brew"
"Pours a clear, amber color. One and one half inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of earthy malt, hops, slight grain, sweet malt, and a hint of floral aromas. Does not seem to fit the style of an Old Ale, but it's labeled as a Winter Ale on the bottle. It is much closer to a Winter Warmer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of earthy malt, sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of grain, hint of citrus hop, and hint of floral. Overall, good appearance and blend, but lacking in body."
"Drinkability: A very nice winter beer that hits the spot on a cold December night."
"Feels medium to full in body, decently carbonated for a smooth crispness, and ends a bit on the dry side."
"D- Very easy to drink with the balance"
"Nice full-bodied beer good for winter drinking. Thick, tasty, belly-warming. Has taste of a good old craft beer without an overpowering alcohol taste. Very good for one or two, but certianly not something you can stick with if drinking a few beers for the night"
"This is a surprise, I picked up a six pack and had no idea what to expect. Good stuff, and drinkable."
"Some complexity here, but the rousing lack of sweetness and overdose of back palate bitterness make it sharper than it needs to be. Still a tasty brew and an interesting one as well."
"Drinkability is damn good, this really is a tasty beer, but really I'm not sure why its been shoe-horned into the old ale slot."
"Poured into a snifter. The beer pours dark mahogany with a no head. Real nice color on this though. Lots of malts up front but there is kind of an off smell that I can't quite put my finger on. It's kind of fishy. It ruins it for me. Not a lot going on in this one. Slightly bitter in the end but the big malt profile I was expecting really seems to get lost in there somewhere. This really doesn't seem to have the characteristics I've come to expect in an old ale. The mouthfeel is a bit watery. Just a weak example of the style. There isn't much of a chance that I'll finish this one."
"""That old man winter..."" (That was sung in a deep baritone.) It pours a clear garnet topped by a finger-and-a-half of light ecru foam. The nose comprises caramel, light grapefruit, and some chocolate deep in the very, very back. On the tongue, strong pine and orange peel do battle with some slightly smoky toffee. When all is quiet again, a pall of mint hangs over the fallen. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a solid brew, but not necessarily something I can honestly see myself going after regularly."
"D: Not bad, similar to Boulevard Nut Cracker ... but nowhere near as good."
"D - All around a interesting Winter Ale. Southern Tier did this one right and steered away from the norm. Good spice still but hops and malts really steal the show."
"This beer has a wonderful weight and mouthfeel. The citrus hoppiness is perfectly balanced with a rich malt finish. I enjoyed the lingering flavor of roasted chocolate malts on the very end of the finish. This is an absolutely perfect winter ale that's void of any spice. Awesome. This might be my new favorite winter seasonal. I strongly recommend this beer to anyone who doesn't like overly spiced beers."
"Pours a copper color with two fingers worth of head that faded slowly with thick lacing. The aroma is a mix of butter and caramel over piney hops. Creamy with a lot of malt sweetness up front giving way to some astringent bitterness on the back end. The finish is fairly fast and slightly drying and the body is on the heavy side of medium. Overall, this is a nice, hearty beer, perfect for cold winter days."
"D-well the tastes stay, this isn't a bad beer really. it seems that a lot of the negative aspects drift away and i start to pick up the better tastes more, especially the vanilla."
"At the Mohawk House in Sparta, NJ. Poured a transparent amber into a tulip, with less than a finger of white; average retention and lacing. Very little visible carbonation. The nose consisted of distant spices and some candy fruit; almost like a bland fruitcake. The taste revealed a very subtle sour fruit and candi sugar midpalate, with a weak, semi-sweet finish. The body was surprisingly thin as well; borderline watery, with no carbonation. While this beer seems non-offensive enough to session, I was actually very disappointed with the lack of flavor after hearing so much hype about it."
"D - A very unique offering from Southern Tier... Not nearly as lush or malty as I typically expect for the style, but rather a very refined hop forward offering... I would drink on again in the future, but not something I would necessarily recommend or buy again next season..."
"Overall, a very good beer, worth some effort to find."
"D - I like it out the bottle, but I think it will be better out of a tap. Next time I'm in the Jamestown area, I will try this one at their tap room."
"I like this one from Southern Tier, and will probably sample it again at some point."
"Overall this is the favorite seasonal ale I've tried for the winter second only to Sierra Nevada Celebration."
"Overall, a great beer from Southern Tier. Thus far I haven't been wowed by any of their beer outside of the Imperial line but this one does a good job. This is one of my favorite Winter Ales now and wholeheartedly recommend it. Cheers!"
"D: This was a very good brew to do in a tasting, But I would not come back to this brew or even get more to see how they age, because fresh was a little bit of a weak, let down. Goes down easy."
"D: Not all that high. The aftertaste began to get to me after a while."
"D- This beer is good but a little more bland then what I would like in my warmers. A nice shot by Southern Tier but just not quite there. The ABV is not really there until the backend which is nice."
"Not a bad beer; just not for me."
"Overall, I love ST. But I'll skip this one from now on. Its not bad, just not memorable."
"Drinkability -- This beer is no Old Ale, though Southern Tier refers to this as such. However, this drinks more like an Amber Ale: toasty malt and substantial hop flavors. As an Old Ale, it's rubbish, but as a"
"Yeah. No. Not horrible. But this is not a beer I'll ever come back to. Just not my thing I guess."
"The mouthfeel is too carbonated for me and I really feel that the flavor is diluted. It's a shame, as it had a lot of promise."
"Notes: Even though I am not a big fan of the style, this is not the best example of the style. The better ones, again in my opinion, have a heavier sweet malt profile to them."
"Bottle poured into a Sam Adams ""free founding subscriber"" glass. Nice head - a lot of lacing on the glass. Color on the light end of a brown ale, dark end of an IPA. Smell is subdued - some sweetness from the malt and hoppy, earthy tones underneath. Carbonation is just right - and the taste is like it smells. Blend of strong brown ale and an IPA maybe. One of my favorite of the winter ales I have tried this year."
"A great winter warmer from a dependable brewery. This is like Anchor's Christmas Ale's younger brother, taking after its big bro but still full of young pip and vinegar (not real vinegar)."
"D - very drinkable. Easy to drink for sure."
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation, a little dry feel. Drinks okay, the alcohol is masked alright except during the aftertaste. Flavors are decent, I usually like ST but I don't think I'd seek this one out."
"Overall a very nice beer that borders on being a really great beer. It's just missing something. Could be age or a more controlled fermentation. Could be less hop flavor and more specialty malts. Not sure what it is really. Just missing that ""great beer"" quality. But don't get me wrong, i'd certainly drink it again."
"A pleasant drinker, though not one to blow me away. As an old ale / winter warmer, its more at the 'sessionable' end of the scale in comparison to some of the bigger brews, though I'm not sure its interesting enought to have more than one."
"drinks okay. alcohol is masked well, but flavors are not quite what I expect, nor want, out of a winter warmer, nor any beer for that matter. not a bad beer, but one i will pass up on from now on. not ST's greatest."
"D: Very drinkable, if not for the bit of stickiness, would be perfect for the style."
"The beer is good but it's not much of an old ale. The aroma is malty with hops, paper, and a bit of fruit. The appearance is amber with a foamy head. The taste is like the aroma with a good balance of sweet and bitter. The palate is smooth. Overall a good beer but it needs work in same ways."
"D- so here it is. With bbc taking away the winter seasonal I remember... Southern tier makes thee winter seasonal out there. Spices, sugar, and good malt. This is the new go to of this season"
"Pours an amber brown, like a sherry or a Bordeaux past its prime, with a slight fluffy head (with no lacing). The aroma is burned tobacco, smokey, like a cool ashtray. The flavor is smokey and woody, like smoked bacon, with a sharp hop bite and a cinnamon burn. The mouthfeel is prickly, with a spicy burn around the lips and a prickly finish"
"I was somewhat disappointed in this brew, as it did not meet my expectations for a seasonal winter ale. I am not a hop-head, nor do I think a seasonal brew should be heavily hopped. I do think that spice should play a part, however, and I detected very little if any spice in this beer. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant and drinkable beer"
"Drinkability - I'd have no problem having a few of these on a cold winter night. Very nice beer, but lacking the spices to truly call it a winter warmer, but the alcohol is there to make sure of your warmth. Another great beer from Southern Tier!"
"This was a real easy beer to drink. I think I found a new winter favorite."
"D - Not bad, this is very toasty and malty with some burnt sugar undertones. The toast gets a little bit overly dry in the finish with a burnt bread character that lingers on the palate. The herbal hop flavors blend nicely with the brown, malty notes though the bitterness doesn't quite manage to keep the rich malt subdued. A decent and drinkable beer, though one is enough for me."
"12oz bottle. Pours a clear mahogany color with a small head. Some lacing. Aromas of caramel, malts, and some apple. Taste has some hop bitterness to it that I didn't notice in the aroma. Some spice flavor as well as some caramel malts. A bit of a warming alcohol aftertaste. Doesn't have that typical Southern Tier sweetness to it. Pretty good winter offering."
"D: Drinking this beer isn't that difficult because the alcohol is well masked."
"Good, hoppy American Strong Ale. OK so this is listed as an Old Ale, reviewing to style will knock this down as it is awfully hoppy for an Old Ale and certainly has all the makings of an American Strong Ale as it is listed at Ratebeer.com."
"Nicely drinkable, I'm glad I've got a growler for the Browns game."
"On Tap at UPick6 in Erie PA. I Got a huge aroma of hops and spice with the glass still a ways away from my face. Nice. Pours a deep red color with a minimal head but nice lacing. A slightly creamy texture. The flavor is predominately Malt, but just enough x-mas spice to leave a nice aftertaste. As it warms, so does the Alcohol. Not overwhelming, but it lets you know it's over 7%. A nice relaxing Christmas Ale. Is it Top 5...Maybe."
"Pours an opaque dark reddish mahogany with a fine-bubbled, light tan head. Aroma is hoppy, rather like an IPA, and slightly spicy, mainly cloves. Strongly hoppy flavor has an overtone of cloves and cinnamon, as well as hints of malt and fruit. Texture is tingly and ragged, leaving behind a nice fizz."
"drinkability: nice winter seasonal and will drink again."
"Southern Tier crafted a nice Winter seasonal here. It's not your typical release for this time of year. It's devoid of any holiday spice presence. Fortunately, you won't miss it. The lively hop punch more than makes up for it. Calling this an Old Ale is a stretch. Save for the light dark fruit flavor, it's not really even close to that. It's much more a hoppy Amber or Pale Ale. Just sayin'. Damn tasty beer nonetheless."
"D-very high, easy to spend a nice winter evening with a few of these"
"D: Pretty decent brew. Can't say it's the best Winter Warmer. If its an old ale, it is terrible so I'm going to assume the beer is mislabeled here."
"Drinkability is pretty good. It's not too heavy being 7.2, and aside from the warming, there isn't much of a hint of any alcohol. I could easily down a sixer if I had the hankering."
"Like I mentioned before, this drinks like an ESB. Bottoms up and put a few back before you hit the sledding hill."
"Just kind of bland. There is some hops and sweetness, and that is it. Not really an Old Ale to me. Nothing bad, just middle of the road. Especially for one of my favorite styles."
"As far as I know...NO SPICES. It is not a ""Winter Warmer"" it's a damn nice beer that's a bit out of the box. It seems as if it's expected to have eggnog/punkin pie spice,and were that my expectation,I'd have avoided it. It's sort of a maltier Celebration with a bit more orange/tangerine to the hop side."
"D: A beer that I would like to have in my fridge from December-February,great on a cold night."
"decent session beer...the abv is a little high....but decent drinkabillity..."
"Drinks quite well. The overall flavor is fine, but personally, it doesn't do a whole lot. Still, this is a very good beer that makes a really good winter beer without the huge abv. Another winner from Southern Tier."
"Old Man looks like a darker version of a oktoberfest or such, the body is dark gold with some brownish appeal, maybe some copper. A slow pour yielded a bunch of cream/egg shell colored foam that was thick and full but lacked life, leaving a cap, small squiggly lines on the way down. Smell is malty and rich and pungent, it does not leap from the glass, but the scent is full up front, caramel, chocolate, some lingering yeast, bread crumbs, some dark fruit, not old alse though. Same is for the taste, the toasted malt is there present and roasted as well, but not in mass quanity like the big boys. After that, some plum, apple, touch of chocolate. Don't pick up any hop flavor. Feel is medium strong and malty. Goes down with a slight punch to the tounge. Drinkability is one bottle would not have more than that. I see this as a really light old ale, as Rock Art Ridge Runner is a light English Barleywine. A smaller package(to style) of the bigger thing. All Southern Tier needs to do is add an old ale to their imperial lineup. I could see a bottle of this developing somewhat over a year but don't see it doing anything after that."
"Not Southern Tier's best work, but not their worst either."
"Pours a nice copper color with a decent head that fades to a swirl. Smells a bit waxy and earthy with a hint of spice overlaying the malt and some earthy hops. Nicely balanced with more of that waxy malt and spice and a bit of spicy hops. Quite smooth and a nice seasonal. Not too spicy or sweet, this is especially drinkable for a winter, but a little light for an old ale."
"D - Good Winter Warmer but not awesome. Altough I enjoyed the hoppiness of this brew, it could have been creamier and more full-bodied... and warmer."
"Overall worth trying but nothing to write home about in my opinion much rather have a Rogue SPR."
"Overall this is a very nice beer. Nicely done beer and pretty complex."
"D: Could drink these all night. Great winter brew, but not overly heavy, great for a night of drinks. Would highly recommend this one!"
"O: A bit heavy to be knocking back more than two or three. Good flavor and the bitter finish keep you coming back for more."
"Overall I was a fan of this beer but I was expecting more a winter warmer, or at least some spices, after hearing the name. At times I thought I detected some spices but I'm fairly certain it was just from the hops, if anything. Still, this is a good beer that's worth a shot."
"D: Seems more like a balanced IPA to me, but regardless it's a pretty good beer. Just picked up a single but might just have to go back and grab a full 6 pack"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. The carb could actually be toned down a touch, but it is not distracting. The aftertaste has some sweet and toasted malt with a hint of booze. This is a beer worth drinking during Winter months. It's a different take with all the spiced ales in the market this time of year, and I think it's well constructed and executed. Another winner from Southern Tier."
"I really enjoyed this beer. So glad I picked up 5 other bottles. This is something I WILL be grabbing more of. Recommend it to all."
"High alcohol content hits quick. Probably couldn't do more than 2 of these at a sitting but it is very enjoyable. I drank ice cold but think letting get closer 50-60 degrees would give maximum taste. Will definitely go back to this one."
"Looks like a medium brown copper color. smells like toasted malts and a pleasant hoppiness. tastes toasty and warm. A good amount of hop bitterness in this one, has a good amount of bite at the end of it. pretty good mouthfeel, a little thin, but probably appropriate for the style. Drinks pretty slow, it's tasty but i'd probably wouldn't want more than one in a single sitting. Still a very well crafted beer. I really like Southern Tier, they make some great stuff."
"Pours a dark copper color with a bit of a tan head. Some staying power, though not much lacing after it recedes. The nose brings some citrus, toasted bread, caramel, earth, and some light herbal notes. The taste is a bit sweet with citrus and herbs, then yielding to some toasted bread and earth. Nice feel and a good body. The beer lacks cohesion and doesn't end up finishing all that well, though I'd like to see how it ages."
"Lacks complexity, jumps from exceedingly sweet to aggressively bitter with nothing in between."
"Bottle. Pours a very clear copper color with a little 1/2 finger white head that coasters on top. Fairly strong malty aroma mixed with subtle citrus hop notes. Good lace on the glass. The taste is pretty sweet with some citrus type flavors. Just a tinge of hop presence that imparts a touch of bitterness. Some caramel notes as well. Hop bitter after taste. Medium mouthfeel."
"-notes from 02/07"
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable brew, easy drinking, nothing to knock it for. Wouldn't mind having more of these."
"inbibed on Feb. 3, 2010"
"A rich, lovely blend of caramel and hops in the mouth. Good body, nutty malt, floral and citrusy hops. Lightly sticky and sweet but creamy and sneaky smooth, no hint of alcohol in the flavor. Lovely balance, great drinkability but plenty of flavor and body to qualify as a great winter beer."
"overall a pretty damn good drop, great beer for a first review."
"overall: its strange I did not expect milk chocolate in smell or taste you can get a bit of spice but not what I expected but still enjoyable"
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Not much special going on so definitely not worth going out of your way for. If you're favorite brew happens to be winter warmers, than maybe give this one a whirl."
"D - An easy drinking winter brew that's not very complex. Good warming notes but it doesn't stir any seasonal emotions in me."
"A pretty good winter warmer, as it's pissing down rain outside - and the ABV is nicely hidden."
"This is an okay beer. It has flavour but the bitterness is out of balance with the rest of the beer and adds a harshness which I don't appreciate."
"D: well balanced old ale, great value, nothing too exciting about this beer but it goes down nice and smooth"
"D-- One is very nice. Does get a bit bigger as it warms up but the alcohol is decently hidden. Maybe a bit over spicy as it warms up but very nice. Nicely done beer and pretty complex. I think it needs a little more sweetness."
"D - not bad but a little to much spice."
"On tap in Chicago. Pours to a clear amber with hints of brown, and a thin off-white head that lingers to mid-glass and leaves okay lacing. Nose is a pleasant blend of earthy and dark fruit malted scents along with a hint of hoppy fruit. Mouthfeel for this medium bodied beer was slightly tingly and spicy, and the taste followed suit with the nose. Finish was long, and warming as the 8% alcohol started to make itself known in the second half of the glass."
"D - Not quite the sort of sweet, rich old ales/borderline barleywines I've had before. I recommend trying it."
"Nice hoppy brew. Much enjoyed."
"D: Not my favorite old ale/winter, but its not bad. Alcohol is well covered."
"The mouthfeel is chewy and really comes off well. Alcohol is hidden but warms slightly in the finish. The finish also boasts a sharp bite with a bit of fruity esters. A nice one for the season."
"-Oelergud"
"It's a Nice Old Ale that's quite on the Milder and Lighter side of the style, yet very nice."
"Excellent."
"D: This is a damn fine drinking beer. Extremely well blended, not over done. I would sit with this one all night...and then again the next night."
"overall a descent winter ale."
"D: A solidly made, drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I picked up a couple of these as I'd like to age it for a while to give the hops some time to fade and see if the malts and spices become more prominent; solid offering overall though, but doesn't really rank up there with an Old Stock or 3rd Coast, let alone an Ola Dubh."
"drinkability - while this beer is not as complex as most old ales - it does have a lower abv and lighter body that allows to drink more then one bottle"
"Drinkability: Mark this one down for a solid winter style beer. Nice spiciness and malty backbone makes this a solid drinker."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly creamy. Drinkability is not bad either, even with the high ABV."
"had this one last year around this time, and seems very much the same. this is a wonderful truly balanced choice for the season, im very interested to see how this one ages and how the malt profile changes."
"Starting to make my way through the rest of what ST has to offer with this one. Pours amber with a small head that reduces to a ring. Not much lacing but a healthy looking beer. Smell was hops and sweet caramel. Taste was floral and citrus hops with caramel notes and some breadyness. Creamy mouthfeel, not too heavy not too light. Drank 5 of these with little problem, but at 7% it may not have been the best idea.. Southern Tier continues to impress me."
"A bit dry on the back end and tastes stronger than its 7.2% ABV may suggest. Otherwise, I'd pick up a six pack and drink this all winter long."
"D- easy to finish and leaves me wanting another. im not sure id be able to guess this was an old ale. very well balanced. ill get a few more of these while theyre in season. with the hop presence the way it is i doubt it has any sort of real aging potential."
"Nice deep copper, ruby pour with nice two finger head and great lacing. The smell was bigger and hoppier than I had expected. But it is Southern Tier so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Piney earthiness with some bready malts mixed in. The taste had a unique toasty earthiness to it as well. The bitterness was overpowering on the first few sips, but the malty sweetness appeared from nowhere to balance it out nicely. This is a really unique beer. I was ready to downgrade the drinkability at first, but it just kept improving to where I really wanted another. Southern Tier just keeps rolling out great beers."
"This to me seemed like it would be what UnEarthly would equate to as an IPA and not the glorious monster it is."
"D- Overall and nice well balanced winter seasonal."
"Overall a very unique winter beer that stands out among other winter ales, which tend to taste rather boring to me."
"D - This just didn't deliver what I expect out of an old ale, in terms of strong malty sweet flavor. It just tasted like a strong ale that isn't that strong."
"Overall- for never having an old ale i gotta say i'm turned on. trying this brew and this style for the first time i'm not disappointed. this will be one brew i gotta have at least once every winter."
"Pours a copper color with a slightly off white one finger head which yields some decent lacing. The aroma is of caramel, floral hops, and some citrus hops. The taste is a nice caramel malt backbone with the notes of floral hops and citrus hops over the top. Nice hop flavor well rounded with the malt. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. The drinkability is good, you can sit and have these all night, more than enough flavors to keep you interested and wanting more."
"A nice wintery, deep red color with some very nice tight and foamy head. Can hardly see through the deep color. Head seems to be sticking around in my Duvel goblet. The aroma of this beer was a bit surprising. I was expecting some fruity deep malts but got quite a nice hop aroma instead. There are some spicy malt smells going on as well, but they are muted by the hops. A little bitter on the tip of the tongue but the malts pull through on the palate to smooth this one out. Finishes bitter though, quite a strange. There is a very muted spice note detected as well. A little thin for an old ale, not even sure this should classify as one. Pretty drinkable beer when it's cold and you need to keep your cheeks warm, but couldn't see a session with this beer. The abv is just too high."
"D: This is a tasty, well-rounded winter ale from Southern Tier. Balance is very nice, although it seems to tiptoe around the line between very good and something more. Still, worth trying this winter."
"Southern Tier calls this a winter ale and Beer Advocate calls it an old ale. I think the old ale is a better characterization, which for me, is a good thing. Not too much on the spices but great malt flavor with good hops and general beer intensity. Will get this again if I see it."
"D - Drinks fine for an APA, but I was hoping for an old ale, and as such, it's quite sub par. The alcohol is decently masked, which keeps this score from being too low."
"D - This is a difficult call for me because I have no prior experience with old ales. It's really not far off from an IPA, except that it has a much bigger, complex malt bill. It's a winter seasonal and supposed to be more substantial, I think, and considering that I think it's still fairly easy to drink."
"I do wonder if I'd get a little more sweetness if I let it sit for a while, but it's a tasty one and fits the bill."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a clear dark amber with a finger of off white head. Caramel malt and plenty of piney hops in the aroma. Solid malt base with a little sweetness that is offset with a good amount of hop bitterness. Fairly dry finish. Medium bodied. A little bigger than a lot of the winter ales that you see. This style seems pretty common lately for winter ales, but this one stands out."
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer. A pleasant surprise in the mixed pack of winter beers that I picked up!"
"A decent example of the style that focuses more on hops than expected. Could have more body but otherwise, good."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, I really like this one and could drink a few of these easily. I'm not a big fan of the heavily spiced winter ales and this one being a nice hoppy slightly darker ale is really enjoyable for me."
"Pretty middle of the road for me. Hop it and they shall come."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Goes down pretty easy and isn't overly sweet. Pretty interesting but that pine character is a little strange."
"Beer poured lively to create a 3/4 inch foamy head that lasted awhile to cover the clear amber liquid of soft carbonation. Complex aroma hints of malty-sweet/spicy some esters as well as alcohol. First sip reveals roasted grains giving way to a nutty caramel flavor as the bitterness flows throughout. This beer has a pleasant aroma and clean taste while having some qualities of a Belgian dubbel. I'll try to age some to see if this winter warmer develops some age related characteristics."
"Old Man was a very deep amber/brown with a decent head that didn't last long. A light citrus for an aroma, I couldn't discern any malt. This was either the lightest or ""newest"" old ale I have had. It tasted mostly citrus hops, just a little bit of malt and a bitter after taste. The feel was medium bodied with sufficient carbonation. Drinkability only fair. Not bad, but not as bold or malty as the other old beers I have sampled."
"Drinkability/Overall: Nothing like I had expected from a winter ale. Still, this beer is extremely flavorful and complicated. Seemed like I was picking up different sweet tastes with different sips. I'd have it again, and I'd have it for desert."
"I ahve come to expect much more from southern tier. the old man winter ale tasted like nothing more than an ipa with the possibility of some seasonal spices. definitely the least impressive product to bear the souther tier name. I suppose it is difficult to follow the PumKing up with any other seasonal."
"Pours light brownish with a thin white head. Taste is malty with a bit of hoppy. Smell is sort of spicy. Mouthfeel is medium, crisp with a bunch of suds. Drinkability is ok, probably not my style but it isn't bad. reminds me a bit too much of lager."
"Bottle- Unleashes a deep and murky mahogany from the bottle. Head is limited to about half an inch and steps back to the sidelines. Spicy (nutmeg, cinnamon), malty nose with hints of cognac and wood. Spiced sweet malts blend with woody , earthy flavours, and lead to a slightly bitter and hoppy, warming alcoholic finish. This one is meant for sipping, and as such, is quite enjoyable. Quite good."
"Overall, not a bad winter ale offering"
"D- A very unique beer that is either not an old ale, or just is a strange take on it. It drinks nicely- probably due to the sweetness that compliments the hoppiness nicely."
"What is presented here is a very delicious recipe that keeps you guessing as to which flavor notes you can detect. Deep and smooth, with a very complex finish. An original tasty recipe."
"Drinkabilty- I have to say that this flavor and beer did grow on me as I continued drinking it, its a very unique flavor profile for certain, but its very nicely balanced between being very malty and being hop balanced, for a winter beer this is one I kind of liked and would have to visit again, the alcohol is very well hidden to the point of not noticing it at all, an intriguing beer I will try again"
"really an interesting beer. really nice drinkability, moderate carbonation and medium bodied.would pair well with alot of roasted foods."
"CHEERS!!"
"D: I wouldnt call it sessionable, but it is deceptive because the abv is very well hidden"
"Drinkability: Probably the best old ale I've ever had, because of the hop profile. This is a tasty beer that I would go for again."
"This beer pours a clear ruby color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes quickly leaving a small ring of lacing around the side of the glass. The aroma is very hoppy with lots of citrus, grapefruit and pine resin. There is a firm malt presence that is full of toffee and caramel. The taste considerably maltier than the aroma. There are still a lot of hops, but the malt is more dominant. The interplay between the malt and hops really give the flavor tons of complexity. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a might fine beer the I will surely drink again."
"Pours a clear, dirty brown color with a small off white head. Sweet, boozy malt forward nose. Slightly sour, almost oxidized in flavor, sweet malts are dominant, some leafy bitterness remains. Light/medium in body, almost 1 dimensional. Rusty and a good representation of an 'old' ale, im surprised this one doesnt show better with a little age."
"Taste: Hoppy, much like the smell. However, I was hoping it would have been maltier."
"The Beer Stop had a few of these on clearance for .50 cents a bottle last week. At that price, I couldn't resist. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. An aggressive pour yields a copper/amber colored ale with about two fingers of thick, light tan colored foam. Smells and tastes of grassy, spicy hops, caramelized malts and molasses. Nice balance of hops and malt, but this ale is mostly malty first and foremost. A notch or two below full bodied with medium carbonation. Can't really complain considering the price I paid, but I would still pick this up next season at the regular cost."
"Notes: Not a bad beer. I mean that! I'm just not finding much in the way of ""winter"" or ""old"" characteristics. I'm finding more and more that ""winter ale"" just means whatever the hell the brewer feels like concocting."
"drinkability - Nice sipper at night, or in the winter time."
"The packaging on this beer can be a little misleading. It clearly says Winter Ale, which it is in a sense. It was released in winter so its a winter ale. Some of us have a preconcieved idea of what winter ales should be. Strong, darker and full of heavy malt flavours. This beer is strong, darkish and full of hop flavours. Come on, its Southern Tier, what did I expect? Pours a brilliant, deep copper with exceptional clarity capped with a firm dome of resiliant bubbles. Aroma is hoppy; spicy, resinous and piney. Not in your face like some beers but plenty powerfull. Flavour mirrors the aroma with the obvious addition of hop bitterness, which is quite smooth by my standards and well thats about it. Malt really takes a back seat in this one. There is some caramel sweetness in there somewhere, but its very subtle. Medium bodied and dry on the finish. I really like this beer, and most other of Southern Tiers offerings. Highly recommended!"
"D: Okay, but not great. I won't buy another and I'm glad I got in a mixed sixer. Maybe it would be better fresher?"
"Had a bottle at Liberty St. Tavern. Poured a dark brown body with a light tan head. I was struck by how heavy the hops were in this beer. I got a bit of dry molasses in the malt backbone, but it paled to the strong, grassy and peppered hops. If you dig English hops, this beer is for you, otherwise, it leaves balance to be desired."
"d - A little too bitter to session but a sturdy winter brew. The strong bitter hit does a decent job at hiding the alcohol but a little harshness sneaks through after the swallow. I'm not loving the sour and bitter aftertaste."
"Drinkability: I expected more-especially coming off of the smell. This is very one dimensional as it is bitter and hoppy. There are better offerings in the style and Southern Tier has way better offerings."
"From notes, on tap. Pours clear, deep copper/amber, 1 finger head, some retention and lacing. SMELL is spicy and sweet at first. Esters kick in, and solid malty base is evident. TASTE is spicy, vaguely fruity, sweet malty, hint of heat and a bit of hoppy bitterness that lingers a bit at the finish. Smooth, balanced and complex. FEEL is medium carbonation, pleasant but benign texture, some warming, medium body, finished pretty clean but with a bit of bitterness. OVERALL it is a thick, heavy-ish sipper to me. Very well made, but filling."
"I had this at Legends in New Suffolk. On tap, the experience is slightly different from the bottle. The beer has a vanilla, almost cream soda like nose, but has plenty of hop aroma as well. There is a tad more carbonation on tap. The taste is nice and hopped up, not as orangey as in the bottle, a bit more leafy and herbal. There are some hints of a chocolatey roasted note or two as the beer settles. This is a complex beer no matter how you look at it. I'm glad I had this in both formats. I prefer on tap. L'Chaim."
"too one-dimensionally hopped, with almost no malt presence. will this age well? i don't think i'll even bother to find out..."
"M/D - light bodied winter ale with some nice spices, I could drink a few but nothing too amazing with this one."
"It didn't start off too well, but this Old Man came through where it mattered most. I will make sure to look for this beer again next winter."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark amber, with a very thin white bubbly head. Head disappeared almost immediately, leaving just the smallest of rings on top. Aroma was a bit hoppy, with some sweet toasted oatmeal scents. Hops were prevalent in the taste, with a bit of yeast, but not much else. Felt ok in the mouth, a bit more tingley than expected, but not terrible. More of a sipper beer, but hid the ABV well."
"This beer doesn't leave any part of my tongue on the sidelines. Although this is my first ""Old Ale"" styled beer, I must say that I think that it very well balance. There is a rich maltiness with a hit of dark fruits followed by a bitterness when you swallow which leaves your mouth wanting more."
"This reminds me of some of my favorite IPAs and packs the same punch. Would pair well with anything off the grill."
"Extremely drinkable, lots of flavor, not overly complex but balanced."
"D: Ok drinkability, nothing special, flavor is overall muted and muddled with no strong character."
"Oh yes! Poured a clear-ish dark brown with a light brown head. Smelled of medium hops and spices. It had a solid body and mouthfeel. The taste was scrumptious! Hops and spices finishing with the perfect amount of hop bite. Definitely a pretty drinkable beer despite being kind of heavy. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this one turned out to be delicious. Southern Tier does good work!"
"Pretty good issue by Southern Tier. ST is an odd brewery. Some of their stuff is FAN-tastic(Choklat and Oat, for example), and some brews are complete misses, such as their Creme Brulee ale. Nevertheless, it shows they have the courage to try different styles and go out on a limb. That's why I'm kinda surprised by Old Man. Kinda middle of the road for them. Yes, pours like a Winter and tastes like a Winter should, but there's no aroma and it's somewhat lacking in body. By no means one of the best Winters out there, but still not bad overall."
"D - hops is certainly the centerpiece in the beer but is not too over the top...the malt lets its self be known enough to keep this beer balanced"
"Dry and astringent; the malt has a lip puckering effect on the aftertaste. Otherwise, I'd call this a bitter hop brew. Spritzy carbonation to an otherwise full body. Spicy in a peppery sort of way."
"Had this on tap at the Capital Ale House. Brown in appearance. Smell is malty with slight hop nose. The taste is alot of the same. This was a good old ale. I ordered it not knowing what their winter ale was. I was pleasantly suprised by it. I would order again."
"D: A bit musty and I wish more floral and citrus notes were present, but it is still an enjoyable old ale."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but lack of carbonation hurts it."
"This is a pretty tasty winter brew. Pretty solid across the board in my opinion. Worth a shot for sure."
"D- Not too bad but I don't see me drinking alot of these or hunting this one down very often."
"Overall a decent winter beer worth trying. Not really another ""hop bomb"" - better balanced than that."
"Pours a copper color with golden highlights, a small off-white head that left some generous lacing. Big hoppy aroma that I can smell from a few feet away, plenty of pine and grapefruit. Taste is all bitter hops with a light chocolate/caramel malt background. There might be a light spicing, but it's very light. To me, this tastes like every other Southern Tier hop bomb. Nothing special, but tasty."
"This is a very drinkable old ale that I would find again. I thought it was just a mild winter warmer. 8%? Couldn't even tell."
"D: I have not had many Old Ales and cannot judge if the spicy character of this one in particular is indicative of the overally style. A tangy and crisp beer but not something I would pull for again."
"Na Zdravje!"
"This poured a clear, dark amber with white head. It smelled like roasted barley and earthy oats, with copper hops and some vanilla oak and coffee, and a bit of creamy yeast. It tasted much the same, like roasted barley and coffee malts, with bright copper hops and some vanilla oak. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this didn't seem much like an old ale, to me. It was more like an amber ale or doppelbock. But either way, it was still fairly tasty and very clean. It had good body and was easy to drink, with practically no hint of its ABV. So this was an enjoyable beer, but it was disappointing as an old ale. And what's more is that it didn't seem like it will age well (although that won't stop me from trying!)."
"I like this beer.Hows that?"
"I'm vaguely reminded of when I used to sweeten up brownie batter with maple syrup and eat the resultant brownies with OJ. Swear to God, it tasted good. I wish the malts had been more forceful. This is nice, hoppy winter beer, but not very well rounded. Especially with the 8% ABV, this creamy but fairly light-bodied beer does go down smooth and easy."
"I'll be picking up more of this and cellaring a few"
"Pours a clear amber brown color with a cream colored head that left a sheet of lacing on the glass. Probably the lightest old ale that I have seen. The aroma is of grassy and floral hops, very much like an APA. The taste is the floral/grassy hops up front which is supported by bready slightly toasted malt. Again very APA like, perhaps more of a malt body. Not sure how to rate this as it doesn't taste like an old ale, but tastes good. I will cellar one for a while to see what changes. The brew has a nice chewy feel with enough carbonation to make this very drinkable, nice balance between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. A nice hoppy ale with good malt presence. Great balance makes this very drinkable, ABV is well hidden."
"A ""different"" old ale. Maltiness and hoppiness nice, but neither one seem to unfold fully, with a bitterness cutting into the maltiness. A ""nice"" winter ale, that I enjoyed more than the individual parts show."
"M/D - Started of disapointed. Finished wanting another. Great carbonation, very interesting beer. It is extremely unique in its execution of hop taste. Ratings increased with every sip."
"Yummmm - O! Fine, fine beer. Poured with a very nice foamy, frothy head - some large and small bubbles. Lots of lace. Appealing amber color. Nose was some malt and bitterness. Flavor is a really good roasty, dryish yet bittersweet along with some caramel/toffee malt characteristics. Great body. Excellent finish. Would be a session but for the percentage"
"Pours a rusty amber that hasa few dark root beer hues in there as well. Nice head, retention, lacing, and even some lethargic bubbling. The aroma has tons of dense malt aromas. But they get musted out by te funky, piney and funky hops in this brew. Too hoppy smelling to be an ""old"" ale. Deep toasted, bordering on a faint roast, malt character. Plus some very ripe plums. But the bitter hop profile keeps this supposed ""old ale"" from being very malty or fruity. This beer has a little dry feel to it, and a resiny, musty hop bitterness. A little too bitter for me to call it an ""old ale""."
"I'm a fan of most of the other ST products that I've tried, however this brew leaves me luke warm. Perhaps because I expected that it would be more similar to other winter seasonals with a spiciness or mild fruit inclusion. You won't find any of that here however. Now when when the hop mood strikes..."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A great choice for the winter season to go along with your spiced Christmas Ale of choice. Being that I'm a Hophead, I need a hoppy winter ale on standby between my GL and Anchor Christmas Ales."
"Quite a tasty, easy drinking beer. However, it seems a little too hoppy for the style - and could just as easily be mistaken as an imperial amber. Still, it's well worth the try."
"Drinkability: Very good. A very smooth beer, that doesn't leave much lingering behind. You can't taste the 8% alcohol at all. Easily drinkable even when not looking for a winter/holiday beer."
"D- I could drink this one more than one at a time. However, the 8% ABV would catch up to you eventually."
"The bottom line: This would be an across the board average beer if it was listed as an APA or IPA, as an old ale though? Overhopped, undermalted, and extremely shallow. Pick this up if you're looking for something mildly hoppy for the winter, but avoid if you actually want an old ale."
"Drinkability- Very Good."
"When I saw this beer was 8% ABV I didn't believe it.. when having it for dinner today I could have sworn that it couldn't be more than 5%. This thing is too drinkable for that high of an ABV... but hey this is a damn good beer. Great mouthfeel and finish, nice hoppy flavors to it. Goes down nice and easy and I almost drank it too quickly to enjoy it. A nice winter seasonal here from Southern Tier."
"D: A good Ale with a high ABV. Not a good session beer. Would be worth cellaring."
"Pours a very clear darker shade of amber with a very good head that retains very well and leaves behind good lacing. Smells of citrus hops and some maltiness. Taste is very hoppy. This is not what I ws expecting at all...more like a very good IPA. Very well balanced between the great hop character and the malts. A certain spice element is present in the background but not along the lines of a traditional holiday spice like nutmeg or cinnamon..more like a spiciness from the hops. Good deal of carbonation, drier finish, and pretty crisp. Very drinkable and enjoyable. This belongs in the same vein as SN Celebration Ale. A Holiday IPA....only much better imho."
"December update: I upped my scores here for another go round, liked the hoppiness more, nice dry finish, the floral bouquet of hops are very nice, still light for an old ale but a different hoppy take on one."
"D: A holiday offering that is just okay."
"Overall, I don't know where the rating comes from. Southern Tier has once again made a steaming failure of a beer."
"Overall, this is not that complex, but still very good considering other versions of the style. Great warming factor, which is spot on for this cold evening. Recommended."
"Not pushing the envelop, but representing seasonal (i.e., winter) flavor and style well."
"Very nice for a winter ale. Not as sweet as some and a lot more hop in the finish. Dark pour with a malt aroma. Starts out malty sweet and ends very dry. Full bodied and complex. Quite easy to drink especially with the high ABV. Give it a try before it runs out."
"Extremely thick head at first, but it settled eventually. Smell is big malty goodness, dark fruits and whatnot. Again, Surprisingly hoppy. Almost big IPA level hoppy on the taste too, super oily and piney. I think the hops take over the malt a little too much for this style. I liked it and am glad I've tried it while on travel but it isn't one of Southern's Tier's stronger offerings in my view."
"A solid beer at a fair price. Throwing back two or three is doable. Not sure if I would run out to buy it again. Seems a bit simple right now, maybe better with some age. Drinks best at slightly chilled. It's worth trading a little more heat for the added depth of flavor."
"Pours a clear copper-chestnut color, foamy off-white head fades slowly, if at all...leaves a big collar of various sized bubbles around the inside of the glass, and plenty of clingy lacing hanging around. I get a big hit of pine on the nose, but backed by a serious roasted malt presence, some sugary sweetness...really nice aromas here. Very rich malt flavors, almost a caramelized/scorched quality to the malt, roasty, some bitter piney hops, especially on the finish. I'd call this the light end of full-bodied, with an impressive amount of lingering flavors/bitterness. I know what I'll be drinking this winter!"
"Taste starts with light hop bitterness and toasted malts. Caramel and fruit malt follow, but are slightly eclipsed by sharp, citric, piny, bitter hop notes. Resinous and drying all the way to the finish. Sappy pine hop bitterness lingers with some leftover cookie malt. Not bad. Medium-bodied and almost seems a little thin for the style. Not my favorite ST beer, but not bad."
"Holds true to the ""Old Ale"" style. Pretty good beer."
"Notes: I thought it was a decent beer. There was good balance and the alcohol was well hidden. Not for sessions,but good for the winter time."
"Pours a deep, dark orange with an admirably sticky head and comparable lacing. Aroma is of sweet fruit and light citrus. Pretty mellow but it definitely let's you know that the hops are there. Taste is a step up from the moderate hop character, overflowing with citrus. Like taking a mouthful of fruit salad. No real outstanding bitterness other than a subtle tart finish. Light to medium body, which was unexpected. I didn't know much about old ales when I bought this but the description lead me to the it would be significantly more dextrinous. Overall a very pleasant beer to drink. The alcohol isn't a problem at all; it really feels like a sesions beer and it's loaded with appealing but not an overly unique or delicious hop character."
"Drinkability: A good but not great beer from a great brewery. Has that definite orange juice flavor that I don't really care for in my IPAs, much less my old ales, but other than that it's a solid of not outstanding beer. Alcohol's well-hidden, too, and not of an unreasonable level. Give this one a shot, though I can't recommend a sixer."
"MF&D - Slick and slightly oily. Not what I would consider a a true Old Ale or Winter Warmer, but good nonetheless."
"D: One to finish an evening, I'd say... quite a pungent hop flavour,"
"Poured into a pint glass. pours a reddish/brown w/a thin white head that quickly evaporates, no lacing at all. Some good carbonation. Aroma is malty, sugar spices with some raisin. Taste is malty heaven with the bitterness of the hop coming to the party. Mouthfeel is crisp, drinkability should be good with this one. Overall, the cold winter nites should be perfect to handle with this beer."
"Prosit, MK"
"D: For what this is super drinkable. I will definately review this beer again this winter."
"Nice sample from Southern Tier..."
"Pours a darkish brown color with some lighter amber highlights and a finger of off-white head that lasts for a little bit. Fairly weak lacing. Looks solid, although nothing to write home about. Nose is fairly mild, straightforward flavor of spicy, roasted malt. General flavor is spicy malt. A light smokiness to it as well, maybe more so than some other old ales I've had. Light roasted malt, although it doesn't necessarily have the robust body that some of those roasted malt brews have (porters, stouts, etc.). Solid carbonation. Overall, a solid beer. Not quite on the level of some of Southern Tier's outstanding offerings (generally those in 22 oz bottles, like the Hoppe, Choklat, Oat, or Un-Earthly), but not too bad either."
"I'm a fan of Southern Tier, I think they spice seasonal beers pretty well. This is no exception."
"With the Unearthly, Jah-va and Backburner offerings, Southern Tier is incredibly impressive. Old Man isn't on the level of these others, but it wins some points for uniqueness and originality. I love old ales, but this is an old ale black sheep. It's my third one in a week and I still can't quite put my finger on it."
"D- Not terrible but I couldnt ever see myself drinking this again. I like big old ales, this one just doesn't fit the bill."
"Pours a nice brown color with some red in the body. It has a nice off-white head that isn't very tall but it has nice lacing down the sides of the glass. It has a rich malty aroma followed by a nice hoppy aroma. The taste is good for a old ale. It has a sweet malty base with a very nice hoppy bitter taste with some nice wintery spices as well. It has a very crisp and fresh mouthfeel. It finishes very clean and is pretty drinkable for an old ale."
"A beer that shines nowhere except in the sum of it's parts. On the surface, it's not flashy nor hugely memorable, especially in the Southern Tier portfolio. Even in the Old Ale/Winter Warmer realm, it's placid rather than aggressive.. But it melds into something delicious and balanced and vastly enjoyable."
"Drinkbility is not that great. After reading other reviews, I wonder if I got a bad bottle. Will have to give it another try if I run across it."
"Overall: ST rules. In my eyes at this point they just can not do wrong. This one being a winter ale lingered in the beer fridge for a bit as they don't usually tend to be my favorites. Well let me tell you this is an old ale which I did not realize. Nice hop profile with great malt balance. ST does it right again."
"Very nice reddish brown color. Soft white head on top. Sharp aroma-a cross between a Belgian and an alcohol tinge. Soft malty flavor-again with the sharp characteristic. Creamy and soft mouthfeel but not too full. I dont care for the sharp flavor. It isnt necessarily off or bad but seems out of place. Decent enough overall."
"This is enjoyable and above average....just doesn't seem real big bodied..."
"D- This beer has some nice softer malt flavors with a big hoppy finish. I wasn't expecting an old ale to have such a big hop profile but I like hops, so I got used to it."
"Cheers!"
"Dark in color with ruby highlights, not a lot of head in my snifter glass but plenty of lacing. Massive aroma of sweet malt, brown sugar, dark fruit with floral hops behind. Hops are much more assertive in the flavor, plenty of bitterness to balance the nutty malt sweetness. Seems a little under carbonated and slightly thin but overall one worth revisiting."
"Perhaps some age would be good or not, I like it fresh right now. Bitter and heady. I am sure a little age will dull the hops and bring forth the sweetness in hopes that the alcohol ages just as well. A solid pick for the season."
" I don't mind beers that aren't to style, but this is not a good interpretation of an old ale, not a well balanced beer"
"Bottom line, very drinkable, above average for many winter seasonals, but below average for an old ale."
"Overall a rather complex and highly drinkable ale. A perfect winter warmer."
"If I lay one down for a few months or more, I'll add an edit to this review."
"D- Very well done, dangerously drinkable."
"While drinking my first bottle, I had difficulty determining the style and didn't realize it was an Old Ale until consulting the BA site. It seemed quite different from other Winter Ales I've tried this year. I can't compare it to other Old Ales but can say that it's quite drinkable although it wouldn't rate among my favorite Winter seasonals."
"Pours a clear amber with a light tan head. Not as deep a color as I have seen in a lot of other old ales. A bit lighter. Nose is a bit sugary sweet. Nice wood tones there as well. Seems to be lacking the right touch of complexity though. Flavor is tangy with a lot of citrus zest on there that I feel is a bit too much. Leaves a tart zing in the back of the mouth. As it warms it settles and keeps an interesting woody slightly sweet tone. Feel has a decent liquid feel and the carbonation is on the same level. Drinkable, sure. I can't really say this is the greatest old ale ever. I certainly have had others that carry a stronger profile than this. But it was worth trying."
"D - If I didn't know any better I would have guessed this was vienna lager."
"Moderate bodied and medium to light carbonation. Not too dry and rather slick in texture with a good lingering hoppy feel. Well balanced. Not super complex, but nothing is missed in this brew it seems. Another quality selection from Southern Tier."
"Crystal clear auburn/mahogany body. The beer throws up a nice bubbly off white head that sticks around for a while. The lace is fairly abundant as well. Nice warm aroma of molasses cookies, caramel malts and spicy hops. I really like this aroma. This beer has a rich texture to it and a rich flavor as well. A spiced and hoppy aftertaste compliments the deep biscuity maltiness. The flavors are all very even keeled and blend together nicely. Some sweet candied flavors appear as well with some cookie dough like goodness as well. It has a very warm feel to it without being alcoholic at all. Very enjoyable. Southern Tier impresses me again."
"Very dissapointling. I expected much more."
"This is a good beer, but not what I would call outstanding. I probably will not order it again."
"drinkability: pretty good, but my limits 2"
"Quite nice, and definitely recommended."
"Drank a 12 oz. bottle of this, poured into a pint glass. Comes out a reddish-copper with a thin, white head. Good retention, a little bit of lacing on the glass. Nice winter smells of nuts, nutmeg, cinnamon, toasted grains. Dark, toasted malt at the center of the flavors. Again, a good warm quality. Mostly sweet and nutty on the tongue, like a lightly-spiced Brown Ale. Touch of bitterness in the aftertaste, almost like a dark macadamia nut. Medium-bodied mouthfeel, appropriate for the style. Overall, a nice, balanced session ale. Good for the season. Doesn't rely too heavily on gimmicky spices. Good example of the style - I will definitely remember this one!"
"Not too complex but the flavors mix very well. The more you drink of this one the more you start to taste the alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is disappointingly thin and rather lifeless. Very drinkable for its abv, but this will not serve as a winter warmer in the least. Really an improperly labeled beer."
"Overall a good beer, it just seemed like it was in between types, which took away from the overall intent."
"Overall- A session Winter Ale. Slighty sweet and cloying but polishing off 3-4 would be no problem."
"Pours a clear cola brown body with a small and creamy ecru head. Attractive patchy lace clings to the glass. Malty aroma with a hint of chocolate, spicy notes of ginger and orange peel, and some pine hops. Medium body and low medium carbonation. Taste is malty caramel with a hint of chocolate, atop spicy ginger and pine hops. A hint of orange peel. Very dry finish. Decent winter warmer."
"7.5% ABV is very well hidden. This feels more like a drinking than a sipping beer. Much lighter than the Old Ales I am used to."
"Pours a dark orange with red hue and very little carbonation/head. Smell is sweet english malts with orange rind/pepper/bread. Taste is a blend of pepper, tea, sweet malts, orange peel oils, and bittering hops in the finish. Very interesting beer that keeps me guessing. Solid mouthfeel with just enough carbonation. Not really thick, but a little slick. This beer has a lot going on and I'd love to sit down with a 6... on my day off of course."
"It's a pretty decent beer. I doubt how true it is to other old ales with a hop profile like this one has. I would almost call it a barley wine but who am I to make the rules."
"A pretty nice warmer here, not sure if it is an old ale. More of an American strong, but yet, not overly hoppy in the slightest. Some nice tangy malts on the front end, bordering on overly sweet. Can't detect the actual fruits but it is somewhat fruity. Nice head great lacing also. Pours a dark, dark ruby red almost black. Smells of sugary plums and peaches. A nice brew, very strong, and highly drinkable."
"This beer poured a dark red amber color and formed an off-white foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is also present. An aroma of malt, hops, with caramel and spices. The flavor was of malt, slightly of chocolate and pepper. The body was medium light and the finish was a bit bitter. Not really sold on this one, but then I am not big on Christmas style ales anyway."
"D- a nice beer, the caramel isnta personal like but for those who do its a really good beer"
"poured into a pint glass: this beer has a light brown/amber color and smells primarily of hops with substantial malt in there too. the taste really reflects the smell nice and malty but with a pleasant hoppy taste and a nice, smooth mouthfeel, crisp without being too carbonated. i'm not the biggest fan of hoppy beers but this beer really impressed me. good job, southern tier."
"D: Not very tasty and doesn’t go down very easily, this one just seems to fall short on many levels. I just didn’t like it, which surprises me because I’ve really liked everything else that I’ve had from Southern Tier."
"D: I don't think the point of a fairly strong winter beer is to drink a few, so I'm not sure how drinkability works into the equation here. The first time I had this, I didn't care for it so much. I'm glad I didn't review it then, instead waiting to read up on the style, try another Old Ale (Southampton 10th Anniversary), and give it another go later on. I'm glad I did, as I'm enjoying the beer far more this time around."
"Medium body with good carbonation. Tacky dryness with a semi bitter aftertaste. Not bad...not bad at all."
"A beer truly worth warming up with. Pronounced malt flavors and feel, but balanced and spiced with flavoring and bittering hops (I'm guessing English?) The malt presence is firm and shares flavors of caramel, dates, nuts, pecans, and toffee. These are equally present in aromas as flavor. However the hops lurk in the background aromas, but are bold in their bittering. A medium grassy / piney hop flavor spices up the flavors and linger a bit longer than the malts. The beer is bold, solid, and firm, yet not heavy, cloying, or chewy. A good beer that eats like a meal. I do recommend."
"While not a big epic, it's still good for sipping before the fire, and can go with food. A solid multi-purpose winter beer."
"Pours a clear dark amber color, nice big creamy off-white head, nice carbonation, lots of lacing afterwards. The nose is sweet/malty, slightly hoppy, some citrus going on, licorice, and some caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, slightly hoppy, nice bitterness on the tongue. Medium body. Very drinkable, quite a nice/different Old Ale, recommended."
"This one was good overall. Nice flavour and nice balance. A good winter ale to pick up if you see it."
"Fore is medium hop bitter with pine notes, medium sweetness malts and more mild toastiness. The aroma tells you exactly what to expect. Added warmth gives it nutty and sweeter malt flavors. No real faults with it. No real stellar pluses either, save the beautiful appearance."
"D: This is definitely not an old ale. Drinks more like an overly hopped winter warmer. Drinkable, but nothing special."
"clear burnt red with an off-white fluffy head. very nice lacing. aroma is of clean american hops. smells like an ipa. very clean mouthfeel as well. initially sweet, maybe caramel apples, with a mildly hop bitterness and a nice hop flavor. lightly citrusy and grassy. finish is dry, a little bready but clean and lightly bitter. little to no aftertaste. very easy to drink. this is not a bad beer at all, but it's a far cry from an old ale. more like an off-color, high gravity apa."
"Rich and thick mouthfeel leads to full-on flavors of caramel malts, cocoa and cinnamon, smokey bark, a touch of molasses and brown sugar. Flavor is rich and complex, lots of stuff going on here. A hop bite emerges in the finish and hangs out for a lingering piney/citrus peel aftertaste. ABV doesn't hurt the flavor but warms the throat and stomach. A very enjoyable winter brew."
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks hoppedup!"
"Poured a nice clear bronze with a very tight,sticky white head that very slowly dropped leaving a sheet of lace behind.Aromas were not as big as I thought they might be brown sugar hard water and caramel mainly appetizing but not assertive.Great complexities and more assertive flavors though starts out with notes of brown sugar and roasted malt I noticed a hint of molasses but its not strong the flavors meld into a spicey,dry earthy finish showing off some hop muscle.Quite warming,yeah I know its a little late in the season for this beer but on a cold blustery damp day here in the Buffalo area it really hits the spot Iam gonna pair with some hearty meatloaf in mushroom gravy and mashed red skins Iam sure it will hit the spot."
"All in all I enjoyed this beer."
"Year of sample is uncertain, but I'm guess late fall '05."
"A nicely hopped old ale. The hops first come forth, than a bit of roastiness, mollasses like a porter , and then the full old ale. Satisfying finish.Spicey aftertaste. Caramel and sugar. Medium plus mouthfeel. Another good one from this brewery. Very drinkable with food."
"Overall I highly recommend this seasonal winter brew. I like SA Winter Lager, but this is by far a superior beer."
"Dark copper with a pillow head that dissipates quickly, but with decent lacing. Smell is very inviting..a combination of sweet carmely malt wioth nice hop notes. Taste has an initial sweetness that reminds me of molasses but with a hint of undefined fruit. After the initial sweetness, there is a definite hop presence that hits past mid-palate and remains throughout...an interesting combination. Mouthfeel is initially chewy, but fades into dryness. I can sense the alcohol underneath this all and this was a tad harsh which affected drinkability."
"Thanks, shippos, for the chance to try this one."
"I can see what they are getting at here. this almost reminds me of the Reaper Mortality Stout. This brewery is in love with certain hop varieties and it shows. This isn't your typical Winter Warmer perse but is a tasty and well crafted brew none the less. Like their other offerings this is solid if not overwhelming."
"FIrst sip reveals an average to heavy body with mild carbonation. Flavor starts with some caramel but quickly rolls to a sappy and piney hops that are surprising for the style and also much more robust than the nose leads on. A fairly drinkable beer but not necessarily a winter warmer in my opinion. More of an IPA. A drinkable beer for sure but not what I expected."
"Overall, I enjoyed it. It is a bit bitter for a winter warmer, but I could drink a sixer."
"Drinks like a double brown ale. This is way hopped up. Piney hops overwhelm the sweet malts. Not well balanced but it's bold and interesting. The alcohol is definately there in the warming of the cheeks. Not your typical winter warmer... this is almost a barley wine... but this certainly will warm you up in the winter."
"Drinkability & Notes  Relatively easy to drink, but not what I was expecting or looking for at all, way too hoppy and unbalanced for the style. That being said if they called this a fall amber instead of a winter warmer, I would probably like it better."
"However this beer does go down easy, and is overall a fine beer. Wouldn't go out of my way to look for it- but at a modest price 6.99 for a six- I'd pick it up when I see it."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is pretty good with a creamyness that left a coating in my mouth. Seemed a bit heavy for the color to me, but I liked it that way. Well balanced for a WW. Drinkability is about one or two--just not a huge winter warmer fan. Those that like WW's, probably could have a few more."
"Amber brown in color. Thin tan head with nice lacing. Smell has some slight alcohol notes and also has some piney hop notes I didn't expect. Taste of burnt malt and more of the pine notes. Slight bitterness to the finish. The burnt taste really seams to linger. All in all a nice winter warmer that is worth a try."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated."
"This pours a beautiful clear reddish brown with a large creamy 2 finger head.The scent isn't too strong ,but there is a hop aroma with some holiday spices.This has a very hoppy taste that's very good,but not really like a winter warmer.I was expecting more spices,but this is pretty much an IPA.The m/f is good,but not what I was expecting.This is a well balanced beer with a light m/f.This is a very good brew and I'll buy it again."
"Pours a rich amber. Nice head,and lots of lace. Smell is of pine and spice. Merry Christmas.Mouthfeel is medium and slightly carbonated. Taste is smooth with just the right balance of bitter and sweet. Not overpowering,very good. Try this, you will not be sorry!"
"Received this beer in a trade with JahNoth."
"A few 12 ounce bottles sampled, no freshness indication offered. Pours a deep, rich, glowing medium almond shade. Nose is tan and of typical size, the lacing here is quite impressive, fine, scattered, extensive. Nice looking brew. The nose is muted and just a wiff of malt came to me. This is a tasty, warming winter sipper.notes of maple, whisky and grainy hops late. Malty and smooth, I found this one to be quite pleasant and worthwhile for cold weather and holiday imbibing."
"12 oz. bottle, no freshness date. Pours a clear amber color. Creamy off-white head. Good retention. When it does disappear, good patchy lace clings to the sides of the glass. Hint of caramel in the nose. Fairly robust aroma, floral and citrusy hop aroma. Caramel malt followed up well by floral and citrusy hops. I wish the malt was a bit more robust, as I think it could use it as a ""winter warmer"". Soft spices in the background. I enjoyed the 2nd bottle much more than the first. This one seems to have grown on me."
"This beer poured a deep amber, with some orange hues around the edges of the glass. There was a creamy off white head that held on at an 1/8 of an inch for the entire glass. The first smell gave a citrus hoppy smell, there was some pine in it too. I didn't get much malt in the smell. The taste starts all malt, bready and mildly sweet then the bitterness kicks in and stays for awhile. The bitterness goes away quickly and it finishes dry. I really like this beer, there is a good balance of hops and malt. Nothing is over done, not too bitter, not too sweet, just right."
"Drinkability: Overall I found this beer to be very flavorful and superbly drinkable. Seek this one out."
"Very drinkable. Complex, but not maddenly so. Another winner from Southern Tier."
"There's a lot to like about this beer. It's very flavorful being both sweet and hoppy-bitter at the same time. For over %7 abv, the alcohol is well hidden, but it does warm you up a bit. The bottle looks very different from the one in the picture, but I'm assuming it's only the label that changed. I really enjoy this and will certianly buy this again. I like most of what I've tried from Southern Tier and this is one of my favorite winter offerings out of any that I've tried."
"Thanks Kevin!"
"Clear mohogany with a thick creamy creme-colored head that laces very well. Piney, woody, and molasses aroma. Smells earthy like a brown ale but as it warms some spiciness appears. Fruity hops that have gone papery. Toasty, toffee, ginger, and molasses in the flavor. Thick and slick, this comes off a little candyish, which I tend to like in a beer, but this is kinda dull. A refreshing bitterness comes in at the finish, but the flavor just seems weak. Overall it is not something to seek out, but certainly pleasant nonetheless. It improves as it warms, so serve this one barely chilled."
"An interesting ale; creamy, spicy, and touch of hops. Worth a try; especially compared to the average 'boring' winter warmers out there."
"Drinkability is decent, kind of dries out my mouth though and makes me reach for something more refreshing after 2. Good to have one or two to close out the night."
"Clear, dark reddish amber color with a medium foamy beige head and sticky lacing. Sweet aroma of brown sugar, caramel and malt. Medium-bodied and very representative of the season, with lots of malts and spices in the flavor. A very pleasing character all around. The finish is short but tasty with malt and dark fruits primarily. Not as bold as some of the better winter seasonals but enjoyable all the same."
"a clean dark amber/brown beer. Has a big creamy off white head and great lace. The aroma is mostly a big promise of hop goodness . With a combination of spicey and grapefruit hops and a little malt sweetness in the background.The flavor weaves back and forth between a bittersweet grapefruit at the start, roasted malt next and then the spicey hop notes. All of which seem to blend into a nice finish."
"reaches toward double ipa status.."
"A bit hoppier than I expected. Not bad, just a surprise. Seems a darker, less bitter version of their IPA. Yep. This is a winter warmer for the hop head. It is good. Try some."
"A good, above-average effort from Southern Tier that maybe got a little carried away as it aged over the summer."
"A good looking beer, amber tending toward brown. Not much carbonation, and the head, at first fairly nice, receeded quickly to a thin film. Smells very nice, pleasing pine hops with a slightly earthy undertone. A very nice beer, full on piney hops, with just a touch of orange at the end. Lightly malted, but the hops aren't over the top. Just enough for an oily mouthfeel, but not enough to really pucker. Mellow and easy drinking, with that touch of hop oil."
"Drinkability is above average. Hard water/metallic notes slightly off-putting but overal a decent beer."
"Somewhat sweet tasting, caramel or even brown sugar coming through. Some hop aftertaste and a really nice mouthfeel from this almost syrupy beer. Drinkability is quite good though not really a session ale - for me at least."
"Pours a dark reddish brown, head settles to almost nothing but leaves lacing on the glass. Loads of malt on the nose with notes of spice and caramel, a good prelude to the first sip. The taste starts out moderately but quickly grows and warms as it moves down the tongue, developing into an excellent balance of intense caramel, spice, smoky malt, and hops. Mouthfeel is thick and oily with just enough carbonation, alcohol is there but not in your face. This is a huge beer, very good and highly recommended if you like big thick beers. Will definately get this again. Reminds me somewhat of Victory's Storm King."
"This is my 3rd brew from Southern Tier and I am impressed. Nothing over the top...just great representations for the styles they offer."
"I knew very little about Southern Tier prior to drinking my first bottle of their beer last fall. They've become one of my favorite breweries though, because each and every one of their offerings has impressed the hell out of me. Old Man Winter Ale proudly keeps that streak intact. It's a full-bodied, hoppy, flavor fest that I would look forward to each winter if I was lucky enough to live in the distribution area. Thanks yet again to HappyHourHero (although getting me hooked on an unavailable brewery wasn't a very nice thing to do)."
"This one pours a deep, woody brown color with a slight haze. Its got a clumpy, sudsy, tan-ish head that produces a marvelous lace. Very nice combination of malt and hops in the aroma. Theres a nice alcohol background, followed by waves of caramel, flowery hops, and a serious sweet-smelling doughy maltiness. The taste has a solid and forcefull bitterness that presents itself at the first sip. Alcohol warming and a sticky sweetness are also present. Its all very well balanced, and comes together as a fantastic beer. This ones a keeper."
"A crystal-clear chestnut body glows with auburn highlights beneath a good sized head of ivory colored froth. The head retention is fair and it leaves some nice, small, splashes and spots of lace about the glass. The nose is somewhat limited in comparison to the richer flavor inside; yet bright notes of floral and grassy hops swirl over a burnt-caramel maltiness and yeasty fruitiness. It's very smooth, and even lightly creamy across the palate with a medium-full body and restrained, fine-bubbled carbonation. Mildly sweet and deeply caramelized malt appears upfront in the flavor; accented by some yeasty, berry-like fruitiness. Grassy, floral, and piney/spicy hops rise almost immediately; and are then overtaken by a powerful, quick-rising bitterness. It finishes extremely dry and dusty, with a burnt-malt acidity and long lasting, bone-dry bitterness. The combination of rich malt, bold hops, and forceful bitterness is impressive; but at the same time it seems to lose some complexity as everything becomes muddled. Additionally, the brute assault of its bitterness eventually dampens the palate and a good bit of drinkability is lost. Still, it's an impressive, bold beer when enjoyed at just below cellar temperature on a cold winter's day."
"Poured out a deep golden amber with huge amounts of milkshakey eggshelled colored head that finally settled down as about a quarter inch of froth. Killer head retention, very impressive. Tons of carbination seen rising up. Mainly malty scents, could not really get anything else from it. Creamy and thickish feel, very smooth. Alot of nice bitey hoppiness, peppery and dark toasty. Nice and spicey tasting, white grapefruit juice and grapefruit rind. Leaves a ton of flavor in your mouth -mainly the burnt toast and blackness. Schweeet...."
"I think it was below 0 degrees last night here in Michigan, so a Winter Warmer was definitely called for. Luckily I had this. The color of this beer is really unusual. Kind of like ruby red grapfruit juice. Here was small but held together nicely. No lacing. Smell was really fruity and hoppy along with some nutty characteristics. Taste begins with a diluted mouthfeel and then sugary caramel malts followed by bitter floral hops. Barley is there but seems really grainy and out of place. Finish has a bitter hop spiciness and fusel alcohol. Alcohol warmth, flavors are present the whole way through and actually makes this beer much more enjoyable. There's just too many residual sugars and hop resins in this beer, like they threw a whole bunch of both ingredients and more yeast in the secondary or after the boil. The flavors had an intensity even with the lighter body but they didn't really work together. It did the job by warming my insides but I think the Beast could do that as well. Decent."
"Arriving as part of the BIF X-mas package from shippos, this beer poured out clea deep copper with a 1 inch thick foamy head. The aroma was that of resinous and peppery hops and perfumey alcohol. The malt was chewy with a bit of a burnt toast, followed by a drizzling of apricot and apples, and a wisp of smoky dryness. The hops that were prominent in the aroma did not feature much in the form of bitterness. Very silky and soothing mouthfeel, despite being a bit thin. Very easy drinking that is somewhat like a diluted barley wine."
"Quite nice. After your pour it you notice the nice copper/dark amber color. Widly distributed lacy with a sticky cream colored head. Aroma is of caramel, hops and lotsa malt. Taste is florally with some interesting spices. Hints of dark fruit. Light medium feel."
"Two thumbs up to this old man!"
" this was a wonderful beer, a great balanced beer to while away a winters evening with. color a dark clear copper amber with a a nice head and glass lacing. Very clear crisp look and finish; this beer invites imbing. Nose bouquet of xmas caramels and Tom and Jerry's. A taste of sweet chestnut followed by an nice subtle balanced hoppiness. I would agree with the Shangys lad- this beer could be a barleywine crossed with Celebration Ale. I thought this was a real winner to drink in Santa and the new year both. Excellently balanced, enjoyable beer."
"Picked me up a case during my last visit to Shangy's Beer Superstore in Emmaus, Pa. I told the salesman( the owner's son) I was looking for a barleywine, he told me this was ""like"" a barleywine crossed with S.N. Celabration Ale. He also told me it was 9.2% abv. He was wrong all the way around. Don't get me wrong, it's very good, just not a barley. Anyway...pours reddish brown with a creamy tan head, excellant retention and lacing. Smells initially malty and slightly sweet, followed closely by a large dose of hops. Same with the tasting-malty at first then a blast of citrus and pine from the hops. Mmmm, this is a good mistake. Very balanced, soft mouthfeel makes this perfect for sippin' or gulping. Alcohol is evident but well integrated. I'm glad I have a whole case of this!"
"Bender Factor: At 7.5 ABV, this is the way to go when opening up Christmas presents. Another stellar offering from Southern Tier. The hops tame down when cellared after 5 months."
"Pours with a two-finger bubbly beige head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Light carbonation. Starts crisp, hints of spices, finishes hoppy, slight bitter aftertaste. Not what I was expecting for a winter warmer. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Hoosick Street Discount Bev. Troy, NY."
"Poured in an imperial pint glass, forms a 3/4"" beige head, with average lacing. A slightly cloudy dark copper brew, with an aroma of medium malts, spices, and alcohol, which is what I would expect for the style. Taste is initially of dark fruits, but quickly rounds out with sweet malts, and leaves you with a warming feeling at the outset. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both reasonably good, a good representation of the style, but leaves you just a bit wanting. Close enough to great to make you ache for it."
"Thanks to the NJs finest Old Man Davo, for this Old Man."
"12oz Bottle. Poured a clear brownish amber with a thick loose head that settled down quickly. Roasty and hoppy would describe the aroma and slightly doughy. Some nice malt grains are also found in the aroma. Smooth body that is medium and crisp. Flavor is a blend of hops and malt. Has kind of an english ESB kind of quality except darker and stronger. Overall a good ale and possibly a good session brew as well."
"Burnt copper/mahogany color, bursting with malt and hop (cascades?) aromas. Very finely balanced between the sweet malt bill and the bittering hops. Excellent depth and a nice smooth finish. Very easy to drink, but the alcohol may take effect before too many of these. Mouthfeel is thick and so velvety smooth. I gotta go out and horde this up before it's gone for another year. Excellent!!"
"The beer pours a dark amber/light brown color with a 1/4"" off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It is intensely malty with a mild hop scent. It has a creamy feel to it; refreshing despite an elevated abv. .The taste is good. It is a malty beer with a slightly bitter hop flavor to it. I warms a little on the way down, but it finishes clean. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good seasonal. I am always surprised by the quality beers that Southern Tier produces. They are certainly making a splash in the hand crafted field."
"Southern Tier continues to impress me with every new beer I've had, and they show why they're deserving of Lew Bryson's choice of Best New Brewery. A fantastic old ale, with just the right mix of hops in there, and certainly one I'll have next year."
"Pours a very lovely amber with an equally lovely creamy eggshell head. Lots of lacing here. Smells faintly caramel in it's malt with the citrus of the hops coming to the forefront. Definitely a little estery. Tatses very smooth with a lot of chunks of some big sweet malt. A little nutty, a little toffee and then a really fast switch to a fairly hoppy ending. Mouthfeel is medium with carbonation present, but not overbearing. Very drinkable."
"Let me start with just stating how outstanding this brew is. Appearance: Ruby amber brown with a nice creamy tan head leaves a good amount of lacing not too shabby at all very nice appearance going down. Aroma: Piney hops awesome aromatics here huge caramel malts giving a roasted malt character that's well needed in the wintertime. Taste: Deliciously spicy this is where it's at the hops play their role down to the T with the caramel malt presence tying it all together what a dream beer Southern Tier strikes again my favorite new micro of the year by far. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with slightly oily texture just due to the amount of hops playing a role in this brew. Drinkability: Perfect winter in my eyes not too sweet perfect hop profile a masterful job done by an inscenduary brewing team up in New York some where."
"When will Southern Tier ever make a bad beer? The old man winter poured a deep mahogony with splashes of autumn brilliance. An eggshell white head perched on top and receded into a half film half bubble top and good lacing. Smelled deeply of leafy hops and brown sugary malts and the slightest twang of esters. Taste was sharp and hoppy up front mellowinginto a chocolate like sweetness finishing with dried fruit and sticky sweet notes in the finish. The increased alcohol warmed my throat as it went down. This is a highly quaffable and dare I say session strong ale. I would almst venture to say with the increased hop presence that this could qualify as a low-octane barley wine. And its dirt cheap as well. Drink up."
"Another very nice ale from Southern Tier, impressively drinkable. If I cellar a case of hoppy christmas ale, it's going to be this one, not a Californian offering."
"Drinkability: This is a decent old ale, but too hoppy IMO, and the burnt characteristics were somewhat distracting."
"Poured a small off-white head that faded fast and left a smattering of lace. The smell is funky, a combination of hops and burped up corn. It's a fairly transparent beer and dark amber in color. The body is on the light side of medium, and the carbonation makes for a smooth mouthfeel. The flavor reminds me of a hopped up lager, and the finish is only slightly bitter."
