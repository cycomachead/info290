3.58,-3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a copper-amber with short but dense head.  Smell is malt and the typical fuggles/EKG wet cardboard hops.  Taste is a tad sweet, but has malt and a touch of hops to balance it out, although it feels a bit off on the balance and mouthfeel to me.  Funk on the finish, which would seem out of place if it wasn't an old ale oak-aged blend.  Overall, pretty good, but not great.  Would be worth a side-by-side with Old Peculiar and Olde Suffolk to compare apples to apples.","captaincoffee","Jan 19, 2015"

Style aside, fans of Innis & Gunn will probably appreciate this one, as it offers a somewhat similar flavour profile with a noticeably more varied hop presence (and thus better balance IMO). A great beer to warm your bones on a cold winter's night, and something I'd consider getting again - it paired nicely with some beef stew.","thehyperduck","Nov 16, 2013"

It is a little too light in body and malt character, and uses obviously American hops, to be considered an English IPA.

I will look for this again and would consider it something of a special occasion beer.

Big and sweet aromas of predominantly toffee, followed in strength by dark fruit (very fig-like) and a hint of vanilla. Taste carries a big toffee and biscuity blast on the front and mid-palates, with dark fruit (figs, prunes, raisins) and sherry-like notes emerging on the mid to back-palates. A lightly earthy, wet wood-like bitterness lends some balance to the finish. As far as old ales go, this isn't nearly as potent as some of the American best-sellers, but its relatively mild intensity makes it potentially more appealing to a broad audience, while the austerity of flavor profile gives the geekier beer consumer something to revel in.","droomyster","Feb 23, 2013"

3.77,1.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Garnet in color with excellent clarity and a collar of creamy foam that stays around for about a minute but leaves no lacing. Aroma is bready and fruity (apples, white pears) with just a hint of alcohol. Flavor was also warmly malty with fruity aspects, but had more focus on raisins and dark fruits than the aroma did. If I had to criticize something, it would be that the lightly hopped bitterness comes across as somewhat murky, unfocused, and nondescript compared to the sharply focused stellar composition of the malt bill. Has a rich mouthfeel without being heavy in texture, and is lightly carbonated. Finish is semi-dry but stubby short in duration.","WastingFreetime","Jun 15, 2012"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"I had a 2nd bottle the next day at cellar temp and it was much better' the oak was more balanced, the taste more enjoyable. My evaluation went from 'decent' to 'good'. This beer cost me one quarter of that of Yorkshire Stingo and while Stingo is a better beer, this is pretty good one. At less than $ 5 for a 500ml bottle this is a very nice beer to sip on a Sunday.","fx20736","Mar 03, 2012"

3.58,-3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"500 ml clear bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear orange/copper color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is toasted malt, toffee, herbal/earthy hops, oak, and a little bit of skunk. The brew tastes like toffee, toasted and caramel malt, nuts, herbal hops, and a bit of tea and fruit. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. I thought it was a decent enough overall brew. I tend to stay away from beers that come in clear bottles, but since it was a new arrival at a local store I hoped that the brew wasn't too old yet. I think it's worth a try.","bluejacket74","Feb 18, 2012"

3.58,-3.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Crystal clear deep amber copper hue with a fine off white light khaki head. Aroma has an herbal hop note with tobacco leaf notes...mild fruity caramel tones to round it out. Flavor is balanced ripened fruit sweetness with mild earthy/citrus/tobacco notes wrapped around caramel malts with an ongoing earthiness about it. Overall another generic English ale that does absolutely nothing to set itself apart, other than the higher than average 6.5% abv and labeling it a Vintage ale. I knew what I was getting into it's definitely drinkable carbonation on the mouthfeel is a little higher than I wanted but not bad as a whole.","WVbeergeek","Feb 10, 2012"
4.08,10,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall: A very nice English ale. Went fantastic with fish and chips and I think it would be even better on cask. Definitely something I would pick up again. A little bit weak in aroma, but it more than made up for it in taste.","damndirtyape","Feb 08, 2012"
3.29,-11.3,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours an coppery-orange amber. Fine off-white one finger head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, dark fruit and light oak, sadly mixed with light skunking. Taste is mild caramel and bready malt and dark fruit, finishes somewhat dry with a light woody earthy flavor, a little sour and a bit of hops. Subdued flavor, but pleasant. Flavors are not that well integrated. A bit more of the skunkiness in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. A nice ale marred by off taste caused by use of clear bottles. Why do breweries work hard for a nice ale and then allow it to deteriorate in shipping, when the solution is so simple? This would have scored a point higher without the skunking. This is fairly new in the local market, so this bottle is not that old.","LiquidAmber","Feb 03, 2012"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Bright amber with a coppery hue topped by a fluffy beige cap. Plenty of lacing with good head retention. Fruity aroma, earthy and woody with some sugar and leafy hops. Bitterness was nicely balanced and present throughout. Sweetness was sugary, flavour was a bit citrusy and spicy, and there was a slight alcohol presence and old/stale notes. It finished with more of a plum and raisin character, slight woody astringency, and herbal hops. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation, mild dryness, nice texture. Overall, quite enjoyable with plenty of English character.","DrJay","Jan 21, 2012"

3.6,-3,4,4,3,4,4,"Poured a 1.5" off-white head which appeared to exhaust the effervescence in the glass and fade fairly quickly. Body is a quite attractive clear amber, almost like a radiant varnish. Smell is quite complex with an array of malts, hops, toffee, caramel, vanilla. Taste mirrors all the smells but is much milder than expected. A fairly long bitter finish follows and I'd call that a trademark of the Hen trio of beers. All in all this is a good beer but I like the bites of both Speckled Hen and Hen's Tooth better.","MoreThanWine","Nov 25, 2011"
