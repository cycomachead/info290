"Overall: Very mellow old ale with really well balanced, pleasant flavors. The ABV is all but hidden. Everything in here is wonderful, and it is a real easy drinker. Definitely recommended if you can find it."
""
"O: Hmph. I've had all of the Ola Dubh brews and I found them all to be surprisingly different. I didn't like the 30 very much but I liked the 18. The 12 was a little too mild on the barrel aging. This one is pretty damn close to ""just right"" along with the 18. This one is more complex though. Nice balance of flavors too. Really nice."

"I can't recall the other versions of this well so I can't comment on how this varies. A mild body and unique mix of caramel and scotch notes makes this very exciting."
"Awesome old ale. Can't wait to try the 30 yr."
"Bottle number 49393, January, 2009. Poured into a small snifter. Small head with low retention, as expected. Very, very deep mahogany, almost black body. Aroma is a mix of brandy, slight alcohol, overripe plums, dates and vanilla. Taste has a brandy quality, tongue coating, nice old fruit and slight molasses and vanilla. Wow. Quite a journey the liquid has taken to get into the glass and the wait was worth it."
""
"Full bodied with light carbonation, and creamy. Very smooth and easy to drink. Has a bit of a dark fruit aftertaste. This is nicely made, and recommended."

"O: A great tasting stout that screams ""aged in a whiskey barrel"" without being overdone."
""
"Overall I was hapy to give this a try but would be hard pressed to spend $20 on an 11.2oz bottle again - I will be trying at least the 18 and 30 in due time though"
""

"3.0 D: Normally I'd give this a 3.5 out of general good will, but I can't since this is so goddamn expensive. It's not a bad beer, but it has plenty of flaws and the mouthfeel sucks."
"O - Really enjoyed this. For $20 a bottle it would want to be a standout, but I wasn't let down."
"O: Goodish, but not worth the price jump. Would I recommend it? No. Would I drink it again if offered? Hell yes."
""
""
"Overall this one was great. Not good, but great. The taste was fantastic, smell was great, appearance was fantastic, but the mouthfeel was a noticeable flaw. Besides that, though, this was definitely a beer to seek out. Even with the very high price (think I paid around $18 for an 11.2oz) I would definitely buy this beer again. Yet more incentive to finish the available ones."

"Worth trying for sure if you can find it."
""

"O - yummy old ale here, whiskey aging (narrowly) adds another dimension. falls a bit short of being elite due to a somewhat lacking mouthfeel, and slightly oxidized taste. wondering if this one isnt best really fresh. would try again."
""

"single finger head with some scattered lacing on a jet black body without any light passing through. smokey and confectioners chocolate sweetness to the aroma. Incredibably smooth chocolate, toffee and vanilla flavor. Nicely complex with each flavor standing out. moderate carbonation and full bodied. Overall a very smooth and drinkable beer for its genre. Complex and memorable. An excellent beer though not very much like olde ales I have tried."
"D - lots of influence from the barrel, but the caramel and chocolate shine through. There is a but more sweetness than necessary but it is still a very nice beer."
"Overall: While I'm sure others won't agree, I'm giving this a perfect 5/5. This was amazing. While I have not had this brew fresh, three years of aging has done something incredible to this beer. Outstanding, one of my all time favorites, my highest recommendation. Expensive though...."
""
"A quick word on price: yes, this can be silly expensive in the bottle, you may end up paying over $20 for it. Is it that much better than the 12 year (which I rated a 4.4)? For some of you, it will be. If you have a whiskey-tooth and give this one the time and attention it deserves, it's worth the cash."
"(D)- Another great lineup in the Ola Dubh line. An extremely expensive bottle to say the least, but damn enjoyable. I still think the edge goes to the 30yr overall, now finally having every one in this lineup."

" deep caramel smell coming off of this, literally took me by surprise. Nice aroma of oak and alcohol mixing and swirling around with it now, really starting to pick up steam the warmer it got. Warm oak infused notes of brandy like alcohol running over the tongue, so sweet and sugary. As you roll it around you start to notice there is a little bit of a bitter bite to this one. Way down deep under all of the malt, there was a subtle bitter hoppiness, very grainy and earthy, but it was there, and really pushed through on the finish. Long drawn out finish it was, The alcohol was so well blended, it was a deadly combination. Soo mellow and smooth, understated, it lured you in and would not let you go. The body was as rich and smooth as the flavorDeep dark fruit now coming through for me, really started to actually dominate the scene all together. Huge raisin and plum notes giving it that sweet but yet tart dark fruit flavor we all come to love. A spicy touch in the back perhaps, but here comes that little bit of bitterness to wrap it all up."
"Near jet black, ring of bubbly off white head, light lace. Smell is iof roasted malt, peat, oak with bold whisky notes, vanilla, black liquorice, light anise scents. Taste is of roast malt, coffee, oak with subtle whisky but less than the nose indicates, lots of malt, mildly bitter and very complex, more whisky tones in the finish. Light carbonation, silky and creamy feel, full bodied. Very good stuff here, tasty and complex, truly amazing stuff."
""
"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Bottle No. 40857, January 2009. ABV is 8.0%. Pitch black colour, big tan head. Intense and lovely aroma of fine malt whisky, notes of oak and peat, hints of vanilla and dark chocolate. Strong flavour of dark malts and fine whisky, peaty and oaky notes, also notes of coffee, hints of liquorice and tar. Moderate bitterness in the finish. Pretty brilliant stuff."
"O - This has good drinkability. It is a sipper for sure, but it is definitely an interesting and good tasting beer. I think this has just right amount of smoke flavor. It is definitely there, but not overpowering. Overall, I thought this was a nice old ale, and I would definitely buy another bottle of it."
"O - I just love the complexity of this beer, and what it has to offer. The woodyness is present but not overpowering. As a fault I would have liked to have seen a little more Whiskey in the flavour."
"After trying every other offering in the series, I wasn't convinced that the more expensive bottles were more complex beers. Ola Dubh 40 was the first $20 beer that I wondered, not if I would be worthy of it, but whether it would be worthy of me. Turns out, I prefer the 16, 18, and 30. If I buy another Ola Dubh, it won't be this one."
"O: Overall this is one damn tasty brew. A lovely balance of beer and wood, with just a touch of peat in it. Delightful."
"There should be no surprise that this is just a world class beer. The barrel aging, texture, and flavors are all perfectly balanced. Which makes for an incredibly enjoyable drink. I don't know if I like this or the 30 better. Both amazing and highly recommended."
"A pleasure to sip, this was a fun brew, especially for a whisky drinker such as myself. Unfortunately, the price tag is pretty steep - buy one, hold on to it, enjoy."
"Bottle number 05777 and pours a thick black used engine oil hue which leaves a half finger head that quickly recedes and leaves little sporadic lacing,the smell is strong peated malts,smokey whiskey and a touch of oak,the mouthfeel feels more like a whiskey than a beer to me and is medium bodied and the taste is quite the same with hints of smokey whiskey,peated malts,oak,dark berries,a touch dark coffee and finished with twist of black cherries and dark bittersweet chocolate and overall out of all the versions i have had of this drop in different aged whiskey casks this is by far my least favourite as i think the whiskey really does overtake the nice characteristics that this brew does posess and its a little one sided for me cheers."
"Overall: Fantastic"
"Poured black color with a minimal brown creamy head that mostly diminished with good lacing. Heavy aroma of caramel, woody and toasted malt. Medium to full body with smooth texture and flat carbonation . Same as the other two, medium to heavy dark woody bourbon flavor with a medium to heavy smoked sweet whiskey finish of moderate duration. My expectations were met with a complex smooth brew."
"Quite nice. Frankly the closest to Highland Park 40 that I am likely to get."
"O: Between this and my review of OD 30, I think this bottle may in fact be compromised. The flavors are so lackluster that I can't help but feel I am not having the same bottle as a great deal of reviewers on this site. That said, The flavor characters remain in tact, but they are just so mellow and two-tone. Yes there is sweetness, and yes there is the barrel wood; but dare I ask, where is the flavor? Fruits make appearances like apparitions in a long since abandoned home, and I would like nothing more than than to revitalize their home. Phantom flavors don't belong in barrels, which makes me believe the bottle may be compromised to the point that I question even doing this review. However, considering the fact that I have reviewed the prior beers in a horizontal, I feel obligated to put it here. Please let me know I am wrong in saying this beer is bringing open handed-slaps to a boxing match. Hit me with flavor, don't leave me wanting."
"O: This one actually has me kind of shocked. I'm not sure if it's something wrong with this particular bottle but this was not really an enjoyable drink. After having had 12, 16, 30 and 40, I would say (surprising to me and it seems contrary to most reviewers) 12 and 16 were the best with 12 really standing out to me. 12 was something in the realm of exceptional, worth seeking out, 16 I don't remember as well but I remember thinking it was in the ball park of 12, 30 was kind of a disappointment but had its good points, and this 40 was just pretty bad. Again, not sure what to say, maybe something is up with my bottle but I wouldn't drink this again-- not even sure if I want to finish my glass."
"Yet another outstanding offering from the brewery’s Special Reserve series. Jet black in color, 40 has big Scotch whiskey notes in the nose and initial taste, complimented by hints of dark chocolate and sweet malt with a vanilla oakiness at the finish. An extremely well balanced beer, 40 is as rich and smooth as it is complex, and I believe that it’s the best offering in the series."
"Pours black with a white creamy head. Tastes roasty with some whiskey notes coming through the finish. Can definately pick up the whiskey notes more in the 40 year, compared to the 12 and 16. Insanely drinkable. I'd have no problem drinking a lot more of these if it wasn't for the price tag. Delicious beer though."
"I fell in love with this beer the first time I had it a few years ago now I've had the chance of having it again and it still kicks ass. The pour is a great black color with a tan head that leaves a nice ring around the top of the glass. The smell is so awesome, it's got a magical sweet smell. The whiskey wooden smell adds to it. It's hard to really explain but it's great. The beer tastes sweet and with a whiskey back bone. There is some vanilla in there not much chocolate but a little bit and a good amount of smokiness there too. The flavors are strong and very pleasing. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth with some light carbonation. The overall take on this brew is just really good in my opinion. I could drink a lot of this but it's very pricey."
"For what it is, extremely drinkable, but you'd better like Scotch. If not this could be tough sledding."
"O/D - Not bad. A little too oaky for me but it was still a good beer. One of the best of the series of course but the price tag is rough on the wallet. Worth a shot though, you won't be disapointed."
"O: One of the best barrel aged beers created with one of the best scotch barrels there are. I would definitly be interested to compare the other Ola Dubh Releases. Not a cheap bottle of beer though."
"O I really enjoyed this. It's a great, thick beer to enjoy slowly with a friend. It's wonderfully complex and full flavored without being overbearing."
"WS"
"SkÅL!"
"This is my least liked of the series, yet. I'd be willing to try this again, but will not actively seek it out."
"Notes: Carbonation is a little low, I would have liked a touch more effervescence. A sweet desert like beer that would be great as a digestif. No hop characters are left and the beer is full of whisky notes. It was difficult to spend the price they were asking for. This is probably the most expensive bottle of beer(in terms of $/oz.) that I bought at retail, but it is worth trying. It's not as amazing as I thought it would be, but still a very solid beer that I will remember for a long time. Now that the bottle is empty, there is no sediment, indicating that this beer was filtered. I doubt that this beer would improve any more with age."
"a fine aged sipping beer, the alcohol taste and the high price tag makes me question whether i would seek this out again."
"D: Very smooth flavor wise, nice sense of dark roasted malt but the scotch soaked cask notes were a bit much. I like some cask presence but the scotch notes were to a point where it overtook the general character of the beer which I could of achieved by grabbing some cheap scotch and watered it down. A slow moderate sipper at room temp, the lesser 16 came off much better and would recommend that instead."
"Cheers!"
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours black with no head or lacing. Nice pitch black color. The nose is really complex and intriguing with whiskey, oak, light vanilla, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of alcohol. The taste is a bit overly boozy but still quite nice with a lot of whisky and chocolate. The booze fits well in the feel as it's interspersed throughout and finishes nicely. Drinks well; nice sipper."
"Since the alcohol wasn't as overpowering as it is in some other barrel aged beers, I thought this was fairly drinkable. It is slightly hot and therefore a sipping beer...I enjoyed the bottle over about a 45 minute time frame. The price obviously limits this from being a beer you'd want to consume multiple bottles of in one sitting, but it is a fantastic beer to sit down with on a cool fall evening!"
"Im in love with it. Im so glad I had this."
"D: A fantastic beer, it has a level of complexity usually only found in a few Belgians, or a rich red wine. It's certainly worth trying, but at the price I probably won't be drinking it again for a while. (5.0)"
"Beer unlike anything I've ever drank. I knew that this beer was aged in barrels used for maturation of Single Malt 40 years Whisky, however, I could not imagine that the notes of whiskey would be so present and very well placed, giving a complexity to this different and sensational beer! Color: black that seems black oil. Viscous texture, almost like a liqueur. Aroma of vanilla, oak, whiskey, something smoked, roasted malts, bitter chocolate and coffee, all that just in aroma! Flavor of roasted malt, sweet, sour, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, wine (Madeira and Porto) and especially whiskey and oak wood. Low carbonation and long aftertaste of whiskey, alcohol and coffee. I recommend to everyone!"
"Pours a great pitch black in color with a great tan head and nice bit of lacing. It has a wonderful scent, part coffee, part whisky, part malt, part hop, with just a bit too much of the scent tending towards the Scotch side. Wonderful taste, the whiskey flavor is very much there, and unfortunately dominates, even more so than the other aged versions; still has some nice dark roasted malt attributes, though, and it shouldn't be a surprise that it's so whisky flavored. It goes down fairly smooth -- exceptionally for an aged beer."
"D- Im glad I split this bottle because I did not dig the huge whiskey tastes. No way I could enjoy a whole bottle of this to the head. I really enjoyed the lighter versions of this (12, 16) but this is a bit too much for me. Perhaps a few years of aging will tone down the whisk, but that's what this beer is all about, so I'll just pass this one on the shelves forever now, no need for a redo."
"D: Thanks again liam, this beer is fantastic. It would be interesting to compare the other years against it, but that would require a good liver."
"D- this is a whiskey bomb but if you like deep complex whiskey flavor this is a brew for you. I find its depth a bit of a handful and I love my spirits."
"very balanced, great."
"D: A sipper for sure--something to sit back with for a couple hours (much more like a Scotch)."
"A lovely union of ale and whisky making expertise. Eminently enjoyable and drinkable for every reason but the price - 18 Canuckbucks, and in Ontario only, for that matter. That said, it was difficult to ignore this offering, given that I recently finished the 12 and 18 year old Highland Park malt whiskies, and trying the 40 year old, by proxy, I just couldn't say no. Like the fine whiskies, worth trying once for the extravagance alone."
"I absolutely loved the 12, this one is a little over-the-top & not as balanced. It's more of an American Extreme brew than an English old ale."
"Very dark, nearly black, with not much in the way of visible edges. It had a thick tan/brown cap of very fine bubbles, good head retention with sticky, spotty lacing. Great aroma. Lots of whisky character when the bottle was opened, more of a refined alcohol that you get from a good scotch rather than a boozy nose. Notes of caramel and vanilla, lots of malt, a hints of chocolate and smoke, plus a bit of oak. Mild to moderate bitterness, toffee and caramel sweetness, whisky, light vanilla and woodiness. There was a bit of wood tannin dryness and booze, but it stayed refined and pleasant throughout. Full bodied with low carbonation made of up fine bubbles. Mild warmth and a tingle of alcohol on the tongue. Nice texture. I quite enjoyed this. The marriage of beer and whisky really worked."
"D-One bottle is enough for me given the price and the fact that I dont think i could have another one. Although it was quite an experience."
"330ml bottle from the LCBO. Pours pitch black with a thin cap of tan head and dots of lacing on the snifter. Aroma is oak barrel, whisky, almonds, sweet dark fruit, and herbal English hops. A bit creamy. Taste is chocolate and roasted malts, woody and bitter, some liquor, raisins, a little hop spice, and a toasted, flaked oat finish, very dry and chalky. As the beer warms it becomes more vinous and fruity, but its not as bold, flavourful, or complex as I expected. I let it sit for 45 minutes before drinking, so the temperature can't be a problem. Mouthfeel is velvety, slick, oily, parched and oaky aftertaste, a tad boozy. Overall, this is a damn fine ale, with most of the technical elements that define the style, yet the taste underwhelms, and I don't love it like I thought I would."
"While the price on this beer is exceptional and I am not entirely convinced it warrants it, this is a truly remarkable beer. Very complex yet simply drinkable."
"drinkability is good. nice balance, hiding its alcohol well. the barrel is very dominant, but seems to work pretty well. not sure it's my favourite of the ola dubhs, but it's a tasty beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly oily, low to medium carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden, really nice scotch flavours in this one."
"D: Seeing as this is meant to be a one and done, it is incredible. I am only getting into it, but I will want more when I am done. Too bad it is so expensive. I might still pick up a couple more for the cellar."
"Overall., better than the 18 year. However it is not like beer, but more of a whiskey. Fairly drinkable for what it is."
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color ale with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet roasted malt with dominating notes of warming scotch is quite enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by loads of scotch notes with some light vanilla and oak with marries very well with the base sweetness form the malt. Body is quite full with a creamy texture and some good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Very well done and would buy some again even with the steep price tag."
"Medium-full bodied with low carbonation. It has a slick, viscuous mouthfeel appropriate for something whose name means Black Oil. With it's dense, layered flavour and 9% ABV, this one is definately a sipper. It's also a sipper that leaves you in anticipation of each mouthful right down to the bottom of your glass. It's almost too easy to sip on it faster than would be sensible. Fantastic beer."
"Pours a three finger light tan head that fades very slowly to a thin layer, leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Strong whiskey nose. Medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Flavor is sweet burnt coffee and whiskey. Nice old ale but so is Harviestoun's 12 year that is $9 cheaper. Ages well, bottled 1/2009. Beyond expensive at $18.00 for ONE 330ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Drinkability: Moderate at best -- the extreme smokey and ""meatiness"" really isn't my thing (not that I don't mind smoke as an aspect to a beer, but I feel it's a bit overdone here); I did enjoy this beer, but at $18 a bottle and at 8%, drinking too much would certainly be out of the question for me."
"I had the Ola Dubh 12 earlier today and while they are fairly similar, I prefer this one due to the extra flavour from the scotch."
"D - The taste makes this entirely drinkable, and at a relatively low 8% could definately do more than a few."
"D: I liked the 30 on cask a little more. This beer is a whiskey lover's dream. A really awesome beer that I was lucky to be able to try on cask."
"Thick, substantial mouthfeel. Very rich and smooth, and a nice, dry finish to it. Drinkable, even with the 8% ABV."
"The little medallion with the mouse is pretty awesome too."
"Drinkability is definitely higher than it should be. It is delicious and goes down quite smoothly."
"Cheers!"
"Great to drink. You better like scotch, which I do. A treat of a beer and the best in the series."
"Ola Dubh 30 - perfect barrel character, which blends in decadently with chocolate from the Old Engine Oil (4.75)"
"I love Old Engine Oil and I love this. I'd been led to believe that it wasn't worth the price, but I have no regrets."
"Pours an opaque darkness with a shallow light tan head that fades quickly leaving little lacing behind. The smell is nice; boozy sweet roasted malt coffee cherry vanilla tangy character. The mouth has a lightly carbonated yet spicy..if not 'hot' creamy smooth texture to it. Full flavored, the taste is spicy, peppery bourbon vanilla caramel. More of a sipper; the 8% ABV is less than anticipated. This one has more heat than I would've thought. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat though...can you imagine the 'rent' required for the floorspace of a 40 year old barrel???? OMG. How does that fit any business model? Really glad that I had the opportunity to consider it. Highly recommended."
"Pours black with no head. Like a cask in a bottle, but there is some carbonation. A sipper, with whiskey, dark fruit even imperial stout characteristics with a tad of roast and chocolate. Richness in taste, above average mouthfeel. Some sweetness helped. Have with a full meal."
"11.2 ounce bottle, bottle 54407, bottled on January 20, 2009. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours very dark brown with a half inch tan head. Head retention is good, but not much lacing. The brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit, smoke, peat, iodine, oak, and vanilla. The Scotch Whisky aromas are pretty strong in this brew! The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it's all Scotch and malt. And as far as I'm concerned, that's a good thing. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has low/moderate carbonation and it's a little bit coating although it does seem a bit thin at times. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and pretty easy to drink. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, but then I like malty beers and Scotch. That and I liked the other Ola Dubh beers I've tried. This beer isn't cheap at all, but it's definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability...well...no. Not for $18.40. I could get three Ola Dubh 12s for less than that and I'd enjoy them just a little bit more. Really, I understand and appreciate why this costs as much as it does. I just don't think there's enough of a payoff in the flavor to warrant spending that much."
"Potent - whisky sharpness shows on this one. It has a dark malty, lightly smoked character along with the wood/whisky barrel character. Very nice, though not worth the $20 an 11.2 oz. bottle for this one, IMO."
"Low carbonation and a slightly thin mouthfeel. Damn drinkable beer. After a weekend of IPAs this is refreshing on the palate."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown, black and opaque in the snifter, with a dark brown head that quickly settles to a disc. Aromas of baking chocolate, smoke and peat are most prominent. There's a hint of heat from the Scotch barrel. The taste closely resembles the aroma, with baking chocolate and smoke up front, followed by subtle peat. The beer is medium-bodied and dry. The barrel character is well-integrated but quite dominant; a bolder base beer may have been better suited for Scotch barrels. Good stuff all the same."
"The Kings Of Hops"
"This beer in insanely smooth. Some woody notes in the flavor, really sweet up front, almost nothing in the back, medium body, great mouthfeel, drinkability really high. No aftertaste. Beautifully balanced beer all around."
"Overall a fantastic beer, probably one of my favorites."
"Poured a dark black color with a small sized tan head. Aromas of whisky, chocolate, some earthiness, roast, smoke, and wood. Tastes of whisky (more than the aromas), vanilla, smoke, wood, roast, and some dark fruits. Light alcohol in the finish."
"Drinkability- I wish it weren't only available in a cask and so rare, because I would love to drink this beer all day long."
"Not my favorite of the Ola Dubh series."
"Pours a dark stout body dark brown not yet black. Head is nice and bubble and light brown. Smells of smooth oak and raisens and coco. Taste smooth buttery front with not much in the middle then a oak barrel and alcohol finish. Very very smooth. At times it seems almost flavorless. Great balance. Moth feel is oily slick a little foamy. The drinkability is insane so smooth so balanced. Amazing."
"This brew pours black as night (looked more stout than old ale) w/ a thin tan head. Beautiful lacing that continued to hang on the glass throughout the sampling. The nose on this one was of strong chocolate and roasted espresso beans up front w/ oak, light scotch, and vanilla pipe tobacco in the background. Taste was pretty much on point w/ the nose, with the addition of burnt toffee, woodiness, and a slight alcohol warmth on the finish. Medium bodied - kinda slick on the tongue, and leaves dry and clean. This was an enjoyable offering, but this is more scotch than beer in my opinion, which takes away from it's drinkability. Definate sipper. Not that it matters to the review, but this one is extremely pricey @ $19.99/11.2oz. bottle. Overall, not amazing, but nice and would sample again anytime."
"I'm going to have to re-visit the other Ola Dubh brews to compare them against this one. If you're a Scotch whiskey lover this is worth trying for sure."
"Like the Ola Dubh 30, this one is dark brown with a dark brown head. Retention is poorer, but this still is a good looking beer. Again, the nose is smoky, peaty, chocolate-y, but smoother, milder and a little more delicate. The peat is a little bit more, and the smoke, a little less. Excellent stuff. Not very boozy, and the whisky notes are incredible. On the palate, the nose is replicated, opening up with the whisky, along with a mild licorice, brown sugar, nuttiness. Finishing rather dry and smoky with some whiskey, this beer is a treat. Excellent stuff"
"Had this on cask, gravity poured at the Brick Store Pub. I'm a great lover of whisky or whiskey laced beers, at least via the barrel, and this one is no exception. Superb, and my favorits of the series after the 30 year cask. Pours black with no head, but no worries here. Smells of peat, the barrel, and whisky. Very smooth and balanced and not in the least bit hot- compared to say, the 18 which was quite so. The taste is beautifully balanced with lots of restrained whiskey character. Briny, smooth, peaty, malty, and simply whiskyish. Wonderful. Ultra smooth in the mouth and deliciously drinkable."
"30 on cask is still my favorite, but this one is still a gem. Several of my favorite barrel-aged beers are Scotch aged, and this one reinforces that streak."
"I really enjoyed this one, especially the taste which was very well balanced given the barrel aging. Very tasty."
"The run of casks leading up to the Ola Dubh 40 yr at the Brick has been fun. 40 yr was certainly an exciting pour. Looks very similar to the 30 yr in that it is an ink black, this one has little to almost no head though. Very low carbonization, as well, it really looks like ink, really... The whiskey smell is apparent, with some sweet malt hints. A very warming feeling as soon as it hits your mouth, the whiskey is once again significantly present. There is some , maybe caramel, sweetness in the background that provides an interesting dynamic to the whiskey. I enjoyed drinking this to start off my evening at the Brick, but the strength of it, and the whiskey, makes it more of a beer that stands on it own. Definitely a distinct, and delicious flavor."
"Overall this is one of those Sam Adams/Calagione ""extreme beers"" that pushes the limits of what beer can be. The whiskey flavors are as intense as any beer I've had, but it still manages not to go too far over the threshold. Be sure to give this one a shot if you can."
"Gravity Pour from a 40L Steel Cask at The Brick Store Pub - Pours pitch black almost completely opaque with a small one finger head that immediately recedes. Smells mostly of whisky with some burnt roasted malts in the nose. First sip is tangy with a rush of whisky being by far the most dominate flavor. There is chocolate and a tad of coffee along with some burnt malts and dark fruits all a supporting role. As it warms, some vanilla and smoke appear adding to the beer's complexity. There is absolutely no carbonation present and the beer is fairly light bodied. I sipped this in a vertical of Old Engine Oil, 12 Year, 30 Year, and a shot of 12 Year old single malt Highland Park Whisky. The difference between the 30 and the 40 year versions were minuet."
"Very interesting beer. The whiskey barrel aging is evident in the nose, but not overly so. Sweet, but not cloying. The taste reminded me of the sweetness found in dark bread. The finish was complex, with cabernet notes. Might have had a second if it wasn't so expensive ($16 US) and this isn't a style of beer I usually drink."
"A nice beer, though I'm not sure it's any better then the 30. Unless they were priced similarly, I would probably always get the 30."
"D -Def. a sipper, stands up to any whiskey barrel ale i've had before"
"Overall, this was a fantastic brew. I would highly recommend."
