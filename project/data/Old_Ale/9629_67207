3.9,-3.5,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/8/2014. Pours hazy/cloudy dark reddish brown color with a small dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, apple, fig, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, apple, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, apple, light chocolate, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice old ale style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 11, 2015"

4.17,3.2,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style without being overly sweet or overly boozy.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, the alcohol was well hidden, not too crisp, a little creamy, slightly sticky, a little filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I think two would be my limit and I think this would be a nice beer to sip on during a cold night.  What I like the most about this beer was the taste, appearance and drinkability, they were all very nice and to me they were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad at all, but I wish it was much more balanced.  I would buy this beer again, it sold out pretty quickly around here, but if Short's makes it again this year I would try to get a couple six pack and I have a couple to age so I can see how it changes over time.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Old Ales, if your a fan of the style I think it's worth a try.  All in all I enjoyed this beer, it lived up to my expectations and I think it makes for a nice Wintertime beer especially during this cold weather.  I think it's one of the better Short's Beers and I think it's a good and true to style example of the style.  Great job guys, this is one tasty Old Ale, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Jan 05, 2015"
