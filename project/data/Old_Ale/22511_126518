However, im at a lost as to how to score this appropriately since this apprently falls into the grey area of old ales and whether they are accurately portrayed as boozy malt bombs or wild ales... regardless i enjoyed it.","stakem","Oct 08, 2014"

3.7,-8.4,,,,,,"Pour is dark copper brown, virtually opaque, with a tight small bubbled tan head.  Nose is assertive brett, strong dry leather, toasted malts, caramel, and a touch of malty berry sweetness.  Taste is stronger malt and a bit sweeter.  Brett is there, leathery for the most part, toasted malts and caramel mid palate, a fair bit of cherry sweetness.  It has a fairly high bitterness through the finish, incredibly soft body, and clean light carbonation.","cpetrone84","Oct 06, 2014"

Smell is woody with dark fruit soaked in bourbon followed immediately by a brett-funk, butterscotch and a light roast. Taste is tart upfront, oak with dark fruit, bourbon and caramel flavours, quite delicious. Medium carbonation, fairly full drying body. Really nice, good mix of tart and malt with a nice barrel character.","peensteen","Sep 15, 2014"

All I can say is that the taste is consistent with a very well-made flanders oud bruin. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a light carbonation and some acidity. Overall - I can't really describe this as an old ale; however, I found it quite enjoyable.","Jwale73","Jul 23, 2014"

4.3,6.4,,,,,,"Not really sure what an old ale is, but this comes across to me more like a flanders/old bruin sorta thing with a great oak presence from the barrel.
