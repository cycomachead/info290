"Pours with a small, white head. Dark amber in color, with a slight murkiness to it. Although it is not a pale ale, it has a pale ale smell with a pale ale taste, just not as citrusy and hoppy as a pale ale. Overall, an above average ale."

"Very nice winter ale... piñon like aftertaste. Smooth and enjoyable."
"Overall, a fairly interesting brew. Maybe just a touch odd."

"Overall, well, I like it as a beer. I haven't had too many old ales. If anything, I know this goes pretty good with food and in my opinion, smoked salmon."

"Nice drinkable old ale for a cold evening."

"O: It isn't the most appealing of brews at first glance by scent or sight. However, the flavor is unique and it is a very drinkable beer overall. I was kind of thrown for a loop with it being classified as an old ale (think Hibernation ale by Great Divide), which are generally darker, fruitier, and more complex. This drinks like a Kolsch or Summer ale almost with a slight hint of more wintery oriented brews. Great taste, but lacking in the overall niceties you want from an all-around strong old ale. The characteristics are there, but not enough in my opinion. For my first Alaskan beer though, I am fairly satisfied and could easily drink a few of them in one sitting. Will have to check out more of their selection."
"Very nice. While I wasn't sure at first, I also pick up on tartness that really reminds me of wild Alaskan blueberries (which I'm very familiar with) in both aroma and taste. I don't don't know where it's coming from, but I like it. Overall, this is an ale that doesn't overpower in any area, but is balanced and integrated as well as unique. Subtlety is key, using only the tips, and not the whole tree!"

"Pours golden red and clear, with only a bit of head that dissipates very quickly.  Little if any lace on the sides of the glass.  Aromas of roasted malt, banana, baked apple, bread, a wee bit of piney hops.  This is a very sweet beer (as a winter ale should be), with some tanginess from the spruce.  Lightly carbonated.  The spruce gives it a bit of a drier character than you would expect with a winter ale.  Not a very long finish.  Overall an enjoyable beer, although I am not particular fond of spruce tips as flavoring."

"Poured a clear amber body with no real head. It looks alright, though not the best for the style. Scents of fruity esters, apple, sweet malt with aromas of brown sugar, sweet spices, especially cinnamon and light bubblegum. Overall impression of aroma is of a sweet Old Ale that is quite appealing in its overall profile and true to the style. The spruce tips do not show up in the aroma which is disappointing. Flavor begins malty sweet with notes of brown sugar, apple and brown bread, with a light spiciness of cinnamon and a very light resinous bitterness, likely the spruce tips. This moves into a middle with more abundant cinnamon, as well as a light a alcohol presence. Finish is lightly sweet with notes of apple, sweet malt and brown sugar mingling with cinnamon and sweet spices and balanced by a light presence of alcohol and a slight bitterness. Aftertaste is lightly bitter with notes of cinnamon, alcohol, what I assume is spruce and grainy malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a nice Old Ale, spicy and sweet, but not cloying and with a nice bitterness in the background. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with medium-light carbonation. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very smooth, easy to drink beer. Overall this is a rather nice Old Ale. It is sweet and spicy as the style demands, and despite it's 6.4% ABV it shows its alcohol well, which is pleasant for a winter's night. It is smooth and easy going down and quite pleasant."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, best before 3/15/2015. Pours slightly hazy bright orange color with a small dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, pear, apple, berries, spruce, herbal, grass, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, spruce, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, pear, apple, berry, spruce, herbal, grass, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, pear, apple, berry, spruce, herbal, grass, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt, spruce, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice old ale style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, spruce, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is partly foamy (2/5) and otherwise smooth (3/5). This is an appropriate and fine feeling for this type of ale. Closes semi-dry, with light to moderate stickiness clinging to the lips and palate."
""
""
"Winter Ale pours a darker copper color with a small non lacing head. There is a very sweet fruity and piney aroma. The taste has a sharp malt backbone, lots of pine, citrus flavors; sweet. A bit too sweet, and a little too flat. Overall it is pretty sweet, and fruity, the spruce tips make it unique."
"Overall a nice Amber Ale. You must like sweet beers."
"When I was taking notes on it I thought it was a winter warmer, but looking back it could be stretched to fit in with old ale, as styles are open to interpretation. Whatever the case, it makes a nice winter ale."
""
""
"Pours out a translucent maroon in color with a small white head with little retention. Smell is of dark fruits, sweet sugar, dark malts, with a tad of orange. The components in the are pretty subdued but present. Taste is basically what was in the nose except a tad more malty and there is a tad of bitterness. The tastes are all quite subdued as they were in the nose. Mouthfeel is semi-thin which seems reasonable for the style. Overall this is a decent beer not is it anything too great. It's pretty good but I like my winter beers in a different style."

"Overall: This is a fairly nice beer. The local spruce is a nice twist, but it may be a little sweet for my taste. That artificial cherry flavor is kind of unexpected and bizarre. Thankfully the sweetness doesn’t hang heavy on my tongue, but I definitely would not order a second round. If repeat orders are the measure of a successful pint, I guess this one has failed. But I certainly don’t regret purchasing this single bottle, and may consider another one next year (3.25/5)."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall: I really don't understand how this beer could be an old ale. If anything it's a winter warmer, but it doesn't really fit anything in particular. This beer is by far the worst old ale I've ever had, it not an awful beer, just an awful old ale. It doesn't have any real dark fruit presents or alcohol intensity."

"Totally satisfying, though doesn't touch the outer realms of my favorite old ale, Bells Third Coast Olde Ale (arguably more of a barley wine, anyway)."

"I had to try this because of the spruce tips & I give props, always, to Alaskan for having an unpopular German style (alt) as a year-round brew but this one just didn't cut it for me. Longest a six-pack has lasted in my fridge."

"Pours Triaminic orange with pretty much zero head, just a little perimeter of foam. Nose is actually a little tough to get anything from, smells a little sweet and lightly hopped, but not detecting the spruce tips the packaging says it's brewed with. There is a real berry-like quality in the flavor, and I was getting a little of that in the nose, too. It's got a blackberry jam element to it...is that spruce tips? I don't know. All I know is this tastes really freakin good. Nice medium mouthfeel, bitter on the back end, some detectable alcohol, but not a huge-alcohol beer, really. Low carbonation. Overall, I like this one quite a bit, and would get it again."

"Simple old ale, plenty of spice notes and a grainy malt backbone. Much better than Alaskan's amber as a winter session beer. Not a bad beer, rather middle of the road, interesting to try."

"O-This beer gets points for originality and for not over-doing it on the spruce tips. Usually, tree is quite bitter tasting, but here, the tree pairs well with other flavors. I would not want to drink it every day, but it made for a good winter brew, so extra points for truth in marketing."

"Presentation: Packaged in a stubby twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely unlike other winter ales, very drinkable and mild, its just not as spicy as I would expect. Others are too spicy but this one just doesn't feel like a winter ale. Still a good beer though."
""
""
"Amber pour with a thinnish head, minimal lace. Smell is crackers, bread, malt, with a lightness that may be spruce, but its certainly not piney. Taste is a solid cracker crust malt base, quite tasty, with a nice helping of hop leaving the palate lightly refreshed, a hint of bubblegum and perhaps lemon toward the end. Nice medium body with a hefty, well crafted feel. Easy drinker."

"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Appearance is good enough on the front end, although quickly deteriorates. Nose is, however, a really nice floral bready thing going on with some sweet notes. Flavor is a hoppy, sweetened, bitter experience. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
"Tried this ale at a bar and really enjoyed it. Found it at my local liquor store and bought a sixer. Poured it in a glass, and had at it. Smell's great, tastes better hints of fruit and spice, and I dare say minty finish but not too sweet or minty. One beer turned into 2 then 3 and I actually drank 4 of them I was so intruiged by the taste. Really nice Ale! Awesome Winter beer!"
""
"I would definitely like a six pack. I just wish the labeling were more appealing so that more people might discover it."
""
"Going to keep this short and sweet. This beer us sub-par on multiple levels. Numerous pours lead to little or no head, and what stays around evaporates quickly. The smell is light and slightly aromatic with the spruce tips hardly noticeable. This tastes like a ightly upgraded lager, low in carbonation and just disappointing all around. Will not but this again."
""
""
""

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours an orange-gold amber with a thin white head that dissipates to small patches of foam and slight slippery lacing. Aroma of sweet bready malt and light fruit. Flavor of sweet malt, grain, a hint of toasted malt and hint of spruce. Skates on the edge of too sweet, but sweetness is balanced by the malt and apple and grape juice flavors. Light to medium bodied. A pleasant light flavored ale with an interesting pine flavor from the spruce, but not nearly malty enough to be an old ale. I enjoyed it, but not what I expected."
"O- Pretty good, when i think of a winter warmer, gingerbread and spices come to mind. This one has taken the fruitcake aspect of the holidays. It's very fruity and sweet, but never overbearing. If someone offered me it, i would graciously accept it, but i don't see myself buying it again."
"Overall - Not exceptional in any way, but this is a good, well-rounded beer. One I like to have at least once a year during the winter months, especially if it's on tap. The flavor of the spruce tips does well to add a uniqueness to this beer, a character you don't often see in other winter seasonal offerings."
""
""
"O: I was expecting an old ale, certainly a bit maltier than this beer was, but all in all, tasty and easy drinking."
""
"O: A surprise from Alaskan Brewing, will probably buy a six pack soon."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice golden amber color with a thick frothy off white head. The aroma is slightly fruity with a hint of caramel. It tastes bready and malty with some lemon and spruce. The beer is very smooth, medium bodied with a long satisfying finish. Very nice beer here, would definitely drink this again."
"Wow, I really like this brew! Poured it a bit warm and I think that was a good idea as the spruce tips really come out, giving a sweet, ripe berry component. Poured with a smallish, cream-colored head that soon settled out to a few islands and a ring with a bit of lace. Color is a medium clear amber with huge amounts of bubble trails. Aroma is malt, caramel, toffee, fruit, wet grain. Flavor's like nose, on the sweet side, but not overly; sweet and carbonic tang are in front with just enough bitter to balance it all nicely. Body and carbonation are perfect. Finish is like flavor, lingers for a while, has a slight booziness, and is so drinkable. Curious to see if it's this good a little colder."
"o - disappointing beer overall. it had some good points but i did not get any spruce flavors or aromas here."
""
"overall a unique and understated brew that delivers subtle yet tasty ale drinking enjoyment. i might have to revisit this at some point this upcoming winter. hits the spot on the first real cold spell this november. go try it."

"An excellent winter ale. Flavorful with interesting taste complexities. Nicely balanced with a subtle boldness. Tasty and easy drinking..."
"O- This beer is not what I expected out of an old ale, but damn is good. Lots of big fruity flavor and a minty freshness."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, coded bottle date. This pours an amberish color with a smaller but decent off white head with a med retention length. The smells are light but nice, a little sweet, some caramel malts, some spruce, berries. The feel is medium with higher carbonation. The taste is high malts, a little bitterness and some berries."
""
"This looks fantastic, a glowing amber with a toasted white cotton puff atop it. Thick & cloudy like the SF fog. The bouquet is pleasantly piney, like an evergreen or pine forest, backed by an orange marmalade note. Flavor has a mild bitterness, and there’s some definite pine notes, and a sweetish caramel malt finish. Smooth and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer from Alaskan. Would buy again and recommend to friends."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste has more of the blueberry-esque fruitiness with a grainy sweetness that screams honey. Very smooth and easy drinking ale, although it does plenty to stand apart from your typical winter offering. I like it, the mouthfeel is full and silky and flows from malty to fruity to mild finish quite well. I'll buy this again for sure...good beer."
""
""
""
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is full of honey, dark fruit, toffee, caramel and a hint of alcohol. The flavor is similar. The spruce comes through in the flavor, adding a bit of a herbal, minty quality. I also get some honey and the associated sweetness, as well as some grape and cherry notes. The alcohol is not present in the flavor, which makes the beer quite easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice winter beer."

"Nice use of spruce. I was glad to have tried this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I probably wouldn't grab this one again. Not special enough and the sweet flavor is off-putting."
""
""
"Personally, I would have liked more body, but the rich flavors, great malty/spicy tango, and incredibly unique spruce flavors makes this another beer that will be keeping me warm through the harsh winters of MN."
""

"My first beer from Alaskan Brewing Co., and not a bad one. It's not going to touch Odell Isolation, but it's solid."

""
"Drinkability: Good beer that I wish I could find again."
"This one is weird. Like many others, I couldn't pin down the aroma. I was out and about and didn't care to be bothered smelling it for 10 minutes so I dove in. Really enjoyed the sweet spucy taste to it. Definitely different. I'll have it again if I see it on tap, but I won't go out of my way for it."
""
""
"Mouthfeel was smooth and light."
"The beer started with a biscuity aroma and presented a copper color. The initial taste was a surprising sour flavor. This lemon flavor was a surprise for a winter ale. The sourness stays on the tongue nicely to the finish. It is smooth without a bothersome level of carbonation. Though pleasing, the beer is a little one-dimensional in terms of the flavor."
"This beer is enigmatic. A light-bodied, sprucy old ale? The elements combine well, forming something that I enjoy, but have a hard time describing. It's malty, kinda, and spicy, kinda, and good all around."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear honey orange with a 1 inch puffy orange-white head that settle to a film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace drip down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt, malt powder, caramel, toffee, and a distinct banana aroma. Taste is of sweet malt, caramel, toffee, banana, and a certain herbal quality that I will attribute to the spruce tips used in the brewing of this beer. The aftertaste is slightly bitter and has a toasty quality. This beer has a nice level of carbonation with a crisp and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that I enjoyed quite a lot. I had this one before and I don't remember liking it all that much. I am glad I picked up another bottle to revisit."
""
""
"O - Overall, not too bad. I'm glad I had this while I'm home for the holidays, because as far as I know, I can't get Alaska Brewing out in Nebraska."
""
""
""
""
" nothing special about the mouthfeel, normal. I liked the nos eand taste better when it warmed."
""
""
""
"overall- there wasn't much to the taste, yet it was easy to drink and worth the $1.48 for a 12oz at 6.4%"

"Alaska Winter Ale: Some friends brought over a six of the Alaska Winter Ale the other weekend. In a glass, this beer has a deep color with an orange look to it. Very interesting. The head is of average thickness and off-white. Aroma is subtle and hard to pinpoint. The Winter ale goes down smooth, and has a nice balance, it is not too sweet and does not have any bitter or overly hoppy component to it. There is an unusual flavor to this brew that I cannot pinpoint. This is not a bad thing. I did enjoy this Alaskan offering, even if it has been a challenge to review. The label says it is brewed with spruce tips, which must impart the flavor that escapes my ability to describe. Give it a try!"
"Overall, this is a strange beer that I don't quite understand. It doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't sit right on my tongue."
""
""
"Overall: Good for a winter all, good for a sprucy introduction."
"Overall I found this really different and interesting. The sweet candy taste is quite enjoyable. The flavors are wintery but not at all like the average winter warmer. A must try if you get the chance."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, with average carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. Light biscuit malt aftertaste. This is another nice, easy to drink beer from Alaskan Brewing. I could drink this again easily."
"Dr: Very drinkable. The price could be better. I'd definitely have it again. Quite lovely indeed."
"O: I seem to remember this being more satisfying in the past - must be my palate."
"Overall: A pretty solid winter warmer. The spruce tips add a interesting twist."
"Throughout Southeast Alaska, bald eagles can be spotted landing atop the towering old growth forests of Sitka spruce trees. As many as 3,000 bald eagles congregate among these evergreen trees on the shores of the Chilkat River for the last large run of salmon before winter. Sitka spruce trees carry a significance of their own to local Alaskans. The tender new growth of the spruce tips lends a delicious, yet subtly sweet floral aroma to teas, jelly and now our Alaskan Winter Ale."
""
""
"This has been a go-to winter ale for me for years. There's just something about the balance of flavors that I love."
""
""
"This one was a bit of an eye opener for me. I expected nothing and was pleasantly surprised with a very tasty winter beer. It's very drinkable compared to some other winter style warmers. The sweetness is very nice and tasty."
""
""
"Shurg. While nothing extraordinary, this is still a pretty good beer. All things considered, this is an enjoyable, easy to appreciate and drink winter ale from Alaskan brewing. Definitely a nice beer to have on hand at an airport facility."
""
"Overall this is one of my favorite easy to get, not over priced brews."
""
"I used to like this beer years ago when I was first getting into the craft beer scene. I remember the pine flavor being prevalent but not overpowering. But this most recent tasting was very different. The prevailing flavor was cough syrupish. I hope that this is due to a recipe change and they go back to the original, because if it's my taste buds that are to blame for this reversal in flavor then all hope is lost for this beer."
""
"Should be advertised and labeled as a fruit flavored beer and take spruce off the label. Then I would of never bought a six pack of this. Not enjoying the flavor."
"3.5, 2, 2, 3.5, 2"
""
"Had a pint at 3 Squares in Maple Grove, MN. It was a smooth, slightly sweet with fruity notes. It reminds me a bit of Summit Winter Ale from St. Paul. It's a nice beer for a cold winter day, but it's a little more simple than I'd like. Sure, it's not too sweet or heavy, but a little crisp, clean malt character or spice would go a long way."
""
""
"Overall this is a decent Winter Warmer, but it could use a bit more depth in flavor and a heavier body. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a nice copper color with a few centimeters of foam above. The aroma is malty with caramel and ripe fruit in the nose. A faint hint of spruce lingers in the background. On the palate the malt is a little husky up front. A fruitiness, almost berry like rises through the center as the spruce and malt comingle. It finishes with a light pop of spice which balances everything. An interesting twist to a winter staple."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a clear copper color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel, and toffee. The taste is similar to the aroma. It is pleasant, but quite simple and straight forward. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture, and high carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but i highly doubt I will drink it again."
"Overall- This winter warmer is awfully bland, just loads up on the malt. It would have been nice to have really noticed spruce any where in this beer. If you're going to say it is there on the bottle, it should be IN the bottle too."
"Worth looking into if you want something with a psuedo Belgian-y fruitiness and holiday spicing that stands apart from the crowd by having spruce tips in it. My main complaint is that distracting light undertone of metallic flavor...get rid of that, tweak the carbonation slightly, add a bit of earthy hop tones, and this could be something really amazing."
"Just not too pleasing for me."
"D - Light on the spruce and easily drinkable but a bit boring. Not on the ""spiced"" level of most winter warmers."
"I can understand why other reviews question this beer's categorization as a Winter Warmer. It isn't something that I would sip by the fire to warm me up. But it IS a great winter session beer for watching sports. It's unique and growing taste makes it an 'A' beer in my book."
"The flavor isn't that great imo. It is just like the most basic golden ale you could imagine. Slightly buttery with a hint of spruce."
"Overall, I'm not disappointed that the spruce tips didn't come through. The malty, bready, fruity aspects of this beer make it the best winter warmer I've found at my local grocer yet. It's not complex, but that just lends to its charm. It's honest, simple, affordable, and just mixes well with winter in a way few beers can."
"O- A good winter beer that takes a different perspective than the standard spicebombs a lot of brewers make."
"was real stoked for the spruce tip component. had a brilliant spruce tip casked ipa this summer and thought this might be similar. it wasnt at all, but not in a bad way. pours a perfectly clear maple syrup color with the slightest red hue to it. super carbonated head that fades quickly, tons of bubbles rising up from what i thought was a clean pint glass. bubbles never stopped. nose is slightly sugary, and deep. a glorious but gentle waft of pine appears in the nose too. i cant get the spruce in the taste though, possible a pine sap stickyness, but none of that christmas tree vibe. does have a residual spice element, maybe anise, and also a fruity element, maybe ground cherries or plums. mouthfeel is just way too thin for a winter warmer, but it works under another name. first alaskan won't be my last"
"Overall one of your more easy drinking winter seasonals that imparts a taste of the great Alaskan outdoors during winter. Not a bad choice for holiday gatherings. The higher abv gives it some more warming power."
"Overall: I really don't understand why they made this so damn sweet. Should have finished drier or added noticeable hops or maybe actually made something noteworthy with those spruce tips. I am starting to feel that the 12 ounce offerings from Alaskan are just not worth my time or money anymore."
"T- its tasty and smooth and malty..a good WW, easy to drink i sixer for the whole season will be enough for me"
"Overall a solid and very well made offering, but I'm not digging the flavor combinations here."
"O: tough to review not really a ""winter warmer"" Have not had it for the last two years but seem to remember a much more pronounced spruce flavor. remember a friend who could not stand the beer said it was like ""gnawing on a tree branch"". That was the appeal to myself guess I was in the minority. still its a very easy drinking tasty beer."
"Overall I guess this one is pretty good, just not great. This used to be one of my favorite winter seasonals, however the spruce seems less strong then it was in the past, which kills it for me."
"Still I keep buying cases of this stuff so I must like it."
"D - A highly drinkable beer, but I wish the flavors were more pronounced. Definitely worth a try, though."
"Amber in color with a white head that dissipated fairly quickly with no lacing. Aroma is mainly caramel malts and evergreen. I didn't expect the spruce to come through in aroma, but it does. Flavor is mainly caramel malts, very subtle spruce, and a nice sweetness. Virtually no bitterness. The light to medium body, nice effervescence, and a buttery sensation combine to produce a nice overall mouth feel. The taste of alcohol is slight and the drink provides a very nice warming feeling. A bit of sweetness lingers in the finish and leaves a nice aftertase."
"A good winter beer, but nothing I’d ever go crazy over."
"Overall: Although it is not your typical winter variety, this beer was crisp, refreshing, and very drinkable. I was initially worried the spruce may be overpowering, but was pleasantly surprised when there was just enough to let me know it was in there."
"My overall feeling is meh from Alaskan Winter. I like that they put a spin on the classic winter seasonal but I think it is another reason why so few people live in Alaska through all four seasons."
"One of my favorite Winter Brews, year after year. It's very consistent and offers many unique flavors not found in another brew I've had"
"This does not feel like a winter warmer at all, more like a sessionable amber ale, but no complaints there. Tolerable and easily drinkable, so I say good on that!"
"I had the Alaskan s Winter beer at Carlies Jewels in redlands california- on tap - strong reddish brown in color medium head with little lacing strong malt and spruce flavors mellow hop undertones definitely an evening session beer, good with barbeque or around a fire -a true winter warmer- ill be getting a few cases next winter for sure!"
"MF is smooth and lighter bodied. Very drinkable."
"All in all, it's a very ""cozy"" winter ale, worthy of its price, and should be simple enough for simple tastes, and complex enough for beer snobs."
"Overall: a pretty good beer I would buy it again but it could be great if they balanced this more with a piny hop, but its cool to be able to try a spruce tip beer."
"Drinkability: Good enough to warrant a second (tonight anyway). The spruce tips keep things interesting, and the body and finish make for a pretty smooth ride. Not great, but worth a try."
"For the style, it's too thin and clean in character. Not a big enough for a Winter Warmer. But it's enjoyable beer in looks, flavor and on the palette, so credit there. Quite drinkable."
"Great session beer. It is not in my opinion a winter warmer but I do like it."
"This is a great winter beer, very drinkable and tasty. The appearance is dark, not pitch black but dark. Smells very matly, tiny bit spicy or tangy. The taste is very smooth, very matly as well, you can taste an interesting flavor which Im assuming is the spruce tips. I went through a six pack of these no problem. It is a very well balanced beer, nothing wrong with it at all. I will get this one again."
"MF: Medium bodied without huge hop or alcohol character. A little sweet for warmer temps but I know for a fact that this is a perfectly sessionable beer when it is -40º outside and it's dark 18 hours per day."
"Overall, a malty sweet wintery ale that is pleasant and a little spiced, but not very exciting."
"This brew pours a hazy, amber color with a medium thin light beige head that diminishes steadily, but leaves rows of lacing. Aroma of pine, hops and sweet malt. Medium-bodied with a piney/spruce character, along with fresh fruit, hops and malt flavors. Touches of spice are present too. The finish is hoppy and malty with a fruit and spice aftertaste. Decent overall. They were looking for something different, I think they found it."
"Drinkability is kinda low because I just really didn't like the flavor, however, if you like the flavor I could see this being super drinkable."
"D - This is a very enjoyable beer it has a good taste that makes it pretty easy drinking it's worth keeping an eye out for to try sometime"
"sorry for the wasted seat rhettroactive!!"
"D: Way too sweet and to be honest, that's just about all this beer has going on."
"I like Alaskan Brewing Co. but did not enjoy this at all. Not a typical ""winter warmer"" and I was not impressed with their interpretation."
"Drinkability - Interesting brew. Would love to try this fresh from a tap in Juneau someday."
"Drink- A very sessionable beer. As stated above, need to get another and have it a bit warmer"
"Don't leave this beer in the snow. Too cold. Take it out of the fridge for a bit before you serve it. The coldness hides the spices. I'm getting a malty smell at first and not much else. I also expect more from a beer labeled ""Alaskan Winter"". Like maybe some caribou blood? It's also labeled with ""spruce tips"". Ya i get a little spicy/spruce aroma but not enough to complement this winter brew. Sorry Alaskan... Not impressed."
"Very interesting take on the winter warmer, and a nice change of pace. Definitely brings out the winter spirit with the full body and the huge flavor. A very good beer."
"Obviously I like this beer. Usually I drink IPA's and Munich style Hefeweisen."
"D-interesting, worth trying but not really my style"
"My first winter warmer and I think I was spoiled. A very nice, complex mixture of flavors balance out well and this beer lives up to its style. I can see more of this in my future."
"- Overall just a very interesting and different flavor for a winter brew... seems like a nice amber with an extra kick of some sweet sugars , candies... etc..."
"Incredibly drinkable. As I stated in my first paragraph, I'm not big on seasonal beers (certain porters and stouts not withstanding). This in my opinion is the best winter ale available. Great session beer."
"Pours a medium orange-amber color, with a decent amount of white foam on top. Nicely spicy on the nose, with spruce, toasted malt and a light, pleasant hoppiness. On the palate, this one is fairly light-bodied, medium carbonation, with pale malt, caramel and spruce, finishing with a profound sweetness. Pretty good."
"Only four bucks for a bomber was quite nice but I would not really recommend it."
"ALASKAN Winter--Ale Brewed With Spruce Tips--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 6.40% ABV. 27 IBU's (4.0 / 5.0) Foamy lacy thin white head. Clear bright thin light-amber gold color. Delicate spruce hop fruit hint front. Satisfying sweet mild Winter spice spruce sweetbread mild caramel cherry doughy hint body. Clean refreshing mild hop lingering spice spruce end. Tasty. Sampled 10/13/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $7.79 @ Fred Meyer--Ballard on 10/13/2010."
"d: a nice enough winter warmer, unique and adequately satisfying, there's some good aromas and flavors present, but as a whole the beer is a little reserved for my preference"
"A different spin on the Winter Warmer, and it's refreshing to see that the spruce is not overdone. Very tasty and very drinkable, which makes this an excellent Sunday dinner beer."
"Medium bodied. Appropriate carbonation. Very easy drinker for a winter warmer, though I feel it doesn't necessarily fit the style that well."
"Overall, a good WW that I do recommend. Rotation - not avail here in TX so shipped back from CO trip. If here, I might get a single or two or on-tap during the WW season. [O;O]"
"Overall not exactly a full on flavor blast. Not very memorable."
"Pours a hazy golden amber with a minimal amount of white head that leaves almost no lacing whatsoever behind. The smell has notes of toffee, wheat, pine needles, and a bit of subtle hoppy citrus. The taste has a general malty sweetness to it, along with a hint of hoppy bitterness, some pine sap, and some spruce needles. The body is on the lighter side of medium, has more than enough carbonation, and warms a bit as it coats, making for a fairly drinkable winter brew."
"D- I'm very glad I was able to try this beer as I have not seen it in MA. That being said, it's not something I will actively trade for, as other local winter warmers hold up to this one."
"Orange-amber colored. Minimal white lace. Caramel malt aroma with mild, citirc/pine hop undertone. Begins with soft malt; biscuit and bread flavors dominate the mid-palate, with a nice sweetness that stays clean. Hops creep in toward the finish with a muted but distinctly unusual pine note that must be the spruce tips. There are fleeting undertones of berry fruit as well. Flavors are understated and well integrated. Mouthfeel is very nice-- slick, full, but very clean. This is not at all what I expected, but its a very well done beer. It is mild, but shows a lot of finesse."
"D. Overall a good not great beer. Tastes almost like a lager and ale hybrid that grew on me as the night went on. Will probably drink again but will wait till next years batch"
"There is a little warming from the alcohol so I guess it has that aspect of ""winter warmer"" correct. But then again, it doesn't claim to be a warmer--that's what yall have it categorized as. This is clearly a...well...I dunno what this beer should be categorized as. It's not dark or hoppy like most winter warmers, but it does have some of the roasty qualities. I dunno. This beer is confused and so am I. All I know is that it tastes great, just don't try it thinking you're getting a warmer or something sprucey. Bottoms up!"
"Have not had this beer for six or seven years, but liked it better in the past. Not bad, but a tad boring. I remember this as a littler darker, more flavorful, and around 7%. Now it seems a little closer to the amber and not something I would seek out."
"Overall - A very unique twist on beer"
"D - A decent brew, but nothing to knock your socks off. Enjoyable and well crafted for sure."
"Overall, give it a shot if you want add another beer to your list, otherwise avoid."
"I love this beer. The only issue I have with it is that each year the beers taste can differ so much. I remember a year or two ago it was way to piney almost undrinkable. I still look forward to this beer every year. IMO a great beer by a great company. I would recommend to anyone and if you don enjoy the first time give it another try."
"D: This is a pretty decent Winter Warmer. I liked the spruce theme, but would have appreciated a little bit more flavor overall."
"Since it is closest brewery to me that bottles beer, I want to like this and other Alaskan Brewing offerings more than I do, but I don't. With the exception of the barleywine and seasonal porters and some other limited releases, their beers tend to be pretty uninspired and average."
"D - Great winter warmer beer. I would go back to this."
"Appearance is a slightly darker copper with a light murk to it and having not much of a head. Smell has a light sweet caramel and dark fruits. Taste has a bitter sweetness with a good amount of malt and light hop. Mouthfeel is medium with good body and carbonation. For what I get for the price, its not bad."
"Mouthfeel is medium light with more carbonation than I would like. The mouthfeel is a little thin."
"Update: I'm enjoying this beer more each time I try it. I'm going to have to get some more. I'm absolutely loving the flavor of this. Very nice!"
"Overall, my favorite Alaskan Amber and one of my newest favorite beers... ever."
"D- This is a nice refreshing brew that is easily sessionable."
"D - not a bad brew, just a bit light. on the other hand it is quite sessionable."
"D-- Long story short.... Loved this beer in Tucson 2 years ago. Now?? ICK. Really sweet and it is a problem. I do remember getting the spruce needles smell from the 07 version. This is sugar and carmel. not a lot of roasted malts. A really good brewery but this version is just plain bad. So glad I just got a single bottle."
"glassware: pint"
"Drinkability: This isn't a warmer unless you count the ABV."
"Overall impressions: A bit sweeter than I'd like - its not bad, but certainly not something I'd seek out."
"D - Good, I could have a couple."
"Clear amber-tinged orange with a modest, wet, thin head. Mediocre retention and barely any lacing. Very English aroma with lots of toffee and cookie maltiness and a Christmasy spiciness. I don't get any spruce though. The flavor has a sweet, graham crackery, toffee maltiness that's quickly tempered by earthy hops and, at last, a distinct but light spruce character. Nice balance here in a style that tends to be rather sweet. Finish is pleasantly dry. Nice mouthfeel and uncommon drinkability."
"Over all this is a good beer. The drink ability is good, but nothing spectacular. One of the lighter winter warmers I've had, almost seems more like a mix of a oktoberfest and winter ale, maybe Novemberfest? Would order again, price is nice also"
"That being said, a bunch of my customers just loved this beer, it was one of my best selling Winter seasonals. So what do I know?"
"I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised to find this brew actually being very drinkable. Aroma is spice and malty sweetness. Flavor is quite nice, malts dominating and some spruce coming through in the finish. Carbonation hits nice on the way down which is refreshing. Good beer overall, enjoyable."
"I could drink this beer often if it was offered in my local area. That being said, I think that this is a keeper and one worthy of seeking out if you like the Winter Warmer style."
"Sample in the Alaskan tap room. This brew pours a hazy, ruddy amber color with a medium thin light beige head that diminishes steadily. Stringy lacing. Aroma of pine, hops and fruit. Medium-bodied with a piney/spruce (prevents scurvy!) character, along with fresh fruit, hops and malt flavors. Touches of spice are present too. The finish is hoppy and malty with a fruit and spice aftertaste. Decent overall."
"D: Picked up a six-pack right as the season was ending. I think this is probably my new favorite winter warmer."
"Thanks to Colts9016 for this one. 12oz bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a slightly hazy gold with a thin white head. Caramel malt in the aroma. Fairly rich malty flavor. Some slight fruitiness. More caramel malt flavor. There is some hop bitterness in the finish to add some balance. I didn't really get the spruce flavor. Decent winter warmer base."
"Pours a slightly fogged, dull hued brownish amber. Minimal head off a soft pour. Nose is a slight syrupy thing with sweet leafy tones. Mild spices. Flavor is fairly robust on the spices with a sweet tone that carries fruit edges. Seems like cherries, but a subdued one. I guess I can see spruce tips in there. I'm a little rusty on my spruce tips memories. Feel has a bit of an attacking carbonation and the liquid is a bit thick and syrupy. Overall a pretty hearty brew that's worthy of being called a winter ale. I'd prefer to drink this by a fire."
"Easy to drink thats for sure and pretty smooth going down. Nothing offensive or over the top with this beer. The spruce tips might add something but I'm not catching it."
"Didn't really seem to be much spruciness but still pretty good."
"huge thanks to my wife for getting this brew for me as part of my goal to sample a beer from every state. I often find myself at odds when it comes to winter warmers as a style. Depending on when you drink them, the spices / flavors are different. Part of the charm / challenge. I have to say for this brew, I enjoyed a nice lightly balanced caramel grainy brew with a pleasant accent of spices and a woody note which I'll attribute to spruce but profess to not having sampled any other spruce type product over the past year(s) for which to compare this to. I could see getting a 6 pack each December and enjoying as part of the holiday season."
"12 ouncer, w/o freshness/vintage/bottling date info. Pours typical amber, clear under a large, retentive and loose, initially fluffy dark tan head and leaving all kinds of thick lacing. Mild sweet maple infused nose. I'm not getting much spice or the advertized spruce here. Just a malty ale, lacking in much complexity or intrigue. I'm getting more maple, toastyness and thats about it. One and done for me of this one."
"Overall: There is a creamy mouth feel that is slightly astringent. There is a slightly bitter finish and lingers on the palate. I felt that beer was more an amber ale with a little more hops. I was hoping for a warming feeling from the beer, but I didn't get any. It has a good malty backbone but it is not very heavy and hoppy. It is a really good beer but not great."
"Overall - Good winter seasonal. I am not usually crazy about this style, but this one is OK."
"Overall, it's a pleasant beer. I enjoyed drinking it, but was content with just one bottle."
"D - This is a good session brew that might pair well with fruitcake (I don't care what anyone says, I loves me some fruitcake). Lightly spiced, mellow on the hops (they are there for sure, but not the star of the show), and focused on a fruity Christmas cheer flavor combined with tingly menthol-like spruce. Worth a try for the spruce uniqueness aspect, and worth going back to for that minty-fresh, almost hoppy quality of the spruce."
"It was a little on the sweet side with just a hint of hops. Medium bodied and drinkable. It was good but not a home run with me. I wasn't wild about the spruce tips."
"Overall a very solid beer that I would not have minded throwing down another one of in heartbeat."
"Thanks goes to flexabull for providing this as a Secret Santa gift."
"D - This is interesting and easy drinking. The spruce is a unique touch but I don't know if it's my favorite yet."
"I keep getting disappointed by Alaskan's beers. They seem to feel a bit out of whack. This beer tastes somewhat like spruce, but it's not an altogether pleasant taste and I don't really get why it's there. The beer isn't rich or balanced enough to take on the spruce flavor. Alaskan calls it an English old ale, which sets it up for some unfortunate comparisons as there are some very big and excellent old ales out there. That's a refined category of subtle, hand-crafted ales. This beer is none of those things. Oh, it's not a bad beer. It just borders on mediocrity. There's some sweet malt and some mild hops with a touch of spice. Nothing really comes together, though. The taste is not balanced to begin with, and the spruce just further knocks things off course. The individual flavors are all pretty good. They just don't really work together for my palate. This beer is trying too hard at being a winter seasonal and needs to work on just being good beer."
"Nice deep gold pour and aroma of malts and trees. The flavor is good, but the spruce tips are kind of strange. Deep and malty, with some caramel, but then a blast of turpentine. I wish they would have just thrown in more hops instead, the spruce was not a good substitute."
"12oz bottle courtesy of Unclejedi, thanks! nice golden color with teh strangest aroma of what I take must be spruce. Its like pine mixed with licorice, huh? The flavor is also strange but surprisingly good. The flavor is very hard to describe as I have not tasted anything like it but weak licorice comes to mind and a hint of malt. This was interesting and very easy to drink."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Sweet caramel malts with a faint herbal quality. Very clean and malty, only faintly bitter in the finish. I'm not getting much spruce in the flavor, or much complexity at all for that matter. I'm not really sure where the brewer was going with this. It's pleasantly malty but fairly flatline, lacking in any sort of variation from start to finish."
"Notes from 11/30/04"
"Drinkability - I like this beer, I do. Unfortunately, it gives me a headache every time I have one (I'm guessing some kind of reaction to the spruce tips.) I'm not going to mark it lower for this fact, but give out the warning that it may cause a similar reaction in others."
"This ale is far too light, too sweet, and too tame to be a proper winter warmer. While still an ok, drinkable ale, the spruce is underutilized and the ale borders on macro in it's timidness."
"I really enjoyed this. The spruce could have been easily overused to create a somewhat gimmicky brew, but it gives this one a clear, fresh taste. Liked the restraint here. It's a bit sweet and malty, and the spruce and the hops give it a piney finish. The alcohol is present both in the taste and aroma and warmed me up a bit. Really liked the balance and restraint with all the good flavors to put together an enjoyable brew."
"Not your regular winter warmer. This one definitely has some spruce kick. And it's sweet and malty - no question. Not ""hints of sweetness and spruce"" but in your face sweet malt and spruce. If you're in the mood for a sweet, malty, and piney brew, this is perfect. Definitely worth a shot in the exploration of winter brews."
"Pours a very light brown tan color body, average head, and good sized bubbles. Aroma of spices, alcohol, sweetness. Taste of spruce, maybe sap? Bitter, acidic, sickly sweet taste. Slightly fizzy. A little too much sappy, sprucy taste for my palate."
"Overall, it's too sweet for me, with some off-notes. I'd prefer more spicing."
"Poured into a pint glass, this golden amber coloration beer gives a full foam and reduces to a lingering lacing . There is a good malt aroma that odorizes the air. Taste is a good balance of hops and malts with a distinct taste that warms your interior. Has a outdoors sort of taste."
"Overall, this is a great brew by Alaskan Brewing. I would definitely get this again!"
"Pours a clear orange to copper color with a thin white head. Smell is mostly malty with some spiced character in the way of the spruce tips, I'm guessing. Taste is malty and refreshingly minty almost and cool feeling in the mouth. Unique mouthfeel and flavor but not particularly fantastic either. Medium to thin bodied and somewhat easy drinking."
"Drinkability - decent session potential. Glad to have the chance but I'll save the other bottle for someone else who'd like to try it..."
"The medium to medium/light bodied beer is enjoyable and interesting, although it would not be unpleasant to drink more than one at a session, it wouldn't be something I would do."
"Pours clear and very bright, a highlight-flecked medium amber with a small head that leaves only a collar. The nose displays some buttery diacetyl and a vague hint of... something... that reminds of refreshment but is too vague and subdued to present itself as an identifiable aroma. On the palate, rich buttery malts and a twang of slight fruitiness toward the end, with some metallic notes cropping up as well. Whatever spruce characteristic there is is very subtle; too subtle, in fact, for me to detect. Mouthfeel is fairly nondescript, but by no means bad: malty but not slick, little acidity, medium carbonation that is unassuming. Overall, this is a perfectly drinkable beer but nothing to write home about."
"Overall impression: A malty, lightly spiced winter ale. Nothing over the top in terms of spices. A very clean, good winter ale. Recommended."
"I really dig the spruce flavours and they combine well with the sweet malts to provide a nicely balanced winter warmer that reminds me of a nice Christmas treat. I could definitely take down another of these!"
"Drinks too easy, hard to put my finger on some of the flavor here, but I think I could happily session on this! The spruce tips are a nice addition"
"taste is nice. sweet with a gingerbreaddy, nutty flavor and malty too. a bit thick but not cloyingly so. smooth and drinkable."
"Poured a nice copper color but had no head to speak of really, just kind of flat. The smell was very sweet with spices and an overriding maltiness that was a bit overpowering. Flavor-wise, the beer was pretty thick and malty sweet with just a hint of the mentioned spruce tips and just a bit of hops at the very end to add a touch of bitterness. I guess I like my winter beers a bit more hoppy and not so sweet as this one. Recommended if you are a malthead."
"D-A great, unique, winter offering. Easy to consume even for the person who may think they do not like conifers in their beer...of which I am not one!"
"Pours a four finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose, no spruce. Flavor is sweet caramel that balances the slight bitterness at the finish. $1.35 for a 12oz bottle from Liquid Solutions Oregon City, Or."
"Drinkability is average. It is a smooth beer, easy to go down, but the overall taste was not that appealing to me. I'm glad I got to try the beer (THANK YOU NITROGEN) as it was an interesting brew, but I do not know if I would go back to it."
"Pours a bright amber hue with minimal head and slightly above average lacing on my glass. Tons of tiny bubbles heading to the surface in this brew. I am not really sure if I am smelling hops or the spruce needles. It's isn't quite strong enough for hops, but it's a pleasant citrus scent with some biscuty malt coming to my nose. This beer is actually quite sweet. The malty sweetness overpowers the bitterness coming from the finishing hops. Flavors of citrus and sweet caramel meld fairly well in this beer just leaning towards sweeter than balanced. The mouthfeel is medium carbination, slightly watery, and medium bodied. The alcohol is also fairly well masked in the beer and doesn't really make an appearance. This is a nice winter warmer. Easy to drink and I would purchase this again if I had the chance."
"M/D- Somewhat oily in the mouth. Not a bad tasting brew, but different, and I personally wouldn't go for more than a bottle of this."
"Drinkability: Spruce or no spruce, it's still a decent beer."
"This beer had an aroma I couldn't quit make out. At first I thought it may be blueberries,but then realized it must be the spruce tips. The head didn't last too long, not sure if it was my glass or not. Really enjoyed the taste, very refreshing, with the right amount of alcohol to give it that winter warmer effect. Great night time session beer."
"pours a transparent amber/yellow color with little head. nose is piney and reminds me of the bad elf series of ridgeway. taste is very smooth, borderline watery but the spruce tip twinge is quite unique and quite tasty. get easier to drink as you pound em, have a reasonable warming effect at 6.4% good beer, but too many can give u some gnarly heartburn."
"the look of it is much like yuengling lager, a light copper/amberish colour, thin head but still seems to be sticking to the glass just fine. fairily bland nose but still a little flowery if you breath deep. the taste is crisp begining to end the spruce flavour starts off subtle and then peaks just before the long slightily bitey finish. a very cool truely alaskan brew, worth a try if you happen upon it."
"Now I know the reason why I gain 10 lbs. every year around this time...."
"Note to self: Didn't particularly care for this beer."
"D: Could see having a n umber of these as they are bright, unique in taste and not likely to cut one off at the knees after a few."
"This is another PNW winter ale I buy every year.... but every time, I ask why... shortly answer myself and say ""because, It can be alot better."" This brew is certainly worth trying more than once, but if I bought a 6-pack, at least 3 would be sitting around until I pawned them off on friends."
"That said, for whatever reason, I have a hard time having more than one of these. It's pretty light for the style, so that's not the problem. For whatever reason, this doesn't appeal to me in the same way that many warmers do. Maybe it could use some more complexity in either the hops or malts? Anyway, it's my first ABC beer, and I'm excited to try some more of their products soon, as this is an interesting take on the style."
"Golden Brown color, light head that fades quickly. not quite as dark a I thought it would be. Smells sweet, pine, it just smells like a really nice brisk day, can't really put my finger on it but I like it alot. tastes very sweet, pine comes through at the end. the mouthfeel is sticky, yet tart enough to assert itself as a fairly drinkable brew. I don't really get the the ""winter warming"" effect from this beer though, just a little too sweet really, doubt I will return to this one."
"Drinkability: Uniquely Alaskan. Good but not designed for mass consumption. The spruce flavor gets to me after a couple."
"Overall, this beer is supposed to a winter warmer, but I'm just not feelin' it on this one. In some ways, it almost tastes like a pale ale! but more spicey. I don't know about this seasonal... I mean, it's not bad by any means--certainly not--but there's plenty of other beers I'd rather be drinking when I'm feeling brisk and when the holidays come around."
"I might have to make a trek up to Wyoming for more of this..."
"Alaskan is a good brewery. This beer does not conjure up images of yuletide cheer. I enjoy alaskan brewery, they should replace the smoked porter for their winter warmer. This is an ok beer to drink, just dont think festive holiday."
"I've enjoyed other selections from Alaskan, and while this certainly has the ""[Winter] Warmer"" part down, I can't get into it. Though Winter Warmers aren't my favorite style of beer, this one goes a bit beyond that... Excessively sweet.. and a bit odd. Not one for me to repeat."
"I could drink one or two of these in a sitting and then i think i would have enough of the tree flavor for awhile. not a great session beer for me, but I will certainly keep them around all winter for an evening beverage on occasion. good one to serve guests as well."
"This beer poured a nice copper color but had no head to speak of really, just kind of flat. The smell was very sweet with spices and an overriding maltiness that was a bit overpowering. Flavor-wise, the beer was pretty thick and malty sweet with just a hint of the mentioned spruce tips and just a bit of hops at the very end to add a touch of bitterness. I guess I like my winter beers a bit more hoppy and not so sweet as this one. Recommended if you are a malthead."
"D- I love Alaskan amber and tried this fro the first time last year (took me till this year to review). It is very drinkable especially on a cool night. I looked forward to this coming out so I will have to get my fill before it disappears until next year. Good thing that this is just the start of the season for this beer"
"12 oz bottle from Vons. Winter 2007 release. Poured a rich copper color with an off white head that faded to 1/8 inch. Aroma was light with sweet malts, red fruits and almonds. The flavor was rich with malts and a large dosing of cherries and raspberries. Mouthfeel was very full, creamy and heavy. This is a beer you can almost chew. The finish fell short and showed just a trace of piney hops and some alcohol, but thankfully their was no lingering sweetness (which I had anticipated by this point). Overall: this is a most pleasantly original brew--my congrats to Alaskan. Recommended."
"Honestly, one of the first winter warmers marketed as such that I've really liked. A little stronger, but without the usual bombs of hopping and burnt malts. Goes down easy and actually does warm you up a little. Nothing to get excited about, though, as a proper old-world beer would suffice and do so with more flavour."
"This is a relatively rich and slightly warming (from alcohol) beer. Understandable to be offered during the winter."
"Could not drink much of these because they are so thick and sweet"
"D: An immensely complex yet drinkable ale, even in the summer, the spruce adds a pagan air to this beer, one of my favourite Winter Warmers. A great beer."
"Drinkability: Perhaps the recipe has been tweaked but I like this now (2010) much better than when I originally tried it in 2007"
"This is just an incredibly well made brew, any way you look at it."
"DA: I don't know...this one was interesting for the ""spruce tips"" ellement, but overall nothing fancy. If this was all I had on a very stormy night I wouldn't complain too much."
"D: I'm just mad that this is a winter release. I could drink this during all four seasons. I can't believe that the ABV is that high, because I felt this was a very light tasting brew. Maybe I should give the stouts a rest and seek out a few more like this. The Alaskan Brewing Co. has done it again. Very well done."
"it's easily one of the most unique and drinkable winter brews i've had this year, or any year... seriously... try this out... drink a tree!"
"Drinkability- an over-all good tasting brew and very easy to drink a few."
"I've heard good things of Alaskan Brewing, and this is the first beer I've sampled from their brewery. Unfourtunately, it didn't make as good of a first impression as I was expecting. I was bumed about this brew, but it shouldn't stop me from trying thier other products."
"D - Undoubtedly a session."
"Taste a touch of smoke first then darkened walnuts, burnt sugar. A medium body, and drying mouthfeel. An alcohol bite leads into the drier mouthfeel. There's nice fresh apple ester. This is surprisingly dry considering the richness of the malt; the dryness is in contrast to the caramel. There's woody quality to this: I feel like I'm sitting in front of a fireplace. I also feel like pouring a scotch, interesting. This is fantastic. The sour hops/spruce are a nice accent. Super drinkable."
"This one's a bit flat, perhaps the sample rather than the intended outcome, or I would rank it even higher. But even though I'm generally not a fan of Christmas beers, I'll be coming back to this one every year."
"Poured in a pint glass, the Alaskan Winter Ale is a bright, clear copper with a large, light tan head that quickly subsided to a very slight collar, and left minimal lace. The aroma is bright, maybe too sweet, piney, fruity and a noticeable amount of alcohol. As mentioned on the bottle, that dominant aroma is spruce tips. The taste is a bit cloying but nice, more of a fruity bubblegum with a firm malt backbone and bitter hop finish, then the dominate spruce in the aroma - but make no mistake, it is certainly there...I just think it is really nicely balanced, much more then the aroma would leave you to believe. My taste runs towards sweeter, extreme tasting to beers, so consider that when I say that I really enjoyed the taste of this one. Only complaint would be the the aftertaste looses the balance and can be a bit sprucy, but it creeps on you slowly. The mouthfeel was perfect, and it was one the most drinkable winter ales I've, at least from this country. I never had more then 2 of these in one sitting, but I'd guess they'd session quite nicely."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not very filling considering the style, this is good to stick with for an evening that might not necessarily be too cold. This one is perfect when you crave the style but dont want a beer thats too heavy."
"D: I liked this quite a bit. Easy to drink, moderate ABV, interesting flavors. I could see making this a regular addition to the drinking lineup in the winter. Recommended."
"Pours a nice clear amber color, nice carbonation, small fizzy tan head, which leaves some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is of sweet malts, hops, spices, spruce, and caramel. The taste is sweet, highly carbonated, malty, tastes like cherries, but could be the spruce. Light-Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice little winter warmer from Alaskan. Could easily enjoy a few of these."
"12oz. bottle poured a light amber color with some slow bubbles, very little head and not much lacing. Not much of an aroma in this with faint scents of alcohol, hops, and a bit of spice. Taste is not very pleasing to me. I taste a blend of pine with some sweet, sour, spice, and bitter notes with nothing that stands out on its own. Mouth feel is about the only thing I like in this beer. I would probably try this brew one more time in the future just to make sure it doesn't taste as bad as this one."
"Pours a pretty copper color topped by a small creamy white head that quickly recedes to a thin ring. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, light spruce and floral hops, and a hint of bubble gum esters. Palate is a blend of caramel and dark malts up front, imparting a good deal of sweetness. The spruce comes through after a few sips, along with more bubble gum. A bit of warming alcohol lingers on the finish. Body is substantial and creamy. A nice winter ale that differentiates itself from the crowd. Still, it's not one of my favorites this year."
"Drinkability: It's a good winter warmer, but the tea-like flavor gets to be a bit much for me to want to drink this regularly."
"A good winter beer that's a pleasure to drink on a cold day. Probably one of the best warmers that I've had."
"D: This is the best winter warmer that I've come across, reminding me of a fresh Finnish sahti."
"Edit: By the time I got to the bottom of the second bottle, this beer did start to grow on me. I'm raising the taste score from 2 to 3. I still don't think this is a very drinkable beer, but if you stick with it, it's not bad."
"Notes: What a night. I'm 2 for 2 tonight on winter warmers. This is another fine example although it is subtle in the malt department compared to most. The spices are mellow compared to most. It works though because of the hops and the earthiness it gains from the malt bill and tree trimmings. Above average."
"D: Well, this beer isn't so bad. I'm sure the carbonation was simply ""off"" in my bottle but I have to judge whats in front of me. Flavor was a little fruity but OK. Nothing besides the carbonation really turns me off. Its sweet but not so sweet that its cloying."
"The body is dry and the chalky flavor is a real deterrent in the beer. Carbonation is a little low but acceptable. The beer is smooth and easy to drink. Overall maybe this beer has seen too much winter, but I could see real improvement for this beer in the future."
"This one's okay. Interesting the way the spruce play's out in this one."
"MY PRECIOUS!!!!"
"Drinkability: I think it's still too early for winter warmers... but even so, I'll drink this is, because it hits the spot. Since joining BA, I've only had my favorite beers more than a couple times... this is on the favorite list (not because it's one of the best, but because it's my favorite at the local pizza place right now). This satisfies my malt cravings without destroying my tastebuds with hops."
"I really like Alaskan Amber, and Smoked Porter, but I can do without this one."
"Full-bodied with a decent level of carbonation. Very smooth, creamy, warm, and a little chewy as well. Definitely a good brew, without being too sweet. Highly drinkable, though a bit on the thick side."
"Epilogue: I really would recommend letting this one sit for about 10 minutes before drinking it. I should've known better, really. As it warmed up, the caramel and fruit notes really came out... I've upped my ratings because of this. Definitely a worthwhile brew."
"Still new to the beer scene, well the good beer scene. But this has a very interesting taste. Very nice color and smell. Good spicy almost aftertaste. Can also detect some fruity flavors hidden away. Nice warming effect due to it being cold in here, and a nice high ABV content."
"Clear copper colour in the glass. Big, bubbly head that quickly shrunk down to a thin white layer. Minimal lacing. Strong sweet aroma, fruity and malty. Sweet malt flavours to start. Fruity, caramel and spicy with a bit of pine. Dry clean finish, but slightly tangy. A slight warming affect from the higher ABV. Very enjoyable."
"Aroma is not really present to any great degree other than some vague maltiness. Pale copper in color with a well established white head that is mostly lasting. Has a sort of candy, sugar powder, bubble gum sweetness in the fore. Not getting any spice just that very sugary sweetness and malt which makes it not so Winter Warmer-y."
"I bought a sixer of this and am enjoying the last one now...would have no problem buying or enjoying it again in the future. Cheers!"
"Pine and honey are strong in the smell. The taste is unique and herbal, much like a gruit. The mouthfeel is somewhat light and fairly sharp, while drinkability is good."
"This poured with a big, thick, off-white/tan head. It had good clarity in a deep-amber colored beer. The nose was highly malty and sweet. The mouthfell was slightly thick with a sugary finish. I got a lot of berry-like sweetness in the mouth, much like raspberries. This was an interesting beer and one that I would have no problem opening again."
"Last swigs: Reminds me of Clipper City Below Decks barelywine. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the bottle."
"Nice on the tongue and very drinkable. Mostly a sipping beer due to the 6.4% ABV."
"Pours light golden in color. The aroma is equally light-- I had to shove my sniffer deep into the glass to perceive the soft semi-sweet aroma. The flavor begins piney, followed by semi-sweet malt, and then a bitterness finishes things off. The mouthfeel and overall drinkability is easy-- but not terribly exciting."
"Clear copper with just a little bit of head. Nice aroma with spruce, some oak, vanilla, and a touch of sweetness. The spruce is also prevalent in the taste with hints of fruit and spiciness rounding out the flavor. The taste seems to be a little stronger than when I had this on tap. I thought that this could have been a little more full bodied, but the carbonation was nice. A nice winter session beer."
"This is a drinkable beer, but I wouldnt want to have more than a couple in a sitting. Its a little sweeter than I like. If you like a fruity beer, or a lambic, this one might be for you."
"Overall, a great classic winter warmer. So far, my favorite Alaskan Brew. Definitely try this one."
"Barely any head after the pour, color is deep copper, it just looks a bit flat. Smell is faint, fruity apple, mildly alcoholic. The taste is tangy sweet at first, with hints of apple, raspberry, and spices. The finish has bit of a honey-like flavor and then it dissipates into nothing. Not bitter. Alcohol doesn't appear that strongly. Some interesting fruitiness in the flavor but it doesn't come together to be that enticing. The mouthfeel is a bit thin although the carbonation seems adequate on the palate. Unique taste, but it still doesn't make for a very drinkable beer..."
"Overall, I didn't like this one. It makes my face pucker and makes me feel sick to my stomach. I bought a six pack of these and could only manage to drink three (on subsequent evenings). Trying to drink two in a row just would not fly."
"Still one of the best."
"The beer after its extraction from the stubby 12-ounce brown bottle set in the glass a cloudless brown with a personable off-white head that is semi-creamy in texture, as it dissolves the residual lace a velum like sheet upon the glass. Nose s sweet with caramel, a hint of hops and a nice malt earthiness I find appealing, start is somewhat sweet with a splendid grain presence; the top is light to moderate in feel. Finish is moderately acidic; the hops spicy and pleasing to the palate very dry lingering aftertaste, sure glad that Alaskan beers are readily available here now, and quite a drinkable beer for a quiet Sunday afternoon."
"Overall a very enjoyable experience which would have been much, much better if there'd been a lot more carbonation. If there'd been a 'sparkle' to each sip it would have highlighted the fruit character more without becoming overly sweet (and the acid from the CO2 would have tarted up the flavors a bit) Despite these flaws I'd still rate it high on drinkability; I'm looking forward to my next bottle and I'd be inclined to recommend this to friends."
"Pours a nice shiny amber, clear enough to almost expect to find a mosquito from the Jurassic period in my pint glass. Smells of caramel, with a hint of hop/spruce tip spiciness. The taste starts out with a nice bitter kick, most likely a tongue tingling combo of lightly fruity hops and the spruce tips this beer claims to be brewed with. Mellows out into nutty caramel malts with a lingering bitterness. Probably the first of the Winter warmer style that I've had where the thought popped into my head that it could easily be a year-round beer, even though I wouldn't drink it that much. Overall, a good beer, but a batch with a heartier malt profile would be more intersting."
"The beer poured a nice paler amber color with some medium, visible carbonation and a white head with little to no retention. The nose had the expected spruce characte along with a caramel character and faint fruitiness to it. The beer is a medium bodied brew with a smooth taste while in the mouth. The finish and after taste are of much greater note. A dry, spruce induced finished lingers on the palate for quite a time after taking a sip. This is a unique brew, not one that I could or would particularly drink many in one sitting. As a winter warmer there are better examples, but in a style where there is so much deviation and lack of one unifying theme, I choose others like Deschutes' Jubelale simply on personal preference."
"Poures a burnt orange color with a slightly off white head that is gone pretty quickly leaving no lace behind as it settles,very muted aromas I picked up some toasted cracker malt but no hopping or spruce tip aromas wich I expected maybe a touch of caramel as well but very light.Flavors are not as muted but dont really stand out much either a dry malt base with some buttery notes wich become stronger as I drink more only a touch of the pine flavors hit in the finish.I realley prefer Siletz spruce ale compared to this,Its not horrible but somewhat run of the mill."
"Poured from bottle a light amber color with lots of carbonation and a nice off white head. Smell is a little bit funky, a metallic like scent. Taste is slightly malty with a nutty flavor at first, with a slight bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, i would say low to medium bodied, goes down very easy. Overall, this is an interesting beer, never had one with spruce tips in it before I don't believe. Another strong offering by Alaskan."
"I've had a couple of bottles of this so far. One I enjoyed, the other not so much. The first one went down very agreeably with a lamb chop (shoulder, in a Kolsch deglaze reduction, yum) and I found the maltiness and slight aromatic qualities to be an excellent pairing with the lamb. I found a slight impression of raspberry along with a lingering pineyness in the aftertaste. I'm not entirely certain what was different (besides the lack of a lab chop) with the next bottle, but it became cloying and vaguely obnoxious. I'm willing to try it again (better be--I got a sixer)."
"Pine tar is great for a baseball bat but makes beer taste horrible. I bought a six pack for a social event and drank one of these with the impression of ""Yes, indeed, they put a spruce tree in that beer alright."" I tried to sucker in a few of the other guests but ended up leaving the five orphans to fend for themselves. For all I know, they're still in need of a drinker..."
"Brew pours an amber color with a medium white head that is retaining well. Nose is of malts with the spruce tips ever so faintly present - nice unique touch. Taste is a blast of malts, with a strong nutty presence. As the beer warms there is a presence of a taste that is perhaps raspberries. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style but is nicely carbonated. Overall drinkability is good, the ABV is right in line with most other winter warmers and more than one can be enjoyed in a sitting."
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep amber color ale with a nice white bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of sweet malt with a subtle mix of spices. Taste is a mix between sweet malt and a subtle mix of spices. Body is a bit thin and I cant say that I really tasted the spruce tips. I believe I would have appreciated this better with a stronger presence of spices."
"This is a perfectly drinkable beer. But there are much more distinctive winter beers to have that are available right now. I won't turn this down, but there's lots of winter seasonals to look for before this one."
"PS: I also had this on tap yesterday and my overall impression of *it* was that it was slightly more ""intense"" on all counts and would score a slightly higher score. ;^)"
"Drinkability: A pleasant enough beer, marks improve considerably if you drink this closer to room temp than ice cold."
"The mouthfeel is kinda chewy and buttery. Not bad, but I've had better Winter Brews."
"Very brassy with a small off-white head. Smells like a house at Christmas time: you can tell there is a tree in the other room and that someone has been backing, perhaps even some mulled wine on the stove. Some initial malt flavors followed by big hop character, piney and citrus rind. Spurs tips not as overpowering as one might expect, add subtle tones that are very nice. A bit too carbonated fees a little fuzzy and harsh. Yet biter-sweet lingering flavors call for the next sip."
"This is quite the alluring beer -- pours an attractive coppery/brass color, with a small head and tight carbonation. Tastes like many other winter warmers -- however, the bottle says it is brewed with spruce tips, and I this characteristic comes through, I think, not as woodsy or piney as I would have expected, but almost like a reaspberry fruitiness. In fact, this reminds me alot of the flavor of Berkshire Brewing's Raspberry Strong Ale - though not quite as malty, sweet, and raspberry filled. It has a good crisp snappy hop finish that keeps it dry enough to avoid a cloying flavor. A winter warmer that I would certainly enjoy a few pints of in the winter if it were available near me."
"The beer poured amber colored with an offwhite, one finger head with light retention and light lacing. The smell was yeasty and grainy and not a whole lot else. The taste was somewhat nutty and focused on the malts, but was overly grainy like cheap adjuncts had been used. There were hints of light citrus. The average-length finish ended with a slightly sour taste. The mouthfeel was carbonated and medium-bodied and somewhat watery. I cannot recommend this beer after this tasting."
"Tastes great. Mildly sweet. Like a spicy candy with a delicate touch of malts and some nice winter hops. Spruced up with cinnamon. So brisk and relaxing. Definitely something to look forward to every Winter."
"By far, the best winter I have experienced and I would really enjoy this one during the winter months...trade anyone?"
"Very drinkable, very agreeable beer for the style indeed."
"Overall a very nice beer. Just what I would expect from Alaskan."
"Alaskan's Winter Ale pours a slightly hazy copper body with amber and gold highlights beneath a short head of creamy ivory foam that unfortunately fades rather shortly and leaves little lacing. The nose offers gentle wafts of sweetish, biscuity, caramel-laced malt; and in the mouth it's delicately crisp and then smooth. The flavor delivers the same maltiness found in the nose, balanced by a mild brush of drying spruce that appears across the middle and lingers mildly in the finish. It's bitterness is restrained, and the spicing is far from overdone. Well worth trying!"
"A clean bright coppery amber beer. Has a small biege head. The aroma is a light malt with a hint of a fruity sweetness in the background. The flavor starts out with a quick spiciness that moves right into a malt sweetness. the finish has some interesting toffee and licorice notes to hug your tongue at the end."
"Alaskan Winter Ale is an interesting winter warmer and is not at all what I expected. It's pretty good though and, in the end, I like it a little more than my final score would indicate. I just might give it another go next winter."
"Bright orangey color with no head at all and no lace as well. Aroma is malty with hints of spruce. Very sweet malty fruity taste. I liked that it wasn't spicy like a lot of winter ales. Pretty drinkable as well. Don't feel that a winter beer has to knock you on your rear. Probably a bit to pedestrian for some but a drinkable beer. Appearance is the only negative for me."
"Recommended"
"Beautiful, coppery-gold in hue with strong tawny-bronze influences; I love the color depth. Sadly there wasnt much animation. The lack of head was even sadder, at the apex the foam was a sliver of a finger and then it faded rapidly to a very scrawny collar. There was no subsequent lacing either. What a waste of such lovely liquid. All things head related on this beer were sub-par. The nose doesnt say much. My first whiff said bananas. What? I couldnt find that aroma again, but dammit that is what I smelled. I found lots of nondescript fruitiness. Sweet notes, from the malt, but there isnt any articulation. The label says, Brewed with spruce tips. How big were these alleged tips? I cant smell them. I got hints of alcohol. Not much from the hops, some slight floral earthiness (I mean slight). The nose is disappointing. Yawn. The palate doesnt say Winter Seasonal. The palate seems style-less. I guess this is a ubiquitous Winter Warmer. It is sweet but not rich in taste. At first there are hints of apple cider. Is this beer spiced? Is it just hops I taste? I get some weak spicy notes; I cant really place them (ginger?). The malt is odd too, lightly toasty. Some alcohol heat is noticeable. Light woody notes at the back. The palate is close to being good; maybe it is good right now and it is close to being great. Honestly, the taste profile is okay; it doesnt wow me at all. If I saw a six-pack in a store Id skip it. It is better than average but its nothing noteworthy. There is nothing big about it; there is no malty goodness, no hoppiness, and no array of spices nothing special here. Medium in body with low carbonation, the mouthfeel is tolerable, there is a tacky aftertaste that I dont like. That makes me think there should be more effervesces. Easy to drink but pointless to do so, I am very underwhelmed with this beer. It is forgettable. I purchased a 12-ounce bottle on-line from Liquid Solutions."
"Other comments: An absolutely scrumptious winter seasonal. The spruce is very subtle, not overpowering. Strangely, you can really taste/smell it if you clear your throat after swallowing a gulp of it... sort of a bouquet of spruce."
"Not too bad at all. Not my favorite winter warmer but not a bad choice either."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good also. It has a nice malty scent with a fruity yeast finish. I can't smell the spruce tips that are supposed to be in here. The taste is awesome. It has a very refreshing crystal malt flavor with a kick ass (spruce?) aftertaste. It goes down really smooth. This is a very unusual beer. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied with good carbonation. This is a damn good beer. It has awesome flavor; a good drinker."
"Overall, a nice, soft-spoken winter beer. Subdued caramel sweetness, low bitterness, and a hint of spruce, all in excellent balance. The subtlety of the flavor and the medium body belie the moderately high alcohol, making this an enjoyable and quite drinkable winter warmer. Worth picking up."
"bads: no head to speak of, aroma could be stronger, aftertaste doesn't stand up to the rest of the beer"
"Drinkability- Very different taste, as I am finding out from trying different winter warmers...no two taste the same. They all have their different tastes. I haven't had a real bad on yet, but haven't had one that I absolutely love yet either. Worth a try each winter."
"Overall a beer that I definitely look forward to every year until they stop crafting it or the taste no longer impresses my taste buds."
"A question: should an ""Alaskan"" winter ale really be considered a ""seasonal"". Isn't it always winter there???"
"Beer pours an orange color into my pint glass with a white head that lasts throughout the glass. Large carbonation bubbles noticed. Smell is of fruitty yeasty esters, carmally sweetness and then a citrusy piney aroma is either from the hops or spruce. Taste is malty sweet medium thick bodied balanced with hops. There is a citrusy taste here from the spruce boughs but it isn't overpowering. Beer is drinkable but I wouldn't have too many of these because that spruce might be a little to acidic over the course of a night."
"I love the unique malt flavor of this beer, kicked up the spruce tips or whatever -- spicy and full and bright. Festive."
"The taste has a definite slight bitterness and astringency that does not seem to be derived from the use of hops (so it must be the spruce). The beer is sweet and malty up front with a light refreshing citrus character. This is quite light and refreshing to the palate, though there is some solid flavor here, including some spiciness."
"This is a very good winter ale by alaskan brewing. Pours a dark copper/orange with a slight tan but more white froth head. Lacing is decent but not great. Smell is of cinnamon spice and nutmeg. Slight pine tone but very clean to the nose. The taste is very light for a winter beer, nutmeg sweetness and the hop bitterness is perfectly blended. Citrus and honey aftertones, very light in the mouth for a winter ale. Because of the lightness of this winter ale you can drink quite a few of these, dangerous because the alcohol is 6.4%. Excellent winter brew/ I'd even save some for summer as well."
"It pours a clear amber with a thin, off-white head. The aroma is malty, piney, and slightly medicinal with some citrus. The medium body has some creamy malt that is sweet and coating. It is a little fruity with some pine/spruce notes. The carbonation is a little high as well."
"A clear, copper beer, with a weak off-white head. Light caramel malt in the aroma with a hint of spice. The spices come through a bit better in the flavor, though I'm not sure I detect ""spruce tips."" Sweet biscuity, caramel malt, a light fruitiness, and a moderately bitter finish. Though something in the finish just strikes me as a bit harsh and unpleasant. Fairly crisp feeling, helped by a decent carbonation. Better cold."
"This beer relies on the subtle interplay with the spruce esters coupled with a medium body. It took a few sips to see how nice this beer works as a winter beer. It was fresh tasting yet suggested complexity and body. Like most of their beers a sense of brewing skill is demonstrated with the execution and the originality of the style."
"I have to admit that from the bottle it isn't as good as what I had on tap at the 2003 winter ale festival, but it's definitely a close relative. it's an intriguing flavor, easy to drink yet not boring, and I look forward to its return next year."
"Lightly hazed copper hue. Thin, uniform, ivory white head yields sparse lace. The aroma is comprised of mellow, mildly buttery toffee offset by a curiously fruity, underripe fig twang. Slight sweet wood and lemon rind like hop nose. Fruity tartness continues seamlessly in flavor, and is of an odd, but agreeable tamarind like nature. Simple and stately buttery biscuit and medium caramel malt backbone. Understated hop bitterness leaves ample residual sweetness that precludes easy quaffing. Orange flesh hop flavor with a floral, non descript continental twang. Thins considerably in flavor and body mid palate, leaving a vacuous, airy, diluted molasses presence. Comes full circle late, with a resurgence of figgish tartness offset by a golden raisin like sweetness. Aftertaste of buttered, warm white cracker and marmalade. An eccentric and enjoyable brew. Malt and ester character seemed to compete with each other, but I liked that. With a fuller body this could be outstanding. Maybe."
"Edit 2004 _ It seems to have a bit more of a piney taste this year.(for the better) This is an impressive Winter-style brew!"
"Appearance: Crystal clear copper amber tone with a whimpy somewhat thin head leaves nice speckled lacing spread evenly. Aroma: Spruce tips and hop dosage are evident with a sweet caramel malt backbone this is one nice seasonal scent. Taste: Surpasses the aroma ties it altogether candi-like sweetness with the blend of finishing hops and spruce tips harmonizing together excellent beer for the holiday season. Mouthfeel: Medium body slightly sticky texture to it nice full carbonation excellent. Drinkability: Excellent I am craving more and more of this flavor it just works so well I can't help myself this is an excellent winter seasonal bravo to the ol' Alaskan Brewing Co."
"Overall, a decent beer, but not one I'd look to have again anytime soon."
"Comments  I hate to be the low-ball here, but I thought this was an inferior effort at the style. If you want to make a malty pale ale, just call it a malty pale ale."
"Source: Liquid Solutions"
"An amber ale with small head and some lacing. Aroma of caramel malts, apple pie, and minty evergreen (from spruce tips). The malts are big, rich, satisfying and incredibly sweet without being too cloying. I am wary of spiced winter brews and unusual ingredients such as spruce tips but the evergreen quality actually works with the beer quite well. The hops create a surprisingly dry finish. The mouth puckers at the end of each sip, but the beer is not excessively bitter like many highly hopped beers. It's more like a tartness similar to apple juice or white grape juice. A very satisfying finish to a very satisfying beer."
"Again, a solid beer to be sure, but a special beer? Not really. It's good, but I was expecting more."
"I think this is a above average winter ale. The color was a dark tan with very little head and no lace. The smell of spices, with a hint of a certain tree smell filled the nose. The taste of spices, malts and a hint of a spruce/pine graced my palate. What a pleasant taste, not over powering with a well balance of sweetness and bitterness."
"(This is my first beer review, any suggestions please drop me a line)"
"This was a nice find at the White Horse on Parsons Green in London. This was presented to me with a nice dark peach colour and a nice white head. The aromas were of different kinds of spices, yeast, and alcohol. The taste is very spicy, fruity, and a bit alcoholic. The mouthfeel is a bit thick, but not syrupy and the drinkability is pretty nice."
"Good and different winter ale,quite drinkable..good Spruce ale..not quite as good as Siletz Spruce Ale..but good none the less"
"Taste is sweet; mild malt profile, but enough of the stuff to give it a fairly round body. Delicate tastes from the tips come through and give it an almost wit like taste. Mild apple tart and pucker which compliments the maltiness well."
"It poured a decent copper/orange color but had almost no head at all. Plus whatever head it did have, by the time I got halfway done with the beer it was completely flat. The smell was pretty good with a light hoppiness and some spicy aromas. But when I got to the taste there was very little spicinees at all. Slightly bitter with a good malty base. Everall I thought it was an Ok beer but was definately missing a couple things."
"2002 version. Pours a very nice copper color with a thick, creamy white head. Very visibly carbonated which kind of surprised me. Nose is greeted by a very pleasant sweet fruit and pine in the aroma. Flavor was of a very sweet overripe pear with a nice hop bitterness that was quite piney in nature. Nice Medium-full body. Overall a definite possibility for purchase again this year."
"2000 edition - Medium Amber color, small head. Medium bodied amber ale, medium malts and somewhat hoppy. Ale brewed with spruce tips in the mash. Nicely malty. Good flavor. Spruce not really noticeable. Nice flavor anyway. Finish is smooth and crisp. Aftertaste is crisp and clean. Nice beer."
"Good, rich, copper color with a good sized head that was lightly froathy and light tan in color. Good aroma of sweet hops, nice and fresh smell of malt as well. Taste the malt right away then sweetens a bit and covers nicely with a fresh hop finish. Sort of warmed as it went down. Good medium body and feel. I did enjoy this Winter Ale very much, but I think being there in the summer dampened the real spirit of what this brew can offer when its cold. I'm sure it would probably be even better then."
"Nice transoucent amber color. Sprucey aroma. Nice balance in the taste. I think that Alskan Brewing should make this a year round beer. Not much in the line of a Winter Ale here, but a good beer nonetheless."
"I have to say that Alaskan Winter Ale is a rather unusual creature in relation to the typical ""roasty and rich"" seasonal ales. For that, I have to give the Alaskan Brewing Co. a big thumbs up for their imaginative efforts. It's a welcomed departure."
"Notes: A solid yet serene winter seasonal, the spicing of the hops and spruce are balanced at most … this holds the beer character to a sturdy strong or old ale fashion."
"When I saw the use of spruce tips on teh label I was expecting varnish.  Gave it a shot and LOVED it.  Nice amber color with a thin head.  A nice sweet flavor which goes down extremely smoothly.  The alcohol content doesn't harsh out the brew at all.  Can't wait for next year's."
"Pours a bit syrupy.  Has very thin white head that goes away within seconds.  Don't get a lot on the aroma.  Maybe a small hint of spruce.  Appearance is slightly hazy and amber.  Taste is unique.  Spruce tips are used in this recipe and are evident on the tongue.  Pretty sweet (but not malty sweet) taste.  Alcoholic warmth is evident to a minor degree.  A good holiday brew, but not one to have many in one sitting."
"an excellent beer, but don't expect a thick rich brew...this is clean crisp malty/sweet ale with a very unique flavor due to the spruce tips (I'm guessing)  The spruce tips do not overwhelm but blend perfectly into this beer and add a touch you don't find elsewhere.  I love a good strong old ale, but this is outstanding in its own way."
"Light Golden in color, nice bitterness with a touch of spruce. A respectable seasonal beer. I like the fact that they do not feel compeled to do a storong ale or some spiced up brew for the holiday season. This and their stout are there two best brews IMHO."
