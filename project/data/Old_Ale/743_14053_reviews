"The taste is raisin, rum, slight oak, pumpernickel bread, and dark cherry.  This definitely tastes a bit like a dubbel, yet I still get old ale.  Complex and dangerously drinkable.  This may be my favorite from the brewery."
"Overall:  This is a pretty decent beer, but not great.  Some good malt flavors, but a little too much licorice for my liking.  However, because a portion of the proceeds of this beer goes to charity, specifically, the Wolf Sanctuary of Pennsylvania, I’ll get a few more bottles of it to support that charity."

"Not a very good old ale, more like a strong amber ale with very simple character."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter glass. Color is very dark brown/almost black, but when held up to bright light, it shows a deep ruby, cloudy red color. Deep tan head, with little lacing. Aroma is a blend of caramel, chocolate, and some spices like cloves I believe. Taste hits with a good balance of hops and malt. The malt comes through slightly over the hops, with good heavy caramel and a slight chocolate flavor. Slight spice flavor in the background without overpowering. Crisp mouthfeel. Well balanced and pretty smooth for a warmer with a decent kick."

"For me this was the perfect example of a winter warmer ale.  The taste is bold and warming.  The subtle booziness doesn't overpower the flavor but you can feel it's there!  The dark color gives way to a perfect blend of spices and smoky flavors.  This may be one of my all time favorites!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice brew where the malts and hops are well blended but there is too much alcohol taste leaking through for my liking but if you like that sort of thing then give this a try."
""
"12/14...very dark brown, red tints, light sneaks through. No foam. Malty cola nose, breads, caramel, light fruit. Tasteis a chewy fruit, quite boozy, light bitter. Astringent mouthfeel."

"Overall, supreme drink for the winter go search it out if it's available in your area...most definitely the best offering I've ever had from Lancaster this is world class for me!"

"Overall:  This is an acceptable beer.  When I first tasted it, I had to pause, because I couldn't quite put my finger on whether I liked it or not.  By the end, I decided it was pretty much a miss.  It's not totally a lost cause, but I wouldn't race back for another one.  I will say, however, that I stepped outside about half-way through the drink to have a quick smoke, and it was freezing out there.  I came in a couple minutes later, and I don't know--maybe it was the cold--but the beer tasted better to me, at least for the first couple minutes after I sat down."

"The beer off the pour looks great. But the flavor profile is way, way too malty sweet. No balance whatsoever. Some people might dig this interpretation of the style, but I can't say that I really do. It just doesn't work for me. And I personally don't think it fits to style. Too sweet with not enough accent to keep it interesting. I suppose you could age it to see what happens."
""
""
"A slow sipping winter warmer, high alcohol and lower carbonation make the drink sit well and allow it to warm. The beer flavor is very simple and spread very thin but I appreciate the balance of spice, sweetness and fruit notes."
"I can’t stand winter beers with spices and crap in them. This is just a big, bold winter brew and I love it"
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is surprisingly medium. It's sweet and smooth, but not as heavy as I would think. The carbonation is light, thankfully. And the beer eventually finishes a little dry and peppery with faint hops. It's pretty much overly sweet and not balanced well, but that is a description of the style now isn't it?"
"O - The ABV is there for a Winter Warmer but too wimpy on the flavor and mouthfeel for my liking."
""

"Poured from a bottle to a 12oz globe. Shows a dark brown to black hue depending on the light. Large amount of brown lacing when pour vigorously. Dissipates quickly. Sweet nectar smelling. Molasses. The dark pour emanates the dark fruit odor, such as candied raisins. Chocolate and Car Bitter on the tounge intially finishes smooth with very little aftetaste. Slightly malty. Packs a punch at 8.9% abv."
""

""

"This is probably the best bottled beer I've had from Lancaster, and only one of two I'd recommend at all. (The other is their Milk Stout, which is passable.)"
""
"This was a really nice complex beer, I would drink this again."
"A good 'cold night by the fireplace' beer."
""
"This is a pretty decent ale, but it isn't all that complex. It is straightforward and very easy to enjoy."

"O - nice winter warmer. I really like the fruit character but it didn't quite come all together for me."
"Overall – A quite delicious and nice warming winter ale. Quite nice."
""
"O- Be patient. The warmer it is, the more flavorful it is. I learned this on my last three gulps. This is a really good beer, sweet, but it has some balance. High in alcohol, but relatively unnoticeable. On a cold winter night, start a fire, pour this beer, relax and take your time with it. And think about the wolves, too."
""
"O- A very nice brew, I wish they could hide the alcohol a bit better, as it would greatly improve the brew."
""
"This was a very complex and robust Old Ale. The nose seemed to have a little more burn to it than the palate did. All I can say is – don’t let the harsh aroma scare you off with this one, because everything else about the brew is absolutely wonderful."

"A handsome pour. Nice well rounded tight head with great retention. You can smell Cherry, sherry, and toasty prune malts from across the table. More flavors going on the nose like a sweet belgian candi. Full tasting, blasting through my taste buds with a thick, rich, complexity. Very smooth yet very full mouth feel. Creamy, not much bitterness at all. Not much of a fan of these so called ""winter"" beers, but damn this one is good! High abv is hard to detect as it is 9% alcohol. The toasty, cherry(not cloying) sweetness remains well after the beer is down. I don't know what style this should be(it's no old ale) classified as except the winter is a great time for it, but damn it belongs by your fireplace when it gets cold and it is a very, rich, flavorful surprise I will continue to buy! Best so called winter warmer I've had since Sam Adam's ""screwed up"" it's 2003 circa recipe!"

"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It has a dark magohney color body with a little bit of tan head. The smell is malty and roasted nut. The taste is roasty and malty up front, with kinda of a burnt taste on the back of the tongue. The mouth feel is nice and overall is a good winter style beer."
"O: A very steady beer that is easly drinkable but wuold expect a more robust beer for the style."
""
"Out of a bottle this Old Ale was a nearly opaque, dark mahogany color with one finger of khaki-colored head. The retention was good and the lacing as a delicate, sliding curtain. The aroma was rich and malty with notes of raisin bread, vanilla, caramel, light booze and dark fruits. The flavors were not quite as well balanced as the aroma, however. I tasted the sweet, dark malt first and the prunes/dates followed by a note of wood and some roasted malt on the finish. The nearly 9% ALC was well-hidden. The finish lingered on my palate but wasn’t quite bitter/hoppy enough to counteract the malts. The mouthfeel was semi-creamy, the body medium and the carbonation delicate."
""

""
""
"This is pretty heavy-duty for a winter warmer. Good flavor and acts the part of its namesake. Worth a whirl."
""
""
""
"Edit: After looking at the profile of this beer I see that it is, in fact, an old ale. It also does a reasonably good job of hiding the ABV."
""
""
"Poured out as a deep red color with a tan colored head on top. The lacing was minimal here. The smell of the beer has some spicy notes and a sweet malty aroma also. The taste of the beer has a caramel flavor followed up by somw of the warming spices. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy feeling and had a medium body. Overall this beer isn't too bad, I'd try it again if I say it on a menu somewhere."
""
""
"Overall: A solid winter offering from Lancaster. Well rounded flavors, spice is used appropriately, and suited to warm the insides during the coldest part of the year."
""
""
"Taste is malty to say the least. malts are heavy and sweet lots of molasses and dark fruits. Mouthfeel is on the heavier side, but is also quite smooth and sticky with a soft alcohol finish. Overall pretty desent. Sweetness and alcohol rule this beer."
"Overall - I went to school out in lancaster and used to drink this on tap years back with not much of a refined palate. I have to admit, i am not a big LBC fan...at all.Revisiting this one years later and i have to say i am pretty impressed. Very tasty drinkable beer that is great on this cold rainy december night."
""
""
"O: I call this one a tie. Both were solid old ales."
"O- Not a standout beer, but I will admit that I am not a fancier of winter ales and winter warmers. It didn't blow me away, but it didn't suck. LBC makes some respectable beers and this was overall a solid effort."
""
""
"overall; for such a high abv, little alcohol is perceived, making this a drink to be repected. I'm nearly clueless on the style but I would recommend this one, very tasty."
""
"Dark brown in appearance with less than a finger of head that had no retention. There is both sweet and sour in the nose. The upfront flavor is malt with a touch of alcohol booziness (not anything unpleasant at all). The finish is bitter also with a lingering alcohol presence. Not bad for a late night sipper when you have overdone it a bit with the Thanksgiving leftovers."
"Overall a good try from LBC"
""
""
"Taste is sweet candy fruits, roasted malts,sweet breads, spices and a very nice alcohol hit and a small citrus hop bitterness and a very nice crisp ending. I really enjoyed this one and I give it an overall rating of 4.0. Give this delightful winter ale a try I sure enjoyed it. Thanks to Epps Beverage for this sample."
"D-Overall this realyl didn't do it for me. Old ale isn't my fav. style but i def. have beers i like from this style. This just wasn't complex enough for me and didn't have a very good after taste."
"Very good. The first ""Old Ale"" I've had, so I can't compare with others in the style. But a solid nice brew to kick back with."
"Head dissolves to nothing but I assume that is because of the high alcohol content coming in at just about 9 percent. It smells really roasty with some chocolate malts and some plum/dark fruit like smells with a slight earthy/fruity hop smell. Taste is very rich and sweet with the bite in the beginning and the dark fruits and chocolate tastes come together.The sweetness is in the middle ending with a dry slight earthy and very slight citrus hop taste mixing with the dry yeast a slight alcohol taste. The only thing that brings this beer down is the alcohol isn't that well masked but it gets better as it warms a little."
"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): Pours a clear bright ruby body with a small fizzy off-white head that fell to a thin film. Thick sweet malt nose with dark fruits and some burnt caramel. Light licorice note. The flavor is sweet dark caramel with a bit of cherry fruitiness and a little graininess and a husky note on the finish. A little sticky and clingy on the palate up front with fizzy prickly carbonation. A little coarse on the finish. Not bad, but it could be a bit smoother."
"D-it actually goes down real easily and quickly for the ABV. actually this is one of the better old ales I've had. it really does taste like a barley wine that is much easier to drink. go out and get this one, do it for the wolves!"
"d: not very sessionable (given the higher abv), but smooth for the style. reminds me a lot of arcadia's ""big dick's olde ale", which is definitely a good thing."
"This is a very good winter warmer. Nice to enjoy a few of these bad boys during a cold winter night. Very good brew, one of Lancaster Brewings better efforts. Way better then I remembered it being."
"D - The flavor combos just don't do it for me. The overall flavors and feel are off to me. I'm glad I only have a single bottle."
"The Winter Warmer is medium-bodied and eminently drinkable. I have not had much experience with 'old ales', but as far as winter warmers go this is well-crafted and definitely worth a try."
"4.5 D: Overall a pretty good beer. Some of the other categories were on the borderline next up, so I gave this a 4.5. Very flavorful, sweet and fruity, and perfect for a snowy day."
"D - Well it was cool to try and really wanted something like great divides Hibernation ale but got a heavy old ale. Will not buy again."
"12/18/11 Side note: Had a bottle that was down in the cellar for a year. Still pretty boozy but I think it improved. Maybe this brew would do well with extended aging."
"Drinkability- I don't love the beer. I have to be honest. It's a bit too boozy for me and it burns a bit going down the pipes. Couldn't and probably wouldn't drink more than one or two."
"It finishes still slightly sweet with a touch of dryness, with more of the creamy feel and taste, bringing more malts with a touch of chocolate and aged malts. I also start to get a hint of a bitterness too."
"D - Could definitely drink a few of these, would like to try it fresh on tap. I think I would start to feel the alcohol after a few. Overall, a pretty good winter beer."
"Notes: Nice winter ale, not bad for a revisit but not something necessarily worth looking out for..."
"D: Great complexity here with a body that is just a bit thin. A bit too malty at parts and the hopes are non-existent. A tad off balance. However, still a beer with great character. Seek it out if you can!!"
"Overall - What it has in drinkability in lacks in punch. For a beer with this much alcohol I expected a bit more to it, but it does deliver the sweet, malty taste of a good winter beer."
"The good news is that the alcohol is well hidden in this beer. The bad news is there just isn't enough flavor or mouthfeel to make this beer above-average."
"(Bottle into a pint glass) Poured a beautiful dark brown with very thin light brown head that dissipated quickly. The first thing I noticed opening the bottle was the strong fruity aroma. As I let it air and took time to get a good whiff, there were strong molasses notes with a lot of banana and raisin. It smelled like a freshly baked bread, which was lovely. Very light in the mouth, with a hearty hop bite with cinnamony noted to compliment the fruity sweetness. This ia a very refreshing, enjoyable drink and definitely was a warmer!!"
"Thanks to SpeedwayJim for this one! Dark amber almost brown color, no head or lacing. Aroma of dark bread and fruit, caramel, and light nuttiness. Flavor is very doppelbock-like. Dark sugary malts, brown sugar, caramel, bread and over-ripened apples. There's also a light metallic note in the back end on the finish. Medium bodied, average carbonation. Decent beer, and I'm having a hard time believing the ABV is really this high."
"I've been having a lot of fun with the Warmer this year, primarily as a base for mixing with other beers. This item goes well with the Hop Hog if you want to stay big or with the Amish if you need to tone it down a little. At home, I've used Celebration and Lake Placid IPA with decent effect. This could be the universal solvent!"
"Color is a very dark amber. Not much of a smell, but the hops are strong. First taste, you get some smokiness and nuttiness. The more you drink, the caramel comes through more and more. Just a fantastic heavy winter beer. It packs a punch at close to 9%, so don't drink too fast."
"It is not quite smooth with the high alcohol; there is a bit of roughness on the swallow. Like the mouthfeel, this seems in contrast to the sweet and earthy flavor."
"This is a great winter warmer/old ale. Tons of flavors to offer, very warming, easy to sip on, and appropriate for the season."
"Drinkability: Moderately high for a beer of 8.9%; digging the scent and flavors; couldn't have more than one or two but it so damn solid with those flavors, I would have no problem picking more of this up on my next trip to PA."
"Pours a very dark brown with hints of reddish undertones with decent retention of a slight head. The aroma is of caramel malt and dark fruits maybe raisins. The taste is of a caramel malt backbone with hints of dark fruits, the is also a slight alcohol taste as well. The mouthfeel is good, it has a slight carbonation and a slight slick alcohol feel to it. The drinkability is good, you could sit and nurse a couple of these no problem. A very solid beer, nice alcohol content, good flavor and good aroma."
"Summary: Very drinkable winter warmer. Very mild sweet taste, just wish it was a bit thicker."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a small head. Smell is of malts and caramel, slightly sweet. Taste is also of malts and caramel along with alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a decent beer but nothing great."
"Drinkability: This is reasonably complex, well-balanced beer that is clean, tasty and goes down quite smoothly. At 9% ABV it should be drunk with a meal or enjoyed as the last or only beer of the night while warming by the fire with a good book and/or some nice music. This would also be a good choice as a winter brew to serve to friends. I'm pretty sure I'll be having this one again."
"CHEERS!!"
"Dark, but clear mahogany cola color with light cherry tones. Quickly receding tan head with dots of lacing. Aroma is rich with sweet dark fruits, caramel, alcohol, and light floral notes. Body is thick and smooth with minimal carbonation (which is a nice complement to this style and the flavors of this beer). Flavor is very malty and fruity. Caramel, brown sugar sweetness with dark fruits like plum, raisin and figs plus some mild chocolate notes. This beer has aged well and is a very nice winter seasonal, I'll be picking up more these this winter."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and found it highly drinkable for a higher alcohol beer."
"D: As noted above, the mouthfeel contributed to the overall drinkability of the beer. The complimenting taste partnered with the mouthfeel made this beer nice to drink. While the alcohol is fairly strong, it is not too evident in the taste of the beer, making it quite and enjoyable experience. Nice drinking beer overall."
"D: As advertised, this brew would be nice on a cold day, maybe after coming back into the house after shoveling snow, or sledding with the kids. After all, once you are inside and have had a couple of these, the ""Winter Warmer"" label is very aptly named..."
"M/D - There wasn't alot of flavor in this one, definitely wasn't what I was expecting. I guess I was expecting some more spices and flavor. I'll have to pass next time."
"D: One and done here. I had a few sips, then waited about 20 minutes for it to warm, then it was drinkable. Definitely don't want another for a few days."
"Its a very drinkable beer with a low amount of carbonation to fit the bill perfectly. No more than a couple and you will be well for the night!"
"Drinkability: A solid old ale, not breaking any boundaries, but not falling below and standards either. Very malty and very heavy on the yeasty, fruity notes, this one manages to strike most of the right notes, or at least approximate them fairly well. It's a good winter seasonal too, warming without being hot, high enough in alcohol without being overkill for either the style of in general. I dunno if I'd pick up a sixer of it, but I'm glad to have tried it and wouldn't turn it down in the future."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light brown head. In the aroma, malty, small roastiness, cinnamon and nutmeg spice. In the taste, caramel malt, cinnamon and nutmeg spice. A small spice bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry cinnamon and caramel aftertaste. Nice roastiness and good flavor, quite easy to drink, quite nice."
"bitter licorice sticks to the palate for quite some time. the style is a ""one and done"" anyway so i wont deduct for that."
" A lot of so called ""craft"" breweries have a lot to learn about balance. This beer defines balance. Highly recommended."
"looks like a glass of coca cola dark brown with a ruby tint light beige head and a light spotty lace. aroma is clean, fresh, fruity. smooth slightly sweet fruity malt taste with prune and date and raisin, and plum come to mind and not as spiced as other warmers i have tried. mouthfeel is medium, smooth, carbonation is a little light which takes away a little from this beer. otherwise not a bad beer."
"D - This is a very interesting old ale. The complexity really matches up to what I expect from the style. It's quite enjoyable on this cold winter day."
"4 d this is pretty close to what i'd imagine a winter warmer ought to be"
"Note - Kind of an oxymoron, an Olde Ale named Lancaster Winter Warmer... Huh..."
"Beer #4 from my friends at FSRI. Served in a standard pint glass. Poured reddish-brown with ruby highlights around the edges. One inch tight, off-white head that eventually receded into a thin consistent cap. Some strands of lacing present during the tasting. Nose was malty, with dark fruit and cocoa. Taste follows nose, but also a little boozy. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and carbonation was a little prickly. Easy drinking and flavorful. Alcohol is present, but not overpoweringly so."
"Kind of off base drinking a ""Winter Warmer"" when it's 75 degrees outside, but hey, I'll give it a whirl. Smells of red licorice and nutmeg with a hint of cinnamon. Pours to a deep translucent reddish brown. No real head to speak of. Taste is well balanced at the start, then sweet and very tangy in the middle with a sharp bitter almost acidy finish. Mouthfeel is tremendously thick and chewy. AC is evident but not overly so. I like the taste in the beginning and end but it finishes a little harsh for me. My choice would be to dull out the bitterness at the end."
"Very well worth picking up a sixer or growler if you can. I believe I paid in the nature of 9 or10 at the brewpub for a sixer, but highly recommend getting a pint at the bar or a fresh growler. Enjoy."
" For $8.99 per sixer from Stateline in MD this is a great value big winter ale."
"Really interesting and drinkable. Was one that grew on me. I swear the grade increased at least 2/3 of a grade as I worked my way through the beer."
"D: Good drinkability, rich malt and chocolate flavor with the abv fairly well hidden making for good winter drink."
"D - For 8.9% and with complex flavors, this is a very dangerously drinkable old ale."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours dark with reddish highlights when held up to light. The head is almost nonexistant even though there seems to be adequete carbonation. The aroma is sweet, notes of ripe fruit are predominant. The most noticable taste if figs dipped in alcohol. The finish is lingering alcohol. The alcohol is in moderate amounts, not overbearing. This old ale is a full bodied sipper. I was pleasantly suprised by this one."
"Poured a nice dark amber color with a small tan colored head. Smells malty, with fruity undertones... maybe raisin? Little to no hop presence detected in the nose. Mouthfeel is thick. Tastes malty, sweet, little to no hop bitterness. I don't think I could or would want to drink more than one of these. The high alcohol content is well hidden by the malts though. Overall an ok beer."
"this beer pours a nice translucent brown color with a off white head that fades to lacing. the aroma contains a lot of roasted malt character as well as some fruit esters from the yeast. the taste is quite malty with a bit of an alcohol bite behind it the mouthfeel is a little light for a winter warmer, but still pretty good."
"Either this is a less than representative bottle of Winter Warmer or the brewers need to go back to the drawing board (mouthfeel only). I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that it's the former. I'd love to give this one another go round one of these days."

"Great beer will seek after again"
"There are probably many reasons for this poor sampling; I am not familiar with the beers of Lancaster Brewing Company, so this experience will not be used as total judgement. I would gladly try this beer againg under different circumstances, given previous reviews. Beer is a cruel master at that."
"This is a fine beer that I would try again and make a session out of. Thanks to whoever provided this as an extra for me."
"D: The alcohol is noticeable throughout, so this is no poundin' beer. It did nicely accompany my crabcake dinner though."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice little creamy tannish head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is mostly malts, slight hop, slight spice's, toffee, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, with lots and lots of toffee/caramel. The alcohol is hidden very well in this brew. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew. Thanks Joe."
"Way too easy to drink. An excellent beer."
"D-Overall a good offering...would like a bit more upfront flavors in the smell and tatse to make this one a true classic....but a solid brew nonetheless."
"This Winter warmer is a Dark amber with a quickly dissipating head. You get slightly carmel malt sent mix in with the winey bite of the high alchol. It has an earth nutty malt flavor with no hop pressance and notes of currients and celery. Overall its all right but i found not to much to write home about."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a nice mahoganny color with a tan head and fine tiny bubbles. The beer smelled really spicy and had a hint of toffee taste and Christmas spices. The beer was a little sweet and had a right tuff alcohol after burn. I think you should try it but I will most likely not buy again."
"The LBC WW is very complex, it has a great thick malt profile with slight hints of chocolate or caramel. It's a great representation of an Olde Style Ale, is not over spiced, and I would definitely recommend it."
"A sipper due to noticeable alcohol and slight astringency. Well- it's a winter warmer for sure, but aroma and flavor don't seem to reach their potential fullness."
"This is a hearty, big brew. Great for what it is, a winter warmer!"
"This is actually quite a drinkable beer, if you can get past the taste. It isn't super warming, it isn't super spicy, and it isn't super delicious. But once you get past the fact that it doesn't taste amazing, it's a pretty decent beer. Which kind of encapsulates the LBC; I had their sampler once and all I can remember is, wow, none of these beers are standout, but I think I could drink some of them all night and be ok with it. In short, it's a winter beer done like most other LBC beers. Which, to be honest, I'm ok with. I'll take it over a lot of beers, but I'll take most any decent beer over it. A high alcohol, 82/83 point beer. 86 seems a little high. Nice to see an Old Ale being used as a Winter Seasonal though."
"Thanks to DIM for this via trade"
"d: Nit-picking aside, this is a tasty brew that disguises its 8.9% very well,"
"Overall it is a prettty decent brew along with the rest of Lanaster's lineup. I would drink a few of these."
"A nice, somewhat different Winter Warmer from Lancaster. This makes for a nice dessert beer or would work well as a sipper by the fire. Good stuff."
"D - Very good, full flavor and above average w/ plenty of malt to keep your sweet tooth satisfied. A nice winter ale from Lancaster."
"Overall- Let this warm up a bit and the flavor comes out. Very nice. An easy session beer for the winter!"
"Cheers to FroggyFrog for the trade. Pours a dark ruby-mahogany hue with tawny brown highlights and good clarity. Beige head is dense and creamy, billowing up to a full fist in hieght, then gracefully sinking to a thick cap. Holds well and leaves patchy lacing. Caramel, mollasses and vanilla are the big elements of the nose, some piney hop aromas lurk in the background. Crystal and dextrin sweetness upfront, followed by vanilla bean and faint peppery yeast notes. Semi-drying aftertaste, mild grassy pine resin hop flavor and mellow bitterness that is decently balanced. The mouthfeel is super creamy- a light carbonation combined with a body full of dextrinous texture allows a vevlvet smoothness. Finishes with a touch of cardamon/cola taste, some light blackstrap flavor and lingering vanilla. Alcohol is masked and allows an ease of drinkability that could easily lead to hangovers."
" The flavor is strong while not overpowering, a truly full-flavored beer. I found it to be quite easy drinking. It's medium-bodied and smooth, with a roasted finish. Quite a warmer."
"D---Malty yet well attenuated making it very digestible."
"Deep coppery color. Nice off white head. Malty aroma though somewhat subdued. Nice, big malty flavor. Good bitterness to balance the malt. Some lingering malt sweetness. Good body-very smooth. A very drinkable and enjoyable beer. The complete package is very well done. I need to get a six pack instead of a single bottle."
"After smelling it, I wasn't expecting a lot, and as I'm not the biggest ""winter warmer"" fan, my expectations were standard issue, but the flavor was fuller and more sensibly diverse than I was hoping. The ABV does it's job in helping it to live up to it's name, warming all the way down. Still, the palate's pleasure makes this something worthwhile. Goes to show, you can't always judge a book by its cover, or its aroma."
"12 oz bottle. A treat left over from the Dark Lord party we had in Illinois. This one pours a very deep and murky brown color with a light coating of head that falls to an almost full coat over top. There is a light bubble working up from the bottom of hte beer, and a moderate haze sits in the brew. Taking a smell, I find a big maltyness. Lots of raisiney and fig notes, with a caramel sweetness and a light puff of alcohol. I think it smells nice. Taking a sip, I find strong flavors of raisin and chocolate, with a hint of roast and caramel. There is a moderate puff of alcohol in there as well. Its not bad at all. Feel is a solid moderate, with a mild slickness to it. There is very little, if any, carbonation in there. Overall, I find this to be a pretty nice brew. There is a little more alcohol in both the nose and flavor than I like. I like the flavors, with a nice vinous fruit and chocolate. I would have it again."

"Lacking robustness in all areas, except appearance. Not bad in anyway, just comes up short and incomplete."
"D - Drinkability is decent. Fairly mild for an 8.9% abv. A litlle one-dimensional. This beer is all about the malt -- I like it."
"Drinkability: Well done, Lancaster. This one goes down ever too smoothly."
"Caramel malt, spice and bread pudding make up the aroma of this beer. Dark amber in color with a thim white wisp of a head. Fore is toffee, caramel malt, something tart and slightly metallic in there as well..cant pin it down, but it isns a positive. Definitely some sharp spices in there...ginger and clove, but maybe not nutmeg or if there is not very much. The alcohol is very well hidden for 9% tot he point that I am fairly amazed because I cant taste it. Tasty, but it could benefit from some more concentrated spice int he finish that is basically just a sweet caramel malt affair right now."
"Thanks, tubdog13, for the chance to revisit"
"Mouthfeel is smooth, rich, sugary, sweet, slightly tannic. Mild amounts of hops and spice stand out in this bready brew. Also, slightly warming and addictive."
"Another good beer from the resurgent Lancaster. If the draft products are indeed that much better than the bottled, a road trip is seriously in order."
"This is extremely drinkable. Lancaster's bottles are usually a poor representation of the draft versions. But, this is the best bottled brew I've had yet from Lancaster."
"A bit of grassy/herbal hops roll in towards the finish, but dont linger. Overall the beer is decent, but I would hope for some spice in a winter warmer. Would be a solid cask offering I think."
"Cheers!"
"Many thanks to froggyfrog for hooking me up with this bottle!"
"Never have I rated a beer so highly on sight and smell, to have it dive below average on the Big Three categories. I am disappointed and sad for this unfortunate reality."
"Drinkability: I found this beer to be very fresh, tasty, and easy drinking. Worth seeking out."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - lightly chilled in a snifter. It pours a dark brown with red tinges and a half-inch khaki head that leaves little lace. It smells earthy with smoky/nutty malts and maybe coffee and caramel. The taste follows suit with a mild bitterness, some sweetness, hints of alcohol, and a medium body. Not bad, but not terribly impressed, and not sure if I'd call it an old ale - all the earthy/smoked malts remind me of a Scottish. Hides the 8.9% very well though."
"[Thanks to IrishRedRock for sending this Lancaster brew out my way]"
"The aftertaste was alright - contrary to what some reviewers wrote on here, the 8.9% ABV is a bit discernable, but nothing overpowering or ruinous. A nice warmer, but nothing earth-shattering, and certainly able to take the chill off of a cold winter's day such as this one!"
"Last swigs: Just a step away from a Pumpkin Ale. Not mind blowing but overall drinkable. Last years Lancaster WW was hot. This was not. Would give Anchor OSA a run for its money anyday."
"Solid offering and a nice representation for the style...will enjoy this one again soon."
"Drinkability: I'm damn surprised that this beer's this good. I guess I just wasn't expecting it. For an Old Ale at nearly 9% ABV the alcohol's hidden (I actually would've guessed maybe 6% at the highest if I wouldn't have known) extremely well, and the brew is complex on all sides. I'm glad I took a chance, and if you see this around, I'd definitely say do the same."
"A deep honeyish brown with a medium off-white creamy head that laces and lingers as a foamy ring. Smell is..oh hell yeah...malt. And more malt. Beautious huge gobs of toffee. Thick, lowly carbonated, and sweet. Balanced by plums and dark wood, this is just sweet enough. Alcohol is not tasted, but is noticed in the feel and finish. Nutty and very smooth. I would choose this over 80% of old ales and barleywines. This is real nice."
"Very interesting for style. Well constructed, and exuding of quality, but I prefer a maltier profile with sweeter spices for a winter ale. I'm also missing the alcohol warming that others have noted. I'm certain that I would enjoy this one better on a cold winter night, instead of a hot August evening."
"Mouthfeel is light for a winter warmer, which would be medium for most other beer. Easy to drink, a mere hint of the alcohol in the aftertaste. A good beer, a beer I'd drink again, but not a great beer."
"Pours a murky brown color, with a thin, wispy tan head. Alcohol and roasted malt aroma, with a background of wood, ripe fruit, and spice. The flavor is of molasses, brown sugar, and scorched malt. Alcohol warming kicks in pretty early. Theres not a lot of hops in this brew. Instead, it relies on the alcohol and roasted flavors for balance. A little sweet in the front, but not overly so. Its fairly full in body, with moderately-low carbonation. This would warm me on a winter night."
"The smell lets through a slight hint of fruit under a good deal of alcohol. The taste is similar, bringing dark fruits up front and adding a good festive hop kick. The mouthfeel is pretty sharp. Still, it's not too hard to drink."
"Has a medium mouthfeel with lingering sweet malt tastes. Overall, I had this brew a few months back on tap at Thirstys in York and liked it better that way. However, the low spice profile and nice candy sweetness would have me finishing the sixer."
"Drinkbality and Overall: Definitly a great beer to drink while snowed in. Strong, powerful, and still incredibly pleasent. The alcohol gives it just the right amount of kick to keep you drinking, without being overboard. If Lancaster can continue to produce beers of this quality, they will be on the path to greatness."
"Goes down smooth and can be very drinkable, although the ABV may catch up at 8.9%."
"I loved this beer enough to buy a growler of it at Lancaster, and I recommend having a pint or two to anyone loving seasonals!"
"What can I say, these guys never fail to impress me..."
"This beer arrives with a thick, foamy tan head that, much like many of LNC BC's offerings, just dissipates much too quickly. It has a very malty nose with much evidence of an underlying alcohol content. As it warmed, it begins to give off a smell of carmel and/or candi sugar. The color is a deep reddish-brown bordering on mahogany. The mouthfeel is very thick, as well as being intensely sweet as well as noticably hot. The finish is where it really stands out. This is an extremely complex beer for LNC BC, displaying notes of sherry, dark chocolate, and cherries. Very tasty!"
"12 ounce bottle. I don't really know anything about this beer, but if the aroma could be more in tune with the flavor this beer would be a force indeed! The website says it is an Old Ale. At a $1.59 a bottle, this one was a steal..."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thin off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It is sweet, malty, and dry. The taste is good. It is rich and malty with a slight liquorice flavor to it. It goes down easy and finishes dry. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent winter brew. It has good flavor and mouthfeel. This is a good sessions brew."
"Had this op tap at the Drafting Room in Spring House last night,a very nice deep amber pour with a almost creamy- like head that left some lacing.Aroma was of sweet malt with some fruity estures and warming alcohol,taste is carammely sweet with some malty bread tones along with some burned fruit and alcohol notes.A power packed beer full of different flavors and very warming,a real nice beer."
"This beer was a deep amber in color that borderlines ruby. Nice, clear and bright with just a film of a head. The aroma brings forth fermented oranges, some pine, sweet malt with a touch of licorice. The flavor is light and has a fruity hop bite to it, along with a lingering bitterness. Some buttery notes in the texture and an apparent alcohol presence. An interesting beer and a nice winter sipper."
"This sturdy winter offering is solid in every way, starting with its exceptionally deep mahogany body. It's clear with a reddish cast, and reveals ruby highlights when held to the light; and its creamy light tan head slowly dwindles to a collar but leaves some nice, spotty lace. The nose delivers a caramelish malt with some fruit; and its creamy and smooth in the mouth with a firm body and very fine, restrained carbonation. The flavor delivers a rich, caramel malt center wrapped in berry-like fruit and tempered by a solid bitterness. It's just slightly vinous with it's alcohol lending something to its fruit; and there's a cusp of chocolate that combines with its bitterness to take on an almost roasty edge. Yet, it's clean and very well-balanced all around! Quite nice! A tasty treat that shouldn't be missed if you're in the area."
