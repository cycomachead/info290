"Drinkability – A good beer, but not a great beer."

"Rusted and infected. Smelt of coins and tasted much the same"
"Had this right after having Christmas Prairie Bomb. Found this to be much superior than CPB. Doesn't really have typical holiday spices to me, but that is not a criticism. A nice brew. Bought it at a reduced price after the 2013 holiday, and had aged in my cellar for a year."
""
"Delicious with over a year on it"
"Overall I liked this beer and think it's slightly under-rated.  I wouldn't get it again but am really glad I tried it.  Thanks Prairie!"
"A bit sour, a bit savory, a bit delicious. Not exciting, but worth checking out."

"This beer has all kinds of potential. I think the Old Ale notes are quite good when they shine through and I really like the amount of oak and barrel flavor. The mouthfeel really hurts it for me and the bacteria also take away from the good aspects of the beer after a few sips. I would like to try a non-soured version of this. Just lacks a total melding of the flavors presented."
"O - It has potential but it's pretty much a mess. Old ale flavors are just decent, the brett is kinda boring for brett and there's too much of it, definitely too foamy. Not bad, I assume something went haywire with the brett and/or oak barrel."

"Unpleasant sourness that doesn't work well."

"Serving type: bottle"

"overall: not a huge fan it could have been a whole lot better. it almost tastes as though something got into the brew either in the bottle or the barrel more than likely form the spices added. the sour oakyness does fade a bit as it warms."
""
"Decent beer, not sure if it was supposed to be sour or not but very enjoyable."

"This started out as an odd beer but as it warmed up I really enjoyed it! Worth a try."
"Some good bones with the making of an infection...tart cherry flavor is distracting."

"The tart fruits and chocolate and leather, I get, don't blend as cohesively well as I would like. I'm glad I'm splitting this one."
""
""
""
"O: This is an interesting beer, the nose and taste seem to be on conflict, but it works beautifully. Definitely worth a try. Definitely recommended."
"O: I thoroughly enjoyed this! I would have again. Tangentially, there was a touch of cap rust, but nothing bad."

"O - At first I was calling this a stout and remembered that it was an Old Ale. Cool idea and one I really enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- All in all a very complex quality beer, not sure it is worth the 20 dollars I paid for it but I would definitely drink this beer again. Very Unique!"
"Overall: Man, this is great. It’s an old ale, aged in bourbon barrels, and inoculated with wild bacteria. I’m (nearly) speechless. It certainly isn’t traditional by any stretch of the imagination, but I love what they have done with it (4.25/5)."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer smells great but the flavors don't meld like the aroma. The tartness has a middle ground so it seems to be in the way. I'll crack another bottle in a few years to see if this goes further on the sour train."
""
""
""
"A strange beer, but not a bad one. I enjoyed the interplay between the acids and the sugars, something you don’t normally find in darker styles like this. Sure, there are some kinks to work out – I mean, sometimes it comes together and the blend tastes plastic – but it ended up pretty tasty."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not really feeling this Prairie Ale. I'm a huge fan of the brewery but this one seems like a mess. It gave some off flavors. While it was complex the flavors didn't play well together. Good but not great."
""
""
""

"I: pretty awesome imo. Tart, dark cherry abd effervescent are what will stick with me! /92"

"I suppose this is what you'd call a winter saison in principal, but it's a little too blown out of proportion to be fully elegant in execution. Not the worst I've had of its kind, but memorable for more bad reasons than great. The wild yeast is really giving the beer a beating at this point, and many of the oak and malt/spice nuances that would make this refreshing are going to become more overrun. I don't know if this varies from bottle to bottle, but it's definitely something I'm going to look out for every time this passes my way."

"MF – Medium-bodied, semi-dry finish with a bit of creaminess. 4.5"

"A nice, medium-bodied old ale. Enjoyed it."

"Pours a three-finger cream/beige head that fades slowly to a ring leaving some lace. Deep opaque brown color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Dark fruit and oak nose. Flavor is dark fruit, oak, vinous grapes; high ABV is mostly hidden. Decent old ale. Pricey at $13.50 for a 500ml bottle from a Tully’s Beer & Wine Wells, ME. And first bottle from Oklahoma after 3400 bottles."
"O- Well done, but just not my style."
"Well worth the price, thank you Prairie for this late Xmas gift."
""
""
"O: Lots going on, but in somewhat different directions. Not focused, but interesting."
"Overall, pretty good, complex, and interesting. Tastes good too."
"An eye-popping beer that immediately reveals its wild yeast heritage and high ABV. The overall taste may be too phenolic for some, but if you're looking for an old ale beer on the wild side, this one may peek your interest."
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, toffee, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour malt, caramel, and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but the slight tartness is unexpected."
""
"An interesting variation on an Old Ale. There are nice underlain traditional dark fruit notes and sweet bready notes but with a woody funk and mild tart acidity that makes this beer dangerously drinkable. (3.75)"

"Really flavorful take on the style here."

"O - Mild flavors, but boozy and dark fruits try to show. Not that great."
""
""
""
"Taste bittersweet choc, caramel, dates, prunes and leaves a dark chocolate coating behind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a bubbly head that disappears quickly. Smells of chocolate, fruit and malt. Those all carry over to the taste. Also notes of cherry and prune. Oily tongue and lots of carbonation. The style isn't my favorite, but this beer is well done."
"Prairie The Beer That Saved Christmas ---4/5."
""
"Notes: I liked the sounds of the beer, particularly with Prairie's track record. This fell flat for me though. Nice looking and smelling but the taste a little bland. The dark cherry notes with the Brett was nice but it was too subtle to carry the show and nothing else stood out. Not a bad beer and a neat label. At $10-11 for 500 ml of barrel aged 10% old/wild ale it's not a bad price if you're curious, but I doubt I'll repurchase."
""
"O - Not a bad combination of flavors, but not one of my favorites. It is definitely unique and gets points on creativity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown in color with a thin but tightly knit cream colored head. I get some serious bourbon,carmelized sugar,and dark malt in the aroma. The flavor is molasses,Brett,plums, and bourbon and it somehow works together. The blend of molasses and bourbon are sweet,but the tartness of the Brett quickly follows. Mouthfeel is thick but dry."

"Not bad, but certainly came up short of expectations. I'm sure this will age well, but very rough on the edges now. Maybe my least favorite beer from these guys. If I buy any more it will be to age"

"o - Overall a decent old ale, though I was hoping for more having heard great things about their other beers. Nose is nice but the taste is light and a lot of dark fruits and burnt malts. Decent but looking forward to trying their other stuff."
"O: Not a bad beer but the beer seems to be a hot mess of flavors sordove running together."

"Pours a solid dark brown bordering on black with a decent sized off white head that shows great retention. Aromas of caramel and brown sugar, a hint of oak and higher spirits, a bit of papery oxidation, and a light lactic cherry fruitiness. Light chocolate comes out especially as she warms. The flavor is sweet and dark sugary up front. Alcohol, tart cherries, tobacco, and chocolate fly in midway through. Finishes with a lingering caramel and fruity tartness. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sugary but somewhat tart mouthfeel. Decent brew I enjoyed it."
"Overall a great wild ale that sadly appears to be misunderstood here."
""
"O- Disappointing. Light in taste (which some could say its nice and subtle), and light in body and mouthfeel. I wish I could like it as old ales are one of my favorites. This is probably the least favorite I've tried in that style though."

"very cool packaging on this, white wax, funky red label, very cool, very holiday, not cheap, but a darn good beer inside too. barrel aged old ale, cool stuff. light brown color, thick and hazy, with a red tint, looks like a big English barleywine, without a ton of head. nose of sweet bourbon, rich caramel malt, oak, and brown sugar. its sweet for sure in taste, but about midway through comes a flash of tart fruit, maybe cranberry or raspberry, before the bourbon woody dusty old ale finish we all know and love. its a short burst, but a memorable one. it confuses the mouthfeel between sweet and tart, and between heavy and light, and this is a rather tough beer to classify as a result. it also has a slightly wild yeast element, indicative of other prairie beers, and it sort of shakes up the old ale conventions, but not so much as to render it out of style. sweeter in the finish too, with brown sugar and a little holiday spice hanging around after the swallow. a good beer, but a little to much going on to be fully cohesive, even in light of the bourbon barrel, which is usually unifying. prairie is starting to price their beers out of reach for me to have them regularly, I took a chance on this and don't regret it, but not something I will revisit at this price."

"Oddly put together. Missing a backbone. It seems as though TBtSC is a bit of wanderer...it doesn't have a definitive beer base. It's good, but not memorable. It may end up not being what you sought out for...but it's kinda like Christmas in a bottle, in an odd way..."
"The feel is creamy, not entirely thick but very smooth."
""
"Pours dark brown, shaded with magenta. Opaque. Probably cloudy but it's too dark to really tell. Small light beige head. Decent lacing, retention for a beer of this strength. Stewed berries, cocoa, brown sugar and apricots in the nose. I think there's some barrel presence, but it's kinda hard to tell what's what. Possibly some spirit and oak knocking around. It smells like sugar cookies, fruitcake and rum (that's more a function of the alcohol and fruitiness, rather than any sort of guess at the barrels used). The taste also has lots of fruit and heavy sweetness. A tad medicinal. Some definite booze. Light chocolate. Berries and apricots soaked in caramel, wine and booze. Thick feel. Never gets too sticky, though. Interesting stuff. Definitely more legitimately old ale-ish than I expected, which is fun. It's not a barleywine, and there's a whole bunch of stuff going on. Good for a cold winter night, but this beer might catch some off-guard."

"taste is a slight bitter, stoutness with a little tart on top of that. I get the tart cherries that others were referring to. a bit thin, which gives it a twangy, almost metallic taste, but for 10% it's pretty good. not a lot of alcohol in the taste. If I had brewed this, i'd be proud; but in the world of beer distribution, it's a little better than decent. artwork on the label is choice also...."
"O - Incredibly dry finish. Interesting flavor profile, but not necessarily may favorite holiday brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Dark malt and fruit flavors upfront, with a surprising sour edge. Raisin, mild toffee, red grape skin, rum barrel, sour plum and some tingling alcohol on the finish. Not that this says much, but this is probably my least favorite of their beers so far. Still digging it though and I'd love to see what this is like in a few years. Feels like it needs to round out a bit. It's not ready to save Christmas just yet."

"O- 90-95/100. this is a great beer. I wish it was an annual brew."
""
"I actually enjoyed this one, but it's definitely not an old ale unless it was infected. As far as the taste goes I get some mild barrel/old ale flavors, there are hints of vanilla but it's mostly a red grape/vinous tart flavor. Not overpowering and actually kind of pleasant, but I'm a fan of pretty much everything sour/funky. I'm really interested in the back story for this beer, overall pretty good. I'd give it a solid B, weird beer for sure though."
""

"Pours a dark amber with flashes of orange around the edges, small off white head dissipates to leave behind thick lacing. Smell is vinous Brett, bourbon and whiskey, cola. Taste is woody bourbon, some wine character, dry cola, cold coffee. Mouthfeel is off dry and slick. Overall not bad but not the best, could use some age to mellow out the bitter and bring up some of the fruitier Brett character."
""
"This beer also had significant condensation under the cap/wax as report in the forum,not really an issue but could be down the road."
"this is an english olde ale style, apparently. it probably needs a couple years in the bottle. that said, i really enjoyed the beer. the price was not great, but i think the investment in saving a couple bottles might be. light head and body, roasty, but almost like there was some lager yeast involved. the thing that stuck out for me was just like the wine barrel noir - it's like chocolate covered cranberries. it's not exactly ""sour."" it's not exactly ""dessert"" chocolatey. it's kind of an uncomfortable medium. i think a couple years in the bottle might do this well, but i also thought the mid-nineties cleveland indians would be unstoppable. i guess we'll see. until then, we can only get in line for a two bottle per person limit to pay for wax and amber glass. i hope the best for this beer."
"Overall meh, pretty bland and one trick pony esp for so much bourbon."
""
"O - Overall this was a relatively disappointing beer. Rather one note."
""
""
""
"Starts off with a dark brown pour with a creamy toffee head. The smell is enticing right off the bat with hints of spice, oak, and leather...a great combination. The initial taste was a touch sour for my palate, but as I continue to ""push"" through, I found it to be very crisp on the tongue for a dark ale with a continuation all the way through to the end; ten minutes after a sip, you can still get the tartness and the hints of oak/vanilla throughout. Halfway through my first bottle, I realized that yes...this is a pretty darn good beer and one that I will obtain for my cellar."
"Ok, so to recap- the beer made your mother's voice reconcilable. It did just the trick with that wide range of foods. ...but dealing with all those kids- It just might make you want to join right in!"

"I wonder if this beer would be better if cellared or aged for a few more months. 10% is a doozy, but pretty standard by Prairie."
