3.66,-1.6,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter glass. Color is very dark brown/almost black, but when held up to bright light, it shows a deep ruby, cloudy red color. Deep tan head, with little lacing. Aroma is a blend of caramel, chocolate, and some spices like cloves I believe. Taste hits with a good balance of hops and malt. The malt comes through slightly over the hops, with good heavy caramel and a slight chocolate flavor. Slight spice flavor in the background without overpowering. Crisp mouthfeel. Well balanced and pretty smooth for a warmer with a decent kick.","KWrightVT","Jan 01, 2015"

By the end, I decided it was pretty much a miss.  It's not totally a lost cause, but I wouldn't race back for another one.  I will say, however, that I stepped outside about half-way through the drink to have a quick smoke, and it was freezing out there.  I came in a couple minutes later, and I don't know--maybe it was the cold--but the beer tasted better to me, at least for the first couple minutes after I sat down.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","0"

Creamy, not much bitterness at all. Not much of a fan of these so called ""winter"" beers, but damn this one is good! High abv is hard to detect as it is 9% alcohol. The toasty, cherry(not cloying) sweetness remains well after the beer is down. I don't know what style this should be(it's no old ale) classified as except the winter is a great time for it, but damn it belongs by your fireplace when it gets cold and it is a very, rich, flavorful surprise I will continue to buy!

The flavors were not quite as well balanced as the aroma, however. I tasted the sweet, dark malt first and the prunes/dates followed by a note of wood and some roasted malt on the finish. The nearly 9% ALC was well-hidden. The finish lingered on my palate but wasn’t quite bitter/hoppy enough to counteract the malts.

3.47,-6.7,3.5,4,3,4,3.5,"This is actually quite a drinkable beer, if you can get past the taste. It isn't super warming, it isn't super spicy, and it isn't super delicious. But once you get past the fact that it doesn't taste amazing, it's a pretty decent beer. Which kind of encapsulates the LBC; I had their sampler once and all I can remember is, wow, none of these beers are standout, but I think I could drink some of them all night and be ok with it. In short, it's a winter beer done like most other LBC beers. Which, to be honest, I'm ok with. I'll take it over a lot of beers, but I'll take most any decent beer over it. A high alcohol, 82/83 point beer. 86 seems a little high. Nice to see an Old Ale being used as a Winter Seasonal though.","bigeyedfish","Nov 27, 2007"

4.03,8.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Cheers to FroggyFrog for the trade. Pours a dark ruby-mahogany hue with tawny brown highlights and good clarity. Beige head is dense and creamy, billowing up to a full fist in hieght, then gracefully sinking to a thick cap. Holds well and leaves patchy lacing. Caramel, mollasses and vanilla are the big elements of the nose, some piney hop aromas lurk in the background. Crystal and dextrin sweetness upfront, followed by vanilla bean and faint peppery yeast notes. Semi-drying aftertaste, mild grassy pine resin hop flavor and mellow bitterness that is decently balanced. The mouthfeel is super creamy- a light carbonation combined with a body full of dextrinous texture allows a vevlvet smoothness. Finishes with a touch of cardamon/cola taste, some light blackstrap flavor and lingering vanilla. Alcohol is masked and allows an ease of drinkability that could easily lead to hangovers.","PBRstreetgang","Feb 16, 2007"

The ABV does it's job in helping it to live up to it's name, warming all the way down. Still, the palate's pleasure makes this something worthwhile. Goes to show, you can't always judge a book by its cover, or its aroma.","Foxman","Aug 26, 2006"
3.83,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"12 oz bottle. A treat left over from the Dark Lord party we had in Illinois. This one pours a very deep and murky brown color with a light coating of head that falls to an almost full coat over top. There is a light bubble working up from the bottom of hte beer, and a moderate haze sits in the brew. Taking a smell, I find a big maltyness. Lots of raisiney and fig notes, with a caramel sweetness and a light puff of alcohol. I think it smells nice. Taking a sip, I find strong flavors of raisin and chocolate, with a hint of roast and caramel. There is a moderate puff of alcohol in there as well. Its not bad at all. Feel is a solid moderate, with a mild slickness to it. There is very little, if any, carbonation in there. Overall, I find this to be a pretty nice brew. There is a little more alcohol in both the nose and flavor than I like. I like the flavors, with a nice vinous fruit and chocolate. I would have it again.","kmpitz2","Apr 29, 2006"

The color is a deep reddish-brown bordering on mahogany. The mouthfeel is very thick, as well as being intensely sweet as well as noticably hot. The finish is where it really stands out.

The nose delivers a caramelish malt with some fruit; and its creamy and smooth in the mouth with a firm body and very fine, restrained carbonation. The flavor delivers a rich, caramel malt center wrapped in berry-like fruit and tempered by a solid bitterness. It's just slightly vinous with it's alcohol lending something to its fruit; and there's a cusp of chocolate that combines with its bitterness to take on an almost roasty edge. Yet, it's clean and very well-balanced all around! Quite nice! A tasty treat that shouldn't be missed if you're in the area.","NeroFiddled","0"
