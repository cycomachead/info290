Has a lightly sweet toasted nutty dark caramel malty nose with some English hoppiness. Starts with pretty good fullness and sweet toasted caramel maltiness with a touch of dark fruits before a drier bittersweet finish. Well-balanced and quite drinkable.","jbaker67","Dec 03, 2013"

4.17,15.8,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A very interesting beer. It's body is very dark brown, with just a bit of tan blooming up before settling to a collar. Not nearly as sweet and syrupy as some of the other old ales that I've had, but delicious all in its own right. The malts are quite toasty, and an earthy, autumnal element looms large. The whole flavor profile strikes me as fall-like, rather than wintery. The carbonation is quite low, and the feel is satisfyingly full. Extremely tasty.","droomyster","Feb 14, 2011"

2.67,-25.8,2.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): Pours almost prune into the glass, with a nice soapy eggshell head that leaves thick lace. The nose has lots of fruity sours with some toast and malt. The flavors are sour (very reminiscent of biting down on a fresh pine needle... that initial sour bite), toasted malt and finishing with a nice lingering bitter. The mouthfeel is slick and easy (due to the many esters at work). A decent old ale overall.","CuriousMonk","Jan 02, 2011"

It had some decent strength but without any spice I wouldn't have known. Work on the recipe a bit and it could be good, don't keep this as your Christmas Ale though...","bennetj17","Dec 09, 2010"

3.03,-15.8,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,"The flavor is really quite bland. The sweetness kind of takes over and all of the better fruit characteristics from the nose are essentially lost, giving way to a bit of a brown-sugar edge. There is a touch of alcohol, but not overpowering at all. The feel is quite a bit too light for the style and for the flavors in general. This went down fairly easily, but the one-dimensional flavor and light mouthfeel are not what I'd like out of this style, or many beers for that matter.","Thorpe429","Nov 14, 2010"
4.22,17.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"It is great for a Holiday beer because it isn't too sweet and isn't spiced. We can dring it from Halloween to New Years and it is consistently good.","dball","Jan 12, 2010"

3.25,-9.7,4.5,2,4,3,3,"Drinkability: This is a pretty good beer and its easy drinking enough. I drank a few on draft and really enjoyed them, but this just doesnt stand up to many of the old ales out there.","rapidsequence","Dec 05, 2009"
4.17,15.8,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured with a very fizzy noisy head. The light brown head quickly fell into the glass and left no lacing. It is brown to deep amber. Smells very fruity. Brown sugar, banana, and caramel come through. The taste is very similar to the smell. Raisins, fig, and toffee. Kind of winey flavor as well. Maybe some toasted grain in the background. This is medium body and very enjoyable. I will be seeking this out again before the season is over.","hops4me","Nov 17, 2009"
4,11.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep reddish brown with lots of lively carbonation and a slight head. The aroma is bready and yeasty with a sting of bitter hops coming later. Flavor is yeasty and malty, with hints of coffee and intense molasses with a little flowery hop overtone and a nice malt burn. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth.","Seanibus","Beers"
4.12,14.4,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D: Big and malty with dark fruit leading the way and some earhty, herbal hops creating a nice finish. Blue Mountain continues to produce great beers in a picturesque, pure environment.","argock","0"

2.24,-37.8,4,2.5,2,2,2,"I think I got a bad bottle. Mine tasted like finger nail polish, mixed with tart fruit, and alcohol. Very strange. Smell was somewhat similar, but not as up front as the taste. I'd be willing to try it again, but for now, I'm going to have to pour the rest down the drain. Sorry.","JISurfer","Dec 25, 2008"
3.28,-8.9,4,3.5,3,4,3,"Lights Out is not exactly lights out beer. It's an okay beer, but it sorely needs some punch. A nice dose of hops would probably do much to improve it. They would give it just the zeal it needs. As it is, it's maybe a little above average overall. But, there's a load of great holiday beers that are far superior. It's not something I'd seek out. But, I'm very grateful for the opportunity to give it a go.","prototypic","Nov 08, 2008"
3.6,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This is a very interesting take on an old ale and certainly drinkable. I can't place the tartness in the taste, but otherwise this is pretty solid brew.","gford217","Nov 02, 2008"
3.88,7.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall impression: This is a very enjoyable holiday ale. You don't really get that it is 7% ABV. The malt and spice really blend well. This is definitely a slow sipper but one that will take away the head aches from the family holiday meals.","edmedina","Oct 22, 2008"
3.88,7.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A little better on tap than out of the bottle, I think. This one's nice, mellow, complex, and mature, with an entirely moderate level of alcohol for the style. Glad they finally got this one out - too bad it's a style that's more suited for winter, when you can't really enjoy the beautiful scenery visible from Blue Mountain's outdoor patio.","CrellMoset","Beers"
3.95,9.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D: A fairly mellow sipper, and a nice tasting beer. Another fine offering from Blue Mountain. I'll be looking forward to a bit more over the season.","Proteus93","0"
