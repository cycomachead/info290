I was kind of thrown for a loop with it being classified as an old ale (think Hibernation ale by Great Divide), which are generally darker, fruitier, and more complex. This drinks like a Kolsch or Summer ale almost with a slight hint of more wintery oriented brews. Great taste, but lacking in the overall niceties you want from an all-around strong old ale. The characteristics are there, but not enough in my opinion. For my first Alaskan beer though, I am fairly satisfied and could easily drink a few of them in one sitting. Will have to check out more of their selection.","Jaysauras","Dec 15, 2014"
4.51,22.6,,,,,,"Very nice. While I wasn't sure at first, I also pick up on tartness that really reminds me of wild Alaskan blueberries (which I'm very familiar with) in both aroma and taste. I don't don't know where it's coming from, but I like it. Overall, this is an ale that doesn't overpower in any area, but is balanced and integrated as well as unique. Subtlety is key, using only the tips, and not the whole tree!","Kuaff","Dec 13, 2014"

Aromas of roasted malt, banana, baked apple, bread, a wee bit of piney hops.  This is a very sweet beer (as a winter ale should be), with some tanginess from the spruce.  Lightly carbonated.  The spruce gives it a bit of a drier character than you would expect with a winter ale.  Not a very long finish.  Overall an enjoyable beer, although I am not particular fond of spruce tips as flavoring.","PacNWDad","Dec 09, 2014"

4,8.7,,,,,,"Poured a clear amber body with no real head. It looks alright, though not the best for the style. Scents of fruity esters, apple, sweet malt with aromas of brown sugar, sweet spices, especially cinnamon and light bubblegum. Overall impression of aroma is of a sweet Old Ale that is quite appealing in its overall profile and true to the style. The spruce tips do not show up in the aroma which is disappointing. Flavor begins malty sweet with notes of brown sugar, apple and brown bread, with a light spiciness of cinnamon and a very light resinous bitterness, likely the spruce tips. This moves into a middle with more abundant cinnamon, as well as a light a alcohol presence. Finish is lightly sweet with notes of apple, sweet malt and brown sugar mingling with cinnamon and sweet spices and balanced by a light presence of alcohol and a slight bitterness. Aftertaste is lightly bitter with notes of cinnamon, alcohol, what I assume is spruce and grainy malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a nice Old Ale, spicy and sweet, but not cloying and with a nice bitterness in the background. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with medium-light carbonation. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very smooth, easy to drink beer. Overall this is a rather nice Old Ale. It is sweet and spicy as the style demands, and despite it's 6.4% ABV it shows its alcohol well, which is pleasant for a winter's night. It is smooth and easy going down and quite pleasant.","Auraan","Dec 08, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy bright orange color with a small dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, pear, apple, berries, spruce, herbal, grass, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, spruce, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, pear, apple, berry, spruce, herbal, grass, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, pear, apple, berry, spruce, herbal, grass, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt, spruce, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice old ale style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, spruce, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 07, 2014"

Skates on the edge of too sweet, but sweetness is balanced by the malt and apple and grape juice flavors. Light to medium bodied. A pleasant light flavored ale with an interesting pine flavor from the spruce, but not nearly malty enough to be an old ale. I enjoyed it, but not what I expected.","LiquidAmber","Nov 26, 2012"

Aroma is malt, caramel, toffee, fruit, wet grain. Flavor's like nose, on the sweet side, but not overly; sweet and carbonic tang are in front with just enough bitter to balance it all nicely.

I have to say for this brew, I enjoyed a nice lightly balanced caramel grainy brew with a pleasant accent of spices and a woody note which I'll attribute to spruce but profess to not having sampled any other spruce type product over the past year(s) for which to compare this to.

This beer tastes somewhat like spruce, but it's not an altogether pleasant taste and I don't really get why it's there. The beer isn't rich or balanced enough to take on the spruce flavor. Alaskan calls it an English old ale, which sets it up for some unfortunate comparisons as there are some very big and excellent old ales out there. That's a refined category of subtle, hand-crafted ales. This beer is none of those things. Oh, it's not a bad beer. It just borders on mediocrity. There's some sweet malt and some mild hops with a touch of spice. Nothing really comes together, though. The taste is not balanced to begin with, and the spruce just further knocks things off course. The individual flavors are all pretty good. They just don't really work together for my palate.

On the palate, rich buttery malts and a twang of slight fruitiness toward the end, with some metallic notes cropping up as well. Whatever spruce characteristic there is is very subtle; too subtle, in fact, for me to detect. Mouthfeel is fairly nondescript, but by no means bad: malty but not slick, little acidity, medium carbonation that is unassuming.

This beer is actually quite sweet. The malty sweetness overpowers the bitterness coming from the finishing hops. Flavors of citrus and sweet caramel meld fairly well in this beer just leaning towards sweeter than balanced. The mouthfeel is medium carbination, slightly watery, and medium bodied.

The aroma is bright, maybe too sweet, piney, fruity and a noticeable amount of alcohol. As mentioned on the bottle, that dominant aroma is spruce tips. The taste is a bit cloying but nice, more of a fruity bubblegum with a firm malt backbone and bitter hop finish, then the dominate spruce in the aroma - but make no mistake, it is certainly there...I just think it is really nicely balanced, much more then the aroma would leave you to believe. My taste runs towards sweeter, extreme tasting to beers, so consider that when I say that I really enjoyed the taste of this one. Only complaint would be the the aftertaste looses the balance and can be a bit sprucy, but it creeps on you slowly. The mouthfeel was perfect, and it was one the most drinkable winter ales I've, at least from this country.

The taste starts out with a nice bitter kick, most likely a tongue tingling combo of lightly fruity hops and the spruce tips this beer claims to be brewed with. Mellows out into nutty caramel malts with a lingering bitterness. Probably the first of the Winter warmer style that I've had where the thought popped into my head that it could easily be a year-round beer, even though I wouldn't drink it that much.

The finish and after taste are of much greater note. A dry, spruce induced finished lingers on the palate for quite a time after taking a sip. This is a unique brew, not one that I could or would particularly drink many in one sitting.

I found a slight impression of raspberry along with a lingering pineyness in the aftertaste.

Tastes like many other winter warmers -- however, the bottle says it is brewed with spruce tips, and I this characteristic comes through, I think, not as woodsy or piney as I would have expected, but almost like a reaspberry fruitiness. In fact, this reminds me alot of the flavor of Berkshire Brewing's Raspberry Strong Ale - though not quite as malty, sweet, and raspberry filled. It has a good crisp snappy hop finish that keeps it dry enough to avoid a cloying flavor.

The nose offers gentle wafts of sweetish, biscuity, caramel-laced malt; and in the mouth it's delicately crisp and then smooth. The flavor delivers the same maltiness found in the nose, balanced by a mild brush of drying spruce that appears across the middle and lingers mildly in the finish.

What a waste of such lovely liquid. All things head related on this beer were sub-par. The nose doesn¬ít say much. My first whiff said bananas. What?

At first there are hints of apple cider. Is this beer spiced? Is it just hops I taste? I get some weak spicy notes; I can¬ít really place them (ginger?). The malt is odd too, lightly toasty. Some alcohol heat is noticeable. Light woody notes at the back. The palate is close to being good; maybe it is good right now and it is close to being great.

Fruity tartness continues seamlessly in flavor, and is of an odd, but agreeable tamarind like nature. Simple and stately buttery biscuit and medium caramel malt backbone. Understated hop bitterness leaves ample residual sweetness that precludes easy quaffing. Orange flesh hop flavor with a floral, non descript continental twang. Thins considerably in flavor and body mid palate, leaving a vacuous, airy, diluted molasses presence. Comes full circle late, with a resurgence of figgish tartness offset by a golden raisin like sweetness. Aftertaste of buttered, warm white cracker and marmalade. An eccentric and enjoyable brew.

3.92,6.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Nice transoucent amber color. Sprucey aroma. Nice balance in the taste. I think that Alskan Brewing should make this a year round beer. Not much in the line of a Winter Ale here, but a good beer nonetheless.","sinistersteve","Jan 05, 2003"
4.03,9.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I have to say that Alaskan Winter Ale is a rather unusual creature in relation to the typical "roasty and rich" seasonal ales. For that, I have to give the Alaskan Brewing Co. a big thumbs up for their imaginative efforts. It's a welcomed departure.","Zraly","Dec 14, 2002"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: A solid yet serene winter seasonal, the spicing of the hops and spruce are balanced at most ‚Ä¶ this holds the beer character to a sturdy strong or old ale fashion.","Jason","Nov 11, 2002"
4.32,17.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"When I saw the use of spruce tips on teh label I was expecting varnish.  Gave it a shot and LOVED it.  Nice amber color with a thin head.  A nice sweet flavor which goes down extremely smoothly.  The alcohol content doesn't harsh out the brew at all.  Can't wait for next year's.","beernut7","May 03, 2002"
3.53,-4.1,3.5,3,4,4,3,"Pours a bit syrupy.  Has very thin white head that goes away within seconds.  Don't get a lot on the aroma.  Maybe a small hint of spruce.  Appearance is slightly hazy and amber.  Taste is unique.  Spruce tips are used in this recipe and are evident on the tongue.  Pretty sweet (but not malty sweet) taste.  Alcoholic warmth is evident to a minor degree.  A good holiday brew, but not one to have many in one sitting.","Bighuge","Mar 20, 2002"
4.4,19.6,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"an excellent beer, but don't expect a thick rich brew...this is clean crisp malty/sweet ale with a very unique flavor due to the spruce tips (I'm guessing)  The spruce tips do not overwhelm but blend perfectly into this beer and add a touch you don't find elsewhere.  I love a good strong old ale, but this is outstanding in its own way.","ZAP","Feb 16, 2002"
3.7,0.5,3,3,4,4,4,"Light Golden in color, nice bitterness with a touch of spruce. A respectable seasonal beer. I like the fact that they do not feel compeled to do a storong ale or some spiced up brew for the holiday season. This and their stout are there two best brews IMHO.","mattmaples","Nov 03, 2001"
