"O: a big bold beer for sipping."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as good as i expected from Founders. A little thin, weak, and not rich enough for the style. I also get very little oak character. More like a fairly good barleywine to me. I will not seek this one out again"
""
""
""
"It's mahogany color, only issue in the appearance is the head, which is minimal and short lived. I like how the brewer used the oak's astringency coupled with the hops and alcohol. The Fact founder's only adds oak, not oak and bourbon is also nice because the oak only adds a note to the beer's overall profile, without dominating it. It's a good beer that's fairly unique."

"Had on tap at Founders"

""
"Pours honey color, great looking beer with nice lacing. Smell is dried fruit, molasses, alcohol, oak. Molasses and malt, sweet and smooth. Very nice sipper!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is a little bigger than this beer's appearance leads on.  And its nearly perfectly carbonated."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from tap at long wells nebr. Nice color with creamy white head. Oak barrel taste really comes out. Bitter bite at the end."
""
""
"A near perfect beer. Body was a little lighter than I expected it to be. Felt like it should have been a little richer in mouth feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy brownish red color with a small off white head and good carbonation.  The odor is sweet, candy like, malty, dark fruits, berry, plum, raisin, vanilla, dry wood, oak, rich, slightly floral.  The taste is woods, oak, dried fruits, plum, malty, sweet, spices, grapefruit.  Bitter dry throughout."
"Biscuity feel, very chewy, definite sense of the molasses and some dark fruit, has a scotch ale linger, with a oak aged flavor as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a beautiful honey color with thick, milky head and light lacing; a very attractive beer.  The smell is complex with fruit and spicy oakiness.  The initial taste is the molasses and malts but is quickly followed by a blast of bitterness.  Medium-bodied, pleasant mouth feel.  Overall, I really like this beer and stock up when it's released in the Spring."
""

""

""
""
""
""
"I bought a glass on tap at the Barrel Chest last weekend and loved it! I understand it may be here in the bottle soon, can't wait!"
""
""
""
"Smell is different than the taste.  Smells a bit odd and sour, with some spice. Yet taste is very malt forward and overwhelmingly sweet, with a bit of a spiciness.  Sweetness lingers on the finish.  No noticeable hop presence to balance it out.  Hard to finish as it is so sweet and strong.  WNBA."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of oak, dark fruits. Taste is oak, alcohol, dark fruits, malts, a light sweetness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very good winter beer.  I'm sorry to say I've been walking past this beer at my local liquor store."
"A beautiful crafted old ale"
""
""
"2013 vintage draft fill of a 32oz growler poured into goblets. Smell is Carmel and alcohol very pleasant tho. Look is a golden amber, lingering head. Beautiful beer. Taste is oaky, Carmely, and booze, it's great! It's a heavy beer at 9.8% abv. One of my favorite founders beers I've acquired to date."
""
"This was hands down one of the best beers I have ever had. It went down effortlessly. Beautiful colour, smell, but the taste blew it off of the charts. I have had most of Founders offerings, and I didn't think they could top the triple. They did, this was absolutely amazing!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Caramel and toffee notes predominant in the taste. Bit of a bitter, dry finish balances out the sweet malt."
"Overall a solid Old Ale. Are there better?  To me, yes but for something that's available as this and with its own distinct touch to it I could argue dollar for dollar this is it. Founders is a great brewery who makes above average beers. Some world class but almost all of them are solid within its category. This is one of them."

"Glass- Snifter"
""
""
""
"It was great value at €6 a pint but deceptively strong at 9.8%. Pity is is only ever in the pub for 5 days at most a year."
"Just not my thing. Weird tastes going on"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"V - Medium value, standard 4 pack Founder's pricing."
""
""
""
""
"O: I've yet to be disappointed by Founders. I wish this weren't seasonal! Nice balance and depth without being too heavy. Almost sessionable if it weren't for the ABV!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinks like a solid barleywine."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Good stuff. Lots of sweet flavors and a good dose of bitterness for balance. Really enjoyed how all the flavors and characteristics blended together to form a coherent whole on this one. Something I’d gladly drink again if I had the chance. Thanks again guys! Always appreciate the brews."
""
"It was good, but you definitely have to be in the mood for it."
""
"The smell on this was very nice.  Malts, whiskey, oak, sweet smelling molasses, and some dark fruits.  The taste somewhat followed the nose but in my opinion was a lot better.  It is definitely an old ale.  The strong ale hits you first followed by the oak/whiskey flavor but then fades quickly into a kind of sweet aftertaste.  I think the molasses helped balance it out.  This is not a sweet beer it is dry and kind of bitter but I thought the bitterness subsided as the beer warmed.  This is definitely a sipper beer with some good friends or some good old alone time.  I do not think it would be enjoyed with food.  Overall, I have purchased every bottle I have seen and can not wait to seek this out again in the spring.  I still have two bottles in my cellar from this year.  I was fortunate to drink more than my fair share this year!  Seek this out I can not see how you could be disappointed."

"355ml bottle. Pours an amber colour with a moderate densely packed, tan head. Excellent retention and good lace. Aroma of malt, caramel, raisins, oaky whisky. A lot going on in this one. A nice level of sweetness with some dry bitterness in the finish. Full body, soft carbonation, smooth yet sticky texture and soothing level of alcohol warmth. Grab a good novel, your smoking jacket and relax in comfy chair with this one."

"Very little if any hop bitterness, these are going to be good on cold winter nights. refreshing finish and not too syrupy."

"One of my favorites and I love that I could get it all summer this year. Thank you founders."
""
"Founders has come through yet again (surprise, surprise, right?). I've never had an old ale before this one and it tastes phenomenal. Very malt forward, (but not a malt bomb) with a heavy aroma of molasses and ginger snap cookies that carries through their taste and leaves a clean and heavy finish of malted molasses cookies. Love this"

"Would be interesting to compare to a bottle fresh."
""

"Pours a dark caramel color, kind of like maple syrup. Which makes sense because it is brewed with maple. You can smell it and taste it. Great complexity and smooth tasting for such a high abv."

"Lots of malty goodness with a hint of molasses. Very nice wood notes at the end from the oak aging! 9.8 Abv what's not to love?  :)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Begins sweet, with bready hints, which get swallowed by even sweeter sugar and molasse. These stay in balance with wooden, leathery, heavy malts, wrapped up by a slick bitterness. Has an oily, spicy maltiness to it, with vanilla and cream underneath, which defines the character of this brew. It is still pretty sweet on the palate, but without loosing its balance, as it finishes with a gentle, hoppy bitterness of matured hops and oaky hints. The alcohol gets perfectly hidden by the sweet malts, creating a smooth mouthfeel with a slick finish, while being medium-bodied."

"O: More thick and syrupy than I like, and reminds me of a barley wine which I am no fan of.  Well done, but in my opinion not the best Old Ale out there, a little thick and overly sweet.  Even so, has some good old ale qualities of maltiness, light colour, etc.   Drank on June 14, 2014."
"I'm a big fan of Founders but I gotta call it like it is. This brew just isn't that great. It would be one thing if suffering through the harsh mouthfeel and weird aftertaste led to something great, but this beer is pretty one-dimensional."

"Overall: Makes for an excellent sipping beer, and reminds me of a Belgian Dubbel without that distinct Belgian yeast character. My first experience with the style, but I will definitely seek out more to try. I could see this pairing very well with a sweet, creamy cheese like brie, or with anything gingerbread to bring out the molasses flavors in both."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of those beers that you can't help but look at the bottle after your first sip. It isn't as solid as North Coast old stock ale but it sure is a more than suitable alternative. Very much recommended!"
""
"Tried this at a tasting in Amherst WI. I thought it was pretty good. My mom, who’s not much of a craft beer drinker, really liked it. She must have gone back for 5 or 6 glasses of it. Of course now I see that it is almost 10% ABV so I understand why she was acting a little loopy."

"O - Very enjoyable beer.  Fairly complex with flavors standing out nicely.  Some nice minor flavor undertones that make for a very nice drinking experience.  4.25/5"
""
"Overall, an interesting beer - actually my first 'old ale'.  It is a butt kicker in the buzz department - go easy!  I enjoyed this and would probably try again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As other have mentioned the carbonation level is surprising low, the best thing I can compare its level to is that of a firkin aged beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A potent, full-bodied, creamy sipper for finishing things off (whatever those things may be) on the right note."
"O-This is a very solid old ale. The smell is plain, but the taste is more complex and provides more depth thanks to the more assertive hop flavors and kick of alcohol spice. The sweetness levels are high here, so I don't think I could drink a lot of this, but it makes for a fine dessert-type beer."
"Pours out a deep reddish caramel with a thin ring of bubbles around the top of the beer. Smells strongly of brown sugar and dried fruits. Lots of fig and date. Flavor is big on brown sugar, dried fruits, cinnamon, vanilla, with a touch of coffee. Carbonation is soft. Body is full. This is delicious and very British."

"This is the only ""old ale"" I've ever tried, but as far as I can tell, it's pretty similar to a Scottish ale. If you like sweet, malt-forward beers, this should be enjoyable. That happens to be a little skewed for my tastes, but it's still another engaging offering from Founders nonetheless. I'd be curious to try it with a year or two of age under its belt."

"Overall this fits the Old Ale style of brew with the big alcohol bite up front and the big flavors as well. A little mis-cast in the spring release mode but tasty nonetheless."
"O: Good, not great but certainly worth a drink. And with its mass availability its probably something I will visit a couple times a year."

"BOD 4/13/12. Similar head, but hazy with flocculants. The nose is similar, but quite subdued. Bourbon is the most prevalent while the dark fruits have receded. Same body and carbonation. Like the nose, flavors have also gone downhill. Age has decomplexed the flavor profile. While still outstanding, it just doesn't reach out and grab you. Everything is there, but in a subdued fashion and more of a blended presentation rather than a progression on the palate. On it's own, I would give the aged version a 4.1."

"A beer that I really enjoyed and one that I'm glad I let sit for a while before opening up. Despite the strength of the beer it was one that went down pretty well with a great balance between flavours & I could see this being one that I would pick up again in future, assuming of course I can find it easily enough."
""
"Despite the age and flatness, this is a pretty damn tasty beer! I can imagine what it's like when it's on and dialed in. I may not be particularly impressed this time around, but I'm impressed enough that I will certainly try it again."

""
""

"Cheers!"

"Overall this beer rocks just another solid offering by Founders. I can see myself seeking this out again. I was really impressed by the colors of this brew - awesome"
""
"Nice mahogany brown color with a moderate haze. A very faint trace of foam is only present around the rim of the glass. A faint bit of Brussels malt is present. Strong aroma of light malt is present to the point of a gentle sweetness. The taste is an assault of light malt with a strong sweet component. There's a thick,sticky mouthfeel. If you like plenty of malt,this is up your alley."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall, one of my favorite beers from Founder's, or any beer period. It's a great dessert beer for when you don't want a BA stout - it treads the same waters, but is much less heavy. It kind of reminds me of what a super-easy-drinking bourbon would be like, with the caramel, oakiness, and robust alcohol presence. Such an incredible beer!!"
""
"O - some might knock it because of its lack of complexity....but that is exactly what I like about it. A sweet ale that tastes better as it warms to room temp... I'm sold"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"05/19/14 From bottle. As I'm on a barrel aged kick lately, no stone shall go unturned. Here is a fine example of how pervasive oaking can be..until, of course it meets something just as persuasive as the molasses used here. Not a lot on the nose & no head to speak of so that leaves the battle on the tongue between the oak & the treacle. Each as it's moment but neither comes out a winner. I enjoyed it but could not get past the novelty effect. I suspect a draft portion...or better yet, a nitro pour could lift this to another level."

"Liked this from the bottle; love this on tap (Holy Hound Taproom, York PA into snifter).  Pours a gorgeous clear, deep amber with a modest light tan head.  Rich, full-bodied, sweet, chewy but not syrupy - a little bitterness but predominantly molasses.  Alcohol definitely makes its presence known, but complements the flavors rather than detracting from them.  Nice sweet aftertaste.  One of my top ten beers of ANY style."

"A fantastic old ale. The appearance was very dark brown with a sticky head that lasted quite a while during drinking. The smell had a lot of wood and malt in it. The taste was great with a lot of the wood giving a very mellow flavor which then opened up to a very nutty flavor which I thought was a nice finish to the beer. The mouthfeel was a bit thin, but overall I absolutely loved the beer and would highly recommend."

""

""
""
""
"I believe this beer is kind of over-rated . Not what i expected."
""
""
""
"As it warms there's an aroma of toffee, candied orange, a hint of tobacco and leather, and hop aroma. It’s died down after 2 years but there's still a bit of a pronounced bitterness on the palate. I taste candied orange, tobacco, malty caramel and toffee, and a hint of something nutty on the finish. Tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was just OK. I was hoping for more, but it was missing something. Can’t quite put my finger on what."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this one is still way too hot, I'll be putting away the other bottles I have for at least a year or two and revisit. But for the time being, the flavors just haven't meshed yet"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty delicious; wish I had more than just this one 12oz bottle. I can imagine it pairing well with a blue cheese burger and steak fries. Hmm... that sounds good. Anyone up for a burger joint?"
"Great picture on the bottle that conveys the classic taste if an old ale with molasses."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This could have been a really great one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Wouldn't recommend. So bland. Except high ABV which is benefit for NASCAR redneck fans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- wow, oak. It's a pretty good beer. I could do with a little less oak though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Odd. This beer is a very dark ruby red. It looks like burnt sugar. There is almost no carbonation at all. It smells like old wood, probably aged in barrels, and like wine and fruits. Taste not like a beer in the traditional sense. Very flat and without fizz. It feels like drinking a fortified wine. Interesting to say the least. If Old Ale was not on the description, I would have dismissed it."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice beautiful reddish amber with a nice head that quickly dissipates. Not much aroma. First sip is not much sweetness but you can definitely taste the oak barrel and finishes with a strong alcohol kick. Was looking for more maple goodness. As you drink more and the beer warms up, the maple and molasses start to come through. A very nice beer. Starts becoming like a fine cognac. Be careful as that almost 10% will kick you real quick."

"The taste is what makes it all worthwhile as the molasses and caramel malts are voracious in their presentation with only a vague alcohol burn. You would get more booze in a malt liquor. Mildly bitter finish. Wonderfully drinkable for what it is."
"O- Not a huge fan of the style but I liked this one. A sipper for sure. Nicely done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a decent showing here by the (OLD) curmudgeon. May he age with the best of them."
""
"Nice beer. Maybe a little more boozy than I would have wanted."
""
"Overall, this is a very nice beer -- fun to drink as there's a lot going on in it (it's oak aged and contains molasses). It has a good balance between the sweetness and the hops. It's a good dessert beer, but would probably pair well with the right foods."
""
"Overall, an excellent Old Ale. The mouth feel transitions well to the taste, which is nicely rounded out by the finish. I would have preferred a stronger aroma. However, with warming, the aroma has a pronounced oak."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a ruby brown with a slight creamy white head. No retention, almost not lacing. The aroma has a nice oak pungency with hints of molasses. The taste is awesome, with the ale flavors (caramel, dark fruit) in the forefront with just a hint of the oak providing a nice counter. There is a nice weight to the beer (my preference would have been a little thicker) and a pleasant silky feel to it. A great barrel-aged ale."
""
""
"Overall - This is a terrific homage to this style, a sweet molasses/cream/caramel/candy/cherry delight."

"The beer pours a light brownish creamy head that dissipates very quickly and the head was not very frothy to begin with. The beer itself is a clear dark color with hints of ruby. The beer leaves quite a bit of lacing. The smell is very sweet and a little bit tarty. The strong notes are caramel with mix of molasses and oak with a bit of a cherry smell. The oak is weakest of the notes but still works very well giving that nice harsh non-sweet note at the end of a very sweet bouquet. The smell also contains lightly roasted malt notes that add a bit of a cereal smell without compromising the rest of the beer. The beer taste is similar to the smell with a few exceptions. The oak note is stronger and dulls the caramel and fruity sweetness. No roasted malt notes. The molasses note is weaker in the taste and adds a nice tarty note at the end. The taste also has an overall cherry note to it. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied and a little a bit thick. While overall smooth, the beer feels like it's going down a little slower. Biting carbonation. Overall, a pretty good old ale and worth getting when you can."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice sipper. The cherries overwhelmed just a bit on the finish, but overall, a terrific old ale. The Old Stock we had right before still blew this one away."
""
""
""
"O-  vastly exceeded my expectation."
""
""
"Overall - An excellent old ale, great balance and complexity, flavors are bold and distinct and all complimentary, nearly a perfect symphony, a pleasant warming alcohol heat after each sip. I've aged this one for 2 years before opening and it is silky smooth - fantastic!"
""
""
"Pours with a huge light tan head that settles into a very high density, the beer is very clear and a nice bare color, nice head retention. Amber malt, nuttiness, pretty faint under that head Light malt sweetness, has an alcohol warmth to it, bread, some spice, caramel, hints of grain Palate: soft carbonation, very heavy and thick mouthfeel, alcohol on the aftertaste. The taste hides the ABV very well and you can tell it is well made when you drink it due to the seriousness of the beer."

"I can intellectualize the quality of good old ales. But I think I just don't like them. This one definitely carries a much less offensive combo of cardboard and leather I've seen in others, like North Coast Old Stock or Anchor Old Foghorn (wait, that's an English barley wine). I actually love Bell's Old Ale, so, what're ya gonna do?"

"o - another fine offering from Founders! I'm hoping aging will mellow the hot alcohol flavors...they definitely have a ""headache"" flavor. I hope it relaxes into the body in a few months."
""

"Overall, an incredibly tasty choice for those who dig a big, bold, malty, sweet beer. It may not be something that I'd personally drink very often (I'm already a ""ticker"" as it is...), but there is absolutely no denying that this is a phenomenal beer that warrants a try to any beer aficionado. I may go buy myself another single just to see how this thing ages. It is sweet as hell, but it is equally as tasty."

"O: Conforming to all my other experiences with Founders beers, this was incredible. I rarely drink old ales, I know this is not my first but I can't remember my last but this one will always stick with me. Expensive yet it's nose and mouth candy, got to have this one."

"ale with good medium fruity sweet sugary notes and definitely oaky notes. hints of cinnamon and nutmeg spice. hint of an apple or some lighter fruit. pretty complex and drinkable, not overly sweet. well balanced and just really nice, well rounded beer, not much hop presence"

"I didn't expect to see this want of mine on the bottom shelf of a random store in Australia. If I didn't need to fly across the Pacific I might have grabbed a few to sit on."
""
"Smells sweet, malty, and rustic/earthy (the good parts of Earth). Taste sweet, malty, and a little musty. Dont get a bunch of the oak. It also comes across a little hot on the alcohol side. I know it is a strong beer, but it doesnt hide that fact well. I really think it could improve over time. If not, maybe dial it back a bit on the ABV. The alcohol is  suppressing some of the flavors. It is still a very good beer that will kick you in the ass and warm you up on a cold rainy day."

"bored with very little leasing slightly amber and cloudy notes smell is lately muted in glass with hints of cinnamon brown sugar and bread some tropical notes are found. Overall it is a white tropical compared to the aged old curmudgeon that I sat on for 2 years ahead papaya and mango now it's definitely better in the bottle but worth a try."

"Still a 4, based on my previous rating... but with some notes. Poured a deep, transluscent amber, virtually no head, noticeable carbonation. Molasses, raisins, some wood, and a bit of booze on the nose. Really came together in the taste department. Dark fruit, oak, super clean and smooth, not overly sweet/molasses, etc., overall a really nice balance. The bitterness cuts in nicely without being overpowering. Medium body, covered the palate nicely, and had a really smooth finish. Just a strong example of a sipper that will put you in a luxurious state of mind. Get some."

"Dark brown in appearance with some light getting in around the edges. Less than a finger of head even with a vigorous pour, and it fades rather quickly. The nose is rather imposing with molasses, sweet malt, burnt sugar, coconut, toasted oats, and oak. The same profile comes out in the taste along with some raisin and fruity esters. It's reminiscent of a Belgian dubbel but overly boozy. Not much of a hop presence here: this is all malt. Carbonation is low and the body is medium."

"O- A very easy drinking high ABV old ale that has incredible balance but keeps me interested all the way to the last sip."
""
"Pours a murky copper color with a very weak head. Has a malty aroma, with light hints of fruit. Feels heavy like molasses, and has a lightly sweet molasses and malty flavor. There is a hint of bitterness at the end to offset the subtle sweetness. Very enjoyable, complex ale."
"Overall: I opened this one a bit before the two year mark since I’ve heard it does not age very well. However, this is drinking quite fine at the moment and I think it could keep progressing. Lots of nice sweet maltyness, floral alcohol and a surprising hop bite. Recommend stock for your cellar."

"Aroma was a boozy, sweet caramel. Poured headless , cloudy ruddy body. Holding to light shows floating particulates. Taste is alcoholic and bitter/acidic. Overall : Nasty!"
"For me the drinkability of this old ale is what sets it apart from the crowd. These go down way too easy for me. I am usually a stout sipper but sometimes I just want to get drunk. When I am in that kind of mood this is my go to beer. Served just above freezing, these provide me with a great tasting malty beer that gets the job done quick. For me the best tasting most complex beer I can drink in large quantities."

"Beer's body is medium-heavy, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a lightly foamy (1/4), mostly smooth (3/4) mouthfeel that is appropriate for sipping a beer of this style. Unfortunately, ethanol is easily felt as heat in the nostrils and across the palate, and as a burning sensation on the throat. Though ""only"" 9.8% ABV, this feels like a much stronger beer; ethanol not well-hidden. Closes dry, with heavy stickiness lingering on the palate and lips."

"O: Good drinkability. Classic English Old Ale. Just another masterpiece brewed by Founders"
""
""
""
""
"Man, this is Founders' malt brilliance at full form here. I really wish I had tried the maple bourbon barrel aged version of this some years back. This is an excellent take on the old ale style, and it seems to only get better with age. A sipper, no doubt, but I should have had a damn cigar for this occasion. Absolutely, as with all of this brewery's malt forward beers, completely recommended."

"Overall a solid beer that can be enjoyed by all types of beer lovers. Molasses adds some sweetness to counteract the bold malt flavor while oak comes in to mellow it all out."
""
""
""
""
"I've come a long way and looking at the other reviews I thought I give this guy another go and it pours a reddish copper hue with a creamy one finger head,the smell is quite sweet it's molasses,honey,oak and hidden underneath there is a piney hop bitterness,the mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation and could use just a touch more I feel and on taste it's definitely an old ale with hints of molasses,caramel,bitter old hops,a residing pine bitterness and finished with nice hit of oak that is quite subdued and works well and overall it's one of those beers that's nice but not something ill come back and revisit like breakfast stout or all day IPA cheers."

"Notes: Review on 5/2/14. Bottled 4/19/12. Overall this aged pretty well. I think it has a very slight edge over fresh. The flavors mellowed out a bit, the oaky flavors dropped off a bit. It seems like it is in a good balance with the sweetness, the woodiness, and the alcohol right now. Overall this is a great example of the style. Not overpowering wood aspects but it provides a nice extra note. Molasses on the other hand really comes out. Good fresh and aged and worth picking up and stashing a few away."

"Very interesting to say the least I think this has been one of the more complex beers that I've tasted"

"I bought a few 4 packs of this several years and wasn't too impressed, but I held on to them, and am I glad I did! Several months ago I opened up a 2011 and was very happy I did. I actually had to fish the bottle out of the trash to make sure it was the beer I thought I had just opened. Fortunately it was still readily available on the shelves so I picked up a few more, knowing I'd then be able to enjoy them in a few years!"
"O-My first Old Ale and I am pleasantly surprised. A lot like a BDA but with a nice oaked nuance. Well balanced on all aspects. Founders did it again."

"3-4 year old bottle, not much head or lacing. Muddy, tudor brown body. Aroma includes brown sugar, raisin, date, vanilla. Taste includes all of these flavors and a slight hint of alcohol heat. Delicious in every way, one of the best old ales I've had."
"Reddish orange color. Smells sweet with a bit of hop. Definitely different than an English style old ale, but very good. Taste is surprisingly bitter. Ends up being like a barelywine. Very good taste. Just not what I expected from my experience drinking English style old ales. Mouthfeel is fantastic. The carbonation is really where this beer shines. It gives it a creamy and viscous feel. Overall it's good!"

"Overall, good, though not great. The molasses is a bit strong for my liking."
"The flavor has a good amount of malty sweetness, with caramel, toffee and molasses quite noticeable. You can also get a taste of what the wood contributes here, too. I also get intimations of rum-soaked brown-bread. There is earthy hoppiness here as well, while the finish exhibits some alcoholic heat. Pretty good, in small doses! Prosit!"

"O: Better than some of the other Old Ales I've had. I like the lack of sweetness in the taste of Carmudgeon. Old Ales tend to be very sweet for me, but this one had a nice balance to it. Normally, I'd be one and done with an Old Ale, but I could see myself wanting a couple of these in a session."
""

""
"O: a very good beer. solid complexity and good flavors without any noticeable flaws"
""
"Taste-Oakey spiciness, sweet malt, molasses, maple syrup. Dose of underlying hops keeps things from getting too sweet. Very drinkable for the strength. Warms as it warms. Sip this one slowly and enjoy!"
""
"Overall, I like this beer quite a bit, but only in smaller doses due to the booziness. I know very little about the style, this being my first one, but going by the description for ""Old Ale"" on BA, Curmudgeon is a prototypical example."

"Very full, rich flavor of grape, chocolatey malt, caramel, wine, cognac and prune. Hints of molasses, oak and malt hold the backbone but the alcohol rich flavors of fermented or distilled grapes overtakes. Slight warmth in the chest does not deter but defines a wonderful winter warmer/fireplace sipping ale."

"Overall, definitely different than most beers. Reminds me of Samiclaus Helles, which in my craft beer infancy was my favorite. just so incredibly heavy, it's overbearing. tastes like it will go well with a cigar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth and rich. Full bodied with a medium-light effervescence. This old ale is unlike most in that it doesn't need to warm to be great, it starts there. Warming does make it a touch smoother but not enough to make you want to wait. A truly great brew."

"O-nice sipping old ale, smooth and well- balanced"

"Poured into a snifter from the bottle, the ale poured a golden copper color with a 1/2 inch head. As the head receded, it left a lacing along the sides of the glass. The aroma was malty with a spiciness that tickles the insides of the nose. On can even detect a faint hint of vanilla from the oak. In the initial taste, one gets the burn of spicy cinnamon, caramel, dark fruits, mild vanilla, and of course the malts. The malts bring to mind a well constructed dark bread. In the aftertaste, the spicy alcohol meshes with the dark malts to make this ale come full circle. The thickness allows the malt and alcohol to linger. With time, this old ale will mature and reward its owned. The rest of this 4 pack is going to the cellar to sleep"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Copper body with yellow-white lace. Enticing smells of oak, vanilla, toffee, and chocolate pudding. Taste is a let down. Reminds me of cheap bourbon: woody, stale, and soapy. Possibly the 'chewiest' beer I've ever had with a metallic twitch at the end."
"Overall: Repeat what I stated above, unique and highly enjoyable, might be the best Old Ale I've ever tried. Another excellent offering from Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I kept thinking I had to come back to this one, but for one reason or another (the bad original four pack most likely) I did not. Without the semi turned smell, it makes for a much better experience. This 4 pack was from Frougles. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This aged well, one of my favorites of the style, its got everything im looking for. It mellowed and allowed more complexity to show with some age. An awesome sipper"
""
""
"O - This is a nice beer. Definetly a slow sipper. Another winner from Founders."
""
"Overall: I found this beer pretty tasty and quite easy to drink for the style and for the alcohol content. Not something I would be interested in buying a four pack of but something I could see myself getting yearly as a single."

"So what goes well with this beer? Well maybe the music curmudgeon of all time. That is right. jazz saxophone player son of a bitch Phil 'fuck you' Woods. I recommend an illegal download of his ""Live at the Showboat"" or a good version of his version of the tune 'Freedom Jazz Dance' from the lp ""Swiss Radio Days Jazz Series"""

"O- This is a great blend of sweet syrupy malt and bitter hops encompassed by oak."
"O: Good beer. It's definitely not for the faint of heart. This is a big beer, with lots of flavor and a lot of alcohol. Even one bottle is a bit much. That being said, it has a lot of good flavor, and is quite drinkable."

"Held onto this bad boy for a little too long - we're getting Founders next month here in Florida and this guy will be a bit less special. Curmudgeon pours a hazy red-orange with tons of sediment. It has a rather attractive glow though. The aroma is muted, presenting sweet toffee, oak, and honey. The taste hits with an intense sweet oak right away, along with a big sweet malt and honey presence. Sweet is the name of the game here. Surprisingly for all the sweet flavors, the aftertaste is very clean. The mouthfeel is relatively light, with a high level of carbonation for the style. The drinkability is good - probably better if you can down sweet beers quickly. Overall, Curmudgeon is a good example of a style that's never been my favorite."
""
""
""
""
"Reddish brown; quick head. Nose is strong, caramel roasted malt, rich. Taste is on target, big malts, and sweetness. I like it. Has a barley wine taste. Lots of sediment in this bottle. It does hide the 9.8 % abv very well; not a bad aftertaste either. Solid beer, I'd drink this beer again."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 4/6/2012. Pours fairly cloudy red-orange color with a small dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, oak, biscuit, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with great complexity and balance of malt notes with light-moderate oak character that does not overwhelm. Taste of raisin, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, biscuit, nuttiness, oak, light chocolate, light clove, floral, and toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, toffee, biscuit, molasses, oak, nuttiness, light chocolate, and light earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of malt notes with moderate oak presence; with a fair amount of hop balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible old ale! Awesome complexity and balance of malt flavor with moderate oak presence; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
"O - A very nice brew, that certainly lives up to the description of an ""old ale brewed with molasses and oak aged."" The old ale characteristics, molasses flavors and oak presence are all there in a nice harmonized way. I'd be interested to see how this develops with age."

""
""
""
""
"O: I'm going to have to hide the other 3 bottles before I drink them warm. This was a great beer, highly complex with the addition of the oak. I'm disappointed that I let this one slip into the fold when I was the the NYC craft beerfest a couple weeks ago and instead focused solely on the KBS so much so that the server knew my name. This beer is an understated powerhouse."

"Single 12-ounce bottle bought from Capone's in Norristown, PA. Darkish, caramel, syrupy appearance, almost like a scotch ale married a red ale. Off-white, khaki head. Very malty and I was getting a very pungent aroma of, shall I say, an illegal substance? It smelled like I was at a Who concert. Dark, molasses, syrupy taste. A malt bomb with a boozy backbone. Hint of tobacco taste. Heavy and captures the ""old, foggy, pier"" feeling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not overly impressed with this ale. However, it is VERY drinkable. Founder's has somehow managed to hide 9.8% ABV without a trace. This beer is not for the ""hoppy connoisseur"". You need a sweet appreciative palate to drink this. I have that. This is a great warm weather brew that distinguishes itself from the ""refreshing"" crowd that usually features citris notes. I want to age a few bottles, and see what I get. If I found this stuff on tap one day, I'd be forced to have at least one."

""
""

""
"A- 3.75 / S- 3.5 / T- 3.5 / M- 3.5 / O- 3.5"
"Final Thoughts: I couldn't detect any molasses in the flavor, but Curmudgeon Old Ale is pretty much as advertised. If you like Old Ales and Barleywines but don't want the big bitterness that goes along with them then I'd recommend it. The oak-aging has really smoothed out the hops and given an interesting mix of flavors. Would I drink it again? Unlikely, too many other beers to try at this point."
"O: While I'm not as well-versed in old ales, this one is a particularly drinkable one with wonderful flavors of molasses and oak."

"O - Overall a nice old ale with an added oak treatment that just adds the icing on the cake as far as complexity goes and it just gets better as it warms in the glass. A perfect lingering winter/spring evening sipper."
""
"O: This one tastes a little different with every drink. Great complexity, but not all over the place. The balance of sweet, but not being overly sweet with some bitterness and the oak character was done really well. Glad I have a couple to age as well - I'm interested to see what happens with some age."
""
""
""
"Overall: In every way a solid brew. No glaring weaknesses. One of the first brews I had when I was starting up and still impresses me. I also had the opportunity to enjoy of growler of this and that was an eventful night. A bit pricey overall but more then worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
"It reminds me of a toned down Stone Double Bastard. It's quite smooth. I think I prefer the Double Bastard because of its hoppiness and complexity, but this is still quite wonderful."

"Spend a lot of time enjoying this one."

"Overall- a great beer, similar to a Barleywine. Booze is well hidden here. For $16 a four pack, I can’t say I would buy more than one a year but its a nice pick up."
""
""
""
""
"a ""chunky"" amber pour.. lots of floating sediment, slight white rim of head. smells almost like a barley wine, very sweet malty profile, caramel, plum, vanilla. smells pretty boozy. tastes much like a very strong barley wine mixed with some scotch. not sure if this is bourbon barrel aged or what, but it definitely tastes that way.. bourbon, oak, vanilla, tons of barley, caramel, banana, plum, raisins. a full bodied ale with some, but not a whole lot of carbonation. very heavy, boozy, thick and rich beers like this are perfect for just sitting back, relaxing, and sipping on. this is a great beer and i'm glad i let it sit for a while."
""
"This is a tasty beer, rich and full of flavour. Pretty sweet like a brandy liqueur."
""
""
""
"a really brilliant example of the style, and the time on oak really brings this to life. pours sort of a hazy burnt caramel color, and boasts a nice lathery off white head with outstanding retention. it smells extremely sweet, molasses and cane sugar, and a lot of alcohol. smells a lot like en English barleywine actually, with a similar malt profile. the flavor though is what makes this special. while it is intensely sweet, there is a lot more to it. there is some bready malt that reminds me of teacakes, there is a butterscotch character that coupled with the oak is simply sensational, and the alcohol, while strong, is also sort of inviting, its warming and friendly, easy up easy down, and that's hard to accomplish I think. very woody in the finish, and again very sweet. relaxed carbonation is ample, and the body is colossal. its not something I would drink everyday, that's for sure, but its a heck of a beer, really well built, and guilty of getting me pleasantly drunker than I anticipated. founders always rocks, and this old ale is true to form."

"Quite a malt bomb. I wasn't expecting to really enjoy this beer as much as I did. Leaps and bounds better than old stock ale. Should age nicely."
""
""
""
"Overall this one is another good offering from Founders. You never know what to expect from Old Ales as they are all so different, but this one is a winner."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 16 oz snifter, bottled on 2/15/13. Pours a beautiful deep amber with a two inch off white head, that leaves webs of lace. Smell is vanilla, dark fruit, brown sugar, bready, and apple. Taste is all of that with vanilla and brown sugar starting the party, with some figgy dark fruit in the finish. Body is medium large, nice amount of carbonation, maybe s little dry, and nice drinkability. I am more of hop forward drinker, but this is really solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear deep amber orange color with a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly to wisps of foam on the surface. The aroma is sugary and malty with a clear bit of ethanol. Brown and caramelized sugars among dark pitted fruit and a solid hit of alcohol with little to no hop nose. The flavor is sweet with the rich dark sugars that were present in the nose. Added bonus is rich milk chocolate melded with dark fruits and again tempered with a hit of ethanol. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Good beer, I could drink it, but I was expecting a bit more from Founders, this one didn't wow me."
"Overall: A great beer. taste good fresh but improves with age. a good one to find on the shelves every year and to buy a few and drink what you can and cellar the rest."
""

""
"A solid old ale example, but could be a little more complex with the scotch flavors. Would also have liked a little bit more body, and to taste the booze a little bit..."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: In Michigan, Founders is extremely common, and the Grand Rapids brewery essentially shares the Michigan crown with Bells (out of Kalamazoo). I will seek Curm out in the future. I was impressed by the taste, considering my enjoyment of Fat Tire and other oakey beers. Look out for this beer, and please pick it up if you have the opportunity."

"Overall: Holy crap what a great beer. Founders is one of my favorite breweries, especially as of late. This beer proves again why I freakin' love this brewery."
"Overall - This is a pretty good beer. Nothing you need to run out and buy right now, but I woud recommend giving it a try while it is out. This beer isn't as good as most of Founders year-long lineup, but it is unique and worth a try. Give this a shot next chance you get."
"I liked it, I will continue to by a couple of 4 packs every year, It may not be the most flashy beer out there but it is damn good none the less!"
""
""

"O-This is just a nice beer on a cold day. It is what it is. Not my style, but would like this to just sip on in front of the fireplace. Will come back to this beer for more in depth review."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste starts out sweet with caramel and toffee, hops are fairly muted but not entirely absent, bit of a bitter musty aftertaste, alcohol is very well hidden which is surprising considering it's a fresh batch and not aged, good body with a creamy finish."
""
""
""
"Very surprising. Lots of toffee and brown sugar sweetness both in the nose and taste. Hints of dried fruit as well (raisins and fig). Appearance is deep brown to red in color with a thin head that settles slowly. The alcohol is not overpowering but is present in the flavor. Smooth mouth-feel. Could drink this all day if the ABV was lower."
""
""
""
"O- Overall curmudgeon a enjoyable beer, as the beer warms up alot more complexities can be found throughout, and i am going to assume (and find out) that it will open up alot more with some age, its aggressively on the sweet side, so ill let a few of these sit in the cellar and mellow out."

"O. Not one of Founders better efforts."

"Overall it's a really good old ale. I would definitely try this one on draft but there are other favorites out there I prefere more."
""
"Reddish brown, unfiltered with a light cream cap. Light lace and almost no retention. Nose of syrup, candy, caramel, sweet dark fruits and fantastic bready malt notes. Palate more syrup, honey, breads, light toastiness, slight booze and caramel again. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel - 'coating.' A fantastic beer all around, I'd revisit this time and time again."
""
"O: sip this like you would brandy, it's sweet heavy and complicated"

"O: I really enjoyed this one. It was complex and very well integrated and balance. Very easy to drink, glad I have one more. Thanks again Jay!"

"O: A very nice old ale - one of the better one's I've had; on the same level as Bell's Third Coast old ale; really good stuff."
"O - An interesting beer and my first old ale, great show for the style. Nice flavor and aroma profile. The alcohol isn't harsh but shows through enough to warn you that this beer means business. A great beer to sip through the night."
""
""
""
"O- A real sipper here, to enjoy it ya got to take it slow, or that high ABV will put ya down quick! This is not a ""first beer or the night"" beer, definitely last one of the night to enjoy it. Really picking up on the molasses in it too. I put couple of these in the cellar to see what happens, they are already 9 months old so not sure how much longer to keep them or that I can wait."

"Appearance was a very hazy, dark orange. No appreciable head, and what there was vanished quickly. Aroma was sweet, slight alcohol, raisin date fruit notes, some breadiness, some caramel, whiff of vanilla. Immediate taste was bitterness with some acidity underneath, then sweetness. Malty, caramel, maybe fig, sweet grapes, maple syrup notes, and more vanilla than the nose. Sweetness builds, vanilla and maple notes linger. Soft and smooth on the palate, not too carbonated, some tingle from the alcohol. Some syrupy sticky sweetness stays on. Overall, warming and fun to drink. A lot going on, but seems well blended. As it warmed, cleared and had many tiny bubbles. Also became very brandy like in character. Liking this a lot."
""
""
" This was my first beer from Founders and I am impressed , I will be purchasing more from them now that the state line liquor store in Missouri is carrying Founders"
""
""
""
"Overall, the best old ale that I've tried. It's an underapprecited and under brewed class of beer in my opinion. This is perhaps the top of the class when it comes to old ales, and definitely worth having around when you want a break for a hoppy beer."
""
""
""
"A beer that does not give bang for the buck. Overpriced single."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good beer overall. Tons of different flavors going on and they all work together well."
""
""
""
"Slightly hazed burnt orange color with a low dark beige frothy head that settles quickly. Rich aroma of caramel, ripe fruit, citrus, vanilla and cotton candy. Rich flavor that mirrors the nose, some alcohol sweetness and warmth, bourbonesque notes, rich caramel, hints of smoke, stone fruits, and cotton candy. Semi-full mouthfeel, slight warming of the cheeks. Great beer."
"O - A decent old ale. A nice sipper, but not my favorite style. Definitely worth a try. Relax and enjoy on a cold evening!"
"Overall: This was so much better than I thought it was going to be. In the meantime, Founders is simultaneously laughing and making better beer."
""
""
"O: I was expecting a lot more depth from a vintage version of this--maybe I need to have it fresher. Not bad, but not worth the price tag."
""
""
""
"I was really impressed with this brew. It's a super smooth, highly drinkable, complex old ale. As always, founders really nailed this one."

"O - This is probably my least favorite beer from Founders, in yet I still enjoy it. I just wish it was slightly less boozy in the aftertaste. I will age some more of this for another year and see if the alcohol dies off. Could be an awesome beer with a couple of years on it, we shall see. Cheers!"

"This is a nice, malty beer that is very enjoyable. The malts are very nicely balanced and the bitterness is more like a coffee-like bitterness rather than hop-like. My only disappointment is that the sweetness from the nose didn't follow in the taste. Honestly, that's only because I have a fondness for cake batter sweetness in beers. Ultimately, this is an enjoyable, drinkable beer with a nice flavor profile. It's well worth a try."
"O- Another great seasonal beer from Founders. A good cellar beer to stock up and age if you have the patience."
""
""
"This beer is close to being really good, but it's lacking the punch, the depth, the pronounced flavors that I was hoping for. Not bad, but for a big malty beer (which I tend to love), it didn't wow me."

"Curmudgeon Old Ale pours an opaque amber, with some scattered straight orange highlights. A bit more than a finger of bone colored foam caps the beer. Head retention is alright, and there's just a little lacing left behind. Caramel, oak, and biscuity aromas all leap out of the glass towards my nose, with none dominating above the others. There's a prominent note of very caramelized brown sugar in the flavor profile. Waves of toffee, toasty bread, vanilla, and oak fall in to create a very layered flavor profile. The body is full, though not quite chewy, and well short of cloying. The carbonation is on the muted side, completing the picture for a solid malt forward mouthfeel. Curmudgeon is just another entry in Founders' impressive stable of malt forwars beers."
""
"O: great beer for the cooler days"
""
"O: This is a very good old ale style beer. It is bold and smooth. The sweet malt and roasted grain flavor was very strong and soften just enough by the mild hops. This is a good, basic, straight-forward old ale; and, it is this bold simplicity that makes this beer so appealing to a fan of the old ale style. Also, for almost 10% ABV the alcohol is very well hidden. It is a smooth and easy drinking beer. So be careful, and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was pretty good. Not much on the nose, but really quite a complex flavor profile ranging from warm to sweet to spicy to bitter. Not something I'd drink more than one of, but definitely worthy of trying."
""
""
"O - Overall I thought this beer was unique, pretty odd, but I would like to try this again and delve into some of those funky notes."

"Overall: I was expecting something maybe closer to a toned down barley wine based on the Wyeast descriptions of"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like it and I will buy it again. This one is a sipper, and it tastes better as the beer warms (maybe that's just the 9.8% alcohol affecting my judgement). I would suggest pairing this with a rum cake, or maybe a raisin or maple pudding would work also."
""
"Overall - More of a wee-heavy than a old ale. It tastes better than it smells and the mouthfeel needs a little boost of carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden and the aftertaste is the highlight for me. Not sure I'd have again with all of the great beers out there to choose from."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I drainpour this every time, but it's a well-made beer that just doesn't fit my palate. Worth trying as it is a good overall experience, and if you don't have the same reaction to the taste, I suspect you would find this beer to be quite enjoyable. Alas, I can only actually score it based on my own taste, but I think most people would not have the same reaction to the taste as I do."
""
""
"Overall: I like it. It's a nice beer if you are in the mood for a rather thick and sweet beer."
""
""
""
"D - Overall this was a real treat for me. To my inexperienced palate, the assertive presence of both malt and hops here sort of reads as a barley wine. However, I find this more accessible and drinkable than most barley wines because the hop presence and alcohol doesn't become too overbearing; this remains drinkable and very tasty throughout. While I probably wouldn't consider this much of an old ale by my standards, it's certainly a unique beer, and I certainly enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"Overall not the best old ale I've had, but a pretty good one. Only detractor is the appearance, with watching out for snot and lots of sediment it wasn't the best looking of brews either. But still good. Worth a try and I'd be Curmudgeon's Better Half is fantastic after having tasted this."
""
""
"Overall- a tasty brew. Not too complex, big taste, but it vanishes too soon. All considered, it's another fine brew from Founder's."
""
""
"I'm not sure this brew is a proper representation of an Old Ale, but it's still quite good. Thank you Matt for the wonderful extras!"
""
""
""
"O: This beer looks really nice in my snifter. And the oak and vanilla taste is interesting. I don't have much experience with old ales, but I like this one."
""
""
""
""
"O - Excellent aroma and a great taste, but the booze creeps up fast and becomes a bit too much. Some aging would do wonders on this beer, but at a few months old its not terribly impressive. I do prefer Old Stock to this."
""
""
"Overall a very, very nice ale. Very drinkable. I want to try this again."
"D - This one needs some time. The wet oak is currently a little overpowering."

""
"O: Tasty old ale. Good combination and balance of flavors. A little too bitter in the aftertaste. Not sure if it's hoppy or if it's ashy. Hard to say. Otherwise very enjoyable. A sweet and fruity and chocolatey old ale."
"Well this is the first Founders offering I just didn't like. It pours a hazy copper with about a one finger head and no lacing. Smell is apples, other sweet scents and alcohol. Mouthfeel is very thick. Taste is sweet with lots of alcohol on the finish. I don't mind high gravity beers, but I just feel the alcohol could have been better hidden. I felt like I was drinking bourbon. Sorry, but I don't really recommend this one."
""
""
"Pours a dark hazy amber with a quarter inch head and fine lacing. Quite a bit of sediment left floating around. Scents of rosated malts, bourbon, vanilla, and molasses are apparent. Taste follows nose to a T - fantastic malt profile, complimented by a creamy vanilla and then that firey bourbon at the back of your mouth, leaving behind a lingering taste of molasses and a hint of butterscotch. Mouthfeel is medium thick, and a little tacky on the tongue. Really a well done brew, another hit from Founders."

"O - this is big on malt goodness. Personally I love malts just as much as hops. You definitely have to enjoy sweetness and a load of malts and some Oaked character to enjoy this one. Frankly I appreciate this lovely old ale from Founders. It's a fantastic brew that requires the drinker to need a change of pace. I respect the brewer for reminding me its not only about the hops and Founders are the World's best at reminding us what good beer is."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, drinkability is pretty good. This is really a winter sipper, but I wanted something to make my post-work Friday afternoon more enjoyable. Mission accomplished!"
""
""
""
"This beer pours a very cloudy copper with no head or lace. The aroma is of grapefruit, caramel, and bread crust. The flavor leads with a bitter grapefruit smack, like an IPA, followed through with a cloying, sticky sweet caramel with a medicinal warmth in the finish. The mouthfeel is sticky and sickeningly sweet. Founders Curmudgeon (Old Ale) is a disappointing beer, not recommended."
"Very solid old dale from Founders, comes off as traditional and classic but with their own spin on it. Reminds me a bit of Fuller's Vintage Ale. Easy drinking for the style and ABV, Founders killin it as always."
""
"Not a homerun, but a decent beer I won't seek out again. There are too many other beers out there for the price."
""
""
"O - Pretty decent, a little thin for the abv with a little too much of a rummy/alcohol presence imo. I feel like most of the alcohol is not coming from the malts."
"O: Meh. In fairness, this is not a good late afternoon kind of beer, but I still found it rather mediocre despite that. A rare misfire from Founders, but it's not completely irredeemable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Worth reaching for another, but one of those beers that, while it won't be forgotten as it is far from average, lacks some of the balance of Founders' other august beers."
"Pours a murky burnt orange with minimal off white head. Carbonation streams off the bottom of the glass. Aroma is of rich, dark fruits up front. Plums, sweet cherries. Followed by vanilla, oak and bourbon notes. Rich caramel flavors up front give way to burnt oak and bourbon on the middle of the palate. Finishes sweet. While I don't actively seek out old ales, Founder's does a good job with this one. Worth a try."
"12oz bottle with Bottled 04/19/12 on the neck. Pours a rusty brown color with a thin layer of head. Some lacing. Aromas of booze, cherries, vanilla, and oak. A bit sweet. Taste is boozey oak up front with the cherries and vanilla. Some malts and breadiness. Boozey, oaky finish. Lightly carbonated. Overall, this is a solid Old Ale with nice Oak flavors to it. Well made."
""
""
"Edit - I just had a 2 year aged - and this brew is completely different.  It is actually fitting for the holidays as it has some holiday spice to the profile.  The booze is completely gone and  really drinks well.  I don't know that it is improving much, but more just muting itself."
"This was an instant favorite. Almost like a cognac - heavy vanilla and alcohol flavor, but there's more depth than that. A bit of oak and cinnamon, for instance, linger somewhere in there. The bar served it in a rocks glass which was disappointing as a snifter would have been perfect for this ale. I got plenty of enjoyment in the smell as it was, but a snifter likely would have made it even better. I really have to look into more old ales because if they are anything like Curmudgeon, it's a style perfectly tailored to my tastes."
"Overall: Really great. Not surprised that Better Half came out so well with this base. Would LOVE to see what regular bourbon barrel aging would do to this."
"O: I really like this beer though I want to see what a couple of years will do to mellow some of the spicing and molasses flavors"
""
"Another winner from Founders, like I expected anything else. I'm surprised it took me so long to review this since I'm a huge Founders fan. I really enjoyed this one as a change of pace and it will be in my fridge in years to come. I'll let one age, but I have a feeling this one is better fresh as the sweetness may intensify."
""
""
""
"Two finger off-white head dissipates over several minutes to a very fine layer and bubbles relegated to the ring around the glass -- what's there is a bit fluffy, but minimal. Red/copper coloring, with floating particles. Smell is delicious -- vanilla, molasses, malt, and hints of the oak in which it was aged. Love the smell. Taste follows the nose very similarly, except for sweetness. It's very sweet and for me, not particularly drinkable, meaning I don't think I can drink this every day. Vanilla is prominent, with malt and molasses; the sweetness somewhat masks the oak. Mouthfeel is smooth, syrupy, medium bodied, with some carbonation. Aftertaste is sweet and vanilla. Over I really like this beer -- it gets better with age. I look forward to tasting my 2011 vintage later this fall when it has 18-20 months on it."
""
""
"OVERALL: Great example of an Old Ale and it gets better after warming up for a few minutes."
"Cloudy copper - raisins and malty yeast aroma, so nice and comforting - quite hoppy for the style making it a unique ale - rich and complex - boozy in the middle - dried cherries/raisin/touch of vanilla/bourbon - finishes a little too sweet for my liking"
"O: A very decent beer. A little one-dimensional in my humble opinion. While there are different subtle flavors and aromas, I feel as if this beer definitely plays on the malts alone. I love Founder's beers, but this one seems slightly under their other superb offerings in their lineup. This is the first time I've had this, so perhaps I'll grow to like this one more with subsequent tastings."

"D - Very drinkable. Good malty old ale with a great balance of flavors and good mouthfeel and body."
""
""
"The beer pours an amber color with an off-white head. The aroma has a lot of caramel and dark fruit notes, as well as a good dose of alcohol. The flavor is similar. The caramel malt is pretty strong and provides a decent amount of sweetness. It is accompanied by some dark fruit and dark cherry notes, as well as some tobacco and alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
"O - Definitely a solid offering from Founders. It's not a mind blowing beer, but then again, every beer can't be from one brewery."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-I found this to be a solid offering from Founders but it is probably in the lower tier of their brews. Quite nice but fails to truly distinguish itself and leave a legacy in my mind. The Better Half version of this beer is a giant improvement. Still, this is a cool singe to try but doesn't warrant a $15-16 dollar four-pack price tag."
""
""
""
""

"O: Another solid brew from Founders. They don't brew bad beers (based on all the ones I have tried so far anyway)."
"O- Very good brew that sneaks some interesting favors into the beginning and the end."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent offering from Founders; I look forward to trying it with some age on it in the future, in hopes that the aging will bring out more flavors and limit the beer's heat a bit. In its young state, it does seem that this beer is more balanced than a number of other old ales, which become cloying quickly."
"Full body and light carbonation, this beer feels sticky when drinking it, syrupy almost. Overall it has it's shortcomings mostly in the aroma, but the taste well makes up for it."
""
""
""
"O - An enjoyable complex brew from Founders. Lots of flavors here, and they all work together well. This is a beer to sip and relax with."
""
""
"O- This is a nice old ale. Definitely not as good or flavorful as the Better Half, but good for much more attainable brew. This beer is very easy to drink however I definitely think it could use more flavor like the Better Half. Definitely a good Founders offering, but not their best. At $16 for a 4-pack I don't see myself buying much more of this due to the expense, but I recommend at least trying it."
"O - This beer was delicious and an awesome example of an old ale. It tastes and smells great with a variety of malt and dark fruity ester aromas and flavors. The molasses and oak-aging really add a lot of flavors, aromas, and character to this beer in my opinion. Another great offering from Founders."
"I enjoyed this beer. I'm not as familiar with the style but enjoyed Curmudgeon enough to explore the style more thoroughly. I have one more 2011 left that I'll be holding on to till next year."

"12oz bottle, poured into a tulip glass is deep amber in color, looks syrupy as it is being poured; has tall, frothy head that holds excellent retention and leaves tons of sticky lacing all the way down the glass - impressive. Aromas are sticky sweet with toffee, vanilla, oak, honey and biscuit. Tastes are bold and sweet, cloyingly at times. Notes of vanilla, oak, toffee, caramel, are all present with it being rather boozy, especially as it warms. Finishes with a peppery prickle on the tongue. Mouth-feel is velvety smooth and creamy. Overall, I loved coming back to this one, but the sweetness is a bit too much for the last 4 or so ounces. Excellent Founders quality as usual though."
""
"Overall: Very smooth, complex and highly drinkable. Can't wait to have this one again."
"I enjoy this beer quite a bit. To me it's like a relaxing beer to be sipped and enjoyed to unwind."
""
"(originally reviewed: 05-09-2011)"
""
"O. Overall it is a nice enjoyable beer to enjoy while relaxing or before going to bed."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale golden color with an off white head. The beer was poured very carefully, so there was very little head. The aroma was mild with notes of vanilla. Oak barrel and vanilla flavors are accentuated by the silky smooth mouthfeel. This is a very mild, pleasant, drinkable beer despite it's higher ABV."
"This is a malt bomb! Malty, bready, chewy in the mouthfeel. Notes of toffee, caramel, scotch. Some sharp dry alcohol esters in the back that are a little harsh. This is fresh, and it is good. I'm thinking with some age to soften the rough edges it will be amazing."
""
"O - Another score for Founders. I tend to feel like they get the styles ""just right", and this is no exception. Well done!"
""
"M: Medium leading to full."
"Overall this is a delicious big old ale!"
"With the alcohol being quite hot on this one I would expect it to be tough to drink but gets better was it warms. Probably will buy again and age it."
""
""
""
""
"O: Another great output from Founders. This is a very nice sipping beer. My only problem with it is the price. I'd definitely buy more of this if it weren't for the hefty price tag."
"O- A pretty decent beer, might need some more age on it, not my favorite from Founders by a long shot."
"D - I like this. It has a lot of the elements I would hope for in a well-made English-style Barleywine/Old Ale and seems to do just fine without the addition of some form of liquor or wine barrel. The taste is noticeably better than the aroma. I'm not sure this has enough body to stand the test of time in a cellar and show significant improvement, though I think it's worth the gamble."
""
""
""
""
"O: I usually don't much like beers so heavy on caramel malts, but this one is quite good. Interesting, complex flavor profile with a lot going on."
""
"Light cranberry colored, with almost no head and some solids at the bottom of the glass. What head there is quickly dissipates leaving nothing behind on the glass. Smell is slightly sweet like maple syrup with a touch of chocolate. Feel is medium-heavy with medium-light carbonation. Taste is boozy brown sugar, with a bitter, cough syrup-like finish. Overall this is quite good, if slightly boozy."
""
"O: In my opinion, this is akin to an imperial-ized English pale ale. It shares a lot of similar tastes (burnt caramel, leather, hops,) but much more potent. It's a nice, interesting beer that commands to be sipped and savored."
""
"O-may not be the hype this one is put up to but very good though. I love old ales and this may be my 2nd favorite. (I never had my favorite yet) so I always say."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The first time I had this beer it was side by side with Better Half, don't do that. It would have been all 3.5 until I tried it by itself and cold to warm. This is a good beer, I have gotten many now and could drink them year round. I love it, great beer overall. Had to edit this, as it warms up it is way better, room temp you get way more flavor out of this very complex beer."
""
"O- Best old ale I've ever had. Period"
""
"I have to admit, I don't get it. There's really nothing to this beer other than a light sweetness & touch of fruit. If I'm going to consume an alcoholic drink weighing in at 9.8%, I want something tasty. This is dull; mediocre at half the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really a great beer that I think is under appreciated. This is a hard style to do because there isn't a lot to hide behind. In my mind this is the best high ABV style - better than barley wine. Much better balance overall. I think this is a beer that will only get better for at least a year. I look forward to it."
"Curmudgeon is a very interesting beer, hard to describe. Lots going on with it, and I can't really compare it to anything else I've tried. I have heard that this one is better with some age on it. I bought two 4 packs, so one pack will be sitting for a year to see how they do with time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a beer that I love and have enjoyed many times in the past, I believe this to be the first time I've ever had it fresh (not used to tasting prevalent hops in this beast). While it is sublime with a year and more, fresh Curmudgeon is its own wonder. In fact, fresh Curmudgeon reminds me a lot of aged Backwoods Bastard. Recommended! And, I can't wait to finally do that side-by-side. 4.0"
""
""
""
"Overall: A heart, uncompromising brew. Definitely looking forward to aging it a bit."
"O: Very sweet from the molasses, almost overly so. Pretty decent."
""
""
""
""
""
"MOREY’S BOTTOM LINE: Very tasty, and a nice beer to sip on. Well made, but nothing really jumps out and wows you either. This would be a good campfire beer on a cool evening."
""
""
""
"O: Very well done old ale...ABV shows at the end and creeps up. Would buy again...."
""
"Final Thoughts: Good beer. I've kind of hyped this one up and heard about it alot so I'm a bit let down that it didn't blow me away, but it is pretty good on the overall level. I know they tried to tone down the body to give it more ""drinkability"" but it just feels unnatural for me. A definite try, but I wouldn't go nuts looking. Maybe some age would make this a really outstanding brew."
"Overall- The alcohol flavor was a little offputting at first, I'm glad it disappeared after the first swallow. I'm not sure if I'm a fan of this style. Decent but I probably won't buy this again."
""
""
""
"Overall: A big, rich, estery Old Ale. Well executed but definitely a sipper."
"O) A nice sipper. I enjoyed it, but in hindsight, not the best choice on a warm evening. Think I'll cellar the rest of these for the fall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall another really great showing from Founders. I was a little disappointed by the taste which didn't really bring any identifiable flavors. The alcohol really plays a good role in this beer and the mouthfeel and smell are really spectacular. Definitely a beer to drink slowly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not what I normally expect from an Old Ale, quite spicy and fairly dry. I'm really not sure what to make of this beer."
""
"Overall: I'm going with the word funky on this. It's got a interesting sweetness to it with a very present alcohol to it. Lots of brown sugars and molasses to it. Not my favorite beer in the world but it's an interesting take on the style."
""
"Cheers!!"
""
""
""
""
"Solid brew. Complex, alcohol well hidden. I will age a few and see how it changes."
""
""
""
"O: i was quite impressed with this brew. Had one fresh and revisited this brew again about 8 months after bottling, and I find this one much better FRESH. The smoothness has fallen off a bit and now more molasses forward rather than a nice balance of vanilla, spice and hops. I also feel that this brew has become lighter on the tongue from what I remember."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is just bland. A big surprise from such a great brewery. I had a 3 year old version of this a few weeks back and thought it was terribly bland but figured it was past its prime. Its a bit better fresh, but not much."
"Drinkability: To me this seems more like a Christmas/holiday release. The booze and the burnt/woodiness make me think of blazing fireplaces, Christmas trees, and snow. It is an odd little thing but is pretty tasty."
"Myself, I probably won't spend the money on this again, it was quite pricey."
""
"O- Never had an old ale before and to be honest I was expecting a little more. I was expecting someting along the line of a barleywine and an imperial stout. This is however a nice sipping brew and I look forward to seeing how it does with age."
""
"O- good but has not gotten better with age IMO. Would have liked to do a side by side to compare a new curmudgeons."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A unique brew and certainly a mellowed out version of the Better Half. I cannot justify paying near $3 a bottle of this at my local store. There are a near infinite number of brews I can find better in every category. I must note the alcohol is hidden masterfully, yet this seems to be a trend from the folks at Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a re-rate. Got a funky bottle the first time, I think. Pours deep amber brown with a small yellowish head on top. Aroma is molasses, oak, HUGE malt, and actually a bit of dark fruit. Very low carbonation, and a thick viscous mouthfeel. Flavor is all malt forward with a definite oak presence. Sweet and sticky, with the sweet coming from a combination of caramel malt and some fruit flavor. Will certainly warm you with the alcohol, though it isn’t too assertive. I can appreciate the massive malt presence, but I’m not sure I believe this is ""balanced", as Founders claims. Still not a huge fan of this one, but certainly better than the first bottle I had (that one got a 1.8). Up front it is a bit much, but it can grow on you a bit as you sip through"
""
""
""
""
""
"The '12 goes down much easier than its elder. It really is an entirely different beer. I was unsure if I would be too interested in the differences between these two but, alas. All in all, I'd recommend the fresh Curmudgeon over an aged version 9 times out of 10."
""
"Overall: A very nice brew that I will love to come back to soon. Many interesting notes going on that I love."
""
""
"Age on the bottle has only made things even more smooth. The flavors have melded together quite well. As I mentioned a year ago, the flavor begins smoothly then intensifies to a wonderful hoppy bite. I'm picking up on a little coffee as well. Carbonation is still on the low side, but who is complaining? Probably the old curmudgeon."

"D: flavor and the nose are good, not great. a little too much booze on this less than a month old example. i will certainly consider setting a few of these aside for a while and im sure that would make them that much better."
"3.5, 4, 3, 4, 3"
"O - Really like Curmudgeon. This is probably a better beer when fresh I think, but it would be fun to do a side by side. Very excited to get to my Better Half when the time is right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I could only imagine how this beer would come out from the barrel..."
"O-At a year old it seems to be past its prime, lots of malt and not much else"
""
"Overall, it is a phenomenal blend of savory flavors."
""
""
"O. I haven't had many Old Ales, but the ones I have have generally been a bit fruitier and sweeter. This is more refined and subtle. A tasty beer, but probably wouldn't want a whole lot of this. Good, but not particularly memorable."
""
""
""
"Overall - An outstanding old ale. Good complexity, taste, and just a good beer. Well done by Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Quite delicious beer. It's an ugly beer, but delicious."
""
""
"O - Certainly a nice treat, I'm glad I have a few more bottles of this vintage floating around."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good, full bodied and full flavor. Silky, smooth, and a good balance of flavors. No hop presence in the flavor but a slight bitter feel in the finish. Might be slightly under carbonated due to the age, but this guy is 3 years old, so I'd say it's held up quite nice for the age. Drinks well, a nice sipper. Alcohol doesn't doesn't burn or anything either, well hidden for a brew that's almost 10%. Overall another great beer from Founders."
""
""
" I wish the sweet aspect of this beer packed more of a punch on the palate, more raisin and dates. I think even a little vanilla would take this one a long way. The fantastic slightly roasty and bready base could be built on."
"Overall: A great old ale, but I've come to expect more from Founder, I was a bit disappointed"
""
"So I had a year old keg at a tap takeover, but Ive got fresh bottles, and I couldnt resist. Pour is like a good barleywine-bright orange with no head. ok now this is the biggest compliment ever. It reminds of Regulator Doppelbock at Bull City Burger and Brewery. Grassy Earthy malt dominates like crazy. Feels crisp, but in an insanely good way. Maybe its the style, but its unique for sure. Very earthy malt, hints of caramel, and a nice bit of scotch barrel. Very smooth caramel and syrupy notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Color is a ruddy, burnt umber, with light flecks floating about. Seems to be some carbonation - a peach colored head initially appears to be about 1/4"" but dissipates shortly thereafter. Aroma is sweet, with figs, toffee, molasses, bittersweet chocolate, and grainy malt apparent. The body is full and rich, with a wine-like acidity. The first hint of the flavor is like dessert of some kind before the hops kick in. Warms nicely without being too astringent. Overall, a great balance between sweet & bitter aspects. Would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a slightly hazy mahogany color with a thin cap of ivory bubbles for a head; not much to speak of in the way of retention or lacing. Aroma of bready malts, caramel, molasses, and dried candied fruits. The taste reflects the aroma, with flavors of sweet malts, toasty, dark sugars, fruitcake, tangy alcohol warmth, with a tinge of citrus and hop bitterness in the finish. Very nice brew, heavy-medium mouthfeel, lots of flavor, easily drinkable, though can be a little on the hot side."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, rich, copper-ruby coloring with a good amount of bubbling in the beer that doesn't really move around much. Looks heavy. No head, but there is a ring of film around the edge of the surface. Aromas are rich and smooth, and extremely malty and layered. Some rich dark fruit and earthy highlights on the nose, also. Flavors are super smooth and rich, with a boozey, roasted, and old world fruit sweet in the backbone. Dates, raisins, and fig throughout the beer layer nicely with the heavier malt profiles of molasses. Earthy characteristics rough the beer up a bit and keep it interesting for your tastebuds. A slight peppery hopping at the end cleans the palate and prepares you to jump back in to the brew. The aftertaste is rich and slightly cloying, but pleasantly so. This one keeps stringing you along for more. The finish is rich and smooth, with a surprising cleanness at the end. Very tasty, and not overpowering despite the strong flavor profiles and increased ABV."

"Into a tulip glass settles a reddish deep amber under a well sustained head. Deep candy sweet toasted malt busts through in the nose with a hefty blend of syrupy cherries, mild citrus and caramel. Enjoyed at a cool temperature, the flavors here take on a rich, well pronounced, and warming character that reminds me of a post meal cordial. A powdery dry and complex flavored finish echoes the blend of boozy fruit, caramel, and cocoa that just waltzed on the palate."
"Mouthfeel is similar to gulden draak- too syrupy but it's a little more carbonated. Definitely an interesting one to try."
""
"O - this is a pretty good beer, i think. It might do better with a bit more age, but it tastes pretty good and has a lot going on."
""
""
"O: Founders Curmudgeon isn't quite the beer I remember when fresh, when I feel it drinks a bit better. It's a good beer, but not a great beer, as there are better in-style that I'd recommend before this. An above average offering in general, though it's a middle of the road entry in Founders world class portfolio."

" Poured into dimpled mug a cloudy dark amber with very little head retention. Smells clean, light citrus scent, very complex mix of sweet, dark fruits, malt and a bit of hops. Taste is a nice blend of the aforementioned smells with the 9.8% abv adding a nice warming presence to the very nice complexity of the flavors and a velvety burn on the finish, but very good, very drinkable even for a sipper. Another solid Founders beer that I will happily purchase more of in the future."
""
"One of the easiest to drink old ales I've yet to have."
""
"O: Good stuff, really hope I can get my hands on some more this year to try it fresh and as it ages"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not too shabby for being bottled on 4/9/11. Could only imagine how much more mellowed out this beer could get if it were aged properly. Still very delicious and now I will look out for his better half."

"Still another swell drink from founders though"
""
"Poured this into a Unibroue tulip. Appearance is dark red with a short off-white head. Its` nose contains vanilla, toffee and dark fruits. The taste has caramel, brown sugar, more dark fruit. Booze comes through in taste, as well as some bitterness. MF is crisp, nice as it warms up, goes down fairly easy. All things considered, this is a damn good old ale. I was glad to see this again as the temperatures dropped in 2011."
""
"The transition from the slow start to the strong finish (both in taste and mouthfeel) doesn't feel connected, but instead like two different drinks. It's nice, but I'm letting the other bottles sit for a few months."
"O:Delicious Founders brew that I very much enjoyed as a nightcap. The boozy nature of this beer is appealing while it sneers at you as a Curmudgeon would."
""
"D: What you'd expect from Founders, a very good beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: Nothing spectacular but quite drinkable. Closer to Dirty Bastard than Backwoods Bastard, sadly, and not up to the expectations."

"Curmudgeon from a bottle is a pretty deep red amber color, but light thin head and little lacing, which all goes away pretty quick. Smells *very* sweet. Smell is sweet honey caramel with some heat tingling the nose hairs. Very sweet taste. Honey is the dominant flavor, with traces of cream, caramel, sweet malt, and a touch of fruit. Quite complex. Sweetness is followed by booze for a hot finish. Very interesting overall flavor. Mouthfeel is warm and heavy, creamy-boozy, low carbonation. I like this beer. Not something I would get on the regular, but I'm definitely glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Curmudgeon is somewhere between Old Ale and Barleywine, and although it is drinkable, the nearly 10%ABV is unsurprising."
""
"I don't have much experience with this style, but I like this beer a lot. Layers of interesting flavors. I wouldn't expect anything less from Founders."
""
"O: This is definitely a well-crafted beer and probably a must-try of you like old ales. To me, the matly, sugary, buttery notes were too overwhelming."
"7/28/2011"
"D/O: Really more interesting than good, this old ale seems to ooze authenticity. While no part of it qualifies as offensive, there is a discordant note than is struck early on in the taste by a precocious bitterness that is awkwardly fresh in its plant-like way. Then on its heels is a similarly lively acidity; taken together, these two elements have the effect of splitting the flavor profile into asymmetrical halves. Deeper on things seem to normalize, with a remarkable complexity coming on by the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice Old Ale from an amazing brewery. I have yet to be let down from Founders. This particular bottle had some age on, I would like to try one fresh to compare. It was really smooth, lots of flavor, and a perfect beer for a nice cold night."
""
"Drink- I really enjoy old ales and this was right up there with some of the better ones I have had. I like the vanilla notes that were prevalant in this one. Would love to age some of these."

"This is another one that was just consistent in all the five categories. Think ""old""...""curmudgeon""....and ""delicious"". Founder's, as always, really nailed it with this one - the name and the five ""senses"" really matched up. Smell of biscuit, must, leather, sweat from the collar?...taste is just ....fantastic, very little sweetness that I prefer, but makes up for it with tangy, woody, bourbon-like feel. Not a heavy mouth, solid, but not heavy at all. For me, I didn't taste the alcohol at all, although the 9.8% indication made me hesitate to drink this at 5pm. Try it!!"

"Overall, this is one of the most smooth drinks I've had yet. The blending was done very tastefully. I prefer it fresh due to the more noticeable hop presence, but it's still a treat aged."
""
"Overall: Definitely enjoyed this one. Not QUITE as refined as it could have been, but still a delicious mix of booze, carmelly malt, and hoppy bitterness. Recommended!"
""
"This beer poured out as a dark brown color without much head on top. The smell of the beer was malty and pretty sweet smelling actually. There was also some boozy aromas that flooded the nose too. The taste of the beer was sweet and lightly roasted, lots of caramel flavors and some fresh wood in there too. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Overall this beer was pretty good, I feel it gets better with some age to it. Either way it's another good brew from Founder's."
"O- well there is a reason founders is who they are... curmudgeon is an unbelievable brew. Again it is so smooth and lively with flavor that you almost feel like you are drinking a rich amber ale. Unbelievable...."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Perfect warmer-upper for a cold fall/winter day. Incredibly smooth beer for nearly 10%. Rich in flavor and a really nice sipper of a beer. I'm going to save a bottle of this for a year or two to see how it matures."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not my favorite style, but not a bad brew. Lots more noticeable alcohol than I anticipated."
""
""
""
"O: A nice beer, but the carbonation is just a touch high and hurts the beer. Really a huge beer, and the dryness and oak really help lighten it up and make it enjoyable. Knock back the carbonation just a touch and it would really be a winner for me. Regardless, another fine beer from Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a beginners brew. This is definitely a cult beer, but Old Ales generally are a cult style. This is one worth seeking out, but you must prepare yourself for it. A little age does this one better justice. 100%, absolutely mastercraft, but this beer is HUGE!"

"Taste is sweet with a hint of bitterness but mostly a biting alcoholic note that really ends warm on the tongue. Makes my head fuzzy right away and fills me with warm cheer. Great brew!"
"Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Murky brown with some sediment and a touch of light tan head that left pretty quick, perhaps cracked this a little too cold. Some spotty lacing and minimal retention. Smell is of dark fruits, raisins, carmel and burnt sugar. Taste follows more of the carmel/molasses that is very strong and a bit on the boozy end. Picked up a little fig note on the end, but reminded me of burnt carmel and hops bitterness. A decent amount of carbonation with a very thick feel on the tongue. Heavy with a hint of silk. Overall- Not my style I guess. Was wanting the booziness to give way to the rich flavors, but it was kind of over the top carmel with some hops on the end. Not sure I'll grab another. Shame because I like some other Founders offerings-"
"Overall, Curmudgeon makes for a pleasant night cap, but I would probably buy Hibernation, the Ola Dubh series, and North Coast Old Stock before grabbing this one again. A serviceable Old Ale that falls short of the greats."
"For me, this style is certainly hit or miss and while I don't think this was a complete miss, it wasn't a dead-on hit either. There are some really nice complexities in the beer but also some very tangent flavors. There doesn't seem to be a mastered balance in the flavor profile, but it still does have qualities that make it enjoyable."
"Taste is of brown sugar, caramel, maple and pretty boozy. Very sweet. Mouth-feel thick and syrupy. Alcohol is very present. Not in a bad way, just definitely a nice warming/sipping brew. Overall this is really good and enjoyable."
"o: great selection for a chilly night. cant compare it to other old ales though. enjoying the subtle use of hops--contrasts the upfront sweetness of the malt"
"D-This is a very nice and intriguing brew. I like it quite a bit as is, but now I have to try it fresh to compare. ABV is very well hidden; be careful!"
"Overall, I'd love to be able to get more of this brew, I look forward to seeing founders in Texas one of these days!"
"O: This was a really good Old Ale, not as good as Old Stock but still delicious nonetheless."
"The body is heavy and sticky with soft carbonation. A little bit coarse on the finish. Overall this one is pretty outstanding; as are most of the Founders line up."
"M - Medium to full body, chewy. Light carbonation. Great mouth feel."
"O: This is an awesome style; some of my favorite flavors in one bottle. If this particular beer is a good representation of an Old Ale, I can assure you that I’ll be attacking this style with full force. Can’t wait for Kaiser Curmudgeon!"
"O: Is it an Old Ale or Barleywine? Who cares! It is tasty, tasty stuff."
"Color is a rather unattractive orange-brown, and the lack of any head or lacing doesn't help the appearance. Scents of dark fruits and molasses are nice if a bit weak, and there's a bit of a boozy smell too. Caramel and molasses are up front in the taste, with a punch of booziness in the finish that I don't find particularly pleasant. High pucker factor and plenty of burn going down the throat. This is not one of Founder's better offerings."
"Poured into a snifter from 12oz. bottle on 10/7/11, bottled on 04/09/11"
"Pours a hazy a coppery red amber with a one finger head, leaves a thin lacing, descent retention for a high gravity beer. Pours thick as molasses. Aromas are spicy, bready, yeasty, malty and boozy. Slight papery or woody like character to the malt. Many dried fruit flavors, raisin, fig, plum. Lots of bready, and woody malt and caramel flavors. Spicy, boozy, oakey, bits of whiskey linger in the finish. Good rich mouth feel, a bit wet, but malty enough to balance this to make an overall medium bodied beer. Definitely some heat going in and down the hatch. Excellent brew here."
"o - this is a decent old ale. little bitter. this is a great style for barrel aging and the kaiser curmudgeon...whoa...now THAT'S a beer."
"I really didn't care for this beer. It was surprising since I enjoyed so much Founders in the past."
"Overall a good beer that I look forward to hopefully seeing again soon."
"O- Wouldn't mind having this again if it were cheaper and actually available in my state. I like it. I can tell this one will get better with age."
"Poured kinda hard due to the fact I knew it was an Old Ale. Lots of chunkies and yeast cake, what the hell? Off white head, deep aubern color, floating yeast matter. Pretty ugly except for the uncharicterstic lacing. Aroma of malt forward English yeast, sweet malts, and specialty malt. Some cherry notes on the aroma, but their light. Flavor, really malt forward, some caramel wait no alot of caramel, some light molasses. In addition some phenol like English yeast flavor is present. Thick under-attenuated beer, sweet, thick mouthfeel. And even a little bitter on the finish from some hops. Not bad. In the panthion of Old Ale it isn't a victory but it's ok."
"Pours a nice brown with some orange tones. There is very little head on this beer at all. There is not much of a nose to this beer; perhaps one can sense a bit of caramel, but that is it. The taste is rich and malty with an alcohol bite in the finish. The flavors become deeper as the beer warms. I think that this is a strong effort from one of the most consistent breweries in the U.S."
"O- A good old ale that is for sure a solid beer. A little hot and nothing to special on this one, unlike it's Kieser variation, but still a good ale from a great brewery. I think the drinkability for me makes this a food pairing beer or a sipper defiantly not a session beer."
"This is a heavy one and defiantly one that you want to sip and take your time drinking. Though for as heavy as it is, I thought it was on the smooth side with a pinch of carbonation and some stickiness. Like others have said this is a good winter beer and really should be coming out in the late fall instead of the late spring."
"Overall: man, I came into this beer wanting to love it, and instead I have rated it dramatically low. If you love a biscuity malt flavor; if Fat Tire is your favorite beer ever; if you ever wonder why they make anything other than Victory malt, then this beer may be for you. It is not, however, for me."
"O - A really interesting outing. Not sure if its oak-aged, but I wouldn't be surprised. The grains predominate, but there's enough going on behind it to give it a really unique and flavorful character that is highly recommended."
"D - A little too boozy for me, but there are some redeeming qualities. Worth a try."
"Very nice. As I continue to explore sweeter beers, I stumbled across this one perusing other reviews. My focus has been stouts/porters, trying to find best of breed in this category (in my opinion!). This one came to my attention based upon reviews I read. Perhaps I just stumbled on a unique Old Ale ... but this is right up may alley. Has all the sweetness I like, minus the hop bite of course. Guess I need to expand from stouts/porters into a new category!"
"Depth of flavors really interesting. I am tasting a lot of sweetness, specifically cherry-vanilla and caramel. Whopping alcohol is apparent, with an astringent note. Minimal bitterness. Aroma is boozy caramel and butterscotch. A little syrupy. Appearance is cloudy, and muddy, like liquid clay. Not for the novice ale drinker."
"Not a huge fan of this one, but with some age, maybe the booze will fade and the malt can become more prevalent to create a better balance. Probably my least liked beer I've had from Founders."
"O: solid, drinkable beer. It's not at all cloying. About right at about $10 for a 4 pack."
"Really easy drinking here; other reviewers' claims of strong, biting booze don't hold true for me. Completely delicious -- I'll be buying another 4pk to cellar."
"Overall I was very surprised by this. Kind of a barley wine meets the roasts of a barrel aged stout. That is a bit dramatic but not far off. Thanks to davesway10 for this extra."
"This is basically a somewhat dulled version of Founders' Backwoods Bastard, which itself is one of the finest bourbon Scotch ales made in the US. OC has most of the same features of BB-- heavy on the apricots and butterscotch, with just enough oak to make everything fat, round and happy-- only less by about 25%. But then, this is a good deal sweeter as well. If you like Founders' Dirty Bastard or Backwoods Bastard, you'll like Old Curmudgeon. For me, it's a tad sweet but still nice to be drinking as I sit in a small house on the beach in Truro, MA, watching hurricane Irene blow north. Things could be worse."
"Overall this is a pleasant slow-sipping beer. This style in general is not a favorite of mine, but I think this is a good representation. For price point though, I'd rather get a great DIPA or RIS. Still, if you are looking to introduce yourself to the style or are a fan of the style, I would pick this one up."
"O: Without looking through my notes to be sure, I think this is my first old ale. I will search for more in this style, and am glad I tried this, but personally this particular bottle is not for me."
"O: A slow sipper for sure. Pretty good, but not my favorite. Probably the first Founders beer I haven't really liked."
"Overall: I like it! It dances on the edge of Cloying Cliff but never crosses the rim. Any sweeter and it would have been terrible...as it is, amazing."
"D- I didn't hate this beer but it was far from what I was going for in an Old Ale. The hops really cover up most of the complexity that it might be able to have, I would like to see how it ages but I don't know where to get a bottle."
"Overall, our favorite thing about this beer was that it tasted very much like a dubbel, but with a more complex nature about the aroma. The nose was perfectly balanced to allow for the sweet components to shine through over top of the bitter roasted malt presence. Where this beer lost points was in the over the top sweetness. It is not that the sweetness was so offensive that it made the beer undesirable, however, by the end of the glass it did prove a bit overwhelming."
"Overall: Strongly in favor of this beer, not familiar with this style but would rate this as a strong 4."
"O: Tasty beer and something I'd like to try again. The barrel aged version is probably fantastic if this is the base beer."
"Since the body can thin out as it ages I don't see this improving much with cellaring. Maybe the complex aromas in the nose would impart into the flavor...that would be a plus...and mellow out that sensation of burnt malts. I do really like this beer, but not as an old ale. If they didn't have ""Old Ale"" written on the label I would have given a higher rating as I would not have reviewed against the style."
"o 2.5 had hoped for much more. not expecting age to work miracles, but i will wait and see with the other bottles."
"O- Really great beer, especially the rich mouthfeel. The hop-malt balance is near perfect. The only problem is I drank it way too fast, I could easily drink a few of these in a single night. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Overall, my favorite ""old ale"" because the complexities in the taste aren't overrun by the hops, or even by the bitterness (which Founders can do on certain brews) Top notch brew."
"Quite tasty, but definitely a sipper."
"Overall still a difficult style suited to a different type of beer drinker."
"Overall, a decent brew from a great brewery. This one is a good candidate for sharing a few ways."
"I get brown sugar and molasses, some vanilla and a bit of plum and raisin fruitiness. No hops and even the ~10% booze is very well hidden. This beer is drinking like nectar and I wish I had more of it to consume. This is a rich malty brew that I am glad to have sampled and would purchase again on the spot. Highly recommended, maybe even age for a year, this bottle is excellent!"
"This is my second Curmudgeon, and I've enjoyed it both times. A nice sipping beer for a nightcap. I am going to age a few to see if any additional flavors develop over time."
"O - Not bad but not great, especially at $16.99/4 pack. Pales in comparison to North Coast Old Stock."
"Old Curmudgeon is a mixed bag for me. Looks good, smells nice, but just kinda mails it in tastewise. Not sure if that's what it should always taste like, but given what other people have said, it might be that I had a dodgy bottle. Will have to revisit this brew properly some other day."
"-Cheers"
"O: very unique taste quite enjoyable, has intense depth that is surprisingly not off-putting"
"Cheers to Illudium for the sample!"
"O: Nice beer that gets nicer as it warms. Lots of caramelised malts balance the inherent funkiness of the style. Another success from Founder's. Recommended."
"O: Pretty weird, but I think I like it. Takes a little while to get used to."
"#5 of 9."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. I think I will go back to an adjective I used earlier to sum up this beer: gritty. From the oak to the malts to the alcohol and even the appearance, this beer is not pretty. It's big, sweet, and if you're not careful it can put you on your ass. Still, a nice beer that just needs a little bit of fine-tuning."
"O: Plenty of good flavors in this one. very drinkable old ale. I'm not used to that."
"M - Thick body. Syrupy to the last sip. Mild carbonation. Perfect amount for the style. Leaves the mouth feeling sticky."
"An excellent blend of flavor, sweet with a light hop balance. Alcohol actually adds to the taste rather than detracts. Creamy taste really adds a nice dimension without distracting or overshadowing other flavors. Aroma is good but nothing too special like a barleywine. It also reminds me of Old Stock ale, though I may have enjoyed OS a little more."
"A pretty solid alt. Not many Americans even do one, so props to Founders for that."
"Overall, I enjoy the crap out of this beer every year and I desperately need to try the barrel aged version. Another winner from Founders."
"O: Probably the worst I've had from founders. I've had KBS and Dirty bastard, which were both fantastic, so this one must be a hiccup."
"Good but not great. Again, can someone tell me again the difference between this and a barleywine?"
"12oz bottle thanks to somebody here who sent it to me as an extra. Amber color, short head. Smells rich, booze, malt, candy, good. The flavor was nice old ale with a bit of alcohol, toffee, really quite nice. Overall, I'd buy this if I could and wouldn't mind another bottle. Founders makes some quality beers."
"Overall - Not really what I was expecting from an Old Ale, but not bad. The apples aren't what I want in an Old Ale. I want strong malts, caramel and vanilla. Still, I didn't seem to have any difficulty finding a home for the beer once it got into the glass."
"O: Decent old ale but lacks that ridiculous sweet alcohol flavour that makes and old ale distinctive. Takes like an old oxidised DIPA. 3.5"
"my first try at an old ale and I am sort of on the fence about it. It doesnt seem terribly balanced, as the oak is sort of overbearing. We will see if I like it more as the 4-pack dwindles, but presently, there are other founders brews i would rather reach for."
"Overall: This old ale tasted more like a malt-foward barleywine. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Good stuff and will age nicely one hopes."
"o - pretty drinkable for almost 10%, but maybe better enjoyed slowly over the course of the night. a damn fine example of the style and a perfect match for the cold autumn nights in michigan. worth seeking out."
"Overall: Not bad, has a lot of potential. I like North Coast Old Stock better so far, but the bottles I've had of that are much older than my bottles of Curmudgeon. I will revisit this at a later date and re-review it."
"Overall-Flavors came out alot more as beer warmed. It's close to room temp now and I'm enjoying it more. Booze comes through more, but flavors are nicer. Have a few more bottles that I'm looking forward to drinking during the winter."
"Overall - very smooth and tasty. I don't think Founders can make a bad beer."
"O--This was a fantastic brew. It didn't taste much like an old ale to me, though. It tasted like a perfectly aged barleywine. I would go back to this beer again if I come across it."
"O - Very tasty old ale. Will crack the three over the next 4 years."
"O - The drinkability here is pretty good. It goes down smooth and the flavor is very nice. This is definitely a sipper. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It is a bit on the boozy side, but I would definitely buy it again. I recommend trying it out if you haven't."
"O: Old Curmudgeon holds together its disparate elements quite well, better than my descriptions represent. As the beer warms up, the bitterness seems to increase, too, becoming a more dominant player. Still, this beer is a great sipper and is brewed for extensive cellaring. "
"overall a bit underwhelming for a big beer, especially an old ale. but it does have a great degree of approachability. not sure of the cellaring aspect...maybe i'll save the other two bottles out of the four pack for the winter solstice, as this hit the spot on the summer solstice; a terribly cold, wet, rainy and windy day here in the northland."
"A little disappointed with both the nose and taste on this again. I will definitely be revisiting an aged bottle of this. Kaiser Curmudgeon was absolutely fantastic, but pretty much any malty ale would being aged in maple syrup barrels. Definitely a good beer to sip but I suppose I had higher expectations for this one. Looking forward to my future review."
"O – Very interesting here. Has some of the attributes I really enjoy with a nice balance of sweet and alcohol hotness. Nice job. I wouldnt have more then one or two because you do feel the ABV."
"This is a drink for those who prefer a thick, sweet sipper. Low on the totem pole for me."
"Overall, a good American old ale. Nice flavors in this and I look forward to seeing how they develop over time. I didn't really like this one too much when fresh, I'm glad everything has matured a little bit. Can't wait for the booze to die off in it."
"Overall this is a nice oak aged beer.  It's good, but I suspect much better once aged. Overall a B/B+"
"O - An average old ale, a bit extreme on some of the flavours caused some imbalance. I would have it again with another year or two on it. Not bad, average."
"This is a delicious beer that I highly recommend you try. Founder's impresses me once again which at this point is no surprise."
"O - Really happy to finally score a 4-pack of this. Nose promises a much more complex beer, and I feel like the body is a bit thin, even when considering the style. I'm not a huge fan of the herbal hop character here, but all this being said, I still think this is a really solid beer, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this ages. Can imagine it will be divine when the hops fall off and with a little oxidation sweetening it up all the more. Enjoy!"
"This isn't a bad beer, but it definitely didn't grab my attention. Although it's well-crafted, I expected more from Founders. Average beer from an above average brewery."
"This one is quite thick, and it burns. It's very tasty, but there is no way I'm drinking more than one. It's aroma and some of the taste remind me of a Belgian. Overall, it was an enjoyable beer."
"Mouthfeel is flat and watery smooth, and it would flow down easy if the alcohol bite wasn’t so sharp; carbonation was basically non existent, with a tiny hint of fizzle, a very heavy body and a tart finish that lets the alcohol kick you in the gut on the way down. I’m glad I tried it as I love Founders products, but this is a ski resort beer and one to sip and savor."
"Not what I was expecting overall. It was good and had a level of complexity but I wasn't expecting such a heavy boozy ale."
"Well done by Founders. I would say this is a berleywine though. The ABV is decently hidden...give it a try!"
"EDIT: Bottled 04/09/11"
"Overall, this is a good beer. As expected, the beer is pretty sweet at the onset, but the bitterness of the finishes creates balance and adds to the drinkability. The higher abv is masked nicely, with only a slight alcohol burn in the finish."
"Overall: Solid old ale. While this could definitely use some age, I could happily drink this often as is. It doesn't quite have the character of Great Divide's Hibernation Ale or Hair of the Dog's Adam, but it's high quality. Not a homerun, but another really good beer from Founders."
"Overall fairly solid, just out of the bottle the beer looks kind of lifeless."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a murky amber color with a 2 inch light orange head that fades to a thin cap. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of malt, caramel, and maybe some brown sugar. Taste is of malt, caramel, brown sugar, with a spicy hop bite. There is a little bit of bitterness that quickly fades after each sip. A very low level of carbonation makes for a thick and chewy mouthfeel that is a bit flat. Overall, this is a pretty good beer from Founders but the mouthfeel is not that great in my opinion."
"Medium-full in body with a very light carbonation, the mouthfeel is neither thin nor heavy. some sweet caramel notes appear up front, Mingling within are notes of oak, vanilla and burnt sugar, but the astringent nature of the middle is somewhat off-putting and carries through well into the finish with an almost solventy nature. The finish is extremely dry and displays more oak barrel notes of vanilla."
"Overall this is a great beer, not dying to seek it out again but it is good just as everything else from founders has been"
"M/O: Crisp and drinkable with some very good weight from the alcohol. Very good strong beer."
"Poured from bottle into tulip. Appearance is dark amber color with light, beige head. Aroma is of malty sweetness, toffee, dark fruits, and a slight boozy-ness. Taste is complex - it started off with a heavy character of toasted malts, sweet bread, and caramel. As the it warmed up, there was more and more strong dark fruit flavors especially plum, which combined with the alcohol gave it a somewhat boozy quality. As my palate grew more accustomed to the heavy malt bill, I noticed more of the subtle hop bitterness that was lying underneath. Palate was full-bodied, thick in texture sitting heavy in the mouth, light and soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. Not my choice from one of my favorite breweries, Founders."
"Overall: A nice nightcap, good hop presence, big alcohol, and some fruity notes. Not intended for the meek."
"O- The 9.8% ABV is not well hidden, the finish isn’t that clean, and it a little sweet. OK for an old ale, but there are much better examples out there."
"M: As my palate grew more accustomed to the heavy malt bill, I noticed more of the subtle hop bitterness that was lying underneath. Palate was full-bodied, thick in texture sitting heavy in the mouth, light and soft carbonation, and a bitter finish."
"Overall: A nice tasting old ale that is pretty easy drinking considering the alcohol."
"O: Overall, a decent old ale. Even with a year on it, there are still some hop and alcohol notes present. Unfortunately, I think it may have oxidized slightly. I will have to try it again fresh."
"O - A decent old ale. Not as good as 4D or Kaiser Curmudgeon, but still very drinkable ."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty damn good Old Ale. The only other Old Ale I have had was Third Coast Old Ale, so I don't have tons of experience with this style but I find it to be pretty similar to a Barleywine. For being almost 10% this beer was pretty damn drinkable, it went down a lot faster then I expected, even though the alcohol was there and a little warming it was still hidden and blended nicely with the other flavors. I would buy a four pack of this to age till the winter, this beer seems like it would make a nice big beer to drink around the fireplace during the winter, seems like this beer is more suited for a winter release. My only complaint about this beer was it's head but that is borderline nitpicking. If you like Old Ales, Barleywines, or just big beers in general this is a must try. Founders truly is the king of big beers, they just alway turn out kick ass, and thats what makes Founders one of Michigan's best brewing companys."
"Happy Drinking!"
"Founders has definitely earned my repeat business. Got quite a few of these, actually, so I'm gonna see how they age."
"I thought it would be a bit stronger in aroma and flavor with a thicker feel, but its still tasty."
"O- This was my first experience w/ an Old Ale, but I really enjoyed it. Founders is a really fine brewer of beers, and I have not been let down by this one at all. In fact, this beer has made me want to search out others of this style. Highly recommended."
"Pours a great looking Amber brown color with a pretty tan head forming, leaving lace behind. Aroma was of sweet malts with a light caramel and heat. Taste was interesting for a old Ale as I lean more towards malt base for this style. This old ale was good though I felt the malt didnt jump out and the carbonation was a bit to much. The brew taste too crisp for this stle to me. Possibly with some age the malt may jump out ahead. Aging the last 3 brews to see how she does."
"O - this is one damn fine old ale. theres a lot going on in every aspect of this beer and it just comes off as a cut above the rest."
"The high alcohol was noticable but not overpower which is what I like in a high abv beer. I will for sure get this one again!"
"Overall- Yet another amazing offering from Founders and something that I would definitely pursue again, it’s really too bad this is only a seasonal offering because this one would be great year round. A great drinking old ale that hides the high ABV very well, smooth crisp and almost too easy drinking. I would definitely pick this one up in a heartbeat and hope I can find it again on my next beer haul to the States."
"O- I could easily drink multiple of these. Good stuff."
"Overall- This is a great Old Ale, booze is well hidden, nicely balanced, good piny resinous balance to the sweetness of the malt."
"overall, another good beer from founders. they are working their way up to becoming my favorite brewery."
"Overall, this is one of the best Old Ale's I've had (right up there with Bell's Third Coast Old Ale.) I'm sure this would be a real winner with a year or more of age on it to help mellow the booziness and build a little more character, but it's fantastic fresh as well. A really solid Old Ale by my favorite brewery!"
"Full bodied with good carbonation, this thick beer surprisingly fizzes on your tongue if held long enough. The high carbonation gives it a nearly creamy mouthfeel and allows for great drinkability. Unfortunately, the overly bold flavors make this one a definite sipper."
"overall, another keeper from founders. wouldn't call it a homerun necessarily, but still very good (maybe an RBI single)."
"A sip is grassy pine hops quickly assaulted with a malty dark caramel then raisins and alcohol that's port-like in warmth. Light carbonation - slick and smooth throughout, really clinging to the mouth. This is a sipper - it still seems hot and aggressive even for an old ale. There's already a lot going on, especially as it warms up. I think I preferred Black Biscuit more, but this is really enjoyable overall and I can't wait for it to become a more sedate, institutionalized old curmudgeon."
"D: Another quality brew from Founders! It's hard to find anything that I don't like from them. The oak barrels are a nice touch giving this beer some nice flavor."
"O- A very good beer that's a definite sipper. This is very enjoyable now, but I'm also anxiously anticipating how this one might age, if the dark fruits note come out and the heat dies down just a bit this could be a very quaffable brew--still a sipper, but a mighty fine sipper."
"O- Very tasty old ale I would have liked to have seen less hops. Probably would do great with some aging."
"Curmudgeon may well be the best representation of this style available on the market today, and I wouldn't know it because I have little experience with Old Ales. Would I buy this again? Probably not. Would I buy any other beers of this style? Possibly, but there are other styles I prefer much more. Still, given Founders' reputation and the quality of their other beers, I'm very glad I tried this one."
"Overall - Its a big, strong boozy ale with lots of flavor. Some say its too much but hey, its a near 10% beer and its made by founders, enough said right?. I would swear this had been aged in oak barrels. I must ask is this really a old ale? One and done beer for sure."
"D-Pretty good considering the strength"
"D-Overall this is a great representation of this style. Maybe alittle much for some people but this beer is very complex and tastes great. wont be having more than 2 of these a night or i might end up passed out on the floor. Very good beer"
"O - I like it. Not my favorite old ale (but that's unfair considering I don't live far from Kuhnhenn), but it's good. I think I'd like it more if the hops were a bit more subdued so the awesome, complex malts could shine. It makes me think the Kaiser Curmudgeon (this beer aged in bourbon/maple syrup barrels) must be just about perfect..."
"O - When I smelled this, I was afraid it would have too much bourbon flavor. Im really not fond of whiskey or anything of the flavor but this beer was pleasantly flavorful yet not overbearing in this regard. The sweetness balanced the bite."
"9.8 50 ibus"
"Cheers!"
"As I'm mulling the fact that I will likely be snowed in tomorrow, I figured I may as well reach for something to hopefully warm me up. On a recent trip to Kansas City I was excited to find some Founders. I picked up a sixer of their Old Curmudgeon. This beer pours a deep orange to brown, and is apparantly bottle conditioned. Who knew. (I did not). So the color is a little murky but I blame that more on my ameaturish pour than anything else. Not a lot of head. Smells sweet, with dark molasses and brown sugar undertones. Taste is hefty, with a very very thick mouthfeel and clearly apparant alcohol level. The amount of hops present in the beer makes it taste almost like a Barleywine, as opposed to an Old Ale as it claims to be. Beer lends itself to meandering, as it's more of a sipper than something you want to go back to. More of a ""one and done"" type to be enjoyed at the end of the night."
"Drinkability - This is an excellent beer. It's a sipper, however and not conducive to a high drinkability standard. Very complex. This would go well on a cold night while reading a book. I, personally would not want to have more than one of these at a time. Just a bit too strong for me."
"The alcohol is definitely noticeable but doesn't detract. Medium body and appropriate carbonation. Very solid offering and enjoyable."
"D: If you like the taste then I guess drinkable. For me I had to labor."
"D- Overall this was a very enjoyable ale. the mouthfeel was the most interesting part of this beer. Also, the alcohol can sneak up on you if you have a few of these."
"Mouthfeel is quite full with adequate carbonation. Overall this is a good example of an under-appreciated style of beer, if you purchase a fresh bottle I would recommend letting it cellar for a little because the alcohol was slightly detectable. Founders knows how to make strong beers well that's for sure."
"Full bodied, lighter carbonation, sticky and syrupy on the tongue. Drinks pretty well, although its definitely a bit on the warm and sweet side of things."
"This one year old bottle pours deep, deep copper, and even an aggressive pour yields no head and no lace. It's hazy with some particles just hanging out, not moving at all. On the nose there are vanilla, sweet bready malts, prunes, and some slight booze. Nice to see a big barleywine-type beer in America made that doesn't taste like a cousin of a DIPA. In the mouth, a huge body carries down a slightly prickly breadiness with some vanilla and oak notes. The finish is quite long, mostly alcohol and sweet bread up on the front of the tongue. This is a nightcap for me, but for that purpose it's quite good."
"I first tried this beer at 6 months and the oak was belligerently obvious and far too sweet. Now at 9 months, it is quite yummy, though I can't help but wish I'd squirreled it away a bit longer. Brandy, dry oats, caramel, a tiny bit of anise. I'd like the malts to stand out a bit more, right now I'm getting that oaked-vanilla taste lingering in my mouth and the malts in the background, whereas I want them in opposite roles with the malts nestled snug above the oak... a short time did wonders for the beer, with patience this could be an excellent old ale."
"D: Another quality brew from Founders. It's hard to find anything that I don't like from them. The oak barrels are a nice touch giving this beer some nice flavor. Aging the remaining 3, we will see how they turn out."
"Taste is pretty hoppy with malt, sweetness and some citrus. The finish is quite creamy and the most interesting facet of this beer. High alcohol but easy to drink."
"I like this, but then, it's hard not to enjoy anything Founders puts into their barrels. But as stated numerous times in this review, Curmudgeon is very similar to Backwoods Bastard. So much so, that I would be happy to take a Backwoods over this any and every time. Good beer, but not great. But hey, Founders has that covered. ;-)"
"Well balanced, nice Old Ale and exceptionally drinkable in my opinion."
"I don't taste the molasses they mention having included, but it could have certainly contributed to the mouthfeel. Speaking of which, while sporting a micro drop of dry, musty oxidation, is nearly silky smooth, falling quite short of syrupy. Goddamn does it massage the palate while conjuring one of the most soothing warming feelings I've been treated to. The booze is softened expertly by the malt and semi-viscous body. They balanced the shit out of this ale. A winner!"
"Bottom Line: This brew is very well balanced and offers some great sweet tastes that aren't seen in many other brews. The intensity and richness make this one a sipper but with the superbly masked ABV, this can be hard to do. I do wish it was cheaper but you get what you pay for 10 fold here with Curmedgeon."
"D: It's a bigger beer than I had anticipated. However, I think with an additional year under the belt, this beer would even out nicely."
"D - Decent drinkability for almost 10% abv, but due to the flavor profile I wouldn't want more than one in a sitting."
"I poured this brew from a 12oz. bottle into a snifter. The reddish-brown color with a touch of sediment reminded me of the way apple cider would look in a snifter. There is very little head, with a little bit of lacing upon taking a few sips. It definitely smells sweet. A little bit like caramel. The taste is also sweet. Starts off a little bit sweet and I think I taste some hoppiness at the end, but it really isn't bitter at all, the aftertaste is still bit sweet. This is a thick, syrupy, sticky beer with a high alcohol content and I wouldn't want more than one in a sitting, but this is what I have come to expect from the style and I think it's delicious."
"Finish: this one lingers for quite some time with hops, and carmal sickyness"
"Notes: Nice brew, add the barrel aging and do we have the Backwoods Bastard? Not quite but there is something rather pleasing that reminds of that brew, and that stands very well on its own."
"I would recommend this beer as a great night cap eather after a long hard day of working outside in the elements or just to relax this is the beer to choose."
"Cheers!"
"D: A higher ABV makes this a sipper by the fire. A very well put together Old Ale."
"I like this crotchety old fella and will have it again, but I've also had other Old Ales that I like a bit better. It is definitely not sessionable, but makes for a good sipper. This is another fine offering from Founders, but certainly not their best."
"Drinkability: A fun and complex beer. Sweet, with lots of bite, so I am not sure I could drink this all night."
"Avoid for me."
"Pours a cloudy, amber color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. There is also suspended sediment. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of yeast, strong alcohol, slight oak, and slight citrus hops. Fits the style of an Old Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong alcohol, oak, slight citrus hops, slight yeast, and hint of sweet malt. Overall, overly strong in the alcohol, not very complex, but definitely warming."
"This beer is thick and smooth, with a bit of carbonation to lighten things up. Reasonably drinkable, considering the ABV, but I wouldn't want to have too many."
"D - Big sipper and mighty fine brew. This gets better as is reaches closer to room temperature. I will hoard the 4 pack I bought for special occasions over the next year and share with worthy beer geeks. This beer once again proves to me why I love Founders, just damn fine complex and delicious beer."
"Very unique flavor is imparted by the oak barrel aging. Not quite sure about it at first, but it rewards the drinker with subtle flavors when given the chance to present itself on a clean palate. I could see how this may turn-off some, but I would not hesitate to consume it as a night cap."
"O - A good sipper. Very enjoyable."
"lower carbonation, sticky body, but not too thick. the almost 2 years of aging has mellowed out any alcohol burn."
"Once I recovered, about mid-beer, from initial sugar shock I kinda got sick of this beer. A good night time reading companion but I couldn't ever imagining having more than one. Unless I put it on waffles."
"D- One of the best strong ales I've sampled- will likely get better over time, but in a young form it's not ""in your face"" strong and very repeatable."
"Drinkability is excellent, as there a fair amount here to discover. One or two is good for a single sitting, which is good, because, in addition to Founders quality, they have the Founders price point."
"a murky orange stirs, bubbles rise. A large pillar of foam rises in the center, gradually tucks away under itself to the sides. It is a stately affair, all the nobles are here. Foreign dignataries, the upper crust, Bono, of course, Bono. Stale and sweet fumes arise from the powdered wigs of the hallowed guests. Their breath is alcohol. This is an old ale for old money. A plate passes around the room, full or succulent grapes, fresh and dried, and dried apricots. Distinctly and with a stiff backbone, it slides down the throat, pricking with funk, the soul of James Brown. These old fogies can still get down. Get up (get on up). Long sweet finish, the harpsichord notes ring out, echoing in the high ceilings."
"D: A good sipper, I'll leave it at that. Would do better with some age on it."
"D- Its a sipper. Boozy bite makes it one to drink slow. Sweet and complex but strong and one to sip."
"D - One of these is plenty in a session. It isn't bad by any means, but it is purely one dimensional and I could have gotten roughly the same experience out of a bourbon and water. Wish I could say there is a bit more in here, but it is pretty basic in its complexity."
"I really wasn't quite sure what to expect with this style, as I'm fairly unfamiliar with it right now, but I was impressed and pleasantly surprised. It was an extremely complex brew but also quite tasty and drinkable. I kinda want to get a sixer and cellar some of it to see what would happen. Another superb offering from Founders. What a surprise."
"Poured with no head and a murky weathered copper color. Very thin wispy off white lacings lay on top after the pour. Sweet caramel malt, ripe apple, spice and oak aromas. Combined with the hint of alcohol, the smell is reminiscent of a light, sweet bourbon. Medium to full bodied with a thick mouth feel as the latent carbonation slowly comes to life. Sweet caramel malt and ripe apple flavors, hints of spice, finishes with an alcoholic burn and a pine hop flavor. Definitely a sipper that warms the soul."
"Think deeply of the ocean and keep a four-pack in a cooler as the waves lap the shores at night. Be one with the seas and stars."
"Taste is very wheaty oddly enough, it's a bit bitter and also quite malty. Theres some light caramel, and certainly a decent amount of alcohol. Overall quite decent."
"D- This is definitely a slow sipping beer, not to be abused. A buddy of mine aged his for about 2 years and it tasted a lot different than my batch which had just been bought at the time."
"D - The alcohol lets you know it's there, and delays you from pouring a second."
"This is a solid beer. I remember the first time that I had it I absolutely hated it, but now with a second go around and a better understanding of what an ""old ale"" is I can really appreciate this one. Perfect for a cooler autumn evening."
"Im not a huge fan of the style, but this is a solid take - A nice sipper on a cold night."
"D: This is a little light for the style but it is good. It's almost like a light wheat wine."
"Perhaps not a perfect representation of the style, but quite enjoyable and very easy to drink considering the style characteristics and abv."
"Nice comforting thick mouthfeel."
"Average mouthfeel; not too carbonated which works well for the ABV. This is a great sipper I'd love to compare to a fresh bottle. I really liked this a lot."
" The strong bitter note of piney hops is equalled by a strong caramel malt flavor with a candy like quality and slightly salty and acidic tinge from the high alpha hops with the flavors of alcohol and stone fruit essence. The hops have a woody character and mild acidity in the taste w/ a mild tanginess of grapefruit that is noted as it finishes. This old ale is a good beer, but I consider it slightly hop forward for the style. It is tasty and hoppy, but just misses the mark to be considered classic taste-wise. I enjoy it and the alcohol is mild which is nice, so it seem above avg all around to me."
"D- Great tasting brew. My first Old Ale, and glad to have it that way. I knocked down this score somewhat because the alc as I noted is VERY warming, and could see how more than one of this could get you in trouble. But I can't wait to try more in this style. I would almost classify this brew as a sipper, but the taste and the mouthfeel says otherwise."
"This is unexpected in a good way for the style, could be dangerous due to the ABV"
"One of the most interesting beers I have tried to date. It was bottled in 02/2010 giving it about 8 months to age. I would like to try it again both fresh and after aging at least 12 months. Enormous amount of malt flavor and aroma while hops do a nice job of keeping it interesting without dominating the senses. This one is definitely worth a try."
"O: Solid offering, but nothing special. I've had better from both the brewery and the style."
"The body is a balance of making a smooth, medium bodied mouth-feel."
"3.5/4/4/4.5/4"
"Mouthfeel is a bit viscous, but i think that's expected. Overall I really like this beer, and wouldn't mind drinking a couple of these."
"Overall I really liked this beer. It delivered what it claimed to be on the label."
"This somehow manages to remain pretty easy drinking even though the alcohol isn't all that well hidden. A decent beer but not quite sure I can really say it's anywhere near some of the great Founders brews I've tried."
"D: and Yum. seriously good, but not as good as Old Stock, or Third Coast."
"A very well crafted beer. Personally a bit too sweet for me. The dark fruit flavors almost seem a little rum-like. A very big beer with large palate."
"The taste of this brew is red wine like, along with a toasted dark bread bluntness... Very creamy and maybe a little oily slickness, and warming to the palate in the end."
"Pours slightly hazed orangeish brown with a thin head that becomes a wisp. Some vanishing lace sticks. The smell is of honey, caramel, nuts - reminiscent of honey-covered walnuts dipped in caramel. There is a fruitiness towards dates/prunes. The taste is sweet - honey and caramel - not catching the 50 IBU's. Sweetness balanced by an ashy smokiness that leaves a burnt aftertaste. The burnt character shows in some sips more than in others, oddly enough. Not digging that part, which puts a dent in the flavour. Alcohol present, but not too sharp or overwhelming. Full-bodied and a bit sticky. Mild carbonation does cut through the thickness."
"I'm never clear on where the line is drawn between an old ale and a barleywine - this beer could happily land in either category. Body is a bit syrupy, redolent with dark, aged fruit flavors - prune most apparentl A boozy edge is a slight detraction. Finish is smooth with a lasting caramel note."
"D - Sweet, oily and thick. OK for a pint, but not much more."
"D- too malty and a little too boozy for my tastes. Definitely a sipper"
"Overall this is an interesting beer. It reminds me of a sweet English B-wine after a year or so in the bottle"
"D: One glass is good. It is a little too spicy."
"This beer just either needs age or just is a rare strike for founders. I think most beer lovers will enjoy this beer, but it's just not up to par."
"Overall a very interesting beer, and quite different from what most American breweries are putting out these days. Certainly one I'll have again, but not in the same night."
"D: This beer tastes fine, but gives you a really good alcohol burn down in your esophagus. I doubt anyone would want more than one of these in a night."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a thin tan head that doesn't retain well. The aroma is a step up with notes of vanilla, molasses, oak, spiced rum, dark fruits (plum, fig, black cherry), floral hops and alcohol. The flavor starts out with spiced rum notes, along with caramel, molasses, vanilla and oak, as well as some cocoa and dark fruits, and a strong alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is thick and drinkability is OK. An intriguing if a bit cloying old ale, that is heavy on the oak and caramel flavors."
"The drinkability suffers a bit because of the alcohol burn in there. I find that it is this way with a lot of founders beers."
"D: Incredibly drinkable for an old ale, not the most complex or subtle I've had, but very enjoyable."
"Pours a gorgeous shade of dark orange amber. There was pretty much no head on this at all, but the slight ring of foam left on the glass leaves a very precise high water mark, like a ring around a bathtub. This makes me giggle. The aroma is very sweet with notes of caramel, golden raisins and sweet bread. There is also a bit of earthiness to it, but it's mostly just malt that I am picking up. The flavor is malty and wonderful. Plenty of caramel, brown sugar and toffee mix with a sharp hint of alcohol that works to further enhance the flavor. Also in the mix are raisins, sugary orange peel, some peppery earthiness and touch of honey. There seems to be just enough bitterness in this beer to keep it from being too malty. The mouthfeel is pretty damn impressive. It is not quite as full as one might expect, but also far from too thin. The finish a mile long, but not too sticky. A beer to savor, but a beer I would love to savor again. I am pretty sure my friend didn't purposely pick out an older bottle, but I am glad he did. I will have to seek out a fresher one for comparison."
"Drinkability is all right. Curmudgeon has some good aspects, but fails to really pull things off. I keep wanting to like the glass in front of me, but nothing really pulls me back. The beer is worth checking out if you like old ales or Founders, but otherwise its just a slightly above average old ale in the craft beer world."
"M/D - Has a medium syrup-like body, flat on the palate from low volumes of carbonation, and finishes sweet. The alcohol flavor complimented with the sweetness and thick-ish body make it a definite sipper but fun to drink."
"Pours a rich amber color, little to no head which quickly dissipates with very limited lacing. Strong oak and bread aromas. A definite sweet, thick, oak flavor with the thick consistency typical of a Founders brew, which doesn't quite hold up as well as the Stouts due to lesser complexity. Very subtle spice notes emerge through the alcohol and oak notes. Reminiscent of a good rye bread."
"Overall: I've had this one a couple of times before and I really want to cheer for it each time because Founders is one of the best in the biz. However, even after analyzing it in my session, this still remains one of my least favorite Founders brews."
"D - pretty good overall beer. I'm not too familiar with the style and will have to pick up more of these. Real smooth for the ABV. I enjoyed this and would pick up more."
"D - Good rep for the style especially with the addition of oak aging."
"D - Overall the bottle date kind of scared me but as a bourbon beer I was intrigued to try it and found it to be balanced and full of flavor with less sediment than the Nemesis 2009 and even cheaper at 4.25 a bottle! I believe this beer is pretty epic with age and may go back and get another. Still a very solid beer after a year and a half so bravo Founders!"
"D-This beer has average drinkability.The ABV isn't obvious or out of whack but it isn't balanced as well as it could be."
"Drinkability - give me 5 more, but you'll have to drive me home."
"Drinkability: Bold AND beautiful. A quality sipper, even on a day in South filled with 100-degree heat and 100-percent humidity."
"i look forward to buying this again."
"D - Surprisingly easy to drink for such a high ABV beer with big, bold flavors. I think I could go for a 2nd one."
"I was slightly disappointed when pouring this beer into the glass, as it had a small, fleeting head and was a clear reddish color. After beginning to sip, however, my disappointment left about as quickly as the beer's head. The beer smelled had a pleasant, alcohol laden smell. Kind of had a hint of whiskey to it. The taste is maltier than I expected given the color, but its not overwhelming. Again, kind of reminds me of a good bourbon. It isn't the smoothest beer in world, but is still pleasant. Very drinkable, and overall a great beer. Would gladly have another."
"Definitely a sipper, I don't think I could have two of these in a week, let alone in one night. However, it is enjoyable if you're in the mood for a hearty brew."
"Drinkability: While I can't see this being an everyday beer, I definitely will enjoy this again. I have 3 bottles left from my 4 pack that I want to age a little bit."
"D - Quite nice, though I prefer my Old Ale to be bitterer (and therefore hoppier.) Believe it or not, 'bitterer' is a word (according to MicrosoftWord) and it is more preferable in usage than 'more bitter'. So please go back, fellow BAs, and correct your verbiage in prior reviews, as I have done here."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being low. Drinkability is good, it was a very nice beer to sip on tonight after dinner. It had some great malty flavors to it and the alcohol wasn't bad at all for the abv%. Very enjoyable beer overall."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, oaky vanilla and malt. In the taste, oak, vanilla, a pinch of bourbon like flavor and small alcohol notes. A smooth body and medium to lighter mouthfeel, with a small dry alcohol and oaky aftertaste. Looks lighter than expected, and the mouthfeel is a bit thin too, but nice flavor!"
"This beer is darker amber with a little bit of redness. The smell is a complex blend of raisins, maple syrup, and a bit of cinnamon that i may or may not be hallucinating. The taste is sweet, but not overly so, with maple syrup, dark wine, and toffee with the alcohol nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is thicker with a small amount of carbonation. A good sipping beer, which evolves as it warms. Very enjoyable."
"Notes: Pretty average version of an Old Ale."
"All in all, this brew definitely followed suit with the first time I tried it. Just ok, not much special in this one. Not worth hunting and do not make this a priority to try if you have access."
"Beer is thick and syrupy. Very heavy. Its strong and heavy on the palate. This is much bigger than I expected but its still good. Overall an enjoyable big strong ale."
"D - One of these is enough at a time. It is an enjoyable experience, but I doubt I'd get the same kick out of a second. Not a session beer; enjoy this baby one at a time and let the others age."
"Honestly, this so-called ""Curmudgeon"" doesn't seem all that misanthropic to me. Just a colder-climate version o' good ol' Santiago. Something like that. Anyway, the beer pours a clear ruby, tinted slightly toward amber, topped by a short head o' ecru micro-foam. The nose comprises biscuits, walnuts, rich caramel, and a stinging underbelly of bright fruit. A healthy boozy feel slices through dully, marring the nasal proceedings. The taste continues the malty tradition set forth in the smell, in the process transmogrifying the fruit into a hoppy bitterness, strong and dull. A touch of leather rules the aftertaste. I can't call this a balanced flavor, but I won't go so far as to declare a state of koyaanisqatsi either. Hell, that damn droning is just annoying (and kinda boring after a while, too). Ahem. The body is a hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a very slight mouth-coating feel. Overall, an OK brew, but not one I would regularly pursue by any stretch of the imagination."
"Served: 7JUL2010"
"It pours a redder color than when fresh; the nose has noticeably diminished to a shell of itself - some oak and mellow vanilla notes are present, though; the taste, however is superb - malty, caramelly sweetness upfront moves on to a slight tobacco, cognac, and toasted/burnt malt flavor ; this finishes with a slight aged hop bitterness mixed with oak, and a really nice vanilla pop. Fantastic taste! The alcohol has noticeably settled and makes for a very easy drinking ale."
"D- I can't say that I would reach for another one of these but you are supposed to age it and so I will and see where it takes me. There is just a weirdness right now that makes me want to stay away."
"D: I'll get another one and hold onto it for a long while .... let it get even older. I think perhaps this one was a bit too young."
"D: An all around great strong beer, not too over the top but a very enjoyable brew"
"M/D: Medium to fuller body. Pretty smooth over the palate. Low, and very soft carbonation. Drinkability is pretty low for this since its a malt bomb. Intense woody and candied malt flavors and the alcohol factor bring down the drinkability. More of a sipper. Something about this makes me think of fall. Its good, but I can't see myself ever having more then one in a night."
"Had as a single in a mix 6 pack of Michigan beers. Cool label that fits the name. Pours a golden orange, bit hazy, no head or lacing. Sweet oak whiskey smell. Very inviting. Taste follows nicely with whiskey and dried dark fruits. Warm mouthfeel with much smoother taste / feel than the alcohol content would suggest. Could drink a few."
"M & D - Very oily and viscous nice full body. Dangerous drinkability for a beer with such high ABV."
"Summary: I like this ale for it's immediate alcohol slam. I'm sitting here on Father's Day afternoon and enjoying the good buzz as I finish this beer. I'm sitting in my screened in porch and waiting for my Old Curmudgeon neighbor to walk by so I can yell something rude at him. This ale brings out the best in me! Founder' remains one of my favorite brews for flavor, quality and unique variety of beers."
"Full bodied, with some carbonation - and it is needed to clear for the next sip. And that is how this drinks -- a pure sipper. This is not summer beer, but winter in the easy chair or fireside in the fall. This one is a bit hot (alcohol), almost to a fault. If the booze was toned down, I could see having more than one at a time. Since it isn't, I'm one and done. Decent beer, but to be had as a change of pace or a seasonal treat."
"I poured into my glass to a small light tan head. It is a ruddy amber color. I get a nice toasted caramel scent along with some alcohol. It also has a bready smell in there, too. The taste is pretty much the same with the tasted caramel malt, but it does lack the alcohol in the taste that I got on the nose. The mouthfeel is exactly what I like, nice and viscous. Overall, it is a pretty solid beer."
"On tap at the Brass Rail today during lunch. Served in a Sam Adams perfect pint glass it appears a clear amber color with some lighter orange colors around the edges and a thin lacing of yellowish tanned head. Spotty amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is of sweet malty grains with a touch of orange character. Taste has a welcoming warmth of alcohol that is also solvent in flavor upfront with a sweet malty caramel backing and light citrus hop bitterness that mingles with a flavor of bitter orange rind. The hop bitterness lingers in the mouth with a bit of a resine-like piney flavor. Medium to heavy body with a light amount of carbonation. Other flavors of grain linger in the mouth. As it warms, more residual sugars come out in the taste much like dark sugar akin to caramel that has somewhat of a smokey quality about it. Overall pretty decent but doesn't have the wowing factor that I have come to expect from most Founder's offerings."
"Overall it is one beautiful looking and beautifully scented brew, the taste is good but not spectacular."
"Overall, a great brew that compares favorably to the only beer I've given all 5's to, North Coast Old Stock, and is certainly worth your time."
"Overall, a really nice and readily available (now that Founders is in NY!) beverage."
"Comes out of the tap a bubbly semi-transparent dark honey golden - the way it was poured I wasn't able to comment on the head. Malty aroma has a honey-sweet overtone. Malty, lively flavor has hints of spice, a nice alcohol bite and a hoppy undertone. Edgy, fizzy texture has a fierce, brandy-like bite."
"D: Pretty strong brew but good enough to have a few."
"D-very good Old Ale, I would get it again. Not sure I could have more than one at a time, but it is great for what it is"
"This brew poured a cloudy orangish red with a beautiful head to it. The smell is amazing. Sweet malts with vanilla and a slight fruitiness. I also get a hint of whiskey. I'm not sure how this beer is made, but I could swear that it's aged in whiskey barrels, because I get such a strong whiskey taste after sipping it. It's delicious. Sweet cherries, vanilla, and whiskey in this wonderfully complex ale. Love it!"
"D: a great sipper if there ever was one. This brew shows the oak well, with heavy vanilla notes. This is one of my favorite Old Ales/Barleywines out there."
"Overall this was a very well done old ale and does a great job of hiding the alcohol. Worth a shot."
"There is an initial bite of hops that comes back on the exhale but soothed midway by sweet caramel, molasses flavors. I'm getting through this faster than expected, the complexity makes each sip entertaining to dissect. The alcohol is disguised dangerously well. Smooth textures, carbonation struggles to get through the viscosity. As an old ale I find it over all very interesting, I wouldn't drink this with a meal its pretty filling and it's got a lot of flavors going on already."
"Drinkability- easy drinking for sure as this beer walked way more of a balance then I even had expected with malt and hop, goes down dangerously fast hard to tell this is 9.8 percent at all, while this beer is certainly good not sure yet if I would call it great rather just solid, oak adds a nice touch and the heat of abv is minimal to none, I feel though it would made it less balanced I was almost hoping for a bit more malt from this than amount of hop they threw in, at very least I would certainly try this again"
"Pours a hazy dark honey color with a smallish tight head that settles into a ring. The aroma is faint, did not pick up much, perhaps a touch of scorched caramel & toffee. The taste has a very mellow toffee and vanilla flavor, nothing sharp, quite smooth and sweet. The flavor is different from most old ales, seems to focus on vanilla. I worried that it might be cloying but it never does, very good. A moderate feel with tingly carbonation which helps cut the potential cloyingness of the brew. The ABV is no where to be found. This is a very tasty old ale. I like the vanilla profile. I am interested to see what some age does to this brew."
"There is a prominent nose of fruit/malt with hints of wood and aging. Raisins and a touch of alcohol. Warming, and robust as you move through the bottle. An excellent winter warmer. As noted by others the classic modest carbonation of Founder's brews appears again. Fortunastely, for me this what I love any time of year. To me contrary opinions suggest this would say that I wouldn't want another glass of a full cab, or that I wouldn't be having a vintage port in the summer. Folks, this is an awesome sipping beer for any time. I agree with previous reviewer that I will age a few. For those who enjoy a full, warming sipper to enjoy as you relax at end of day...rush to purchase!"
"Is Founders great or what?"
"D - On the mouthfeel still, the carbonation is pretty limited and this is an area Founders routinely excels in - they never overcarbonate their beers and they don't have to. The flavors and uniqueness of all their brews speak for themselves. Another - not only great - but spectacular beer from Founders. It's very filling though and you probably can't have more than 1. One of my very favorite breweries. Will be buying this again very soon."
"Wow,hmmm...I don't think this is aged in bourbon barrels, but definitely has a bourbon like flavor. Raisin flavor is a little strong. Medium body, high carbonation...boozy. This beer has some resemblences to Bad Habit Quad by Founders. Overall, a good beer...but closer to a Belgian style dark ale than an Old Ale in my oppinion."
"D- This beer is always a struggle for me and I don't know why. I enjoy the taste but it is always a sipper for me. It is always a welcome for me but sometimes too much for me to finish. One of a few beers that is like that for me."
"another good offering from founders, thankful that they're distributing in NY now - glad to have tried this."
"D: I don't think I could have more than one of these in a sitting but it's definitely a good beer to sip."
"drinkability: great winter warmer beer, enjoyed as usual with founders."
"Drinkability- My bottle has a date of 02/24/09. Should of waited a little longer and let the hops fade some more. But still a very good example of the style."
"I'm not sure if it's the temperature or if this is just a bad bottle, but the strong hoppy/solventy nature in the middle is quite overpowering and makes this a little bit of a chore to drink. It is reminiscent of Nemesis 2009, but in a bad way, as the barrel aging notes and the base character of the beer are a bit similar, but the strength of flavor that, with Nemesis 2009, works so well, in this beer works to its detriment. Perhaps I'll have to attempt another bottle, or maybe I just have an aversion to curmudgeons in general."
"Bottle pours a very dark amber using the Duvel glass. The taste is of roasted dark malts with dark fruits lingering in a delicious treat. The second best old ale I have had compared to 4th Dementia. This was very damn easy to drink as I didn't detect the 9.8% at all. Very smooth, and quite delicious. I will definately pick this beer up again."
"A good sipper for a nightcap - goes well paired with chocolate cookies."
"Medium body beer with slight carbonation. Alcohol isn't over powering , however, if you didn't sip the first one, you should consider sipping the second. A nice ale by Founders"
"D= Great Old ale! This is one of my new faves. I can't believe it isn't rated higher. This is an excellent brew."
"Medium, not too thick mouthfeel. Not as boozy as expected. A nice sipper."
"D-this is a delicious brew i tried mine after keeping it for about 4 months and cant wait to try the rest of the four packs over the next year, a great beer but way better with some age"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, this one is a dark amber color, with a thin off-white head. Aromas of roasted malt, dark fruit and oak. Oak is there on the palate as well, with sweet malt, vanilla and hints of bourbon. Alcohol is present, but not overbearing. Smooth, appropriately carbonated and fairly drinkable for the alcohol level. Another good offering from Founders."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable considering the big malt attack this beer summons. Alcohol might sneak up on you though."
"Drinkability is good and pretty easy drinking considering the abv. I think its better as one a night sipping beer just because I feel the alcohol might creep up on you. Overall a pretty good brew! I would have another."
"The beer pours a dark amber, almost orange color with a thin off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm, burnt toffee scent that's rich and full of alcohol. The taste is good as well. It has a dry, alcohol driven feel that's loaded with caramel malt and burnt toffee sweetness. It goes down slow and easy with a nice bit of warmth in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very solid old ale. It's brewed to style and drinks well."
"As for drinkability, the first glass went down way to easy, and I was well into my second glass when the gravity of this brew sank in. Probably a good idea to sip it, but it's pretty good if you don't too. :-)"
"D: A very nice old ale and a good beer to sip on throughout an evening."
"Drinkability: VERY Drinkable! Easily drink a 4 pack. 9.8% Alcohol and NO BURN?! Watchout!"
"The rust colored body was clear, quite still, and was topped by a small layer of bubbles. The smell was bready and honey sweet, with a late spicy flourish. The taste was very sweet as expected, with the flavors evoking hard candy, pears, and maple syrup. Very rich on the tongue due to the high sugar content. Alcohol was not as evident as I was anticipating. Not much hop presence. The sweetness pretty much overpowered all other senses and drove down the drinkability a bit."
"A very malty beer to be sure, but also a very nuanced one at the same time. Try it sometime!"
"This is very good, I want to age some but the twist offs make me leary."
"D- It has great flavor and makes for a nice winter sipper. It's very nicely done."
"However, Founders brews several beers that are arguably my favorite of each's respective style (Breakfast Stout, Red's Rye, and Porter), so I'm not sure I could bring myself to purchase it over those other more sessionable beers. Although, I will certainly be excited if it's offered to me again! I'd love to try some of this stuff with some age on it."
"A fairly good, but green beer. I think that as it ages the alcoholic notes will be replaced by malty richness, and this will be delightful in a few years' time."
"Drinkability: This review is on an 09 bottle. I'll say that when it's early, it can perhaps be too heavy on the alcohol. But with just a year, this thing gets really smooth and is one of my favorites by Founders."
"I enjoyed this beer however this seems more like a barleywine than an old ale. Has a distinct oxidized sherry, raisin flavor. The nose is a bit off-putting but flavor in the mouth is much more agreeable. Drinks very well for nearly 10%. Body is lighter than expected. The others tasting this commented that they wouldn't drink more than one but I surely could down several"
"D - Glad I only bought a single, definitely something I am thankful for trying but certainly 1 will be enough for me."
"A grand achievement."
"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Drinkability is ok, between the high abv and the overall sweet taste and alcohol presence, this is a one-and-out nightcap type of beer."
"D.) Excellent for the ABV, I could easily enjoy one or two more, Unfortunately I only bought one :-("
"Overall: Complex + pretty tasty. Probably not for everyone, but a good sipper. Not an A+, but not a D- either by any means. (By the way the picture of the bottle on this site has a lovely background, it really brings out the grizzled old man on the bottle)"
"Cheers!"
"Pours a very dark black like color with no head. The aroma is of a maple syrup and caramel malt backbone with dark fruits (raisins, dates, and figs) present and a touch of some breadiness. The taste is of a maple syrup backbone on top with dark fruits and some caramel with a slight taste of alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick with a slight amount of carbonation, it does sit a little heavy on the tongue. Overall the drinkability is okay for the style, it is very complex in nature and keeps you interested, a little thicker than some though."
"D: At 9.3% this is big beer and fairly drinkable, the complexity and slight boozy quality makes it a little less drinkable, but pretty nice overall. Wish I had these guys around here...."
"D: Slightly syrupy with a little bit of a medicinal edge--Hard to say if it will improve with age, probably worth a shot though."
"D/Overall - I actually am enjoying it. It's above average, thats for sure. Founders seems to be consistently delivering for me. Higher alcohol, my second beer for the night, and I'm already feeling it halfway through my glass, so probably my last. Nice warm beer for the weird winter we're having in Michigan."
"I bought two bottles, and I refuse to touch the other one."
"Pours a reddish orange with good head and lacing throughout...as usual pouring agressively. Smells of fruit and malts. I can sense the sweetness before tasting. Taste is very complex with cherry, raisins, and hops are prevelent. Mouthfeel is carbonated but not too much. Very drinkable as the higher ABV is so well masked almost as well as any high gravity beer I have ever sampled."
"Drinkability is moderate. The ABV is relatively high, but well incorporated and easily managed. The flavor profile is decent, although it's not the best old ale I've run into. A nice drinker though."
"Overall, a very tasty beer I will have again"
"Not bad, but not one of Founders better offerings. This almost seems like it was whiskey barrel aged, and the barrel has taken over. Considering this is not barrel aged, that is a little off putting. However, it is a nice beer for a night cap, and worth a try."
"When drinking this i kept thinking it would be a great beer for somebody who loves Cognac, with its bit of hotness, sweetness,loads of flavor, and smooth mouthfeel. This beer is what i personally want from an drink Old Ale, as i like a little hotness. I will buy this often."
"Believe this ones from early 09. Still had the twist off top, and opened with quite a pop. Poured into a snifter, quite a bit of floating sediment. Dark brown with some amber highlights. Head faded quick and is remaining only as a soapy looking ring around the glass. Aroma is a malt bomb on this one, huge caramel presence. Some brandy aromas and a good booziness. The malts are forefront in this aroma. Exceptionally sweet and malty on the palate, super silky. The silky mouthfeel accentuates the maltiness of this brew. Has some tart flavors as well, almost like bing cherries. Big and sweet but with an underlying tartness. As stated before, the mouthfeel makes this beer what it is. So smooth and drinkable, must age well because from what I can tell, this is almost a year old."
"I'm curious how this ages - there are some notes that if emphasized would render it undrinkable, while others would make a delectable curiosity. Fresh, it is the peer of many (though not all) British examples I've sampled. Probably not the normal place to start my Founders journey, but I'll take what I can get :-)."
"Drinkability- A bit too strong on the alcohol and too syrupy to make it very drinkable but quite tasty so its still very good :)"
"I poured this awful beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was the color of gasoline. The beer poured with no head at all. The beer smelled sour and had a sour taste that was not pleasant at all. Little bit of a burn to it and earthy tasting. I will not buy again."
"Really a very good beer that, given a couple of years, should really round out and become even more enjoyable. We shall see."
"Pours a semi-opaque dark ruby-brown with a soft, subdued head that leaves behind little lacing. Aromas of honey, astringent, alcohol (boozy) and roasted nuts. The taste is dominated by alcohol and malt as would be expected for this style. Hints of ripened fruit, honey and dry herbs seem to come out in the finish. Make no mistake this beer is all about sugary, spicy malt. The mouthfeel is thick and succulent with plenty left for me to enjoy after a sip. The drinkability takes a hit because of the boozy nature of this beer but still an excellent example of this style and one that I enjoy in the winter."
"D - This took a little while to get used to, but very drinkable. The slightly higher level of bitterness helps offset the sweet, syrupy characteristics."
"D - This beer is slightly over the top in terms of sweetness... Oddly though that only seems to add character of this brew... Founders makes one brew after another that push boundaries and this is not exception..."
"Opaque toffee-brown-ish color with small head and little lacing. Smell is sweet with some raisons, toffee, and a bit of alcohol. Taste is really good and near the same level as Adam. Dark fruit, caramel, molasses, and vanilla all make this one tasty. Very creamy and full-bodied. Delicious. A great sipper that will warm you up, more great stuff from Founders."
"Considering the abv, the drinkability is very good. Can't wait for this to age."
"Taste is sweet with caramel, honey, and raisins present. The finish is roasted, with almost a smokiness, and slightly dry and bitter. There is a hint of dark fruit in the background too. Mouthfeel is thick and full bodied."
"This one is worth holding on to for a while."
"I like it alot in the late fall and winter at the fire."
"Wow! I continue to be impressed by the brews coming from Founders, but this may be the best. I can't wait to age a few of these bad boys."
"This is an old ale I'd recommend for anyone getting into the style. Its ABV is actually moderate for the style, and it doesn't need a ton of age to go down smoothly while still being quite flavorful."
"D - Really liked this the ABV is well hidden and while not having too many would definately have another."
"Mmmm, this beast is dangerously drinkable...so smooth. Sweet malts are deliciously caramel and toffee. Really good brew! Just a touch of hop bitterness rounds things out on the back end and there is a whole wheat bread yeastiness that comes through nicely. I dont see how this could get too much better with more aging as it is drinking so good right now. Alcohol is camouflaged so well, barely detectable until you feel a little belly warming. Pretty amazing beer, another winner from Founder's."
"Pours a brownish amber color, hazy, with a moderate head. Aroma is of hops, with citrus and fruity notes as well as molasses. Taste is very sweet - molasses and caramel, with a slight hint of pine. Fills the mouth with a full flavor. But offers a quick finish."
"D - While this might not exactly qualify as a session beer, I found this to be very drinkable. I think the high level of bitterness really helps offset the sweet, slightly syrupy aspects."
"Coppery color with a thin wisp of head. Very little retention with pretty much no lace. The aroma is sweet with toffee, vanilla, caramel and butterscotch all swirling around though overall it was leaning towards the weak side. Those aromas show through in the flavor that is heavily toffee-like with a sturdy butterscotch note in the background. The mouthfeel was pleasant. The sweetness was restrained and I didn't find it overly sticky and a fair amount of carbonation helped to lift the heavy body off the palate. It was good overall but I found myself wanting more. It lacked a certain wow factor to bring it over the top but I was happy to drink it."
"CHEERS!!"
"One finger of orange-tan hued head, mostly dense foam but all kinds of bubble sizes found, foamy lacing as well, clings then slowly slides downwards. Brick red, rust color to more dark amber orange further out, warm and murky glow throughout. Sweey, jiggling jelly roll of a nose, brown sugar and molasses, sure, also coconut shavings, orange marmalade, crème brûlée and French vanilla ice cream, satisfyingly sweet but not insipidly ingratiating, firms up as it sits in your nostrils. Medium-bodied and actually a lot lighter in its feet than one might expect given the sweetness factor. Molasses, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon and coconut cream waste no time in asserting themselves, soft and inviting, at the same time the carbonation subtly lifts things up and prods them forward. Rich peach, apricot, nectarine fruit flavors too while tangerine and pink grapefruit citrus abounds. Full finish that fills the belly and makes you want to refill the empty glass."
"Even taken as a boozy sipper, it really is not all that great. If I wanted to sip on booze, I'd go for some fine bourbon on the rocks, not a boozy old ale."
"Poured a small tan head on top of a dirty brown body. A great whiskey and caramel malt aroma with some woodiness and roasted malt along with hints of berry fruits. A medium body that passes smooth with a just a little roughness - osome type of oakiness makes it go down easy with small amounts of bready and roasted malts behind a large chunk of sweet malt. Little bit of fruity hops balances this stick, slow sipper and the ABV complements it with a dry backbite. Just a quality sipper that is very enjoyable."
"This is a pretty good beer. Nice and full bodied and warming."
"Drinkability: Really enjoyed this four pack. A delicious sipper. Sweet, malty, and delicious."
"Poured a cloudy, reddish brown with small head that quickly reduced to a collar. The aroma came through as boozy and the smell of old wood. The taste was malty sweet caramel with a taste of vanilla and alcohol. A slightly bitter aftertaste when away as Curmudgeon warmed. The feel was full bodied with low carbonation. Drinkability was reasonably good. As old ales go, not as good as Adam, but a very respectable entry from Founders."
"D: As I said before, this is a sipper. It loses points in drinkability since it is only enjoyable in small doses. My serving was approx 10 oz, which was perfect. But anymore would have been overwhelming."
"Drinkability: The flavours are so incredibly well rounded and moreish that it is dangerously drinkable. There isn't a hint of alcohol in the taste, which for a beer that almost reaches 10% is a fantastic achievement. I love it."
"D - I really like this one. Can't believe I have not reviewed before."
"D: Very good, but probably shouldn't be. I was expecting a much more complex, heavy-hitting style of beer with this one and what I got was a very good, but shallow and thin old ale."
"D: good, a bit boozy and dry drinking much bigger then its advertised 9.8% abv. Your not gonna be drinking to many of these at one time, best sampled by itself in a chalice or goblet at a moderately warm temp (55-60F) on a chilly winter night."
"This is an excellent beer...very warming, but not overly alcoholic (in the taste, anyway). It is well balanced, malty, and has some very good oak and whiskey notes. It is pungent and delicious, and therefore one to be savored."
"Feel and Drinkability: Moderately carbonated and medium-heavy in body. I think that carbonation could be a bit lower and still this beer would work, if not work better. I feel that the carbonation here is just to aggressive, the bubbles are fine in texture, but they just attack so vigorously that I think it takes away from the beer a bit. At first its fine, its after the brew's been in the mouth a bit, somewhere around mid palate that they all aggressively break out and assualt the palate. I think it could be toned down a bit, but by no means is this a fault, but in my opinion it could be better. This is an extremely drinkable beer, and dangerous especially on a day such as this. 60 some degrees in the middle of summer, breezy out, refreshing air, the smell of fall in the wind...it would be real easy to get real wasted easily with this one in hand. I'll definitely enjoy the rest of these. For me, on a day like this this beer is just as a good novel that takes you away, away from reality for just a bit...to escape the real world for a while. Awesome."
"Drinkability: A very fine example of an old ale; not quite chewy enough to be a barleywine, but filled with complexity"
"Conclusion: This is a great English-style Old Ale....it's got absolutely fantastic aromas, some really nice flavors, and overall makes me glad it's getting to be winter brew time...this is the way I like my Old Ales: Malt bombs where the hops stay in the background. I'm looking forward to aging one or two of these and seeing how it changes with time."
"Overall: good drinkability, especially considering the ABV. Awfully sweet but still good, the sweetness has a nice roasty/toasty component which makes it more interesting."
"Some initial sips are a tad rough, in the sense of a hard liquor swig from a Maker's Mark drink. Yet, the complexity of the beer (especially) as it warms, becomes a warming monster at 9.3% ABV. More flavors of light milk chocolate too. An enjoyable and flavorful old ale."
"Overall - A pretty good example of an old ale... well worth a try"
"Pours a dark copper with a nice white head. The aroma is that of dark and tart fruits mixed with sweet malt. The taste is quite sweet with a little bit of bread. A bit of the fruity sweetness as well. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very nice, and becomes a lovely sipper as it warms up."
"Saw this on the shelves on a recent trip back to MI, haven't had it so I had to pick it up. Poured from the bottle into a mini snifter beer is a clear, deep ruby-orange color with a thin head comprised of many fine bubbles which quickly dissipates to just a thin ring around the snifter. Small bits of lacing are left around the glass. The nose is slightly subdued with sweet dark fruit like raisins and figs dominating and slight fusel alcohol also present. The taste has another dimension of fruity complexity, slightly sweet with lots of dextrins, bittered almost to balance but still slightly sweet. The mouthfeel is full bodied with an almost dead carbonation and a dry, alcohol finish. As far as drinkability goes, this is definitely a sipper. A good beer for a night cap sitting by a fire on a cold winters evening."
"Overall I can't say I hate or love it. I would definitely have it again, but only when I'm in the mood for something sugary."
"A definite sipper, I'm actually liking this."
"D = It tastes good and goes down easily but it also gets a bit cloying, so I cannot recommend it as having high drinkability."
"Taste strong. Rye bread. Earth and soil. Strong. Alcoholic. Caramel. Much flavor. Thick. Fruit. Rum. Raisins. Rum raisins. Bitterness. Tannins. Grain. This is beer. Hello."
"D: Very, which makes it a dangerous brew at this ABV."
"Overall, I know this is an old ale and thus going to have a lot of alcohol, but the heat is just to much for me. I am slowly sipping on this one and it will take a while to finish. It is good, but I bet a few years might do serve it well."
"D- A decent brew that didn't quite live up to expectations."
"D: This is a very nice old ale. Definitely one of my favorites. This one is a bit young, but still fantastic. I bet it will age with the best of em. The toughest part about aging this beer will be the waiting. It may not make it another year or two. If I see another 4-pack, I'm picking one up."
"D: A decent beer. But Old ales raise my expectations and this one didn't really meet them. There are far better examples of the style."
" All in all not a bad beer. Not something that will be on my list of keeping around the house. For the 10.99 a four pack, I would rather be drinking a Dirty Bastard for 8.99(which is quite delicious, by the way)."
"D: A total malt bomb with oak to intensify the effect. It was a bit much for me. If you like whiskey, though, it might be up your alley."
"I found this highly drinkable for a high alcohol beer, and could have easily had a second."
"This has an alcoholic burn to it but it's expected at 9.3%. This is a sipper, but enjoyable."
"A summary on this brew would be; fairly on all accounts; tasty, boozy, sweet and drinkable. Rates a B grade perfectably."
"D - The jury's still out; not sure how to rate it. I'd drink it again and I suspect it's better on tap."
"Pours sediment-free, brown-amber hue with small white head. A gorgeous scent of cranberries, caramel, spice, slight egg nog, and a buttery, vanilla cream character. Whew! Tasty stuff. That buttery vanilla cream begins and lingers through to the aftertaste. Toffee, caramel, spice, dried apple skins, sweet alcohol seeps through the thick flavors during the finish mostly. Light carb in body with a mildy thick, syrupy mouthfeel. This is a dangerously tasty ale at over 9% ABV and wonderful to sit down with and consider closely."
"Nice beer, the alcohol heat is the downfall in terms of drinkability though. Worth buying maybe once a year, but I wouldn't want it much more than that."
"D: This was a very surprising brew, not much of an Old Ale it reminded me of an English Barleywine (and not a great one at that). The flavors didn't seem to flow together very well and to be honest the whole brew felt a bet messy. It was a still a decent brew but certainly not up to the high standards I have for Founders. Try it if you're looking for something unique but don't expect an Old Ale."
"This was quite a disappointment for me especially since I love pretty much everything from Founders and enjoy the occasional old ale. I will have to revisit again in the future."
"-Bye"
"Drinkability: This is a drinkable beer in the sense that it will be easy to have another some other day. The combination of the high ABV and the sweetness though make it a sipping beer and something to finish off the night with rather than a beer to drink during an evening of dinner and conversation with friends."
"Note: I also tried this in a wine glass and to be perfectly honest: It tastes better. The flavor is still strong, but it doesn't bombard the palate like it did in the pint glass."
"Overall, a good beer. Tough to drink more than one due to the ABV, but a solid brew."
"Pours a copper color with no head. Smell is of sweet caramel malt, a variety of fruit, and a whiff of alcohol. This is a sweet beer with noticeable alcohol, and hop bitterness which makes this one nicely balanced. Can taste pears and dark fruits. Medium to full bodied, well carbonated. The drinkability is good, but the alcohol is more noticeable than I would like. This is still a good beer which I would buy again."
"Poured from the bottle to a nice brownish orange with thick off-white head gthat lingered to mid glass and left decenrt lacing. Nose is a nice, pleasant mix of malted dark fruit, faint spices and a touch of alcohol (bourbon). Mouthfeel is full and a little thick, and the taste adds some brown sugar to the scents of the nose. Long warming finish tops this one off."
"D - Moderate drinkability. ABV is pretty potent. Not filling. Taste is pretty smooth, but does become dominant on the palette."
"It's a good example of style and quite drinkable if you like the style."
"Nice, would buy in winter, as the alchohol would warm up the cold and the sweetness reminds me of christmas ho ho ho"
"Overall- I was gonna get this, but at 15 bucks a 4 pack-- I backed off. I had to get it when I saw it on tap. I'd say definitely get it if you see it on tap, but don't bother getting a 4 pack....unless you love old ales..."
"Another great beer from Founders. I need to start doing a Founders collection in my cellar."
"D - A little too odd to have more than one at a time. This is definitely a weirdo brew for sipping and picking apart all of the crazy rubbery smoke flavors, not pint after pint sessioning."
"This bottle was a year or two old, pretty sure I picked it up sometime in 2007 or 2008."
"Delicious on-tap. Poured a hazy chestnut with a short, creamy head, and some rough lacing. Smells sweet with some brandied eggnog aromas. Tastes similar. Very long flavors, sweet and creamy and rich with notes of vanilla, nutmeg, cinammon, and cardomom, with a pleasant boozy note. Very creamy and smooth as well as rich in the mouth. Big and delicious."
"Taste is full and malty, some nice alcohol warming drifts through. Some caramels mix with resinous hops, honey oozing around, rum soaked dark fruits through the finish. Mouth is full, warm, a bit slick with nice, fine carbonation. In all, quite a tasty beer, rather enjoyed it."
"Drinkability - One is good enough for me to sip and enjoy. This is an interesting beer."
"Drinkability: Although it is hoppy I would have another but not on the same night."
"D: Tastes like diabetes. Disgustingly sweet, and a drain pour about halfway through -- and this is from someone who is generally to cheap to waste beer. Yecch."
"D: A highly drinkable (and good value) old ale/barleywine with well-hidden alcohol and succulent sweet notes that blend together exceptionally smoothly. Another hit for Founders."
"Taste up front is sweet malts; then come the dark fruity flavors. The sip finishes with a little sticky sweetness, and a warming alcohol presence that lingers for awhile even after the sweetness fades. There is little carbonation in this medium-full bodied beer, and it makes a nice slow sipper. Reminiscent of a barleywine? I would have guessed that's what it was classified as if I didn't read it was an Old Ale. Very enjoyable, as everything from Founders has been so far."
"Overall, one of the best Old Ales I've had the pleasure of quaffing. Prefer it to Bell's Third Coast Old Stock Ale...I think (need to check out that second bottle in my cellar closet)."
"pours a dark orange thick looking brooding ale with minimal head and lacing..the smell is strong its malts and caramel with some banana and vanilla bean smells the taste is strong its a malt driven ale with a strong alcohol taste almost to me like a liquor i detect some bourbon and toffee its thick ..the mouhfeel is full bodied malty and sweet with the b4 mentioned tastes and smells.founders is an outstanding brewery with many on my rotation.. this old ale is a sipper and not my style or preference..all though i can tell its well made its just not my thing low scores are due to this not the quality of this ale or the brewer"
"D - Funky for most and definitely a sipping beer. It took me about 40 minutes to finish this and when I did my face felt like it was on fire. I want to get more of this gem but I think I'll wait for a cold winter day to continue enjoying this."
"Served: in an oversized wine glass."
"Drinkability: Another good sipping beer from Founders, who continues to impress me. Watch out Bell's!"
"Drinkability: Well, this is a sipper. Big and bold flavors and bigger alcohol would prevent this from being something that's especially drinkable. A great tasting offering though, doesn't quite rank up there with the Old Stock in my estimation, but still pretty damn good."
"T&M&D: This beer has a strong, bourbon like flavor that will smash you in the balls and give you a good talking too (especially at 9.8%ABV). Because of the strength of this ale- both in flavor and ABV, I can't imagine drinking more that one."
"Too much to handle. I had two in one night and felt like I had been drinking all day and night. Very strong."
"Reviewed on 06/05/2009. Bottle at PPRBSG09. This beer pours a cloudy orange. Aroma of sweet malt and vegetal notes. The flavor is equally gross (although slightly mellower) but still lots of sweet sticky malt and vegetation. This beer was not my thing at all..."
"Drinkability: A well balanced old ale, this is very good for the style and one of the better ones I have had. If I am looking for this style, I will seek this one out. One is about the max due to abv."
"It pours a orange amber color with very minimal head. The nose is rather interesting. I'm getting hints of caramel and fruit. It's fairly sweet smelling with the alcohol right there too. The taste was a WOW. It hit me right in the taste buds.It's very sweet and bitter at the same time. It has a malty carmel flavor with a good hop bite. The alcohol is present in every sip. It seems kind of thin in the mouth. The light carb helps. Needless to say this is a sipper. Not my favorite style but a nice beer none the less."
"Drinkability: Like many of Founders beers, the complexity of the flavors make this a stand alone beer - wouldnt want to ruin the experience by drinking too much before or after."
"Pours a rich, beautiful dark amber with a tightly knit tan head. The head is reasonable persistent, but does start to dissipate. Nicely developing Belgian lace. Rich, winy nose, with hints of cognac. Caramel, toffee, sherry, and dried fruits. Very moderate, but noticeable, hoppiness, with lingering caramel and malt notes on the palate. The roof of the mouth gets a sense of the level of alcohol, however, the alcohol level is not fully evident. Thus ""caveat bibor"" is appropriate. This is not a session beer or a vorspiel beer. Medium body with a sweet, long lingering. This is a multidimensional old ale. If I had the patience and cellar, I would attempt to age the Old Curmudgeon a few years to see how it develops. It should age well. A great ale to accompany hearty food and BBQ. The richness and residual sweetness would also work well with spicy food."
"This poured a dark, clear mahogany with some tan head. It smelled like a malty mix of toffee, brown sugar, old honey (like when it gets really thick and pasty), prunes, and fresh wheat, and a bit of orange. It tasted like honey wheat, toffee, raisins and prunes, and a bit of copper and orange and alcohol. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a mild bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a pretty good old ale with a nice, malty taste that was sweet but not over the top. It had good body too, and kept the alcohol mostly in check. So this was pretty easy to drink fresh, but I can easily see this improving with some age (1-3 years...maybe longer?). This is a solid beer, although it's not my favorite for this style. An oaked version of this could put it up there, but otherwise its personality was just not quite distinct enough."
"This is a tasty brew, for sure. Lots of sweet flavors, decent complexity even if all the flavors (sans the wood) hit the same point on the tongue. Have one with dessert."
"Blipped ""Curmudgeon"" by Nirvana"
"Overall a nice beer, not the best Old Ale I've had. Some interesting flavors throughout. Supremely drinkable given its size."
"Overall a great brew. I am going to immediatly seek out a case for the cellar to see how this champ does!"
"Ruby chestnut brown with tons of tiny suspended particles visable. Slight finger of fine tan foam that quickly melts and leaves very little lace behind. The nose is oaked vanilla, molasses, beet sugar and toffee maltiness. The flavor is sweet and complex, woody caramelized brown sugar with a touch of minty tasting hops struggling to balance. The high ABV is extremely well hidden. Mildly carbonated with a medium heavy, bordering on syrupy mouthfeel. Be careful with the curmudgean, he's a sneaky bastard, this beer is way to easy to drink at 9.8%."
"-Oelergud"
"Had this on tap at the Founders brewery. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark reddish orange color. Very flowery in the aroma with caramel and light vanilla creeping in. The taste was just amazing coconut and toffee combined - wow. Later on molasses and caramel apples came in. A very uniquely tasting beer. Mouthfeel is very thick and chewy. A nice smooth finish. A great night cap beer or after dinner beer. Founders needs to be in Texas NOW!!!"
"12oz brown bottle served in a snifter. Poured a clear reddish copper with a finger of off white head. Big complex aroma of malt, oak, and some hops. Full bodied and rich. Flavors of chocolate and vanilla from the oak. A bit hoppier than an British style old ale. Long finish with more oak and chocolate. A big, rich flavored beer with a lot of different flavors going on. Nice!"
"(D)- The sweetness from the malts masks the whopping 9.8% pretty well. In my opinion, this is the pinnacle of the perfect dessert beer. It would go great with a great Cameroon wrapped cigar! I am excited to see how this will age considering how much like a tawny port this really is!"
"D - this is surprisingly drinkable for the style and abv, i have been focusing on anything hoppy or pale for the most part and wanted something malty and this hit the spot"
"Drinkability: A solid Old Ale, and even though for how little there are out there, there are better ones to try. I enjoyed this, and it's a great sipper as the weather gets colder, but either it needs time in the cellar to let the hops dissipate a bit, or it's just the tiniest bit out of whack to really become transcendent, for which it has the potential."
"Feel is pretty spot on for an Old, dense full slightly oily mouthfeel with low carbonation from the extended fermentation and high alcohol. Would certainly have again but one at a time. They definately keep the alcohol under wraps on this one."
"The sweetness, hotness, and fruitiness are too much for my liking - not bad, just not my taste."
"Drinkability- its a sessionable beer, drink it slow and let it open up."
"M/D - Very easy drinker, it just goes down easily and leaves a great aftertaste. While I doubt I would kill the four pack, it is something I wouldn't mind having regularly."
"This beer is dangerous crazy awsome good!"
"Medium golden color with a tight head of tan foam with some fair lacing. The smell is pretty light. Pale malt, light oak. Not getting any molasses anywhere here. Tastes of pale malt, maybe some dark honey sweetness. Noticeable, but lighter hop bite. Almost a lager type flavor. Clean. The end delivers vanilla notes from the oak. Very smooth beer in the medium body range. Overall, this is somewhat simple and straightforward, but at the same time complex. I really enjoy the overall taste of this one."
"Highly drinkable."
"pours a light amber with little head. Very little smell, the taste is unique in my tasting experience. Extremely sweet with very little bitterness. The bottle lists an ABV of 9.8% which is not apparent in the taste, not boozy at all. I can't put my finger on it, but I think this beer just has something that isn't doiing it for me. I greatly prefer almost every founders beer I've had to this one. The price $2.79 per bottle wasn't too bad, still not great."
"Drinkability - I can't imagine drinking more than one of these at a time. I hope this beers improves over the next three years in my cellar."
"Bottle Pours a good hazy amber with a small tan head. The head last fairly well for being thin. Lacing is good. Aroma is honey and a big presence of alcohol. Almost has a whiskey like aroma. Has a light carbonation. A good mouthfeel. The flavor is well blended and the alcohol aroma doen't hold up the alcohol is well hidden. Has a full body. A real good finish and a good aftertaste. This is a good beer, a touch strong but a good beer."
"D - Pretty smooth for a 9.3% Old Ale, and certainly not as hot as the ABV would imply. While not a favorite style of mine, this was one of the better Old Ales I've had in my travels."
"D: Take it easy on this one, I think it's a one per night kind of beer."
"overall this beer is nowhere close to fresh old stock (which i love) but time might be on this ones side - i will check back in a year"
"I liked this beer; in fact it was extremely similar to a local barleywine we get called Sisyphus. In fact I would probably need to have them side by side to probably notice any differences."
"D - Keep it slow and keep it easy. A thicker beer, but it is definitely one that goes down nose and easy."
"Drinkability: Very good old ale. Would definitely seek out and drink again."
"The body is more to the full side than moderate. But as mention before, the mouthfell is a bit lacking and I am looking more some more depth. Some heat and fusel notes are a bit of a distraction. The carbonation is light but ok. Overall a decent barleywine but some age could work magic on this beer."
"It's body is reddish with some amber in there. Pours with no head really, but it may have been too cold. Smells are inviting but subdued, and include cherry and generically estery. Quite sour. Bitter and tart finish with obvious alcohol. Cherry and molasses noteness. The sourness is overall very enjoyable. Good body, and well carbonated. The fact that the flavor is so overpowering diminishes drinkability a bit for me."
"D: This beer drinks pretty easy for almost weighing in @ 10%. One of the biggest charecteristics is the Oak flavor."
"I was kind of expecting a little more from this. It's a good beer, dangerously drinkable but it doesn't have enough to make me want to come back to it too often"
"Drinkability is high, wow. Super tasty, smooth, easy drinking, a killer old ale for sure. I can't believe how easy drinking this is with only a few months on it's belt, even it it had a few more when I bought it, it's still probably less then a year old. Wow, great beer!"
"Overall: Eh, I could have done without it the 9.8% ABV. I appreciate the work and effort that was put into this Ale but let's face it; at this high of an alcohol content you may just as well have a barley wine. Not my favorite."
"Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. Appears a mildly cloudy deep, dark amber color with about an inch of light ecru foam. Smells and tastes of sweet caramelized malts, a touch of brown sugar, and alcohol. Rich in body with medium carbonation. Worth a try if you are a fan of the style."
"D- I usually take my time with big abv beers but this went down without a hitch. The alcohol is barely noticable in taste yet the flavors are just so full this becomes too inviting almost. Not my favorite founders beer but a great stab at the old ale category and worthy for repeat visits and slight aging."
"Pours a very hazy and dark rust red with a pretty substantial, fluffy white head. Aroma is extremely malty, sweet, and vinous but boozy at the same time. Taste is slightly sweet, same caramel taste and light butter rum; it comes off as sweet but never sugary as a nice warming alcohol takes over and a bitter kick gives it a great balance. I wish it were a little bigger at the end, but this is a very easy drinking brew for the style."
"There is a toffee and sweet caramel note in the finish which is great. The alcohol is subtle. This is really a nice beer."
"Brown with a strong hint of redness in it. Very cloudy and cannot see through it. No head retention in this beer. In aromas there are cherries as well as raisins. On the taste there are cherries perhaps a slight brown sugar taste. There is almost a stale fruit taste but not in a bad way whatsoever. Full bodied, not heavily carbonated but produces a tingly sensation on the edge of the tongue. I actually enjoy this beer quite a bit. This beer is 9.8% but not a strong alcohol taste at all. Enjoy!"
"I was in the mood for a strong brew tonight but one is enough in one sitting. A likable Old Ale I will defiantly revisit this one"
"This beer pours a cloudy mahogany. Very small tan head even with a rigorous pour. Not much lacing to speak of. The nose is VERY rich. There are amber malts, dark fruits (most notably black cherries), vanilla, and some very mild piney hops. Taste begins with piney hops, more than the nose hinted at. It's followed by raisiny-sweet amber malts and a touch of whiskey/bourbon in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, with a very rich and full bodied, very light on the carbonation...I would have liked a bit more carbonation though. Alcohol is present, it definitely warms you on the way down. This is a pretty intense beer - first that I have had of this style. Can't say that I could drink a lot of these, but was nice for a night when you're in the mood to kick back and enjoy a beer."
"Another keeper from Founders"
"This is definitely a sipping beer that grows more complex in aroma and flavor as it warms."
"Notes: A well made Old Ale, will improve over short-term ageing, but I don't think it's made to go for more than 3 years with improvement. I would like to see more hop character for longer ageing. The hops show themselves and try to contain the HUGE sweetness, but it's just bursting at the brim with sugar. A little more contained than the Smuttynose Really Old Brown Dog, though."
"Take this puppy one sip at a time, and enjoy. Not recommended for the beach in July."
"D: Phenomenal. A great beer that hides the fact that it's 9.3% Be careful, the ABV on this sucka will sneak up on you and kick you in the ass!"
"A very solid beer, but unfortunately it was in he company of some heavyweights, and I don't think showed its very best."
"Drinkability - I felt this one, and it was the only one I had. Had it been a weekend night I would have had more than one. I think this is a great representation of the style, maybe a little tiny bit too sweet though. All in All, I am happy to have several more of these to enjoy in the future. Another good one by Founders."
"I think this might not be too fair because the beer may have been poured wrong, but good beer should be idiotproof. The more I drink the worse it gets, so it might not be me. No soup for you!"
"Nice change of pace here in big hop season. Takes the chill out of your bones."
"D: Compared to the few Old Ales I have had, this one goes down extremely easy. No alcohol burn at all."
"I could drink alot of these."
"Sort of a viscous pour, very little head with a bit of lacing. Looks about the color of apple cider, some floaties. Smell is a bit citrusy with sweet malts, an alcohol smell makes quite a presence also. Tastes exactly like scotch, maybe a bit sweeter though, not much to this one. Chest is warmed up nicely from the alcohol, though. This is the first Founder's brew I probably would never buy again."
"Notes: huge fan of stock ales and barleywines. this one is just how i like these styles - strong, rich, sweet, and virtually no hops."
"12 oz. stubby with no freshness date; unfiltered, 50 IBUs. The beer is a deep, dark crimson, filled with floaties, and capped with a thick finger of yellowed head. Very enticing aroma, with raisins and spices, sweet bread, caramel, brown sugar, fruitcake, a hint of diacetyl and suggestions of molasses, chocolate and pecans. Lots of spicy hop flavor and bitterness, balanced by fruity alcohol and a chewy, complex maltiness that imparts ripe raisin and sweet, dark bread. The body is thick and coating, powdery at times, and leaves a medium finish. This is a hugely malty beer with enough hops to balance, and makes for a delicious evening sipper."
"Hints of caramel and vanilla in the nose. Very malty with a nice oak flavor. Could be a nice step up in alcohol and hoppiness for lovers of scotch ales. The alcohol and hops cut through the very thick maltyness of this brew and help bring it into balance. Very drinkable. Yet another great brew from Founders."
"Poured an almost dark orange color, I liked the way it looked. There was a lot going on in the smell. This being my first real old ale, I didn't know what to expect, but I got sweet smells from all over the spectrum. Caramel, fruit, etc. Interesting, but a little cloying. Fortunately, the taste wasn't so sick, yeah it was intense and really sweet, but the alcohol cut through the sweetness just enough to make it pretty darn good. All in all, I wasn't in a hurry to have another one and I move on for the remainder of the evening, but I did enjoy this beer and would have another some other time. Founders is studly, they just crank out hit after hit."
"this brew pours up a cloudy amber color with a nice thin layer of yellow-tan head. great lacing, baby. the nose is subtle chocolate chip cookies, a little yeast, mint, sweet malts. the taste is the same as the nose. yeast, caramel, hop bitterness in the finish, buttery, delicious. leaves a sticky coating in your mouth. medium carbo, low low carbo. good ol' Founders..."
"not my favorite old ale but it is still pretty good. I would like to see what it would be like with a bit of age."
"D - This is possibly the best old ale that I've ever had. It was sweet and delicious. It only gets a 4 on drinkability because it is so sweet and so potent."
"D: I was excited to find this Founders offering and have generally liked the old ales I've come across, but this one didn't meet my expectations. Might try again down the road because it might be my palette, but not a favorite right now."
"Overall, this is a great ale. I am not the biggest bourbon fan, but this one does it right. Thanks again Shane!"
"This could be a session beer if you've got nowhere to go and yer UConn Huskies or Red Sox are one the plasma. A real smooth finish yet well balanced and flavorful. A worthy brew that I hope to score again"
"This is a standout beer."
"Overpowered by the bourbon taste. Not much carbonation, which could have offset the high ABV. Maybe I got an old bottle, but alcohol burn very present. Can't get past the bourbon taste, both in the initial flavor and aftertaste. Very much like Old Grand Dad. Founders must use some of their bourbon casks in the brewing process."
"This beer is extremely enjoyable and delicious. I couldn't drink many because of the ABV, but I wouldn't have any problem drinking them until I fell out of my chair. A damn good beer, IMHO."
"Stubby 12 oz brown bottle picked up at the Charleston Beer Exchange. Poured a hazy orange amber with a very thin white head that quickly faded. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is wonderful combination of vanilla, bready malt and bourbon. The taste flavor is big and full with a coying sweetness with a hints of smoke, brown sugar, caramel malts and whiskey. My first Founders and definitely not my last. A truly outstanding, complex brew. Well done."
"Impressive old ale. Definitely a nice interpretation of the style. a bit muddled at points, and a bit undefined at others, but all in all a delicously drinkable brew. I'm really wishing I hadn't just finished the last drop - this is one I could sip on all night. The alcohol, while strong in flavor, is really not potent in a cloying sense. Hides relatively well, making this one solidly drinkable."
"Yummy. Doesnt look like a great beer, but overall I want to drink more. Cant get founders out my way, will continue to need to trade for em."
"This one's a sipper, though I probably could have drank this all night if I was in the mood."
"Not a fan of this beer and I think I will avoid it in the future. Least favorite Founders brew."
"A: The color of a coppery peach juice, lots of floating particles, minimal head - 4.00, S: Lots of heavy and ripe fruits, smell of prune juice, aromatically sweet from a solid malt base but with some noticeable earthy to herbal hops - 4.25, T: Hearty malt base coupled with a decent hop bite, though you sense the alcohol it is very nicely veiled, tastes like a rum soaked fruitcake that is heavy on the raisins - 4.25, M: Quite creamy and medium bodied - 4.50, D: I shouldn't be surprised given the other Founder's beers I've sampled - but this is a nicely crafted beer and one I would drink again - 4.00"
"** I had the opportunity to have a year old bottle as well and did enjoy how it mellowed..."
"Big sweet malt explosion, full of caramel and a stronger sense of that tobacco-like taste I got from the nose. Almost like coffee, except it's a harsher sensation. Tastes burnt without that flavor dominating, it adds sort of an oaked sensation to it. Also reinforced by a whiskey-like bite to it at the end, as well as a whiskey-smokeyness after in the throat. Hops bitter towards the end of the palate, there for bittering effect to balance out the sweetness, and don't really add the taste of pine or another particular hop taste. Mouthful is thick and syrupy, it coats the palate and doesn't want to let go. Big bodied beer. A nice sipper, but the heavy presence of hard liquors/alcohol, combined with the harshness of the other flavors prevent this from being more than that. I like the change of pace, but I don't know if I want to pursue this beer again, at least fresh."
"The aroma is complex with butterscotch, sour-tropical fruit, caramel, oak, and a touch of peat. The appearance is dark amber with a medium head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thick. Overall this is a very good beer. What I like about it is the unique, mysterious taste."
"Did a vertical tasting with the '06 and the '08 and the fresher '08 had more carbonation and tasted fresher. I liked that one better."
"D: Bang for your buck with this delicious beer! It has a smooth yet complex profile with plenty of alcohol to warm you on a cold winters night. Was glad to try this one more than a year aged."
"D, notes: Good sipping beer. Smooth and tasty."
"The beer was rich, yet smooth, very creamy, nice bitter aftertaste, and easy to drink with a medium to heavy body. Not sure I would want to or could drink too many at a time, but probably could, but might be better as a dessert beer. Excellent beer, highly recommended."
"Dark, cloudy chestnut with an initially large, creamy head that's nicely sticky and bubbly. Dried fruit aromas blend with caramel and nuts, flowers, cherries, whiskey, and mild spices. Light but pleasant...like a dessert I guess. Much ""thicker"" flavor. A rich fruitiness mixes with a sugary maltiness right away. Wine and bourbon, cocoa and coconut, vanilla, oranges...lots of flavor, though quite sweet. Probably too much for me to want to grab another right away, but it's not really that kind of beer. Very smooth, although there is some texture to the full-ish body. I like it...a good quality dessert-like beer."
"Even though it is not my favorite style, I think Founders has hit the mark again with this one. The whiskey flavors keep Curmudgeon from becoming too much like an average, syrupy Wee Heavy."
"D: A little bit on the hot side fresh but still drinkable. This is what you want from this style. I think this beer has a really nice cellaring potential. Too bad I only had the one bottle."
"Drinkability- This is truly a sipper, to be enjoyed slowly."
"A well made, complex ale. This is a winner with a great depth of fruit and earthy notes. Flavor is pleasant and unified, missing some of the alcohol harshness that is often present in an Olde Ale. In my opinion, this detracted from the score. Still, this is a tasty treat."
"Another great beer from founders, they just seem to make one winner after another!"
"A clean dark amber beer. Has a small off white head. There is a sweet candy toffee note that dominates the aroma hiding a hint of alcohol in the background. The sweet toffee note hits the tip of your tongue while the alcohol sweeps over the middle. The finish has a coffee/tobacco character and then the toffee and alcohol join hands for a smooth aftertaste."
"Tastes similarly sweet with a spiced alcohol finish. The fruit is more subtle and less obvious than in the nose. Very rich and full mouthfeel. Great all around."
"founder's is a brewery that i've been impressed with, and this is only first real review of one of their beers. i'll be back with more."
"Pours a hazy amber orange with a thin off white head.Aroma of sweet caramel malts ,honey,and some woody tones.Flavor is awesome,malty caramel,sticky honey,rasins,dates spruce, and burbon. Smooth creamy mouthfeel,a little sticky in a good way. Loads of lacing all the way down the glass,a nice warming effect. Very good"
"Poured into a snifter a dark orange color, bordering on rust, with no foam despite a hard pour and no lacing. Sediment was left in the bottle. Nice deep aroma of caramel, ripe fruits, and light booziness. Flavor is a nice mixture of toffee and caramel with only lightest bit of hop bitterness on the finish. Very sweet, brown sugary, hints of licorice, lightly spicy. Caramel apple is a good comparison. Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, easy to drink, alcohol is well hidden for such a high ABV, but a slight warming can be felt as it warms up. Caramely delicious brew. I really enjoyed this one."
"Pours a nice light copper color, but with no head and almost no lacing. Strong scent, but it's a hodge-podge of aromas; a huge maltiness with an interesting hop scent, with hints of cinnamon, caramel, and jerky, as well as alcohol. Strong, deep taste, but it has an odd varnish flavor to it, to go along with a deep pine malt. Goes down fine, with a bit of alcohol roughness. Not the best old ale I've ever had, or the best Founders; although I would never turn one down, either."
"It's a solid brew from a great brewery - definitely a sipper. Like I said before, it's just a little too sweet in my opinion. I would only really 'enjoy' one of these in a sitting. I also rated it a little lower because if I didn't know any better (I guess if I was illiterate) I would have sworn this was a Barleywine opposed to an Old Ale - even though they are similar styles. Nevertheless, a very good beer."
"Considering booziness and burnt notes in the aftertaste, it does glide down pretty easily. Since the style is so varied, I would say it fits the style well enough. An interesting brew that is quite good, though getting rid of burnt edges would go a long way."
"Recommended..."
"Deep ruby brown with thinnish head, murky and scary. Big notes of oak, vanilla, bourbon, and the like. Malt sweetness blanketing a somewhat juicy, citrusy hop character underneath. Holy mother, more of the same for the taste. Lots of vanilla sweetness to the point that it's overbearing and masks the rest of the brew. A bit spicy and warming for sure. Big, full, and creamy in the mouth. A faint burn but not in an entirely distracting sort of way. The bourbon essence is just too much for me. I can handle one and one only, if that. I believe there are better choices out there, even though Founders doesn't ever really steer me wrong. Worth a try but a bit more one dimensional than I expected."
"Drink is very tasty, a nice malty beer with aenough hop to keep it from being too sweet. A little syrupy in the sweetness, but very good."
"I feel like I'm drinking this through a flavor-filter. A 9+% oak aged Old Ale, and all I can experience is paper, water-logged butter-caramel, and grain alcohol. It's like that very last, weakest sip of a Beam of the rocks."
"Drinkability: A big and complex sipper. A little off-put by the floaties, but that could have been prevented by a proper decant. Alcohol is very forward, but not overwhelming. I imagine this would benefit greatly from some aging and I may have to throw some of this in the cellar with my North Coast Old Stock Ale."
"Interesting second beer. I really want to tear into the next bottle but i don't know, first a 12% and now a 9.3%, I could be in some trouble, I like this!"
"2008 vintage. A fairly clear clear orange/amber pour. Miniscule off white head. Nice malty aroma, increases as it warms. Tons of malt flavor, some toffee, brown sugar with a little raisin. A small amount of hop presence. Nice and sticky and lingering. A little bit young I think, I bet the other three will age very nicely. Right now I'd say the Ola Dubh version I've had are a little bit better, but they're aged. This should have no problem competing with some age and at a bargain of a price comparitively. Actually bought a couple 3rd Coast Old Ales with this 4 pack, curious to see how they compare, even though they are considered barley wine."
"Another single bottle special from Wisconsin. A complex beer that I could have sworn was barrel-aged, but I can't find anything on Founder's site that says that it is. Quite tasty."
"Drinks pretty easy, considering the style, ABV & dryness. This was on the verge of greatness, but needed more body or aging to pull it together"
"Pours a murky deep copper hue with a one finger off-white head that falls to a thin creamy layer of foam. A decent amount of lacing remains clinging the sides of the glass. Smells of rich caramel malts, molasses, and alcohol warm the nostrils. Sweet spices and earthy hops in the nose as well as fig and prunes. Taste begins and ends quite boozy. Rum, dates, leather, and gooey caramel to start things off in the mouth followed by tingling hops. Toffee and bark flavors emerge midway finishing with a lingering vanilla bean sweetness. Medium body with a prickly feel on the cheeks. A tad above average carbonation for the style, could be a bit smoother. I'd take 4th Dementia over this in a heartbeat, but who wouldn't?"
"way better than last years batch :D"
"Thanks to KarlHungus for the bottle!"
"I poured a 12oz bottle medium speed into a beveled 16oz NERAX pint glass. The beer poured out showing a strikingly perfect color for my tastes in a beer like this: a blend of brown caramel and burnt pumpkin orange colors surrounded the glass while at an angle looking upwards towards the thin head I see a deeper brown, almost like a stained mahogany. I know this is a ""thick"" beer and I haven't had a taste. Smell was of slight vanilla, caramel and raisin. No single smell seemed outright dominant. Extremely pleasurable smell in this beer. Upon first taste I am almost overwhelmed. First opinion was that this was indeed a ""thick"" beer. The mouthfeel was a tad surprising at first but soon I adjusted and the thickness of the beer was preferred. I soon realized how wonderfully balanced tasting a beer of this complexity is. Malty to my tastes, but not in a bad way. Just the right amount of caramel and mild malt balances things out by cutting the smack you get from the strength of the beer. This makes this beer very, very drinkable despite the punch it packs. I'm not 100% sold that I want a beer with this much action in the mouthfeel (initial lip hit, tongue fall of the beer, the follow-up coating of the tongue with thickness of the malt) but if you know you want an Old Ale, this has to come recommended. I think this is a solid A- on my personal scale. Only reason I say it can improve is the mouthfeel to me at this young age is still really thick. I have 3/4 of the pack down in the cellar for aging. I strongly believe this is a candidate with some aging and will be researching to see just how long people have been holding this for."
"This beer pours a murky brown-amber color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, with hint of floral hops. The taste of brown sugar, caramel, toffee, and a hop presence that is quite higher than the aroma indicates. There is also a nice hot alcohol finish. The mouthfeel is a touch lighter than full bodied, with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a wonderful old ale. I would really like to try this with some age on it."
"Pours a cloudy copper/brown with a small beige head. Aroma is sweet raisin, caramel, cherry, nutty, light chocolate, smoke, butterscotch andwood. Flavor is cherry, caramel, raisin, light pineapple and light nutty. Finish is a bit hot and also has some bourbon notes. Full bodied, sticky texture. Low carbonation."
"Wow what a beer, I mean really, what a beer!! This beer pours cloudy and thick and seems like it's gonna be some sort of imperial brown ale. The smell is really sweet and smoot and has a crisp after effect. I love the tast of this beer, it is laced with vanilla and oak notes along with heavy malts. Caramel malt really rings out in this monster beer, it's really smooth too. I love this beer, share it with a friend and enjoy!"
"Aggressively poured into my Duvel glass, this beer has a hazy auburn color with an almost non existent head. Smells fruity and sweet with caramel and alcohol. Tastes of malt and sweet fruit with honey and caramel flavors. This beer is very smooth with a medium body and is nicely carbonated with alcohol at the end. Overall this is a great choice from Founders. I usually would not go for something as sweet as this but I am loving every sip of this one. A must try."
"Another great one from Founders."
"D - Fantastic but very brown sugary sweet, maybe not for everyone."
"This would certainly be welcome one at a time, once in awhile. Probably better off after dinner rather than before or during."
"Overall- Very sweet with big doses of dried fruits and a big alc. warmness made this an enjoyable 1 pinter."
"Comments- I wondering if a few months in the bottle might take the remaining edges off of this one (but the screw-off cap makes me hesitant to try it)."
"I can see myself getting more of these."
"I saw the bartender pour it straight from the tap and it looked like he was pouring a slow thick molasses into my pint glass. When the beer settled, I saw that it was a hazy cranberry orange color. It had more cranberry than orange in it. On top of this hazy brew was a good 1/2 an inch head of pure white foam. This head of foam had decent retention that left behind a long lasting skim of white foam, a small string of white rings, and one streak of white lace. The aroma was no joke! This Old Ale was on the sweet side with roasted wheat, plenty of sweet black cherries, a touch of caramel, a subtle hint of grapefruit, lightly roasted pine needles, and a few dried herbal hops at the end. The taste was messing around either. The taste kicks off on the sweet side with toasted caramel malts, a speck of roasted wheat, and a splash of dried black cherries. Then after the black cherries leave the tongue, the taste then goes dry, bitter, and alcoholic with dried citrus hops, a few dried citrus fruits, quite a few pine needles, and a big bite of alcohol. Sometimes the hops and alcohol will mix together to make the taste a little harsh to drink. This was clearly a full bodied beer with a strong full flavored aftertaste of dried citrus hops, black cherries, a gentle touch of caramel, and plenty of alcohol. This strong aftertaste will linger on for some time. This beer doesn't even try to mask its high alcohol content. It was a nice lightly sweet big beer, but like I said before, it can get a little harsh to drink sometimes. Be careful with one. Take your time sipping this big beer."
"D- The alcohol being as noticeable as it was took away from this beer's drinkability. One would be great to sip next to the fire on a cold winter night, but I don't think I would want another. Maybe I'd save one and pour it over my pancakes in the morning though."
"Eric"
"The drink is full-bodied with a tingle of carbonation and silky feel. Very good drinkability for style."
"D- A sipper for sure but still fairly easy to drink."
"D - Delicious flavor stays accurate throughout. High alcohol in flavor doesn't necessarily translate to high alcohol in effect and drinkability. A terrific brew from Founders."
"Pours blurry nut brown in color (a little lighter than I would have expected) with a single finger head that dissipates to a foamy swirl. Nose is deep caramel and vanilla, not much else going on here. Taste is much like the nose with the addition of some hop bitterness and a slightly woody taste. The alcohol is very present, but not overly so for the style. The mouthfeel is a little thin compared to other old ales I have had. Drinkability is only so so on this one, the hops seem oddly placed, perhaps in another six months this will improve."
"While starting slow, this one finished with a bang. Technically this isn't my favorite, but for sure I'll be loading up my closet with these."
"This is an interesting old ale and I think it would have been even better for me without the overpowering barrel presence in the taste. Nonetheless, a good sipper."
"Drinkability: It opens up as it warms. Much more drinkable than a barleywine. It is a very full-bodied beer and makes it known. Very good, I would like to try it again."
"Drinkability: Founders continues to be one of my favorite breweries, and this one really comes into its own as it warms. Yeah, it's a little hot and could do with being laid down for a year or two (an older ale?), and the abv% is high regardless - approaching double-digits - but there's a ton of great stuff here."
"D - Delicious. This beer covers all the different facets of the Old Ale style -- malt presence, warming alcohol, and the nuances of ""old"" including leather and wood. At almost 10%, this beer is not to be trifled with, even though it can easily lull you into a sense of pleasant comfortability like a seasoned sailor keeping you rapt with an old tale of the sea."
"D: In some ways, this reminded me of a barleywine, probably because of the caramel. Overall, this is a drinkable beer, one good for the winter months."
"This guy is a sipper on a cold night. Enjoyable."
"Overall, there is a really great beer that I highly recommend. Looking forward to trying some more in the style."
"Another great beer from Founders. I enjoyed this on a cold November night and it did the trick of warming me up. An great example of the style."
"This beer is murky brown with almost no head (the little foam that did exist was light tan colored). The smell was rich, malt + plums/raisins. The taste was even richer, a little like a really strong version of an English barleywine. Lots of dark fruits (mainly raisins) and malty sweetness, with a little alcohol burn. Thick mouthfeel, substantial beer, easy to see why it's rated highly. Old ales aren't my favorite, they're good once in a while, I pretty much tried this one because it was made by Founders. As usual they did a great job."
"Very enjoyable to brew to enjoy over time. Not one to go back to after finishing the first."
"Thanks to spointon for this one!"
"Drinkability: A milder flavor and smell than I'm used to, thus making it more than just a sipper. Not the best old ale I've had, but one that's worth a try. Wish there was a little more umph to it."
"Cheers!"
"Autumn colored ale with a full white head. Very nice complex aroma has complexity from the malt as well as the barrel. Notes of vanilla, creme brulee, cookie, coconut as well as some spice nuances and barrel character. Flavor has some complexity from the original beer (caramel., toffee), as well as some light notes of whiskey, peat, toasted wood and vanilla. A fairly nice ale."
"[EDIT: Tried a bottle on 12/28/2011 that was almost 2 years old. Very tasty, with subdued alcohol and a smooth, caramel maltiness. Dried fruits and a tinge of hops made for a well-rounded old ale. Leagues better than when this beer was fresh.]"
"Had this on tap at Mike Roman's pub in Bay View, WI."
"This thing is a sipper and I think it's screaming to be aged. I will save one for some cold winter night ad stash some down in the cellar...Ok...it's ust a basement. A very unique style and one that I will have to play around with..."
"D= Certainly an easy drinking whiskey barrel inspired beer. I appreciate that neither the wood nor the bourbon flavors overpower the rest of it. Just a bit thin for my palate, but still damn drinkable."
"D - Reminds me of candy but with a bit bitter finish. Tasty but really heavy and sweet, almost cloyingly so."
"M/D: Surprisingly not so heavy, full bodied, but carbonation is low, and it feels light (but still on the heavy end of the spectrum). Good drinkability. Delicious beer. Superb."
"Drinkability is high on this one my friends, although it is a heavy beer it is excellent for sipping on cool autumn nights when the bats are flying overhead."
"a4/s4/m4/t3.5/d4"
"This beer pours a muddy amber-brown with a small off white head that does not hold or lace. The aroma is of caramel, dark fruits and emerging vanilla and coconut of bourbon as the beer warms. The flavor also smells of caramel up front as the beer warms some fruitiness comes out as well. Finally the bourbon makes its presence known. At first the bourbon was a bit astringent but as the beer warms it becomes more pleasant. However, the besides the bourbon, I do not get a whole lot else. The body is medium-full and low on carbonation. Overall, it is an ok beer. I would like to see a bit more beyond the bourbon."
"This was a very unique old ale. I would suggest trying this one it was very nice and warming."
"Curmudgeon is a beer to sip and savor. A wonderful nightcap, Founders has taken the old ale to dizzying heights. This is one of the best I've had. On those cold winter nights in front of a fire when you reflect on your life's failures, Curmudgeon will be right there with you, glaring and mumbling and somehow making everything seem a little bit better. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability - A great slow paced beer. Maybe not for everyone (my girlfriend - ""That's, um, interesting"") but will likely be a constant in my stock. I have a soft spot for Old Ales and I particularly liked this one more than some of the others I've had. Another excellent beer from Founders."
"Pours a red / caramel / amber color. A sweet malty smell. Can detect the alcohol in the smell. Crisp clean taste.. fairly balanced but actually on the bitter side. Fairly bitter finish but not overwhelming. For its strength, this is very drinkable and smooth."
"Pours a crisp deep amber almost brown with no head, just a ring. The aroma is loads of malts with slight underlying hops. The taste is wonderfully complex, burnt caramel, dried fruits, and molasses all blend nicely. The beer is slightly heavy but the alcohol is not overbearing. This is a very enjoyable beer, especially as it warms."
"Another great beer from Founders."
"Mouthfeel: Very creamy and full mouthfeel."
"Poured into a nonic a clear rich auburn color with a thinner but well sustained white head.Alcohol dipped fruit and vanilla stand out most in the nose with a hint of brown sugar,its warming at malt driven.Mouthfeel is a little sticky and a little thinner than expected,flavors are sweet up front with some cherry-like fruitiness and vanilla and the alcohol gives a little burn,there is a racey drying hop finish with is nice and balanced.A sipping brew, a nice warmer on a day like yesterday."
"O - a pleasant sipper."
"Quite an interesting brew and a bit better than the Bell's Third Coast Old Ale that I tried. I would like to get another bottle of this to age alongside my Third Coast and give both another try in a couple months or so."
"D: This beer is not sweet in a cloying way, which I expected it to be from the poor. It's very well balanced somehow. I'm not sure I'd drink more than one of these in a sitting but can breeze through the first one quite easily. A good beer."
"A very good old ale, not my favorite, but quite close."
"Rich redwood color with a silky tan head. Not the best retention, but still a fine looking ale. The nose has a collection of oaky malts, smoke, cocao and ripe fruits. Taste is well balanced between big roasty malts, sweet residual sugars and subtle floral hops. Full body is well carbonated. A very good version of the style that I could drink quite often."
"D: Incredibly smooth and balanced, not too sweet, just the right amount of bitterness, makes for an incredibly drinkable beer. If it just looked a bit prettier this beer would score a 5 in this category, but appearance still counts for me when it comes to drinkability. Still a fantastically drinkable beer."
"An awesome beer. I actually prefer this over the Breakfast Stout, which while a great brew, is a little overrated in my book. For those that like old-style ales, this one is worth seeking out."
"This is definitely not a session beer. A few of these in a night could put you right to sleep. All and all, not a huge fan of this style, but will try some others to be certain."
"D - Overall a nice complex sipper. It was rather good but I expected it to be a bit sweeter. I think this would be good with a bit of age on it to let the orange peel die down a bit; it was rather spicy as well and sometimes think that took a bit away from the other flavors. I do like this though, but not my favorite ale. Think it would go well with some ice cream or maybe a brownie."
"Old Curmudgeon's a kick ass old ale. Founders makes awesome beer. I'm really in awe of their seasonal/limited releases. They're easily one of the top brewers out there. If you're into big, thick, flavorful beers, this one's for you. Highly recommended."
"Murky muddled ambrosia sits in my chalice large off white beige head that dwindles slow and leaves behind sparse lacing. Aromatics are the impressive part of the equation early on with herbal mint and pine scented incense, interesting spice mix almost like eating at an aromatic Indian restaurant. Malt highlights are deep alcohol infused ripened figs and plum with a touch of smoked peat whiskey highlights, talk about a cigar beer. By the way this thing never saw the barrel it's all malt, hop, water and yeast. Flavor provides excessive bitterness and massive malt, I love the mix. Alcohol esters with ripe big fruit profile includes hints of toffee with caramel infused tart apple, figs, and plum notes. Heavy pine lacquer bitterness, with vanilla oak and butterscotch notes. Heavy dry yeast tone with a soothing alcohol burn at 9.3%. Mouthfeel is full bodied yet doesn't hit the viscous level on my texture scale. Carbonation is natural smooth and cleansing between the brash bitterness and dry yeast profile. Ending notes on the palate are a blend of excessive malts and bitter earthy hop, great stuff. Drinkability, is excellent makes you overanalyze beer, for under three bucks this old ale may have pushed the style further than any other version I've had to date. Including the other famous Michigan version, this beats the pants off the Third Coast Old Ale, grab a Drew Estates Natural cigar and a four pack of this for an Old World experience."
"Interesting and enjoyable. Good example for the style."
"Mouthfeel is heavy, smooth, and harsh. A strong mouthfeel for a strong beer, good stuff."
"This beer poured a cloudy golden brown color and formed a small off white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel, raisins and chocolate is present. The flavor is of malt, caramel, plums and hint of chocolate. The body is medium and the finish is sweet with a slight peppery quality with the warming aspect of the alcohol present coming through. A nice beer from Founders that I wish would show up here in Columbus more, or at least more places."
"D- great for a cold winter night indoors. not so good in the summer. one is probably enough. its pretty potent. ill be curious to see what this develops into."
"A very quaffable beer. Probably wouldn't want more than a couple because of the deceptive abv. More of a ""sipper"". I'll be enjoying the rest of this 4 pack."
"Served in a snifter. Poured a mahogany color with copious yeast particles present in solution. Not quite opaque, as there was some light penetration, put extremely diminished clarity. Quarter inch off-white cap quickly dissipated into a swirly skim. Nose is pretty incredible; wonderful complexity. Picked up vanilla, bourbon, caramel and oak on this one straight out of the bottle. Taste consistent with nose, but some more booziness comes out as well as a mild dark fruit character. Really quite tasty (I had a hard time deciding between a 4 & a 4.5 on this one). Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a light-effervescent tingle. Some viscousness to the body, but not overwhelmingly so. Definitely a sipper, but very pleasurable to drink and savor as it warms. I am curious to see how this ages, as I think it will most likely improve over time."
"D - WOW I could drink this all the time it is simply amazing."
"This brew has a hazy dark red pour, there are hues of burnt orange, ruby and brown in this brew, pour gave a thin covering of tiny bubbles. Looks viscous and syrupy in the glass, interesting, lots of malt flavor, has a big malt sweetness, brown sugar, chocolate, light berries and candy, some mild hops but not a big bite. Alcohol warmth felt at the first sip. Another worthy effort from Founders."
"Taste: Curmudgeon gathers all of the best elements of a good barleywine, without the unpleasant heat and unnecessary hopping of some (which I acknowledge is a very controversial viewpoint that many will not agree with, especially on the west coast). Sweet, thick, carmel, malts, toffee, fruits. This is a dessert beer. I want more."
"I used to think I wasn't a big old ale fan, but this throws that idea out. This was both drinkable and delicious at over 9% alcohol. This beer reminded me of a lot of the wonderful flavors in a barrel-aged beer (minus the wood) for the smooth mixture of vanilla, spiced rum, and fruity malts. I'd say this one is near the top of the style. A must-try for old ale-lovers."
"Pours a three finger very light tan head that fades slowly, leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Roasted malt nose. Flavor is sweet roasted molasses. $3.90 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Overall a very solid beer, and a good example of the style, though I doubt this is anything that I would really seek out, as there are some much nice examples out there. Still though if it were sitting on the shelf near me I would definitely pick this one up."
"This is a complex beer for the style, but rather than the hop/malt balance, this is more of a mystery tour of malt flavors."
"Drinkability: a decent beer but alcohol is a bit too up front here. Worth a try."
"I expected this to be good, yet it was much better than I had hoped. It really shines as a stellar old ale/ English-style barleywine. Don't miss this one."
"Drinkability was hurt a bit due to the fact that the alcohol gets a little harsh towards the end, but it was still an enjoyable beer."
"This beer has its virtues, but it is not an enjoyable experience. The appearance is a nice cloudy amber brown with lots of yeasty bits floating about. The head is off white, retains a bit, not much lacing. The aroma is profoundly whisky alcohol, dark and heavy fruits, such as fig, rind, apricot, raisin. This is a full bodied beer, quite syrupy in consistency, and just plain thick and overly sweet. There is also an oaky aged quality to the beer. The taste mimics the aroma. You'll get the full gamut of heavy fruit flavors, a cloying candied sugar sweetness, and a syrupy thickness that is just over the top, and that oaky aged quality that is more apt in a bourbon. The killer for me is the alcohol throaty burn. I feel like I'm drinking a sweet whisky drink and it just burns on the way down. This is the type of beer that leaves me with a heartburn afterwards. It's just not drinkable as a beer. For a 9.3% ABV, this tastes like it is thrice that much. Way too much alcohol, and not my cup of tea at all. It's too bad, because the beer does have its virtues, just not as it is presently consistituted. The aftertaste is just doing me in. If I wanted a sweet whisky concoction, I would have mixed one myself."
"HV"
"EDIT: as i got down about halfway and it had warmed enough it basically just started to taste like rum. Had to pour it out because it wasn't worth trying to choke down. Only the second or third time I have had to pour beer out. Very disappointing."
"Heavy body. This one is a real sipper. Good for a night that you only want one. I have 2 more bottles that i might age for awhile, interested to see how this one ages. Overall I have mixed feelings about this one, it has some nice qualities but leaves me a little flat in the end. Maybe some aging will give it the smoothness to match the finish? We shall see. Worth picking up if you can find it."
"D: Slow sipper, indeed. Tasty and quaffable. I'd say night cap only. Is there a better brewery out there besides Founders? My other 2 favorites have some catching up to do(Surly and GLBC)."
"T: Lighter side of medium bodied with moderate carbonation, slightly watery in the finish. Taste follows the smell and borders on being slightly too sweet. Flavors of caramelized dark fruit, spices, molasses, sugar, vanilla and a background of alcohol. Also has a slight oaky flavor."
"This old ale is a little hoppier than others I've had, but it's still pretty tasty!"
"Toffee flavors, with an oak nuance behind it. Very cohesive and mellowed, it doesn't feel alcoholic at all. Caramel and wood, sturdy and balanced. Age has worked wonders on this beast. Rich and fairly well carbonated, it has a divine feel to it. Seek it out..."
"Tasty, enjoyable, a good version of the style. And since I want to be a curmudgeon some day, this is a good one to get used to! Seriously, a little to strong and rich for me, a decent once in a while beer, maybe in smaller than 12 ounce servings."
"D- I wasn't too impressed by this one. Not bad but it just didn't have that raisin and fig influence that I love in old ales."
"A fine old ale here. High ABV (9.3%) is masked well by finely blended and balanced ingredients. I could easily toss back a few of these and not know what was going to hit me until it was too late. Tasty and easy-drinking. I'd recommend this to just about anyone. Would serve as a great social lubricant at parties, and would go especially well with desserts such as flan or bread pudding."
"d: This is a great sipper on a cool evening. Thanks to hoppymeal for this outstanding extra."
"D: Wonderful to drink at the moment. Whatever some extra aging has done to downgrade the appearance has been made up for in drinkability and texture. Well-balanced flavors and enticing aroma make for an ale I'd love to sip on again. Recommended!"
"This is not my favorite style, but this beer has a lot going on which makes it enjoyable to drink."
"Pours a nice amber brown color with a finger of slightly off-white head that dissolves to a fine film fairly fast. Solid looking, although the lacing is fairly non-existent. Nose is strong, full of toffee and caramel. Some sweet dried fruit in there too, and maybe a touch of spicy hoppy alcohol. Flavor is spicy and acidic. Quite vinous, with raisins and a sort of acidic aftertaste. Again, principally strong toffee malt but with a nice fruity background as well. A highly sweet beer, and fairly alcoholic (the 9.3% is fairly well hidden in the fruit and spiciness though). Body is medium with very mild, smooth carbonation, as is fairly standard for the style (and for a beer this high in alcohol). Overall, a very tasty one, although the ABV might keep me from having more than one or two. A very good dessert beer. I'm going to try cellaring one and see if the spiciness mellows at all."
"Grabbed a single of this in Cambridge. This will be my second time trying this brew, but the first as far as trying it from the bottle. Poured into my Stella glass a ruby color, with a small white heading. Smell is dominated by raisin, maple syrup, molasses and a bit of caramel. Taste is right along the same lines, with the maple syrup and raisins shining the most...is very sweet and sugary. Body is full and isn't afraid to throw its weight around with the alcohol. It is there and you will know it after a bottle. Great beer, but the intense flavors and in your face alcohol make it a difficult beer to drink. Reminds me a little bit of North Coast's Old Ale, which is also quite enjoyable. A beer to sit down and take your time with. Cheers"
"First taste already says this is a winner! The thick and creamy (but not too heavy) of a fullness fills the mouth, a bourbon sweetness tickles every corner but not to the extent of a whiskey sting because the malts subdue into an almost caramelized and soothing throat coat. The back of the throat gets a painted with a molasses, hazelnut and honey coat that makes some clear their throat between sips but each sip til the glass is done is a seductive and warm flirt of a 9.5 percent and 50 IBU's"
"Overall plenty of excellent flavors and aromas to go around. This would pair nicely with a stilton or Point Reyes Blue Cheese. Good beer for sure."
"Pours a nice amber color with some great lacing. Decent one inch head settles nicely. Smells just like a fine whiskey. It's seriously one of the stranger beers I've had the pleasure of putting up to my nose. I get a strong sense of oak aging and some caramel. Not surprisingly this is just like sipping a whiskey. I'm not quite sure what to say about the taste of the beer, but i am enjoying the sipping aspect of it. A different type of beer, but one that you could settle down to in the evening."
"Pours beautiful with an inch and a half of light tan head with foamy bubbles and nice retention. Body is a ruby brown mix that beckons to be drank. Nose has a nice combination of toasted almonds, rum, and dark fruits equaling a very robust feel. Enters the mouth with a resin like nutty oak character. Dark ripe fruits appear on the back of the tongue. Slight spicyness sparkles on the tailend of the palate. A rich spicey thick mouthfeel is the result. Sweetness is all over this beer and it is very bold with a smokey feel. Alchol is well hidden but the belly tells you it is there. Drinkability is decent."
"D- Definitely a sipper, but very enjoyable. I was not blown away, but this was very well done. I will be interested to see how the other 3 age."
"I'd love to cellar one of these and see how it ages."
"D: The alcohol is so well hidden, I wondered if it really was 9.3%. Heather said it reminded her of Backwoods Bastard. I'd definitely agree. This is much better than I remember from years past."
"Slight fruitiness, reminiscent of figs, vanilla - the character of which makes me wonder if this was aged on American oak. Finishes sweet. Full bodied, slight carbonation. Not really what I'm looking for in an Old Ale."
"As a fellow Michigander, I was disappointed by this beer. Founders makes some great beers, so this must be an anomaly. It poured a beautiful dark amber into my glass. It poured very dense, almost like syrup, which is very inviting. It foams up to 1 finger then dissipates down to a light, white lacing. Smells is of vanilla and raw coconut. The coconut flavor overwhelms the smell of the beer. Taste is a little better. Hops, then raw coconut and vanilla, followed by a heavy alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is heavy, but lightly carbonated. The coconut flavor of the beer was so strong that this beer is not drinkable. Perhaps this would be alot better if it were better balanced."
"A wise Old Ale indeed!"
"Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. In terms of drinkability, it's a sipper, but a fairly easy-drinking one."
"This brew is a nice cloudy brown with a small head. The smell is hops, dried apricots, raisens and alcohol. The taste is somewhat nutty, caramel and molasses. But the dominating thing is the abv. Mouthfeel is smooth but with a whiskey like aftertaste and drinkability is fine on a cool day. This beer is barleywine-like and will certainly warm your ears. A decent beer that I would revisit."
"Overall, unexpected. The standard dark fruit flavors of an old ale were covered up entirely by the alcohol bourbon flavor. Maybe I'll enjoy the next one more, when I can see it coming."
"Good stuff the get through the cold Michigan winter season. A bit pricey for a 4-pack."
"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy brown color ale with a small foamy head with small rings of lacing. Aroma is super sweet, almost disgustingly so with some notes of alcohol. Taste is a huge mess between some intense sweetness, oily texture with some cloying notes of alcohol. I couldnt find anything close to old ale but more of an American barleywine with some unbalance feature. I usually love product from this brewery but this beer did not profit from barrel-aging."
"Curmudgeon is yet another outstanding beer from Michigan's best brewery (sorry Mr. Bell). There are very few beer artisans who nail each and every style like these guys do. That's why they're on my list of 'Top-10 American Craft Breweries' and will be for the foreseeable future. If you want a delicous old ale that is pretty close to the gold standard for the style, seek this one out."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Overall: I have gotten into the Old Ales recently and this one is a perfect example. I would like to get another and age it a bit to see what it does to the flavor. If the alcohol taste died down a bit, that would be a plus but this is one very complex brew. Founder's is quite possibly my second favorite brewer out there and as I continue to taste more and more of their expertly crafted brews such as this one; they continue to gain on Stone which at this time is my first."
"Im just going to assume this ones spent some time in a bourbon barrel. It seems to be a good introduction to barrel beers if one was interested. Makes for a good sipper over all."
"Smooth is the name of this game. Thick, silky, viscous elixir with a two minute finish. Some bittering hops on the end make you pucker as well as a woodsy bourbony flavor that leaves a wine like tannin. I would say this beer easily has another year in her if not three. Full again of fresh chopped coconut, dried cranberry, white and red raisin, dates, prune, caramel and toffee. A celebration in a glass. Nutty mid palate with a maple brown sugar twist. Have three more of these too sample each of the next three years. Can't wait."
"Drinkability - This one is nicely done. I'm assuming that these would probably have a decent shelf life too"
"D: The ale's abv is high but the intense flavors create a beer that never disappoints in its power. Are you sure it isn't aged in a barrel?"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat viscous with a middle of the road carbonation that suits the beer well. It grabs on nicely while still finishing clean. I really enjoyed this brew and I'm glad I have another bottle. I could see myself indulging in a couple in a sitting for sure and I plan on buying another four pack if I see it available. Founders has impressed me again with this one!"
"D: For an old ale at 9.3%, this is quite nice. A good sipping beer for a lazy afternoon or an after dinner treat. Recommended."
"D: I like it. Id say for 9.3 percent, I feel like I could drink a lot of these."
"Bottle courtesy of nlmartin... thanks again!"
"Pours a deep cherry red, hazy, with good head but minimal lacing. Aroma of whiskey. This ale has a wonderul bourbon whiskey flavor, as much as you could possibly want, yet without coming across as a ""whiskey wannabe"" -- it's an ale all the way. Additional notes of coconut, brown sugar, oak, some cherry. Nice alcohol warmth. I'm a variety lover, yet this is one of the few beers I feel like I could enjoy every day."
"Another great one from a great brewery..."
"Pours a red with slight caramel coloring. Little to no head and no lacing. Smell is of pure bourbon. Vanilla, oak, malt, and sweet. Its all there. If I hadnt poured this out of a small bottle I would have guessed it was a bourbon. Taste is exactly like the smell. Strong, oaky, little to no carbonation. This is a great after dinner sipping beer. Couldnt really imagine having more than one of these but I will definitely enjoy the one that I have. I had this about 1 year ago and it was very sweet and tasted like bubblegum. It has aged into a sweet, but not cloying beer. It is a very nice beer."
"Cheers!"
"Vanilla and dark fruit notes (figs and raisins) are the first to cross the taste buds. Bourbon barrel notes are noticeable but subtle like. Coconut flavors with a sweet softness. Citrus fruit notes aren't very big, but are noticeable as the brew warms up a bit. Nice spicy alcohol laden thickness, like that of a cloud, emanates from the walls of the mouth. Smooth mouthfeel. Booze is very present, but not the main player--it's big, but still subdued. An interesting and complex brew. One that I'm thankful for getting the chance to try."
"Pours a cloudy brown/amber, thin tan head forms, nice thick lace ring around the glass, good retention, looks like a sipper! Smell is nice, bourbon, vanilla, raisin/date goodness, toffee, some chocolate, coconut, very nice. Taste is toffee, some bourbon, vanilla oak, coconut, very rich and malty, bit of roast, nice clean bitterness in the finish, just right. Mouthfeel is full bodied, low carbonation, nice heat going down. I could sip this for hours."
"Received this in a trade. I really like this style but have a hard time destinguishing the difference between old ale and an English Barleywine."
"This is a fantastic way to officially end the work day and move on into getting dinner ready for the family. I had no expectations in diggin in to this brew but am pretty impressed in its relative simplicity and drinkability. Thanks Vance!!"
"drinkability is great. well balanced and very enjoyable. just the right amount of bourbon and vanilla to make them obvious but not overpowering (and i'm usually not a huge fan of either)."
"Exactly what an old ale should be. Thick, creamy and sweet. One of the best out there."
"Hazy caramel colour with a thin white head. As the foam settled to a ring of fine bubbles, it left some spotty lacing behind. The aroma was quite complex, with wood and vanilla up front, some caramel, plenty of fruit (grapes, orange marmalade), and a little alcohol. Mild bitterness when compared to the sweetness, with caramel and toffee center stage. Some oak and raisin notes were present as well, along with a bit of alcohol. It had a soft finish with a refined fruitiness. Full bodied with lightish carbonation, some creaminess yet still a bit dry. This was really interesting and highly drinkable. It had plenty of character, almost like tasting a different beer with each sip."
"D: A good hearty Old Ale. The 9.3% ABV will sneak up on you. But another strong offering from Founder's."
"Prost!"
"Pours a cloudy brownish color, quick fizzy head, nice carbonation, left some little islands around. The nose is of malts, vanilla, and bourbon. The taste is sweet slightly malty, very much bourbon, nice touch of vanilla. Medium body. Drinkable, quite a different old ale, but very tasty. Highly recommended."
"I found this to be a very drinkable, very rich, big ale. The big body and waming effect due to the alcohol make this a perfect choice for a cool winter night. May be a little too rich to be sessionable, but might be fun to try! Will definately be enjoying this tasty treat again."
"Poured with very little head and a ton of floaties. Initial smell of sulphur (?), raisins, molasses, brown sugar. Very smooth brew. Very velvety. Definite Barley Wine qualities to ths one with a lacing that runs the whole glass. Drinkable but I would not have 2 or 3. I would stick with one and move on. A great beer though."
"Pleasant beer, worth trying though it is not my favorite old ale by far. Thanks again to MABZ for this and the other beers he recently sent."
"D - I'm not a fan, but it is something I can handle. It isn't a terribly unpleasant experience either. It just isn't for me. I won't have this again. The closest beer I can think to compare this to is Avery's Samael's Oak Aged Ale. This doesn't come close in pleasantness though, it lacks all the pleasant fruit flavors and has a shitload of butter. It also reminds me a bit of Weyerbacher's Prophecy, but not as offensive, at least in my opnion anyway. This is just way too buttery throughout. If you like drinking bourbon butter, then drink this. Otherwise avoid it."
"The pour creates a huge, thick crop of nicotine stained beige head. The retention of the oversized head is very good. The body of the beer is scarlet red. Aroma is a bit toxic and fruity. Like spiked punch. The taste, it turns out, is not toxic at all. Rather smooth and velvety. Very nice taste. Very little sign of alcohol. And very easy to drink. This is a solid Old Ale. Malts are so smooth on the palate. Fruitiness is very evident, but not overly estery in nature. Bits of caramel and toffee. This one got better as it warmed up and finished fabulously."
"Highly recommended; this is one of the most complex Founders beers I've had--and that says a lot."
"D: Very nice and tasty. I love me bourbon aged beers. But with 2-3 years under its belt, this beer would be a force to be reckoned with. Most beers of this caliber get very cloying after a period of time, this one doesn't. I would actual consider drinking another one of these right now."
"This is really good, but it's a sipper at 9.3%."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and rich. Mildly carbonated. I found this one to be filling and too bourbon-like for my beer drinking tastes to it drink regularly."
"D- Don't like this at all and don't see me making it all the way through."
"It pours out a hazy dark orange, with a small head of tiny bubbles. What's there looks creamy. Woo-ee! A potent, sweet alcohol aroma socks me in the nose. Smells oily, with caramel notes and a little banana, too. A little like Southern Comfort. The taste packs a punch, too. The caramel is there, along with alcohol, and not much bitterness - just a little in the aftertaste. In the mouth it's good - creamy, smooth, and thick. Nice. This was a good brew, but the high alcohol and the powerful presence of it would make it hard to down more than one of these. I'm still reeling some."
"Overall, the flavors and aroma are out of this world. The malt is showcased very admireably but well balanced. Very light feeling for such a strong abv. I want another!"
"D- This beer has a nice big complex woody flavor and will be great with some age."
"Poured a thick, cloudy auburn brown with little or no head to speak of, leaves the faintest little beige ring of sticky lace. Moderate sediment floats about, can be seen with a reddish hue when held to the light. Smells deeply of sweet malt,grain, dark ripened fruits, earthen notes, walnuts. Taste is also sweet and malty, resinous woodiness and nutty. Figs and dates, along with brown sugary alcohol flavor. Leaves a slightly drying aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full bodied with very low levels of carbonation, viscous, syrupy like smoothness. Drinkability is decent, a little too sweet all around, nice level of complexity pairs with a hard to detect 9.3% abv. Not a bad old ale, but I've had better. Recommend trying."
"Ripe full with complexity but not sure what else to say. Bourbon is so dominant! Leads to a strong taste despite alcohol being rather quiet. A sticky, toffee finish. Above all bourbon! Big thanks to HogTownHarry, a great finish to a fantastic tasting!"
"Tasty, this beer is best suited as a sipper and a nightcap i think; as it is a slightly agressive beer flavor-wise (rich), and i'm sure the ABV would catch up to one rather quickly."
"This is an extremely complex Old Ale...sweeter than most and I love it."
"Taste; starts out pretty sweet, and fruity, with cherries and dates, and then the oak barrel, and boozey flavors (almost vinous) make a significant appearance. The vanilla is there, but I'm picking up some coconut, that wasn't present in the nose, and a bit of a peppery spiciness. Finished sweet with caramel and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is full bodied, and very smooth. Dinkability is good for the style and abv, but you still wouldn't want to be drinking more than one or two of these in a nght."
"My sample was fairly young but I bet some time in the cellar would really mellow this and bring out even more complexity"
"Sweetness succeeds in the end, emboldened by the great fruity flavor and matched up with the booze. I love it. That's a fine compliment, from one curmudgeon to another."
"Drinkability is alright for the style. I would never sit down to a few of these. It is more of a hit and run type and nobody would likely dispute that. So, for a single serve I say what the hell, this is decent. You will not catch me filling my jug with this, but as an adventurous beer drinker it is worth a shot. If you are of barbarian blood and you enjoy a drink such as old ale, well step on up. You will most likely enjoy this creation."
"What can I say, another great brew from Founders that I've gotten to experience on draft."
"12 oz stubby. I had this one a while ago and thought it needed some time, so we'll see where it falls now. It pours a deep deep tea brown color with golden to amber highlites. A light head falls to an almost full coat over top with a solid ring. What I expected. The aroma brings lots of malt. There are incredibly deep caramel tones with a kiss of raisin fruityness and brown sugar. This definately is focused on the caramel and brown sugar with fruityness being in the background. I like it. There is a light kiss of alcohol in there too, but it adds a light spiceyness as opposed to a boozeyness. Flavors are along the lines of the nose. I find deep caramel and brown sugar, with a moderate earthy hop playing well with it. There is a modest bitter on the finish with a fairly prominent puff of alcohol that hits in my nostrils. Again, this is not offensive, but just present. There is a nice solidness about the flavor...the best I can do is to call it deep. The feel is thick with a light slickness and a very light carbonation. I'm not a fan of the slickness. It pulls a little bit of the thick feel away from the beer. This one definately carries the 9+% with it. I will sip this over the next hour or so and I won't be having anything more after it. I enjoy the flavors and aromas. I think there is a little more blending that will happen after another 6 months with this one."
"Thanks go to RedBaron for the bottle."
"edit-Just finished beer 20 minutes after starting review and it really came into its own as it warmed. A lot of the vinuous and alcohol bite had mellowed and it was quite pleasant."
" Tastes boozy and malty. There are dark fruits muddled in rum, some woody notes as well. Mouthfeel is quite full and lightly carbonated. The filling nature of this beer is the only thing that limits its drinkability for me."
"There's no head with little lacing that doesn't stick very well. The smell is sweet brown with butterscotch. It's pungent like perfume, very very sweet perfume. It also has a slight spicyness. It's like wet/sweet wood or cardboard with a sweet sweet brown sugar with spices. Mouthfeel is a little smooth with some good carbonation. I wouldn't have another unless it was fresh only because I was told it was great."
"Pours dark amber to brown in color with a very small tan head that quickly fades back. Aroma doesn't do a lot for me, there is just the faintest hint of raisins, but I mainly get a sweet maltiness with some boozy alcohol, not bad, just not overly complex. Taste follows suit although has a little more going on. There is a sweet grape-raisin flavor along with nice sugary caramel sweetness. The alcohol is evident and nicely warms the back of the throat on the first couple sips. Medium sugary body is well balanced by a lightly spicy alcohol presence and a decently dry finish."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting on 8/16/06: Dark amber/brown color with a thin beige head that starts fizzy but calms quickly. Thin spotty lacing. Aroma of whisky, coconut and dark fruits. Rich, smooth body with pungent malt, bourbon and other spicy alcohol flavors. The finish is all coconut and whisky. Definitely different from the norm, and seems pretty raw all around. I would be curious to try an aged bottle."
"Comments  Thanks to my good friend and temporary landlord skyhand for putting me up for a few nights while I was in town and feeding me this exceptional dessert."
"Taste- Pretty darkly yet portly vinous. Pretty good combination of malty sweet and viney tart. The currant like flavors mix well with some red malts and prunes that better define the sweetness."
"A very nice Old Ale. Fulfilling and dreamy."
"brown and thick-looking. small head that receeds to just a coating of small bubbles. looks like a glass of watered down maple syrup. sweet odor with hints of chocolate bars, ginger, pine, toffee, oak, ethanol and dates. Very delicious taste. sweetness is the first flavor along with kind of a sharp alcohol bite, but this quickly mellows to a fantastic mix of chocolate, cherries, oak, dates and a fudgey/caramelly blend. Extremely smooth mouthfeel. Way to go again, Founder's. Im looking forward to my first breakfast stout and my second kentucky breakfast, both of which are burning holes in my DBF."
"Drinkability: Nice, rich and boozy, with great malts and a nice biting finish. Definitely a beer that I'll come back to, particularly as the weather turns colder."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head over the cloudy reddish brown brew. Head quickly fades to an uneven layer of bubbles, and lacing is average, both somewhat expected for the style. Aroma is vanilla oaky alcohol, possibly over the top, but the variety of flavors is enough to possibly overcome the somewhat exceptional intensity. Taste is also vanilla and oak, with strong alcohol throughout and a warming close. Wish there was a bit more of a malt sweetness background to support all the strong flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth, even if the drinkability is somewhat limited by the flavor harshness, in my mind. Age might help this mellow a bit and make a winner."
"Overall- A wonderful beer. Flavorful, complex, and worth buying another even at its steep price tag of $3.79 I cant really ask for more."
"The weakness is really the cost - $15 for a four pack. If it were cheaper it would make it into my daily rotation."
"It could stand to be a little more drinkable, but that would probably take away from the wonder that is this beer. Founders is quickly becoming one of my favorite brewers."
"I had been looking forward to trying an Ole Ale and I was looking forward to trying something from Founders, so I killed two proverbial birds with one proverbial stone. I’m now looking forward to trying more of both."
"This is a unique ale. That exotic sweetness will have you tasting things you don't usually get in beer (to my senses pineapple and watermelon liqueur), but it maintains good balance and depth too. Glad to have experienced this one...thanks to BA jabocu for the trade."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer but I would recommend aging this one out for a while. It isn't bad right now but I definately thing it would improve over time."
"Thanks to flyingbison for this Curmudgeon."
"I always feel bad when I rate an Old Ale that isn't very old. But, since it is on the shelves, I will drink, and I will rate. Gulp....yep, it needs more time. There are some really nice flavors going on, but the beer is everywhere. The nose brings out everything from candied malts to spicy hops to dark fruits to caugh syrup. The tastes closely mimic the aromas, but with emphasis on a candy sweetness, harsh alcohols, and raisons and licorice. The beer feels a bit too hot and scrubbing in the mouth with sugary stickiness. It will be nice to see how the beer develops over the next year or two, but it's not ready yet. Thanks Clvand0 for the bottle."
"This is my first beer where I said, whoa, this really needs to mellow out a bit. The alcohol was just intense and the flavors took some time and warmer temperature to escape. I really did enjoy this but even more importantly, look forward to trying this again . . . and again . . . and again."
"Pours thick and coffee colored with minimal head. Bright mahogany highlights. Assertive aroma of bourbon-vanilla and chocolate-covered bananas. Sumptuous. Hits the palate with authority. Bourbon, vanilla, bananas again, along with sweet cream and coffee all make appearances. Just a touch of hop bitterness shows up in the finish. Very thick on the palate, as one would expect. Quite rich, flavorful, interesting old ale. Up there with the best of the American microbrewed old ales."
"Big, big beer. A mistake on this evening, parked in front of a fan while braving the last of a humid 90-degree day. But don't go far, old man. I will be looking for you the moment the snow falls."
"This is an interesting beer. I don't like the nutmeg note at all and it loses a point for that. I'd be interested in trying this one in another year or two and seeing how it matures. Recommended but not at the top of my list for the style."
"Kickass."
"12 ounce bottle. Old Curmudgeon pours out a hazy brown color topped with a medium sized head. The aroma is tropical fruits, dates, spices, and bourbon characteristics like oak, vanilla, and coconut. Sweet, malty flavor with lots of coconut and fruit. Finishes harsh and metallic. Perhaps this beer could use some aging to mellow it a bit. The flavor is spicier than I like, but it's still a good flavor. Mouthfeel is medium. Decent drinkability. This is an interesting beer, but with all the quality old ales and barleywines out there, there are better choices."
"Aroma is pineapple (heavily) accented liquor that I assume is bourbon, but could pass for rum in a crowded bar. The aroma is quite unusual though and curiously it is more easily discerned sniffing from the bottle than from my snifter. In the bottle the aroma is heavily bourbon with some pineapple understones. In the glass the two mesh equally and a bit of floral hops lays beneath. The body is opaque and brown/amber in color. It had a head the size of a quarter, but only very briefly. The fore is a blast of smooth sweet malts and bourbon...lots of bourbon. Oak, vanilla (combining to coconut) and the faintest traces of sweet tropical fruits follow. I want to know where these bourbon barrels came from. Tastes a lot like a a bourbon with melted ice, but the thick palate and smooth malt undertones keep it from getting too far down the road away from the realm of beer. Its a heady drink and I swear I get a lingering pineapple/ malibu rum flavor in the far aftertase. A sipper for sure."
"This poured an amber brown that was a little hazy into a tulip glass with a thin tan head that evaporated rather quickly. The aroma was a swift kick in face, scotch and malt. The taste was a little more complex, like a good scotch. There were hints of vanilla, dark fruit, and whiskey barrel aged flavor that was unexpectedly amazing. The mouthfeel was nice and full with little carbonation. This is absolutely a beer to be sipped, with the flavors and high alcohol presence, one could easily forget that this is beer and not scotch/whiskey."
"Fantastic old ale, smooth and light carbonation, strange release date, though. Would age nicely."
"Wow!!!! What an amazing beer. I dig the oak aged thing, but this by far one of the best. It's so well balanced I could drink it all day long."
"An interesting beer and one with some interesting flavors going on. Alcohol is apparent throughout the sample, but this remains a good sipper. I enjoyed it, but for the retail price in MA, will probably be unlikely to by it in the store."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Pours out to a tea like hazy ruby color with a small head of tan foam that quickly dissipated. Aromas of whiskey, malt, vanilla, fermented grain, earth. Nice. Taste is fair; complex notes of whiskey and wood, with hints of burnt malts permeate the palate. Touches of raw grain and vanilla are noted on the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy. Drinkabilty is fair. One is more than enough for me. The bourbon flavors are too overpowering, making this more of a liquor like experience, than a beer like experience."
"what do i think overall? tough call. like a stinky old man, you have to respect the work that went into its culmination, regardless of how gritty his current situation might be. recommended, oddly."
"Wouldn't drink too many in a sitting."
"Tastes gentle oaky on a nice malt sweet. Vanilla and caramel. A touch of sherry. Oranges and cherry. Simple sweet and tasty. Gentle and clean alcohol sting. Thick creamy mouthfeel and almost no carbonation. Nothing special, just a solid offering."
"Interesting though it may be, I'm not sure I could see myself buying this again."
"As we can perhaps discern from the label, this is an unapologetic, strong beer. It pours a dense, cloudy brown color, and has an oaky, almost scotch-like scent. It tastes like an english ale with a dollop of good whisky; although it has a certain pervasive boozy flavor, one that is certainly somewhat unbalanced, it's appropriate for the style. This is a full-bodied beer, almost to the point of chewiness. It's not what I'd call eminently drinkable, because of its kick; I found myself sipping it absently, like a neat whisky."
"Founder's really gets their flavors out strong and this bourbon beer is no exception. Some good complexity but end the end the bourbon dominates. If you like bourbon try this, if not, don't."
"Slàinte!"
"This one really shows a lot of complexity at room temperature. Very nice sipper. The smokiness evokes the taste of burning a caramel apple over an outdoor campfire, deep in the Upper Penninsula woods. Age a few of these and save for deep winter!! You'll be glad you did."
"A sipper fo' sho' because it is so thick and slightly syrupy. Would probably age wonderfully."
"Great stuff. Founders has not dissapointed me yet, with their beers ranging from solid to excellent."
"good drinkability the alcohol is present, but never burns or becomes abrasive, it just stays pleasant and warming."
"D: this is a good one to sip on, a little over the top on the Bourbon taste but pretty good. Should probably let sit for a year to mellow out the taste. I think I will go buy some more before it's too late and let it sit in my cellar."
"I would recommend this beer to anyone who fancies high gravity beer with that fantastic bourbon creme taste"
"12 oz bottle pours a dark amber color with a nice off white head with large bubbles that leaves some lacing in my glass. Strong bourbon aromas, vanilla, oak and bourbon flavors, a bit to strong for me. Full bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry. The whiskey flavor is about all I get from this."
"D - Wow, I have been waiting to try this beer for awhile, not knowing what to expect. This is truly great. It's very drinkable to me."
"This is a delightful suprise. This is a very tasty brew."
"Pours a nearly opaque dark garnet-amber with an afterthought of off-white head. Nose and taste start off with what my roommates and I could only describe as Malibu rum, buttressed by warm vanilla and oaky bourbon. Mouthfeel is substantial, almost chewy and reflective of the complexity of flavors within. Probably a one and done for me, but a nice sipper while playing darts at the Come Back and a steal at $2 a bottle."
"Drinkability - not at all. I do not like bourbon."
"Overall impression: Drain pour. Glad I bought a single. Would someone please STOP the barrel-aging, over-oaked, over-bourboned silliness??? It's tired and it does nothing to showcase a brewer's talent or anything that fine beer ingredients can provide in terms of flavor. Avoid."
"from the bottle, poured a cloudy brown with a small tan head that left no lacing. aroma just like the description says aged on bourbon barrels and the boubron comes out nice and strong than some sweetness along with the malts couldnt get anything else out of it after it warms the aroma subsides a bet. flavor, the bourbon was as strong as the aroma which was a could thing, than along came the malts and sweetness got molasses, and some dark fruits became easier to drink when it warmed"
"12 oz. bottle, 9.3 % AVB on the label. Pours a very cloudy mahogany/bronze color. Thick off white head disappears very quick. Aroma is very vinous. Notes of oak, coconut, and vanilla. Almost sherry like in flavor. The oak flavor is very strong, and may need to mellow out a bit. Alcohol is well hidden until this warms to room temperature. A hint of spices as it warms as well. Some hop bitterness at the end, but all seems to be overshadowed by the woody aspect of this beer. I am not saying that it is bad, but I think some cellar time could make this an outstanding beer. Very complex, and interesting. Certainly worth revisiting in the future."
"i want some for my cellar!"
"Not my favorite Founders brew...still a nice offering."
"Altogether, it not my favorite Founders. A complex beer in flavor, though, and well crafted. A sipper. Just a little too much like whiskey for my liking."
"I could have a few more of these. 3 more in the cellar. Can't wait to see how they taste with some age."
"The bottom line: A nice effort by Founders...truly distinct from the other old ales that are out there with a beautiful oak cask flavour that is worth trying out. One of my favourites from Founders, and I've had most of their portfolio on multiple occasions. In terms of its style, it's my favourite domestic offering, and the taste chracteristics here are almost scotch like in certain ways, which is, of course, excellent. If you like ole ales you must try this."
"I could see this being a love it or hate it beer. I happen to love it and am glad I picked up a couple four packs."
"Pours a very deep amber color with tons of ruby highlights. A small cream colored head forms, but leaves quickly, leaving some spotty lacing. Very hazy. This beer reminds me of Jolly Pumpkin's Biere de Mars, but heavier on the alcohol. Boozy, oaky, malts are the aromas that really jump out at you. Some tropical fruit smells and spices are also swirling around. Taste mimics the smell, heavy on the malts, oak and booze. Finishes with a slight hoppy bitterness. Semi sweet. To me, a complex beer, that reveals more as it warms. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, with adequate carbonation. Kinda heavy, a definite sipper. I really enjoyed this beer, it might take some time for this one to grow on people. I have a couple bottles to age and compare notes. Give this one a shot! Another great beer, from my favorite brewery!"
"Edit: I stopped swirling for two minutes and the urine is back."
"Good good good. I can't see myself reaching back into the cooler to get another fix like the good old Kentucky Breakfast Stout made me do several times, but this here is good stuff Maynard."
"On tap at Pizza Plant on Transit in Williamsville, NY. Awesome, since I've never seen any Founders beers anywhere in WNY. Served in a goblet. Hazy mahogany. Thin but dense beige cap. Utterly beautiful sticky lacing. Nose is quite faint: roasty caramel malts, bourbon, fruity esters, mild citrusy-floral hops. Port-like flavor; rum-soaked citrus peels, piney bitterness all on a sturdy cherry and caramel malt platform. 9.3% abv is apparent, but not inappropriately so. Rich, full mouthfeel; medium bodied and assertive. This is really tasty stuff, but the alcohol strength is definitely of the ass-kicking variety. I'd love to have more than one of these, but it would require that I have a DD. Top notch."
"On-tap at Pizza Plant Transit. It was so good it was as if it was brewed right here. Dark boddy with thin head. Stouty roast aroma. Hoppy and spicy. Medium-full body. I like the style, it's more drinkable than a barleywine. The understated carbonation at this location does it justice."
"Drinkability: The good malty base, rich fruity sweet combo and nice toasty tang make this a very tasty brew. The waitress/barmaid told me this was a brown ale, but perhaps she was mistaken."
