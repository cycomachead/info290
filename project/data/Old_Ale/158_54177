4.19,4.2,4.25,4.5,4,4,4.25,"2011 750 ml bottle at Euclid Hall in Denver, poured 6-29-14. Pours dark brownish amber, slightly murky, with a small off white to khaki head. The head recedes quickly and there is just a rim around the edges by the time I take a sip. Aroma is big bourbon notes, heavy caramel malts, light molasses, vanilla, oak, and more bourbon. Flavor follows the aroma rather closely with a nice caramel molasses feel, supported by bourbon in the background. Light vanilla notes are there, but not as strong as when fresh I would guess. Body is thinner than expected--especially after loving regular hibernation so much--but maybe a slight nitpick. Still some decent carbonation in this one. Definitely a beer to seek out if you can find it. Not sure it was worth the $54 price tag at the restaurant, but hey, you only live once.","BMMillsy","May 04, 2014"

Nose expresses bourbon notes, wood and a hint of ethanol. As the brew begins to warm I also get a lightly sugared and toffee-like character. Taste is fairly subtle. While it is somewhat consistent with the nose there is also something else happening in the flavor profile - not quite sour or tart, but definitely a character that cuts through the anticipated sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a mild carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Overall, a very drinkable Old Ale with a well-hidden abv. Not my favorite BA Old Ale, but it is quite pleasant and goes down so easily.","Jwale73","Feb 14, 2012"

If this had a lot more caramelized maltiness and quite a bit of a richer, hell even sweeter, body that could stand up to the barrel influence, this would be a much better experience. The beer actually seems to do well in very small amounts; if I come back to it after a while I can take a small sip or two that maintains a balance to it, but it ends up getting thin, somewhat too spicy, and a bit too hot after any more than this.","Gueuzedude","Jan 12, 2012"

4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Big thanks goes out to Rake who sent me this one in a past trade! 2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured reddish brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, very sweet alcohol, toffee, subtle brown sugar, and a touch of caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, sweet alcohol, wood, toffee, caramel, and subtle brown sugar. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a fairly solid brew. The barrels really shined through on this one and made their presence known. I wasn't expecting this as the brew had been aging in my cellar for this long, but was pleasantly surprised what I did find. A solid offering from Great Divide and I look forward to trying the bottle of BA Old Ruffian I have in my cellar to conplete the set.","thagr81us","Nov 29, 2011"

The whiskey barrel really overwhelmed the base beer leaving the flavor profile slightly one dimentional. While is was tasty, I won't be seeking out any more with great effort in the near future.","claspada","Aug 18, 2011"

4.17,3.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Smell is sweet malts with notes of brown sugar, toffee, caramel and oak surrounded in whiskey. Taste follows nicely with rich flavors providing a fairly sweet Old Ale that is thick with low carbonation. Glad I got a chance to try this one.","Lunch","Mar 21, 2011"
4.1,2,4,4,4.5,3,4,"Darn good and yet, I am dissapointed. Maybe its past its prime. I don't dislike it, but its not as good as I was hoping for. A bit too boozy, a touch too thin, but still very good.","BradLikesBrew","Mar 21, 2011"

4.39,9.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Beer is medium in body and quite sweet like candy on the front. There is a nice bourbon presence in the midpalate and the finish is appropriately heavy and not dry. There is not much bitterness at the back, less than I expected which shifts my focus to the front half of the beer, leaving me with nothing to linger on in the back. The flavors of toffee and caramel are a nice counterpoint to the booziness of the midpalate and booziness is not out of place for the overall experience of the beer. I really enjoyed, a sleeper beer for sure, people should be more excited about this one. The base beer is also quite good.","drabmuh","Mar 20, 2011"
4.25,5.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"d - Overall I thought this was a really great old ale. I loved the taste and would have liked a little more bourbon in the nose and carbonation in the mouthfeel, but still an awesome beer. Would love to try again sometime.","mdfb79","Jan 16, 2011"
3.73,-7.2,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a moderate brown color and is slightly murky. Nose contained a good amount of toffee as well as some light caramel. Some brown sugar and light barrel character there as well. Not super complex, but the barrel character was seriously nice, coming through particularly well in the finish, which was exquisite. Taste was caramel and bourbon. Nice. Mouthfeel was ridiculously smooth and lacked nearly any alcohol presence. Low carbonation and a medium body. A nice offering, and the mouthfeel was really killer. Big highlight for me.","Thorpe429","Jan 02, 2011"

4.6,14.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Tried this beer at Donnelly's in Fairport, New York. Exceptional taste and surprisingly high in ABV, despite it not tasting like it should be.

4.5,11.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Creamy md-light in the mouth with mild carbonation. Great drinkability and this will improve in a couple years as the alcohol heat settles more and the flavors meld together.","mentor","May 24, 2010"
3.8,-5.5,4,4,4,4,3,"Certainly a strange barrel-aged old ale, the whiskey barrel didn't impart much of the caramel and vanilla sweetness I've come to expect from this type of beer, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's a leathery, tannic, fairly oxidized and complex sipper.","largadeer","Apr 15, 2010"

3.9,-3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a thinnish looking brown color, with a light brown head that doesn't stick around for long. Huge bourbon aromas dominate, but there is also vanilla, toffee, oak and dark fruit. Huge boozy palate, with loads of bourbon. Eventually I get a little caramel, toffee and brown sugar before the warming alcohol takes over. Totally different from the original hibernation.","emmasdad","Mar 10, 2010"
4.12,2.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Great drinkability, a luxury that alas may not stack up to many other Old ales, barrel aged or not; if you are seeking value for your dollar. Thrilled to have tried this, but was expecting more to be honest","russpowell","Mar 06, 2010"

4.07,1.2,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall a nice change up for me. I thought it could have been a little bigger, for the time it spent in the barrel it was very mellow and nicely done. Maybe with a year or so on it it will really start to flourish.","mikesgroove","Jan 05, 2010"
3.99,-0.7,3.5,4.5,4,3,4,"Overall, this was pretty decent. The ale is a little to light and the flavor didn't really soak up the oak and the bourbon as much.","jrallen34","Jan 02, 2010"
3.78,-6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"I'm a big fan of the regular Hibernation and, to me, this isn't quite as good. It's completely dominated by the barrel character, which overshadows the solid beer underneath.

3.92,-2.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"This beer really needs some age. It is drinking really hot and it is difficult to get anything but alcohol out of the flavor.","br3wmeister","Nov 24, 2009"

3.27,-18.7,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Overall, this is not overdone with the alcohol like the bourbon yeti was. Both barrel versions I've had have been very lightly carbonated. I'm surprised by how subdued the flavors were for me, given how complex original Hibernation is. It's interesting to try, but regular Hibernation is better, and this is not worth $25 a bottle.","Beaver13","Nov 19, 2009"
3.45,-14.2,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Bottle #376/492 $25. I am a big fan of the regular version so I gave up the $25 for this one which I will say is not as good as the regular version unless you really like whiskey. It might be a shade darker than the standard version or maybe its just hazier. It smells like whiskey, alcohol, really an interesting smell. The flavor is really overwhelmed by the barrel-aging to the point that I can barely tell its Hibernation any more. Whiskey, wood, alcohol, vanilla, intense but just doesn't do it for me.","ArrogantB","Nov 16, 2009"
