"Best of the Ola Dubh series I have had. Bit more sweetness and chocolate, still nice smokey peat but not as dry and boring as some of the higher numbered year ones. Nicely done."

"This beer has a strong iron smell along with other minerals. It tastes of a wet gravel pit. The oak is there and offers some nice tannins and vanilla notes. With plenty of peat and mineral flavors coming from barrels And water.  There is baking chocolate flavor also. I liked this beer a lot it is probably the most interesting beer I have had under 10 bucks. I would definitely buy again and can't wait to try  a taste of all three barrels aged beers."
"O- So ya I probably let this one sit to long, It has a overwhelming smoke/ peat flavor almost intense, malts and scotch follow up nicely after. The finish is a smokey mixture of malt and slight scotch. Still really good if you like heavy smoked beer."
"Enjoy!"

"overall: tasty, good looking. What's not to like?"

"Serving type: bottle."
"Good lord! If you find this on tap you should kick yourself if you don't try this awesome brew. Enough said."
"O – A bit thin and slightly harsh, from the alcohol mostly.  A lot of interesting flavor, but a bit off-balance."

"OVERALL: Excellent. This is a flavorful, well balanced and complex brew with just the right amount of peat as well. Though I’ve never had it fresh, I can imagine letting it sit until after the best by date did no bit of harm. Perhaps a touch more weight and a slightly darker colored head would make this the perfect scotch barreled stout. If you’re a monster peat fan, this won’t quite satisfy your craving. However, if you enjoy layered flavors and can appreciate balance and subtlety, this will be right up your alley. Loved this. Cheers to whoever helped out with this."

"O: Another great brew from Harviestoun. Old Engine Oil is still my favorite, but this one has a lot of the oak/whisky flavors to it. A very rich and interesting beer - would pair well with a steak with a strong sauce, or also a nice beer to have after lunch as a desert. (4.25)"

"Pours jet black beer with creamy tan one finger head. Absolutely outstanding smell - tender, milky, a bit peaty, coffee, chocolate. Flavour is viscous, peaty, whiskey, prunes, roasted malts, cofee, chocolate, all in excellent proportions, alcohol is well-hidden. Woody and mindblowing."

"330 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, chocolate, toast, brown sugar, roast, raisin, fig, brown bread, molasses, vanilla, oak, tobacco, leather, peat smoke, and roast/oak earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and whisky cask notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, toast, raisin, fig, dark bread, molasses, vanilla, oak, peat smoke, tobacco, leather, and roast/oak earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, roast, toast, dark bread, raisin, fig, tobacco, leather, vanilla, oak, peat smoke, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a white. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and whisky cask flavors; with a nice balance of the oak character with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent old ale. All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and whisky cask flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Final Grade: 4.38, an impressive A. My only regret concerning Ola Dubh Special Reserve 12 is that I neglected to pick up a second bottle of the stuff. This is a delicious ale that I would recommend highly to all BAs looking for a proper oak aged beer, and may also have some appeal to Scotch whisky fans as well. It's not cheap, but I don't mind paying for quality - and with that in mind, I'll have to keep an eye out for the other beers in the Ola Dubh series."

"O: I decided to let this bottle go after finding myself with a couple of the Ola Dubh Special Reserve 30s. I have to say, this is a damn fine beer, and my only regret is that I didn't wait longer to open it, as I feel it would have only gotten better. There is so much flavor and character in this beer that I wish it was a 750 ml instead of a 330 ml so that I could enjoy it longer. Now...if I can get the one away from my buddy that I know he has..."

"Overall - A little thin/watery and the wood doesn't really show up much. I'm also not a fan of a smoked meat type flavour in my beer. I had higher hopes for this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Top-notch. As barrel-aged stouts go this is quite subtle, but the character is wonderfully integrated. Looks the part, with an aroma and flavour of rich roasted malt, dried fruit and subtle whisky highlights. The body is satisfyingly unctuous, though a little more carbonation would be nice. Delicious - a touchstone in UK barrel-aged brews. This should go on your must-try list."

"Poured from 330 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 1/31/14."

"Overall - A very good, yet rather different old ale, that really emphasizes smoke, probably one of the two or three smokiest beers I've had that isn't Rauchbier. And while the price is rather steep, this is one beer I'm glad I could say I tried, since it was a unique experience to me."
" I poured it in to a Chimay chalice and saw that this stuff looks like old motor oil. No problem though, I'm cool with that. Unfortunately that was last thing I was cool with concerning this beer. There was only a mild aroma and the beer tasted even less dramatic with very little carbonation. All in all this was a very bland, unremarkable beer that definitely wasn't worth the price. Cannot recommend."
""

""
""
"Next step- if I can find a bottle-Harvistoun Engine Oil."
"overall impressive for only 8%. recommended."
""
"in some ways I like 12 better than 16 or 18, the reason being, that it still tastes like beer. although some may say this is still more whiskey than beer, to me its the perfect balance. dark brown in color, rich for an old ale, same looks as the others with perhaps a little better head, but its been awhile and this one is on tap. the nose is great, woody and earthy and rich in malt profile, well roasted and toasted, not burnt but real dark. the whiskey isn't sharp, but mellow and clean, strong too, smells like more than 8% abv, that's for sure. the taste is great. tons of roast and body without any bitterness. the whiskey treatment is very effective, the beer has some charcoal to it, as well as vanilla and oak, but not in a sweet way, its more refined, more old school in some sense, more precise, more groovy, hard to describe. its all balanced up well, like the whiskey characteristics could be controlled independently of one another, you know, less vanilla here, more oak there, even though that's not possible, it seems that well dialed in. I prefer this to the 16 and 18 honestly, although I would still love to try the older ones, this is a genuinely great beer."
""
""
"Drinkability : a nice beer in the English style Old Ale."
""
"I like old ales, barley wines etc. this one is good if you like peat smoke scotch whiskey aromas and enjoy bacon with your beer."
""
""
"earthy, roasted malts, smoked wood, minimal whiskey flavors.... peat. very earthy. nice flavors although very still. no carbonation. seems a little thin from what I was expecting but i'd like to try the others..."

""

""
""
"o - Overall a beer that is definitely very good, but hard to justify for the price.I actually liked this a lot more than the 16, but again, not worth the price for me at $12/glass or even more for a 11.2 oz. bottle. Lots of chocolate and scotch to it, if you don't like scotch I'd suggest saving your money for something else. If you have the money to spend and like scotch/old ales, this series would be fun to check out."

"O - Alcohol is noticeable but well balanced by the sweetness and the barrel aging."
""
""

"Cheers."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel - A bit of a let down really. Not much of a body to support what is in every other way a huge beer. As expected for the style, carbonation is very low."
"The taste is smokey, with whiskey dominating the taste. I would have to describe as an oaky, smokey beer flavored whiskey without the alcohol punch. I like it!"
""
""
""
"Disclaimer: this bottle was purchased in Las Vegas cold and not kept at optimum temperature. I have another bottle (2011) purchased at the Highland Park Distillery that has been more properly stored; may change my assessment after opening that one"

"Overall : This beer was good. I would buy this beer again given the chance however I'm not sure i would seek this beer out on a regular basis."
""
"overall: A great barrel aged beer, lot's of smokiness and oak cask flavors, yet not too much. Would buy again, but I prefer the Special 18 reserve which is only a few dollars more."
""
""
"O: Interesting old ale. Scotch notes are not too harsh, but rather well integrated. Nice and mellow. Great balance of scotch flavors and roasted malt. It may be due to the age, but the smoke is nicely subdued, sweetened by the milk chocolate. Ends up being a really nice combination."
""
""

"Overall Impression: I was very impressed by this ale. It obviously takes in a fair amount of scotch character from the barrel to balance roasted malts with peaty/smoky flavor. Dark Chocolate and sugar sweetness are prevalent in the middle of the drink, but subside slightly as the roastiness comes back in the finish. I think this is a stellar ale, with the only draw back being the slightly too alcoholic nose. I am attributing this nose to the fact that the ale was aged in 12-year whiskey barrels rather than older whiskey, so the alcoholic notes in the barrel will be less mellowed and more pervasive, thus more pervasive in the ale. Fantastic beer overall though."

"O - a subtle floral edge, vanilla coffee, slight earthiness, very nice beer overall with a pleasant dry finish. 4.25"
""
""
""
""

"overall a very tasty brew, complex, mildly alcoholic, with my untrained palate i couldnt feel the whiskey cask ageing kick in, but i still enjoyed this immensely."
""
"The beer is black with a small tan head. The aroma offers roast, chocolate, alcohol, oak, smoke, scotch. Very nice. Lovely flavor following the scent. Easy to sip and savor. Medium bodied. Vanilla, chocolate, light booze. The 12 year was a bit smoother than the 21 year, actually, though the barrel character was less pronounced. All in all, a delicious beer."

"O - this is my first harviestoun brew, but won't be my last. I really enjoyed the 12 and will pick up a few more. Ill do the 16 in a few days, but for now I'm left admiring a brilliant black old ale. I'm big on scotch and bourbon and this one is pure class. I'd recommend Highland park scotch to anyone and after this I can say Harviestoun puts the same amount of brilliance and class into this ale. A real treat."
"O - I've had my share of scotch & this comes across as a great scotch beer. Really peaty & smokey and smooth as velvet."
""
""
"Overall: some really great character to this beer, definitely at least partially imparted by the scotch barrels; always like a brew that takes you on a ride of experiences from first sniff to finish, and this is one of them"
""
""
""
"While this bottle was enjoyed from a Glen Cairn snifter with George, it would be fantastic for reading or contemplation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice beer blended and executed very nicely. By coincidence, my scores for the Ola Dubh series rise as the age of the whiskey barrels do. I'd love to say that it was intentional."
""
""
"Overall – Quite tasty and well worth a try. It had a nice roasted and whiskey flavor with all the flavors melding well throughout the taste experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Decent. I'd not buy it again though. The 16 had a much improved barrel character."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
"Love this beer! So excited that I finally found it. I'm a huge whisky fan, so having the two combined is certainly a huge perk. I find this beer intense, but very inviting and welcoming. The alcohol level is appropriate and the concentration really propels this beer to the next level. Amazing!"
"Poured into a goblet. Pours black with a thin, quickly dissipating tan head. There are some visible alcohol legs. I pick up the aroma of dark roasted barley malt, chocolate, oak, and that familiar whisky aroma. Those dark roasted malt notes hit up front and the whisky comes right through in the back. I also detect that oak and chocolate from the nose. The malt profile almost comes across as porter-like. Many of those flavors come through in the aftertaste. The body is full with low carbonation. The beer is smooth, but also sticky. It is easy to consume for an 8% beer. This is an excellent beer that I wouldn't mind having again."
""
"Pours a blackish brown. No head, no lacing. Smells of malt, soysauce, whiskey, and thats about it. Taste really is not that great. Soy sauce, whiskey, none of the old ale flavors that I'm used to. Mouthfeel is very thin. Overall, man, this was a major let down. I had high expectations for this, and now I wish I could get my money back. Very underwhelming, and just not very good flavors. Too much soy sauce, and little of anything else good. Once was one to many."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer for the scotch lover."
""
"Cheers LampertLand"
"Overall: this is a very good and satisfying beer. It is well-crafted and I'd definitely have it again."
"Long warming finish even though ABV is only 8%."
""
""
""
"O: I wish this tasted as it smells, because it has quite a burnt flavour profile. I was expecting something sweeter with more caramel and chocolate flavours. However, it is still enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2.5 D: These beers smell great, but then ultimately disappoint. The base for these is weak and the barrel overshadows it by far too much. Only the 18 year to go, then I'm done with this unsatisfying, overpriced series."
"O: A beer that you definitely should take your time to drink. The smells and tastes are its strengths."
""
""
"O: Nothing spectacular really. Just a fancy label. Couldn't taste much of the barrel flavor because it is overdominated by smoked malts."
"O: Worth a try, perhaps, but not worth buying again, especially at the price point. Actually, I wouldn't buy it again at half the price. Too roasty/smoky and does not have enough complexity to redeem itself."
"Good beer."
""
"M: Dry on the finish, the barrel doesn't completely take over the ale. The pairing for flavors is nice though, a sweet nightcap."
"With little doubt a good introduction to the Old Dubh series. Fans of scotch are sure to love this beer too."
""
"It pours out a deep brown, small head. The aroma is sweet, with the scotch jumping right out at me. Dark fruits and roasted malts are hanging out underneath. The taste is very nice, with the dark fruits and roasted malts of the old ale coming through first, but an excellent whisky taste coming through at the end, with a touch of peat and smoke. Very good. The mouthfeel has a nice amount of carbonation, and the drinkability is actually quite good. A great barrel-aged beer. Recommended for the scotch fan."
"Overall a neat brew that I really enjoyed - was not sure about the sweetness but by the end of the brew I got it"

"Pours a dark brown cola like color with little to no light escaping when held to the light. The beer starts with a one and a half finger off white head which recedes immediately and leaves sticky lines on the glass. The aroma is of dark chocolate and then a nice big whiskey barrell aroma. The taste has a dark chocolate and coffee taste up front which gives way to a slight dark fruit sweetness. There is then a slight vanilla flavor before the taste of whiskey takes over and finishes the beer off. The mouthfeel is mildly carbonated and sticky. Overall this is a great beer, it is an easy drink despite the high alcohol. The whiskey barrell is very pronounced in the aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
"O: very nice beer. very tasty and not too heavy or overwhelming. nice balance."
""
"Overall this is a very nice old ale. The sweeter molasses and fruit is nicely balanced by the whisky barrel. It has a nice complexity from this. The barrel would be interesting if it was integrated a little more with the rest of the beer, but it's very good as-is, regardless. Good beer and worth a try, even at the very high price ($9.19 for 11.2 oz for me)."
"O- I'm not even a huge dark beer guy, but this is amazing. Can't wait to try the 16-year."
""
"Overall, quite nice. Doesn't hurt that I am like Highland Park very much."
""
""
"Overall a great beer with lots of character. If you like scotch you will enjoy this."
""
""
""
"This is quite tasty, definitely wasn't wowed by it buy still tasty."
""
""
""
"Overall - This dark, brooding mixture borrows characteristics from a scotch (or scotch whiskey) more than it does a whiskey. I think any scotch connoisseur will tell you this (I used to be quite nerdy about scotch before I discovered beer). This is the peat, first and foremost. This is what blends with the beer to give it that dark woody, smokey flavor. At only 8%, there is not a lot to hide here in terms of alcohol (in comparison to beers like the Abt 12 or the Cuvée van de Keizer Blue). But regardless, this is a reasonably smooth ale. A wonderful change. A wonderful experience. Now I need to run out and try other vintage years!"
""
"**I should note this beer was served cold, perhaps with the chance to raise to an appropriate temperature, the flavor would have been more present.**"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought it was pretty drinkable, but not all that good. Thought this would be way better. Hopefully that isn't true of the others in the series."
"A bit too smoky with not enough malt to balance it out."
"This brew poured out much like the others in the series. The beer was very dark in color with a thin tan head that faded very quickly. The smell of the beer has a lot of whiskey/scotch aromas to it along with some other roasted chocolaty aromas. The taste of the beer was pretty strong to me, I found it to be more harsh than the others in the series. The mouthfeel was with out much carbonation at all, the feel was a little on the watery side. Overall I just wasn't digging this one too much."
""
""
"Overall: Not a beer that I would ever consider again. Being that it was my first barrel aged beer this may be more because I am not fond of the genre and less because of the beer."
""
""
"D - As already stated, not quite as good as the Reserve 30, but a great beer that was thoroughly enjoyable. Looking forward to the Reserve 16."
"O - A rich and bold brew, loaded with flavour. Certainly a after-dinner drink, and though a tad pricey it is well worth it. You will not be disappointed."
""
""
"Overall a very unique brew and one that is certainly enjoyed on a cold winter night."
"A very different beer, and worth the premium price to try. That being said, I'm glad I don’t own a case of it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very nice beer. I would drink it in place of a stout at times. Right now as I drink it, I notice it has some of the warming qualities in my chest that I get with whisky. It makes a great brew for enjoying on a cold, winter day."
""
""
""
""
"Had a chance to grab some o' this stuff earlier today, so I figured I'd strike while the iron was still relatively hot. It pours a murky black-brown topped by about a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises raisins, mild peat char, light roasted malts, tobacco, light vinyl, black pepper, milk chocolate, and a touch of vanilla. Man, this stuff comes off as all-over-the-place, but in a good way. The taste holds notes of candi sugar, caramel, tobacco, vanilla, cocoa, very light peat smoke, clove, figs, and light steak. The body is a limpid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slightly swampy feel. Overall, a very nice brew, one that shows how cask-aging can really create an artistic beer."
""
""
"Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised with how this has aged. It's a fantastic beer that has mellowed and developed quite nicely. I would still buy this (and age it) again. My rating stands"
"overall - a well crafted beer, just a bit pricey."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one. I ate a piece of Babybel Bonbel cheese between sips, which was a nice pairing. I also think this would be a great beer to enjoy while smoking a nice cigar. I think the malt backbone could be beefed up a little more and the feel could be a little chewier. Additionally, there was a bit of alcohol heat present, but it didn't detract too much. Looking forward to drinking the 18."
"I find this beer a little odd. I normally quite like Dark Barrel Aged beers and I'm a big fan of peated malts but something about this fails to come together for me with that barrel character really dominating the beer for me."
"O - This is a high quality brew and is thoroughly recommended. The balance of this beer is of a very high standard."
"The beer after poured looks a bit like soda, the head falls fast. I've seen gloopier looking beers. Drinks more like a stout than an old ale with nice whisky after notes. Not as intimidating as it can potentially be."
"Harviestoun's Ola Dubh 12 year reserve that I had was bottled August 2010. The bartender at Casellula Cheese & Wine Bar poured this beer into a pilsner glass with an excellant dark tan two finger head. In the glass it is a very dark mahogany color that allowed only a smidgen of light to pass through. On the nose this beer has aromas of roasted malts, smokiness, and cellared oak. In the mouth it is very syrupy and creamy with smooth flavors of smoked malt with a hint of bitterness. An awesome beer!"
"overall it was kind of interesting but perhaps not my style as i didn't find it to be overly enjoyable. glad i decided against buying some of the higher special reserves."
"Deep and contemplative, smooth and drinkable. This could go a lot faster than it probably should. Smoky character comes through as the beer warms, a reward for slowing down. Well-rounded; I'm betting three years in the bottle has done good things for this beer. I'm certainly looking forward to the 16 and 30 year versions on deck."
"O-Good stuff."
"Bottle number 01990 and it pours dark as night hue with nice carbonation that leaves a two finger creamy head that stays and leaves sporadic clingy lacing here and there,the smell is chocolate,raisins and oak,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with tastes of tobacco,dark chocolate,cappicino,oak,roasty malts and finished with a milky chocolate bittersweetness and overall a nice drop with oak being subtle in the background and allowing the other tastes to shine through cheers."
"D- Very nice, nice malt quality of a Scottish ale combining with the peatiness of Scotlands national drink (not Irn-Bru). Neither qualities overpowering. A lovely sipper."
"D: Overall it's a sipping beer and it is a damned good sipping beer, definitely worth a try."
"Very balanced strong beer which we liked very much"
"O - I really enjoy this beer. Well, every aspect except the massive overpowering smoke/peat flavours. I'd like to try the other years and see how they stack up. Not impressed with this ""scotch""."
"I'd probably pair this with some super dark-chocolate desserts. Maybe some dark chocolate with ancho chilli or other spices would be good... but to be honest, it really deserves to be enjoyed on its own."
"Pours a luscious opaque sable with a respectable pale tan head that leaves a little lacing. Strong aroma has an overtone of honey and hints of caramel, wood and malt. Flavor has caramel, malty and woody tones with nutty, woody and honey hints and a touch of yeast. Texture is thick and smooth and just a little tingly, but still pleasing and beer-like."
"O-Excellent beer. So complex and flavorful while not overwhelming the pallet. Each flavor leads into the next and is very enjoyable to drink. My only complaint is the price, but it's worth it."
"O: This is a great beer, very tasty. Full thick sipping beer. Glad I picked this one up."
"Overall, tasty. Somewhat different from other old ales I've had, but still quite good."
"Mouthfeel is robust with a velvety smooth texture but feels just a tad bit too hot at this relatively young age (this bottle is about 6mos old). Overall, I'm thoroughly enjoying this beer and look forward to trying the 16 and 18 yera versions."
"O: This one caused me to shake my head in disappointment-- not at the beer, of course, but at the lack of recognition for the quality beers that are being released or have already been around from places outside of North America. A beer like this is such a pleasure to drink and gives such a multi-faceted, dynamic, delicious beer drinking experience that stands up easily to the likes of things like BCBS but on north american forums you'll almost never hear a peep about it. If you have access to this and you're wondering what a top-notch beer tastes like, grab it. This one almost certainly won't disappoint. That being said, for those who have had some of the generic greats of north american barrel aged stouts, this beer will take you to a less familiar place by playing with things like whisky in successful fashion."
"O: This is an excellent, and complex ale. Its smokey character is reminiscent of a rauchbier, but this is balanced against the sweet maltiness characteristic of scotch ales."
"Full-bodied, rich. Low effervescence and decadent. An absolutely wonderful brew. Can I have another please?"
"Pours a dark black with a decent amount of carbonation into a brandy snifter. Smells nice and roasty as well. Tastes of chocolate notes with a nice roasty, smokey finish. This is definately a porter, and not an old ale. Mouthfeel is beautiful. One of the easiest drinking 8% beers I have ever had. Wish I had easier access to this beer. 16 year is up next."
"Amazingly complex beer. I guess you can't really go wrong when you age a huge malt bomb on a oak barrel taken from one of the best Scotch Single Malt Distilleries in the world."
"Overall, very easy to drink. I was expecting more body for a cask aged beer, but I enjoyed it more this way. Not as bold as other cask aged beers, also not as obnoxious."
"Pours jet black with a light brown head.In the aroma, roasty malts and just a hint of whiskey. In the taste, roasted malts, earth and chocolate notes and a faint whiskey taste lingering underneath it all. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry chocolate and mellow whiskey aftertaste. Not as whiskey barreled as thought, nice chocolate presence and mellow for a bigger beer."
"Overall an exceptional beer. Very heavy, tasty, and complex. A great dessert or after dinner beer to savour by a fire from the comfort of an overstuffed leather wingback chair...Now that's living."
"This has to be the easiest drinking of any barrel aged beer I have tried to date. It was sort of refreshing to have a beer of this type that was so laid back. That being said, I found that the mouthfeel really did a huge injustice to the flavor and aroma of this beer. If improved upon, this tasty and unique beer would have much more of a complete package."
"I'm really a fan of this one, different, unique, delicious."
"Mouth feel is deceivingly large at first but ends somewhat thin for a beer of this size and flavor. A very nice beverage overall."
"The fact that I'm drastically less impressed with barrel-aged beers in general - but have enjoyed Ola Dubh Special Reserve 12 much more - now than when I first tried it some years ago must say something about the blend, taste and craftsmanship of this product. It is a tremendously rich, distinct and innate mix of Scottish terroir, heritage and gastronomy."
"D - A nice sipping brew to share two ways and enjoy over a lengthier period of time than a normal brew."
"Drinkability is not too high on this one, but of course this is by design. I couldn't see drinking more than one of these in an evening, despite being quite enjoyable."
"Gorgeously round and easy nightcap of a beer. Could see this with cheese. A civilized sipper."
"Dr: I could drink another, but the ABV is poorly hidden. Not as complex as it could be, maybe even without the whiskey aging."
"Rich beer."
"Good overall, but I'd have to say I'd probably take an The Old Engine Oil over it for the sake of value and overall beer presence."
"CHEERS."
"(D)- An interesting old ale that I quite like. Rich and malty. The scotch barrels really adds a dynamic level of aroma and flavor to the beer. I look forward to trying the other years of this."
"D: Despite its strength, this beer is very easy to drink."
"D: Goes down easily, rather tasty, somewhat filling, decent kick and good representation of style. The whisky character cannot be denied in this. However aged a bit, the heat is almost non-existent and the full flavoring comes through. This is a solid beer that stands up with aging."
"A tasty, and balanced, Scotch barrel-influenced strong old Scottish ale (whew!). Malt, hops, wood, and alcohol, all in a symbiotic orgy of restrained fury, the kind that might engender a bursting forth of some sort. What am I talking about? I dunno, this is the fourth bottle of the evening of this stuff and its kin, so I'm done writin', and ready for something else, no offense, bard-dear."
"Pours a deep black, oily and shiny with only the thinnest cap of brown head, decent lacing on the first few sips. Scent is mild yet complex... in no particular order i detected whiskey, oak, chocolate, vanilla, smoke, charcoal, mud, molasses, beef bullion. Taste brings all of the qualities of above in a completly well blended, smooth concoction. Fuller side of medium bodied, smooth and oily, slightly heavy on the tongue but spreads itself quickly, very little lingering notes. A very nice beer that could have been overpowering in many ways, but comes out fantasticaly balanced and smooth."
"Price = $5.99 at Public Beer"
"D- Extremely full and quite delicious. Looking forward to trying the others. Has great follow through with the flavors. Of the Ola series, this one has the most hop flavor and roasted malts. Much like a full, smooth RIS."
"This is a good beer, very well done but I would not see it as one I would drink often. At $10 per 12oz, it was great to try but not great enough to buy again."
"A pleasant barrel-aged beer, and makes a nice easy sipper in it's own right. I would have been far more impressed with it had I tried it before sampling the Special Reserve 18 first, which is the most superior of the lot."
"A good after-dinner beer, a dessert in itself."
"A delight to drink. Not as complex or pungent as I thought it might be, but delicious never-the-less."
"As for drinkability, it goes down with a distinct carbonated feel, almost a pucker, and a lingering alcohol burn, so you're going to want to sip it slow. I don't want to say it's harsh, but it's not really the smoothest beer."
"D: Not a bad beer but I don't believe it was worth the 10 dollars we paid for 12oz/"
"Overall: Good, but a little simple. I expected a little more I guess."
"Notes: Paired with the recommended Comté. Initially, I don't really see the appeal, but, after consideration, it does seem to bring out an enjoyable spiciness. ""Leading cheese expert"" Paul Thomas claims that the Gruyère should ""accentuate the whisky notes on the finish," and -- I'll be darned -- it does!"
"Great drink, can't wait to try the 16 and 40."
"Taste of chocolate, oats, very stout-like with a nice, velvety texture and smoothness. Alcohol very well in control. Great balance with a bitter-sweet harmony and roasted malt backdrop that is well integrated. Quite nice, I'm looking forward to the rest of Ola Dubh lineup!"
"A very thin body with low carbonation that is entirely against the hopes of strength this beer aroused. Is it a horrible beer? Perhaps not. Is it a beer worth buying and drinking? NO. For the price I paid, I could almost get a four pack of Breakfast Stout for instance, and that would be money well spent. I would rather drink Four Loko than this cloying, yet thin, late term abortion!"
"The wee man of the range but still pretty top notch."
"Very fine looking bottle, class label and appearance. Pours what can only be jet black with a foamy tan coloured head; thick from the aggressive pour. Fluffy head dissipates slowly and leaves plenty of lacing. The nose is of potent alcohol, the whiskey casks having left its mark. Also hints of roasted malts, toasty chocolate notes. On the sip, the taste isn't overly phenol as expected and this proves to be a well balanced beer. Theres a smooth velvety taste of the roasted chocolate and a semi-bitter aftertaste. Heavy bodied mouthfeel as expected for something named 'Black Oil'. Overall a pretty easy drinker, a great drinkable introduction to the series."
"Body is damn well near as black as can be, with a finger and change of creamy khaki head. Lacing is sticky as shit, but not a ton of head hangs around. Nose is of dark chocolate, hint of smoke. Tastes more of chocolate with some bitterness, molasses and licorice; the slightest bit of heat finishes it off. Some dark fruits here also, more subtle. Warming feeling to it, but the whiskey barrel aging isn't completely evident to me; the slightest hint of peat and whiskey comes through even around room temperature. A touch metallic in the mouthfeel, but generally slick and smooth. Again, warming feeling and the ABV ain't detectable. Great drinker and there colder months are a great time to be having it."
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours a very dark brown color with a thin head. A bit persistent with some carbonation bubbles throughout. Nose is light whisky plus some oak, vanilla, dark fruits, and smoke. A bit of roast. The taste has some whisky and peat smoke plus a bit of roast and oak. Good body and not too boozy. Drinkability is higher on this than the 30 and 40."
"It is pretty good, I wonder if the other editions would be better or worse, or any different."
"Pours a thick viscous dark-brown black with a 2 finger mocha head that laces very well. The aroma is rich with toffee, dark chocolate malt, a touch of whiskey-like smoke and spice, and maybe just a bit chalky. The taste is complex and well-balanced. Dark caramel and chocolate malt up front, leading into a light smokiness and peaty whiskey character, and finishing up with a pronounced bitterness and mild scotch-like lingering finish. Rich and full-bodied, moderately carbonated. This is a wonderfully tasty and complex beer. The ABV is well-hidden and it shows nice scotch characteristics as it warms without being too sweet/cloying. I'm interested in trying some of the others in the series, $ permitting."
"this was good, the smell was amazing. very well blended and smooth. i plan on trying the 16 and 30 year old barrel versions."
"Notes: Nice brew, and while it hits all the right Whisky notes with dexterity, and I sure would love to have it again, there is something that does not quite take to the next level for me. Maybe its the Orkney style that does not make it for me compared to other Scotchs. It is like it is lacking a touch to make it truly memorable. Dunno, maybe I need to try other Ola Dubh reserve offerings..."
"but scotch is even more apparent in the finish, which is dry for an old ale (i suppose that could be an illusion). good sweetness to support some sharp flavors--oak is highly present (especially in the 12-year, as opposed to 30-year). i think bitterness shows up more in 12-year than 30. quite roasty-flavored: mos def more of a porter than old ale"
"11.2oz. bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Bottle# 28316/Bottled in September 2007. Pours one shade shy of black with no head - just a mocha-colored skim that quickly disperses towards the edges forming a bubbly band around the perimeter of the bowl. No lacing on this one. Exceptional nose with wonderful complexity - brown sugar, molasses, dark fruit and toffee on a malty base. A light whiskey presence is also expressed towards the back. Taste somewhat consistent with nose - molasses and brown sugar are apparent, but a light coffee character also comes out, as well as a hint of char; toffee seems to disappear. Mouthfeel is medium-light, perhaps a little watery, with an almost non-existent carbonation. A really solid Old Ale. The highlight on this one is definitely in the nose. Unfortunately, it falls a little short in terms of the mouthfeel. Well worth a try and I am intrigued as to what 5-7 years might do to this one."
"D - A remarkable beer."
"taste is really sweet, smokey and very rich. It's got a lot of whisky flavor to it which is nice. It's really creamy and drinkable."
"Massive props to the BAs who recommended this to me after asking for rec's on scotch barrel aged beers, I really enjoyed this one. Ola Dubh 12 poured a thick, muddled black, reddish brown around the edges and only a little lacing, no head. Smokey, peaty aromas, a hint of chocolate, dried fruit. The mouth feel was excellent, rolled over tongue to bring out more of the subtle flavors. Oak and cedar finish, roasted coffee and malts, sweet prunes in the taste. Pricey, but well finished and great for an occasion meriting a 9$ bottle. I look forward to trying other beers from Harviestoun's lineup."
"I really enjoy this beer, it's fairly complex but highly drinkable. I have drank this one quite a bit in the last few months. I can get this locally so I plan to stock up before it disappears."
"Initially a nice creamy mocha head sits atop a viscous black oil-like beer. It settled slowly, but I was disappointed by the complete lack of lacing. Aromas of licorice, molasses and caramel come off the nose accompanied by strong alcoholic esters. The mouthfeel is thick, but the beer has balance, being sweet though not cloying whatsoever. Licorice is the primary flavour I get along with some burnt sugar / caramel & toffee notes. Light whiskey notes play in the background when allowed to come out, much less so than I had expected though. Quite drinkable. Pulled this one out for a cool rainy night and it matched perfectly."
"The flavor is smoooth and really complex. Plum and a strong presence of berries are there and the smokiness of the scotch really comes through at the end of the flavor profile. Caramel, molasses and berry syrup are present as well. Raisins and dates too. The body on this is much thinner than expected but still manages to retain a lot of mellow flavors. The oak and smoke from the barrel begin to emerge as I continue drinking. Overall a great very drinkable beer with tons of complexity and subtly without any challenging or difficult aspects."
"Definately a complex and tasty beer but the oak and smokiness hold it back. I like it for its complexity but less for its flavour. Given all those factors, it's still a top notch beer."
"Scotch whisky is lower in the taste of this 12 versus the 16. This one shows more of the beery malts. Strangely though, it feels a little ""hollow"" though overall it is good. But in my opinion this pales in comparison to the Special Reserve 16. Maybe it's just that is was an older bottle and age didn't do it any favors?"
"D - Good beer but very complex and flavorful. Definitely for sipping."
"I can't wait to try the other beers from this line up because if this is the starting point I'm in for a good time. I only have the 18 to try after this one but I'll be on the look out for the others."
"This is a lovely brew. Considering the cost, I'd probably grab a bottle of Sam Adams Triple Bock, which is a few bucks cheaper, when I'm in the mood for something like this. Still, it's definitely recommended if the price doesn't bother you."
"Wonderfully smoky aroma and flavor. Most of the characteristics are very similar to their flagship with some added nuances. Many barrel aged beers come out a little boozy, but this one does not. The 8% abv is not noticeable, unless you can't help yourself and polish off the bottle in ten minutes, then you might notice something."
"I do have three more bottles relaxing in my cellar, so look for a one year tasting in July 2010, I am already starting to get excited for that one!"
"I have since found another bottle that I will be enjoying at a later date."
"I really loved the 16 from this series and I'm hoping I just have an off bottle here but this one surely didn't match up to its older brother...disappointing.."
"Not nearly as complex as I had hoped, but very well put-together. A wonderful base beer that adequately showcases the effects of the barrel aging without either one taking over the other, but rather fitting together harmoniously. Very nice."
"My first beer from Harviestoun: excellent. The labeling sells this beer as a sort of whiskeyish beer, and it is. The matchmaking is superb. A bit acidic, the beer drops just the right notes of cask stored and stoutish. The brewers have somehow mastered a strange but delightful balance of intensity of flavor with mellow of attitude. One can slow slip this beer in any environment and not be afraid to pour some more, all the while knowing that the cider drinking priss to your right won't be bothering you for another sip. Let your dollars fly, this beer is worth it."
"Pours jet black with a small head . The nose is subtle considering the barrel aging. I loved the whiskey notes all over the big roasty chocolatey stout flavours. I found the beer at times smokey , meaty and very smooth on the finish. In fact the length of the finish really impressed me as the beer warmed up. Impressive beer"
"Notes: This beer is less than balanced - it's all Scotch whisky flavors on top of Imperial Stout notes. It feels like a bigger beer than 8%, but not in a boozy way - just in mouthfeel. However, I highly recommend this for folks that like brash bold brews!"
"D: I'm lovin' it."
"Large, soapy bubbles formed a thin cap on top of the near-black beer. Good head retention with a bit of spotty/sticky lace. Aromas of caramel and toffee, mild boozy alcohol, dark malts, a bit of roast and burnt, raisin skins and faint vanilla. The flavour was fruity sweet with raisins and prunes, caramel and roast, semisweet chocolate, light alcohol. Not much whisky flavour. Mild to moderate bitterness appeared in the finish. Full bodied with fine carbonation, some dryness from the dark kilned malts, nice texture. Pretty good, but I was a little surprised at the level of fruity character."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable beer that just didn't look that good (though in retrospect, I perhaps should have been a tad more forgiving given the abv% and barrel-aging aspect). Nothing jumps out too much here, and it's surprisingly well-balanced in all respects - not too sweet and not astringently dry, not too alcoholic, not too heavy in terms of whiskey seepage, and not too estery or fruity. Just a pretty good all-around drinkable beer that gets knocked a little, 'cause, well, it's still 8.0%, even if it's not detectable."
"D: Overall it's a nice beer. Not worth the price, but interesting to try. I doubt many would choose to enjoy more than on in an evening."
"so light and airy on the palette. This is a much lighter bodied beer than i would have thought. Very nice though, made it easy to drink and easier to drink another beer afterwards."
"D: Interesting beer, I like it a lot, but I don't think it is worth the price. I was expecting something thicker and fuller bodied, but this was alright."
"Not quite as integrated and smooth as the 30 or the 40 I had, rougher, brasher, less creamy. Still tasty, just not top tier."
"Overall, I found this to be a very nice beer. Its incredible taste, smell, and smoothness more than compensate for its other minor flaws. I had never had a scotch barrel aged ale before, and the experience was quite pleasing. It's definitely something I will be keeping a look out for in the future. Highly recommended."
"Overall, I've had many bourbon beers, but never a scotch beer. It's a great combination that I would love to see more breweries try."
"This is a pretty interesting drink. I didn't notice the smoky flavor until I was halfway done with it. Definitely a sipper to be enjoyed while pondering the subtle differences between rubber shoe soles."
"Opinion: This is a really nice beer. It has a very complex malt bill, and I am guessing that there are some process tricks that lead to a flavor like this...ie, kettle caramelization and such to get this type of caramel that seems so typical for Scottish beers. All in all, this beer is very nice and I wouldn't hesitate to try other beers from this brewery."
"M/D: Smooth, medium in texture. I guess this was from the most recent release because it was still a bit warm. Regardless of any of that, the bottom line is that if you like scotch, you will like this beer. If you can't handle it, don't even bother trying this one."
"D: I liked this. It's been a long time since I had the 30, so I can't really compare, but this is solid barrel aged beer, a digestif for sure."
"A fantastic old ale that I'm more than happy I was able to pick up before they were all hoarded. For me, using whisky in beer is like playing with fire; it's only good to a certain point. And Harviestoun uses the whisky perfectly to compliment the rest of the beer. I'll buy this one again and again, the only difference is next time I'll be sure to by more. Thumbs up."
"drinkability: was a treat to try but I paid 15 for a 12oz. disppointed in that."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, bitey, slick in the finish, and warming."
"In a pint glass this beer was jet black in color with virtually no head. A smoky, roasted malt aroma, with whiskey, and a faint sweet aroma. Complex taste. Dark fruit, coffee, whiskey, and a little bit of hops late. Vary tasty. This was a smooth, balanced beer, which I will have again."
"Pours an opaque black with a thin tan head that sticks around. Lacing down the glass. I can smell some smokiness, peat and I think I get a faint aroma similar to a red wine. I can taste the scotch in this to go along with the roasted malt. I had bought a bottle of the Highland Park 12 to compare and I get the taste of this in here. It has a nice chocolaty after taste, with definite hints of scotch. It goes down very smooth, not overly carbonated, which is nice."
"All said and done, special 12 reserve would be a worthy addition to any whiskey or beer collection. I could (and intend to) sip this for the next hour. Scotland, what would I do without you?"
"pours a solid black into my snifter, no head whatsoever. chocolate, vanilla, oak, and some whiskey in the nose. taste is just as complex. Really impressive amount of different flavors here. Everything in the nose comes through in the taste as well as some dark fruit and coffee. Im really amazed at how complex and balanced this is. Tons of flavor with not one dominating the palate. A little warm as it goes down but very drinkable. Very smooth in the mouth. If you've been on the fence about trying this like I had been, don't wait any longer."
"Very smooth and velvety, and despite the ABV, very nice as a dessert beer."
"D: This was a pleasure to sip on. It's great a great tasting, unique beer to sip on. Make sure you try it."
"This is very drinkable. Very calming."
"Slainte!"
"mouthfeel is outstanding at first but turns almost a bit oily after a while..."
"Sidenote, the label lists a MASTER OF WOOD, how can this beer not be awesome?!"
"The flavour and aroma both took a bit of time to open up after pouring it a little too cold; this beer puts it best foot forward while almost room-temperature cool. The cask aging still shows itself more in the scent than in the taste. It's medium-full body and almost non-existent carbonation feels luxuriously smooth and creamy in your mouth. This is an easy drinking beer of great depth and complexity. Part of the LCBOs winter beer release, pick it up and love it while you can."
"Almost black body rimmed with ruby highlights - topped by a thin tan head. Aroma is amazing - tobacco, oak, cherry, vanilla, and a hint of smoke. Flavor is also very nice. Molasses, a decent amount of smokiness, very sweet brown sugar, coffee, dark chocolate, prunes, and a slight meatiness that reminds me of fine prosciutto. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, and enhances the lingering smoky, smores finish. Drinkability is also very good. Can't believe this is 8% ABV - wish I had a case of these."
"Drinkability: The ABV is a bit high at 8%, but i really don't care as I could sip on this (hell, I could even just sit here and smell it) for hours on end. Amazing flavors with an even better nose - just a great all-around cold night kind of ale."
"D: A nice oak-barrel matured beer. Significantly less vanilla than other beers that has been matured on oak-barrels - this is a very good thing. I couldn't taste the wheat and oat. But this is probably caused by the heavy roast."
"An excellent beer the barrel aging provides some great depth and complimentary flavours and aromas. Can't wait to try some of the others."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with good carbonation. Drinkability is alright, one is perfect for me since it's a little sticky and thick."
"This is seriously good shit. Although, for the price tag, I'd probably be just as happy with Old Engine Oil. The barrel aging changes things up a little, but it's too subtle for double the price."
"Smoke flavors begin to emerge as the beer passes cellar temp into room temp. So complex. A bit thin on the tongue but otherwise, very drinkable. Perhaps this serving being a cask serving made the mouth feel thinner without the carbonation usually associated with bottle or typical dtraft. Abv is fairly well hidden but the large whiskey tones give the alcohol taste without the alcohol feel. A very nice beer indeed. More sweet with no apparent bitterness."
"The taste is very unique, but I must admit right away that it doesn't appeal to me at all. There is a chocolaty element that I enjoy, but beyond that almost tastes like motor oil smells. Tough to explain...not necessarily off-putting but definitely pointless and unappealing. The mouthfeel was nice and full and fairly flat, but this just wasn't drinkable for me."
"D: GREAT, rvdoorn should make his return to Scotland asap!!! Irene, if you are reading this, please bring us some bottles!!!"
"Overall: Not as creamy as I hoped it would be, but man, what a nice beer. Would love to drink this one over and over again."
"Ola Dubh 40 - huge scotch character, complimented by chocolate and caramel, smooth and warming (4.65)"
"D - No problem at all to drink this 11.2oz bottle. Very easy-drinking. It was difficult to slow down, it made me drink it too fast."
"D: We wound up being pretty unimpressed with this one. The 16, which followed after, was better."
"Drinkability: For an old ale, I can't imagine it getting any better. I left some head room in the previous categories just because I know I'll be trying the 16 and 30 shortly. This was fantastic! Incredibly smooth for an old ale."
"D- Man I wish I could afford to drink this on a regular basis. It is smooth and easy to drink and the flavors although this is a 2007 bottle are complex. The only thing this bottle left me wondering was if a fresh bottle would have more whiskey character. Either way its very good."
"Whatever Harviestoun Ola Dubh Special 12 Reserve cost, it was worth it. Unfortunately, a measly 330 ml is nothing but a tantalizing treat. Then again, I still have Special 18 Reserve and Special 30 Reserve to look forward to. Mmm mmm good!"
"I'm thoroughly impressed with this beer. Maybe it's the additional aging, but I'm digging this more than either the 30 or 40 that I had on cask at Max's."
"Drinkability: I'm a big a fan of Old Engine Oil, and the barrel aging has lost none of chocolately coffee flavours, and has added an incredibly smokey whiskey taste at the finish. Can't wait to try the older aged beers."
"I love the base beer for this, but the barrel aging really hasn't done it any favors. While the drinkability of this beer is impressive the rest is a mess. The hops really don't meld well with the whisky, and the thin body doesn't help matters. I'd still drink it again, but wouldn't pay for it."
"D: For 8% you don't taste it at all and it goes down very smooth. The whiskey kicks in on the finish and brings a little intensity that makes you slow down and enjoy it, but not too much that it is a chore to get through. This beer is fantastic and I will be revisiting and laying future Ola Dubh's down to age for awhile longer. Highly recommend!"
"My last bottle from the Feb 2010 bottling.  The beer has held up very well to being aged at cellar temps, but I think I'm picking up just a few hits of oxidation that suggest longer aging is not a good idea."
"It's the kind of beer a lager lover would HATE. Therefore, I love it!"
"Black abyss with cinnamon head on top. Sweet, roasty aroma of chocolate, alcohol, and smoke. Chocolate, roast, smoked ham, smoked onions, and sticky sugars. Medium-heavy body with distinct characteristics that suggest English origins but the beer screams for difference. A beautiful dark concoction."
"Pours near black with a silky brown head and some light lacing. Nose has a peaty scotch presence up front followed by roasty malts, oak, cocoa and fruity alcohol. Taste also has a smokey scotch presence along with dark malts, ripe fruits, chocolate, molasses and wood. Medium to full body is nicely carbonated. Wasn't sure I liked the whiskey presence at first, but this one really grew on me as it warmed."
"Needs a bit more aging. Regardless, drinkable if you can get past the whiskey taste. Complex and still drinkable enough in this stage."
"D: A dark and complex beer, definitely one to enjoy in sips and appreciate"
"The 8.0%abv is nowhere to be found, other than the slight warmth. The taste of this is great and I'd love to have a huge stockpile of them, so I could drink it often."
"2007 vintage. This poured a nearly opaque dark mahogany with a bit of tan head. It smelled like a blend of malts including chocolate and caramel and honey wheat and roasted coffee, with a bit of alcohol. It tasted like a blend of roasted barley and burnt coffee and molasses, with a strong oak and peat finish. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a lasting oaky aftertaste. Overall this was very tasty and complex and rich. It had a subtle flavor and smooth body. It had a bit of alcohol noticeable, but it was still fairly easy to drink. This was a wonderful sipping beer, and is best if you enjoy oak and peat flavors. I've never tried this fresh, but it's holding up quite well after a couple years, and could withstand a fair amount of more cellar time."
"Having an opportunity to taste this beer side by side with the 18, 30 and 40 Ola dubh's, one thing that struck me is how much the flavor profile with these beers changes and improves as it sits in the glass and warms. Granted, this beer pales in comparison to the 30 and 40, but nevertheless, even at this level, this is a superb beer."
"The beer is medium full bodied with a low level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for my taste."
"Split a 12 oz bottle of this last night with my dad. Pours a flat black colorwith little head. The beer coats the glass. Smell is very complex- sugar, dark fruits, alcohol etc. Taste doesn't live up to the smell. Seems like it was aged a little too long. The beer notes became subdued to the whiskey notes. Flat mouthfeel, but it's cask-aged, so that's not unexpected. Can't drink more than one of these. It's a sipper. Overall, a decent beer - not sure it's worth the price tag though."
"Got this at Sam's in Chicago last week. Poured with a tan head and some lace. Has very pleasing color highlights. Looking straight through it's about opaque. Nice roasty, whiskey, malt, chocolate, ripe dark fruit nose. Flavor's the same but much more full. Really pick up the whisky and a bit of oak. Little sweet on tongue sides and tip. Great body and carbonation. Boozy. Nice long rich finish. No way a session, but fabulous nonetheless. Great for after dinner or on a dreary day."
"The brew is drinkable for a session but has a presence of alcohol in the taste. It is good but has a medicinal flavor almost. Decent brew - nothing great. One or two to sip not to drink a bunch all night."
"D: High alcohol prevents sitting down with a case and really getting into this, but if you have the time and are inlined to do so, this is something I could get into very easily on a long weekend. Good stuff overall, a very nice change from the average beer, which this is not...makes me glad that there are brews such as this out there..."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. There is no head. The aroma is molasses, brown sugar, peat, sea air. The taste is slightly sweet with the malt being taken over by the scotch. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with dead carbonation, and a slippery feel. This is one of the most off putting mouthfeel I have experienced. Overall, this beer is alright, but the mouthfeel is going to keep me away from it."
"D- A huge sipper. This drinks a lot heavier than most 8% beers, but it is rather enjoyable. Very tasty."
"you can't drink this all night however..."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black color, with zero head and zero lacing. Looks flat and fairly unappealing. Sharp alcoholic aroma, a touch of chocolate and dark fruits, dry yeast, and the typical British Old Ale maltiness. Nice dark chocolate flavor, molasses, caramel, dark fruits, a hint of wood and smokiness, maybe just the lightest touch of whisky, and a bit of oxidation. This beer is completely flat. I know some people like their old ales to be this way, but it's just not doing it for me. Carbonation is needed for every beer, regardless of the style IMO. Not bad tasting, but need some bubbles."
"D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is not hidden too well but that is pretty much what I expected from this one. It's warm but still quite pleasant. Flavor is fairly complex and it has a very smooth fool. I could easily see myself sipping on a bottle of this for the duration of an evening. Harviestoun did a good job with this beer."
"An interesting beer, somewhat complex. Recommended."
"Scotch aged imperial stout. What a unique beer. The scotch flavor is just slightly, just barely, and bit more than the malt backbone. It gives it a nice contrast however. Seriously though, it tastes like a black and made of scotch whiskey and an imperial stout. Crazy cool beer."
"A solid Old Ale done in a very subtle fashion with its oak aged attributes and smoothed over softness. Looking forward to trying the older versions of this one!"
"Drinkability: Harviestoun has taken OEO to another level with this beer; wonderful complexity"
"Overall - A very good example of a barrel aging... could maybe do with a few more months just to mellow things a little but definitely recommended..."
"D: Hard to imagine having more than one of these at a time. While I have had the opportunity to sample more brews of these types, this is far from my favorite. That said, I would still love to try one of these fresh. I expect my opinion to be very different."
"Pours dark black with virtually zero head. Bits of spotty lacing during consumption. A lot is going on in the aroma and taste. I smell vanilla, roasted malt, whisky, and a touch of alcohol. The flavor is very complex. Roasted malt is complemented by vanilla, earthy with peat and smoke, a touch of whisky, and a whisp of alcohol. The body is a little thin. Carbonation is low but just enough to lift the body. This is a very complex ale. Not overwhelming with whisky and alcohol which I like. Very smooth. The expensive price will limit the amount I purchase and enjoy."
"Pours a very dark brown with only a slight head. You can still find the underlying Old Engine Oil that is not lost due to the barrel aging. Some of the integrity and characters that I like about the Old Engine Oil are lost. It is a thinner, less creamy version. There is a nice peat flavor that you would find in a nice scotch that saves this beer. Decent."
"Notes - Really fantastic. I can't wait to try the other versions of Ola Dubh."
"Pours jet black with close to zero head, so no lacing either, thin band of brunt orange around the outer rims. Very aggressive nose of burnt driftwood, metal flakes, rust, sea salts, at times close to dried beef, if you can adjust and fight back you'll find chocolate and fried vanilla ice cream, plums and raisins. Medium-bodied, as in the nose the flavors have such life that you may at first think it's heavier. However, it moves easily and without excessive grip on the tongue. Not smoky, smoked as in wood smoked, fireplace embers and slow cooked until every pore says ""smoke."" Almost too bitter at times, the alcohol does come through, can you cut beer with spring water? The vanilla and coconut pair with coffee roast, caramel, sweet and edgy at once. The peat, moss, lichen earthiness there, particularly at the end. Whole cloves and notes of smoked ham. Given the absence of a head the carbonation percolates steadily. The retronasal fumes keep coming and coming. More complexity when warmer, more perceptible alcohol too, you choose which you prefer."
"My expectations were met with a smooth complex brew."
"I really did enjoy this as a slow sipper after dinner beer."
"i love barrel aged beers and this is no exception...given the smoothness of this beer it could be dangerous"
"This is a great beer that gets even better on cask. Super smooth, well balanced and very tasty."
"Overall this is a fine-tasting beverage. I tried the 30 year a while back, and while this is lighter it's no less of a beer. Definitely worth a shot."
"Like I said, after a bit, it was easy to put back, very smooth, probably one of the smoothest beer that I have tried to date. It had a medium body to it, which surprised me, but it was rich with little carbonation. Overall, excellent beer and I can't wait to try the older brews."
"D: Very good"
"I put the drinkability high because it was extremely easy to drink and enjoy, I don't think anyone would be sitting and drinking six of these in a night and it definitely is not drinkable in that sense but to relax and enjoy one this beer goes down way too easy."
"MF&D - i can find no problems whatsoever with either of these categories. it is just the right amount of thickness for the presence of alcohol in the beer, and the lack of carbonation complements this very well."
"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Bottle No. 04062. ABV is 8.0%. Pitch black colour, big to moderate and creamy tan head. The whisky oak cask with peaty smoke and notes of vanilla and sherry comes through immediately in the aroma, followed by notes of roastiness (roast malts, coffee) and chocolate. The flavour has loads of rich malty sweetness, immediately followed by distinct notes of peaty smoke - it is quite amazing what impact the whisky cask has. Dark chocolate in the middle. The finish has a firm bitterness from the hops and burnt malts, while the peaty smoke lasts through the long aftertaste. A truly impressive beer, but if you don't like scotch whisky at all, this might not be the beer for you. Not easy drinking, but a great sipping beer, and a real treat for any lover of peatiness."
"Other stats: Color, an inky black; Aroma, meh - as I earlier said. Nothing jumped out. How does this brew hide its flavor?"
"D - great beer, if you enjoy whiskey! cheers!"
"Pours engine oil black with a lasting small head and great lacing... Smell is malty, smoky. Taste is sweet malt, molasses, smoke, alcohol and hops. Smooth with a dry finish describes the mouthfeel. Drinkability is very good, with an excellent dry finish."
"Black/ruby pour with nearly no head arising, just the faint circulating of some miniscule bubbles throughout. Solid malt aroma, molasses. Nice suble hints of the whisky barrels blend really well with the big maltiness. Some raisin, vanilla, maple syrup likeness also. Very smooth and drinkable. I worry that the brews with the higher aged barrels will take on too much character from the barrel, I guess I'll have to see. This one, is excellent however. If it was cheaper I'd invest in a case of it."
"Bottle from the Pizza Port Bottle Shop. Pours black with a ring of tan bubbles. Peaty, roasty aroma with oak, chocolate, and smoke. Exceptionally smooth taste. Nice roasted malt and baker's chocolate flavors. The peat and smoke compliment the beer nicely without overrunning the taste. Hints of oak, vanilla, and caramel come out as it warms. Worth every penny."
"Deep black in color-pours looking like ink. Not a lot of carbonation. Nice aroma of oak and a mild scotch smell. Ever so slightly smoked. Very full and heavy flavor. Just enough whiskey and oak flavors for my liking. Very slight alcohol tinge. Hint of graininess. Nice mouthfeel. Really smooth-you could slam this but it really is a perfect sipper. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Not in your face like most of the barrel aged beers tend to be for me."
"Not gonna get to into this one, only thing you need to know is that this is one exceptional beverage, well worth the expense. Every facet of this ale is complex yet well designed and perfectly excecuted. A fine pour, to be shared with friends. Ola Dubh means Black Oil in Gaelic and this is definately black gold."
"A vigorous pour barely coaxes a head out of this solid black beer. Heavy aroma of vanilla some roasted malts, chocolate and some scotch. I love the aroma its very enticing. Taste is chocolate and roasted malts, faint scotch and ash. Lingering roasted malt bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth. Body is medium Carbonation is adequate. Great smelling and tasting brew. I would have liked the body a bit thicker, but great just the same. Subtle, not over whiskey'd."
"Highly recommended."
"3.5/3.5/4/3.5/3"
"d - This is a fantastic brew with a few things I havn't found in any other beer. Mostly the charred and wood flavors. The bitterness was a little high for my liking, but nothing too catastrophic. I have to take off a few points somewhere and this seems like the spot. There are other beers that give a solid experience for much much less money. This beer is very good yet I don't find myself coming back due to price. If it was the best beer I have ever had I might enjoy it on special occasions but it just didn't quite make the mark. Definitely worth the try, but If I come back it will be for the 16 or 30 :)"
"M&D - thinner than its friends, but far more bitter than expected, almost to an unenjoyable extent, definitely my least favorite of the three"
"D - Very enjoyable and easy to drink. If it wasn't so expensive I would get it more often"
"D: very smooth ans enjoyable. solid wood aged beer. well worth getting the first of this series. it was aged a year in the cellar as well."
"Drinkability is ok, a tasty beer, but for the price and rarity, it's pretty much one an done. Still, a good one."
"I love a good scotch and a good beer, so this one was a nice treat for me."
"Harviestoun Ola Dubh Special 12 Reserve pours a medium dense opaque black. There is an intial brown fizz of a head that quickly dissipates to a black glossy top. First smell is moderately strong with a malt whiskey like aroma. I find the smell very pleasant for a malty dense like brew and it boldens throughout the drink. Taste is mellow with a flavor range of coffee, bitter chocolate, and a slight harsh whisky note. Mouthfeel has little carbonation and is moderatly dense. A slight sticky residue resides with some lingering whisky character. Overall this was a good black brew. There was a lot of good flavor in there but it just didn't come out strong enough to make it great."
"This beer had zero drinkability, and half of a $9.49 beer went down my drain. There was no redeeming factors to this beer and I'd highly advise steering clear of it. It's not often I find a beer I can't finish, but here it is!"
"Poured absolutely black with no head. When held to a lamp, no light passes through, not even the edges. Smell is spectacular. Molasses, caramel, muted coffee, brown sugar, very faint smoke and whisky, as the label states it's aged in old whisky casks. Flavour echoes much of the same. Dark roasted robust malts, a very faint tobacco profile, a bit of smoke, some charred wood, and again, whisky, are all detectable. Mouthfeel is certainly full and solid, but honestly, I'd have liked to see it a little heavier. Given the style and the fact that you're going to sip this one, I'd say it's highly drinkable. This on a cold Winter night, a fire, your favourite blanket in the house, and a good book would be a winning combination, for sure! Hands down, the most complex, wonderfully crafted beer I have had in a very long time. Period."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a subtle creaminess and mellow carbonation. I thought this would be heavier, but I am happily surprised as the body makes it more drinkable. Overall, this is the first of the three I have tried, still having to sample the 16 and 30, however so far I am glad I purchased this one. The single malt really adds a new element to this enjoyable, sipping brew. Worth seeking out in my opinion."
"D: Drinkability was incredibly smooth, silky with a well balanced roasted flavor making for a great slow sipper filled with an earthy bitterness and campfire minearlity."
"Like everything else in this series, a world class beer. Tracking down all the Old Engine and Ola Dubh beers have been a treat. It is almost impossible for me to choose a favorite. This has the lowest score of the series for me, but that is relative to the rest of the amazing beers. It is like choosing between The White Album and Abby Road. All are masterpieces."
"Drinks fairly easy for the style & ABV"
"Not as black as other dark beers. Btthis dos havea heavy blck colo with brown and garnet highlighs. Only a flash in the pan head and a few spots of lacing with each sip. The aroma is a nutty coffee and smoked peet aroma. Maybe a little heavy cream too. The peet, wood, and mi of toasted an roasted malts spash the tastebuds first. The smoke and whskey grains start to some trough in the middle. With a very creamy coffee and oakey finish. The palate is smooth and warm. This beer was made for the snifter an constant swirling. The combo of whiskey, oak, and old ale are a very unique combination. The first of the three Ola Dubh beer. I wonder what the other two wll taste like in comparison."
"Taste is very roasted like espresso, along with some smokey peat, a bit of oak, bitter chocolate, licorice, finish is dry with a touch of cinnamon powder. Mouthfeel is a little thin, though as it warms it becomes more full. Pretty good beer though, Im not sure its worth the price tag."
"Pours just like its namesake, black oil, with a thin coffee-colored head that quickly fades. Smells like a syrupy sweet. Some peat and heather honey notes from the highland park casks are present. Some caramel, coffee, and oak tones too. Focused and sharp. You can taste the highland park, which is is fine harmony with the natural flavors of the stout. Cream oaky honeyed palate. Some nuttiness and very mild smoky notes. Body is oily and grips the mouth seductively. A protracted and clean finish. A splendid collaboration with the highland park distillery oin the part of harviestoun. Though I've had the HP 12 year old before and can locate some of those falvors in this beer I wish I had some know to match them up."
"Taste is with some acid tannic with some kind of cold coffee flavour, some saltiness with shy milky notes."
"Appearaance: on einch, frothy, light brown head. Black. Aroma: burnt, peat, charcoal, licorice, cola, and cask wood. Heavy bitter finish and very dry finish. Nothing like I've ever had before. Can really taste the charcoal from the cask. Couldn't drink more than one of these. Would go great with a Maduro wrapped cigar."
"Pours a great pitch black in color with a great tan (if bit small) head, and just a little bit of lacing. It has a wonderful scent, part coffee, part whiskey, part malt, part hop, a near perfectly balanced scent that ends with a sweet note. Wonderful taste, the whiskey flavor is there, but not overly dominant like so many other such beers; it has a great slight coffee start with a wonderful dark, malty, old ale flavor, a nice sweet finish with a bit of hoppiness to tone it down. It goes down wonderfully smooth for such a bold beer. Absolutely freaking fantastic."
"A very good flavor. Notes of molasses and dark chocolate are detected. Coats the tongue and mouth very nicely. The whisky flavor is not overpowering, it just adds a nice addition to the beer. There is a hint of the ""heat"" that you might find in whisky but this beer is only 8% ABV. Very good beer. Recommended."
"drinkability is pretty good. nicely balanced, just not that exciting overall. my least favourite of the three."
"much more character than the 30 but not as smooth or as subtle."
"Pours an opaque black with dark brown and red highlights, medium sized thick brown head forms, looks like tar, settles to a thin ring quickly, drops a ton of lace, this stuff is dark! Smell is nice, chocolate and toffee, whiskey, oak, dark fruits, some alcohol, figs, cherries, very roasty, quite nice. Taste is charred wood, bread, toffee, chocolate, whiskey, sherry, some licorice and vanilla, but the flavour is kind of light and not as rich as I expected. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation, not as thick as I would have liked. Solid stuff though, thanks Russ!"
"Drinkability: Highly highly drinkable, and if we're taking the high price tag away I give it a perfect rating. A 6-pack of this, however, would cost you... a lot. But it's quality stuff, as they say it is, and as it should be."
"Drinkable beer, I had to remind myself to sip and not chug."
"First of the series, retrieved at State Line Liquor, and most promising. Aroma is of an imperial stout with some whiskey. Black body. Creamy mouthfeel with whiskey,chocolate, ah a drinkable pleasure rather than bourbon. A bit woody. Most satisfying, and a bit malty sweet at the end."
"Drinkability is moderate. Moderate alcohol limits the beer only slightly. Good flavor makes it pretty easy to consume. A sipper for sure."
"Pours a one finger brown head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Totally black, no highlights. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Sweet whiskey nose. Flavor is sweet oak and whiskey with hints of sweet smokiness. Nice old ale. $8.95 for a 3300ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma bottled Sep 2007."
"I dropped $8 on this bottle of beer (in perspective, that's 1/4 the price of the whisky...and I also bought the 16 and the 30 Special Reserves, so that's 3 bottles of beer for right about the same price as a bottle of HP12, which would last me months) and solely because of the barrels it was aged in. To be honest, the scotch whisky aged notions are pushed to fringes, and I couldn't link this taste-wise in any way to HP, even sipping on it along side the beer (though they are quite agreeable, harmonious, and tasty partners, and I recommend having a dram along with it). I just would have liked to see more direct quotations from the spirit itself in this beer. I hoping for more of this in the 16 and the 30, though I'm worried, as I tend to enjoy moderately younger Scotches more than their older brether regardless of price. As decent as it is, I won't be seaching out more of the 12."
"D- This beer has nice dark malt notes with a balance of smoky and whiskey notes that stay in their supporting roles. The flavor is not over the top and there are some nice depth to it."
"the drinkability is very good for the viscosity and flavor profile. it's a mellow and well crafted scotch ale-esque old ale."
"Pours black with a lacy head that settles to a ring. The aroma starts with some roasty notes that are tinged with a faint peatiness followed by some firm, dry malt. The taste is a little more aggressive than the aroma as far as the scotch notes go. Lightly peaty, woody tasting oak, very light pepper and vanilla notes, and hints of cherry and caramel. Most of these notes are picked up from the barrel than from the beer itself. There is a lingering roastiness that comes from the brew. Very smooth and even a bit light for what this is, which makes it quite easy to drink, but ot could use a tad more oomph in the body for me. I don't like this quite as much as the 16, primarily beacause of the heft and flavor complexity. I tend to find that I like the balance id middle aged scotches as well where there is more flavorr development and integration than 12 year olds and less woodiness and fade than in 30 year olds. Haven't tried the Ola Dubh 30 yet, so we'll see if that holds true there as well."
"Poured into a tulip a dark black color, some carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, a few small islands, with very minimal sticky lacing. The nose is big and malty, some chocolate, toffee, and caramel, slight vanilla. The taste is malty, with some dark tones, and slight vanilla notes. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden pretty well. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, never heard of it before. Thanks Bill."
"Ola Dubh is some seriously good beer and the current king of Whiskey-aged beer for me. While all three are tasty, the 12 in a nutshell is more scotch-aggressive and punchy. A real winner."
"11.2 ounce bottle, bottle #01326, September 2007. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with a quarter inch tan head which went away pretty quickly. Lacing is OK. It smells like dark fruit, vanilla, roasted malt, oak and a bit of Scotch whisky. However the whisky aroma isn't nearly as strong as I thought it would be. Luckily the Scotch flavor shows up more in the taste. There's also coffee, roasted malt and smoke/peat noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it seems a bit thin at times but it is slick and smooth. Drinkability is good, the smoothness makes it easy to drink. I think this is a pretty decent brew overall, a good sipping beer."
"D- ide drink this all day"
"Pours thick as motor oil into my Czechvar glass. Bottled in September of 2007. Thin, creamy skin of head. Obviously zero carbonation. Aroma registers bourbon notes and smoky moss. The taste reflects the nose; smokey; whiskey overtones and some vanilla. Mouthfeel is viscous. Not a drinkable brew IMO. Yeah, the smoky flavor is interesting, but this is just not my favorite style and thus not worth plunking down the big bucks for again."
"drinkability is good. for 8% APV, one would never know it. this is a superbly smooth and mellow brew that could beat out most russian imperial stouts. masterfully crafted by the folks at Harviestoun. cheers!"
"enjoy"
"I recommend to anyone who is previously intrigued by the Harviestoun line of unique beers. Entry level for the brewery OR wood aged old ales? NO"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: amazingly mooth. Must have something to do with the aging in the casks, because this beer is ridiculously smooth. The 8% is merely a light warmth and the caramel, coffee, charcoal, and smoke are not overpowering in the LEAST. Id definitely reccommend this to anyone, at least for one glass."
"A fantastic beer; bold, agressive, balanced, and showing no signs of letting up. The pour delivers a near-black appearance with complete opaqueness. An initial 1/2"" head formation, reduced to a film, but held firm after that. Light on carbonation, it delivers a creamy tan foamstand. Aromas jump out with a roasted malt character, esters of plumb, grapes, and faint berries, and a hint of dirty, earthiness, and mild smoke. Firm alcohols are evident in the nose, but not obvious from Scotch barrel aging. Flavors of dry, roasted barley rests on a firm barley malt, sweet pillow. Decorated with peaty eartiness, walnuts, and dark fruits found in the nose-only muted. A complementary Scotch Whisky alcohol, oak, and smoke compounds the balace with complexity and variety. Light signs of oxidation (soy sauce) actually add to the complexity. The texture is rich, full, and viscous. The alcohols show signs of roughness that age will round out. Somewhat hot and numbing. Hop bitterness complements the roast barley and smoke nicely. Finishes malty rich and dry (coffee-like) with low sweetness. Very nice beer that will certainly improve with age. This beer begs to be paired with a robust cigar."
"Very drinkable, but feels bigger than it is (ABV-wise)."
"Got this one as a gift from my dad. Nice choice! Pours a surprisingly dark brown, almost stoutish color, with a nice finger of off-white head that dissolves fairly quickly down to a nice fine haze. No real lacing. Taste is strong and delicious. Tons of coffee and caramel malt. Roasted-ness in there. Chocolate and light hints of the ABV. Feel gets thicker as the beer goes down, interestingly enough. Smooth carbonation that fits just right. Really, this one is excellent. I guess the price is up there, but as a gift, I have no complaints. Delicious all around."
"Bottle courtesy of goryshkewych: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a medium foamy brown head with good retention retention. Aroma of chocolate with roasted malt is easily identifiable. The roasted malt with some medium notes of chocolate and coffee also dominates taste. Nice creamy body with some good carbonation and no alcohol was discernable. I can't say that I distinguished a lot of differences form the regular version and likely would stick to that one considering the difference in prices."
"A drinkable but pricey beer."
"As I said I don't know how to score this. I'll say this, I won't buy it again. It's expensive and it doesn't jump out as something special. That said I would like to try the other two in this series. It also seems to be taking a stock ale and starting to make it a stout. I'm going to score it as a sipper and as a bigger beer than it really is as that's how it drinks. If they had any intentions of this being"
"An absolutely lovely beer that is (sadly) both pricey and hard-to-find! Pours an almost inky black color with minimal head and carbonation... just a handful of dark tan bubbles sitting at the edge of the glass. Lovely malt flavor with elements of dark wood, chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Taste is similar... quite complex and full of subtle surprises. The fermentation in whisky barrels really contributes something to the flavor and experience here that I haven't found in similarly brewed beers. Incredibly smooth. This is a beer to be enjoyed very slowly! A new beer amongst my favorites..."
"If this stuff was cheaper I could drink quite a few of these. Need to have it on tap."
"nice and complex, stands out from other scotch ales, better for colder temperatures, would definitely drink again, highly recommended"
"D - Actually, a lot easier to drink than I expected. I was thinking this would be a definite sipper but on the whole it was easy to drink. I think part of this has to do with the lighter mouthfeel. It was a tasty brew and would definitely enjoy another if I have the chance to buy one."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Got this bottle labeled sept. 07 11.2oz for $8.99. Poured thick black with a small brown dissipating head into a snifter. Smelled of wood , vanilla, candi sugar I picked up some smoky flavors that reminded me of a Islay scotch. The taste on this one was my favorite part With a smooth chocolaty burnt wood taste, kind of oily on the mouthful little carbonation head totally gone now. The finish was very smooth with a little hop bitterness detected and very little alcohol for this great 8% old ale. Even with the hefty price tag I would try to find this rare one again."
"D: The flavor of this one is so intense, it makes drinking it a bit tiresome, but it's pretty damn good anyway. Worth the price tag."
"Appears a deep opaque charcoal tinted dried blood burgundy with a large mocha tan head sticking around a good bit after a sturdy upright pour, left behind is fine even lacing all around my chalice with each sip. Aromatics contain deep barrel aged notes with hints of ripened fruit, leather, oak, subtle anise, and mild medicinal layers. Another aspect brings mild chocolate and some burn marshmallow edges. Flavors are brash with oak aging however if you like this than that's a plus, big malty layers full of plum and vinous dried fruit notes. Mint edged chocolate with oak chips soaked in brandy really sum up the aspect that stands out here. Soothing alcohol soaked in fruit notes impresses me as well. Mouthfeel overall is viscous with complexity and a slightly hot alcohol finish carbonation overall is incredibly smooth and silky. Drinkability a complex beginning and really enjoyable UK experiment I hope to see more of this type of brew being bottled and shared around the world this is fantastic and I'm sure the 16 and 30 just get better and better time to go invest in those two this Friday."
"Drinkability: It's okay. In all honesty, it started losing me as time went on. Now to get my greedy hands on that 16 year old (the beer) to continue the Ola Dubh line."
"Overall, I am not going to lie, I am disappointed in this. I would have thought the flavors would have been much more pronounced and the aging taken a nice effect on it, but it just seemed too subdued for me, really never achieving any great height or depth. I am hoping the 16-year and especially the 30-year come off much better, we shall see. I will pop one this weekend and find out."
"D: This drinks easy. Scary easy honestly. At 8%, it's balanced and incredibly drinkable."
"D: I thought the thinness of this actually helped the drinkability score. Very easy to drink and quite rewarding. I can't wait to try the next two vintages. Seek this out at all costs!"
"I love the Scotch character. Not overwhelming like some barrel-aged beers can be. Smooth and mellow. Very good - can't wait to try the others."
"The glaring thing about this beer's mouthfeel is the thinness of body. It may look really viscous but it's quite light. It makes the drinkability insanely high, but it doesn't lend a lot of support for a tasty blend of flavors. Maybe the other reserves will be thicker."
"The same appearance as the Special 16 and 30 editions, i.e., solid black with a typical Porter-ish beige head. The smell, this time around, was more carob beans, chicory, and chocolate. The taste was easy drinking with a lot of wood tannins and roast grains. The body was kind of thin and underwhelming, but the finish was sprinkled with some spicy hops. I guess I just prefer the obvious Whisky notes of 30 than the astringency of the 16 or the woodiness of the 1. All of them are subtly different from each other, yet they ll succeed in their own way."
"It's not quite as rich and robust in flavor or, esp. body, but I'm far from complaining. The whisky barrel sure comes through in a nice way."
"D = This is a great beer. My only problem is that it is a little too much Scotch forward at the moment which masks some of the underlying beautiful beer characteristics I know are there. One to age."
"Pours out an oily, inky black with thin ring of frothy bubbles around the glass. Not much of a head presence. Smell is smokey, meaty, peaty, and phenolic from the whisky. I pick up a touch of booze. Underneath all this is some chocolate and dark fruit. Flavors between the base beer and the barrel-aging don't stand out apart from each other as much in the flavor and everything is blended nicely. It's a great mix of dried fruit, chocolate, light roast coffee, fruity esters, moss, tobacco, smoke, peat, wood, and vanilla. Delicious. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but it could use a little more weight. Has a bit of oiliness. Very drinkable. The only thing holding me back from rating the drinkability higher is the sweetness."
"This beer begs for a cigar. It seems like a natural match; with its dark flavor profile and relatively low sweetness it should match a good cigar nicely without becoming syrupy sweet the way some other big beers do when paired with cigars."
"The only fault for me is the under carbonation."
"Overall, this is an incredible beer that represents the potential for barrel aging to add flavor, balance flavor, and still leave behind a multidimensional, complex and drinkable beverage. I really can't say enough about this beer. It's simply great stuff."
"Completely black. Pours like oil, but with a short bubbly top that changes to just a film quite quickly. Nice long lacing. Looks decadent. Smells mildly sweet, boozy and malty, with chocolate and a bourbon/whisky backbone. Very inviting. ethanol odor maybe a little strong. Whoo! strong coffee, bitter grounds. Tempered smoked whisky flavor on smooth thick stout/old ale hybrid body. Some fruitiness. huge and delicious and about everything i could want in a super-special release like this. Alcohol warming and lingering. Full bodied without being syrupy or cloying. Great , as a sipper. A memorable treat."
"Bottom line: Tis a fine Old Ale and I'm glad I got to try it but I think it'll be just a one of because it's quite the expensive brew."
"Quite the specimen here. Can't wait to try the others as I've heard they are better. We shall see."
"Drinkability- Very nice for drinkability but there is no way I could go drinking this for days on end. Both the high gravity and the price are big detractors there."
"Pours pitch black with a thin tan head that only appears after a rigorous pour to conjour it up. Nose is not very prevalent. I get some tar and molasses and a bit of roasted smoke. After time as I sip I swear I get peat tones gently coming at me. But all of these come in small quantities. Flavor is a bit of a young wood thing. Interesting tang going on there. Smoked and roasted qualities are indeed there, but as minor influences. Tobacco makes its presence known and you definitely get some scotch character here as well. Feel is decent. For some reason, I just want to say that the liquid is a bit thin. The carbonation is full enough, but seems just slightly in the wrong direction as well. Overall this is a nice beer. I was expecting to be a bit more impressed in all honesty. Perhaps the 16 and the 30 will deliver a bit more bang for the buck."
"Mouthfeel is crisp for a beer of this style and maybe a little thin but not objectionable at all. More like a crisp apple dryness after you swallow."
"Na Zdravi!"
"This exceeded my expectations, though the strong flavors made an 11.2 oz bottle just the right amount."
