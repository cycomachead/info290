"Little to no head. Taste is pretty well balanced for as strong as it is. I like the sweet bread flavor. But too candy sweet for my taste. It has a slight alcohol aroma but not offensive."

"a beautiful sipper of a brown ale"
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer, but the alcohol was a bit  too prevalent.  Very enjoyable, would revisit."
""
""
""
"Certainly a very good to excellent barrel aged brown ale. Fantastic oaky nose and taste! I was half-way through my glass before realizing I was getting tipsy---11%!? Very smooth and drinkable so be slow with it. 4.5 out of 5.  Much better than other beers with more hype and brewery induced exclusivity.  Just because a brewer limits production, doesn't necessarily make it better beer..."
"o: A really pleasing version of Old Brown Dog, dangerously easy to drink given the very high ABV.  Probably worth cellaring some for six months to a year."
""
"Overall: Pretty nice brew.  Definitely grabbing some bottles to store in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
"I am NOT a BIG Porter or Stout fan so this Brown Ale would be my ""beer of choice"" if I was having a thick steak and baked potato dinner. Full Bodied, Brown Ale with a VERY high ABV (11.10%)  A perfect Sipping Man's Beer. Well Done Smuttynose!"
"Overall - I like. Nice glass for slow sipping on a cold evening."
""
"The beer with that sharp flavor is quite offensive, and the sweetness is not sufficient to balance out the beer."
""
"Dark garnet color with a thin tan head.  Fig, toffee and oak on the nose, with some breadiness in there, too.  Bran even.  Slightly creamy, syrupy mouthfeel with the same flavors as the aroma and plenty of hop bitterness for balance."
""
"This was strong but it never felt heavy and there was a good caramel malt tone to this that reminded me of the Brown Dog Ale that I was more familiar with. The nuttiness and underlying sweetness of the brown sugar and caramel made this a slow sipper but combined with the fruit flavors, made this one of the most complex Old Ales that I've ever had. Worth a go if you can find it as this is a worthy, ""Imperial"" take on the Brown Dog Ale!"
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style. it had pretty much all the key aspects that I look for in an Old Ale and in the end I did think it was a little on the boozy side, but the flavors and aromas kept me coming back for more.  This beer has ok drinkability, it's fairly smooth, a little crisp, a little creamy, nor sticky, not too filling and the alcohol could have been hidden better so I think one bottle would be my limit, I might regret it if I drink more than one in a row.  What I like the most about this beer was the aroma and appearance, they are both really nice and some of the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the booze, I think it could have been a hidden a little better.  I would buy this beer again and I would love to age some in the cellar.  I would recommend this beer, especially if you like strong Old Ales.  All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, some aspects were  little impressive and some weren't but in the end it made for a tasty beer and I enjoyed it.  So far it's one of my favorite Smuttynose beers and it's one of the better Old Ales I've had.  Good job guys, this is a tasty Old Ale, keep it up."
""
"O - A big warming old ale that you know means business upon first sip. It's brash and sweet and maybe lacking complexities but the deep caramel/brown sugar flavors are pretty substantial. Definitely hits the spot as a sipper on yet another cold and snowy night. Will probably buy this to age and save for future winters."
""
"While the aroma is a bit off, the fact that is smells a bit of wet dog kind of adds to the allure of this beer, based on its name. The color is lovely, and the taste is malty and mellow. I'm curious to see what age does to it."
""
""
"Overall kind of buttery which makes me question aging it, though a small amount of time may do it some justice."

"Golden amber in color with not much in the way of head retention or lacing.  Smells of some bread and fruits.  Taste is of sweet malts, dark fruits, and biscuits.  Coats the palate nicely and is quite enjoyable to drink.  I thoroughly enjoyed indulging on this Smuttynose take on an old ale!"
""
""
""
"Not super impressed with this one, Smuttynose can do better."
""
"Really Old Brown Dog is a good Old ""stock"" Ale that is a sipper even after [approximately] 2-years of age.  The ale paired well with Mexican style salsa and chips."
"A great beer. Pours a deep red/brown with little head. Aroma of roasted malt and fresh bread. Taste is that of deep malt and dried fruit. It's sweet on a molasses like level on the finish, and the alcohol is present at the end with a pleasant warming sensation. Medium body and just enough carbonation add to an overall well balanced and enjoyable experience. Definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
"A deep rich brown with a short-lasting creamy white head. The head leaves bigger volumes of small sticky lacing. The aroma is nutty but also sweet (think hazelnut). The body tastes barrel-aged and it dominates the flavor profile. The body is nice weight and there is a nice mouthfeel to it."
"This is drinking nicely right now, but with at least a year of aging it would be even better. A good, strong sipper for the cold months."
""

"Aroma brown sugar, malt, ABV, faint nuts, raisins, slight caramel.  Taste sweet toffee, molasses, dark fruits, boozy, oak, touch leather."
""
""
""
"Overall, I really like this beer.  Olive would approve."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is thin and cloudy with a hint of wood smell. BUT it drinks dangerously easily for 10% abv . Think Newcastle with a hint of sweetness and triple the malt flavor."
""

""

"Aroma was good, but on the mild side.  Tasting notes: Darks Fruits, Burnt Toffee, Oak, Faint Cinnamon with a medium body.  Looking forward to aging my other bottles."

"Overall: At a year or so old this beer is fitting in quite nicely to the old ale style. great notes of leather and oxidation along with dark fruits and slightly boozy qualities. some sweetness from possible adjunct usage and a wonderfully chewy-silky mouthfeel. this beer is a must try."
""
""
"O - Time has been kind to this one. A pleasant surprise, huge flavor profile with plenty of complexity. Gets a bit sweet as it warms, world class mouthfeel IMO."
""
""
""
""
"Brown is not a very appealing color for a beer, it pours out with very little head or lacing. It kinda just sits there, but the taste is special, and I feel it deserves a better appreciation for what it is."
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this beer but about 12 oz is enough -- big body and intensely malty with a nice use of alcohol presence in the background to remind you this is a big beer."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage bottling. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big biscuit, caramel, toast, molasses, brown sugar, light chocolate, raisin, plum, nuttiness, vanilla, toffee, herbal, oak, light leather, and toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, oak, and yeast ester flavors; with great strength. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, brown sugar, molasses, light chocolate, raisin, plum, nuttiness, herbal, vanilla, toffee, oak, light leather, and toast/oak earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toast, molasses, brown sugar, light chocolate, raisin, plum, nuttiness, herbal, toffee, oak, vanilla, light leather, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and fairy slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding old ale style. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and oak flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Overall: Really impressed with this one. Super flavorful and complex and at $6-7 per bottle, a really good value, which seems to be becoming more and more rare these days. Highly recommend picking up a couple bottles to drink and throw in the cellar."

"Nice Old Ale like qualities in this , just needs a bit more complexity."

"pours a dark cloudy amber brown. thin cream colored head. decent head retention. smells a bit boozy, rich carmely malts. toffee, vanilla, whiskey, raisins. taste is not quite as sweet as expected. malty, but not as bold of flavors as the aroma. medium body, lower carbonation, slick feel. aging well."
""
""
""
""
"A formidable old ale. It really did age okay. It warmed up and changed my whole perspective."
"A dark somewhat murky mahogany brown in the glass with a good bit of lace and a fine layer of tiny bubbles on top. Caramel and alcoholic sweetness in the nose, along with a bit of dark fruit and maybe some slight esters. This is a fairly sweet beer the high alcohol is also pretty noticeable. But there is more to the taste than just that as caramel is also very strongly present, there isnt much there in terms of hoppiness but there is a bittering character to somewhat balance the sweetness. Pretty slick mouthfeel as the sweetness really lingers for a long time, carbonation is pretty low which helps the beer feel pretty heavy and the alcohol brings a warming character to the beer. Overall, while this is a good beer, I was hoping to like it more than I do, it is a nice sipper although too sweet for me and I'd wish for the malt to be more complex as that seems to be somewhat lacking."

"At first sip I thought this would be a nice brown ale , but, it has some strange taste that I cannot describe,it is a bitter taste that hangs with you after each mouthful. Kinda like biting into a rotten nut , yuck! I had high hopes upon first sip but actually dumped the rest of my pint and the remaining bottle contents down the drain. I have only dumped a few beers down the drain in my life and this is one of them."

"Overall, this is a pretty good beer. I wish that ""off flavor"" wasn't there as it would make this a really great beer."
""

""

"Poured a cloudy dark brown with one finger head that stuck around and a strong malt smell - hit me immediately - as I got chocolate, toffee, caramel, a touch of roasted or coffee malts, and something akin to molasses or syrup and there is that ""dark fruit"" aroma (figs, black cherries, not sure). Thick, full-bodied, slightly chewey and heavy, this is not a beer if you like 'em light or not sweet. The sweet malts overpowered everything but since I have a sweet tooth the balance was just right for me. Caramel, toffee, chocolate sweetness and a bit of sticky syrupiness or molasses as well, but there is a touch fruit sweetness (I swear I picked up cherry). The alcohol is low key but does contribute to a dryer finish. Very slow sipper for me and one that I really enjoyed."

"O: the best component of this brew is how well the alcohol is hidden, but other than that, I am not a fan of this brew. simply off balance and a lack identity here."
""
""
""
""
"O-A solid well made Old Ale. Adam an its variants are better. But for the price, this one is hard to beat."
""
"I didn't taste this one when it was fresh, but I still feel like the flavors have probably blended well over the past year. I think this beer has probably improved other than being oxidized and a little stale. It wasn't always kept at cellar temps."
""
"O: There is a nice complexity to the flavors and aromas of this beer but I just wish that the alcohol was a little more well hidden in it. I enjoyed the beer and it feels like it is somewhere between a brown ale (maybe an imperial brown ale) and a barleywine."
"O: strange and nasty right out of the gate - give it few swirls and some time to air out and warm and it's not all that bad.... I think that it's not too often one (me) comes across a double-strength brown and can be unprepared, however, the alcohol could be thought of as harsh and a good year or two hiding this away could fix that"
""
"Really Old Brown Dog ale is a really tasty old ale loaded with dark fruit, deep and toasty malt flavors, and a solid booze kick. It's rather drinkable for the high ABV, and provide quite a bargain. Overall, Really Old Brown Dog is one of the best values on the market. Five bucks for a tasty bomber is really hard to beat. There's real depth of flavor here - it almost tastes like a BBA beer with the rich malt and boozy tones."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its drinkability. The nose started things off on a fair note as well, giving bright butterscotch sweetness and veritable smorgasbord of fruit to behold. While the former translated well into the flavoring, coming across as big, relatively dark, and biscuity, the latter added pecks of sweetness here and there, only becoming starkly noticeable in the end of the sip, where it was left essentially on its own to fight through the harshly bitter, boozy, and musky finish. This was, at first sip, rather off-putting, but as the beer warmed the flavors melded a bit more, calming the booze, while that 10.10% itself started to warm the drinker, and calm that pucker reflex as you sat back and accepted what was in front of you. This is an interesting offering from Smuttynose, but it just wasn’t exactly to the same level we’ve come to expect from them, and especially from their “Big Beer” lineup."

"O: Pretty nice old ale. I don't love the wood flavor, but besides that I'm ok with this beer."
""
""
""

""

"Poured from a bottle into a tulip, the beer is a ruby-highlighted light brown coloring with a thin, sparse, filmy head coating the surface. Aromas of roasted nut sweetness, old world fruit sweetness, and boozy character. This one smells big. Flavors are rich and bold on the forward tongue, with a roast and bitter backbone supporting date and fig sweetness throughout. Subtle spices and honey sweet highlight, as well as a not so subtle boozy ribbon throughout the palate. Rich, slightly cloying sweet aftertaste, with earthy notes. Slick, slightly abrupt finish on the palate, with a slightly sweet and boozy linger."
""
"Murky mahogany hue with nearly no head, just a wispy topping. Aromas of raisin, apple, and caramel with a bit of oxidation from the age and a vague nuttiness. Rich, malty taste, but not overly sweet by any means. Brown bread, cake, apple, brown sugar, light earthy spice, and fig...very smooth, well integrated flavors. Moderate body, lighter than initially expected, but the '07 was a laid-back 7% compared to today's 10%+. Nothing outstanding, but I enjoyed my ten ounces."
""
""
"Really dark amber that looks brown unless held to the light. Nice white lacing doesn't last long as it warms. Smell is not that intense until it warms up, then the floral (violet candies) booziness comes out. Somewhat floral and sweet caramel with a hint of hazelnut creme liqueur and maybe some chocolate on the nose. Sweet without being overly cloying because of the burn from the alcohol- the flavor is just kinda sugary and maybe marzipan then the violet-like fusel alcohol flavor comes in and the burn starts to sear all the sweet mess off my tongue."

"won't revisit unless someone opens a bottle from their stash."

""
"GOOD; NICE OFFERING!"
""
""
""
""
"O- The spicy and wood is well balanced with nice malt characters that compliment each other. I don’t get any dried fruit character but it has a nice flavor and I think it would age well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I couldn't believe this was just sitting on the shelf when I walked in yesterday. This is really deep and complex. Lots of caramel/honey/vanilla/oak/marshmallow sweetness, but a really nice bit of roasted malts and dark fruit. I NEED to grab a few more of these before they dissapear."

"Bottle dated 03/31/12, and probably could have done with another year or two of cellaring. Pours an oily ruby-amber, a beautiful colour but with little head or lacing. Resinous aroma of wooden planks and bourbon barrels, with a sweet caramelized malt background. An alcohol bitterness in the nose and very much so in the warmth of the finish. Flavours aren't as well balanced as I'd choose, with an initial sweetness that transitions to pure alcohol and bitterness. Doesn't have the depth I expected from this caliber of a brewery - but that may be my fault for drinking it too young. Should have bought two so I could have confirmed!"
""
"Overall- A decent vintage, very complex. A bit too cloying on the whole for my taste; however, this particular sample has aged quite gracefully. Kudos to Smuttynose in crafting a fine brew."

"M - Medium body. Chewy. Light to moderate carbonation."
""
"Note: 2012 vintage"
"Well, I didnt cellar this beer, I bought it today. It pours a deep, rich, murky red with a khaki head that dissapates quickly. It leaves a nice lacing while it lasts. It smells of figs, malt, alcohol, and a hint of citrus. It has a creamy/oily mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Figs, Vanilla, and a slight oakiness dominate the palate. A little hoppy bitterness on the finish that lingers along with a slight tingling on the tongue. As other reviewers have said, it is a little rum like. I will have to buy a few more and try aging them, although it is excellent right now."
""
""
"This bottle was a 2008 vintage from my cellar. Poured into tulip glasses. Chestnut brown body. Carbonation has diminished a bit, but there was still decent lacing. Smell was ripe with raisins and fig. Flavor was sugary, rum-like, and malty. Still a hit of booze there after all these years. Mouthfeel was on the thin side but still smooth. I liked this beer, and I think it aged well. It just so happened that I had a 2008 Smutty Baltic Porter the same weekend, and that blew the ROBDA out of the water."
""
""
""
"Overall I think somewhere in the middle of these two editions is a decent beer but for me the newer was too ""green"" and the aged one was too sweet and cloying. I ended up blending the two to confirm my belief but the beer still lacks some complexity which I desire in my ""big"" beers of this nature."
""
" A good beer though higher in alcohol for my taste drinks small."
""
""
"All in all, it's pretty good but perhaps nothing super special. Goes down well for its high alcohol."
"Anyhow, I love Smutty! I'll buy another and check it out next fall."
""
""
"O- This is the fresh 2013 batch. Having tried this before with some age on it I must say that I think it will be much better in October or November. Definitely planning to pick up another for the cellar. Also, this is my first review and it makes me realize that while I have formed definite opinions about what I like and don't like, I have trouble finding adjectives for this."
""
""
"Beer is heavy-bodied, true to style, with medium to medium-light carbonation. This brew sits on the palate a fairly long time to let the flavors and ethanol sink in. Resulting mouthfeel is thick, chewy, spicy, and burning. Ethanol creates the burning, essentialy from the front of the palate onwards; spicy arises also from ethanol, with substantial heat and burn from this component. Closes dryly, with some lingering stickiness on lips from sugars."
""
""
"Medium texture in the mouthfeel and very drinkable for the high abv. I liked this very much and will look for it in bottles. Recommend it."
""
"Very good as is, but would probably benefit from some aging It seems a bit green."
""
"Ive been looking at this in my cellar for the last 6 months...picked a good outdoor night with the beer tasting group to pull it out. Very unique. Thanks for the cellar cleaning mikeyv35."
""
"O- I like this as a warming old ale. Good amplified flavor really shows up in the taste profile. Keep the big beer series coming smutty!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Very nice Old Ale. Rich and complex and quite drinkable for a big 10% beer. Been wanting to try this for some time and I’m glad I finally got a chance to."
"O: a good beer, but that is all; I love old ales, wee heavies, and barleywines, but this not one of the best, but it is worth a try if you like the style; rather like an American barleywine met a brown ale in style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, a solid malty brew that I think will age exceptionally well."
""
"O: As a 2007 vintage I was a bit nervous but when I purchased this bottle at Smuttynose back in December of 2011, I knew it had been cared for properly. It has aged extremely well. I am a huge fan of Smutty's Big Beer Series and I would not hesitate to buy another vintage brew from them."
""
"Creamy malt with a slight taste of toffee, followed by a sharp alcohol bite. It is smooth and not as harsh as Curmudgeon, but then it also lacks the flavor. Overall it falls a little flat."
"O - The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. An enjoyable beer that hides the alcohol fairly well and introduces some nice flavors."
""
"Overall I think this is a pretty decent tasting beer. Big malt body, caramel, light hop bitterness, and a good rich body. I agree aging it would probably make things even better."
"O: Could use some age, but this certainly isn't as bad fresh as some people have made this out to be. Maybe it's just this years, but this is solid fresh. Definitely get a couple bottles to age, though"
""
""
"This is a beer that has already caught me by surprise. This ancient canine ale coats my cup well for a 10 percent beer. The lacing on my glass is brilliant. The head retention is quite impressive as well. I take a quick smell-- wow, is that fruity! Seriously, it has the scent of a ripe, yet tart apple. It packs an acetic punch. I also pick up on some brown sugar and date characteristics too. Honestly, it's a very comely smell. I take a taste, and quickly, I am caught of guard yet again by its well-rounded sweetness. Again, it has a nice fruity sweetness, but it is not cloying at all. It finishes a bit dry with some interestingly leathery notes-- almost like tobacco. This is quite a complex beer. It's chewy, it's estery, and it's a success for Smuttynose. Try this beer. Cheers."
""
""
"Needs age big time. Really sweet and still pretty good, but with age could be amazing. I'll grab another bottle and let it sit for 2 years"
""
""
""
""
""
"This one is kind of a mess. Sweet, yet with noticeable alcohol. The yeast is present and kind of pleasant."
""
"O/D-I have been wanting to try this beaut for a few years. This is a big, bold, complex and outright delicious Old Ale. Kept me interested throughout and also added a pretty legit buzz from the whole bomber. Smuttynose is terrifically consistent and at $6 for this brew, its a decent deal."
"O Overall I thought this beer was excellent. It is only my second Old Ale, the first being Hair of the Dog's Adam, and I would say that it is just as good if not better than Adam."
"O: Though the ABV is high, this beer still has what it takes to show the varieties of complex notes to each review category. I'm thoroughly impressed. I think this ranks up among the stars of the greatest beers I've ever had at least for me. I can't wait to have this again."
""
""
"D: drinks really good for how fresh this is. would love to put some of these down for a little bit, and for the price this is certainly reasonable."
""
""
"Pours a clear, dark coppery brown, almost mahogany, with a very thick, if not too persistent, pale tan head. Strong aroma has a malty core and a yeasty overtone plus hints of apple, caramel and cloves. Scrumptious flavor has firm malty and yeasty notes plus tones of cloves, caramel and apple. It has a bit of an alcohol-like bite. Texture has average body but is quite lively and fizzy, leaving behind a persistent tingle on the tongue and lips. This dog will have your taste buds barking with joy!"
""
""
"O- This offering from Smuttingnose is a winner in my book..."
""
""
"Poured from Bomber into Duvel Tulip...This beer looks amazing...fluffy off white head , with a nice brown/red body...head rests leaving a bit of lacing..tight bubbles form the carbonation....smells a bit boozy with hints of fruit maybe apple...tastes malty sweet with a bit of boozy hotness...overall a good beer at a fair price...under $9"
"M&D - an overall drinkable old ale, with great complexity and a mellow rounded out flavor and a sneaky ABV. Smuttynose continues to put out quality stuff."
""
"22oz bottle, 2012. Pours a rusty brown color with a huge off-white head that holds great retention and leaves tons of chunky lacing on the glass. Aromas are boozy with some chocolate and caramel. Tastes are complex but the alcohol is hot and takes away from the experience. Notes of chocolate, toasted grain, raisin, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and white pepper are all present. Mouth-feel is medium bodied with good carbonation, while being creamy and smooth, and finishes on the dry side. Overall, good flavors and complexity, but the booze is overwhelming. As far as an old ale goes this is in a category of its own, but I do feel the product is what was intended by the brewery - a fusion between a brown ale and an old ale. Makes sense, but I wasn't crazy over this one."
"This one is nice and rich but the dryness on the finish that strikes the perfect balance between the two; I wouldn't mind having this one again for sure."
"D/O: A nice change of pace; this strong ale is malt focused with clearly English qualities. It delivers a complex, but inclusive, experience, seeming careful not to tread too heavily on the palate. While not perfect, it is different enough and charming enough to be remembered as something of a sleeper."
""
"O- I love the smell of this but I just can't get down with the taste. Other than that, it's halfway decent for how strong it is."
"A nice bit englishy style old ale. I like it."
"A very flavorful and intersting brew. Many subtle layers to enjoy. The intense musty, leathery, oaky, tobacco quality is something I have not encountered before."
""
""
"Soft amber, caramel color with a nice head. This beer's nose is quite interesting and actually reminds me of an old dog that just so happens to be ""really"" old, yet intriguing. As the brew touches my palate, it takes on a whole other dimension. Drinks well for having an ABV of 10%. Impressive BIG BEER Series selection from Smuttynose."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is excellent beer, and the aging that has been done to the normal Old Brown Dog Ale has brought out an excellent range of flavors. In fact, only the slightly-too-high alcoholic kick prevents this one from being a perfect 5 in flavor. Must try."
""
"Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy. Overall, the last 15 months have treated this beer very well and I'll certainly make sure I lay a bottle of this down each time it's released"
"Beer is very vanilla-y and oaky on the finish, a mild bitterness and a lot of heat and solvent. It sort of tastes like vanilla extract at times, it also burns a bit. It is very strong, very forward, not a horrible beer but there is definitely some odd alcohols in this one. Not a repeat."
"O: Nice brew. It tastes like a cross between a really big brown ale and an old ale or a barleywine. Toasted malt character is quite strong and pleasant. Big and boozy, especially this young."
"Overall this is a good beer but certainly not my favorite in Smuttynose's Big Beer series. I miss the Baltic Porter.... that was a damn fine product!"
""
""
""
"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip glass. Poured aggressive and got a huge 4 inch sticky white head, with tons lacing, and excellent retention. Smell is brown sugar, bread, alcohol, vanilla, and dark fruits. Taste is all of that, less booze than the smell, huge brown sugar up front, with dark fruit and vanilla in the finish. Body is thinner than you expect, but medium. Plenty of carbonation, a little dry, and a definite sipper. This beer has gotten better over the years, much more approachable than  few years ago and less boozy."

"22 ounce bottle, 2010 vintage. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/mahogany color with an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is rich and malty, the brew smells like brown sugar, toffee, brandy, caramel and dark fruit. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like toffee, caramel, dark fruit, vanilla and some booze. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich and chewy with moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and easy to drink. I think it's a good overall beer, I'll have to buy another bottle of this and age it for longer. Definitely worth trying."

"Nice big beer; the flavours are all pleasant but I feel the balance has slipped somewhere and, in a different sweetness/non-sweetness ratio, this could be amazing."

"Great beer. It doesn't shy away from showing its alcohol, but it manages to balance it really nicely. It's a big, sweet and heavy beer, no question, but it's also a delectably drinkable one."
"Overall, very good take on the style. Everything I would expect, and no surprises, which is good and disappointing. I'd love to try an aged version of this beer, but I will probably reach for this again."
"This is one damn fine beer, and I think takes the spot as my favorite from the folks at Smuttynose."
"Overall: Very drinkable! Hardly a hint of booze in this '08 brew. This is like having a fine port/sherry wine for dessert. The older the dog, the better the dog! And at this price (see above), I will go back for more."
"2008 bottle courtesy of G311. The brew pours a lustrous auburn-mahogany hue, and is capped with an inch or two of khaki froth. The beer is very deliciously malty, with notes favoring rich caramel - akin to Sugar Babies candy - and with a hint of herbal, spicy, earthy hops still apparent. It is silky and rich, but not overwhelming. The ABV is unnoticeable. Really nice and drinkable beer here; I easily crushed the bomber solo."
"Overall: Solid beer and does the original proud. This doesn't taste anything like an old ale (barleywine, IMO), it tastes like an Imperial Brown, and a damned good one at that. Perfect autumn beer and the nearly 4 years in the bottle have mellowed it out nicely."
"D - a slow sipper best enjoyed with others."
"Well done, as are most of the Big Beer Series beers."
"Poured ruby tinted Brown color with a Light, but steady head of Carbonated bubbles. Smell of heavy Roasted caramel Malt, rich oak, sweet dark chocolate, sweet berries and hint Alcohol. The taste is the exact same as the smell. The longer it sets the more malty it gets. There is no mention of barrel aging, But The Oak and the Alcohol flavor are telling me otherwise, Maybe it's just the Alcohol coming through. This is a 2010, Maybe I will get another and let it sit a little longer. I do like this a lot, though."
"Dark brown pour with a tan head. Smells of sweet caramel and and tropical fruits. Tastes of beautiful ripe berries and a nice malty backbone. Carbonation and mouthfee are amazing not crazy carbonated but not flat. Overall 3 years has turned this maybe B beer into a hands down A+ absolutly amazing."
"Overall: Doesn't stand out as a bottle conditioned beer, which is good in my opinion. No unfermented yeast detected here. Very drinkable. Starts out super sweet, turns worty/roasty then leaves a nice alcohol/estery aftertaste."
"Overall: it was good but I’m still not a bit old ale fan, they are usually too sweet for me."
"Yum. About 8 ounces to go."
"22oz bottle with a Bottle Conditioned Date notched at 2010. Pours a murky, dark dark chestnut color with a 1/2 inch of creamy head. Aroma is a big whiff of booze. Dark fruits as well but the alcohol smell dominates. Taste is more of the same. Booze and dark fruits upfront with some vanilla at the end. Some caramel flavor. The 10% abv makes its presence known. Very little carbonation, but that is to be expected. I would like to see if the alcohol flavor would mellow with some more age on it. Overall, it is a decent beer and worth grabbing every so often."
"Fuller bodied, decent carbonation, chewy and roasty, lingering and lasting feel. Drinks decently, but overall a bit too sweet for my tastes, especially with the combination of brown sugar and dark fruit."
"A nice product!!! I'll look for another to cellar."
"M-Thick and syrupy, light carbonation."
"D: You dont feel its 10% till the end. Could but a few back quickly."
"Pours a hazy deep brown color with a light tan head. In the aroma, dry caramel, and a small roasty malt. In the taste, oaky, bourbon like notes, a small roast and caramel hints. A smooth and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a dry oaky bourbon like aftertaste. Nice hidden oakiness, nice mellow bourbon notes and a sipper for sure."
"My whole life I've lived with dogs in the house. They are wonderful, meaningful members of the family. But they are a lot of work once they get old. Of course we still love them unconditionally. The people at Smuttynose obviously love this beer, brewed in commemoration of their dog Olive, but I can't shake the thought that it may be time for them to start looking at some new projects. It's about time this old girl be retired..."
"Really nice brown ale. The aromas are complex with many sweet notes. The dominant tastes are nut and malt. It was an easy beer to drink. You would not suspect the alcohol content was around 10% so it is slightly dangerous in that regard. Highly recommended."
"Poured into a pint glass a hazed chesnut russet brown with a thin toasted almond colored head that was gone quickly.Deep malty aromas,brown sugar,roasted nuts,and some whiffs of dark fruit,the alcohol sweetness isnt to strong.Not as big and chewey as I would have thought,not to thin,just a little thinner than most of the style I think.Sweet malty flavors,again the brown sugar element is big along with light bakers chocolate,there is a fig/plum jamminess as well.Its quite sweet but its pretty good,a one and done though with the alcohol level and sweetness."
"Why have I passed up Really Old Brown Dog Ale for so long? It's a high-quality beer; one that's a fully enjoyable sipper. It's an exceptional value to boot."
"D- At 10% abv, you really don't get that and it's quite drinkable"
"DB- Flavorful old ale with a Brown twist. Goes down easy for an Old Ale."
" Awesome fucking beer, either way."
"Pours a semi clear, dark brown, slight amber colour with a decent amount of head. Tastes of slight caramal malt with a candied sugar like finish. Drinks down very smooth and the high alc % is very well hidden. Very easy to drink. Quite a tasty old ale overall."
"The mouthfeel is a bit above medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it had some nice flavors to it. It was a bold beer but came together pretty nicely. It was hoppier then I expected for an old Ale, but it gave it an American kind of twist that I enjoyed. Pretty decent beer overall, but not my favorite of the style."
"Drinkable - the 10% can pack a punch though. Enjoy."
"Doesn't have that full on malt bath feel or taste that I expect from the style. I'm using head over heels in love with everything from the Smuttynose big beer series, or anything Smutty in general, but this is pretty average. Can't teach an old dog new tricks?"
"4.0/4.5/3.5/3.0/4.0"
"D: This was probably the most drinkable Old Ale I've ever tried. The ""Old Brown Dog"" doesn't have anything on this!"
"D - For 10% ABV this is a pretty drinkable beer. Its nice and silky, and it goes down smooth. this is another great addition to the Smuttynose Big Beer Series. I would definitely pick this one up again."
"Drinkability: A little bit less than what I was expecting, but a nicely made beer nonetheless. The 10% is nothing to sneeze at but was undetectable, and - though I can certainly imagine other beers I'd likely prefer to have if I want to get drunk on a 10% abv beer - this one fit the bill fairly nicely."
"Drinkability - Halfway through the first pour and the alcohol and sweetness are making this a slow sipper. As I move on to the second glass I am more comfortable with this beer's freshness and complex layers. This is definitely a sipper and would have benefited greatly from some aging, but I'm happy to try a fresh 2010 bottle of this."
"Notes: Definitely not the best of the style. I wonder if some extended aging might iron this one out a bit. The extreme fruitiness makes it seem much too young. Having said all of that, this is not a bad beer, and due to the extremely fair price and wide availability, this will continue to find its way into my cellar during the winter months."
"D: Goes down somewhat easily, somewhat filling, nice kick, ok representation of style. The sweetness was a bit much."
"Thanks Andy for cracking this one. Poured into a tulip. The body is deep mahogany with just a thin layer of light tan head than quickly dissipates and doesn't leave much for lace. The aroma is very rich and malty with lingering aromas of dried dark fruit, toffee and residual nuttiness and wood. The taste is vey sweet to start with caramel malts, with toffee and just a bit of dark fruit and little bit of a woody nutty flavor. Low carbonation and a little bit of a metallic after taste but over all this one is pretty nice. Really just a sipper, but very enjoyable."
"M/D - On the lighter side of medium bodied. Alcohol provides quite a bit of warming. I would go so far as to say the alcohol is a bit too much for a 10% beer if that is possible."
"M/D - Heavy mouth that is weighed down with a very sweet aftertaste and low carbonation. Fairly drinkable, for an old ale. Final verdict: Not bad"
"The brown sugars are very pronounced and it is a bit too boozy for my tastes. The beer is heavily malted with some run and plum flavors, maybe a touch of booze soaked pineapple type fruits. The beer doesn't have a throaty burn for its high ABV and its booziness, and that's a good thing, but The dark malt, brown sugars, boozy fruits, slight mint flavors, and overall thickness really define this beer. I'm not a big fan of this sipper and mischaracterized style."
"A great after dinner drink for sure. Nice substitute for a cognac."
"D - Very enjoyable and unique ale. Would definitely recommend it."
"Watch the pour or you will get close to four fingers of light tan foam, mostly loose smaller bubbles but has a couple of ""lilypads"" of larger bubbles, adequate retention given where it starts from, the lacing ""sticks around"" well and lasts much longer than you'd expect at first. Foggy brown-red colored liquid, cloudily opaque with no bubbles to be seen, the rims and glass bottom shift between orange and yellow. Extremely thick and dense nose of molasses, maple syrup, caramel, toffee, milk chocolate covered raisins, dates, figs, prunes, honey dolloped scones, there is absolutely nothing about the nose that is not in your face sweet, chocolate dipped cherry, apricot, pineapple fruit, can't really expect more concentrated orange reduction than here, defies anything to get in the way of its avalanche of sugar. Full-bodied, at first the tiny bubbled foaminess of the attack thinks you might get something different here but all that molasses maple syrup, toffee, chocolate takes over your mouth like it owns the deed. Date, raisin, prune, fig fruit, you name it, buttressed by apricot, pear, peach, green melon, yellow apple, pineapple flavors, The carbonation is not weak per se but nowhere near being able to handle the weight and momentum of the primary material. Basically, if hops were involved in the creation of this brew, damned if I noticed. Egregiously smooth and satiny mouth feel, creamy. All I can say is that you will do this beer a disservice if you don't spark a cigar with a wet maduro leaf around it as accompaniment."
"Overall: This is a big beer and very unique. I can see picking one of these guys up each year, maybe even putting them down for a cellar session. However, I don't think this is a fantastic beer. If anything, some of the flavors need to meld or mellow with age. The sugary sweetness gets to overwhelming proportions later in the bottle. The boozy heat could stand a few months of cooling off to allow the other flavors to stand out on their own."
"Brown dog pours out very brown, not quite approaching black but a very brown dog here. Good doggie. A nice vanilla cream colored head on top with some life and sturdiness, not much stick though. This is big beer so yes, there is a touch of alcohol in the nose, but it does not burn. A whole lot of brown sugar reaches my nostrils though, this one smells sweet but not killer like a certain upstate NY brewery. Taste is a mix of brown sugar, vanilla, roast, chocolate, plum, more dark fruits and some booze. I like the mix, it tastes really good for what seems to be a mix of a big brown and a old ale. Feel is above medium and a bit hot, but this goes down smooth as silk. A nice amount of life on the tounge. The alcohol hit me, I don't think I could do a whole bottle of this one to the head, a bit sweet but not cloyingly so. A great one to share with some peeps."
"D- a very tasty brew and a really great sipper on a cold night. Not to hot you can't enjoy it fresh but will be even better with some time on it. This with some warm apple pie and vanilla ice cream would be amazing."
"Pours a murky chocolate brown color with some honey hightlights which gives the beer an iced tea appearance. The head was small yet tight, left a ring once it settled. The aroma is of milk chocolate, candied plums, raisins and fig. Perhaps a touch of roast. A nice balanced aroma for an olde ale. A very nice milk chocolate malt which serves as the backbone for the flavor profile. Some vanilla is present before the dark fruit flavors start to seep in. There is some boozy raisins/plum to go along with fig and carob. There is a bit of a bitter presence in the end. The beer has a moderate to fully body with prickly carbonation, a bit chewy and a light abv hit. A fresh old ale as it was brewed in 2010. It doesn't have the strong vinous fruit flavors which is typical for the style but the flavors that it does have, I enjoy. The feel is still a bit raw as the carbonation is present but I don't really mind that. Give it a year and it would be most enjoyable."
"D - Not sure if it is has great drinkability but it is nice worth a try."
"Not sure how often I'd ever want to order this beer, but it's not bad."
"Highly recommended!!"
"All in all, this one tasted better at the tasting. It's a good brew, but not a great brew. Some age might help mellow out the alcohol, but the flavors aren't as extensive as I would've liked. Worth a try if you have access, but don't bother hunting it."
"Drinkability wise it's great.. Having more than one may ruin your palate for the rest of the evening. It's a dominating feeling within the taste buds. Spicy, robust and damn right tasty.. Cheers"
"D: Not a beer I'd drink of regularly, but nonetheless well made and drinkable."
"M/D - the beer has a medium body with low carbonation. There is almost a grainy quality to the mouthfeel of this beer. Overall another good big beer by smutty"
"Pours a mostly clear deep ruby with dark orange edges, two finger cream colored head fades to a thin layer leaving a ring of thin lace. Smell: brown sugar, date, a whiff of pumpernickel, apple, greenish hops that seem to fade after a minute. Taste: caramel, unfiltered apple juice, milk chocolate, slightly nutty, earthy hopping, with a sticky, drying and leafy finish. Sweet and boozy, pretty heavy. Fall 2010 bottling."
"I mentioned this beer is not complex, however that does not mean it's boring. Sometimes a focus on a few aspects really allows a particular aspect of a beer to shine through and Really Old Brown Dog is exactly that, a big (and really tasty) brown ale."
"This is not exactly traditional, but it is exactly what I personally want from an Old Ale. I bet the bottle I'm going to age will become an A+ beer."
"The taste is much more complex with raisins, figs, malt, and sweet candy and brown sugars. Vanilla and brandy give it another dimension. This is smooth and creamy with a creme brulee-like custard feel. The 10% can definitely be felt, but the strong hints at the alcohol go on and off while its velvety richness ultimately outlasts the booziness. Like to try this again with some time on it."
"It has a decent drinkability, drinks much lighter than 10%, but a touch of booze, some lingering malts that are nice, but it adds a hint of salty minerality as well. A nice chewy flavor too."
"D-This beer is a bit harsh, and as others have said, it would probably benefit from aging."
"22oz bottle into a Hopus tulip pours a crisp not too dark brown with a nice frothy khaki head that slowly diminishes to a ring and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is toasted brown malts, brown sugar, mild cocoa and earthy hops. The taste is a nice amount of sweet toasted brown malts, brown sugar and a nice amount of earthy mildly citrus hops providing a nice backbone to this very sweet brew. The beer is a bit on the heavy side, but it certainly seems like it will tone down with age. This is a very enjoyable beer, I plan on picking up a few more bottles to see how it ages."
"Like a nice tawny port (though not as sweet), it had gracious nutty aromas and flavors and nice toffee on the palate. A very generous beer that was certainly not overwhelming."
"Smutty recently started filling this in 12oz bottles.  I picked one up for $3.00 at Craft Beer Cellar here in Portsmouth, NH.   Bottle conditioned Nov 2014, 11.1% ABV.   Tasting notes above from the 2010 vintage are still applicable, the experience is much like I remember from having this several times before."
"From the 2010 series. Sampled on Aug. 31, 2010. The pour is a murky, dark brown with a decent fluffy beige head that settles down and leaves lacing along the way. The aroma is a combination of roasted malts, dark fruit esthers, and a minor dose of hops. The body is full. The taste has a little more of an alcohol pungency than in the aroma but overall the result is malts and bitter hops around the edges."
"Pours a dark chestnut with a creamy pancake head. Smells sweet, almost of maple syrup. Tastes big and sweet and of maple syrup, but there is some firm malt and some earthy hops helping to break things up. This is a big, sweet beer, and as such is definitely a sipper. I'd say late fall, on the deck."
"Reminicent of New Holland's Dragonsmilk with less sweetness and more tartness, the malts hold Really Old together. I would swear this tap serving ame from a barrel or firkin aging, but Novare Res in Portland, Maine, offers me no details. It has a huge body, creamy and chewy: it certainly tastes barrel conditioned. I enjoyed this bigger beer, and I don't see the connections to the Old Brown Dog brewed by Smuttynose except for the naming. An excellent high-gravity beer that does not represent the purported style, but I could certainly see craving this big beer."
"An interesting American twist on an Old Ale, but it's far from any traditional examples of the style. Smutty hints that this is a good candidate for aging. We agree, as everything still seems a bit too ""green"" for the style. However, if you can't wait, like us, we recommend allowing this beer to warm and open up before enjoying it."
"More age might enhance the vinuous notes, but this is drinking very well at the moment. There are more complex examples of the style, but the flavors in this are wonderful."
"D - good flavor, a bit hot to drink alot of but very enjoyable to me"
"The palate is solid. For its age, it's still surprisingly hoppy with a moderate earthy, leafy character. The hop character, coupled with a light to moderate grainy bitterness forms a great backbone upon which the malt character is allowed to shine. Mildly fruity for sure with some prunes, there's also a solid leather character. The flavors and nose make me thing of an amped up nut brown ale. While there's a touch of stale oxidation present, thankfully it isn't too much. Slightly sweet on the finish with a blend of honey and bitterness, this beer is full in body with moderate carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden too. Drinking an entire 22oz is going to be a bit of a chore, but I've got all night. Unfortunately, though, I never got around to finishing it. Oh well, I still did enjoy the beer."
"Overall, my theory remains untainted, this was a good brew! It was just a little to hot for me at this point in time, more age should do it nicely."
"T- Big fruity strawberry peach, pear and watermelon, yes, watermelon.. Caramel drizzled on top. Estery. What a unique old ale."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle. Label states ""Bottle conditioned in 2007"". Uncapped and poured into a standard shaker glass. The ale appears a hazed honey chestnut color with barely a fingers worth of off white foam. Nose and flavors consist of molasses, light brown sugar, mild hint of cherry, raisins, a good amount of caramelized malt, plums. Going off the ABV, I expected this to have more body. Certainly does not drink like a 10% ale. Decent overall, but I'm not sure holding on to this for a few years yielded any benefits."
"OVERALL sip, savor, share. Very tasty and complex, but also big, strong and boozy."
"D- I think another would be trouble, but I want a case of this to sit on. Truly an amazing beer. Wow!"
"Drinkability: I'd like to get another and see how it ages after three years, but this seems like a good time to drink the 2008 Vintage. A lot of flavor and a great sipper. Another great effort from Smuttynose."
"Bottle from New Hampshire trip."
"D: Nice hop backbone, high abv. The alcohol is there but not overwhelming."
"D: A bit too hot and a bit too thick to make this one highly quaffable. Definitely a by-the-fire type of sipper."
"D-A lovely brew....a bomber is maybe a bit much, as it packs a punch, and has a strong flavor profile, but definately a keeper, and probably a good one to cook with as well. I'm not a huge fan of Smuttynose, but this is clearly the best thing I have ever tried from them."
"D: Not an old ale but it is an excellent brown ale which is an often neglected style. I am not certain if ""Imperial Brown Ale"" is a real animal. I still would not put this beer into that realm because it is not complex or lush in terms of flavor. Also, the body, color, and head retention don't go beyond the normal scope of a brown ale. The only things about this beer that make it big are the quantity of hops and the ABV. I think this beer is just what I stated above - an excellent brown ale and nothing more."
"Man, I like this beer a whole lot. It breaks the mould, in that it has elements of a traditional Old Peculieresque old ale, a Belgian strong dark and the more recent interpretations of the style brewed in the United States that resemble strong English barleywines. I'm very sad that I never got to try the original incarnation of this beer. The high drinkability is a giant plus in my book, as the flavor profile is still very bold as with the finish, without being cloyingly sweet."
"Smuttynose ROBD pours a bright red with a nice thick head. The aroma is sweet rich dark fruit and a lot of dry oak. Some herbal, hops and medicinal alcohol show up as well. The flavor is sweet and sharp upfront, but the raisiny sweetness gives way to more sharp herbal and grapefruity hops. The oak is apparent upfront but comes out more in the finish, which is sweet with more malty dark fruit and some hints of port."
"D: Insanely drinkable. Fresh it was not nearly this good which pounds home the point never drink an old ale fresh. Even 4 months will do you wonders. The smuttynose Big beer series continues to impress."
"Chestnut brown body. Clarity is good. Thin beige head leaves moderate amounts of lace. Like the nose. Complex subtle notes of wine, port, passion fruit, oak, alcohol, rum, vanilla and nougat. I get oak notes right off the bat. Also rum sensations of alcohol and a little whiskey. Fruity tones along the line of a spiked fruit punch. Maltiness is pretty rich and nougat and caramel come through as well. Body is medium to medium full and the carbonation is held in check, creating quite a silky feel in the mouth and lending to easy drinkability for a 10% beverage. Unique and well done."
"D - A little sweet and boozy but makes for a nice sipper, especially if you share the bottle with a friend."
"HV"
"D: Everything Smuttynose is new to me and I'm loving it. This is sweeter than what I would usually drink...but I'd have it again without anyone twisting my arm"
"A tad too sweet for the style but still a great brew. Highly recommend for old ale lovers."
"D: Likable stuff, another solid brew from Smuttynose (I'll ask again: please, can you come to Oregon?). This particular one isn't my favorite of their brews (a bit too sweet for the style - or is it? 'Brown Ale' or 'Old Ale'?) but I still enjoyed it. Would have another..."
"yet again I am thoroughly satisfied by another brew from smuttynose. they are making a fan outta me."
"Overall this beer is somewhere in between an Old Ale and a Brown Ale. I'm not very familiar with the English Strong Ale so this may be what Smuttynose was going for, but I would've liked a bit more emphasis on the Brown Ale side of things. Still, it's worth a shot."
"This is a decent strong ale but is extremely sweet and one dimensional in that way. It's still very good but definitely a sipper and not a bottle to finish yourself."
"Medium body. Appropriately carbonated. Couldn't really taste any alcohol at all. Definitely a sipper. I'll probably be picking up another bottle to see how it does with some age on it."
"Not quite as drinkable as I had hoped. The aftertaste really puts a damper on things."
"Smuttynose Really Old Brown Dog is a very clear, dense, brown ale with a generous, thick, dense, foamy yellow head that has incredible retention. It smells kind of like a home brew. There are notes of green hops, peppercorns and resiny malt that is just a touch sweet. It is full bodied, thick and syrupy. It has a wooden, resiny malt flavor that's a little sweet and a little bitter. There is almost an umami note. Oak and leather are detected. It's pretty drinkable. This is a solid Old Ale."
"Overall this was a really solid beer. A really solid version of the style."
"This is a great beer, and near spot on for the style in my opinion, certainly a beer I will have over and over again. Tons of flavor and aromas to enjoy, entirely too easy to drink, and completely satisfying to the senses."
"4/4/4/4/3.5"
"Mouthfeel is rich and there is nothing off- putting either with the oak or alcohol. Drinkability is good. This could seem like a good session beer for the unwary. I would imagine that aging would bring out even more flavors."
"Bottle: Poured a clear light brown color ale with a nice size foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fruity ester is quite enjoyable with some light caramel malt. Taste is a nice mix between some fruity ester (peach, apricot) and some caramel malt. Additional notes of dry fruit and more pronounced presence of sweet malt would have made this more enjoyable. Carbonation is good with an average body and no noticeable alcohol."
"Notes from and tasted on: 03/23/09"
"This is a nice beer to have on hand for occasions as special as a weekend."
"An interesting beer... okay more of a review than that. Poured a beautiful ruby red with hues of amber and mahogany as well. The head was barely off-white. Streaks of a yellowish-brown mixed into the bubbles. The nose was completely dominated by notes of bourbon and vanilla and a faint hint of green raisins. The first blush revealed more of the bourbon barrel notes and a smooth finish. The moutfeel was rich and creamy. Not too bad, and I wonder what a little aging would do for it?"
"D: Very interesting and pretty complex for the style. I'm a big fan of Smuttynose and this just shows off their ability to put a distinct spin on a beer style that has been done unremarkably by so many. That said, it's a definite sipper, and I wouldn't call it balanced given its spicy/alcoholic characteristics, but it's very tasty nonetheless."
"Similar to Geary's HSA."
"This poured a clear mahogany with tan head. It smelled like brown sugar and bready yeast and almond, with a bit of whole wheat or fresh barley. It tasted simple at first, but had a lot of suble complexity. Dominant flavors were brown sugar and creamy yeast, but it also had banana and caramelized sugar (crème brulee crust) and fresh barley, along with a bit of cherry, bourbon oak, and alcohol. It was thick with some carbonation, and had a sweet aftertaste with some alcohol warming. Overall this was a very interesting beer, not like a typical old ale, but more like a strong brown ale. It had great body and was fairly easy to drink despite noticeable alcohol. If the subtle complexities of this became more noticeable with age, that would really help round this beer and make it delicious."
"Needs some age I think we all agree. I have a few more bottles that will stay in the cellar for a few years. I finish the bottle so you can say it is drinkable"
"d: Smutty's big beers have been hit or miss for me, but this is a bull's eye. Thanks to both barleywinebrewer and joepais for samples of this. I love this now and I'm really glad I have some to age. I think it will get even better."
"Drinkability suffers a tad from the alcohol, and the bitterness seems a bit green at this point. Stash this one away for a year and it will only get better. As it is, I'm a fan of English strong ales anyway, and this one certainly gets my motor running. Nice beer, and major kudos to Smutty for releasing a fairly under-represented style in their big beer series."
"Because of the oversweetness, the decent carbonation cannot pull the big body's weight. This is by no means a bad beer, it just isn't smuttynose's finest, they come out with beers that are much better than this."
"The beer is very sweet, actually, quite sour. High alcohol content that comes through. I hear that this is better if you sip and savor, but for a first go, it was alright."
"Pours a clear brown that had ruby hues when held to light. Creme head. Nose is a bit hot. Slight fruity sweet tones. Flavor is sweet with woody tones. Comes off a bit hot as well. Muted wood tones it seems now that I ponder it. Kind of chalky a bit. Feel is smooth on liquid and a bit lower on carbonation. This is nice to drink, but I think it needs a good bit of time I develop it's complexities."
"Drinkability: Certainly worth a try. Fairly easy drinking and enjoyable. I hear Smuttynose has since revamped the recipe and even called in some port-soaked oak chips, so I'll try to snag myself up a bottle of that."
"Can't help but compare this to the Ruben & the Jets that i just had. Many similarities...can't speak to R&TJ as an IS or this as a English Strong Ale. This one is lighter in color; a mid-range amber with reddish hues...far less lacing observed. While malty and sweetness are its keynotes, the nose is quite timid. The flavor is really nice. Malty maple and caramel, but none of the cocoa...replace with tangy butterscotch notes. The mouth feel is full bodied and nicely carbonated, the flavors are simple and the taste lingers some, but nothing heavy. Quite a reasonable drinker...especially at 7% ABV. Recommended."
"As a side note, this mellows and becomes nicely less bitey and a bit sweeter as it warms."
"22oz bomber from The Lighthouse in Manchester, Maine. Pours a translucent copper body with virtually no head. Caramel, chocolate, toffee, and raisins dominate the aroma. Raisin and toffee are strong parts of the flavor, with some caramel, citrus, chocolate, maybe hints of a peat like flavor. Full bodied bordering on viscous with moderate carbonation. Definitely a sipper for sure. Overall, a tasty sipper great for a cold winter night like tonight. Good stuff."
"Pours a dark amber, nearly brown color with a large, two finger bubbly off-white head, nice lacing, fairly clear on the first pour. Aroma has a nice spicy attribute, some dark fruits, brown sugar, a bit of earthiness, and very sweet. Taste is very sweet, plenty of brown sugar, loads of caramel, some nuttiness, maple syrup, some dark fruitiness, raisins/grapes, just a touch of chocolate, light bitterness, and some alcohol heat. Mouthfeel is on the high end of medium, nice and creamy, appropriate carbonation. This is a very tasty beer. The sweetness can be a bit cloying, and the alcohol is a little noticeable, but it's very tasty nonetheless. Thanks to Rochefort10nh for giving the chance to try this one!"
"D = I really like this beer but the drinkability is maybe just slightly lower than it could be due to the strength of the flavors and alcohol feel."
"Good beer but not what I had expected. A nice Old Ale for those looking for one that isn't overwhelmingly sweet. Just balanced right enough to make finishing a bomber possible."
"Brew pours to a somewhat cloudy brown color with a nice sized light tan head. Nice lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma consists of roasted and dark malts, burn brown sugar, caramel, fruit (plum, pear?) and a nice alcohol scent, slight wine like smell (?). The flavors here seem to be a little raw in my opinion, seems like they need to settle out a bit as the alcohol flavor seems a little hot. While that flavor seems to be a little hot the rest of the flavors though raw are nice. Roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, plum and raisin seem to come to mind. As I said earlier the alcohol flavor is there and seems to really to be coming out as the brew warms. Nice warming feeling, growing on me as I make my way through this one, it feels like it would be bigger than 7%. I will pick up another one of these and sit on it for a while to see how it does in a year or so."
"Soft mouthfeel and more of that alluring fruity taste that I can't get enough of. Caramel, maple, plums, and fig come together to create an amazing beer. There's only a hint of the alcohol that adds another layer to the malty sweetness, but keeps everything in check from becoming cloying. Not your prototypical old ale, but a great ale nonetheless."
"Flavor is huge, and tasty as well. Tons of malt and woody, alcoholic notes that, again, remind me of whiskey. Also fruity almost like a belgian dubbel. Touch of hop bitterness on the finish. Pretty deep, layered beer. Mouthfeel is quite good, chewy and almost sticky. Carbonation is kept to a good medium-low level. You've got to sip this one. I'm actually surprised it's only 7% abv. Thought it would have been higher. That said, it's absolutely delicious, and this bomber will do me good."
"complaints notwithstanding, an accurate representation of its smaller sibling, bomber from Rick's, Alexandria, VA"
"Let it warm up so that you can really take everything in."
"Pours a clear copper and brown with carb bubble streams and a thin pond head from this bomber bottle into my Trois Pistoles goblet. This is s tough one to get a handle on at first. Subtle sugary sweetness both in the nose and in taste. Nice malty flavor. Some cocoa notes. Slight bittersweetness. Nice full mouthfeel. Overall a bit cloying, even for a guy who likes stuff on the sweet side. A bit too sweet even for me."
"From 22 oz bottle - Pours a very cloudy and ugly dull copper color. Smells boozy and sweet with musty a old attic aroma. First sip is fruity sweet with caramel and plums leading the way. Tons of alcohol hotness prevails and the musty aroma is also noticeable in the flavor."
"While Smuttynose has also brewed some great beers, their Big Bottle series has definitely captured my attention. A hearty 1pt 6oz bottle, this guy pours a dark caramel brown with honey color and a good 1 and a half -2 finger head. A light but rich malt aroma with yeast and a slight lavender floral aroma settles in the nose. The flavor moves towards a bitter hop/sweet malt and is smooth & chewy with plum-like sweet/sour musty fruit undertones. Very drinkable and quite delicious!"
"As the bottle says, age would probably do good things but the sweet fruits are what it is about. For the price tag, great."
"Pours a nice dark chocolate brown color with a thin, foamy beige head. Roasted malty aroma with cocoa/chocolate, sugar and dark fruit notes. Nice choclate malty flavor that is kind of similar to a tootsie roll. Strong chocolate presence along with hints of fig, dark fruit and alcohol. Slightly sweet with a spicy dry finish."
"A good beer, especially if you like sweet caramal. That said, there is a decent hop bitterness that lends some balance to the sweetness. Definitely a sipper."
"Notes: I seriously misjudged this beer the first time I had it (2 or so years ago)! This beer has a lot going on, lots of similarities to oxidized dessert wines (Madeira, tawny/Colheita ports, Oloroso/PX sherries, etc.). I think it's a little disjointed right now, but that it will fall into place in the next 6 months or so. Seriously good."
"D'ability - Definitely a sipper, and a beer than in some ways feels bigger than its ABV rating."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced. not quite as much depth to the malt as i was hoping for, but still tasty."
"In the end, this is a 90% alcohol profile, which is too much for my enjoyment. Still, I feel this beer is worth seeking out as a change from the ordinary."
"This beer is dangerous because it is so tasty and is a somewhat high ABV. But compared to other beers like it (Brown Shugga, India Brown Ale) it is not too bad in the booze department."
"An enjoyable beer, definitely for the malt fans. Complex, along with plenty of roasty malts. Recommended."
"Well the regular Old Brown Dog is definitely one of my favorites in the style so im pretty excited to try this one. ROBD pours a reddish brown copper color with nice clarity and a large and slightly sticky tan head. Rich nose of banana, figs, brown sugar soaked wood, raison and sweet bready malt. Rich in initial profile as well, full body, grainy with sweetness but still i dont find it overpowering or cloying, this beer is BIG and all its malty good is still slightly balanced by a crisp bitterness mid palate. Raisons and lots of em on the finish and into the smokey, sweet caramel malty aftertaste. Good beer, definitely lived up to my expectations, this beer would pair nicely with food, food bigger than this beer that is..."
"D: Overall drinkability is high. The alcohol is warming but very well hid. Overall, this is a great beer by Smuttynose!"
"D: A wonderful brew that has a nice kick. Great ""Big"" version of a brown ale."
"Buy more."
"Pours a nice reddish-brown color, ruby-red highlights when held to light, tan head fades slowly into swirly foamy goodness atop the beer. Smell is massively malty, some caramel and raisin. A little spicy alcohol heat compliments the malt and fruit flavors, really rich flavors. Pretty sticky mouthfeel, lots of lingering spice and bell-warming alcohol. Another kick-ass Smuttynose beer!"
"Had on tap at Track 84 on 1/28/09. Served in a tulip. Poured a translucent garnet color with a tight half inch white head that quickly dissipated into a consistent skim of foam. Nose was spicey, malty, toasted grain and a suggestion of dark fruit. Taste was spicey - lots of nutmeg, with a solid malt backbone and a bit of booze; somewhat reminiscent of a winter warmer, but more well-balanced. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and lively with some acidity. Not at all what I expected, but a great sipper. I really enjoyed savoring this brew. Another great big beer from Smutty."
"Mouthfeel is good. Some good carbonation cleans the palate and keeps sugars from being to cloying. A real drinker, the 22 oz. disappeared really quick for me. Grab this while it lasts. Another winner from this brewery."
"Not bad overall but the alcohol isn't well-hidden. Could be more enjoyable with age and I'd recommend aging it before you consume."
"I didn't get much out of this, I guess I expected a little more punch, but I'm not well versed in English Strong Ales so I will need to revisit the style."
"This beer has a nice feel to it. Nicely carbinated and quite mellow"
"Body is creamy, smooth, and slightly chewy. Creamy palate. Finish suffers from boozy heat."
"I can see why this year's ROBD has gotten the reputation as a malt bomb. I taste malt and peanuts / caramel. Little bit of a banana taste in there too. I also taste a dash of semisweet chocolate. Sweet without being overbearingly so. Has kind of a smokey, a little boozey barrel aged quality about it. Little bit of hop presence for balance with no bitterness, no sharp aftertaste. Smooth all the way through. Could use a little more carbonation to add to the mouthfeel, but that's a small complaint. Overall, a great tasting beer, I can see why the style is described as ""barleywine lite"". I have to confess, I'm eating spicy meatballs with it, and it's doing a great job of punching through the spicyness without being overbearing. Another awesome beer from the Smutty!"
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a 1/4"" offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mellow, crystal malt scent with a slight fruitiness and a touch of warmth. The taste is decent. It has an alcohol filled taste that boasts mostly of pale and crystal malts. It does have some fruit character, but it's hard to put this one down; definately a sipper. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a slow drinker that would best be served at a later date. It's tastes quite young and powerful. The alcohol needs time to mellow out."
"Pours a dark ruby color, very faint head. Aroma smells like the inside of a barrel warehouse of a bourbon distillery, with oak and malts making me feel very intrigued. Bourbon barrel flavors are found in the taste as well, along with some dark fruits. Extremely smooth mouthfeel, with little carbonation. I had high expectations for this beer, and although it was very different from what I was expecting, I was extemely pleased."
"D: Great drinking brown, rich, malty, sweet and a dream going down."
"Dark amber in color with little head to speak of. Almost nonexistent aroma of dark fruit reminiscent of black cherries. The taste is quite extraordinary; strawberries give way to black cherries that cascade down leaving behind an oily slick dark fruit tang aftertaste. Medium bodied and very drinkable for an above average ABV. Alcohol sneaks its head around from behind the fruit at times but never fully reveals itself. Wine-like in character and enjoyable as an after dinner brew. Prelude to poop."
"Strong Ale, shmong ale. Alcohol, burn grain introduction. Oily, aggressive nature. Chocolate is light, spread on bread; with solid booze. Sharp cocoa powdered black tea. Bit winey and fruity. Figs, mollasses, cherry, plum, vodka, blood, and wood. A battle in the belly to keep down after several sessions. Apertif to queaf."
"I felt like this drank a little tougher than 7%. A nice sipper on a cold night."
"It seemed like a while since they had put this beer out, so I was pleased to see it around again. Apparently the recipe has changed this year. Red/light brown color, with a bit of tan lacing. Nose is really big on wood and alcohol, although a hint of fruit lies underneath it all. Caramel sweetness hits the palate first, followed by some bitter hop, then ends on a very boozy, almost acrid note. Mouthfeel is heavy and in your face. I had a tough time getting through this beer. From what I can remember, the 07 bottling was more preferable. Maybe this one needs some age, as the label suggests."
"Notes - Good but not great, pretty tasty"
"This is a little boozy to be exceptionaly drinkable, I had trouble getting through the bomber."
"Solid brew, but I prefer the lower-alcohol incarnation. Grab a bottle while they are around. I imagine this would age VERY well and mellow out over a 6-12 month period. I can just imagine what this would taste like with that slight edge taken off of it. YUM"
"Nice ruby-brown color. Leathery, peat nose. Nutty, sherry-like. Surprisingly this beer is not all that smooth. It's not brash, but the flavor is fairly sharp. None of that rich, velvety stuff. Not much residual sugar. Again, notes of sherry, with a touch of alcohol. This is a nice beer, not something that's going to blow your hair back, but a good, mellow wintertime sipper, with a bit of a kick. Props to Smuttynose, as always."
"D - excellent brew and look forward to the year of big releases by the brewery. worth the effort to find!"
"Very smooth drinking beer, another great release in the Smutty Big Beer Series. I put aside a bottle that I will look forward to drinking next winter. This one is perfect for a very cold New England night with the snow falling."
"M + D: Soft carbonation, fuller body, rather appropriate for the style and the flavours. A nice beer, and another good offering from Smuttynose - particularly in the ""Big Beer Series"" which hasn't really done me wrong yet."
"Poured a deep brown with nice tannish head, good carbonation and a good looking brew. Nose is pretty hot, you can tell this beer has some alcohol to it. Some dried fruits, caramel and even some oak perhaps. Taste is pretty hot from beginning to end. You really taste the alcohol in this brew. Dried fruits, caramel malts and much more. Mouthfeel is noce, warm and very coating on the mouth. Good beer!"
"This is a good effort with a lot going on...I'm guessing a little time may be helpful. Smutty never disappoints!"
"There are some really good flavors in this complex ale. Unfortunately, they are clearly unbalanced due to the alcohol and hop profile's youth. This Really Old Brown Dog needs to lay down for another year. This is one I would love to revisit once it mellows a little more."
"Pours a crystal clear brown color with ruby highlights when held to light. Thin head dissipates quickly. Smells of Brown Sugar, cherries, dark dried fruits, vanilla, some oak or smoke too. Very malty nose very little if any hop presence. Taste is sweet with dark fruits, toffee, sugar, a touch of alcohol and a warming finish. Mouthfeel is creamy/syrupy, body is medium, carbonation is ample. Another great brew from an underrated brewery."
"Good sipper, but drinkability wanes as complexity decreases and bourbon dominates. Would like to cellar some of this to see how it ages."
"Overall: Another awesome brew from smuttynose. An old favorite brought back in even more glory. This is going to be a fantastic beer to cellar and stand the test of several tasty years.... I'm buying even more than a case!"
"Much softer and smoother than I remember it fresh. Seems to have taken on a lovely English nut brown ale persona. Quite delicious. Wish I'd cellared more of this!"
"A very drinkable beer. The smell is definitely the highpoint, but it's good all-around."
"Fruity and sweet dried fig nose. Baked bean with brown sugar taste with some herbal and salty hops. Aftertaste is long and bitter after a sweet, fruity start that dries out quickly. Medium thin mouthfeel that goes well with an alcohol bite and warmth. A sipper, or great with a steak, stew or roast. Give it a try."
"The taste is so different from the nose, it is rough bitter blast of grapefruit, citrus, that gives you a slight sour bite, but is balanced by a caramel, brown sugar, sweetness that finishes slightly boozy and soft on the palate. Excellent sipper."
"Overall not a bad beer at all. I never tried this when it was young. I may or may not pick this up again if I see it. Don't get me wrong- for the style this was pretty good for me, but this is one of those styles that I feel is very hard to nail perfectly."
"Smuttynose has done a good job with this inaugural version. According to the Brewer's Notes, they aren't 100% happy with how it turned out, but I think it turned out pretty well. If brown ales are your favorite style, then Really Old Brown Dog is worth an enthusiastic Two Paw's Up."
"Recommended..."
"D- I think the drinkability is about on par with the abv, a bit less than a session beer but it's nice to enjoy and I could definitely drink multiple glasses."
"Drinkability: Now that this has had a chance to settle down (a number of posters said it was unbalanced when freshly bottled), it is drinking very nicely; quite different and a solid achievement"
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy brown color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, which leaves some small islands and sticky lacing. The nose is malty, vanilla, toffe, roasted nuts, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, nice roasty tones, toffee/caramel. The alcohol is basically non-existent. Medium body. Very drinkable, this brew goes down very smooth, another awesome brew from Smuttynose, thanks Joe."
"Drank lite and easy, I could do a few of these winner bombers."
"I am not certain if I liked this more now or when it was fresh but regardless, it is delicious. Would like to see more of this..."
"Very clear and reddish brown, the chucky, light tan foam was very longlasting and formed thick lacing. Aromas of brown sugar, cocoa, dark chocolate, bread crust, toffe and faint alcohol. Low bitterness with lots of malty sweetness. Faint hop leaf with alcohol throughout and a toffee aftertaste. Medium bodied and average carbonation with some warmth and a decent texture. Although it didn't quite come together for me the way it should, it was still enjoyable and had some nice malt presence."
"Nicely constructed. I think the six months in the basement helped to mellow things out. If you find it around, I'd recommend a try."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is an enjoyable and flavorful beer. The only downfall is that it isn't memorable. This is another gem from Smuttynose."
"I certainly would be happy to have it again."
"Overall, it's good, but it's really close to Old Brown Dog. Although it's bottle conditioned, I couldn't really tell, but there was a little bit of sticky yeast left in the bottle. Maybe this one is best if the dog is laid down to rest!"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, I’m not so sure this is a good representation of the Old Ale style, but it is certainly an excellent English-Brown-Ale-to-the-second-power. Like almost all of the beers that I’ve had from Smuttynose Brewing Co., this is a good beer to drink for an evening whether it’s sipping slowly or pounding down."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and has a fairly low carbonation making this pretty smooth, and helps give this a good drinkability."
"I think OBD is a great beer, this on the other hand - not so much. It looked like a brown ale, but upon tasting, it turns into a bad brown/barleywine hybrid. And that says a lot if it's only 7% abv. There were some cocoa-like malts trying to blend with sweeter, fruitier malts and it just didn't work. Poor balance here. No good."
"Pours a clear red/brown, thin tan head, nice lacing, leaves a solid ring around the glass. Smell is sweet and malty, bit of toffee, very fruity, alcohol is present, bready malt. Taste is toffee, some chocolate, quite rich, roasty bitter finish, some alcohol, bread, nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, warms as it goes down. Not bad, neat shot at a lighter old ale. Thanks Stan!"
"good brew. not their best"
"This is one tasty beer that hides its 7% alcohol very well."
"I think that the taste was overwhelmed by alcohol, which isn't really acceptable in a 7% ale, in my opinion. There were all of those malty flavors present, with a bit of a dark berry thing as well, but the finish was too boozy for me to appreciate it. Sorry to say (as I rather like the regular OBD, and I love SN in general, as well as the beautiful label), I think this is the least of the Big Beer Series that I've tried (S'muttonator, Wheat Wine, Farmhouse). Regardless, thanks Franchise for hooking me up with this!"
"Random, somewhat copper color. White, lacey head on top. Malty, somewhat sharp and lactic aroma. Decent enough malty flavor. Slightly robust with a faint alcohol twinge. Tastes like an amped up version of their regular brown though out of balance. Ok mouthfeel. Rather ho hum overall for me. I was expecting more to tell you the truth. All their big beer series beers I have had have been great-this one lacks a lot."
"Recommended"
"Bottom line: I'm very impressed with this Old Ale offering from Smuttynose and can easily recommend it. See it? Buy it and sip on it. Thanks again Joe!!"
"Quite a tasty beer now, I dont think this is one that I would age, not much would change IMO and it is very good now!"
"A good, enjoyable Old Ale. Not the best I've had, but very nice. I especially liked how it opened up with some air & temperature, and found it to be much more enjoyable & more like an Old Ale once it did so. Some sharp white cheddar would have been perfect with this, as well as anything nutty (perhaps a praline?). Just like Olive, the Really Old Brown Dog on the label, this hit its stride with some good ol' time. Be patient, let it warm up to room temps, and enjoy."
"This was pretty good stuff overall. I'd tone down the alcohol presence s bit to make this a bit more drinkable and balance out the flavour a bit more, which could make this one a really good brew. That said, it's still good in it's own right. Also, I can't not mention (even though it's got nothing to do with the contents of the bottle) the truly awesome label for this one. It's a simple, classy tribute to the great (and now late) Smutty mascot and is simply one of the best beer labels I've ever seen."
"Overall: This isn't an unpleasant beer to drink, but it doesn't quite fit the style."
"This was NOT an appetizing looking beer when served; kind of muddy brown looking. It's possible it was the tail end of the keg. There was a nice head that went to a ring in a bit. It smelled ok, lots of malt; nothing huge. What I liked about this beer was the balanced flavor that stayed right through to the finish. There was a pretty decent malt flavor to it. I rather liked this beer although I don't have much experieince with the style."
"It's quite nice on a quiet night on the back porch, or sipping by the fire with a good book, but I'd imagine it's drinkability would be limited in the pub setting. But at 7%, that's to be expected. I'd imagine it would pair well with a variety of foods, but glazed yams come to mind, as does, oddly enough, maple-syrup covered pancakes with a link or two of nicely browned sausage. Enjoyable. Worth trying!"
"D - Better than old brown dog, but not by much. I don't think I will have again. Pretty easy to drink though."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the slightly cloudy orangey copper brew. Head recedes at a slow to moderate pace, with ample lace. Aroma is malt sweetness, with touches of chocolate. Taste is surprisingly light on the grains upfront, fruity in the middle, and comes on a bit hoppy at the close. After swallow is when the warm really starts up. Mouthfeel is oddly thin-seeming, and drinkability is reasonable, but the afterburn might slow you down. Have to agree with some others, a bit of age would probably do this one good."
"$4.99 for a 22 ounce bomber, the front of label lets you know this brew was ""Bottle conditioned in 2007"" certaintly a good bit of info as this one most likely was designed to be put away in a cool dark place for a few. Pours medium almond amber, moderate haze, cloudyness and sits under a tightly knit light tan head, that leaves nice, fine and scattered lacing. Allowed to warm up abit the nose is of some raisins, light alcohol and warm toast. Pleasant malty brew, more raisins, whole wheat toast, vanilla and a slight bite of mellow alcohol. Pleasant sipper, nicely crafted and smooth on the tongue. Well worth a try, if I had the space and the will power I'd put some bottles of this away for a few years...its drinking quite nicely right now..."
"D: Right now? Not much, but I bet in about 1 year this beer will be tremendous."
"Mouthfeel is a light/medium body and oes down very smoothly. In fact maybe a little too smooth. Even though it's not the highest ABV Old Ale I've had, it went down quick and the alcohol cought up to me."
"drinkability - Not a bad beer, wish it didn't have the hop bitterness at the end. Took me bit to finish this one off."
"Pours a nice burnt sienna color with a hefty, light, billowy head (tan) that clings to the glass. Aroma is mainly of some caramel brown malts along with some slight almonds and chocolate. A bit of floral hops hits my nose as well but mainly malt. Sipping reveals a nice, robust mocha maltiness that almost reminds me of a porter. However, the body is a bit fuller (medium) with some nice caramel tones throughout the sip. A bit of alcohol also hits my tongue numbing it on the tip just a bit, while the finish is dry and a bit bitter. Very smooth aside from the alcohol tingle. I didn't drink this at a very cold temp (probably 58 degrees F), but very enjoyable. This will help my Hold 'Em skills! Okay, maybe not, but very nice offering!"
"Pours a two-fingered light tan head that slowly fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Nice deep, clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet caramel nose. Flavor is sweet caramel but hops balance. Lingering bitter aftertaste. $3.99 for a 22 oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"Overall- A sweet and strong (alcohol taste) beer. Let this sit in your cellar until it matures. Not bad but seems"
"The recipe has been pumped up for this year it's acually much bigger than the '07 version. This one is much bolder, huge malt verging on an English Barleywine but slightly more refined. bolder flavor's and feel makes this a killer brew."
"Sweet malt--molasses and caramel with a nice subtle infusion of cocoa. Burnt sugar notes also linger on the palate. Malt profile is well balanced with all flavors having equal air time. Spicy sensation after the malt blast. Leafy hop presence left on the tongue in the aftertaste. Dryer finish is spurred on by a carbonation blast. Mouthfeel could be a bit more smooth and creamy, but unfortunately the carbonation is a bit too much. A very nice tasting brew with a lot of malt flavor. Definitely worth a try, as all Smuttynose brews are."
"Very smooth mouthfeel and very drinkable. Not as strong as some old ales I've had, but much more balanced and approachable. A very solid beer."
"A 22oz bomber. Very pretty beer: red/brown in color, with a thick coffee-colored head that retains well. Malty/grainy aroma, with a background of dark fruit. Intensely malty taste up front, followed by the dark fruit. Maybe even a slight chocolate taste at the end. Alcohol is noticeable but not intrusive. Very smooth, very drinkable. Gotta get more of these."
"Pours a clear deep mahogony with a medium tan foamy head. The head lasts and leaves decent lacing. The smell is pungent with sweet malt and a strong ""bisquity' aroma. The taste is interesting with the alcohol really standing out. The flavors are almost porter/like with coffee,sweet malt,carmel,and a smoked wood flavor. The m/f is medium with the flavors not mixing all that well and making this abit harsh. Not a bad beer,and I like that Smuttynose tries different things,but this really is average,although aging may help. Cheers."
"Unbalanced malts dominate, with a slight hop-bitter finish. Not sure where the brewer was trying to go with this one; being that it is bottle condition, and relatively high ABV, I am interested to see how it ages."
"RIP Olive"
"I recommend trying this one."
"Right now, it's just ok."
"978"
"D - It's smooth and tastes good, just not something I'd tell everyone to run out and hunt for. After drinking most of the 22oz bottle you definitely start to feel the alcohol level. Overall, it's a fair offering. Almost seems like it'd be better suited in their regular rotation instead of it's ""Big Beer"" designation."
"Drinkability: It's not bad, but it's just not going to be able to hold my interest to the point that would make me go back for more."
"Drinkability: this is a heavier and meatier brown ale that is outside normal session ranges, but this was quite easy to drink. Overall this was very enjoyable."
"I don't know what to make of this beer. It tastes just like a brown ale, but then all of a sudden you're hit with a massive amount of hot alcohol. I'm going to lay a few of these down, and revisit in a year or so. It's not undrinkable now, but I'm sure it could be much better. Hopefully time will temper the out of control alcohol."
"No matter how old it is, this dog can hunt. The dense malt presence lends a mature air to the overall character, leaving a tasty mix of old and scotch ales. Despite a muted but credible ABV it's an easily drinkable malt-fest. No, it doesn't soar among the clouds, but it's salt of the earth, and that makes it one of man's better friends."
"Easy drinking, esp. for the style. Yummy! An old ale/brown ale mix. Nice."
"nice drinking, smooth, perhaps not as complex as some old ales... interesting to lay this one down and see where it goes... definitely worth checking out."
"D: The higher alcohol (I don't know the abv, but it is higher) makes for a tough drink. The strong malts are enjoyable though, imparting a strong cereal flavor."
