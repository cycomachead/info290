"Strong, malty aroma has a firm overtone of cocoa - almost smells more like hot cocoa than like beer. Hey, I love chocolate! Pours a clear sepia with a nice fluffy and fine-bubbled wheat head. Malty flavor has a strong cocoa overtone, which I found rather enjoyable. I detected hints of apple and caramel as well. Texture has firm body and good fizz, leaving a malty and chocolaty finish. This is a good beer for the fall, when the leaves are turning and it’s time to break out the down comforter."
"Incredible. I loved this beer."

"Somewhat disappointing entry that I was hoping would be a nice, dessert-like beer. I think a chocolate version of the Old Tom would be a nice beer, but they need to beef these up with more malt, more body, and more flavor. Twenty years ago the British would have been busting our chops for selling watery beers. Looks like the shoe's on the other foot now, Winston! Get it together, will ya?"

"330ml old shape bottle. Snifter glass. Slight winey & fudge chocolate aromas as cap is removed. Pours mahogany in color, cloudy appearance. Beige foam, close crown, nice retention. Roasted, herbal, brown sugar, chocolate & toffee aromas. Crispy upfront, roasted & black cocoa flavors. Medium body. Moderately high carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Slight licorice hints & herbal notes resolves in a long bitter/sweet finish. Chocolate tones on the aftertaste. Smooth drinkability."

"Poured from 330 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted June 2014."

"O: Good drinkability. Nice British Ale"

"a variation on the classic old tom, i like this chocolate version for two reasons. the first is its lower alcohol lends to easy drinking. i could have many of these without losing my cool, which counts for a lot with a winter beer like this one. second, its not the least bit sweet, and is in fact shockingly dry, which also lends to greater drinkability and is a marked departure from the other chocolate ales out there. as an old ale, its less than remarkable though, not as malt driven or full bodied as it could be, but with the chocolate it just works. good toast to it all, bakers chocolate meets milk chocolate without the sugar, and the carbonation is light but the beer froths up nicely on the palate. a well refined brew, steeped in tradition yet modernized in a very appropriate way. something quite unique, fairly priced, and outstanding in winter weather."

"Overall - I'm not completely sold on this beer. Its quirky flavor might have worked, but the uber thin body undercuts any potential. There's a bottling code of L1312, which I assume is a date of December '13. Based on web gathered info from the net, this is a best before date, and Old Tom has an 18-month freshness window. If my assumptions are correct, this beer could be nearly 2 years old. This might account for the weak and lifeless mouthfeel. If so, my main hesitation toward buying imports is yet again reaffirmed."

"Overall a disappointment. Tastes mildly like chocolate and has no alcohol taste to it. Might not actually technically be beer."
"O - 3.5 - Meh. its not that great. Pretty smooth, but not much else,"
"Dark brown color is topped with a small off-white head. Initially the aroma is nothing but a strong alcohol smell - disappointed. But after letting it breath for some moments, you get an amazing dominant chocolate aroma (similar to chocoltae liqueur). Taste is sweet, chocolatey and pleasanty roasted. Finish is slightly hoppy, but otherwise neutral. After some time the bitter aftertaste kicks in, and rounds this beer."

"O- over all really good beer would defiantly drink again"

"A well balanced, tasty ale that is perfect with, or as, a dessert and great to have anytime of the day"

"A pretty good brew, easy drinking and tasty. Nice change to American hoppy beers."

"There's the minerals, coming on strong in the flavor along with the same cocoa-dusted vanilla yogurt I was getting in the nose...cola even. Interesting, but it is not really chocolaty or much of an Old Ale. It is, however, a tasty beverage. Mouthfeel is less than medium, especially for the style and lacks any sort of sweetness, which is kinda expected for a Chocolate Ale or Old Ale. I like it well enough, but I am not feeling compelled to go out an buy another."
"Food match: Old Tom, the cat, roasted and served with a chocolate sauce."

"11.2 OZ BOTTLE. Pours dark amber with creamy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of bread crust, chocolate and ripe fruit. Body is full and crisp. Taste is of cacao, milk chocolate, earthy hops and bready malt. Finish is long, semi-dry. Nice, balanced brew with just right amount of chocolate."
"330 ml. bottle. Pours a decent head, that doesn't linger much. Amber colour, with beatiful shades of red and orange to the light. I really can't find chocolate in the aroma, which is alcoholic, like a liquor, with aratificial vanilla and fruits. Medium body, thin palate. Taste is like a medical syrup, with chocolate, and fruits. It doesn't seem to work for me..."

"Taste is lightly winy fruitiness up front, then some chocolate, light woody-tea-like bitterness at finish. It is lively, engaging, fruity-and slightly woody ale with a hint of chocolate."

"O - a full on ale that is quite moorish - beware quaffing it though as it will have you on your back. A good ale here."
"Going from Old to Chocolate, 'cause why the hell not? This stuff pours a deep garnet-brown topped by over a finger of dusky tan foam. The nose comprises cocoa, molasses, light clove, light cinnamon, light roasted malts, light oak, and a touch of black tea. Things are a bit more ephemeral than the Old Tom, though thankfully still quite pleasant. The taste brings in more of the same, with the emphasis decidedly on the cocoa, which now takes on a powdery character. There's also a slightly deeper roast, a pinch of black pepper, and a hint of dark fruits way in the background. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice beer, one that shows you can go crazy with chocolate without overdoing it or completely overshadowing every other flavor."
"The 6% alcohol content was completely hidden. Very interesting beer, and amazingly drinkable once flavours matched perfectly."

"Interesting and quite drinkable. The chocolate character is quite distinct; it smells almost like a bar of milk chocolate. It's an odd brew - the chocolate and strong ale flavours don't entirely blend or complement each other, yet it seems to work nonetheless. It's different from every other chocolate beer I've tried; the usual pairing is dark roasted malt and chocolate, which results in a deep bitterness that is absent here. It's not as good as the original Old Tom, but goes down nicely. To summarise: unusual but tasty. Worth trying if you come across it."

"O - Interesting beer, hitting all the right notes. Not one to knock your socks off, but hard to find any flaws. If you are looking for a chocolate bomb, this one isn't for you, but a great beer nonetheless."
"A chocolate beer can be a hit or miss, but I think that the folks working on Chocolate Tom have done a commmendable job with this beer. It's got chocolate, not too much and not too little. All you chocoholics should get your hands on a bottle."

"Pours two finger khaki head that fades quickly to a ring, leaving some lace. Deep clear mahogany color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Chocolate nose and flavor is sweet and baked chocolate. $4.99 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
"Over all, it's an average English ale. Wish they'd have done a better job with the chocolate."
"Overall this was a nice subtle, simple yet tasty offering from a brewery across the pond that I am not too familiar with. Chocolate flavors are nice and subtle and balance the base beer quite well. I wish for my money that this beer had a bit more of a punch in flavor and mouthfeel. More of a strong Mild ale or an English brown by American standards than an Old Ale but definitely something I enjoyed. Because of the elevated $ tag though, I probably wont revisit anytime soon because Fullers makes tastier examples with their 1785 and Vintage ale."
"Body feels watery."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink; the addition of chocolate and relatively low alcohol content might make this style a little more palatable to novice craft beer drinkers. I wouldn’t mind having this as an after dinner drink or pairing it with a dessert."
"Poured into a Black Raven imperial pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber. Half finger fine off-white head that dissipates to a ring with slight lacing. Interesting aroma of chocolate and faint light fruit. Pleasant. Light to medium bodied. Flavor is dominated by chocolate with a light base of toasted and sweet malt and faint nondescript sweet fruit. Finish is dry bittersweet chocolate a bit abrupt, but leaves a lingering cocoa memory. The flavor combination is well done. I'd like a bit more malt in an old ale, but this was satisfying and interesting. I will definitely revisit this."
"Pours light brown/dark amber beer with good tan head, leaving some nice laces. Rather specific aroma: sour with vinegar & metallic tones. And pleasant cocoa nose. The taste is plain and, I daresay, close to dark lager - roasted malts & moderate chocolate tones. Low carbonation and slightly bitter aftertaste. All in all, it's an example of average beer."

"Better than I thought it would be though. But that's not saying much."
"Pours a clear amber hue which leaves a two finger creamy head and sporadic lacing,the smell is cocoa,dark chocolate eclairs,caramel and nutcake,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and could be thicker with tastes of sweet honey roasted peanuts,caramel,chocolate eclairs,fruit and nut cake and finished with a toffee barley sweetness and overall i enjoyed this and am annoyed i only bought the one of but i will be going back to my favcourite bottlo and buying more thats for sure a nice balance between chocolate and beer for me cheers."
"Overall: Not a bad beer, but for me the chocolate tastes like cheap chocolate bars were added after brewing"
"Different and well made, good carbonisation and throughly enjoyable. Really for a winters night, but equally as good as a summer nightcap."
"i like it chilled in the sun"
"Smooth and rich, and still drinkable at 6%."
"This feels lively with much active carbonation, as well as slight oiliness and a warm finish."
"Drinkability: I am a massive fan of Robinson's Old Tom but for me this just doesn't work as well as the original. The flavour are a bit too sweet and sickly, and this really hinders the drinkability. A good idea but for me the original is still the best."
"Darkbrown/redish colour. Heavy chocolate smell and also some sweetness. The choclate taste is profund and a lot more than usually in choclate beers. Probably due to the use of real chocolate in the brew. I also felt a slight touch of marsipan. It's probably great with sweet chocolate rich desserts. I fine pretty smooth British beer."
"Pours a clear dark reddish orange, almost brown, decently thick off white head forms, no real lacing, settles to a thin ring. Smell is interesting, malt balls, chocolate milk, vanilla, some caramel and raisin, slightly fake chocolate, not bad though. Taste is similar, nice vanilla character, chocolate milk, caramel, raisin, some sweetness, dark fruitiness, not bad. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Half decent but didn't do much for me, chocolate came across as pretty artificial, but I did like the vanilla. Thanks Rob!"
"Harmless enough, but the chocolate didn't really work for me as well as I know it can. Still a pleasant drink though."
"Overall a nice beer but I still enjoyed the Ginger Tom quite a bit more. Cheers"
"Overall - A decent enough brew and much better than i expected.. worth a try..."
"Saw this one on the shelf at a local beer store in northern Italy. The beer pours a clear but very dark brown color. The head is wispy and fairly thin. What's really remarkable about the beer is it's aroma...it's an intense mix of both vanilla and chocolate. At times one or the other seem to dominate, but they are the cornerstone scents of this beer. The chocolate is reminiscent of sweet, fine, chocolate powder (think an up-market version of nestle quick). Following the primary scents, there is a little toasted malt character, and very little (almost no) hop smells. The flavor is interesting...the same qualities that are present in the smell, but significantly muted. The beer is not nearly as sweet the aroma telegraphed. Lots of malt flavor, which pair nicely with the chocolate. The beer dries out by the finish, which does have a firm bitterness for balance. It's not the kind of beer that I'd have more than one at a sitting, but it is worth a try."
"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.0%. Mahogany coloured beer with a thick off-white to beige head. Strong and dominant sweetish aroma of chocolate and vanilla, not unpleasant, but pretty close ... The flavour has loads of cocoa and vanilla, on a malty base with some vinous notes, but the beer is not nearly as sweet as the aroma made me fear. There are some moderate hops in the finish. This is a nice change-of-pace beer, but I would normally prefer the ""ordinary"" Old Tom."
