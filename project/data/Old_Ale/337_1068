The hops give it a pine and citrus taste. A hint of malt is also present. Overall taste is great. Somehow, the brewers at Saint Arnold have actually captured Christmas in a bottle.","Myotus","Jan 28, 2015"

However, at the same time, had it been sold consistently at $8+ per six-pack, I probably would not have swooped in for seconds, much less more.","OrestesMethuon","Jan 21, 2015"

The beer smells of toffee and chocolate. There are some floral notes as well from the hops. What hits the tongue is a big malt presence with toffee and chocolate. The alcohol comes through in the taste as do the hops, which bring some floral, earthy, and mild spice notes to the taste. The body is medium to full with strong carbonation. This leads to a cleaner than expected finish. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Dec 03, 2012"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Considering there isn't much of a ""winter"" in the region of South Texas, it's nice to see a fresh offering from a nearby brewery in the Winter Warmer category. Into a brandy glass, this pours a clear and glimmering amber red color. Aroma is a lush one of candied sweet roasted malt and fragrant bright fruit. A robust yet crisp and refreshing body sweeps over the palate into a dry and warming finish with notes of mild cinnamon and roasted sugar.

The medium body is crisp and peppery on the palate, with an uppity carbonation level that livens up the mouthfeel. Overall, Saint Arnold's Christmas Ale delivers on what it promises--a solid beer to accompany the mildly chilly winter nights in Texas.

Smells mildly of some spice (yeast spiciness, not literal spice -I don't think they added anything to it), a sweet caramel-like something, and piney hops. Theres a piney, sticky hop flavor when you first sip it followed by some big malty sweetness. There is, as is typical for a winter warmer, there's a good amount of hop bitterness in the finish. At seven percent this isn't the biggest warmer around, but you can definitely feel it.

3.89,5.1,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Christmas in July! This Christmas Ale seems to take a slightly different tack than many. It has a reddish brown hue with little head that eventually disappears. The aroma is heavily accentuated with spruce and spice (primarily nutmeg and allspice) and these flavours dominate the palate too. The beer also has some slight hops to the finish. A good beer, but I think it makes a better drink during the winter.","Atricapilla","Feb 20, 2007"

The smell is bready and light. The taste however lacks character but I find to be very accessable and creamy. This is a Christmas Ale that would be greatly enhanced with more spice or citrus, but is an excellent beer to have at the house when guests are over and anyone could cozy up to.","brandoneast","Jan 14, 2007"

The smell is promising but unfortunately the taste doesn't quite deliver. I expect a little more out of a seasonal ale such as this. It definitely has a little bit of spice one should find in the style but not enough. Too much of the pervasive caramel, slickness off the tongue that one gets from St. Arnold's beers.

I want to say I can smell spices and definitely the malt - not much for hop, which is good here. Goes down smooth and creamy, better than most christmas ales.

Maybe when the humidity drops below 100% it's considered winter in Houston. Anyway, I'm glad this beer was available. It was a reddish/brown color with a medium off-white head.

4.05,9.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark orange or reddish brown with an off white head. Initally 1.5"" head the quickly recedes to a ring and a thin film on top. Aroma is malty sweetness and fruits. The malty sweetness is the dominant flavor, hop bitterness and alcohol balance it out. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Because of the sweetness and high alcohol, this wouldn't make a good session beer, one is enough. This is probably my favorite of Saint Arnold's beers.","Dizzy","Jun 10, 2006"
2.9,-21.6,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Ok, this beer is incredibly sweet, almost puckeringly so. There is an intense raspberry tartness that sits on the tongue while other sugars creep up to ""fuel the fire."" A light chocolate flavor in the finish is there to tug the reigns and tame this beast. The mouthfeel is interesting, because it feels like I'm taking a bite of a really rich dessert chocolate. Something so rich that it's good in small doses, but 12 ounces is a little too much for me.","jwff","Mar 10, 2006"
3.5,-5.4,4,4,3.5,3,3,"The beer has a nice heft to it as it rests on the palate. Not too heavy, but enough that the beer sticks just a bit to the mouth. The beer is not nearly as malty sweet as I would have guessed from the aroma, instead it has a rich maltiness to it that while not sweet is fairly substantial. In the finish is a nice, though light, herbal bitterness and a lingering suggestion of toasted malt. Solid notes of toffee and caramel combine with a hint of oxidation; all of which contribute to the nice malt character of this beer. Despite the heft of this beer it seem a bit thin, it just seems to disappear from my tastebuds faster than I would expect. Something just seems to be missing here, for some reason I am expecting a richness to this brew that is just not here. It is enjoyable though, and I definitely would not turn down another go at this beer.","Gueuzedude","Feb 19, 2006"

Head is light brown and has good retention. The aroma is of sweet, dark malts with hints of coffee. Taste has a full-on sweet, roasted malt flavor. Coffee and chocolate flavors play a big part in this beer. Roast flavor is also in the mix. The finish has a strong malt flavor with touches of dark fruit and just a hint of alcohol. This aged version is notably better than the bottled version I remember from last year, the flavor is much fuller and nuanced.
