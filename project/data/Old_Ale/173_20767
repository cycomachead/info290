Body is quite full with almost zero carbonation. This is almost like drinking an old sherry or xeres and makes for a perfect nightcap.","Phyl21ca","Nov 05, 2014"

I think the lack of carbonation is what gives the impression that the beer is sweet since there are no scrubbing bubbles to clean the palate. I love the aroma, enjoy the flavors, and would be ecstatic to have this around all the time. I still think I prefer Cherry Adam though.","MarcWP","Jul 15, 2014"

Also, the flavors are potent and varied, but not to the degree that I'd like. Don't get me wrong, this is a really good beer. But, IMO, it's not on the level (at least at 2 years) of many of my favorites. HotD Matt, for example, has much better barrel integration and is just a much better beer.

No matter, Adam from the Wood is fantastic, and I need to keep my hunting spears ready when the next batch is (hopefully) released.","tectactoe","Jul 16, 2013"

The aroma holds coconut/vanilla from the wood, dark chocolate, dark bread, earth, tobacco, wet leather, soy, figs, prunes, raisins, and a touch of old hops reminiscent of the regular Adam old ale. Robust and oxidized nose. The flavor is medium sweet, medium bitter and light acidic with notes of vanilla, coconut, wood, caramel, dark sugar, dark fruits, leather, tobacco, earth, dark bread, chocolate, earthy licorice, light citrus and a touch of soy. The mouthfeel is rounding, soft and sticky with a light carbonation. Vinous and complex finish. Medium-bodied. Overall, a very nice old ale. Didn’t blow anything out of the water for me.

It looks perfect and the creamy head stayed for the entirety of the beer. The nose is smooth and creamy. I get a lot of dark fruit and cola along with vanilla and cream. It smells like the perfect old ale. The flavors are ridiculous. It's plenty malty with just a touch of bourbon. There is smooth cream and vanilla with some figs. It's really interesting and complex. It drinks light and velvety, so smooth. I really like it although I prefer Old Stock Bourbon and Bourbon Barrel Fourth Dementia to it by far. The difference is the amount of bourbon. This tastes like it is aged, since it is, and is a few years old and I would assume it has mellowed out a tad. I'd would love to try this at year two from the barrel.","aasher","Jun 01, 2012"

Mouth is very creamy, rich, alcohol heat throughout, lots of dripping dark fruits in brandy, bourbon, brine and leather in the mid palate, with a pleasantly hot finish. Takes the edgy qualities of a 2 year old Adam and just adds dimensions of complexity.

The signature leather and tobacco aroma of Adam is still present, along with vanilla, light nuttiness, smoke and somewhat brash but not unwelcome alcohol. The palate is warming and sweet, bourbon at the forefront with plenty of oak, tannin, vanilla and caramel. Lightly oxidized, still surprisingly hot despite all the years in the barrel. The earthiness of Adam shines through past the big barrel flavors, contributing leather and tobacco, dark fruit, subtle smoke. The body is medium-full; it feels a bit more hefty than the non-barreled Adam. A fantastic beer overall, though it may benefit from some time in the bottle to tame the heat.","largadeer","Jan 10, 2012"

4.69,4,4,5,5,4.5,4,"Murky, swampy brown, with no head at all. Honestly, it didn't look particularly appetizing, but to convey the overall awesomeness of this brewski, I have to give it a higher score.Pretty light aroma, consisting mostly of port-like dark malt, tons of sherry steeped fruit, vanilla, and oak-soaked creamines. Smells like it's been waiting for me to sip, and waiting patiently. The flavor follows suit, with malt engraved into wooden slats, absolutely soaked in vanilla-like oak. No ""barrel"" feel, just straight oak and all its creamy wildness. Powerful roastiness. Minimal, if any, carbonation. The barest sparkle on the swallow. Pretty much flat. If you like cask ale, this is great. If not, this might not qualify as beer to you. Huge, thick body with a coating, lasting mouthfeel. The juicy malt flavor lingers forever. Hops leave trace residue of earthiness, but contribute no bitterness at this point. Finishes molasses-like and hugely biting in its sweetness. Very sweet, so much so that it's reserved for true beer aficionados only. Many people at the gathering could hardly manage three or four ounces of the stiff. More for the rest of us!!! I certainly indulged, and enjoyed every sip. Adam should always be kept in the wood. Imprison that evil bastard.","UnionMade","0"
