Pours a barely translucent warm dark woody brown with a fairly thick tan head. Flavor just says "autumn" with roast malt and earth tones plus a hint of cloves. It’s almost like drinking the very essence of autumn. Smooth texture has decent body and fizz. An excellent brew to celebrate fall.","Cyberkedi","Jan 05, 2015"

3.75,5,,,,,,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and while I didn't think this was really that true to style for an Old Ale it seemed more in line with a Brown Ale or Altbier, but either way it lived up to being a fitting a beer for the season.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, creamy, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention. I could see myself drinking a couple of these and I think it would make for a nice beer to bring to a bonfire.  What I like the most about this beer was the nutty aspect, it really worked well with the malty flavors and it showed up at just the right amount.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change.  I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes an easy drinking beer that's malty and nutty.  All in all I was happy with this beer , it being classified as an Old Ale on here is a little confusing, but once I looked past that I was left with a nice fall time beer.  This is one of the better beers that I've had from this Brewery and It's one of the better Fall seasonal s that I've had this year.  Good job guys, I enjoyed this beer, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Sep 15, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a small fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, raisin, plum, pear, biscuit, toast, chocolate, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, brown sugar, raisin, plum, pear, biscuit, toast, light chocolate, herbal, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, plum, raisin, pear, biscuit, toast, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Minimal carbonation and medium bodied; with a very slick, moderately creamy, and fairly bready mouthfeel that is ok. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a decent old ale. Good balance and robustness of malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and smooth to sip on for the abv. Could use more carbonation. Pleasantly enjoyable.","superspak","Feb 22, 2014"

The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer.

Full-flavored while not being overwhelming, it smoothly fades out a little while after the sip. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and fairly smooth, and the drinkability is great. Overall, this is an excellent beer that does a great job of balancing drinkability and flavor.

It's pretty light bodied; kind of watery but the finish is kind of creamy. There is a lot of resiny malt in the taste, but it never gets sweet. Dark bread crust, medicine and maybe even licorice are in there. The aftertaste is pretty long and pretty bitter. Wow, this is like a light version of an imperial stout. What is this, a brown ale?

The flavor starts with the smoke, and then the malt dominates throughout. The finish is somewhat harsh on the palette, the malt and a subtle sweet sticks around through the aftertaste.

With so many pumpkin offerings and obnoxious orange labels, it can be overwhelming. This, though, is a good start. While perhaps not the best out there, it’s a very calm beer. It’s in no way gimmicky, nor is it reaching for a style outside the brewery’s comfort zone. A solid beer.","paperbackfoster","Sep 24, 2011"

I keep hoping one of their beers will hit the spot, but really I haven't found one yet with the possible exception of the 471 IPA. This one pours a very dark brown, but with just the faintest head. Fairly roasty in the nose with a hint of cocoa powder, and some gentle malt. A little thin in flavor, especially upfront, but the finish delivers some more of that same moderate roastiness and dusty cocoa. Not a lot of depth, but pleasant enough, I guess. Also relatively gentle in the mouth with a soft finish. Certainly drinkable, but not moreish.","Georgiabeer","Sep 24, 2011"

Nice, robust late fall offering for when the early fall crispness of Octoberfests give way.","hylton44","Nov 08, 2007"

Finish has a lenient acidity, the hops apparent, but not over powering, sweet dry aftertaste lingers long on the palate, a nice looking, aromatic and drinkable beer, over the past few years Breckenridge has improved its quality immensely.","Gusler","Oct 30, 2007"

The nose had a big malty-sweet presence. The mouthfeel was medium to full and I got a really unexpected smokiness on the tongue.

3.93,10.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"So, is Autumn-Warmer going to be an upcomming catagory? It's not quite a harvest ale because of the moderate hopping (not highly hopped). Not quite a winter warmer (not spicy or the right season). What the beer is, is a really nice non-Oktoberfest Fall-type beer. Quite reminescent of Scottish ales, but light on the peat-smoked malts, but on target with the deep malt profile, toffee / cocoa hints, and moderately high malty texture. Medium hops certainly off-set the sweetness, while adding a mild grassy, piney flavor. Fermentation spices and lactose-like sweetness add character and smoothness. Lingers with a hint of toasty sweetness and hop bittering. Another high quality, well balanced brew from Breckenridge.","BEERchitect","Sep 16, 2007"

It doesn't remind me of Autumn and it isn't much of an old ale. What's left? A crazy patchwork of a beer that doesn't fit comfortably into any one style, but that is, nevertheless, drinkable in a 'low expectations' kind of way.

Aromas of slightly roasty malts, spices, light floral hops, and malty sweetness abound. Body is kinda weird as the carbonation is low but it finishes rather dry. Flavor is remeniscent of most winter ales with a medium brown type roastiness and some spicy finish.

Although this is not labeled as Oktoberfest, I was expecting it to be. As soon as I poured it, though, I knew it wasn't. Deep, dark mahogany color and commanding malt aroma. I love the uniqueness of this brew, with slightly sweet caramel notes balanced with toasted nut flavors. Hops hide in the background for the most part.

Spread-out punctuation mark laces. Mainly malty aroma, cinnamon toast seems to be most predominant. Mouthfeel strays, not thin but almost soupy or like a thin stew, with lower carbonation. The flavor profile rings mostly malt (not much to pick out in hops), but its muddled and dishwater-like with initial molasses but also with cardboard back tastes that don't work for me. Solid enough to hold on to this profile without any fade, it doesn't go anywhere that nice or interesting however. What's there is tepid (especially for a brew that could be classed as an Old Ale) and not that good tasting, at least IMO...","ADR","Sep 15, 2005"

Taste is relatively bland, like a watered down, underpowered porter in most respects. Undercarbonated body, very thin.

Astringent tastes up-front of raisins, cranberries, and assorted fruits...roasted chocolately malts in the finish. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation..relatively smooth also. Very drinkable and at nearly 7% abv, this could catch up on you pretty quick. Overall, it's a fall seasonal that's worth a try, but nothing to get too excited about.","hero27","Feb 25, 2005"

Softly toasted malt with subtle hints of roasted grain, bolstered by a sweet, dark toffee undertone in aroma. Slightly raisin like, dark lovibond caramel dominates the flavor profile, due to the meager hop bitterness. Understated herbal hop flavor. Very clean, surprisingly lager like crispness allows Munich malt to add a sweetly toasty contrast. Mellow hints of roasted nutty melanoidins. A touch thin in body, and lacks sufficient dextrins and viscosity to support the overall malt sweetness. Finishes squeaky clean, with fading hints of sweetened biscuit. Immaculately crafted, but understated to the point of being lackluster. Somewhat dangerously quaffable.","marc77","Oct 01, 2003"
