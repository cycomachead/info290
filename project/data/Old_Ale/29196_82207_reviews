"O- Okay. I'd like this to have a little more body, a little less hop bitterness, and some more fruit character. It's sweet-ish, but I think it could be stronger."

"I love a drinkable, flavorful, solid ale. This one fits the bill. It is an amber-copper color with a frothy white head. The aroma is malt forward, with a little fruit. Slight background of herbal hops. The flavor is balanced...nice malt backbone with firm bitterness that lingers. Full in body. This is a well made, drinkable ale."

"O - It just tastes like a ""beer"". I dont know what else to really say."
"However, the lengthier description also makes it sound like an older, endemic style of American beer. The above scores are what I'd give it as a California Common. It was a crisp and refreshing beer. If you're expecting the fruity malts of an old ale, then skip this. If you want an easy drinking summer beer, this will suit you fine."

"6th generation stock ale pours a darker golden color with no head. There is a sweet light and crisp aroma. The taste is the same, light and crisp, with a sweeter flavor; some apple notes. The body is rather light and the beer is overall watery. Overall its by no means bad, but nothing too special."

"My initial pour produced two fingers of fizzy, rocky french-vanilla colored head with decent retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber (SRM = 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose gave off a metallic twang along with a piney hop character. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching fullness, and the taste was odd for the style, more caramel malt-forward than I expected or would have liked with the hops almost a passenger along for the ride. I got a quick wash of grassy mintiness on the finish, but this was not my bag, especially in light of the style. That said, I have gathered that they like to play around with styles and such at SBC, but they need to play just a bit more with this one, IMHO. YMMV."

"Overall my only complaint is the body being a bit on the thin side and it's a bit off the mark as an APA but I love English ales! Otherwise this would be an excellent beer getting a solid 4 out of 5!"
"Overall: Pretty average APA, but it reminds me of English versions."
"A solid well constructed old school malt forward ale."

"O-nothing special, not a whole lot of flavor"
""
""
" The flavor is very crisp up front with sligth spice and herbal flavors from the hops which seem to have a fruity influence alongside the yeast with slight toasted and caramel flavor from the malt base with some mild sweetness in the finish. Overall this is not a bad beer to me, it does have more of an English yeast and hop flavor than American Pale ale qualities, but I found it pretty drinkable for the style."

"The beer pours a deep golden/amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma decent. It has a bone dry pale malt scent along with a light touch of caramel malt for color and body. The hop aroma is adequate, but nothing to write home about. The taste is decent as well. It has a crisp, clean flavor with a solid malt character and a mild hop bitterness. It goes down easy with a very dry finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty solid brew, but nothing I'd go out of my way to find."
"This is quite a mild apa, if it's even that. Lots of malts with a minimal hop presence. What's there barely nips, though at least there is something. Seems earthy and restricted. Biting carbonation. Easy to drink, sure, but not really that interesting. Of probably try this if it were on cask."

"I was really interested to see something by Susquehanna in my neck of the woods, but this seems to be really out of balance, even for its overall restrained character. And yeah, it's hard to shake that phantom macro-lager profile, though this definitely has more to offer. Let's talk about marketing & expectations here. They call this a ""stock ale"" on the label & website, which to me says ""old ale", though it's 5.5% ABV & listed on BA here as an American pale. Maybe I'm a little shy on my history here, but I really didn't know where to calibrate my expectations of this beer. Hopefully my appraisal didn't suffer, but it was a bit confusing. Regardless of what it's ""supposed"" to be, the lack of balance really hurt it."

"Overall: very nice, refreshing. ABV is readable and the ability to have more than one is here. Well done."

"I'm not going to rate this beer on the norms of rating beer but I will say this that the other people that gave a review on this either work or have some sort of affiliation with this brewery to rate this so high I personally think that this beer is a total drain pour it tastes like miller light with more of a ""beer"" taste to it"
""
"This beer is a pleasure for good times."

"Overall I am pleased with the beer quality. It is a beer that pairs good in any situation.This might be my new go to beer."

"Great job Jamie and SBC staff!!"
"O - Another good beer by the SBC, so far they haven't let me down! Haven't been able to get a hold of their third beer, but I'll see where the beer gods take me next. A must try for any fan of pale ales!"
