3.83,10.1,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"aramel smell coming off of this, literally took me by surprise. Nice aroma of oak and alcohol mixing and swirling around with it now, really starting to pick up steam the warmer it got. So complex, with rich earthy tones running rampant through it. Warm oak infused notes of brandy like alcohol running over the tongue, so sweet and sugary. As you roll it around you start to notice there is a little bit of a bitter bite to this one. Way down deep under all of the malt, there was a subtle bitter hoppiness, very grainy and earthy, but it was there, and really pushed through on the finish. Long drawn out finish it was, soo complex, with every sip letting you discover more and more flavors. Deep dark fruit now coming through for me, really started to actually dominate the scene all together. Huge raisin and plum notes giving it that sweet but yet tart dark fruit flavor we all come to love","mikesgroove","Nov 17, 2011"

4.69,34.8,4.75,5,4.75,3.5,4.75,"Update: I just opened another 2011 edition of this beer, now 2 years old and I had to come and change my numbers on this. This beer is truly incredible. I don't know if I have weird taste or if this is just a very hidden gem because 2011 editions of this beer seem to be all over the place, never flying off the shelves and the reviews aren't exactly fantastic on here. I was pretty new to craft beer when I first had this, but coming back, it's even better than I remember it. Not sure why I thought alcohol heat was not very discernible, though. It's VERY present, which is awesome, and that roasted leather-molasses flavour is just spot on. It's like being able to drink a barbecue, which should be every Texans dream, I would imagine. The stickiness on the mouthfeel is a little much, I'll admit, but this is one of my favourite beers and I encourage other lovers of roasted malts and sweet beers to partake...as soon as possible.","ElCommodoro","Jul 04, 2011"
3.36,-3.4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"This is a medium to full bodied brew. Light to moderate carbonation but leaning more towards light. This is a fairly decent take on the style but there are others that are better. It is a decent sipper and more enjoyable while it is chilled. Once it warms up, it gets to be a bit of a disjointed mess that doesn't meld well due to its lack of big residual malt flavoring I expect in the style.","stakem","May 28, 2011"
4,14.9,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer was an orange copper color with a tan colored, thick head that did leave some nice lacing. I could smell apples, pears, a hint of white wine and a caramel background. The taste is similar, I got some alcohol, white grape, apple peel and lemon. It's medium bodied, very smooth, warming and dry. This is an enjoyable brew, I wouldn't mind seeing what a little more aging would do to it.","JMad","Mar 29, 2011"
3.25,-6.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Opinion: I don't know what to say except that this is a pretty good beer, and that this is a hard category to score well in because the competition is so high. That said, this beer is very thin for the style by any stretch. The hops are pretty aggressive for the style as well, so maybe it would be better appreciated once it has been cellared for 4-5 years. Either way, it is decent and worth a shot to see if you like this end of the Old Ale spectrum.","SkeeterHawk","Feb 04, 2011"
3.55,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer pours a slight copper color leaning more to the jaundiced side on that color scale with an offwhite head that's minuscule at best. The aromatics are rather fruity. I detected hints of butterscotch and green apple, which I have to admit I didn't truly expect. The flavors were a bit on the side of apple juice mixed in with some buttery notes and sweet malt to carry along with it. The mouthfeel was smooth and nice. It was carbonated rather nicely, but did have an acidic quality to it. The overall on this beer was that it was fine, it didn't wow me but I didn't hate it either.","Vdubb86","Jun 27, 2010"
4.12,18.4,4,4.5,4,3,4.5,"I'm not sure where the carbonation issues, clarity issues and other stale issues, that I see complaints of, are coming from. Maybe storage is an issue, but the age has done well for my bottles and I don't seem to have those issues at all...","EgadBananas","May 20, 2010"

3.03,-12.9,3.5,3,3,2,3.5,"D - Easy enough to drink, but the lack of carbonation combined with a lack of flavor complexity make it difficult to enjoy. I probably won't be having this again.","pwsoldier","Dec 29, 2009"
3.32,-4.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Taste is heavily leaning towards the sweet malts...burnt caramel, toffee and crystal malt. There is some muscadine grape fruitiness in there as well as a few hints of raisins and figs. Jasperilla is a bit watery and there is not much character to the ale, never will be called overly complex. I enjoyed drinking my half of the bomber though and would consider purchasing again.","twiggamortis420","Nov 11, 2009"
3.5,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours orangish-brown with not much head. The aroma is very sweet with lots of caramel malt. The flavor has a lot of malty sweetness with some a caramel flavor. There is also some fruit, specifically apple. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. I have had this beer before but never reviewed it. I think it was better fresh.","Mora2000","Sep 20, 2009"

3.03,-12.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"D: I had high hopes for this beer but it fell short. It brings back great memories of spending time in Texas though. It needs more of a malt taste and for the body to be thickened up.","aerozeppl","Jul 28, 2009"
2.71,-22.1,4,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"It was nice to try this local, but I don't know if I'd buy another bomber of Jasperilla. I enjoyed the flavor at first, but after a while, it just became a chore to keep sipping.","Riccymon","Jul 17, 2009"
4.13,18.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"I have to mark this one down on drinkability because it's a sipping beer, not a session drink. But that's the nature of the beast with most old ales and they shouldn't be denigrated for it. Once you get a taste for them you're hooked.","omnigrits","Jun 26, 2009"
3.98,14.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Verdict: I'm happy to report that this is quite a tasty and complex beer, and would be a great brew to enjoy with a cigar in the evening. I'll be cellaring a bottle for a year or so to see how it ages.","BeanBone","Jun 20, 2009"
3.01,-13.5,4.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours a clear medium to dark copper color with a good sized bubbly off white head that sticks around for a while. Aromas of caramel and light citrus come to the forefront. Slight alcohol and a twinge of biscuit round things out. Smells decent, but smells malty sweet, very little hop on the nose. The taste is sweet caramel and a light fruitiness. Its really malty sweet almost to the point of cloying. Theres a strange twang in the background that I can't quite identify its almost metallic or phenolic luckily it doesn't stick around long enough to ruin this completely. Slight alcohol burn in the finish. Carbonation is medium, mouthfeel is sticky, body is medium to thick. This one has some issues. It could be my fault for sitting on this bottle for 2 years, but as is this isn't that good. Its heavy on the malt without enough hops to balance the sweetness. That strange taste doesn't help much either. I'd love to give a fresh bottle a try.","johnnnniee","Jun 07, 2009"

2.79,-19.8,4.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Pours an almost clear light amber/golden, some orange highlighting, very thick off white head forms, chunky and rocky, drops a ton of lace on the glass, very thick, real nice layer, looks good! Smell is interesting, quite sweet, lots of toffee, very heavy biscuity aroma, bread, some raisin and light fruitiness, grapes, touch of alcohol, lightly earthy, something about it that smells a bit weird I can't place, like a dirty bathroom floor. Taste is weird, apricots and rotten fruit, some caramel and brown sugar sweetness, grapes, raisin, biscuits, very sweet, some iron, alcohol, kind of a mess. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, almost syrupy, low carbonation, some warmth going down, a little tough of drink. The biscuit/toasty character is neat, but too sweet and some real strange flavours going on, but it does look nice. Thanks Greg!","Viggo","Apr 27, 2009"

3.52,1.1,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This is a strange brew. I'm not sure I would call this an old ale, exactly, but it is interesting. Big and adventurous, but it seems to miss its target. A good one to try, if you're into new, off-center brews, but it's a stretch to say this is like any other old ale I've ever had. Cheers to Independence for being creative, though.","Atlas1","Feb 12, 2009"
3.53,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"M + D: Medium body, medium carbonation. Pretty straight forward, maybe even lacking a little something.

2.61,-25,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"I saw this for about $5 a bomber. I thought that was a good deal, and something I wanted to try. I have, and I don't care to try it again.","champ103","Feb 03, 2009"
3.55,2,3.5,3.5,4,3,3,"The flavor is a step in the right direction, and tastes of syrupy booze, white pepper, tropical fruit esthers, and a kiss of piney hops along the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, with a low carbonation level and a lingering finish of warming alcohol. Jasperilla isn't exactly what I look for in an Old Ale, but it's a decent brew that's worth the small asking price. Nevertheless, I don't think I'd buy it again.","wagenvolks","Nov 03, 2008"

Not as thick or sweet or alcoholic as North Coast Old Stock, but closer in all three than many Old Ales I've sampled. All-in-all I don't really like it.

Aroma is strongly sweet, but also has some citrus and pine. Taste is lightly malty upfront, but strongly citrus and fruity in the middle, with a light hoppiness next, and then a warming close. The sharp citrus character is reminiscent of lemonade. Mouthfeel and drinkability are just alright as well, quashed by that citrus as well.

Lots of sherry and booze too. Is this already showing signs of heavy oxidation? Lots of plum up front in the flavor with a middle showing of sour apple. Toast starts to blossom towards the end, but is interrupted by sherry and an odd fungal/baker's yeast flavor and dryness in the finish. Carbonation is rather mellow and a touch creamy. The body isn't too thick, but holds strong. Not impressed with this at all. Not finishing this bomber.","goochpunch","May 20, 2007"
3.15,-9.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clear bronze with a thick creamy off white head that dies quick and leaves behind spotty lace.

2.68,-23,3,2.5,2.5,4,2.5,"Jasperilla Old Ale pours a clear copper body beneath a creamy head of off-white foam. The head retention is limited and it leaves little lacing behind. The nose is malty with a hint of caramel, and fruity with yeast character (apple, pear, red berries), but it has some higher alcohols and a touch of acetone as well. That carries over into the flavor and seems to dominate. It's like drinking a hot honey-mead. Perhaps the fermentation just got away on this batch - the cooling system failed or something - but it's not good. As it warms and the maltiness comes out a bit more it's a little easier to take, but at that point the alcohol becomes more prevalent. Flawed. Perhaps next years will be better.","NeroFiddled","Apr 20, 2007"
4.92,41.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"A dark rich amber colour in the glass. No head, but a thin layer of bubbles around the edge.

Full, rich flavours of caramel and dark fruits; raisins, figs, apricots, vanilla. Finish is slightly dry and a bit acidic with a mild warming affect. This is a wonderful beer that can be enjoyed with a desert as well as savoured as an evening ender. Very drinkable.","Xadoor","Apr 16, 2007"
