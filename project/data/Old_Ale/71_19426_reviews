"This is now one of the best beers I've had; at least for the style. In my opinion, this is a 100 rated beer."
""
""
""
"Vintage 2011...  Unbelievable beer!  Velvety marmalade in your mouth!"
""
""
"2000 version. Cream head, thick body, lots of dark fruits and brown sugar. Amazing."
""
"The mouthfeel is quite nice. Thick and substantial but not syrupy or coating. Could not guess what ABV% this was. One of the best parts was the creamy feel."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was the 2010.  Purchased at Fuller's Brewery along with a few others.  Poured amber brown with cream head.  Was a little more carbonated than expected.  Sweet caramel malts on the nose with just a whiff of that of that old ale funk.  Really full mouthfeel with lots of mincemeat/stonefruit and dark malt.  Really surprised at the flavor at ""only"" 8.5%.  Tastes like an even bigger beer.  Well done.  Will taste the other 2010 I have in a couple years to see how it changes further."
"I'm no official beer rater, I just have some favorite tastes. So my comments here are not on the technical side. However, this past Christmas, I opened and shared a bottle of Fuller's Vintage Ale from 1999 and DAMN was that tasty. 15 years out and still kickin'."
""
"Overall, a pretty good beer and worth getting when you can. I would highly advise to get two in order to age one since the notes taste like it will become even richer with a bit more aging."
""
""

"I dig old ales and this is a fun beer...really should pick up a fresher bottle"
""
"Cheers!"
"Aroma has hints of oxidation, cardboard. Taste isn't bad; thin body."
""
""
""
"Overall:  I truly enjoyed this, and the fact that it’s bottle-conditioned at will reach its peak in 3-4 years screams to me that I should grab one more, for that express purpose.  Keep it up, Fuller’s, I doff my hat to you."
""
""
""
"o: a nice ale, kind of like a mild barleywine. nothing spectacular but it's tasty"
"O - brilliant, if a little strong in the alcohol tastes.  Maybe I should have cellared it for another couple of years."
""
""
"Very nice beer. Fuller's does not get the respect they deserve."
""
"a real neat beer, 2011 edition enjoyed late 2014, so the time is now! hazy copper colored liquid with some viscosity, and still a nice off white head, but it fades pretty fast. a nose of caramel, biscuits, dried apricots, english ale yeast, and slight but not offensive oxidation. the alcohol cuts the malt sweetness, and there is some nice depth to this between the yeast and the layered sweet grain. barley at its finest, lots of body, excellent carbonation, butterscotch, toffee, golden raisin, and bittering hops are all there. the flavors have become really well integrated over time, i can only imagine an intense and moderately disjointed beverage fresh, but the time has made it nice. i dont taste much alcohol here, but i get an apple wine sort of flavor and warming thing late. great beer overall, if you like the patient english stuff this is not to be missed."
""
"Overall I enjoyed this beer and will be purchasing again.  I wish the hops weren't as pronounced, but possibly after the 4 year ""peak"" it will be less noticeable.  Thats just my personal taste."
"Overall - I need to get another one of these and allow it to sleep in my cellar longer."
"Final Thoughts: I'm not sure what I was expecting going in to this one, but Fuller's has seriously impressed me with their bitter and porter offerings. I've got to give it to them here, against all odds the hop flavor lasted more than three years. Makes me wonder how this thing drinks fresh. Would I drink it again? Sure."
""
"Goes does too easily for a beer this size. Smooth and not bursting with flavor, but flavorful and enjoyable."
"Overall: This is easily one of the more influential old ales. It's a must try for anyone who likes the style and a staple in any cellar. The amount of improvement from one year to two is pretty substantial. This would be a fun one to do a large vertical on to see where the peak is. I think at 2+ years it is still moving upward. The balancing with the hops on this one is unlike any old ale I have had before. I look forward to slowly stocking my cellar with these boxes."

"D - What a wonderful beer... Elegant... Sophisticated... A definite sipper... I found my self relaxing more and more with each and every sip... Beyond very good and just a notch below world class... I eagerly await the ability to try additional vintages... I'm not surprised that I liked this beer given the lofty expectations that I had, but I'm surprised that I enjoyed this much... Highly recommended and must for those BAs who enjoy the occassional malt bomb..."

""
"Overall, a really nice Old Ale from the motherland of old ale. I think this would be a fun one to buy 5, and rate one/year."

"While I feel this might be a little too tart, highly carbonated, and not really complex, it's still pretty tasty."

"My favorite beer from Fuller's and one of the greatest English ales of all. If you can find it, go for it."
""
"O: Neither bad nor amazing. Reminiscent of a thinner, less complex Double DBA."
"A really pleasant strong ale that doesn't blow you out with too many crazy flavors. If it is a single malt and single hop beer like the label makes it sound, then it's got a lot of nuance for a simple beer, just well put together."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a flavorful beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for a style."

"Bottle (Vintage 2012 - drank in 2013): Poured a copper color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention. Aroma consists of residual sugars with some dry caramel and minimal hoppy notes. Taste is also dominated by some residual sugars with quite a bit of dry caramel malt with weird grainy notes. Hops presence is kept at a low level. Body is about average with good carbonation and no alcohol is easily detectable. I usually like to give a year to the Vintage for the malt to balanced itself out and take out some of the hops presence. Seems like it wasn’t a good idea with the 2012 vintage since it tasted like a really old beer already."

"500 ml bottle into snifter; 2008 vintage, Bottle #113845. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, pear, apple, plum, raisin, fig, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, light pepper, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, pear, apple, fig, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, light pepper, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Zero bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, pear, apple, fig, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, light pepper, light leather, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic old ale! All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
"I'm probably sampling slightly too cold, but see hints of nice Old Ale. More alcohol and less of a rich sherry flavor than I might expect."

"I would recommend that you try it but this bottle was obviously not what the brewer intended."
""
"O: Not the most inspirational beer but still complex and I'm yet to have a barley wine that has been less than excellent."
"A decent beer, but probably better when fresh. It would be better to have the hops shine through."

"O: Drinks a bit stronger that 8.5%. That being said, the drinkability is okay, not something your gonna want to drink all night. Overall it is tasty and I'm curious to see what the 2009, 2011 are going to taste like. I will sit on my 2013 for many years after tasting this since it still seems pretty true to what it was fresh."
""
""
"o: i wasn't sure what to expect when i opened this, but i'm pleasantly surprised. this is a definite malt bomb, though i would have liked a little less alcohol in the flavor. not as good as something like Adam, but still really well made and full of nicely harmonized flavors. this walks that line between English Barleywine and Old Ale"

"O: Fullers Vintage is an annual purchase for me, I usually get a couple of bottles every year. This was my last 2010, and it was quite enjoyable. I can only hope the other years I have age as well. The brandy and dark fruit flavors were quite enjoyable. A good sipper."
"hazy dark copper color, thin off-white head that fades. rich malty aroma - toffee, caramel, raisins. more of the same with the taste, but well balanced. not too sweet, some earthy bitterness to even things out. smooth silky body, moderate soft carbonation. very tasty overall."
""

""

""

"B-"
"Overall - Excellent beer full of complexity, wish I had some space so that I could age a couple of these for a couple of years to see how they taste then. Highly recommended to try at least once even given the hefty price tag."
"O-Tremendous for the category although a bit pricey value wise. Understandably the import adds a few $ to the bottle I'm sure but it's a great representation of the traditional British ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very deep and complex beer. There is really a lot going on here in the aroma and flavor and it is a wonderful drinking experience. I really with I could try some of the other vintages."
""
""
"For the sake of completion, i re-edited. Had the 2000 vintage, in 2014. Different fish food entirely, would have rated it way closer to 5."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a beautiful beer that I look to grab any time I see in the store. Its perfect for the cellar, and while its served in a pint sharing this beaut will be sure to please any guest."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A great English ale. The aging has really made it fantastic."
"Nice bottle. Very old fashioned and austere. What's inside is even better. Pours a light toasty orange that makes one think mellow but complex, aged yet dynamic. A whiff of the light caramel colored head evokes fine scotch whisky and butterscotch, coffee cake and sweet orange. Palate shows a mind-blowing complexity that includes the aforementioned aroma components along with citrus marmalade, brown sugar, nutmeg/mace, vanilla toffee, dates, tobacco, and bitter Brazil nuts. A sipper that won't get dull as each sip reveals something new, with each component falling into the dark and sweet categories. Hops prevent things from being too decadent and add spicy earthy notes. Body is not as heavy as excepted but still pretty chewy (think a strong brown ale) and finish is winey and aromatic. The sort of beer that might cause a paradigm shift in any novices who happen to be around when you partake and worth every penny. Will change with age. The present exemplar was almost three years old."
""
""
""
""
"Really nicely done. Could see myself savoring a pint of this for an extended period after a nice meal or during the fall and winter months."
""
""
"this is a nice beer all around. it was a present from my wife, who knows absolutely nothing about beer - she just thought it looked fancy in the box. i'm glad she picked this up for me for christmas.. i feel like the few months in the cellar have done this one well. not sure about its cost, but this seems like an affordable beer, and very spot on for the style. i'll go ahead and recommend it."
""
"O- A nice old ale, the sweet malt flavors are great, I might grab some more of this to hang onto and see how it's tasting after the hops fade out, a very good beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a complex beer which tastes more like a beer of 10+ABV. I will buy another bottle to cellar."

"surprisingly little to comment on, as it is very well done . . . though not forging any real new ground. appearance is a solid ale, thick head dies down to leave not much in the lacing. nose is the best part, fruity, figgy, leather, a bit of sweetness that is very inviting. a bit of plum, leather and clove in the taste, very nice. presentation (packaging), gets bonus points"
""
"O: This is a truly superb brew that captures the best of the British Isles. Akin to a German Doppelbock, this has a biscuity quality I have come to love in real British ales, along with the subtle understatement of Goldings. I am going to get more of these, laying them down for 3-4 years as recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Burnt taste, really like black tea, it is very bitter. The flavors of malt and hops are intertwined. Tried vintage 2010, apparently was too young. Such beer to withstand the maximum, only if it is fully revealed. Suffice it to yourself to get a certain characteristics to safely call it in English, tough ale."
""
""
"O- A very solid Old ale. I would love to try some older vintages and have no doubt this would age well."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm very glad i let this one rest a bit before giving it a go. I imagine that a fresh one would be very sweet and very boozy. I will have to get another one of these once they are available again to sit in my cellar for a while."
""
""
""
""
"2008 vintage, poured into a snifter. Pours an amber orangey gold color. Good carbonation, decent head and lacing. Smells of caramel and toffee. Taste is mildly sweet, with caramel and toffee up front but chalk and metallic notes in the aftertaste that come and go. Tastes a lot like an American-style barley wine but not as complex as I had hoped for a slightly older vintage. Still worth trying once."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: starts off nice enough, but loses steam and really doesn't leave a great final impression; elements are there to make it great, but needs a little something...."
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, fruit, and some slight hop aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp but slightly medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer this fresh but I would be curious to see what some age does to this one."
""
""
""
"Had a 2009 vintage in the cellar and drank it tonight. Poured into a tulip glass. Dark amber color, very nice clarity. Soapy white head formed then faded quickly. Some carbonation left but some loss is detected. Smell was ripe figs and caramel. Taste was very nice. Sweet malt dominates. The mouthfeel was amazing. Super smooth and velvety. Went down like an aged port wine: just a bit of booze but delicious. What a nice beer. Aging this ale for 3-4 years did wonders."
"This was a 2009 vintage, bottle number 133946, consumed December 2012."

"O - I wonder what my thoughts would have been had I not had a 2000 JW Lees first. They are different beers for sure, but they occupy a similar category in my mind. This is a very nice beer, but just missing a few key elements. Still, very enjoyable."
""
"O: Interesting old ale. Lots of toastiness and nuttiness. Prominent typical english hops. Sweet and fairly complex. Feels more like an english strong ale than an olde ale to me. I will have to compare this to an aged version sometime. Tasty."
""
"Murky brownish-red colour, cap of white head, not much in the way of lace. Nose is of sweet caramel and toffee, malty with lots of fruit, cherry, fig and raisin, bit of sugary sweetness and a bit of nutty/almond as well. Taste is of sweet malt and darker sugars, quite vibrant fruit, cherry, plum, fig, caramel like sweetness, lightly bitter hop, fruity finish. Lightly carbonated, full body. Nicely complex and enjoyable, really held up quite nicely, fantastic stuff here."
""
""
"Buy some. You will not regret it."
""
"(4.0) D: I’d like to pick up another and sit on it for a year or two and really give the taste time to develop further. Nonetheless, still a treat to drink in it’s fresher current state."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not brilliant but looking forward to a 10 year vertical."
"MF - probably one of the best beer I have ever tasted. All beers should taste like this one! An absolute classic!"
""
"O - One of the best beers I have ever had. Simply superb. Love the richness and complexity of the flavors. The fact that there is a store near me that has six more dusty boxes of this fills me with glee, and I will be restocking!"

"2007 vintage. I've long eyed this boxed bottle, and now I finally get to try some of the innards. It pours a lightly-brackish sunset amber topped by a minor bit of khaki foam. The nose comprises red apple skin, sweet caramel, and perfume-y flowers. The taste is an unpleasant melange of honey, cerumen and light biscuit. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I'm not sure if the age somehow got to this one early or something, but either way it did not sit well with my tongue. It actually hurt a little to drink at times..."
"Overall an excellent drink, to be enjoyed more like a whiskey or port."
"Pours dark, red-amber. slightly hazy but not cloudy. Malty, caramel flavours, and a sherry-like after taste. Good full-bodied mouth feel. I’d liked it a lot. (didn’t keep the bottle number, I’m afraid)"

"2012"
""
""
"Really, really inpressed. I hope my 2011 version is as good when I open that."
""
"Very well balanced and flavorful which fades slowly away with no clear passage to an aftertaste."
""
"Mouthfeel hits the mark nicely - despite the fizzy, bottle-conditioned carbonation, it doesn't hit the tongue harshly; nor does it fade too quickly. Slightly sticky, coating the tongue a bit. Very good for what I'd describe as a sipping beer. Overall, this young Fullers 2012 was a solid offering; very interested in seeing how it develops over time."
""
""
"Overall - Very smooth and extremely drinkable... even without any age on it. It's a delicious beer but I hoped for a little more complexity. Maybe it will be different with a few years on it."
"O: While I wouldn't call it GREAT, I will say that I really appreciate its elegance and subtlety. Don't know if I'd pay $10 for a bottle again, but it's well worth a shot."
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 4.32, an outstanding A grade. Very impressive stuff, not that I expected anything less from Fuller's. Smooth, balanced, rich-tasting and wholly satisfying, Fuller's Vintage Ale is a fabulous, relatively affordable introduction to the style that I must highly recommend to any and all BAs. The slight warmth from the abv and rich, complex malty flavour makes this a perfect selection for a late fall/early winter night. I may need to pick up another bottle and hold onto it for a while, since it seems likely this is the sort of brew that will improve with a few years in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I love that crisp, dry attenuation character you get with some English old ales. The mouthfeel isn't perfect, but besides that this is really nice."
"Not sure how readily available around the US, but easily accessible in Pa/New Jersey. Bottle prices range from 8.99 to 14.99. Have had every year except 1997, which I will open and review 11/3, have been waiting a while to do so. Seek this brew, from what I have tasted if properly stored it doesn't matter what year you find."
""
""
""
""
"It was certainly drinkable, but I'm finding it funny how many bottle-conditioned, higher-gravity UK (strong, old) ales that I get are straight-up infected. The majority so far. Leaves me to wonder why they are even sent over here if the brewery and/or the distributors and retail outlets can't or won't handle them properly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light to medium bodied with average carbonation and a booze aftertaste. A nice beer, but I would have scored it higher if the alcohol was less prominent."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, sticky on the lips slightly syrupy."
""
""
""
""
"O: Highly recommended if you have a sweet tooth. Complex and different, and interesting compared with a fresh beer. I've aged a couple beers but usually not this long. In addition I more fully see what they were trying to do with Kasteel Cuvee du Chateau as a result of drinking this brew."
""
""
""
"Finish is slightly bitter , full bodied and still a touch sweet."
""
""
"The pour is a clear amber color with a very small off-white head. A bit of a sherry-like aroma. Quite fruity (raisins and cherries) with some vanilla and cream. Interesting aroma. The flavor is also heavy on the vanilla, sweet fruit, sugar, and caramel. A touch of sherry and oxidation in there as well."
"Drinkability – Although it’s not a fantastic old ale, I found it surprisingly drinkable for 8.5%abv, and went through the bottle far quicker than expected, so I'll bump up the overall score by a half point."

"O- Awesome beer. Rich and warming with a good amount of booze. This is an absolutely world class beer that shows amazing potential to age. I have a few bottles of 2009 vintage that I plan on hanging on to for a few more years."

"Overall: I didn't know much about this one going in, but I was quite happy with it. A very nice after dinner beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- expletives should be used here. This one hasn't even reached its 'peak' (which the brewery states is 3-4 years of aging) yet it is perfect to me after only two. I hold much delight in knowing that I can grab a couple more bottles of the 2010 to lay down for a few more years. This is a commanding beer, fit for celebration and commencement, and when we cross paths again it won't be used for amusement on a boring Tuesday night."
""
"Overall: This beer smells nice and the mouthfeel is great. It tastes like a belgian triple to me, not an old ale. It let me down a little bit. Decent beer, but if you want a really good Old Ale get yourself some Hair of the Dog Adam!"
""
"Pours a warm amber color with a small beige cap. The glass glows with beer as the lacing slowly slides down the walls. The aroma is rich with sugary malt notes. Toffee, dates, raisins, light citrus, pastry dough, caramel, coffee cake, honey, earth, wood, fresh biscuits and glazed donuts are some flavors that come to mind. The taste is luxuriously sweet, like wrapping your tongue in a warm blanket of malt candy. There's still a touch of hop presence from the Challenger/Northdown, and it comes across with a light resin and earth bitterness in the finish. Lots of honey and dark fruit. It's just a pleasure to drink. The alcohol warms the palate. Carbonation is light. A tasty, tasty beer."
""
""
""
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. Pretty rich, lasting beer although it might not be worth the price."
""
""
"O: I definitely need to try a different sample to gain a better appreciation but certainly a delicious ale."
"Chestnut brown in colour, lightly murky with a cream coloured head. Light retention and lacing. Nose is incredibly malty and complex, dark fruits of fig and date leanings, brown sugar and leather. Taste has more of the same, and the malts are similarly if not more complex in design. Brown sugar, leather, light butterscotch and fruits similar to the nose. A touch of alcohol and light acidity in the finish. Medium full mouthfeel, smooth and subdued carbonation. This has matured (or held up) well for 6 years."
""
""
""
""
"NOTE: The next day I woke up and spent the following weekend sick with the flu. I think my senses started to get compromised, perhaps evaluating this brew. I think trying this again in the future is in the cards."
""
""
""
"O: An English classic. Very drinkable and enjoyable beer"
""
"Good lord is this tasty. Rich and quite decadent with a blend of raisins, plums, toffee, burnt sugar and a little nougat, this is quite exceptional. Apparently, this vintage was 100% Optic malt (never heard of it), and this pale malt, coupled with a long boil, has picked up a lot of character. Fruity and ripe with even a bit of bright fruits (pineapple and citrus) to go with the dark fruit (raisins, plums), this is pretty good. Brown sugar on the mid-palate, with dark honey, and again, the burnt sugar. Mildly bitter on the finish (grainy, mostly), this beer is medium in body, and moderately carbonated really really good. Lingering fruit and toffee are present on the finish, along with just a little bitterness, this is like a good, rummy fruitcake. I wish I bought more of this, I can see a decade doing wonders for this."
""
""
""
"Overall, a real treat - at around £7.50 a bottle it's not something I'll be drinking regularly, but everyone should be trying a few beers like this. The real difference is the sheer complexity of the taste which can really only be achieved with aging. I had a bottle of the 2012 vintage a few days ago and the difference was stark - the new release is certainly nice enough, but very one dimensional compared to its much older brother."
""
""
"O- A very solid brew with all of the English ale characteristics that I enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty treat -- exceptionally smooth overall."
""
""
""
""
"A copper body with a small small head. Quite a sweet nose with caramel being at the fore. The body has a light crystal malt character along wih some mild butter and light spice notes. Disappointed by this beer, but maybe because I had been expecting so much and had many other better beers that night..."
"The reveal: Fullers 2009 Vintage Ale. A very nice malty treat for a chilly Cincinnati morning. Thanks Thirstyherf for another great beer. I dont know how this one never hit my radar."
"Though I really enjoyed this brew, it really didn't wow me as much as I had thought it would. Price tag keeps this from being a regular in my house, but it's an enjoyable treat every now and then."
""
""
""
"Notes: Well kept for bottle in a box. Mellow, chock full of fruit, this is exceptional."
""
"Strong carbonation and head, malty, good after taste, smells like a triple. Too bad it is limited to 85,000 bottles but maybe it is a good idea - at $9.95 for 500ml one could go broke."
""
"O: I was thoroughly surprised by how well this beer has aged. The complexity is beautiful and the balance (start to finish) is in a league of its own. Not sure if all the vintages will age like this; however, if you have access to trying the 1999, make it happen. Well worth it."
""
""
"It will probably last for many years to come as well."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."

"O - Wonderful Old Ale! Very glad I picked this one up last year! Highly recommended for all BA'ers to grab one in passing, this is a commercial brew that has love and thought put into it. Strange, perhaps NB, Coors, and Sam could learn a lesson or two...."
""
"Overall this is an excellent old ale that is perfect for sipping, on a cold day or special occasion. It has held up quite well in the cellar for the past three years with no apparent harm. Also an excellent value at only $8.00 for a bottle."
""
"O - This is a fantastic beer. Nice aroma and palate, great mouthfeel and drinkability. I'd like to age one to see how it changes, I imagine it'd age well."
"This is one of the best beers I have ever had. The taste was EXACTLY what I was hoping for an more. An exceptional beer if there ever was one. There should be more hype surrounding this beer."
"O: A beautiful beer that is very drinkable and complex in flavour."

"The older the bottle the better the flavor, it tends to be less bitter with time but better cherry like notes."

"M: creamy, rounded, very drinkable"
"I bought a few to put down and see how they develop."
"I can't wait to try this in a few years, I like it more than the 2010 edition and expect the wood and fruit character to really shine."
""
"Overall a really excellent beer. With 3 years on it, I think it's drinking very nicely. I would love to have another bottle with a little more age on it to see how it changes."

"O - First time having this beer and it was nice, although the mouthfeel was a bit off to me. Might pick some up and age them for a bit to see what happens."
"Fuller's Vintage Ale pours a beautiful amber color w/ an orange hue to the brew. A very nice one finger off white head as well, which quickly disappears to a sliver. Fairly clear, and I'm able to see through it w/o a problem. The smell is of caramel, toffee, dark fruit- w/ a sweet character to it. Taste follows the same profile, and comes very close to getting bumped up to the next score. This is a delicious beer. Feel is fantastic, very light, smooth, and composed- with a million different things happening inside your palate. Overall, this is a definite buy if you see it. I imagine it would age well- I may pick up another and try and cellar it. Cheers!"
"Yes, it's good; but it's really no better than Golden Pride and it manages to cost twice as much."

"Overall: an Old Ale with rich aroma of complex maltiness, esters and various hops, and hop-dominated flavor. (Bottle No 54920, into tulip)"
""
""
""
"O: super malty and warming, it's held up very well these past 12 years. I was expecting something nearing brandy. Not sure if the full 12 years were necessary, but it was pleasant nonetheless."
"Overall a little too much sweetness for my taste, its a good ale, however, a little more balance would have made it a lot better."
"O- Maybe my palate is not advanced enough, or maybe this doesn't have enough age on it. I have another bottle I'll probably sit on for three of four more years, then I'll revisit this. But I had a hard time finishing a glass. I'm not going to bash the rating too bad because this is my first strong ale, but the cloying sweetness prevented me from finishing this beer."
"Overall: you need to drink this one down to appreciate it."
"This is a beer that I would have ale drinkers try."
"Notes: This is quite a nice old ale, defines rather well a standard for the style, and while not for most palates if one likes it this is quite the treat."
"The aroma is very nice. I wish the actual taste were more flavorful. This is about what I would consider a bitter with the amount it has."
"Not a fail, but I was hoping for more."
"D - Well crafted, if unbalanced. Maybe just not my thing...."
"Overall, a fairly complex and tasty beverage. I am probably going to try to hold on and age my other bottles for a bit before trying this particular vintage again."
"Taste - Butterscotch, fig, plum, and a long, boozy rum finish."
"O-Very nice stuff. A bit expensive."
"mouthfeel - syrup, odd body, medium i guess"
"Creamy and well-blended. There's a lot going on in there and it all comes together to create one taste. Every element is in its right proportion."
"The 2007 Vintage is a juicier version than its older counterparts, with smacking notes of apple cider, pear, caramel malt, and a dusting of English hops that add a bit of flavor and bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky, medium-thick in body, and velvety smooth all the way through. Lower carbonation level than some of the others (save the 2004). Overall, a tasty batch of Vintage Ale. Not quite as impressive as the '05 or '06, but on-par with them and certainly better than the bottle of '04 I had."
"O: I really like the flavors going on in this, but the lack of body and malty ""umph"" leave me wanting much more out of it. I feel as it is, it's good, but it could be great. Not worth the money as is."
"Fuller’s Vintage Ale is a lot like an overpowered Belgian which is uncharacteristic from a Fuller’s brew, but it’s really very good. I saw one more bottle at the store, I wonder how much better it will be years from now."
"2007 Edition opened in 2009, bottle #114182. The beer poured out as a copper color with a nice creamy looking head on it. The lacing was pretty nice for this beer, I wasn't really expecting that too much. The smell of the beer had some grainy malt aroma with some hops in the mix. The taste was semi-sweet like they might have added some brown sugar to it or caramel maybe. The taste was very good from start to finish though. The mouthfeel of the beer was very nice as well, it was smooth but had a decent amount of carbonation in it. Overall this beer was way better than any other Fuller's brew that I've tried. Well worthy trying if you find some!"
"O - this is a big bold beer that works in all aspects, very impressed, glad i splurged for this"
"O - Overall a very tasty ale, and I wish I had another bottle to cellar for a while. It certainly would age well over time. Next opportunity I get, I will be buying multiple bottles."
"Tastes of sugar, caramel sugar, tree branches, honey, chives, salt, mushrooms, medium-roast coffee, Fruit by the Foot, rubber, hops and a lot more that I've probably forgotten. Smells the same but it's mostly just sweet and very little else. Yep, cool beer."
"Overall, the 2006 is drinking alot better than it was 2 years ago when I last tried it, and was a pleasure to drink. I will be on the lookout for more 2006 bottles to sit on for a couple more years."
"haha great price... for the actually price of 10.99 ehh would dish it out. but glad i was able to enjoy it."
"Verdict: Fantastic and near World Class brew. Find and drink and stash a couple in the cellar, folks..."
"Finish: Slight alcohol, but OK; also smooth"
"The light cherry and malt aroma doesn't do much for me, but I really like how the flavor develops here. At first it seemed acidic with a mix of berry and citrus fruit. But then it rolls into a richer candied orange rind and herbal spice. The finish is dry with floral caramel candy note from the malt. The barley plays a subtle background for the spicy hops, with gentle, dry fruit esters and hints of bread crust and toffee."
"O - Very well-conceived and produced brew. While not my favorite style, I quite enjoyed this, as did my wife. I would seek it out again."
"What a treat. I'm happy I waited 3 years before I opened this. Fuller's has been and continues to be in my top 3 English breweries and this beer tells me why. It took me a little while to appreciate its subtleties and complexities and that made it a more enjoyable experience. I've got the '09 and '10 sitting in my cellar right now and I'll be sure to keep buying them annually."
"O – The body is a shade thin, but it doesn’t detract much from the flavor profile. Unbeatable quality for the $6 price."
"Finish: Light nut with caramel and a hint of heat with a nice stickiness on the lips"
"O- Really a favorite Old Ale of mine, this was an excellent vintage the alcohol is nearly muted giving you the ability to really dive into the deliciousness of this brew. Seek this one out."
"I've had this bottle of Fuller's Vintage Ale for over three years, and it is certainly drinking fine at the moment. Since I haven't had a fresh bottle, I can't really compare. Suffice it to say it ages nicely. I've grown to like English Old Ales quite a bit, and Fuller's Vintage Ale is definitely a fine example. It has a ton of flavor and character, and ages extremely well. Grab a few bottles and put them back. It's more than worth it."
"I'll go on record as saying that there may be no beer better suited to cold early winter evenings by the fireplace, or by the Christmas tree, or at the dinner table with a roast bird coming out the oven. Fuller's Vintage Ale should be considered one of the beer world's most cherished traditions; it's one that I gleefully anticipate every year and will continue to."
"Definitely improved with some warmth. Apparently this beer is at it's peak right now, and I believe it. I will be buying another 2007 to lay down for a few more years though."
"Very good brew, one of my personal favorites. I recommend getting a couple bottles every vintage; one to try now, one to keep for later."
"This is not a very drinkable beer. The alcohol hits hard, much more so than many beers that are actually stronger. Combined with the watery taste and mouth-drying effects, it does not go down quickly. I would prefer to simply sniff it for hours. Oh well. Perhaps this one is just too old!"
"D: wouldn't want to drink more than one of these in a row because of the alcohol content, but still drinkable for the style."
"D: This is very good and strikingly similar to Sam Smith Yorkshire Stingo."
"Smooth, tasty, balanced, and fairly complex. Good beer now, but also a cellar candidate that could become even better."
"Vintage 2006: Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. ABV was 8.5%. Bottle no. 32629. Amber colour. Slightly less sweet and aromatic than the 2005 vintage. There was also a more hoppy finish in this one."
"D- Not cloyingly sweet, but still very sweet. Still has a nice amount of carbonation at this point. The molasses notes faded as it warmed up more to allow the fruity, syrupy sweetness to shine."
"My full review is here: http://whatareyoudrinking.net/2010/07/fullers-vintage-ale-my-magic-carpet-ride-to-london/"
"Bottle 074216. Slightly tilting to the bitter side, a few years storage should give more balance."
"Rating a 2007 bottle tonight. Slightly oxidised,more of a malt caramel bomb than spicy fruity beer it was when younger. I don't think I am going to age these anymore."
"From 2008 vintage bottle no. 149378. Sampled on January 1, 2011. The pour is a good looking amber-copper with a bit of a haze and a half-inch soft, silky head. The aroma sports a hard liquor nose from a barrel...maybe bourbon. Caramel sweetness and apricot accompany the barrel. The body is smooth and above medium. The taste also brings out a caramel, toffee sweetness with a dose of alcohol on the backside. This sat on my shelf for a year and I opened it to ring in 2011."
"D - A good drink but perhaps note quite ready yet as it feels a little alcoholic. I personally prefer Brakspear's Triple (which isn't really marketed for maturation but which improves greatly with age) but this is a strong contender and an excellent example of a nice vintage ale with lots of potential for maturation."
"I'm wondering if my current plan to buy 6 each year and drink one each year (aging them up to 5 years) is a good idea. I quite prefer the current year fresh and am not convinced I will prefer them later."
"Notes: I wish I had drank this about 3-4 years ago. The age is just too great and there are no more hops to balance out the malt sweetness. Although the malt flavor is complex, it does get slightly cloying sweet without a bitterness to complement the malt profile. The aroma is outstanding, and I wish it tasted and looked as good as it smelled."
"Alcohol is pretty strong on this one when it is cold. It does fade with some dark fruits coming through as it warms. I think putting some age on this one would improve it. It's recommended this one be laid down for 3-4 years and served at cellar temperature."
"an amazing brew which has great cellaring potential. drink some now and save more for later."
"Thanks to Dom for picking this up for me while in London. Clear copper-reddish pour with a one finger creamy head that fades pretty quickly with decent lacing. The earthy nose is somewhat subdued with hints of sweet caramel malt, toffee and a touch of dark fruit, specifically rasins in the background. It pretty much tastes like it smells. Lots of biscuity, caramel malt and fruitiness with just a touch of tang from the alcohol. Also getting hints of tea, brown sugar, and rasins. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with just a touch of bitterness. Slight warming from the alcohol makes this a sipper, but pretty drinkable overall. I'm a huge fan of Fuller's and probably raised my expectations of this beer a bit too much. It's a good solid beer, but slightly disappointing."
"D-the taste stays. its a fun beer to drink but one bottle is enough for me!"
"I think I might get another bottle and let it age for another year or two just for fun considering it was under $10"
" Seems young, and it is an old ale so i can really imagine this one to age very well."
"Drinks well for an old ale. Not as abrasive as others in the style, this beer benefits from that old English subtleness I keep hearing about."
"Taste is also English hop forward with spicy and earthy hop bitterness leading the way. As it warms you get some nutty and slightly toffee maltiness, not sweet, like I remember the 2007 version being. The alcohol and hop presence adds a pleasant dryness to the finish. Mouthfeel is full with perfect carbonation for the style. Not as thick and ""syrupy"" as the aged version. Overall this is a great beer fresh or aged. This fresh version is the most hop forward English beer I have ever had which is really interesting and different from your average English beer or the highly hopped citrus/pine bombs from the US. This brew is really really earthy and floral and slightly spicy which really showcases the beauty of the English style Old Ale/Barleywine style. Final note: Fuller's wins!!!"
"2008 (consumed Nov. 2010), pour from bottle (no. 144,963/145,000) into snifter, single finger of head diminishing into nice lacing, which clings to the edge of the glass in legs when tilted. Translucent/semitransparent caramel color, also caramel on the nose. No bitterness at all, sweet but not cloying, and with a relatively clean finish. Toffee and golden raisin on the palate, with a hint of dark chocolate against a backbone of malt. Bit of booze taste (8.5% ABV), but not in a bad way. Hardly any bitterness at all. Mouthfeel is impressive; the carbonation prevents a substantial, rich mouthfeel from becoming syrupy. I'll repeat the recommendation given to me: buy two; have one now and cellar the other."
"D - High for this one. Might be too sweet but it's a nice complex brew that unfortunately took a year to acheive quality."
"Tastes somewhere between a english bitter and a belgian strong ale...adjectives escape me. Very delicious. It would be great to pair with nice food but not a session beer."
"Pours a copper-amber colour with thick white head that dissipates without too much lacing. Smells of sweet caramel and butterscotch, some mild earthy hops and alcohol. Flavour is quite alcoholic, with a ton of sweetness. I really think laying down a bottle of this for a couple years could be a good idea."
"D - A bit hot but an enjoyable beer. I don't think I would track this one down again though."
"An understated classic. Very well balanced. Old world brewing at its subtle best. A joy to drink even though this bottle is about as fresh as can be. Its not even close to peaking."
"D: Found it to be quite drinkable, would love to have more of these, once in a life time, if you have one it is certainly worth the wait. For me it was a very distinctive beer one that has left an impression..."
"Drinkability: Very high, this brew truly is a work of art, and the immense effort is not only shown in the astounding packaging, but the taste as well."
"A quintessentially excellent English ale. Lovely jubbly."
"Very good drinkability, but I don't think that this is Fuller's Vintage Ale's highest point. If the alcohol was totally hidden, this beer would be irresistible. The alcohol isn't totally hidden however. The drinkability is still very good, but it doesn't beg you to drink it. It is too proud for that..."
"D: This beer is absolutely delicious. Everything melds extremely well and I am glad that it is an easy find on the shelves here in PA. Nice beer to cap off the beginning of August and the end of Summer!"
"Unfortunately, taste isn't very saturated, but complex: from sweet to fruits (plums and their kindred) then to powerful bitter accord which becomes round and dissolves into mild aftertaste, very spectacular transformation. Surprisingly, palate stays fresh and almost neutral, I have been waited some kind of heavy strike. Drink bravely! But I perceived a lack of matureness, this beer would be better kept on the cellar shelf for quite a few years, I'll try it once more later, sure, it will score more!"
"Very memorable! I have 5 more bottles for the future and am contemplating more. Looking forward to the 2010..."
"It will be excellent with all red meats, roast chicken, turkey, wild game, lasagna, meaty pastas, or even just a baguette and cheese."
"I've been looking at this beer for a while without trying it, now that I have tried it my curiosity will get the better of me and I don't see the other vintages I have lasting all that long. I love the box this one comes in and can only hope I have the restraint for a 5 year vertical(just need the 2010) wish me luck"
"Good on the drink, but this is something to savor."
"d - I thought this was a very good old ale that has held up great. Lots of good caramel malts and sweet dark fruits, would love to try again."
"This is going to be a must stop and pick up in the Detroit area on my way back to NC when I visit Grand Rapids."
"Undoubtely one of the best beers in the world. And probably my personal favorite, ever."
"Bottle # 78199. Helluva beer. Had it stored just on a shelf in my kitchen & only chilled it a couple of days ago. Poured with a thick, foamy, frothy, fine bubble, light tan head and good lace. Color is a cloudy, amber brown. Aroma is very malty, caramel, toffee, fruit. Flavor is like aroma and the alcohol really jumps out. Body is soft, full, creamy, smooth and round including the great carbonation. Finish is like flavor including alcohol. Reminds me of some sherries. Sipping beer. Be fun to try different vintages side by side. Excellent brew. Got this from good friend Ron Kittleson, formerly of La Crosse & now in Seattle. Thanks much, man."
"very drinkable, but this is definitely a beer to be sipped and savored. so good that i almost feel bad drinking it. ages very well, and you can bet i'll be saving my 08 and 09 versions for quite a while."
"Beer is thick and quite sweet. Not a lot of bitterness at the back but some caramel notes in the early and midpalate. Minimal carbonation. Tastes good. Drinkability suffers for me, its a little too heavy for me, probably a bad beer to start with. I think it would improve with age (duh). I'd drink it again."
"D - For it's strength I think this is extremely drinkable and this is a beer I typically split but am drinking alone this time, I am not complaining though."
"Pretty solid beer, every time I see a British beer like this that is a vintage or bottle conditioned I have to try it. So far they have yet to disappoint, they are always very tasty beers. If you see this a bottle of this I'd recommend grabbing it."
"definitely not something you're going to slam down at a bar, but very drinkable for the style."
"Ive had this in my collection for a while and finally decided after looking at the day outside todays the day this is the 2008 vintage bottle number 06723,it pours a deep toffee/amber hue with nice carbonation that leaves a creamy two finger head that recedes to a smog of lacing across the top,the smell is a mixture of strong caramel/toffee,raisins,whiskey and alcohol,it has a pleasant syrupy mouthfeel which is like a fine port with tastes of caramel,toffee,raisins,dark fruits and some cherry alcohol heat right at the end but not over the top by any means,its definately a pleasant brew to just kick back with next to the fireplace or on a nice cold night and will continue to buy the new vintage every year."
"Im.. just going to go drink this now. I bought it in california last year and was saving it for the right time. I strongly recommend this brew."
"Price = $7.99 at Joe Canal's"
"A nice hazy orange-rose-red color with smallish tan head that recedes quickly. Nose is pretty enticing, tart cherries, a bit of must, some yeastiness, sweet malt, and a bit of alcohol. Taste follows the nose, some big malty sweetness, a bit of a vinous character, cherries, yeast, alcohol. The flavors have mellowed out nicely. MF is a bit lacking, thin, though creamy. I wish it had a bit more body. Drinkability is surprisingly good for a robust, high ABV ale like this one. Good stuff from Fuller's, worth checking out."
"Notes - Its good just nothing special and maybe not worth the wait. Maybe this bottle was a little mistreated before I purchased it temperature wise but not the complex flavors I was expecting and I usually love everything Fuller's puts out."
"D - Nice drinking brew. Not one to drink a lot of, just have it first and enjoy the difference."
"Definitely an excellent English brew. They handle the big stuff well. I am very pleased with this. still curious as to how this tasted fresh... i'll have to wait for the time machine to come in the mail."
"This is a nice drinking brew. Not something to quaff, but I am enjoying more with each sip. It has an air of quality to it, and I feel like a beer of this stature should be sipped and not slopped down."
"Drinkability: Poor. Harsh aftertaste and strong, unmatched flavors made one bottle between two certainly enough to satisfy."
"Drinkability: Worth putting a few away for a while."
"D - Savor this slow, it's enjoyable. Not a session beer, and it's not meant to be."
"Cheers Ralphus!"
"Extremely drinkable for the content, can't feel the alcohol at all, and the sweetness and balance makes it very easy to drink. I'm going to have to re-try the 2009 bottles, and pick up some older ones at the Fullers' brewery. Possibly Fullers' best beer."
"D - Extremely drinkable for the style. Not too sweet. Well balanced. Simple beer that is very delicious. One of my favorite qualities about Fullers."
"D: A very nice beer from Fullers--which I think will benefit from another few years of cellaring, allowing the flavor to develop more and to smooth out the alcohol a bit more (although it is already very well hidden). As it is now, I much prefer their 1845, especially with the price difference."
"Appearance is a slightly cloudy reddish-amber with a creamy off-white head. Head bubbles up and dissipates quickly. Smell is wonderfully complex, a perfumey-sweet melange of cereal grains and pipe tobacco, with hints of coconut and bourbon. There is a definite twang of alcohol, but it is not unpleasant. Taste follows smell; it is very sweet and malty with a British biscuity quality, highly caramelized with a pleasing albeit subdued kick of bready sourness in the aftertaste. The hops are delicately bitter and serve mostly to balance the sweetness. Mouthfeel is exquisite, coming on thick and full but short of syrupy. It sort of thins out and creeps away with each swallow. Fantastic. Drinkability is high insofar as this beer goes down very warm and smooth, altough the flavors are too intense to call it sessionable. A lovely creation from Fullers. My favorite old-school English beer (or should I say Nectar of the Gods) is Thomas Hardy's Ale, and this is sort of like Thomas Hardy's kid sidekick."
"A sipper that I could easily do 2 or 3 of. A class act."
"This is a 2008 bottle, consumed 2/10. This is a cloudy orange-brown beer with a caramel and raisin smell. It has a rich caramel, cherry, vanilla, and dark fruit flavor, with a lingering, toasty, bittersweet finish. It's full bodied and sweet, without being sticky. I'm curious how this one ages."
"Sweet and a bit oxidized, it feels creamy with some mild bitterness from the residual Fuggles still kicking around. Fairly fruity and vinous. Full bodied sipper. Don't think i'd age it for this long in the future, i'm getting tired of old-tasting beer. It's mellowed a bit, but I could imagine that the apricot & floral notes would have been more vibrant in days past."
"Worth trying, i'm not 100% sold though."
"Final Thoughts: If you are a fan of brandy, maybe this will be your cup of tea. I however found this beer to be quite a disappointment. I'm not looking forward to that bottle of 2009. Maybe if I let it sit for a year I can trade it away later, because I really would not want to have this beer again."
"Very interesting ale. It's got a mind of its own!! Yet it remains easy to approach for anyone. Go get a few bottles and start aging some now."
"Impression: Fuller's Vintage is a necessary and enjoyable step along the way to fully appreciating the beauty of fine beer."
"Having had this beer many times, I agree with fullers that it certainly improves with age. I could see this being fine for another few years. Fullers is certainly a world class brewery that makes a number of great beers. This is no exception."
"D - Light everything here; flavor, aroma, feel. It makes for a drinkable old ale. Well crafted but I'd hope the fresher bottles would have had a bit more life to them aroma and flavor-wise."
"The complete lack of aroma and one dimensional flavor of this beer were disppointments, and I don't consider it worthy of the special packaging."
"Overall, I would say this is one of the most disappointing beers I've ever had. It is certainly not the worst, it really isn't even bad, but I'd drink Bud Light over this as a protest."
"This beer will be interesting in 3-5 years."
"D: A very nice beer at this point, but give it a couple of years properly cellared - I think it will evolve into a great beer."
"2004 vintage. Pours light brown with a white head. Aroma is caramel, brown sugar and some slight tartness. Flavor is similar with caramel malt, raisins, brown sugar and some alcohol. Medium, very creamy mouthfeel."
"D: a real treat"
"4/4/4.5/4/4"
"Flavor is very good. Complex, caramel, carbonation, a little creamy...and sweet. Very good beer...especially as it warms up."
"D-Definitly one to drink slowly and savor, alot more oxadized than I was hoping for that muddles some of the other flavors that would be present otherwise, with a beer this old some is to be expected, probably had to do with storage conditions, I would definitly like to try a younger version to compare."
"I've found a bottle of 2005 that I had stashed away. That's next."
"I was a little underwhelmed by the complexity to be honest. I thought it was gonna be a bit more. That being said, I definitely enjoyed it"
"500ml bottle, 2008 vintage, bottle number 149239. Pours a translucent golden-amber with about a half inch of khaki-colored head. Smells great, with sweet fruit (raisin, grape, apple), nut, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla... Toffee, caramel, brown sugar, dark chocolate, chocolate, nut, date, fig, raisin. Full-bodied bordering on viscous with moderate carbonation, combined with just a touch of alcohol warming makes this a sipper for sure, but super complex and balanced. Delicious, well worth the price. I'd love to see what this beer tastes like in a few years..."
"Given the abv, this is very pleasant on the palate; while alcohol can be tasted, it's not burning you up. A very well-crafted beer, stately from the bottle's appearance to the final sip, it feels well pulled-together, even when intended for a bit of age. I have one in the cellar, and will let it sit for a few years before cracking it."
"2009 500ml classy bottle pours a clear dark amber colour with a little carbination on a careful pour. The taste is of dark malts and sweet dark fruits with a mild hop touch. Very smooth with a sweet taste added to the end of it. The 8.5 abv% is very well hidden. This was my first Old Ale and it was quite interesting. A very solid beverage overall."
"D: This is an interesting beverage; I'm tempted to seek out an older one to find out how it does after a few years. But if it weren't for the fact that we're told to age it, I wouldn't immediately get that idea from tasting this brew. It has no overt alcohol tones, and it's pretty well-integrated already."
"D: A decent strong ale. It didn't particularly move me one way or another, though."
"3.5 - wasnt bad, but theyve definitely done better"
"Excellent beer, worth trying. I'm seeking out a few others to compare with this one date wise."
"- Overall a very decent brew.. but also slightly overrated..."
"Reccomended!"
"its a drinkable beer for the alcohol level it has"
"Pours an orange, caramel hue. A sweet butterscotch, woody flavor with some light fruit notes in the aroma. A dull taste of wood, molasses, unsweetened butterscotch, bitter oranges. The aftertaste is a dull, orange rind off flavor with tang that doesn't sit well with my palate. Light in body with little to no carbonation. This syrup, caramelized ale doesn't stand out among the rest of the pack."
"The mouthfeel is rich and smooth and creamy and the beer goes down atreat"
"I've liked all the Fuller's vintage ales that I've tried so far, but this 2008 batch may replace the 2004 as my favorite one to date. This is really delicious! I could drink more of these if it wasn't for the high 8.5% abv and the large size of the bottle to start with.  I have also tried the 2010 vintage and found it to be a bit sweeter with lots of toffee flavor, but otherwise similar to the other vintages."
"notes- this review is for a 2000 vintage tasted in 2004"
"Great sipping brew. Can't wait to try it aged (but I guess I'll have to). I can sit and sip this all night."
"Sessionability - not really. Great beer, but you're not going to handle a lot of these."
"Raisins; and some of that cider/grape juice I got in that aroma. Somewhat cloying sweetness to be honest, but still very enjoyable and unique. Became smoother as it warmed. An addition of toffee, caramel, and other sweet candies. I have one to cellar for a couple years though, so we'll see how that turns out."
"Drinkability: A nice drink to sip, maybe a little sweet after having an entire bottle. Very interested to see what this is like in a few year.s"
"MF&D - the beer is completely creamy, and the perfect body for an old ale. the body is really perfect on this guy, and the carbonation is just right for the style; the only complaints I have are that the carbonation makes the inherent sweetness of the beer a bit too much."
"Dark brown amber-maple syrup color with just a few beige bubbles on top. Lovely, refined aroma of caramel, brown sugar, toast and burnt marshmallows, cotton candy and nectarine. Smooth and fruity with notes of meringue, orange, lemon, and rum. Very tropical, in a way, like a proper mai tai infused with zesty hops. Sweet but balanced by a kick of alcohol and hops, quick in the finish with lingering malt syrup flavor. A fine digestif."
"Nice flavours, a definite must for the winter night/fireside sipper crowd."
"A pleasantly warming vintage ale, the 'old' character meshing well with the rest. Given the decent balance but slightly out of whack alcohol warming, I'm looking forward to seeing what a few years in the bottle have done to a couple of the earlier vintages of this that I've been saving, as they were big hits when I brought them to the office Christmas parties at the time."
"The alcohol presence is very muted in this one, can't tell at all from the taste that it's over 8% abv. I could definitely go for another right now."
"Solid appearance. Great nose full of many different components that seem to compliment each other, and balance each other out. Full flavor. Not as complex as the nose lets on, but great balance between the malt, and hops. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Bittered extremely well and balanced by a nice smooth, creamy characteristic. To me this is the best part of the beer. I enjoy the acidic nature of it offset by the smoothness. I don't love the mature flavors, I would imagine that it's better fresher but the mellowed mouthfeel is worth the few years. My bottle number is 140,956 out 150K. Maybe these last 10,000 are the bottom of the barrel and not the best offering. I will have to look for a fresh bottle to compare because this one frankly is a disappointment."
"A nicely drinkable brew. Although you don't really taste the alcohol presence so much, you feel its warming qualities easily enough. This will limit most persons intake with this one."
"C - What a charming beer! I can understand how the Brits would find this beer delightful almost any time of the year with cold, damp, rainy nights oft. Fuller's definitely brewed a splendid beer to style and allowed a level of exclusivity through limiting the production to 145,000, which still seems like a fair bit, though if you consider this beer is being produced for the worldwide market, not really."
"CHEERS!"
"Overall: Pretty smooth and easy drinking. My wife did not like. No problem, I easily finished hers off. A great beer for a celebration!"
"2008 Fullers Vintage Ale pours a slightly hazy golden copper with a thin head. The aroma is malty, light candied fruit, with some herbal, earthy hops. Malt is upfront in the flavor, but not overly sweet. More light fruity flavors with a crisp finish. The bitterness comes through in the finish as well, with more herbal, earthy hop flavor. The texture is creamy and the beer is very smooth and easy drinking for the size"
"Drinkability - very enjoyable pint for the 100th review and a cold, rainy spring day. I'll savour this for the next 45 min. and keep the 2 others I have of this for a special occasion in the future."
"D - Fantastic. Though I've had a lot of great beers during the journey, this is truly in the upper eschelon. Infinitely complex aromas and flavors make this a tough one to beat. I hope to be able to sample various vintages at various ages. I do wish I had more, but it looks like this might be a once in a lifetime beer for me. Such a thing is not meant to last!"
"Mouth is smooth and a bit oily. Drinks easy. I would like to see what this would do in a few more years."
"Easy to drink this is one I would like to sit on every few years."
"I enjoyed this one very much. It's no J.W. Lees Harvest Ale like I was kind of hoping for, but it's definitely worth picking up if you enjoy the English strong ales."
"Bitterness dominates again, but maybe in a more balanced way than I described in my most recent update. More of the fruit, not so much of the mustiness."
"06 vintage poured into a snifter. Epic ruby hue, perfectly clear with a big fluffy off-white head that leaves gobs of lacing. Aroma is boozy dark fruits and caramel/toffee with light accents of cherry cough drops and toast. Flavor is caramel with orange jelly and hints of cherry and wheat bread. The sweetness is somewhat tempered by an earthy hop note and a mild tannic character. Body is maybe a little thin for the wealth of flavors presented, but there's no trace of alcohol and the carbonation, while subdued, is appropriate. Very good beer."
"An excellent ale to have and to celler for years to come i'll age one for myself also."
"D- A sit down, kick off your shoes, and sit by the fire beer."
"Had this brew for super bowl. Great box and all that came with it. This one's a keeper for the shelf. Beer was very full flavored. Only wished I had bought another to let it age longer, as it may have had a smoother feel to it. Tasted a little young, but still amazing."
"D - This is one damn tasty barleywine. Increadibly easy drinking and satisfying."
"All in all, a proper, wonderful Old Ale. Cheers!"
"D - Well, it's a sipper, all right. It's too big a beer to be sessionable (which is probably not what Fuller's was going for anyhow), but would make a nice dessert beer or winter warmer."
"2008 vintage. Pours a rich amber, lighter than I expected for an old ale and with a yellowy white, 1 inch head. Glistening and clear. Smells of green grass, malt, ethanol. Sweet malty flavor, some hop bitterness. Malts are also laced with red cherries and hot alcohol. Hint of spicy/vegetal hop flavor. Mostly, its a big sticky malt bomb with a touch of fruit but it needs a bit more time on it still i think. Syrupy, heavy mouthfeel. I think this particular bottle was perhaps a little too new. I can see that it has potential, but it isn't really a well-rounded beer at this stage."
"It is a reddish color moderately dark beer with a thin english head. Smells of toffee. Has a great old ale taste characteristic of english beers. Very smooth. Almost syrupy body. Something to enjoy...or celebrate with!"
"D - Strong and robust, but enjoyable and fairly drinkable."
"This is the 05 vintage. Poured into tulip glass. Poured a handsome, deep earthy brown with a thin tan colored head that left minimal lacing. Solid malt aroma that has a touch of sweetness matched with notes of spice and soil. The flavor leaves me speechless. This is what ale tastes like in heaven. Full, smooth body that has the substance of the British Empire. I could spend hours with this beer and not get bored. Those people who say they don't like British style Ales are fools. A true classic for the ages."
"Good and worth trying, I think it's over-priced and they talk it up way too much."
"A very nice example of an old ale. The mouthfeel may throw off someone that's new to this style but I think that this beer can and will age very well if you have the patience. It's quite drinkable now and it reminds me of how the English are skilled at making strong beers that are delicious whether you drink them fresh or aged. I appreciate that craftmanship."
"Drinkability is excellent and this beer is highly recommended. A bit pricey, but I certainly will be purchasing this one again."
"Drinkability- Though part of me wishes we could've had the patience to age this one a while, It's so rewarding to drink it now, i'm almost tempted to pick up another couple, maybe to drink, maybe to age."
"Have 2 more of these to age for a while."
"Taste is strong malty and has a warming alcoholic feeling. The malts are palemalt-y combined with dark caramel malts, which makes the beer into one to cellar, because these dark malts add a bit of a rough edge to the beer. The yeast adds a light fruity taste, which makes the beer distinctly British. Mouthfeel is pleasant and smooth."
"Overall, I was really pleased with this beer. I'm very fond of this style and it didn't disappoint the slightest bit. I'm glad that I bought a few and I look forward to seeing how it develops."
"Pours a bright amber color with a small, bubbly off0white head that left some small rings of lacing down the glass. Lots of carbonation bubbles coming up from this one. Smell is full of caramel, some Belgian-like yeastiness, and some fruitiness, almost like spiced apples. This aroma reminds me of several BSPAs I've had in the past, which is odd since it's supposed to be an Old Ale, but I like it. Taste is chock full of caramel covered apple, a bit of earthiness, some woody flavors, some booziness, lots of ripe fruit, some herbal, lightly bitter hops, lightly sweet, fairly dry on the finish. Very interesting and complex and more subtleties comes out as it warms. Medium bodied, crisp on the finish, lots of carbonation tingle. Becomes a little smoother and easy to drink as it warms, but the alcohol becomes more prevalent. A nice tasting beer and I'll be sure to start aging a bottle of this every year, as I think an aged bottle would definitely taste a little better than a fresh one."
"D: rather nice for a 9 year old...old ale. good drinkability."
"I was expecting a lot more from this beer."
"this vintage's phenols detract overall. maybe a few more years will mellow things out."
"I look forward to 2005 version."
"2007, cellared for the past year+. pours deep orange with amber, light head retention. smell is light floral hops and very light malts. i catch sweet light caramel scent. the taste is very sweet, hints of honey and caramel with a subtle floral hop presence but as the hops fade toward the finish, light malts are exposed. carbonation is medium and picks up towards the finish although this enhances the flavor though. there is no hiding the alcohol though. unlike fullers regular line which are typically almost half the ABV. overall, a great beer and i look forward to trying the rest of my 07's over the next 3 years."
"D - A sipper, but what a sipper it is. Goes down easily for its strength...a world-class British ale."
"Year 2008. The aroma is rich and sweet with malt, caramel, light fruit, alcohol, lemon, and vanilla. The appearance is amber with a small but foamy head. The flavor is like the aroma but very alcoholic even for a beer at 8.5%. The palate is a little thin but OK. The aftertaste is soapy. Even though this beer has some good qualities the whole is not better than the sum of the parts."
"drinkability is wonderful; the brew is quite complex on the palate. the flavors get more potent with a bit of warming, while the brew warms the palate and leaves a satisfying aftertaste, making it a great winter brew. cheers!"
"Pours a very clear copper hue with a low amount of carbonation. Topped by a white head about 3/4 of an inch thick that settles down to a nice little layer. Smell reminds me of a slightly bigger version of their ESB, toffee, bready/biscuity malts, low amounts of earthy hops. The taste is unexpected, much bigger than the nose. Full of sweeter darker malts, bits of apricot and caramel mingle with a nice amount of carbonation that mix nicely with some spicy/earthy hops. Very well balanced beer, I will be curious to see how well it ages. Even thou it is a rather new release I did not come across any yeast sediment as I poured it out, interesting?"
"Pours a ruby red with a nice nose filled with floral notes accompanied by malted barley. Taste is sweet and a bit peppery with the classic Fuller's taste. This is a rich and complex beer. Bitter and smooth a classic!."
"D - Good, not sure I could drink a full bottle though."
"Drinkability is all day long. I wish a true pub in the area would carry something even remotely akin to this brew."
"One of my favorite old ales, and my favorite beer from england"
"Split a bottle of this with my dad. Pours an amber, copper color with not much of a head. Earthy tones in the nose with a little bit of sugar. Taste is complex. Traces of dried fruit, sugar, caramel, and a little bit of bread. Moderate carbonation plus a good flavor make this beer very drinkable. Good stuff."
"Pours a reddish brownish color body. Clearish, with an okay sized white head, but soon diminishing. Dark fruit aroma, fig, raisin. Some mustiness, and a little alcohol too. Cherry too. Some hops balance the nose, but not a lot. Not a very strong aroma. Some coffee/toffee tastes. Muted taste, some fig taste. Some dark cherry. But there's not much flavor present. Okay mouthfeel, carbonated. This one might not have aged as well in my fridge."
"Poured into Samuel Smith pint glass. Nice clear deep reddish amber color. About 3"" smooth off white head, falls pretty quickly but leaves nice slightly rocky cap. Some pretty heavy lacing remaining through the drink. Aroma is slightly fruity, spicy, with caramel and cinnamon. Taste is slightly fruity, spicy, peppery, a little woody and grassy on the finish. Medium-full bodied, feels smooth on entry, a little carbonation spike on the back. Chewy, spicy finish. Highly drinkable but most enjoyed in sips. Alcohol is well hidden, but present on the finish. Very smooth, well balanced. Ages great. Glad I have one more in the cellar."
"D: A perfect nightcap after a heavy holiday meal. The presence of family made the experience all the more memorable. I may very well snatch a few more of these up before the shelf is empty at my local store."
"This one is pretty delicious. I might have to revisit this review with a bottle under better conditions."
"Another simply excellent beer from Fuller's."
"The taste is quite similar to what you expect when you first smell this beer. Lots of honey and lightly rosted malts which are balanced by the fine English hops. A really filling and luxorious beer that seem to be really good material for cellaring!"
"D= Complex and wonderful. This was an incredible beer in which the ABV was dangerously hidden. Very drinkable! A moderately expensive ale that was worth every penny I paid for it."
"D: Definitely an enjoyable beer where repeat experiences can't be in disdain."
"Drinkability: a tasty, well-crafted beer. Wouldn't want to drink many, though, as this one blew me off my ass. A good sipper for hop and ale lovers, perfect for the winter time."
"Clear mahogany pour with a creamy off-white head. Malt, dark fruit, and hops make up the aroma. Velvety mouthfeel. The sweetness of the caramel malt hits you first, with raisins and hop bitterness to follow. Dry, earthy finish. Much better than last year."
"This bottle happened to be number 81,220, bottled in 2006 and opened in summer of 2008 while my then-girlfriend was breaking my heart. Thank God it was a muscular 8.5%! Out of the bottle this beer was a garnet red color with a two finger tan head. Lots of tiny visible carbonation. The retention and the lacing were stellar! The aroma was sweet and pungent, dark fruit, raisins and zesty alcohol esters. The flavors were also sweet and enjoyable, toffee and candy sugar, ripened figs, caramel malt, hints of spices and an herbal hop finish that added balance to an otherwise busy palate. Punchy but non-pretentious. The mouthfeel was very smooth, the carbonation good and the body medium/full. A challenging but rewarding experience."
"D: Takes some time to drink and you can feel it run down your throat. Satisfying nonetheless!"
"i would kill to have in cask."
"2005 vintage. This poured a semi-hazy rusted copper color with light tan head. It smelled like malt and yeast balanced nicely with citrus hops. It had a subtle but fairly complex flavor of caramel malt with a mix of hops and a bit of dark fruit. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation and a bitter but mellow aftertaste. Overall this was very good for a standard ale. If it was a little hoppier (a pale ale or IPA), it would have been perfect!"
"It's a great beer when it's fresh, but I can tell that the alcohol can use a little time to settle down. One of these days I'll buy a new one and cellar it myself, where I know the conditions."
"D - This is definitely not intended to be a session beer; but rather sipped to enjoy all the nuances. I'm not a big fan of most high ABV beers, but this strikes a nice balance between flavor and ABV. I'm putting two on my Christmas list. One to drink and one to cellar!"
"Nice to try one of these just after bottling. It can only get (even) better from here on in...the other bottles in my cellar shall bear witness."
"Mouthfeel was thin but not too thin. Dangerously drinkable at the ABV, to be honest I couldn't put the thing down. I may have to buy another one and wait another 4 years!"
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, a very nice beer."
"Though Nick and I (Jorge) each rated this beer differently per category, our scores turned out exactly the same: 3.55"
"D - I enjoyed this one more and more as it went on and was sorry to see it end. I'm a hop guy but you've got to respect the excellent simplicity that you can get out of a seasoned English brewery like Fullers. Well done mates."
"Overall, A highly recommended beer. Well above average. And it would interesting to see how it ages!"
"D- Certainly a sipper. The problem I think is the alcohol. Its only 8.5%. DFH 120 has almost 3 times the alcohol and yet is pleasantly hidden. I understand its a different style, but even a more similar style Barleywine does a better job. Its just not that balanced. Good but not a great job. Probably would not get again."
"The taste is stronger and very complex, rich, and satisfying. It has a lot of fruit and spice up front, with port, caramelized stewed fruit, a hint of anise, a hint of pekmez (Turkish fruit ""molasses""), a hint of a nice aged rum. It's thick and ""chewy"" but lively and zesty. Though sweet, it beautifully develops into a zesty, spicey-bitter finish. Alcohol is noticeable, barely, in the warmth, etc. It is amazingly smooth considering the flavours and strength."
"Goes down fairly easy,more of a sipper though,nothing i would want more than a bottle at a time of."
"What a treat! Serious but delicious yet complex. One of the best beers that I've ever experienced!"
"A 2005 bottle that is just great. I shared this with my Dad on my birthday, and I could not imagine a better setting on a cool Fall late afternoon. I want more."
"With the possible exception of Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout, this may be my favorite English beer ever. Everything good about English beer (full body, smooth, great balance) with a higher ABV (I love big beers!). I love their ESB and porter, but this takes it to another level. I don't notice the alcohol at all in the taste, but I do feel it a little. The typical caramel notes are there, with an apple pie-like spice (I happen to have homemade apple pie to eat when I'm done, too!). Smooth and warming. World class."
"Very drinkable in taste, slightly limited by alcohol. Good overall flavor, but kind of weak. I'm sure some age would develop the depth of old ale flavor, but there isn't too much there to work with as it seems now. Not to downplay it being a good beer, but I'm not blown away."
"Had a fairly thick mouthfeel and tasted of caramel malts and alcohol."
"Poured a deep red with lots of carbonation and a huge head. Taste is all English malt, a little alcohol twinge and a tart finish. Dried fruits, very sweet and super malty. Mainly notes of toffee, nuts fruits. ABV is just right but the taste was not to my liking. Good beer but not my fav Old Ale."
"Drinkability is good. This a very flavorful and surprisingly easy drinking old ale. Not sure if this would have a ton of legs to last more than a couple more years. But this is a tasty and a smooth flavorful brew, that is well worth trying. Good stuff!"
"2007 vintage. Pours a clear slightly reddish copper with a medium sized persistent off-white head. Lacing on the surface and sides. Very nice malty aroma- caramel and fruit notes. Apples. Taste is sweet with lots of British malt character. Biscuity, again caramel and lots fruit notes. Some herbal hops in the finish. Light bitterness in the finish as well. Slightly minerally very british ale character. Full bodied with a light carbonation. Very drinkable. Tasty and balanced and a great beer overall."
"O - Overall, this beer is just where it should be at 4 years. It's held up quite well and continues to have some aging potential. I'll need to pick some bottles up to open annually to see how it progresses."
"D - This is a very good ole ale. Very sweet and delicious."
"Aftertaste of british malt and earthy hops, absolutely wonderful... can't wait to try the next bottle in a few years."
"2006 Vintage. Clear reddish color with a frothy head and some lacing. Aroma is fragrance, floral, some alcohol and caramel malt. Malty flavor at first with some dark fruits, overall a little bit winey and finishes with hops and slight bitterness. Light numbing. Very nice beer."
"Warms the palate some, medium/full body, light effervescence on tip of tongue. Lingering yeast/malt/smoke aftertaste. Damned fine stuff."
"I bought one to take home...to live on the legend...If I was a English and I was I beer...I'd be Fuller's Vintage 2004..."
"A nice looking bottle with the classic Fuller's minimalist labeling comes packaged in a red box which makes you feel like you're getting something special. This is the 2006 bottling and says bottle number 80923. Pour is a dark brown with hues of red and is completed with a one-finger off-white head that recedes fairly quickly leaving a spotty lacing behind. Smell is robust and complex with chocolates, rasins, malts, grapes and caramel. Taste is exceptional with big complex and sweet malts, dark fruits, dark chocolate and a definite acidic essence perfect for the style. Toward the end a pleasurable bitterness is introduced. Mouth-feel is medium to full bodied. Carbonation is active and leads to a crispness toward the end of a pull which complements the creamy middle. This one goes down pretty smooth despite the high alcohol content that does leave a slight yet welcome burn when all is said and done."
"Quite cognac-like beer that would suite me better in a purple smoking jacket in a leather chair by the fire on a cold winter night as I contemplate it and the stock market."
"I've had this before but not rated it-This needs to age a little more and I think the taste will smooth out."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" tan head above the orangey amber brew. Head lasts well, with average lacing, not unexpected for the style. Aroma is lightly of sweetness and fruits. Taste is sweet malts with twinkles of fruitiness, and a warming alcohol close, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent for the style, very creamy in the mouth, which just helps it go right down the gullet. Nice one here, could have even better if I had any patience. Oh well."
"A very respectable brew - the English idea of an ""extreme beer," perhaps. Very proper. I wouldn't mind trying some of the other vintages, both to see how they differ as well as to see when this beer ""peaks."""
"The appearance of this beer was awesome. Very dark amber, and orange, with a nice head. Smell was strong citrus, fruit and alcohol. Taste was citrusy and sweet. Lost of fruit and good sweetness. Mouthfeel was very good, very smooth. Overall an outstanding beer a very nice treat to enjoy. Well worth the price."
"The drinkability of this beer is off-the-charts outstanding, but leaves me wondering what proper aging will do to this Tenth Anniversary edition. How could it be better than it is right now?!? I only know one way to find out, but I find it very hard to believe I could keep my greedy hands off of any of these little beauties I'd hypothetically lay down for prosperity. Outstanding. Outstanding. Outstanding."
"Great brew, especially if you not in the mood for the super thick molasses of American Barley Wines"
"As a result, I'm bumping up my review score, but weighing it between the 1999 version and the 2007 version. I'd probably give the 2007 around an A (4.3) and a 1999 version a B+(3.95)"
"D: This is very drinkable beer even for its high alcohol content and I am definately going to try another one in a year or so."
"A very nice old ale. I've got another I'm holding on to for a bit to see how it ages. A bit pricey (I paid $6) but definitely worth it."
"The smell is of wonderful dark fruit and alcohol. There is a hint of noble british hops and sweet malt. It pours a wonderful, brilliant copper hue. The lacing, head, and carbonation are all very fitting for an English ale. The mouthfeel is very full, rich, bold, and creamy. This sits wonderfully on your palate; you almost don't want to swallow. But, when you do taste it, what a treat. The taste is a wonderful complex combination of sherry oak, brandy sweetness, and tart dry fruit, but cleans up exceptionally well due to the perfect hop balance and aging. After a few sips, the flavors become more and more evident, as does the alcohol. A wonderful beer."
"I wish I had bought two of these to let the other one rest another year. A good beer all around."
"I was pretty sure that this impressively packaged beer would be good, but I didn't expect the masterpiece that it turned out to be. If you're searching for an outstanding cellarable brew, your search is now over. Bottom line: Fuller's Vintage Ale is a timeless classic that is the gold standard for the English old ale style."
"D: Again, similar to the 2004... nice to sip at. Enjoy on a quiet evening, perhaps with some fine cheeses."
"Pours a clear copper color with light offwhite head. Very strong fruity, cherry to strawberry candy like smell to it. Reminded me of the hard strawberry candies with the gooey centers. Taste, however is quite mild and bland with some fruity maltiness . Not too offensive, some guazy flavors and super tame, I thought."
"I wasn't overly impressed by this beer. My bottle was a Vintage 2007 (No 02876) so it didn't have much time to age. I would like to try this beer after it has had more time to age and mature."
"Poured from a 16.9oz. bottle into a snifter. Amber color. Big head that dissipates to a small layer of foam. Aroma of caramel, plums, a little spice and alcohol. Taste of caramel, spice, and alcohol. Black licorice on the finish. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Ultimately there's too much alcohol in the flavor profile for me, making this an okay beer."
"Drinkability/Overall: A finely made Old Ale, not too complex, but hits all the right notes with a traditional English flare, though surprisingly boozy for only 8.5%."
"Recommended..."
"Recommended. I actually bought this one recently - so it may not have been stored well - but it was enjoyable. If the 05 batch is faring like this in general, I only see it doing downhill from here. With that said, it is still doing pretty well right now and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."
"That being said, it doesn't hold a candle to the sample I had a couple night's ago of Rudge's 2006 Burleywine!"
"The taste was ok. I expected a little bit more. It was not too strong and had a relatively balanced taste. There was no specific flavor or taste that overpowered the palate. Overall, it was a decent beer. It did get better as it warmed up."
"Oh yeah I get green apples too."
"Other comments: This is a well-crafter ale that would be REALLY great to cellar for a good, long while. Perhaps 5-6 bottles to taste over a period of 10 or so years."
"Overall, it's a decent strong ale, but a little too harsh on the alcohol and sweetness for me."
"2005 vintage. dark orange with a light tan head that fades quickly and leaves just a little lace... pretty much what old ales do. nose and taste are very similar. rum soaked raisins, orange marmelade, some leather, sweet and slightly smokey/oaky, and a faint hop character that managed to hold itself together. this bottle at least is very clean and unturned tasting. nice medium full body. minimal syrupy character that old ales often have. great warming finish. not as complex as an old thomas hardy's, but delightful and much easier to drink."
"This is embarrassing...having shelved this for a special occassion, I missed opening this for my wedding, grad school graduation, my novel's completion and the birth of my first son... and now it's five years past its prime! Oh well, here goes... extreme fruitiness, almost lambic in approach--fear of vinegration after seven years? light brown body with a rich, creamy head that holds strong... lacing is like cirrus clouds...creamy and slightly effervescent palate--a bit smooth; plays softly on the back of the tongue...grapes and citrus sweets...balanced...a bit warm at the finish, but not at all harsh...a bit sour in patches too...8.5 per cent alcohol! attacks late, but evens out... this aged beyond the expectations of what should have been...worth the wait, even if only for a casual evening at home celebrating only the end of a week's work!"
"Pours out a glowing orange sucker with loads of fat bubbles climbing towards the head that sits billowing over the rim of the glass. Really hot alcohol hits the nose first off. Underneath is honey, white raisins, earthy hops, and what seems to be an odd banana-esque phenolic (?) edge. Flavor kicks off with a sweetness that tastes like a half-and-half mix of honey and simple syrup. Very delicate malt taste. The esters bring a good deal of fruitiness: white grape, green prickly pear, fuji apple, and pear. There is a touch of alcohol warmth which lends a spiciness to this. With the combination of alcohol and apple, this kind of reminds me a bit of calvados. Hops lay pretty well low, but off a soft finishing bitterness and some floral and herbal tones. Mouthfeel is full and smooth. Just a touch sticky. Drinkability is solid, but I kind of wish this came in a smaller serving."
"Full, almost creamy body stands out immediately. SOme warming alcohol. Finishes so dry. This must need a bit of age to be effective for me."
"2005 Vintage. Special thanks to ilovedarkbeer (from ratebeer) for bottle #50165. Served at cellar temps. Aroma is light bready malts, light orange hops, and light doughy yeast. as well as red whine, raisin, raspberry, and ginger. Pours a hazy toasted amber-brown. Taste is of date and is nearly a Madera/Brandy mix. It is very rich and savory. Goes down creamy and slightly fizzy with a strongish alcohol warming on the end. Great beer."
"Pours a clear darker amber wiht firm brown hues. Fairly thin off white head forms and falls. When I first popped this one, I got a whiff of something and thought someone had put sherry in my beer. Unfortunately, there wasn't much left to give when I took a sniff of my glass. Flavor has some minor caramel tones. The alcohol is noticeable, but it gives a nice burn. Almost like I was sipping on bourbon. Mild earth tones and wood on the back side. Feel is smooth, but the liquid is thick. Not a detracting feature though. Very nice to drink, but the scores reflect the 2006 I had, so for this one knock off .5 for both taste and drinkibility. It's the alcohol. Just a wee bit too much."
"Mouthfeel-malty with a light hop profile that was probably a little more pronounced when young. Good solid ale flavor, almost like a Strong or an Old ale. I was expecting something heavier maybe, but I am NOT disappointed. Solid no-nonsense ale here and it was very tasty for 8.5%. This would pair well with beef, chicken and a darker fish like salmon."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is perfect. It has a rich, malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. It's warm with a wonderful sweet malt aroma. It has a nice fig/fruity aroma as well. The taste is great! It has a warm and velvety feel with loads of malt complexity . It's got a tremendous burnt toffee flavor that warms on the way down. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It's probably one of the most drinkable old ales I've tried. It's full flavored and easy drinking even at 8.5%."
"Drinkability - This brew is easy to drink down for it 8.5%ABV. It has a great taste and scent, even if they are completely different from one another. I can't wait to see what the other vintages I own taste like."
"D: (4) It's good, but not my favourite vintage."
"Overall, this is beer is quite average. How can 1845 rock so much while Vintage Ale is so lame? Is my bottle old? Mistreated? I have kept it in my cellar for a couple years but I fail to remember where I purchased it; Missouri I would guess. I am quite bummed but if I see another bottle I might considered trying it again as Fullers is an excellent brewery and this beer seems out of character for them."
"Overall - A pretty good old ale that could definitely do with a couple of years in the cellar.... still definitely worth trying fresh though..."
"Tastes very much like it smells. Lots of warming alcohol, hoppy, fruity and a good clean malt bill. Another great beer from Fuller's."
"Whatever; ten years or one year, this is a damn fine brew!"
"Bottle from the LCBO. Golden body with a rapidly dissipating white head. Caramel malts, wood and grass on the nose. Very nice mouthfeel - smooth with a good level of carbonation. The taste is a symphony of caramel, honey, spices and berries, but seems to be lacking something that would push it over the edge into a masterpiece. Im sure a few years in a cellar would work wonders for this."
"d: overall a very enjoyable brew that i found better than the competition thomas hardy's and a great warming ale for a cold english night."
"Well balanced and wonderfull example of style."
"Pours a rich amber/red into a brandy snifter with a big tan head. Smells of alcohol, and a hint of brown sugar. Taste is very malt dominated. Has a very oak like character with hints of caramel. Slightly earthy as well, with good bitterness from the hops. The finish is very dry, I was quite surprised. This beer shares several of the same characteristics with a Scotch Whiskey IMO. Mouthfeel is full and rich, with pretty high carbonation levels. Usually this type of beer would take a long time to finish, but it is exceptionally smooth, and an easy drinker for such a high alcohol content. This isnt the type of beer you drink every day, but for special occasions it is fantastic to sip on."
"To hell with that - if supplies would cooperate, I'd have this at least weekly, and perhaps hourly."
"D = Only marking this down because it needs more time to age, this is a brilliant beer that I will eagerly drink again."
"Definitely a 'sipping' beer, to be enjoyed slowly & with a good friend. I enjoyed it immensely & will definitely look for another bottle!"
"D: A good beer from Fuller's, I didn't like it as much as the '04 which I had when it was two years old, that one was much smoother, with more complex malt characters. Overall, a nice old ale, I'll buy a bottle or two every year from one of my favourite English breweries."
"2004 Vintage, No 85886. Pours a cloudy brown color with golden highlights. The head was average and left an off-white ring around the glass. The smell is of wine grapes and raisins, a rather faint aroma. The taste is of a smooth velvet malt base, aged hops, some subtle dark fruit flavors, all of which blend into a nice mellow flavor profile. Has some wine characteristics. The feel is moderate to full and the carbonation is soft, the brew finishes sweet as the vintage would suggest. A rather smooth yet still actively carbonated old ale. Has port characteristics but still reminds me of a beer. #300"
"Not as good as I expected, overall. Pours a cloudy brown with no head at all. Aroma is dominated by sweet malts and slightly toasty brown sugar. Flavour is... odd. Reminds me of Glossette Raisins, although nobody else who tasted it agreed with me. Ear-warming alcohol makes this an after dinner beer, or something for a cold evening."
"Wish I had a time-machine!"
"Pours a gorgeous ruby orange color, with strong head that lasts for a few minutes. Initial tastes of sweet malt aroma, hint of alcohol at the end. It's got the musky apricot flavor that I'm really starting to enjoy, with a tartness that balances out the sweet. Great carbonation, leaves the mouth feeling crisp. Delicious brew, great burst of flavor which doesn't linger too long."
"At 8.5%, you can't drink more than one of these and still drive home. Frankly, they're not good enough to warrant the price. I have one more 2004/2005 pair to sample in a side-by-side, and then I will probably look for other years of this brew, in hopes that they are better. Pretty pricey for what you get."
"An excellent English ale. I've tried this fresh and aged for a few years, and I actually prefer it fresh for the more pronounced hop character."
"2005 vintage. Pours a brownish orange with only a thin head that fades to thin ring fairly quickly. The nose is wonderfully filled with brandied fruitcake, dry malt, and oak. Taste is exceptional. Obviously loaded with malt, but its very dry and a bit woody as well as vinous and loaded with notes of sherry and cognac. Some slight figgy and molassy sweetness as well, but only in the background. Not hotly alcoholic, but instead fruitcake like notes of liquor. Delicious, and quite well integrated. Slightly bitter wood notes on the finish. Mouthfeel is very dry, slightly tannic, but with well structured soft tannins that don't bite. Very smooth and creamy. This is one of the better old ales I've had and calls for a leather chair, a fire, and a good book."
"Drinkability/notes: Superbly crafted, and exceptional in every way. It is a pity that I may not be able to find this superb ale again."
"D - Good beer, I like it. An above average treat."
"Wow, one of the best old ales Ive had, not a mission to drink, not easy, but doable. Hope to get some more of this and see how it does."
"A delicious beer, fresh or aged. I've found it deteriorates if kept longer than 2 or 3 years, though."
"M/D: Extremely dry (needed to be said again). Little carbonation. Even when opening the bottle, low carbonation was evident. A definate sipper but something that could be enjoyed 2-3 at a time given you have the money, but should probably be enjoyed 1 at a time."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a clean finish. This is a classic."
"= Being my first fullers vintage i am very interested in trying more of them == Not to bad of a brew considering its the lowest rated vintage...."
"M&D: the texture is flawless; after 8 years of ageing this bottle develops a most delicate fizzy body befitting for a strong ale (or barley wine), and the body is just moderate at most! The only pity is that almost the more exciting hoppy and yeasty flavours have somehow worn off during the years, but the end result is all the same satisfying. My opinion: don't drink it if you are not prepared to embrace a subtle pint!"
"Nice soft fruit taste, some date and ripe apple. Again, strong flavor but very clean. Seems to hint at lasting a while with lingering aftertaste, but finishes really crisp. Sweet malt seems to die down just when it gets overpowering. A lot like North Coast's Old Ale, but this one seems to drink easier...not sure if that's good or bad."
"O: Definitely a very complex and interesting brew. I'm guessing the age muted some of the flavors which makes this very complex yet subtle on some levels. Moe likely muted the hop character and brough out some of the deeper flavors. Overall it was impressive."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Soft and effortless with regard to texture... the rolling efferfescence eases nicely into a smooth, slick swallow. A real treat, complement it with a full flavored aged cheese as I will next time."
"Drinkability is pretty good, as is this beer. If it were a bit cheaper and didn't come in a cardboard box, I would be tempted to buy this more often."
"This is a vintage 2004 bottle. Number on the label says that it is bottle number 89505. Poured into a sniffer a honey color with reddish hues. Head was large at first, but soon became smaller, with good retention. The aroma held plenty of alcohol, and a backing of fruit and chocolate. Flavor had some husky grains, followed by fruit, and then ending with a sort of bitter, taste bud numbing effect. Mouthfeel was relatively medium, with a hint of carbonation. Drinkable? Yes, but one was more than enough for me. The last time I had this it was a new bottle, so I honestly can't remember the differences brought on by age. I might see myself picking this vintage year up again and putting it in the basement for a few more years to mature. Cheers"
"Outstanding!"
"D: This is no everyday beer, but its character makes it worthy of the rarity for these vintage batches. Its composition has a distinctly English quality, which makes it all the more interesting to see it aged. This is so relaxed that it makes for easy sipping, and after maturing, it's developed a uniquely mellow flavor."
"I put 8 of these away back in 2004 and this is the first one I've had. Why did I wait so long. This is an incredible beer. Heavy malt, toasted, nutty, light yeast, dough tawny port, nutmeg aromas. Nice frothy head. Mostly clear, but a littel opaque, reddish-brown color. Lots of dark fruit in the taste."
"Just a hint of that classic fullers yeast flavor in this beer. It's just so big and so hoppy. It's hard to know what to think of this beer as it's going to change so much in years to come. Overall though, a really nice sipper that I wouldn't mind keeping loads of in my cellar to pull out throughout the year."
"2006 bottle. The first half pours an uninspired medium gold with no head, lots of carbonation, no lacing. Light sweet hop aroma. First taste knocks my head back with sugary sweetness. It gets better, but it still remains quite sweet all the way through. This is the second beer in a row that I'm judging as too sweet - after the Sam Adams Double Bock from yesterday. The alcohol is noticeable - and rather welcoming, I must say. This was my first of this series, though I didn't let it age since I am about to move house."
"Overall just a wonderful flavor and a nice sipping beer. High ABV and alcohol flavor prevents extended drinking, but nevertheless a terrific drinking experience."
"this beer is a marvel. Great balance of malts, mainly caramel with a faint bitterness and alcohol presence to balance. I could go on and on about this beer, but really just try it. I will buy it again. It's a great beer from one of my favorite styles. I love old ales and this really hits the spot. Go try it. I wish it was year round. If it was I'd have a shelf on my fridge for it."
"Overall, I regret opening this one as soon as I did. The building blocks for a wonderful ale were all there. It just needed to go to its room and play with its toys for a year before coming back out. Next one will be treated better."
"I have to give it a 5 on drinkability. It's always there and always a perfect finish to the night."
"This is simple a perfect brew when aged (or at least the 2004 is). I am giving the againing all the credit for the 2004 in this score. This beer apperntly HAS to be aged at least 3 years. I really mean this. Don't even DARE drink this until it's been aged this long. The 05 and 06 were simply not in the same league."
"This is a nice beer, I was not expecting this to be as nice as this already. It could clearly use more edge, but some of the previous releases were too cloying when young; this one is not quite there, though it is fairly sweet."
"D - Nice beer, the best Ive had from fullers. For $6 at the leon pub its a deal. Oh yeah, and the drinkability, I give it a 4"
"Good hop in the aftertaste, quite earthy."
"One of the most drinkable old ales I've had. This is really nice to sip on."
"2005 vintage, bottle #65614. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a brown/amber color with an inch and a half off-white head. Lacing and head retention are OK. It smells like dark fruit (figs, raisins), caramel and overall sugary sweet, spicy and malty. It tastes like dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar and also a bit of an earthy taste. There's also a slight bitter finish, but the beer is mostly malty and sweet. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and a little bit creamy. Drinkability is good, the beer is smooth and not hard to drink at all. I wish I would have bought another bottle to age. But overall, I thought this was good. I enjoyed it."
"Taste is amazing! Right of the bat, strawberry jelly and grapes, cream and biscuits. Huh, sounds like a fantastic breakfast spread. Alcohol is only noticable after significant warming. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Slightly dry in the finish with a touch of bitterness. One the best brews I've had to date. I'm interested to see how the other vintages compare."
"Certainly agree with the recommendation to lay this beer down for a few years. This beer promises greatness with syrupy sweet amber malts and a soft hop presence. Complexity results from the sweet malts, bready, yeasty flavors and textures. While compounded harshly with strong alcohols, this beer will prove to melt and improve greatly with a little age. I look forward to editing this review and rating when this beer matures properly."
"What a great day! What a masterpiece!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a moderate carbonation that gives this a nice smoothness, and helps give this a dangerously high drinkability."
"The taste was well-balanced, starting with a malty, boozy beginning (almost like a Scotch ale). The sweetness took on an almost burnt, carmelized quality. Bitter hops at the end finished nice and dry. Medium to full mouthfeel and fantastic overall drinkability for a ""young"" vintage ale. It already hides the 8.5 per cent ABV well  I'm looking forward to an exceptionally smooth brew if I can manage to keep my hands off my cellar-bound bottles."
"The mouthfeel is what separated this beer for me. As a novice beer advocate this mouth was very unique. I really enjoyed this beer and if it were cheaper I would drink it more often."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and somewhat oily. Mildly carbonated."
"Fuller brew some of the best examples of English ale and this has to be their best offering. Makes me wish I still lived down the road from the brewery..."
"Comes in a classy red box. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark amber/brown with a small fizzy head that quickly disappears. The aroma is sweet malt and dark fruits that is almost unpleasantly metallic and alcoholic. The taste is malty with some caramel and a dry, spicy and boozy finish from the alcohol. This one definitely needs some aging. I found it to be rather harsh and unpleasant when consumed fresh and I struggled to finish the whole thing."
"Drinkability: This ale is very authoritative. It demands that you sit down and enjoy it slowly, every last drop. Reminds me of a younger barley wine. Very enjoyable and satisfying. This is a true English master piece."
"D - Style-wise, I can't really comment since this might be the first old ale I've had. On it's own, this is clearly not a chuggin' beer. It's big, tasty, and warming, but not quite what I expected."
"2004 bottle consumed 01/30/2007. nice ruby red color with a nice white head that faded quickly. The smell was very nice and reminded me of raisins or plums. The taste was very complex and difficult to pick out exact flavors but fruit came to mind. The mouthfeel was smooth and the drinkability was awesome. I really can;t tell the difference between an old ale and a barleywine. I thought this was an English style barleywine. Anyway, I have a couple more bottles of this and I will probably not crack another until 2010."
"Insanely drinkable for an ale of 8.5% alcohol. No alcohol harshness or even warmth. Highly recommended, and definately sessionable if one can manage to put a few of these away and then be recklessly decadent enough to consume them. Its hard to imagine this gem not appealing to craft beer lovers or novices alike, although its delicate, floral notes may leave the hop hardened lovers of hop bombs wanting. A fanfreakingtastic brew!"
"Poured into a chalice, a nice slightly cloudy grape/amber color, nice carbonation, nice one plus finger creamy off-white head, lots of islands and sticky lacing left behind. The nose is sweet/malty, belgian yeasty, prunes, slight cinimmon, and slight caramel. The taste is sweet/malty, slightly fruity, slight alcohol touch, with a nice dry finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, very tasty, this is an awesome brew, wish I could get this again."
"2004 edition."
"Drinkability: Its drinkable, even without much age under its belt. We'll see how my second bottle does in a couple of years..."
"The beer pours a nice clear brown/gold color that looks nice with no head and a little lacing. The smell is very light and hard to smell very well, but there's a slight hoppiness to it, but the hops flavor/aroma has morphed almost into a metallic flavor. The mouthfeel isn't so great, it's a little offensive. Overall I wouldn't try this ever again, not great."
"I found the flavor to be truly unique. Chocolate, vanilla, and sweet malt tastes form the backbone. The flavor thins and becomes somewhat medicinal and cidery before yielding to copious amounts of tart cherry and red grape flavors. The finish is moderately dry and accompanied by spicy alcohol and bountiful, bitter, English hops. The bitter, boozy finish is a dramatic contrast with the sweet, fruity flavors but the balance seems to jive well. I'd love to revisit this in a few years to see how well it matures. This brew begs to be aged."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff even though the alcohol is noticeable. Definitely worth picking it up and giving it a try."
"Taste was cooked fruit, which I was not expecting, a bit of biscuit-malt, some noticeable alcohol, and the delightful hop (Fuggles) bitterness that I enjoy so much from English Ales. Fantastic balance between sweet malty flavours and hoppy, bitter ones. I would love to get some more of this and cellar it away to see what is like in 2 or 3 years. Absolutely wonderful!!"
"2005 bottling. Poured a clear amber hue with a good 3/4 inch head that lingered for a few minutes. Aroma was of toasty, bready malts and a faint hop aroma. Taste was quite good. Caramelly malts with notes of toffee, caramelized apples and fruity flavors in the finish. Hop flavor was present, just enough to balance the malty sweetness. I could feel just a tickle of alcohol on the tongue. Drinkability was very good. I could easily polish off two bottles, but why do that? My second bottle is going to have to wait a couple of years or so. Excellent Old/Strong ale from a classic English brewery."
"The alcohol burn is still more pronounced than I like, but it actually is a nicely mixed component this year. Nice full mouthfeel, I could easily drink way too much of this if it was on hand."
"The beer poured a hazy red-brown with a thin head. The smell was dominated by malty sweetness and alcohol with soft hop notes. The taste was similar to the aroma, but while remaining a beer it reminded me of a brandy, particularly as it warmed. Mouthfeel was what I expected, slightly coating the mouth, but without being creamy. Drinkability on this one is good. It is surely a sipper, but I don't see anything wrong with that. Recommended."
"I bought another to lay down for another few years. I'm looking forward to it."
"Even though I think this beer would have matured nicely in a year or so, I think it was well worth drinking. Cellaring a couple is a great idea. This is by far one of the best beers I've ever enjoyed."
"D: This is a very excellent beer, although it is much different from some of the other old ales that I have had. A bit pricey, but perhaps worth it."
"Splendid example of English brewing, but not my favorite year for this one. May need a few more months in the cellar."
"A great beer to sip that goes down smoothly."
"This vintage has a great potential when those yeast phenols and fusil alcohol tones making the marzipan smells mellow it will be interesting...the almond-berry decenment is wonderful but the boozey finish screws up the whole drink....but this is a very young sample....a few months or a year in the cellar and I await an entirely different profile on this one."
"2005 Bottle number 46107 out of 95000 - label says best before end 2008 (a couple years early, I guess). Pours hazy copper with an inch head that goes away leaving a whole lot of lacing both on the sides of the glass and on the surface of the ale. Smells fruity - sour apple, tart cherry - there's a bit of pine here, too. The smell is wonderful - very clean, crisp. Taste is also very crisp. Delicious fruity tartness up front with a bit of bitterness in the back. There is also a bit of dryness - very complex. There is some mild carbonation, but it adds to the taste rather than retracting. I could drink this all night. I'm going back to the store to get some more for cellaring - this would do well with some more aging. Highest Recommendation."
"Sampled at the the Carolina Brewmaster Christmas party (thanks Tom). I believe it was a 2003. Pours a clear dark amber color with a thin hea. Smells of ripe fruit and earthy malts. Very balanced and a nice old ale, though not my favorite. Always wanted to try the beer in the box and need to age some myself."
"The Fullers Vintage Ale release is one I await with annual anticipation. The fact that such an awesome brew is obtainable in the beer hell that is Ontario is almost a miracle. This one is liquid mahogony/tan leather capped with billowing beige froth, leaving spiderweb-lace. Its very aromatic in the way you would expect a scotch to be. Theres a hint of iodine at first, followed by heavy crystalized malts/burnt sugars/butterscotch and this is all wrapped up in a sipcy, floral, hoppy blanket. Sound complex? It is.the flavours are awash with full on deep rooted english malts (sweet caramel, brown sugar/butter) lots of spiced up hops here with a dash of whisky (wood, iodine). Lingering malt based finish, very warming and spicy. The complexity will leave you breathless. Keep this one away from the kiddies."
"At this point I would say that this beer is good, but not yet at its potential. When the finish mellows a little more I imagine it will benefit in the balance department."
"Well balanced and well done...i'm sure this ale will age beautifully as the quality of this brew is first class. A must try...it won't disappoint."
"Overall: This beer is good. It might be just a little pricy, but it is worth it once in a while."
"drinkability is good, but i think will be great with time."
"Drinkabilty: It's awesome. Not as heavy as a port, but interesting and complex enough to where you want to drink it without distraction. No TV, no wife bugging you about the fact that her computer needs more memory, or cats running around like a bunch of danm rats. Drink it in front of the fireplace or on the porch while watching the rain."
"Poured into a snifter, clear copper/orange, thick off white head forms, settles down into a thick ring, nice lacing. Smell is sweet, lots of toffee, alcohol, citrus/floral, fruits, almost strawberry character. Taste is toffee and figs, raisins, bready malt, some citrus and fruits, bitterness in the finish, significant heat, lots of booze. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, almost syrupy, low carbonation, warming, waiting for this beast to settle down."
"Notes: I bought two so I could taste one now and age one for a year or so to see the difference so I cant wait for the year to be up."
"Fluffy, long lasting foam topped this clear, coppery beer. Chunky lacing remained on the glass as the head slowly subsided. Burnt orange and reddish hues appeared, depending on the way the light hit the glass. Hops are still vivid in the nose, earthy, floral and a bit medicinal, but it's the malt that really carries the aroma. It smells of sweet caramel, brown sugar and toasted nuts, with mild alcohol and dried fruit. The flavour is kind of muddled due to fairly strong alcohol throughout. Still, there's a nice caramel, toasty malt backbone and solid hop bitterness/flavour. Carbonation is well integrated and it has a full body. I sampled this one a few months earlier than I normally do for Fuller's Vintage Ale. It looks great and the aroma is superb, but with the hot alcohol character it tastes like it's much too young and brash at this point. I'm expecting this one to mature nicely with a little aging."
"This has it all in the right places so far in its young incarnation--it seems to me that this will be an even better vintage once it's had a few years to sit and age. Looking forward to it."
"Overall- A nice sipping Ale but nothing outstanding. The flavor was too subdued for me. A little too pricey also, $8. Otherwise, not bad. If I spot it on tap I'd order up a pint."
"We had the last two pints in the keg and I felt very privileged and lucky."
"Mouthfeel is light and gives up an inital soft billow of lifting carbonation before going totally still in the mouth. This beer surpasses and defys my expectations of the style. How ironic that my highest rated-beer may be in my least-favorite style. It is complex and boldly falvorful while amazingly light and drinkable. Yes, it would go very well with a light cigar, but if you have an aged bottle of this, I don't suggest adulterating the experience."
"4/4.5/4.5/4/4.5 Not rated as high as my first, but I think I'd rather have this one any day."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, and semi-dry along the palate during the swallow."
"Fuller's 1845 is one of my favorite British Ales and until today I didn't think it could be improved upon. Fuller's Vintage Ale has all the great characteristics of the 1845 but is somehow even better in every possible way."
"Overall, a beer that feels like drinking a very light whiskey. The flavors are wonderful and complex albeit maybe a bit nuanced and light at first, the palate is pampered, the aroma and appearance are straightforward and inviting. Time for a cigar!"
"D - One bottle is not enough. Just disappointed its a 2001 vintage. I'll have to wait 5 more years to have another like this."
"Overall: I was a little bit let down on the flavour with this one. It has some hops as a noticeable addition, which is somewhat unusual for the style, but the rest of the flavour doesn't have as much depth as I would like. It has all of the old ale staples: sweetness, caramel, dark fruits, but it doesn't bring a big showstopping presence in any of thoese areas. Perhaps an older vintage or laying this one down for a while would help."
"2000 Vintage. When first tasted in 2001 it was almost like an ESB with too much hops and alcohol, but after buying four more, and laying them down for 4-5 years, I was astounded at the change. Poured into my Fuller Noninck pint. The hops had aged into an earthy musty basement aroma that reminded me of the root cellar my grandfather had dug with his own hands beneath his farmhouse. There was also a hint of orange marmelade in the flavor and aroma, with a fruity finish soaked in brandy. Soft carbonation and a silky mouthfeel eased this one down without effort, and after drinking half the beer all of a sudden it was one hour later - I had awoken in my chair by the fireplace with the other half of the pint spilled on my lap! I was clearly worked over by a quiet storm, and loved every minute of it (except the loss of half the beer)."
"Glad I had a chance to try this... I think I'll hold onto the other one I bought in the cellar for a few more years. I'll be curious to see how this will evolve."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting on 8/16/06 (2004 Bottle): Pours a clear dark amber color with a thin beige head that lasts alright. Thin spotty lacing. Aroma of ripe fruit and earthy malts. Medium-bodied with a smooth and sweet character. Roasted malt, raisin and spice flavors are all represented, along with a pinch of yeast. The finish is spicy with a mild hops aftertaste. All in all this beer held up pretty well."
"1999: Bottle # 64950... Poured a cloudy light ruby color with a small light tan head that encircled the top of the glass. A strong fruity aroma with touches of rum, whiskey and certainly alittle alcohol present. This is one of the most complex beers I have had. Alcohol is well balanced throughout, never too strong though. Sweet, fruity tastes found first, followed by a dry peppery taste. Some chocolate, toffee, sweet caramel and even alittle licorice next. Finishes crisp and smooth, no one flavor is overbearing. It is a sipper for sure, I wouldn't want to rush a superb drink such as this. Long finish that just dances across my tongue."
"Due to definite improvement with age, I've upped my original review of a 4.0."
"A great old ale!"
"The smell is strong and full of dates, plums, and alcohol. The taste is solid and full of hefty malt content. The mouthfeel is very strong without being heavy. Drinkability takes a hit for the noticable alcohol, but is still fairly good."
"An excellent fruity/floral ale with obvious cherry and cranberry flavors. Highly recommended."
"Toasted malts with some dark ripe fruit qualities coupled with a strong alcohol sensation. Hot alcohol needs to settle down a bit, but this is a complex intriguing Old Ale."
"For only being in the bottle for a year, this is an awesome experience, easily a beer that could be bought and consumed for a great time. The taste is definately young, a lot of hop bitterness at the start, and the malt flavors are not quite developed. This bottle was bought in order to save the same fate to a previous bottle, which will HOPEFULLY be aged for at least another year. This was bought for a birthday present, and wil l probably be consumed as a grad school graduation present."
"Notes: Dammmmnnnn....this is a hell of a beer. Complex in flavor, but not overpowering. Sip and savor this one. A must try for anyone, but especially a port-lover."
"I won't try it again anytime soon."
"Bottle graciously provided by mynie. Thanks again for the chance to try this one."
"Amazing. It's hard to imagine it any better but it is sweet and full enough that it clearly has a lot of potential to mature. I would love to try it again in another 5 years."
"The body is big, silky, and very creamy textured. A real joy to sip and hold for a moment before swallowing. Excellent."
"Yup, this'll get better with age. I bought three bottles, and will try the second a year from now, the third a year after that. Still, I'm not too upset with myself for having opened it."
"A big thanks to me for hauling this through Brooklyn at 6 in the morning (hungover), catching the train to Chinatown, booking it to the Chinatown Express bus stop, bringing it on a bus for 5 hours to Washington D.C., then finally dragging it to Reagan National to carry on a flight back to Minnesota (which included a layover in Milwaukee). I deserved this one."
"D - if you like sweet, its hihg, otherwise, only moderate, i love it"
" Taste is broad and crisp and very round. Alcohol is only evident in the texture but not the taste, as it should be. Full, delicious malt with nice hop balance and smoky aftertaste. Mouthfeel holds it all together very well and is not as carbonated as I feared initially. For 8.5% this is dangerously drinkable. This beer makes me smile. I'll be seeing it again soon."
"The mouthfeel is perfect for the style as the lazy carbonation just barely keeps the head afloat and allows the malt and hops to dance in unison while staying in the background and tickling the tongue. This ale is extremly drinkable and makes me look forward to drinking more Vintage ales in the future"
"I poured this into a snifter and it looked beautiful  a nice thick caramel color with a ¼ tan head. The aroma was not overbearing. There were malt flavors that came through and hint of sweetness. The taste had a chewy malty backbone with toffee and coffee flavors. A bit of alcohol presence came through, a property that will dissipate with aging. Even still, this is a fine beer and Im sure it will be even better in a few years."
"rich mouthfeel with a sharp carbonation. initial sweetness with some balancing hops and alcohol in the finish. flavors of dry sherry, cherries, prunes, and mild hops. lots of aromas, lots of flavors; an enjoyable one to sip."
"Finishes fairly slow, warm, with a well placed bitterness."
"I've come to expect good things from Fuller's. This brew does not disappoint. Unified flavors make this brew easy to drink. Interesting and complex. This is a nice treat. Ill be looking forward to trying the vintage ale every year."
"Overall another good offering from Fullers."
"Mouthfeel- Silky smooth, even though it was more tart than I usually liked in my beer. But this fit well while sitting in front of a fire with a good friend."
"A classic English Strong Ale. It is always worth picking up and stashing away one or more of these if you can. A Perennial favourite - Recommended."
"D- This is a nice young old ale. I will be interested in trying this after a few years or more. The malt flavors are still distinct and I was surprised to taste so much hops."
"With the cherry and oaky overtones and the gentle mouth feel, this beer makes for a pretty good slow sipper."
"Very aromatic sweet malts and fresh baked goods. Rich dark amber color with a pinky thick head. Creamy malt and fruit flavors. I get almond notes, but it is like almond extract as you might find in baked goods more than fresh almonds. Alcohol is noticeable, but only as an amped up sweetness and slightly medicinal/oxidized flavor in the finish. Great sipping beer."
"Drinkability: All around great with a rare and unique flavor. Nice combo of maltiness and sweetness. Well done."
"Word to the wise. Let the 2005s sit for a good year or three. Dont make my mistake and listen to a Wine bar bartender. Let this one sit and Im sure it will be awesome with some aging."
"pours a ruddy copper color with a thin head. smells rich, malty, dried fruit and tobacco. tastes rich, thick over the tongue with dark fruit, tobacco and leather flavors. well balanced english hop flavors. This is like a decent english ale on steroids. A very nice beer, but not quite worth the specil box/bottle/pricetag."
"Pretty drinkable for the heft. I enjoyed this true winter warmer. Fuller's comes through with another classic!"
"Mature- that's the word that, for me, best sums up this beer. Like soft, sumptuous leather, it wraps you up and grounds you, and gives an artfully blended dose of earthy goodness. The ABV is big but mixes in with the crowd and transmits a soothing warmth. The one's for the sipping and savoring, a la port and brandy, and each drop is in fine fettle. For those times when I feel like acting as the adult I'm supposed to be, this is one I want to drink."
"Now that my rant is over, beware at $7.00 for a 22oz. bottle."
"2005 vintage #49899. Label states best before 2008, but will age many more years. Pours a crystal clear medium brown with lots of ruby highlights. Good 2 finger head with good longevity and very good lace. Big aromas of sherry, dried dark fruit, hints of whiskey and brown sugar. Big malt flavors with sherry like qualities - fruity. Nice lingering hop bitterness but not overpowering. roasted malt flavors come through as well. Very complex as always. Slightly syrupy and warming. I wish I had another 2001 so I could re review it. I was a beginner BA when I reviewd it and it was my first ""big"" beer. I would not score it as high now as I remember it was not as good as this vintage. I am glad I have 1 more 2005 stashed away for future drinking. Still a bargain at $6.99."
"Drinkability: A little too high for an English session, this beer is still pretty enjoyable."
"Pours an impressive amber color with a thick, frothy tan head that retains exceptionally for a brew this strong. The aroma is nice and malty; big caramel and fruit (plum, cherry, apple, pear) initially, along with some brandy and port wine, toasted bread, light floral and citrus hops, english yeast, minerals and some alcohol. The flavor also starts out malty with a nice fruit character (figs, plums, raisins, apples, pears, cherries) as well as some brown sugar, mild floral and citrusy hops, esters, minerals, british yeast, mild alcohol and some fine liquor (brandy, congac or scotch). The flavor is complex yet smooth, with light carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Drinkability is exceptional, as the alcohol is only noticeable by the warming sensation in your throat. A fine old ale from fullers, smooth and complex...very refined like a port wine or brandy."
"Since I have been introduced to this brew I have since found it in limited availability in MA. I have since expanded my 04's and am looking forward to each year. If you like strong beers and vintage beers like Hardy's I would highly recommend this brew."
"Vintage 2005: I may have been spoiled with drinking the 2001 aged bottle a few days earlier, cause this one wasnt as good (obviously). What I mean by that is in the style of an Old Ale, you expect more range in the flavour, and a bit more hoppy taste with the alcohol poking in at the end. But dont get me wrong, this one was very nice to drink for sure. The colour was nice, the taste was fine, and its overall a pleasureable ale to drink. Would go good with some cheese."
"2005 vintage bottle #49597,poured a deep rich copper with some burnt orange tint with a short lasting one finger white head.Aromas of brown sugar and orange marmalade with a hint of caramel,sweet but very pleasingly sweet dark sweet cherries dipped in brandy,brown suger and caramel dominate with just a hint of leafy herbal hop in the finish.The alcohol is a little raw but this bottle is pretty new would love to cellar one and likely will.The 2001 vintage is one of my alltime favorite beers, give this some time and it could reach its standards I believe."
"Vintage 2005, coming in the attractive red Scotch-style box with the cream-coloured label showing the Fuller's symbol. The back of the box tells more about the 2005 edition. Such attractive packaging, and the bottle I carefully pulled out was No. 28149. The cap is covered with a thin strand of taped-label saying ""Limited Edition."" Definitely in for something special here--I have wanted to try this beer for a long while. Vintage Ale poured into my glass leaving a good solid tapioca-coloured head, creamy and settling at about 2cm. Islands of lacing clung nicely to the glass. The beer itself is a dark tawny brown-red, and quite clear. Dark honey, with hints or ruby or even light cherry colouration. The aroma is a lovely rum/dark fruit combination, not overpowering, but creamy and balanced. Nice sugar in the form of mollasses and brown sugar, maple syrup and sweet sherry. Figs, celery, black licorice, oak or fresh pine, milk chocolate and raisins. The sweetness is deliciously appetising. The hopping is detectable in the wood notes and lovely tickling sensation the beer gives to the nose. Other notes of cinnamon, black currants, prunes, and a little vanilla. Wonderfully sweet but not cloying aroma for this Old Ale. The taste up-front is powerfully resin-like and sugary. Brown sugar definitely at first, followed by sweet port alcohol warmth, and finishing with a sugary but dry feeling, akin to homemade honey. The body is felt heavily in the middle and even more in the finish: a great chewy and malty viscous tasting brew. More wood tastes in the middle, strong reminiscent of maple syrup and mollasses. Wonderful hop complexity, adding a spicy bittering to the palate. Cherries and nuts in the finish. Sweet all the way through, just as it should be. The gravity can be tasted throughout too, adding some astringent characteristics that warm the mouth and stomach quickly. The long aftertaste has a sweet-bread feel, like cinnamon buns or brown sugar and pecan bread. The more the beer warms, the more the phenols appear in the aroma and the taste. More caramel and honey-style malting as it warms too, like fresh baked bread, or scones with clotted cream and jam. Even sweet whiskey flavours are to be found in here, and definite sherry notes. A wonderful winter sipper. The mouthfeel is heavy, the body full. Low carbonation, syrupy feel. Yet drinkability remains high: there is no off-flavour or overdone meatiness to limit it. I had to try one bottle fresh, but I highly anticipate cracking the other 3 I cellared in a couple of years. Delectable beer. I hope it ages well, and I would love to try some older vintages of the stuff. It went well with double-creme brie, and also havarti cheese. The sharpness of blue cheese seemed to overdo the sweet maltiness though."
"It's got the same ruby red hue to it as the older versions, but there's more noticable carbonation in little bubbles throughout the beer. Smells of fruity malts and alcohol, with some more fruity esters floating around. Taste is big cherries right up front, with the same fruityness as in the scent, with still a big kick of alcohol and and yeasty, toffeeish taste. Good, but since I see where this beer can go it needs a little time to settle. The biggest difference was that the mouthfeel was nowhere near as pillowy and smooth as the 98. I'm definately going to try to stockpile these and see what happens."
"Has a light mouthfeel and minimal carbonation. taste is of caramel malts and sugar. Taste is quite good, although the palate presence is a bit lacking. A solid brew, but not what I was expecting."
"Nicely drinkable but at it's price I won't be doing that on a regular basis. Tasty and very aromatic this is an ale you should try."
"2004 vintage, still seems a bit young with room to develop. Poured a surprisingly bright cola amber for a bottle conditioned beer. Brown sugar, sweet malt and a rather cutting alcohol edge. Finished with the barest touch of vinious tannin. An old school old ale that I'd like to see a bit more age on and see what happens."
"Cheers!"
"the color is very similar to that of the mad elf i just tried. clear red, but with a more coppery tinge. after the initial pour, not much visible carbonation but still a fairly spritzy feel"
"Pours deep amber with a nice foamy off-white head. A lighty spiced nose with hoppy notes and a pinch of fruit. The taste is gentley sweet with hop traces. A nice sponge toffee characteristic is here and lingers nicely. Mild spice, maybe some orange zest as well. Medium bodied. A nice chewiness to the beer brought on by the sweet caramel & molasses and alcohol kick. Warm, sweetn spicey finish with a mild hop trace. This is the perfect beer for a winter eveing. A nice sipper. Great alcohol warmth on the finish. Good complexity. I enjoyed it thuroughly."
"Tastes malty, with winey and whisky hints. Hops not easily detectable. The taste is mellow and smooth. Not your typical ale. An enjoyable brew, fit for sipping on a quiet winter's evening."
"The only odd characteristic of this beer is its appearance. I'm used to OAs looking rather flat without much head to speak of, let alone one that's still a few centimeters high halfway through the glass. However, I like beers with strong retention and lacing. Good stuff. Get some and stash it away...it can only get better."
"2000 vintage. This brew pours a murky brown color with amber hues around the edges. The head is mammoth and white. Lacing is thorough. The aroma screams that this brew is big. Hoppy, piney, malty. The taste is a lot more balanced than the aroma led me to believe it would be. The sip has a pronounced malt backbone, while hops break through in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a very good brew."
"1999 vintage. The brew pours a nice amber color with a small head that falls to a very light coating over the beer. The nose is deep raisin and fig with a very thick brown sugar sweetness and a bit of alcohol as well. I like it. Flavor is very much more smooth than the nose would indicate. The brown sugar and raisin flavor meld really well together. Incredible balance. The feel is thick with a light carbonation. Very nice on the tongue. I really like the beer. The nose is a touch too strong on the alcohol, but it is nothing to set back my feelings of it. This is deceptively drinkable. Well crafted beer."
"1999 Vintage. This one pours a dark amber color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of raisin and fruit and some alcohol. Smells pretty good. The flavor is awesome. So much smoother than expected. Lots of great fruit flavors with just a touch of alcohol. Very nice. The mouthfeel is on the heavy end of moderate and the drinkability is great."
"I have one other bottle that I will keep for some years. Should be interesting to compare notes with my future tasting."
"Decent presentation in a oversized wine glass. beautiful frothy white head that recedes in uniform to a thin lazy fading froth ending in nothing. Copper color that is hard to see through. Bottle fermentation for 5 years may have jacked this baby up because I can smell the alcohol and it is welcomed. Prune, plumb, caramel smell comes through strongest. yeast. Tasted mellow dude. Just a layed back deep, rich easy drinking 8.5 abv (at bottling)....frickin sweeet....it did lack lacing and head retention but who cares the quality is in the taste. Even a little zing at the end to battle the caramel finish that is saucey."
"Bottle# 43816 with a best before date of end of 2003. Pours out a dark reddish brown with a decent sized frothy head. Some sticky rings of lace were left clinging to the glass. Sweet dark ripe fruit was strong in the aroma with plums and figs. Some caramel malt and a bit of musty earth. Figs, raisins and plenty more fruits kick of the taste before a bit of alcohol and molasses come in to play. There are some nice malt complexities going on as well. Light alcohol burn with a bit of earthiness and some fruit on the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky sweet with a great thickness. A bit warming from the alcohol too. Really smooth and easy drinking stuff even if it is more of a sipper. For supposedly being 2 years past the best by date this is fantastic."
"Big, big, big malt aroma. Crystal clear with an off white head. Very pretty beer. Again big malt flavor with a touch of bitterness. There are some flavor hops in the middle that I dont care for. Very nice palate. Fuller bodied. Maybe a touch too much carbonation. This is by far the best Fullers beer I have ever drank."
"A bit boozy, but still tasty for an old strong ale. The house yeast and malt profile work better in the 1845 in my opinion."
"Bottle #76157: The beer dispenses from the 500ml brown bottle a translucent deep amber to copper color with the head average in size, the texture semi-creamy and the color a winsome light tan and after its demise the residual lace a concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is deep malt, sweet, hints of caramel, and oh yes Alcohol and the start delectable in its sweetness and the grain profile adequate, the top is middling in its feel. Finish scrumptious in its hop presence, moderately carbonated and a very dry long lasting aftertaste, the first new vintage in a few years at least for me."
"The 2012 was a rich maltiness, with citrus hop finish (had in '14)."
"D - No desire to have this again, and almost forgot to drink the last half of pint before going to sleep."
"Fiery scarlet red appearance. Clarity is good. Head is beige, hefty and long-lasting. Lace is bountiful. This smells of toffee, caramelized raisins and vanilla nougat. Excellent aroma. Flavor is kind of sharp and dry. The bulk of this beer is all about the caramel and toffee flavor wheels. Also nuances of cedar. Alcohol is nearly absent. Dry, woody finish. Mouthfeel is appropriately prickly with carbonation. Body about light-medium. Good stuff, but I think I may have waited a titch too long."
"I get about a centimeter of yellowy-cream head: lots of bubbles floating on a dense base. The beer itself is clearish and copper-brown. Quite dark. The nose is a sweet and fruity liqueur. Port-like, too. Mmmmm. Fruity and malty in front. It turns thick, smooth, buttery, malty and slick. And then there's alcohol, loads of cherries (?) and a good, tangy, British bitterness. Excellent: a slick, buttery, fruity malt monster. Big alcohol kick."
"Edit: This review was of the 2000 vintage."
"This is a remarkably clean tasting ale overall. I plan to get some more so I can let it age. It pairs well with Mortlach 32 Y.O. single malt (G&M) as well."
"This is a beer brewed to last, yet is quite drinkable right now. The mouthfeel improves as it warms. I'd like to cellar a couple bottles of this and see how it matures."
"bottle number 03785.shared this with bieristut. poured amber with a off white head. aroma malts, caramel, plums, raisins, honey, some hops, grapes, flavor, raisins, malts, honey, toffee, dark fruits, this is a good beer . will have to get the other vintages as they get to this area. just think being able to rate a beer that is retired."
"Drinkability: If only I had bought more!!!!"
"complex mash of hops, malt and baking tastes. Well made and very easy to drink this beer is a true Winter treat."
"Bottle No. 71808 of 85,000."
"Pours a nice copper color with a large bubbly white head that leaves a nice lace. Aromas are a mix of dark fruits (grapes and figs mostly) along with some toffees and a warming alcohol. Flavors start off initially sweet with a large dosage of grapes, plums, and figs. There is an abundant amount of sweetness that has a sugary feel to it along with a hot alcohol feel. In the middle the is a nice touch of caramels and toffees that go along nicely with this full bodied brew. The finish is fruity, citrusy, and very floral with a nice dosage of hops that helps round out this brew. Overall a highly drinkable old ale that seems just a bit young due to the sugary feel to it."
"Pours a coppery, almost dark orange colour. Big, fluffy head after a slow pour. About three fingers, which disipates to a little over one over a decent period of time. Rings of lace around the glass every few millimeters. Smells thick with malts and pungent earth, with a bit of honey, floral hops(which aids the earth quality) and some dry cow hide. Taste is huge with malts and earth. Wow. Layer after layer of thick malts, with a honey sweetness escorting beside it. Bit of a bitter aftertaste, which reminds me of rum and juniper berries. Mouthfeel is thick, and just a tad thinner than syrup. For this kind of beer, it's great. Pretty drinkable. Perhaps not a quaffer, but very few good beers are quaffers. An excellent brewed beer."
"In conclusion, there is no doubt that this beer will improve with age. Be sure to serve this one a cellar temperature and a wide-mouthed glass to allow the subtle bouquet to open up!"
"No. 73058: I know this one is a little young to try, but I had to at least try one before putting some aside. It poured a very dark reddish amber color and formed a foamy white head that left circular lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, plums, chocolate, red wine and a hint of alcohol. The flavor was of malt, caramel, some light candy taste. The finish was silky and slightly sweet."
"Definitely want to get more of this, and see what a bit more time does to it."
"The taste is"
" This vintage ale will cellar well .plan on 2 or 3 away for next fall."
"I don't know what this was like in 2001, but it's a hell of an old ale now. Well-balanced and just hoppy enough despite an assertive maltiness. Cakey and viscous. As you settle into this, you just begin to feel what kicking back and drinking a nice old ale should feel like. It drizzles down the throat, coating as it goes, and giving warmth. The sweetness lingers past the finish. Very good beer."
"Pours a clear, deep mahogany with a nice sticky, white head that leaves a nice lacing down the snifter. Appearance will likely be a little cloudier when I decant the rest of the bottle and the yeast deposit at the bottom. Aroma is vinous and candy sweet with some light alcoholic phenols. The taste is a subtle display of acidic and sweet fruitiness with a spicy alcoholic finish in a nice full creamy broth of a base. The sweetness is reminiscent of Belgium and its brewers remarkable ability to blur the lines between beer and wine. The mouthfeel is full, lucious, slick and creamy, which makes for a most addictive imbibing experience. Overall, a fantastic brew, I will certainly seek out other vintage offerings from this brewery."
"A bit disappointing to be honest. Previous years have had a much bolder and fuller flavour and aroma. This is pretty short lived on the palette for a beer of its apparent complexity and abv. It will be interesting to see if age can put some much needed depth into this."
"Very interested and excited about trying this, heard good things. Comes in a box and a nice paper-sealed bottle. Pours a dark amber with thick off-white head that laces very well. Aroma of toffee and an earthy red wine-like smell. Taste was a very rich caramel and toffee with hoppy middle with some fruit, and a pleasent roasted finish. Mouthfeel was smooth and alcohol was well-hidden at first but revealed itself as it warmed. This is a very good ale and is the first old ale that I have tried. Not something I would like to have a lot of in one sitting though."
"Pours a deep amber/ruby color from a 16.9oz bottle. Slightly fruity aroma with notes of alcohol, malt and perhaps some whisky. Taste is ripe fruit, creamy, slight whisky/tawny port notes. Some hops in the end. Very enjoyable brew. Not quite up to standards of Hardeys or JW Lees but quite a nice beer. Extra points for sophisticated packaging."
"An amber color, hazy, with orange highlights. A tawny colored head with low retention. Aroma is of oak, tartness, malt, alcohol and hops. Flavor is surprisingly muted; a sweet start, whisky notes and a dry, lightly tart, finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with low effervescence. I had some high expectations about this beer. Not a bad brew, but really lacking in character."
"Poured out a nice amber, unclear and with a quickly dissapating head that left only a dusting and bit of creamy bubbles in the corner of the glasses. Nice fruity aroma, grapes and raspberries. Peppery spice with a bit of dougheyness in there too. The carbination is just right in here, not too much. The mouthfeel is very nice, almost chewy. Good flavors, malty and caramel sweetness, bit of hoppy bite in there, not much. The sweetness is very prominant, which makes it more of a sipper than a session."
"Drinkability: Scotch meets beer. Take your time with this: very boozy, almost unpleasantly so."
"Tasting it, I can sense the fruitiness, which is very creamy at first as well. I also can taste the hops on the finish. It is very sugary on the finish, and is very nice! The alcohol burn left is insane!!! Figure this beer is 4 years old, so I would expect a little alcohol finish, but Wow, does it stick around. Mouthfeel is good. It starts out to seem as though it is going very heavy and creamy, but then the alcohol burns it off a bit. Overall, this is a very nice beer, and I recommend it to everyone!"
"Full-bodied and flavorful but hot down the throat and the cloying syrupy sweetness was just too much. Notes of apricot, tea, tangerine, wood and orange. The hops were nice and sought to balance but failed."
"Deep brownish body. Nice off-white head 1 inch-tall despite being 5 yr old. Honest long-lasting film. Big malty aroma although not as expressive as I expected. Brown sugar, chocolate, bready yeast, nuts, caramel, dark fruits... This is a nice cake! Of course very sweet on the tongue. Very complex malt flavors. One sip, you taste mostly the caramelic and brown sugar aspects while the next one will reveal its chocolatey, toffee and almondish secrets. Dark fruits are felt, but hard to put words on. Vinous at times, clovey at others. Extremely complex and enjoyable english ale. Very smoky peat finish. Hops are very subdued which appears to be fine as I assume this has gotten very mellow and round over the years. Moderate amount of carbonation which is a shock considering its 5 yr old and most aged beers Ive had lost had lost a lot of body after 3-4 years. Very soft and creamy full body. Never cloying and has proved to be love-worthy for anyone. Unique age resistance. This is truly a beer that you want to sit back and admire. Looking forward to the next sampling. Props to JPDipso for the bottle."
"So far, my favorite Fuller's beer in bottle."
"1998 Vintage Bottle 18602. I must admit I was skeptical about this one given the fancy box and presentation. Boy was I wrong. It poured alive with lively carbonation, nice thick head and a subtle sweet nose. Clear translucent amber color. The big winner here is the taste. Rich, malty lasting flavors with great depth. The hops play a minor role giving a great bitter flavor and a crispness to counter to malty sweetness. The beer is so smooth and well-balanced and I am not sure how much is due to the aging process but it was clearly made to last."
"A dark chestnut coloured brew with a nice off-white head that sticks around for a while. The aroma on this puppy is great. A lovely blend of dark fruits, pudding, bread, alcohol, medicinal hops, and sweet, sweet malts. The taste is very malty, a bit boozy,a nd very barleywine like. The hops are a little subdues for my liking, but this is a traditional English barleywine here, so I can't fault them for that! The mouthfeel is a bit thin for my liking, but the drinkability for this 8.5% nectar is quite awesome! Great stuff!"
"Beer is good. Happy aged beering."
"poured into my fuller's imperial pint glass a cloudy, hazy amber colour with a tight fine head and ample rings of lace. a delicate honeyish aroma...with a myriad of candied fruit flavours wafting about. spice and anise...a bit of sweet malt and spicy hops invade the nose. pretty nice. tastes mostly fruity and yeasty, with hints of mineral water and malt. lots of underlying peppery spiciness, so subtle that it blends in with the bitter hoppiness quite nicely. alcohol detectable on the end of the spice train. malt profile runs the gamut from cocoa to caramel; all spiced with a hearty dose of rum and brandy soaked fruit cake. alcohol definitely there. mouthfeel runs smooth and slick...and a bit flat and uninspired. body is full and filling. aftertaste comes off as sticky and spicy. although a tasty and satiating ale, there is something that won't allow the battling flavours to meld together into a harmonious experience. paired with some spicy meats and cheeses...this might be a perfect accompaniment to a holiday cracker, cheese and smoked meat platter. alone it's an alcohol filled apertif. worth trying."
"The full amount of suggested aging did this beauty wonders. I would kill for another properly aged sample."
" The body is pretty full, but not all the way there. The carbonation is very mild. The initial flavor is nice and toasty. Malts are absolutely huge, and the backbone is absolutely delicious. Little touches of alcohol are found in the finish, but ever so subtle. The hops provide a bit of balance. This one is earthy and a bit grassy. I can only imagine that this would be a work of art on cask. The drinkability is excellent along with mouthfeel. It is so smooth. It definitely seems like an intensified ESB which is something I like to see. I think that this one may not have made it in the cellar for too much longer, so a big thanks to yen157 for letting me know that it was time to pop this one."
"Thanks Genaro!"
"This stuff will cost a little more than your average bottle of bitter, but it is bloody marvellous. This is as strong as Golden Pride, but with a more wooden, burnished flavour, smoother mouthfeel, a strong, hoppy nose and a good dry finish. Worth absolutely every penny."
"Served from a beautiful numbered generouslysized 18.6oz brown bottle, the bottle is indeed sealed witha paper seal as would be a good port. The box was a nice touch as well, and a fairly intelligent feature to prevent excess light from entering the bottle. Pours out of the bottle with plenty of carbonation and a frothy head that dissipates quickly. Color is a slightly toasted amber with flashes of red when held to the light, very good clarity. Aroma is swollen with aged fruit, smooth alcohol, and sweet malt. Taste is oh so smooth and tasty with each flavor playing well with the others, fermented raisins and figs blending with a sweet caramel malt and just a bit of the characteristic mustiness you expect in a vintage ale. Alcohol is very subdued, almost encouraging you to drink the whole large bottle in one sitting, though its probably best shared or saved for a couple nights enjoyment. Hops play in just a bit to add a bit of citrus flavor and only a bit of bitterness. Finish is smooth with hints of oak and vanilla left on your breath..mmm."
"#57541"
"Flavor is similar to the nose. I get sweet caramel up front followed by plums and raisins and then a finish with some alcohol warming in my throat. This is a very smooth beer and goes down easily. WIsh I had some more of these I recommend you find some too!"
"I love this beer but do not feel that it can improve any more with age. Just my opinion though."
"18.6oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep orange-brown color with two fingers of head. There is lots of lace left on the glass. The smell is fairly sweet with malty and fruity aromas. A little bit of grapes and caramel in there. The taste starts sweet, but gets really tart right after. It's only tart until it warms up good, then it smooths out wonderfully. The finish is fairly smooth and malty, just a little bit of hops. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and heavy. The drinkability lacks a little due to the 8.5% really showing. Drink this one now, it's prime!"
"definitly get enough bang out of your buck for this one, just the amazing fluffy biscuit head alone is worth the pittance. This pours a nice golden almost coppery yellow, it has a great spreading mouth feel....and slides over the palatte with just enough kick. A good balance of fruitness and toffee with almost carmelly note with just the right touch of sweetness....hope to try some of the older vintages."
"Bottle # 57449. Pours a hazed tawny amber with a creamy khaki colored head. Aroma consists of raisins, sweet caramel malt, alcohol and a hint of toffee underneath. Smooth full-bodied mouthfeel. Initial flavors of caramel malt and rum-soaked raisins. A pleasant hop bitterness reveals itself midway through to cut through some of the sweetness as the flavor grows in complexity. Some mineral or hard water taste arrives at this point also. Flavors turn smokey toward the back, in addition to the presence of alcoholic vapors. Lingering spiciness in combination with vanilla round out the sweet dry finish."
"Bottle number 05845. Poured a nice reddish copper color with virtually no head and little carbonation. Had a malty nose with a fruity sweetness coming throught predominately. Smelled sweeter than I expected. Tasted malty first with a fruity sweetness quickly moving in. Followed by a light hops bitteness into the finish. Not bad. Really would have liked to have tried this fresher, but I only have one bottle and the liquor store only had 2000's left when I bought it. They still have several 2000's marked down to try and move 'em. Not sure I want to buy them. Quite a smooth mouthfeel. Very smooth in fact. I'm sure it would have had better drinkability than it did for me if I was really wanting it. Problem was, I was really looking for something more on the crisp and light side, I just didn't have any of that. Went to the store today and got some. All in all, pretty good, just didn't hit the spot for me. Lookin' for 2003's to come into my area so I can buy a couple of bottles and try it fresh and aged."
"I cannot believe that I was even fortunate enough to find a few of these at my favorite store in Milwaukee! I have to admit that I had very very high expectations going into this beer, so I could have been easily disappointed. Needless to say, it was quite opposite of disappointment. This is probably the best smelling beer that I have ever come across. There was a very nice light head with heavy lacing. This was a 2000 vintage and I sampled it 1/23/04 so it was nice and conditioned. The taste is somewhat sweet and the flavors spread across the entire palette. I would love to get my hands on some older vintages. If you have the fortunate opportunity to find one of these, you would be foolish to pass it up. This is one great beer!"
"2000 Vintage was exceptional!"
"This bottle has been kept cold since purchase a few years ago."
"Except yours."
"On palate, richness and high alcohol are immediately evident. Flavor is rich and malty. Earthy and fruity--orange, plums--but balanced with subtle citrusy hops. Still, this is a heavy, rich, malty brew, which makes for great mouthfeel--lush, full, and silky--but drops drinkability down quite a bit. Not something I am going to rush out and buy again, but impressive nonetheless."
"Bottle # 58174. Poured a rusty brown and cloudy with a small yet dense and creamy head. A fantastic looking ale. Has a big sweet fruity malt aroma with noticible alcohol. Has a medium body that is quite smooth. Flavor is of strong sweet malt with caramel and fruit. This is an outstanding English ale."
"I love the beers you come into with low expectations only to find the quality. Syrupy tan head over a sensuous cinnamon body. Candy store nose of caramel and toffee coated nuts, pralines and chocolate coated dried tropical fruits. Big mouth full of bitter honey warm and easy. This beer is like a down comforter on a snow day while a classic 70's movie plays on in the foreground. Relaxing. Vintage."
"Great example of strong ale flavors, and a great winter warmer. Very british, and a heady brew because of such a large bottle."
"This strong ale poured a slightly hazy, reddish amber color with tall, creamy, light tan foam that persisted for a long time and clung to the inside of the glass. The smell was very nice and improved as the sampled warmed to room temperature. The smell was initially slightly sweet, fruity (figs, raisins), malty, and yeasty. The smell got less sweet and more dry as the sample warmed and breathed. The taste was slightly sweet and malty with flavors of fruit (figs and raisins and vinous grapes), and sherry. There was a dry hop bitterness in the finish and the taste of alcohol in the finish and aftertaste. The mouthfeel was smooth and velvety -- light on the tongue. The feeling was warming from the alcohol. The body was medium-full with medium carbonation feel. The aftertaste was dry and hoppy. This was a very excellent ale. A very special brew that aged nicely for 4 years."
"Impeccably balanced. A masterpiece of brewer's art, and it's only going to get better. Quite an experience in beer sampling."
"Noroc!"
"Medium brown color, medium head. Deep malt aroma, intense malt flavors. Somewhat hoppy. Full flavor, fully rounded mouthfeel. Malts have an aged taste, smoky sort of like a good scotch. Very smooth. Even with a high alcohol content (8.5%) not a noticeable alcohol bite. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is malty and smoky. A wonderful beer."
"Bottle #02245. This beer poured a medium sized head with medium sized bubbles. The body was clear and the hue of this beer was brown. There was good lacing on the sides of my glass. The nose was hoppy and it had a bitter aftertaste to it. This beer was just so-so in my opinion."
"The bottle was numbered No. 02245. Nice hoppy aroma. When poured, it yielded a medium head of medium sized white bubbles and a golden brown transparent color. As the head receded, it left behind a nice lacing that slowly followed the head down the side of the glass. This brew has an initial bite that lasts through the taste and well into the aftertaste. Not as smooth as I like. But I bet after a while I will feel the alcohol content in this brew."
"Originally sampled on 14 September 2002. Bottle #73824. Lots of malt, yeast & fruitiness greets your palate when you start enjoy this baby. Thick, creamy carmelly, delicious.. What else can I say? I really enjoyed this. I should note that the aroma was a bit yeasty."
"This is the best of the three vintages I've had of Fuller's Vintage Ale. The 1999 may have been past it's peak perhaps and the 2001 struck me as too bitter and alcoholic for a good balance. This however, was excellent. Very fruity and malty body balances the alcholic flavors and aroma and the bittering hops peak through only enough to prevent the malts from running away with the flavor. Considering the 1999, this beer has perhaps peaked and probably should be consumed soon. The appearance could use a more lively head, but who cares when the flavor is this good."
"Although the label reads ""Best before end 2003", it's my belief after enjoying it over the last two years that it's just come into its prime. I've really grown to enjoy this ale in the past year! And I'd suggest that although it probably won't improve any further, it should hold well for at least another year or two. Stored undisturbed and served at cellar temperature, it's crystal clear. When held to the light it's a very nice amber-copper, but it takes on a more interesting ruby cast when sitting on the bar. The initially foamy head slowly drops to a thin but creamy surface covering. The head retention is excellent and it leaves really nice lace through most of the Imperial pint. The nose displays a softly sweet and fruity (soft strawberry) malt that's laced with gentle alcohol. It's full bodied and creamy in the mouth with a fine and moderate natural carbonation from bottle conditioning. The flavor delivers a rich, fruity malt upfront with a touch of blackberry and dark fruit skins; and across the middle a note of licorice appears due to a combination of sweet malt, grassy/floral hop flavors, and spicy alcohol. A firm hop bitterness appears leading into the swallow, followed by emerging notes of caramel and vanilla in the finish. Quite nicely balanced and somewhat complex! An exceptionally nice beer to casually enjoy in a relaxing atmosphere... ...a softened leather high-back chair, a softly glowing fireplace, and a well-worn copy of Moby Dick come to mind! An ale well worthy of the ""Vintage"" name."
"# 24139. ""Best before end 2001"" Turbid tawny dark bronze hue, topped by an ivory white, large bubbled head that manages sporadic foam trails. Waft of alcoholic, bourbon soaked figs hits the nose upfront, then tapers to allow deeply toffeeish and bready, lightly biscuit dark caramel and basemalt to provide contrast. As the beer breathes, brighter notes of strawberry like esters and mellow diacetyl form a berry and cream impression. Hint of cardboard like oxidation dulls the aroma slightly, preventing excellence. Mellow, rounded caramel sweetness upfront seemlessly leads into a combination of faded, but well integrated hop bitterness and diacetyl. Judicious fruitiness surfaces timidly mid palate, being comprised of mild plum and sugar concentrated dried prunes. Alcohol creeps in late, adding a pseudosweet licorice suggestion late when combined with the dark fruit character. Moderate bodied, with a creamy smooth, well calcuated mouthfeel and attenuation. Finishes with bready sweetness and slight butterscotch fading slowly. Vintage Ale 1998, although perhaps past its prime, still possesses depth of character most worthy of a taste. A bit faded esterwise and in hop bitterness and thus well skewed towards malt sweetness. Interestingly enough, its diminished overall character from the ample aging leaves it reminescent of a fresh Young's Old Nick. Nonetheless a very enjoyable brew. Big thanks to Jaybeerman for the bottle!"
"what a nice ale. Mmmmm...I'll say it again,...Mmmmm!!!!!"
"Bottle #68225 This was my first aged ale if I remember correctly, a new frontier if you will. Poured a beautiful clear copper color, head was perfect and the lace coated the glass solidly. Off to a great start. Aroma was slightly sweet and strongly of stewed fruit. Taste was very port like, with aforementioned stewed fruit notes. Plums, Strawberries? Thick mouthfeel adds to the ambience. in my opinion I had this under the perfect circumstances. It's cold and rainy outside, Suzanne had the fireplace going, and we were having dinner. Went well with dinner though this might be even better as a nightcap. I didn't rate it much above average on drinkability because a sipping ale is not my favorite style, and this bad boy checks in at almost 9%. This is a very complex well made beer and one that might grow on me more if I had it regularly. Seeing it's from Fullers seals the deal. Very nice."
"Pours a very attractive amber in color with a thin, white head which, alas, poops out pretty quick. Aroma is dominated by sweet caramel malt and a strong scent of alcohol. Alcohol hits you right up front in the taste, too, followed by a fruity, pear-like malt sweetness, and finally a rather grassy hop finish. Alcohol taste is present pretty much throughout the sip, and a bit too strong for the flavor of the beer. The other flavors seem a bit unbalanced as well -- the malt and hops just don't seem to ""fit"" together very well. Mouthfeel is full and coating, which adds to the medicinal effect created by the over-strong alcohol flavor. I could understand these problems if this were a new beer, but this has been aging for a while. I can't see myself having another."
"Bottle # 55824. Poured a chesnut color with a bulbous, rocky, and very stable head. Aroma is at once both intensly hoppy and sweet. Strong alcohol arma is there as well. The taste is a full and unrelenting mix of grist-like sweet maltiness and british hops. Woody and maybe a little oily....and a nice bacground of alcohol. Creamy and suprisingly smooth too. This is one outstanding beer!"
"This brew poured a very deep amber color with a massive cream colored head that reduced down to about a quarter of an inch. The head was rocky and uneven, what a great looking beer. The aroma was very strong and complex. At first I thought this beer smelled fruity almost wine like but as it warmed it changed quite a bit. It took on a more of a roasted malt and carmel aroma with a definite whiff of alcohol spices. The aroma was not the only complex part about this beer, the taste was deep and complex as well. At first sip the first thing that jumped out was a sweet malt taste, not a sugar sweet though. The middle is of roasted malts and the carmel which I noticed in the aroma. The finish has the perfect balance with a little bit of floral hop bitterness, which complements the malty front very well. There is also hints of a buttery taste as well as a little bit of spicy alcohol but not too much. As I said a very complex beer. The mouthfeel is full and silky smooth, although it feels a little sharp against the back of the throat. This brew hides the 8.5 abv very well. Thanks to a friend this is the first brew I've had that has been conditioned for over a year. This was a very excellent brew and I would definitely drink again assuming I could find it."
"I was skeptical of this beer before I tried it. Don't get me wrong, I think Fuller's is a great brewery. But there is something about ""vintage ale"" in numbered bottles that cost $8.00 that sets that voice inside by head to screaming ""Gimmick!"" I've always had suspicions that that voice is wrong a lot (Like ""No, Sean, don't drink that shot that the stranger gave you"" or ""No, Sean, don't set THAT on fire"" or ""No, Sean, shaving your eyebrows is not a good idea""), but now I have the proof! This is a fantastic brew, worthy of any special occasion, like Thursdays."
"This ale pours a reddish/orange hue with an excellent head that holds very well, leaves ample lacing, and eventually settles to 1/4 inch collar. The aroma is all malt, caramel, sweet and slightly candyish. First taste is all malt, a little alcohol twinge and a tart finish. A little short in the mouthfeel, dry, but not very hoppy. More of a Strong ale than a Barleywine, but good nontheless. No presentation box, but a #45368 number on the bottle."
"Drinkability & Notes: Wow ... a masterpiece in a bottle! Aged to perfection and worth the $6-$7 a bottle. Its flavours have peaked but may not fall to a lesser beer even a year or more of cellaring. Easy to drink with very little aged flavour and no signs of oxidation."
"An excellent book at bedtime drink. A very good example of the style."
"Pours dark-garnet in color, nice creamy head. Sherry, alcohol, and massive fruit aroma bombard the nose. Tastes range from the initial maltiness, to a good fruity taste, slightl alcohol hit, and then lingering flavors of all the above, finally ending with a good little hop kick. Very tasty stuff."
"I had the fortune to try this immediately following the 1999 Vintage. We were doing side by side comparisons. This one is so similar in the uniqueness of the other vintages that it to deserves recognition. Again this one sees a fins mixture and balance of Malt and hops. the aroma of hops is - refreshing. Sharp and awake is the feeling from the nose. Just makes you smile. This one still needs some more aging. These peek at 3 years in the bottle. This one was just a tad bit rough. (barely) – but noticeable when compared the 99 side by side. The balance is not yet formed but is close enough to still be a wonderful beer. But as a treasured beer I am saving the last one for next Christmas. The yeast smell is stronger with a sweet alcohol nose surfacing just behind the hops. The malt is still pretty sweet and goes down well too. Beautiful tan head on this one and it just lasts ands lasts and lasts."
"By far, the best beer from Fuller's. It poured a nice copper orange/brown and the foam was light brown. The smell had a sweet fruity aroma, with a hint of a malty nature. The taste was out of this world. It had a sweet fruity flavor and the sweet/bitterness with the complex aroma and flavor just set this ale into a different world. Now, I can enjoy two of Fuller's strong ales, the other being Fuller's ""1845"". This is one of my top beers and I will stock up on it before my store sells out."
"I would have compared this back-to-back with Fuller's 1998, but I only have one lone bottle of that remaining -- so memory will have to serve. Many of the same appearance and aroma qualities as the 1998, the 2000 has more ragged alcohol edges and biting cinnamon notes in the malt. The hops are pretty big and orchestrate a rougher close combined with too much carbonation and in conjunction with the alcohol. Still, a big and beautiful Barleywine, the next one will get stored for mellowing."
"Glowing amber color, small white head. Strong alcohol fruity malty aroma, malty sweet and friuty very flavorfull, full body thick full mouthfeel, I bet it would be better with age, I just could not wait, a great brew like always."
"Bottle number 64495. The entire presentation is very aesthetically pleasing, from the well-appointed box to the band across the top of the bottle. What's inside (and what really matters) is a pretty reddish-copper beer with a big fluffy head. Carbonation is fairly high. It has a nice aroma of ripe fruit with noticeable hops and a bit of a musky smell. The initial flavor is quite sweet, but the finish is surprisingly dry, an very subtle citrus flavors are detectable. I haven't tried any other Fuller's Vintage and have nothing to compare against, but I really like this one."
"There is no doubt that this is a well respected brew, but it was just too overly sticky for me. Sweet start with a bit of chocolate, port, caramel, and a hint of berries. Bitter sweet finish. Quite big and potent, does demand respect."
"Dark amber/cooperish in color...soft bubbly head but minimal...maltiness on the nose...feels great in the mouth...very, very smooth with a solid but not overwhelming malt backbone....medium bodied...dark fruit(plums) tones on the taste..slight hop bite on the long finish..very very solid.."
"Everthing about this beer smacks of quality, from the beautiful big bottle to the thin tan head that remains in your glass after the experience is over.  Simply delightful."
"Pours a dark amber, almost iced tea like color.  Nice bubbly head that sinks down to a strong lace.  Chocolate, slight burnt and alcohol aromas.  The first taste I get is a hoppy/alcohol bitternes but then the malt kicks in with some burnt chocolate and dark fruits.  This is one complex brew.  Great mouthfeel.  Very smooth and creamy with good carbonation.  Overall I would have to say that I really like this beer.  Although my experience with the style is limited I ould have to say that this is one kick-ass barley wine."
