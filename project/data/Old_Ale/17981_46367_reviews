"Appearance: Clear light reddish brown with a 3” lacy, rocky off-white foam cap. Slight legs. Smell: Roast, fruit, sherry. Taste: Plum, sherry, a hint of coffee with sweetness lingering into the finish. Citrus rind bitterness provides balance. Mouthfeel: Creamy, luscious, slightly above medium body and above medium carbonation."

"Mouthfeel: Booze gives it a drying, warming sensation."
"Couldnt taste any hopps.  Was hoping for more from their description.  But it was strong and had (warming) qualities.      Very bready with strong alcohol.  No head, wasnt expecting one.  If the hopps came through i would be crazy happy."
"Pours a clear, red/brown color.  One inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, slight yeast,  caramel malt, hops, hint of pine, and a hint of wood.  Fits the style of an Old Ale.  Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, yeast, alcohol, hint of roasted malt, slight hops, caramel malt, and a hint of wood.  Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, blend, and decent complexity."

"High gravity, not as dark as most winter warmers I've had, not boozy at all and well balanced."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Goddamn, this is a spectacular beer!! Awesome flavors of malt, fruit, and sweetness all wrapped up in an absolutely spectacular beer!!"
"Too boozy, some caramel, not much spice and rather malty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light brown, more dark copper color with off-white head. Dark fruits, caramel, biscuit, and toffee on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with some warmth and spice."

"Mouthfeel is good.  Has a strong, nice lingering flavor.  As well carbonated as it is, it's incredible smooth.  The flavors mesh together perfectly hitting both the sweet and bitter taste buds equally.  Alcohol content is present to the tongue but for a 10% beer it's well masked by the other big flavors which is ok, I think this beer was intend to be a sipper.  Nice drinkability, I like this one a lot.  Really cellarable I've had it fresh and aged and both are awesome.  Another impressive brew from Cigar City."

"Tasty, easy to drink for a high gravity beer. I've never had a Cigar City beer that I didn't like."

"I need more of this!!! This was a perfect bottle to open on this winter night. Amazing in every aspect."
""
""

"Warmer Winter is the epitome of cold weather beer- it's hearty, rich, and most importantly- potent! ...and stacked inside a 22oz bottle, a warm up is on the way!"
"This poured with a very rich color of chocolate brown with a thin layer of tight knit foam. The nose was strong with barley malt and sweet chocolate with a underpinning of dried fruit. The flavor was a barley bomb with huge amounts of dry yet sweet barley malts. The sweetness eased into chocolate with a soft prune finish. The feel was slick and full with almost no carbonation. Very good barley wine, maybe not BCBW but really good."
""
""
"O/D - This was pretty solid. Nearly a barleywine and very pleasant. Complex and enjoyable while being way too easy to drink. Hops weren't too harsh in the profile and the malt complexity was nice. No complaints here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty old ale with a sweet caramelly bent. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, candied fruit, citrus zest, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with dark fruit and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is quite rich and boozy."

"One of the better straight up old ales I've had. This in any kind of barrel would most likely be amazing. I've yet to have a bad beer from CCB."

"Overall: I'm not experienced in Old Ales, but this one will keep me trying others. It might be just a bit too sweet, but in moderation I don't think it'd be a problem with me. I loved the changing of smells and taste, I found that to be one of the fun moments of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this is a pretty nice beer, but not overall that impressed. maybe some wood aged variants of this, or a bourbon barrel aged one could be more up my alley. a little too sweet, but it is definitely a nice dessert beer - as far as old ales go, it's a bit different for the style."
""

"Pours a pretty datk amber with creamy tall head. Aroma of candy apples and a bit of pine hops. Taste is sweet with malt, caramel, green apples. A definite puckering grapefruit hop presence that I was expecting. Thick and chewey mouthfeel. Extremely smooth. Bit of alcohol warmth on the finish. Very interesting brew that is definitely fitting for winter time."
""
""
""
"O: I like this beer as I am a fan of Old Ales in general. The only complaint I would have is that its hard to finish a bomber alone, but with that said, I did so. Its very sweet and syrupy but the woody aspect and grapefruit notes make this beer sneak up on you if you arent careful. I enjoyed it, but definately couldnt drink it every night nor could I drink anything else after having this beer as it makes you have a sugar overload."
""
""
""
""
"O: Solventy after it warms. I am not impressed and am considering dumping the remains of my glass. Not the worst thing I’ve ever had... I guess."
""
""
""
"Thick single finger off white head with excellent retention and lacing on a cloudy, deep amber copper body. Very nice dark fruit aroma with fig, molasses, plum and raisin with hints of caramel. Flavor follows nicely with more fig, plum, raisin and apple for dark fruit, candy sugar, caramel, candied citrus and more hitch borders on being a little too sweet. Medium body which is smooth and oily with moderate carbonation. Very flavorful, a little too sweet though but the booze are definitely well hidden. A very well crafted brew."
""
""
"M: Big medium."
"Overall: Very good beer, I am tempted into buying another just for kicks. No F that I want to buy more because it really good. I have been growing a huge liking to Old Ales and this one has joined the list. Salud!"
""
"Overall: I'm not sure I loved the combination of favors, but I enjoyed the beer enough. The bitter and sweet clashed a bit in my opinion."
"Poured from bomber into chalice glass. Pours cloudy burnt orange with an average tan, orange tinted, head that slowly recedes to average lace. The nose is dominated by caramel, toffee, maple, and more caramel, with a touch of vanilla, and a lightly burnt note as well. The flavor is a bit more of the bitter burnt note dominated by caramel, toffee, maple, and that same touch of vanilla. The body is full with average carbonation and a long caramel and lightly bitter finish. Overall, a pretty good winter warmer and glad to have tried this one out."
"Not a huge fan of this one. I like the full body and chewy mouthfeel, but nothing really stood out with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- An interesting brew, definitely a barleywine feel. Big, bold, lots of layered flavors. It could be lighter, but that's obviously not what it's going for. Absolutely worth picking up, I wish I had a few more to hold onto."
""
""
""
""
"O: The citrusy aromas are quite unusual and interesting for the style. The alcohol is well hidden from the taste, although the amount of sweetness is what will make you need to sip this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The bottle was 2010, poured into a snifter. It pours a deep copper, slight white head. The aroma is sweeet and boozey. Lots of dark fruit notes. Taste like it smells. The dark fruit flavors really shine. It has a bit of an alcohol burn on the finish. The carbonation is moderate, very smooth. I loved it, can not wait to try my 2011 bottle."
""
""
"O - Possibly the sweetest beer I've ever consumed. Way out of balance."
""
""
""
"Overall: Did not enjoy this beer, but I am not sure this is true to the olde ale style either. Aviod this beer!"
""
""
""
""
"O- Could use a little more aging but I think I plucked it at an appropriate time since I'm celebrating Christmas in June!"
""
""
"O - Too cloying for me. I like some aspects of this beer but can't get past the sweetness."
""
""
""
""
"MOREY'S BOTTOM LINE: While very grateful that I had a chance to try this, I found it to be overly sweet. Sweet can be good, but this was just a bit much. Maybe this would have been better when it was fresh? It's probably safe to assume that 2 years in the basement made this even sweeter than it originally was."
""
"O: A nice combination of malt and spices, but way overcarbonated, and with too much residual sweetness"
"O: very nice beer to have on a cold evening. It was around $10, but I can't remember how much exactly for the 750 ml. Not bad."
""
"This bottle was a slight gusher. It poured a medium bodied dark brown with plum highlights and a creamy two finger beige head. The nose is very malty and a tad sweet. It's slightly bready with some toffee and cherry. The flavors are initially very sweet with plenty of cherry, biscuity malt, molasses, sorghum, toffee, and is has an earthy and yeasty finish. It drinks somewhere in between an old ale and aged barleywine. There is definitely a good amount of sugar. It drinks light and a little sticky. There isn't any alcohol presence at all. This is a nice beer to share but drinking an entire bottle by yourself would be a challenge. If you like barleywines this is definitely up your alley. I'm sure a barrel aged version would be phenomenal."
"O: Over the top sweetness with little else going on. I hope that with some time, it would develop dark fruit overtones."
"O - Not very interesting. Tastes good but there's just not a whole lot going on."
""
""
""
"Cigar City just seems to brew really sweet beer like DFH. Good flavor but sweets take over."
"O: What a great little beer. CCB's Warmer Winter was the surprise hit of the night. One I look forward to returning to in the future, and if this ever hits a bourbon barrel, the line forms behind me."
"Not bad but a little forgettable... sweetness drags it down a bit which I've noticed often with Cigar City."
""
""
""
"O: I thought I was going to nurse on the whole bottle in one sitting, basically take a couple of hours and enjoy the bottle, but it is way too heavy and cloying. Half the bottle is plenty. A very good beer, I am glad I tried it, but I am not sure I would buy the next iteration. I would like a little more attenuation and a little less carbonation. It is just a little too rich/sweet, but it is a great sipping/desert beer."
""
" The flavor is nice with some citrus from the hops and slight caramel body with a gentle creamines from the yeast with hint of spice and toffee as mentioned in the descriptors from the label. The flavor gets a little more earthy and woody as it goes on and the alcohol comes forward, rich and almost meaty with a hint of raisin. The drinkability is good for an 11% beer, not sure I would rush to get this again, but if available I wouldn't hesitate. I think it is a solid brew and like that it doesn't show its strength all that much."
""
""
""
"Overall: I was worried when I saw the reviews for this and paid $11 for the bottle but it was a good beer. My first ""Old Ale"" and it didn't disappoint."
"I drank one glass and had to drain pour the rest."
""
""
"A thick, cloudy dark mahogany brew with a goodly, stubborn oatmeal colored head and solid lacing. The aroma says brown bread and sweet pine hop and medicinal malt. Oatmeal chocolate nuances, thick and chewy and real high on the olfactory scale. Wow. Immediately followed by another, wow! The flavor just overwhelms the mouth with thick herbal hops and deep dark cereal grain, almost a barleywine deal. Just a lush mix of heavy malt and evergreen with a delicious tart hop bite. The body is full but not gagging, and tiny carbonation makes for a silky feel that caps off a near perfect winter brew. Cigar City maintains its incredible record of awesome brewing!"
"Overall: The carbonation issue is annoying, and the extreme sweetness in the taste is slightly off-putting. Not a bad beer at all, though- it drinks remarkably well for being 11%."
"Overall: Definitely not my favorite old ale. Much better ones out there. This way too sweet for me."
""
""
"This won't age well."
""
"Overall: What a complex beer. So many layers, so many flavours, it's quite an impressive brew. The only thing I don't really enjoy is the immense amount of sweetness."
"This has a bit over a year on it. This beer pours with a big billowing head that recedes to about a cm, leaving some nice lacing. The liquid is a very dark molasses color and is pretty opaque. Aroma is big toffee and caramel with a bit of residual tropical fruityness, and dark fruit. The flavor is similar, but is verging on being too sweet. Caramel candy overtakes some of the toffee flavors. The tropical fruit comes through more clearly in the flavor along with the prune, dark fruit notes. As it warms, it takes on a bit of a Robitussin type taste, but not really in a bad way. Interesting. Mouthfeel is nice and full with pleasant carbonation. Not too hot, very nice and warming and very smooth as well. Very enjoyable beer and if some of the sweetness could be a bit less, and the toffee, a bit more, this would have been more enjoyable for me."
""
""
"This brew is delicious. Very nice balance of malt sweetness with the hop notes. This beer is creative and well crafted. Nice touch on a classic style."
"Very complex, sweet and dry at the same time. Its almost bordering on too sweet, like a Dubbel. Sweetened dark cherries, hints of oranges. For its stature, it sits light, and feels like cherry syrup. a dry woody oak is felt upon exhale. I can see why this isnt a winter warmer anymore. i might categorize it more as a barleywine, but were just speaking semantics now."
""
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a very good beer all around. They really brought all the flavors together very well in it. Very flavorful and enjoyable to sip on this afternoon."
"Pretty good, fairly rich. Would've been easier to finish with a friend."
""
""
"O: I see how it is a Winter beer but it does not get cold enough for me in Florida to see an ideal drinking experience. I could make this an everyday beer up in Michigan though in the freezing cold and heavy snow. Very easy to drink and it will definitely warm you up:)"
"Overall very nice big sugary malty brew with lots of dark fruit notes. Very enjoyable."
"I really wanted to like this beer. It seemed like all the right elements were there but they didn't all mesh. This one loses a lot of points because of how sweet it was. I had a hard time finishing a glass of it let alone the entire bottle. I'm glad I shared it. This is just way too sweet and candy-like for me to want again."
""
""
"This brew pours a muddy red-brown with a huge head that retains very well. The aroma is an interesting mix of toffeed caramel malts and fruits holding hands with a fairly strong hoppy aroma. The taste is syrupy sweet at first, with a really strong fruit offering. It doesn't stay like that for too long though, with a fairly strong hoppiness on the backend to help balance out the sweetness. It's still just a bit too sweet for me though. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and quite coating, it sticks around for a while. The drinkability is about average for such a big beer. Overall, this isn't really my favourite CCB beer, which is saying a lot for their quality, at this is still quite a good beer."
"Overall - Too sweet to be all that good. The flavors are there, but some more fermentation would do this some good. A drier, earthier, less-sweet version of this could be quite good."
"Delicious treat!"
""
""
"O: Much sweeter than expected and very full and boozy. A great drink though, glad to have tried it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer fresh is supposed to have some spicy pine and citrus hops, which might give it a little zip and cut through the sweetness. With a year on it, though, it is a bit too sweet for me."
""
""
"O- Easily the one of the strangest beers I've had on my short BA adventure. After about 15 minutes of sipping, I think I found the flavor profile. Tastes like a Ricola natural cough drop...good thing I like those."
""
""
"O- cloyingly sweet, too sweet."
"Salud!"
"O: A big sticky sweet sipper perfect for winter. Very rich, ripe dark fruit notes and molasses with hints of lighter fruits. 11% abv not detected. Very complex."
"Yikes. Let this one sit a year or five. It has massive potential but is way to young."
""
""
"D/O- Well that's different. Ridiculously sweet. I'd buy the bottle if someone finished the whole thing by themselves. Worth a try but wouldn't go out of my way for again."
"D - A definite sipper... Lots of complexity in every facet... A wonderful holiday seasonal... Definitely has a warming effect on the drinker... If the overall sweetness was dialed down just a notch, this could be an exceptional world class beer..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is a great beer to enjoy and share. I've been avoiding this brew for a few seasons now, but I'm glad I picked it up!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a big, foamy head over a mud-colored body. Head recedes a bit is pretty nonexistent after the first few sips. The nose is dominated by booze and chocolate with subtle undertones of rosemary and some other spices that I couldn't put my thumb on. Taste follows the smell, initially booze again on the front with a spicy chocolate backbone. Subtle hints of toffee and heavy cream are more prevalent as the beer warms. It's quite fizzy on the front of your tongue but finishes pretty clean. Overall, a good introduction to old ales for me. I think I'll cellar my other bottle for a while to see if the boozy nose and taste diminish a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice old ale/barley wine style beer. I was pleased with the malt and citrus hop fusion."
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful dark brownish color with a one finger creamy head. Looks fantastic in the glass. Aroma is pleasant dark fruits, spice, caramel, and slight smokiness. Not a very aromatic smell, but nice. Taste mirrors the smell. I get a nice malty sweetness up front. Tons of dark fruits and spice hitting the palate. Finishes with slight hops that leaves a semi-dry finish. I can detect a slight booziness, but nothing off-putting (especially for an 11% brew). Overall, a great winter warmer/old ale. Although this is a pretty sweet ale, there is enough hop bitterness that keeps this from being too sweet."
"Overall, a pretty nice 'holiday' style of old ale which is favorably spiced. Thick and festive."
""
"This is a nice beer for the winter, heavy and sweet, but I find the American hops clash too much with the malt profile to make it amazing. Still, damned fine and worth a purchase."
""
"interesting beer, different from most winter beers, however still very delicious."
""
""
""
"O= A tasty treat indeed. This is for sure a beer that could be held onto for a very very long time if desired. Tons of complex character that is unique to this beer and a great beer for potential aging. The carbonation is a bit of an issue and it is a little overly sweet for me but the english barleywine style I find is usually a bit too sweet. The larger format bottle will make this a challenge to finish."

"A good beer. I had it this time last year and had a heard time finishing it but i have come a long way since then. Let's see how it tastes next year."
"Mouthfeel was very thick and chewy. I had to slowly sip on the snifter and that was enough for me. A bit sweet for my palate, but worth trying once for sure."
"O: While this was really good and impeccably well-crafted, I prefer Anchor's offerings in 09' 10' way more than this one."
"The beer is russet brown, with an inch of tan head that leaves plenty of lacing on the tulip glass. The aroma brings toffee, malt, alcohol. Nice flavor, and not what I expected from a winter warmer. The beer is sweet and thick, with only a minimal contribution from the spices, which is a refreshing change of pace, as many brews of this ilk are overly spiced. Really sweet, and best in small quantities. A tasty brew, I would certainly have this again, though a small sampling is plenty. Nursing a snifter of this on a cold winter day would be nice."
"O-- Was hard to finish due to sweetness and even shared we did not want more. Spot on in a lot of areas except on how sweet it was. Big negatives on sweetness."
"This one was a real surprise to me, as I was expecting a straight up traditional Winter Warmer and was greeted by more of an Old Ale/Barleywine hybrid with some extra Winter Warmer character thrown in for good measure. It’s no wonder that they opt to often go into the barrel with this one. It’s definitely got some presence to it and a favorable one at that."
"O: Excellent winter warmer. Honestly this one tastes like a great barleywine. Will definitely buy again."
"Ordered a bottle of this a few years ago when I took my mom out for her birthday to the Bethlehem Speakeasy. The beer poured out as what appeared to be a very nice looking red color. I was having a hard time telling since it was so dark in there. The head was thin and a little creamy looking. The smell of the beer was a little spicy and to me was very inviting. The taste of the beer was very nice, spices colliding with some sweet malts that create a nice warming effect. The mouthfeel had a really nice thickness to it, very creamy. Overall I really enjoyed this Winter Warmer, I'd love to try it again one day."
"Very nicely done. Nice to know that some folks in the Sunshine State know how to brew this style."
"Winter warmers seldom excite me, but huge malt bombs that aren't too boozy are quite a treat. The more I think about it, however, this beer is probably more of an English Barleywine than a Winter Warmer, because its ABV is so high. Whatever it is, I might get my hands on it again in the future."
"overall, the age did it good"
"D: honestly was not an easy drinking brew and was a definite sipper. I could not take a gulp even if I tried to. Pretty decent beer though all around."
"This beer is sweet and chewy enough that it makes me, someone that doesn’t really care about such things, think that this thing must have a million calories in it. Interestingly enough, while this beer is a lot darker and a lot sweeter, I see the similarity in flavor profile between this beer and Lil’ Warmer Double IPA that was made from the second runnings of this beer. For drinking fresh and enjoying the hops, I would seriously like to see the sweetness toned down in this beer; as it is though, it will likely age quite interestingly for a long time (assuming it doesn’t turn into a bottle bomb from all the available residual sugar). I had been forewarned about the excessive sweetness so was ready for it, additionally I was in the mood for something sweet tonight and this has certainly fit the bill; I could actually see myself really not enjoying this beer if I hadn’t known beforehand about the ample sweetness, but as it is, I am quite enjoying this beer. I would likely enjoy it even more though if the sweetness was tamed down considerably."
"O (D) - When I was drinking this, I was told it was a barleywine. I though this was a bizarre barleywine. Now that I'm told it's a winter warmer, it makes more sense. Seems to be a decent beer."
"Overall it's not a bad winter warmer, but definitely on the sweeter side of the spectrum. Other than that it definitely lives up to its title."
"Pours a pretty brown maroon With a decent amount of off-white head. Smells super raisin heavy. Tns and tons of sweet malts and sharp raisin. Tastes sweet but overpowering. Can definitely taste the booziness on this one. Wow. Well carbonated and certainly tasty but a bit much for my taste"
"O-for a long time, on this site it was considered an English barley wine. now i see it categorized as a winter warmer. the bottle labels it as an English barley wine, so i'm just gonna review this as an english ale. to me, its too sweet to be a good winter warmer or barley wine. its just way too sweet. it makes this not too drinkable. i feel it wouldn't be bad with a dessert, shared among friends. finishing off a bottle by yourself might not be fun. i think might be best as a marinade."
"D/O: This strong ale aspires to be like an old ale or English-style barleywine, but is found to be poor and mostly unpalatable regardless of style. Flavors are generally disjunct and unrefined; more specifically, the sweetness is offensive and the astringency is foundation-shaking. Like other strong ales this must be slowly sipped, but the less the sipper considers its qualities the better in this case."
"Overall this is a very tasty brew and drinkability is between moderate and high. It takes a hit for the higher ABV and it is a little excessively sweet but this really is a great beer and I would like to score a couple more bottles to age and see how it turns out."
"a lot a lot of flavors here and is much better as the beer warms up however with all these flavors it is not over whelming"
"Delectably smooth, fabulously rich, full-bodied, very light effervescence. The sweetness really makes this a great dessert replacement. The smooth malt aftertaste is awesome. This is a seriously world class beer. A phenomenal brew."
"D- I am very impressed with this beer. Pretty complex but a nice balance to it as well. Great flavors and good mouthfeel makes this brew a winner."
"D= Pretty sweet for my liking, I would really want to split a bottle and just sip it."
"D- I enjoyed this one quite a bit but it was even warm for me as a winter warmer here in florida... My girl liked it, I'm gonna age it a bit and see what develops"
"D: Although I liked this beer, it was extremely sweet and hard to finish. I had a 750ml bottle and between my husband and I, we had a difficult time drinking it because of the overly sweetness. I think if we had it with dessert or split it between 4 people it would have been less of a problem."
"All in all, this is a good brew. If you do not like SWEET beers, then avoid this. This is probably the sweetest beer I have ever had! Kind of like the candy of the beer world. If you need hops in your brew, do not bother with this one, super sweet malts bury any other flavors. Good, but not great."
"Eminently drinkable."
"Overall, an interesting, fairly complex beer. It was a little on the sweet side for me, but I liked it. Thanks Solan!"
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. There is really nothing negative I can say about Warmer Winter Winter Warmer. Perfect for a cold evening (or a 77 degree afternoon like today in southwest Florida). If you see it, try it. It's that good. Once again, Cigar City does not disappoint."
"The more you drink of this beer the easier it becomes to drink though I think it might be a bit hard for me to have more than one glass in a sitting. I imagine the well hidden alcohol will sneak up on you in a hurry if you let it! With the sweetness it won't appeal to everyones palate but as a seasonal holiday beer it works perfectly."
"D: Easy-drinking for how massive it is."
"Bottle shared at a September Santa Cruz tasting. Pours a light brown amberish color with a fluffy tan head. Fruity with rich caramel and brown sugar, plenty of sweet raisins and toffee. Also some vanilla and hoppy notes. Pretty full-bodied and satisfying."
"Overall this is a great beer; it's full bodied, lush and smooth. Tremendous. It's full and robust with a silky smooth finish of sweet fruits and toffee. The 10% is barely noticeable, extremely well-hidden. Shout-out to Lueken's Liquors online beer store for having all these high quality Cigar City beers available to ship to the Northeast!"
"D- Overall, another awesome brew from CCB that is great to enjoy on the few cold nights we get in Florida. Highly recommended."
"D: Overall, this is a solid brew from one of my favorite breweries. Again, a touch too sweet, but delicious nonetheless. Definitely worth a shot."
"Very sweet right off the start, loads of raisins, and dark sugars, Very little hop flavors poking through the chewy sweetness. Slightly tangy finish with a nice thick mouthfeel, nutty and creamy. Very good for a barleywine but glad I split a bottle becuase it does become a little overwhelming after awhile."
"M - Very silky smooth, creamy, with a little bit of carbonation tickling the roof of my mouth as I take a slug."
"Drinkability - A sipper, and even with a year on it I get quite a bit of warming as I drink it...honestly more warming than I can remember from many beers in this ABV range. However, that just psychologically is warming me up as I sit outside, and honestly does not take away from its drinkability, because as previously mentioned, I do not taste any immediate alcohol when sipping this beer. An enjoyable beer for sure."
"Wow, this is a big brew and a mean winter warmer. I was expecting something lighter, but this is roughly a sweeter barley wine. Pour is a lightish brown with a tan head. Aroma speaks of a stout, lots of chocolate and cream, cocoa; nice alcohol scent. taste starts out a bit like an imperial stout but goes a bit sweeter like a milk stout or some Belgian RIS's. Has some bitterness, making this more of a strong ale, but with some hints of an English barley wine. Very complex brew, and a really pleasant mix to the usual winter styles."
"Drinkability:This is a hugely drinkable winter warmer, very thick and rich, amazing sweet flavors. Great as a dessert beer."
"One of my favorite styles and I like big beers, this beer definitely delivers."
"Overall last years was better for some reason. Too sweet for me and lacked balance."
"The appearance is a dark murky brown with red hues and a half inch white head. Smells of sweet brown sugar and maybe some molasses. You can also definitely smell the booze. Taste for me was just too sweet. Very sugary and tart with a nice boozey background. Creamy mouthfeel, but for me the sweetness was just too much. I cant really describe the type of sweetness that well. I do like some sweet beers like Creme Brulee, but this one just had an awkward sweetness to it. My least favorite brew from Cigar City as of yet."
"D: Drinkability once again comes down to how much did you like it? And how much would you like to have another if you could? It's a pretty solid beer, and it's fairly strong to boot, but more importantly, it's very sweet. I drank two 10 oz glasses and my palate was overwhelmed with flavor. I'd certainly have another though, and it's unique enough that I'd say it's certainly worth trying."
"D - This is a very good Ole Ale. Thanks to given2flybrewing for sharing this one, too."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This being my first taste of a CCB brew, I'm kind of scratching my head regarding all the hub-bub though."
"Drinkability -- Quite good. A little too hop-forward for my tastes, but it's very drinkable and interesting enough for me to stay engaged. While I may not bend over backwards for a second bottle I'm glad I had the first."
"m/d - a bit thick leaves a cooling alcohol tingle. could definitely use some taming. cigar city makes some great brews and their beefed up old ale is ok, probably won't grab this one again."
"Poured into a snifter. Color is a moderate caramel color. Single-finger white head recedes somewhat quickly but leaves a few legs and a bit of lace. The nose is really fruity, with large amounts of raisins, figs, and stone fruits. Good dose of caramel and booze as well. The taste focuses on fruit and alcohol, with a bit of malty sweetness. Feel is a bit boozy, but melds well with the flavors. A nice sipper."
"D - This isn't horrible, but not great. I think it's decent as far as a winter warmer goes, but wouldn't seek this out."
"If your not a huge spice beer fan this is a good beer for you as it introduces you to the style or gives you just enough spice to get the style but not so much you can't drink a good amount. Mild recommendation."
"Extremely drinkable, carbonation is perfect and lusty."
"D: This one is giving me a bit of trouble, was hoping it would be more of a malt bomb but it came forward with some hops. For me an old ale is like drinking caramel syrup. It has a certain viscosity that I want, and this beer just doesn't have that. A bit too crisp."
"I've had this one once before, a while back. Glad to see it held up as well blind. Really an enjoyable beer to sip slowly and enjoy over an hour of taking it easy during the cooler months."
"D- Easy to drink, tasty."
"Overall I wasn't a huge fan of this beer but like almost every other CCB beverage I've had it's unique. Worth a shot."
"Bitter grapefruit mingles with sweet caramel and brown sugar. The hop bitterness offsets the rich profile, making it sweet without being overbearing. Wow, this is pretty damn good. My preconceived notions were far off. The beer finishes with dates, spices, sweet caramel, pine, and moderately bitter grapefruit and orange. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky, with a perfect level of carbonation. This is a great Old Ale."
"overall - very enjoyable and drinkable beer. I look forward to having one with some age on it."
"D--Well, not sure I would sit down and drink a bunch of this, you definitely can taste the burn in this one. Not the Hunahpu I was hoping to try first, but a nice introduction to Cigar City. Recommended."
"D-a little hot but a nice complexity to it, well balanced and big bold flavors. Lose the booze and it would have been pretty solid."
"Very deep, dark, mahogany color, with a big, rocky ecru colored head. Aromas of cocoa, caramel and spicy, earthy hops. On the palate, malt dominates, in a very good way, with brown sugar, raisins and caramel, accented nicely by zesty, citrusy hops. An excellent old ale, and something to look forward to for those forced to endure Florida's winters."
"D: This brew doesn't taste like 10%. It won't be too hard to finish the bottle."
"I really enjoyed this beer, I just wish I had the whole bottle to myself. The flavor profile was just delicious."
"Chestnut brown in color-good sized head that fades though their is still an ongoing 1/8"" left the whole way down. Nice lacing. Nice, heavy and malty aroma-slight brett notes. Dried fruits and vanilla. Caramel and sweet, sticky malt goodness upfront flavorwise. Very toffee like. Some hop bitterness. Again the dried fruit. Has a definate nuttiness to it as well. Very, and I mean very, slight alcohol tinge. Very solid and full mouthfeel-borders on creamy. Really a solid beer all around. Almost too easy to drink. Worth laying some down as well I would think."
"Added noted-- as it warms... so does the alcohol sensation. My chest and stomach are now nicely toasty and feeling good!"
"Overall, a decent old ale. Better than others but, I still think HotD makes their old ale near the top of the style. CCB made a nice offering with this one. I am happy I got a chance to try it. Fairly drinkable."
"Tired of imperial stouts for cold weather? Well, try out WWWW."
"Overall, I remain consistently impressed with Cigar City beers. I liked this one a lot despite its sweetness, and it makes a very nice dessert beer."
"Poured into a chalice a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy light tan head, with some nice small islands and sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some slight citrus/pine notes, chocolate/toffee. The taste is malty, sweet, slight citrus/pine notes in the finish, nice touch of chocolate/toffee. Medium body, at 10% ABV it's hidden pretty well. Very Drinkable, another very nice brew from CC."
"The beer is more carbonated than expected, which is a pleasant surprise, it is a little light bodied for an old ale. The beer is very well balanced and has a nice dry finish. This beer is complex, well balanced, and the 10% abv is very well hidden. I will have no problem drinking the entire bottle, and I will definitely seek this beer out in the future as well as all the barrel aged versions."
"This beer turned Melissa on to old ales, and I have to agree that it was quite well made. The body is phenomenal, and I like the texture that the carbonation brings on."
"Definitely drinkable due to the fresh taste and light carbonation. I am sure time would not hurt this one as it is mostly sweet malt flavors and some spices which I cannot identify."
"Overall one of the best things I have had from CCB hands down. This was beyond a winner for me and I am thrilled to have another bottle to go back to. Hard to say if it will get better, as it was darn near perfect now. I must try in my opinion if you are big on the style."
"D: It's a decent old ale. I bet it will get better with time."
"Ruby red with a dense off-white head with great retention and nice lacing, this is one good-looking beer, especially for an old ale. The nose is great! Caramel, brown sugar and plenty hoppy with earthy hops. Quite sweet, there's some spice too, with nutmeg and some alcohol. The palate opens big and sweet with honey, caramel, toffee and an earthy bitterness, leafy and petrichor-like. Full in body with low carbonation, this is solid. Finishing sweet with flavors of toffee and a leafy hop character, I find the sweetness very pleasant; it's far from cloying. Spice is present, lingering on the finish. Great body, I'd drink this again."
"An ok sipper. Nothing i would seek out again."
"d - Thought this was pretty good. Nice sweet caramel and malt smell or taste. Would try again."
"Decent drinkability. Overall a very unique and interesting winter warmer. Once again, Cigar City impresses."
"The sweetness got to me in the end. Even with the significant hop presence, it became a bit cloying towards the bottom of the bottle."
"Medium body, good amount of carbonation. Alcohol is somewhat warming. Could use some age."
"Date currant, alcohol, fig, caramel, citric hops, offsetting rye? Very slight oxidation, which more would be better very elaborate hops, drying and a somewhat cloying sweetness. Look forward to trying this again in a year."
"D - This isn't my favorite Cigar City brew - I'm not sure the high hop bitterness meshes well with the traditional old ale flavors, and things end up seeming muddled rather than complex. I'm curious if this was better fresh, when the citrus was more present - I can imagine it creating a sort of Terry's Chocolate Orange vibe. Definitely not your typical old ale, and glad I split it three ways as 750ml would have been way too much."
"Drinkability: Beyond some slight alcohol warmth here and there, this one goes down fairly gently. A pleasant, enjoyable brew for the winter months be it in the snowy north or sun-soaked south."
"That being said HOLY JESUS THIS IS A GOOD BEER. This makes me want to go out side and streak....btw do you think KFC is still open!?!?! This beer has an akward nose to it sort-a malty but then an odd sweet almost like citrus. This is a true winter in Florida. Even better Cigar City just increased their capacity in Tampa and will be able to share more of this wonderful seasonal beer to the rest of the state. Grab it now....its really good. Its weird chocolatey in the front, middle is citrus-y good-ness, and then SMACK have some coffee! I look forward to more Cigar City's! GREAT JOB!!!"
"I actually drank half of it, and that Vacu-Vin'd the other half so I could taste it again. Tried it again the following night, and felt the same"
"Large bottle, $10.99/DeCiccos in Ardsley, NY/no freshness/vintage info. Pours murky dark brown, with some small chunks floating around and bubbles continuing to rise to the top, the head is medium khaki,thick and frothy, leaving ample, good looking sheeting and webs of lite lace. Ginger snap cookies, holiday spicing, smoky brandy and chocolate in the nose. Brown sugar, cinnimon buns, brandy, booze soaked fruits, tasty, bold brew. Also picking up some woody smoke, and dark chocolate. Sweetness, somewhat balanced by citric hops on the back end. Comlex and heady brew, nice night capper or would be lights out with a chocolate dessert. Nice creation from the impressive brewers from Tampa's Cigar city."
"Taste wow it is awesome. first sips carmel with citrus bittness. then after more exoploring then is some rye notes and chocalte notes. as it warms up it does get a bit boozy but enjoyable. high recommended."
"D: The aroma is tremendous, unfortunately the rest of the beer is not. I'm not sure I'd recommend this one. I suppose it's worth a try, but don't get too excited. This is my first CCB beer and so far I am underwhelmed. They tried to do too much on this one."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a chestnut brown color with a huge pillowy tan head that left crazy sick lacing on the glass, big and chunky. The aroma is sweet; fermented raisins and fig, prunes, molasses and honey. Some piney and tropical fruit hops as well. The taste is of a big rich malt. Light roasted malt with hints of chocolate and coffee followed by the piney and tropical fruit hop characteristics. The rest of the flavor is rounded out with candied oranges, fig, and booze soaked prunes. The feel is big, heavy and chewy. Very sweet overall and sticky. A touch of bitterness pops through in the finish. Not a spicy winter warmer, but a sweet one. The Old Ale label seems to be spot on. Great body and nice boozy sweetness that you typically see in old ales. The brew could use an offset like some smokey/woody flavor or more of a roasted malt. Still very good."
"Would I buy more of it? - yes and yes. Apparently they have a version of this in their ""Humidor Series"" as well. I really want to get me some of that!"
"Nice effort!!!"
"Huge head even with a semi-passive pour, up over three fingers of deep tan foam accompanied by larger bubbles of varied sizes, extremely slow to dissipate, strong webbing of lace left behind all over the glass sides. As a result, you have to wait some time to even get the scents able to show, then golden raisin, fig, milk chocolate, these contrasted nicely by white pepper, crushed clove, dried hay, pine cone, suggestion of white citrus, most compelling is not so much the role call of scents but the constant interplay among them. Full-bodied, bottom heavy and once it gets into your mouth only moves when prodded. Apricot, red cherry, raisin, fig, pear fruit spiced up by nutmeg, clove, allspice and a touch of cumin, cola nut and vanilla bean present and accounted for. The brown sugar element has a somewhat caramelized, cooked quality to it. Plenty of downy fluff in the carbonation, lacks the muscles to lift things up into the air. Very subtle grassiness at the end soaks up some of the extra sugar. No arrow left unused in its quiver when all is said and done."
"mouthfeel is slick with a little stickiness - drinkability is very good but one bomber will do me just fine -10% abv is very well hidden, yet warms the body and mind - as a good winter warmer should - real good stuff."
"Pours a cloudy less than cola brown with a nice big head that fades fairly quickly leaving a reasonable amount of lacing behind 4.25). The smell is a crazy intense balance of hops and sweet malt chocolate caramel...totally love'n it. The mouth feel is medium full bodied lightly carbonated yet tangy of alcohol and creamy smooth. Full flavored, the hoppy balanced sweetness lightly smokey caramel taste lingers nicely. The 10% ABV is a welcomed benny. A real easy drinker. Go for it!"
"A beautiful beer."
"D: One glass is enough and this one is best shared"
"D: An extremely drinkable Old Ale."
"Drinkabilty: after hearing not so good things about this. I really enjoyed the sweet/hop combo this brew has to offer."
"D: This is a dangerous beer! The alcohol is extremely well hidden, to the point that Heather asked me three times what the abv was, and shook her head each time after I told her."
"D: not particularly so. I'm honestly having a bit of trouble getting through it. An interesting introduction to Cigar City."
"2011 Edition. Now it's an Old Ale / English Barleywine + citric hopping. A nearly opaque clouded orange / red tinted medium brown with billowing tan head. Very slowly settles to a quarter inch with thick lacing down the glass. Smell: loads of caramel, dates, and a little raisin. Soft and sweet tropical fruit, mild pineapple and candied citrus, resinous, leafy note. Taste: seriously sweet and syrupy upfront but with loads of hop flavor and bitterness. As with 2010 still overly sweet, but this year’s balances out much more. Upfront a blast of brown sugar, non-maple syrup, orange and pineapple juice. Mint and anise notes mid sip. Orange citrus and a little tropical fruit softness throughout. Syrupy upfront but with enough carbonation to push it to creamy. Much better than 2010, but still too sweet. Bottled 11/7/2011, drank 12/3/2011. 11% (Rating: 4.0 / 4.0 / 4.5 / 4.0 / 3.0)."
"D - This is definitely a sipper of a winter warmer. The alcohol is pretty potent here, but there is plenty of other flavors and aromas happening to keep it from becoming too heavy-handed. I found this to be a bit on the spicy side, although it was still enjoyable."
"A very good beer, & a tummy warmer, so definitely hit the spot on the this one. When the temp has been stuck in the 40s for days in Florida, this is something to pick up & enjoy."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure what to make of this one. I like it, but something's not quite jiving well with me about it. It's not that it's not pungent or flavorful, which is a problem I have with some winter warmers - this one's strong and pungent in all aspects. But it's ... disjointed. There are a lot of powerful, strong notes that don't seem to meld together, really. That being said, it's not really a huge knock (represented by my scores) - perhaps with a little big of age on it, this would be a world class old ale."
"A capped 750ml bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for $10. Poured into my tumbler. The ale appears a dark chestnut color with about a finger or so of ecru foam. Nose and flavors consist of caramel, semisweet chocolate, raisins, mild pine, citrus, figs, dates. Medium to full bodied and amply carbonated. Surprisingly, not much alcohol heat here. Quite drinkable, kept me wanting another pour. Wish I had one to age."
"This beer is hitting all the right notes on a balmy Florida evening."
"Salud!"
"D - Exceptional. A most exquisite, delicious sipper. To drink this is an honor, and a privilege."
"Overall this is a good beer. The fruity and perfume flavors are just a bit too strong for me, though."
"Very hop forward medium body with a lot of earthy dry pine and citrus notes. Hints of lemon peel and grapefruit mostly. This flavor and dry mouthfeel lingers pretty much throughout but is countered mid-palate by a sweet malt profile with hints of caramel, toffee and subtle chocolate. Slightly vinous with hints of dark fruit, mostly grape, plum and raisin. Very complex but a bit unbalanced with possibly to prominent of a dry piny hop character. This will probably open up nicely as it ages and the hops fade, allowing the other flavors to shine through. The high ABV is excellently masked, making this a very quafable beer that is a refreshingly unique take on the style."
"Drink is good. A bit chewy may make this a non-sessionable brew but a damn good taster and a perfect beer for these low ass temprature's we've been having."
"I really picked a great beer to be my first one of 2010. When I bought this, I hoped it would be worth the 10 bucks I spent on it and it really was. I'll be picking up some more of these for sure if I can find them."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is only just above average. The booziness of the brew limits it emensely. Cigar City has done better jobs of hiding the strength of their brews in the past. Overall, pretty solid for the style. Definately a sipper, and one for a cool night. Skal."
"Flavor...wow. Very sweet, raisins, cherries...huge roasted malts and booze. Caramel flavors as well. Very sweet and creamy mouthful. Nice complexity and low-er carbonation. Very tasty beer!"
"pouted into a little tasting glass. pours thick brown with a mocha tan head. nice and roasted aroma, toffee, caramel, chocolate. bit of sweetness. several citrus notes in the smell, and very sweet in taste. thick beer with medium carb."
"Poured into a pint glass. Left about two fingers of light tan head. Has a sweet malt smell. There is a slight roasted character to the aroma with hints of toffee. There is a noticeable alcohol character on the front end which is not surprising at 10% but it mellows as the sip progresses. Has a nice rich sweetness that is on the heavier side but not in a bad way. The roasted malt character is even slighter in the taste as it is overpowered by the sweetness. This one is hard for me to pinpoint the flavors in the sweet character, but overall this a very enjoyable beer. Nice to try a Winter Warmer that is different than others."
"D - This is a well made beer that thoroughly succeeds in its role as a winter warmer. The malt character is excellent, it compares well to the best English and American examples of the style with a complex blend of dark sugar and roasted/caramel malts. The hops balance well and the strong fruity character is an unusual twist on what I would normally expect in this sort of beer. The fruit character works, especially in the aroma, nevertheless I can't help but think that a more traditional pine or earthy hop character might have made for a more balanced and subtle flavor profile. I enjoyed this beer and I would be really interested to see how one would mellow and age for next year."
"(2) this beer IS available in South Florida- south of Orlando (Total Wine Boca, BX Beer Depot are the stores that I know have this)"
"(From notes)Stopped by the brewery while on vacation, but was unable to do any tastings on site. Apparently they are still waiting on some municipal red tape before they are able to serve on site. Had to settle for a bottle of this from a nearby Whole Foods rather than the growler of Jai Alai I was hoping for. Poured a deep copper/orange. Has a sweet caramel malt aroma that gives way to citrusy hops. Quite a bit of sweetness up front in the form of burnt toffee/caramel. The hops comes on at the back, which is a bit odd to me...not bad, just different. Completely agree with the other reviewers on the well hidden alcohol characteristic."
"D - the ABV is definitely masked well, this beer is so good i could certainly get myself into trouble without even knowing it."
"D- Ringing in @ 10% I could have a few of these from a pure drinkability standpoint. Great beer."
"D: Rather good. This is one I will buy quite a few bottles of."
