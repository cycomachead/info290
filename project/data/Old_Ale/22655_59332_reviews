"A very enjoyable beer, but one to be sipped and savored.  The beer"

"These beers make Goose Island's bourbon barrel [heroin addict Black Friday marketing] beers seem like Lite beer."
"Great balance here. I don't know if you'd want to drink an 11.5% old ale without the barrel cutting down the sweetness. This pairs big fruity dark malts — lots of jammy berries and caramel — with dry, almost crisp vanilla oak notes. There's a hint of heat to remind you you're dealing with whiskey. Overall, a wonderfully executed beer."
"Over all I wish I had got a couple more for aging. Looking forward to picking more up next time I'm down south. Very Nice job, StA."

"As someone who has stepped away from regular draft and stepping over to Craft and Local brews, this was a good decision...I like the taste, the smell and not to mention the ABV is always a good thing."

"Another brewery in the area produces a similar beer called ""Wee Heavy Ale."" It is even worse. Same concept, beer mixed with whiskey."

"Dark brown in color with a fingernail of khaki colored head that doesn't last.  Nearly impenetrable to light.  Strong aroma of bourbon greets my nose along with loads of dark malt.  The taste is packed with sweet bourbon and dark malt.  The mouth is thick and chewy."
"Just what an Old Ale should be.  Rich, dense and creamy.  Sweet malts dominate the nose and tongue.  Very mild carbonation makes it an easy sipper and the taste lingers for minutes.  More like a fine dessert wine.  Notes of dark fruit mixed with caramel and dates.  The barrel aging does it well adding notes of vanilla and bourbon but the alcohol is just barely noticable.  Seek it out."

"O: Hell of an Old Ale. Super malty with nice layers of complexity only furthered by adding bourbon barrel aging. Very sweet and smooth but cuts nicely with the sharp alcohol content."
"big and boozy, like the holiday treat 'burbon balls' in liquid form; it's a sipper and one I wish I was sharing rather than knocking back solo; Great example of the style, but not a personal fave that I will seek out again"

"To be fair, I primarily only bought this beer because of the label.  I'm a chemist and I just can't resist science-y inspired booze."
"Mouthfeel: Full bodied and silky"
""
"Unobtanium is good stuff for sure but pales in comparison to its cognac aged brother, Illudium. Still worth a try for sure and I look forward to enjoying the other couple bottles in my cellar."

"O - wonderfully unique appearance and world class aroma ultimately fall short with the overly caustic tastes 3/5"
""

"Good beer. The ABV definitely shines through. Good with the pork tenderloin I'm having tonight too."
""

"O: Excellent, well done brew. Bought in in Pensacola, FL and it was the last bottle in the store. Wasn’t able to find it in Alabama or even in Birmingham, so I’m glad I grabbed it. Well done brew. Not sure if I’ll ever see it again. Drank Aug 1st, 2014 in Decateur, AL."

"O: A sublime sipper from a stellar brewery. Recommended. I liked it as much as the Illudium."

"O: Very glad I was able to get try this beer. Wasn't even on my radar but my trading bud offered it up, I read the reviews and said hell yeah and I have no reservations what so ever. I'd gladly buy and consume this were it available for me. I think it was less than $15 for a BA Old Ale bomber...I'd buy this all damn day!"

"Overall: Big deal."
""

"O: It's a great beer! I would definitely buy it again, and drink it cold. It may age well, and that may give the mouthfeel that extra boost."

"O - The barrel nose is weak. It's a solid beer though and the base beer does shine through as well."

"Fantastic beer that becomes more complex as it warms."

"Pours a clear brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, and banana aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but doesn't really give off any barrel aged aromas or flavors."
""
""
"O: One of my all time favorite Straight to Ale offerings. When I find it, I buy it all."
""
""
""
"D - I wish there was more bourbon character, as it might cut some of the sweetness. Might appeal to lovers of English ales, as the oak is more in line with something like Fuller's Brewer's Reserve. Solid, but not digging it as much as some of the other reviewers."
""
""
""
"O - Huge dark fruits sweet chocolatey malt taste, really nice belgianesque brew"
""
""
"O: This beer was unexpectedly excellent! It only improved with drinking. Highly recommended; I can't wait to get my hands on another bottle."

"Overall a real treat of an English stock/old ale I highly enjoyed and would recommend!"
""
""
""
"Overall, awesome brew. Worth trying for sure. Can't wait to try some more stuff from these guys!"
""
""

"EXCELLENT. BUY IT."
""
"O. Enjoyed this beer..I'm really glad a ""good"" beer come out of Alabama. I live in Clay and would definately stop in to drink all of their Onobtanium. Would definitely recommend this beer..I'm drinking this poured rrom a bomber into my OMMEGANG large tulip I got in a gift pack for Christmas..ENJOY!"

"The mouthfeel on this one is thick and heavy bodied. Perfect for an Old Ale as it forces you to drink slowly and savor the taste. Overall a really flavorful and filling beer that is nice and warming on a cold winter evening."
""
""
""
""
""
"One last note: a lot of Alabama beers, be they from Good People or Avondale or what have you, are overrated by the local reviewing public. I tend to find that Alabama beers have inflated BA scores relative to their quality. This is NOT the case for Unobtanium Old Ale. I'm not a homer, and I think this beer is absolutely world-class."
""
""
"O: Not something I would pound back but definitely you would sip on all night. Amazing complexity."

"Sweet and fruity with a mellow feel, slight alcohol prickle and a hint of spirit. Woody cherry pipe tobacco, ripe banana/plantain, caramel, mild bitterness, hints of bourbon in the aftertaste (from the Buffalo Trace barrel). A rich sipper that I had to get seconds of. Very tasty! Thanks again guys."
"overall this is outstanding beer...i would love to see this brewery do well in the years to come"
"D: Overall, a delicious old ale. But one is enough at this alcohol level."
