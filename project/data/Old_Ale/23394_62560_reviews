"O: At £1.50 a bottle it gets extra marks for the price."

"O: On the whole, this is a well made beer. Not without some minor flaws, but definitely drinkable."

"This is a dark brown beer with a red tint and relatively little head. The nose is fairly strong treacle. The taste is reflective of that, treacle, becoming sweeter after a while and then slightly more minty before a more bitter finish. Simple, but good."

"Overall, this is quite reminiscent of a Belgian dark ale. But a Belgian dark. It isn't quite as yeasty an stacked up with fruit esters as a Belgian dark ale, but one can easily find the similarities in the rich dark fruits, spiciness, breadiness, and booze. The ale is of a very good quality, you can easily tell and it is also quite a bit better than some belgian dark ales that I have had. I would drink this again and am actually pretty interested in having the chocolate beer they do as well."

"This is a tasty, complex, bold and pleasant old ale. Surprisingly drinkable at 8.5% abv."

"500 ml. bottle. Dark colour, with a small off white head that vanishes soon, leaving a small lace. Smell of a damp cellar, chocolate, notes of caramel, red wine. Medium to light (too much light) body, soft palate. TAste of caramel, chocolate red grapes."

"This beer screams mustiness and age, without seeming stale or unpleasant. It is a very interesting combination of flavors that feels a bit disjointed. Still a good beer, and worth trying once. Seems like a hit-or-miss depending on your particular tastes."
""
""
"Overall: Quite decent. Would've preferred a bit more refinement and a slight, slight boost to the body for some desired chewiness."
"Definitely old-tasting, but not in the 'something might be dead and buried here' sense of Thomas Hardy's or the like. That is to say, more fruity, than musty and/or dusty, and lighter in bearing. At any rate, and agreeable enough strong English ale - ageism need not come into play here."

"Complexed and interesting. A very good beer. By far the best beer I have had from the Robinson brewery."
""

"Pours a rusty reddish brown with a small lasting beige head. Aroma is of dark malt, chocolate, some gain notes. Taste of dark caramel malt, chocolate. Light bitter notes. Palate is a medium body, mild carbonation, as a nice sweet chocolate flavor. The finish is a combination of dark caramel and chocolate malt, has more of a chocolate liqueur flavor that lingers with light bitterness. Overall a flavorful and tasty brew."
""
"O: Good beer for the style. Probably would go best on a cold winter evening. Worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Crisp up front with a bit of smoothness, the feel may be the only aspect of this beer that's lacking. It goes just a little tinny, and the thin body can't quite support all the heft."
""
"O - This beer has a lot of great attributes, but they just don't quite come together in the taste, which is where it really counts. According to the label it was awarded the World's Best Ale in 2009, but that's hard for me to believe, unless it's gone downhill in recent years."
""
"O- Great looking and the aroma is unbelievable. The taste and feel fell a little short for me though."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, L1298 bottle code. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, molasses, raisin, apple, toast, dark bread, light nuttiness, earth, pepper, herbal, and light phenolic esters. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, molasses, toast, dark bread, chocolate, apple, raisin, light nuttiness, earth, toffee, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, dark fruit, apple, toast, biscuit, earth, toffee, nuttiness, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; almost no cloying flavors present on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good old ale. Nice flavor complexity, robustness, and balance; very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Strong, malty aroma has a firm fruity overtone, mainly apple with a hint of banana, and touches of caramel, yeast and - varnish? Actually the latter is not really bad. Pours a dark reddish amber, almost mahogany, with a thick and fluffy pale golden tan head. Very appealing! Flavor has a strong malty core and notes of apple, banana and caramel. That darn varnish-like taste pops up, though. Smooth, firm texture has plenty of fizz and leaves a lasting tingle. Finish is malty and fruity. This ale is the cat’s meow!"
"O: For a commercial beer thats easily available it's quite superb and has a wide range of flavours and aromas. To me, it's best to drink this one slowly and at a temperature of 10 degrees C for the fuller flavour."

"330ml bottle, poured into a Leffe chalice. Initially very dark, almost opaque, got lighter and clearer, salmon pink around the edges, colour more copper brown at the end. Aroma was Maris Otter malt and Phenol with a hint of Belgian yeast. Tasted Maris Otter malts, dark chocolate, rasperry and phenol with a hint of belgian yeast. Booze well hidden until the finish where it burned slightly, finish also had a note of espresso. Medium body, very smooth, not much carbonation. Overall a malt forward strong ale, complex but not in the extreme. Could be very good if given a year or two to age."

"This is a pretty good beer, but it could use a fuller, more robust sweetness."

"11.2oz. bottle served in a Celebrator glass. Poured a deep reddish brown with a finger of light tan head. Fruit, molasses and a light hop aroma. Nice and malty with more molasses, caramel and some dark fruit. Fair amount of carbonation. Medium bodied. Hoppier finish than I would have expected from a British beer. Nice example of a British Old Ale."

"Solid B (84-85)"
"Too much carbonation threatens to overwhelm any redeeming flavours."
"All in all, there are positives than negatives to my way of thinking so I'm glad I bought 4, drank 1, and am saving the other 3 bottles for another time."
"Overall nice, good malts, a bit syrupy but not too much, bit too much booze, nice flavors, not what I expected from a UK beer with how big it is, but the hops remind me it is."

"Malty, bready and tasty offering. More caramel, bananas, vanilla, with smooth malty sweetness carrying the weight throughout this one. Decent sipper, higher complexity would lead me give higher ratings for this beer."
""
""
"I remember this one as considerable richer and full-bodied. Goes well with dark chocolate, though."
""
"O: Nah, didn't work out for me. Not a horrible beer but this price and alcoholic strength makes me crave for more."
"very classy and distinctive strong ale"
"D - Not really my cup of tea. A little heavy on the dark sugars for me, but if you like that sort of thing..."
"I dunno. I guess it's just not my thing. I'm hoping that the claim to have ben voted ""World's Best Ale"" happened long before I was drinking ale."
"Drinkability : a nice beer in the English style Old Ale."
"An excellent beer. I left it in the cellar for a year or so to let it calm down and I'd strongly recommend doing this to take the edge off it. Had all the sticky toffee puddingness and caramelised fruit notes that you'd want from this kind of beer, but without being overly-sweet. What i should've done is put two away because i wanted another one straight after and now i have to wait for a year!"
"D: Definitely an interesting -- and enjoyable -- experience, which I hope to repeat sooner rather than later. Recommended."
"This is a beer to enjoy for a longer period of time. The taste changes as the drink goes warmer. Hints of dark fruit get noticeable."
"The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of dark fruit with some sweet toffee notes. The flavor is a mix of toffee, earthy hops, a touch of caramel and chocolate malts and a little bit of hop bitterness. The alcohol is very well hidden. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
