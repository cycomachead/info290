"O:  I feel honored to get to try one of these beauties.  A definite ""share"" beer."
""
""
""
"According to the label, it was bottled in 2011.  Poured a nice inky black, but with very little head.  The taste was exceptional and smooth, with the scotch present the whole time but never overpowering.  Though the head was slight, it did lace the glass nicely as I drank it.  Overall, a wonderful experience."

"O: stunner - admittedly, I have had no other version of Ola Dubh, nor have I had it fresh, but that aside - as a standalone experience, this was elegance defined. An $11 or $12 bottle, well worth every penny - highly recommended."
"As is normal, i guess, somewhere between 16 and 30. Great Scotch barrel notes, as usual, nice rich dark ale underneath. These Ola Dubh's are well worth the expense."
""
"I wouldn't buy this again given the price, but it's more than worth it to give it a go once."
"Enjoyable but I think the 16 year barrels tickle my delicates more so. Caviar"

"Serving type: bottle."

"Based on the reviews I was expecting a lot more from this one. Very underwhelming. Almost tastes flat with some Band-aid smokiness. At least you can pick up the barrel characteristic. Only thing this had going for it."

"Overall / Drinkability:  What an amazing beer!  Rich in flavor and aroma and this may be one of the best beers I've had in quite some time.  Pricey, but worth the experience.  Because the alcohol is well hidden this is a dangerously drinkable beer.  A good slow sipping and savoring beer, but I really wish I had more.  I will have to check out the rest of the line and see if I can save up for another bottle as a special occasion beer."

"O - these Ola Dubh are some of the best and right down tastiest beers I've come across. The Highland Park barrels and this beer recipe were almost meant for one another. Laying out a truly phenomenal experience in a bottle. Hats off to Harviestoun and even to Highland Park for such a treat with the 18 and all the other Ola Dubh bottlings"

"Black thin body with a small fast dissipating head. Aroma is chocolate with a hint of scotch. More it sits, the more it smells like a glass of scotch. Light mouthfeel. Lots of flavor though. Lots of scotch whiskey comes through. Hints of chocolate. Excellent beer."
"Definitely a great beer! The look was just what I hoped for: dark and refined. It smelled almost like an actual cask! The first taste was phenomenal. Once I took that second taste and let my taste buds explore, boom.. Great to the last drop. Idk how much other people have paid but here in Hawaii it was $13.99. To me, totally worth it!"
""
""
""

""
""
"OK, but not the quality expected from an ale this pampered.  The general whiskey aroma and flavor were OK but since the aging takes place in Scotch whisky barrels I expected more of the scotch to come through."
""
""
"MF â€“ Medium-light body (-), medium dry, a bit of a bite on the palate, no head but carbonation creates that bite, smooth but thin with some warming qualities. 3.25"

"D - Enjoyable, but not terribly different than other beers from this series. I enjoyed the 33cl bottle, but probably wouldn't buy it again at this price point. Still, a good example of successfully integrating Scotch and beer."
""
""
"O: I don't know... all of these Ola Dubh's are similar... in memory, this one has the most intense smell of the ones I've had - that translated to the first few sips being superb, but it didn't quite open up and develop like I'd hoped... still, a fantastic dark brew!"
""
""
""
""
"O- The whole time I was saying my weak(as in fairly young and still learning) pallette would appreciate this beer more in 5 years when I can ""really"" enjoy this. That's how good this beer was. Even for me I found it simply masterfull. Everything balanced and nothing harsh. Great barrel blend, excellent base and smoother than a baby's bottom. We'll worth the price tag and my father-in-laws friend felt the same way. Seek this out. Simply world class with almost everything else looking up at it."
""
""
""
"Viscous, oily and warming beer. Taste of coffee. Complex aftertaste - tobacco, whisky, wet wood. Carbonation is low. Mind-blowing old ale."
""
""
"Overall, just a fantastic beer, especially for those who like scotch and sweeter beer offerings that lean towards the port wine side of things. That said, it's classification as an Old Ale is curious to me, especially since the base beer is a porter. Perhaps it's simply one of those beers that truly defies classification. Either way, it's delicious."

"O - Harviestoun doing what they do best, well made traditional BA dark ales. Would love to do a 12/16/18 comparison. I really do not know how tho stands up in that regard, tho certainly not way above."
""
""
""
""
"O: Really great! This beer is solidly outstanding and will be greatly appreciated by whiskey lovers."
""

"Whoa; another masterpiece in this line. Love it. Thick, sultry, and luscious. Love it. Thick, sultry, and luscious. Body is a touch on the soft side, but I can't help but think it fits perfectly here. The tinges of whisky and peat meld seamlessly with the palate and other dark flavors. In spite of its richness, could see having another. Finish is much easier and cleaner than I expected. Sumptuous beer."

"Not my favorite BA beer I've ever had, but there are some good flavors. I wish it was a bit thicker, though."

"Picked this up at a great little beer store in Arlon, Belgium, Miorge Mihoublon. An aggressive pour yields a deep dark brown, nearly black body with a quickly fading caramel-colored one finger head with decent lacing. The nose is very sweet and malt forward initially with hints of caramel, molasses, dark chocolate, and mocha. As it warms, subtle hints of smokey peat emerge. The taste is much more peaty right from the start. Also getting hints of espresso, mocha, caramel, dark fruit, cola, molasses, and prunes. The mouthfeel is slightly thin for the style with light carbonation and a syrupy sweet finish. Overall, this was kind of disappointing. It wasn't as flavorful as I had expected and the peat was too overpowering for my taste."

"Superior beer, tons of flavors for pure pleasure. A highly recommended classic."

"Oh so rounded and oh so tasty. Another great example of how some beers can benefit so greatly from barrel aging. 30 is next!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The ale really hits home with the signature flavors that the Wee-ish of Heavies exude. Its a tremendous beer with impeccable balance and an arsenal of complexity that changes dramatically as the palate acclimates to its power and as the ale releases secret after secret as it warms."
""
""
""

"O: Interesting. Lots of scotch in this one, really cranking it up compared to the 12 year version. The 12 was very mellow, this one is a lot more barrel-forward. Stronger flavors in this one as a result. Has the same smooth body that makes it surprisingly drinkable. Nice sweet chocolate, caramel and vanilla to balance it out too. I don't even like scotch and I enjoyed this."

"overall: damn good, like an aged stout, alcohol is completely hidden and there are also some rauchbier qualities present. Very, very good beer for special occasions."
"Poured into a snifter glass. The beer pours jet black with no head. There's a thin light tan ring around the edge of the glass. There are a few tiny visible bubbles along the side of the glass that are rising to the top. The aroma is so awesome on this beer. I get chocolate, toffee, oak, nuts, and maybe just a touch of smokiness and vanilla. I get some of that malt as well, but it blends so well with the other aromas. The flavor is just as awesome as the aroma, though definitely more scotch heavy than the 16. The taste does follow the nose with those chocolate, toffee, vanilla, oak, nuts, and some smokiness. The smell keeps hitting the nose during each sip, which only helps make you want to drink this more. The body on this beer is surprisingly medium and very smooth. The drinkability is very high on this beer. It's a real treat. This is an excellent beer."

"O - smooth mineral taste, salt and green tea, salty caramel and some aged woody vanilla smoke. Very well put together, amazing beer all around, complex, dynamic and demands your attention. 4.5"

"on tap at the bull and bush cherry creek. listed at 11% abv, not 8%, it pours flat black into a 10oz. chalice with several inches of chalky off white head. the nose is really interesting, deep dark chocolate notes, really scotchy from the barrel, whiskey heavy for sure, with charcoal and peat, as well as vanilla all bombarding the nose. alcohol is well hidden, I cant pick it up too much even when this gets warm. nice woody flavor complimented by dark roasted barley and char from the barrel. tastes more like a spirit than a beer, especially in the finish. very complex, almost no sweetness, very well done brew. the carbonation is slight but its ample, and the body is a full as they come. bitter finish is interesting here, sort of contradicts the whiskey flavors, but its something new. overall a real fancy beer that I was happy to pay 9 bucks for twice. a treat to get stuff like this on tap in the usa."
""
"O - IMO, the 12/16/18yo are all interchangeable. Just subtle differences the older you go."
""
"O: This is the Harviestoun house style on steroids."
"D: I had the option of buying either the 12 year, 16 year, or 18 year and selected this vintage mostly due to reviews on this site. after having this, I would love to do a side-by-side-by-side with all 3 to really pick them apart. one of the most complex English Old Ales ive ever had. I think the time definitely helped..."
""
""
"D - I had thoroughly enjoyed all 3 other Ola Dubh offerings I had tried leading up to this, and this brew was no different. A delicious old ale, with a nice earthy profile that really appeals to me. Great beer!"
""
"O - Great beer, I love Scotch and beer, better than the 30 I had, probably because it is fresher."
"D: A decent drinking brew, but I'll be honest it was a bit of a disappointment. I was looking for something in the ballpark of Rye-on-Rye, but it ended up being its weakling little bro. Perhaps time has taken too much of a toll on this one."
""

"Overall, very nice. The whisky is nicely integrated into the base beer."
"Overall - I thought that the ages of the barrels would be a gimmicky imperceptible difference. Maybe it is and Harviestoun is changing something besides the barrels. This one definitely seems to be a marked improvement over both the 12 and the 18. I have a 30 left and we'll see if that one is better than this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Smells nice. Big smokey roasty flavours, but not especially enjoyable flavours in the base beer to compliment."
"Overall: just a wonderful beer. The flavor is good if, honestly, unremarkable, but the aroma and that *outstanding* mouthfeel mean I have to grade this one outstandingly high."

"O: 3.5"
""
"O: Very drinkable and tasty, the Scotch compliments the beer so well it is really a remarkable treat. The relatively high level of hops in this series is reminiscent of American stouts like Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout."
""
""
"Goes great with steak! :)"
""
"O: I tried this one in pair with a Ola Dubh Special Reserve 12 which had been aged for the same length of time. I must say that the 12 year version is far better than this one after aging. This one is still a very nice beer. But maybe it doesn't win on aging?"
""
"Good beer, but made me crave an RIS proper."
"O-Spectacular for whiskey fans, but easy enough to drink by someone who may not have a whiskey palette."
"O- This is a very good beer, especially at the start of each taste. However I really don't feel like this was worth it to be completely honest. While it definitely is amazing I would like to know how similar vintages compared with this. A truly special beer and definitely the oldest I have ever tried."

"O: This beer is a lot more drinkable compared to other beers in the style, especially considering its smoothness. No traces of alcohol are present in the taste."
""
""
"Pours a great pitch black in color with a great tan (if bit small) head, and just a little bit of lacing. It has a wonderful scent, part coffee, part whiskey, part malt, part hop, a near perfectly balanced scent that ends with a sweet note, slighty more to the cocoa and bourbon side. Wonderful taste, the whiskey flavor is there, but not overly dominant like so many other such beers; it has a great slight coffee start with a wonderful dark, malty, old ale flavor, a nice sweet finish with a bit of hoppiness to tone it down. It goes down wonderfully smooth for such a bold beer, just a hair more bourbon in the finish than the 16. Absolutely freaking fantastic."
""
"Smoothrich roasty taste with some fizzy furry candy sugar in there. Chocolate dominates the initial flavours before the furry fuzzy takes a more prominent role followed by more earth at the end. A little bit too sweet for me and the body could do with some stuffing to harden it up but still pretty nicely executed and fine."
""
"When I saw that they had this on cask at the old Tap & Table I was really impressed. I ordered one right away because I had enjoyed trying so many of the others. This is the first and only one that I haven't had from a bottle so far. The beer poured out jet black in color, no surprise there. The smell of the beer wasrich with smokey and roasted aromas as well as scotch as well. The taste of the beer was about the same as the 12 to me. The mouthfeel was a little too light I think, The cask aging didn't benefit this beer in my opinion at all. Overall it was worth trying but I would only ever buy the 30 and 40 year ones again."
""
""
""
""
"A tasty and balanced barrel aged old ale. Lots of flavour, well balanced barrel character and good mouthfeel. Nice."
""
""
""
""
"This is a really nice beer, it's super complex. I think I enjoy beers aged in scotch barrels more than bourbon barrels, so I hope more brewers will do that. I think I liked this a smidge better than the 12, but it'd be nice to do a vertical at some point with all of them and see."

"A great cigar ale."
"Final Notes: A good beer to warm up with as we move into the winter months, or for scotch lovers looking to get into beer. Imagine drinking this one after a hot bowl of soup in the dead of winter. Incredible beer. Expensive, but oh-so worth it."
"O- The nice rich smoky flavor has no band-aid or off qualities at all and is supported by a smooth stout with some flavors developing a bit as it warms. Very nice sipper."
"(D)- Each one I have in this series steps it up a notch from the previous one. Right when I thought the 16year was great, this one might even be better."
"I loved this beer. I had two. I wanted to buy a growler of it, but it's pricey."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: Iâ€™ve had no trouble sipping my way through this beer and Iâ€™ll be more than happy to have it, or any of its cousins, again. My overall impression is that this is a wonderfully well made beer and I greatly enjoyed it. My major regret is not being able to sample this series of beers side by side so as to be able to really have a shot at finding how the age of the whisky that was in the barrel affects the base beer. Certainly with this one the whisky notes are smoother and hard to separate out as a different component."
"Creamy, smooth, and light in body for such a packed-out beer, this is definitely one that I would seek out again. It is well-bodied and perfectly carbonated for a great release of flavors. Really solid stuff."
"O/D - More complex than the 16 but in a less pleasant way. Alot more alcohol is noticable and that ashy aspect holds it back. Otherwise it's alright but there are others in the series worth checking out before this IMO."
"-Cheers"
"The aroma was loaded with peat. This was not nearly as smoky as the 16 was and to be honest had a good deal more sweetness to it which was a bit surprising. The scotch and oak aromas were there, but light as this was coming in a little bit under what I had though, but was nonetheless very good. Still extremely rich and complex, I decided to go in and take a taste. Very smooth and creamy, with the body of it coming off very well indeed. It was a full bodied ale for sure, with the carbonation coming in a little bit above some of the others, offering it that nice silky feel at times. The rich flavor of peat was really coming across well. The light flavor of molasses and wood now coming to the front, with a touch of dark chocolate in there as well. Some nice dark fruity notes lingering way in the back, remnants of the barrel for sure"
"Somewhat of a thin mouth feel for a strong beer like this but with a slightly sweeter finish than the 12 and 16 year versions. The balance in this beer is something I won't soon forget. A truly excellent drink for beer geeks and scotch fans alike."
"Drinkability is high. Complex and satisfying, with a clever mouthfeel. Wish I bought more of these when they were available. Next year I'll stock up!"
"Drinkability/Overall-Brilliant, utterly brilliant, an absolute masterpiece of a beer; had I the money and it being avilable I would drink it be the gallon, this is fantastic."
"WS"
"Jet black with 1/4"" tan head, little retention, slight lacing on the glass. Smell is of coffee, chocolate, smokey, peat, roasted malt, oak, hints of whisky. Taste is of coffee, chocolate, oak, smokey, big complex malt and a nice hint of whisky in the finish. Solid mouthfeel, coats palate well, nice use of carbonation, medium to full body. Drinks very well, ABV nowhere near noticeable, very smooth. Would welcome again anytime, solid brew."
"D - The drinkability is quite good. I like this beer a lot. It goes down very smooth, and it has a great flavor to it. Im glad I chose to try this beer, and I look forward to trying more beers by this brewery. I recommend trying this one if you come across it."
"While this might be the best example of scotch-barrel aging I've tried, it's not approaching mind-blowing status. It's a good stout but at this price there are quite a few others I'd rather buy. From what I've heard, I'm just going to bite the bullet and shell out for the good stuff (30 and 40) next time I run into these."
"D: A sipper. This is a special beverage that deserves respect. Strength is a bit limiting, but it can still be enjoyed by the bottle (you don't have to split it, although it would be generous of you)."
"Having previously enjoyed the 18 year old Highland Park whisky, I'm delighted to find the same beauty in this spin-off project from its countrymen - all the weight of a well-made, generous malt, blended into a world-class cocoa-heavy porter, and still full of an island character delivered with the deftest of touches. Sublime, aye, this is."
"D- Very drinkable. Tons of flavor. The whiskey heat could slow you down just a smidge, but not that much. A good brew, but the higher in the series I go, the harder I find it is to defend the price."
"Drinkability is good. At 8% ABV this is probably one of the lighter BA stouts/old ales out there. Highland Park 15 is one of my favorite whiskys, so I was excited to try this beer. The Highland Park barrels come through nicely in the flavor, but the base beer could use a little more of something. Overall, this is still a tasty brew, but could be tweaked a little bit. Looks like I'll have to seek out the other variations."
"Overall it's nice. I tend to prefer the richer old ales but this is light and refreshing with a good barrel character."
"""I think my clothes are gonna smell""...that is the first comment made on the smokey flavor of this super dark beer. If you like campfire type smoke this one is for you. Solid taste the whole way through, the dark molasses look drinks easier than it looks."
"Middle of the pack enjoyment of the series. Must do a vertical one night. Pours black, wiskey smoke aromas. Milk chocolate taste, a little more bitter at the end of the bottle. Bit more than medium mouthfeel. Whiskey is right there.Good drinkability."
"Pours an incredibly dark opaque brown colour with thin tan head. Head retention isn't the best. Mild lacing on the glass. Smells of chocolate, mild smoke and peat, with roasted malt. Flavour is quite sweet with almost no bitterness. Thick mouthfeel, pretty creamy. I think this is much more balanced than the Ola Dubh 16 that I had a couple days ago. Wonderul beer."
"D: I love good smokey scotch so it is no surprise that this beer impressed me. Great balance and drinkability. Get it when you see it."
"You don't have to like whiskey to love this beer. In fact, if you're like me and appreciate the complexity and depth of a quality whiskey but don't necessarily have a palate (or stomach) to tolerate the excessive alcohol that comes with it, Ola Dubh 18 is perfect. Regardless of how your eyes feel about the price tag, I promise your nose and mouth will be grateful. Need more convincing? Go back and remind yourself of what I had to say about flavour."
"Better than the 16, but not as good as the higher numbers."
"D: Perhaps not as lovely as the Ola Dubh 12, but this beer has its own merits and attitude. Like an older whisky, less zesty and punchy, but more sober and smooth. More sippable, less fun. I feel like the 18 is begging for an armchair and a roaring fire. Someday, I hope to oblige it."
"M - Medium body, lightly carbonated."
"Pours just off black with a finger or two of tan head, falling to a thin film and some bubbles. Smells of sweet and chocolate covered dark fruits, some almond here too. Significantly less roastiness and smoke than the 12 and 16. Light peatiness creeps through as well to round it out. Taste is some chocolate caramel and toffee, with more chocolate notes, light smoke and peat in the finish. The light sweetness of the chocolate and caramel really blends nicely with the smoke and peat. Mouthfeel is good but could be a bit fuller but this is a bit more than a sipper for me, goes down quite easily. About on par with the 12 and better than the 16."
"D - one advantage of the less-than-full body & flavor is that you could actually session this beer. Taken in that context the combo of smells and flavors is simply fantastic. However the rarity & price makes that more of a pipe dream..."
"Medium-bodied and more oily than the Gulf (too soon?). It's about average in terms of drinkability for an 8%, but it's unlikely I would drink a second bottle in the same sitting. Barrel-aged brews in general tend to be un-sessionable."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a matching moderate to light level of carbonation. Overall it is not bad but I was not expecting the pete'd aspect of this brew to be this dominating. I'm guessing there is significant inclusion of pete or smoked malts to the grain bill. If not, wow scotch barrels really have influence in a brew."
"Tastes a lot like smooth scotch."
"D- a work of art as I'm concerned. Perfect balance between barrel and brew. Some of these have missed the mark but this one split the arrow. Alls I can say is wow. That being said it is a beast even for 8 abv. The whiskey does let you know your in the big leagues and you won't forget it."
"I was loving this one but will be looking at my recent review for the 12 to see what I felt was different because I remember it being quite similar to this. this bottle was a year old if anyone cares"
"Like all the Ola Dubh beers this is great. I really enjoy this. It is an overall excellent beer. If you are a fan of the others in the series this is a must try."
"It reminded me an Ola Dubh 40, but with much more drinkability. Aged in barrels used for maturation of Single Malt 18 years Whisky, that gives complexity to this different and sensational beer! Color: black that seems black oil. Viscous texture, almost like a liqueur. Aroma of vanilla, oak, whiskey, something smoked, roasted malts, bitter chocolate and coffee, all that just in aroma! Flavor of roasted malt, sweet, sour, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, wine (Madeira and Porto) and especially whiskey and oak wood. Low carbonation and long aftertaste of whiskey, alcohol and coffee. Wonderful!"
"Nice beer. Will drink more of these."
"D- For such a rich and tasty beer, the drinkability is high. I disagree with the brewery and think this is excellent on it's own, however, I'd love to try this with strong cheese or a rich beef or lamb stew. This is a true beer lovers' beer and I think that this is the cream of the crop when it comes to a whisky aged beer!"
"Very enjoyable, the base beer is tasty enough (would make a decent wee heavy on its own), and the cask aging shines through with an excellent choice of whisky to add that special extra element. This one's a winner, I just wish they weren't so expensive--however you DO get what you pay for."
"D: Really enjoying this beer, and will certainly pick up more if I see it in the states. Picked this one up in London. Perfect beer for Sunday night heading into a work week."
"One of the bigger surprises on tap at the CK recently. Now I don't have to shell out for the bottle. It pours a dead black topped by the slightest bit o' bubbles that could be construed as a head. The nose comprises oak, whiskey, vanilla, figs, chocolate, and roasted malts. The taste is very similar, only there's somehow more smoky whiskey and oak notes crammed in there. Damn, son. The body is a light heavy, with a carbonation that is barely able to express itself (it pains me to see it like this) and a rather thick and chewy feel. This is a fine brew, indeed...now I've gotta find a way to sample the other vintages."
"11.2 ounce bottle, bottled in January 2009, bottle # 09207. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about a 1/4 inch tan head that went away pretty quickly. There is a good bit of lacing. Aroma is very nice, it smells like Scotch Whisky (peat, smoke), toffee, chocolate, roasted malt, and some iodine and dark fruit. The brew tastes like peat and smoke (from the Highland Park barrel aging), roasted malt, toffee, and a bit of iodine. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating but it does seem a little bit thin to me. Moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy and enjoyable to drink. I think this is a good brew, but then I also like smoky Scotch Whisky so I'm a bit biased. It is a pricey brew, but I thought it was worth it to try once."
"Impressive bottle that makes the beer look like you need to buy. Pours a tar black but thin. Brown lingering head. Scents of licorice and dark chocolate. Smoke smokey notes but not overpowering. Starts off thin on the tongue. Maybe because I'm use to the imperial stouts. That have lots of residual sugars. Smokey taste right off the bat and a lingering licorice. After taste. Alcohol not very high but I do get bourbon notes as well. It seems like there is something missing but I can't put my finger on it. Overall I would suggest trying another for it's price tag is not worth the taste. My opinion."
"Slightly chewy medium body with a very prominent whiskey barrel presence that overtakes the roasted dark malt presence. Underneath there is a very faint viscous chocolate malt character with hints of espresso bean, toffee, oatmeal and burnt toast. The complex balance suggested in the nose is missing here with an overwhelming bourbon presence. Very hot and sweet overpowering the subtle vanilla, caramel and toffee notes. This beer improves as it warms but overall the bourbon is too strong, overpowering the other flavors."
"Overall, a fairly solid beer. Lots of alcohol characteristics. Very interesting. Fairly drinkable."
"Sweet with a little bitterness, and medium bodied. Also smooth, and easy to drink. Quite complex, with nice carbonation. The flavors and aromas all combine nicely to make a beer which is a pleasure to drink"
"Pours a three finger brown head that leaves some lace. Black, no highlights. Chocolate/whiskey nose. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Flavor is smooth, roasted chocolate and whiskey. Almost a burnt chocolate finish. Bottled Jan 2009. Worth trying - $10.50 for a 330ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Whisky/oak prominent, here. A bit too sweet - could use more smoke or dryness, but it does have a nice whisky and malt character. Still, a bit pricey for what it is, IMO."
"Overall, this is an interesting brew in the line of Ola Dubh. I don't know what the price tag of this thing is in the US, but I'm sure it's pretty high and maybe not good value for money. But, if you've got the money and like single malt, give it a try."
"If you get an opportunity to try these beers they are worth it, the 40 is the best though."
"D - Good, strong flavors do not overwhelm at all. Overall a great beer!"
"Pours a very deep brown color with a small brown head. Booming whiskey notes right off the bat, burnt malt and wood, vanilla and whiffs of alcohol. The booze looms while tasting the brew as well, lots of prune/plum fruit, iodine, charred wood/ash. Complex but just a bit off, heavy medium in body, low carbonation and very easy to drink."
"2009 vintage. This looked the same as the 12 and 16 year Ola Dubhs. It smelled similar (chocolate and caramel and honey wheat and roasted coffee) but lighter and sweeter, without as much peat or oak, and more prominent alcohol. It tasted similar also (roasted barley and burnt coffee and molasses, with a strong oak and peat finish) but with more prominent oak and peat and burnt flavors, and more noticeable alcohol. It was maybe thicker with moderate carbonation, and had a somewhat (relatively) harsh finish. Overall this had a great smell and taste, as the other Ola Dubhs, but it was clear how a couple years of age had benefited the 12 and 16, versus this fresh 18 year. The others were more mellow and had a bit of added depth and complexity and delicate sense. If given the choice between a 16 and 18 that were both fresh (or aged the same amount), it would probably be difficult to justify paying the extra bit for the 18."
"D = This is a very drinkable beer. I would recommend it for dessert or for any occasion when a whisky would be appropriate. This would also pair well with lamb."
"- Very easy and smooth to drink, just the right carbonation... cost me 6 tickets to get it... overall a super good dark old ale and being as old as it was... it certainly showed in the wonderful flavor and balance... a must have if you can!"
"This is a highly complex ale, and probably my favorite so far out of the Ola Dubh series (I've also had 12 and 30). Wonderfully smooth, and easy to drink. I wish I had a 750ml or 22oz bomber of this, rather than just 11.2 ounces. Certainly one to be savored. Highly recommended."
"Frankly, of the two, I preferred the 12, but this is still excellent stuff."
"Had this on cask at the Brick Store Pub, as a gravity pour. I'm a big fan of this series of beers and of the brewery in general, but this particular one didn't resonate with me quite as much as some of the others. In fact, I found it to be a little much. Still good, mind you, but a bit over the top and not quite as smooth as the older ones, and perhaps a bit hotter than even the 12. Regardless, absolutely wonderful to see this at the Brick Store and lovely to taste this. Pours black with no head, but a slight ring around the glass. The whisky is extremely prominent in the nose, with a lot of alcohol heat, peat, ash, dark malt, and chocolate notes. The taste also exhibits huge whisky flavor with lots of heat and peat, some berry flavors, and caramel. The mouthfeel is smooth but hot. A little much overall, perhaps the beer itself will mellow a bit with time if there is some of this put away at the brewery. I much prefer the 30 or 40, or really even the 16."
"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Bottle No. 12610. ABV is 8.0%. Pitch black colour, big tan head. The aroma of the 18 is less distinct than the 12 and 16, notes of sweet malts, almonds, brown sugar and oak, with a moderate roastiness, notes of chocolate and mild coffee. The flavour is excellent, distinct notes of whisky oak cask, peaty smoke, hints of tar, also roasted notes of coffee, liquorice and dark bitter chocolate. Well rounded, with just the right sweetness and a pleasant bitterness in the finish. Yummy!"
"From notes. On cask at Rattle-n-Hum in NYC. They also had the 12, 30 and 40.... Black like motor oil, virtually no head, no lacing. SMELL is of molasses, alcoholic heat, wood, roasted grain, and some faint sweetness. Everything else is buried. Long legs. TASTE is very smooth, balanced and complex. Boozy, woody, molasses, some roastiness, and some malty sweetness. FEELS lightly carbonated, viscuous, oily, smooth, big warming at the end. DRINKS like the savoring sipper it is. A very smooth and tasty one, to be sure."
"Overall I thought there was a bit more whiskey influence on the 18 year than in the 12 year, but other than that they seemed very similar."
"This was certainly a very interesting and enjoyable beer and I only hope that the bar that stocks it doesn't run out before I have a chance to come back for more."
"Overall, even though I much prefer the other vintanges, this was still a stellar brew. Recommended for fans of Ola Dubh."
