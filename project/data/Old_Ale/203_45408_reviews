"The taste is malt forward with an assertive but clean bitterness to finish.  Better than their flagship Old Speckled Hen."

"83/100"

"Overall: one of the best beers I've ever tried."
"Overall - A fine English ale. Balanced. Sophisticated. Also, this beer does a fine job of hiding the 6.5% abv. My only knock on this beer is that it might be a little too subtle for its own good."
"Pours a copper-amber with short but dense head.  Smell is malt and the typical fuggles/EKG wet cardboard hops.  Taste is a tad sweet, but has malt and a touch of hops to balance it out, although it feels a bit off on the balance and mouthfeel to me.  Funk on the finish, which would seem out of place if it wasn't an old ale oak-aged blend.  Overall, pretty good, but not great.  Would be worth a side-by-side with Old Peculiar and Olde Suffolk to compare apples to apples."

"O:  I did not have the highest expectations for this beer, so it pleasantly surprised me.  Fairly priced, a decent introduction to the style for those just getting into craft beers."

"Pours a deep clear Amber with a thin light tan head. The aroma is rich and malty with a hint of earthy hops. The flavor is deep malt, dark fruit and caramel, balanced by the hops. A nice weight to the body and a smooth feeling. A great ale"

"Old Crafty Hen - 6.5% ABV. Pours into a short fluffy head with good lacing and retention. Caramel brown body. Small bubbles with very active carbonation. Smells of nutty bread and caramel. All malt on the front nose. Crisp sugars and raisins. A rum filled mid-palate. Great crisp clove and plum back palate. Lingering rum and oak aftertaste. Beautiful rum like charectar. Thick syrup filled mouthfeel. So well rounded. So full. For a malt head this is it-- 4.0. Very good. Highly recommended for the malt lover or those searching for the anti-hop beer."

"Kind of a complex beer, I like it! Just din't feel the oak well.."

""
"Seeing the other scores here, I think it might be worthwhile to find this one on tap."
""

""

"I always used to think that Old Ales were thick, robust and complex but this beer is demonstrating a completely different take. I don't know if that's good or bad. I only know that I prefer what I used to think what an Old Ale was."
""
""
""
"O - An alright beer not the worst ive had. Will not seek out again"
""
""
""
"O: not the best of offering from Morland but it's a fair beer. I'm still not a fan of the clear bottle and I have to wonder if that affects the taste. I'd like to try this on tap and see if there was a difference."
""

"Indeed, if Rhett Butler wanted to find somewhere there was left in life charm and grace, he should have settled in Suffolk, right next to the Morland brewery - Old Crafty Hen is nothing if not charming and graceful. English Old Ales like this one - and the Fullers Vintage Ale, which it strongly resembles - teach one how to relax, properly reflect, and appreciate life."
"O: This is more of a sipping beer even though the ABV is not too high - enjoyable flavors and aromas but it seems a little bigger than it is."
""

"Final Grade: 3.71, a B grade. Old Crafty Hen is a tasty strong English ale, though 'old ale' probably wouldn't have been my first guess on a blind tasting. Style aside, fans of Innis & Gunn will probably appreciate this one, as it offers a somewhat similar flavour profile with a noticeably more varied hop presence (and thus better balance IMO). A great beer to warm your bones on a cold winter's night, and something I'd consider getting again - it paired nicely with some beef stew."
"Overall - Another very tasty enjoyable beer from this brewer. Lots of malty flavour and some nice earthy/fruity flavours to go with it. I'd pick this up again if it was available in single bottle/can formats locally."

"But I am putting up with these authentic old school ales so I can feel more a part of the All Creatures Great and Small world I am visiting through TV. They are constantly drinking ales like this."

"O: a nice old ale with emphasis on malt, nice at room temp"
""

"O: A really nicely executed and wonderfully balanced old ale. While Old Crafty Hen is not the sort of lactic, oaky old ale for which I normally reach, it is still very appealing. All of the traits of Old Speckled Hen, The Tanner's Jack, and Hen's Tooth that I admire seem to have been amplified in this ale. I could see this beer being a wonderful introduction to the world of traditional English old ales and strong ales."

"Bottom line to my Hen House experience is: if you like British ale and have a chance to buy the fourpack, don't pass it up. They're all good and all a little different. Only drawback is the clear bottles risk skunky aromas, but just one of mine even suggested that."
"Overall Impression: For a beer that is ranked this highly on Beeradvocateâ€™s top beers in Britain, I honestly expected more. It is a little too light in body and malt character, and uses obviously American hops, to be considered an English IPA. When compared to the best Ameican IPAs, this would not have a prayer to make the top 50. That being said, it is quite refreshing, light on the palate, and thirst quenching."
"Interestingly, the body, while on the light side of medium, has a powdery touch of dryness to it. It never gets too slick or thin, and displays a consistent crispness while still being smooth, though the crispness just nips."
"O: has some certain qualities worth savoring... increases exponentially in enjoyability as it goes... comes of like an enhanced Old Speckled... very well-balanced aside from the mild alc/yeast bite"

"This is a difficult-to-find brew that I've been hunting for 3 or 4 years. I am happy to report that it has been well worth the hunt and the wait. This one just might make it into my top-10 list!"
"Overall: I bought this in a 4-pack with three other ""Old Hen"" offerings from Morland based on my good opinion of ""Old Speckled Hen"". This one is called a ""superior fine ale"" on the bottle, and by comparison to OSH, it is -- mainly due to the rich maltiness and sweetness (both of which I am a fan). I will look for this again and would consider it something of a special occasion beer. (This has been discussed in the forums [http://beeradvocate.com/community/threads/clear-bottles.23175/], but I'm surprised that there's so little skunkiness [only a slight skunky aroma] as these beers are sold in clear bottles.)"

"O: Very solid brew. I bought a four-pack ""hen house"" sampler from the brewery and this is by far the best of the four"
""
"Taste is a bit too sweet for my taste, as I enjoy the bitter. But a great beer after a dinner, I'd love to try it on tap. Dessert like for my tastes."
""
"Overall - Excellent example of a strong English Ale. Recommended!"
""
"Pours a clear dark copper body with a brief head that settles to a white collar. Big and sweet aromas of predominantly toffee, followed in strength by dark fruit (very fig-like) and a hint of vanilla. Taste carries a big toffee and biscuity blast on the front and mid-palates, with dark fruit (figs, prunes, raisins) and sherry-like notes emerging on the mid to back-palates. A lightly earthy, wet wood-like bitterness lends some balance to the finish. As far as old ales go, this isn't nearly as potent as some of the American best-sellers, but its relatively mild intensity makes it potentially more appealing to a broad audience, while the austerity of flavor profile gives the geekier beer consumer something to revel in."
"overall - a bit disappointed. doesn't seem much different than the regular Old Speckled Hen."
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass and developed a nice creamy, biscuit colored head which lasted and laced reasonably well. Appearance was clear, amber / ruby color with a light aroma of cream and toffee. Taste had notes of caramel, toffee and vanilla with a light, bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was full and creamy. Classic English Ale."
"overall, i like the style and i like the taste. lots of character and easy to drink a few in succession. i like the malitness and want to know how these english beers get this particular taste which no one else seems to be able to produce. the closest thing to them are the german commercial caramel-y beers like the oktoberfests, but these have totally different twists which i really enjoy. anybody know?"

"D: Clear glass strikes again. Moreland needs to fix this, since I can only imagine ever getting skunky beers from them in the US. The scent and taste were not pleasant, and the body was pretty weak. The finish was rough, so it was not easy to drink in any regard. Boo."
""
""
"Fairly sweet brew, pretty malt dominant, with enough hop character to prevent out from being cloying."
""
""
"Had this for a night cap last night.Poured into an imperial nonic a clear rich amber with a thinner white head atop that was gone pretty quickly.Sweet caramel malts and biscuit in the nose,mild yeasty fruity esters as well.Deep caramel and toffee flavors with a faint but noticable shot of drying woody/leafy hops in the finish.Lighter but pretty smooth going down,this is a full on malty English old ale,although not a big and brash it is flavorful in an English subtle way."
""
""
""
"On the whole, this is a pretty pleasant, if not terribly overwhelming beer. There is definitely a bit going on here; some complexity and balance. This is a nice beer for someone not looking to be blown away by one strain of flavor or another--i.e. hop or malt bombs, smoked/barrel-aged monsters, etc... I like this beer a bit more than I expected to, and would return to it again."
""
"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, caramel, and a slight skunk aroma. Taste is much the same with a slight bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but not something I would go for again."
"Very good all-around on this ale. Reminded me a lot of Innis & Gunn's beers."
"Taste is nice caramelly nut (walnut & hazelnut) & barley, juicy orange zest, long spicy herbal-peppery bitterness esp. in finish, toasty bread crust. It has a nice feel."
""
""
""
"Effervescence is pretty pronounced for the style, IMO, and fairly sharp on the tip of the tongue. Body is medium-full. Aftertaste has a whiskey note show up after some more warming, about 30 minutes as well as a bit of hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"Garnet in color with excellent clarity and a collar of creamy foam that stays around for about a minute but leaves no lacing. Aroma is bready and fruity (apples, white pears) with just a hint of alcohol. Flavor was also warmly malty with fruity aspects, but had more focus on raisins and dark fruits than the aroma did. If I had to criticize something, it would be that the lightly hopped bitterness comes across as somewhat murky, unfocused, and nondescript compared to the sharply focused stellar composition of the malt bill. Has a rich mouthfeel without being heavy in texture, and is lightly carbonated. Finish is semi-dry but stubby short in duration."
"It's not really a bitter, but kind of. It's not really a pale ale, but kind of. Not so easy to drink, but not a bad beer, just different...not sure I've had an 'old ale' before."
""
""
"Overall, this is wonderful if you like malty beers. I tend to love English ales and this one was not a let down. Would love to have on cask sometime."
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, itâ€™s a decent beer but there are better beers in the style."

"Price Point - $3.99/500ML Bottle"
"Not bad - quite tasty and rounded. A decent enough beer, although it seems a bit bland and shallow for the style. I can imagine an aged ale with more depth and intensity. Would probably benefit from bottle conditioning. Still, the woody/fruity flavours are nice. Worth trying."
"I had a 2nd bottle the next day at cellar temp and it was much better' the oak was more balanced, the taste more enjoyable. My evaluation went from 'decent' to 'good'. This beer cost me one quarter of that of Yorkshire Stingo and while Stingo is a better beer, this is pretty good one. At less than $ 5 for a 500ml bottle this is a very nice beer to sip on a Sunday."
"One to sit down with and let breath, a sipper to have with a sharp cheddar. Better with something than alone. Certainly worth a go."
"500 ml clear bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear orange/copper color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is toasted malt, toffee, herbal/earthy hops, oak, and a little bit of skunk. The brew tastes like toffee, toasted and caramel malt, nuts, herbal hops, and a bit of tea and fruit. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. I thought it was a decent enough overall brew. I tend to stay away from beers that come in clear bottles, but since it was a new arrival at a local store I hoped that the brew wasn't too old yet. I think it's worth a try."
"Well, all except for the clear glass bottle."
"Crystal clear deep amber copper hue with a fine off white light khaki head. Aroma has an herbal hop note with tobacco leaf notes...mild fruity caramel tones to round it out. Flavor is balanced ripened fruit sweetness with mild earthy/citrus/tobacco notes wrapped around caramel malts with an ongoing earthiness about it. Overall another generic English ale that does absolutely nothing to set itself apart, other than the higher than average 6.5% abv and labeling it a Vintage ale. I knew what I was getting into it's definitely drinkable carbonation on the mouthfeel is a little higher than I wanted but not bad as a whole."
"Overall: A very nice English ale. Went fantastic with fish and chips and I think it would be even better on cask. Definitely something I would pick up again. A little bit weak in aroma, but it more than made up for it in taste."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours an coppery-orange amber. Fine off-white one finger head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, dark fruit and light oak, sadly mixed with light skunking. Taste is mild caramel and bready malt and dark fruit, finishes somewhat dry with a light woody earthy flavor, a little sour and a bit of hops. Subdued flavor, but pleasant. Flavors are not that well integrated. A bit more of the skunkiness in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. A nice ale marred by off taste caused by use of clear bottles. Why do breweries work hard for a nice ale and then allow it to deteriorate in shipping, when the solution is so simple? This would have scored a point higher without the skunking. This is fairly new in the local market, so this bottle is not that old."

"If you are a fan of English ales and bitters, you will probably like this more than most."
"Bright amber with a coppery hue topped by a fluffy beige cap. Plenty of lacing with good head retention. Fruity aroma, earthy and woody with some sugar and leafy hops. Bitterness was nicely balanced and present throughout. Sweetness was sugary, flavour was a bit citrusy and spicy, and there was a slight alcohol presence and old/stale notes. It finished with more of a plum and raisin character, slight woody astringency, and herbal hops. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation, mild dryness, nice texture. Overall, quite enjoyable with plenty of English character."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the English style Old Ale."

"D- Absolutely enjoyable and easy to have more than one back to back."

"Overall, solid. Really enjoying this one. Lovely, as the English might say."
"Poured a 1.5"" off-white head which appeared to exhaust the effervescence in the glass and fade fairly quickly. Body is a quite attractive clear amber, almost like a radiant varnish. Smell is quite complex with an array of malts, hops, toffee, caramel, vanilla. Taste mirrors all the smells but is much milder than expected. A fairly long bitter finish follows and I'd call that a trademark of the Hen trio of beers. All in all this is a good beer but I like the bites of both Speckled Hen and Hen's Tooth better."
"Pours a two-finger cream head that fades very slowly leaving a very good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Earthy hops nose and flavor is caramel and hops. Light lingering bitter aftertaste. Slightly higher ABV is hidden. $4.99 for a 500ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."

"O - very good brew so glad its finally made its way state side."
"M&O: the mouthfeel is mellow and smooth, the body is medium-plus and the flavour is decent though not really complex enough. I think this blend is not bad at all â€“ Iâ€™m wondering what it might be like if bottle-conditionedâ€¦?"
"I've only tried two old ales at this point (Old Peculiar and this one) and I definitely prefer OP over OCH."
"D - I would not recommend this beer and probably not drink it again myself unless in dire need. Stick to Old Speckled Hen for a tastier AND mor affordable experience"
"Overall - A pretty good example of an old ale and also of barrel aging done fairly well... a decent GK brew - who would have thought it..."
"D: Very enjoyable and an excellent surprise just brought back from England!"
"One small note, 'Old 5X' isn't sold, it is a 12% Oak aged (3 years) brew that is blended into other GK beers."
"Other comments: This is their Speckled Hen ale mixed with their 5X Old Ale (aged in oak vats) which is the same beer they blend with to make their scrumptious Suffolk Olde Ale. This makes 2 beers that GK do well!"
