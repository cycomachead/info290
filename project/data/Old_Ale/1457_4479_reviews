"12 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours fairly crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, brown sugar, raisin, plum, cherry, pear, apple, light chocolate, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt, fruity/earthy yeast, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, brown sugar, chocolate, raisin, plum, cherry, pear, apple, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, chocolate, brown sugar, raisin, plum, cherry, pear, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming lingering after the finish. Overall this is a very good old ale style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"Overall - 4/5"

"A bit of a darker ale. Never have been a huge fan of the ""ale"" smell, and this one is about the same as the rest. It's got flavor, that is for sure. Not bad at all."

"Chestnut brown body with a small tan head. Brown bread, light spice, maybe a touch of molasses. Yeasty bready. Mild sweetness. Smooth and easy drinking. Good stuff."

"O- Well Ive had this one on tap and have brought it home in bottles over the last few years, this year seems to be less chocolaty / cherries. Still good beer that represents the style well, I work in this part of Mi. a lot so I get to stay up with the brewery more than others. Jackhammer is always one of my favorites, even with this being slightly off compared to other years."

"Overall I thought this was a good a beer, it was also a good and pretty solid example of the style, none of the flavors or aromas seemed out of place and they both had a good amount of complexity. This beer had good drinkability for the style, it was smooth, not too boozy, and the flavors did a job at holding my attention with their complexity, I might be inclined to drink a couple bottles if I had nothing to do in the mourning. What I liked the most about this beer was the how true to style and complex it was, I also really liked the appearance, it's a good looking Old Ale. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was the only thing that seemed off for the style and I think it would much better suit this beer if it was a little thicker with a little less carbonation. I would buy this beer again, it's a pretty affordable Old Ale, which isn't too common for the style, I will be picking up a couple more to put in the cellar, I think they may have some potential for ageing and I recommend this to anyone who likes the style, it's a nice example of what an Old Ale should be like. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I didn't have my hopes set too high since Arbor can be pretty hit or miss but this one turned out pretty good and I thought it represented the style nicely. It's not going to take the place of Bell's Third Coast Old Ale as my favorite of the style, but it's still a good and solid example that I enjoyed drinking. Thanks for the tasty Old Ale Arbor Brewing Company."

"overall- this is a good beer. I have enjoyed it many times at the brewpub and would definitely get it again if i see it on tap. i would most likely buy it again if i saw it on shelf for a good price (~$12 a 6-pack and $4 a 12 oz serving.)"

"A pretty amazing Old Ale, very clean but the flavors keep up with complexities and making it interesting to drink. Going to throw the rest of this bottle at a 12 month old cheddar. A sleeper beer, one that most beer geeks are missing out on."
"Would drink again. Would be a good beer to switch things up with."

"D- It's really a decent sipper. Obviously not something to session, but something to contemplate during a cold Michigan winter. Overall, it's pretty much a ""hit"" from a brewery that tends to be kinda' hit-or-miss for me."
"Dark caramel color with a thin head that hung on for a good amount of time. Lacing fails to stick to the glass. I left the yeast sediment in the bottle. A good aroma for the style. I smell toffee, grass, gingerbread, and some yeast esters. Unfortunately the flavor does not live up to the aroma. A little too much caramel malt for my taste. Tastes a tad artificial but is not too bad. Bready flavor with a touch of ginger. Mildly hopped with just a faint touch of spice and pine. No sign of alcohol. So close to having a good mouthfeel but is just a little too thin. Nicely carbonated however. A decent old ale that just falls short in a couple of areas."
"drinks averagely. too many dominant off-flavors. some good aspects mesh together with those to make an average beer."
"Everything is just ok, nothing offesnive, just very subdued. Makes it pretty much a one and done."
"D - I don't know about calling this an old ale, but it's a nice Belgian-style something."
"D: More like a winter warmer than an old ale. But quite nice."
"D- could drink more then you would think cuz of the 9%abv. hands down the best beer i've ever had from arbor brewing company."
"Overall, I'm not too impressed with this one. It isn't completely terrible, but doesn't have too much going for it."
"Overall, one of the shittiest beers I've ever had. It doesn't have even one redeeming quality. Another brewery I'm done with."
"Taste: The taste is much like the smell. Cloves are really strong and it reminds me of a wheat beer even though it obviously isn't. Alcohol is mild and warms the throat. Very nice."
"bottle from kkulacki. Houston, we have an unreasonable amount of foam. Explosive head overwhelms my tulip glass after pouring just a half inch of beer. Infection? Or just overcarbonated? Beer underneath is a milk-chocolate brown, slightly turgid. Smells slightly hoppy and vegetal like wilted kale. Sweet malt odor underneath. Aroma is reminiscent of an old ale, but something is a bit off. Flavor has a strong malt base, recognizable as a member of the style, but on top of that is a pervasive vegetal tartness that isn't particularly appetizing. Its either from the hops or unwelcome bacteria...and either way its not good. Warming alcohol evident, as well as a bit of a wet cardboard like taste. Mouthfeel medium to full bodied. Arbor is usually hit or miss for me and this one is a miss. Hard to say if its a miss because of their beer-craft or because of their sanitation procedures, but either way its a beer they're selling in bottles and that doesn't taste good."
"Apple juice box or fruit cocktail aroma, with plastic off notes. Alternately roasty and medicinal. Roasty, ashy malt taste with antiseptic tartness. Symptoms of infection...the body is way overcarbonated, and foams up with each sip. Something is amiss here, and I bought this bottle near the source in Ann Arbor. Possibly the single was old or just infected, $2.29 from Main Party Store."
"Beer goes down easily for its style."
"D- For the alcohol and style, this is a pretty easy drinking beer. It is bottle conditioned, but from the flavor, I don't really know where this will go with some age on it. Worth a try none-the-less."
"Mineral-y and piny hop bitterness greets the tongue. Sugary, fruit and caramel malts settle in nicely. Yeasty. Assertive, herbal, piny, and bitter hops come on into the finish, tipping the scales toward a hoppier beer. Some latent sugary caramel in the finish. Medium-full body with a slightly over-carbonated feel. Not bad, and thankfully not a gusher (although this one did seem a little bubbly)."
"As far as Old Ales go, this one really just isn't as good as some of the others that I've had. Worth a try if your from the area, but not something I will buy again."
"Upon first taste you notice the sweetness, with hints of butterscotch. No hop presense at all. Carbonation too high. I thought I was drinking a soda. If you can make it to the 4th beer though, they start to taste better."
"Poured a very dark amber which seemed highly carbonated and had a thick, light brown head that stayed foamy for awhile. Smells sweet, almost belgian-y with maybe a little hop in there. The flavor is a rich olde ale consistant with others that I have tried (and quite good!). It's sweet with a bitter finish and a bit of a tart aftertaste. It's medium-bodied in the mouth and quite drinkable. Seems pretty gentle for 8.5% and well worth the try!"
"mouthfeel is slightly creamy, roasty, bitter, pretty tasty for alcohol content - overall quite a nice old ale from arbor!!"
"D for the aftertaste I would not revisit.not a bad beer despite the negative comments. I am sure some people would like it."
"D: I dig this beer. I should've bought more to sit on a bottle or two..."
"It was good, but I didn't really get much of the rich caramel malt flavors that characterize an old ale to me. Came off fruitier, like a barleywine, and hopped like an American version. The hops still seemed grassier, but there wasn't much flavor, but bitterness"
"Lots of lace and a creamy head on top of a brownish amber body. An aroma of musty yeast. Spicey and fruity, with a noteable aftertaste. Chocolate malts, caramel, barley, warming alcohol. Would be a feature in a side-by-side with Kuhennen ales. Not as satsifying as other old ales I have trade, not the real thing but nice."
"This beer drinks very easily from the perspective of its enticing quaffable qualities, but it does not beckon the imbiber with the desire to sip yet again an again to discover its hidden mysteries."
"Originally reviewed on January 18, 2006. On tap at the brewpub. Pours a cloudy brown/amber/orange with opalescense. Light bready fruit with cherries, bourbon and lime in the aroma. Flavor is a warm alchol, yet still some thickness and not too much depth. Fruit, with a touch of chocolate, maybe some pears. Almost aged like. But overall, restrained alcohol and malt. Not much complex characterisitics. Straightforward and drinkable. Finish is sweet, with a light hoppy dryness."
"A helluva powerful beer. At 8.5% ABV, it was big to say the least. Poured out from the tap to a dark brownish orange color with nearly no head. Low carbonation. Aromas of malt and a touch of alcohol. Taste was malty, with some fermented citrus notes, and dry grain. Mouthfeel was light, but maintained a consistance about itself. Drinkability is fair. Wasn't all that impressed."
"the mouthfeel was very full."
"Deep red with amber highlights. Not much head to speak of. Hint of malt sweetness on the nose, but it's a clean sweetness. No unusual esters going on here. Flavor at first has a pronounced fruity sweetness, almost like cherries. Then a warm alcohol note is followed by a strong bitterness and astringent finish. A fairly well balanced big beer."
"Slàinte!"
"A nice old ale and definitely a true winter warmer. Needs to be served at much warmer temps, though luckily it is only available in a 10 oz. mini-stein that warms up fast. Good value for the price (less than $4) but I'd choose Arbor's Terminator instead for a malt experience. Okay, I often order one and then the other..."
