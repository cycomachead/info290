An aggressive pour yields a deep dark brown, nearly black body with a quickly fading caramel-colored one finger head with decent lacing. The nose is very sweet and malt forward initially with hints of caramel, molasses, dark chocolate, and mocha. As it warms, subtle hints of smokey peat emerge. The taste is much more peaty right from the start. Also getting hints of espresso, mocha, caramel, dark fruit, cola, molasses, and prunes. The mouthfeel is slightly thin for the style with light carbonation and a syrupy sweet finish. Overall, this was kind of disappointing. It wasn't as flavorful as I had expected and the peat was too overpowering for my taste.","beerdrifter","0"

There are a few tiny visible bubbles along the side of the glass that are rising to the top. The aroma is so awesome on this beer. I get chocolate, toffee, oak, nuts, and maybe just a touch of smokiness and vanilla. I get some of that malt as well, but it blends so well with the other aromas. The flavor is just as awesome as the aroma, though definitely more scotch heavy than the 16. The taste does follow the nose with those chocolate, toffee, vanilla, oak, nuts, and some smokiness. The smell keeps hitting the nose during each sip, which only helps make you want to drink this more. The body on this beer is surprisingly medium and very smooth. The drinkability is very high on this beer. It's a real treat. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Jun 25, 2013"

Wonderful taste, the whiskey flavor is there, but not overly dominant like so many other such beers; it has a great slight coffee start with a wonderful dark, malty, old ale flavor, a nice sweet finish with a bit of hoppiness to tone it down.

4.26,1.2,5,4,4.5,4,4,"It reminded me an Ola Dubh 40, but with much more drinkability. Aged in barrels used for maturation of Single Malt 18 years Whisky, that gives complexity to this different and sensational beer! Color: black that seems black oil. Viscous texture, almost like a liqueur. Aroma of vanilla, oak, whiskey, something smoked, roasted malts, bitter chocolate and coffee, all that just in aroma! Flavor of roasted malt, sweet, sour, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, wine (Madeira and Porto) and especially whiskey and oak wood. Low carbonation and long aftertaste of whiskey, alcohol and coffee. Wonderful!","GBalbin","Aug 09, 2010"

I disagree with the brewery and think this is excellent on it's own, however, I'd love to try this with strong cheese or a rich beef or lamb stew.

4.5,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very enjoyable, the base beer is tasty enough (would make a decent wee heavy on its own), and the cask aging shines through with an excellent choice of whisky to add that special extra element. This one's a winner, I just wish they weren't so expensive--however you DO get what you pay for.","IronDjinn","Jul 29, 2010"

4.32,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"One of the bigger surprises on tap at the CK recently. Now I don't have to shell out for the bottle. It pours a dead black topped by the slightest bit o' bubbles that could be construed as a head. The nose comprises oak, whiskey, vanilla, figs, chocolate, and roasted malts. The taste is very similar, only there's somehow more smoky whiskey and oak notes crammed in there. Damn, son. The body is a light heavy, with a carbonation that is barely able to express itself (it pains me to see it like this) and a rather thick and chewy feel. This is a fine brew, indeed...now I've gotta find a way to sample the other vintages.","TMoney2591","Jun 14, 2010"
4.24,0.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"11.2 ounce bottle, bottled in January 2009, bottle # 09207. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about a 1/4 inch tan head that went away pretty quickly. There is a good bit of lacing. Aroma is very nice, it smells like Scotch Whisky (peat, smoke), toffee, chocolate, roasted malt, and some iodine and dark fruit. The brew tastes like peat and smoke (from the Highland Park barrel aging), roasted malt, toffee, and a bit of iodine. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating but it does seem a little bit thin to me. Moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy and enjoyable to drink. I think this is a good brew, but then I also like smoky Scotch Whisky so I'm a bit biased. It is a pricey brew, but I thought it was worth it to try once.","bluejacket74","May 18, 2010"
3.63,-13.8,4,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,"Impressive bottle that makes the beer look like you need to buy. Pours a tar black but thin. Brown lingering head. Scents of licorice and dark chocolate. Smoke smokey notes but not overpowering. Starts off thin on the tongue. Maybe because I'm use to the imperial stouts. That have lots of residual sugars. Smokey taste right off the bat and a lingering licorice. After taste. Alcohol not very high but I do get bourbon notes as well. It seems like there is something missing but I can't put my finger on it. Overall I would suggest trying another for it's price tag is not worth the taste. My opinion.","emagana","Beers"
3.67,-12.8,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Slightly chewy medium body with a very prominent whiskey barrel presence that overtakes the roasted dark malt presence. Underneath there is a very faint viscous chocolate malt character with hints of espresso bean, toffee, oatmeal and burnt toast. The complex balance suggested in the nose is missing here with an overwhelming bourbon presence. Very hot and sweet overpowering the subtle vanilla, caramel and toffee notes. This beer improves as it warms but overall the bourbon is too strong, overpowering the other flavors.","corby112","0"

4.08,-3.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"2009 vintage. This looked the same as the 12 and 16 year Ola Dubhs. It smelled similar (chocolate and caramel and honey wheat and roasted coffee) but lighter and sweeter, without as much peat or oak, and more prominent alcohol. It tasted similar also (roasted barley and burnt coffee and molasses, with a strong oak and peat finish) but with more prominent oak and peat and burnt flavors, and more noticeable alcohol. It was maybe thicker with moderate carbonation, and had a somewhat (relatively) harsh finish. Overall this had a great smell and taste, as the other Ola Dubhs, but it was clear how a couple years of age had benefited the 12 and 16, versus this fresh 18 year. The others were more mellow and had a bit of added depth and complexity and delicate sense. If given the choice between a 16 and 18 that were both fresh (or aged the same amount), it would probably be difficult to justify paying the extra bit for the 18.","Pencible","Jul 18, 2009"

3.9,-7.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Had this on cask at the Brick Store Pub, as a gravity pour. I'm a big fan of this series of beers and of the brewery in general, but this particular one didn't resonate with me quite as much as some of the others. In fact, I found it to be a little much. Still good, mind you, but a bit over the top and not quite as smooth as the older ones, and perhaps a bit hotter than even the 12. Regardless, absolutely wonderful to see this at the Brick Store and lovely to taste this. Pours black with no head, but a slight ring around the glass. The whisky is extremely prominent in the nose, with a lot of alcohol heat, peat, ash, dark malt, and chocolate notes. The taste also exhibits huge whisky flavor with lots of heat and peat, some berry flavors, and caramel. The mouthfeel is smooth but hot. A little much overall, perhaps the beer itself will mellow a bit with time if there is some of this put away at the brewery. I much prefer the 30 or 40, or really even the 16.","Georgiabeer","Feb 19, 2009"
4.66,10.7,5,4,5,5,4.5,"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Bottle No. 12610. ABV is 8.0%. Pitch black colour, big tan head. The aroma of the 18 is less distinct than the 12 and 16, notes of sweet malts, almonds, brown sugar and oak, with a moderate roastiness, notes of chocolate and mild coffee. The flavour is excellent, distinct notes of whisky oak cask, peaty smoke, hints of tar, also roasted notes of coffee, liquorice and dark bitter chocolate. Well rounded, with just the right sweetness and a pleasant bitterness in the finish. Yummy!","Sigmund","Feb 07, 2009"
4.37,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"From notes. On cask at Rattle-n-Hum in NYC. They also had the 12, 30 and 40.... Black like motor oil, virtually no head, no lacing. SMELL is of molasses, alcoholic heat, wood, roasted grain, and some faint sweetness. Everything else is buried. Long legs. TASTE is very smooth, balanced and complex. Boozy, woody, molasses, some roastiness, and some malty sweetness. FEELS lightly carbonated, viscuous, oily, smooth, big warming at the end. DRINKS like the savoring sipper it is. A very smooth and tasty one, to be sure.","sprucetip","Feb 06, 2009"
