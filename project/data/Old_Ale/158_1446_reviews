"Too much of a chocolate taste to be a beer."
""
""
"Poured a rich, cloudy deep reddish brown body with a minimal lacing of tan head. Overall impression of appearance is of an Old Ale indeed, old looking and quite beautiful. Scents begins malty rich, with a massive amount of sweet burnt caramel, molasses, rich chocolate and light roasted malt and supporting notes of dried fruit, cherry and raisin mostly, and warming alcohol. Overall impression of aroma is of a very malt forward Old Ale, with rich supporting aromas lending a warming quality overall. Flavor begins malty sweet with notes of burnt caramel and toffee and nutty malt, balanced by a mild bitterness of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Middle middle opens up further chocolate and roast malt flavors, with a light smokiness and notes of dried cherries, evident, yet light warming alcohol and light notes of leather. Finish is lightly dry with flavors of roasted malt and dark chocolate mingling with notes of caramel, molasses and dried fruit and medium levels of warming alcohol. Aftertaste is lightly sweet at first, with notes of caramel, becoming gradually dry with notes of rich dark chocolate and roast malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a very old feeling Old Ale. It tastes rich, deep and malty, yet is also warming and tastes musty and old. A pleasant combination in this beer that lends it a warming, rich, satisfying quality. Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy and rich with light carbonation and a sticky feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a fantastic Old Ale. Overall this is quite the nice Old Ale. It feels rustic and warming in all respects, as the style should feel. A malt-forward aroma and flavor are aided by warming alcohol and a thick feel to make a rich, satisfying beer."

"o; A pleasant and rather meaty strong ale, approaching barleywine style.  Fine winter warmer."
""
"12oz bottle dated Nov 2014 poured into a fat tulip glass...  Body is murky brown - a shade lighter than expected, with about a finger of almond-hued foam that leaves a few strands and specks of lace.  Aroma primarily of toffee, light cocoa and nutty.  Taste follows the nose with some complex malt flavor...  Rich caramel, toast, hazelnut, with some leafy hops / tobacco on the end - lends to the earthiness of the beer.  A touch of alcohol in the finish, which aging would help diminish.  Mouthfeel is medium-full with slightly high carbonation.  Overall, a delicious winter ale!"

"Pours a nice rich brown with 1-2 fingers creamy tan head with nice lacing.  Nice nose, rich in sweet malt, raisins and currents, plums, burnt brown sugar, almonds.  The grains have really developed with age and come through full and round; heavy raisins, toasted grain, molasses and toffee.  Good carb and a medium body.  A great beer!"
"Pretty frickin awesome. Yep, pretty frickin awesome."
"Very good beer especially for the winter time"

"Overall:  This is a delicious beer!  I love the strong notes of dark chocolate and toasted malt, beautifully balanced with toffee and spice.  I’ll definitely get this again next Christmas!"
""
""
""
"One of the best fall/winter ales out there. Great divide makes many great beers but this is tops. Great color and very smooth. You want to take your time drinking, experience worth it."
""
"Overall: Iv had multiple old ales and this doesnt taste like one. It has a strange toffee/chocolate/coffee character that to me is more like a black ale or imperial porter of sorts. I dont get that molasses taste i love in old ales except for the slightest bit in the finish. Its different and fairly tasty, ill give it that. But as a old ale, it misses the mark. This is one of those beers on here that i feel is overrated"
""
""
""
""
""
"A most impressive winter ale. Massive in flavor and aroma and with a most pleasingly soft and warm impression on the palate.  A must try..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Something on the nose and in the back of the palate about this one.  An over toasted nuttiness / burnt sugar thing that didn't sit well with me.  Otherwise a really nice beer, but something in the darker malts just wasn't in harmony for me."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Full finger of head that dissipated quickly.  Nice lingering lacing.  Pours a mahogany brown amber red.  Smells slightly like malts, hops, spices like cloves maybe but only slight and little else.  Thick in the mouth like a good winter warmer or old English ale should be.  Tastes are malt, hops, something like tea, sugar and spice.  Little bitter aftertaste but very subtle.  Really tasty as it gets to room temperature.  Can't place the fruit notes.  I don't taste any espresso like some reviewers.  Tea and maybe apricots?  It's good.  Hides the abv well.  I could drink a few of these watching the football."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is fun and drinkable. It has a short 1 finger head but lingering lace. The nose is caramel and vanilla with hints of chocolate and spice. The flavor is sweet on the start and underscores the nose with a bitter finish that draws out some espresso notes. Mouthfeel is pleasant and very drinkable. I like it for a winter ale and will look for more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Malty front with a small hop bite in back."
""
"Tea, cocoa, dried grass, straw, drying finish; very nice"
""
""
"This is a good strong winter warmer, high-alcohol and spicy for those cold snowy days.  Another solid offering from Great Divide, who does big beers like this very well."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Despite the 16 months of aging of this seasonal beer,it held up really well; I remember having this in December 2013 and it was good then; I wish the alcohol was hidden a bit better, but it was still good now; If I see this next year, I will gladly buy more."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the first Great Divide brew I've come across that I haven't truly enjoyed. I can't explain it, but it had an odd taste to me. Something I still can't put my finger on, even the next day. Perhaps just me at a bad time, or perhaps a bad bottle. I was surprised that it tasted the way it did, because I did not feel that it was a English Style Old Ale. I might try it again in the future just to be sure."
""
""
"tasty winter warmer.. very little spice, if at all."
"Confused by the high rating."
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  No idea what is wrong here, but this is supposed to be a darn good beer.  I'm getting mediocre to bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Medium body, med carbonation, creamy, warming and slightly hot alcohol makes it a sipper	Pleasantly complex, with a bitter end cleaning off the maltiness. Slightly too bitter. Slightly too warming. Better with hearty food. Nothing amazing but a nice winter warmer for a cold day."
"Side note: Poured from bottle, bought in Oklahoma City, OK, I would definitely buy this treat again. Fun winter brew."
"Nice malty smell, ok taste, finish/aftertaste was unpleasant to me.  Aftertaste was almost like milk mixed with beer.  Not a good combination."
""
""
""
"Smell and taste do not match. Smell is balanced between caramelized malt and herby hops. Taste has too many things going on in it that are not complimentary: the herb profile does not mesh well with the coffee/chocolate note base. Not my favorite beer from this solid brewing company."
"Toffee, molasses, thick malt overwhelms hop character"
""
""
""
"A toffee coffee mess of a beer. I cringed with every sip. Absolutely disgusting. Drank at a reputed bar in NYC so I don't believe it was the tap lines."
"O (4)—I picked this one up on a lark, and I’m a big fan of Great Divide.  It’s probably not in my top favorites of theirs, but it’s a nice beer.  I’d drink again for sure, but maybe not a “must have” in my cellar."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer.   Sweet molasses on the taste.  Smell is not as good.  Something odd on the nose, but not present when tasting the beer."
""
""
"Looks: dark brown very little if any light shining through. Smell: initially grains, bread batter after the pour. Later I only get floral herbaceous hops with minimal malt or grain. Taste: sad to say not my cup of tea. I don't like ale with this flavor profile. It reminds me of a doppelbock gone wrong. It has a nice balance of dark roasted malt with herbal hops. Might be the strong alcohol note. This would be good with a meal just not my preference for a sipping beer. YMMV. Mouth feel: very full almost syrupy.  Overall: If you like old English ales with a darker roast malt and herbal hop and high ABV this could be for you. For me it is better to look else where Samuel Smith for example."

"This is a nice beer for the cold weather. Really warming and inviting, but also a little complex."

"3.76/5: Delicious old ale with a slightly hoppy twist"
"The palate doesn’t immediately explode surprisingly, but layers flavors.  Great Divide Hibernation Ale’s body is thick, chewy, and robust, and has a nice amount of carbonation.  The flavor starts with notes of coffee, chocolate, a touch of alcohol, and a bitter set of preserved black cherries and plums.  As the flavor progresses, it move toward cigar smoke, peat, and citrus pith.  As it ends the, smoke quotation bellies up to the pass, and hammers home a hit of cigar, dark cacao, and piney hops."

"Pours a murky brownish orange with a tan head of foam that leaves lace and refreshes with each tip of the glass. Nose is toffee and bread. Crusty bread and caramel.  Some brightness form hops int eh nose accents a touch of dark fruit. Figs and earth.  If you inhale very deeply you can smell a bit of alcohol on the nose. If you don't you can't .  Taste is rich and malty. bread crusts, toasty malt, brown sugar and toffee.  Earthiness and those dark fruits that seem to have a surprising freshness. A bit of peat.  Some raisin and nuts come to the palate as it warms.  Mouthfeel is full.  tasty and finishes dry with a slight bitterness.  Light bit of warmth from the alcohol."

"O: With the first few sips, I was unimpressed with what seemed to be an unbalanced beer. That opinion changed upwards in correlation with the temperature. Would repeat, and at cellar temperatures."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this would make a great winter warmer; try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- Beautiful rich flavors, stradles the line of several styles. Thick rich sweet malts pair wonderfully with peaty smoked malts, combines with chocolate and coffee notes. Everything comes together wonderfully. Nice warming quality to this beer, decadent and filling."

"This is a great Old Ale that fits perfectly at christmas (and you should celebrate christmas all year round!)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a great beer, plain and simple. It has a lot of rich flavors but they are removed from the palate once the sip is done which leaves you ready to have another sip immediately. I recommend grabbing it and giving it a shot if you're a fan of higher alcohol stouts and porters. It doesn't taste like a lot of other Old Ales that I've had, but it's good in its own right."

"Dark brown color.  Smells like a brown ale.  Fantastic beer that taste like a toasty malty brown ale some mollasis.  Great medium body with medium carbonation.  Fantastic old ale that I think taste like a brown ale."

"O: I'll need to get used to the style before I can enjoy this one. Definitely has promising notes, and overall a perfect candidate for the style, but my personal aesthetic score would be noticeably lower."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very pleasant ale, unique in flavor and really hides the strength well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer, malty, dry flavor, the warmth would be great for a cold night, has that warming effect on the body, very drinkable for an 8.7% beer. I would like to try this one fresher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: fresh this one is good, but I'd say it ages very nicely. good age sets in in the first year. well worth stocking the cellar here."
""
""
"O: great big beer. We'll balanced dark beer. Big malt balanced with the alcohol and hops. My thought of an old ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit (3/20/15): Ages beautifully. After about 15 months in the cellar, the flavors of toffee, caramel, fig, molasses, and bittersweet chocolate meld even more seamlessly with a silky smooth feel. Will definitely be putting some more of this away to hibernate."

"Pour is red with copper tone and a thin beige head. Nose is a bit green, strong messy malt and some malt sweetness. Not overly strong nose with a hint of booze. Taste is more green, malts are a bit unorganized with sweetness battling toasted almond. Booze in the finish with a medium to full body and lots of carbonation making it feel a bit thin in The finish."

"the trusty tulip; pours a dark red, barely see thru. about a ivory head. getting a lot of roasty notes on the nose, coffee, a bit crackery, some of those dark fruits and chocolate. flavor is a bit roasty too, stouty. a little bite as well, slightly bitter. A strong note of spice, lemon peel. its a pretty complex one"

"O - A nice winter ale with big bold flavors. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"smell out of the bottle is musty leather and chocolate, not so appetizing. pours out a dark cola with a bubbly head, more stinky leather smell. smooth medium feel leads to chocolate malt powder and juicy dark fruits. the leather is in there as well."

""
""
""

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/30/2013. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, cocoa, chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, roasted malt, nuttiness, toast, brown bread, herbal, wood, pepper, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and hop notes; with great strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, nuttiness, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, herbal, floral, wood, light pepper, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, wood, brown sugar, roasted malt, nuttiness, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark malt and moderate hop flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent old ale! All around great balance and complexity of dark malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Poured into a giant Duvel tulip glass bottled on 10/11/13. Pours a chestnut brown, with a beautiful light brown 2 inch head, that leaves behind lots of lace. Smell is toffee, butterscotch, vanilla, pecan, brown sugar, and caramel. Taste is all of that mixed into one, toffee may be most dominant, but really a well rounded beer. Body is medium large, plenty of carbonation, not really dry, and man it is going down much to fast. This is my 3rd bottle of this and it is simply a great beer."
""
""
"Give this one a try, it does not disappoint!"
""
""
"Poured a dark red with a light tan head that faded quickly with little lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, dates, and burnt espresso. Tastes like spicy chocolate, coffee, dark fruit. It's slightly musty like an old shoe (in a good way), and there is a touch of dirt. Mouthfeel is sticky and spicy and burnt; a bit dry. Over all a very good beer that is easy to drink and will warm one well in the winter months. Highly recommended."

"O - An interesting winter warmer. Well done!"

"I am not very familiar with the Old Ale style, but I have always enjoyed this beer. The hops jump out of this more than I expect, with some nice classic roasty undertones. I think I probably drank most of this a little too cold, as it warmed things smoothed out and the hops weren't as over-powering. Definitely let it sit a little bit."
""
"O-really nice beer, would like to grab another bottle and see how it ages"
""
"O: really nice ale. Perfect winter warmer. I'll definitely buy more."
""
""
""
""
"Plenty of carbonation and a slick mouthfeel lets this one prick your tongue with beery goodness, very nice beer over all , but its not some perfect style, its just about right for a winter beer or old ale. I prefer this over sam adams winter lager, sierra nevada celebration, or widmer brrr."
""
""
""

""
""

"Overall a better than average beer. This was a unique beer for me, primarily tasting like coffee (I'm assuming from the malts). I love drinking coffee, the only problem is that it tastes like cheap coffee, therefore kind of leading to a cheap taste. The mouth feel was the let down on this beer for me, just felt too thin, almost watery at times."
""
"O- a rich and robust Old Ale. Full of great and complex malt flavors."
""
""
"Beer is medium bodied, with medium-low carbonation, leading to a mostly smooth (4/5) and slightly foamy (1/5) mouthfeel that feels a bit wrong for the style and flavors: more foaminess and thickness would be appropriate. Ethanol is well-masked by the malt, with little hint of it being noticeable on the palate and in nostrils. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness clinging to the palate."
""
""
""
"Overall: great beer, the aroma is very inviting. Overall the beer is quite earthy and I like it!"
""
"Overall - a tasty complex beer. The more you drink, the more you see in it. My first old ale and I quite like it. Seems to me like an Imperial Brown Ale. Similar flavors but packs a punch."

""
""

"Absolutely in love with this. It's so interesting, so robust, so complex."

"O. I can't remember trying a beer with such a pleasant after taste, that really sticks around. This is a really good seasonal from Great Divide."
""
""
""
"Bought a six pack at Table and Vine. Beautiful dark, cloud amber brown appearance with some patchy lacing on the side. The aromas were very powerful to my nose. A very powerful, roasty malt smell mixed with dry fruit smells like raisins, caramel, and bread. Taste got better as I drank the beer over the evening. A very sweet, sugary flavor. Very hard to describe. Definitely some alcohol mixed with chocolate, cinnamon, grapes, caramel. Mouthfeel was excellent for this drink. Good balance of carbonation mixed with a silky cream body. Overall, man this was a great holiday drink for the winters."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty and powerful beer. Drink with caution."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a dark ruby hue. Nice head of tan foam that laces well and has reasonable retention. Light nose of dark malt, molasses and piney hops. Medium body and carbonation level. The taste is complex and has dark malt (heavy on the chocolate), molasses and a hop undertone. Sweetness is present, but is almost hidden by roast malt bitterness. Alcohol is well hidden. On the finish, a nice oak flavor comes through and lingers along with a light hop flavor. Very good, but not outstanding."
""
""
""
" sweeter side, not a problem with me. If you like roasted malt forward ales this one is for you. This brew is Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost 9 ABV and no mention of alcohol. DRinks easy and good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a murky nut-brown, cloudy and dark with reddish amber hues around the edges. Nose is of coffee, roasted grains, cherries, dark fruit; lemony, piney, herbal bittering hops. Taste is of roasted coffee, unsweetened cocoa powder, cherries, apple, pear, lemon zest. Medium-thick bodied and medium carbonation; appropriate for style. Tasty and complex."
""
""
""
""
"O: An ideal beer for the winter. Full-bodied, heavy, and the dark fruit flavors are perfect for a cold night."

"Overall,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – For the most part it was a very nice drinking Old Ale with an amazing aroma, and a good set of sweet and malty flavors. A little less bitterness may have suited the style and my preferences a bit more, but overall it was a very nice drinking beer."
""
"O: Very interesting combination. I could easily see myself drinking this by a campfire on a cold night or curling up on the couch during a snow storm. It definitely a nice winter brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 3.75 - Not that great for an old ale. Missing that certain aged, bourbon and vanilla characteristic I would want. At 8.7% ABV it's pretty strong but it was bottled on aug 30th this year. I'll try and find a bottle from last year at one of my favorite hole in the wall bottle shops, maybe that will be a bit better."
""
""
"Pours dark brown with a creamy tan head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is caramel with lots of smoke. Flavor of tobacco, yet more smoke, caramel, roasty finish balanced with some nice piney hops at the end. Leaves a taste in my mouth that reminds me of a camp fire. Had lots of winter beers but this one seems like a notch or two above all the rest."
"This was a very interesting ale, I was expecting a more malty, sweet flavour but this to me tastes like a hopy stout."
""
""
"Given that this was bottled a little under 2 months ago, the 'old' essences are rather astounding, even if they're a bit different from those of the progenitors of the style. Nutty and toasty, this one is, and duly warming, in that 'don't know it 'til it hits you' sort of way. Good stuff."
""
"O - wonderful ale to sip on as temperatures start to drop."

""

"I would recommend this to a friend and would drink it again."
"Feel: smooth, medium body wth soft carbonation."

""

""

""
""
""
""
"Overall-Looks and smells great. Drops off a little in the flavor and mouthfeel, I would've liked the finish to last longer."
"nice and creamy light tan head with a nice dark ruby with hints of dark Brown. strong roasted mt smell with hints of dark fruits and skight caramel notes. light dark fruit flavor dominated by caramel, toffee, and roasted malt notrs. silky feel with very little carbonation. heavy bodied but feels light as well. worth every penny."
"Overall I love Great Divide and this offering did not dissapoint. If your into Old Ales or Malty beers than give this a go."
""
""
""
""
""
"Otherwise unassuming blue and cream label depicting a cross country skiing figure boasts a few awards on the side. Poured into a goblet, dark red-tinged brown, tan head, and I can smell toffee on the nose from about two feet away. Close up it's an herby, roasted grain aroma. Smells like it's gonna be sweet. First sip has my throat tightening a bit from the alcohol - this almost has a wine-like character to it, and not far behind at almost nine percent. Plummy, earthy, and stoutish. Mouthfeel is definitely thick, creamy, and barely carbonated. Stylistically appropriate, hot and heavy, and thoroughly enjoyable!"
""
"This beer seemed to lack a little something - a little more carbonation, sweetness/fruitiness, spice. A bit dry and almost flat tasting. Almost metallic. I guess the funkiness of an old ale seemed to come through. I love Great Divide, but this was not quite up to their usual standard, IMO. The booze was not at all prevalent, and maybe that would have helped more. I'll give this a try again, especially since it's now easily available. But next time, I might age a while to see what that does. Maybe I was just in a weird mood."
"O: real nice old ale with a great hearty, grounded character. Drinks like a classic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Perhaps a touch sweet, but really good nonetheless. I would love to have this stuff available to me locally, I'd put a bunch away in my cellar."

"Overall it was a very good beer, and based on my reading up on the style it seems to be well designed for the category. It was malty and tasty, hid the ABV well, and went down smooth considering it was brewed to pack a wallop. This bottle was well aged and mellow and I will definitely seek this out again as it was very enjoyable."

"Crazy malty all over this thing. On the nose and the profile. Not sure if aging would help tone this down, but it couldn't hurt, I'd imagine. Very smooth feel. Alcohol hidden fairly well. Nice drinker, but I'd tone down the malt sweetness, if it were up to me. It's definitely a winter beer."

"O-good beer. One of my favorite old style english brown ales"
""
""
""
"O: I'm more of a fan of the leathery, highly malted old ales. This was one was just a tad light more for, me it still had nice flavors and was pretty drinkable."
"Overall/Comments: This was my first time having this and it came highly recommended. Very good and complex brew that I could see being perfect for a cold winters night. Classified as an Old Ale at 8.7% ABV. Consumed 1/18/13."

""

"Almost too easy to drink, considering the size. Nice complex flavors and pleasing as all get out."
"I had this last night at my local watering hole,Pints. What a beer! The local distributor had been sitting on a keg of last years, so this was a 2011 vintage. At first pour the beer was cloudy similar to an unfiltered cider, with shades of hazy brown. slight head with a great amount of lacing. I could smell notes of vanilla. The mouth feel was very smooth and subdued; the perfect amount of carbonation. There was a subtle hop flavor, but none of the bitterness remained. Definite notes of brown sugar hit my palate in a big way with some roasted malt. As the beer warmed the flavor intensified and the haze cleared a bit,revealing a shade similar to clear amber. This is how winter beer should be. I could drink this beer year round but especially in the winter."
""
""
"This was a really delicious beer. It had a nice maltiness to it with just enough hop character to round it out. The alcohol for the most part was well hidden. This would make for a very nice beer on a cold winter day."
""
"This beer is just full of flavor, and that's what I am all about. I go back to this beer time and time again and I'm always amazed at just how much complexity they get into it. It's got a big taste and a pretty decent gravity to boot. A sure winner in my book. If you haven't tried it yet, go get some. If you're someone who appreciates a big malty ale you're sure to love it."

"I am a HUGE fan of this winter offering from Great Divide. They make a lot of great beers, and this (for their 12 ounce seasonal offering) is one of the best. The label has also changed over the years. I remember when the label used to be red. Now the label is blue. Who cares what color the label is… I am focused on the flavor of the beer! Bottoms up, people."
"A solid winter ale."

"12 ounce bottle, bottled on September 5, 2012. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear ruby red/brown color with a half-inch light tan head that stayed around for a little while. There's a lot of lacing, too. Aroma is nice, it's smells like toasted malt, dark bread, dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar and some chocolate and coffee. It tastes like dark fruit, caramel, dark bread, nuts, molasses, light smoked malt and chocolate. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good brew, I know I'll buy this again! $1.99 for a single bottle."

"This beer drinks pretty easilt at this abv. A great holiday beer, perfect for a dark dreary day."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: From the complex hops, malts and dark fruit flavor, I really like this winter ale from Great Divide and look forward to it every year when I can get it."
""
""
"Pours a deep copper-brown with a frothy, beige head that holds good retention, and leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas are malty and sweet with brown sugar, caramel, toasty, bready, vanilla, booze. Tastes are similar to aromas with it being very malty, with brown sugar, vanilla, booze, toasted grain, bready, spicy hop, piny finish with some bitterness coming through the sweetness. Body is medium and creamy with ample carbonation. Overall, better than I remembered it being. Nice malty backbone complemented with some hoppy bitterness."
""
""
""
"Overall, the age did this one well. It's easy to drink, really enjoyable and heavily mellowed. I could see buying another six pack this year and aging a few more."
"Pours dark clear amber brown. Very light head that dissapates quickly. Aroma of malt, toffee, acetone, wet dog, biscut-y-ness. Flavor malt-forward with some bittersweet caramel notes. Slight brown sugar sweetness. Surprising hop bite on this one. Maybe just a hint of smoke? I could see having this sitting next to a fire on a cold day. After my first Old Ale style experience (i think it was a bad bottle), this one will make me seek out a few more of the style."
""
""
"A winter gem here! Toasty, malted taste yet really fresh. High ABV but doesn't bog me down, keep going back for more. Warming, smooth and IMO perfect finish. Notes of dark bread, coffee, chocolate, raisin. Hadn't heard anything about it, just picked up a sixer because I had Denver on my mind. So glad I did, probably my nightcapper until Red Chair comes out. It will be hard to see this one go!"
"O: Great beer, and one I'll try again but not necessarily an all-time fave. I let it rest a few minutes after taking it out of the fridge before pouring, to give it a real English ale feel, and the flavors came out. More of a tasting beer (I did not try it with the label's suggestions of 'Romano, an aged hard Dutch cow's milk cheese, grilled beef tenderloin, apple crisp with ginger ice cream"") but I could see how the tartness and smoothness of the beer would enhance strong-flavored food. I think the malty sweetness would go well with some shoofly pie and some lebanon bologna. I'd like to see how the flavors reduce as an ingredient or if used to deglaze a pan. 4/5"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma. This was nicely earthy and very gritty, adding a sense of mystery right off the first whiff. It added warmth, sweetness, and a coolness of nutts, in all of its inclusive glory. The flavoring was equally as interesting, with a stark bitterness and strong musty quality throughout. This beer truly feels like an “Old Ale” through and through, and has enough surprises around each aspect of the beer to keep you coming back for more."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty big flavors going on, reminds me of brown sugar. Would have thought the ABV was higher from both flavor and warmth. Real tasty brew though, a bit expensive but wonderful as a post meal sipper."

""
""
""
""
"Pours tawny in body with bubbly beige head. Aroma of biscuits, cocoa, chocolate syrup, vague cinnamon. Tastes of biscuits covered in chocolate, chocolate syrup. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A bit cola like but tasty. Not warming but filling."
""
"Deep ruby-amber good clarity smallish transient khaki head and decent lacing. Smells earthy, chocolate, chalk, werther's. Taste is powerfully malty, earthen, toffee, roasted, robust, rich. Dark fruits, black cherries, almost a hint of cordials. Yet there is a nice and welcome washing of hop to at least partially reign in the malty beast complexity. So...It's not sweet. Body is medium heavy with a smooth creamy mouthfeel that holds together well. Nice mildly semisweet chocolate and cherry cordial finish. Excellent. Quite a nice ~9% ABV beast. Hibernation indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great blend of pros, with hops, malt, alcohol and warming notes. A perfect winter brew."
""
"Overall, this reminds me of their Old Ruffian Barlywine. I only bought 2 bottles because I've never had it before and wanted to try it first. Now that I have, I'm going back to buy more if there are any left :) Great beer with great aging potential! Try It!"
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass, bottled on Sept. 19, 2012. This pours a dark brown almost black with a small short lived tan head which leaves a lacing. The smells are of a little alcohol, some nice hops along with a load of caramel, some molasses. The feel is thick. The taste is great some nutty toffee, caramel, a hint of coffee. Good stuff."
"Pours a beautiful dark amber with deep jewel-like burgundy hues. The two and a half finger head is cream-colored with excellent retention. Significant wispy lacing. A lot of chocolate on the nose, some booziness, dark fruit and toffee as well. Such a complex brew. A lot of fruit notes initally, black currant, black cherries, plum, caramelized raisins. Chocolate, biscuity accents, and hints of sherry show up midpalate. Bittering hop kick and phenol alcohol join in and carry through the finish. Smooth, silky, full body with low to medium carbonation. Hibernation Ale is a wonderful brew, complex, satisfying, and supplies everything you might be looking for in an old ale. Highly recommended."
"O: great beer, will buy more"
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a medium bodied beer that is a slow sipper and a good beer to look up on a chilly day anywhere in the country."

"Overall a beer I always look forward to. Just what I want on a cold winter night. Wouldnt mind some to set aside for a year or two."

"Great Divide Hibernation Old Ale is very drinkable malt forward Old Ale. Nice job Great Divide!!!!"
"poured into 4 oz taster... I don't know why, but I LOVED this beer. This was very early in our tasting session, and the caramel maltiness still stands out. It Had a great roasted malt profile with a hint of pepper and dark fruit. Just a little bit dry on the mouthfeel, enough to crisp it up a bit. The carbonation on this was spot on and to be quite honest, I could have sipped this for the rest of the tasting and enjoyed every minute of it..."
"Medium brown color along the lines of what I expected. Tasted some roasted qualities that were very pleasing. This beer seemed true to style and certainly exceeded my expectations. A great beer in a great style from a great brewery. Thank you Colorado!"

"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red amber, light tan head and lacing. Light malty aroma. Nice warming caramel and toasted malt start and middle. A quick taste of dark fruits. Finishes with malt and hops. Medium mouth feel. Nicely balanced and delicious. An excellent old ale."

"o - Overall I thought this was a very good beer. It is a bit sweet but certainly not too much so; while I'm not sure I'd want to drink a few of these in one night, I had no problem getting through a full pint of it, and would certainly order it again. A nice sweet old ale that isn't boozy. Worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Overall - Not an impressive old ale. Not even remarkable. It's completely missing a solid malt base to back up the other flavors. Drinkable, but not really worth drinking."
""

"Overall pretty solid, if a little imperfect, and fun to drink. If I am in the right mood I'd want this beer again."

"This Hibernational Ale is a great winter ale. This pours out from the bottle into a dark amber color. It's a bock with a nutty taste. This hearty ale has loads of flavor. It has a milky taste and finishes smooth. Slightly hoppy. Would pair well with a smoked cheese or chowdah!"
""
"O: This is a nice easy beer to drink on a cold winter night – the alcohol gives some warming but is well hidden from the taste."
"Highly recommended!"
""
"This beer poured into my Great Divide glass with a nice off-white head that lasted a while and a nice mahogany color. The aroma was very pleasant with a bit of fruit coming through. The taste was a bit like a Scotch ale to me and I enjoyed this one very much. The mouthfeel was nice and was pretty drinkable considering the 8.7% abv. I enjoyed this a lot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a nice beer to drink when it's could out and the balanced malty, roasty taste makes this easy to drink. The flavor doesn't immediately jump out, but it gradually reveals itself as the beer begins to warm up."
""
"O- Old Ales and Barleywines are the only styles that I have had several times and have never enjoyed one that I have had. Usually they are too sweet, boozy, or syrupy. This beer is outstanding though. Hits a great balance of sweet and hoppy.Very drinkable for the style."
"O - Hibernation is a fantastic old ale, it's strong and tastes like it. Delicious and well worth your time and effort. A great beer if its a little chilly outside."
""
""

"A nice warmer for a cold night. I would have this again."
""
""

"O: A really solid example of the style...not quite as heavy and brutal on the palate as a Barleywine would...but a lot of the same notes in the flavor and aroma. This is a reliable beer if you dig dark fruits and juicy sweetness."
""
""
""
"Of course, if your heater blows out in January, it's wise to have a few of these babies on hand."
""
""
"Malt assault! Could certainly taste dark fruits and hints of caramel on the first sip, not too very hoppy, a heavy mixture of sweet malt, maybe even syrupy. Would certainly like to have again sometime. Makes for a great sipping beer, not much of a gulping brew."

"This beer pours a dark amber with a half inch of white head and sticky lacing. It smells like roasted caramel, malts, and there's a slight boozyness to it. I It also tastes like caramel with a roasted quality. This beer has some nuttiness and tastes kind of like a fig newton. It's got (surprisingly) somewhat of a hoppy after taste mixed with some boozeyness. It has a medium body and leaves a stickiness behind. I would like to see how this beer tastes with some age."
""
""
"Pours a clear brown color with a 1 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a thin film. A nice latticework of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, roasted nuts, and some alcohol. Taste is of toasted/roasted malt, roasted nuts, and some very mild hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium roasty bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium body and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good old ale that is very toasty, roasty, and malty. A bit one dimensional in my opinion."
"Overall I really enjoyed this. This one one was bottled on October 6th so I wasn't getting the hop I may have 3 months ago but I think it's great the way it is. I seem to like anything I have tried in this style. A seasonal must try."
""

"Overall – Not terribly interesting to think about while tasting, but not at all dull either. Good-tasting brew!"
""
""
"Smooth pour into snifter. Dark red, not much head. Nose of dark fruit, nut, rum, and cream. Taste matches well, with a burnt finish and subtly bitter aftertaste. Feel is smooth as can be. Reminds me of a less intense scotch ale. Very drinkable and a deep yet subtle sweetness. Drink this one slow and let it warm as you go."
""
""
"This beer is all over the place, but overall I can't help but feel a bit disappointed since it seems to have some potential about it. Maybe an older bottle would be superior and I'll remember to try it at a later date."
"Overall, this is a decent winter warmer -- it'll certainly get you warm at 8.7%. It at times tastes too medicinal."
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- Where is the body and strength?!?! I'm not sure I could appreciate this one as an old ale! Lacked quite a bit but did have some good qualities along the way. Would like to seek out in bottle form and compare."
""
"Great Divide Hibernation Ale: Pouring the Hibernation Ale into a glass, you would think it is a porter. The head is tan colored and thin, with little lacing. The aroma is robust, with roast malt as the primary note. But when you hold it up to the light, unlike the pitch black porters, some light does get through. Its beer bottle brown, with a hint of ruby coloration. The flavor is marvelous. The deep complex malt does not have any burnt flavor. And the Hibernation Ale is smooth right through to the end, with no bitterness and a finish of warming alcohol. Great Divide has come up with a great winter brew."

"Single finger off white head. Cloudy amber body. Aroma is mostly a light milk chocolate. Lots of lacing. Flavor is more mile chocolate. It's actually very good and unexpected for sure. The aroma is overll light whereas the flavor is bold. Medium to full body and moderate carbonation. Overall a very good beer though I am not sure what genre it should actually be listed as. I will be having this one again."
""
"O: Easy to drink and nice sweet flavor to it as it warms me up. Very good for the season."
"D - Another good brew from GD, I enjoyed this one, would like to age one."
"This beer poured out as a deep brown color with a nice looking cream colored head on top. The head fades into just a ring around the glass. The smell of the beer was nicely balanced between soe hop, malt and some spice aromas. The taste of the beer has a caramel base with some wooden flavors in there and a light spicy bitterness. The mouthfeel was decent I though, drinkable and medium bodied. Overall It's not a terrible beer, worth checking out."

"Overall: Another one for the cellar. Great complexity, which I imagine only gets better with time. Another sipper for sure. A perfect beer to bite back at the cold."
"Bought a sixer of this for $11.99. A nice, high ABV winter warmer that certainly warms you... but it's super delicious too. Some dark fruit flavors, great malt backbone and just enough hops, this beer is complex but well balanced. A bit strong so it'd hard to have more than 1 or 2 of these in a sitting, but it's a solid beer to have a nice, cold night."
"Had in December '11, labelled as being cold-conditioned for a year. Served in a tulip glass, a yellowish-brown-bronzed color, surprisingly murky, and completely opaque, with a small cap of head, creamy in texture and color. Sweet aroma of caramel and toffee, mild cocoa powder, fruity undertones, and a subtle floral quality. Rich taste, sweet, woody, chewy with caramel, notes of figs, raisins, and even a touch of banana, with subtle hints of floral and piney hops peeking in every now and then. Very smooth mouthfeel, on the heavier side of medium-bodied. Pleasantly drinkable."
"Definitely recommended. I should have gotten a growler of it!"

"a colossal beer, pours a dead sexy glowing light brown color with a sticky hoppy looking lace head. smells very english in its malt profile, and has a noticable alcohol aroma. hops are present in the nose too, as is a pleasant toffee waft. taste is huge as well, big big malts up front and a bittersweet hoppy finish. the flavor evolves in the mouth for as long as its held, just expanding constantly. mouthfeel is wonderful as well, with a body that easily stands up to the flavors and is yet somehow more easy drinking than it should be. i cant imagine a more perfect cold weather beer. just fantastic"

"Very sweet, fruity, bready, yeasty aroma wafts above the head. The taste is a mingle between that fruitiness, a bit of alcohol, with a fresh faint hop leaf quality. Nice warmth as it goes down and as it sits in the stomach. The beer makes its presence known. Great Old Ale."

"O: A heavy, fortifying winter brew, perfect for cold nights, wind and snow blowing. Perhaps too sweet at times, but overall, exactly what I’m looking for in winter seasonal (versus Christmas seasonal)."

"O- Ahh, I couldn't think of a better brew to drink to fight the biting cold of winter. Cheers GD."

"This is a damn good beer with nothing wrong about it. It's perfect for the winter season. Rich, malty, just the right amount of hops, and enough alcohol to get you warm."
"This was awesome, maybe a little one-note flavor-wise but a damn good note. Maybe a bit too much like a Yeti Lite but that's hardly a complaint. I certainly wouldn't mind hibernating with a 6-pack of this."
"All in all, an excellent winter warmer which is a model of balance. Go get some."
""
""
"M/O: Full bodied, chewy, astringent at times. Very warming, very complex. This is both a kick ass beer, and a beer that will kick your ass. It is intense! I like it a lot, not a sessionable beer, but an excellent winter warmer, as is its intention."
""

"D: Really amazing, great brew."
"O: A good brew that I will seek out again."

"Hibernation Ale pours a reddish brown color w/ a one finger cocoa head. Big time red highlights when held up to the light. Average lacing on the side of my snifter. I really like the smell of this beer. It's got caramel, chocolate, butterscotch, dark fruit, and smells like a candy bar. Not super complex, but pleasant nonetheless. The flavor is a step down from the nose- big time. Everything is muted, and the super dry finish leaves me wondering what happened to the luxurious, smooth, candy bar nose. This beer would be much higher if the taste and mouthfeel fell in line w/ the smell. Still, it's not bad- and I'm glad I got to try it. Cheers."

""
"O: Good beer. Bready and nice."
"D: Tasty and flavorful and pretty easy to sip on.  As it warms, it becomes a bigger beer than expected, and with the alcohol content, it really necessitates sipping.  If I had more than one of these, though, I'd sip on them throughout the evening.  A great ale for the cooler months.  "

"Haven't had a lot of old ales as a preface. Enjoyed this one thoroughly though. Complex and full. Would like to see how this beer is with some age on it."

""
"Moderately low carbonation, a bit smooth and sticky on the tongue, warming finish. I really enjoyed this one, wish we had saved a few to stick in the cellar but we all liked it too much."
""
""
"O: This is not exactly what I was expecting or wanting, but it's pretty good."
""
"This should be in a catagory of it's own. I've always that of this as a winter Barleywine. Start with a semi-cold one and let it warm completely. This beer really transitions and becomes complex when warm. I've always had it fresh as it's so hard to age because I always end up drinking it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a good winter warmer. The flavor isn't that complex, but it still tastes good. The alcohol level was just right for the style. While the use of some more unique hops might have improved this beer, it is definitely a good beer to sip during the winter."

"Drinkability and Overall Impression: A nicely drinkable beer for sipping slowly. I’ll certainly be happy to have this one again in the future and may look for some to put away in the basement to see what happens with a year or two of bottle age. My overall impression is of a big, warm, richly flavored beer that is well made and well balanced, and well worth trying."
""
""
"overall/drinkability- this was a really amazingly balanced beer and I found it so drinkable that I really found it hard not to drink this beer so quickly, by far best beer I have tried from this brewery and just so delicious probably my favorite winter seasonal beer i have had, really good"
"Another solid beer from Great Divide. Definitely worth a try and comes highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer. It may be my first ""English-style Old Ale"" but it likely won't be my last. Great Divide has another winner."
""
""
"My kind of old ale, enjoyed from a pint glass. Pours a dark pepsi-ruby color with very little head and no lacing. Complex toffee and fruit flavors without being overly rich. Touch of smoke and the dry hopping helps hide the alcohol content. Carbonation is present but not overly fizzy. Drinks easy with savor in every sip."

"Pours a dark copper color with a skim head which gives way to just edging. When you hold the beer to the light the color is revealed as a ruby red color with visible carbonation. The aroma is of dark fruits and of a slight chocolate along with some caramel malt. The taste has a caramel malt backbone with a big chocolate taste in the middle of the the beer, there is then a pear bite of flavor on the backend to finish out the beer. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it was a very good beer, it was a good taste and had a nice aroma."
"O: Good beer for a winter's night. Might not be the first old ale I go to, but certainly pleasing."
"O: There’s always something about Great Divide’s beers that are just so damn good; something that could overshadow even the biggest palate faults. Even better, though, is that there really aren’t that many pitfalls in this beer’s flavor – the unusual lime bite of the hops is just added goodness. With beer like this, Great Divide powers through the realms of both old-world style and American creativity. I don’t know which is represented more, but one thing’s for sure: this old ale style just keeps getting more and more interesting…"
"Don't expect an ""English-Style Old Ale", as the bottle puts it. Expect an American-styled one, one with a serious punch of hops to go with all that sweetness. I won't mind sipping from the glass for the rest of the night."
"This malt bomb is balanced excellently and it's hard to choose a favorite ""old ale"" winter seasonal between this and southern tiers Old man. For now they bot get the same grade. Both great in different ways. Old man in a way that makes for a great winter drinking beer, hibernation ale in a way that makes for a true great winter warmer."
"Having heard great things about this brew I was anxious to try it. However, I was quickly disappointed. It poured a amber brown color that was appealing. The head consistency was average. The flavor was weak and the beer itself lacked the carbonation to carry it through the palette. The flavor faded fast and left me waiting for something that it couldn't deliver. I will try again...may have been a bad batch. This is unlikely as the location I was at does very brisk business."
"O- A good old ale. The nose is great and the other aspects are solid. Worth trying."
"Drinkability is good, especially considering a fairly high ABV."
"O: This is a very good winter beer. Not the best one I have had, but very solid. For having so much alcohol, it sure is covered up by the sweetness."
"O- A very nice brew that would be interesting to age for a year or two."
"Overall - I didn't have high expectations for this beer but its a really nice winter warmer for sure."
"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Pours ruby brown with quickly dissipating head but good lacing. Aroma is caramel with some chocolate and dark fruit. Taste is toffee, licorice, raisin, and spicy hops. Rather chewy mouthfeel but nicely balanced with nice hop finish. Alchohol is restrained throughout despite 8.7% ABV. This one was better than expected - I nice selection for a cool autumn afternoon of watching football."
"A nice winter warmer from GDBC and a good example of why it's the most wonderful time of the year (for this beer lover)!"
"O: Very nice old ale. Chocolate is a nice touch, it's not strong but it adds a nice element. One of my favorite bang for the buck old ales. A little boozy fresh but that's to be expected."
"Good price for a 6er if this is a style you like, I can't see having more than 1 of them in a night though, my palate was kinda over it by the end of 12oz."
"O - It is similar to dogfish head raison d'etre, but less bitter. great beer!"
"D- i've only had a handful of old ales, actually only two or three, and i would expect an americanized version to be all pumped up but damn, this one is a malt bomb! dry hopping is a nice touch and adds to the already present complexity. it's a nice offering as a winter warmer and whether it's been aged or not, it's really just a big bold brown ale at heart."
"*I will do a side by side of a year-old bottle soon."
"Poured into a North Coast pint glass. Appearance is a very clear amber/cranberry color with about 1/4"" tan colored head. From the get go, I could tell this was a very malt-forward beer just by the fragrant aroma released from pouring. Smell is heavy malt, sweet candy, and dried strawberry. Taste is strong in malt, plums, some slight booze, and a bit of bitterness in the back palate which lingers through to the finish. It's a smooth drinker with light to medium carbonation. If it weren't for the slight booziness, It would be even easier to drink. I'll continue to buy this in the future."
"D - Good beer for a chilly evening and a piping hot bowel of beef stew."
"O - A very good ale. Great for a cold night."
"Overall - I really liked it. It had some of those winter warmer characteristics, great, complex malts. Perfect for a chilly day."
"Overall a really nice tasting beer, lots of big flavors and nose, I enjoyed it"
"I usually view Great Divide as a weekday brewery: they make things that are good for everyday drinking, but nothing that stands out as terribly special. This one, however, stands out as terribly special. It's got an extremely rich aroma, dominated by coffee and leather, and a malty-rich taste that just gets more and more complex as it warms. Goes well with Dvorak and Brahms. Definitely a good one to have standing by in the basement during a cold New England winter."
"o- love this beer. very good english old ale. i am not a huge fan of this style normaly but this one is something i look forward to every year"
"Taste is huge - strong peat-roasted malts, followed by a dry hops sharpness. The strong 8.7% alcohol isn't too apparent, but it is there underneath all the powerful flavors. I get even more of a pungent licorice, raisin, and tobacco taste upon slight warming. A potent, heavy, and complex ale. High marks here."
"Hibernation does a great job of showcasing wintry flavors. They don’t completely come together, and the alcohol could be a tad better-integrated, but the beer would be good on a cold night."
"D - I'm not too familiar with this style, but it's a good beer. I agree with others that this beer could probably spend some time aging to fully accentuate the malt character."
"Nary a quarter finger of light tan head, quick dissipation with broken layer of head, a bit of lacing. Light dark (ugh( brown head, some golden highlights in bottom of glass under light, pretty light for the style. Good amount of caramel, peat, some well worn leather, hops pretty tame, floral. Taste mirrors nose, though note the leather is pretty muted. Mouthfeel as aspected a bit above medium, good effervescence. This is a really nice old ale, the characteristics re tobacco and leather, that I look for. Wish I had the patience to age this a bit longer. Well done."
"Ov- Excellent winter beer. A year does wondering in mellowing it out and deepen the complexity. One of my favorites."
"One might not expect so much flavor in this beer. This being the second time of have had it, I know the flavor was not a fluke. Well done Great Divide!"
"O- This is the best Old Ale I've had to date. I'm glad I picked up a case of this when I was at Shangy's, just sad it went so quickly. This beer has almost a year on it and it tastes great, can't imagine a short shelf life. Great Divide delivers again."
"Excellent flavor. This is a nice malty beverage and I like how the dry hopping gives this a consistent hop character without being overwhelming. I'd call this one dangerous winter warmer. I get some slight booziness towards the end but overall this seems almost too easy to drink for something nearly 9%."
"I pick this up for about $10/6pk. With time and patience this is a great deal for an old ale."
"A great example of the style. Hops are nicely restrained, and the dominate flavors are awesome. Exactly what I want from a barley wine."
"Medium-heavy body but well carbonated, creamy feeling with a residual stickiness."
"Pours a deep reddish brown color, with a one finger off-white head. The beer is very cloudy and there is not a lot of carbonation. Smells sweet, with the prevailing smells being those from dark fruits and maybe a touch of caramel. The taste is a little too sweet at first, but the finish is better, as it ends up a little dry. There is little to no alcohol burn with this beer. Overall, it is a nice tasting beer. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. I did enjoy this beer, but not the best Old Ale that I have had. I would like to try this with a little more age on it."
"Cheers!"
"This beer is amazing."
"4.5 D: Some of the categories were borderline next-best-level, so that's why this is a 4.5. I don't believe I've ever had this fresh, but as it stands now, it's a pretty damn good beer. I'm not sure how good it would be in another couple years though. I wish I had another one so I could find out."
"Pours a cloudy brown with a small tan head. Aroma and Taste of sweet spices, brown sugar, sweet malt. raisins, light earthy hops. Palate is nice full body, good carbonation, nice smooth mouthfeel. Finish is sweet toasted caramel malt, some brown sugar and raisin, ending in a sweet hoppy biitterness with a nice long slightly dry finish. A very nice holiday brew."
"The curious bold presence of hops in this type of ale seems like a cool experiment, but ultimately distracts in just about every facet from what should be a celebration of complex malt lusciousness. Worth a try - actually, I hope that GD will put out a straight-up Old Ale - this recipe, but shrinking the hop bitter and vegetal characteristics. Please. You've got a winner being stifled."
"I just had a 2007 Hibernation Ale in April 2011. It was pretty terrific. The chocolate gets a little steroids from the aging. Actually a lot of steroids. The malt and alcohol blend nicely together twisting on the tongue tip. I highly suggest aging this brew. A terrific success of aging."
"A little different than what I'm used to, but not a bad beer at all. It's something I'd want to keep a bottle of in stock."
"Never had this style but it has great balance and is really unique in its delivery. Sweet to acidic transition with all the character of a well hopped scotch ale. Not quite La Folie on the smoothness but actually quite comparable for a fraction of the price. Not sure what GD was aiming for on this one but I will come back."
"Looks almost like a bock and smells just as wonderful. It has a sweet molasses smell mixed in with a chocolate milk smell and a bit of citrus mixing in with those 2 smells. The taste is just as delicious with that sweet molasses malt being the very first taste that hits your tongue then at the end you get the milk chocolate taste mixing in with a long dry finish with an herbal bitter hop. chocolate milk taste and the hops seem to be contributing to that pretty dry finish the most. Its actually a straight froward beer even with the thick rich taste it has. You also get a citrus hop in the back as well. The dryness is the only thing that could turn anybody off from this beer. Even though its a really dry finishing beer with each sip the sweetness balances it back out. Very cool beer."
"A nice old ale and one of the richer offerings from GD. A good night timer."
"Overall, a highly complex and delicious old ale. Sure to warm any cold body during the winter. If I were a bear, I would love to drink one of these before hibernation."
"Overall: This beer blew away my expectations. It's very complex and just plain delicious! I really wish I had picked up another sixer because they're all gone by now."
"O- not to crazy about this beer. maybe its the style or the beer itself. its refreshing to try something new so i cant count it out, but ill let the other 3 in the mix pack hang out for a little while"
"O: Pretty good, my first old ale, and I like the heavy malt bill on this one. Its a sipper and I am enjoying it at slow pace, not something I would drink ovr and over again"
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and is smooth going down but does have some interesting creamy feel to each sip."
"The deep, malty flavor of a porter, the hop bite similar to a black IPA and the drinkability of an english brown ale. Low to medium carbonation, as expected. Flavors blend extremely well to produce an overall exceptional beer. Not something to drink all night long, but if you're looking for a lot of flavor with a definite kick, this is a beer definitely worth trying, over and over again!"
"O=Pretty good beer, I would like to see how this progresses with some more age to it thought. There is not one component that jumps out to me that makes me say wow, this is a great barley wine, there are many more I would pick up in place of this."
"mouthfeel: very slick in the beginning but over time builds up and leaves a filmy feeling."
"D- This is a great beer by Great Divide. Like it alot. Will def. get this beer again"
"6/10"
"overall: one of the best winter seasonal's out there I will buy this again no question about it."
"D - If this beer weren't nearly 9% abv, it'd be drank like chocolate milk. Unfortunately, a pint or two of these will keep you warm enough to keep a smile on your face."
"D: One of Great Divide's best beers. Simply wonderful."
"D: The raisin card is overplayed with this one. It becomes annoying about half way through and the rest becomes a struggle."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a creamy, tan head. Smells sweet at first take. I pick up brown sugar, caramel, dark fruits, some toasty malts. Not much in the way of hops. The earthy hop flavor emerges slightly with the first few sips but this one is malty sweetness. The caramel and brown sugar dominate with a sprinkle of the dark fruit. The after taste is a strange one- herbal essences shampoo? This is a clean, hand-washed glass, rinsed well, and dried so I'm not sure why I taste this. It's not even terrible just not right or expected. I lowered my score slightly to reflect this oddity. Medium body with the right amount of carbonation present. A decent old ale style beer but the off-flavor threw me for a loop a bit. I will age a few and revisit in the future. Sip on a cold night."
"D-very drinkable. Liked this a lot. Prolly throw a 4 or 6er in my cellar."
"1 year cellared bottle. Pours orangish yellow. a bit of head that dissipates quickly. Smells sweet and malty. Lots of almost buttery sweetness on the nose. Smells great! Tastes pretty solid. A good amount of booziness and sweetness on the tongue. Very complex malt profile. Some camel and maybe even brown sugar on the tongue. Thick almost syrupy. Could do with another year even. Very drinkable and pretty tasty"
"D- as this beer warms up, the boldness turns it into a sipper. Easy to finish the 12oz bottle, but probably wouldn't do 2 in a session. I will enjoy this again for sure though"
"Looking forward to try more of their offerings."
"Overall: Perfect to sip on a cold winter night, but would probably move to another choice after just one."
"Not much carbonation, but slightly chewy mouthfeel. Alcohol not very noticeable or overwhelming, can definitely drink more than one."
"D: Tasty while in the mouth, but the odd finish wears on you."
"I can't believe this is 8.7% ABV, the alcohol is hid very weel, this could be tricky. It was very complex I just couldn't single out all the individual flavors."
"Drinkability is moderate but high for the style as the ale is well-balanced. I really enjoyed this beer although two would certainly be my limit at a sitting."
"Seriously, BM if you have any questions on this bad boy as I am seriously impressed this."
"2014: Fresh bottle, less than 3 weeks old. Lots of roast and puffed wheat in the aroma. Roasty malt flavors, tobacco, walnut, and a lingering earthy hop bitterness. Hops are a little more noticeable in the fresh bottle. Thanks to Bob for this one!"
"Surprisingly hoppy for the style, i suppose it'll fade with age. I think it was dry hopped a bit too much as there are prominent mineral notes that taste odd."
"Drinkability is fairly good. Looks and tastes quite a bit like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, which is a very welcome characteristic. Seems like an American take on the style, with hops playing a bigger part in the flavoring as well as the varied malts. Not bad for a cold winter night."
"This beer must be infected. There is no sell-by date and the beer is a cloudy tan. It taste likes rotten lemons. A very sour citrus taste dominates. It's simply awful. Lots of floaty things in it. There is very little carbonation. And based on other high ratings, all I can assume is I got a infected 6-pack."
"12 oz bottle poured into dimpled mug. Pours a clear, deep amber-red body with a finger-width, dense and creamy, tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves some nice swirls on the surface and a good amount of lacing. Aroma is rich malts and a good amount of hops. Lots of toasted toffees and caramels, some light chocolates and roasts, a hint of smoke, and some over-ripe dark fruits and grapefruit. Flavor is along the same lines with a coating, rich toasted toffee and caramel malt feel. Nice amount of citrusy hops balance the big, robust malts very well. Some roasts and chocolate and even some light vanilla in here. A hint of dark fruits come in towards the end with a lingering flavor of sweet and toasty caramel, roast, and a light bitterness as well as a nice, subtle fruity character. Finishes smooth and rich. Full bodied with a drying end. Overall, a great beer. I love the big flavor and balance. One of my favorite winter brews."
"Awesome beer. This is a new winter staple for me. Definitely another great beer from a great brewery."
"Poured a beautiful dark amber with some reddish-copper. Almost no head though...this is inconsistent with some of the other review's I've read. Smelled like a typical Old English ale, lots of malt and some alcohol. Nothing remarkable. The same can be said for the taste. Alcohol comes off first which mutes the rest of the taste experience. Not bad, but not great. The taste did improve as the beer approaced room temperature. Good carbonation, and a somewhat crisp mouthfeel. All around average...glad I only bought two."
"Great sipper to watch a Kubrick film to. Prost!"
"This beer has everything in a nice balanced equation. An almost indescribable effect as flavors meld into one another weaving a taste tapestry. An easy drinking, wonderful concoction that left me very angry that someone had stolen one out of the last 6-pack available this year. I guess I can look at it the other way and say it was their loss for not taking them all."
"Conclusion: Great Divide rarely misses a mark, and this beer is no exception. Rich, well hopped (for an English style) and flavorful. In a blind tasting I might peg this as an English barleywine or maybe even an aged American barleywine. Whatever. This is a great beer, and one of my favorite offerings from one of my favorite breweries."
"I am enjoying this, but the strong malt dominance would keep me from having another at one sitting."
"D: Very enjoyable. Great flavor, but it's not very intense."
"D- A very nice example of an old ale that is extremely drinkable. Nothing crazy here but a good example of the style."
"Body is sweet and roasted, full of malt, but with just a tinge of sugar. Tiny bite of hops, just underneath the rest of the more dominate flavors. Medium body, nothing overpowering, slick, etc, just a nice beer feel. Overall, nice and drinkable, and definitely think this is best paired with some good grilled food."
"Presents two fingers of reddish tan foam, decent density with smaller, tighter bubbles, mild dimpling with good retention at the half finger point, thick streaks of lacing. Dark red-brown color, closer to redwood than mahogany, more translucent than opaque, clearer and brighter orange at the glass bottom. The nose emphasizes cocoa and mocha powder, dusty texture, dried oats, scones, Brazil nuts, concentrated cherry to plum fruit scents, as it warms the orange citrus spreads out, overall more of a gentle toast than deep roast, the hops linger in the background. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is in overdrive from the start, this churning helps to mask a lot of the underlying dryness. Again with the powdery cocoa, mocha, coffee, even the caramel seems this way. Well-baked pastry dough to scone, muffin flavors, well beyond yeasty. Mixed nuts, orange peel, here a little pine sap gets into the mix. The plum, cherry, blackberry fruit gets pushed off to near the finish. At the end gets more earthy with fallen wood notes, nothing close to herbaceous. Extra bonus points for the dryness, not taking the easy overly sweet route."
"D- 8.7 %? wheres the burn on this one? Ill tell ya. Not here"
"Drinkability is pretty good. It is a robust ale that's tasty and hearty and a bit unusual. I assume it's based on a traditional English ale that looks for a neutral flavor mix I'd say it's well executed because I kind of like it."
"Overall, this is top 5 Winter beer on the planet in my opinion. It satisfies everything you want in a winter warmer, the high ABV limits your enjoyment but if you can pace yourself you will be rewarded with this seasonal brew from Great Divide."
"The mouthfeel is fairly thick and lightly carbonated, and the drinkability is high enough for the ABV, but hampered by how sweet a brew this is. It's all together a pretty good brew, it's just a bit too sweet for my tastes."
"This is the kind of beer I love - a sipper to savor."
"M - Sticky and chewy body carbonated just slightly. This is a warming and comforting beer great after just shoveling snow or a post-snow hike. I find it to be a complex and joyful beer easily accompanied by a few more due to its excellent taste and intriguing aroma."
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured a deep red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of bitter malt, hop, spices, alcohol, and caramel. The flavor was of bitter malt, bitter hop, clove, spices, caramel, and slight banana. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. Definitely a welcomed change for most winter seasonals out there. Nice hop profile going on here in the both the aroma and flavor. Can't wait to try the -bal version (hint hint traders!)..."
"A beer bottle brown (really, I compared) with garnet shades. healthy head of two fingers, very good retention and a nice amount of lace. Smell is toffee and pine with a touch of toasted malt. Some yeasty esters and a touch of earth. Taste is sweet with a big toffee front that gives way to a pine and citrus hops. Finish is long and dry with a lingering grapefruit and and a bit of mocha/coffee. A bit of warming from the alcohol but it is well integrated and does not really draw attention to itself. Some tea, leafy hops and a hint of mint. Feel is slightly syrupy with a mild carbonation. A nice winter sipper that goes down nicely."
"D: Really easy to drink, but I can only see myself drinking 1-2 at a time. Would love to sit on this one for a year and let it age a bit."
"Opened 12oz. bottle and poured into a pint glass. Poured a dark amber and caramel color with a thick appearance. This is one of the first old style ales that Ive had but i like a lot of GD ales. The smell is of coffee, hops, and malt. Taste is also of malt and chocolate, with a hops character. The drinkability is great for a beer with abv. 8.7%. its almost unnoticeable, and make it easy to get carried away with a beer like this. Great beer!"
"one of my favorite styles by one of my favorite breweries."
"Pours a clear dark brown amber. Thin off white foamy head. Nose is phenol, malty, dark licorice. Taste's similir to the nose, bitter licorice warming to a strong alcohol presence on the palatte. Medium bodied, dry mouthfeel. A sipper for me, only picked up one bottle to try. Not nearly as much malty/hop presence as I read about. About as good as an Old Ale should be I gather. Allright to try, perhaps not a repeat purchase here."
"D: A great winter brew for us here in Ohio. Warms the belly along with the spirits on a cold dark NE night. Probably could finish the whole growler myself but will share. Wonder if it this good in bottles?"
"Drank straight from the bottle due to lack of glassware! a very English style malty beer. Not my preferred choice of beer. However it did have a well balanced hop flavor to compliment the strong malts. Very nice dark brown color. Really don't think I could drink but one of these beers, but thats only because of personal preference."
"D: this is one of the more complex brews I have had. This is a sipper - partly to enjoy all it has to offer but also with the 8+ ABV. Very enjoyable but filling."
"Drinkability - The more offerings I have from Great Divide, the more I'm liking this brewery. This is another winner for me in my book. I could have a couple of these in the evening and be completely content. Another awesome brew by Great Divide!"
"D-I don't even think words can describe how easy drinking this beer is. I've almost gone through a six pack in 2 days... it's just almost regal in its richness but balanced by the pronounced, yet not scene-stealing hop notes. I kind of want to run out and buy a case of this. It really is that good!"
"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of Nov 10, 2010. Pours a rich dark brown with a medium head. Minimal lacing. Smells of coffee, chocolate, malts, and spices. Taste is hard to pinpoint. I'm picking up on a lot of spices up front with malt and chocolate after that. Somewhat boozey. Aftertaste of caramel. Overall taste is earthy. The strong flavors and higher ABV make this one not all that drinkable. It's a decent beer but I'm more interested in seeing how this ages, because drinking it fresh is a bit over-powering."
"GLORIOUS WINTER TREAT, GET SOME!"
"Overall - A fitting name this beer has, as it makes for a great beer to sip on as a winter warmer, or as a nightcap. Another winner from a great brewery!"
"Mouthfeel is full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"D - The higher ABV and heavier body make this more suitable to sipping versus drinking. Nonetheless, I could see myself having a couple of these on a cold winter night. Overall a pleasant experience that hits the nail on the head for a winter brew!"
"D: This was a very nice porter, but it didn't seem much like an old ale to me. The alcohol was hidden fairly well, so it was pretty easy to drink. It was enjoyable fresh, but I'm very curious to see what happens to it as it ages. So far it doesn't seem like anything special."
"Drinkability: Drink ability is great The flavor is not faint nor is it overwhelming. I could have one or three in a single sitting."
"Drinkabilty - Its easier to drink then most barleywines since its not as strong and bold, but it is still 8.7% so its a one and done for me. If barleywines are too much for you, maybe give this a shot. Has the familar hop flavor from great divine, would recommend this for sure."
"This Is not really a memorable beer in my mind, but it is a well-crafted and pretty tasty one. I would like to try this beer again with a little more age on it."
"Every year I pick up this beer, I end up wishing I had gotten more."
"D - The drinability is good. I could drink another. The alcohol is tame, it smells great and it's a nice robust old ale."
"D - Amazing. Not really a session beer, at least not for me. But two definitely hit the spot. And this beer is absolutely wonderful with food. Try some blue cheese, trust me, its perfect."
"D: A quality offering. Although, with all the seasonal beers out there, it would be tough to purchase again. Not a great session beer but the spice makes it quite pleasant when its 10 degrees outside."
"This beer is actually quite nice. The malt character is rich, and makes for a great sipping beer."
"Overall, a very nice brew, I might have preferred the flavors to be a touch bolder, that is certainly worth trying if you haven't. If you have, I suspect you probably have a couple in the fridge already."
"D: Very fine old ale. An extremely well-balanced brew that compares well with others of the type. Very enjoyable."
"Strong malt and some hint of some spice, but the sharp taste was too bitter/sour for me. Had trouble getting this one down. Almost tasted like something ""was wrong"" with the beer. Regardless, I won't be seeking this one out again."
"Poured into a snifter glass. Color is a deep rich mahogany. Aroma is very sweet and chocolatey, almost like a rich chocolate syrup. Has a somewhat earthy, woody character in the nose, kind of like coffee and cream. First taste is full throttle, with the richness of the beer slamming you back in your seat. Rich chocolate starts, before giving way to an amazing roasted caramel character in the middle. Mild spicy alcohol warmth finishes the beer. A very unique beer, almost like a scotch ale minus the peat, or something like a cross between a robust porter and barleywine. Very complex, but never muddled and quite enjoyable."
"I'd recommend buying a single if you can. That said the price is pretty reasonable."
"Not a fan of warmers in general- but this one is really well-played, just like Paladino's horse."
"Nice and drinkable. The hop character isn't exactly old ale like, but it's still good. I'm going to store a bunch of bottles for next year. I think this beer is much better with some age on it."
"The mouthfeel is medium, not watery, and satisfying. Pretty drinkable for a high ABV ale."
"D: I don't think I would buy this beer again, because I think GD makes much better beers than this. My girlfriend did like this one however."
"I wouldn't think that Hibernation Ale is a long-term celleraing candidate. While I enjoyed this year-old bottle, I can see that it is declining. Drink them relatively fresh, but do drink them. Hibernation Ale is a very good beer."
"D - a well built winter brew with many layers to explore. very fitting to the season in which it's meant to be enjoyed. would definitely have another one."
"Notes: Very nice ale from Great Divide, glad to have got my hand on a six pack of them this year. Short of the aroma, this is quite a nice brew for the style, I´ll sure revisit it again."
"these high abv's are always short on head - so I won't dock pts for that... This gets points for it's tasty malt and warming quality that isn't overwhelmed by alcohol in the taste - AT LEAST not for this abv. This kicks this pants off some other HGB's. Says Old Style Ale and this definately is true to the style and a fine example - though moderation is the key on this one."
"Drinkability: I would not want this when the temperature outside was greater than about 50. This will hit the spot when I want a thick malty beer. I can't think of a Utah Brewer that makes an Old Ale."
"Pours dark tea brown, with a tan head that soon recedes, but sticks to the glass. Smell is mega milk chocolate, with some caramel overtones, like a milky way candy bar. Just a hint of spices. Taste starts off warm and soothing, with a nice dash of hops that leads to a satisfyingly bitter and nutty finish. The candy and toffee flavors are omnipresent as well. Very complex, and a very nice beer. A nice warmer for the holidays."
"D - Definitely hit the spot on cool night. A great winter beer and one I will look for again."
"D: Great tasting, warming ale. Perfect on a cold night."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but the intense hops and the noticeable alcohol keep this from being a malty treat that I could drink all night. Maybe 6 months in the cellar would do the trick, but it's cold now!"
"This one surprised me! Pours dark red-amber and is nice and thick. Smells sweet, malty, toffee, almost barley winey and goes down without any notion this beer packs over 8% alc. It is nicely balenced with enough hops to not make it too sweet. Nice find!"
"Had this last year and pretty sure this is hoppier. The malt is still the star of this fine old ale, that has a great blend of hops, malts, and spiciness. The appearance is dark brown with a nice one inch head and soem good lacing. The smell is a great mix of hops, sweet malts, and spice. A terrific winter beer for sure!"
"Bustin' out Mike's boot fer the next few brews tonight. This one pours a straight clear garnet topped by a half-finger of dirty ecru foam. The smell arrives in waves, beginning with some white lettuce, followed by darker spinach, then moving into some rich toffee. As each wave hits, it builds on the one that came before it, creating an interestingly layered scent. The taste holds notes of minty orange peel, light cocoa, and toffee. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a nice old ale, but not really one I would reach for all that often."
"Poured into a Young's dimpled mug. This is a lively malty take on English Old Winter Ale, given a new world dimension by being dry hopped. And what a good winter ale this is. Bottled on September 8, 2010, the dry hopping gives this an orange chocolate note, rich and satisfying from start to finish. Plenty of depth to consider. The hops seem a bit more aggressive than in previous editions, but the luxurious malt presentation remains in focus."
"D- Good beer for a cool night. Those spices are great!"
"This beer pours a nice dark ruby red with very little white foam on the top. The smell is pretty darn nice. There are aromas of biscuit, hops and I believe that I detected raspberries. The taste is rather woodsy on the palate. There are flavors of raisin predominately as well as some caramel and slight twinges of chocolate. This feels pretty good on the palate and drinks really nicely too. This is a damn fine Old Ale and it comes recommended from me."
"Highly recommended and great for winter."
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark amber with a small, short lived, tanned head. Aroma is of bready malt, ripe fruit with hints of coffee. Full, smooth body. Rich caramel and bready malt, ripe fruit are balanced by earthy hops on the palate, some hints of coffee as well. Long, dry, earthy finish. Nice, after dinner brew."
"im rather fond of great divide beer so this is exciting to try. right off the bat i get chocolate and a little bit of booziness in the nose. it smells so pleasant i could really just sit and sniff. im a chocolate nut so this is right up my alley. mouthfeel is nice and creamy, and the carbonation is just right... enough to coat my tongue with chocolatey goodness. drinkability is good, however with the abv id have to stop after one or two of these. the first one would go down nice, but as with many winter beers for me, id have to move onto something else after just to give my tongue a break. cheers to oakedcanuck for this extra."
"D-This is a nice winter seasonal but not an especially good Old Ale. Value is very good for such a big beer at 8.7% ABV."
"O: Nice beer for this cold winter."
"This was my second chance to try Great Divide. Thanks to OakedCanuck for supplying this one as an extra. Awesome surprise and beer."
"The lead off is not sweetness, although its subtly there, its almost grainy bitterness, it tastes good but I was hoping for some Treacle or some toffee or something but its just not there. Overall it comes off as a little simple. Old Ales are your opportunity to make a big, complex beer with dozens of flavors that will wax and wane as you age it for a decade, this was average, middle of the road, run of the mill big beer."
"D: This is a great beer, nice sipping beer as I watch the snow fall down."
"D- Very well balanced and easy to drink."
"D- Decent brew. It's a little high on ABV for being a session brew. Despite that, I'm a little disappointed my local beer shop didn't have any cases. It's definitely worth having at least two glasses to get the full range out of the beer."
"D: It was good but I wont drink again"
"Old Ale seems a fairly odd categorization of this beer to me. It seems much more like an American barleywine. Hopefully some aging will turn this into the rich, malty brew that I was hoping for, but I am not impressed by this fresh version of Hibernation."
"drinks ok. not very harsh, pretty smooth drinking, but nothing memorable."
"Drinkability -- Truthfully, I'm not sure why this beer has such a high rating. Not that it's bad, but it's pretty middle-of-the-pack for an Old Ale. Nice flavors, nothing remotely offensive, but lacking the decadent and somewhat sweet character I expect from the style."
"Notes: very strong old ale with not as much fruit complexity as i was expecting. a little too much hop presence (flavor/bitterness) and could use a little bit of that light sour, aged character"
"A solid slow sipping beer after dinner."
"D - Great for a chillier evening, yet drinkable most times. GD made a fantastic beer that is very notable in my book."
"Pours a dark, chrystal clear, garnet color with a bronze head. Head is of average size and leaves some thick lacing when it goes. Nose is a bit lacking, faint notes of earthy malt and hops with some fruit notes. Where the nose lacked the taste more than makes up for. Kind of a murky, earthy, dank balance of malt and hops, and I mean that in the best possible way. Some roasted malts with lots of citrus and fruity hop flavors with a hing of booze in the finish. Medium bodied with a bit of a sticky finish. I've been on a bit of a hot streak lately, seems like everything I have picked up recently seems to live up to the hype. I should offer a warning though, the 8.7% is hidden well and can definitely sneak up on you."
"D: A nice winter beer. Perfect to sip on."
"D - The malty stickiness prevents it from being an all night event, but each sip provides a longevity that will see a whole glass outlast at least a couple of logs on the fire."
"D: I found this really interesting. I can't think of a beer that I've had that is all that equivalent. It's kind of a blend of different styles, part American pale ale, part English old ale, part Belgian strong ale. I would imagine it would be hard to drink more than one of these in a sitting, but that's just because the different flavors and the overall strength of it are a bit overwhelming and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Perfect for a cold winter night--not that I get a lot of those in Austin, but still."
"Served into a snifter. Pours a reddish-brown color with an off-white head. A bit of lacing. The nose is fairly complex with some nice notes of caramel, dark fruits, brown sugar, and some light pine and citrus hops. The taste is a bit of a letdown after the nose, as there are some notes of brown sugar and caramel, but nothing like the nose. The feel is a bit heavy and nice with some really light booze. Drinks well enough, but there's nothing drawing me back for more."
"Full bodied, fairly rich and creamy, medium carbonation. Smooth, slow drinking, but the alcohol isn't overdone. Nice warming feel during the winter season, making this a pretty easy choice."
"fresh rating: 4.5/4/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"This beer poured a deep, scarlet red to mahogany. The off white head dissipates quickly with little lacing. The smell is dark fruit, plum and currants, with some malt sweetness. I am not overly familiar with this style, but wow, this tastes really good. Semi-sweet malt with some peppery spice, aforementioned dark fruit, and just a slight hint of bitters. The mouthfeel is medium to slightly heavy with noticeable tackiness. The high ABV is well hidden. I will be headed back to the fridge to grab another one tonight. Very good."
"Pours a clear dull ruby with cream colored head that quickly settles to a thin ring, leaving only a couple blobs of lace. Smell: lots of dark fruit - roasted plum, a little fig, caramel, earthy hopping, a wee booze. Taste: dark brown sugar, dark fruit, bready, enough piney/earthy hops to keep it from being too sweet. Big cocoa in the sticky finish. Pretty good. 10/6/10 bottling."
"Poured a clear mahogany amber with a thick creamy two fingered tan head with lots of sticky lacing. Aromas of carmel, malts, and vanilla with hints of piney hops. Bitter sweet chocolate, burnt carmel, and booze on the palate. Medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. With a little more ageing, this brew would pull solid 5.0s in taste and mouthfeel. A rock star performance by GDBC."
"D: Solid. It's a sipper, but it's relatively high complexity keeps it interesting. Lovely beer."
"A very nice offering from Bell's. I'll certainly pick this one up again."
"A well-balanced brew that more than offsets the initial sweetness (the higher alcohol is almost undetectable). Very drinkable and satisfying."
"D: Flavorful and complex. Might not be sessionable due to ABV, but the last five will last."
"D - This seems incredibly easy to drink given the ABV. This is a beer I'd drink a few of in a night. Definitely more six packs of this to come for me."
"Drinkability: A great Old Ale, which I will definitely introduce into my regular winter rotation. The ABV may not be ideal for a session ale, but the complex characteristics in all categories makes this a great selection if you are trying to pair it with a meal or if you are just looking to sit back and enjoy a great beer."
"D - Very nice winter beer. Big, bold and delicious."
"D- a delicious ale for around the fire or just to warm your insides on a cold winter day. A nice flavorful old ale."
"Notes: A malty beast and dam hearty. It's the beer that is a meal in a bottle. Cheers."
"D - Wow I could really sit down and have a couple of these at the end of the day, or on a cold night. The drinkability is good for the high ABV, I could enjoy about 20oz of it but that's about it. It's a very delicious brew that I'd be happy to pick up again sometime. Cheers!"
"This is the type of beer i'd like to sip on all evening on a cold winter's night. It's hardy, full-bodied, flavorful and packs a punch. Great beer."
"D - Exceptional, regardless of vintage."
"As stated before, this is a sipper of a beer, but I think it drinks wonderfully. I am not detecting any of the ABV at all, even with it almost at room temperature. I would be curious to try a fresh example with more of a hop presence."
"drinkability - this is at 8.7%, picked up a sixer of this, paid 12.49 for it (saw it later on for 10.99 - ticked me off, but anyways...), for the abv. this is a pretty smooth beverage that I'm glad I took a chance on, this is gonna be nice for those chilly nights to sip on."
"Overall: Very solid beer overall. Great Divide keeps making solid beers. Give this one a shot."
"Great Divide Brewing Company--Hibernation Ale--English-Style Old Ale--Malty--Robust--2009 12 oz. Bottle. 8.70% ABV. 45 IBU's? (3.5 / 5.0) Foamy lacy light tan dense head. Clear dark deep red color. Roasted dark fruit mild hop malty fruit ester front. Thick sweet spicy roasted toffee caramel crusty doughy aged fruity body. Mildly hot EtOH mildly hop bitter end. Sampled 10/29/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $10.99 @ Saleh's Deli--Crown Hill on 1/6/2010."
"smooth, medium-plus bodied mouthfeel. for me i'd gauge its drinkability at slightly about average; very solid brew, but probably not something i'd spend a lot of time with at a sitting."
"The medium body is perfect. Texture of a Chimay Blue, smooth without being oily."
"Drink- On a cold day in the mountains(you lucky people in denver to have fresh batches) I could probably would take the 6 pack down and then head for a nice nap by the fire. Glad I even got 1 to have."
"D: drank really good for an old ale but I have to say it caught me off guard on the overall qualities of this beer. IMO in was leaning towards more an amber it style; oh well."
"D: Incredibly smooth and drinkable, and so delicious it keeps me coming back for more and more!"
"Just a touch sweet for my tastes, but otherwise very good. I have enjoyed all of the GD beers I have tried and Hibernation is no exception."
"Drinkability - A sipper, though I notice myself taking rather large sips. I don't taste the alcohol, though there is definite alcohol warmth. I'm actually digging how it is a bit more bitter than expected - makes this not overly sweet. I would try this if I see it available as a single."
"I've had this before on tap, but am enjoying it more from the bottle. Either way, though, this is a nice beer to sip."
"M- Perhaps a touch thin and prickly, but it feels clean and isn't sticky."
"Overall, not a bad one, especially for a Winter warmer...this one will be great in the colder months of the year. This one is relatively drinkable, and would be good over a nice steak or roast dinner."
"D- I could definitely drink this again."
"The hop profile along with a potent malt base and persistent fruitiness throughout reminds me of a strong ale (e.g. a more restrained version of Arrogant Bastard, with some different emphases) more than a true Old Ale - interesting and worth trying."
"My friend let me try this, he brought back a sixer from our hometown. Good beer all around. Cool that it comes in six packs, will definitely get some when I go to visit my mom."
"I have 2 more of these from a Great Divide sampler, and I think I'll serve the next in a smaller snifter-type glass."
"Other comments: For some reason, I was expecting this to be lackluster, but it is quite delicious. Something I would seek out again."
"D: The aroma of this beer got my hopes up, but the flavor was certainly a let down. Maybe a little age would help this one out."
"Drink is very good, but a long with most high alc brews only a few will do. Along with that, this is something that really works the palette and will throw your tastebuds off a bit."
"This is a very well done beer, and considering the great price, I am planning on stocking up on more ASAP. Definitely the most drinkable old ale I have had thus far."
"D: Everyday old ale."
"Nice chewy mouthfeel. So comforting and smooth."
"On tap at picco in Boston. Poured into a goblet. Not much head but wonder if that's just way it was poured based on other reviews. Nice chestnut brown color with ruby tinges especially on edges. Nice sticky lacing. Smells of oak, licorice, maple syrup. Some pine coming thru as it warms. Intensity of aromas predicts the taste. Definitely intense but quite welcome. Complex taste with dry red wine, chocolate, resin. Feel is tick and chewy leaving sticky feel. Could go for maybe 2 but not much more tonite. Overall an excellent beer."
"D: This bottle is extremely young, the flavours are promising, but not coming together very well. It's an awkward beer. I find it too overhopped for the style, but it's something I would love to try again with 1-2 years on it, it's not really a fun beer to drink fresh. It's like drinking a really fresh Bordeaux or Chateauneuf-du-Pape, it's not really drinkable fresh beacause of the tannins, but one can see the potential (that's why I kept the taste at a 3, were it is a clear 2-2.5 currently). This is really what's going on here. The malt flavour is really good, and when the hops (which I wasn't a fan of in this beer) drop out with some age I feel this beer could be phenomenal at that time, so keep that in mind. But right now it's nothing special, C+, as I rated it."
"Kinda lame in general."
"This bottle of Great Divide Hibernation Ale is one that I have been aging since last spring, when I found it on discount for $1/12 oz bottle (I bought all that they had--5). I remember it having a solid bitterness and a good aged, raisin flavor. This bottle, from the beginning of the pour had a very pronounced cognac aroma. This carried over in the palate with a full age liquor flavor that was a complex combination of toasted malt, port, oak, and alcohol. Tasty and it was not difficult at all to finish a 12 oz bottle."
"A really nice brew anytime of the year."
"O: unique but unpleasant aggressive toast/burn"
"pours a dark brown opaque color with good frothy tan head that recedes at a moderate rate. good lacing and soft carbonation. malty caramel nutty hints in the smell. taste is much the same with bread and molasses hints. very very light hop hints. medium body and a slightly creamy sticky texture. average flavor duration with a light sweet bitter finish. very smooth."
"Enough reviewing, time to enjoy the rest of the beer."
"For some reason I'm really getting a rye toast flavor out of this one. Drinkable-ish, but I'm reaching for other old ales, something in here just doesn't quite jive with me."
"D: Would like to have this in the winter maybe after shoveling out after a snowstorm of maybe just sledding for a couple of hours, but did go pretty good with my grilled chicken."
"Drinkability:A little too hoppy to really enjoy, and the hops used are not the most flavorful."
"This is nice, one and done slow sipper. I'm drinking this a little out of season, but I found the six pack on clearance for $5."
"2006 vintage sampled in May 2010. The beer pours a nice brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the caramel, chocolate and toffee malts. The flavor is chocolate milk and toffee. The alcohol is faded and this is extremely easy drinking. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - Not bad, just not flavors I am big on. I'd love to try a bottle of this fresh to see how it compares to a 2-3 year old aged bottle."
"This is definitely a brew to be enjoyed in the dead of winter on a dark night. It is a nice warmer and fun to drink."
"Pours a ruby-reddish brown, clear and topped with a nice inch thick coating of light brown foam. Beautiful aromas of toffee and caramel and nuts. Nice malty flavors on this one, caramel, toffee, cut nicely with a very pleasant spicy hop flavor. A very good winter seasonal, and another excellent offering from Great Divide."
"Mouthfeel was good -- very thick & luxurious, very nice. Easy to sip this beer, though it's not a pounding style of beer. Great stuff. I'm not sure why I was so surprised -- everything GD does is very good, but I actually enjoyed this more than ?Yeti, Hercules, Hades, or any of the other GD beers I drink regularly. Great beer."
"your buck."
"Bottles pour a dark clear amber brown with a decent amount of foam forming in the sam adams perfect pint glass. The smell is of sweet dark fruits, but the taste doesn't quite follow. This is a decent beer, but I was expecting more. Its malty and has that dark fruit taste..but this flavour lacks a little bit. No hint of the 8.7% alc at all, so its very drinkable. Just I dunno, theres no wow factor here."
"Reviewed from my notes, based on a bottle provided by sigma23 and also split with deltatauhobbit. Bottled in October of 2008. The beer has a great caramel brown color. There's a thick tan head and a tiny bit of carbonation rising with the beer. There is a sweet malt and raisin aroma. I can smell some of the alcohol as well. The Hibernation has a good malt taste. There is a dry, roasted grain finish and some brown sugar sweetness at the end. A little coffee bitterness lingers after swallowing. It's not too heavy of a body, but certainly above medium. There is still some carbonation left in this bottle. It leaves a modest coating. It's not the most drinkable Old Ale I've encountered (that may be the Old Engine Oil), but it is still fairly drinkable. I'd limit myself to one bottle though."
"Poured a dark amber brown into a bottle with a killer frothy cream colored head. Smell is full and malty, some caramel sweetness, smoky and woody notes too. Taste is bready and malty up front, sweet then smoky and bitter dry hops in the finish. Very warming alcohol presence. Everything anyone could need for a cold winter night, incredible beer. Will make sure to keep these in the fridge for cold nights."
"Dark brown pour, nice creamy head. Lots of malt, toffeeand caramel, with some hops and chocolate. In addition, on the tounge I find some fruits such as figs, dates, raisins and prunes, perhaps a touch of sherry (perhaps dark rum?) and molasses. Not a by the book barleywine. Mouthfeel is excellent. Bit of oxidation, but it adds to the beer. Good beer, not one to seek out, but not one to ever turn down."
"Overall a great beer, good cold weather ale. Would probably pair well with a good cigar anytime of year, will try next time. This is the 2nd style I have tried from this brewery (Titan IPA) and both have been outstanding, looking forward to the next."
"D: I thought this was ok; I was expecting more ""old"" flavors like leather and tobacco, but it came off more as a slightly hoppy English barleywine, and still lacking the complexity of better examples from that style."
"Value: A little pricey for what it is."
"355ml bottle purchased by my girlfriend at Beer World in Largo, Florida. 2008 vintage. Ebony in colour with ruby hues, one finger of tan head, and threads of lacing on the snifter. Smell and taste are floral hops, caramel and chocolate malts, toffee, cocoa powder, plums, roasted nuts, and dates. English-style hops are peaty, earthy, and herbaceous. Sort of like an Imperial Brown Ale, with a warming but tasteless ABV. My only criticism is that, for an Old Ale, the body is too thin. Still, this is an ideal sipper for the winter time. Great Divide never fails me!"
"D: A good sipper, but not one I would drink a lot of."
"Verdict: Complex, tasty, and warming, Hibernation is a solid Old Ale, and it works well as a winter seasonal. I'm looking forward to seeing how this stands up after a year or two."
"D - This was one interesting brew...I loved the sweet flavors from the caramel and toffee...the hops at the end added a nice surprise...overall a decent beer but it wouldn't be my go to winter beer"
"Drinkability- One a night for me maaaybe two if it's very cold. Thats not a slight to this beer, I don't think it's designed to be drunk 6 at a time. I could take this in the place of coffee easily. It's a slow sipper, nice winter beer. Sort of heavy."
"D- I can't think of a beer that smelled and tasted more differently. However, it's a great beer and I'll easily enjoy the remainder of my six pack."
"Mouth/Drink: Creamy and smooth this one is dangerous at almost 9%abv."
"D- Careful with that high ABV. I tried pretending this was just another session beer this last New Year's Eve and ended up passed out on the armchair in no time. On a cold winter's evening, though, one could put a few of these down with no problem."
"A beautifully crafted beer. I've tried not to be without a 6pack of this in my fridge for months now."
"Overall, I liked this beer. I would like to try one that's aged about a year to see if it mellows out any."
"drinkability: another GD great"
"Pours clear reddish copper body witha cream colored head. Atomas of sweet caramel malts, citrus hops floating about, and perhaps some oxidation? Taste is buttered caramel bread with grapefruit notes. Full mouthfeel creamy even. No alcohol presence. A warming one and done beer for me. The fullness and abv might get to me after more than my 10 oz pour."
"Smells a light chocolate mixed with Amber and some holiday spices. Perhaps coriander? Taste of bitter spices, a slight astringent bite , caramel, old ale flavors, medium to thick mouthfeel with good carbonation. Drinkable at 8.7 and for the style, but I would prefer some other old ales that I frequent over this - the spice flavors are a nice different touch though."
"Strong taste, but very drinkable for such a high abv beer. A great beer after a long day on the slopes."
"Overall a tasty beer, for sure. My wife even liked it and she doesn't typically like beers of this style, mouthfeel, or ABV. It's quite good and one of the best flavor/aroma combination I've had in the old ale style."
"Great Divide is just GREAT with almost all their beers and I would definitely add this one to the favorites. I will be aging the second bottle."
"D- Very well balanced beer, will have again."
"This one is sure to make my usuall rotation."
"D - Delicious and smooth. Alcohol is warming and not harsh. Among winter seasonals, I definitely prefer these malty, complex ales the over winter-spiced varieties."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice mahogany color with a nice head that was off white. The smell was malty and hoppy. The beer was very malty tasting and had a slightly sweet finish. More sweet than I liked. I might would try it on tap if I could find it."
"A great winter beer from the folks at Great Divide, makes me wish I could get a case and go into hibernation for myself. As the warmer weather comes, beers like this will slowly disappear. But thankfully, there's always next year!"
"D - A solid old ale that has a few flaws. Some conflicts with my palate, but overall a good beer. There are a few beers I'd pick over this for an Old Ale but it's still nice. Some more age could mellow the hops a bit and let the malts do most of the work which would be nice."
"D: Alcohol is barely detectable, taste is quite robust, but it's still quite drinkable. The chocolate is wonderful, the fruit complements it very well. All in all, given the big flavors, it's impressive how easily it goes down."
"Nice flavor, nice feel and a decent brew."
"D - definitely not a session beer, unless your session calls for passing out after 3 or 4 beers. Best consumed with food as a winter evening relaxer ( hence the genius of the name)."
"Overall: Best Colorado beer I've had"
"Taste: More chocolatey cocoa powder followed by a good smack of oily spicy hops. I was skeptical at first but it does seem like it makes a pretty good winter seasonal."
"(D)- A solid example of the style. Generally a higher abv is associated with old ales, but this one is definitely more drinkable than usual for the style. Good, but I think at this stage of its age in the bottle that it needs more time or that it should be drunk fresher. Only time will tell on my last bottle."
"D: One to sip, but certainly drinkable. With some more dense carbonation, this one could be pretty great. The strangest thing, though, about this brew (at least for me) is that while the carbonation in the mid-stage is less than desirable, when it nearly entirely disappears (and when the minty smell presents itself as it warms) it's quite cool and refreshing, which bumps up the score."
"Drinkability: Its a little bit of an oddball too me, being so hoppy. This one is young at just 2 months old, so I would guess some age would make it even more to my liking. A damn good beer though. I can feel it."
"Strong beer, but this went down easy. A really nice winter beer, now I'm debating seeking out the BA version. Glad to see you again old friend!"
"This really drinks well and could sneak up on me on these cold winter nights. Mouthfeel is as smooth as can be. Finish is piney, spicy and a bold warming tingle from the alcohol. A very nice old ale."
"Overall the price was right, the ABV was high, and the beer was smooth. Whats to complain about?"
"D: I'd definately pick this up again. Solid offering from Great Divide as usual."
"Aroma 8/10, Appearance 3/5, Taste 7/10, Palate 4/5, Overall 17/20"
"D- Still a very drinkable beer especially when you factor in the apv."
"D: Eh, it's not a great beer, but if you like the style you might be into it more. It's nothing special, and if Great Divide hadn't made it I'd probably be even harder on it."
"The taste is better, stale and has smoke. It tastes like an ale, but not a good one."
"Smells great but I feel a little let down by the taste. Its not bad, its just not what I was expecting I guess. Seems like a decent beer."
"D: A nice brew that will be interesting to revisit with a little time under its belt. Reloading every months aounds about right for the rest of the 6-pack."
"One of my favorite styles of beer. I tried to be fair but, the beer may have bested me. Smelling of, light molasses, sweet biscuit and roasted malts how could one resist a taste. Rather than inhaling the beer I sip. A sweetness envelops the senses followed by a very mild bitter finish. This is definitely not a refreshing beer; this is a sipping by the fireplace beer. This beer provides what one would hope for in its style, sweetness (molasses & caramel, dark red fruit), sticky in the mouth (not cloying), roasted malts, nearly smoky. As for the beer's beauty, the least of its worries, the hew would be better described by poets describing sunsets and clouds."
"D - A solid fixture in the world of winter seasonals... Interesting and enjoyable, but not overly memorable... I wouldn't turn down a chance to drink again in the future, but I'm not sure that I would necessarily seek out either..."
"Overall Impression: Very well balanced big beer. I think I could drink a couple of these before succumbing to gravity. I would very much like to get some more and let them age for a few months."
"I like this beer. I give it a high drinkability score because of the smoothness of the finish and the great taste. Even with the 8.7%abv. i could drink about 3 of these before i needed to switch it up."
"Overall this is another well-crafted ale from Great Divide that seemingly embodies many important elements of the style. Recommended."
"D- what i smelled and what i tasted seemed to be completely different beers. an interesting winter seasonal that i would love to try the barrel aged version of. ill be checking back on this one throughout 2010 to see how it progresses."
"D - Drinks well for 8.7%. Alcohol noticeable, but not in a bad way. Not my favorite kind of old ale (I prefer more like old engine oil), but good none the less."
"Pretty good. Can see enjoying these again."
"Medium in body and quite firm, almost biting. Not as smooth as I might want in an old ale, but tasty and quite unique. Thinner than expected, increasing drinkability but slightly lowering the overall experience. Alcohol is well-hidden at 8.7% abv."
"Drinkble for the season and the style. Not real sessionable because of the ABV. The beer was served too cold, and became more flavorful as it warmed."
"OVERALL Interesting and about like I remembered it. Worth a try now and again, but there are many better winter beers. Very attractive and nice smelling."
"Overall, the 06 is a ton better than the 09. I will be aging the rest of my other bottles for at least 3 years. It is a decent old ale with a few years on it."
"D-There's definitely a taste of the high abv. Probably couldn't handle more than 1 or 2 in a session."
"D: You could probably sip a couple of these, because at nearly 9% ABV, you'd be in trouble in a session. It paired really nicely with fruit glazed pot roast, ginger cookies and most other holiday pickins I threw at it. A nice change-up for a winter seasonal and a unique offering from Great Divide."
"Wonderful rounded, juicy, slick feel, leaning toward a heavy body but not detracting from its drinkability. I mean, 8.7% be damned, I can see working slowly through two or even three of these 12 oz. guys over a long winter's evening. Don't think I will, because I'm not so blown away that I would do that, but it is a solid, enjoyable, distinctive, utterly drinkable old ale."
"Drinkability: Not something I would drink in excess, but this will be a brew that I will be purchasing every winter."
"Pours a very dark crimson, a clear red when put up to a back light. Head is the only place where the appearance lacks a bit. It is about one finger and retains at half a finger decently. It appears a bit fizzy and leaves medium lacing down the glass. Smells of chocolate malt, dark fruits like cherries, some earthy hops and spices like nutmeg. The overall strength is a bit lacking to me but it is a good smell. Alcohol stings the nose just a little bit. Tastes of chocolate malt, earthy hops, some citrus, spices like nutmeg, dark fruits and some bready flavor. A nice flavor reminds me of the grains left over after a homebrew session. I like the flavor balance but the alcohol is a bit high in the taste and takes away from this being a great beer. Mouthfeel is great here, nice medium body and carbonation, the warming is pretty high but not ridiculous. A nice coat of earthy hops and cocoa is left on the tongue. Drinkability is not bad, it ages well, tastes good, price is decent at $12 a 6 pack, the only thing here is the alcohol taking away from this one after a while."

"This is the second Great Divide beer I've tried; first being Hercules Double IPA. To be honest, I love IPAs, but I like this beer a good deal more... especially since I paid $13 for this in a 6 pack and I paid $16 for a 4 pack of Hercules... Not bad for an 8.7% ABV brew. Anyways, I poured this into a pint glass and noticed a cola like color with a deep red tint when held up to the light. The pour left a nice tan head that left an even lace around the glass. Malts, chocolate, caramel, and hops are evident in the aroma. The hop aroma is heavier than the hop taste, which was a surprise. Caramel malts with a hint of chocolate and hops are the most prominent flavors... although there seems to be a great deal of hops in this beer, it doesn't have the dry, bitter after taste of an IPA. This is a pretty thick beer filled with a lot of flavor. Not a good session beer, but a great desert beer(s). I think this is an incredible beer and I will absolutely buy it again very soon. I recommend buying this if you get the chance... I mean it blows me away that someone rated this a D+... maybe it was the first time they ever drank a beer or maybe they are huge fans of keystone light."
"Future outlook: Given it's high marks, pretty big disappointment. Just too much of that ""wet cardboard"" character in the flavor profile for me to really dig this."
"Purchased from Blue Max Liquors in Burnsville, MN. Pours a very dark amber body with a rocky, light tan head. Aromas of caramel and chocolate make this beer very inviting. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Flavors of roasted caramel malt and nutty brown sugar lead to a burnt sugar finish that is slightly warming. Great drinkability."
"Bottle says 8.7 abv. I really enjoy this one. Pours a dark brown w/ amazing head and lacing. A malty beer but the hops shine though. Very nutty! Slight chocolate notes. Nice and creamy, I do love the feel of this beer. This is definitely a drinkable beer that I will look forward to in future winters. Recommended to anyone who enjoys a solid beer."
"Pours a mahogany color with nice khaki colored head. Good lacing. Smell is of carmel malts, dark dried fruits, alcohol and piney and earthy hops. Taste is sweet carmel malts, strong earthy, piney, bitter hops with a good alcohol background. Minor notes of dark fruit and seasonal spices. Medium bodied but thin for the style. Smooth, not syrupy or medicinal like others in the style. Strong earthy, piney bitter aftertaste. Good beer, some notable flaws to the style, but ignoring that, its a decent brew."
"D: This beer is a good winter beer, the burnt toast finish of this beer stands out with the layer of malty sweetness added on top. I am fond of this style of beer."
"Hibernation reminds me of a dark barleywine, which needs time to sit and sip. Definitely a winter warmer!"
"It is a good brew. I'm not a fan of Scotch style or Old style ales, but this is a fairly smooth and mild version that is tollerable This English Style Old Ale is not overly heavy on the bitter alcohol taste that I usually find in these styles."
"D - goes down nice but the 8% holds you back to a nice slow pace."
"This one is pretty damn tasty, and despite it's relatively high abv. it's pretty approachable. I am not quite sure that this should be classified as an Old Ale though."
"D: This is one of my favorite winter seasonals. Nice balance between maltiness and hops, very bold, a little lacking on drinkability due to its high abv."
"D - Despite its [somewhat] moderate abv, this is a sipper. Tasty & interesting, I'm glad I picked up a bottle."
"drinkability - not a beer i could drink more then 1 in a session"
"pour is copper with a mild head. nose of old ipa with alcohol rum. oak bark ipa. citrus. palate is hot. peppery. woody. stale citrus zest but dry malt. not sweet. bit of thyme. a bit too young but overall not bad... better cellar temperture with some room to breath."
"For the style this brew is definetly above average in the drinkability dept."
"Delicious overall, and a great winter brew. After a few of these, I'll be ready to curl up in bed and hit the snooze until spring."
"Cherry tinged oak in color. Possesses great clarity. My aggressive pour yields just a 1 finger head, but it looks appealing - creme brulee and foamed milk kind of affair. Certainly a beer that has me ready to dive in. Smells like cider, sweet grass, raw sugar. Just enough going on to let you know your dealing with a beast. I sip and the beer starts deeply sweet as it slips by easily on the lips. It stays sickly sweet, then opens up big time, arcing towards the back of the tongue. Notes of peat, bourbon, tobacco, cocoa and dryish grains are underlain by a caramel milky backbone. All of this is enveloped by a warm hoppiness. A great touch. The chewy mouthfeel is complimented well by the strong carbonation. Tobacco and peat compete, becoming more prominent as the beer warms - hints of smoke now appear. Alcohol starts to burn... things have fallen apart just a bit, but its expected with a burly beer like this. Its not a subtle affair. Very malten, earthy, smoky. A great beer for pairing (I drank as standalone)."
"Good winter beer. Great for after dinner by the fire. Easy to drink, and a nice variety of characteristics for both the nose and palate. Quite good."
"pretty easy drinking for the style. This is a good warming beer for the season."
"Pours a weak thin head that quickly disappears into a thin thin lace. This a really really roasted malt palate and in way a bit unpleasant. A strong bitter bite and a lot of alcohol burn too. Better choices out there, not bad but not really recommended."
"Drinks great at 8.1, very little bit, if any at all. Overall a high quality old ale."
"Pours very dark amber, but still fairly No head at all on this beer. Huge aroma of caramel, fruit, choclate, almost too much going on with the smell to describe. Huge malt taste up front with a little bit of boozey aftertaste. Definitely a winterwarmer/holiday type of beer. Feels very thick on the tongue which cuts down on the drinkability and makes it feel more like a wine or liquer than a beer. A solid addition to great divide's lineup."
"D - This beer is quite harsh - this could stand to age a year or two to mellow out. Still tasty, though."
" Cheers!"
"Pours a nice brown with reddish highlights. Very dark and gloomy looking, quite nice. Head retention was fair with very small bubbles. When I poured it I could already smell the roasty aroma, quite intense. I haven't smelled an old ale that smells quite like this. Smells like my morning coffee with some chocolate and toasty bread. I can also pick up the hops, which is nice. Usually find old ales to be quite malty. Wow, tastes phenomenal! Roasty character lasts throughout, while you experience the underlying flavor components. I get a nice caramel and brown sugar flavor, with some nice malty backbone. The hops maintain a nice bitter balance. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, yet this is a very different old ale than what I am used to. This beer is exceptional and drinks very well. I'll have to pick some more up to put some age on it."
"F: A slight bitterness comes out. Still pretty creamy, and the roasted malts, chocolate, toffee, and rich creamy flavors linger for a short while. It has a nice clean finish as well, with a touch of bitterness that doesn't really build, but touches the senses nicely. The alcohol presence is still pretty much nowhere to be found, they hide it very well. This is a dangerous beer!"
"Edit - Christmas Eve 2012. Pulled my last saved 09' out of the cellar. Have been enjoying these since discovering them 3 years ago. Oh so smooth and velvety after 3 years. Thank you Great Divide."
"D - This is not the most drinkable beer. The flavors although very good are fairly intense and would keep me from knocking back more than one in a sitting."
"Summary: Overall I think the hype behind this beer psyched me out a little bit.. If I would have tried this without any premonitions I probably would have been more impressed. Overall still a very good beer and would drink again, but I prefer a few other winter warmers over this one."
"D: Truly a great beer. This style is the only one that comes close to the best trappist-beers (quads). The Hibernation Ale has a great taste with a very interesting mix between english and american floral hops."
"Drinkability: Not too bad for something with the ABV that this one comes with. The hoppy grassiness is quite interesting; the alcohol, while present, is still blended quite nicely. I would have to wonder if some age would do this one any good."
"Despite the higher alcohol and sipping-nature of this, I could spend a whole evening drinking this by a warm fire."
"Drinkability: Very nice example of an Old Ale which begs to be sipped. However, I feel like I enjoyed it a little more last year when it was a little lower in alcohol and the malts seemed to be richer in comparison to the spicy hops. Not sure if the beer or my palate is different. Either way, still a great beer."
"I was not a big fan of Hibernation last year when I first tried it, but this has thoroughly changed my mind. I lost a bet last year (football related) and ""donated"" 2 6-packs to a friend who ended up cellaring them. He let me try a few bottles this year, and I was absolutely blown away. His patience has paid off immensely, and I will absolutely now start cellaring some beers. The aged version of last year's Hibernation may be one of the best beers I have ever tried. As far as this year's goes... its not the worst winter beer I have ever had, but its incredibly hot for the 8.7% it lists, and probably could also use a year in the basement."
"Had just two last night and spent all Sat morn with a frontal (sinus?) headache that would not go away (despite 2 Exedrin and 2 ibuprofen). Had just two tonight as well, I fear the same may happen tomorrow morn judging by the way I feel now. Will update."
"Smells of rich malty goodness with a slight hop edge. Carbonation is light but still lingers as it is over a year old. Minimal lacing in my goblet as it goes down. Alcohol seems hidden very well. Tastes up front of rich toffee and small coffee flavors with a carmel bite. Hops resonate in mouth as it goes down. Very drinkable for an 8.1%. One of my favorites of all time. This is a classic brew. I cant wait to find a fresh one and compare."
"- Overall this is a fantastic sweet, rich, and malty brew... and like it states... is very well balanced and complex."
"Drinkability is only OK because I wouldn't want to polish off a 6 pack of these bad boys. Might not get up in the morning."
"Drink ability is pretty good. For such a high abv beer its somewhat session able. Great beer for cold nights, definitely a malt bomb, sweet, smoky, and just enough bitterness. Another very good beer from Great Divide."
"Overall: One of the best examples of the style I have come across. British examples available in the US often have not fared so well by the time they get to the consumer. This beer is outstanding."
"Hibernation Ale pours a lovely burnt copper in my glass. Aroma is of malts and a little fruit twang. The malts are tasty on the tongue. After the malts go away you are left with a fruit bitterness and a little alcohol burn. It's a pretty beer with not much else going for it. I could not recommend this beer unless you happen to be a fan of the style.(I must not be)"
"D - Despite the +8% ABV, good balance makes this beer easy to drink."
"Delicious beer. Moderately complex, but smooth on the palate. Should age very well. I have bottles in the cellar from the past few years. Curious to see how these change over time."
"mouthfeel is medium bodied,moderate carbonation.pretty good as a fall/winter sipping beer.pretty flexible in terms of food pairings.could stand up to bleu cheese,but would also fit well with creme brulee."
"D- Super drinkable! The this nicely balanced brew is a too high in alcohol to call a session beer, but I could enjoy several of these in one sitting."
"Poured brown with red highlights and a one finger head that finished as a thin covering. The aroma was sweet maple syrup . The taste was also like a thinned down maple syrup . The feel was medium bodied with light carbonation. Drinkability was good. Not as thick bodied as HotD Adam, more like a Scottish ale such as Dirty Bastard. Not as good as either of those beers, but a good one."
"Taste-Big malt sweetness up front, caramel, definite hop profile lending a balance- A clean, warming finish. Easy to drink for the strength. A nice winter warmer."
"This is another solid beer from Great Divide and one that I've taken too long to try. Excellent."
"Overall impression: Enjoyable offering from Great Divide."
"D: The alcohol doesn't show through much at 8.1%. This one's well balanced and pretty drinkable."
"D-- A little big but always drinkable. Very well balanced and complex. One of my favorite winter beers and always look forward to seeing it come out. I guess that makes it very drinkable. How quickly can I finish this growler and then get another?"
"First let me start by saying I am vuury, vurry glad that Virginia got this beer again. It has been 3 long years since I had Hibernation last and it has been one of the G.D. beers I have missed most. What 'cha got cold Fall nights? With this beer in hand I can withstand even your worst wintry blasts. On to the beer. As gorgeous in the glass as it is on the nose. Deep autumnal amber hue with a tight, slightly off-white head. The nose is rich, with an inital wave of dry cocoa followed closely by earthy, piney hops. Belgian dark chocolate mixed with fir trees? Yeah, I am ready for this bad boy. The hops hit the tongue first but are imediately bodychecked off thier feet by the bold, smooth malt flavors. These are some bruisers for sure. Their swagger is confident and composed. And why shouldn't it be? They are packing heat like roast malt, perfectly baked brownies, molasses, and perhaps even a hint of Herseys syrup. But they never ov erstay thier welcome and become too rich or cloying. Drying, resinous hops pick up after the malt onslaught and keep things brisk, clean and ready for another rumble. Not to say this beer doesn't have a pleasing finish that lounges on your palate, but it is a 'sessionable' old ale by me account. Glorious. It shall soon earn itself a week or two on my kegerator, if that strikes anyone out there as a ringing vote of approval. Hope my roommates like it. Or hope they don't actually."
"D - Good for the style."
"A nice fall/winter drinker for sure. Would gladly revisit this one."
"What an interesting old ale! Here was me thinking that they're all going to be high alcohol sugar bombs, and then Great Divide comes along and surprises me. I shouldn't have been caught unawares, though, as Great Divide is one of my favourite breweries, and this is another hit for them. Highly recommended."
"D: The is a nice Old Ale. The beer's strength makes it a good candidate for a nightcap. A very well done offering."
"This is one to get every time."
"sweet malty aroma, with pungent dried fruitiness - really tasty with flavor in suit with it's aroma - a little heavy with minimal alcohol presence, at least until i finished this, whoa -"
"M&D: softly carbonated, the palate is rounded, mellow, with a depth that hides behind the juicy hop façade and rich-but-not imposing malt body. All in all, this marvellously balanced and surprisingly light-bodied ale is in every way a ""digestive"" type of drink in its own right. I don't find the overall aroma and flavour terribly ""English"" (again, due to the hop input, yet not least), but the impeccable balance does tell some truth in this light. Also, this is an outright balanced, delicious and satisfying darker-version barley wine, if you ask me, as there really is nothing ""OLD"" about it. High recommended, regardless of styles!"
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a clear crimson brown color with two fingers of creamy light tan foam. Aromas and flavors consist of sweet malts, caramel, sweet biscuits, fruity maybe some figs, toffee, earthy hops. Approaching full bodied and adequately carbonated for the style. Certainly worth your time if you are a fan of old ales."
"A deep brown reddish ale, with a nice looking tan cap of foam above. Caramel, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, and a hint of hops in the nose. Powdery dry on the medium-bodied palate. Cocoa, toffee, toasted malt. It moves through the center nicely and finishes with some earthy bitter hops. A sweetness is present throughout but avoids becoming cloying. Overall not bad. Given the summer weather, hibernation is not on my mind, but if it were a little cooler this brew would hit the spot."
"Pours a translucent chestnut body with an off-white head. Nutty caramel malt aroma is near intoxicating. Rich caramel malt and toffee with a mild bitterness in the finish. The body is smooth, syrupy thick, but still creamy. Great old ale, not the most complex, but it is affordable, quaffable and dangerous at 8.1abv. This is consistently one of my absolute favorite winter seasonals. Can't wait to try the Stranahan barrel aged version."
"So Great Divide calls this an English-Style Old Ale, but I've never tasted an Old Ale with this much hops in it; this is very much an American interpretation. I wouldn't call it ""rich," but it certainly has depth, lots of great flavours going on, and intermingling. Should do well in a cellar, and is excellent with fine cheeses such as 5-year cheddar or gouda."
"with a large malt base in the mouth. Roasted, toasted and caramel are at the forefront giving this beer a balance of dryness and sweetness, and there is some fruit flavoring (not much) from the hops. There is a little alcohol poking through on the backend making this a sipper, but overall this is an enjoyable beer to relax with."
"D: Smooth rich malts are very nice. Besides the high ABV, it is drinkable. Smooth and sweet."
"overall a very good strong ale."
"D-Smooth drinking all the way down. This is one of those beers you don't want it to end. I wish I had a case."
"Definitely expected more from this beer. I am a huge fan of everything that Great Divide does but this one is just not for me. I expected a little more mouthfeel than that and even though it is an english style old ale, I was found myself wanting more of a hop character."
"Date on bottle Sept. 4, 2008 (7 months old). Poured into an oversized snifter. Appearance is perfect. Color is a deep, dark red. Good clarity, thin layer of fuzzy foam, and plenty of lacing. Smell blew me away. The dry-hops which seemed weird after reading the bottle really seem to meld nicely with the malt-assault my nose is currently experiencing. Alcohol barely noticeable. Plenty of dark caramel, dark fruits, butterscotch...like a rich double bock. On the first sip, the first thing I notice is the almost slippery mouthfeel. Reminiscent of some imperial stouts in its 'chewiness'. Taste is extraordinarily malty, with a sweet finish and a lingering alcohol/hop burn. However, the boozy/bitter finish is welcome in a beer this malty. No oxidation noticeable, I think this beer would age beautifully. I would say the drinkability is relatively low due to the high viscosity, but I wouldn't think twice about drinking 2-3 of these. Will definitely buy this again."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 1/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, roasted malt, hops, a sugary sweetness, and a hint of smoke. Fits the style of an English Old Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level and a high bitterness level. Tastes of alcohol up front, then some good smoke flavors, roasted malt next, a sweet malt and hop background, and more alcohol in the finish. Overall, great flavors, but the alcohol is not hidden very well. I'd still recommend this brew but it does pack a punch."
"Extra: Very good beer. Very bitter but still has robust malt. Not a quencher. But a great pizza beer. I am going to enjoy my second bottle with pizza. Can't wait."
"D: Very drinkable beer, I would recommend this for sure."
"Purchased as a single--might have to pick up some more."
"A perfect beer..."
"Mouthfeel is weak and watery. For a ""big"" beer like this, it is disappointing. Decent carbonation, just too slick. Taste is a big wallop of nuttiness that I was not expecting. Some of the bitter walnut aftertaste in there. I'm also getting some raisin, booze, and slight spiciness. Not bad. I'm glad I got this, and I'd most likely get it again next winter, but I wouldn't drink more than 1 at a time."
"D- The only drawback would be the ABV. I could see where some might be turned off by some of the booze that comes through here (at least for me) but I find it to be a greatly balanced beer where the booze is necessary. I may want to drink more of these than I should because I think this is a superb, excellently balanced beer that I think is one of the more underrated selections out there. I'd love to age this stuff another year, but I drank it all and can't find anymore around Chi-town. Big fan, and one of my personal favorites"
"Pours a dark brown colored body, with a tannish colored head, okay. Has a very hoppy aroma, with some malts, fresh & fizzy smelling, also coffee. Has a coffee taste, malty nutty, balanced somewhat by the hops. Some alcohol."
"O - This certainly a delicious brew that is well balanced in flavor with a fair amount of complexity and a bouquet. I would love to see what this does in a year or two."
"I could drink a bomber of this (although I've only seen it in 12oz bottles; not draft either)."
"Drinkability is pretty high for me, particularly for the style and age, it's a drinkable 'old ale' for sure. But it's definitely an American take on the style, lacking the intense malt centralization that characterizes the English versions that define the style. Great price and availability increases the drinkabilty for sure, i should try to age a few at some point..."
"Weird beer at first, but as the palate acclimated, got better. Split the difference in the score."
"Drinkability is very good considering the style and ABV. Goes down easily thanks to good balance and well masked alcohol."
"One of the finest winter warmers I've tasted. Looking forward to spending more time with this next holiday."
"M/D - Nice drinking brew, a 2008 that I consumed fresh, I look forward to putting the next one away for a year to compare."
"D- Pretty smooth for a fresh old ale. I do not really dig the flavor, but who knows, with some time on this it may turn into something totally different."
"Overall a nice balance but the flavors don't seem to have melded. Lacks a fruity, brandy-like underpinning that makes a good barleywine IMO. Bitterness is a bit astringent, despite a year in the cellar. Did the fruity elements drop out? I have had this fresh and enjoyed it. Aging may not have benefitted it much. Not bad, but not great."
"This was sweeter and thicker than other old ale styles I've had over the winter months. It's packed with brown sugar, and reminds of a high alcohol brown ale at points. Definitely something I'll need to get more of, and a new winter classic that will be on my list every season."
"Drinkability: Tried it when I first bought it in 2007, have one left, gonna store it for at least another year, or so, and then compare it to that years batch. Will be going back to this one as often as possible. It is a rich and rewarding beer in all of the sensory experience compartments, truly worth a try!"
"For a winter brew its not so drinkable, for an old ale, in my limited experience with the style, its good enough."
"Picked up a single at Charleston Beer exchange. Pours dark dark amber with a tan thick head that stays around for a very long time. Nice sticky lacing rims the glass with every sip. Aroma is of strong roasted malts with a strong alcohol presence. The taste is very malty with a nice hoppy finish. Alcohol is very evident throughout with a nice warming finish. A beer that is to partaken slowly savoring every sip."
"[Edit] Returning to this beer three months later, I found the raw chocolate flavors had intensified a great deal and the mouthfeel was creamier. Delicious!"
"Pours a deep caramel with a decent initial head and some lacing. Smell is balance between malt and hops. Taste starts with a tad of malt sweetness, a kick of hops and harsh alcohol overall. I believe I will age some of these bottles to see if they become less harsh. Because of the alcohol harshness, the mouthfeel is likewise harsh.. Drinkability also suffers a tad. Will revisit in another 6 months."
"Im in heaven. Im glad I finally found this. I will be trying to get it every year to see how it ages over time."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. I'm not sure if this beer merits all the awards on the label. It's good, but not spectacular. More flavor would be ideal. Decent."
"Picked up a single at Liberty St. Tavern for home consumption. This beer remidns me both of a smokey scotch ale and an imperial brown ale. The aroma has strong German milk chocolate scent (like Milka) with toasted whole grain bread. The flavor brings out a sharper campfire smoke taste along with more of the toasty chocolate and a bit of herbal and grapefruit hops. All in all, a very nice ale for the winter."
"D-This is one tasty beer, a mix of deep complexity and smooth drinkability. I think this one is a wonderful winter brew."
"Poured a nice burnt orange and two inch fluffy white head. Smell was very piney and lots of sweat maltiness as well. Taste was well balanced between the hops and a nice sweet finish. This beer goes down very well for a higher ABV. Fist time i have tried a Great Divide beer but it is worth searching out after this delicious offering."
"D- i have to say i am impressed. Great brew and i could drink it all day but would be hammered after a few. ABV is the only thing that brings the drinkability down."
"D: Still quite good. For the price it is a tasty treat."
"Ok, but not somethin I will go out and purchase"
"A very nice Old ale from Great Divide. Smooth and quite drinkable. It really hits the spot on a cold January evening."
"Drinkability is very good. This is an excellent old ale / winter warmer. It's quite strong, but man, I'd be happy to have another one of these."
"A great winter warmer, with an almost perfect feel and taste. It's one I wouldn't mind having again."
"Smooth and silky mouthfeel slowly pushed forward by a lighter level of carbonation. Initially sweet and chocolaty giving way to a drying lactic acid and alcohol finish. The finish threw me initially, but I've since warmed up to its peculiarity. The mix of hops and sourness is odd. It should be noted that the lactic acid presence is not spoilage. Fairly drinkable old ale and not quite as sweet or fruity as some others of the same style."
"Dark brown with a slight copper in color with a thick beige head. A sweet and hoppy combination in smell with a slight vanilla. It is brown sugar with a bite in taste. The malt hits the 'buds' first and follows with bitterness. Leaves a little bit on the tongue. Not as drinkable as I would like. I like this beer, but, at this point I'm thinking that I may be a bit done with the Winter Brews. I have to admit, it warms the tummy as you drink it."
"mouthfeel is bitter, thick and syrupy, creamy, sweet, hop lingering, roasty, definately a sipper, dry lingering aftertaste is almost astringent this fresh, an excellent old ale fresh and with some time on it mmm"
"Medium body, creamy feel, with some buttery slipperiness. Light/moderate carbonation."
"I'm enjoying this right after a Southern Tier Old Man, and while that was a good beer this is definitely superior. It's more flavorful and drinkable, and is definitely a winter beer I would seek out again."
"Overall it's a good beer for this type, but I don't like this type so it's not really for me."
"I liked it, as far as I know I have never had an ""old ale""...im curious to see how the other ones are compared to this one"
"After I drank another one, I enjoyed much more and finished the rest of them so I'm going to up my ratings."
"D - A nice, solid winter beer."
"Was an interesting change of pace from many of my hop focused brews."
"Pours dark dark amber with a tan thick head that stays around for a very long time. Very nice lacing. Smell is strong of roasted, sweet malts. In fact, I didn't even have to put my nose to the glass to smell it. The taste has a slight hop bite that quickly blends to a strong roasted malt flavor. Alcohol is very evident, but doesn't take away fromt the flavor. Infact the alcohol adds a nice warming effect."
"D - This is a nice, drinkable beer. The hop character is well done with some flavor and aroma but an emphasis on bitterness that keeps the strong malt character from becoming cloying. Overall, a very nice example of an old ale."
"Really extraordinary beer. Get some if you can."
"Fairly drinkable, with an alcohol presence that is well-hidden on the palate, but one that shows itself afterward. Delicious and balanced, though; a great companion for a cold night and a nice representation of the style."
"Drinkability: Extremely smooth and well crafted. Great Divide suggests pairing with aged hard Dutch cow's milk cheese, roasted chicken, and grilled veggies. Unfortunately, I had none of that. But I can see it going well with any hearty ""meat and potatoes"" meal. This brew is the perfect warmer on a cold wet winters night. Highly drinkable and enjoyable!!!"
"Hazy brown in color, with a head that sticks to the side of the glass. Smells of roasted malt and alcohol. The taate is very robust, coffee and nut flavors balacing with the malts. Very malty, and almost a smoky aftertaste. The best old ale I've had to date, although it is not very much alike the others I've had. Even though it is not like many old ales, it is still an exceptional strong ale."
"Very nice, interesting beer from Great Divide. I do enjoy Winter Beers, but they tend to be one dimensional. This beer is more versatile and not just for cold weather hibernating."
"D - This one's a sipper and a damn good one."
"Taste is even better! A real delicate taste of ginger-snaps, caramel, almost a date plum-ish sweetness. Really balanced, it's almost like this I've imagined that North Coast's Old Stock ale would become after some cellaring."
"A very good winter beer, the easiest drinking old ale I have ever had; tasty and worth going back for another."
"This is one of those beers you just sit back and marvel at once poured. It has a deep, copper/mahogany color with stunning clarity and a beautiful head. As you drink it, the head sticks to the glass in an array of little bubbles. Such a nice looking brew! The aroma gives off toasted biscuit, a touch of raisin, dried currants, a little wet earth, and a good blast of hops. On the tongue, this one is no lightweight - a lot of big, malt expressions and a liberal amount of hoppy bitterness - yet it is quite well-balanced. It has a nice full body, and a smooth mouthfeel. It is strong without being overly aggressive. After a couple, you're definitely feeling warm inside, which makes it a great beer to quaff down on a cold, winter's night. A big thumbs up for me."
"This beer is very good. Great smell of cherries, plum, roasted grain, and slight mocha. Taste is sweet malt. Slight oaky flavor. Caramel sweetness. Medium body with warming effect. This is a nice complex beer. Great for the cold months. Could definitly have another but not too many more."
"The taste is just too dominated by the liquor. There is a strong chocolatey, caramel, toffee presence to the beer, just as the nose would indicate, but the alcohol just overpowers what could have been an interesting beer. This is a thick, full bodied, somewhat syrupy, sticky type of beer, with some carbonation. The aftertaste is the throaty burn, astringent bite from too much alcohol. Tis a pity but this could have been a better beer."
"Drinkability is solid. I could probably drink 2 of these. Not a session beer but not a task to drink either. Nose was much more boozy than the actual taste to me but perhaps it has mellowed a lot in a year. Really tasty complex beer I will have to try again."
"D- This is not a style I have regular experience with but I have to say I a very large fan of this beer. Its a perfectly warming winter beer."
"Just outstanding, and every bit as good as Sam Adams Winter Lager as a Warmer. My next move is to grab a sixer for cellaring this winter. Don't miss it."
"D: not particularly sessionable, but a fine beer nonetheless. its warming me up quite nicely on this cold winter night."
"What a sensory smack. Very complex. And not for everyone. The beer pours a very deep mahogany with ruby accents. Rich creamy 2 finger head fizzes to a dainty ring and some lacing. Very clear. Aromas of chocolate, port, and citrus from the hops. As the beer warms alcohol becomes more pronounced. Flavor starts a smack in the face of chocolate, toffee malts and definately some sherry. A very abrupt waft of hops usurps everything almost shutting down the flavors for a moment. Finish is warm, malty and somewhat dry. In the mouth a full bodied beer with decent carbonation. Tootsie roll chewy and thick. Presence of diacytal. Low drinkability as the alcohol character really develops in the glass and become a bit intense. Overall? A challenge I'm up to again. A great beer for a miserable cold night."
"Label says bottled 10/29/08, tasted 11/30/08. Poured into standard pint glass. Pours a rich dark amber, with about 1/4"" of smooth head that slowly dissipates leaving just a ring around the edge of the glass. Not getting a lot of strong aroma, a little bit of caramel and a little earthy hops. Taste is rich and complex. Roasted malt, a little oak, spicy, earthy hops. Mouthfeel is medium-full, creamy texture, just enough carbonation. Drinkability is good, having no problem sipping this at a medium pace."
"D: Truly a outstanding beer full of warming alcohol (8.1%abv) and woody complexity."
"Always love me some Old Ale's. Pours dark brown with cherry hues and is blanketed by one and a half fingers of bubbly tan head that hangs around for a couple of minutes before retreating and leaving a thin, pocked, curvy lacing behind. The initial whiff reveals big hops, and almost nothing else. On a second whiff the complexities open up with some sweet bread, dark fruits, yeasts and medicinal notes, which all come together to form an almost perfect aromatic experience. Tastes of sweet malts, yeast, caramel, and spice, with a timely hop bitterness thrown in for balance. This one's not too highly carbonated, and the mouth-feel is crisp at first, but finishes with a creaminess that helps it go down smooth, with a little alcoholic aftertaste behind. This is another exceptional old ale to add to a too-short list of old ales that I've tried and must return to."
"D-This may be the best winter seasonal I have had this year as far as warmers go It does not get better than this for me."
"Pours a clear chestnut brown color with an amber hue, nice frothy tan head that settled into a solid ring. The aroma is of milk chocolate, a slight mint tingle, and a subtle dark fruit undercurrent. Nice rich milk chocolate aroma. Big chocolate in the flavor, a bit more of a bitter chocolate, the hops are bitter and noticable but not necessarily specific. Some light honey and perhaps a fig sweetness. Not sure I get Old Ale from this, definitely malty strong ale. The feel is well and chewy, with enough of a tingley carbonation to keep the malt honest, finishes with a bitter malt and hop bite. A very nice super malty beverage with bitter hop bite; some nice chocolate flavors."
"Drinkability: A strange but delicious brew, and one I'm glad I got a chance to try. The peppermint thing is really offputting at first (at least, it was to me), but once I recognized what I was tasting, I got into it and really enjoyed this one."
"Pours a very nice dar brown color, with a nice bit of head and some very good lacing. It has a very heady scent, very earthy, malty, deep, and dark. Same for the taste, a wonderfully thick old ale that feels like a nice ent-drink, I feel a few inches taller all ready. It goes down great, a nice smooth, if thick, beer for such a heady, malty, beast."
"Drinkability: This is a beer I can definetley see drinking throughout the holidays, it's got good characteristics with it's malty profile, and a blend of the right flavors to warm you up on a cold winter night. I might have to leave one of these for Santa instead of the traditional Milk & Cookies. An excellent beer for any holiday gathering."
"Purchased from Bruisin' Ales in Asheville North Carolina, this holiday beer poured a rich deep red color with a off-white to light tan colored creamy head. Light toasty malt aromas waft up from the slowly dissipating head. The lacing on the glass is a little thinner than expected, but nothing to complain about. The aftertaste is a little... ashy? though, but overall a good winter ale."
"This is a very enjoyable beer, but a single bottle is enough for the night. The other five bottles are going straight to the cellar and I have pretty high expectations for them."
"2008 bottle from Colorado Liquor Mart. Pours clear amber. Not a very strong smell, but some malts and floral notes. Tastes very malty, again with the floral characteristics, somewhat sweet, and a fair amount of hops. Mouthfeel is medium to thick body and carbonation. Not an overpowering beer, which makes this more drinkable than some other old ales."
"Cheers!!!!"
"Pours a very dark chocolate espresso with an off white creamy head that crowns with large bubbles. Smells full! Notes of whole wheat bread, burnt caramel, strawberries, a faint citrus note. Very sweet! Taste follows with fresh berries, molasses, a bit of spiced citrus, some toast and burnt marsh mellow. Mouthfeel is full and allows the taste to linger. Very nice old ale, a bit roastier than I am used to but SOLID for these fridged 55 degree South East Texas nights."
"Update Jan 09, upped the appearance score, lovely, lowered the drinkability, a bit heavy to get through but nice, as for the taste including the nice chocolate, it has a strong rough barley malt backbone just right to back the chocolate, and the end is well balanced not sweet, enjoyable for sure."
"Definately worth a try"
"D: Overall, this isn't a bad beer. It's not my favorite Great Divide product, but it's not bad either."
"Mouthfeel is full, medium bodied and nice carbonation. More carb than I'd expect based on what it looks like but good. I could definitely drink a couple of these. The alcohol is high but it never really dominates and the flavors bring continuous interest in the beer. Good stuff."
"Heavy, sweet malt flavor from the onset...stereotypical of the style. Roasted malts, chocolate, and a conglomerate of dark fruits.. Sticky texture, massive body..drinkability is on-par for the style, but nothing that's really above & beyond. Alcohol is perceived, but acceptable for an 8+% brew. I enjoyed this one for sure, but this is certainly not one that forced me to pay attention to it like some other Great Divide brews do."
"Tastes roasty with a very nice mouthfeel to it. Sticks around the palate just long enough to remind you it's there."
"Drinkability: Goes down pretty easy. Lives a strong hop aftertaste."
"Overall this is another beer that doesn't disappoint from Great Divide, be sure to give this one a shot if you see it around."
"pours a dark copper colrwith a small white bubbly head that quickly fades. Aroma is a sweet caramel malt. Taste is rich with a caramel malt followed by a nice hop balance. Decent carbonation, somewhat of heavy aftertaste, but manageable. A very good beer for a cold winters' nite."
"Super creamy mouthfeel. It is filling, but not overly so. Very easy to drink and the ABV is deceptive."
"Pours a dark copper color with a small tan head that quickly settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. The smell is sweet and malty. Alcohol is very much evident in the smell and taste. Nice caramel flavor before the alcohol takes over on the finish leaving a warming effect. Bitterness is very low. Medium body with low carbonation. A nice ale. One of these will be all I would want to drink in a session."
"A good beer, but hard to imagine downing more then one of these at a sitting."
"Dark amber pour with a lasting cream colored head. Quite fragrant with red fruits, piney hops and some malt. Fairly lively mouthfeel. Some malt, bread, raisin with a little pine. Flavors open up nicely as this warms. Faint red fruits but not tart at all. A solid amount of hop character balancing well throughout. More than usual hops for an old ale. Rather crisp and clean. Dangerously drinkable for 8%. Will be curious to see this one age a bit."
"D: Probably not many more than one of these. Rich and decadent."
"Tasty, tasty, and quite drinkable. Many more of these shall be consumed, now that they are readily available to me."
"Overall - A pretty good and very American take on an Old Ale... definitely worth a try..."
"The drink is sliky-smooth and on the heftier end of the spectrum, but the mild and wonderful flavor profile makes Great Divide's Hibernation Ale extremeley drinkable for the style and the burly 8.1% abv."
"This beer is really good. Rich, but definitely one I could enjoy a few of. I could probably go on and on about the amazing taste. Mostly I just want to get done typing this so I can sit back and enjoy the rest of this thing. Definitely an amazing beer. This tops out at 8.1%, but the higher alcohol isn't too upfront. It is definitely a sipping beer, but after you taste it, you'll see why.. you'll want to saver the complexity going on here. Ok, enough - of to enjoy the rest of this thing!"
"05 edition, this is a mighty fine Old Ale/Strong Ale that drinks like a Barleywine. Thick amber pour with an initial fluffy head that dwindles to a nice film that leaves a lot of lacing. Hearty aroma, slight alcohol tinge to the nose. Heavy maltiness with an equally heavy hop scent roasted malts and floral hops. Not too thick on the palate, this is a relatively easy drink considering the potency of this brew. Flavor is intense and wonderful. Thick dark malts of caramel and coffee along with some bitter cocoa. Thick hops, rather floral with a resinous bitterness. Oh boy this is spectacular, very enjoyable on a blustery windy Friday night."
"I'm not really sure whether this ought to be classified as an English Style Old Ale - the hops are too dominant for that and, if I was being really strict, I would have to score it fairly low for being off style - it certainly wouldn't do well in a homebrew competition! However, it is a very good ale and a good argument for the creation of an American Style Old Ale category!"
"This is approaching a sipper with such a full body and the high ABV but is very enjoyable. This is one of the plus side old ales that I've had. Another fine beer from Great Divide."
"D - With a 8.1 ABV I am feeling this beer after about half of it. I doubt I can drink more than 2, but it makes for a great winter warmer."
"Pours a fairly dark reddish-brown color with one finger of relatively creamy tan head. Pleasant aroma, not overpowering, malty and sweet. Lots of caramel, molasses, toffee, some slightly vinous dried fruits. Taste is really quite good, very malty. A bit stronger than the aroma with lots of strong nutty, caramel and toffee flavors. Lots of dried fruit esters. A bit port-like. A mere hint of alcohol. Another burst of malt before a somewhat dry finish. Good mouthfeel with a full, slightly chewy body and low-moderate carbonation. Alcohol is evident but not at all overpowering. Drinkability is excellent. This beer is very complex, nuanced and a pleasure to drink. Very well executed and a great brew. Highly recommended."
"The rub is that while this beer has some amazing flavors...it's drinkability is pretty low. Often I'll take forever to finish one and on a few occasions I can't. There's just something very potent about it, and I don't mean booziness. It's almost just a little too concentrated. Still, split a bottle with someone and you'll love it!"
"D-This is a good sipper, I love it in small doses."
"Very nice, this is my first warmer of the season. I was impressed"
"D - the mouthfeel and extra alcohol make it a little less drinkable but the alcohol is well hidden"
"Flavor is much better, thankfully. It's rich in malt with a slight roasty character. Nice hop bitterness. Great balance to the equation. This be would an exceptional cold weather beer to sip slowly by the fire with my girl and my dogs."
"This has a beautiful deep red color with a thin residual head. The aroma is full of toffee, grains, and malt. The body is full and tastes of malty goodness, with only mild bitterness underneath. It finishes with a malty, grainy aftertaste. This graininess isn't quite a barnyard wet blanket flavor, but a subtle form of that. The alcohol is slightly noticeable and contributes to the experience. Overall it's a very tasty, interesting beer."
"Drinkability- No bad but not really my style."
"D - ABV masked well, can't do it all night, but one entices another."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a big lacing head. Wow! This smells great. Aroma of piney hops with a bit of brown sugar and alchohol. Flavor is roasted coffee, caramel, toffee, mmm.... bitter sting of hops at the end. Lively carbonation and a very long lasting finish that kinda kills the palate. I could see this one knocking me out for the winter."
"A surprising beer that starts dry with dark malt caracter and then changes to a more friendly beer with a full taste."
"D-Not a session beer, but drinkable."
"Enjoyable, but a bit harsh at times. I'd like to see what some more time will do to this one."
"D. Ah Yes, the drinkability of the Hibernation is exhilirating to say the least. Sip on this beer all night and hope it does not catch up with you. The Hibernation Ale could be the perfect night cap."
"D. Very good, despite the ABV. I could sense this had an old ale feel, even though it was described to me as a strong ale. Whatever it is, I like it."
"nice amber malt and big on hops, a real good ballance from start to finish. i think that this one would celler very well, it might take away the slight ruffness of the the alcohal. i wish that i had more than one of theese! for a style i dont usaly like, this one is good."
"Impressed and a lot better than the Yeti I opened the evening with (in my opinion)."
"Definitely recommended..."
"Hibernation is not only one of the better American Old Ales I've had, it may be the single most drinkable. It's delicious and a feather in the cap for Great Divide. Stock up when you see it to get you through the year!"
"Pours a medium to dark copper color with an off white head that laces down the entire glass. Smell is piny hops, and a bit of dark chocolate. Taste has a bit of caramel and chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel moderate carbonation. Not a bad brew. Definitely a sipper. Nice beer for a cold night by the fire."
"Hibernation is a solid Old Ale. The flavors and aromas meld together nicely. It is a very pleasant and smooth sipper and it's a-makin' me about ready for a nap."
"Certainly worthwhile and I would recommend. I imagine it would be much better if drunk during winter months."
"Overall: A really tasty brew. One of the best Old Ales I've had, although Bell's still tops it out."
"Wow what a beer. And at 8.10% what a dangerous beer! If I ever find this on tap I might not make it home in one piece..."
"Mild in terms of carbonation and in the end it goes down smoothly. With a mild hoppy wave rolling in over your tongue as a finish."
"Thanks again to tayner for this gem!"
" I was impressed with the drinkability of this brew. I think that though the dry hopping took center stage, it made for a crisp taste that I could see drinking very easily."
"This was a really good ale and if I didn't have to get back to work I would have drank quite a few more."
"4/4/3.5"
"Took a nice big mouthfull. Had a great sweet carmel malt with a nice hoppy balance. with a touch of alcohol. I could definetly could drink a couple of these a nice cold winter day. Another great beer from the guys at Great Divide."
"I can't wait to try next year's batch."
"This is a heavy beer, notable in it's taste and apperance. It has a syrupy character, but a relatively slight head. The liquid is a woody brown color, opaque, and somewhat attractive. The nose is all malt, with just a touch of hops. There's also a distracting medicinal, or chlorine-like aroma. The taste is rich and sweet, with copious malt flavors. Drinkable and enjoyable, I'd certainly have this again."
"I could drink several of these on a cold winter's night. Great offering. One of the better warmers I had this year."
"Drinkability: The beer was aptly named; it has great warming qualities."
"D: The alcohol flavors come on pretty strong towards the bottom of the glass. Thankfully, that's balanced nicely by the all of the roasted/toasted characteristics of this beer."
"D: Well hidden alcohol with a nice sweet malt taste is rather pleasant... drink this before the warm weather gets here..."
"Overall - Flavors have really mellowed and meshed, making it harder to dissect; it's very pleasing to drink, but this has become quite a bit sweeter than when fresh. Also, I'm not sure how much this would have changed if it were kept at a warmer temp (will find out next month). In the end, I like this better fresh, but I'm holding out hope that 2+ year-old bottles will really develop into something remarkable."
"Drank another one last night...alcohol laid down a bit but the caramel was still pretty strong. This beer tasted completely different in 3 months time. I really enjoyed it more than I did and it wasn't bad to begin with. I raised the drinkability from 3.5 to 4."
"Taste is bitter with citric US hoppy notes, pretty aggressive hop bite. The bitterness is supported by malty and roasted notes. The beer is not sweet, just a little sticky. To me this beer tastes like a hybrid between an IPA and a barleywine. I am not sure why this is an old ale, let alone what an old ale actually is. Just grabbed a slice of blue cheese with this beer and wow, this beer tastes great in combination with that. The woody notes of the beer are great with the salty taste of the cheese."
"Picked up a six pack for last Saturday night. Poured into a stemmed beer glass. The color was dark, dark amber. Had to be careful with the second beer, as it forms quite a head. The smell reminded me a lot of a winter warmer, with spice present. The taste was very good. A nice combination of coca and cinnamon on the tongue. This old ale had me thinking of a porter's mouthfeel along with a winter ale's hearty flavor. A great combination. Drinkability being the only issue, as it's over 8%, you could start to feel it kick in after two. I would love to see how this beer would age over time. It would be nice to see more breweries release an old ale in six pack format, as I could see this style become one of my favorites."
"D: This is a drinkable beer; however, I don't know I'd want to drink much of it because of the high alcohol content."
"Served in my Great Divide pint glass. Poured a dark, translucent amber. Half-inch off-white head dissipated into a thin skim of spotty foam; very little lacing present during the tasting. Nose presented primarily as roasted malt with a touch of hops also detected. Taste was surprisingly more complex given the nose. Flavors of coffee and caramel with a slight hops bitterness at the finish. Full-bodied mouthfeel with a fair amount of effervescence considering the lack of a head. Very drinkable. Alcohol was well-hidden and the taste, overall, was very much reminiscent of a nice malty coffee porter."
"Drinkability: A nice winter sipper. I got two as part of a mixed six pack of winter beers. The two are enough for me, a nice little treat on a cold night near the end of winter. A good tasting beer, just not one I want a lot of (leading to the lower drinkability)."
"I like this beer. Well balanced with a great mouthfeel. You don't want to drink this very fast though."
"Pours a five finger light tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Clear ruby/amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Smoky/malty nose. Flavor is smoky, malty with some sweetness. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from John's Marketplace Portland, OR."
"I sampled this brew from a 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. It was dark brown with a light tan one finger head. It smelled of roasted malts and nice floral hops. coldn't wait to take a drink. Flavor delivers on all fronts. Nice bitterness from the hops is balanced with the malt sweetness."
"Pours a clear, very dark amber color with a big, creamy, tan head. Terrific lacing to boot. A nice foam ring is left in the wake of each sip. Smells fruity, dark fruits in particular, figs, sweet malts, and citrus notes. Taste is more sweet, dark ripe fruits, figs, cherries, malty, and finishes with a great dry hop bite. Mouthfeel is rich, full bodied, right amount of carbonation for the style, with a dry finish. Nice warming effects going on as well without any harshness in the flavor. Very drinkable on these cold winter nights."
"This brew has an excellent finish. I'll look forward to drinking more of these."
"Lower carbonation and a rich, creamy mouthfeel makes this a very drinkable beer."
"D - very enjoyable and easy to drink, be aware of the higher abv and enjoy this brew in moderation."
"D - This is a really great beer. I really like all of the flavors presented here...they are quite a different tone than most beers. The alcohol is not noticeable, and the soft earthy and toasty notes are perfect for a winter snow day."
"The beer poured a deep reddish-black color with a thin tan head into a 12-oz pilsner glass. The smell was of currant/black cherry, chocolate, and roasted malt - fantastic! The initial taste was of the currant/black cherry component, but transitioned quickly into a big roasted, toasted malt finish with a nice hop bite at the end. This seems more like an imperial stout than an old ale, but I'm nit-picking. An outstanding effort - great on a cold winter's day."
"A very smooth and malty ale for the winter months. Very good example of an Old English Ale."
"This is going to be one of my regular winter beers. Don't miss this one!"
"This was an excellent beer. The taste was very unique - almost like bread. The mouthfeel was the best part of this beer as it was almost chewy. A very warming beer and yet another great addition to the Great Divide arsenal."
"Pours a nice sturdy head, with a vibrant blend between caramel and carmalized brown sugar. The taste starts with raisin and apples that fades into a silky butterscotch mid palate. some spicy hops come marching in at the finish to balance out this wonderful malty brew. One of the best winter ale's available."
"This beer poured nice and dark brown with a bit of a rosie hue. A bit of head that doesn't stick around too long, but long enough to look prettty, which is all that matters, right? Aroma is malty and hoppy. It is a nice change from the piney/citrusy american hops I am used to lately. It has an herbal and earthy quality that melds nicely with the fruity malt. Taste is sweet up front with a big bitter kick at the end. With the finish it has I would almost call this an IPA. But alas, there is a ton of fruit, raisin, plum action going on with a little bit of chocolate. It has a nice english hop character, and again, killer bitterness. The bitterness really saves the drinkability, as I am afraid it would be a little cloying without it. Mouthfeel is a little rich, but with a prickly carbonation. The bitter finish and carbonation really lighten it up and enhance the drinkability. All in all a great beer. Thanks J.!"
"Tastes of sweet, sugary malts with fruit, alcohol esthers, and lots of hops, which pull through especially well on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit thick & viscous on the palate with some sticky alpha acids that make for a puckering finish. Hibernation is definately a sipping beer: it's heavy and laden with flavor and complexity. I'll be back for more next winter."
"Pours a very cola like color, hazy ruby/brown mixture with 1/2 inch off-white head that dissipates quickly, little lacing. Smells are amazing, lots of oak and vanilla, as well as caramel, chocolate, cream, dark fruit, earthy hops, and alcohol. Tastes just as good as it smells, lots of vanilla and toffee, dark fruits such as cherries and raisins, maple sugar, and bitter chocolate, with pine and alcohol in the finish. Medium in body with medium carbonation and a nice dry finish. The alcohol is noticeable, and gives off a very warming feeling, definitely a nice beer for warming up from the cold, or as a nightcap."
"A dark root beer color with a big tan head that settles and lots of clumpy lace. There is a sharp chocolate aroma with odd citrus hops overtones. It's a very unusual smell that is not immediately recognizable or even obviously attractive. The taste is smooth and heavy with charcoal, chocolate, plenty of alcohol, a bit wine-like. I wouldn't call this highly drinkable but it has a real quality feel in its body. It's a bit too heavy for my tastes but it is good. Recommended to those who prefer some weight to their brews."
"this beer pours with a decent sized cappuccino like head that dissipates to wisps leaving some bubbles of lace on the side of the glass. The body of the beer is a fairly clear dark amber. The smell of the beer is up front with chocolate notes with very subtle fruit and hop aromas. The taste is very much as would be expected; up front with the chocolate, followed with a subtle fruityness (cherrys) and bit of hop flavor. You can also taste a bit of the alcohol hotness as it goes down your throat. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of dryness (from the hops). This beer is low in carbonation and incredibly smooth for a 8.1% beer. Overall, a nice winter seasonal, it will be interesting to see how it ages."
"I have only seen this in my neck of the woods once and grabbed this six pack in late 2006 with little to no question. This was probably not aged entirely properly in the store, but has been kept cellared properly since. An amazing aged brew."
"Dark ruby brown appearance. Off white head falls to some sticky lacing. Aromas of carmel, toffee, green leafy hops. (Kinda has a herbal smell.) Tastes of chocolate, malt, carmel, roasted nuts, spice, and has a nice earthy piney hop finish. Slight alcohol warming after each sip. Mouth feel is medium bodied and sticky. Drinkability is fantastic. I couldn't put my glass down. If I have the will power, it will be interesting to see how this one does with some time in the cellar. Another solid brew from Great Divide. Highly recommended!"
"D- solid"
"I reviewed this only because i had a vintage-one last week and forgot to review it. This one was fresh. Cellaring this baby for a year does wonders but it is still very nice fresh. Give it a go!"
"D: Nice tasting brew especially after working in the snow all day. A very good night cap brew."
" Would love to see how this holds up to some age."
"Pretty-looking, lacking a little in flavor and mouthfeel, but all in all, pretty good. There are others I'd rather have, however."
"Tried to get through this, couldn't. Hopefully my last drainpour of 2007."
"Overall: Decent to good, drinkable, interesting. A nice winter warmer, and worth drinking. While I think that Great Divide's high gravity beers are among the best in their respective classes, I have typically not been very impressed with GD's standards. Hibernation sort of straddles the line between the huge beers, and the lackluster standards, and does it well. It's not amazing, but it's solid, and I'd buy it again."
"Very drinkable. Of all the winter offerings out there, I like this one quite"
"Truly a good beer. I think I get another six pack to enjoy it on a winters night (hopefully available in the Netherlands)."
"At 8.1% ABV, it can be overpowering and it definitely has a mood altering affect that will induce hibernation."
"Moderate carbonation and a relatively crisp texture despite it's heavier/roasty nature. Smooth with lots of warmth in the finish. A nice toasty, pleasurable cold weather brew."
"An american old ale? A nice attempt, but the hops seem to overshadow the malt bordering more on an American Barleywine. Good, but not my favorite from this amazing brewery."
"This is a good Winter brew for folks like me who do not like the holiday spiced beersbut not something I would seek out year round."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation is good. ABV is pretty good for this beer. It's blended well and not very noticeable. Goes down pretty smooth. Drinkability is good for such a big beer. Overall, this is a very solid offering from Great Divide."
"Mouthfeel was very average. Lack of a good hop presence decreased my interest in having another, so I downgraded the drinkability."
"Served in a pint glass, a deep red/dark brown brew with a slight skin of head that clung to the surface for a while. Nose was biscuits and malts. Taste was nutty, maybe hazelnuts, malty, and slight hops on the end. Not too shabby. Slight alcohol as well. Mouthfeel was good."
"On one hand, the warming alcohol of this beer is perfect for a cold night like tonight, but on the other hand, the hops after awhile tend to become the dominant flavor from this beer, and for some people that might become a bit too much to handle. It's not a session beer, that's for sure. Is this a beer that you could have one or two whilst sitting in front of a fire, reading a book, watching some late night television while it is cold outside? Of course it is. But I think there are a lot of winter-specific beers that are better suited and not as possessing in hops; I would probably rank this above the overly-sweet barley wines and over coffee'd/roasted malt'd stouts because it most certainly is a nice and unique interpretation of an old ale; it just goes back to the adage of why mess with a good thing. I almost find myself wishing that Great Divide had kept the recipe a little closer to the classic style with this one. This is my first Great Divide beer, and I'm nothing if not excited to see what they do with their other styles. Nothing if not a beer that makes you think."
"Peeling labels did detract a bit from the appearance of the bottle, but don't let that stop youi."
"D: Hmm, under $10 for a six pack of this? That makes it extremely drinkable. The taste is also wonderful for a seasonal offering. One of the most solid winter offerings."
"It's easy to make a big, malty brew. It's not so simple to craft a blended, balanced, down to earth mondo ale, but this is sparkling evidence that it can indeed be accomplished. Make no mistake, the ABV is a snippy bitch, but well worth bearing for another one or two, should the next morning permit it. And if I make it to a third or fourth, well, I'll likely live up to this beer's name for a day or two."
"Drinkability: I like a malty beer that is on the sweet side. This one fits the bill.... good solid OLD ALE.... Drink this one all day long...."
"A little too much alcohol to be really drinkable. After a couple you really start to feel it. This has been one of my holiday favorites the last few years."
"D: A solid offering, and definitely a great selection for winter drinking. If I could find this in my area, it would be a regular in my fridge."
"Interesting - tasty - Appropriately malty with a glimpse of bitter, leafy hops coming through. A good one to sip on in the winter weather."
"Part three of a night of Great Divide, this is the 2007 edition of the Hibernation seasonal. This ale has a very hearty appearance, fairly opaque, dark amber with a thin head. The aroma is crisp, with hints of hops and spices mixed together. Within the flavor you get chocolate, brown sugar along with a spice that I couldn't quite put my finger on. The texture is nice, with a sense familiar to ""winter warmers", and there is a sweetness to the aftertaste. Definitely a good example of a winter ale, good thing I have another bottle stashed away for the holidays."
"D - Not exactly a session beer, but a good way to kick off the night. Very enjoyable, but a bit heavy for heavier drinking. I've been craving this beer for a while and glad I picked up another 6pack."
"I have never been a big fan of malty christmas ales, but this one is pretty decent. It pours a dark brown with reddish hue and thin head. The nose is immeadiatly malty and reflects the taste. The first sip and taste is eerily similar to deschuttes jubelale, however the finish is stronger with even more of a malty taste and warmer resolution ( due to the 8.1% abv im sure) i would guess this would be quite good after a year of cellaring at the right temp. good ale, start with a few belgians, finish with a few of these."
"a great winter brew! ... very assertive ... lacing is wunderbar! ... lots of sweet and powerful aroma's ... pours a dark brown-red colour... had at Coops... balance comes into play with this beer, but where?? ...""i finally got my diamonds"".."
"M/D: Pretty nice on the palate with low carbonation and a full body, smooth going down. Drinkability is pretty nice on this one, but it's still a sipper. Hadn't had this brew before, but now I'll think I'll pick up a couple more to lay down for some time."
"Not much on the aroma, but a good, strong taste. Lots of character, and very malty. A good amount of hops. Tough for me to put into any specific category, but a pleasant beer, especially for this time of year. I've always been a big fan of Great Divide, and this only reinforces that."
"Tasty beer with lots of character, bordering on the bizarre."
"Pours a medium to dark copper color with an off white head that laces down the entire glass. Smell is piney hops, and a bit of dark chocolate. Taste has a bit of caramel and chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel moderate carbonation. Not a bad brew. Definitely a sipper. Nice beer for a cold night by the fire."
"Can't recall what this was like freash, but after a year it has a wonderful balance and complexity. A very nice beer!"
"Medium full body and medium carbonation. Very rich but it's hard to not drink this too fast. Incredibly inviting, I wish I had a few gallons more, though it's best I don't."
"American strong ale? But the bottle says it has won awards (many!) as an English Old Ale! I'm glad it's not called one, here, 'cause I'd have to be mean in terms of style. 'Cause the use of 'merican hops in the nose and mouth as well as in bitterness (somehow not associated with the mouth) is just so not English. What were they thinking? Anyway, hey, I'm going to call this one a winter warmer and I'm going to say that I'm pretty pleased with it as such. As with all Great Divide beers I've had so far (I've had a few, ahem) it's nicely balanced. But, hey, with a big nose and flavor of citrus hops. And a fair amount of bitterness. But balanced with plenty of malt and body. Hints of chocolate and caramel... Nice."
"I like the 07, as its its own style of beer more so than the mellower 06 which tastes like a sweet barleywine to me."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. This was perfect after a long week at work and freezing temperatures outside. A strong roasted malt flavor, great if your a coffee lover. I am really satisfied after drinking just one, I would recommend this to just about anyone. Another satisfying brew from the folks at Great Divide."
"Pours a dark ruby red with a two finger light tan colored thick head. Leaves a good amount of lacing on the sides as it dies down. Sweet chocolate and caramel malts with a tiny hint of woody pine. Nutty aromas with a bit of alcohol in the nose as well. Flavor is very similar to the smell. Pretty sweet all the way through with hints of dark fruits. A booze flavor appears midway and warms the soul. Aftertaste finishes with an oak flavor and a bittering effect that actually leaves the mouth pretty dry. Mouthfeel is a bit rough around the edges. Dries the mouth a bit much and carbonation seems a excessive. Drinkability suffers a bit because of the feel, but the taste of this one makes it worth finishing. Not a bad brew, worth a shot."
"The flavor was a sweet maltiness with a little bit of hoppiness. In the mouth it was a little thin left a sensation on the tip of the tongue. Overall another strong effort from Great Divide."
"This is a full-flavored dark ale."
"D - Can still sit and sip, but the spice flavor sticks out a lot more than I remember. Has turned to more of a winter warmer and less of that smoky strong ale that I remember."
"Pours a rich dark amber/brown color with a bubbly and lively brown head that fluffs up to 2inches tall. Smell is sweet with lots of malt, and a barleywine boozy aroma. Taste is of malty bready with a little bittering malt, but it finishes mostly sweet. Mouthfeeling lingers, and it is slightly heavy in carbonation."
"Drinkability - Wow, that's all I can say. My first Great Divide brew and my first Strong Ale, great experience all around. I was hoping for something a bit darker for winter with a bit of punch and this fit the bill perfectly! It's like a Pale Ale and a Stout merged forces and came up with this amazing brew. I need to find other like this bad boy, go to any lengths to try this brew!"
"I am a big fan of the Great Divide Brewing Company, this however, is not my favorite beer of theirs. Pours a noticeable head with decent retention. I do like the appearance; I am otherwise not terribly impressed. The smell and the taste are both hop heavy. There is the hint of barley, but easily hops are the dominant theme. I am reminded more of a Dogfish IPA, probably the 60 minute. This is a good beer, although not one I would normally classify as a winter beer. It is a good beer and a drinkable one, but the hops can be a bit overwhelming, at leas t for me. If you love hops, I imagine you would like this beer. Its not quite what I expected, but its a decent beer."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a copper red with a very thin tan head that stays around for the entire duration. Aroma of malt, dark fruits, and hints of smoke and toffee. Initial flavor is caramel, fruity, and malts. Flavor turns hoppy with a hint of alcohol. Medium mouthfeel, lingering aftertaste, good lacing. Drinkable and complex."
"Overall one of my favorite winter beers, I always pick up at least one six-pack."
"Compared to my review last year, I found this beer a little less enjoyable and a little too alcoholic. Still, it is a very good beer."
"d: A good beer, but I won't seek it out again."
"single bottle from Team Beverage, Raleigh"
"Review #450!! Served a crisp deep copper with a thin head that diminished to a ring and left slight lacing. The aroma was an abundance of piny hops and caramel. The taste was a near perfect balance of pine hops and deep caramel malts, absolutely wonderful! The beer was slightly heavy, but not overbearing with tolerable warming alcohol. This beer is almost perfect for a cold winter night and certainly leaves you ready for some actual hibernation."
"GD does it again!"
"James also hooked me up with a bottle from 2006. I can't wait to see how it has aged."
"Drinkability: Very dense and solid brew. Another enjoyable offering from Great Divide. They continue to impress."
"Poured a dark amber with alot of reddish overtones. Smelled of mild vanilla and a touch of rum soaked fruit. Nice taste. Good diacetyl coming through mixed with milk vanilla and good malt flavor. Hops come through bitter on the end to balance out the sweet. Flavor coats the tongue and lingers then disappears with the hoppy bitterness coming though at the end. I enjoyed this beer. The alcohol comes through a little strong but I'm holding some back in the cellar/closet to age for a while. Should mellow nicely."
"Mouthfeel is big and a bit chewy, very pleasantly coupled with the warming nature of the beer. Recommended"
"Awesome beer, but hey, it's Great Divide - that's what I've come to expect. Happy I finally found this."
"Overall- A good Winter Warmer beer here with a big flavor and a warming alcohol presence. . 2 of these on a cold weekend evening would suffice."
"This one did its job and got me heated up on a cold night, would definitely drink this again and recommend it to others, too bad it is not available here in Southern California, go hibernate with this one when you get a chance"
"Pours reddish with a nice big tightly compacted tan colored head that recedes slowly while leaving behind a nice wash of sticky lacing. The aroma is primarily of various spices and caramel malt. Smells like winter to me. The taste is big on the caramel malt and there is a nice background depth of hop character as well. Some spices are in there too, but I can't identify them. The alcohol is perceptible, and this is definitely a true winter warmer. The mouthfeel is lively with carbonation, and not watery at all."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, good kick, not too filling, it has a lot of qualities that make it similar to a Barleywine, this is a nice beer to drink for a while, but not one that you would want to drink too quickly."
"Drinks so easy, but not one to take lightly. Usually among top 2-5 of winter/x-mas beers I try every year & this will be the case this 07-08 season!"
"I want more! I would make a session of this any day."
"Palate is full of roasted malt rounded out with miscellaneous Holiday spices. Finishes chewy & chocolatey."
"I have been cellaring this beer for a year now all because of the aged sample I had at last years GABF. The first sniff at the bottle is candied chocolate. The beer is so dark red in color it is almost brown but when held to the light it reveals itself. Nice, pillowy, khaki-colored head. The smell holds true with a sweet, full chocolate, tootsie roll and candy aroma, with slight alcohol fumes in the back; it smells fantastic! The taste is malty, cocoa powder but does not quite match the smell, which is good in my opinion. The alcohol is hiding and the mouthfeel is neither thick nor thin. I am still undecided as to whether or not I should buy more for cellaring this year since I still have several 2006 bottles. This is a very malty beer and good for a cold day such as today. Im surprised this is not in bombers or four packs but I am not going to complain because a sixer for $8 is a very good value. Drinkability suffers a little as I did not want another."
"A really nice beer to sip and savor. Pours a ruby / amber color, clear and translucent. The head is large and tan that quickly fades to a covering of the glass. Lacing is thick. The smell is distinctive and nice. You know you are going to be enjoying some dark fruits (raisins, plum figs) and malt. The taste provides a little surprise because there is a mild but crisp hops bitterness as well. The mouthfeel is rich and the flavors are beautifully balanced. I did not detect much alcohol in the taste. Drinkability here is 2 12 ouncers, any more would be self defeating for flavor and functioning. I had this one on a fairly cool summer evening. As a winter drink, this would be excellent."
"D - A very good Am. Strong. It really is flavorful."
"Overall: A great beer; too bad its available seasonally. I bought the last sixer, and Im glad I grabbed it. Grab one yourself whenever you have the chance."
"D - A damn good beer and I'm pissed that I spilled it. I'll probably grab another tomorrow."
"D: The abv is a little big to sit and pound this beer. The warming body is very enjoyable nonetheless"
"Served from a 12oz bottle, this beer had a good 2 inch head above a very dark copper color. Great smell with a floral and fruity fragrance. Taste is good but a little unbalanced on the alcohol for only 8.1%. The hops come through well with some smoky malt and then a good bitter finish from the hops again. Mouthfeel is heavy with a slightly oily feel and a little chewy as if unfiltered. Overall a great strong Ale especially as a cold evening beer."
"Label said brewed in 2006. Poured into an imperial pint glass. A nice dark brown color with a thick foamy slighty brown head. The head lasted about 1/2 the beer, with a thin layer and lacings for the rest of it. It smelled slighty sweet, very possibly a tinge of fruit, with nutty overtones. Tasted very similar. Slight spicyness, but the nutty sweetness definately set the tone. Occasional bitterness, but nothing serious. Definately warmed the insides of the body. Went down very easily and tasted great."
"poured a dark, hazy, ruby brown. no head to speak of. the nose is dominated by whiskey/oaky and sour aromas. taste: SOUR whiskey. if this beer spent time in bourbon barrels why wouldn't they indicate this on the packaging? pretty important info i would think. bourbon barrel beers are just not my thing. much lighter malt presence than i expected, no malt sweetness, very astringent/sour finish. a light carbonated whiskey is what i get from this beer. there is probably more going on but due to the aforementioned i can't tell. maybe this will improve with age? 2006 edition. little carbonation to speak of. only medium mouthfeel for the big abv. i expected a big, malty winter brew with assertive american hops but got something totally different. i am scared to try this one again but will at some point just to see if the bottle was tainted."
"Beer poured a ruby red brown with a nice initial off white head that is hanging on quite well. Nose smacks of chocolate cherry cake and sweet malts. Taste is of the chocolate malts, cherries, dark fruits with a well balanced bittering hop in the finish. The slight alcohol taste is warming and appropriate for the style. Mouthfeel is fantastic, very full and very smooth-this is perfect! Drinkability is near perfect with the only drawback is i cannot session this because of the abv. Jubelale has always been my favorite holiday beer but I may have found a new one!"
"12 ouncer with year brewed info notched on the label (2006), pours dark mahogony, semi clear, dark tan head, not much retention, leaves some scattered lacing upon a moderate swirl. Tiny bubble film oozing around on top. Nose is moderatly of darkish malts and rum. Moderate carbonation. Tasty, bold brew, notes of smoke, rum/bourbon, wood, vanilla, spicy honey...nicely crafted, complex, go get some. Fine late night sipper."
"Pours a very dark ruby with little head and no lacing. Aroma is very pleasant dark fruit and berries with chocolate and alcohol - excellent aroma. Taste is slightly overroasted malts with a mild alcohol burn and hints of brown sugar and dark fruit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very pleasant. Very drinkable winter warmer, definitely a beer to pick up every winter."
"Man this was a great beer and I was really sad to finish my last bottle. Definitely recommended."
"Pours a clear, deep mahogany with a fluffy tan head that leaves thick fingers of lace. The smell is pure malty goodness -- caramel, some dark fruit, maybe even some sweet, bready notes. The taste has all the character of the nose plus a heavy dose of bittering, and slightly earthy hops. There is also a noticable alcohol burn on the back end. The hops provide a nice counterpoint to the intense malty sweetness and give some sort of balance. The sheer weight, however keeps this from being very drinkable. This is a hearty, warming brew for the cold months and aptly named Hibernation Ale."
" A potent brew, drink responsibly!"
"Drinkability - this is most excellent ale ! The abv is just a little over my personal limit for sessionability, but just a little..., and I really like this stuff. It is too bad that it is not available year round."
"Bottle courtesy of BeerandBlues2: Poured a clear dark brown color ale with a small foamy head with better then average retention. Aroma of rich caramel malt with some medium sweetness. Taste is mix between good caramel malt with a medium bitter finish. I thought the body was a bit too thin for the style and alcohol was very well hidden. Overall, I thought it was interesting but lacking a little something to bring to the next level."
"Overall, a strong malty and yeasty strong ale. A little heavy on the alcohol and the astringency, but that should mellow out with age. Flavor is phenomenal."
"D: A stern and solid strong ale. Very well balanced. I enjoyed this brew on a cold Midwestern evening and it did a great job of warming me up in a hurry."
"Looked good. Head was minimal and fell fast but lingered until finished. Poured dark reddish brown and clearer than expected. The aroma is of caramel, hop bitterness and alcohol. Very bold flavor. The moutfeel is good, not too much. One was good enough for me."
"Overall, Hibernation Ale is a very good product from Great Divide and one worth trying if you get the chance. It is brewed only a few months each year so you need to act quickly. A few more weeks and you will have to wait until the next brewing season to begin. And this is a beer you dont want to wait for. It ranks among my favorite winter seasonals."
"This beer poured a cloudy brown color - average head. The smell is malty and caramel.very inviting. The taste is malty and caramel. It is sweet and bold. The mouthfeel is thick and a bit chewy. Overall, it is a very enjoyable brew.and while I find it quite drinkable; it may be a bit thick for others. (But I say yum!)"
"I found this brew to be very enjoyable. Complex and interesting. The aroma is amazing. Flavor is strong but unified and balanced in a way that makes it quite drinkable in spite of the high ABV. An outstanding offering from Great Divide."
"Overall a decent drinking strong ale, nice for a cold winter day."
"D: Good strong ale, big and malty with nice hoppy compliments and finish."
"Overall not the great offering that I'd expect from Great Divide. And to qualify that, I absolutely love Titan IPA and Fresh Hop, and other Great Divide brews. This one just doesn't do it for me."
"Not very drinkable. Not sessionable. If this was a characteristic bottle not recommended."
"D: A decent winter ale/seasonal that packs a bit of a punch in terms of ABV but definitely something I could drink 2-3 of in a sitting. As I haven't tried a lot of Great Divide's beers, this one is good enough to get me to try some of their others."
"Drinkability is quite high, but the alcohol is noticeable by the bottom of the glass. Two is enough...did I get enough to make it through the winter?"
"Pours a nice dark ruby brown with a tight, creamy beige head and good retention. The nose a terrific depth; nutty, dark cherries, chocolate malts, oaky, and caramelized brown sugar. Taste is just as deep with semi-tart dried dark fruits, cocoa powder, roasted figs and a great hop balance. Hops reveal some spices up front and some perfumy florals in the middle that gain ground in the end. More buttery caramel tones smooth out some of the alcohol that was bigger at the beginning although never really a problem. Full bodied and a chewy, slightly syrupy mouthfeel reveals hints of carbonation around the edges. The finish starts off with a twangy citrus but fades to dry, earthy, cocoa powder and lingering dark fruits. Mmmm...must have another."
"D: Its heaviness and high ABV make this a sipping brew for sure. But, its hearty, warming character makes it perfect to have around all winter long. One of my favorite winter seasonals."
"Just didn't work for me."
"M&D - highly drinkable due to its mellowness, a very comforting semisweet flavor, with a nice mouthcoat, a very easy down beer with a high drinkability"
"D: Pretty good. A nice balance of hops and malts. Even with its 8% abv, I could drink a few of these."
"Pours a magnificent shade of ruby-orange. The stunning clarity showcases an abundance of tiny, effervescent bubbles rising to meet a creamy pale tan head that raises just over two fingers. Thick and lasting retention leaves a stubborn coating of lace. Impressive aroma of Dark crystal malt, roasted chestnuts, chocolate, and a strong peachy grapefruit rind hop volatiles. Darkened caramel strikes the tounge first, followed by a mellow charred taste and a slight grainy flavor- almost nutty. Toasted crystal sweetness follows over into the semi-dry aftertaste, which is then dominated by citrusy, piney and grassy american hop flavor. Bitterness is acidic enough to balance the powerful malt profile, but does not linger as long and the malt is allowed to dominate. The mouthfeel is full, and rich with tannins and dextrins that threaten at cloying, but are broken up by the fine carbonation. Finishes with residual notes of chocolate, roasted barley, and caramel, and fairly matched by resinous hop oils that gently fade away. The depth of character here suggests a higher alcohol level, but despite the viscosity and robust taste, the last swigs seem as sober as the first."
"All in all not a bad brew, but I doubt I could down more than two of these in one sitting."
"D: Well this sucker is already almost gone... Is it because daddy started with scotch early? Well partially yes, but mainly this is an addictive beer. I still stand by the overpowering taste, but the mouthfeel seems to beg me for one more sip."
"Drinkability is excellent. Complexity and flavor is very enjoyable. Really has a range depending on temperature. I think it works at any temperature, but it's a different beer! This is the first single I've had in a long time that makes me want to buy as a 6-pack on a regular basis. Finally!"
"Drinkability - Tasty beer, especially in the winter months, as it has a very warming feel--would be perfect to sit down at night to watch some TV. Great, dark flavors with a noticeable hop aroma."
"Yowza. Yet another killer beer from Great Divide. This is what winter beers are all about. Just wish the freezing rain outside would turn to snow on this early February evening."
"D - I could sip on these all night. If they weren't so high in alcohol that's exactly what I would do. Why are so many of the best beers not meant to be session beers?"
"Verdict: pretty good, big on hops and malt. I have heard some people speak of this beer as like you should be counting the days until the first batch of the season, I didn't find it to be quite that. Overall I was pretty impressed though, very original and worth a try."
"I'd definitely drink this one again. And again."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability is good, this is a nice Winter Warmer (Wasn't it in under that style category in the past? Now an American Strong Ale?) and one I'll definitely pick up each year."
"Good winter warmer. Another fine beer from Great Divide."
"I'm very fond of this brew; it's a deceptively strong perennial favorite. A little too aggressive in flavor to have more than one at a sitting, but a lovely sipping beer for cold nights like tonight."
"The beer pours a hazy orange amber with a thin head that settles into a ring for the duration. The smell is rich and fruity with a backbone of dark malt. There are aromas of dark fruit, spicy hops, and some alcohol. The taste is surprisingly dry with restrained malt, some bitter orange, pronounced hops, and almost a bourbon flavor. The finish is almost like braised beef in its meatiness- maybe a little licorice there as well. The mouthfeel is very dry and even a little woody. Very much an after dinner sipper- no sweetness, but it hits the spot like a cognac."
"Not for newbies, that's for sure."
"Deep ruby color with a tannish head that goes quickly. Quite clear. Smells spicy and sweet, with a pretty big bang of chocolate and sweet maltyness. Tastes is full of chocolate and a bitter hint of coffee. Some smokyness comes through. Not too sweet, not too bitter. Mouthfeel is chewy, a tad bit thin. Overall this is a pretty drinkable brew, not quite dessert, but close to it. And the alcohol content is extremely sneaky. Another good one from great divide."
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle that was bottled in March 2006. Pours a clear ruby red/brown with a thin white head. Very little retention - a tiny bit of sediment. Bold aromas of dark toasted malt, nuts, caramel, alcohol. The flavors center on the savory character of the malt, nuts, some dark chocolate, twinge of alcohol, balanced nicely with a lightly-hopped finish. Mouthfeel is moderately thick, perfect for a good Strong Ale. A very warm, inviting beer. Lovely to drink. Highly recommended."
"Overall a tasty and very quaffable strong ale. A solid winter brew for sure."
"D- in my opinion, i think that this beer is amazing. it brought flavors to my palate that i have never tasted before from a beer, and for me it was real esy to drink, but i don't think that it will be for everyone. this beer seems to be for the true fans of strong, winter craft beers."
"D- It is good. A bit to coffee flavor left in the aftertaste for me but the more you drink the bitterness and hop flavor build up and help block it so it's not as strong. The carbonation is a bit high for this beer IMO. Other than those few things it is a nice solid brew."
"Pours deep ruby-amber in color, and produces a very respectable, very promising sticky tan head. While always a consistent brew, Hibernation shows plenty of variety in the nose each year given the hop availability, and yet it has resisted becoming overly-hoppy as has been the trend for many brewers. Plenty of zip to the aromatic hops used, and if you were to pour it side by side with a Full Sale Amber a newcomer to craft ales wouldn't make the connection until the alcohol kicked in. Notes of toffee, citrus, and fruitcake / fresh bread. Roasty malt notes are also a highlight, and there's some of the oily viscosity I appreciate in a wee heavy. Finish is clean and farily dry, with a touch of rum aromatics toward the end. A substantial, warming brew at 8.1% ABV, and the one brew from GD that I really missed when we couldn't get 'em for a couple of years once way back when. A great beer to stock in the cellar for a year or three."
"D - I can definatly feel the effects of the higher ABV after just a couple of these. This is not a beer for drinking in mass quantities."
"Medium to full bodied mouthfeel. Slight warming effect form the alcohol, but the drinkability is pretty easy. A wonderful beer. Certainly a nice beer to enjoy on this rainy Sunday, about 50 degrees (which is way below the record breaking 75 degrees we experienced yesterday). I am not sure how age will change this one as it seems pretty good right now. I have extras and will revisit this for two to three years to come."
"Pours a dark amber with a light tan head. Good lacing persists. Smells rich - chocolate brownies, fruity hops, and a bit of brandy. Taste is...wow. A lot going on here. Hop-citrus, a cornicopia of fruits, sweet bread, caramel, chocolate, and rum-raisins. Good stuff. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, but not too thick. Very drinkable, especially for an American Strong Ale. I am impressed."
"Verdict: One of the better seasonal winter ales around. Satisfying."
"6-1-03-Unique chocolate aroma and taste...not sweet or heavy, but more like wintergreen chocolates...very interesting robust strong ale...hops balance but don't overwhelm. This one will warm you up...excellent strong ale.."
"Clear, dark amber body with a small, dense cap of light khaki head. Rich caramel and toffee aroma has a toasted edge to it with a hint of rummy fruit. Strong, astringent hop resins and slight alcohol as well. Sweetish, rich, chewy caramel flavors mix with ripened fruit and sherry. Bracing hop bitterness breaks up the malt party. Numbing, herbal, and resinous, with a slight astringency to it. Maybe some clove and pepper in here too. Doesn't blend well with the whiskey/caramel/toffee notes that come back in the warming finish. Medium-bodied, with a sticky feel and dryer finish. Aftertaste is a bit unpleasant. Not bad, but just not the right malt and hop and spice mix for this human's taste buds."
"Poured medium brown with golden highlights. Actually looks like iced tea to me. White head fades quick. Intersting smell of hazelnut coffee or marzipan. Malted milk ball smell or tootsie rolls in there too. Taste follows the nose, but smell in my opinion is better and more intriguing. Light and hoppy bitter taste and finishes kind of sweet. Medium to light creamy mouthfeel. Moderate drinkability but not my favorite of this style."
"d - this has really mellowed after i thought it was a little hot fresh. this beer is probably best after 1 year of aging."
"Great flavors that are very balanced with one another. A well crafted Old Ale, wonderful to sip on a cold January night."
"2006. Pours dark amber to brown, fairly clear, with a small tan head that fades away quickly. Initial aroma is a roasty and smokiness, maybe a little tobacco, and a sweet malty berry smell that mixes with an alcohol aroma. Initial taste is a nice hoppiness, some piney hoppiness followed by a good size dose of smokey, new leather and burnt rubber. Alcohol is well balanced and makes only a small appearance in a warmth at the finish. Medium in body, low amount of carbonation, and a nice hoppy, puckering dryness in the finish. I enjoyed the good dose of hoppiness and although the smokey flavor was quite strong I'm interested to see if a little age might allow the smoke to become more dominant through from start to finish. A good cold weather beer."
"A severe disappointment. I expected something more than this beer delivered like taste. This is probably a great crossover beer but I simply require more taste from a beer in the strong ale classification."
"Pours a dark clear ruby red with a giant tan foamy head. A very impressive looking beer with great head retention and lacing. The smell is a spicey ""bisquity"" aroma that's not too overpowering. The taste is full of sweet malt, alcohol, and a creamy ""bisquity' flavor. Chocolate, nutmeg,and cinnamon are also in here making it a real Christmas beer. The m/f is medium with all flavors mixing well. A damn good Winter beer."
"Great brew with nice complex taste. Very well balanced and smooth, this one will help keep you warm as well. Feels like I put on a pair of long johns!"
"Cheers!"
"Very nice seasonal that I'll surely be on the lookout for in the future!"
"The mouthfeel is nice and full bodied, complements the complexity of the malt character and makes this a winter favorite of mine. The alcohol level and thicker mouthfeel make me feel like this isn't something I would drink a few of in row, but one at a time is very good."
"This beer poured a nice, dark yet shiny amber with a strong, thick head. The smell is outstanding with a very strong explosion of malt and floral hops. Exceptional. The taste is also very well-composed with a nice thickness of malts, hops, with dry bitterness and countless complexities. A balanced mouthfeel with, if anything, a lower carbonation. This isn't the most drinkable beer, yet you may want to have more than one to catch the complexities and levels that it offers."
"Slainte!"
"Very rich and luxuriant mouthfeel. Very warming and a good choice for cold winter nights."
"Very nice beer. Perfect for a cold night. Big but not overwhelming. Not so big that you feel compeled to sip and savor instead of drink it. But also complex and flavorful to warrant a savoring experience if you want."
"The drinkability is very good, a great brew all around. No flaws detected. Prosit MK"
"Alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering. Nice brew"
"a fantastic beer. truly a special treat this time of year."
"Tried this one again after letting a bottle of the 2006 in the fridge for about six months. This time I poured it into a pint glass. The complexity is still there, with a smooth feel that makes this beer incredibly drinkable. I wish I had another bottle to try another six months from now."
"Overall, quite wonderful. A hell of a winter warmer, just don't get too close to the fire. Had some characteristics of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale or a Quad. Happy to drink many more, just have to do it in multiple sittings. A session beer this ain't!"
"12oz bottle (dated 2006) purchased in a 6-pack from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a deep copper with a somewhat large head and a lot of carbonation. Strong and pleasant aroma of malt and hops. First taste is rather heavy and sweet with a taste of molasses. The alcohol is noticeable. The taste continues to be heavy and lingers long in the mouth. Took a while to warm up to (or perhaps it just took a while to warm me up!). An interesting beer, but not my favourite style."
"I've been wanting to try this beer for a while now, and thanks to a friend who picked some up for me while in Colorado, I finally had the chance. Needless to say I was not disappointed."
"Pours a dark coffeee color brown, with a thick, rich cream color head, that laced the whole class. Great Looking for sure.Smell was hops, but alot of roasted caramel smells, nutty as well. Smells like a winter ale should. Taste was umm, nuts and caramel, with a hop finish. Very well rounded. Just the right amount of carbonation on the way down. This is a good beer. Full of flavor, and feels like a meal. You will not be dissapointed with this one!"
"The mouth is complex and full, with good action on all points of the palate. Despite the high ABV and density, it's a rather quaffable brew. Get it while it's still around."
"D - one of the tastiest winter brews out there, IMHO. Give this one a try for sure. Another solid offering from Great Divide."
"Systembolaget in Sweden is selling Hibernation Ale for the Christmas season, 2006. It poured with a nice red-brown color with quicly disappearing foam. The smell was of taffy, cloves and yeast, almost smokey. The taste was dominated by alcohol and I got that dry wheat flour taste on my tongue. There was also sweet caramel, licorice and grapefruit. The after taste was bitter, pinching the back of my jaws. All and all it was a good, warming winter beer with a complex taste."
"Hands down my favorite. This was my 5th and I loved each one. If you come across a Hibernation pick it up. Mmmm!"
"D: very drinkable considering the alcohol content. I could drink a lot of these when it's cold outside, something about the cold weather..."
"Drinkable, but disappointing. Not quite sure what they were going for with this one, they could have done better...."
"It reminds me of a thin barleywine."
" A very good winter brew here."
"Great beer."
"Pours a clear dark amber/brown with a nice off white head that laces very nicely. Smells of chocolate, slight toffee, nuts. Taste is the same as the smell. Very nice mild chocolate notes at first, mild hop presence. This is mostly about the malts and it is done very nicely. This warms really well, the chocolate comes out more, the carbonation mellows out and the whole thing is much smoother. Let it warm in the glass to get the experience of how it changes."
"D: A tasty winter seasonal. I'd recommend this one and will look forward to having it again."
"A very drinkable beer for the cold months. Although, high in alcohol, the alcohol is well hidden and non offending. A sixer of this over the holiday season would be a welcome treat."
"The mouthfeel was thick and sticky,by no means a session brew,still tasty and quite enjoyable. A good beer for a cold winter night,a warming sensation at the very end,feeling the alcohol."
"Overall a fine chewy rib-sticking ale from Colorado. I really dig how the hop component springs a trap on your taste buds following the aroma, never saw them coming. A bit heavy handed but like a gentle giant. Well balanced for such a malty beer. Very good indeed."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a full body with a slightly oily texture. The slow carbonation helps break some of the oilyness up. This is a dam fine seasonal strong ale. This wouldnt be a good sessionable beer for many beer drinkers at 8%. Being a 220 pound man I find this nearing sessionable. I look forward to a few more of these this year."
"This is an outstanding beer. Nice craggy three finger head. Smells of fruity esthers on the nose. Has awesome lacing down the glass and mega hops to balance this sucker out. Not for the weary, I can tell you that. Reasonably priced and a tremendous beer, just stay outta the car after consuming a couple of these."
"I guess I'm complaining about too much of a good thing. I would proudly serve this to any beer snob friend and I would certainly never refuse one of these (unless I had to drive somewhere)!"
"this is a great beer on par with the yeti. thumbs up!"
"The bottle cap proclaims 'Great Minds Drink Alike'. Well in this case, apparantly not."
"D- a bit to alcoholic and full bodied to have too many of but for such a strong beer with such a deep flavor and such a high ABV still goes down very easily, will definitely be looking for this one in the years to come"
"This is a very tasty beer, fairly complex and very nice for a cold day."
"Pours a nice amber brown. Thin tan head, good rentention, and lacing. Smell is of roasted chocolate malts, with a bit of hops. Body is medium,with some carbionation. Taste is malted up front.Sweet fruit combine with a roasted nut flavor. Hops in the finish make for a good experience!"
"Drinkability: a superb winter ale everyone should try."
"Pours from the 12oz bottle a pretty chestnut color with deep golden highlights when held up to the light. Head is a half-inch or so of creamy tan goodness that recedes to a thin halo after a couple of minutes. Roasty aroma indicates a blend of mostly caramel and a touch of dark malt, with notes of mocha and peat smoke. Palate is mostly roasted malt, with a touch of caramel and brown sugar sweetness up front. Mid-palate the mildly bitter hops come out a bit, leaving on a slightly dry, warming finish with a good amount of alcohol. Body is a bit rich and fairly well-rounded. Overall, a pleasant winter ale that really does the trick on a cold night."
"Overall, I was hoping for an old ale, not an overgrown brown ale. I'm really freakin' disappointed."
"Medium bodied with a bit of an oily texture to it. Nice carbonation to keep it balanced. Only giving it low marks on drinkability due to the alcohol presence."
"Very smooth and creamy in the mouth. A nicely balanced beer. Watch out for these, they could be dangerous. I could definitely kick back a few."
"Pours a rich thick carmel colored head that slowly calms to tight laced bubbles. Beer clings to glass like a fine wine. Scent of caramel and toffee with a hint of chocolate goodness.Smell of alchohol is present but not overbarring and just right for this winter warmer. This is a great beer for after dinner or just watching the game. Be easy with this one though with its 8.1%abv you'll be doing snow angels in your underware before you know it!"
"Drinkability: Truly, this beer is an enjoyable malt-forward ale and a solid winter release."
"I don't know what to think about this one overall. It's got flavour but the mouthfeel turned me off a bit, moreso than I actually expected. It's still pretty good stuff overall, just not as good as expected."
"it looked like it was going to be so good up front.. then.. oh well."
"Pours reddish brown, kind of a darker shade. Great head retention, creamy tan head. Malty aroma with lots of hops. This beer leaves some stickiness on my lips. This is very malty with some fruitiness and hop flavor/bitterness. Some roastiness and faint noticeable alcohol. Medium bodied. This is quite drinkable for the ABV."
"2006 bottling. Poured a pretty reddish amber color with a 1/4 inch light tan head that left some lacing on the glass. Aroma was malty and caramelly with a slight nutty smell in the nose. Taste was roasted malts up front with some smoky notes and almond flavors mixed in. The finish had a light hop bitterness along with some burnt grain. Mouthfeel was medium on the palate. Alcohol was present but not overly so. This brew reminds me more of a Scotch ale due to the smoky character. A pretty solid offering and one that I believe would benefit from some cellaring. My next sampling will be a 2004 bottle that I've been holding on to."
"Another great beer from Great Divide, though it's probably my least favorite of their ""top-tier"" brews. A good example of the syle and a great beer for a cool fall or cold winter night when you want something a little different than a stout with its great warming sensation."
"I'll revisit this one in a few months, and then again next year"
"D: Good. This beer has things that I like to see in winter beers....but its a fine line. Most winter beers make the mistake of going too over the top in one direction and forget to rebalance the flavors. This one has some lingering flavors that can and will be cloying after one bottle. I wouldn't choose to open a second immediately afterwards. All in all I enjoyed this beer though."
"Fantastic! I do see how this would be a good winter holiday beer."
"This brew should be about 10% abv, I can notice the alcohol trying to work through the malts and put me in hibernation mode. More than one could do it. (see its 8%) so the alcohol is still kinda hot on this 2005 bottled version."
"Pours a dark opaque coppery brown with an off-white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smell is very sweet with hints of fruit and alcohol. Taste is sweet with a roasted earthy bitterness. There are notes of dark fruit with some citrusy hops and alcohol coming in in the finish. Medium to full bodied and lightly carbonated. Not extremely drinkable but pretty tastey stuff."
"Pulled this out of my ""cellar"" to give it a taste at 6 months. A very solid beer from a good brewery."
"This brew pours medium to dark in color. The alcohol content is very apparent. The flavor is full bodied with a nice balance of hop and malts. Never a disappointment and a wonderful winter brew for those cold northern winter nights."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin but the drinkability is quite good, almost too good."
"Had another one of these last night (10/26/06). Now has distinctive oak flavor and aroma. Was very surprised. This is now much better than when it was fresh."
"Tasty, well-spiced unique winter warmer. Without an x-mas and iverally snowy picture on the front. Body is a bit light, and a nice toastiness, all making it more drinkable. Carmel, nicely moderatley hopped. Must have again. This is 2005. Alcohol hammers by the finish."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. It pours an unfiltered dark maroon/brown that looks blood-red when held to the light. There's some sediment at the bottom and it builds a half-inch khaki head that sticks fairly well and retains a collar throughout, leaving some lacing. The aroma is big on roasted/chocolate malts, and there's a hefty dose of citric (orange?) hops to balance. Near the end I find notes of pear, black cherry, and some other kinda berry. The flavor is very much the same, with chocolate, roasted, nutty, and caramel malts predominating, but the hops lend a medium bitterness and green/citric/minty/piney qualities, and there are hints of dark fruits. It has a medium to thick body that is very smooth and creamy, and doesn't let you know how strong the beer is. Overall this is a very well made beer that is complex, yet quite drinkable. I gotta get more than a single bottle next time to see what the cellar will do to it."
"I'm all about this brew. Damn tasty, well balanced, but very bold. Alcohol is hidden well, and that makes for a supremely enjoyable beer."
"D - Superb drinkability. Great nightcap."
"This beer was served in a Chimay chalice. It was a color that reminded me of red wine. There was little head. The smell was fruity with some hop notes. The taste was very hoppy and semi-sweet. There was an alcohol presence in the mouthfeel. You know you are drinking a big beer. The drinkability is good on this beer, just take it easy. I could session this beer only if the session was real short."
"Pours a slightly hazy, deep reddish-copper with a small, off-white, creamy head that quickly diminishes to a thin film. Good lacing. The smell is... wow... sweet like candy. In fact, it actually smells kind of lot like a tootsie roll, I kid you not. Malts and alcohol esters duke it out for top billing with a light hops presence in one corner, but malts are kicking arse with the sweetness in their corner. The sweetness is almost a little too much... almost. The flavor is almost as malt dominant as the nose suggests, with flavors of chocolate, dark bread and toffee. The hops come out nicely on the finish adding a light bitterness and balance. It has a full body, syrupy texture, and moderate carbonation. This is one hell of a desert beer, and if thats what youre looking for, this one is nicely done. Not very sessionable if thats what youre going for, but then again, its a barleywine, so if youre looking for a sessionable barleywine, thats kind a of contradiction right there."
"A revisit of a fresh 2010 bottling in 12/10 shows much of the same, although the younger beer was much better looking, with a clear color and loads of lacing"
"A deliciously well-balanced strong ale. This could be the only reason I look forward to next November."
"I bought this bottle in early 2005 or late 2004 and it has been sitting in my cellar aging away until this weekend. The beer poured a nice deep brown, almost black color with no light getting through. There was a medium tan head with big bubbles and good lacing. The aroma was a good mix of hops and definite chocolate and coffee notes. The taste was of bold coffee and chocolate and for a non-coffee drinker, this was a very enjoyable beer. The coffee taste is not overpowering and mixes well with the other tastes. Although the abv is over 8%, I find this beer bery drinkable but a bit heavy so I would not find myself drinking more than a few on any given night."
"Mouthfeel- This beer relaxed my palate. The strong hops had some comforting help with the coffee. A great nightcap beer. Wouldn't want to share with food."
"This was definitely the best beer I tried last noight. Man, it's strong but not overpowing with alcohol smell or taste. Great balance of yummy malts and hops, nice dark bronze and little head. Notes of fruit and caramel. At 8.8%, it is definitely not a session beer but easy enough to finish. Worth a go around, againa and again."
"Tired of the spiced ales (I like em, but not everyone does) or amber ales masquerading as winter warmers? Then snag some of this, you'll be glad you did. Robust like a ww should be, but its not gonna knock you out in 1 glass."
"If this beer could talk it'd say, ""Have a happy winter."""
"Interesting to note that I recall this beer as being a drainpour when fresh. After consulting my previous review, which sadly, is about to be deleted, I can say this beer mellowed and changed significantly in aging. It has obviously benefitted a great deal from a few years in the bottle. I would like to taste a 4 or 5 year old bottle, to see if things finally come together."
"Drinkability and Overall: Another good brew from Great Divide, but not one of their best. The mouthfeel is killing all the fun of drinking this for me. Oh well, at least worth a try."
"This brew is ultimately very rich while at the same time quite smooth. Interesting hop presence that is surprisingly well balanced with the toasty malts. A myriad of chocolate and fruity malts are evident. Mouthfeel is sticky and resinous, but not too overbearing. In short an aggressive well crafted brew that is not for the meek. Cheers"
"12 oz. 2005 vintage poured into an oversized wine goblet. Glassy mahogany with garnet highlights and a creamy but reclusive beige head. Fruity caramel liquer aroma, like date sugared apples doused in Frangelico but not as nutty. First sip is not as sweet as expected; earthy hops right up front. Sweet almond and black walnut creaminess on the follow-through. Tongue-numbing alcohol buzz -- not surprising at 8.1%. Slick mouthfeel, medium body. It just occurred to me that this would pair quite nicely with a robust Cuban cigar -- it's not so spicy with hops that it would wreck your tongue and not so sweet that the cigar would taste gross. There's an almost smoky nuttiness to this beer that is unlike anything I've tasted before. So there's that if you want to try this one fresh. 10 months in the cellar would mellow this out, probably, and turn it into more of a solitary sipper. When I finish my Ph.D. and start looking for jobs, I'll pay particular attention to openings in Colorado. Great Divide Brewing Co. plays more than a small role in this inclination."
"Very good stuff - yet another winter warmer ('strong ale') to look forward to. Yet another well crafted beer from Great Divide. [Thanks to warriorsoul for this tasty treat]"
"Dont turn it down."
"overall quite tasty, but i don't think you'd want to drink several as it's a bit heavy to me. it also felt like more than 8.1%, which could also be a problem for drinking more than one."
"Good body and frothy texture overall. A good flavor and finishes warm but so easy to drink. I guess you can go to sleep now, just dont spill your beer."
"D - Drinkable. This is a very nice brew from Great Divide, the alcohol content is hidden pretty well. Very tasty and would buy again and recommend to people."
"Pours a ruby red, medium off white head, some nice lace and good retention. Smell is caramel, floral hops, chocolate, toffee, and figs, spectacular. Taste is caramel/toffee, dates, chocolate and coffee, some floral and vanilla in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Fantastic ale for the winter, would drink this all day. Thanks DrJay!"
"2005. Poured out to a auburn orange color with a short lived head that calmed to a thin layer of white-ish tan foam over the beer. Lower carboantion, with some lacing. Aromas were very pronounced, with a strong plum and dark fruit notes. Flavors were way out of whack... maybe this should've been aged longer. Some dark fruits, stale and sour malt. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, slightly chewy. Fair drinkability at best. I don't think i'll be revisiting this one..."
"Rummy, toffee, and warmly sweet, the ale is mid-full but heightened because of the lingering chocolate, alcohol, and sweetness. It nearly reaches semi-dry stature, but its maltiness can't help it- its a malty-dry closure."
"Although this beer isn't anything exceptional when you examine it closely, it's scary drinkable for its ABV; I was surprised how fast my glass disappeared. Not quite what I'm looking for in a strong beer, but it may be right up your alley, though."
"Hibernation poured a rusty red with an overal appearance of brown. Nice head with a lacy finish. Bubbles clinging to the side of the glass leaves me to think it is a heavy carbonated beer, however, the carbonation is a very nice feel, not overpowering at all. As I take my first sip a hint of sweetness touches the tip of my tongue and rounds out to a hop finish. Finishes strong with a slightly bitter finish, but definitely not overpowering. This is a very drinkable beer that goes down very smooth. I could easily drink 3 or 4 of these, but I would probably have to have my wife bring a pillow and blanket on whatever floor I passed out on!"
"Cheers2Beers"
"Clear chestnut with a thin, rocky, tan head that quickly reduced to a ring. Lots of spotty lace. Toffee, chocolate, figs, floral and light grapefruit hoppiness in the aroma. Quite nice, not overdone. Moderate hop bitterness. Heavy toffee/malt flavour with nut and chocolate notes towards the finish. Lingering caramel and citrus hop character. Good carbonation and creamy texture, medium body. Quite a nice beer and another winner from Great Divide."
"The colour is a cloudy brown, not that dark really, and it starts out with a decent cap of foam with some retention. It almost looks like an IPA that is very murky. The smell is very strong with a mix of chocolaty malt aromas and a scent of grassy hops. Sweet malt flavors prevail with hints of chocolate, and caramel, followed by just enough hop bitterness to balance it out. It has a medium thickness and decent carbonation. A very drinkable beer as the high alcohol disguises itself well behind the tasty malt flavors. Too bad this is only a seasonal..."
"For the abv, this beer is dangerously drinkable... absolutely wonderful beer... another winner from Great Divide."
"Poured out a clear ruby color with a creamy, frothy, tan head. Smells of earth, fruit, and herbs. I wish the aromas would come out at me more. Flavors of chocolate, berries, and smoky, roasted malt. Mouthfeel is rich and full without getting to the point of being too thick. The richness of this beer makes it an excellent nightcap, but I imagine it'd be hard to put away more than two of these in a night. Another great beer from Great Divide."
"Overall, solid but nothing that special either."
"Hibernation is lightly carbonated and not too thick on the palate, resulting in a smooth, pleasant drinking experience. Great Divide further gets points for crafting a winter seasonal that's more than a brown ale loaded with ""holiday"" spices. Another winner from Great Divide."
"Pours a deep, dark ruby/mahogany color with a fluffy tan head. Nose is potent and earthy - peat, oak, wet hops and herbs. Taste is caramel malt sweet with notes of wet tobacco and nuttiness and port - lots of barleywine in this stong ale. I was expecting more winter wamer, but was pleasantly surprised by this beer's unique earthy character. Hides the alcohol exquisitely as well. Seek it out if you can still find it."
"Crisp, with a little tang from the hops, a little bit from the coffee. A very nice brew."
"A clean dark brown beer with ruby highlights. Has a nice creamy dark beige head and good lace. There is a sweet nutty malt aroma with hints of chocolate and coffee and a bit of spicey hops in the background. The flavor starts with a bit of sweet chocolate on the tip of the tongue. Followed by a roasted malt bitterness at the back with a quick sharp hop nip to dry out the finish before the tummy warming effect kicks in. Yum."
"D- This beer has some nice big flavors that I think will really smooth out yet keep there complexity with some time."
"Drinkability: Possibly suffers from the often overwhelming sweetness. This is surely not a session brew by design. This feels like a one and a half india pale ale. Missing hops that would offset some of the cloying aspects. Alas, it is only just a nondescript strong ale. Fair to good."
"Bitter hoppiness hits you right away but balances out with some roasted sweet malts and very mild fruits. Alcohol taste but not very overwhelming. Warming, with little carbonation. Very pleasant and very drinkable."
"12oz bottle, 2005 vintage. Pours a dark tan to red hue and makes a thin off white head. Aroma is very rich with sweet malts, loads of medium roast caramel, and a hint of flowery hops. Flavor starts with a spiced bitterness on the tongue, strong complex malted backbone and assertive hop flavor, I seem to taste quite a bit of chinook. Finish is bitter chinook hops. Medium bodied, light cabonation goes down creamy and gently coats the palate, finishes dry. Not bad, a nice winter brew."
"Mouth feel is full bodied and a bit syrupy. The carbonation is low."
"cheers..."
"Poured a dark carmel color. One inch head. Nutty chocolate notes in the nose. Can definitely taste the 8.1% ABV. Strong hops are balance by complex maltiness. I think I taste some butterscotch. This is certainly a celbratory seasonal. Another excellent bottle from Great Divide. The label is superb. Happy Holidays!!!"
"A really nice holiday beer. Lots of spices and hops. Just the way a holiday beer should be. One flavor I percieved that I don't see in too many beers was pepper. Gave the beer a nice spicy note. Color was a deep dark brown. Good head retention. I am going to buy some bottles of it and lay it down as I think it will be a good beer to age."
"Malt dominates the taste here. While I am sure there are plenty of hops in the brew they are dominated by a great rich malt flavour which seems to grow and grow in the mouth before gradually fading away. This feels creamy and tastes sweet with the faintest hint of chocolate."
"Crystal clear mohagony body. Half inch white head on top which didn't stay around for too long. Aroma is caramel sweet with some chocolaty hints. A bit of dark fruit and floral hints with a touch of alcohol aroma, not much though. Taste is a unique blend of flavors. Comes across initially like an IPA with a sweet floral flavored hops and a touch of bitterness. Finishes with bits of chocolate. Alcohol is well hidden in the flavor. Mouthfeel is fairly full and coats well. Drinkability is very good. This is a super balanced brew that goes down easy. A nice dose of hops and some malts to round it out. Very nice."
"Overall it's good, but it's not quite as good as I was expecting from one of my favorite micro brewers. I probably won't bother to seek it out again, but that is not to say it is bad... all I'm saying is that if this was available on the shelf, you could be damn near certain that the Yeti is also available. This was good, but almost nothing beats a Yeti during the cold winter nights."
"I'm excited to cellar a few bottles of this and see where it goes in the next couple of months (or longer). GD brews a small get-it-if-you-can-find-it batch of this each year, and I feel lucky to have found a sixer right here in Leadville. Highly recommended."
"Tastes deeply malty, with spices and a warm, subtle undertone from the alcohol. Well balanced, yet robust. There is perhaps some chocolate undertones toward in the middle. Body is smooth and silky, a very drinkable beer."
"2005 Edition Appearance: Dark ruby hue with an off white tan head fine bubbles leaves smooth layers of uneven lacing with each sip. Aroma: Rich blend of piney hops warming alcohol with bready spiced malt layers mixed with a touch of tart cherries and citrus scented hops. Taste: Doughy malt base is sugary but the big hop addition balances the flavor out so that hops have at least one up on the malt profile here. Up front strong bitterness and slightly rough pine and alcohol soaked fruit including cherries and citrus with a touch of chocolate and spices thrown in the mix very nice. Mouthfeel: Medium body lighter carbonation with a slight syrupy texture. Drinkability: Really good English style Old ale another winner from Great Divide."
"This beer pours a dark brown and leaves a sticky beige lace that sticks to the side of the glass. This beer smells of honey, brown sugar, citrus rinds, and lemon grass. As I taste this beer the bitterness from the hops and a slight sweetness from the caramel malt comes out on the palate. I also get a slight aftertaste of the alcohal that lingers on the palate but is really hidden with the sweetness of the beer. Overall this is pretty good beer one that is a def winter time sipper."
"2005 bottling. Pours a half finger of caramel light brown head over a ruby-edged brown liquid. Crystal clear and shining like a gem. Wow, this is a gorgeous looking beer. Smells cocoa and dry bis-quick powder. Woody and dried fall oak leaves. Tastes dry cocoa, dry leaves, with a buried alcohol flavor. Not so much alcohol sting as alcohol flavor. Some rough hop edge, but hidden by the strength of the chocolate. Biscuit malt dryness and a touch of roast. Nearing the bottom of the glass, the alcohol is standing strong and has developed some sting. Thick mouthfeel that's creamy and somewhat dextrinous. Overall, this is an enjoyable winter warmer. The flavors just don't quite meld to make it a savoring experience. I may pick up some bottles so I can age them a couple years. I think some of the alcohol heat would settle and the flavors could form some kind of union."
"The mouthfeel is full, and it has an almost-puckering finish. The drinkability is nice especially considering the 8.1% abv. A nice session beer."
"Bottled on 11/19/2009, ever so slightly less than a year old. Pours a slightly hazy mahogany color with a thin tan head that retains OK. The aroma has a ton of sweet malts initially (notes of caramel, bourbon, toffee, turbinado sugar) along with some piney and citrusy hops in the background, along with some cocoa, pecans and almonds, dark fruits and some alcohol. The flavor has some citrusy and piney hops upfront (but more muted compared to when fresh), along with caramel and toffee, rum cake, dark fruits, caramelized pecans, and some alcohol The mouthfeel is really smooth and drinkability is much improved. I'm really digging this with a year on it, the hops have faded and the malts come to the forefront and the alcohol has really mellowed...I've got another bottle I'll leave alone for a year or so to see how this one matures further."
"drinkability: only a few of these"
"This beer is actually quite nice, not very many breweries do a English style Old Ales. The malt character is refreshingly unhoppy, and makes for a great sipping beer. This will age pretty well, and I think I will have to pick up a couple bottles for next years holiday season."
"big, but balanced"
"Deep brown very clear in color with orange highlights. It was topped by a thick tan colored head that recedes quickly. The aroma is dominated by sweet, dark malt. Mild citrus (orange) and spice on the finish. The taste has more of the malt up front, toffee, figs. The hops come out mid-flavor, nice citrus, grass, a little hop flower. The spice wakes up on the finish. Hard to characterize. I think there is some coriander and all-spice. What a great mouth feel. Ive only had this full rich mouth feel in Imperial Stouts and Dubbles. Very nice, and very drinkable."
"Taste is malt, hops, alcohol, smoke, molasses and a piney/floral combination. Smooth and full-bodied with a nice warming coming in slowly at the end. A good brew but could be better."
"Very round and chewy. Nice carbonation level. Refreshing for a beer with such a big malt character but also warming. A very nice offering."
"I have to say this beer is highly drinkable. My head told me to sip it, but my mouth told me to gulp it. thats gotta mean something. I will cellar i think 2 of them to see what happens, but i think they are quite drinkable fresh."
"Deep reddish brown color was almost an exact match for the label on this 12 oz. longneck bottle. The body was clear, and the head creamy, one finger thick, and beige in color, and lots of lace, too. The earthy sweet aroma was that of chocolate, hazelnuts, and toffee, all standard fare for a Strong or Old Ale. The taste was sweet and mellow, with a brown sugar and vanilla flavor up front, a hint of mocha, which was followed by a nutty character. The hops were more noticeable with the classic Great Divide flair, and added an extra layer of citric and leafy complexity. The beer was velvety smooth in texture with a lingering faintly woody aftertaste. Well crafted beer that felt more vigorously drinkable than the other stodgy examples of this style."
"Clear dark amber with a creamy head that laces well. Smells like chocolate covered raspberries aboard a wave of caramel malts. Cigarettes too. Flavor has toffee with some ash and alcohol. The caramel maltiness is annoying in that plastic-bodied way that feels so fake. Finish is a little like a sugary cigarette butt. Needs some more bitterness. Plastic-coated big body really ruins this beer for me, which is too bad considering that I was digging the aromas and flavors."
"I must say that I have very mixed feelings about this one. I poured a very red colour with a nice fluffly off white head with decent head retention. Nice lacing. Looked fantastic. The smell was nice with a bit of malt and loaded with hops. Not my cup of tea, but still I thought it had a pleasant smell, hoppy or not. The taste? If you are a hop fanatic, then I highly recommend you try this of out. I am not a hop fanatic, so I'll finish this 6 pack off and never ever buy this again. Very very hoppy. Bitterly so, perhaps ""perfume like"". The only thing I did enjoy about the taste was that it seemed to me to have a bit of a toasted malt-like finish. Don't know if that is indeed what I am tasting, but that is the only way I can describe it. The mouth feel was quite smooth and easy to drink with little carbonation, and at 8.0+abv, they did a nice job concealing the alcohol. Overall, this was okay I suppose, but this style is just not for me. I'll take a heavy milk stout, thanks."
"Somewhat muddied amber color. Decent head at first. Big slick, malty aroma. Toffee and resiny aroma. Malty flavor upfront-oak, some vanilla. Quite earthy. Great body. Just a big ole hunk of malty goodness. A great beer. The whole package is really great. Almost too drinkable for my own good. Get some."
"Average - 4.40"
"Pours a rich crimson color with a creamy off white head that stays put thru out the duration of drinking it,deep caramel aromas along with some milk chocolate quite sweet.Absolutely sublime creamy mouthfeel just glides down smooth,flavors of caramel and brown suger hit ya up front but there is a decent dryness midway keeping it from getting to sweet.I wouldnt say earthy maybey more herbal in the finish,its quite heavy a one or two and done for me.This is a doozy a great winter beer,it would real warm ya up,not that I need that down here in NC."
"Nice mouth that approaches full but backs off at the right time. Slight residual oils, but they are not unwelcome. Despite the abv, this is quite drinkable in light of it's merits."
"Hibernation Ale is a cloudy, caramel colored brew with a minimal head that quickly fades. Big notes of chocolate rise from the glass, with just hints of the 8.1% ABV. Taste is also quite chocolately, but there's a strange hop flavor providing dissonance, almost like fresh parsley. Finishes with some hop bittering. Mouthfeel is very thick. Overall, I was very pleased with how chocolatey this was, but the hops and the malt just don't mesh well. For the most part though, a fine strong ale, and it hides its alcohol quite well."
"Overall this is a very nice beer. Strong tasting and pleasant, with a good deal of substance. Impressive."
"A medium-brown color with cream colored head that remains thick and foamy for quite awhile. Great lacing is left behind once the head begins to dissipate. Aromas of malt, nuts, caramelized sugar are present. The taste is lovely with hop bitterness in every sip right upfront followed by an assertive malt finish. Additional flavors of apricots and plums become apparent as the beer warms. The finish is dry with a lingering sweetness leaving behind a warming alcohol sensation. Overall, this is a very enjoyable brew that I can see myself having by a fireplace in the dead of winter, perhaps in a ski lodge!"
"Taste: Thick with a combination of sweet, roasted, and chocolate malts. Like the aroma, the chocolate was strong. In the middle, medicinal cherry and an herbal hoppiness arose. The finish was a continuation of these, along with some spirit-like alcohol and a stronger sweetness."
" This beer is a lot better fresh like this than when I tried last year's batch with six months of age on it. Caramel malt, chocolate nut malt, and grassy, herbal, resiny hops. The mouthfeel is thick, a bit syrupy. This is a sipper. Big thanks to AlexJ for the trade."
"This brew pours a clear dark red color with a small white head that recedes quickly. The aroma is dark and malty. Chocolate, and caramel, with citrusy hops peaking through. It actually smells of warmth, as though it will keep you warm the whole winter. The taste is very balanced. Perhap, it is the most balance big beer I have had. The mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth, with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer worthy of its name."
"Hibernation Ale has held up well during its 2 years of... uh... hibernation. Like many strong ales, it doesn't fit neatly into any one category. It is an enjoyable sipper, though, and one that would be good to have around when the thermometer dips into the single digits. Thanks to prAna for the bottle, although he's probably forgotten this long ago trade (the first one I ever made)."
"An excellent, well-crafted winter beer."
"My local gets in the freshest of the fresh. I got this barely chilled from the delivery. Considering it has come half way across the country, it is remarkably fresh and is a deceivingly sweet treat."
"I wouldnt spend an entire night drinking this, but it is very unique and very tasty. Can Great Divide do anything wrong?"
"Solid."
"Usually I don't drink more than one bottle of the same beer at a time, and I decided to go back for another (which was a tough call since I only had two). Needless to say, I'll be hitting up the beer store quickly to stock up."
"My new goal is to get everything I can by Great Divide. And if you haven't noticed by my review, you should try to seek this out."
"Opinion: This is a very well crafted beer! I am a little surprised that the alcohol is only 8.1% because it adds some noticeable heat. I guess the fermentation was a little warm to bring out the fruity aromatics. It tastes like it is over 10% to me."
"12 ounce bottle. 04 version. Hazy dark brown with a large head. Brown sugar and chocolate aroma with dark fruits. Smells quite hoppy too. Dark malts with a caramel and toffee flavor. Some dark fruits and nuts. Hoppy in the finish. There are plenty of good flavors in this beer, but the flavors could meld together a little better. Full mouthfeel. The high alcohol takes away a little from the drinkability. This beer is pretty good, but there are plenty of better beers of the same style."
"Bottled in 2004. This is a garnet colored beauty. Minimal head and carbonation. Smell is coffee and alcohol-soaked dark fruitbread. Taste is a charming blend of coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, and alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is medium, with a firm body and a wonderful burn in the finish. Tasty and easy to quaff for the style."
"I also noted oxidation in my last review, but there was none here. Very nice!!!"
"So, as it goes, this brew is not fully impressionable but has that satisfyingly casual appeal that makes for a nice experience and keeps a favorably easy drinkability to its disposition worthy of Great Divides' reputation."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite/tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is perfect. It has a warm and rich malty scent that is sweet with crystal malts and toastey with roasted barley. The taste is good. It has an earthy, sweet, and toastey malt flavor that goes down smooth and finishes dry and warm. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It has awesome aroma and flavor; a great drinker."
"Dark caramel to orange hue, very foamy off-white film presents decent lacing as the norm wants with GD. Interesting caramel malt, earthy and slightly alcoholic. Vegetal and mellow hops blend in with ease. The aroma feels a bit soft. Its not trying to impress you, its well contained, woody, earthy, well rounded caramel and fruits, bready with a growing green hops bitterness. A bit watery toward the ending, but medium bodied and creamy besides. Unexceptional, but another respectable GC offering."
"Drinkability - doesn't taste as potent as it is. Not as flavorful as I'd hoped, the coffee and chocolate arrive too late for me. Still, not many 8% sippers are this drinkable."
"Notes: Still a little hot, nice hop bitterness, and tasty. Could use some aging, but its still tasty."
"This bottle is a little old, but it appears to have aged pretty well. I would like to try a fresh one, but this is the only time I have ever seen it at the local Spec's."
"2004 winter edition. Light shoe brown hue with some red wine highlights, bubbling tan head that creates a ¼ inch clasping ring. Fresh hops, caramel malts and some tender estery alcohol make the presence on the nose. First impressions are important, no? Creamy, big and bold  a chewy, full bodied explosion right from the first sip! Some caramelized sugars, rich dark roasted malts, coffee beans and mocha are all to be found. Oh so smooth and inviting, flavorings obviously increase with warming; cherries, vanilla beans and a smidge of hops grace the palate, chocolate and mint offerings come and go towards the finish. A true winter winner and a great catch, absolutely wonderful! Massive flavorings along with a true-tummy warming affect; perfect for winter nights, o.k. perfect for any night!"
"Not a beer I would cellar for a time, but I do prefer this beer with some age - like, say, around mid-summer or early fall. The large toasty wallop and dry cocoa notes calm some into a smoother malty beer. Regardless, a good English-styled Old ale and a seasonal to which I always look forward."
"Pours a hazy dark red with a decent creamy light brown head that leaves good lacing in my glass. Fruity dark cherry and plum aromas. Bready, nutty, chocolate-caramel and fruit flavors, full bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, alcohol well hidden, finishes with a pleasant bitterness, well done."
"2004 vintage. Hibernation is dark brown with a ruby glow in the light. Head is light brown; and nice and creamy. Pretty good lacings around the insides of my glass. The aroma is strongly malty. Chocolate and coffee smells are noted. A nice hop bite is also in the mix. Taste is fully malty with a nice touch of hops. Chocolate tastes are followed by that of coffee in the finish. An ester taste is noted too. Body is full and chewy. The 8.1% ABV is only noted by a warming feeling. This is another enjoyable beer by Great Divide, I've always enjoyed their brews that I've tried."
"Bottled in 2004. Chestnut color with ruby highlights. Thick tan creamy head, which stayed for a good period of time. Some patchy lace on the sides. Wonderful roasty aroma along with alcohol, and maybe some chocolate. Spices too. Caramel and toffee-like malt. Not very sweet. Robust. Big amount of spicy hops. Not too bitter, and somewhat smooth. Alcohol presence noticable. Medium to full body, low carbonation. This is a very solid strong or old ale. Probably ages fairly well."
"A big piney nose with the alcohol present. Starts lighter than the nose suggests, but kicks it up nicely. A big, hoppy, complex stew. Figs, toast, and pine flavors come through. The piney hops tend to dominate - but I like it! Just enough alcohol to ward off the cold. Very bitter finish. Nice job."
"This brew is a thick, swampy brown color, nice tan head topping her off. Sheets of lace follow it down. Big bad malt/hop/alcohol scent lets pussies know to keep away. Nice big chocolate/caramel malt front, back by a bitter hop twang. Some alcohol evident as the beer warms. Pretty sticky mouth. This is quite a tasty treat."
"Regarding specifics: Polished cherry wood, splippery on the glass, excellent on the palate, and quick on the wit. Short on aroma, but long on the finish. Mucho maltiness, great divide on the palate with appropriate hoppiness. I love what Great Divide does for me in the winter time. Check out their old Ruffian, too. After one sip this beer sits in the glass like a fine lady standing up and inviting you into the bedroom. You gonna enjoy that just once? Come again, I want it 6 times repeated at least. Get yourself a sixer too."
"Overall Impression: Great winter beer. Nice balance of alcohol and great mix of flavors. Probably would be great to age, but no way it will survive long enough in my house!"
"It is worth trying, but unless you really like correander (sierra nevada or anchor winters, for example) try to get only one. If you really like the correander, grabbing a 6 is recommended."
"Christmas is always reserved for only the best beers . As good a day as any to review this awesome ale my sister in Estes Park sent me. Pours dark mahogany brown with a creamy oatmeal-colored head. Aromas are caramel and chocolate malts, cinnamon, oak, and citrus and evergreen hops. A sip reveals a hearty, delicious brew worthy of Christmas day! Sweet malty flavors of butterscotch and oaky vanilla, leather, dates, and light holiday spice give way to a flash of grapefruit citrus and sprucey hop notes. Mediumish in body with a nice and aggressive piney hop finish that lingers. A very nice ale, I wish I had another. Worth checking out it you live in CO, or know someone who does!!!"
"Deep maroon cola color, translucent, with a massive creamy, tan head. Smells strongly of alcohol and a raisin and biscuit smell. Taste is very intersting. Strong alcohol presence, with woody and a slight coffee tinge. Mouthfeel is slightly grainy, with a sizable amount of carbonation. A very interesting beer, that I would definitely recommend."
"I haven't been too impressed with Great Divide's other 12-oz offerings, but this one is top notch, right up there with Titan, Hercules, and Yeti. Well done, GD!"
"The bottle is notched as a 2000 bottling. I am drinking at room temp in a snifter. THe brew pours a cloudy dark mahogany with no lite passing through. A small beige creamy head foams up and fades to an edge layer quickly. Aroma is sweet and fruity with plums and raisins leading the way. Also some pears and a mix of floral and piney hops. I also get a little sweet malt like brown sugar. Nice robust body with very faint carbonation. Flavor is a bit of piney hops to start than all sweet malt with plums toffee and molasses careening across my palate. The finish is slightly warming in my belly. Overall a well made brew and easy to drink. Alcohol is well hidden."
"I'll be picking this up a few more times during Winter Season."
"Pours a dark dark red with brown highlights a tan head that is gone mighty fast no lace. Sweet fruity malt raisins plums sugar drops dance threw my head very light on hop aroma. Taste is lightly carbonated sweet malt flowing with fruity flavors great start. Goes all to hell has a strange sour finish? Beer was fine smelled good even tasted good until the lingering sour aftertaste . Is it bad and if so wouldn't it be worse if contaiminated? If anyone knows beer mail meI can't believe that was whta they were going for. Mouthfeel is fine. Drinkability is of course not good do to sour taste. I will have to try this again to be sure some day."
"Pours a deep brown with not a whole lot of head but plenty of carbonation. Malty aroma with some hops and a touch of sourness. Taste... woah. This is not a beer for the faint of heart. The taste is pleasant but intense. I don't know what it is about this beer, there's a ton of chocolate, caromel and some ripe fruits, but also a lot of hops. Nothing about this beer is subtle. It would be an excellent beer for a very cold day. It gets marked down a little in drinkability because I feel like its a little rough around the edges.... lots of interesting taste sensations, just no balance. The 8.1% alcohol however is well hidden."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the mahogany brew. Laces well. Aroma is deeply malty, with an easily apparent alcohol component. Taste is based on the dark malts, but some dark fruits add a slight sourness to the flavor. Mouthfeel and drinkability both very good, especially for an old ale. The smoothness and lack of alcohol burning is appreciated."
"Pours a deep brown with some nice ruby highlights and an creamy offwhite head about a half inch thick. A nice lacing is left on the glass. Aromas are of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts, along with a little molasses in there as well. Initially this beer hits up from with a nice barrage of roasted malts, then progresses towards nice chocolate and carob flavors. A little nut flavor sneaks in there as well along with some molasses. This beer finishes still very malty but has a nice bitter hop finish that lingers in the mouth. Overall a nice creamy rich body with just the right amount of carbonation. Super drinkable at 8%"
"Dark red-brown body and a smallish head. The aroma is pretty hefty with caramel and cappaccino. The flavor brings in notes of nuts and a hint of chocolate all followed up with a bit of alcohol. A bit of woodiness is involved in the flavors and aromas and the fruit isnt huge, but does complement the rest nicely."
"Pours out a very dark brown with ruby highlights. There is a tan head that died quick leaving big frothy bubbles floating atop my beer. Aroma is very malty & complex. Malted milk, citrous zing, coffee & chocolate, others. The taste, while still hefty on the malt, is overpowered by a lemony zing, making for a weird combination. Alcohol is evident in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and thick, but the drinkablity suffers from from the lemony zing I spoke of. Not something I'd want another one of in one sitting. The flavors are just all over the place in this one."
"This one pours a deep brown with a reddish hue and has a nice thick tan head. The body looks a bit murky with some bits of stuff swimming around in it. It has decent head retention and leaves a nice lace about the glass. The aroma is strong with dark fruits and chocolate and as it warmed the citrus hops and alcohol seemed to stand out more. Very malty taste with a fruity sweetness standing at the front and a bit of hops to tame down the sweetness so it doesnt overpower the flavor. There are also nice hints of dark fruits and a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is a good with a nice full body and a lingering flavor. Great beer that is highly drinkable, pick one up if you havent already."
"A little light in the malt sugar department, this one has fermented dry, and would benefit from more complex sugars. Probably better young. Decent, but not very impressive for the style."
"This strong old ale has a few Doppelbock characteristics in the flavor profile, but is more tart and hoppy. The floral hops character has a lasting presence, and lends a nice balance. Plenty of complexities in this one. I wish I had been more careful with the pour. Still, this is an ale that I look forward to trying again."
"A dark murky brown/ruby red colour with a small, tight head of tan/brown foam. The aromas are strong. I smell leather, deeply roasted malts, alcohol, dark fruits, spices, citric hops, chocolate, and more. The taste is quite malty, with the hops in the middle, and the dark fruits and chocolate in the lingering finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and right where it should be and the drinkability is damn nice. Overall a quality brew."
"The 2003 Hibernation Ale poured a deep mahogany with a creamy tan head that went to a thin skim and laced the glass the whole way down. It smells of fig and malts with hints of chocolate, caramel and some alcohol. The taste is comlpex yet well balanced and appealing. It has a sweet malt start with a lightly hopped, crisp, slightly acidic finish. There are also some woody flavors mixed with a fruity fig/raisin taste. It has a subtle alcohol warming as well. The palate was full-bodied and creamy. Overall, a terrific winter warmer found late in the season. This is up there with Anchor OSA as my favorite of the season."
"Overall Impression: This beer is true to style, but the overall taste just doesn’t rock my boat. I may have started it a bit too cold, because my opinion really warmed as the beer did. While I’m going to give this beer fairly high marks, it just isn’t my cup of tea. I like big beers, and old ales, but the flavor just didn’t match my taste buds. I think I’ll try next year’s version and revisit my review."
"Drinkability - With such a full body, it's hard to imagine putting many of these away in one sitting. This is an excepitonally smooth sipping beer. A great winter beer from Great Divide."
"Very well balanced and very well made."
"Deep garnet color with a foamy tan head. Nice retention and additionally attractive trails of lace down the glass. Biscuity malt, resinous hops, toffee and chocolate notes resonate in the nose. Additional emphasis on toffee, caramel, ripe fruit and unsweet chocolate linger on the palate along with a rich, earthiness induced by the addition of piney, sappy hops. Warming alcohol presents itself on the long finish. Sweet malt flavor dominates, however, and will continue to do so as this beer matures. Chewy mouthfeel is smooth, round and full. A nice, complex and warming old ale in the British tradition. This beer, while drinking quite well young, could certainly stand to be laid down to mellow further. A perennially solid achievement from Great Divide -- this year is no exception."
"I'm drinking a 2002 vintage I've been keeping for nearly a year. Looks and smells great. Cloudy motor oil colored murky stuff with a bit of floating chunks. I suppose the taste is pretty great (see the other beer freaks' descriptions...most of whom I agree with), and the only reason I don't rank it higher is that there's a metallic taste to the beer that's a bit hard to ignore. May be that it doesn't keep more than 6 months or so. It seems to be a hyperspiced old ale in the most general sense, though, so I anticipated it would keep better. I'll try it again this year, as should you, dear reader. Maybe it takes a couple of years for it to optimize?"
"Cheers BigHuge, youre a Gentleman BA."
"This could be the finished English ale I've had this side of the pond. truly amazing, my only regret is that I have no more. Oh well, I've been looking for an excuse to go to Colorado anyway!"
"I have to finish my winter beers before I put in the air conditioner. I do like this one, a pretty, deep reddish brown brew with a tan/orange head. The aroma is a complex malt ( brown sugar,molassas) and earthy, citrus hop. The body is a very drinkable medium to full with a very nice finish of roasted/nutty malt. The flavors are very complex too. This one has chocolate and tobacco with baking spices (esp. cinnamon,nutmeg and ginger) with a little earthy hop flavor elbowing it's way in. This is a nice winter warmer (or evening sipper in spring) that has a balanced sweet and spicy flavor that hides the alcohol well. And it went really well with Swiss chocolate."
"Dark amber/brown with a very thick light tan head. Aroma is toasty and malty. Somewhat rich body, it started out strong with roasted malt and sticky sweet caramel and gradually phased into a more bitter hops and grapefuit presence. Good warmer to start but becomes almost too bitter by the end. Still the best from Great Divide I have tried so far."
"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights. It forms an off-white head with excellent lacing. The aroma is sweet malt, fruity, date-like, and bready. Excellent aromas. The flavors are fig and dates, with a nice breadiness. It is a medium-full bodied beer, with a semi-sweet finish and a slight bitterness that lingers. I found this to be an excellent beer."
"Drinkability: Still a bit harsh. I would like to try this in a year or two to see if it might be a little more civilzed. All in all, though, a very complex and enjoyable beer."
"A nebulous mahogany color on the pour, the head planetary in size, frothy in texture, the color a light tan, as it evanesces, the lace formed is a thick and sticky sheet that seals off the glass. A hint of fusel alcohol, a bit of bubble gum, sweet malt, caramel, fresh and inviting, a real pleasure to sniff this one, start is sweet malt, the top middling in feel. Finish is perky in its acidity, the hops straight forward in their spicy bite, dry and a real treat. A bit of alcohol warming as it hits the tummy, a fine beer at any rate."
"Year Produced: 2002"
"This brew was a find for me that I sought out from another BA in Colorado, who Highly recommended it. Im glad I took his trade offer for I sure would of missed a true beer gem. Great Divide's limited edition brew was not available in Ohio, at 8% abv, until now. I think the brewer sums it up best as a robust ale. It pours a deep mahogany with a nice off-white head and lots of sticky lace. The aroma of hop over alcohol with hints of roasted malts and nut. This is a stick to your ribs brew that the taste and mouthfeel reflect. Its a full bodied, smooth, yet robust, well balanced blend of toasted malts, hints of nutty chocolate topped off with assertive hops to warm the chest. A great winter warmer that can be enjoyed now or later. If you like to cellar or collect for later, this is a gotta-a-have!!"
"Huge cream colored head which almost had a pinkish hue. The whipped looking foam raised itself almost 2/4 inch above my shaker glass before settling into the beer leaving a rocky top capping the deep red beer with millions of tiny particles in suspension. Nose of the beer consisted of a sweet and sour malt with some subtle hints of hops and toasted grains. Slick, sour malt flavor with some charcoal hiding in the background. Im not sure if this beer was bad, but it sure was sour. It did get sweeter as my mouth became acclimated to the acidity. Ill have to come back to this one."
"Pours a brownish chestnut color with a creamy off-white colored head that fades into a bubbly lace. Nose is sweet malts and buttery caramel blended with some spicy hops. Fairly full-bodied with a creamy and chewy texture. Taste is toasted sweet malts at first quickly followed by notes of rich buttery toffee, caramelized fruit, and dark chocolate. Raw hop leaf flavors come through in the end to balance out the sweetness very nicely. A thoroughly enjoyable belly warmer for a cold day."
"Bottled 2002: Pours a clear but dark brown/amber color with a nice 2-finger light tan head. The smell of sweet buttery muffins and a light malt aroma are quite nice. But sometimes this much of a buttery smell means too much of a diacetyl taste. Lets hope not! The taste is a strong alcohol taste along with a cough medicine flavor, butterscotch, and also light hops. Perhaps aging would help. Its definitely not at all bad and it has a medium-bodied creamy mouthfeel and a definite warming effect, its just a bit raw as is and that is going to affect my drikability score. Id like to age a bottle of this for about a year and then try this again. It has a lot of potential! Cheers!"
"Bottled 2002. Clear ruby hue, topped by a well retained light beige head that leaves spotty foam. The aroma is dominated by a deep melange of floral and lightly citrusy hops with a mild undertone of earth. Perhaps a combination of Goldings and Willamette. Caramel malt morphs into a berryish red licorice fruity sweetness towards the end. Trace butterscotch. Concomitantly estery, caramelly and redolently hoppy aromawise. Flavorwise, a combination of fruity and medium lovibond caramel malt sweetness is perceived upfront, then yields to mellow impressions of dry roasted nuts. Mild diacetyl complements the malt profile, lending a subtle brittle like impression. Pleasant raspberry like esters couples with residual sweetness, yielding a lately emerging candied fruit impression. Hop bitterness is mild, and attempts balance, but malt sweetness prevails. Lightly bodied, perhaps deceptively so, and consequently quaffable. Finishes simply sweet at first, with lingering hints of buttery malt. Hibernation ale is a very enjoyable brew. Complex and flavorful, but a notch shy in body. One of the most drinkable strong ales I've had thus far. Big thanks to Jaybeerman for the bottle."
"Right now I'd have to say I prefer Great Lakes Christmas Ale to this one, but I'm definitely looking forward to a second sampling of this one in the very near future."
"An incredible beerway more balanced than so many winter offerings. This one doesnt have the overwhelming hoppiness of a young SN Celebration, or the chewy, off-balanced maltiness of Pyramid Snow Cap. In this everything comes together perfectly. Its one of those rare cases where a beer is actually great."
"Note: After reading some of the other reviews, it is possible I had a bad bottle. Unfortunately, one was all I had, and I'm not sure of the age. It expired in March '03. I plan to revisit this beer at a later date."
"hazy dark ruby colored, with a thick and sticky tan head which leaves ample amounts of lace. wonderful aroma of piney hops, caramel and chocolate malts. a bit rough in the mouthfeel at first, but finishes surprisingly smooth. tastes of spicy alcohol, chocolate, caramel, and a distinct spice and hop aftertaste. full bodied. loads of malts and hops fill your senses with joy. this is the best winter brew by far i've sampled this season. this is a beer worth stockpiling. highly recommended and worthy of special distinction among the other highly touted brews. a winter classic."
"Dark purple/garnet in color, fluffy, creamy head. Nose is spicy, warm, sweet, buttery, notes of cramel, cinnamon, toast, nutmeg, nuts. An excellent aroma bouquet. Smooth mouthfeel, great texture, full body. One of the most sweet, smooth, and comforting dark ales of any style I've ever come across. An excellent beverage, rich in texture, full with malt, little bitterness but a woefully short finish, for all it's flavor. This one goes in my Hall of Fame of winter ales!"
"This is a great beer fresh out of the store, but I really think it improves with even a year's time. It pours a nice deep copper color, with an ample, creamy, light tan head. The head retention is excellent... I had at least a quarter inch of head the entire time, which didn't just leave behind a lace. No, it leaves behind sheets of foam on the side of the glass. I would say the carbonation is medium to low, which is fine, because the mouthfeel is also quite impressive, being very thick, velvety and creamy. I think that a higher carbonation would detract from that. Flavor was sweet, and malty, with chocolate and toast, and some faint fruits. There may be a slight sourness as well, so I'm not sure how much longer I'd keep this beer around the house. The hops had really changed character from my memory of a fresh Hibernation. One year later, the hops plays a much smaller role, but is still present to help offset a cloying finish. Man, this was a great beer, but, my review may be somewhat biased since it came as such a great surprise not to be drinking nasty soured beer. Tomorrow, I'm going to go find some more and have a vertical tasting of this years next to the other '01 Hibernation ."
"1 yr. later: I'm disappointed in how this brew aged...seems to have lost something rather than mellowing nicely. Drink this one fresh."
"Clear brown with a ruby sheen under the light.  Nice 1/2 inch yellow-tan head with lots of bubble sizes.  Beautiful appearance.  Slight spice aroma with some sense of a burnished leather.  Mouthfeel is medium with a little ""burn"" at the swallow.  Flavor is peppery with unsweetened clove and nutmeg mixing with low carbonation to give impact.  Piling on that is an impressive hopping, giving a flavorful bittering that struck me well.  A challenging beer, if you like clove gum and a little alcohol warming, here's a beer for you.  I'm going to cellar a bottle to see if it mellows."
"Thanks jaybeerman!"
"Thanks to jaybeerman for hooking me up with this gem."
"Thanks to Jaybeerman for the sample."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a twist -off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass. The label notes that this sample was produced in 2001, with no month information."
"This is a strong beer.  You can feel the alcohol as you get close to it.  Has a thick chewy mouthfeel.  Great warming sensation.  Very solid showing for Great Divide."
"Overall, quite an enjoyable winter brew here.  Warming and complex.  I'll have to pick up some more to lay down."
"A bit of a weak head, probably a little too cold when I poured it.  An amazing combination of chocolate malts and hops gives this beer some true character."
"A most enjoyable and warming Winter offering from the folks @ Great Divide."
"Wow - huge chocolate aroma.  Dense and chewy mouthfeel.  Lots of choclate sliding along a spicy alcohol undercurrent.  I got the barest touch of ammonia in the finish, but not enough to put me off the beer.  Slighty syrupy, you could tell the beer needed some time to age and meld the flavors.  I'm going to put a couple of bottles back and see how this holds up next year."
"Notes: This beer is a drop-kick to the tongue, lots of flavours going on with a multi-leveled complexity. Fresh and in the raw, aging this beer for a year could do good though if you are looking for a raw kick in the pants strong ale then drink it now."
