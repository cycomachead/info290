"D: This one ended up being a pleasant surprise.  I had high hopes (as with any de Proef collaboration), but the aroma seemed a bit disjointed.  Then the taste (see above) put my concerns to rest.  It is an interesting (especially for style) and complex offering.  This one is best enjoyed on its own...a good winter sipper.  Seek it out! (4.25)"

"Overall: Fairly good Old Ale with some nice oak aging, but really wasn't worth the money or a big fancy collaboration (but I did not lower the score due to the price)."

"Let this one warm up a bit.  The complexity of flavors really comes out.  Nice beer."

"Poured on tap in a shaker pint, the beer is a cloudy, muddled, opaque, caramel brown coloring with no head. Aromas of apple, candi sugar, toffee, dates, fig, and a spice blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Flavors are roasted and sweet forward, with apple, subtle creme, tangy toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. A wee bit off-balanced. The body is robust and boozy, with a candy apple aftertaste. Rich, slick finish with a building warmth."

"a great and unique expression of the style here, i love it. paler in color than old ales usually are, without much head from the tap on this one. a nose of sweet layered grain, cinnamon, and sweet oak. even a touch of raisin or dried cherry in here. the flavor is similar, with the toffee grain flavor going from start to finish and the cinnamon and molasses spice unfolding in the middle. dried fruit is more date or fig than berry or cherry on the palate, less sweet. the alcohol is warming, but not cutting or hot, and i think that aspect is really well designed and executed. the spice complexion is really interesting with the lighter colored but full bodied and sticky sweet grain base, it gives it rounder edges and a lingering appeal. a mellow apple cider or mulled character to the finish is really nice, very wintery. enormously satisfying glass of ale here, beautifully done, like nothing else i know."

"750 ml bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours slightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, raisin, cherry, fig, date, brown sugar, chocolate, nuttiness, tannic red wine, vanilla, oak, leather, tobacco, musty funk, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity/funky yeast, and oak/cocoa notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, cherry, plum, fig, date, brown sugar, chocolate, nuttiness, tannic red wine, vanilla, oak, leather, tobacco, musty funk, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Some light earthy yeast spice and slight tannic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, cherry, plum, fig, date, brown sugar, chocolate, nuttiness, red wine, vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity/funky yeast, and oak/cocoa flavors; with a great yeast/malt/oak balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and slightly tart/tannic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible old ale style! All around fantastic complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity/funky yeast, and oak/cocoa flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Closing with a greater sense of dryness than expected, its sweet taste develops quickly into a powdery-fresh finish, equipped with a broad woodsy hop bitterness, wood spice and the sour-astringent interplay suggestive of grape seed and plum skin, and then finally a glimpse of dark chocolate in aftertaste."

"Candied dates, raisins, deeply caramelized malt, toasted bread, and light floral notes counter a touch of dark cherry in aroma. Flavor reveals a fairly sweet, buttery, nutty toffee start, which becomes dry and toasted mid palate, anchored by a cherry character reminiscent of the aftertaste of cough syrup.  Wish the medicinal finish weren't quite so pronounced. Incredible aroma. Finish is more dry than I'd prefer, but I guess that's the Brett, as I just read the description."

"Lots of caramel and chocolate on the nose. A hint of clove. Copper colored. Above moderate  carbonation and tingly mouthfeel. Caramel and chocolate predominate with overtone of Belgian yeast and a hint of coffee. A very good beer."

"Overall:  Wow, I really liked this beer!  Just hits so many flavors while remaining a coherent whole.  Just excellent stuff, I hope I can find another bottle somewhere."

"Poured into a snifter.  Brown in color; lighter around the edges when held up to light.  Some head with little lace.  The nose is all over the place, with stronger notes of vanilla, dark fruit (with some apple and pear) and cocoa taking control here.  The taste follows suit.  Really intense and layered, with so much malty depth.  Unpretentious despite its complexity.  A big beer at 10% ABV, but not overly boozy.  Seriously, this is one fine beer.  A commendable effort from the fine folks who made this possible.  Cheers."

"Note: When my wife and I first tasted this beer, it was fridge cold.  Our fault for being thirsty and impatient.  The beer presents a strong metallic/penny/blood flavor when cold, to the point of seeming decidedly off-flavor, but this fades and is completely gone by the time it gets to the recommended temperature.  Many beers served colder than recommended only sacrifice peak flavor.  In my experience this is a less common one, one that will be downright off, even to the point where you may be tempted to write off the beer. So let this one sit on the counter for a good 20-25 minutes if pulling from a conventional refrigerator. You will not regret it."
"I'd prefer to revisit this in about 3-4 years minimum, but alas, I doubt there's a drop of this beer outside of Anodyne's keg."

"O: Eugh. I'm halfway torn between this being a horrible experiment and some sort of brewing fault. It's funky, herbal, and metallic. Not sure I've ever had an old ale that tastes anything like that. Not very good, I drain poured it."

"O: Enjoyable and fairly light. The booze is hidden well. A great sipper but nothing to waggle your penis at."

"Overall: A very good take on an Old Ale. Good mix of bready dryness, funk, and fruit notes."

"Overall: Quite nice, really. I enjoyed myself, but my enjoyment is tempered by the abject sadness of knowing I only have this one, lone bottle. It reminds me to take pleasure in the simple things, to go outdoors, to go do something, anything. To live life and enjoy it. For Long of Tooth."

"The description of this beer intrigued me. Old Ale aged on cocoa nibs and oak? Sounds great, but you worry me when you mention the brett. I wasn't sure how it would work in an Old Ale, but I hardly noticed it at all. My only issue with this beer is that I like Old Ales to have deep, intense malt character and to display good malt complexity. There's too much going on here with all the fruit notes. The flavors, while good, tend to get muddled. I liked this beer, but I'm not sure all the added ingredients enhanced the flavor all that much. Right now, I would prefer a top-shelf, standard Old Ale (like North Coast Old Stock Ale) to this. As I continue to experience more beers, my tastes might change and I might warm to this more."

"O - Overall it say this is close to an English Old Ale since it did not pick up on the coco nibs."
"750 ml bottle. Pours dark amber with tall, long-lasting, foamy, off-white head. Aroma is of funky yeast, caramel malt, dark fruit and wood. Body is full and crisp. Taste is of spicy yeast, caramel malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, herbal hops and alcohol. Complexity of flavor is increasing as beer warms up. Finish is long, herbal and dry. Outstanding brew."
