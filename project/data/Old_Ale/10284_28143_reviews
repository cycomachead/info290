"O- A good beer. I haven't seen any of this since 2011. With a few tweaks, it could be great. I think the age definitely did this beer well."

"Overall, this is a fine Old Ale that probably won't drink again. Well done. Let's move on."

"This is one well assembled beer! I would gladly have this again anytime, anywhere."

"aramel smell coming off of this, literally took me by surprise. Nice aroma of oak and alcohol mixing and swirling around with it now, really starting to pick up steam the warmer it got. So complex, with rich earthy tones running rampant through it. Warm oak infused notes of brandy like alcohol running over the tongue, so sweet and sugary. As you roll it around you start to notice there is a little bit of a bitter bite to this one. Way down deep under all of the malt, there was a subtle bitter hoppiness, very grainy and earthy, but it was there, and really pushed through on the finish. Long drawn out finish it was, soo complex, with every sip letting you discover more and more flavors. Deep dark fruit now coming through for me, really started to actually dominate the scene all together. Huge raisin and plum notes giving it that sweet but yet tart dark fruit flavor we all come to love"

"O - First I've had of this style, but after reading Independence's description is feels like they were very close to the mark on this beer. I'd love to try some with another year or two on it."
"O - Very impressed with this one, first beer from Independence that I have found to be truly noteworthy. Going to have to pick up a few of these to lay down again."
"Overall, a slightly boozey tasting, very reserved attempt at the style, not bad by any means but falls short of being good"
"Update: I just opened another 2011 edition of this beer, now 2 years old and I had to come and change my numbers on this. This beer is truly incredible. I don't know if I have weird taste or if this is just a very hidden gem because 2011 editions of this beer seem to be all over the place, never flying off the shelves and the reviews aren't exactly fantastic on here. I was pretty new to craft beer when I first had this, but coming back, it's even better than I remember it. Not sure why I thought alcohol heat was not very discernible, though. It's VERY present, which is awesome, and that roasted leather-molasses flavour is just spot on. It's like being able to drink a barbecue, which should be every Texans dream, I would imagine. The stickiness on the mouthfeel is a little much, I'll admit, but this is one of my favourite beers and I encourage other lovers of roasted malts and sweet beers to partake...as soon as possible."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew. Light to moderate carbonation but leaning more towards light. This is a fairly decent take on the style but there are others that are better. It is a decent sipper and more enjoyable while it is chilled. Once it warms up, it gets to be a bit of a disjointed mess that doesn't meld well due to its lack of big residual malt flavoring I expect in the style."
"The beer was an orange copper color with a tan colored, thick head that did leave some nice lacing. I could smell apples, pears, a hint of white wine and a caramel background. The taste is similar, I got some alcohol, white grape, apple peel and lemon. It's medium bodied, very smooth, warming and dry. This is an enjoyable brew, I wouldn't mind seeing what a little more aging would do to it."
"Opinion: I don't know what to say except that this is a pretty good beer, and that this is a hard category to score well in because the competition is so high. That said, this beer is very thin for the style by any stretch. The hops are pretty aggressive for the style as well, so maybe it would be better appreciated once it has been cellared for 4-5 years. Either way, it is decent and worth a shot to see if you like this end of the Old Ale spectrum."
"This beer pours a slight copper color leaning more to the jaundiced side on that color scale with an offwhite head that's minuscule at best. The aromatics are rather fruity. I detected hints of butterscotch and green apple, which I have to admit I didn't truly expect. The flavors were a bit on the side of apple juice mixed in with some buttery notes and sweet malt to carry along with it. The mouthfeel was smooth and nice. It was carbonated rather nicely, but did have an acidic quality to it. The overall on this beer was that it was fine, it didn't wow me but I didn't hate it either."
"I'm not sure where the carbonation issues, clarity issues and other stale issues, that I see complaints of, are coming from. Maybe storage is an issue, but the age has done well for my bottles and I don't seem to have those issues at all..."
"Think this was the first beer from Independence we had."
"Overall this tasted more like a hybrid of DIPA and American barleywine that was aged long enough to let the hops fade. Strange for an old ale but not terrible."
"D - This is pretty boozy."
"Pours a clear golden red color body with a small white head, quickly diminishing. Somewhat musty aroma, strong dark fruits. Alcoholy taste. Somewhat old, musty taste. The fruit taste mellows in the aftertaste. Hotter as it warms up. Would taste better aged another year, maybe two."
"D - Easy enough to drink, but the lack of carbonation combined with a lack of flavor complexity make it difficult to enjoy. I probably won't be having this again."
"Taste is heavily leaning towards the sweet malts...burnt caramel, toffee and crystal malt. There is some muscadine grape fruitiness in there as well as a few hints of raisins and figs. Jasperilla is a bit watery and there is not much character to the ale, never will be called overly complex. I enjoyed drinking my half of the bomber though and would consider purchasing again."
"Pours orangish-brown with not much head. The aroma is very sweet with lots of caramel malt. The flavor has a lot of malty sweetness with some a caramel flavor. There is also some fruit, specifically apple. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. I have had this beer before but never reviewed it. I think it was better fresh."
"D - I think this would be easier to drink if I was in the mood for it rather than seeing it in the fridge and saying why the hell not this beer isn't anything to go out of your way to get"
"D: I had high hopes for this beer but it fell short. It brings back great memories of spending time in Texas though. It needs more of a malt taste and for the body to be thickened up."
"It was nice to try this local, but I don't know if I'd buy another bomber of Jasperilla. I enjoyed the flavor at first, but after a while, it just became a chore to keep sipping."
"I have to mark this one down on drinkability because it's a sipping beer, not a session drink. But that's the nature of the beast with most old ales and they shouldn't be denigrated for it. Once you get a taste for them you're hooked."
"Verdict: I'm happy to report that this is quite a tasty and complex beer, and would be a great brew to enjoy with a cigar in the evening. I'll be cellaring a bottle for a year or so to see how it ages."
"Pours a clear medium to dark copper color with a good sized bubbly off white head that sticks around for a while. Aromas of caramel and light citrus come to the forefront. Slight alcohol and a twinge of biscuit round things out. Smells decent, but smells malty sweet, very little hop on the nose. The taste is sweet caramel and a light fruitiness. Its really malty sweet almost to the point of cloying. Theres a strange twang in the background that I can't quite identify its almost metallic or phenolic luckily it doesn't stick around long enough to ruin this completely. Slight alcohol burn in the finish. Carbonation is medium, mouthfeel is sticky, body is medium to thick. This one has some issues. It could be my fault for sitting on this bottle for 2 years, but as is this isn't that good. Its heavy on the malt without enough hops to balance the sweetness. That strange taste doesn't help much either. I'd love to give a fresh bottle a try."
"overall i fell semi blessed to have gotten a hold of this vintage offering. look for a follow up review of the 2008 coming soon"
"drinkability is ok. the balance isn't too bad for the style, but otherwise there's nothing bringing me back for more. don't really have much interest in finishing the glass, let alone considering another."
"Pours an almost clear light amber/golden, some orange highlighting, very thick off white head forms, chunky and rocky, drops a ton of lace on the glass, very thick, real nice layer, looks good! Smell is interesting, quite sweet, lots of toffee, very heavy biscuity aroma, bread, some raisin and light fruitiness, grapes, touch of alcohol, lightly earthy, something about it that smells a bit weird I can't place, like a dirty bathroom floor. Taste is weird, apricots and rotten fruit, some caramel and brown sugar sweetness, grapes, raisin, biscuits, very sweet, some iron, alcohol, kind of a mess. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, almost syrupy, low carbonation, some warmth going down, a little tough of drink. The biscuit/toasty character is neat, but too sweet and some real strange flavours going on, but it does look nice. Thanks Greg!"
"A good brew. Works well with a grilled Swiss cheese sandwich. Worth the taste, but not the best I have had in the style. A solid craft brew."
"overall im glad i got to try this its different i will give it that..."
"A bit too thick in the mouth. Not a big hit, here. Maybe better super fresh - maybe there's more hop flavor to it. On tap I'd expect more carbonation, too - to help cut down on the body."
"Overall, interesting, but a bit too sweet for my tastes."
"This is a strange brew. I'm not sure I would call this an old ale, exactly, but it is interesting. Big and adventurous, but it seems to miss its target. A good one to try, if you're into new, off-center brews, but it's a stretch to say this is like any other old ale I've ever had. Cheers to Independence for being creative, though."
"M + D: Medium body, medium carbonation. Pretty straight forward, maybe even lacking a little something. This likely peaked a little while back, but it has managed to hold up alright. No real desire to hunt it down again, but not too bad. Glad I tried it."
"I saw this for about $5 a bomber. I thought that was a good deal, and something I wanted to try. I have, and I don't care to try it again."
"The flavor is a step in the right direction, and tastes of syrupy booze, white pepper, tropical fruit esthers, and a kiss of piney hops along the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, with a low carbonation level and a lingering finish of warming alcohol. Jasperilla isn't exactly what I look for in an Old Ale, but it's a decent brew that's worth the small asking price. Nevertheless, I don't think I'd buy it again."
"D: this is a pretty intence beer and nice to try, but not easy to drink much of"
"Reminds me of a flat whiskey Dr. Pepper or a mildly-sweet, slightly hopped tawny Port. Not as thick or sweet or alcoholic as North Coast Old Stock, but closer in all three than many Old Ales I've sampled. All-in-all I don't really like it. It's annoyingly cloyingly sweet and never amounted to my notion of tasty, engaging, or drinkable."
"A bit too much grapefruit, but it comes together decently well."
"Any reasonable beer lover would think that a 9.3% old ale is a prime candidate for aging. Well, apparently not *this* 9.3% old ale. I hope the boys at Independence Brewing Co. aren't satisfied with the status quo, because Jasperilla has a great deal of potential. Thanks to mhewes for an interesting extra."
"very smoothe, low carbo, best beer by Independence Brewery by far."
"This one is just hard to nail down. I find that it best when severed at a bar because several bottles have been misses that I picked up at stores. In the end I think it is worth trying but not something you are going to want all the time. You might want to avoid the 2006 vintage."
"D: Not good at all."
"Alcohol is not in the taste, but the thick sweetness makes it not so quaffable. I'll have a hard time finishing this bomber pleasurably."
"D- Alcohol is hidden well and it is very enjoyable. I think this one could sneak up on you if you're not careful."
"D - If I didn't have to work the next day, I could drink a few of these. Very drinkable."
"Aftertaste is also a disappointing synthetic experience."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the clear dark amber brew. Head lasts well, with heavy coating lace. Aroma is strongly sweet, but also has some citrus and pine. Taste is lightly malty upfront, but strongly citrus and fruity in the middle, with a light hoppiness next, and then a warming close. The sharp citrus character is reminiscent of lemonade. Mouthfeel and drinkability are just alright as well, quashed by that citrus as well. This one fell apart a bit once I got past the eyes and nose."
"I bought this bottle at Central Market in Austin, Texas."
"This beer is best forgotten. Hopefully Independence can do better in the future."
"Pours out a copper amber with abundant carbonation and a nice small, but sturdy, head. Leaves some sheets of lacing. Aroma is mostly tart plum and granny smith. Lots of sherry and booze too. Is this already showing signs of heavy oxidation? Lots of plum up front in the flavor with a middle showing of sour apple. Toast starts to blossom towards the end, but is interrupted by sherry and an odd fungal/baker's yeast flavor and dryness in the finish. Carbonation is rather mellow and a touch creamy. The body isn't too thick, but holds strong. Not impressed with this at all. Not finishing this bomber."
"Pours a clear bronze with a thick creamy off white head that dies quick and leaves behind spotty lace. Smells very bready, caramel, sweet malt and almost a hint of banana chip. Taste is big on malt then big on booze. Finish is sherry like. Full in the mouth with minor carbonation. Had to choke the end of this down. Way too boozy."
"Jasperilla Old Ale pours a clear copper body beneath a creamy head of off-white foam. The head retention is limited and it leaves little lacing behind. The nose is malty with a hint of caramel, and fruity with yeast character (apple, pear, red berries), but it has some higher alcohols and a touch of acetone as well. That carries over into the flavor and seems to dominate. It's like drinking a hot honey-mead. Perhaps the fermentation just got away on this batch - the cooling system failed or something - but it's not good. As it warms and the maltiness comes out a bit more it's a little easier to take, but at that point the alcohol becomes more prevalent. Flawed. Perhaps next years will be better."
"A dark rich amber colour in the glass. No head, but a thin layer of bubbles around the edge. Fairly strong aromas (particularly as it warmed) of bread and dried fruit, similar to a Christmas fruit cake. The higher alcohol, often typical of the style, is detectable, but light. Full, rich flavours of caramel and dark fruits; raisins, figs, apricots, vanilla. Finish is slightly dry and a bit acidic with a mild warming affect. This is a wonderful beer that can be enjoyed with a desert as well as savoured as an evening ender. Very drinkable."
"A pleasure to drink, this beer is what I'd call a stealth beer. Very easy to drink quickly for such a high gravity. It'll be interesting to see how this one matures over time."
"I bought this 2005 vintage at Grapevine Market, Austin, Texas, in April 2007. First, do not drink it too cold! Let it warm to 50-55 degrees or warmer. Clear golden color with malty nose. Caramel, dirty, apricot pits, vanilla, licorice, and warming. Complex sweetness. Chewy. 22 ozs of joy. Don't plan another brew on the same day."
"Sampled at Independence Brewing on Saturday, October 14th, 2006."
"It redefines the Old Ale category."
