"A classic beer preferred on draught to bottle or can silky smooth beer"
"A very smooth, dark beer.  Strong malt taste but not too overbearing."
"Overall very nice, would try again but not rave about it."

"A dark impressive pleasant ale."

"Overall: Theakstons are a local (to me) brewery and Old Peculier can often be found on draught hereabouts. It's a bit heavy to be a session beer, unless your plan is to get as drunk as possible as quickly as possible. More of a 'sipping' beer - the sort of thing that you can enjoy in front of a blazing fire at the back-end of the year. Rather like now, in fact. Recommended."

"DATE TASTED: September 19, 2014... GLASSWARE: Wychwood Hobgoblin stange...OCCASION: a long week ends... APPEARANCE: dark burgundy body; thick, creamy brown head that sits resiliently atop its pint; lacing is patterned... AROMA: robust raisin and black currants wake up the nostrils; malts are smoky and substantial, semisweet and aggressive... PALATE: surprisingly smooth, buttery and lactic--carbonated and warming, with a run-like draw.....TASTE: immediate butterscotch licks the tastebuds; vanilla, dough and peat constitute a promising profile...OVERALL as expected, a unique, classic profile that impresses with its sweet complexity...a beer to savor...."

"My first old ale to prove. And what a nice one. Very gentle flavors but towards perfection. Sweet toffee in the nose with a more robust coffee undertone. Smooth and creamy. The roasted barley coming stronger in the taste and with sweet vanilla more than toffee. A lingering gentle sourness dominating the bitterness. Beautiful on a end of summer night on my Amsterdam balcony overlooking a silent gracht."

"A truly great beer, Old Peculiar by Theakston sets the standard for the old ale style."

"This was interesting, but fell a tiny bit short for me. It had a lot of potential, but this just isn't the style of old ale I like."
"O. Not a bad beer. Would order again versus the various boring beers, but can probably find a nicer dark beer out there."

"Overall: This a solid beer. It has some nice dried fruit flavors and scents."
""
""
"Overall- Good to really good beer. A little more subtle than many of the old ales I've had but this is to be expected from an English brew. Definitely worth a try to get a sense of the range of the style. Probably would not repurchase though."
"O: Very nice. It's flavour is something between porter and barley wine but its mouthfeel is lighter than both."

"As I first poured this ale into my pint glass, I was under the impression this was going to be a forgettable beer. I took a swig, and as I set down the glass on the desk, I remember thinking my suspicions were confirmed. The taste started bitter, as you would expect any ale to deliver (a little too bitter, if I am to be honest). But, as I continued working at my desk, my taste buds would not let me forget the lingering bitterness that gave way to a sweet finish. I found myself reaching for the glass, taking another sip. As this deep red ale hit my tongue a second time, I realize that this beer holds a quaint little secret! Once again, I set the glass down on the desk, but, unlike the first time, I have a new respect for this delicious ale. Paying more attention to the flavor this time, I realize that this brew has a creamy, sweet caramel flavor, with a very nice lingering fruity undertone - well balanced with a mild bitterness. By the time I finish the glass, this ""forgettable"" beer has me craving another. Quite a pleasant surprise, I will not soon be forgetting this premium ale!"

"O. Fresh, I guess is the way to go with this one, my ratings are based on a fresh beer from brewery few days old. Aren't they always better that way!"

"This beer tastes exactly what an Old Ale should taste. Very flavorful and deep, but smooth at the same time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL- A really lovely example of old ale that calls to mind Fullers ESB. Proof that it is possible to bet a lot of flavor without a lot of alcohol."

"I really liked this ale and will be getting more in next time!"

"Prost!"
""

"No doubt this is brewed in England. A very traditional tasting ale with some minor oxidation flaws. But it's to be expected from an import. Nice fruit notes with some hops still hanging in there. The yeast really shows up and adds a bready doughy character. Would love to have this on cask in England."
""
"Super drinkable with nice English flavors. A true classic and very good."

"The taste is also incredibly sweet and malty with a low to moderate bitterness at the finish. This is the first time I have had this in about two years since it briefly left the US and it does not seem to have lost its uniqueness."
""
""
""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"O- Was not so impressed. It's an overall nice beer with decent complexity and a bit of a barleywine feel, but really just nothing outstanding"
"Dark burgundy-ruby in color, only a fleeting rise of head, appearance of density to the body (shape of the glow).... vaguely sherry-like vinous notes against a somewhat bold rich caramel and similarly potent dark stone fruit in the aromas.... immediate toffee and brown sugar flavors, with the prune-like fruit surging in from around the edges, thick caramel flavor and mild chewiness... with each sip an almost Scotch ale quality unfolds, and apparent Flemish red-like oxidized, lightly sour tinge in the aftertaste.... despite hints of syrupy chewiness initially, it lightens up enough early on not to tire the palate, though it retains a consistent bold malty, dextrinous texture, without viscosity.... little-to-no alcohol presence at any stage... not bad at all overall, though a bit of a letdown - I'll certainly try it on the pump if I ever come across it...."
""
""
"O - An average ale that lacks real flavour. Seems fairly flat and rather disappointing."
""
""
"O: An enjoyable beer that goes down easy. A nice way to end the day."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good, flavorful beer that will work good as both session and dessert beer."
""
""
"Overall - Don't let the look of this beer (or the name) deceive you. This beer is very drinkable. It's a beer only the English could brew. My only issue with this beer is that it seems to be completely devoid of hops (and a little lacking of character)."
""
""
""
"Chestnut brown, ecru froth forms a loose head. Molasses, treacle, brown malt, biscuit on the malt side of things. Countered by a surprisingly sharp hop bitterness along with an earthy hop punch. Slightly musty with a charred wood note. Pretty evenly balanced. I much prefer the lighter drier versions of this style and Old Peculier fits that mold. A nice English ale to sip, enjoy, but not think too much about. Glad this is back."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/27/2012. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, fig, banana, molasses, toast, chocolate, pepper, clove, brown bread, floral, and spicy yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity notes with moderate spicy esters. Taste of caramel, raisin, fig, molasses, light banana, toast, chocolate, pepper, clove, brown bread, floral, and spicy yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, dark fruits, toast, molasses, chocolate, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of malt and fruity/spicy flavors; with a great balance of malt/fruitiness and no cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent old ale. Nice complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a cola like color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some maltiness. Taste is also mild, some malts, light hops, not overly flavorful or complex. Feels light in the mouth and overall I found this to be a mediocre beer."
""
""
"Celler temp pint glass. The colour was a really dark ruby brown edging on black, with a tan head, great lacing and retention. Awesome looking beer. The smell was mostly of complex malt, a whiff of coffee, some earthy bitterness made it in. Taste had slightly roast malt, with some aged lemon citrus, leather, really solid flavour and good complexity. Bold malty flavour with a nice earthy bitterness. Balance is excellent. Feel was very smooth, great sessionable feel to it. A really robust dark ale, lot of complex character to it and balanced really well to make really drinkable and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"I'll have to try more old ales to decide what I think of the style. This brew doesn't want to make me give up my love for the English pale ale, BUT it's awfully interesting ... like a gateway beer to Guinness."
"Get out there and try Old Peculier! Not only is the name different, but the beer will make you say ""hmmm!"" Life is too short not to go ""hmmm!"" Don't waste it on beer that makes you go ""pppttt!"""

"Conclusion: This is fantastic. Maybe I was born to drink English beer, but I just love this. It hits all the right notes for an Old ale, save for a maybe a slight lack of ""tart"". But who can get nit-picky with such a fantastic and iconic beer."
""
"O: Enjoyable aromatics, but it's just okay otherwise. Though to be fair, this isn't my style by any stretch of the imagination."
""
"O: Flavors are more subtle than American old ales. The focus is on malt with the hops only coming through at the finish. It's a filling and satisfying beer."
""
""
"Notes: I had this for the first time quite a long time ago in a bottle then last October in England on tap now again in a bottle and it's absolutely incredible."
""
"A great ale and tasty."
""
"O: Since the overall ABV is not too high (as it can sometimes be in the Old Ale style) and the body is not quite as full, this beer is relatively easy to drink. There are nice flavors and the beer is not overly sweet or cloying which makes this one quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I remember this as a much smoother and stronger beer when I discovered it in the early '90s, especially when I had it in Europe at that time. On draught it was nearly a religious experience! This bottled version is not nearly the beer I remember."
""
""
""
"Not my cup of tea erm bottle of ale! Smell is nice but taste is very strong; too much licorice for mee..."

"Drink- Well I had higher hopes for this one and it just didnt pan out. Cant win em all. Just not what I was thinking it was and then blended too many styles together for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Food match: Complimenting this with a Christmas cake would be a real treat. Main course- char-grilled pork ribs, roast kale, and grilled Mediterranean vegetables, yes!"
""
""
"Something of a disappointment for me though I certainly don't hate it -- it's just a bit too restrained for me and what I expect out of this style. Maybe it was the bottle, I don't know."
"Pours a dark amber brown, a little hazy with some nice tight head that leaves lacing on the sides of glass. Smells of molasses and dark fruit such as dark cherries & apricot. Has some brown sugar notes and some melanoidin malt character. Tastes just like in the nose. Noble hop bitterness in nose with ample bitterness in taste. Feels heavy & thick for a relatively low ABV by today's standards. Feels chewy, almost like a meal within itself. Great tasting old ale. Wish I had more of this in the dead of winter."

""
""
"O: Easydrinking Ale. Very British. Recommended"
""
""
"O: Overall a very mellow beer, perhaps a little too mellow to the point of being slightly lacking. I was expecting a bit more from an old ale, but this is a very good beer, nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours black with no head or lacing. The aroma is of licorice and anise, fairly plain. The flavor leads off with anise followed by a licorice and peppery finish, ordinary. It's mouthfeel is smooth but a bit watery for the style. Theakston Old Peculier is an average beer, recommended."
"O: Ok beer. I found it to be a bit too strong on the caramel flavour but when I had it with orange chocolate it intensified the flavour of the chocolate."
""
""
"Very nice. Poured a 3"" cappuccino head with decent lifespan. The body is a burnt sienna brown color in masstone but held to the light an interesting maroon comes through. It smells complex with malts, vanilla, cocoa, and cola. The tast mirrors the smell and has a substantial malt finish. Gets yeasty in the end. Very nice over all. And it's not the beer which is ""peculiar", it's a historic name."
""
"O: Excellent English Ale – lots of complex flavors and aromas."
"As the beer warms, the tanginess subsides some. Still, I found myself wanting something from this beer that it didn't deliver. It's solid, but I'd like to give it another shot to see if this is a bottle fluke."
""
"I´ve heard about this one before and when I saw it at a beer bar in Mexico I knew what to do"
""
""
""
""
"Taste is deep, less fruits (prunes are in place), more caramel, coffee and nuts. Chewy body and moderate carbonation. Very good old ale."
""
""
""
""
"A quintessential Old Ale, and one that comes in at a reasonable abv of 5.7%. Nice dark brown pour with a moderate off-white head that sticks around and leaves some very nice lacing. Toasty aromas with some slight sherry notes. Similar taste, but a bit more complex. There is a very pleasant rounded nuttiness layered onto the light sherry notes and toasty grain. Some light sweetness, but finishes fairly dry. Very smooth and fairly creamy. An interesting beer that I remember being one of gthe best things available in Georgia before we popped the cap. Very nice still."
""
""
""
"Very drinkable but was hoping for a bit more from this Old style Ale."
"O: A great smooth ride from start to finish, Old Peculier has a wonderful flavor that just gets better as it warms. It has a rich malty flavor that reminds of whiskey, but a nice balance of hops on the finish meld well with the alcohol."
""
"O: Not as impressed as I thought I'd be after all the buildup. Glad I tried it, though. I like the ""Ten Word"" Mystery Contest they have."
""
""
"Drinkability – This is a decent old ale, but a little weak for my taste. I think a little more booziness could have made this nicer. However, at 5.7%abv, it’s extremely drinkable."
"Overall: a great, fun old English beer. Wonderful :) Very smooth and palatable, with the characteristics of the nose coming forward in the flavour. Very malty and rich, not mention warm and roasty. A lovely, lovely brew, but it is still AU$110 a case of 16 x 500mL. This one, though, is well worth it."
""
""
"O: Extremely tasty and drinkable, a favorite to share with my brother when I visit home."
""
"Good, (not great) English beer, with a difference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I still love this beer."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: All that I remember when I had this a few years ago when it was last in the states, and so glad its back. A great ale - pairs nicely with chicken and mashed potatoes, and I think its also good all on its own. Nicely drinkable, wouldn't mind having another one. Overall, a great looking ale with a solidly good taste, aroma, and mouthfeel. For everyone I've ever introduced to this ale, I have yet to find someone who doesn't like it."
"Hands down one of the best old ales I have ever had and one of the smoothest beers. Definitely worth a try and comes highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the English style Old Ale."
"Hell yeah, the legend returns! Glad to see this classic back in the US. This is a deep beer, a thinking beer, as each sip takes you further into its depths. One of the few imports that taught us what beer could be—before the second coming of craft beer—which earns it some extra fondness from us."
"500ml bottle. Pours a dark mahogany brown with a lasting medium brown head and moderate lacing. Aroma and Taste is sweet caramel malt, molasses, brown sugar, dark fruity esters, plums, dates a bit of raisin flavor, yeasty with some mild bitterness. Palate is med to full body with a slightly thick texture and moderate carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, molasses, dark fruit, plums, dates ending with a sweet bitterness for balance. Aroma has some light banana as it warms up as well as the flavor becomes more pronounced. Overall a very good, delicious and enjoyable brew"
"This one is great as a slow sipper but also works well with a meal."
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the best English beers I've had to date...on par with certain Sam Smiths varieties. Sessionable. I highly recommend this variety of its unusual style"
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a ruby red/brown color with an inch tan head that stayed around for a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like caramel malt, dark fruit, chocolate and a bit of banana. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some bready malt and some licorice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating and smooth with a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a solid brew overall, I'd try this again in the future. $2.69 for a single bottle."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very enjoyable beer and well worth a try. *Slightly* expensive for what it is though, you can better ales for cheaper."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky dark brown with a 2 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some candied fruit aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, slight caramel, slight dark fruits, and some herbal hops on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate that quickly fades with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good old ale but it's somewhat mild in the flavor department."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass and it created quite a nice tan head that lasted as I nursed this wonderful beer. Immediately while pouring the aroma of sweet malt flowed out of the glass. Aromas of carmel, alcohol and dark fruits. The taste was amazing. I was truly impressed. Very sweet with carmel and malt. Then dark fruit like flavors and a smack of hops followed by a slight alcohol taste. Body was very nice as well. What a great beer."
""
"Still clings to your ribs as it always did but this lacks the richness and stuffing I vividly remember over twenty years ago. The result of being 'decanted' around a number of breweries over time I would suspect."

"There was copious dust on the bottles when I purchased this six-pack of Theakston Old Peculier at the distributor; I chanced it anyway. This is gorgeous stuff - just beautiful. All right, it's just your average deep dark brown, reddish in hue through strong light, with a copious tan head if you pour dead center. Smells like good Yorkshire Ale, at least the ones I've had in a bottle - the bready yeasty smell that lets you know this is from England, plus a sweet aroma I don't know how to describe. Maybe raisins. Perhaps this is like a perfect marriage between Korbinian and real ale. The maltiness and other characteristic English flavors are all here, but the added dimension of fruit, caramel, and roasted nuttiness makes it extra delicious, but not unreasonably sweet. World class? Absolutely. Do not hesitate to get a six-pack. Perfect for winter. I'm usually a little wary of English dark beer. This is in a class all its own."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark red brown. One finger light tan fine head with good retention and nice lacing. Rich aroma of caramel malt, dark and light fruit, very malty. Flavor follows aroma with caramel and toasted malt, brown sugar, dark fruit with a very mild hop finish. Finish is somewhat abrupt and dry. Flavor is understated, but has a nice progression and is very pleasant to drink. Medium bodied with slight creaminess. Very nice for a moderate ABV old ale."
""
""
"O: This beer is very flavorful without being full-bodied and for this reason is very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy enough to drink."
"Overall this is an excellent beer. There is so much going on here and the balance of flavors is incredible. A top notch beer and one I would love to have on a regular basis."
"This is a decent beer 'with a character all its own'. I agree. A classic. Very mellow for the style, feels like a session beer. I like more heft, more caramel/toffee, more body. But this is a standard, and I can't take that away from Theakston."
""
""
"I had no idea what I was getting into when I bought this beer down the road, but I`m quite happy with it. Nice brown head on it, a very dark reddish brown colour, but not opaque. Smells a little like coffee, and tastes a little like it too - but not overly so. Nice dry finish. Very heavy, probably great with steak. If this beer was available back home, I`d probably buy it all the time. Good stuff!"
"Nice aroma but so-so flavor that isn’t helped by the poor finish."
""
""
""
""
"This brew pours a brown color with a small head. Aroma is of sweet malts, chocolate, and dark fruits. The taste is good, it comes on weak at first, but hits with a strong punch of sweet malts, dark fruits, milk chocolate, and vanilla on the backend. It's almost like a sucker punch of a beer. Doesn't taste like much except some grains until it wallops you right in the taste buds. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and fairly slick, and the drinkability is good. A solid, and indeed, peculiar beer. Give it a shot."
""
"Price point - $4.59/single 12oz."
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Love this beer - great appearance, a complex and unique taste. I'm not good enough at this to quite put my finger on exactly what I'm tasting or why it's so appealing, but it is! It's hard to find this many places, so it's always a welcome surprise when I come across it. Always leaves me motivated for a future buy"
""
"A good beer. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: medium high body, the mouth gets full with a small sip, balanced, some alcohol, sweetness, bitterness, malt flavour, nutty"
"O: I know this beer is legendary, but I really don't get it. I'm not a huge fan of English old ales anyway, and the few I do enjoy tend to be heavier and much more sour than this one. If this beer weren't so sweet and syrupy, I could see myself revisiting it, but as it stands, this one does nothing for me."
""
""
""
"overall .- Good"
""
"O/D - Nice. Very different and interesting. Vanilla and fruit coming together in a wonderful way. Low ABV reppin' hard. Complex and tasty."
""
"Overall a good beer, but seems to lack the oomph of an Old Ale. I would have called this a brown ale in a blind tasting."
"Well, it wasn't as delicious as some of the other Old Ales I've had, but this was the one that got me into the style in the first place. It's still delicious and worth looking into."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle courtesy of Mrs mixylplik3, thanks for the opportunity. Pours a clear dark brown color with ruby highlights when held to light. Decent head and great lace on the way down. Smells of caramel, dark brown sugar, melanoids, dark fruits. This could be a dopplebock the way it smells. Taste is thick, sweet, and filled with dark sugars and fruits. Caramel and other burnt sugar vies for attention from raisins, prunes, and a hint of earth and minerals. Medium to thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a thick chewy mouthfeel. Surprisingly good lower alcohol old ale. I enjoyed this, thanks MJ."
""
"D- aroma promised much but failed to deliver on the palate. Body was just too thin. Can't blame it on an old bottle. Will need to seek out on cask."
"Overall this was really a random pick at my mix-sixer place with a six pack price of 10.99 so for an imported old ale it really was worth the 1.80 price tag and if I seen it again I would get another. Pretty stellar brew."
""
""
""
"Easy-drinking and well-balanced, but the overall impression was a little underwhelming."
"Excellent brew. Would like to try it on tap."
"Overall - It's 150 times more flavorful than most English ales and I remember this being a breath of fresh air when I found it in England (ironic?). With access to over-the-top old ales in the US, it's easy to see how this one would pale in comparison to bourbon-barrel treatments of 15% ABV malt bombs. Not that either concept of an old ale is bad. This one delivers remarkably well in the categories that really matter, which allows it to hold its own."
""
""
""
""
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. The pour is murky, small white head, light lacing. Lots of toffe and sweet caramel on the nose. The flavor is more earthy than the nose lets on, caramel and toffee notes also. The body is medium, light carbonation, no discernable alcohol. A solid brew, the earthy notes don't really work for me."
"Ridiculously drinkable considering the strength (5.7% is on the low end of the scale for old ales, but strong for an English ale). To me this will always be one of the great English ales."
"A very pleasant and drinkable old ale... very dense, but with the low alcohol it is easy to drink. Not the most flavorful or complex old ale, but I still enjoy it."
"One of the best ales I have had from England I have had in a long time!"
"O - Very tasty and drinkable. Undeniably British in every way."
"O- I like this beer because its a very good example of how an old has such a vague interpretation This exemplifies the style better than just about any other beer."
"O/D-I enjoy this beer a bunch. Different, but definitely easy drinking. I would love to see this as a six pack or four pack. At $3.69 a bottle, a good deal too."
"Overall thick rich complex and wonderful. Great beer here even though banana is not a favorite taste of mine."
"An excellent and very drinkable brew."
"Not bad but I wouldn't buy it again."
"This is a wonderful beer full of flavor and richness. Its pleasing in all asspects from the apperance to the smell to the taste and to images one gets drinking this ale."
"O: It was a delight to revisit Theakston Old Peculier which had been out of the country for years. I had it back in the early days, never thought I'd have it again. Good to see it back in the Southland, it's just as good as I remember. A must pickup for any English ale fan."
"Overall: A good find. I enjoy this beer and will be adding it to my rotation. One of the best English ales I've had so far. It reaffirms my belief that the UK offers some of the most unique high quality beers. cheers."
"O- I would definitely buy this again. In saying that, it's not the best of the best but it is still a highly pleasant drink."
"Overall - Good English beer. Definitely have had a few more flavorful ones from the British Isles, but this is a nice beer and would buy again."
"O - a fine example of the style."
"Postscript: The British really know how to do classy. The new bottles (the BA photo is an older one) are works of art, smooth clear brown glass with a carefully placed label with a new gold foil on black design. It resembles a high-end scotch bottle and says something about the quality of what you will find inside. A lot of craft brewers could learn something there, as I've seen labels placed sideways or wrinkled. I know it's nit-picky, but I think there is something to be said for paying attention to detail and your corporate image."
"Overall, a good beer. This seems to have aged well despite the lower ABV..."
"Overall a tasty ale that could be more complex. Mild flavored and enjoyable."

"Oddly the hotel bar serves Brooklyn Lager but the waiter said it didn't sell well and asked me what I would suggest for other American beers."
"Overall - I really enjoyed this beer, quite rich, smooth and easy to drink and the taste lasts quite a while which I like."
"This beer poured out as a deep rich looking black color. Not much light was getting through this one. The head was brown and pretty thin. The smell of the beer smell old and musty, lightly roasted and had some light grains in there too. The taste of the beer was toasted and had some lingering leather flavors in it. The far end of the aftertaste had a light sweetness to it from the malts. This reminded me of Harviestoun's Old Engine Oil a little bit. In all honesty I thought that this beer was better than the Engine oil. The mouthfeel was thinner than the engine oil brew. Overall I found this beer to be enjoyable."
"O - This is one of my favorite Old Ales. Typically I identify old ales as boozy, doing better with a little age, and sugar coated. While this one had all of the smells of an Old Ale, its taste was well balanced and surprisingly drinkable for an old ale."
"This is very drinkable, dark and bitter, beautifully balanced and confident."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2002): Poured from bottle into english pint. Pours a nice ruby color with a small white bubbly head. The aroma is quite nice; sweet nutty and fruity notes, some malts and light toffee also. The taste is very nice; loads of fruitiness, some sweet caramel and toffee, a large malt presence also. A very light bitterness in the finish. Quite vinous and very quaffable. An excellent mouthfeel, creamy and full. Very nice."
"Dr: Hides its ABV well. Very cheap in Belfast. I'd like to try other beers in the style before coming back to this one."
"D - Nice, mature and balanced. It's not the most complex beer, and it doesn't (didn't) make a great session beer, but this is a decent, reliable old ale."
"D: Smooth and plain; it's alright. Ultimately, it's too odd and not to my taste."
"D - Very drinkable despite its richness."
"A good Old Ale in the English style. Lower in alcohol and flavour and nice."
"Carbontion seems high and exacerbates that lack in the mid-section."
"Either way, not an easy one to drink."
"Despite the smell that at first put me off this was a rather pleasant sipping beer. On-tap at Courtfield at Earl's Court."
"This brew pours a very impressive dark chestnut hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a very creamy looking two finger head and some creamy sticky lacing all around the rim,the first aroma i get dark cherries and fruit followed by some roasty dark malts,the mouthfeel is just a little lighter than i was expecting but still just about medium bodied which makes for more than one of which exudes tastes of dark roasty malts first followed up by a nice fruity bitterness which is perfectly balanced out with use of malts and to be quite honest there is another flavour in there that i just cant quite put my finger on but its nice,overall for a old ale its a nice example thats very easy to drink and glad i revisited this fine brew."
"Taste is like an imperial brown. No hops, high alcohol on the palate (way higher than the abv would suggest), nutty, not thick viscosity wise. Brown mead without the sweetness. Or maybe some tea w/ alcohol in it. I'm not an old ale guy, but I have had North Coast's and it isn't my favorite, but its got something going for it in my book at least. Same w/ Port's anniversary beer. Somewhat astringent, which at times, is welcome, given that the other flavors don't resonate as much."
"A bubbly crop of sandy beige foam floats on a cola/coffee-brown body. Root beer comes to mind. The aroma is a heady blend of fruity esters and solid malt sweetness, vanilla and cola mingling with banana, pear, multigrain toast, and carob. Nicely balanced between woodsy hops and a toffee-like malt base, with notes of whole grains, tea, and bitter caramel. The alcohol is detectable, adding a note of whisky, and helping to keep things dry and spicy. Smooth and flavorful, balanced and simple yet nuanced. Quite a nice beer."
"D- As good as it is, I can only do 2 at a time at most with this beer. It's not the ABV (only 5.7%), I don't know what it is, but after 2, I'm done with it. But I surely recommend it!"
"Overall - Diggin't it. Classic English Ale and one that doesn't get as much love as it really deserves unfortunately."
"This was my first love when it came to bottled English ale. Nothing over the top and nothing I can put my finger on but an X factor for me I guess."
"incredibly drinkable - no alcohol is detectable whatsoever, smooth and refreshing mouthffeel and no heavy stickiness, damn, wow...ridiculously drinkable."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Notes: Really nice beer with lots of dark semi-sweet flavors as well as a creamy and smooth feel. However, it isn't too sweet with a balance of roasted bitterness and slight hop bitterness."
"D= I had really high expectations which this beer did not meet. Not a bad beer by any sense of the word, and easily drinkable, but still one I wish had a little more ""oomph"" in the flavor department."
"The old nut brown ale that's a real looked-forward-to treat! Love this stuff! Highly recommended!"
"Geez, don't want to be a nay sayer here, but that's the way of it. Had some of my friends and it was no great shakes. Had a small, short lived head with no lace. Very dark cherry wood color. Light malt nose. Flavor's about the same with some distinct hop. Thin body with ok carbonation. Slight buttery finish. Hint of alcohol. Bottle version was much better."
"D: The first time I had this beer was a year ago in Glasgow and I thought it was a very odd beer. Now that my palate has matured a bit, I can appreciate the complexities that this old ale exhibits... very interesting and complex, something I took for granted the first time I ""had a go at it."""
"Overall, this is an okay beer and certainly, in my opinion, not worthy of being regarded as legendary. It's a good example of the style, but just lacking a certain boldness. It's an easy-drinking brew, but I probably will not try it again for awhile. Maybe I was expecting a little too much, but, I'mnot impressed."
"D: A great English ale. Brilliant for these cold months but I could see myself drinking it all year round. Full flavours that do not overwhelm means you can drink this beer again and again."
"And what a terrific pint it was. The appearence was a a ruby red brown colour with a thin but lasting off-white head. Smelled of warming malts, and subdued dark fruits. The taste was something I could best describe as a mellow doppelbock with the silkiest mouthfeel you could imagine. It really was a smooth mellow ale, with the alcohol (listed as 5.6% on the pump clip) well disguised. Very enjoyable."
"The taste is full, complex, balanced and extremely smooth. It has rich, but restrained and balanced notes of fresh, wet wood, earth, ldry leaves, chocolate, dry toast, licorice, and a little dark fruitiness. It is lightly sweet with just enough bitterness to balance it and round out the taste, before a long, dryish finish with toast, fruit, and wood. The palate is full but lively, with faint oiliness but just enough to add a fuller feel without actually making it oily or slick."
"Great drinkability for this old ale, which would also be an appropriate winter brew."
"D: I really liked this beer and wish it was easier to find. This brew is a great example of high-flavor without high-octane ABV. Theakston pulls it off excellently."
"Bourbon escaped the bottle the moment the cap bent. Cherry plum, grape, and fig ride the nose. The body is muddy grape and poo poo. Taste upfront with malt. Toffee hint then sappy fig with followed by pirate barrel. A crashing dry gate seals round one then round two begins with yeast creaping from under. Fruity, bit tangy, followed by moldy bordello floor. A port wine to finish an array of desserts. Complex and peculiar."
"Dark opaque brown in body. Tang, woody, old maple, slight burnt sugar in the nose; the English standard. Flavors of tang, wood, old maple, English yeast, diacetyl, a bit medicinal in the aftertaste. A smooth, slightly syrup feel to this medium-heavy bodied brew. Uniquely drinkable with a mix of strange flavors that leave the palate curious for more."
"Overall impression: A classic, wonderful English Old Ale. Easy sipping by the fire and just as enjoyable any time of year. Can't believe I've overlooked this for so long. Strongly recommended."
"D - it is drinkable but not great so I probably wouldn t go there again any time soon"
"Overall, meh, probably wont be revisiting this one anytime soon, but not terrible, just would rather buy a good dobble bock personally, about the same experience, just not as good..."
"Overall: I don't know what makes it so peculiar but it is good."
"This is my first old ale and I'm not sure if it's a style I can really get into. Still a very good beer that I could see myself ordering in the future."
"This is my first Old Ale, and after this, certainly not my last. This style is very intriguing to me, and this beer has justified that."
"When drinking beer of this type, I think it is important to consider it as a choice with food, and I can see how this would pair well with many British dishes."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very good, flavorful beer with some substance that is worth drinking for a long time."
"d: Split with my dad while watching the Phillies lose. We both agreed that this was okay, but not something we'd seek out again."
"Pours dark brown with some tinges of red and a small brown head. Smells of caramel malts and molasses without much else. Heavily malty taste with some slight toastiness, along with brown sugar. Sweet finish with only a hint of bitterness throughout. Has a kind of tea character, actually. Medium body with moderate carbonation."
"Old Peculier is a really nice, well-rounded Old Ale. I like it. It doesn't have enough depth or character to attain excellence, but it's no doubt very good. Despite originating in England, I prefer more recent American renditions of the style. Founder's Old Curmudgeon and North Coast's Old Stock Ale come to mind. Those seem to have a deeper and more satisfying flavor, in addition to a significantly gratuitous bump in abv. For some reason, that seems to work for me. Nonetheless, Old Peculier is very good and is easily recommended."
"Overall- Despite the lower ABV and body, this beer possesses a fair bit of complexity. Pretty good!"
"Wow, this was a great beer. Nice dark coulor good head, not too heavy decent beer that could go with light and heavy foods. the smell was not too impressive but it was very tasty. loved this one a great find as far as new beers go. will definiately be picking up another one of these agian."
"D- I'd give it an overall ""Meh"". nothing special, not much going on, but not bad or offensive at all. Maybe my old ale is too..um..old."
"Pours a very dark red colored body, clearish looking, with a big foamy gray-white colored head, lasting. Has a malty watery aroma, odd. Almost newcastle skunky. Dusty, and musty. Sweet malty taste. Newcastle/Irish Red-like. Watery, somewhat musky."
"D - Conversely, very easy to drink!!!"
"D- OK but nothing special going on here. Smells better than it tastes."
"36/50"
"A decent beer not the best ever but pretty good."
"I really liked this beer and was surprised with how good it is. I could see enjoying several of these."
"Overall I'd say this is VERY drinkable. One would be satisfying, but I could easily drink a few more."
"12 oz. bottle. Nice amber pour with a lasting cream colored head. Malt and peaty aromas. Tastes similarly with some toffee and smoke. Minimal fruits to me. Pretty dry and clean finish. A little thin, but very drinkable. Not one of those blast you in the face, but good and worth trying."
"i know it's a totally different style of beer, but this really reminded me of a thinner Warsteiner Dunkel."
"Drinkability: Very smooth drinking beer, quite sessionable!"
"D- Easy to drink for sure, goes down smooth."
"Pours a deep brown with a small bubbly head that falls quickly with no lacing. The aroma is that of roasted barley. The flavor is roasty and toasty, with a decent dark malt bite. There is a hint of buckwheat honey on the tongue, but the beer falls away quickly leaving almost no aftertaste except a slight whiff of sourness. The mouthfeel is thin and unremarkable. An ok beer, but nothing worth losing sleep over."
"Overall: I am very surprised by this beer is is mellow and very easy to drink . I like this beer. The mouth feel is slightly astringent with an easy and slight bitter finish. There is a little bit left on the palate after the beer goes down. A good beer easy to drink"
"Though I didn't especially like this beer I wanted more when it was finished. Wierd."
"Conclusion: I typically prefer the brewery on the other side of Masham, but Theakston's has a real winner here...it's deft. a lighter version of an English Old Ale, but it's got really nice flavors and immense drinkability. Well done!"
"Mouthfeel: Kinda thin. Thinner than I expected at least."
"Feels great on the tongue. Would definitely drink again, just watch out for that 5.7 ABV."
"D: Very drinkable...especially with the low ABV. I haven't had this beer in a few years and I remember it as a decent beer...now that I have it in front of me it's actually pretty damn good."
"D- a very sweet old ale which is great but not excellent. This would fill me up quick. Not a good sessionable beer but a nice beer to have with dinner."
"Pours dark mahogany with a fluffy beige head. Aroma is very malty with some caramel, cream, and grapes. The mouthfeel and taste are silky smooth. A lot like an ESB in flavor, but without the astringent bitterness. There was some fruitiness, but more malt and sourdough-like bite. I really liked this one."
"Not complex, but very flavorful. Really good taste, and a solid bouquet. A good quaff that certainly won't make you think ""ale", at any point from the moment it hits the glass, until the final aftertaste fades away."
"Pours a dark brown color with a tan head that is thick and creamy. Aroma is that of caramel, a hint of floral hops and has a toffee smell to it too. Tastesis like an English ale should taste like, smooth and creamy. Not too heavy on the malt, taste some brown sugar as well as some chocolate. Good carbonation and lacing throughout. This beer is very crisp and refreshing has a slightly bitter aftertaste (slightly bitter) could drink this beer all night."
"Drinkability - exceptional. This stuff makes you want to get another drink as soon as the first sip leaves. One of the most drinkable beers I've ever tried. This would be an amazing session brew!"
"A great old ale, a classic. Its very similar to the Granite brewery version, the did a good job emulating this."
"The aroma is malts (sweet), booze, and dark fruit. The appearancew is an attractive red/brown, minimal head. The flavor is sweet malt, caramel and toffee. The palate was also sweet, but with a nice subtle touch of bittering hops. Thick mouthfeel. This reminded me somewhat of a porter or a stout. Nice beer overall."
"(Much less impressive on bottle. Short and crippled. ""Dead."")"
"I was not impressed with this offering. It is not bad, just uninspired and bland."
"D: could easily go another one. Cannot wait to try some more."
"Pours a very deep, hearty red color. Doesn't seem to be too much aroma wise, hence it getting my lowest score. Taste wise it's very interesting... first gulp is of malts, as it goes down it has a nice sweetness to it which lingers for a while... definitely not expected. A pretty solid beer I must say, I'd definitely try it again."
"D - This is a definite one-at-a-time beer. It tasted great, but is a little of the sweet side and I could see myself getting sick of it if I had too many at once."
"D- Old P'seculiar a pretty unique beer. Very tasty. Very enjoyable. Not really a session beer, but I can't say I would ever turn one of these down."
"d. Very drinkable for an Old Ale. While most Old Ales are superb for sipping, this one is on the verge of sessionability. Yes, sessionability. The flavors, while not over the top, are definitely there to make it an excellent experience and definitely worth trying once, if not falling head over heels for in the end."
"A lot of character and a superior balance make this a real treat. Seek out the Old Peculier at bars and liquor stores and stock up a bit. I hope to see this on draft somewhere stateside, but might be out of luck. Oh well, I'd better enjoy this one!"
"D- Easily drinkable but leaves a bit to be desired. A bit more maltiness would have been great and balanced out the oak. Perhaps my bottle was old. Would I have it again? Possibly.."
"My idea of Old Ale is more like North Coast Brewing's version. This is supposed to be the prototype but I was not that impressed."
"After all of that, why the lower drinkability rating? This is not a session beer. Wonderful flavors, scent, texture, - everything. Masterful in structure, but hard to do more than 2 in a row."
"All around pretty good. Bitterness and heavy carbonation make it a little difficult for me to have more than one at a time, however."
"Had some friends who always talk about how peculier the Old Peculier is. With a name like that, you're asking for it. Let's see for ourselves. A very deep dark brown brew with a quickly fading dark tan head. No lacing is left behind. Smells of molasses, nuts and some dark fruits such as raisins. There's also a boozy essence involved. Tastes a bit sweet and nutty up front with some smokey malts in the middle and spice and alcohol in the back. Medium to full bodied. Carbonation is fairly active and quick. The Old Peculier is a bit different, but in a good way."
"A beer I first tried out of a cask at the Old Dungeon Ghyll Hotel in the Lake District far too many years ago. I'm very happy to know that OP is still a damn fine beer. In the bottle I find it a little too carbonated but aroma, taste and enjoyment hardly suffer for it. Very well-balanced with an understated malty sweetness and a nice finish that shouldn't offend anyone who doesn't like that hit of hops as their beer slides down the back of their throat. A very easy - and very pleasurable - beer to drink."
"The beer is not heavy or tiring to drink, but what flavor there is comes across as pretty simple and one dimensional. This is a pleasant enough beer, but it will probably be some time before I order it again. There are just too many other interesting beers out there."
"Very dark and brown in color with a tan brown head. Faint malty earthy smell...faint rum-like alcohol. Tastes of sweet roasted chocolate malt with a bit of earthy funk. Not too thick, moderate mouthfeel. Sorry this review is short but this beer is actually rather simple... not overly flavorful, which is just fine... reminds me of xingu I guess... Light dark fruit shows up as it warms."
"I could certainly drink a few of these in a session."
"Poured a dark reddish brown color with a good sized frothy tan head. The aroma is very malty with a touch of alcohol. The dark fruit smells are glorious. Smells like en EPA mixed with a dark belgian ale. Hops come though in the taste to balance out the malt. There is an interesting earthiness to this brew. Moderate feel and incredible drinkability. At 5.7% I think I would drink this as a session beer."
"This beer is very deep dark brown with ruby highlights in the glass with a thinnish tan head that laces a bit. The smell is dark caramel malt, dark fruit and light chocolate/coffee tones that are sweet not astringent. There is also a bit of light flowery hop and even some slightly funky earthy tones. The taste starts out as creamy sweet malts and rum soaked fruits this quickly gives way to more bitter hops and roasted grain. The finish is never ending coarse grain, alcohol spice and hoppy bitterness with a bit of a sweet overlay. The mouthfeel is good, super smooth with low carbonation and great flavors that linger forever and invite the next sip. Overall a good beer, satisfying whether you drink just one or plan on a small session. There is nothing peculiar about it this just a good beer."
"Overall, a decent brew. Interesting. Nothing to go out of your way for but worth a try."
"M + D: Light carbonation, medium to full body, and quite refreshing on the finish. With an alcohol content on the lighter side, it is an excellent beer to enjoy a few at a time with all the flavours of some bigger brews. Perhaps not a summer day drinker, exactly (or maybe it is, depending on what you like!) but a very good, every day beer. Could reasonably be sessionable for a nice afternoon out."
"Pours a dark brown color with hints of purplish-red, a finger's worth of foam that recedes rather quickly leaving behind little lacing. Smell is very fruity up front, with hints of apple. Smells almost like a BSDA. Taste is very sweet and malty. Barely any hop presence, but the fruity malts, with hints of sourness and a bit of roastiness mingle nicely. Keeps getting sweeter as it warms, hints of raisins, some earthiness pops up and quickly leaves. It sounds strange but I'm picking some hints of grape soda?? Weird, but interesting. Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, light to medium bodied. An overall nice brew and my first of this style. I would greatly like to try some more old ales in the future."
" I can't wait to have an assortment of meats and cheeses with this classic English brew."
"D- a very good brew, it seems to pack more of a punch than most beers in this alcohol range. i'd like to try more of this style and see how they compare."
"A great beer that I am happy to have revisited...and will again."
"D - This is a very nice old ale. Very complex flavors."
"An excellent brew. Too bad it took me so long to revisit this."
"MF&D - Creamy with good enough carbonation to give your tongue a slight sizzle. Overall a good session ale that I would definitely drink again."
"For an Old Ale, I am surprised at how light this beer is. That's not a bad thing, especially when consuming it in warmer weather. Very pleasant, mellow aroma of chocolate and honey or maple; not very bubbly; nice and tasty. Not too toasty, not overly malty, and ever so slightly bitter. All in all, a pleasant surprise. Lovely mahogany color. A good dark beer to try on those who might normally shy away from such things. Worth repeating!"
"D = This is pretty easy drinking but it is a little light for the style and I didn't care too much for the mouthfeel."
"Pours a deep brown with a beautiful head which lingered nicely for a while before it settled to the rim. The initial taste is a smooth malty sensation that will have you going back for more and the finish just reinforces what can only be described as an immideiate affection. I love this beer."
"D - It's not surprise that a beer that tastes this good is very drinkable. Only drawback is that I'll be sad when it's gone"
"Overall, an enjoyable brew...I may try to find a newer bottle to judge better on its drinkability."
"This is something that I would definitely seek out in a six pack, and not just buy a bottle every once in a while. It seems best suited for spring or autumn nights - nothing so thick that it'd warm you up while it's snowing out, but not quite the refresher you'd want while grilling on a hot sunny day."
"Pours a musky dark brown, with a beige head that laces quite well. Nose does work with a load of brown sugar, cinnamon. The palate is very bakery/sugary, with dark bread covered in yeast. Great initial entry, but mid-finish leaves a watery mouthfeel with sugar. The beer isn't overly sweet, so it's quite sessionable. Decent at best."
"Dark and cloudy brown in color with a nice creamy head. This beer was fairly interesting. It had a flavor of dark malts, caramel, coffee, dark fruit, and a strange vegetable-like quality (almost like celery). The feel was a little syrupy. Not bad, but a little too sweet and tangy, which hurts the drinkability. My wife knocked into my glass with her purse and spilled some beer on my hand and it glued my fingers together."
"Solid pour into my pint glass, it appears dark murky brown, almost as dark as a porter, and on top forms a 2 cm thick head of foam. Aroma is mild and pleasant, dark malts, yeast, toffee, and a whiff of rubbing alcohol. The taste is bolder than I was expecting. Darker brown ale? Dark pale ale? The two together? Mild yeast flavor, sweet and very well balanced. A fine ale indeed."
"pours a cloudy dark brown with a quarter inch light tan head that faded quickly with some lace that faded also. smells of dark fruits, prunes, raisins, toffee. taste is slightly sweet with roasted malt, fruity, rock candy and toffee. weak watery mouthfeel and carbonation was also weak. if i saw something better i would pass on this one."
"D: This stuff is excellent. Low ABV makes it sessionable. It's not really heavy at all for such a dark beer. The malty sweetness of the beer is incredible. This one would be wonderful after dinner or when hanging out with some friends. I could drink this stuff all night. This is one of my father's favorite brews and I see why."
"The beer smells dark roast and some sweetness in the vein of the dark fruits. The best thing about this beer is the complex flavour. It has fruit, then a cream flavour, then a dark roasted taste. This beer is fucking solid. The flavours constantly change on your tongue. It's so god damn balanced it's drinkable. The mouthfeel is slightly thin, but it works for the beer. I could easily drink many of these."
"drinkbility is good. this is a mild brew that harnesses the qulaities of the flavors present, and creates a solid composition that is wonderfully easy to drink. an excellent old ale."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. The taste is very interesting. I was preparing myself to not anticipate anything peculier from this beer, but its name is fitting. I don't know quite what to make of it. It's very enjoyable and interesting."
"i had this one at a bar a few weeks ago & got one to try ; pours a deep garnet-brown w/ a thin head which dissipates quickly leaving little lacing ; a strong, vinous smell, dark fruit and alcohol stand out only slightly over a buttery diacetyl/burgundy nose ; slighly sweet brandy/sherry-like flavor, minimal hop bitterness w/ a slightly nutty note about midway, finishes well w/ a hot alcoholic/woody undertone ; a light-med. body and mild carbonation make this one a bit thin, but not too thin ; a decent brew for sure, i'll have to get some more of these next time i beer shop..."
"D: Quite a unique beer that I have to be in the right mood for. Good with hearty food. I'd only do two of these in one session."
"D - Not bad. Drank this on a friends recomondation. It was plesant but I was hopeing for a little more substance."
"M/D - Rich, creamy and smooth. A nice easy beer to sip on."
"Very dark brown with reddish glints in the light, quite clear. Aroma of molasses and fruity malt. I was quite surprised at the sweetness evident here - molasses and chocolate hints; it's not overdone and balanced with some darker notes, complexity and a lingering bitter component. Excellent with blue cheese, for savoring rather than glugging."
"Drinkablity: Great ale, very enjoyable."
"Pours a nice tan colored head which fades to a nice lace - low carb. Dark brown in color. Not much in aroma, some spices detected. Sweet in flavoe, kind of like a light McEwans. I like the taste though, malty and sweet. Very drinkable and could be a nice tasty session ale. Recommended."
"Overall this was a decent, drinkable beer, but nothing too exciting and nothing to write home about..."
"D - 3.5 Refreshing and enjoyable, but more of an one and done variety..."
"D - Not bad flavor when you taste it at first, but that's the only time you can, almost bland. Maybe a good transition beer. I don't know why this rates so high. Maybe I got a bad sample because this shares very few characteristics that are highly praised by other reviewers."
"Overall, a pretty drinkable beer. Nothing particularly interesting or outstanding, but a very solid brew."
"Tasty, light, drinkable. Don't know much about Old Ale's, but this one is quite enjoyable."
"This is a classic, I can drink a bunch of it."
"Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer. It has a solid taste and isn't quite as heavy as you might think by looking at it."
"I could drink this quite often but it's a bit hard to find around these parts."
"D - This beer impresses me. Manages to be just big enough to warm, but not so big as to lose the subtleties that can make a beer worth contemplating. Wish to revisit frequently."
"A very old school British beer, seems a bit quaint compared to today's penchant for big beers."
"Pours with a nice thick head, lots of fisheyes. Color is a dark red, brown. Smell is faint, sweet and bready. First taste is a nice toasted sweetness. There is a very malted and bready character to it, with a crisp carbonation. The flavor fades fast, ending on almost a metalic copper note. One of my favorite english ales."
"This beer pours a dark blackish-brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather slowly into decent lacing. The aroma is malty with lots of toffee, caramel, and a hint of chocolate. The taste is has more caramel than the aroma, with a long lasting toffee finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer that I could easily drink again."
"behind a lot of hops or alcohol."
"Very dark reddish, just a few shades from black. Decent head if you give it a vigorous pour. Smell is very subtle - you really have you get your nose right up to it to detect it. Mostly just the tells of a sweet ale, but some kind of interesting fruit underneath it all. That fruit, which becomes apparant in the taste, reminds me the most of lovely overripe plum. A sharp and short bite of hops and alcohol follow, leaving a bit of sweetness and roasted malt lingering at the end. Faint diacetyl that doesn't get in the way too much. Not an incredibly complex ale, but more so than the average british beer on the shelf. Drinkability's fine. A solid choice."
"Like the embers of a dying fire, this one gives a slow, even, comforting warmth, not from the alcohol, but from its color, balance and general richness. Tales of its stature on cask leave me day-dreaming of finding myself in a Yorkshire pub someday."
"Pours dark amber/brown. The head is rather light in both color and weight and it settles quickly. There is a sweet taste initially, followed by a slight bitter aftertaste. Nice, balanced malt flavor. Good drink-ability, definitely a good one for a hot day. Very good, simple ale."
"Tastes rich bready maltness just like the nose implies. A light cherry flavor in the front. Noticed a light herbal, earthy hop flavor(maybe fuggles?) A tinge of roasted character, and a hint of smoke in the taste as well. Nicely balanced. Yummy, long finish on this one. Actualyl a light hop character there and some dry maltiness, as well as th roast. Quintessential example of lighter version of old ale."
"Drinkability was excellent, especially for this dark English beer. Definitely would drink this one again and buy some to cellar if I had easy access to 6-packs of this. Overall, a truly excellent job."
"Pours a very lovely, deep ruby. When not held to the light, it looks like a deep brown. Not muchof a head or bubbling, all color. A very swee, malty, fruity aroma greets my nose. Notes of sugared figs and oher candied fruits bring up a great malt nose. The taste is a very complex malt bill with just enough hops to not make this beer taste like candy syrup. Hints f prunes, bown sugar, and fruit cake mixed with roasted malts. Great feel to this palate. smooth and sweet. Hard to be very sessionable though because of the sweetness."
"Pours an extremely dark brown. Nose is almost like smoky wood. Touch of caramel in there. Flavor is extremely smooth. A bit lighter than some old ales out there, but still carries a nice slight woody character to it. Smooth caramel flavor there. More like, caramel out of the heart of a tree. Feel has a nice level of carbonation and a good liquid feel. Overall this one is very drinkable. Not the most complex old ale by any means, but definitely smooth and well made."
"Pours dark brown with red tints in the light. Good head dissipates fast. Nose is malty with dark raisiny plum tones. The taste seems more scotch style to me. Malty and creamy, dark plum and raisin. Burnt sugar. Mouthfeel is very much scotch/yorkshire in smoothness. Very drinkable, as it should be. I really like the darker flavors in this brew but it does have a peculier (haha) bite to the finish. Not bitter, very smooth, but has a non floral mini hop bite without any obvious hop flavors. Good session brew."
"Overall - I was impressed. I'm not a fan of true English beer, yet found it quite tasty. I did not have any trouble getting to the bottom of the glass and would not hesitate drinking another if I had one. I'd even go so far as to experiment with food pairings. That says a lot considering I'm more of a sweet IPA/stout fan. Very good job."
"The beer poured a dark brown with purplish red highlights and next to no head. The beer smells of malts and perhaps a few subtle fruity notes. The taste starts off with some sweet malts and finishing with some dark fruity raisins. The mouthfeel is pleasant with a fair amount of carbonation. I would consider this beer to be fairly drinkable, and could see myself possibly reaching for another."
"D- An impressive amount of flavor and complexity for a lower ABV beer. Definitely worth checking out."
"I haven't had the Peculier for probably three years, I wish I hadn't waited so long. Even though this is vastly different than what I normally drink, it has a good flavor profile that I enjoy a lot."
"One of the best beers I've had yet. Dark copper/brown with a creamy head. The smell is as enticing as anything I've ever encountered: a kind of warm, rich molasses and malt combo that just makes your mouth water. Taste is similar to some Belgian ales, Chimay Red coming immediately to mind (that's a good thing, btw): very ""deep", with hints of butter and dried fruit. The 5.7 ABV is amazing considering the complexity and richness. Absolutely a must-drink."
"This beer is a real treat. I didn't have overly high expectations but was pleasantly surprised. The beer doesn't have much head, retention, or lacing. The beer is medium to full bodied, and lacks carbonation, but that's not a bad thing in this case. The beer's smell is very nice. You'll get those dark, deep, sweet malts, caramel, toffee, and raisin. The taste largely follows suit, but there is a bit more dryishness to this beer, a slightly more sourish hoppy end, and some other complexity that makes this a very nice option. The mouthfeel is very nice, a little syrupy, a little creamy. The aftertaste is moderate. This beer is well worth seeking out, and it definitely spoiled me for some other beers I was trying afterwards."
"Dark brown with ruby edges and a thin tan head. Traces of lacing but nothing spectacular in the lacing department. Smells of alcohol, rich malts, and some caramel. Taste is sweet malt with caramel. A slight hop balance rounds out the taste. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth with a strong bitter finish. Enjoyable. Give it a try."
"Drinkability was not as good, a bit too English for me."
"D - Not something for everyday drinking but it is a nice, tasty drop. Well worth a go."
"D: Overall a good beer to drink. I would definitley drink it again."
"this beer was very drinkable for a dark beer, I drank it and I hardly even knew it. It poured extremely dark red when held up to the light you can barely see through it. There was a slight smell but I couldnt quite finger it. Mouthfeel was good thin but yet had some body, it was nice. I feel as if the taste was not quite there, there was something missing. As a side note is in my girlfriends top ten favorite beers."
"A good solid British ale that has a unique flavor and a nice texture. I still haven't made up my mind if I like the wine-like flavor that keeps popping up, but so few beers have it that I don't really care."
"This is a fine beer from our mates in Engerland. Steady, firm, nothing flashy. Just good beer. And at 5.7%, a quality session beer for sure. Old Peculiar. Old delicious."
"Not sure of how many of these I'd want in one sitting, but it's a good sipping beer."
"Pours out a nice deep brown with a fair amount of head and some really nice lacing. Has a great scent, a nice bourbon cask aroma with a little bitterness. Has a good taste, a little smoky and a bit more alcohol in the flavor than would be expected from a relatively low ABV, but a very pleasantly sweet taste compared to the scent. Goes down really nice. I'll have more."
"Taste: Nice, rich malty introduction, but in the middle there's a medicinal taste while the taste balances out and the hops come in. Hop profile was wet and kind of reminded me of tea. Strange, but not too bad. Very smooth as well, which was a big plus."
"The beer poured a dark ruby with a tan head. The aroma was light, but had sweet malt and hints of hops. The taste had a malty start, that was quickly countered with a rush of hops to give it a nice bitter taste. The feel was medium and wet. A nice solid dark ale that would be a good choice if you wanted one a little more bitter."
"Pours dark brown but translucent with maroon highlights and a head that vanishes fast, leaving a thin film and some bubbles. Smells a bit sour and of vinegar with a hint of apples and sweet fruits. Very strong malt presence (almost Belgian at first) in the flavor but with a thin body overall. Slight toasted bread flavor and some lingering tartness related to the original vinegar smell. Hops manifest themselves mildly. Its not blowing me away, but I wouldnt turn it down at the pub."
"Drinkability is great. There is enough complexity to keep your taste-buds interested, and a low enough ABV to make this sessionable. Get some and enjoy."
"Dark brownish red pour, nearly black; no head. Smell was rich, sweet, and malty. Taste was heavy with dark, cooked fruit such as raisins and figs, but not as sweet as the smell would have suggested. Mouthfeel, while certainly full bodied, was smooth and easy to drink. I found this enjoyable, but a little weaker in flavour, and much weaker in abv than I would have expected from an Old Ale. Still a good drink."
"Pretty good, but an unusual mix of flavours. I'd say this one grows on you."
"tastes of toasted bread crust, also seems to have a slight malt vinegar note. bitterness is nice and plays well into a pleasant aftertaste."
"It pours a rich deep brown, about the color of cola, and not much of a head. The strong aroma is malty with a hint of toffee and even a bit of cola-like scent. Rich flavor is strongly malty with some hop bitterness and a whisper of toffee. This is a very tasty and satisfying ale, good either on its own or with a meal."
"Drinkability: Great. This is an extremely drinkable old ale. Very nice with a quality stogie!"
"Medium dark brown with light tan head that hung around a while. A different kind of taste that I really cant put a finger on what it tastes like. Aroma is of fruit, licorice and caramel. Taste is of dark cherries, toffee and chocolate upon further review. Mouthfeel is good with proper carbonation. Lacing on glass was good."
"D- Not bad, but not spectacular. I don't know the ideal time to drink this one as it's too light for a beer to ponder, but too dark for casual consumption. A good counter for those who claim dark beers are all heavy though."
""
"Drinkability: I liked this beer a lot and thought it was very drinkable. To my taste buds this is sort of a hybrid of a porter, a strong scotch ale, and a dark english ale (which are all good to me!) Definately worth trying."
"Smooth in a medium to full body. Despite complexities, and a touch of raw, oily touch on the palate, this goes down very easily and begs for more. A wonderful, classic example of the stlye."
"Have had this as a go-to for years, which I consider a good thing."
"Creamy mouthfeel with good body, finish is lightly bitter and full of herbal goodness, retaining a mild smokiness or lactic acidic flavor. Interesting dark english brew."
"Poured into my Hennepin glass. The beer and head fills it nicely to about a 1/2 inch from the brim. The head settles a bit from about an inch high to a very firm 1/4 inch of creamy foam. The smell is quite peculier (LOLOLOL!!!) with a malty roasted base and a smell that resembles either carrot or corn husk. Slight grassy hops toward the end. The taste is also interesting. It reminds me a lot of a german schwarzbier but with a little less sweetness and a little more hop presence. Bitter metallic hops follow the drink leaving a mouthfeel similar to an APA or very mild IPA. There s also a bit of an earthy porter-like effect after a few more sips. Much lighter in body than a porter, but very similar hop profile. This beer covers all the bases of several beers I've had including chocolate stout, cream porter, APA, schwarzbier, and english brown ale. It's a good thing they call it an old ale, because I have yet to have two old ales that are strikingly similar."
"This is good, but a little underwhelming. More like a mix of a porter and German dark lager than an old ale...or just not what I prefer an old ale to be (Bell's Third Coast Old Ale is still tops). I was hoping for more ""oldness"" from an old brewery. But still, it's solid and I'd never kick it outta my snifter."
"disappointing; we'll see. :)"
"Pours a deep dark ruby brown with plenty of creamy tan head that clings to the glass and takes forever to fade. Smells very malty and a little chocolatey, with a hint of pepper. The taste is also very malty and sweet. There's also a little raisin there as well. A tasty brew. The mouthfeel is very creamy and heavy, excellent. Overall, it's an awesome porter, and very drinkable, especially if you're a fan of dark beers."
"The mouthfeel is silky smoth and the carbonation is on the light side; that, too, makes for some excellent drinkability. It's been a lot of years since I've had this and I don't recall liking it this much. Nothing like a more educated palate. lol"
"Medium body, slightly sticky. Smooth finish, mild bitterness."
"D- Very good. I will probably buy this again and will be getting a few pints of this when I go to England in the summer."
"Maybe next time the head will stick around... that would help. Very nice flavors but not overpowering. Probably a good bridge beer for people afraid of dark beers. Overall this beer is very easy to like. It just begs you to have another one. And I think I will..."
"Bottle into snifter. A: Very clear, dark brown with a few red tones when held up to the light, a moderate amount of head. S: Very malty, maple syrup and molasses, but augmented nicely with vague bannanas, almost a complete lack of hops. T: Im still getting those bannanas in back of all the sweetness and maltiness. M: Low carbonation, surprisingly light. D: Theres a lot to explore here, something I will definitely buy agin."
"D= goes down easily, and at the reasonable 5.7ABV it should be quite a session beer if you're in the mood for something like this style."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a deep brown, with no head, and no lacing. The aroma is slightly fruity, mostly a raisin smell. The taste is slight roasted malt, along with a dark raisin flavor, and a hint of alcohol. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, this appears to be a sipping beer. I'm not sure what it is about the taste, but the mix, just doesnt do it for me. Its just an odd flavor."
"d: a decent beer at best that just didn't deliver"
"A fine British ale. I wish more American craft brewers would knock it off with the bushels of little fluffy pine cones, and see if they couldn't make something like this."
"Pours a black liquid with a bit (a cm or so) of head. Aroma is a faint amount roastiness with a lot of red wine characteristics. Flavor is some roastiness with additional red wine fullness. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and somehow thick. I didn't find this very drinkable, and I didn't really enjoy this."
"This is one of my favorite drinking beers. Very, very well done."
"Pours a pretty solid black color with a small tan head. Head disappeared completely and left little lace, but still, the beer looked good. Dense aromas of alcohol soaked fruit float float to the nose. Very rich flavors of vanilla, spice, and dark chocolate covered fruits. It's quite complex and sweet overall, with a certain hop bitterness at the end. Nice mouthfeel and fine carbonation. Drinkabilty is high considering all the flavors in this brew."
"Easy and pleasant to drink, but mildly disappointing given the thin mouth - I prefer it heavier on the malts, and the national ""equivalent"" from Bell's I had for comparison on the same night beats it easily."
"Overall, a very enjoyable after dinner beer due to its mellow flavor and mouth feel. I enjoyed the entire bottle but wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting."
"Nice, heavy, rich Dark Ale."
"Reviewed the beer as a bottle serving about two weeks ago and though the cask is good, perhaps expected a little more."
"Overall: This is a classic English old ale, and it deserves its reputation as a world class beer. Better head retention and a lighter touch with the carbonation would made it a truly outstanding beer. Those of the American interpretations that stay away from additions of American hops often surpass this one, though. I wonder what this would be like from a hand-pulled cask?"
"Drinkability is good. It would be quite easy to enjoy two or three of these at a sitting. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel was medium, with a clean finish. There's a good chance you can drink a few of these at a time. It's highly drinkable. And recommended if you like old ales or English porters."
"Overall, very nice brew."
"Mouthfeel was a bit thin, and while it is a well crafted and tasty beer, I couldn't drink more than two of these in a sitting due to the sweetness."
"From the 12 oz bottle, poured a deep, opaque river-bottom muddiness and a frothy whipped head. With a deep sugary nose, the full-bodied flavors don't exactly sneak up on your palate. Sweet and sugary with a toffee-fullness. Pleasantly bittered, but with a sweet almost black grape essence at the very end. Makes me crave some smoked almonds. (#2667, 1/28/07)"
"Pours very dark brown with some ruby highlights on the edges. Delicate tan head that leaves some thin lacing and a collar. Aromas are nicely sweet, with molasses and butterscotch/diacetyl notes that mingle together nicely and are never overdone. On the palate, the diacetyl is less dialed-down and a bit more out of wack at higher temperatures, but at lower temperatures the palate is nicely malty and sweet, showing highlights of chocolates and molasses. Very smooth mouthfeel, with slick malts and only minimal carbonation making for a drink that feels surprisingly light for an old ale. Overall, this is a good old ale, and an especially good option given its availability in the US compared to other beers of the style."
"The beer does taste old, but the oxidized character works well and gives it a distinctive taste and mouthfeel. A very big 5.7% ABV beer."
"Not bad, not my favorite. Id try again."
"Overall, a good beer and recommended."
"D - A bit more body and a kick up in the alcohol would make this beer stand out even more and allow some extra room for more complexity, but I really don't have any complaints. This is a very good beer, and a good example of the style."
"This was one hell of a beer. Incredibly smooth. Not very bitter. A good chocolate malty flavor with a good alcohol balance. A beer that warmed me up and that I will seek out in cold wheater. The smell added so much to this beer. Oh man. CHOCOLATE MALT LOVERS MUST TRY THIS!!!"
"An excellent beer. I think this is the first of its style I've had, but I look forward to trying more if this beer is representative."
"D - Not too shabby, I'd drink it again. It isn't amazing, but it is drinkable and pleasant. More of a dessert beer, but you could have it with some choice foods."
"Extremely drinkable as this beer is not only ridiculously tasty, but at 5.7% abv, it's not so much a knock out beer. Tremendous session capabilities. I'm gonna have to buy more of these!! Total blindbuy and am blindsided!"
"Overall not a bad beer, but I was expecting more."
"Drinkability - overall a good beer for those who prefer a mild malty brew."
"Nothing really fruity or hopbitter, just strongly leaning on the roasted malts and somewhat one-dimensional. Do I miss something here?"
"Dang, what happenned? Where'd that huge BANG of flavour go? I remember this brew being a big whack of dark malt and chocolate malts, finishing dry and fruity, big and strong, with a huge body. I think I must have got a re-badged bottle. This brew has hints of what it used to be like, but unless my palate has changed that much, they've tweaked the Old Pec. The mouthfeel is thin and a bit watery, very peculiar. The bottle says ""based on an old family recipe"". Maybe they lost the original and this is the best they could come up with?"
"Pours an intriguing dark stained leather color with ruby accents. Head is light, some-what sudsy, but capped with a tight layer. Smells of sweet cooked caramel, grain and light dose of hops. Thinner than I would like from this style of beer and lacking a great finish. Moderately balanced but drinkable."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a nice head. The smell is sweet and malty. The taste is very sweet and malty. The mouthfeel is full and slightly chewy. This isnt the beer I remembered from years ago when I first tasted it. It is very drinkable and pleasant!"
"The taste also has malts in abundance, but it is more complicated than that, aftertastes of fruits and hops burst through. This gives it a mouthfeel different to the first taste, strange, but strangley drinkable!"
"A drinkable brew, but you know what? It's because (in my opinion) at the expense of flavor."
"A fine example of the style, extremely drinkable. I recommend enjoying this ale with fish and chips in the right surroundings: your local english pub. It is malty and strong while not overpowering. It has a pleasant finish and the color is dark and inviting. This ale is delightful in every way"
"Overall a good ale that I will definitely have again."
"Dark, almost black, with reddish highlights. Initial head (about two fingers) quickly reduced to thin lacy foam with lace on glass. Coffee, roasty aroma. Wonderful taste of coffee, nut, chocolate with just a bit of sweetness. Limited hoppiness. A little thin for the taste and appearance. Not a session beer but excellent with a variety of food from mussels in red gravy to beef."
"Black but slightly translucent body with very thin offwhite head. Smells malty, kind of earthy maybe? Similar to a Scottish ale in aroma. The first thing I noticed about this beer when tasting it was the mouthfeel. It is a fairly thick feeling beer. Very impressive in that department. Tastes sweet and malty. Almost no hop to speak of. Also has hints of a black licorice or rootbeer flavor to it (the aroma had this too). Kind of roasty too, but not enough to make it more similar to a porter. Reminds me in many ways of a Scottish or Scotch/wee heavy ale. Very tasty. Complex flavors, but well-balanced. Does not hit you over the head with any particular flavor or the entire flavor in general. Not something I'd drink everyday, but I'm pretty impressed."
"A nice beer that is well worth a try but I couldnt drink it in quantity"
"The aroma I find very pleasant indeed. Chocolaty/toffee smell, with dried dark fruits (prunes, raisins) in the background. A delicious malt aroma in the background throughout. Intense, dark chocolate flavour on sipping, with roasted nuts and a hint of coffee. Blackcurrants and a suggestion of spice (nutmeg maybe?) in the finish. The ale feels nice and full bodied in the mouth, and drinking this stuff is no difficult task. There's little fizziness to it, which I like. This was one of the first ales I tried, and it has quickly become a staple, either as a beer when feeling unadventurous, or when I just want a reminder of the taste of an old favourite. Its definitely seductive."
"Clear chestnut with a faint reddish purple hue. A short head of beige foam fell rapidly to a solid ring with a wisp of tiny bubbles on the surface. Malty aroma full of caramel and toffee, but there's a strong fruitiness that's reminiscent of prunes and there's a bit of cocoa in there as well. Same in the flavour, along with moderate bitterness and a hint of hops. Medium bodied, kind of on the light side for an old ale, with medium/low carbonation. Still, it's palate coating. Not bad at all - pretty tasty and easy to drink. I think I've gotten spoiled on slightly bigger old ales, so this one seems a little more ""refreshing"" than I expected. Quite enjoyable."
"Pours a deep blood red, quite clear, with a medium tan head that builds to nearly two fingers before dissipating slightly, though retention is good. Leaves some lacing. Small is quite sweet, but a bit subdued, with fruity notes of cherry and plum, caramel, and a minor nutty note. Taste is more assertive, touching many of the same bases. The vinous note is puzzling, and I'm not quite sure what I'm tasting beyond the fact that it's intriguing and pleasant. Mouthfeel seems a shade thin, but still warming, and drinkability is rather better than I'd expected. An impressive and unique offering."
"Pours dark reddish brown with off white head which dissipates quickly into a thin film. Aroma is malty, smells like dark fruits, maybe raisins and slightly roasted. Taste is mostly malty with some roasted flavor and hop bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel. In my opionion, this beer is too sweet. There just ins't enough roasted flavor, hops or alcohol to balance the sweetness."
"Old Peculiar is certainly that  a tasty, rather complex and unique beer. In fact it paired wonderfully with a hearty beef chili, but maybe thats just me. In fact, the more I drink this, the more it grows on me. While I wont claim that its my favorite beer, its good enough to warrant the purchase of another six pack or several."
"The relatively low ABV makes it highly drinkable. I found it to be unexpectedly thirst quenching. An all-around good beer."
"I was in the mood for something rich and creamy tonight, and this hit the spot perfectly. Thick mouthfeel (especially as it warms), but not overwhelming. A little too sweet for me to drink all night, but one or two of these here and there is always a treat. Would definitely recommend."
"Nothing offensive here, but no great shakes either. I could take it or leave it."
"Dvery drinkable and I would have this again. Perhaps a session for this old ale, if you can imagine that."
"Old Peculier has a lot of different aromas and flavors that work well together, leading to a very drinkable ale. Worth seeking out; definitely recommended."
"D - This one is right up my alley! Very drinkable!"
"Mouthfeel is thin and a bit watery, and the drinkability is affected by the lack of depth and complexity in the taste"
"Strong malty aroma. Poured to a dark brown with trace of ruby, and a slight, tan head that diminished soon after. Taste was very strong malt and chocolate, and very fizzy. Left a dry, bitter (not good) finish. Don't know how this scores so high with a lot of raters, but I'm unimpressed with this one."
"It should be noted that this is the first Old Ale that I have tried. But I did really enjoy it and if you ever have the chance you should try one."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite English beers; worth coming back to every now and again; glad to see it back in the market (comment added in 2011)"
"An old favorite, this one leaves its 12 ounce glass home, and pours dark, plummy amber, with a long lasting dark tan film head, leaving respectable fine splotchy lacing. Nose is of light sweet malt with perhaps a hint of rum. This is a rich malty brew, notes of musty malts, plummy ripe fruits and again a hint of wood/smokey rum in the background. Fine after dinner sipper. Classic old style ale."
"My only complaint is that this suffers perhaps from a very slight case of overcarbonation. The rich flavour and body leaves me wanting more but at the same time present this as a sipping beer. Sessionable, but only if you want your sessions to last awhile!"
"I guess this is an old ale I like, and it's authentic English old ale too. I like this better than the American interpretations I've had which are a little too robust."
"Highly recommended."
"Not the most over-the-top old ale, but it's really tasty, nevertheless."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This gives the beer a really drinkable quality and the carbonation is medium but the buttery texture of the mouthfeel helps to balance it out and it goes down easy. Really a great beer."
"D - Fairly easy to drink and an interesting beer."
"Cheers!"
" This is a typically English beer and as solid as the Sunday Times. Will be picking up another sixer soon."
"The smell is too faint for my liking. Some sugary sweetness and cocoa are there, along with a coffee aroma. In the taste, the sweetness is a bit more complex as it throws in some brown sugar and a milky sweetness without that lactic bitterness. Kind of interestsing. The finish leaves you wishing for a bit more punch, as the minute amount of hop bitterness washes it down with a faint herbal quality. Tastes minerally as well. Other than that, there's not a whole lot going on here. The flavor is complex enough in itself to be interesting, but overall this is way too restrained and subdued for my liking. The mouthfeel is also very thin, almost watery. I won't be purchasing this one again."
"Pretty unique and not as strong as other examples of the style. This is something you can drink anytime of the year, especially with a meal. Solid."
"Overall: An excellent ale, recommended. This is probably the most enjoyable ale Ive tried to date."
"There isn't one thing that is extra exciting with Old Peculier. Instead, it takes the basic beer qualities and does them very well."
"This beer had a dark brown appearance with a medium long-lasting head. The smell had a delicious roasted malt aroma with a hint of fruit to it. The taste was good for a dark ale and was not too overpowering despite its dark color. The taste was full of body and was complex with plenty of malt taste and medium bitterness. Because of this, I enjoyed it immensly and would consider it a good drinkable beer to someone who appreciates a dark beer. The mouthfeel was slightly thick with medium/low carbonation. Highly recommended!"
"A nice beer to sip during cold and dark winter nights. Full of character, but not too strong in taste or alcohol."
" A delicious ale that that pairs well with honey baked ham (big surprise right), or venison. I'm sure a nice big leg of fire roasted mutton would work, but who's got one. Not really conducive to heavy drinking occasions, it's a nice way to warm up, or to wind down. Enjoy"
"I would like to try it out of the tap to truly get a good feel for the beer, but it has a very dark amber/brown color with a slightly fruity aroma. I expected a little more thickness to the body from the look of it. It has an excellent malt flavor that makes it very tasty and is very smooth going down. A good one if you like beers with some meat but want something a little lighter for a change."
"Not an amazing ale, but always nice fresh and on form, like this pint had at the seven stars in the city of Bristol. Light amber when held up to the light. This is considered very strong in the UK but for an American it's just about right at 5.7%. Aromas of figs and caramel/toffee. the malts are very layered in this one and the hops are fruity yet subdued quite a bit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, drinkability remains high. A classic brew, this."
"It tastes very pleasant. There is an intial molasses flavour with a rather herbal hoppy flavour backing it up. Then it finishes with the taste equivalent of the dairy/chocolate smell. Lacking the potency of the other old ales I've had it might disappoint the more hardcore consumer both in terms of flavour and alcohol content but it is certainly very drinkable."
"Drinkability: I could smell this beer all night, but the drinking... not so much."
"Poured a pretty dark black, but somehow managed to look relatively...light and thin, I don't know how to describe it. Good thick tan head though. Smelled of coffee, roasted-ness, and a little sweet. Taste was very similar to the smell, with a nice sweet aftertaste. I tasted a considerable amount of roasted coffee flavor. Very smooth, but a little thin and with less aftertaste than I would have expected. I could probably drink a couple more of these, but I don't think I will."
"this is a very good beer i was able to drink at a pub in st andrews scotland. delicius. probably my favorite beer while overseas. smelled delicious. very different from how it tastes out of a bottle in the US. a dark beer with an arrangement of flavors that i ad a hard time pinpointing. thick in tast with malt and some caramel but certainly not overdone."
"the mouthfeel is a little thin for what i would call an old ale but ti is still good."
"Drinkable enough. Inclined to think I got a bad bottle, but here in the middle of the country I seem to find a lot of ""bad bottles"" from across the pond. Call'em as I taste them. This was great over in the UK. cask or bottle. I'd say worth a try despite my rating. If the only thing I knew about this beer was this bottle that would be a different story!"
"Poured black with slight reddish hues when held up to the light. Modest carbonation with a quickly dissipating head. Smell is a nice combination of molasses, chocolate, caramel and a hint of coffee. Taste is similar to the smell without a hint of the chocolate as noted in the smell. There is a nice balance of hops to keep this brew from being overly sweet. Given the smell and taste, the body of this beer proved to be a medium to thin brew. Definitely not what I wouild call thick or heavy beer. A nice beer for an occasional change of pace."
"D: I have had several of these at a time. They all seem to grow off each other. If I drink a different beer afterwards I still get the peculierly different taste"
"Deep reddish/brown color. Good head that is quckly gone though it has a decent carbonation level. Subdued aroma-sweet malt with a nice coffee/treacle thing going on. Very malty flavor. Somewhat sweet. Cocoa and treacle. Slight hop bite in the finish. Terrific mouthfeel. Great balance between the flavors and body-really well done. I havnt had this in years it was always a favorite of mine. I am suprised at the low abv I always thought it was much higher. Very nice beer-well worth trying on a regular basis."
"Pours a deep brown, not completely opaque though, with a ruby tint. Head is tan, of a goodly size and quite creamy. Laces well. The smell is dully sweet (caramel), with an obvious mineral character and has a definite fruity yeast presence. Flavor is very well integrated, a substantial, dry roasted note mixed with some dried currant, caramel and molasses. Yeast seems to lend a melon characteristic. The malts are substantial but supremely balanced by herbal, tealike hops that keep things relatively dry at all times. A definite acidic tone that serves that aim as well. Very full bodied with soft carbonation. Great beer."
"Atmosphere and time of year may contribute to the goodness of this beer. I was sittling in my easy chair, with stereo playing my favorite music and the outside was cold and dark. Great for the winter or times indoors. PLan on drinking several bottles in an evening. This could even be good foilk medicine for nursing colds."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer to say the least, not one of my favorites in the style, but good anyway."
"Poured a smooth, black with reddish hues at the corners into a pint glass, miniscule head fell quickly to light tan lacing. Smells sweetly of dried fruit, raisins and dates primarily, some malt overtones, brown sugar/molasses like sweetness almost. Tastes very much in the way that it smells, sweeter, hints of caramel present as well. Mouthfeel is good, nice and smooth, fairly thin brew. Would consider purchasing again, drinkability high, lower ABV."
"This is a much different beer than I am used to drinking, but I'll try to be as objective as I can with this review. The smell is a little bit like a quadrupel, with the taste of candied fruits and other additives. Also a hint of prune, which suggests the beer will go down smoothly. The taste is much like a Scottish ale with much of the same malt taste and smoothness as it goes down. There is no real presence of hops in this beer, it is mostly just the hops that dominiate."
"D: A good drinker."
"M&D: a bit thick on the palate after the initial light texture, and down the palate it gets thicker still, though not sugary. But overall this is a creamy-smooth and mellow old ale with a subtly complex flavour profile. It's better than my last bottle, and I can't wait to seek it out on draught at my local Wetherspoon pubs!!"
"cheers..."
"This is my first review that I've submitted to BA...so bear with me, (I've spent so much time reading other peoples reviews that I feel like I almost owe it to the site to start adding and not just taking). Purchased at Foremost liquor on Ashland Ave. in Chicago. Six Pack. 12 oz bottle. Been in my fridge for about a month before I made my way to it. The head forms quickly (had to watch my pour a bit) and fades quickly leaving residue on the cup. There is a rich malty smell. Rich like fortified wine (port), but without the alcohol to it. Get a little dried fruit too. I'm not terribly familiar with the style (just starting to get into the English, always been more of a Belgian guy), but this is great. A little bitterness in the aftertaste. Sweet and malty upfront. I've only had a couple of old ales before, but this one is easily the best I've had. It has a richness to it, while at the same time being incredibly drinkable. I didn't expect this to go down so easy. Being my first review, I'm looking for something to be more critical about, but I'm just too busy drinking more of this beer."
"Taste is more like a Marzen than a dark ale. Toffee-caramel sweet with that nutty hazlenut flavor. Some spicy hoppyness follows up. A good bit of British yeast balanced with some hops. Mouthfeel is a little phenolic with a tinge of spice and ample carbonation. Very drinkable for the style. Preferable in the fall on a cool day."
"Overall I think this is a beauty of craftmanship, balance well struck but the price kills it, not worth the $10 a six, but maybe good for a pint on tap."
"What a treat--it's hard to pin down what exactly it tastes like, but at the same time as it's remarkably complex, this is a delicious, well-balanced, enjoyable brew that one might easily enjoy several of in a sitting. If this is representative of the Old Ale style, I definitely need to do some exploring--I've already found a favorite."
"I really enjoyed this beer and have decided to look more into the old ale style after this fine beer. The appearance is very brown but not cloudy with an off white head and some lacing. The smell is robust and malty and sweet. The taste abounds with dark fruity tastes and brown sugary sweetness. It leans toward the raisin end of the spectrum and doesnt have much of a hop taste. It is nicely restrained in its sweetness, and I find the flavor excellent. It has a very long caramelly finish. This is a superbly drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel was a bit watery, but not too heavy or watered-down like a macro. Excellent beer overall."
"This is probably the most legendary old ale ... strangly could not find it on tab in Yorkshire when visiting this autumn ... it's soft and oily, lightly smoky, malty, hints of milk chocolate paired with raisins and dried blackcurrant, very smooth and sustaining ... this has everything a brew needs to offer pleasure and delight ...."
"Deep brown/ruby red color with a rocky tan head. Smells of prunes, raisins, burnt fruit, bitter chocolate, espresso. Taste is chocolate at first, also plums and roasty flavors. Very rich. Medium to light in body with smooth mouth-coating characteristics too. Very yummy."
"Overall, this beer was a profound disappointment and I would almost call its categorisation false advertising. I shall not be buying this one again."
"drinkability is fantastic....very nice English Ale!"
"Overall this is a nice beer. Taste is its weakest attribute, through, which hurts its appeal as the most important variable. Theakston's is not bad and not tremendous on the whole, and for its price this is a problem. I will not deign to purchase a sixer. However, if someone else brings a few to a party, I would gladly help drink a couple."
"thanks to biglove . from the bottle.poured a nice ruby brown with a light tan head. aroma a nice balane of caramel, malts, hops, got some honey as it warmed. flavor, roasted malts, caramel, a little coffee,dark fruits. as a nice mild bitterness to it would like to get my hands on more of this."
"Old Peculier is actually not that peculiar. No individual characters in aroma, texture, appearance, or taste make this beer a standout or enigma. Nevertheless, a well thought and well brewed beer. Medium flavors and aromas throughout. Some of those medium characters are: caramel, toffee, plumbs, grapes, toast, grain, yeast, and hops. It's what you'd expect per the description--plain and simple. Texture to the mouth is medium viscocity, medium carbonation, medium roundness, and medium dryness. Noticable, but not powering alcohol in the finish. A clean, well brewed beer, but a bit benal."
"Smell is caramel..malty and buttery diacetyl. Taste is much the same, and actually a bit more complex than I expected. Reminds me a lot of Fullers, actually. Mouthfeel is a little thin, in my opinion. Needs a bit more muscle, and this would be a truly great beer. Given the light(ish) mouthfeel, it lends a lot to the drinkability. I'm not a huge fan of beers from the UK, but this one was surprisingly good. A respectable and sessionable english ale."
"Pours clear deep brown with garnet glints and a tan ring of persistant foam circles the glass in a meniscus of bubbles that leaves lace. Aroma of fuggles hops, fruity esters (plums and raisons), brown sugar and toffee - from British crystal malt and roasted malts mix with mild chocolate malt tastes. Sweet maltyness is well balanced by hop bitterness. Medium/light body and dextrinous mouthfeel from Belgian candi sugar. Warms offers a hint of butterscotch (diacetyl) and biscuit malt flavors, and some alcohol combine with slightly bitter roast grains and hops to dry finish."
"Opinion: This is a really nice beer, and one that is surprising to the senses. The aroma is really mild while the flavor is assertive. The alcohol percent is deceptive as this beer has a lot more flavor than the majority in its ABV% compared to its counterparts. Compared to the majority of Old Ales, it is very restrained, but this is a beer that you have to drink on it's own merit. An excellent brew!"
"poured a deep copper color with modest off-white head. Smell is of caramel with toasted notes. Taste is incredible with an extraordinary note of caramel toasted malt. Mouthfeel is a continuation of the caramel with a slight dryness. This is truly an incredible beer."
"This one is a bit watery, but an easy drink."
"-UF"
"Some pretty good flavors going on here, but more comparable to a black & tan rather than an Old Ale. Definitely the lightest version of the style I've ever tried at 5.7%."
"A peculiar way to spell peculiar. Appearance is a transparent dark copper with a foamy coffee head leaving cascading lace. Aroma is ethanol, plums, towering toasted malts  plus some hops that give off esters as it warms. Initial taste is a combination of the grapefruit hops, other fruit (currants), malt and is very complex. Body is thin to medium = refreshing."
"Overall a sturdy and consistent Old Ale. The water in Masham lends itself to the inherent beauty of this ale - just like the Blacksheep brews. Good ale with classic well-balanced flavors."
"This beer pours a golden brown with a light brown head. The head appears thick and fluffly, fading slowly leaving thin laces. It smells malty, with hints of caramel. It also has a faint aroma of plumbs and chocolate. It tastes of toasted malts with a slight chocolate flavor. It has a sweet taste, with very little hop bitterness. It goes down smooth leaving a slightly fruity aftertaste. The flavor of this beer in not overly aggressive. It is well carbonated. This beer might make a good session beer. It is low in alcohol, and the taste is smooth and mild. This beer is definately worth a try."
"Excellent English ale  extremely drinkable. One of my all time favourite beers could drink this all night !!"
"Smooth malt and a slight hop twinge make up the taste. Finishes very clean with an almost creamy mouthfeel. A nice dark session beer."
"This one might be put in with the winter brews packages but it is one that I'd hoist year round. Here's to the holidays!"
"Overall drinkability is pretty positive, as I'm sure I could put away a few of these if it came right down to it. Quite a decent beer, although nothing that makes me yearn for more, and I'm looking forward to trying it as a dinner beer sometime in the future -- it'll probably work well with grilled steaks or chicken tenders."
"The firm body and great drinkability make this one prime session ale. If I ever see this little baby on tap I'm ordering a pitcher."
"Pours a dark brownish black with ruby highlights when held to the light, and a thick tan head that retains nicely. Smell is all malt, with vitrually no hops presence whatsoever (but this is an old ale so its not inappropriate for the style) with a big butterscotch and toffee flavors and a plum or raisin fruit smell, but the diacetyl is too evident in my opinion. Taste beings with a big toffee flavor and continues with a plum/raisin/dark fruit flavor as well as the buttery diacetyl flavor. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth and creamy, really feels fantastic in the mouth and the carbonation is low which increases the smoothness. The drinkability is descent but i couldn't see drinking more than a few at a sitting."
"Old ales are beauties. This beer pours a deep ruby purple brown with a nice beige head. The head fell soon thereafter with slight lacing. Nose of sweet malt, hint of alcohol, some fruit. Smooth taste with oily maltiness coating the tongue. There is a touch of hops, but nothing serious. Mouthfeel is medium and the finish is superb. If the malty complex finish was tasted earlier, this would have scored much higher. Easy quaffer, low ABV for an old ale, makes it a possibility for a session."
"Pours with a thick, lightly tan head, that slowly falls to a ring of foam. Minimal lacing. A bit of a coffee cake-like aroma -- yes, coffee cake. Very smooth mouthfeel. Big caramel malt flavor, laced with sugar, and just a bit of a tawny, wine-like character. A bit tart towards the finish, which is pleasantly balanced by just the right amount of bitter hops, followed by a powdery sweetness. A complex ale, but a very nuanced one, and rather drinkable. I haven't had this in awhile and I think I need to have it more often. A great beer for cooler spring weather."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle purchased at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California, into a sturdy beer mug. The head is sudsy, bubbly, a little over an inch in height and is dark tan. The body is deep brown bordered by dark crimson streaks. The beer looks like royalty. Smell: flecks of dark chocolate, freshly baked sourdough bread; some faint espresso notes with a finish of candied plums. Taste: milk chocolate sweetness upfront, rapidly takes on some complexity -- slight hop bitterness tangled up in musty dark fruitiness. The middle is chocolate covered coffee beans and the finish is a slightly sour pop of hops with a receding base of dark fruit sweetness. Pleasant, yet complex. Mouthfeel: full, has a whipped-creaminess to it. Middling carbonation. I can imagine washing down a meal of slow-roasted beef with gravy and root vegetables with this brew, and being very satisfied."
"I can't believe that after 11 years I finally got around to having another one. This is a complex-tasting, malty brew that is to be savored. I suspect that the sample I have is old, but that does not detract from the quality too much. Pours to a quickly retreating ""head"" of huge bubbles that fade to almost nothing. Deep ruby and brown color. Aroma is chiefly malt, caramel, and sherry with hints of vanilla and licorice. Flavor can be described as malty and complex (licorice, banana, port, sherry, etc...) with a perfect balance achieved by judicious hopping. Some nice toasty/roasty notes in there too. Don't drink it ice-cold, you'll miss all the flavors. The finish starts sweet but dries out in the aftertaste. That ""sweetness-turned-dry"" seems to be the alcohol component of the flavor. There's a lot going on in this old ale."
"overall a real good beer, hits the spot when you want a good ale."
"This would be a great session beer if the smell of this particular sample cleared up"
"Smells of milk chocolate and fresh plums and grapes, pours dark brown with a tan foamy head that quickly recedes. Color is more of a deep ruby red when held to a light. Tastes first of cocoa and dark fruits, then maple syrup, a bit leathery, doughy yeasts. Lightly bitter. Creamy textured medium body, a bit thin for my taste. Goes down easy with a finishing taste of mild coffee, not very bitter."
"Seems to be a cross between a brown ale and a Scottish ale. Not particularly noteable, but pleasant anyway."
"Drinkablity: This was an excellent brew to enjoy after a long day. Very crisp and thick and satisfying."
"Nice beer, a good session beer here."
"An ale to appreciate for flavour. Amber brown, with a nice head. A dark bear's richer taste and sour kick, scotch, malty, and bitter. Thanks Radek for sharing and OKBeer for sending. Fuller mouthfeel. A splash was accidently added to a Dogfish 2004 and improved it's flavour."
"Poured like a liquid black cherry into my 22oz glass. Head was an inch tall that fizzled loudly down to a generous cap. A sniff revealed a muted fruit smell with a touch of alcohol and grain. I really love this Pale Ale, the taste is so damn pleasing. Light caramel overtaken by a mild fruit and eclipsed by some English hops. Absolutely declious and nearly my favorite Pale Ale. The mouthfeel is medium but very balanced as far as carbonation goes. I feel like I could drink this forever."
"On a pairing note, I've found (accidentally) that this goes quite well with chocolate ice cream (probably chocolate in general as well). Definitely not similar flavors, but a nice contrast, and the chocolate and cream mask the bitter finish of the beer. Give it a try!"
"Drinkability- Wish this had been the first beer of the night. Quite a yummy brew. Would love to try this on tap sometime."
"12 oz. bottle. Clear garnet hue, tan head leaves a nice lace. Awesome black currant, vinous smell. Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Earthy, black currant, dark tree fruit malt taste. Finishes with a fermented fruit, alcohol flavor on the breath. One of my all time favorite brews from the Big Island."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a dry, high abv. aroma. The taste is decent. It has a thin malty flavor with a dry, yet slightly sweet finish. It is a bit toastey and bitter. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking Old Ale. It has excellent aroma and good flavor."
"Medium bodied, with a light effervescence on the tip of the tongue. Fairly smooth and quite easy to drink. I used to think this was THE beer, but in recent years I have found many more that I like better. That said, I still drink it and would never turn one down. A good all around beer that really needs to be a little thicker for my tastes."
"A great cask ale....this is a fantastic beer"
"Pours a dark clear mahogany with a good cream head which slowly subsides to a layer of foam and clingy lace. The nose is roasted malt with floral and alcohol spice notes. Flavor is carmel malts underlying oily diacetyl with a drying and appropriately bitter hop finish. Medium-light, creamy, and well-carbonated body. Surprisingly refreshing for an old ale."
"Best before 31.01.05"
"Dark copper, reddish hints. Honest off-white head, slowsly diminishing to a decent cover. Typical quality old ale aroma full on malt and smooth hops. Toffee, caramel, dark chocolate, wood... it just could use a bit more intensity. Im hesitant about lowering the score for a small weakness in the flavor development where, in mid-mouth, theres a slightly watery gate toward the smoky finish, but after reflexion, it just makes it that much more drinkable. Besides it, the mouth entrance is artwork, a great caramel, chocolate and woody blend on a dry and lightly tart foundation of dark malt. Vegetal and mineralic finish has a gentle touch of bitterness. Mild astringency. Soft carbonation, medium body. Tastes much bigger than it is. Excellent."
"Almost black with a small head and a malty nose, this beer is understated to the point of almost being dissapointing. I expected a bigger taste but after a few sips began to enjoy the sutble nuances of the hops and malts used. Nice session beer but I do prefer my old ales with more volume."
"The taste was slightly bitter, which faded to a slightly sweet, slightly musty full-bodied malt. It reminded me of a light barley wine. I liked it quite a bit."
"Pours a very nice deep brown color and has a nice chunky tan head that dissipated quickly. Decent lace is left in my glass after every sip. It smells of chocolate and sweet malts... Nirvana... It has a very good dark malt flavor and has little hop bite, if any at all until the very end. The body is a bit thin, but it has that creaminess that all British ales seem to have. Maybe it's the water? Who knows, but I like it. I could drink a sixer of these no problem and perhaps more if I wanted to indulge in a drunken binge. This is by far the best Scotch ale that I have ever tried."
"This is excellent with fish and chips, or as a decent session beer. It's nothing groundbreaking, but it occupies a unique niche."
"oh well. it is peculier, and I can see its draw, but it's not for me."
"This lovely beer pours a dark, dark and a bit ruby colour. The head is thick and tan coloured. Long lasting too. It has a bit malty smell some sweet fruity smell too. The taste is a bit roasted and malty, some hints of choclate too. It has a little bitterness in the aftertaste but it is a beer that runs down smoothly. I like this beer."
"I got a nostalgic glow on this. Can recall their small bottles with a peel off metal top, ala the old Mickey's Malt! This was a classic road beer twenty years ago."
"Pours a deep brown hue with a one-finger, creamy tan head. Poured a bit cold, but nice notes of sweet malt, toffee, and a hint of maple syrup. Nice, rich, creamy body holds a palate of dark malt, with a light sweetness and hints of dark cherries lingering in the background. Notes of roasted malt in the back of the throat. An unusual, excellent ale."
"over all, a very interesting beer. not bad for a cold night, but maybe only one."
"Deep, deep brown with purple highlights, creamy white head that lasted all the way down. Aroma is sweet toasted malt and some fruitiness (plum?) and a touch of smoke and coffee. Taste is malty, with hint of woodspice and chocolate. Hops are a secondary flavor, a bit of bite coming toward the swallow. Mouthfeel seems a bit thin for such a dark brew, Guinness like. Very drinkable, but I think it would be even better paired with a beef dish."
"Mouth feel is smooth and it is very drinkable."
"Doesn't taste like a Scotch ale to me. Smells of dark caramel and toffee, roasty barley. This lovely beer pours a thick, tan head; mouthfeel is silky but not cloying. Tastes like straight up roasted barley and malt tinged with sweetness, though the latter dissipates once you drink past the first few gulps. The finish stops the maltiness short with . . . a subtle dryness without bitterness, followed by a residue of malt aftertaste. This is a wonderful beer; I usually associate Scotch ales with a flavor that tastes like a compressed and redoubled, alchohol-forward amber ale. Granted, the Scotch ales in my experience are all American microbrew interpretations of the genre."
"Just popping the top, I'm pretty sure this is right up my alley. Nose is sweet, chewy toffee. Head is small, tan, dense but active. The beer is dark brown and hazy. There are ruby highlights. Front is tangy, fruity toffee. Almost a little cheese in there. The chewy, dark, full, thick middle is delicious and capped off by a nice, fresh bready finish. This is just a yummy, chewy, bready toffee delight. Great."
"Theakston Old Peculier is very good beer. It's kind of odd to have an old ale weigh in at only 5.7%, but that makes it especially drinkable. The world's most sessionable old ale? Most peculiar."
"This beer is extremely drinkable. At 5.7 ABV you could put quite a few away, but I don't know why you'd want to. While it isn't a bad beer, it is my least favorite Scotch ale so far. Why not skip this offering and find a Smuttynose Scotch ale instead. Old Peculiar never goes for the gold, it is strickly an honorable mention."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, good frothy head formed on top of a mahogany-hued brew. Strong malty aroma, nice balance between of malt and hops, bits of lace being left here and there as drinking ensues. After a few mouthfuls, the bitterness starts to dominate a bit, and affects the mouthfeel, in my mind. Still very drinkable for a strong ale, an enjoyable experience."
"maybe its because its a fond memory of mine, this brew, but even tho it has changed, its still one of the kings. ive said it before about english beers. they know how to stay well within themselves, while still giving you everything you want from a beer, and can down a few pints without being totally rotten by the end of the evening. this is a prime example. an all time great."
"Taste is malty and sweet. Also nutty and lightly bitter like dark chocolate. A bit of alcohol burn perhaps in the finish? Caramel undertoones and lightly smoky. Very smooth with a lingering sweetness balanced slightly by that light bitterness. Did I say smooth? this one used to get me in big trouble when visiting Britain. Smooth as a mild but 50% stronger. It really sneaks up on you after a few. One of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. On cask, it's heavenly but I'll take it from the bottle anytime."
"A sip starts smooth, and then gets almost rough in the mouth, with a tart and tangy finish. Puckers the mouth, even. Malty, with a touch of what tastes like dirt."
"Pours a deep coppery-brown color with a thick beige to tan head. Dusty and musty malt aromas, intertwined with some traditional diacetyl-like buttery malt notes and a faint bit of hops round out a nice interpretation of an English old ale. Easily drinkable after a night out on the town. Slightest puckering tartness in the finish, but adds to it's drinkability."
"Dark mahogany, beige head with good retention. Roasted barley leads the aroma with just a hint of caramel, earthy hops, butter, and apple esters. Flavor has surprising similarities to an abt12 - just missing some alcohol. Smooth milk chocolate flavors, lingering watery sweetness. Very good brew, I am surprised I have not heard more talk about it."
"This brownish red ale poured a nice head which dissapated quickly but is leaving a nice lacing of my pint. Nothing overly powerful smell wise but did detect some sweet malts. The taste is an interesting start of the smooth sweet malts and finishing with a slight pleasant bitterness. This is a medium bodied beer leaving a semi decent mouthfeel. Not a bad beer and would drink it again but nothing noteworthy about it."
"A crimson-mahogany hued beer with a soda-like head that thins after a bit. Big peaty aroma with a vinous tone. Almost a bit cheese-like. Molasses, peat, and caramel make for a big sweetness on the palate. Hops are leafy, adding a little bitterness to support and staying in the background. A bit thin, but tasty. Reminds me a lot of McEwan's Scotch Ale. They are both owned by Scottish Courage... Not bad, enjoyable, but there are lots of better beers in the style. Orkney's SkullSplitter is a much better example of something like this."
"A murky amber brown pour with a finger's worth of uniformly foamy head with average cling. Sweet malts and caramel remind one of Scotch ales. A very interesting and pleasant mouthfeel--creamy and clean, not syrupy. A wash of mild bitterness starts at the front of the mouth and methodically crawls to the back. Creamy malts are strongest in the middle of the taste, eventually giving way to some bitterness and lightly spicy alcohol flavors. This is a pleasantly interesting and drinkable beer."
"Pours with a thick light brown head that sits atop a deep, dark amber, clear beer. The aroma is sweet and has notes o f molasses, caramel and dark fruit. The taste is fairly clean compared to the rich brew that I remember that this once was. This beer is lightly sweet with almost no balancing bitterness. There seems to be a threshold level of buttery diacetyl, which, adds a bit to the complexity of this beer. There seems to be some subtle dark malt flavors that are evocative of chocolate. It is quite drinkable, but need to be served quite warm to get any of the flavors."
"Deep walnut brown showing burgundy highlights with no particulate matter in suspention. Initial rich and generous foam dissipates somewhat quickly to a thinnish film that leaves very fine lace clinging to the glass. Smelled rich and malty with chocolate, spice (nutmeg and cinnamon mostly), ripe fruit and diacetyl notes of butter and nuts. A solidly structured beer supported by malt and molasses which are joined by a slight ''horse blanket'' character and black fruit tastes. Finishes on this sourness and a mild but well defined bitterness leaving you wanting another sip 'til it's all gone. I'm now looking for a place which serves this on tap."
"12 oz bottle poured into a Fullers pint glass. Clear mahogany that is a distinct ruby when held to the light. One finger beige head with staying power and moderate lacing. Aroma is a bit subdued with hops, toffee, and some peppery spices. Mouthfeels is initially thick and creamy, finishes dry and exuberating. Taste is bitter/tart at the beginning, then the walnuts and toffee take over. Overall, an excellent execution of well balanced malty caramel and hops bitterness. Reminds me more of an excellent ESB than a Porter. This is my first Theakston, but it is one of the more drinkable British ales I've come across. Excellent drinkability."
"Not as good an old ale as some of the ones I've had recently, but was a servicable beer. I'd probably have one in the future."
"I liked this one a lot - good for cooking and cold nights."
"Dark brown with a thin, fine-bubbled cream colored head. Great coffee, chocolate and sweet fruity aromas greet the nose and draw you into the beer. The flavor is sweet caramel balanced by bitter roasted malt and a decent hop bitterness. The finish is exceptionally dry. The mouthfeel is hearty, with light carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, but eh dryness seems to detract just a bit for me."
"The dark beer poured into my glass had very little head and had a sweet aroma. The taste was complex: sweet malts with a slight woody and roasted background, augmented with a molasses presence (brewing licorice?). I also found the mouthfeel and its drinkability well-suited to drink alone or mixed with others before or afterwards."
"Overall Impression: Haven't had one of these in a long time. Tried it when I was fairly new to ""beer geekdom"" and really liked it. Classic beer. Easy to drink and deliciously interesting to boot. However, it's funny to me that a 5.6% abv beer is considered a ""strong ale"". I know that's attributed to English law, but over here in Belgium, of course, 5.6% is ""normal strength""."
"Nothing fancy or pretentious, just a damn good drinking beer. Definitely one to check out if the opportunity arises."
"Overall Impression: Not particularly one of my favorite styles, but this beer has me thinking I should explore some more. I liked this. Drinkability is solid, the dry finish and clean taste makes it hard to put down."
"This beer poured a dark garnet/amber color that was crystal clear when held to the light. The head that was produced was semi thick and a full constancy, tan/beige in color and not overly lasting. Some spotty lace present. The aromas that came out of the glass were of roasted malt, fresh floral hops, some alcohol, caramel and light fruits. Not an overbearing amount of aromas but present. The flavors were of fresh floral hop flowers, roasted malt and nuts, some coffee, earth tones, caramel, plums, and some alcohol. It left a roasted oily feel in the mouth. Semi sweet in the beginning, dry and watery near the finish. Medium bodied. Not overly impressed with this beer, good but not impressive IMO. Lots of other beers of this style out there to try before I would go back to this one. But it was drinkable."
"Overall a good offering. It is just too tangy and the flavors are too much of a mixed bag. I did not completely dislike this ale. There are just many I would rather have in its stead."
"Dark amberish color, better head than expected. Not much of any aroma on the first sniff, a little chocolate became evident on the fourth pass. The first taste had subtle cherry and chocolate competeing mildly for your attention. Overall the taste was pleasant but thin."
"Deep garnet color, small foamy head, slightly malty and sweet aroma. Full rich malt taste. Malty and subtle. Fruity, slightly nutty, some yeastiness. Mild and flavorful. Taste is very smooth. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Appearance: Deep ruby brown tone with a frothing tan head arising from quite a vigorous pour, nice even lattice of lacing not bad. Aroma: Contains mild chocolate with the tosted malts producing a certain musty characteristic one of those English open fermentation things I'm almost sure of, either way it's not bad at all. Taste: Semi fruit infused sweetness with a clean toasty finish of chocolate running through it, I always was turned away from this beer for the simple reason that here in WV it runs at 9 bucks a six pack not bad I am enjoying this one finishes very clean. Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy medium in body a great selection glad I found a single. Drinkability: Amazingly drinkable compared to what I thought it was going ot be like, refreshing ties all flavors together well seems like a classic English ale glad I finally gave it a shot."
"A good beer, but not something I'd thirst after, especially among many of the tasty beers in the old ale range."
"Pours a deep mahogany with little visibility through the glass. Head is moderate with good lacing upon recession. Aromas are sweet malty and somewhat bready/yeasty. Taste is a wonderful contrast of malt sweetness up front followed by a long mellow bitter, dry finish. Fruit flavors of grapes and plumbs are there along with an acidity that gives this beer wine-like attributes. Very smooth and easy drinking despite the abrupt dry finish. A nice beer to finish the night off with."
"There's still the lovely aroma and flavour of Christmas pudding, but not as rich and dry [though now thin] as it is from the bottle."
"Drinkability  It went down all right, but I think theres some potential in there. Im going to buy a six-pack and cellar it, maybe taking one out every six months or so. Ill update the review if theres a noticeable change."
"A really tasty brew. A well constructed beer with decent ABV% that disappeared all too quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed every drop."
"This rootbeer colored beauty maintains a full beige head and a bit of trailing lace. The aroma is malty and tea-like. The rich malt has a caramel sweetness. Sharp citrus bitterness and tea-like hops are in abundance. The rich independent flavors begin the meld towards the end of the glass. Creamy and nearly oily, this brew goes down with a nice velvety smoothness."
"Mahogany colored with a bumpy dark beige head. Head drops quickly but leaves a sheeted coating around the glass. Nose is sweet, almost perfumey, and malty. Flavor is peculier like the name. Oddly sweet. Tastes like root beer up front, and finishes with prune juice. Hints of sweet brown sugar. Watery mouthfeel. Moderate drinkability."
"Not quite my cup of tea...Appearance was very good...but there was a raw unfinished feeling. At first smell, I thought it may have been a bad bottle...hard to describe...the smell had an odd pungency to it. Taste was ok, but not spectacular..I'm wondering if the smell prejudiced me.Mouthfeel was somewhat lighter than I expected...hints of chocolate? Easy enough to drink after I had gotten by the smell. I know this beer was rated highly by others, which shows sometimes it can be a matter of taste. All in all nowhere near as good as the Geary's Hampshire Special Ale I had just before this offering."
"Pours out to a brilliantly clear, dark caramel with ruby accents, forming a whipped dark beige head atop medium bubbles with good retention and good lacing. Aroma is strong with very abundant notes of buttery diacetyl, toffee and burnt caramel, sweet dust and round English hops. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Mouthfeel is very smooth and pillowy soft with a surprisingly light body. Taste begins with notes of rum, vanilla extract, distant light molasses, pipe tobacco and butterscotch. English hops contribute a round, mild bitterness which is initially prickly. Finishes warm with faint peppery alcohol, a dark grainy astringency and woody notes. A classic English ale with lots of nuances and character. Very enjoyable."
"Pours a reddish-brown color with a very small, head. Aroma of raisins and alcohol mixed together. Yum! Taste shows more complexity though. Roasted malts show strong. Caramel leads the way and is the main flavor. Raisins are there but not as strong as in the smell. Buttery toffee comes in the middle and provides a slickness to this beer. Finishes with slight hop bitterness but mainly alcohol spiced yeast. Finish lasts for a long time. Well done."
"I would definitely purchase more (this was my first) and I may try to replicate this flavor in the fall, if I can find a good clone recipe."
"Had this at the Viking. Not a bad beer, but not terribly exciting either. Had a subtle, toasty scent, with a very slight raisiny smell in the background. This was also pretty much the taste. Hops were extremely restrained, but so was the malt, so they balanced. As this is made by the folks at Newcastle, it came as no surprise that it reminded me of a Newcastle Brown Ale with a slightly more toasted malt taste. As I said above, not bad, but not a whole lot going on."
"Notes: Wow. I came in with no expectations one way or the other, but this was a really good beer. I won't look past this one the next time I'm in the store. A definite must-try."
"Tan head dissipates quickly atop a dark brown beer. Aroma is of sweet malt and noble hops. Flavor is deep with a salty water caracter and lots of chocolate and sweet malt with an english hop finish. Definitely clean with a flavorful finish complemented by the noble hops and water. I think that this beer is very good but not very strong or very old due to no lactic sourness."
"beerluvr - N.P., ""The Who Sell Out""...wonderful stuff!"
"Invitingly dark brew. Smell is malty, with hints of molasses, chocolate and coffee, which also come though in the taste. Not very complex, but pleasing to the palate and very well-balanced. I've drank this brew for years, and will not hesitate to drink it again and again"
"what can I say except yummy.. this beer is a great strong ale even if it's only 5.7 ABV. Dark opaque brown/black with a roasty character and chocolate flavor. One of England's best almost borders on a porter in color and strength but more complex. Well worth seeking out nd can be enjoyed anytime."
"Nothing earth-shattering, just very pleasant, sweet and terrifically tasty."
"a good looking dark beer, dark red-brown with a medium sized head. the smell was really pleasant, sweet and malty with what i assume to be a number of cooking spices. taste was pleasant just like the smell. sweet and spicy at the begining, a little bitter at the end, a good balance. i would have liked this to have little more of a substantial mouthfeel, but i wouldn't say it was bad by any means. a pleasant surprise, i picked it up on a whim."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a deep dark red/brown, with a fairly good head that recedes quickly by leaves some lacing on the glass. Aroma is mildly malty. Perfect carbonation! Taste has just the right balance of malt sweetness, and hop bitterness. I really enjoyed this ale."
"This brew pours a medium head of small fine bubbles and semi-transparent brown body. It has a mild malt aroma and a smooth palate with a bit of a tingle to the mouthfeel. It has some nice flavors of roasted caramel, malt and spices. A rather good brew!"
"When this brew was poured it had a medium head with fine-small bubbles that quickly dissipated. The body was reddish-brown. The lacing was extremely sparse. It had a fruity aroma to it. The taste was smooth and it had a sweet flavor in my opinion. There was a slight bitter aftertaste with this brew."
"I have to preface this review by saying that I'm not a big fan of English bottled beer. That in mind, a nice looking dark ale with exceptional head. Aroma is sweet and malty if not a little earthy. Smooth on the palate and goes down super smoothly. Flavor is earthy, malty and bitter. A slight dryness on the finish. Over all a good English brew."
"Finish was balanced but leaned more heavily on the herbal hop bitterness, had a touch of molasses and an almost medicinal quality as well. This is a solid, very interesting beer. It's well made and has a real nice distinctive characteristic. Why.....it IS peculiar......"
"This beer was recommended by a friend that went to England. I found this after the Ohio abv law was raised. I only have a couple barley wines under my belt, this is a gotta-have on your beer journey. It pours a very dark amber with a two inch tan head. Lace is good, thick & sticky all glass long. The aroma of a sweet roasty malt. The taste and drinkability are complex malty, toasted, roasted grain with an alcohol kick at the end. The mouthfeel lingers on awhile with a tingle thats tart & dry. A good grew to have on your barley-wine list."
"A great beer. I believe this is an old sample due to sediment at the bottom of the bottle, but it has not affected the beer in a negative way at all. Roasty, malty, smoky, remarkably complex and unique. Makes me want to don a cloth cap and listen to County Derry. Absolutely perfect mouthfeel, soft and cushiony without being too thick, and just a sparkle of the hard water/metallic quality to wake up the tongue. Drinkability equally high; while you may not want to drink 12 of these in a row, the flavor is continually inviting and the beer suitably robust, but mellow enough to keep you grounded. Should be excellent with food, especially stinky cheeses, boiled veggies, dark roasts and other hearty fare. Where's me Stilton? In his autobio, Dave Davies (that lovable nutter from the Kinks) refers to Old Peculier as a dangerous beer and imagines it being brewed by a bunch of aliens invoking the spirit of Mephistopheles -- this is a compliment of the highest order, of course."
"Old Peculier is one of the most unique and excellent beers I've had. From it's dark, ruby appearance - to the smooth, wine-like flavor and smell, it is a world class beer all the way. Small head, disappears quickly. A unique flavor, almost hard to describe. I love Peculier every time I have it, and it is a subtle, world classic. Perfect balance."
"If you could envision what beer should smell like and taste like, this is the beer that defines this. This beer is the perfect definition of a good beer drinker's beer. It is not too stout and not too sweet, but just right with just the right amount of hops."
"Had this beer in London and decided to give it a try here (bottled). Poured out a very dark amber, almost opaque. Thick, rich head and a good smell, though nothing to write home about. I thought that I recalled it being very tasty, but perhaps the fact that this time it was from a bottle should be considered. A good middle of the road beer: not hoppy at all and not too malty either. Some hints of caramel but not strong in any way as far as taste, though not bland. Average mouthfeel and good drinkability. Not a bad beer but nothing ""special"" about it."
"The bottles out here are typically oxidized, but despite that I quite enjoyed the beer. Reddish/ruby brown in color. Grainy aromas carry through to the flavor as does a nice sweetness. Dark fruit and a subtle chocolate flavor also come though. Nice medium to medium-light body."
"Sweet malty nose with a hint of burnt wood. Brown color with a nice thick tan head. The head on this beer is thick and creamy and very lasting. Very rich sweet thick roast malt flavor. The aftertaste leaves you with a roast/smoke tongue. Medium to full body with a smooth thicker mouth. The brew is also quite lively in the mouth with carbonation swirling around the tongue. This beer is a sweet roasty ale for those who like sweeter brews."
"Chocolatey brown with amber highlights. Very malty; tasting chocolate, brown sugar, and licorice in the end. The licorice leaves a kind of tingly feeling in the mouth. Not much on the hop department, I'm sure there are some in there for balance, but they don't really come to the front. A very tastey ale. A sweet syrupy taste may develop after too many, but I wouldn't worry too much about it."
"Very nice beer. The pour created a very dark amber to brown clear liquid look. The was very decent and a good looking tan color. Moderate lacing. Decent nose of malt with very faint hops noted. Fairly complex palate and a good dry finish; lots to sample in a single brew. Very smooth and rich mouthfeel. Great bottle and labeling - impressive presentation. Take the plunge on this one."
"Color is dark, deep brown, with a tannish head with a good mixture of small and big bubbles. Came right up to just about an inch high then faded some leaving some patchy lace. Smell is sweet malt, pretty bold, with alot of little complexities. Some hints of dried fruit and spices. Taste is kinda creamy/oily with a smooth, sweet, milky, roasted chocolate malt with a strange dryness of fruitlike hops and herbs. Raisin or fig I believe. Its somewhat earthy but I was a little put off by it. It seemed to separate from the original flavor. But was good non the less. The feel is interestingly rich, creamy smooth, heavy to medium bodied with a slightly dry bite. Good complex beer. This really fits the Old Ale style."
"This one pours a very dark brown with a lively tan head. The nose is very mild sweet malt and hints of caramel. The mouthfeel is sharp, almost astringent with the hops. The flavor is a contrast dry with slight undertones of sweetness, sharp hop flavor with somewhat smokey notes. This one is quite enjoyable and a nice dark ale to be savored."
"Very dark beer with good carbonation. Subtle and smooth... a polished, well-rounded ale. This is a smooth and cultured beer that takes its time impressing you. Nice to have a beer that encourages you to slow down."
"Very good (as in ""when in doubt, can't go wrong"" with this one) beer."
"This poured out a very clear amber-brown color with ruby highlights. The head was tan and creamy. The aroma has some interesting notes to it. Some syrupy sweet malts, butterscotch and a touch of roasted licorice. The taste is very good with a sweet malt background, a touch of alcohol dryness and full of dark roasted nuts. Sweetly toasted malts and a nutty texture blend with a creamy mouthfeel to make this beer extremely drinkable. Very rich and roasted tasting. Perfect blend of hop bitterness. A damn fine ale. This beer never disappoints."

"Darkish brown, translucent ruby highlights around the edges, spotty and underdeveloped tan head, no real retention, some spotty lace. Decent nose, malty sweet, notes of dark fruitiness, slight yeastiness, soft caramel as well. As for taste the sweet, soft malt & slightly bitter hops balance the palate nicely, some chalkiness. A nice mixture of graininess and smoothness adds, both, to the taste and mouthfeel. The finish is lovely, albeit thin (as is the body), with a light sweet toffee and coarse bitterness. The alcohol seems stronger that listed. Overall, this is a pretty damn decent beer but frankly its nothing Id seek out, still Id drink it again, try one."
"This is the kind of beer that could become a staple of my diet. Mahogony pour with a small, off-white head. The smell was rich a very malted. The taste was definitely malted with a creamy thick mouthfeel. It had notes of caramel and toasted malts. There was just a little hop flourish at the end of the taste. I think this will inhabit a place on my fridge shelf for a while to come."
"There was a slight carbonation but not at all fizzy. I enjoyed drinking this beer which would be a great one for meals, in my opinion. Overall, it could be my favorite British beer."
"I had this beer a couple of years back, but I do not remember liking it this well. There is a definite sweetness to this beer, which I am usually not a fan of, but it is well balanced and not overwhelming. A very good brew."
"Dark brown ruby color almost liken to a prter,bicuit-like aroma.Nice sweetish malty flavor with a bit of an oily undertone.The toffeenish I expected didint come through as much as I thought though.Not to heavy but got full after two for some odd reason.A good English strong ale well worth its reputation in my mind."
"Pours to a dark brown color with ruby highlights. It forms a good head and leaves a bit of lacing when sipped down. The aroma is malty, and biscuity. The flavors that come out of this one are raisin-like, malty and toffee-like. The body is medium, and it is a smooth easy drinking beer. Overall, a good beer with some interesting flavors."
"Pours deep mahogany in color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that fades into a sticky lace. Nose is sweet roasted malts, caramel, and molasses. Smooth, creamy, and full bodied in the mouth. Taste is a malty sweetness at first followed by a bite of oily and bitter hop resins. Then, a nice buttery toffee flavor takes over and seems to coat the mouth. Quite a complex brew. Very nice."
"A good but not excellent beer for a late evening or lazy winters afternoon."
"Clear, very deep reddish and crimson-tinted brown that appears almost black from any distance. The thin but creamy ivory head holds quite well and leaves some minor lace. The nose offers a distinctly buttery and fruity aroma above some earthy hops. The body is medium/light with a very fine, moderate carbonation that leaves it smooth and creamy in the mouth. The flavor is bold, and mildly complex, with some soft buttery diacetyl, dark fruit (currant, raisin, prune) and toffee with a tinge of deep scortched molasses (that's not quite roasty). It finishes dry and lingering with a rising bitterness and a touch of alcohol. A classic that's quite unique, and well worth trying."
"This is one of my father-in-laws favorite beers, so I get to drink it with some regularity. I've found that the diacetyl level varies greatly in this beer from being a subtle flavor component, to being overwhelming. This sample was closer to over-whelming. Don't know whether this variability is a brewery issue, or a storage issue, but it makes this beer pretty unpredictable. In the interest of full disclosure, I am quite sensitive to diacetyl, and not particularly fond of it."
"Next to no head. Light aroma, but amazing dark grain, lacto-sweetness, molasses and toffee flavor. I do not see the graininess or coarseness that everyone seems to be detecting. Dark, too dark to call it reddish-brown, maybe the color of cola. Dark at top, but transparent at the bottom of the class. Very light carbonation. Bottom line is that this is a delicious beer that will convert anyone to dark beers."
"The aroma's full of malt and and roasted grains. Taste is of grain and slightly sweet caramel. Mild hop bitterness. Medium bodied...starts with a rough , grainy feel, but ends smooth and sweet. Not exactly outstanding, but solidly good."
"The pour a deep ruby red to almost brown, the head preposterous in size, creamy in its consistency and the lace forms thick sticky sheets that smother the glass. Nose has a nice hint of toasted grain, caramel, yeast also present, sweet and fresh to the olfactory sense, the start sweet and the top middling in mouth feel. Finish is perky in its acidity, delicately hopped with a dry long lasting somewhat bitter aftertaste."
"a good dark ale with a slightly bitter taste that becomes stronger and stronger as it warms. Not a very fragrant beer, could be the style. I've never had an english old ale before, but this offering was very enjoyable. Color resembles that of a amber but many shades darker. Lace retention is slight but head poured is attractive, very white, and fluffy. Will give this another try, I think the bar I had it at served it too cold for the style."
"Pours a clear brown color with a small off-white head. Smell is mild roasted malt and light bread notes. The taste is a mellow toasted bread and malt and medium hopped that balances out quite nicely. This is a light to medium bodied brew that goes down easy. Very drinkable and one I would consider as a session beer. Cheers!"
"ADR used to use the bottle label of this beer as his picture ID for this site.  I always kept telling myself that I needed to try that one.  I finally have and glad I did."
"dark brown topped off by a slightly tan, airy, foamy head. Sensationally smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Smooth slightly fruity taste with solid malty base. I took this out of the fridge about 60 minutes prior to dinner to let it warm a bit. Very drinkable classic ale from the U.K. A visual (great lace) as well as tasty delight."
"This beer has a nice clear dark reddish brown color with very little foam. A slight malty and caramel flavor and maybe a hint of spice? It leaves a creamy taste in the mouth and palate. A very pleasant ale, smooth and well balanced. Pricey, but well worth it!"
"Very dark brownish red, and holds its tan head nicely. Smells a little like caramel, but I can't really describe it. Flavor of beer is nicely helped out (not saying it NEEDS help) by 5.7% ABV. It finishes smooth and sweet, with a little bitterness on the back of the tongue. If another sip is not taken for 30 seconds, you mouth actually starts to water! Great beer."
"Pours a heavy brown with a cream-colored froth which isn't particularly sticky. Nose is full of raisin-y and grapelike fruit and malt aromas, with some sherry-like alcohol as well. The malts are the first thing you taste, but they are very quickly cut into by a tea-like hop flavor, which brings you to a sort of abrupt finish, with little aftertaste. Very active carbonation. This brew is not nearly as heavy as the nose and appearance would lead you to believe (which I found to be a good thing). Very good stuff."
"Quite a complex aroma with initial sweet and heavy malt (with some caramel), with qualities of fruitiness (with a red wine type aroma) and seems like alcohol aroma too.  Interesting and good.  Thinnish head that stays okay.  Deep dark brown to red (garnet).  After the initial burst of malt, the alcohol seems most evident to me, but not excessive or overwhelming.  Taste has many of the same complexities as the aroma, yet remains smooth.  A bit of nuttiness to the flavor.  Sweetness to the malt, but not so excessive that it tastes like cough syrup  (my biggest gripe with malty styles).  Nice dryness to the finish with a short but pleasant aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is full and rich.  This really is quite an impressive beer."
"Peculier but in a good way! Khaki (is that a color?) head over a rich brown Ale. The color is especially beautiful while pouring for some reason (?). Wonderful roasty flavor and complex aroma I can't begin to pinpoint. I can't wait to have this one again!"
"Pours a deep mahogony brown with a thick tan head that lingers, good lace that throughly coats the glass, no apparent carbonation.  Complex aroma of alcohol, dark fruits, coffee, caramel.  Very smooth taste with a light body and good mouthfeel.  Flavor begins with roasted malt, progresses through bitter hops, coffee, and earthy notes, and slight sweetness.  Finish lingers with earthy and caramel notes.  Lighter in body than I would have expected, though not bad."
"i had high expectations and was let down just a little bit.  this is an ale that should be drank in late fall/winter and not in the middle of summer.  very dark ruby with a minimal head.  smells raw (maybe the water used?), but layered..lots of faint fruity overtones with a touch of caramel, raisin and chocolate.   much lighter mouthfeel than i expected...extremely smooth and drinkable with an assortment of different flavors in a delicate harmonic balance.  i believe that this ale tries to be all things to all beer drinkers, making it very peculier.  nothing stands out but the balance.  even the hops have a hard time sticking out.  one of the most difficult brews to date to analyze."
"Pretty darn fabulous!"
"213"
"The smell is terrible, but the dark body with thin head looks very nice. The taste is somewhere in between, so its drinkable."
"Pours a deep garnet color, with a nice pillow-like tan colored head. Fruit and caramel aromas are on the nose. The mouth feel is smooth. On the palate a fruitiness upfront, banana notes are evident, hints of caramel malts, a touch of spice, nicely sweet, and maybe hints of toffee or butterscotchnot sure.sure is  tasty though. Tingles the palate in the finish. Overall an excellent brew!"
"I look forward to trying this out again (and hopefully fresher).  There is alot here to like, but just not enough of it."
"Brown in color, this ale has an aroma of brown bread and a dry malty-molasses flavor. Good malt finish and light malt aftertaste."
"A dark slightly sweet (they add maple syrup), medium carbonation and head.   Slightly hoppy finish.  Seemed to be sweeter ten years ago."
"Okay, I have been to England now three times, last just this past March.  To the guy that was surprised by an english beer not being good, try going over there and hanging in a local(and I mean local, not tourist trap)pub.  You'll find plenty of ""miss congenialty"".  Theakson on tap over there didn't necessary thrill me."
"Love the name..."
"Dark garnet hue with good clarity.  The initially moderate head settles quickly into a static thin layer that leaves no lace.  Lots of fruity yeast esters in the aroma, along with mild acetaldehyde. Classic earthy and slightly grassy Fuggles hop nose.  Fairly light in body, but mouthfeel is very smooth and agreeable. Roasted malt notes are surpisingly mild considering Old Peculiar's color, and are comprised of definite chocolate malt and perhaps a touch of roasted barley or black patent.  Crystal malt sweetness is minimal.  Hop bitterness is evenly balanced by the roasted grain bitterness.  As the beer warms a bit of pleasant diacetyl becomes perceptible.  Biscuit flavors and a slight alcohol warmth round out the fairly dry finish.  Tasty, but a tad bland for an Old Ale; it seems to be an Old Ale / Brown Ale hybrid."
"Wow.  I had high expectations for this brew and it blew my expectations away.  Pours a nice brownish/amber with a creamy head that sinks, with a nice lace holding all the way down.  Incredible malty caramel smell.  Smooth, creamy malty flavor.  Caramel and light,earthy hops blend for great balance in this medium/full bodied brew.  Creamy, smooth mouthfeel and incredibly drinkable.  Drinking this is such a great experience that it is hard for me to even put th glass down to end my sip.  Awesome beer, highly recommended."
"sweet and raisniny with some toffee or caramel in there aswell, buttery and sweet, malty and light, not much hops detected on this inspection, a touch one-dimensional, i don't like it as much this time, but its still OK."
"I'm going to have to try this one again. I tried it on the recomendation of a friend and remember making the comment ""It is peculiar."" Interesting flavor and more complex than the Taddy's Porter I had just before it."
"A deep, rich malt backbone delicately balanced with a dry mild hop bitterness make this one tasty ale. This beer is worthwhile to always have on hand when the mood calls for it."
"Good beer.  A bit malty with some fruity undertones.  Also a bit of a caramel or molasses flavor lingering under that tan collar."
"There's nothing peculiar about this beer -- it's a classic. Dark brown, big tan head that sticks around and leaves a nice trail of lace down the side of the glass. A wonderfully fruity nose and palate with a slightly oily mouthfeel and dry finish. And there's even recommended reading for this ale -- anything by Martha Grimes, an American who writes very English-style murder mysteries that are always centered around a pub (each book is named after the pub de jour) and a recurring character named Melrose Plant who always drinks -- you guessed it -- Old Peculier."
"Murky dark ruby color. Weak head from bottle with little lace. Fruity, caramel and roasted aroma.  Soft rich malty, fruity taste of dried fruit like dates and raisins and a hint of molasses with a slight roasted finish.  Finishes dry. I enjoyed the slick mouthfeel.  I especially enjoyed the numbing of my lips and face like it was of a higher ABV content than listed.   Short lasting yet good aftertaste. Very clean and nicely balanced, humble yet classy. Very quaffable. Cheers!"
"This is one of my all time favorite dark English beers, when I lived in Savannah GA for three years this is one of the beers I could always find on a regular basis."
"Quite a unique brew. Blends the flavors of roasted malt, chocolate, prunes & black licorice. Interesting texture and mouthfeel."
"This reminds me of a very mellow barleywine.  Similar depth and complexity of flavor, but much more reserved.  An interesting change of pace."
"Bought a six about a year ago and didn't really care for it.  The cloying treacly-type characteristics turned me off.  Maybe it's just not my style, after all, this is a world classic, right?  Last night I had the pleasure of having a bottle that had been sitting in my cellar for a year.  Everything I didn't like about the beer was gone and I was left with an amazingly complex world classic."
"What a wonderful beer.  Sweet, and so mellow."
"Notes: Probably one of my favourite from the line at Theakston. Such the complete and masterfully crafted brew."
