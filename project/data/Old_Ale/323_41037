Though I’ve never had it fresh, I can imagine letting it sit until after the best by date did no bit of harm. Perhaps a touch more weight and a slightly darker colored head would make this the perfect scotch barreled stout. If you’re a monster peat fan, this won’t quite satisfy your craving. However, if you enjoy layered flavors and can appreciate balance and subtlety, this will be right up your alley. Loved this. Cheers to whoever helped out with this.","Jeffo","Oct 11, 2014"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, chocolate, toast, brown sugar, roast, raisin, fig, brown bread, molasses, vanilla, oak, tobacco, leather, peat smoke, and roast/oak earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and whisky cask notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, toast, raisin, fig, dark bread, molasses, vanilla, oak, peat smoke, tobacco, leather, and roast/oak earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, roast, toast, dark bread, raisin, fig, tobacco, leather, vanilla, oak, peat smoke, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a white. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and whisky cask flavors; with a nice balance of the oak character with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent old ale. All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and whisky cask flavors; and very smooth to sip on.

I prefer this to the 16 and 18 honestly, although I would still love to try the older ones, this is a genuinely great beer.","StonedTrippin","Dec 17, 2013"

Lots of chocolate and scotch to it, if you don't like scotch I'd suggest saving your money for something else.

4.48,8.7,4.5,4,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Overall Impression: I was very impressed by this ale. It obviously takes in a fair amount of scotch character from the barrel to balance roasted malts with peaty/smoky flavor. Dark Chocolate and sugar sweetness are prevalent in the middle of the drink, but subside slightly as the roastiness comes back in the finish. I think this is a stellar ale, with the only draw back being the slightly too alcoholic nose. I am attributing this nose to the fact that the ale was aged in 12-year whiskey barrels rather than older whiskey, so the alcoholic notes in the barrel will be less mellowed and more pervasive, thus more pervasive in the ale. Fantastic beer overall though.","dwren89","Jun 30, 2013"

I pick up the aroma of dark roasted barley malt, chocolate, oak, and that familiar whisky aroma. Those dark roasted malt notes hit up front and the whisky comes right through in the back. I also detect that oak and chocolate from the nose. The malt profile almost comes across as porter-like. Many of those flavors come through in the aftertaste. The body is full with low carbonation. The beer is smooth, but also sticky. It is easy to consume for an 8% beer. This is an excellent beer that I wouldn't mind having again.","acevenom","Beers"

The taste has a dark chocolate and coffee taste up front which gives way to a slight dark fruit sweetness. There is then a slight vanilla flavor before the taste of whiskey takes over and finishes the beer off. The mouthfeel is mildly carbonated and sticky.

I think any scotch connoisseur will tell you this (I used to be quite nerdy about scotch before I discovered beer). This is the peat, first and foremost. This is what blends with the beer to give it that dark woody, smokey flavor. At only 8%, there is not a lot to hide here in terms of alcohol (in comparison to beers like the Abt 12 or the Cuvée van de Keizer Blue). But regardless, this is a reasonably smooth ale.

Man, this stuff comes off as all-over-the-place, but in a good way. The taste holds notes of candi sugar, caramel, tobacco, vanilla, cocoa, very light peat smoke, clove, figs, and light steak. The body is a limpid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slightly swampy feel.

On the sip, the taste isn't overly phenol as expected and this proves to be a well balanced beer. Theres a smooth velvety taste of the roasted chocolate and a semi-bitter aftertaste.

Warming feeling to it, but the whiskey barrel aging isn't completely evident to me; the slightest hint of peat and whiskey comes through even around room temperature.

Dark caramel and chocolate malt up front, leading into a light smokiness and peaty whiskey character, and finishing up with a pronounced bitterness and mild scotch-like lingering finish. Rich and full-bodied, moderately carbonated. This is a wonderfully tasty and complex beer. The ABV is well-hidden and it shows nice scotch characteristics as it warms without being too sweet/cloying.

Exceptional nose with wonderful complexity - brown sugar, molasses, dark fruit and toffee on a malty base. A light whiskey presence is also expressed towards the back. Taste somewhat consistent with nose - molasses and brown sugar are apparent, but a light coffee character also comes out, as well as a hint of char; toffee seems to disappear. Mouthfeel is medium-light, perhaps a little watery, with an almost non-existent carbonation. A really solid Old Ale. The highlight on this one is definitely in the nose.

The mouth feel was excellent, rolled over tongue to bring out more of the subtle flavors. Oak and cedar finish, roasted coffee and malts, sweet prunes in the taste.

Licorice is the primary flavour I get along with some burnt sugar / caramel & toffee notes.

Overall this was very tasty and complex and rich. It had a subtle flavor and smooth body. It had a bit of alcohol noticeable, but it was still fairly easy to drink.

Not smoky, smoked as in wood smoked, fireplace embers and slow cooked until every pore says ""smoke."" Almost too bitter at times, the alcohol does come through, can you cut beer with spring water? The vanilla and coconut pair with coffee roast, caramel, sweet and edgy at once. The peat, moss, lichen earthiness there, particularly at the end. Whole cloves and notes of smoked ham.

The flavour has loads of rich malty sweetness, immediately followed by distinct notes of peaty smoke - it is quite amazing what impact the whisky cask has. Dark chocolate in the middle. The finish has a firm bitterness from the hops and burnt malts, while the peaty smoke lasts through the long aftertaste.

The smoke and whskey grains start to some trough in the middle. With a very creamy coffee and oakey finish. The palate is smooth and warm. This beer was made for the snifter an constant swirling.

Some peat and heather honey notes from the highland park casks are present. Some caramel, coffee, and oak tones too. Focused and sharp. You can taste the highland park, which is is fine harmony with the natural flavors of the stout. Cream oaky honeyed palate. Some nuttiness and very mild smoky notes. Body is oily and grips the mouth seductively. A protracted and clean finish. A splendid collaboration with the highland park distillery oin the part of harviestoun.

Wonderful taste, the whiskey flavor is there, but not overly dominant like so many other such beers; it has a great slight coffee start with a wonderful dark, malty, old ale flavor, a nice sweet finish with a bit of hoppiness to tone it down.

To be honest, the scotch whisky aged notions are pushed to fringes, and I couldn't link this taste-wise in any way to HP, even sipping on it along side the beer (though they are quite agreeable, harmonious, and tasty partners, and I recommend having a dram along with it). I just would have liked to see more direct quotations from the spirit itself in this beer. I hoping for more of this in the 16 and the 30, though I'm worried, as I tend to enjoy moderately younger Scotches more than their older brether regardless of price.

The taste is a little more aggressive than the aroma as far as the scotch notes go. Lightly peaty, woody tasting oak, very light pepper and vanilla notes, and hints of cherry and caramel. Most of these notes are picked up from the barrel than from the beer itself. There is a lingering roastiness that comes from the brew. Very smooth and even a bit light for what this is, which makes it quite easy to drink, but ot could use a tad more oomph in the body for me. I don't like this quite as much as the 16, primarily beacause of the heft and flavor complexity. I tend to find that I like the balance id middle aged scotches as well where there is more flavorr development and integration than 12 year olds and less woodiness and fade than in 30 year olds.

Luckily the Scotch flavor shows up more in the taste. There's also coffee, roasted malt and smoke/peat noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it seems a bit thin at times but it is slick and smooth.

An initial 1/2"" head formation, reduced to a film, but held firm after that. Light on carbonation, it delivers a creamy tan foamstand. Aromas jump out with a roasted malt character, esters of plumb, grapes, and faint berries, and a hint of dirty, earthiness, and mild smoke. Firm alcohols are evident in the nose, but not obvious from Scotch barrel aging. Flavors of dry, roasted barley rests on a firm barley malt, sweet pillow. Decorated with peaty eartiness, walnuts, and dark fruits found in the nose-only muted. A complementary Scotch Whisky alcohol, oak, and smoke compounds the balace with complexity and variety. Light signs of oxidation (soy sauce) actually add to the complexity. The texture is rich, full, and viscous. The alcohols show signs of roughness that age will round out. Somewhat hot and numbing. Hop bitterness complements the roast barley and smoke nicely. Finishes malty rich and dry (coffee-like) with low sweetness. Very nice beer that will certainly improve with age. This beer begs to be paired with a robust cigar.","BEERchitect","May 06, 2008"
