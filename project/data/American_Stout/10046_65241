The chocolate on the tongue begins like fine gourmet dark chocolate with 70 – 80% cacao then mid-palate hints of vanilla and caramel enter in with roast flavors dominating by the finish as chocolate flavors wrapped in a range of grain flavors linger long through the aftertaste. Finishes dry with a touch of roast astringency. Bitterness tastes as much from the roast and dark chocolate than from hops. Very creamy, chewy body with fine soft carbonation.","pat61","Nov 10, 2014"

As it warms, light dark fruit (plum, raisin) notes and molasses become evident. Medium body with a very slight creamy texture. Above normal carbonation with a nice effervescence throughout. The flavor profile is nice but not very complex or well balanced. It begins with a bitter chocolate flavor and sweetness that has a slightly burnt molasses character to it. The middle is effervescent and brings forth a light roast bitterness over a nice malt sweetness that has a molasses character. The finish is a touch astringent and leaves a slight alcohol burn at the back of the throat. As it fades, a slight note of hops is evident. Missing are the dark fruit flavors, body and smoothness that would propel this very good stout to outstanding.","tillmac62","Oct 19, 2014"

3.78,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light coffee, herbal, grass, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. A bit too perfumy on hops in the nose. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, herbal, grass, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good stout style. Good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 29, 2014"

Pours a thick dark black with decent tan head that dies down to a nice pool of tan foam with clinging lacing. Smell is of chocolate, coffee, and dark deeply roasted malts. Taste is bitter bakers chocolate and coffee up front with a hop bitterness on the back. Thick mouthfeel with an almost grit to it from an overload of cocoa. Solid beer but not exactly what I am looking for in a stout, still very happy to have tried it. Will try again later and see if tastes have changed, though I doubt it.","Brutaltruth","Jun 24, 2014"

Scents of rich roast malt, roasted black coffee, dark chocolate and cocoa powder. An excellent, true to style aroma profile for an American Stout, but not standout. Flavor begins with rich roast malt, slight black coffee and some toffee sweetness. Moves into a more aggressive roasted malt flavor, more roasted black coffee and more toffee with some cocoa and dark chocolate and molasses in the background. Finish is of roasted black coffee, bitter roasted malt and bitter cocoa. A good, yet standard American Stout flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with light carbonation and a smooth feel. True to style, no complaints. Overall this is a good, very true to style American a Stout, not fantastic but still a good drinking beer with a nice aroma.","Auraan","Apr 16, 2014"

4.04,8.3,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a very dark brown, almost black coloring with a thin, sparse, light tan surface coat of head. Aromas of subtle coffee, cream sweetness, chocolate highlights, and hints of vanilla. Smells great! Flavors are smooth and creamy initially, with a solid blast of roast and bitter coffee in the backbone. Extremely balanced, with a smoothness as it travels over the palate. Light bodied, but it never loses that smooth touch, transitioning to a roasted and more heavily bittered coffee aftertaste. The finish is bitter and dry, with a roasted linger. Solid beer, and the light body makes it very drinkable.","GarthDanielson","Feb 16, 2014"

4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is full of chocolate and heavily roasted malt, with a little bit of cream thrown in. The flavor is similar. There is a lot of roasted malt and a hint of smoke, along with a ton of chocolate. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice, straightforward stout that is easy to drink.","Mora2000","Jun 14, 2012"
3.58,-4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D - It is what it is, a solid but unexceptional American stout that probably lingered on a shelf for too long for its lower ABV to warrant. Probably wouldn't bother revisiting this even if I could find a fresher example - shame on Left Coast for not bottle dating.","MasterSki","Jun 13, 2012"

Nearly all of the sweetness disappears and the roast is a bit excessive. Hops are flavorful and even a bit resinous, so if that is your thing this beer might be for you. I prefer my stouts creamy, full and on the sweeter/chocolaty side...this one does not manage to capture any of those adjectives. Not that it is all bad, I'll still finish the bomber fairly easily, but I wont buy this again and in a loaded style category, it pretty much falls flat on its face.","twiggamortis420","Jun 30, 2011"
3.41,-8.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer has a killer looking bottle. Was bought for me as a birthday gift. I split the bottle with the friends who bought it for me. The color was black and had a sticky lacing down the glass. The smell of the set was very minimal, just a light roasted aroma. The taste was roasted with some burnt malt flavors. The mouthfeel was pretty smooth has a little thickness. Overall this beer was pretty good.","Knapp85","Jun 17, 2011"
3.65,-2.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark black, pours with a small brown-red head.

The nose brings a good amount of chocolate along with some coffee and a fairly-strong roast component. The flavor has the same characteristics, but also has the unwelcome addition of diacetyl, which isn't overpowering, but does a good deal to kill the flavor profile of the beer.
