Smells like roasted black coffee and subtle roasted barley.  Tastes like black coffee with subtle hints of bitter chocolate that works with the coffee taste.  It has a medium body with light carbonation. It is thin for a stout, but not so thin that it is watery,  with a barely noticeable hop flavor as swallowing. This is something that is probably very good on tap, but just good bottled.","OKbrew89","Feb 28, 2015"

4.25,13,,,,,,"Pours a very dark brown that is almost black with ruby highlights. Close to a 1-finger beige head is seen that settles down to a 3mm of so after a bit. Sheets of lacing is seen that sticks to the sides of the glass when sipped. The aroma is of roasted malts with a good amount of cocoa. Pretty much the same is said for the taste with a light hint of coffee, unlike some stouts that have a lot. Just a very slight bitter finish which is probably from the semi-sweet cocoa. Very tasty and goes go easy. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation for this brew style. Overall, I liked this one.","BeerWithMike","Dec 08, 2014"

This had some nice mild coffee and chocolate aromas, with a nice, faint tobacco note as well. The tobacco note transferred to the taste, and the slight sweetness, nice malty notes, and slight bitterness were good, but not the complete package. Mouthfeel was rather light for the style, but nothing worrisome. I must admit, this is a good stout. I am a bit partial to bigger stouts myself, and this may have clouded my judgment just a little bit. Solid, but maybe more of a tick than a keeper for me.","Mikus","Sep 22, 2014"

3.9,3.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 12/22/2012. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, biscuit, light toffee, light nuttiness, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, biscuit, light toffee, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Moderate roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, biscuit, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt flavors; with a good roast/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and moderately dry/chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice stout. All around good balance and complexity of very roasty, dark, and bready malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 16, 2014"

Due to the color, there was no visible carbonation on the brew. The nose was glorious. It had lots of coffee, roasted malts and chocolate, which is exactly what I expect from a stout. The taste was very much of the same that was apparent in the nose. I got a lot of coffee and roasted malts, not as much chocolate, with a creamy mouthfeel. The brew had very low carbonation and the finish lasted awhile with the roasted malts. It also had medium thickness.

Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and some cocoa powder notes. Taste is of dark roasted malt and some coffee and cocoa flavors. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip.

3.65,-2.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Almost two fingers of dark brown foam, highly dimpled surface, looks like someone just whipped it with an egg beater, decent retention given the large amount of larger bubbles, the lacing is not thick but stays present in wide sticky sheets on the glass sides. The liquid is close to black but you come down deciding it’s really just very dark brown, touch of orange at the glass bottom. Loads of roast to the nose, still it’s the green, herbaceous hoppiness which is most evident, this over coffee, cocoa and malted milk ball accents, pronounced floral side too, the burnt qualities make it difficult to discern much fruit, its general dryness makes an impression just smelling it. Full-bodied, close to heavy but more so just dense for the sake of being dense, nothing gained texturally from it. Here the dryness takes some sting out of the roastiness, palate already deadened some. Dark roast coffee beans, cocoa to pine, dried flowers, earth and tar bring big pucker factor. The carbonation does not distinguish itself, however, doesn’t really seem undercarbonated either. OK, a pinch of cherry to red plum fruit. Could give you a little more to love here but no doubting its strong personality.","farrago","Mar 04, 2012"

The taste pretty much follows the same pattern, though everything is darker, roastier, toastier, more charred, and, subsequently, bitterer. (Aside: A reviewer before me mentioned something about chicory. ... In retrospect, I think that's indeed something that came through, just surreptitiously, without making itself known very well.) The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish.

Stouts tend to be pretty similar in appearance, and this is the case with the Avery’s black body and tan head. The head is ample and lasts for the duration with good lacing. The aroma is more pronounced than other stouts I have tried, with big coffee and molasses notes. These are prominent in the flavor. The Avery starts out with a big coffee taste, then moves to a dryer smoky finish. Overall this stout is a smooth drinking experience. There is a subtle bitter undertone, but it never comes to the surface like some stouts that can be a rough experience. The Out of Bounds Stout was a good find and is high on my list of American style stouts, primarily because big flavor comes thorough but remains a smooth drinking experience.","iSip","Dec 21, 2011"

Sweetness hangs on almost to the end but at the last minute it quickly turns to the proper dryness for the style. A nice chewy mouthfeel without being overly heavy.

3.35,-10.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"This stout poured out as a deep brown color with a tan colored head on top that bubbled away pretty quickly. The lacing was very light and had minimal retention. The smell of the beer is a little toasted with some chocolate aromas in there too, but they are very faint. The taste of the beer was decent, a little on the light side I thought for a stout but it didn't have a decent dry roasted flavor to it. The mouthfeel wasn'ttoo bad, it's a little watery, but it's supposed to be that way I think. Overall this stout isn't too bad but I've had better.","Knapp85","Oct 26, 2011"

3.85,2.4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Although BA classifies this as a Dry Irish Stout, this definitely falls outside of that category-more like an American Stout with the high hop rates. The aroma is great, and the flavor is strong and in your face-I just am not sure that I love the extremely high hop flavors and the fact that they overtake the malt in the finish. Good, but definitely not my favorite. I will say though, that some foods blunt the hop attack a little bit (I'm enjoying it with Rosemary, Chili, Orange, and Maple glazed nuts), which makes for a rather pleasant gustatory experience.","plfahey","Mar 22, 2011"

Last night I enjoyed mine with some Osso Bucco and they complimented each other very nicely. Especially this time of year, a great cheese pairing for this Stout would be Hoch Ybrig, a raw cow's milk cheese from the mountains of Switzerland that is washed in a white wine brine. This cheese has a strong, full flavor from the wash that will stand up well to the strength of the Stout.

The aroma is a pleasing choclolate and coffee smell that is pleasing to the nose. The taste is chocolate followed by some coffee with a hint of hops and some malts trying to come out, and that is followed by some licorice and raisins. The slight bitter aftertaste is a dark chocolate with some alcohol and as the beer warms can feel the alcohol in my throat when drinking this beer. The mouthfeel is a nice creamy feel that melts on the lips and tongue and the medium body makes it a good drinkable beer. This is overall a good beer just as my ratings in all five categories say it is. A must try for all stout lovers.","DannyDan","Jan 14, 2011"

It makes up for the dull appearance in the nose. A great coffee smell and some bitter chocolate. There is a little bit of an unpleasant burnt grain smell. The bitterness is the first thing I notice. The chocolate and coffee flavors don't show up until the finish. After all the flavor there is some alcohol heat. It is a well balanced stout and easy to drink.

The aroma is thick of chocolate, coffee, caramel, and slight burnt malt. There is a yeast affect to the initial sip followed by a strong coffee and milk chocolate sweetness.

By the look and smell, I was sure this was the perfect stout, but alas it was not quite meant to be with this one. Still tasty though, as it is a multi-faceted malt forward stout with some definite hoppy complexities added in. I think this brew fits better as an American stout than an Irish Dry. Never gets boring, even as the glass approaches empty status. I would happily purchase a sixer of this at least once a year.

3.61,-4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured this into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. One of the best looking beers of this style I've seen in quite some time. Close to black in color until held up to the light it's clearly a dark brown. It has an insanely frothy head to it with tons of different sized bubbles that is tan in color. This beer produces a hearty amount of lacing. It is around the entire glass and on a funny note there is a portion of it that actually looks like a world map on my glass, I'm sure the bulb portion helps with it, but it is a very good looking beer. The smell is pretty decent, smells to me mostly of semisweet chocolate as opposed to the more common bittersweet chocolate. The smell follows with some coffee and some what smells of a pine dry hop, where the bitterness comes in. The taste is good, but it has an earthy aftertaste that isn't too pleasant. However, the initial taste is good. It starts off with the malts, and they are pretty heavy. Coffee and bittersweet chocolate now. Then it's followed by the hops. So you get the hop teamed up with that previously mentioned earthy taste. I had to ponder for a minute on how I would rate the mouthfeel. I'm generally not a huge fan of the mouthfeel of the Irish Dry stout except for on certain days, however I found this to be better than most I've tried. It seemed much lighter bodied than most Irish Dry stouts, but it still manages to leave that classic dry feeling in your mouth. It's as if they achieved the same results but went a different route. With all that's going on here, it's still a pretty drinkable beer.","AndyAvalanche","Nov 08, 2009"

Taste is good, tastes again of mostly roasted malts, with a good hop and citrus balance, definitely some oatmel sweetness in here too, a good solid stout taste. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout here, a little watery but still almost medium, a strange citrusy malt taste is left on the tongue from this one, different than any stout I have had.

3.62,-3.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours pretty solid black that lightens up to a slight ruby/purple as my glass gets thinner at the bottom. Good lacing developin on the sides but the tan head disappeared quickly. I poured it and set it down about 2 feet from my face but could still smell it from that distance. Smells very strongly of roasted barley.. more intense than some other Irish stouts and a little more of a raisin character to it and trails chocolate aroma. Actually very nice and I think it's underappreciated in some of the reviews. Just a little more chocolate aroma in there and it would remind me of Rogue's chocolate stout. Taste is a lot thinner than the aroma and wouldn't live up to anyone's expectations if they were looking for something super alcoholic and extreme. Lots of coffee flavors and pretty moderate bitterness with good hop flavor. On top of the roasted malt flavor there is a bit of a fruity sweetness. Kind of standard. I can see why the extreme versions of stouts get higher reviews since I'm having a hard time thinking of what they can do better here. I'd probably like to see more of a creamy/grassy beer where the flavor isn't so obviously just from X amount of roasted barley on top of a base grain. This is what you find in Guiness, IMO. Still, not bad. The coffee flavor is probably the best part of it, but it lacks the complexity needed to be unique and outstanding.","wiseguy142","Dec 14, 2008"

Then a roasty malt with a mocha coffee flavor finishing very bitter. Mouthfeel is medium and odd for a stout.

If you hold it up to the light, you can see a few glimmers of ruby red highlights in the middle of the beer. It had a 1 and a half inch head of tan/mocha foam that had decent retention that left behind some mocha rings along the edge of the beer and some spotty tan lace around the glass. The aroma consisted of roasted coffee beans, roasted malts, cocoa, dark chocolate, and with a slight funky smell of black smoke in the background. The taste was slightly dry with bitter dark chocolate, roasted malts, cocoa powder, roasted coffee beans, and a few dry roasted hops in the background. When the beer really warms up, a slight hint of caramel will emerge in between the dark chocolate and roasted malts. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a slight dry aftertaste of bitter dark chocolate and roasted malts. Avery says this beer is an "extreme experience." That's stretching it a bit too far. A nice offering from Avery that has plenty of roasted flavors, but it's no where near extreme. Going down the Widowmaker, now that's extreme! This beer? Not even close.

Darkly roasted smells dominate the nose--coffee and bittersweet chocolate, though a bit of ripe, dark fruit is present too. The taste is similar, with a bit of sweetness overtaken by heavily roasted malts. Medium-bodied at the start, giving way to a lingering dry finish that invokes downing a spoonful of cocoa powder.

The taste is full of bitterness from the dark malts combined with a burnt or iced coffee taste, not something I'm a big fan of. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, definitely still a medium bodied beer but maybe I'm too used to the full body and smoothness of guinness.

There's still a smoke puff of scud cloud at top and that's fine with me daddy-o. Everything has its purpose and as such this cloud performs its duty. Similar to winter cloud cover does in keeping heat from escaping and the tempertaure from plummeting this buffer zone keeps me from gulping this fucker right down.

When allowed to warm up a bit and poured into a pint glass the body appears to be solid black, but when held to light its translucence is revealed and a ruby-red shows through. The head is tan, and ample, it retains like a champ and leaves thick sheets of lace down the pint. The nose is rather estery, I can pick up fruit aromas similar to dark berries before the pint even approaches my face. As my nose approaches I pick up powdery cocoa aromas and dark, roasty coffee. This is quite a flavorful dry-stout, the flavors of milk-chocolate and bitter chocolate toy back and forth with each other, faint berry flavors and dark roasted coffee stand firmly together before a bitter earthy hop kick in the finish. Nice and roasty with a medium bitterness throughout. This beer is nice and smooth and gets more so at cellar temp, holy damn what a great session stout.

The head was over two fingers in height, beige in color. Head retention was very good; it slowly faded to a rocky cap that lasted the entire consumption. This beer looks very typical of a stout, aside from the fact the subsequent lacing looks like tattered wallpaper. Impressive. The nose is malty, kind of smoky, roasty with coffee influences, plus some chocolate and charcoal. Astringent. There is also a faint, slick, milky sweetness at the distant back. This bouquet is stout-like, the potency is fairly sturdy and the smells are articulated clearly. I really like the nose. The hint of smoke elevates the bouquet over many of its brethren. Inviting to say the least. The palate doesnt make the nose out to be a liar. Pleasant roasty flavors, faint smoky qualities, slick chocolate with a milky sweetness that is very minimal. Coffee beans. Licorice. Charred wood. Distant piney hops it seems. I really like this beer; it is very tasty with plenty of flavors in the mix. I mean this is just a stout after all and damn, its good! It is robust in a restrained kind of way. Hey, I used the word restrained in a review for a beer from Avery! Ive come to the conclusion Averys best beer comes in 12-ounce bottles. Moderate abv, I could session with this dandy. Long aftertaste, I really want some sharp cheddar cheese or grilled meat! Medium in body, modest carbonation, the mouthfeel is pleasant, I could ask for a little more body but it is good as is. This stout is damn drinkable. Give me a six-pack!

3.77,0.3,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The Out of Bounds poured a dark black with a smallish tan head that quickly went to a collar that laced the glass. It has a strong aroma of roasted malts, coffee and lots of semi-sweet chocolate. It is medium bodied and tastes of roasted malts and some chocolate up front with a very bitter, coffee-like, dry finish. Overall, a nice dry stout. The hops are very bold, but not quite over the top.","Beaver13","Mar 10, 2004"

4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pitch black with a rusty head. The foam lasts for a good amount of time and leaves nice lacing. Smells of toasted malts and a mocha aroma. Very inviting amell. Deep roasted/burnt taste with mocha flavors and a rich body. Hints of coffee and a sweet toffee feel. There is a strong lingering chocolate aftertaste with a smooth finish. This is a very drinkable beer by Avery.","stewart124","Jan 31, 2004"
3.95,5.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer after disembarkation, pours soot black with some deep garnet high light, the head is personable in size, the texture frothy, the color a light chocolate with the lace a fine sealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is toasted grain, sweet malt, hints of caramel and coffee, quite fresh and inviting, start is ambrosial, nice malt profile, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish has big hop spiciness, carbonation piercing, quite dry and bittersweet, a pleasant enough stout.","Gusler","Jan 27, 2004"

3.27,-13,3.5,4,3,3,3,"The smell was definately the best part of this brew. It smelled just like coffee. No if, ands, or buts. Too bad the taste wasn't as good. The taste had the potential to be a nice creamy stout, but died out quickly to a not so awesomeness flat taste. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad beer by any means, but there are plenty better out there. If you want a nice milk stout, go with the Mackeson's XXX stout. This one was a little too grainy for me.","JISurfer","Dec 14, 2003"
3.58,-4.8,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"I've becoming more and more of an Avery fan as the years go by. Out of Bounds is pure classic stout. Black like charcoal, mouthfeel like Guinness. Well developed flavors of coffee, bitter chocolate and burnt malt. I didn't find too much sweetness in this one though. Lack-lustre head, but that didn't seem to affect this stout's aroma one bit. A good beer for the winter, by the fire or trekking through the woods.","benmiliron","Dec 02, 2003"
4.59,22.1,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours black with a nice tan head. Opaque except for some mahogany hues at the bottom of the pint. Tan head eventually flattens to cover the surface of the body. Excellent aroma of roasted malt, dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and chewy. Initial flavors of roasted coffee, mocha and caramel treat the tongue. Hop bitterness kicks emerges in the middle and carries into the long coarse finish. Dry and coating roasted malt finish. A great offering from Avery and a must-try for stout fans.","Winter","Nov 13, 2003"
3.16,-16,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Appears after a vigorous pour deep purple ruby almost opaque with a decent sized tan head, leaving scattered patches of lacing. Aroma contains deep roasts which bring out the chocolate and coffee notes but this one has a milk tone to it from the crystallized lactose added to the boil. Taste seems a bit off to me, with a woody offness to me other than that is the cream tone and deep roasts causing the chocolate and mild coffee notes, not too impressed seems dumbed down. Fuller bodied smooth carbonation, decent brew. Drinkability this one lacks an overall crisp flavor the lactose tone seems off in some way making me a little off centered on whether or not I like this one.","WVbeergeek","Nov 06, 2003"

3.68,-2.1,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and choclately. A medium bodied stout. Malts are roasted, touch of chocolate, slightly sweet. Hops are fairly bold and spicy.

3.83,1.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Out Of Bounds Stout: pours a very deep black, not much light if any can penetrate. A vigorous pour splashed up some tannish head, with fairly long lasting staying power. The aroma is somewhat chocolatey, with a bit of coffee. First sip is somewhat hoppy, with some coffee flavors as well. Very deep into the aftertaste, there is a nice blast of roasted malts. The taste is nice, the mouthfeel is very smooth. Nice balance, and taste, easy to drink, and worth picking up.","jackndan","Oct 02, 2003"

4.48,19.1,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a liquid pitch black that shows amber around the edges against the light. Aroma and flavor are an impressive coffee with lots a cream and sugar. The roasted malt is deftly handled, with no cardboard or over-roasted notes. Like drinking an iced Starbucks mocha latte. A coffee bitterness finishes very clean at the end, surprisingly so for such a dark beer. Quite sweet, but not cloying, and yet somewhat dry. I was quite impressed by this stout.","Brent","Jul 25, 2003"

Aroma is strong roasted coffee with a little chocolate in the background. Rich with a big coffee presence, along with a little malt and chocolate. Finish is very dry and toasty with a light hops zing. Well-balanced and easy to drink.","Dogbrick","May 13, 2003"
4.39,16.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A black body reveals mahogany highlights at its base. It's initial short but creamy tan head drops readily to just a thin collar, although it does leave some nice lace. The nose is quite bold with sweet cocoa, dark chocolate, a touch of smoke, and a good helping of fresh brewed coffee. Very nice! The body is medium with an exceptionally fine carbonation that tickles the tongue. Although it appears sweet with chocolate and cocoa throughout the first few tastes, the roastiness and underlying bitterness develop on the palate as you progress through the glass. It starts with some nutty, caramelish cocoa; followed by rising notes of fruitiness. As it crosses the palate, dark chocolate emerges but morphs quickly into bittersweet chocolate as the hop bitterness begins to rise. Some underlying leafy hop flavor is sometimes noteable at this point. Roastiness, and even some smoky character, become evident at the swallow; and lead into a long, dry finish that's roasty, chocolatey and bitter with some leafy/floral hop character giving it depth. It's almost a touch woody as it lays in the mouth. Really nicely complex while maintaining a great deal of drinkability in it's body and mouthfeel. Worth trying!","NeroFiddled","May 06, 2003"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a very dark amber, almost black color. It formed a medium tan small bubbly head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt and roasted coffee. A flavor of malt and roasted coffee with a touch of burnt bitterness in the finish.","Wildman","Apr 05, 2003"
3.44,-8.5,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nice dark black color, with a huge, chunky, creamy tan colored head, great retention. On the nose the aromas were faint really just whiffs of black coffee. Mouthfeel is creamy and fairly smooth. On the palate the flavors were mild, light malt flavors coffee, hints of caramel, not as sweet as like, bitter roastiness in the finish.

3.97,5.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Clear, dark brown to walnut brew forms a rocky tan head which sits atop medium sized bubbles. The head is clingy and meringue like with good retention and nice lacing. The aroma is very nice... like dark-roast freshly ground coffee, fresh grains, semisweet chocolate, vanilla and chalk. Begins with semisweet coffee, vanilla, cocoa, and chalk followed by a light earthy bitterness and long roasted tones. There is a touch of floral hoppiness in the burnt finish. Thinner mouthfeel than I am used to in a stout, perhaps because it's filtered. Pretty good job they've done here, but it would benefit from being smoother and full-bodied. This brew is good, but it just didn't excite me much, Was a bit too, well, "Out of Bounds" for my likings.","Mitchster","Jan 05, 2003"

3.21,-14.6,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours black with some deep brown hints on its edges and a nice thick brown head that sinks to a thick fil on top of the brew but coats the glass nicely. Some chocolatey-caramel malt aromas are in here but there is also something that doesn't belong and I can't pick it out. Starts off thin and watery. Goes quickly to a big sweet chocolate taste with some roasted/burnt malt flavors following on the heels of the sweetness. The finish gets a bit metallic and burnt (not in a good way). Brew is, at first a bit thin before picking up to a decent, but still slightly thin, body. Metallic and burnt flavors at the end take some away from this brew. It seems to fall just a bit short of being really good. The flavors are a bit raw without any smooth transition between them. I agree with Cokes, if they just put a little bit of time in then they could make this a fine beer, but it definitely isn't there yet.","Murph","Nov 19, 2002"
