"Not sad I tried it, but probably not going to  have this one again which is disappointing. Judging by the great overall rating but lackluster recent reviews, maybe the brew has changed."

"Creamy and a fair amount of chocolate. Nothing really stands out about this one in a competitive style these days"
""
""
"A very nice, mild chocolate stout. Not heavy...nice balance of taste."
""

"Pours a dark black color loses its head and not much lacing. Not as smooth as some. A little bite on the back end that somehow shouldn't be there"
"Dark, chocolatey, smooth stout. Not bitter at all. Very good."
""
"Pleasant overall. age muted the flavor somewhat but not in a offensive way."
"Poor head retention.  Off taste--sour notes over power cocoa intentions.  Strong sour aftertaste."
"A bland, oddly flavored stout well below the class of many others.  Would not buy again."

"O.  The lack in depth of flavor and aroma disappointed me but it was still drinkable.  I don't think I'd but again however."

"Black in color,but some light does manage to peek through. A fingernail thin layer of khaki colored head is present and doesn't cover quite the entire top. Light notes of chocolate are all I get with the aroma. I get predominately sweet chocolate and a light,neutral hoppiness in the front of the palate. The mouth is a bit sticky and viscous. Somehow the chocolate and the hoppiness comes off a bit cloying. Sweet and slightly bitter is odd."

"Overall - Boring, weak flavored and lacking chocolate. If it wasn't for the molasses this would be one bland beer. Nothing id want to drink again."
""
""
""
"Overall- There are better stouts to be had than this. While the flavor isn't bad it is rather weak. It needs a little more carbonation also."
""
"Not impressed. Would be a recommended buy at $2, but at $2.69, I'd say pass. Rather than compliment, the molasses seems to dominate. Not in that this is an overwhelmingly sweet beer (though it is quite sweet), but in that the flavor of it with the cheap grainy vibe I pick up is just not something worth $2.69 a pop. Cocoa Loco is a pretty good beer, but after having Too Cream Stout, this beer just isn't doing it for me."

"This is a well-made beer. The mouthfeel alone makes it worth a try."
""
"poured onto a 16 oz tumbler - only slight head with virtually little retension. mild aroma with a decent first taste but a rather musty aftertaste. Not as heavy or as flavorful as you would expect a full body stout to be. weak on flavor. does;t compare w/ most stouts on the market today - will not buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad, but not as chocolatey as the name would imply. Also I don't notice much sweetness in spite of the lactose. For what would seem like a similar brew to Moo Hoo, I'm a bit disappointed. If the weird boozy flavor wasn't there, I would like this better in spite of the low amounts of chocolate."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/26/2013. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, molasses, raisin, light coffee, light anise, light cream, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Ok aromas with solid balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and cocoa/molasses notes; with decent strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, molasses, raisin, light coffee, light cream, light anise, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, molasses, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, raisin, light anise, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and complexity of bready/roasted malt and cocoa/molasses flavors; with good robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a solid stout. Solid robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt and cocoa/molasses flavors; and very smooth to drink. A fairly enjoyable offering."
""
""
"All things considered, this makes for a very enjoyable beer, in its own right. Stocky, bitter, gooey, and full of warmth; Cocoa Loco is solid. They really should've upped the ante and threw in some chipotle peppers into the fermenter, but that's just like my opinion, man. Cheers!"

"O: Disappointing. ABV seems much higher, say 10%, it lacks balance, and roasted malts lack prominence, I suspect my rating will be noticably low, but I'm actually being a little geneorus, suspecting this may be a bad bottle; but then again, there's no reason it should be."

"t first it seems it's not a particularly big stout, but it does end up having quite a bit of heft. The body is full and rich, with a good creamy bulk to it. It's fortunate that it doesn't sit to heavy, and I think a good balance is struck in the feel as well as in the other aspects. The combination of thickness and sweetness tends toward a sticky feel, but it's ultimately kept in check."
"overall - okay, but certainly doesn't live up to the ""loco"" chocolate level in my opinion."
"Really flavorful and tasty stout, good rich character, definitely worth trying and I would have it again."

"A interesting try but not hitting the mark for me."
""

"Poured like a stout, thick and black with a nice khaki head that stayed for a minute or two. The scent is weak, a bit of malt, a bit of Graham cracker, even a bit of chocolate. The taste is nice, not overly flavorful, but nice. The chocolate and Graham cracker are there, nothing complex but nice. There's a touch of alcohol on the finish but I like it! This brew is nothing special but I'd certainly drink it again and enjoy it."
"Unfortunately, I never did no matter how much this warmed up. It felt a lot stronger than it actually was and the kind of chocolate that this emulated was not powdery enough to match the flavors and aroma. This was a different Stout but certainly not better and with so many coming onto the shelves this time of the year, there are plenty of better options to spend your money on."
"Pretty nice stout. Smooth creamy body with a decent amount of carbonation. Mild chocolate and cocoa powder up front rolls into a bitter black chocolate and coffee taste with an underlying earthy bitterness. Faint chalky mouthfeel. Good balance. Faint alcohol heat and mild bitterness that builds on the back of the tongue. Not overly complex but has enough going on. Overall a pretty nice stout but should definitely come in 6 packs. Alcohol heat and astringency takes away from the beer slightly."

"A flavorful stout that is unbalanced and gets better as it warms, but it’s only above average due to the nice complex roasted malts and chocolate flavor that basically rule the taste. It was good and I enjoyed it, but I wouldn’t run out to buy it, yet I’d definitely have it again if I saw it at a bar."
""
""
"D/O: Enjoyable and repeatable."
"Overall a great stout and I like the creative additions to the recipe. They definitely spent some time with this perfecting the balance and the result is very tasty!"
""
""
"Not bad at all. Much more bitter than I'm used to in a stout brewed with lactose but an interesting combination. Worth trying but I don't think I'd pay over $3 for another bottle."
"Overall, it's an OK beer."
"Overall- Good brew here, very mocha like. Tasty bl"
"D: Very drinkable. Not the best stout I've had, but overall it was very enjoyable. I would definitely drink again!"

"Pours dark brown in color with a khaki head. Maybe a touch watery on the nose, but otherwise nice roast and chocolate aromas. A hint of coffee and some molasses for sweetness. The flavor isn’t bad, but similarly watery. Cocoa/chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt make up most of the substance. A slight sweetness of toffee and molasses, too. Not bad, but not great either."
""
""
"O: A decent beer. One I'd gladly drink again, but won't go seeking out."
""
"An awesome looking stout that was very drinkable. The flavors were muddied up at times, but the clean and sweeter finish were the highlights of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Sweet and smooth throughout the taste. A bit dry on the finish. Medium-bodied and a pleasant, easily drinkable sipper."
"O - I’m not sure why everyone is hating on this beer so much. I thought it was a very tasty stout. Yes, it’s mostly all the way over on the sweet rather than bitter side of the spectrum, but not artificially so. I think the lactose blends well with the molasses and chocolate, which I definitely thought had a strong presence here. I thought this was a tasty beer, and I’ll look for more from Arcadia in the future."

"This beer pours pitch black with a rather modest one finger of a brown head, not a whole lot of retention. The smell is quite nice on this one, some cocoa and coffee as well as some roastiness, the smell is this beers best quality. The taste of this beer is chocolate, coffee and a nice complex malt variety. I do think this beer could have lost the lactose sugar and been fine because its a little too bitter sweet. Overall this is a solid stout, not as heavy on the chocolate as I would have liked but a pretty solid offering from Arcadia."
""
"I wasn't expecting much from this beer. I picked up a single simply because the description sounded interesting. It's a nice beer, but I probably won't buy it again. I have found better milk/sweet stouts than this."
""
"I get a stout’s nose full of roast and a bit of the lactic stout aroma. If I was to map the flavor out I’d say that there’s a bit of a roast up front, followed by a noticeable bitterness and a lactic sting, before finishing sweet and malty, yet dry. Flavor coats the mouth and lingers, in a way that I find enjoyable. A big, pleasing, dessert brew that I’d gladly try again if given the chance."
""
""
"O - I'm glad I bought only one bottle and not a 6-pack or case. What this beer has in look & feel, it lacks in taste. Wish there were more chocolate notes to this beer, especially if it's labeled as a chocolate stout. It's more similar to a milk stout than anything else, but a very lightly flavored one at that."
"M. Somewhat thin and watery, a bit too bubbly as well. Carbonation was distractingly high."
"O - I hate to dog on Arcadia beers, but this beer is not good. I bought a four pack and wish I hadn't. I haven't been this disappointed since Mackinac Island Fudge stout. I was really expecting a good to great beer. Not so much."
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed this stout - especially the bitterness that prevailed throughout the taste. There were some other sweet flavors going on that kept it easy to drink, but it was very robust, which I tend to want in this style. Good beer!"
"Overall- For the price, this beer is a rockstar. Let's be honest, this could not stand up to a barrel-aged stout or deep dark Russian, but for the style, it's spot on."
"O: Pretty average. Nothing sticks out as that great with this beer. Even the taste which is supposed tp be quite chocolately strikes me as fairly unremarkable."
"O- As I love chocolate stouts I wanted to love this beer but I cannot. Too much roast flavor and not enough chocolate"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little heavy on the chocolate side of things for my taste, but if you're a chocolate lover, this is your stout."
""
"NOTE: Live review."

"The mouthfell is grainy and tart. Sweet and tart in and out. Interesting."

"chocolate flavoring in it."
""
""
"O: The taste had wonderful depth to it , but this beer wasn't much to look at and the mouthfeel was a bit of a disappointment. Overall, I would call it a tie between this and Young's."
"It's a good stout, but there's much better out there on a regular basis. I bought this looking for something sweet and chocolatey and that's not what I got at all."
""
""
""
"Cocoa Loco pours a black color, with a darker tan head. There is a nice chocolate smell. The taste is creamy, its malty, but has a nice blend of chocolate that doesn't overpower; there is almost like a chocolate milk flavor. Very enjoyable and easy to drink, no problem having a few of these. Overall a very nice stout, the chocolate doesn't over power, mixes very well."
""
""
""
"O- Stradles the line between a traditional Americn stout and a double stout at 7% ABV. Kind of the best of both worlds, a nice sipper that doesn't knock you over. A lot going on with the chocolate, lactose, and molasses additions. Fortunately they compliment one another and nothing gets lost."

"The chocolate/cocoa character is well done but I'd like to see more complexity in the malt flavors to make this a better example of the style. None the less, a good brew and I'd not turn down another serving."
"Overall I thought this was an Ok beer. With a name like Cocoa Loco I thought that chocolate was going to be the main flavor in this beer but to my surprise it was the coffee that stuck out the most, the mixture of both was pretty nice and to my liking, but I would have liked the chocolate to be in the forefront and the coffee in the background. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it just looked really nice in my imperial pint glass. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, the carbonation was spot on but it just seemed to be a little thin and watery for the style. There wasn't a whole lot of drinkability in this beer, I don't think I would want to drink more then one in a sitting. I may pick this up when I need a coffee and chocolate fix and there is no FBS around but if I had to choose between the two it would be FBS every time, the taste is a little similar but FBS does it much better. If your a big fan of coffee and chocolate forward beers this is worth a try, but don't expect it to blow your socks off. This is a descent offering from Arcadia but when I can get FBS for the same price, I'll go with the FBS every time."
"Overall, looks, aroma and taste is all quite nice. A bit to thin for the style, but this is still something I would be happy having regularly."
"This brew pours out as a pretty nice looking deep brownish black color with a fluffy brown head on top. The aromas of sweet chocolate fill your nose right away with a little bit of hops in the far end of the aroma. The taste of the beer was pretty sweet with a light bitterness of dark chocolate in there. The other flavors of roasted malts come through after the swallow. The mouthfeel of the beer was medium to heavy with a smooth texture to it. OVerall I thought this wasn't a bad brew to try."
"O - Overall a solid effort, minus the clear alcohol presence in the taste. One to pick up for sure, but not necessarily one to keep going back to."
"all in all, I had high hopes, and this didn't really come close. not really together like I had hoped. not as full or rich as I wanted. but the flavors are unfortunately there, begging for a thick, rich, luscious mouthfeel that it just kind of falls flat, like a helium balloon a few days past its prime."
"O- Anything remotely decent in this beer is overpowered by an off flavor or unpleasant factor. Alcohol presence is just waaay to much like straight ethanol. This is the little beer that could... but didn't"
"Overall not bad, nice malt flavors, doesn't get too burnt or briny but the whole mouth and body just feel like it's missing something."
"O: The mouthfeel and sweetness really dominated this beer for me. Wanted to really love this beer, but it was a bit 'off'. Full disclosure, i drank this the same evening as i enjoyed a Founder's Breakfast Stout so my scores may be skewed slightly lower. Hard to compare to that one..."
"O/D: The chocolate isn't as strong as the coffee, but even that factor keeps it at a slightly above average stout."
"I don't know, this is a somewhat unusual beer what with the lactose, but it wasn't a beer I really got into. I may give it another try."
"its decent... kind of has an identity crisis. does it want to be sweet or roasty? does it want to be thin or full? does it want to be bitter or sweet? does it want to be chocolaty or milky? it falls short of being balanced because of the detectable off-flavors though if it went one direction or the other it may get past those off qualities. as it is, its a decent brew, but it falls short of many other available options."
"O: A very good stout. Something I could definitely stand to keep stocked in my beer fridge if it were available in my area. A solid B+ in my book."
"Overall: I would have liked this one to be a bit sweeter and have a thicker body. Overall it wasn't bad, but I don't know that I feel the need to have it again."
"O - Was actually darned good on nitro, and I'd try again. Is a good beer with dessert given the cocoa potency."
"This excellent stout is very dark with a thick dark brown head. The roasted malts and hints of chocolate come through on the nose as you take the first swallow. In the mouth it is very thick and creamy with a hint of spicyness that blends well with the chocolate and roasted malt flavors. Had this beer at The Good Life in Massapequa, NY."
"D - Great dessert drink; full of rich dark flavors and sweet too; needs to rid itself of the drip coffee taste and feel I get; should get a richer and deeper espresso taste to it; still comes well-recommended from me"
"O: Very smooth and tasty beer. It seems to fit more into the the Sweet Stout (13B) category than the American Stout category. A little more carbonation would bring this into the next level of greatness."
"Overall this is a darned tasty chocolate stout. Not as bold or thick as most others which makes it easier to drink, yet sacrifices thickness and creaminess. Has a fantastic and distinct cocoa aroma. This makes for a fantastic dessert beer."
"D: Very nice. I'd order another and buy again!"
"O - I think a richer mouthfeel could have saved this - would have helped that chocolate hang around and really pop, but it doesn't deliver."
"Overall pretty good. Right in the middle between a highly-drinkable session ale and a slow sipper."
"The third beer this evening for me was the Arcadia Cocoa Loco...and yes there is not question that chocolate was used to brew this beer. The color was absolutely dark with virtually no head. The smell was very chocolately and sweet....like molassis. The taste was very heavy...almost like a sweet liquior. Definite chocolate (semi-sweet) with molassis. Very rich...plenty of body...just too sweet for my taste. The mouthfeel was tough because of the sweetness...not enough balance."
"While drinking this, I find myself thinking that this is what the original ""chocolate beverage"" of native peoples could have tasted like. Sort of. While you can call this a stout, it's almost like it's own style of that genre: the super-chocolaty stout. The flavor is big enough to make this a sipper (and the alcohol level is just about there, too). If you enjoy chocolate, or chocolate-tasting beverages, you should check this one out. I know I'll be returning to it."
"GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"This pours slate black with just a little bit of light through at the edges. The head is two fingers, espresso crema colored, with a little lace. On the nose there is a great combination of ultra-rich chocolate, a huge molasses note, a slightly sour lactose note, a dark roasted malts. To me the only fault is that the lactose might be a step ahead of where it ought to be in the balance. In the mouth all of the parts of the nose are apparent on various parts of the tongue, with the lactose hanging in the background until a long finish leaves it as the last thing on the tongue. The body is medium light, much lighter than I'd have expected based on the nose and pour, and while it's not bad to the point of distraction, it's definitely short on body. Overall, this is a good beer that I might classify as a milk stout due to the lactose, which is just on the safe side of enjoyable for me."
"Overall: Fairly disappointed in this brew. It's drinkable (as in, I'm *going* to drink it), but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Perhaps my opinion is swayed because I had an RIS to precede this one...but seriously...beer is supposed to taste good no matter when you drink it, and this just isn't hitting the spot."
"I am more likely to go on the same cruise than buy this again, but the cruise would have been better had they had this brew."
"O: not bad, it's a bit of an oddity of sorts as some of the flavors are really indescribable but the complexity is there. It's probably a bit too outside the box for a lot of people and I wouldn't consider it sessionable. Not bad but not great either but if you want to try something a bit different this one wouldn't be bad to give a shot."
"This is a drain pour without question. I want to try this fresh but it seems all I see lately are 3-5 year old bottles of Arcadia's beers and they are showing up new to the stores. I have no idea if there's some weird issue with Kentucky's distribution chains or what. Either way I'm skeptical to blame this beer completely on the age considering all their beers seem to give off this odd flavor."
"D- Nothing outstanding either way, the abv is pretty well hidden and its a decently tasty brew but just not what I expected, I was expecting a big in your face stout. The label says its a Stout brewed with chocolate, mollasses, and lactose, in addition to the claim of it being chewey, it led me to thinking this beer was going to be a monster brew. So dont expect that but know its a very solid tasty brew."
"Brewed in collaboration with Sonny (of Cocoa Puffs fame). You never know. It pours a sleek obsidian topped by a lovely finger of cream-ecru froth. The nose comprises roasted malts, light coffee, very light molasses, and a touch of char in the background. The taste brings the roast back with a vengeance, along with some of that char and a heaping amount of bitter dark chocolate. It all comes out a bit astringent to the tongue. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta drying finish. Overall, a decent stout, but things didn't seem to come together all the way for me."
"D - Well for 3.50 a 12oz bottle I would never get it again but with no balance and such harsh roasted malt and cocoa tones it really doesn't seem worth getting again. There are more drinkable stouts out there, so avoid if you can."
"Drinkability - Not one I would like to drink straight very often. Possibly as something heavy to pair up with an overly sweet dessert. I think this is also best enjoyed in 8oz servings. Very much a sipper, not for quenching thirst."
"This is surely the most charismatic stout I've had thus far and I'll surely look for it again."
"The beer is kind of a mess. I did find it unique and interesting but other aspects of the beer did not sit at all with me."
"Overall- Big brew with a lot going on. Drinkability suffers a bit because of it. Feel like some time in the cellar might do it well. Tasty though with some fun mouthfeel thanks to their adjuncts! Cocoa and molasses are evident, but not overwhelming. If I see any more out and about I will lay a bottle or two down for a while to see if the flavors meld together a little better with some time!"
"D - Good drinkability for a bigger beer. Might be tough to put too many of these down - I'm really noticing the bitterness."
"Thanks Dan, for sharing this one last weekend. Poured a deep black color, with a thin beige head. Aromas of molasses, vanilla, creme brulee and milk chocolate. On the palate, this one was rather thin for a stout, with flavors of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt, with a rather bitter finish."
"Black beer. Creamy brown head. Moderate amounts of lacing. Interesting aroma and quite complex. I get the molasses in there, but also heavy chocolate, coffee and black licorice. Overall impression on the buds is fairly sweet, with the lactose and molasses and whatnot. Full flavored. There aren't many beers I'd just want one of, but this is one of them. Really heavy and rich. Definite dessert beer. Full bodied and viscous. Get flavors of leather and licorice as well. Baker's chocolate. Well done actually for the type of beer that it is."
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown/black color with a tiny bubbled tan head. Dark chocolate, oat, leather, and chocolate again domintate the aroma. Nice velvety medium mouthfeel. The taste is sweet up front with a sharp transition to some bittersweet chocolate notes along with some leather notes. Some booze notes as well along with a touch of metallic. Lingering bitterness. Some lace on the glass as the head settles. For being called Cocoa Loco I would like to see this have a more chocolate forward flavor."
"Very dense darkness with a small tan head that had decent retention before settling to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Pleasant aroma of something along the lines of chocolate milk and graham crackers. There is a little bit of alcohol that is detectable in the nose. The flavor is not quite so nice because the alcohol is hot for a 7% ABV stout. Otherwise the chocolate malt is featured nicely. Bitterness is moderate despite the lactose addition. Medium body with a nice texture. Not creamy but is soft and nicely carbonated. Not quite a desert beer as it is not very sweet but has some nice chocolate qualities."
"D: Overall I find this to be a some what good beer. I think that for a imperial stout 4pk. I would look in other places, as well as, if I wanted to show someone a chocolate beer, I would move on. As for this brew, it is a nice session stout, with nice flavors and complex subtleties."
"Pours near with with a nearly nonexistent head and no lacing. Somewhat forgivable given the style. Nose brings a good amount of cocoa and roast plus a touch of coffee and vanilla. Really strong cocoa. The taste adds in a bit of extra vanilla flavor, though it's quite faint. Delivers hard on the cocoa with quite a bit of roast in the background. Medium body and somewhat smooth. Actually, really smooth. Drinks really nicely. A solid hit for Arcadia."
"Drinks great- solid ABV here- a not sessionable but smooth stout."
"A standup beer. While not overly big as it holds on to its drinkable character, it's big enough to know that this is a sipper. Two thumb up here. If you are looking to pair this one, don't go for the usual chocolate; try it against some chili-infused chocolate or a spicy mole sauce over chicken."
"I could do two of these tops, but it's because it drinks like an imperial stout. I am really impressed with this beer. Hard to believe it is only seven percent abv. It is tasty and unique. This is a bit of a hidden gym with an overall score of a B. I recommend giving this a whirl."
"With as many good chocolate stouts as there are, I don;t think I'll give this one another try."
"Arcadia Cocoa Loco is a brown/black beer with a dense light brown head that fades to a film and leaves excellent lacing. It has a roasty aroma with notes of chocolate, coffee and licorice. It's smooth and full bodied with a scratchy, chalky finish. It has a nice, roasty flavor. It tastes just like the aroma. There's some sweetness to it and the bitter finish seems to come from the chocolate. It would be awesome if it wasn't so tongue shredding."
"Lighter body, carbonation is slightly low. Seems thin to me. A bit boozy after a few minutes. Not the amount of cocoa or lactose that I thought there would be. Rather disappointing."
"Overall, this beer was alright, but I have had much better. Too much lactose flavors. Not very drinkable because of this. I like some of the flavors, but wow this is drinking slow."
"Drinkability: Who says a big stout is not a good summer beer? :-) Very smooth, rich, and enjoyable without being ""heavy."""
"d - A decent stout with a lot of nice cocoa/chocolate. Would try again."
"D: The beer was relatively easy to consume and is a good dessert beer if you are looking for a somewhat dry stout that has flavors of bittersweet chocolate."
"D - A very good beer. Would drink ti again."
"I was hoping for a malt bomb and got a hoppy mess. The hops they used didnt fit the rest of the beer. Too bitter, west coast hops dont fit with this beer."
"Notes: This beer has a nice mingling of favor notes, firm palate and a very drinkable 7%abv. What is not to like?"
"Frinkability? A good sipper that I'd only want one of at a sitting but that's no reflection on the quality of the brew as it is good."
"D - Moderate drinkability. can be a hair filling - abv is higher, but manageable for light sessioning. Flavors are a hair potent for a multibeer run."
"D: the flavors have certainly transformed with a little age, the chocolate and cocoa are much more pronounced, as is the alcohol."
"D- a very average lacto, chocolate stout. I can't say I find anything overly tasty about this beer however I also can't say it's offensive either."
"Conclusion: Not bad persay, but not something I'd pick up again either. It's not good, it's not bad, it just kinda...is."
"D - solid effort top to bottom. Glad to see the bottle I marked down isn't reflected on tap, at least in this batch."
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a dark black color with a decent, frothy tan head, good lacing. Aroma is sweet and roasted malts, cocoa, a hint of metal, and a little bit of an acidic burn. Flavor is sweet and roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, and lactic acid. Mouthfeel is medium to full, creamy, soft carbonated and fairly bitter. Pretty good beer, lots of chocolate, gets more acidic at the bottom of the bottle."
"This is an enjoyable, fairly complex chocolate beer that marries flavors quite well. The smell is a distinctive dark chocolate and molasses. The beer is full-bodied, clearly showing it's 7.0% ABV, and has strong chcolate, roasted malt and caramel notes. While I enjoyed this, I'd probably stick to just one considering its strong flavor and heaviness."
"I would not buy it again with my dime, but would drink it again."
"D - this is a decent stout. At first I was pretty disappointed, but enjoyed it more and more as I drank it. Not bad, but nothing uberly special. Definitely worth a shot."
"D- Super drinkable! It went down way too easily and I'm reaching for another one!"
"D: Decently balanced, goes down quite easily, not an outstanding representation of the style, but it is rather drinkable and I wouldn't turn a pint away."
"I bet this is heavenly on tap, but in the bottle, there is an obvious problem. Drain pour."
"Next review!"
"Very dark brown, low carbonation, slight chocolate aroma that balances well with the hops and malt. A very good beer."
"D--Not a very compelling beer, the taste is okay, many better stouts out there,"
"D-average at best, I would not recommend this beer, mostly roasted malt and seems watered down"
"The beer started off alright, but the growler got tired really early. The score is a touch generous. It's merely the sum of it's parts."
"Notes: While the harsh bitter dark roast (nearly burnt!) malt reduced my enjoyment of this beer, it is clearly better than several of the other Arcadia Ales in that it provided much interest. Several of the others (Angler's Ale comes to mind) were really boring. Lastly, I do not know how this is not a milk stout."
"M/D - On the lighter side of medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Alcohol is very well masked and it is a very easy drinking beer."
"A Poured a very dark brown with a quickly disappearing head and little lacing. Smells of burnt chocolate with a hint of sour milk. Taste much better than the smell, sweet and bitter chocolate with a dry finish. Thin to medium body with medium carbonation.Actually pretty drinkable, I would have another if the price was right."
"Overall, I dug this one. Nice, balanced, drinkable beer. I didn't even notice the alcohol. Worth a try."
"Beer is black with a brown head. It doesn't last very long. The aroma is of chocolate, with a hint of vanilla, perhaps some butterscotch as well, although not much. The aroma of alcohol is present as well. Beer tastes a bit hoppy at first, more of a Goldings type flavor, this is followed by a rich roastiness and a malty sweetness, and finishing with a deep roasted note. The mouthfeel is very silky and smooth. Perhaps, I don't taste the chocolate as strongly as it might be implied on the packaging, but I think it's more in the aroma. This beer is pretty darn drinkable!"
"Poured a very dark brown with a very generous head with that quickly dissipated to a thin skin. The aroma was chocolate. The taste was chocolate and molasses, but weak, uninspired. Feel initially felt light bodied with moderate carbonation, but as it warmed, medium while losing some of the carbonation. Drinkability is fair. Loco did improve as it warmed. Probably worth a tasting, but don't make the mistake of buying more than a bomber."
"Pours a deep black with no visibility through the brew. Up top is a 1/2 finger tan color head that lingers around a while. Smell is dominate with chocolate. Nothing else really hits the nose. Taste is sweet milk chocolate. No bitter finish and not much alcohol is noted. I am a little disappointed in that yes the quaff only consists of chocolate, it is not a very overpowering, in your face taste. It is a little too smooth and light for my liking. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is mediocre. I am usually nuts about this style of beer but the thing I like about them is the overpowering chocolate taste that makes the style. Overall I think it is pretty solid and will continue to stock some in my DBF when available."
"Poured near-black, with zero head into a Guinness glass. Absolutely zero hint of hops in the nose or flavor. If you're a chocolate fanatic, the smell will be addictive, as there are no other discernible aromatic characteristics. The flavor is absurdly thick and chocolate for a 'beer'. I've had good chocolate stouts before, but the good ones were balanced with hints of hops and other flavors; this beer is one-dimensional. Think chocolate milkshake without the dairy. Too thick to drink more than one."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black. A clump of brown, loose bubbles forms up, around 1-2 cm, but it falls fast. Leaving only a bit of lacing. Fits the usual description, nothing impressive. The comes off first with a nice roasty whiff floating on the CO2. Then comes the chocolate, it starts out like raw cocoa powder, but then it gets creamy and full, there's almost a milky smell (surprise, there's lactose, after looking at the bottle). It smells sugary, but not sickeningly sweet, actually, once tasteing it, it's not even close to being as sweet as it smells. I actually which the taste was a bit sweeter, but there's plenty that is interesting in there. Taste's like dessert without quite as much sugar. There's a nice molasses presence, combined with the cocoa powder (that's a bit of an obvious statement I suppose). There's a bit of a slickness, which is common in dryer stouts. There's a bit of a cherry or raspberry taste, too. The molasses flavor is most prominent in the taste, but the chocolate does not have a very major presence here. The taste isn't exactly exceptional, but it's interesting, and could definitely be worse. I would say that there ought to be a bit more sweetness, maybe a bit more roastiness, and if it's supposed to be 'cocoa loco', then the chocolate should be toned up in the taste. Also the body is a bit on the thin side of medium, which isn't much in the stout category. The carbonation is kind of nice, not stingy, not harsh, but pleasant. But still, this is about average in the style. Overall, I think it's just a bit too dry, and a little too slick. It's a fairly enjoyable drink. Not too heavy or high in ABV, but I don't think I would buy more. It's enjoyable at least once, and interesting, but it doesn't exactly deliver completely on what I was hoping for."
"A sessionable stout, and one I would seek out again."
"Flavor definately didnt improve as it the brew warmed. No signifigant difference in flavor than an average stout. Mouthfeel was too heavy to enjoy at its ""seasonal release time."" If you are expecting something special don't was you time on this one."
"D. I would reccommend this beer to a serious beer advocate, but not to newcomers to hoppy chocolate beers. I thought this was great."
"Pours very dark brown, just about black in the glass. Very little khaki colored foam. Nose is sweet, roasted chocolate with some nutty notes with a touch of molasses. Mouthfeel is very rich and heavy, but creamy and surprisingly carbonated. The sweetness really comes out. Very creamy roasted taste, almost like something you'd get at Starbuck's. Pretty much understated flavor for a big beer like this. Oh so smooth though. Really a nice big stout without being overbearing."
"D- Very drinkable! Very tasty! I didn't even know this was a vintage 2006 till I got home. I would like to try one fresh and record the difference (if any). I enjoyed this beer very much and do recommend it."
"Drinkability: Even as I take the last sip, I still love the nose on this one. It's too bad that this beer fell kinda fell flat after that. With a few more adjustments, this one could really be something special, but right now it feels like an unfinished product."
"On tap at Mr. Goodbar,dark pour. significant chocolate and coffee, but otherwise unexceptional, burnt more than roast, when so many are doing the similar, so similar ranking. Brown with white head. On the sweeter side, despite English Progress, Liberty, Summit"
"Medium bodied with a smooth feel that makes it fairly easy to drink."
"I'd probably drink this one again, if given the chance. I won't go out of my way to track it down, though. More of a dessert beer than anything."
"All in all, not one of my favorite stouts, but an interesting and enjoyable brew for sure."
"The feel is dry but oily and slick. Thick and tremendous. It's a heavy and really outstanding chocolate stout. Sweet, dry, bitter, nutty and everything in between. Excellent."
"It was a decent beer, but as I had in a series with some that were much better, my memory is a little skewed, and my notes are a little sloppy. At the time I thought it was a B+. So I'd order it again."
"D: Though this one is not bad, there are so many better stouts out there."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. This stout appears a deep dark brown color with about an inch of lingering, ecru foam. Notes of milk chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, medium roast coffee beans, mocha, a hint or raisin, sweet malt. The stout falls somewhere between medium and full bodied and is adequately carbonated for the style. No doubt about it, this is a chocolaty stout. Tasty stuff. This would be a good candidate for a nitro tap."
"Drinkability: Not too bad at all - very enjoyable beer with a body that doesn't sit like a brick and pretty moderate ABV. This is pretty close to a sessionable stout."
"drinkability this is a pretty good chocolate stout and isn't overpowering in it though"
"Notes: Despite the name, this is really a milk stout. I was really hoping for more chocolate, specifically fresh cocoa nibs! I didn't get it. As a result, I tried to rate it fairly even though milk stouts are one of my least favorite styles."
"Drinks fairly easy, not a stout I could pound every night, but going down great on cool April fool's evening... Nice one from Arcadia"
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, slightly filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer to drink for a while but there are others in the style that I would choose first."
"Decent but expected a bit more cocoa/chocolate flavor from this."
"D- The sweetness does become a bit overwhelming. A nice desert beer."
"Pours a deep black with a 1cm brown head. Sweet chocolaty aroma. Acidic yet sweet chocolaty flavor. Moderate mouthfeel. I felt like the slightly sour (yes, somehow it was sweet and sour) acidic flavor was too much for the brew and tended to dominate. I wouldn't mind smelling this beer again, but with all of the great Chocolate stouts out there I'd probably go with something else."
"Though it does not have anything to do with the actual quality of the beer, I would like to note that the label of the person going mad on this bottle is amongst my all-time favorite. This beer was a nearly-opaque, dark brown/black color. The two-fingers of mocha-colored head displayed decent retention especially as a skim and very good lacing like torn sheets. The aroma was full of milk chocolate, cocoa and hints of coffee and earth. The flavors were similar, starting sweet with lots of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, notes of earth and coffee in the middle and a baking chocolate bitterness on the finish. Rather one-dimensional, but if you like chocolate it's a great choice. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation medium."
"Pours an opaque dark reddish brown, black away from the light but some dark red in the edges, very thick tan head forms, keeps a nice layer and ring, great retention. Smell is okay, dry and toasty, cocoa powder, raisins, caramel sweetness, brown sugar, light roast and chocolate malt, quite fruity, but not as much going on as I would like, bland. Taste is very milky, sweet and caramelized, toast, chocolate roast, coffee, raisins and dark fruit, chocolate milk and coffee, very dry in the finish, lightly sour. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, pretty interesting although nothing real special going on. Thanks Russ!"
"D: Pretty good, I suppose, especially if you're a coffee fan."
"Overall a tasty stout."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Maybe I just got a bad one. I'll try it again but only to see if this one was a bad one, if it tastes the same I'll pour it out and get something else. I finally put my finger on the aftertaste and the smell this is going to sound weird but it almost like a brine or olives, not something I want in my beer, maybe a martini but not my beer."
"Not at all what I was expecting or hoping for."
"Has a smooth feel that compliments the style. One major downfall for this beer is an acidic feel that leaves it sitting heavy in your stomach. It gets hard to drink, though I suppose it'd be easier with some food."
"smooth. full body. good carbonation. nice beer. could not drink more than one in a sitting. will try again next year- and maybe sometime in between."
"Overall a very interesting drinking experience."
"Pours into a pint an inky black with a dirty tan head that's thin but lingering. The head boils over the top of the glass no matter how you control the pour or clean the glass. Deep black in the glass with almost no light getting through. Nose of roasted coffee & burnt molasses. On the mouth, the carbonation rules from start to finish. Flavors are of bitter chocolate, over-roasted coffee and black strap molasses. The finish is brief and driven by the zing of carbonation. Pairs well with hearty rustic fair on a winter evening. Lacks sufficient balance to stand out in a crowded stout field."
"Pours a deep cloudy brown almost black with a thing tan head. Smells like a sweet milk stout can't pick up to much. Taste is big, not a heavy bold drink but a lot of flavors going on. I can definitely pick out the carmel, chocolate, and milk flavors. The sweet milk comes overtop and blend all the flavors together well. A good creamy mouthfeel, no bitterness and good drinkability."
"This is awful. Down the drain she goes."
"Hmmm... strange taste on the first drink... starts with a super sweet tang and metalic flavor. Then a strong cocoa-mix taste comes through and lingers on the palate. Sure is chalky. Very different from any other beer I have had. Mouthfeel seems to be thin, but like I said the beer sticks around even after you think it's gone. It seems to stick to the roof of your mouth and gums. Drinkability is not high given I don't think I would ever crave or pick this up again."
"Finally a good regular stout that I can get pretty easily!"
"D - Very drinkable, good flavor and texture. Not much Coco, and certainly not ""loco"" with coco."
"Pours a two finger tan head that leaves a good lace. Totally black color. Molasses nose. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Flavor is smooth, molasses, some baker's chocolate at finish. $7.10 for a 22 oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Overall drinkability is about average. Can't see drinking this one too often, or more than one or two in a sitting, but could be a good treat."
"D: Goes down pretty easy. Not one to have a lot, but a good treat."
"Taste was sort of a let down from the smell. Definitely detected cocoa, a very dry cocoa taste. Not as sweet as I thought it would have been. Very dry and I must say, I did like the fact that it was dry. This stout was good, but was missing something that I can't put my finger on (maybe a touch more of hops?). Needs a little tinkering and this could be a very good stout!"
"Very dark chocolate brown in color with reddish tinted maltshop head that doesn't stay too long but leaves a healthy cap and some thick & runny lacing. Huge on the cocoa in the scent. Other aromas are of Tootsie rolls, a really warm roasty malt, more than a dash of molasses and a pinch of alcohol. The flavor and feel of this fuller end of the medium scale body wise beer is a chocolate malted. The use of lactose in the brewing process brings out a creamy quality that compliment the super huge & rich cocoa flavors melding them together nicely than just leaving each other stand apart. As it warms it does take on some bitter & dark chocolate characteristics but still has soothing texture all the way down. The aftertaste has a some warming effect from the alcohol and slight bit of a powered chocolate used in baking but has a silky feeling keeps it from lingering around too long."
"No doubt, this is my favorite of the big bottle series. Unfortunately, that's not saying much at all. It's definitely got chocolate, but it's the dry kind you'll find in Ommegang's Chocolate Indulgence. (Sweet mother of malt, did I just compare these two beers?!) Not a whole lot of depth or complexity to this one, just a lingering, rather pleasant sweetness that saves what is otherwise a middle-of-the-road brew."
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"A bomber poured into a pint glass. Black in color with a voluminous tan head that rapidly disappeared. A faint chocolate aroma, not much else there. It tasted like a chocolate malted with some hops. Pleasant mouthfeel, just not a real exciting American Stout."
"Can't beat the Southern Tier or Rogue Chocolate."
"I liked it alot and wouldn't hesitate to have it again, but my brother didn't like the dry, bitter finish. But he doesn't like anything remotely bitter."
"Oh, and 7.0%, you would not know it. Very smooth and drinkable."
"Pours pitch black with a foamy coffee-colored head. Roasted chocolate malty aroma with hints of coffee and caramel. Very smooth roasted malty flavor with a sweet creamy chocolate center and a bitter roasted coffee finish. Also, hints of toffee and caramel."
"Overall, a good try, but nowhere near thick, creamy, and sweet enough."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick and creamy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice chocolate and roasted malt scent along with a sweet lactose aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a complex flavor arrangement that boasts of chocolate and molasses as well as a bit of milk sugar. It's dry with a nice roasted edge to it. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a solid chocolate stout. It's beautiful to look at and it tastes great also."
"I would say it was above average overall, but not great. Very rich and a great foam, very similar to a Guinness in appearance, body and color. A sweet aftertaste, with a hint of chocolate and some molasses flavor. It is a sipping beer for sure and would probably go well for just sitting around with some friends and just there to enjoy the flavor of a good beer, wouldn't go well with wings or nachos or anything like that. Very good for people who like Guinness but want something with fuller taste and a bit sweeter."
"Notes from 5/11/07"
"Tasted a bit too sweet, a bit similiar to Southern Tier Creme Brulette (note the label, if you can read it, includes Lactose and Molasses) There was a cocoa taste and aroma as well. Mouthfeel was a bit thin and oily, but drinkable. Overall, probable better on tap or out of a more appropriate serving vessel."
"I will be indulging in this one on a regular basis!"
"D: Super drinkable and nice. Got a 12oz on draft and it was perfect. Really great beer. Get it on cask if you can."
"12oz bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester, Maine. Pours an opaque black body with a thin film of tan head. Smells nutty, somewhat chocolatey, maybe some banana? Tastes like chocolate for sure, sweet, some caramel malt, somewhat nutty, some vineous/raisin qualities. Chocolate dominates though. Super-smooth medium to full in body with ample carbonation. No alcohol apparent anywhere. A super-tasty, well-crafted American stout, one I have difficulty finding much wrong with. Very good. Definitely one I'll be snagging again should I see it again."
"This is a tasty well balanced beer. The chocolate does not overwhelm and there's just enough bitterness to ease the sweet flavors."
"Overall - a very different beer in style. Interesting though very different from an imperial ale as it is listed."
"mouth is thick and oily, bitter in the aftertaste but amooth the whole way down. suprisingly good because the bartender just gave me one and said ""you'll like this"""
"Overall, I was impressed with this stout. The nice chocolate flavors and no perceived bitterness made this extremely drinkable. I will continue to buy this one."
"D: Alcohol is quite well hidden, and the flavours are similar to some other brews that take it in a similar direction, though something seems to be missing. It's good, not great, but I'd get it again."
"A good stout although a bit too sweet for my taste. Give it a try if you're into milkstouts or similar ales."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark dark dark brown that let no light pass. It had a nice 2 finger light brown hot chocolate colored head that lingered well and left a nice ring. Smell reminded me of a sweet mocha or possibly a Hershey's bar. Taste was definitely cocoa with a bit of bread, almost seemed like a smore w/o the marshmallow. Felt bitter and acidic in the mouth, and was a little watery. Drank fairly well for an imperial stout, but the bitterness/acidity made me drink it even slower than normal."
"D - This has complex and unique flavors and isn't over the top powerful."
"Body a bit north of medium, creamy and slick. Good drinkability, alot of flavor for a 7% brew."
"Mouth feel is smooth and creamy. For a double stout however I just feel this is not a big enough brew. While very enjoyable as it is, I prefer my double/imperial stouts to be big ugly nasty huge flavored beasts. Drink more like a standard stout than an imperial."
"drinkability; ehh"
"D : Real easy to drink, one I would love to have again. It would probably go really well with a good cheesecake."
"D: A decent desert beer. Not the best I've had, but it will do in a pich."
"D- Pretty good. It went really well with the chocolate custard dessert I was eating."
"Pours a dark brown/licorice black with 2+ fingers of creamy tan head. Good retention and some lacing. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate, lactose, and molasses. Tastes of sweet milk chocolate, light molasses, raisins and other dark fruits, dark chocolate, and roasted malt. Finishes with a touch of coffee beans and some sour milk notes. Medium in body and low in carbonation, smooth and creamy with a light bittering and sour finish, hides alcohol nicely."
"Pours a deep opaque black with a thin head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma is powdered cocoa against some mild roasted barley. the taste is an abundance of cocoa and roasted barley. The beer is very crisp and smooth, especially for the style, making it very enjoyable, even on a hot summer night."
"Worth a shot..."
"D - Great beer. This is my first sample from arcadia and I didn't know what to expect but I am happily supprised."
"Tasted on 5/16/08."
"This is as advertised--lots of cocoa and semi-sweet chocolate flavors. It's worth trying simply because it is such a pleasant departure from the style. I'd love to try it against other big chocolate stouts/porters."
"Deep chocolate colour, poured from the bottle to a .5 liter glass full of foam, just too frothy! Taste was slightly creamy, there was a bitter aroma detected here...This is not one of the best stouts I've had, and it left me disappointed. I expected a more chocolate feel. I also detected a bitter aftertaste..."
"Me and my wife had dinner @ arcadia last night. I saw on the board that there was a double imperial chocolate stout being served and I nearly creamed my pants, here I am thinking Rogue Chocolate stout. Well WOW I don't think I have ever been so disappointed by a beer. The appearance was nice but that was about it. The flavor was borderline repulsive, drink this beer next to a Rogue Chocolate stout and tell me how u give this beer anything higher than a c?!?! The mouthfeel was also very uncomfortable. Calling this a Double Imperial Stout is travesty it tasted more like a skunked Milwaukee's Best with food coloring in it."
"seems to be a very mild hint of cinnamon flavor in there too, along with some milk chocolate flavors. it wasn't as sweet as i had expected, but there was a sweet creamy malt thing going on, similar to an irish carbomb. the creaminess was there, but mild. doesn't really seem much like it belongs in the IS category, but it's still decent."
"Drinkability - this is okay, but there are plenty more complex, tasty stouts to be had."
"It is kind of like the best glass of sour/semi-sweet chocolate milk you will ever have (that is not a put down either, just very unique!)"
"The aroma is roasted malt, espresso beans, and cocoa powder. First sip reveals fine tingly carbonation and a smooth velvety texture. Flavor is roasted malt with some sweet chocolate and a bit of coffee dryness. Hints of molasses and general sweet malt as well. No hop presence or hints of ABV. A pretty big beer that is easy to drink. Nice well crafted beer."
"MF&D - IMO a little too much carbonation for a stout. When I swirled it in my mouth it seemed to foam up like crazy. I enjoyed the aftertaste, I only wish the stout tasted more like it. Worth a try, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for it again."
"Not a big fan of this beer. That sourness and nose burn bugs me. Might try one more time on tap."
"MF&D- This beer is fairly thin for a stout but still remained creamy. It coated the mouth well with a slightly sticky feel and left behind a slight alcohol warmth."
"Enjoyed this at 08Long Island Spring Festival when poured into mini heffe glass by Phil Agues of Manhattan Beer Distributors, on behalf of Arcadia. Apprearance jet black with brownish hues with respectable 1.5 finger head with prolonged lacing. Smell of rich roasted chalky earth. Taste has pleasing lactose to provide a mild but complex and medium Mouthfeel. Phil said Aracia used open vessel fermination technique was used on this batch along with the Imperial. Top notch session beer and one of the easies chocolate stout to quaf."
"Glad to find this one on tap @ Holy Smoke in Mahopac, NY (This place is quietly becoming quite the beer destination) In a wine glass, this one poured quite black under a dark tan head. Lacing was present and respectable. Cocoa and light chocolate on the nose. Impressive stout, nice light chocolate notes, darker malts and some sort of sweat/slightly sour thing going on. Pleasant and highly quaff able for a larger (but not huge) stout. Nice stuff, would work with a chocolate dessert, but also helped wash down a rib or two"
"Cocoa Loco has great color, almost a black color with a nice thin light brown head on it. The aroma of this beer is highlighted by a nice touch of dark chocolate and coco beans with a hint of molasses. The Loco's taste is a little unique. It starts off with a sweet hint of molasses and then comes in with a big bold dark chocolate/coffee. It goes down smooth with a little bit of a bite, that is a quality of most stouts but it doesn't linger."
"D: good drinkability, nice complexity makes you look forward to the next sip. rich, dark, yet smooth and refined on the swallow."
"An excellent pour...almost black....decent head. Smell is a delicious blend of malt, chocolate, coffee. Taste has a chocolate malt backbone with a strong coffee finish...lingering coffee aftertaste. Just a tad strong. Full bodied mouthfeel. A definite sipper due to strong coffeee aftertaste."
"Arcadia's Cocoa Loco is a bit sedate and rather less than hoped for in an imperial/double stout. The brew pours from the bottle a modestly dark color. The head is tan and foamy, but short lasting. The smell is horrendous, being the weakest feature of this stout, bringing forth unholy thoughts of stench associated memories from the deep depths of recall. Fortunately, however, the taste does not mirror the olfactory battery. While cocoa is not what comes to mind at any point, there is a nice roasted malty vanguard, followed by some nice bitter bites on the back end. The mouthfeel is smooth but thin. This is not a bad imperial stout, but this is not something I would recommend spending the dough on."
"In all, I wouldn't say this was a terrible beer, just not what the name implies and as an imperial stout it's just average."
"Drink: Really nice drinking and easy to sip on. Goes down easy at 7%."
"Overall: BeerTruth thanks for the try. It's a bit too lactic for me and rather light and thin for the class. I can see some really liking this one though."
"Pours very dark brown with a thick foamy light brown head, which stands up above the rim of the glass. Aroma chocolate and molasses, with some sourness in the background. Taste is sweet, chocolate, with some bitterness in the aftertaste. Tingly mouthfeel from the carbonation. Seems more like a sweet stout, was expecting more from a ""triple"" chocolate. Alcohol level is not apparent. At $3.50 a 12 oz bottle its over priced."
"Arcadia Ales Cocoa Loco pours a deep brownish black. It gives off distinct aromas of chocolate and molasses. The taste is a lot weaker than the smell would indicate; however, the chocolate and molasses do work well together. Mouthfeel overall is smooth with a slight bitterness lingering in the aftertaste. This was an ok drink to start, but it became a bit too bitter for my liking at the end."
"Overall an average milk stout, nice for after dinner. Would've liked a bigger alcohol kick."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours pitch black with no head. Nose is subdued. Slight amount of stout character. The chocolate just barely gets out to your nose. I am giving it a 3 because for a double stout, this should be showing my nose a bit more. Flavor is more towards the roasted side with a slightly metallic after taste. Feel is low on bubble, thick on liquid. Sorry, but I have to give this one a 3 for drinkability. Cocoa Loco? Where's the cocoa man?? A sad example of the style. And for the price...forget about it."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Oct 19th, 2007: Pours jet black with a medium thick tan head that does not have a lot of legs. Spotty lacing. Aroma of sweet milk chocolate and roasted malt, along with touches of coffee. Medium-bodied and creamy smooth with dark chocolate/mocha flavor with a little touch fo hops. The finish is chocolatety with a relatively short finish. Overall this beer really leans toward the chocolate side as the name implies, unfortunately to its detriment. Were this beer a little more rounded it would be a lot better."
"I'm not too impressed with this one. I got a little excited when I saw ""triple chocolate stout"" on the label, but really, this is just your run of the mill milk stout. I don't know why it's classified as an Imperial on here, as it barely resembles any Imperial stout I've ever had. I say skip this one unless you're a big fan of milk/ sweet stouts; only then might it be worth trying. Otherwise, not recommended."
"Drinkable, but failed to hold my interest. One 22 oz. bottle was more than enough."
"Bottle. Poured a blackish-brown color with a medium brown head. Good lacing. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, and molasses. Mouthfeel was thin and kinda watery. Flavor was malty with touches of chocolate and coffee. Not as flavorful as I would have liked, but decent nonetheless."
"Pretty tasty, more akin to an export stout, and the cocoa adds a nice twist without becoming burdensome."
"A pleasant Stout with unique flavor additions; however, this tastes much more like a Sweet Stout than a Doulbe Stout. Worth a try anyway despite the style mis-characterization."
"This beer poured a dark brown almost black color with no light penetrating it. It formed a medium tan foam head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, chocolate and coffee. The flavor was of malt, coffee and chocolate. The body was medium light. A bittersweet finish. The body was lighter than I expected for this style. Not a bad beer, just not a strong double stout."
"Pours jet black, with a small tan to no head. In the aroma, sweet oatmeal and roasty malt. In the taste, a sweet chocolate/ cocoa malt taste, with a dry end. A somewhat bitter mouthfeel, with a dry oatmeal/ malty aftertaste. Nice taste of chocolate, pretty smooth, and easy to drink for an imperial stout."
"2006 vintage, ""Stout brewed with chocolate, molasses and lactose"". Pours black with a solid half-finger tan head, looks great right off the top and I almost marked it higher for appearance. Slow steady carbonation was a bit subdued, some lacing. The smell is the first hint that there is a lot going on here - rich chocolate, the molasses sure comes through, then a burnt, smoky odour in abundance. The taste is similarly entertaining with chocolate and cocoa and a creamy-textured mouthfeel, rich but not overpowering. Gentle bitterness is nicely balanced with a dry, nutty aftertaste. Long finish. With air and warming, there were hints of sweet caramel, toffee, toast and malt in the choco-cocoa mix, but also a bitter brazil nut astringency that I could have done without. There is a sweetness that, at times was a bit surreal, maybe that was the lactose; it struck me as a bit artificial. Still, this is an amazing stout with layers of complexity to it, if you can get by that label, that is. Another fine purchase from Merchant's in Dearborn."
"Pours a great dark black with a nice tan head and decent lacing. Does not have much of a scent, just a slight bit of roasted grains and a little hint of why it's an imperial. Taste is rather bland. There are no roated grain hints, just a slight chocolate sweetness and a hint of the alcohol. I think they canceled each other out and didn't leave much else. Goes down all right for an imperial."
"D - Chocolate was just too powerful in this beer. The lack of other strong flavors to balance out the sweetness made it somewhat difficult to finish a 22 ounce bottle in one sitting."
"The drinkability is better as it warms, Yup I like this brew. Prosit, MK"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is okay. ABV is low at 7% for a ""big beer."" The acidic taste really prevents it from being smooth and hinders drinkability severly. Overall, it's disappointing. I had high hopes for this beer, but can't help but feel let down."
"22 oz. bottle, 2006 vintage. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours black with a half inch tan head. Not much lacing or head retention. It smells like chocolate, coffee, roasted malt and molasses. The aroma is nice, but it's weak. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also an acidic/sour taste in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with medium carbonation. It's smooth and has a dry finish. However, it's a bit thin IMO. Drinkability is OK, but it's nothing special. I was disappointed with this beer. There isn't enough cocoa in this beer for it to be loco. It's drinkable, but for the price ($6.99 a bomber) I think there are much better choices out there for the same price or less."
"Worth a try, but nothing to look for."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced and quite enjoyable. really much more of a milk/sweet stout than a double/imperial stout, but quite tasty. thanks jan!"
"Pours a coal color with a frothy tan colored head that disappears. Smell is of chocolate and some dried fruit. Taste is cocao and coffee but both are really mild. Most of the taste is covered up by some dried, not so tasty fruit. Mouthfeeling is watery and somewhat oily. Decent beer, but not outstanding."
"A ""big beer"" in their series that comes in at 7%? Wimpy,"
"at 7% it certainly is drinkable, however"
"Drinkability: This is the first time that mouthfeel was my favorite thing about a beer, but so be it; needs more cocoa flavoring"
"A very easy to drink stout, I finished off a 22oz bottle in very short order, A little bit on the pricey side, otherwise I would be drinking this regularly."
"Drinkability very good considering the modest ABV. Very easy drinking."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Pillowy head lasts nicely, with ample lacing. Aroma is cocoa with underlying fruity tart. Flavor follows along, moderate chocolatey sweetness to start, a tartness in the middle, and some alcohol warmth lingers. Mouthfeel is alright, not as smooth as I would have hoped, and drinkability is okay as well. Nowhere near what I was hoping for, have to revisit this sometime and see if it gets beefed up."
"Drinkability: Decent taste. The chocolate taste is good, but for a triple chocolate stout, I would expect more. Easy to drink at only 7%. I would not search this beer out, but I don't dislike it."
"Cocoa Loco's flavor profile is too disjointed for it to be great beer. My advice would be to cut back on the molasses, the lactose and the citric hops in order to concentrate on the Cocoa portion of the name rather than the Loco part."
"Nice beer, glad I picked it up"
"Pours a dark color with a tall head that has nice retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma had a lot of sweetness and chocolate with just a hint of roasted malt. The flavor was filled with caramel malts and cocoa notes along with a hint of lactic acid. Very smooth and tasty. Drinks very well for the alcohol and doesn't seem to have that strong of a punch. Thick bodied as well."
"Very nice beer, but much more subtle and down-to-earth than I expected, particularly because the previously drank Big Beers by Arcadia have been exceptional. The beer pours a viscous dark brown color with some chocolate milk-like haze, and an airy froth that laced quite well. The aromas were light and, again, took on milk chocolate notes with light Kona coffee, roasted malts, and caramel malts. The flavors are rich and full, but not agressive or strong by any means. The cocoa flavors rise above the coffee, nutty, malty notes. Light bittering only offers balance for the sweetness and no other contributing flavors or aromas. the body seems full and round, but not heavy or weighted at all -- remains airy. Finishes quite powdery, with a continuous cocoa flavor. Very nice, but quite mellow tasting and feeling for a bigger beer."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: Not a bnd brew by any means, but for the price tag I won't be buying this again. Many stouts both in and out of the ""imperial"" category that blow this one away for less of a wallet hit."
"Poured into a Guinness pint glass an opaque black no light even when held up to the light a large 2 finger fluffy mocha color head atop that settled very slowly into a near creamy-like mass.The molasses and chocolate used in this brew are the main components to the aromas with a light roasted note as well for the most part rather light aromas.Lighter mouthfeel than expected for a bigger stout but it goes down pretty easily,quite dry and earthy on the palate the molasses imparts a light sweetness but its very light the lactose I thought would provide a bit more sweetness all in all its rather dry and earthy the chocolate is there in essence form providing a little depth.Not bad but could much better this brew like alot of Arcadia brews meets with mixed results for me."
"Overall, I was surprised at how light bodied this beer was. A good summer time stout. Lots of new interesting flavors, but it seems to lack character and depth. Just plain pleasurable."
"Dark, dark brown in color. Slight cocoa tan head. Aroma of burnt chocolate with a slightly stale espresso odor. Ok flavor-decent blend of cocoa and roasted malt but nothing stands out one way or another. Somewhat dry and astringent tasting. Ok body-could use a kick in the pants when it comes to the mouthfeel department-rather thin for a double stout. No big deal overall. I was more impressed with the label then the beer."
"Drinkability - this is a decent beer, but not inspiring, it suffers from that acridity, I would not have it too often."
"Pours an opague thin motor oil with a tan head, that fell quickly, to a slight layer of bubbles with a little lacing. After the pour it smelled good, but once the head fell, I lost the chocolate scent. Roasted malt, molasses and a hint of coffee lingers. It's smooth on the way down and finishes a little dry, with minimal hop taste and aroma. It's dinkable but not sessionable."
"Nice dark black coloring with brown red edges and a thin head of cocoa. The smell is of a stout but were is the chocolate. Loco means crazy right well the lack of a crazy chocolate-like aroma leads to big no real taste of chocolate. I couldn't taste the choclate either and the beer was so thin it reminds me of Kate Moss. Looks can be deceiving and this one really leaves me scratching my head. I really love the regular brews from Arcadia but the big beer series is mostly junk. I hope the start over."
"Drinkability: decent. Not an overpowering double stout, almost a bit thinner than expected, but in no way is thin bodied. Not bad, I would probably have this one again in the future."
"Drinkability: Meh - it's really not that interesting. That said, it's pretty drinkable since the flavors aren't that aggressive. Could work as a crosssover to the dark side (kinda like killing sandpeople)."
"Not a double stout by any means. Flavors aren't in your face, and really fade into the background. I can buy a 6 pack of Mackeson XXX Stout, which is a much better beer, for the cost of one of these. Not worth it IMO."
"Mouth is bitter bitter dark chocolate. Medium-full bodied."
"I don't know if I'm ""loco"" about the label on this 22 oz. bottle. Pours an anticipated dark dark brown to nearly black. Small, frothy, cappuccino brown head. Settles quickly to a ring of foam. Nose of roasted malts, dark coffee, peppery spice, and dark chocolate. The chocolate aroma is on the bitter side with a light Hershey's syrup sweetness. Pretty good. Light roasted malt flavors greet the tongue, followed by a milky sweetness. Hints of sweet chocolate mix with singed fruits and coffee. Swampy, stale-ish finish is disappointing after a decent beginning. Roasted bitterness in the background, but the swampy cardboard/plastic is unavoidable. Doesn't taste infected but just off. Maybe it's from the chocolate? I don't know. Medium-bodied, with a chalky finish. Would be a nice beer if the finish wasn't off."
"Overall, this is an ok chocolate stout. Quite frankly, there are far better versions (Young's, Brooklyn's, Rogue's), but this is worth a try if you've had the others."
"The body is medium to full with a very gentle carbonation. Still seems watery, which is weird considering the body. Not something I'll ever want to try again."
"...though, actually, it is too big for me, alone, right now...oof, should have saved it for my next hot date or something...now, it's kicking in!"
"D:Good, but not the best chocolate stout I have had."
"drinkable enough. quite sticky, and a bit out of sync, but a decent attempt. if this does indeed turn into an annual, as the bottle indicates, i'll be curious to see if it improves. being what it currently is though, i'm not sure it's worth the price of admission."
