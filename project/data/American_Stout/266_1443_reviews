"Bonus: It is union made by the men and women of the IAM."
"Mid pack Stout. Solid."
"O: A richly-flavoured, very well-made stout. Sturdy enough to suggest sippability, but silky enough to support sessionability. Versatile and recommended."

"Coffee flavors up front and hints of chocolate. Dark and delicious."
"This disappointed me a little bit. It started well, but the end of each sip is just disappointing and bland. I wish it had a little more oomph."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste- roasted coffee flavor with a little chocolate."
""
"Taste is quite strong, so I don't think it's old. roasted malt, still slightly sweet. Couldn't get and chocolate, and only faint coffee notes."
""
""
""
"What a positive surprise. Very good stout. Intense and complex but not tiresome given its relatively light body, not being overly sweet and actually somewhat refreshing balancing its roasted and burnt notes. This is almos a RIS. Recommendable."

"Pours a deep inky black, with no light getting through. There is a smidge of dark tan head and no lacing. The aroma is strong alcohol esters with just a little bit of roasted malt. The taste flips this around with much more emphasis on the roasted malts. It has a slicker mouthfeel and a nice smooth finish. A very good stout."

"overall, it's very decent. but many low-abv stouts are. it is the higher-abv stout with exceptional quality which gains the notoriety, but this one will do. very nice!"
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: creamy and almost chewy; medium carbonation"
""

"O- Overall it's a nice American stout, fit to the style. I may be biased in my judging because I prefer the RIS. This may compete in that style as well."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid extra stout that has RIS and porter features. Pretty solid."
"A very good beer. Russian imperial stout for the little guy. I can't handle those 12 ABV brews."
""
""
""
"I love how dark this one is, almost inky looking. Can be compared to certain Imperial Russian stouts depending on the brewery. Hints of coffee, very smooth and slithers down your throat. Smells very robust like a porter and I sense a smoky smell as well. Just going by taste, it would be good with ice cream or some chocolate dessert. The mouth feel is good although at clocking in at 6.5% abv, it could use a little more alcohol to enhance the taste and even out the robust creamy coffee flavor. Great for the average stout hound."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a pitch black with a tiny brown head. Smells of coffee and slight chocolate. Tastes of chocolate and coffee, with slight vanilla taste intermixed. Beer is carbonated correctly and goes down smooth with its medium body. Overall, a slightly above average beer."

"Edit: I do realize that some beers (especially stouts) may have some yeast in them, but this was solid, thick, and absolutely coating the bottle. VERY unappealing."
"The taste just flat great...dry chocolate notes, malt and smoky coffee flavors fill the mouth. Crackery crust and dry grain ease to the back of a flavorful stout. For as thick and viscous as it pours the feel is rather thin but it doesn't draw away from a simply well done beer."
""
"This one surprised me a bit; it has all the flavor of a full-on Russian imperial, but with the body and alcohol content you'd expect of a more typical stout. Pours very dark - I expect there is some solids present here as well! Not much head. Aroma of, what else, roasted barley. Very full flavor, roasted barley and coffee, intense. How they got this much flavor into a fairly light-bodied brew I can only guess."
""
"I poured this one into a pint glass and was impressed with the dark, beautiful brown pour with a beautiful dark brown head (and I generally don't care about the head but this one is really good looking!) This is a DARK beer. Very tough to get any light through it. A nice chocolately, malty scent that is just right. Everything about this beer is tempting. Poured it, looked at it, smelled it, and was dying to taste it. This is what beer drinking is about. A percentage point or two of alcohol higher would of made this a total winner but who's to complain? I guess I'll just have to drink more than one. aftertaste lingers a bit longer than i would like and gets a bit sour on the tongue but the taste is good enough to sustain the linger. well worth the price!"

"O: This beer is very flavorful and nice and easy to drink. It seems to have a very good balance between the malts and hops."
""
"Overall, for something I just randomly found at my corner market, this was a treat. It’s a great beer to have around. Not as complex as some other stouts, but certainly a step above the common ones."
""
"Had again in March 2013. Much better. Roasty, full bodied and dry. Pretty decent stout."
""
""
""
""
"O- A fantastic stout. Very well balanced with roasted malts, dark chocolate/coffee, and citrusy pop of hops. Oh so drinkable. A very tasty offering!"
""
""
""
"This is a damn good stout. It's intensely flavorful but also easy to drink. I was really impressed by the intense chocolate notes throughout. This is definitely a refreshing stout that I would have again."
"O- I really like this beer. Balanced, flavorful and very drinkable. If you like this, you should also try the 8 Ball Stout from Lost Coast."

"This is an extremely unique, thick, full-bodied, rich Stout the way a Stout should be. When one decants a Steelhead, a thick layer of goodness can be seen on the bottom of each bottle. We have found that the beer becomes even more complex (if such a thing could be possible given the unbelieveable depth of this brew) if we decant 11 oz. then swirl the final ounce around to loosen the sediment before pouring the last bit. This also serves to create a beautiful thick, rich, dark brown head."
""
""
""
""
"I would have this one again, and I recommend that you try it if you haven't already"
""
""
""
"O: I like it a good deal, but I don't love it. A textbook example of a fallback stout when little else is available, but it's a great choice to fill out a mixed 6 pack with."
"Overall: A well done American Stout."
""
""
""
"Looking at others' reviews, I am baffled to see people rave about the mouth-feel. I've seen stranger things when it comes to beer though. I doubt I'll come across this one again to retry it, but you never know."
"Overall - A great American stout. Flavorful, aggressive, yet goes down with grade A smoothness. Sweet with a good amount of bitterness to balance things out. This is not one I'll quickly forget."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An impressive stout in a small package – can’t beat that. I’d gladly have multiple bottles with dinner sometime, or just on a cold night."
""
""
""
"Pours black with an effervescent mocha head and nice lacing. A nice rich, roasty aroma with some chocolate and coffee. A roasty flavor that dies just before it reaches burntness, some licorice, and coffee. Thinnish medium mouthfeel, some activiy, nothing noticeable. Overall, a solid stout. Drinking an Yeti Espresso Stout before this wasn't helpful to this beer's cause but I did enjoy this and will have to revisit it with a fresher palate."

"Overall- This extra stout tastes great! The wonderful flavor complexities make for an interesting and very enjoyable beer. I feel some of the flavors could have been drawn out even more and the feel could be creamier, but these are nit - picky things. Definitely have this if you can."
""
"O: I honestly didn't expect a whole lot from this beer but was quite impressed. The dark chocolate and roasted malt flavors are great and the thick mouthfeel works well with the stout."
""
""
"O: A really fine stout. Have been enjoying this six pack for the last few days and will need to try their other beers which have just arrived in town. Well done indeed."
""
""
"yeah a lovely stout here. pours a sensational chocolate brown color with a thick creamy milkshakey mocha head. smells like a cup o joe, but also with some nice roasty dark malts and a bit of cocoa. flavor is similar, plenty of dark malts and a mild espresso flavor. feel is excellent, rich and creamy without being filling on a plenty full body. this is a great stout, and possibly the best beer ive had from mad river, save the scotch porter, which border epic. this is a sessionable one too, good before or after dinner, and different than most. a winner."
""
"O - A pleasant surprise, I don't get many plain stouts that have the depth of flavor this showed, will be a ""go to"" stout for me when I'm not in the mood for a bigger RIS"
""
""
"Overall, I think this is a very good stout and glad I tried it. Has all the makings of a good sessions beer."
"O-really good. this is very well balanced. a bit light feeling but very very good flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Overall a really nice smooth stout nothing really stood out but a good brew none the less."
""
"O - everything an extra stout should be!"
"Definitely different taste than expected, given the aroma. Lots of american hop influence, and a decent stout base."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Ridiculous deal ($4.99 a six-pack). This is actually a very good stout. A great non-Imperial/Double stout. No glaring flaws. A textbook stout with nothing to complain about."
""
""
"Overall: This could easily become one of my favorite stouts under 7% ABV. I will seek this one out again. This is exactly what a stout should taste like. Well done Mad River!! You have a new East Coast fan…"
"Holy cow this is good! This is a very dark appearing ale. It almost looks black! It has a wonderful malty aroma with a touch of hops. The flavor was the most distinctive thing about it. It starts with an almost coffee flavor then moves on to a chocolate aftertaste. It has a good mouthfeel and I can almost picture this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream like a root beer float."
"O: An exceptional and very flavorful stout."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a thin cap. Random dots and streaks of foam form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, malt balls, and cocoa powder. Taste is of dark roasted malt, dark cocoa powder, and some slight coffee flavors. There is a nice roasty bitterness that lingers on the palate. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp yet smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good stout with a very nice balance in the smell and flavor."
""
""
""
""
"A nice stout. Would not go out of my way for one, but could definitely drink another bottle."
""
""
""
"O- this is an awesome stout. I just want to keep on sipping this stuff so the flavor is always in my mouth. I will be having another tonight :)"
"A truly awesome beer. I love stouts and this one really hits the spot."
"O: It wasn't what I was expecting from the style, but it's enjoyable. This is a hard style to stand out in, and this does it by taking me off guard of my original assumption. Though it may not be amongst my top stouts, it has left it's mark. Sure if my options are limited and if it's set at the right price, I would buy again and share with friends."
"Overall an ok stout. Worth a try but I won’t pick it up again."
"I think this is a good solid brew, exemplary of it's type and recommend."
"This beer was creamy and very easy to drink, I was actually expecting this beer to a little heavier than what it actually was. In fact I think I drank it a little too fast and didn't give it a chance to warm up. My only complaint about this beer is that I wish the ABV was a bit higher, I like my stouts to be in the 9%-11& range, but overall I can't complain at all. I really enjoyed this one and I would probably have had another one if it weren't for all of the other beers that were calling my name at Buckeye."
"O-A good, solid American Stout that I enjoyed and would have again."
"Overall this is a must try brew if you haven't already indulged."
"I would have no issue with trying this one again as it went down quite nicely and really left a soft, sweet note in the end. Very well done."
"Not as viscous as I initially thought it would be, but still decent mouthfeel and good carbonation."
"overall - while i dig the flavor i dont dig the body and this beer is a ltttle pricey to boot - would rather have a SN stout or founders porter"
"Poured out an oily black whit a slight amount of head that quickly went away. A bite of bitter bakers chocolate in the nose with a lot of booze as well. The taste is smoother than expected but it still has a sharp bite that has a pungent bourbon alcohol aftertaste. I was not too impressed with this one."
"Pours jet black with a light brown head. In the aroma, big roasted malt and sweet notes are in there too. In the taste, dry coffee and a big roasted maltiness. A small hop bite and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a dry coffee flavor in the aftertaste. Nice coffee note and easy to drink."
"Pours a thick oily black, small brown colored head and little in the way of lace or retention. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and some smoke. In the flavor, black coffee, dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla. Moderately sweet with little to no alcohol presence. Smooth and full bodied. A nice sessionable stout with a moderate ABV. Quite tasty."
"Cheers!"
"A brown head over an opaque black beer. Reasonable carbonation and head retention. Dark malt character in the aroma, good chocolate essence. maybe a hint of yeast to the smell as well. Taste is similar to smells: dark malt flavors, and a bitterness that reminds me of strong coffee. Acidic dark malts are smoothed out by thick body and head. Pretty thick and viscous body, very filling. While still maintaining 6.6% ABV ""decent"". I wouldn't drink more than one or two of these personally. But a good brew with exciting flavors, I enjoyed it."
"Overall I liked this. It's a nice departure from the traditional American stout. A solid pickup."
"D-Definitely not my kind of stout. Very acrid-like roast notes make this one not very palatable to me."
"Pours nearly black, opaque, and thick, with a coffee-colored one-finger head. Smell is mostly roasted malt with coffee notes but not a ton of complexity. Taste is delicious, straightforward, and just what I want from a stout: malty, strong coffee flavors, some sweetness, and nicely rounded. Mouthfeel is medium-thick but bubbly; has a bit of the stout syrupy texture but enough carbonation to balance it. Overall, quite good. The only thing holding it back from an even higher rating is the lack of complexity to the flavor."
"quite drinkable, maybe a touch on the sweet side for great drinkability."
"D - Very good drinkability. Fairly average ABV, so no alcohol noticeable, but very smooth and inviting beer. Slightly sweeter than I would prefer, but still a very good beer that I would not hesitate to get again."
"D - Goes down fairly easy, but it goes down like a 9 or 10% Imperial, which is to say that the flavors and whatnot are very intense. A very tasty stout that looks amazing and lives up to the complexities and appearance of some Imperials I have had. Flavors may be too strong to have more than one at a time."
"All in all one of my favorite stouts and definitely my favorite from the West coast."
"Very drinkable very sessionable. Not a great stout but it will do."
"A good flavorful stout, heavy enough to be leaning towards the desert side of things."
"I've had better. I think the carbonation and lack of body hurt this one for me."
"Taste, hoppy for a stout, bitter, chocolate malt. Not super thick, but not thin either. May have a very slight amount of very weak coffee, or it could be the bitterness making me think that. Smoky at times in a minimized way. Not a bad beer all around, tends to tail off just a tad. A good beer from a good brewery."
"D_Pretty drinkable but lacking a little in the flavor. Dosn't really stand out. No freshness date so I'm not sure how fresh this is. Would definitely give it another go."
"D - Wow they make some great CA beers! This is the third beer this brewery has impressed me with an a couple of places carrying this I may happen on a case. On of the best stouts I ever had!"
"A very nice stout nonetheless. I'm not sure I've had a better non-Imperial American Stout. This is very tasty, with some genuinely pleasant and genuinely robust characters, and the lightness means it goes down very easily. Good drop of beer."
"DB- Not a bad stout at all... the flavor ends up being pretty balanced and well crafted. No complaints here except for the sharp dark fruit aroma."
"Aroma is strong and nose-filling, rich, oily and smoky with a firm overtone of molasses, what I expect from a quality stout. It pours a deep, opaque sable, a whisker above black, with a fairly thick and fine-bubbled light tan head. Perky flavor is smoky and malty with tones of quality roast coffee and molasses, slightly sweet and smoky. Texture is smooth yet fairly fizzy, leaving a subtle tingle."
"D- Solid stout that I could see myself drinking many down the road. Not the best in category but overall very good."
"Mad River nailed this one, a stout-lovers' stout. With the Imperial/Double stouts getting all of the hype, beers like this just don't get enough attention. This one is a must."
"Overall - A very tasty stout that's worth picking up if you see it. Rich flavor and easy drinkability make it a winner if you're seeking a more drinkable beer with a big flavor profile."
"Pours pitch black with a fluffy brown head. Aromas are roasty and sweet, with strong notes of dark and milk chocolate. Tastes is roasty up front and becomes intensely sweet and chocolatey on the mid palate, with burnt sugar and espresso near the end. Body is medium-full and extremely smooth. The finish draws on and on, leaving me with dark chocolate breath. A fine dessert beer or nightcap."
"drinkability - generous flavor, well balanced, tasty stout"
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer, dangerously so. I had two of these coupled with another beer and I am feeling the effects of three straight 6%+ beers. Definitely worth trying a six of."
"Excellent stout, nice aroma, good flavor."
"The smell was a great balance of chocolate and coffee. The taste, even better! I'm a tough grader on stouts and this was a great american stout. A nice smokey taste with just the right amount of sweet chocolately goodness. Very smooth to drink. I would love to have these on a nice fall day."
"Very nice stout. As good as any. Great flavor and aroma. I have a local specialty shop that carries this just for me. Now there are more and more folks picking it up. It is just the right balance of malt and ABV. The appearance is exceptional and the smell draws you in. The flavor is full and satisfying. It is a bit costly but worth it if you like a big stout."
"One super solid stout! Drinkable by many. There's so many average to OK regular American stouts out there and Mad River's Steelhead is an entire step, if not more than a few above, most of them."
"D - multiple bottles are possible."
"Highly recommended."
"D - A beautiful beer. Reminds me why I love beer. Well done."
"In summary, this brew is incredible. I had this one along time ago on a buisness trip to Talahassee. There I was at the ABC and I thought I would do a little mix and match action , so I picked it up. Once I got back to the hotel room, poured it, and took a sip, I knew this was a first class stout. Unfortunatly, I haven't been able to pick one up since, as they seem to be pretty rare in my neck of the woods. Though, as fate would have it, I found one peaking out of the dusty shelves at the local total wines and spirits. Once it caught my eye, it was in the cart."
"The body is nothing short of full, very syrupy (anticipated by how it poured) feel, and mild carbonation. A sipper for sure."
"Notes: A solid beer and very drinkable."
"I like this beer a lot. It is true to type and just smacks you around. Hard to explain but I like this one."
"Not my favorite stout, but very solid. Fairly sweet, so it is great for a beer after dinner or sometime late at night."
"D - My overall impression of the beer is that it's more of a dessert Stout than anything else. I really enjoyed this one without food, but I would of liked it a bit more robust with more malty flavors instead of a dominate chocolate syrup kinda thing. Not worth seeking out to me but worth a try if you like dessert stouts, I think this one needed a bit more though."
"This beer must fly under the radar, as I'm surprised there is not more buzz about this very well-done stout that lands firmly in the American Stout category. Nice mocha head. Aroma of roasted malt with a bit of caramel. No over the top chocolate or coffee flavors - just straight forward big stout. Slightly sweet and with a clean finish. Will see more of my beer fridge."
"D: I like it!"
"D- Because it was light and not over the top in any one of the above taste, I think that i would be able to drink two or three of these in one sitting before I change it up."
"A good, not great stout. Not as well balanced as I would have liked."
"D - Not too strong. Pretty easy to drink, though thick. A solid beer overall. Not my top Stout, but if I had no other choice, I would be happy to drink this."
"Overall, easy to drink, not too much booze to even notice. Great American stout. Wish I tried this sooner. Buy this."
"This is a must try if you like a good stout... Everything with this beer gets better as it warms up.... Run out an get this one !!!!"
"D: Very drinkable considering it's body and complex flavors. This beer grows on me with every sip. Very tasty!"
"D- Fairly drinkable, but the light mouthfeel ruins it for me."
"d- very drinkable, suffers from the light mouthfeel, but still good,"
"Not running back to this one."
"With the medium/light mouthfeel this is a very drinkable stout loaded with tons of flavor. I'm glad it was recommended to me when I was otherwise occupied with Russian Imperial Stouts. American stouts are a whole new category for me and I'm liking them as much as the robust porters I've been trying too. Highly recommended by me now as well!"
"D - A nice, creamy stout. Lots of chocolate flavor with significant spice notes that are reinforced by the herbal hops. Very rich and somewhat sweet for the style, it has a surprising level of complexity. So far I have been surprised by the quality of Mad River's brews and this stout is no exception, highly recommended."
"D- Very sessionable, this is only available in one shop around here that I've found so I'll be stopping by there again!"
"Pours jet black into my Sam Adams specialty glass. For some reason I love stouts out of this glass. A two finger dark tan head sits patiently with a crop of bubbles in the middle. Later than sooner it starts to slowly melt away. A thick, unbroken lacing is left behind. Smell is complex with caramel malts, eathy hops, black licorice, stale coffee and burnt wood which all blend to near perfection. Tastes of more caramel malts with a good addition of hops right behind for more near perfection in the balance department. Goes down smooth and creamy with a slight crispness at the end. A medium to full bodied sleeper brew here. I had no idea. Awesome."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. a solid stout."
"Pours an inky black, some ruby red highlights in the very edges, pretty black, dark tan head forms, pretty thick, slowly settles to a thick ring with a thin layer on the glass, few lace spots stick. Smell is real nice, rich and chocolatey, toffee and malt balls, raisins, very bready, graham crackers and biscuit, light roast, very sweet and malty, dark fruit, chocolate milk, some nuts, real nice. Taste is not as good as the aroma, very malty, chocolate milk, caramel, brown sugar, wafers, very biscuit, toasted oats, dark fruit and some raisin, sweet finish but the flavour feels a little thin. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, would have been a lot better with some proper heft to it. Thanks Russ!"
"Drinkability is to the sky with this brew. I can down a few of these in the winter months, and the alcohol is well hidden. This was my first beer from Mad River, and I look forward to trying there other beers."
"Wonderful, viscous feel. Omits a very warming burn, but at the same time, I can't stop drinking it."
"This beer is full-bodied and viscous but it finishes with only a light sweetness that keeps it amazingly drinkable. A stout that I will be sure to have on hand more often, especially as fall turns into winter."
"Very drinkable, I could drink a couple of these."
"Notes: Besides the wet cardboard and slightly burnt malts, this is a pretty darn good stout. I've been really impressed with the other Steelhead offerings that I have had (Scotch Porter & Double IPA) and this one is no different. I would love to buy a fresh six pack of this, and session the un-oxidized version. It speaks volumes about this beer when even an oxidized bottle gets high marks! Recommended"
"Drinkability: Very flavorful, with a lot to commend itself"
"This is a great stout, huge, robust, hearty, bold and full-flavored. The tendency is toward astringency, and it would take just so little more complexity to put it to an A."
" Worth checking out if you, like me, are a stout person!"
"D - This did not look impressive, but really delivered with great flavor."
"Drinkability: Overall, it's a pleasant, quaffable, fairly solid stout."
"D - at 6.6% this is a very big dry stout. BA calls this an American Stout, which it is, but the flavor, wateriness and dry finish remind me a lot more of an Irish dry stout than a traditional American Stout (my go to example of that is either Shakespeare fro Rogue or Sierra Nevada Stout)"
"Pours an ink black color with a quickly fading, highly carbonated looking, dark tan head. I literally watched the head disappear before my eyes more quickly than any I can remember. A nice aroma of chocolate malts in the nose, coffee hints in the background. Definitely an appetizing smelling stout, in the classic sense, just strong, dark malt. Taste is even better, extremely strong chocolate flavor, but a purely malt based chocolate. The flavor does not end there, as coffee and a slight bitterness add a nice blend to the back-end of the flavor. A nice full mouthfeel, without any alcohol heat makes this a highly drinkable stout. I am surprised that much flavor comes from a standard stout, it is an incredibly well built beer."
"Drinkability: definitely killin' this growler. always one to switch things up so im sure it'll be some time before i grab this one again. Definitely drinkable and a great stout for a non high-gravity."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with good carbonation."
"Also, after I poured the bottle's contents, I noticed that the bottom of the bottle was coated in something, which I am assuming is lactose, but either way it contained what seems to be coffee grinds, pretty nice touch on a nice beer"
"Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into a nonic pint glass. The stout appears a dark brown color with about two fingers of rather dense ecru foam. The head lingers for a bit before settling to a thin layer. Smells and tastes of medium roasted grains, bittersweet chocolate, mild coffee notes, sweet malt, mocha. Bordering on full bodied with adequate carbonation. A great version of the style."
"12 oz. Pours black/brown, with a tan head. Grains/oats roast in the nose. Pretty smooth going down, mocha, coffee, chocolate. Medium bodied. Fairly clean finishing. Could have more hop presence, this may be more like a milk stout. Not bad at all though."
"Much thanks goes out washburnkid for this extra! Pours a dark brown color, nearly black with a small chocolate milk head that had a nice lasting cap. Nice dark chocolate aroma, a bit of smokiness, some metallic notes, and a touch of roasted coffee. Taste follows suit. Dark chocolate and roasted barley make up the bulk of the flavor profile. A nice bitterness rounds things out and balances the light sweetness, a touch of coffee and dark fruit. Nice, thick, and creamy mouthfeel. This was a nice extra stout and I could certainly drink this again if it ever became available to me."
"Picked up a six pack for $9.99. Poured into a standard pint glass. Extremely dark brown. Thick brown head. Decent lacing. Smelled like a cup of hot chocolate. Taste caught me off guard it was so good. Not expecting that from a ten buck six pack. Man, that was great. Really rich and creamy chocolate, mixed with a nice subtle coffee flavor. Perfect balance of flavor and roasted barley. Thick and chewy in the mouth, but easy to drink. Even more flavor erupted as it warmed to room temp. Could sit all night and enjoy one, or have a couple because the flavor was so good and it was so easy to drink. I've had one or two other Mad Rivers brews in the past, but I am going to keep my eyes open for more based on the overall strength of this beer. A great stout."
"Pours a dark black color. 1/4 inch head of a dark tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells strongly of roasted malt, slight alcohol, and some sweet malt as well. Fits the style of an American Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a low carbonation level. A strong dryness is associated with this brew. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, some hop background, slight biscuit flavors, and some alcohol throughout. Overall, a good blend of flavors, strong palate, and a good drinkability."
"D: I'm very impressed by this beer, my first from Mad River. They really get the job done with what is an aggressive yet drinkable stout. I'll be picking this up in the future for sure."
"Not bad, but too ashy/dusty, and the slight sour/tart throws it off a bit, for too much. Despite that there is a smoothness, and enough taste, that it drinks well enough."
"Mouthfeel was a little light for my liking, not standing up to the strong flavors and aromas of the beer. The middle was especially flat with a body lacking the ability to carry the beer around the mouth or compliment its character. The drinkability is also low because of this, but otherwise this is a nice strong example of the style and something I'd pick up again on occasion."
"All in all, not a bad stout. I'd consider drinking it again, and I'd definitely recommend giving it a shot. Nothing amazingly memorable, and the price is just a smidgen high for something unmemorable. But all in all a nice roasty stout."
"One of the darker brown heads you'll find, good two fingers deep and quite dense and reluctant to dissolve, quality lacing as well. As black as the ace of spades, nary a hint of color anywhere, naturally it is fully opaque. The nose is perhaps too dense itself, you have to work at teasing out accents of milk chocolate, mocha powder, carob coated raisins and then apricot, apple fruit scents, coffee oddly absent, for all of its maltiness and lack of hops, there is a saline, metal edge to it before it dissolves in your nostrils. Full-bodied and bottom heavy in spite of its very polished and round mouth feel and suave carbonation. Like it gets to the party and plops down on the first coach it sees. More toast than roast, dark chocolate, carob, licorice, green coffee bean, not very bready, maybe raw grain or meadow grasses. Traces of mixed blacker fruits. Past the midpoint the palate dries out appreciably, you can feel the moisture evacuate. While more or less monochrome flavor-wise, does have depth. And not difficult to drink."
"This is a pretty high bodied beer. Very heavy. Drinkability is average to good. Not a lot of directly appealing flavors, but not a lot of alcohol harshness as well. This probably could have been rearranged a bit into a nice Irish Stout, but instead it turned out weird."
"Drinkability: It's definitely a dessert stout, speaking for itself. Though I'm not sure it's a ""hearty breakfast drink," as the Mad River website claims."
"Drinkability: Good simple stout, but nothing too special. Definitely worth a try at least."
"Really nice stout! Not usually my thing but this is good stuff. Nice carbonation, not too syrupy and a well balanced smokey flavor. Just enough carbonation to keep it very drinkable. Reminds me of Stovepipe on tap but better."
"Very good mouthfeel and an extremely easy drinking beer. Another great beer from mad river."
"D: While I haven't been a huge fan of Mad River's ales (good not great), MR Extra Stout is an exceptional stout with a very full body composed of a hefty dark malt investment which gives a supreme flavor and feel."
"Overall, I was thoroughly impressed by this beer. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Extremely easy drinking, the complexity of all the flavors makes this a must try again."
"D - Could easily make a session out of this, but there are too many other good stouts to enjoy."
"A bit thin for my liking but a quality stout none-the-less."
"(D) A very delicious beer. Easy to drink, especially for coffee and chocolate lovers."
"Overall I'm glad I picked this up. It's a stout without frills, and what's done is done very well. Give this a shot."
"Drinks pretty easy, the dryness would wear on me after a while. A good, not great stout"
"Dark toasted malt in the quaff, powdery and sticky. Even a blend of dark fruits down deep. Crisp and clean finish for a stout. Damn tasty brew from a brewery just now hitting the Midwest area."
"Drinkability- I like my stouts a bit smoother and a bit less roasted, but it was a nice change of pace and a good authentic deep dark stout."
"Pours black with short head that turns into a ring of tan bubbles. Coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and roasted malt in the nose. Same is mirrored in the taste, but with more toffee, molasses, and sweet cream. An excellent subdued stout; hard to find these days in the bigger is better beer world."
"This is a delicious, oily stout but doesn't feature a ton of complexity or overwhelming character. solid and worth trying, but don't castigate yourself if you don't."
"Poured black with maybe just the slightest hint of ruby at the sides of the glass. A loose head of light brown foam settles pretty quickly. I suspect this beer will have a lot of roasted character. Smells like powdered cocoa. The first sip is thick with chocolate flavors followed by coffee with cream. The finish is dry with the carbonation tingling the sides of tongue. Slightly drying. This would be a good breakfast stout to me, as it seems very filling. It's also a stout with a good balance; not too sweet or too hoppy and bitter. I would add that the hop character here is rather muted, with hops added for bitterness and virtually no aroma or flavoring hops detected."
"D: I had never even heard of Mad River Brewing and they make one of the better stouts I have had. What happened to stouts like this...it seems hard to find them with these types of characteristics?"
"Pours black with a nice initial head that fades ta a slight rim. Light roastiness on the nose, as well as some lightly sweet malt and perhaps a touch of dark fruit. The taste is nice, with a balanced creaminess, roastiness, and hints of chocolate and licorice. Smooth and firm mouthfeel with a soft finish.Drinkable but I could only drink 2 at a sitting I think. A very good brew"
"Drinkability is excellent. Good for a few pints in a long session. Would love to try this on tap."
"D: Ok. If this wasn't 6.6%, I think I could go with several of these for dinner. Very akin to Duckrabbit's Milk Stout with more of a punch. I very much enjoyed this one and will seek out this delicious treat again."
"Drinkability: Most enjoyable Steelhead I've ever had. Not very complex, but very smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. Enjoy!"
"A good roasty stout always hit the spot for me. Good stuff."
"Recommended..."
"HV"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a solid medium body and a good flow of carbonation. This one is quite hearty without being overly heavy. Overall, a darn tasty stout with an abv that is low enough to make it sessionable. I enjoyed this one and would drink it again!"
"D- The ABV makes this a very tasty pick. This is a very flavorful beer. Get some."
"Overall, one of the most impressive beers I've yet had the pleasure of tasting!"
"Enjoyable stout. Especially if you like roastiness over smoother chocolate character in your stout."
"D: This was pretty good. A nice stout without the big alcohol taste. It had nice balance and good aromas."
"Nice beer for Mad River, hit the spot since I had not drank a stout in a long time, pretty complex and different, which is something I was not expecting, would drink again, recommended"
"D: Nice session beer. Great big taste without the big booze hammer."
"In the mouth there is little carbonation, very silky slick and robust. I scored drinkability a little low because of the pungent alcohol warmth. Odd for the ABV. Good beer. I'll get it again for drinking and cooking."
"Poured dark black into the glass, slightly viscus. Two and a half finger brown head that dropped within minutes leaving a seawater lace on the glass. Very nice roasted malt on the nose, light hops barried in there. First sip is slammed with some mild bitter hops and dark malts. Getting some milk in the smell mid way through. Very smooth and light on the tongue, decent body. Bitters slow down mid way and I'm getting more of the milk and roasted malts that I was hoping for. Not a bad extra stout."
" I'm thinking this one would do very well in the cellar."
"Dark and dense almost black, hard to see through. Fine creamy chestnut head that leaves nice lace.Rich chicory and roasted coffee in the nose.Big roasted sweet malty flavors with anise, chocolate and a nice bitter hop to balance the flavors.Thick and viscous on the palate with a nice dry finish that lingers.A very drinkable stout,delicious."
"mouthfeel has a good texture and weight, creamy and easy to drink."
"Black and opaque. Not much head, even off of a strong pour. Bang of coffee, molasses and chocolate right away in the nose, with some anise and vanilla trailing right behind. Man, almost exactly the same taste as smell. Malts add a nice roasted quality that wasn't as up-front in the smell. The coffee taste in this really makes itself known. Residual sugars. A slight hop bitterness, but just enough to lend a touch of balance. VERY smooth; fairly creamy. This makes a very nice breakfast stout."
"D : To me, it was just an average stout, nothing stood out about it. It's one I'd drink again but not one I'd go look for."
"Pours black with a nice initial head that fades to nothing. Light roastiness on the nose, as well as some lightly sweet malt and perhaps a touch of dark fruit. The taste is nice, with a balanced creaminess, roastiness, and hints of chocolate and licorice. Smooth and firm mouthfeel with a soft finish. Solid beer that I would pick up from time to time."
"Tasted on 5/4/08."
"Pours a hair shy of black with a thin tan head that evaporates almost immediately. Smells roasty, somewhat vinous, with a touch of milk chocolate. The taste is all roasty malt, chocolate and toffee. A little bit of raisin in there and some faint dark cherries and licorice. Not fond of the mint twinge on the tail end, as well as the sweet finish, which drags down the drinkability. Bitter toasted barley saves the day. Crazy smooth going down, creamy but not terribly thick. A nice easy drinking stout - if mint chocolate chip were my thing, this would be the bomb diggity, but a couple elements just don't quite jibe with my tongue."
"Appears a completely pitch black hue with a large mocha tan head floating above the darkness, lacing is thin but evenly strung. Aromatics sweet creamy chocolate notes with hints of coffee and ripe fruit tones like berry and raisins a touch of alcohol there but really just a nice complex roasty stout with some other tricks. In the finish I'm getting some herbal and nutty qualites, the herbaceous hops come off almost minty. Flavor is balanced with some of the fruity qualities wrapped in chocolate and just roasty enough to scream extra stout. Definitely whipped cream layered on a cappuccino with dark chocolate shavings with a touch of hazelnut, finishes with some of those hop qualities described earlier especially the mint note. Mouthfeel is full bodied yet creamy textured a nice way to drink under six percent carbonation is mellow and smooth on the palate nothing weighs you down with bitterness or any one sensation. Drinkability, this is pretty much amazing and it has a different edge than your typical hopped up West Coast style stout it brings sweet and roasted malt flavors out to play and causing excessive amounts of flavor with balance, really nice stuff."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, would be a great on a cold day as it is. I also tried a mug full with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream. Wow, that was the perfect dessert at the end of a hot day. If I could get this in the store I'd never make a regular root beer float again!"
"Drinkability: Very good stout. Would definitely seek out again."
"Yes, I could see myself having a few of these. Not an ideal warm weather brew, but if you are looking to warm up or stay warm by the fire, this is a winner."
"M + D: Smooth and creamy... an incredibly mellow and easy beer. Not a huge body, but it doesn't fall into thin territory, either. Quite nicely done, and something I look forward to having around more often."
"D - This is an excellent American or even a foreign extra-style stout. Truly a wonderful stout - wish I could get it around here. I would imagine this would sit well on a winter day also."
"The flavors can become overpowering if you go at it too fast, and I'm not sure if the bitterness of the roasted malt in this brew would accompany too many foods well, but it is enjoyable if you know what to expect from it."
"The taste is a bitter departure from the sweetness of the aroma, instead delivering notes of bitter, roasted coffee grounds and earthy hops. The finish falls a bit flat, leaving me wanting something more to the aftertaste. The body is nicely carbonated, with a medium thickness and slightly grainy, chalky feel. All in all, Steelhead's Extra Stout isn't exceptional, but drinkable."
"D 3.5"
"Quiet drinkable but I'm disappointed in the flavor. SHould be bolder based on the nose. Still not a bad pick up. I would like this over many stouts!"
"Rather full on the body, rich, chewy. Swirl it around for a few moments and the chewyness is just amazing. Long roasty finish and very drinkable for such a flavorful stout."
"D: Good for a stout, I could drink this all day."
"This is a very nice stout. Really nice smell with a very balanced taste between roasted and sweet malts."
"Overall, this was a highly drinkable American Stout due to the well balanced flavors and low bitterness level. I think I've just found my ""Go To"" stout."
"This is my first beer from Mad River. Now I'm pretty interested to see what else they have to offer."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. A syrupy black color with a chocolate tan head. Sweet malty vanilla aroma with hints of coffee in the background. The taste is of smooth sweet malts, followed up by a ever so faint coffee bitterness. A bit of chocolate helps add to the sweet smoothness. Hella good stout! Not too bad to sip on as an after dinner beer."
"I find this brew to be very interesting with many different flavor profiles to note. This is the sort of Stout that if I'm giving it a lot of analysis, I will probably have several. If I am simply drinking it, I'll probably have several more."
"This beer is one excellent stout that I could drink all night long."
"Pretty drinkable stout."
"Pours opaque almost black, like espresso, with a creamy head again resembling a thick crema on a nice espresso. Lots of lacing. Aroma is pleasant and roasted. A nice toasty flavor with a dry finish, and a nice, substantial creamy mouthfeel. Very nice. I'll have another."
"MF&D - Full Bodied stout. Thick and chewy, definitly coated the mouth big time. Pretty good overall, give it a shot if you see it."
"Poured thick jet black with a two finger espresso brown fizzy head which diminishes quickly. Cocoa powder and chocolate malt dominates upfront with a hint of fudge shop. In the middle I get a hint of licorice or vanilla, rounding off with a strong dried raisin or dates. This beer is a great example of what you smell is what you taste, a nice coffee bitter ended the drink. The body is full yet smooth and clean with a lively carbonated end. Overall, this brew rocks and with its intimidating look one would be surprise to find out its low abv content at 5.5% making a dangerously drinkable brew. Enjoy."
"MF&D- Fairly thick stout that coats the mouth well leaving behind a nice layer of sticky sweetness. This is a great stout that I highly recommend. Wish I had a few more. Might have to order a 12 pack of this stuff from the beer of the month club."
"Cocoa colored head with a loud fizzying sound on top of motor oil black. Lots of cocoa in the aroma, touched up with a bit of molasses. Despite it's intiminating look, the flavor won't wallop your palate. I know this is starting to sound redundant, but pleasant cocoa is in the taste, but tastes best as you gulp down the beer. Fruitiness is weaved in nicely. Just a delight to drink."
"Poured thick, black, and oily. A delayed head bubbled up, which was thin and a dark tan that faded away quickly. The smell was crisp and pleasant: coffee and chocolate malts and maybe even a slight smell of alcohol. It was crisp and made me excited to give it a taste. And the result was great! There was certainly plenty of roasted malts, with burnt coffee tones. It was thick, creamy, and smokey. It finished with both a slightly bitter and slightly sweet flavor, the sweet potentially coming from brown sugar and molassass. Delicious! I could sip on this all day, the taste only got better with each sip."
"The aroma was nice of roasted malts, coffee, hints of chocolate and toffee. Taste wise it was damn smooth and was a good cup of joe. It was nice and chewy and I could taste some raisins and had a dry finish. Excellent stout Steelhead."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Fairly dry, flavors of dark chocolate and coffee, a touch of molasses and smoke. Rich and creamy with a full body. Drinkability is outstanding thanks to the overall dryness and balance of flavor."
"Pours a complete black with a two finger dark tan head that dies down to a frothy layer of thin bubbles. Stickiness is a weak with just about nothing on the sides of the glass. Let this warm up for sure before drinking, smell improves immensely. Cocoa powdwer and fresh hazelnut coffee with an oaky wood aroma. The faintest hint of hops underneath all the dark malts. Sweet caramel all the way through with a smokey wood flavor. A quick citrus hop zing midway through. Very creamy feel with a smooth molasses aftertaste. I love the drinkability of this brew as it warms. I could easily drink this beer year round. Definitely the best beer I've had from these guys. I need beers like this in my fridge at all times. This is probably the best American Stout I've had."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a PP pint glass. Pours a pitch black color with a thick mocha color head that leaves good lacing. Smell is light coffee with a predominate roasted malt profile. Taste is more on the coffee side than smell with hints of chocolate coming through. Mouthfeel is fullbody with a creamy mouthfeel vs being chewy or sticky. This is a highly drinkable stout in all way ( not overpowering abv at 6%, good price for quality 6pack, and readily available in Cali)."
"d - a solid session stout."
"This is a very stereotypical, yet very enjoyable beer. Pours a dark, opaque black. What little head is gone by the time you turn around. a good, dry taste. Chocolate comes to the forefront. Not much of an alcohol presence, but at 6% I wasn't expecting much. Very drinkable stout."
"A nice, flavorful stout, one that is fairly rich without being overbearing about it. I enjoyed having one after work, but despite having a moderate abv, I don't think I'd want to session it. As a stand-alone stout, however, it's very tasty."
"D: At first, I thought this would be a dud as the massive head made it difficult to drink. It magically disappeared and this turned into one easy drinking stout that i'd reach back for if i had more of"
"D: I do believe this is my highest rated beer yet. I would drink this guy till I got sick."
"Overall a very good stout. All the flavor and complexity of a high ABV export stout."
"d:there are so many better stouts that are readily available i am not sure it makes sense to get this one but worth a try"
"Pours a hair below pitch black. Nice darker tan head. Nose is of heavily roasted malts. Flavor is smoked and roasted malts. Very robust and deep and uncompromising. Even though it is nice and hearty, it seems a bit one dimensional. Kind of like it is all muscle and no grace. Feel has a good carbonation to it and the liquid is fairly thick. Overall this is a pretty rich and deep stout. No mass of complexity, but definitely deep enough that you might want to put your floaties on before diving in."
"Steelhead Extra Stout pours an opaque black with a one inch thick head the color of chocolate milk. The aroma is quite roasty. The body is thinner than I like for a stout. There is a good amount of roast in the flavor, but there is a vinous component that tends to overwhelm the roast in the middle. The aftertaste is all roasted malt. Not bad."
"Good drinkabilty. Great besides to homebrew twang."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, which is disappointing considering the great appearance. Not the most drinkable of stouts, but a pleasant surprise."
"Very easy to drink due to the low ABV and carbonation. I had this with some Tuscan bread and Emmantal and Applewood cheese. Very nice combination."
"Drinkability - easy to drink, a fine, fine stout."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little dark tan head, some sticky lacing around the edge. The nose is malty, sweet, lots and lots of toffee, chocolate, coffee, and caramel. The taste is malty, sweet, and lots of toffee, chocolate, coffee, and caramel. The finish is slightly dry and bitter. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an very nice stout, way to go Mad River."
"12 oz. bottle- color of dark raost coffee , with a medium tan head - nose of bittersweet chocolate , sour red fruit , cocoa , and coffee  taste of coffee , burnt , bitter chocolate , vanilla , and milk chocolate - body is a medium smooth cream , dry , and with light carbonation  aftertaste of vanilla , coffee , chocolate , and lingering"
"I expected this to be a good stout and was not letdown. A very straightforward example that I would definitely try again..."
"Surprised to see other BA's really love this brew or think it's closer to average -- no normal, every-day good review. But, this is where I land with this beer. Very clean and pure tasting and feeling, but no dominant characters that grab me either. The beer opens with a convencing opaque, dark brown hue and 1/2"" head retention that reduced to a simmer before holding firm. Timid aromas of roasted grains, sweetness, lactose, and toast. Aromas rely on confectionate-type matiness that hold character, but is not descernable. Taste rise the roasted / cocoa a bit, but the soft malty flavors and texture prevail, yet remaining non-descript. The body holds a creamy texture with a slight linger with malt, cocoa, and toast. The hops are also timid, especially in the aromas and flavors. The bittering is fair, but I expect more for the style. Though light in character, the brew is quite clean and controlled. Nice session-type brew with some flavor."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a tan head that leaves a good amount of lacing and has pretty good retention as well. The aroma is dark roasted malt and a nice dose of chocolate. The aroma reminds me of a chocolate stout. The taster is dark and roasty with a nice bitter finish. Overall, this is one of the best stouts that I have ever had. Highly Recommended."
"There's a moderate amount of carbonation but retains its smooth creamy texture. A high quality stout."
"D: Fairly complex for a lighter stout. Great balance and highly drinkable. Recommended."
"Good in comparison to many stouts, but definitely not one of my favorites. This reminds me of a Guinness extra stout but slightly sweeter and a little less carbonated. Appearance is nice, very dark with good head retention. Smell is OK, but very little stands out other than the dark roasted malt scent. Taste for me is a bit watered down, but I typically like imperial stouts. Not bad at all/ but this one is most likely the last one I will have."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling for the style, good kick to it, very good representation of style. This is a good stout to drink continuously and I haven’t had very many of those yet that won't fill you up."
"D: Definitely an easy to drink stout."
"Black with a small, creamy brown head. Deep, thick malty aroma of dark, oily, bittersweet chocolate. Smells like a bigger stout than advertised. Flavors of chocolate and roasted coffee, a tad sweet with a mild hoppy finish. Very satisfying to take a big sips. Surprisingly imperial stout-like for its moderate strength. The body is just about right for the style, but with the bigness in its other aspects, it seems a little weak in comparison. Good stuff."
"Pours a deep rich black from which almost no light escapes, topped by a luscious, creamy dark brown head. Aroma of sweet, roasted malt and a touch of lactose. Palate is dominated by sweet, dark roasted malt, a touch of chocolate malt, and more lactose sweetness. Notes of caramel and molasses come through mid-palate before the sweet, fairly dry finish. Body is rich and creamy, although the carbonation is just a bit in excess of what it should be. A highly drinkable stout."
"A black pour from a 12 oz bottle. A fairly thin tan head that had little retention. A semi-sweet chocolate aroma with a bit of roastiness in the background. A crisp mouthfeel, slightly creamy. Roasted malt is the main character with some notes of chocolate supporting. An aftertaste that sticks to the tongue for awhile. A nice drinkable stout."
"Bottle. Poured very black with a nice brown head that left big chucks of lacing. Feels thick and rich on the tongue. Very nice odors with a smoky chocolate dominating. Very smooth drink. Flavor are excellent but what makes this stand out is one of the best palates evey. Feels almost rich enough to eat with a spoon. Mad River does not get a lot of distribution, but when they do it well they are top notch. Very nicely done."
"Refreshing and satisfying."
"Yet another well done and drinkable offering from Mad River."
"Like some other good stouts, this one can get real nasty if it is too cold, but properly warmed up, it has a very nice complex taste. Very drinkable and worth picking up again, I just have to make sure not to put it in the big fridge with the food (keep it basement cold or maybe a little colder)."
"This was a very impressive looking stout in the pint glass with a thick creamy deep tan colored head. The nose was sweeter than expected with molasses and carmel being the dominant aromas. The taste was also just a tad sweet for my taste, but very good. It was a little syrupy but had a strong robust mouthfeel that coated nicely. Drinkability was not great due to the sweetness. I usually prefer a little more bitterness in extra stouts(e.g. Cooper's), but this was a fairly enjoyable beer nonetheless."
"D- the nose on this brew is fantastic, but its too soda like with all that carbonation, distractsa from the flavor. I wont go out of my way for this but i'd still like to give this brew another go because of the impressive aromas."
"Poured a very deep brown color woth moderate tannish head. Smell is chocolate, cocoa, coffee, and some dark fruit. Taste is of strong black coffee, dark bitter chocolate, and ripe plums. Very enticing. Finish leaves just enough bitternees to perfectly balance this beer. Excellent example of the style. Thouroughly enjoyable."
"The pour yields a rich black body and a densely topped tan head. Subtle, stale maltiness elevating aromatics of peanut butter, roast and a slight hint of chocolate, but overall it mostly resembles rich mocha in the nose. Flavor is of course malt accented, but it leans toward a mild astringency in the finish, and this is a very fresh bottle. I dont like the finishing hop either. As it begins to warm though, a rich and creamy roasted chocolate malt character does indeed start to shine through. Overall, an above average stout, although I do prefer the Brewers Scotch Porter, which I think is an excellent beer."
"Very pleasing and easy to drink beer. Not a thing is harsh about this beer. Not every beer in the world needs to be a RIS same as not every dog in the world need to be a pedigree. This is you local friendly beer that wants you to throw a Frisbee for it to chase everyday."
"12 ounce bottle. Mad River Stout pours out a thick black color with a small, dark brown head. The aroma is big and malty, with lots of chocolate and molasses. Bittersweet coffee flavor with loads of chocolate. There is some raisin flavor, though this beer is more burnt and roasty than fruity. Hops are there, though not nearly strong as the malt. There is enough bitterness to balance. The mouthfeel is thickish, though it in no way impedes the drinkability. This is truly a fantastic stout. I was especially pleased with this beer because it is rare to find a beer this good that I have not heard of before."
"Full bodied, bracing, thick, lingering, dry finish. Quite a decent stout, ...if it fails me in other ways."
"Not bad, but the smell, like a good movie than ends bad, hinted of things it didnt deliver."
"Drinkability/Notes  Id like more hop balance. A good stout but there are better. Worth a try. (No freshness dating)"
"A very good example of the style with a bit harsh aftertaste, but otherwise a very enjoyable beer."
"Complexsity of malts, hops, alcohol and yeast was well balanced. The flavor of this stout was complex as the aroma. One, compliments the other!"
"Smooth, but with enough surprising twists to kep it interesting enough for me to want to drink a couple more."
"This is a fine stout but nothing to go crazy over."
"I'll just say there are many options with this style and this one is eh..ok for the price per oz / score. buy one bottle first if your on a budget."
"Steelhead Extra Stout is a straighforward beer, but I mean that in the best way possible. There's nothing surprising or original here, there's just loads of bold, lip-smacking black malt flavor. Again, I'm surprised that American stouts of this quality are as rare as they are. That means I'll have to give credit where credit is due: Mad River has brewed a classic of the style."
"This is a prototypical stout. It pours very dark with a big creamy beige head. While it is thick and chewy with more carbonation then average, it's also quite smooth. This one features some tasty roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee flavors with a hint of fruit and since this is a West Coast stout the brewers gave it a welcomed spicy, hoppy kick. This went rather well with my bowl of Waffle Crisp cereal."
"Mad River's Steelhead Extra Stout pours a magnificently dark body beneath a full head of densely creamy dark tan foam. The head retention and lacing a bit limited however. The nose is somewhat restrained as well, but what is there is all about mocha java!, with just a hint of fruitiness peeking through. It's medium-light bodied with a very fine-bubbled, zesty carbonation (it appears bottle-conditioned, unless whatevers in the bottom of the bottle isn't yeast). Through the front and middle, the flavor delivers a note of vinous fruit that's wrapped in luxurious caramel/toffee, and then dipped in sweet milk chocolate. The coffee flavor comes on strong, however, towards the swallow and into the long lingering roasty finish. Superbly done!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a sturdy beer mug. The head is densely bubbled, chocolate milk in color. Body is black as night. Smell: Delicious waft of espresso and chocolate, leaning more heavily on the chocolate, very sweet with a pleasant sizzle of toasty malts and thin hop presence. Taste: luscious rush of roasted malts upfront, burned crescent roll (but in a good way), chocolate, chocolate pudding, coffee grinds. The middle is a more pronounced bitterness as the sweetness slides underneath to sneak up on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel: perfectly rich, middling carbonation."
"This beer pours, from a twist top bottle, a very dark brown. The head is brown. It fades somewhat fast leaving minimal laces. It has a strong coffee aroma. It also had a roasted malt aroma whit slight hints of chocolate. Also, there is a very subtle caramel scent. It tastes of coffee, and chocolate. It has a slight hop finish that balances it out nicely. This beer is carbonated will. It leaves a coffee aftertaste on the palate. It is a good beer. It might be the best beer I have ever drank from a twist top bottle. This beer would probably make a decent session beer. The alcohol content is low, and the flavor is not overly aggressive. I dont know if I could drink 12 of them in one night, but I would definately have a few."
"12 oz bottle, courtesy of mtnlover, pours as dark as any stout I've seen, producing an opaque ebony body. Head is small and shortlived, but an attractive light brown color, falling into a persistent collar with moderate patch and sheet lacing. Aroma is more bittersweet chocolate than coffee, but this is an ideal blend of both that produces a solid stout aroma. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium full bodied. Appropriate medium carbonation. Taste features a full onslaught of roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, and essence of walnuts. Plenty of dark roasty malt bitterness with some grassy and citrusy hops for a nice balance. Very nicely done and pleasantly drinkable. I've never had a subpar offering from this brewery and Steelhead is a fine example of an American stout."
"Drinkability is good a tastey little stout. Would reccomend to anyone looking for a good example of a American Stout."
"A bitterness that overwhelms the stoutability (new Webster entry). It looks like a stout, but it starts with a sourness in the aroma. There is roastness, even a tad burnt, some chocolate, but oh the sourness. Stiff upper lip to finish this one. It was a bit better at room temperature, and I am a lenient rater on stouts, it even refreshed, but the..sourness."
"Pouring this brew, I notice lots of yeast at the bottom of the bottle that is splashing its way into the head of my beer. It pours a very dark brown w/ 2 inches of spongy tan head that clings and clings as it dissipates. As I poured I could smell many things going on already. Lots of vanilla and caramel along with some slightly smokey roasted malts and maybe some coffee characteristics. It actually looks like a french vanilla latte! Brown roasted malts accompanied by caramels is the main flavor here. Some smoke makes it way through giving this a dryer feel especially on the finish. No alcohol really to report, but lots of coffee aftertaste. Nice taste overall. Nothing too elaborate on the mouthfeel: well balanced carbonation throught, dry on the finish a bit (oak flavor almost) and nice sweetness balancing the roasted flavors. Full-bodied and filling, but no warming on my belly at all, and actually easier to drink for the style. Fishy LIKEY!"
"Small (1/4""), brown, dense head over a black, black opaque beer. Brown highlights. Sweet chocolate aroma with some coffee. Same thing in the front. Light coffee middle, bitter chocolate, vegetal finish. Not bad. Not as good as the Scotch Porter for me. Just a kind of plain, dry stout."
"Pours an utterly opaque super-dark burgundy under a one finger purplish gray head that is thick and creamy, but still dissipates quickly leaving no trace of lace. The nose has some roasted malt, but what sticks out is a distinct plum note. The mouth is fairly heavy and very carbonated, with a body that hugs anything it touches. This beer almost tastes like a sweet stout, with prominent plum and sour citrus notes. There is roastiness here, and a touch of espresso, but the fruitiness pervades. Only in the aftertaste, long after the prune juice is gone, do the roasted malts and dry hops assert themselves. It's OK, but a bit disappointing in my book."
"Another JahNoth hookup."
"-Oelergud"
"The aroma is a licorice, coffee blend, with hints of cherries and red grapes. The taste is much the same, chocolate tasting and lightly bitter. The maltiness is heavy and the tastes a little like wine in the aftertaste. This is a fabulous stout, one that makes me think that stout is my favorite beer style. Highly recommend."
" Exceptional balance and outstanding Stout character. A truely great example of a Foriegn / Export/ Extra Stout."
"Appearance is black as night but it poured a dissapointing head leaving no lacing. Smell is good, toasted grains, coffee, and chocolate. Taste is getting better the warmer this brew gets. Roasted malts, hints of coffee and chocolate, and a nice dry finish. It is a bit thin for a stout. Overall drinkability is good. I have another bottle that I will be sure to let warm up from fridge temps!"
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich black and chocolate malt scent along with dry, yet creamy finish. The taste is decent. It has an extremely rich black and chocolate malt flavor that is very thick and dry. It goes down slow and finishes with a bitter black malt aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent drinking stout. It has a little lacking in the mouthfeel department as well as a little too intense in the grain bill."
"Very dark pour with small caramel head. Scent of bitter chocolate and mild roastiness. Very nice nose. Nice roasted bitterness in the flavor - the hops, chocolate and slight coffee bounce around in unison. Light on the tongue. A delicious brew! Mad River brews are slowly moving up the ladder among my favorites."
"This stout goes down easy and really is a great find."
"Cant pour any darker than this pitch black stout with a thin mocha colored head,aromas of deeply roasted malt and mocha flavored coffee very rich and appetizing on the nose.Taste is very roasted with a unsweetened chocolate note finishing very earthy and nutty.Very raw and bold beer like the earthiness in the finish and the creamy mouthfeel a big winner here."
"Pours an oily black with a big brown head that's gone rather quickly. Not much for lacing. Smells of roasted grain and coffee with a slight hoppy smell as well. Taste is of a bitter coffee and slight chocolate with a nice roasted malty taste as well. Lingers pretty well in the mouth, but nothing too spectacular here. Pretty well carbonated with a light mouthfeel for a stout. I don't know here. A decent offering, but again nothing too terrific. I was impressed with the scotch porter, but this was just OK."
"A touch plain, but a good solid beer."
"Nice full body, very smooth and clean tastes all around. I could easily make a night of this superb stout. The price is just right for this, so it's even easier to dive in."
"This is a fine extra stout. It pours out a dark, opaque black colour with a nice frothy espresso coloured head. The aromas are nice. Chocolate, espresso, caramel, hops, deep roasted malts, and a bit of spicy booze. The taste follows suit with a wonderful melange of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is neither thick, nor thin, and it is all too easy to drink one of these puppies down. Nice stuff."
"The full, heavy, and thick body is just shy of being syrupy, earning it high marks in this lesser dimension. The drinkability is likewise enhanced by the moderate ABV and lovely feel. Grande! Let this Steelhead come upstream and multiply!"
"The beer pours pitch black with a slight ruby highlight when held to light. The brown head forms quickly and then falls slowly lacing the glass. The aroma is chocolate and coffee and roasted malt. The flavor is chocolate and coffee and roasted malt. The body is medium-full and appropriate. The finish is dry coffee."
"Comments  This is one stouty stout. This is what I think of when I think of stout. This is a tremendous example of the style. Much thanks to the Santa Monican MickeyMac for sending me this offering from Mad River."
"I really like this stout! Top notch and highly recommended. Pick some up if you run accross it."
"The beer pours a raven color, not a hint of light passes through this stout, the head pythonic in size, the texture spumescent, and the color a rich chocolate brown, as it disperses, a thick and claggy lace welds itself to the glass. The deep rich aromas of the toasted grain reaches you first, followed by the sweet malt, with hints of bittersweet chocolate and yes even some deep rich roasted fresh ground coffee, delectable the nose. Start is ambrosial, thickly malt, the top full and chocolate rich with the finish pleasantly acidic, the hops spiteful in their spicy presence, very dry and slightly bitter aftertaste, clings to your palate like a newborn baby to its mothers bosom, quite quaffable this beer from a fine brewery."
"Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malts, some fruitiness and coffee. A medium bodied stout. Malts are chocolate and coffee, with a touch of fruit sweetness. Hops are slightly bitter and dry. Smoky and peaty as well. Very drinkable stout. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with a twist-off cap, this pours inky black. It appears highly carbonated on pouring, but the head never really comes to life and it just sort of sits there. Espresso, chocolate, and just a touch of raisin combine nicely in the smell and taste. It has enough hops to lend a nice twang. The mouthfeel is fairly chewy. Despite the nice complexities, it runs its course after one or two."
"So much flavour, and so damn drinkable. Oh yeah ... this is a damn tasty stout."
"Muchas gracias to Bighuge for this trophy"
"Pours opaque black with a thick, fine brown head that soon melts to a thin lace. Aroma dominated by espresso, with dusty roasted malt. I liked the lack of alcohol in the aroma. Nose is dry roasted malt and coffee, with a little dark chocolate, that thins to a surprisingly light mouthfeel for a stout that looks so thick. Hops are present as a muted, minerally astringent bitterness towards the finish, which is snappy. Nice coffee aftertaste. I wouldn't call this a deep or complex stout, but it has a great smell and aftertaste. Its lighter, drier and more drinkable than you'd expect. Worth trying but not seeking out."
"This beer poured into the glass a jet black color, no light penetration. The head was a medium brown color, but left fairly fast. There was no head retention and no lace visible. The aroma was of dark fruits and berries, malt, coffee and chocolate. The taste was creamy and semi thick. Hints of chocolate dominated, as well as coffee and chocolate and some alcohol peeked through. The flavors were fine while in the mouth and good while they caressed the tongue, but once swallowed the flavor left fast. Shame on this I was enjoying this beer up until this moment. Would like to have more lasting flavors after the last sip."
"Jet black color, huge thick tan head, roasty coffee aroma, roasty chocolate-smokey flavors, nice full and creamy mouthfeel, has a nice hop bite in the finish, a nice tasty easy drinking stout, I think I will have another."
"Dollars-to-flavor, you can't find many Stouts better than this. This was similar to Cooper's and Zonker Stout, which is definitely a good thing. Pours a near-black color with a thin dark beige head. Rather sweet with some chocolate and coffee in the flavor and aroma. A pleasant experience overall, my only complaint is that it could have been a little more rounded."
"TIP : Next time you want to watch a Solar Eclipse - Pour Two pints of MRBC Extra Stout - strap them to the front of your head over your eyes - watch the Eclipse, then drink the beer. ""Real Beauty"" as the Crocodile Hunter would say."
"Ah, when this beer pours it brings back memories.  This beer is so dark, my old roommate who was a strick macro lager drinker(but drank coffee blacker than sin non stop, go figure)would have asked what swampwater I was drinking.  Formed a dark head that subsided quickly but left some lace.  Wonderful stong aroma of malt and coffee.  The taste was strong but not overpowering of coffee and slight hint of chocolate.  A lighter body then some other stouts.  A definate keeper if your into stouts and worth checking out."
"This beer is black.  Seems pretty thick as it glugs out of the bottle.  Nice brown head that is gone in seconds, however, this beer does lace the glass nicely throughout the drink.  Coffee and bitersweet chocolate on the nose.  Taste contains a very pleasant roasted character.  Very low on the burnt tones.  And there is a slight sweet taste here that I'm not familiar with in stouts. Nice bitterness in this stout. The beer is very creamy and easy drinking.  Very Solid Stout in my book."
"This is a dandy...My first experience with Mad River Brewing.  I love this stout.  It pours black with a slight amber hint to it.  A creamy, lucious tan-reddish head caps this ""liquid"" of delight.  The aroma is outstanding...strong chocolate, and breadiness...It is a beer of high character.  It feels the way a stout should feel, and tastes the way I expect a stout to taste...creamy and easy drinking, this stout features a strong chocolate malt base, with just enough hopping to keep it from being too sweet.  It is an excellent stout, in the same ballpark with all my favorite stouts from Kalamazoo, Mackesons, and Watneys."
"This is a great stout.  They really couldn't do much to improve on it.  It poured a deep black, not a trace of light coming through.  I would have liked a better head on it.  The smell coming off of it is licorice and strong roasted malts.  Great taste.  Faint licorice with roasted malts and a nice chocolate taste in the background.  Very clean across the palate, in fact surprisingly so for a stout.  I would have liked a little creamier feel to it, although this probably comes through with a proped nitro tap.  Extremely drinkable.  Probably the first beer that I had ever almost finished before I even thought to start my review.  This is just one great stout.  I love them and this is a beauty."
