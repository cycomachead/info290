The coffee and hops compete with each other too much and destroy each other to create another hoppy stout mostly indistinguishable from the  others. It looks nice at least. I really like hops, but there are other beers better suited to showcase hop flavors than this.","Ranbot","0"

I sat back in awe and watched it settle into two fingers of very dense, deep-tan/light-brown head with good retention. Color was an Opaque Black (SRM = 44) and it looked like the depths of outer space in my glass. Nose was both dark-roasted coffee and fresh mint, possibly spearmint or perhaps peppermint. Very nice! Mouthfeel was slightly full, just a step above medium. The taste was what I want from this Cascadian/Dark/Black IPA style - mint, chocolate and coffee! I was actually getting the hops, which is not usually the case. I was really reminded of a York Peppermint Patty, especially since I was getting the sensation. Finish was semi-dry and very pleasant. I could drink a few of these before reaching for a regular AIPA.","woodychandler","Aug 09, 2014"

Aroma if lemony hops, chocolatey roast that somehow seem to work nicely together. The flavor follows with an initial burst of bitter lemon hop flavor, then fades into big roasty chocolate, and then leaves a strangely lemon chocolate combo on the palate, but more lemon than chocolate. Velvety and smooth mouthfeel, medium carbonation. This is very unique and the only other stout I have had with this level of hops is Darkness, but the flavor profile is totally different. Glad to try it, it is tasty, but I don't know that I would want this on a regular basis. Kind of like someone poured lemon pinesol in my FIS.","BMMillsy","Dec 07, 2013"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, dark chocolate, herbal hop, and slight rubber aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, coffee, and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, grapefruit, orange zest, pine, floral, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Awesome aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted malt, coffee, and hop notes; with big strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, grapefruit, orange zest, pine, floral, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of roasted/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, citrus, pine, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome balance and complexity of roasted malt, coffee, and hop flavors; with a great hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic hoppy coffee stout. All around great balance and complexity of roasted malt, coffee, and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering","superspak","Sep 01, 2013"

Aroma has dark chocolate bitterness and hint of pine and citrus tone hops in the background with a somewhat creamed coffee in the middle. Bitterness unwavering bitterness green hops assault the palate with a pelletized hop concentration black malts (mainly black patent bring out the charcoal and roasted malt bitterness) so there's a bit of a tag team combo hitting me hard right now. I really couldn't tell you they used oatmeal, but dark bitter coffee, dark malts, and hops are screaming hello!!! Mouthfeel never gets past any one of the waves of bitterness it coats all dimensions of the palate, medium bodied even solid carbonation no issues there just the lacquer known has beer hop breakfast is left behind coating the entire palate with a lingering unbalanced bitterness. Overall I wish the gypsy brewer had a stroke of finesse in his paint brush, maybe due to the country where the brewing scene is breaking out like a punk rock movement do most of these guys feel the need to brew this way.

The citrus hops didn't get much of a chance to stand out from the richly mocha barley, but they did blend in wonderfully for a long, lingering pine and cocoa finish.

4.05,0,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a true pint, the beer is an extremely dark auburn-brown to almost black coloring with a tall, frothy, dense, chocolate milk colored head that quickly recedes into a thin, filmy coating. Aromas are roasty, with a heavy mocha and slight hoppy balance. Smells heavy and delicious. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a dark coffee backbone that almost has a charcoal character to it. Resiny hops highlights throughout, with an unbalance that strangely works with the style. The body is slightly thinner than I was expecting for the style, and even after I poured it, but it works. The aftertaste has a slight smoke and roast, but surprisingly more hoppy than anything. Wet, resiny, bitter hops at the end of the palate make it feel like you just drank a heavy DIPA. The finish is rich, slick, and with a slight roasty linger. Good, solid brew.","GarthDanielson","May 30, 2012"

The liquid is fully black, however, you see some tiny bubbles rising inside and the outer rims and surface take on a yellow hue, looks sturdy. The nose offers palpable coffee roast along with powdered chocolate and cocoa, big burst of pink grapefruit and pine betrays the hops presence, in some ways the green herbal nature becomes dominant, minor notes of plum or cherry fruit, doesn’t come across as sweet as expected. Medium-bodied, what’s there feels heavy on the tongue, here the roast more pronounced and bitter, coffee grounds, dark chocolate, mocha, tar, tobacco resin with toasted bread more than softer yeast accents. The pine, grapefruit and leaf to grass hops bust right up the middle, minimal sweetness found on the tongue too. The carbonation is subtly refreshing more than a definite presence.

Roasted malt plays a part as well. Tasting this, Beer Hop Breakfast delivers, hops and coffee. Some flaked oats (oatmeal) with roasted malt and a somewhat astringent bitter taste towards the end. Like most Mikkeller beers, Im not a big fan of this one. Feel is a nice healthy medium and probably bigger than that. Fair carb with a piney, lasting aftertaste that kills things (at least for me).

4.08,0.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours near black with a long-lasting deep tan head. Strong lacing and a heavy roast and chocolate character in the nose. Good dosing of pine and faint earth. Heavy pine, especially as it warms. Good balance between the pine and roast in the flavor. Medium body with a dry, resinous finish. Fairly bitter, mostly from the hops. Really quite tasty.","Thorpe429","Sep 09, 2011"

Surprisingly good aroma, exceeding my expectations. Terrific blend of hops and dark roast. This taste much more like an American black ale (black IPA) than a stout. Really well balanced and full of flavor. A wonderful marriage of roast and hops. I highly recommend this beer.","Huhzubendah","Aug 25, 2011"

3.91,-3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This is one of the more interesting stouts I've had. It has all of the better qualities of a stout with the exception of the overly bitter aftertaste, and adds to that a hoppy undertone. It may have an effect on the hops, but aging this might improve it some.","theghost3","Aug 01, 2011"
4.38,8.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I like the interplay of hops and stout in the flavor, loads of roasted dark malts in the front and a decidedly citrusy hops flavor in the rear. No negative bitterness, and not really sweet either (making this much tastier than Darkness or Nightstalker). The carbonation is on the low side, which I like just fine. Very nice, a great addition to the line-up.","TurdFurgison","Jul 30, 2011"

A hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mothfeel, with a dryer small hop and small roast in the aftertaste. Big hops and small oatmeal and roast notes. It doesn't feel like a stout, but it is tasty!","OWSLEY069","Jul 21, 2011"

3.68,-9.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a medium bodied brew with a creamy smooth texture yet oily and clingy as well. It boasts a modest amount of carbonation. It is decently drinkable but very oily and overly bitter from the combination of hops and roasted grain. I throughly enjoy stouts but really dislike when they are over hopped like this. No matter how much I try to like them, I just cant get into it. If american black ales are your thing, this is a must try but for $14 a 500ml bottle, they can keep it in my opinion.","stakem","Jul 11, 2011"
4.22,4.2,4,4.5,4.5,3,4,"O: The flavor on this beer is really quite something. The way that the hops is assimilated into the chocolate dessert is special. However, I think that's the most special thing about this beer. It's so much better than the mouthfeel, which doesn't connote creaminess in the same way the flavor pulls butter out of the hop resins. I think that is a really hard thing to overcome in beer, as it requires a less dry mouth-feel. The gap in the longevity of mouth-feel, which allows the alcohol to creep in over the flavor to contaminate the subtle theme of buttery chocolate creaminess. Eventually the hops takeover to reclaim the flavor in favor of coffees. However, that temporary hole in the transition of flavor is a bit irritating, and generally disrupted a pleasantly surprising flavor experience. Otherwise, this is really something to try.","Cavery","Beers"
4.05,0,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O: One thing I will say immediately about this beer as it's best to enjoy it and try it at varying temperatures, as it really does change an unusual amount as it warms up. This is an excellent single oatmeal stout with some unusual characteristics and a lot of well developed parts. Sadly, though, no eurekas in this like you might hope for from the occassional mikkeller stroke of genius. There are probably cheaper oatmeal stout alternatives on a similar level available to an american craft brew drinker. Also, while this is good, I think it's not quite as strong as mikkellers other breakfast/brunch offerings. If you're curious and have the extra cash, nothing wrong with picking this up, but this is not a 'must' for anyone interested in mikkeller or a good oatmeal stout.","Klym","0"

I enjoyed the smell on this one, classic smell of the base beer with a small but noticeable herbal hop characteristic at the end. The taste was a little disappointing to me as the hop flavor strong notes of coffee and chocolate were there but, the hop characteristic did not come through that much, slight citrus Finnish, bitter aftertaste was really all that I picked up as far as the hops go.With the smell I thought a lot more would come through in the taste. The was a medium to full body beer, still has the creamy tongue feel that the rest of the series has, nice bitter tingle left at the end. Not bad overall, mostly carried because of the base beer, not a bad twist but I am a huge fan of hoppy stouts and while still a good beer, didn't live up to what I was hoping for","GradyS1","Jun 13, 2011"

Poured black, with a big 3 finger mocha head, dissipated to a spongy film, leaving sticky, spongy lacing all the way down. The big pine notes are lot more balanced in the taste. Though bold, they meld nicely with big chocolate and coffee notes. The coffee bitterness blends well with the hop bitterness. The feel is nice and creamy, solid medium bodied, even a tad chewy. Nice bit of substance for the style. Overall, I’m in love. I adore hoppy stouts, and this is a shining example. Kudos Mikkel.","EgadBananas","Jun 07, 2011"

3.95,-2.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"An excellent, dark and thick, rich black chocolate color with a medium tan head that fades fast but leaves pretty sea foam lace. The smell is of dark chocolate, coffee, and a touch of citrus and pine. The taste is complex, full, rich and full of robust coffee, roasted malt, and dark chocolate. Notes of caramel, nuts, and citrus/pine making an appearance. I'm not sure how well the citrus flavors melt together with the roasted flavors. Not that well balanced for a stout in my opinion. A bit on the bitter side and chalky on the mouthfeel. Could use more sweet caramel notes and a creamier mouthfeel. Excellent beer overall, but had holes for critique.","JayS2629","May 20, 2011"

Turns out their is a lot of hop flavor that really competes with the coffee. The beer didn't form a big head yet there was a decent amount of carbonation. Then its dark and the overall mouth feel is medium bodied. Tricky Tricky Mikkeller! Overall this is a really good brew. I loved every sip. While this is not my favorite beer geek but still better than most other coffee beers out there. Pick one up and feel free to drink it anytime; kind of like how breakfast can be eaten at any time.","broken22","Apr 24, 2011"
4.2,3.7,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"O – The medium body and hop character are more akin to some of the black IPAs floating around than a hop-stout, but in that regard I’d rate it as one of the best black IPA’s I’ve ever had. Overall a well executed play on the style.","vfgccp","Apr 24, 2011"

Smell is average, lots of slightly stale coffee, some noble hops, a touch of roasted malts. Taste is a lot better then the smell but nothing special. Coffee, bakers chocolate, hop bitterness that carries no other hop characteristics, some earthy hops and roasted malts as it warms. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side and to active of a carbonation.

Still nice stuff. Medium to thinner MF (about the same as a regular Beergeek Breakfast) with some softer carbonation. A sipping brew, but not due to the weight.
