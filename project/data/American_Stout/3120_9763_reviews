"Poured a rich, deep dark black body with brown highlights when held to light and one finger of thick, fluffy tan head. Overall impression of appearance is of a fantastic stout. Very nice. Scents of dark chocolate, smokey strong roasted malt upfront, medium-light black coffee up front and a light sweetness and a light fruity aroma. Overall impression of aroma is of a fantastic dry stout, very roast malt-forward and quite nice. Flavor begins lightly dry with strong notes of smokey roast malt, lighter amounts of fruity flavors reminiscent of raspberries, flavors of rich dark chocolate and strong black coffee also apparent, there is a light sweetness present as well. Middle opens up further dry roasted malt and smokey flavors along with bittersweet chocolate and black coffee. Finish is dry with notes of smokey malt, black coffee and bitter cocoa, with a smokey, ashy note. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of roasted malt, smoke, and dark chocolate, with a hint of coffee, the way I make it. Overall impression of flavor is of a very nice dry stout. Deep, dark, roasty and bitter, well worth trying. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with medium carbonation and a drying, roasty feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice stout, true to form, light yet full enough, very nice. Overall this is a fantastic dry stout. If you like a good stout, that is true to style, dry and full try this one, it's a good one."

"A no frills, no nonsense stout, just tasty and very drinkable."

"Had on tap at Row 34 while waiting to get into Trillium.  This was a very tasty well balanced stout - not overly chocolately or a coffee overload, just a well carbonated malty stout.  I liked this a lot.  Also considering it is 4pm on a Tuesday, it makes it even better."

"These guys really know how to make a great beer. While it is not my favorite of their beers it beats a lot of other breweries stouts out of the water . It has a great coffee/ chocolate aroma and flavor. And a nice full bodied mouth feel to round out a nice beer."

"Acrid and dry. Nice appearance, mellow flavor, overly roasted and little chocolate"

"On tap. Pours black, especially to my eyes in a dark setting. Creamy, tight, lasting head. Random lacing. Smell is pretty potent. The good old blend of roast and chocolate. Smell is dry and I don't think it will be too sweet. Flavor is a good ol' American Stout. Some black coffee and baker's chocolate. Dry as I expected it to be. I really enjoyed the simplicity. Boom! Stout to the face. A good non-imperial Stout to boot. Creamy feel. Fuller than the ABV would suggest. A good pint. I like being able to slurp a Stout that isn't 15% nowadays."
"Lots of coffee on the tongue. Smooth but in an espresso sort of way. Rich body but with a good level of carbonation. Relatively short aftertaste."

"Dark brown/black and very opaque. A light khaki color 2 finger head. A pleasant roasted malt aroma with some coffee and chocolate afternotes. Nice and smooth. You get the roasted malt and chocolate but it's a nice subtle flavor with a coffee back end. If a stout could be sessionable this is it. Light bodied for a stout. Light carbonation."

"O.  A nice stout.  Not your thick stout but it's very drinkable. Nice smooth flavor.  Would drink again."

"t: color me impressed. i know Alpine is know for the hops, but this is a nice beer. nice harmonization of chocolates, roast, and sweet malt. my criticism would be maybe a bit too much carbonation in the mouthfeel, almost makes it feel like a soda. otherwise its an easy drinker with nice flavors. not heavy enough to be a sipper, but not something to rush"
"This reminds me a lot of Cadillac Mountain in some ways, what a great example of a nice straightforward stout."

"Got in a trade with swingracex. 22 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, oats, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, oats, and light earthy hops; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, oats, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, oats, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, oats, and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oatmeal stout. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, oats, and light earthy hop flovors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Captain stout was slightly disappointing. It looked rich and beautiful, had a decent head, but lacked in flavor and mouthfeel what I typically enjoy in oatmeal stouts. Not super robust, lacking in mealiness (went down more like a porter), and I didn't detect much in the way of chocolate notes. Not bad, but not excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque very dark brown with a quickly dissipating pale mocha head. Chocolate up front on the nose that yields to coffee. Mouthfeel is a little thin for the style. Little to no chocolate in the flavor, but smoke and coffee in spades. Finishes pretty abruptly."

"o - overall, a nice stout...are you sure this isn't a porter? super easy drinker."
""
"O - A really easy drinker, lots of stout characteristics but nothing beyond pushing it to outstanding, a really good stout but it isn't anything breathtaking"
"Nice to try, wouldn't seek it out."
""
"Overall this was a pretty solid Stout. In my opinion not as above average as Alpine IPA's are to the rest of the world but pretty good."
""
"Overall it's a solid beer. Nothing exciting but nothing disappointing. I would drink it if I found it on tap, but I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out"
""
""
""
""
"Overall-- Alpine is not known for their dark beers, and this beer is no reason for that change. It certainly isn't bad, but it is mediocre, which I suppose means it's pretty bad in terms of comparing..."
""
""
""
"O: If you're looking for an everyday, (dare I say) session American Stout, you've come to the right place. I absolutely love this beer. It's such a chill beverage, yet it ain't easy to craft something this well balanced and drinkable. An easy recommendation from one of my all-time favorite breweries."
""
"O-- Just light enough to be able to want to drink more but big enough to carry all the aspects of the beer. Well balanced and a lot of fun to drink. Not necessarily exciting but a well performed beer. Types of beers I wish were made more often down here and not the watery 4.5% ones."
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice stout with lots of balanced flavors, but still on the lighter side and fairly sessionable."
""
"From the usual 22 oz bottle. Quite drinkable, but I can't see paying the bomber price for an average stout."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied but on the fuller end with a good balance of sweet and roasted malt notes. Slight creamy texture and not as smokey as the aroma suggests. Hints of toast, dark chocolate, coffee and oatmeal along with some creamy, silky chocolate.  Not overly roasted, acrid or but. Well balanced and easy to drink."
"O - This one was not too bad. It never really wowed me in any way but it was still pretty solid. A good pallet cleanser after all the sours we had."
""
""
"Overall: An easy drinking stout with simple, tasty flavors; appropriately dry; not necessarily outstanding for the style but certainly good. One doesn’t generally think of stouts when they think of Alpine do they?"
"A rather standard beer from Alpine, but enjoyable nonetheless. Isn't it crazy how this retails for $8 in stores even around San Diego, yet $5 at the brewery?"
"A good stout, but not awesome. Almost more of a big brown, but still tasty."
""
""
""
"O - This was a nice end to a rough day, but in all honesty really expect more from Alpine. It was OK, but not as in your face as the rest of Alpine's lineup that i have had."
"Overall: This is an ok stout. Based on the nose it is a let down. Great nose weak flavor"
"Fuller medium body, well carbonated, a little chewy and sticky on the tongue. A pretty decent stout, although I've come to expect a little more explosive flavor from Alpine."
"O: An easy drinking stout. While not overly complex, there is nothing wrong with it. A little more chocolate/caramel/vanilla would have been nice."
""
"[63/100]"
"O- Nice flavors, but the mouthfeel was way too light for my liking. A decent offering from Alpine."
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light to medium in body, with a great amount of carbonation. Very smooth and creamy. Overall, a good stout. Nice roast character and nicely integrated flavors. I enjoyed this quite a bit."

"Cheers..."
"O: A really solid stout with a very nice mouthfeel and interesting flavor profile."
"O: Not bad, especially for the price (around 4/5 bucks). Definitely a nice starter to stouts. I would consider this a great gateway beer from getting people off the Guinness and Murphy kind of watered down stouts."
"A bit of a miss from Alpine for me. Overall I found this enjoyable but more of a session-type stout with the thin light body that wont fill you up. But I lacked that great mouthfeel one expects with an Oatmeal Stout."
"Got this courtesy of a trade with hamilton23. Aggressive pour of a 22 oz. bottle revealed a dark brown with a huge 3-finger coffee-colored head. Lacing was thin but lasting. Nose was coffee, roasted vanilla, some dark chocolate and grains. Taste was coffee, cocoa with some citrus, milk and a notable nutty taste.. Finish was somewhat bitter and dry. Mouthfeel was kinda' thin and not overly carbonated. If you had given me this blindfolded, I would have guessed this was a stout by looks but a porter by taste. Liked it, but with so many great offerings from this brewery, I wouldn't kill for another. Decent, but not thrilling."
"O: A lot of good flavors and complexity running around in this considering it's a single stout. I think if you fixed up the body this would be very exceptional in-style. I loved the coconut note and might just find myself trying their captain willy mix someday; would actually probably be pretty tasty."
"A smooth, intensely flavored stout. Alpine isn't just the best with hops; these guys know their roast as well."
"A roasty and somewhat sweet stout. Incredibly drinkable."
"Overall, I enjoy Captain Stout greatly. Kind of a Guinness on chocolate steroids, with substantial vanilla bean and maple flavors. Just wish that mouthfeel was more than she wrote."
"Taste is OK, a bit of bitterness from the dark malts, almost has a slightly sour finish. Thin feel, wish there was more here."
"Large and bubbly head, easy three fingers during the pour, large concentration of big bubbles in the middle simmers down to a more consistent surface which retains at the one finger level, dark brown in hue, the lacing is thin yet clings impressively to the glass. The liquid is fully black, skips brown and goes straight to orange for a thin stripe at the glass bottom. The nose is noticeably dry and somewhat sour as well, oats, grains, breads, sour milk mixed in with dark chocolate, cocoa and coffee grinds, more herbaceous than nutty, the fruit is muted but what’s there is sweeter than the rest of the scents, nectarine, peach, melon, the roast outlasts all else. Medium-bodied, if flatfooted, picks a spot and just sits there. The carbonation is too weak to add liveliness. Same emphasis on coffee, cocoa, mocha with heavy roast leading to dry mouth feel. Here orange citrus sweetens the pot some, even as the apple, peach, white grape fruit struggles to find a place, not the usual darker fruit profile. The nuttiness comes through more, the bready, yeasty notes less so. Keeps its weight throughout and never gets undesirably bitter. Leaves you wishing there was more breadth of flavor as well as sweetness, drinkable but not remarkable."
"22oz. bottle poured into my Stone taster glass. Not a thick pour, but this looks like a stout. Dark brown with some tan head. Smell is fairly muted with some roasted malt and hints of chocolate and perhaps some coffee. Taste is a bit watery and muted as well. Roasted malts are the main feature. A little thin with decent carbonation. Easy to drink, but probably my least favorite beer from Alpine."
"Beer is medium to light in body, moderate malt flavor up front, no hops to speak of, moderate bitterness and roast at the back, not a dry finish. Overall a decent average American stout. Pretty good."
"Pours very dark brown with a tan head. The nose is a bit roast and oddly cherry sweet. It's actually a bit of an uh-oh nose. That taste, ugh, the taste. A huge mess of sweet dark fruit, gross cherry sweetness, a some what dry finishing stout. The whole thing was a mess and possibly and infected mess. I don't toss that term around, but this was pretty awful in that cherry, beginning vinegar way that suggests such. Alpine makes some amazing beer and this, in the state it reached me in the bottle, is not in that stratosphere. Major let down. Mouthfeel was thin, starting to get a bit watery. Let's just say that everyone in the room drain poured after 0-1 sips. I gave it a few, but after that, it was down the drain."
"Pours black and is cola brown at the edges under light. Two fingers of creamy light khaki colored head and leaves foamy sheeting on the glass. Nose is very sweet with brown sugar molasses, dehydrated tropical fruits (mango guava) and a faint whisper of roasted malts. Taste hits with roasted and almost charred malts and some coffee and again with a dark sugary sweetness and no fruit to speak of. Never really found any chocolate character in this beer. Drinkable and tasty albeit somewhat sweet and really had a hard time getting around it."
"O - a decent, light stout, but a little too watery for my tastes. I wouldn't be opposed to having this one again."
"Pours an opaque dark brown with a tiny 1/2 inch beige head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing. Smells of slight chocolate and coffee but I think this one is infected. There is a musty gym socks smell. This would make the 2nd Alpine beer so far that has been infected. Taste is of funky chocolate/coffee that has been fermented in used gym socks. Horrible. Mouthfeel is surprisingly average. Overall, another loser of a beer from Alpine and I am disappointed once again."
"I appreciate this is a fairly ($6) priced bottle of a sessionable oatmeal stout, but I just don't see the complexities in this beer that other reviews do. Coffee, vanilla, caramel, just don't taste it in this beer."
"Its a good beer for sure. Not your standard Stout so I can see how some wouldn't like it a lot but I think its tasty!"
"O - easily drinkable but I would rather go for something with a bit more depth."
"D - It's an average stout at best. Personally, I wouldn't buy another bottle."
"Finish is all medium bitter black coffee/espresso."
"Not their best work. Not very complex compared to a lot of stouts. It pours a dark brown with a thin head a spotty lacing. It smells of coffee and chocolate but nothing to write home about. Taste is the same it's is coffee and chocolate up front but neither is spectacular. I would call this a safe beer. It isnt great but it isn't terrible I would drink it again but not while exponential is on tap."
"3.0 D: Pretty mediocre across the board. Worth a try, but mainly to know that this shouldn't be sought after."
"its pitch black with a thin light tan head. the head dissipated quickly and does not lace at all. smells very malty and chocolatey, perfectly stoutly, thick and oaty. taste is chocolate, massive malt backbone, something slightly nutty or sweet and fruity. I like it, its very drinksble and yes, good mouthfeeling. just what I look for in a stout."
"D - Drinkability is pretty high. A pleasant stout for sure but not a mindblowing one. Really this is a solid beer and I am glad to try it. I would happily drink more of these if the opportunity arose."
"D: Outstanding drinkability. I think it ran $5 a bomber, which is on the cheaper end for bombers in this state. I am impressed and will be seeking this out again."
"I'm glad I stopped in at Alpine during my trip to SD. Very nice brew!"
"Lower abv, and an over all tasty brew make this an easy drinker."
"Alpine really makes some very enjoyable beers."
"D - Nice, but really big flavors. Would tire during session."
"D:This beer had a nice drinkability factor and was quite pleasant overall."
"Drinkability - This is one of those beers that smelled great but missed the mark at the taste. It lacked the complexity that I look forward to in the style."
"Notes: I would have guessed this was a porter if I'd tasted it blind. I think the name threw me off - Alpine makes big beer, and ""Captain Stout"" doesn't sound like a shrinking violet. That being said, the end product is a very tasty, easy-to-drink ale and one I would recommend to someone new to the style."
"D: Low ABV and good flavors make it a very drinkable Stout IMO."
"My pour created two fingers' worth of rich, deep-tan head with great retention. The nose was very roasty, rich with coffee and chocolate. Zounds, but I found myself wishing that I had someone to share this with! It just smelled like an after dinner/dessert beer and a bomber would probably be overkill for a solo drinker. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a definite roasty/charcoal flavor on the tongue. Color was a deep, dark brown with ruby highlights. Going back to the taste, I was reminded of a Hershey's Milk Chocolate bar that I purchased in c. 1970 for .10, my first allowance. My mother was with me and it remains one of my earliest memories. Seldom does a beer evoke such vivid reminiscences, but this one certainly did. The finish had a silky quality generally found in cask-conditioned beers, accompanied by the chocolate flavor that simply transported me in time. I feel justified in giving this a solid 5."
"While I appreciated the richness of the flavors here, the thickness of the roasty character and overall feel just help the drinkibility back some for me, despite this being on cask. I'm interested in checking this out in the bottle or draft to see how it compares."
"D-This is actually what I look for in stouts--a bit of coffee, a bit of chocolate, and sessionability. I think i could knock down a few of these around the fire and be satisfied. Good stuff."
"D-easy drinking and big bold flavors, I love a good American stout with nice low abv and this is done quite well, nice roasted backbone with a touch of sweetness!"
"Overall I probably won't try this again. Especially if there are other things to try or I know are better."
"Pours a very dark brown with a nice, two-fingered head. The smell was nice, lots of roasted malt and a little chocolate and coffee. The taste is quite nice as well, with some sweetness from the malt as well as coffee, chocolate, and a bit of roast. A little thin, but very drinkable."
"Received in trade from TexIndy, thanks as always for the opportunity. Pours a solid dark brown with the faintest of ruby highlights when held to the light. Tightly bubbled tan head dissipates quickly to form a cap. Smells of coffee and milk chocolate, caramel, and a slight bit of ash deep in the back. Taste is roasty with coffee, chocolate, caramel, a bit of dark fruit. Lingering fruity roasted gran bitterness in the finish. Prickly carbonation, medium body, creamy mouthfeel. Nice stout. A bit high on the carbonation, but otherwise a great stout."
"Drinkability: This beer may not take the world by storm, but I found it to be a very acceptable stout. Might not be my first choice for stout, but I'd not turn this one down."
"Served from a bottle, poured into a snifter."
"D: This is a nice, easy drinking stout. A good stout to have that's better than your run of the mill Guiness, but not a big ol' monster of a beer either."
"D - Good drinking stout, you can have a few pints and not be stuff. Not the best from Alpine, but that isn't saying much as they have a barrage of incredible beers."
"Drinkability is high. I had to down 8oz within about a minute when our cab showed up early and it was no problem (although it didn't help my brutal hangover the next day). Solid stout from Alpine."
"Overall, a really good stout that for me falls a mostly into American stout but with strong hints of milk stout and a little bit of oatmeal stout. Had this at the brewery during my trip and it was just a little better on-tap. I still prefer the Pure Hoppiness and Duet from them but this is great change of pace and a quality stout. Rotation: not avail in TX - shipped to myself. Worth getting a couple shipped per year. On-tap when out West."
"Beer poured dark brown with a decent tan head. Nose is quite nice, heavy on coffee and roasted malts. Taste is a nice blend of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and smooth from the oatmeal. Overall drinkability is good. This is a wonderful stout, full of character that I could enjoy all day."
"I found the flavors in this one to be very subtle and mild. Not really in a bad way, just a more toned down stout than I'm used to. A slight chocolaty, roasted quality. Didn't get much coffee taste. Light bitterness at the beginning that quickly mellows out into chocolate malts. Has a nice clean finish. I'm not a huge fan of stouts, but I'd probably get this one again."
"Blipped ""Captain Bobby Stout"" by Earth Band"
"May be a bit thin as compared to the stouts I usually flavor, but this was pretty nice. Actually, what it reminds me of is a souped up, big brother version of Stockyard Oatmeal Stout."
"Solid drinkability and offers a smooth feel. Recommend."
"D: A real nice stout from the guys at Alpine, just wish I could get it up here, would be a solid session beer. Quite enjoyable."
"On tap at SD Beer Festival and O'Briens. Pours black with very little head. Aroma is malt and strong coffee. Taste is coffee and chocolate milk, with a sharp finish. Mouthfeel is not as heavy an you would expect. Not light, but creamy. Overall, a very good beer that needs a bit of time in a barrel or a little more substance."
"Notes from 12/28/07"
"Dark black, healthy head. Smells malty and tastes like it has a touch of cocoa. Not a bad stout and a nice change from all these high gravity stouts everyone seem to make these days. Solid beer and I'm glad my cousin brought it to me and I wish I had a bottle of the old chez monieux to follow it up.."
"Pours black with a tan head. Nose is like coffee, but old truck stop coffee. Minor roasted thing going on. The flavor strikes me as a bit ""green"". A bit too bright and tangy. Decent roasted tones. Feel has a fairly full carbonation and the liquid is nicely thick. Overall a good stout. Nothing really earth shattering. But it doesn't suck."
"D-Full flavoured and smooth at 5.5%...this is an American session stout to be proud of!"
"Bottle at RBSG 08 Grand Tasting. Poured into my La Chouffe goblet. Black with a frothy cocoa head that leaves spotty lacing. Cocoa aroma with moderate roastiness. Bitter chocolate flavor with a metallic roasty finish. A little thin, but still very drinkable."
"I'm glad that I got to try this, and I'd recommend it to others but it's not necessarily my most favorite stout out there."
"Overall this was a mixed bag for me. I was expecting it to be much fuller then it was. The aroma, look, and flavors were really quite nice, but that bitter and acidy taste in the finish combined with a less then full Mouthfeel were real distracters for me. Still though, a very worthy stout and something that is definitely worth trying out."
"Notes: A very solid stout, but I can think of a few others I like more."
"Purchased: South Bay Drugs Pharmacy, Imperial Beach CA"
"Overall, a decent stout, but not fantastic."
"Not my favorite Alpine brew but still good, good to see they took a break from brewing all those IPAs, will probably grab some bottles of this in the future, recommended"
"Pours beautiful as a stout should with a fuzzy active milk chocolate colored three finger head. It quickly settles to just a half inch. Body sets in the glass like a big black opal. Nose is zesty and sweet with malty spice smoke. An initial sweet and sour battle dances on the tongue. Noticeable bitter sweet feel reminds me of bakers chocolate. This tart bitter feel bounces off each other and completely dominates the palate. As for as an American stout goes this one lacks the soft rich balance I expect from this style. Mouthfeel stays with that same sour bitter with a bit of thickness. As I do some research I relize that I may have gotten a bad bottle based on other reviews I have looked at. As far as this one goes its drinkability is just OK."
"A full brown with lots of head, dots of lace. A lactic sourness that tears through before settling on the roasty and coffee and chocolate malted finish.Mouthfeel is creamed but the body is still average at most. Its a brown beer with stouty characteristics."
"Pours black with a light tan head. Smell is milky, roasted malt and metal at first. Body is a bit too thin, but not too bad. Decent roasty flavor with a hint of chocolate. Watery finish, and I had a hard time deciding how much I liked this one. Didn't get the oatmeal creaminess as listed in the description. Decent, but very forgettable."
"Its a good beer but its definitely not the most impressive stout I've ever had. Drinkable and enjoyable espeically if you want something lighter in abv but as I don't like coffee to begin with, this was pretty much a decently good beer."
"Alpine Captain Stout is one of the more unique beers that I've had in quite some time. It wouldn't be a regular purchase (assuming I had easy access), but I'm having a good time nevertheless. Now, about that double stout..."
"Poured from 22oz bottle froms ports bottle shop. Bottle reads 6% not 5.5% abv. Poured a nice coffee black with a thick mocha tan head. Smells is of coffee and chocolate, like smoothing from starbucks would smell like. Taste is sweet chocolate and with a rich coffee backbone, hints of vanilla and dry out finish it out. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy but full and rich at the same time. I could drink this stout for hours, and hours, and hours, etc...Good job again alpine."
"From a growler purchased 1 week ago at Alpine. Pours with a clear black that is ruby red at the corners. Nice light tan head builds up but fades fairly fast. This from a few inches away this beer smells of high roastiness. But when you get your nose into it a ton of caramel and a little chocolate come out. The taste is like a sweet caramel liquid. It's a pretty savory beer, with some roasted bitterness at the end to still let ya know it's a stout. Upgraded rankings to 4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"Personal score- 72/100"
"Much thanks to Ryan for the chance to sample this one."
"Pours a clear brown/red, thick tan head forms, nice lacing, very thick layer, looks like a stout. Smell is caramelized, roasted grain, vanilla and chocolate, nice and dry, cherries, some grain, nice. Taste is malty, oats, toffee, chocolate and coffee roast, light fruits, nice rich finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, nice dry roasty finish. Pretty decent stout, very enjoyable. Thanks Paul!"
"Very good stout here...another stellar offering from Alpine. This might not quite be on the level of Cadillac Mtn., but it's not far behind."
"Pours a complete black with not a single bit of light coming through with a dark tan one finger head with large bubbles that quickly dies down to just about nothing. Stickiness is hardly there, disappointing in a sense...but looks can be deceiving! Smell is a great combination of roasted barley, dark chocolate malt, and french roast coffee. Sweet caramel malt is definitely there too, love this one on the nose. Tatste starts off with a fresh roasted coffee flavor soon followed by a quick hop bite. Midway through is a perfect caramel sweetness. This one ends with a big roasted barley flavor that lasts and lasts on the tongue. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light bodied with some graininess and a fair amount of carbonation. Great drinkability for this one due to the light body and complete absence of alcohol in the nose and on the tongue. Great brew overall, definitely get a hold of this one if you have the chance. Alpine continues to produce great brews."
"Pours an opaque black with a delicious chocolate head that is sticky and laces steadily. Smells of roasted coffee beans, ground coffee beans and minimal malt and caramel. Finishes with a bite of hops. Medium in the mouth with some nice carbonation. Drinkability is decent, its not a sipper but its not a session beer. Overall a tasty offering."
"The mouthfeel is nice and thick while being fairly smooth. This has turn into a staple stout to be in my beer fridge, and for only $3.99 per 22oz. bottle is incredible. Great job for Alpine."
"Highly recommended. One of the best American stouts I have had - and loaded with chocolate - an excellent thing. And yes, Alpine is indeed bottling this now."
"D- fits style well, flavor is excellent, would pair well with desserts or could be one on it's own, sessionable, recommended"
"The % is surprising, this tasted like it had alot more alcohol than 5.5%. This is an interesting stout, but i think it might be better with some age."
"D: Good balance with nice complexity. Hand crafted and well done. Another fine beer from Alpine."
"The flavor is all of the above...super rich, smooth and creamy...very tasty with a nice bitter finish. Full body with a smoothness that is easy to swallow and a mild ABV that makes it all too easy to drink. A great breakfast or dessert beer...highly recommended, cheers!"
"Pours a deep dark brown, but not quite black, its like peering into a glass of the abyss, floating atop is a clean tanned crown that fades into a small halo. Aroma of toasted caramels, burnt maple and rich roasted espresso beans. Flavor is a huge caramel malted complexity featuring notes of bittersweet chocolate, caramel, toasted brown sugar, fresh coffee and maple syrup. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy with a super dry finish. A really great offering from Alpine and one of the better dry stouts out there, definitely worth a try or even a session. Not to be missed on cask!!"
"This beer would make an excelent session beer. It is not high in alcohol, and the flavor is not aggressive. This might be one of the best Stouts I have ever had. If Alpine bottled this, I would definately keep a stock of it in my beer fridge."
"Overall: excellent quaffable smooth stout."
"The beers pours a pitch black with a smallish chocolate head, the texture spumous and the lace thick and sticky. Nose has a light coffee and chocolate aroma with sweet malt underneath, start is sweet and has a pleasing malt presence, top is moderate in feel. Finish has a nice bit of hops and the acidity mild to moderate, very dry and lingering aftertaste, a nice stout overall."
"First imperial pint glass pours with a dense light brown 3/4"" head, over this very, very dark brown, almost black hued brew. Head showed amazing staying power, and the aroma was strongly of coffee and chocolate grains. Following along those lines, the taste was as well of the roasted malts. Mouthfeel and drinkability were excellent for such a heavy brew. Wish I could try it over and over to make sure I've got my rating correct..."
"Nearly black yet deceivingly dark as dark brown can get. Medium loosely frothy broken chocolate brown colored crown that remains constant for a good measure; lace in minimal spots. Aroma is packed with solid roasted malt with some nice espresso and dark chocolate notes creeping through. Not fully potent or strong really but very nice to let simmer and wiff. Taste is well rounded with a smooth chocolate front thats favorably dark and lush with a creamy lingering into the middle where espresso flavors really meld in incredibly nicely. Oh, so close to burnt roasted espresso-like flavors and the bittering is subdued enough for full enjoyment. Quite nice to behold. Hence the finish, where it gets a bit of everything mixing and changing with a sweetened roast filled espresso dryness that has a chocolate twinge of bitterness to top it off. Feel is smooth and close to full with a good amount of give in each sip and is a bit sweet in areas with an espresso and chocolatey drying coming through from midway all the way to its remarkable little finish. Nice lingering capabilities with the bittering and espresso. This reminds me alot of the Bell's Java Stout, just not as over the top as the Bell's but right up there just the same. Big thanks to the Big Dog for sending me a refilled and capped bottle (from a growler I'm assuming)."
"Overall: One of the best Dry Irish Stouts I have had in a very long time. The first of my ABC samplers, and still my favorite, after the other three. A larger glass would have been ordered for sure if I had not been on a quest to try as many of the offerings as possible in the limited time we had, as well as the fact that it was very early in a long days tour of San Diego beer establishments. Highly recommended for filling Growlers, or any container for that matter, including your stomach."
