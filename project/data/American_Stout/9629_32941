4.22,3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/2/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge roasted coffee bean, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, char, toast, cream, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with big coffee presence and great complexity of roasted malt/cream notes; with great strength. Taste of roasted coffee bean, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light char, cream, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, toast, cream, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of coffee, roasted malt, and cream flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome coffee stout! All around great balance and complexity of coffee, roasted malt, and cream flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 14, 2014"

A slightly bitter coffee taste that only slightly detracts from the drinkability. A solid mouth feel but not chewy enough for my tastes. Overall a solid offering from Shorts.

2.24,-45,4,2.5,1.5,4,2,"Business travel means trying local beers, and after having a terrific Humalupalicious the other night, as a coffee enthusiast, stout enthusiast, and coffee stout enthusiast, I was looking forward to the bottle I picked up at Big Ten Party Store in Okemos, MI. Damnitall, this was a letdown. The funky whiff of scorched coffee resin emanating from the bottle was a warning shot. It was smooth in the mouth and had some good stout-y qualities, but my taste buds were battered by overwhelming burnt coffee, left-my-coffeemaker-on-all-day tones. Any other subleties in taste were blown away by the coffee. Cup a Joe was marginally finish-able, but not buyagain-able.","lurpy1","Mar 31, 2011"
3.8,-6.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours into a mug a dark black with a dark tan head that was almost non existant untill pour was agitated. Pretty standard looking for the style. Nose is the strongest coffee auroma I've ever gotten from a beer. There's also dark cocoa and a roasted note of a can of coffee beans. Taste is very bold and sweet. Heavy of the coffee flavour, a toasted bean taste that remains bitter and a sweet hint of milky sugar in the finish which ends creamy. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little underwhealming for a stout. Remains creamy throughout. Overall, for me this is an overdone coffee/cream stout, though I suppose that's why it's Imperial. If you like bold coffee notes this is certainly worth checking out; I'll stick with the more subtle coffee beers.

The nose comprises coffee (and lots of it, son!), light cocoa, roasted malts, and brown sugar. The taste does not feel brave enough to deviate from this plan of attack. Some buttercream finds its way in there as well. In the finish, though, there is a definite feeling of acrid coffee, which VDubb helps me to understand as the aftertaste one would encounter in a bad cup o' coffee.

I must admit the almost too sweet aftertaste is rather off putting when combined with the rest of this beers flavor. It leaves that bad taste in my mouth that happens after drinking a cheap cup of coffee, perhaps some halitosis to go along with it.

4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall, i would heartily recommend this beer to those who love imperial stouts, and a good, full-bodied coffee with cream and sugar.

Taste is delicious, with bold coffee flavor and dark chocolate bitterness. I do wish they would not have used lactose in this as I think it makes the stout too sweet, and I wish the finish was dryer. There is no hop presence whatsoever. Body is big and think with little carbonation. The more I drink it the more I wish it wasn't so sweet.

Upfront on the palate the roasted chocolate malts and coffee really come together quite well with toasty grain accents and slight booze. The only bad thing was that I did detect some slight tart flavor that I believe is a result of the infection this beer been tainted with; what a shame. The brew was medium in body with a relative high amount of carbonation which had a sweet, roasty, slight astringent, and tart finish. It drank good but was dissapointed on the infectious qualities this beer had.

The dark cherry notes and mild woody flavors from the stout come forward at first and later a tannic tinge of raw astringent coffee beans w/a slight golden raisin and subtle cocoa note. The light toasted tinge of caramel malt softens the fruitiness slightly. I was perplexed but happy with the beer -not like any coffee brew or stout I have had, and no, it did not have a ring in the neck or smell off at all, so I am going to assume it was untainted.

Smells powerfully ofsweetened coffee, almost as if there's nothing else there. A little chocolate comes through, but there's not a whole lot of complexity to be found. The taste comes up slightly fruity, like plums or a little grape-y, but the roasted coffee is still predominant, with s nice little kick of sweetness to finish - though I'd say the sweetness starts to catch on a bit more as the drink goes on. Not impressive, but not too bad. The body is pretty good. Nice and creamy, a little on the heavy side of medium, with a nice little kick of carbonation. Pretty good. Overall, this is a decent beer. I think it's kind of average though - it's got it's highs and lows, but I don't know if I would come back to it, without some significant improvements.","taylorhamrick","Jul 02, 2010"

This beer is balanced to near perfection - the bitterness of the dark roasts meets the sweetness of the milk sugar and makes everything right with the world. I could drink 3 or 4 bottles of this no problem, and then land flat on my ass. Expedition Stout, KBS, Peche Mortel, Weasel, and just about every other coffee beer other than GI BCBCS can take a seat, because Cup a Joe is in the house!","airohead2001","Jun 26, 2010"

Being the second Short's beer I've had recently (the PB&J...which I believe both of these to be bottled about the same time frame) I wonder if their priming yeast changed or their measurement calibration for priming sugar was off when these were bottled.

Nose and flavors consist of deep roasted espresso, mocha, caramel, molasses, a hint of vanilla, and an mild yet unpleasant sourness. Medium bodied with lively carbonation.

Haven't even put my nose up to the glass and I can smell it from here. Coffee, and a healthy amount of it. Some milky creamy sweetness to it hidden under the smell of roasted malt and coffee beans. Taste is more of the same, coffee up front with a milky middle and roasted finish. Mouthfeel is okay. It's a little too carbonated for my liking, lots and lots of tiny bubbles across the tongue as I sip. I would prefer a little smoother mouthfeel but it not bad. Alcohol barely present in the taste but drinkability is hurt for me by the carbonation. Overall this is a nice beer though.

Taste is chocolate and bitter coffee with a creaminess that I haven't found in many other stouts. There is a slight acidic quality in the taste that I didn't expect from the nose.

It doesn't have the intensely fresh ground/oily coffee flavour that Peche Mortel has, but is still a nice coffee beer none-the-less. I look forward to trying out more Short's has to offer.

4.14,1.7,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"12oz bottle, extra from Wadsey, among other Shorts beers I can't easily get a hold of. The beer is dark brown and opaque, with a thick tan froth that quickly receded to a thin spotty film. The aroma is rich coffee with roasted malts and a lactic sweetness, the lactic acid adding a little something new that I haven't smelled in other coffee stouts. The coffee is the main thing I taste up front, with the creme coming through in a long sweet finish. There might be oatmeal in here too, at least the body seems creamy and coating like an oatmeal stout. Really good, not my favorite coffee stout but a solid stab at the style.","TurdFurgison","Beers"

4.83,18.7,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"The pour is beautiful and elegant, perfect. Dark as night with a huge black body and a color that is inpervious to light. A huge two inch head of tan then rises up from the bottom of the glass to reach a height of nearly three inches before settling down to a one inch head that stays on top throughout the rest of the session. Aroma is sweet, rich coffee and milk, tons of sweet sugary notes, it really is as the bottle states, exactly what I make for myself in the morning. Sweet light roasted coffee and creme, mixed with subtle sugar flavors. There is not other beer that nails the coffee flavor better then this. It is simply sublime. Rich body, smooth and subtle carbonation and a slightly dry and bitter finish. There is hardly a beer out there I would rather have at any point then this.","mikesgroove","Jan 18, 2010"

4.15,2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Big thanks to schro126 for hooking up with this long-sought brew. Pours pitch black with barely any light at the edges, small dark tan head that stuck around a bit in the tulip leaving decent lacing. Coffee and caramel are dominate in the nose while this beer is cold but some nice chocolaty notes start to come out upon warming. Smells sweet and roasty. Flavor is largely espresso coffee. It's a little less balanced than what I was expecting. Coffee dominates followed by a sharp bitterness, lightly sour, some chocolate and roastiness. Wish there was little more lactose character to balance the bitterness of the coffee. Body is also a little thinner than I expected, considering the thick pour, and carbonation is biting. This is a very coffee-forward beer, and it tends to dominate the flavor profile too much. I'm going to give a few of these bottles some time to age and see how they progress. As of right now, it's tasty, but I think the coffee can mellow a bit and allow some more of the chocolate to come out. Thanks again, Nathan!","KeefD","Jan 15, 2010"

The sweetness is quickly swept away by the biting French roast coffee flavor. The coffee character is intense, bitter, almost acrid, while still remaining thoroughly delicious. Medium-bodied and very effervescent, this is surprisingly quaffable for such a punchy beer. The finish is nothing but lingering coffee grounds.

Strong bitter roster espresso bean flavor with chewy chocolate malts, earthy hops, toffee and burnt toast/coffee notes. The roasted flavor is a bit overpowering, taking away from the silky chocolate notes but overall this beer is decently balanced. The strong roaster character makes it slightly less quaffable and a touch harsh but I'm still putting this one down pretty quickly.","corby112","Jan 09, 2010"

The abv% on this one is in that nice in-between place where I actually like my stronger stouts to be - it's flavorful enough that it's a sipper to begin with, and with an abv% this comparably low, a second wouldn't be out of the question (if it weren't such a rare treat to get some in Virginia). The one other thing I'd say about this beer's drinkability is that it's a really authentic beer - complex, sure, flavorful, sure, but it's not in a Jahva or Choklat complex or flavorful way. This one's just well-made, and a good introduction to a brewery that I know excels at these kind of oftentimes intuitive (like here) and oftentimes weird (Bloody Mary beer!?) mashups.","CrellMoset","Dec 31, 2009"

Oh so creamy with first sip of this lush beer. Lots of coffee feel but in such a smooth and sweet desert kind of way. This is a lovely coffee stout without being to heavy in the normal stout kind of way, to stereo type the style. Very appealing coffee feel stays on the tongue. This is really a coffee lovers stout.
