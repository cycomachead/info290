"Nice color and aroma. Bready, caramel/toffee notes, with chocolate finish. Also great as a float but somewhat boozy"
""
""
"Very heavy rich beer nice flavors mellow bourbon  after taste"
""
"Good beer.  I like everything about only issue was that it was served way to cold.  Once it warmed a little i got more of the flavors and aroma I was expecting.  Definitely a beer worth trying."

"Draught into a snifter.  Beautiful deep dark brown.  Only beer I've ever rated a 5 overall as I absolutely loved it.  Coffee and great bourbon flavor and the toastiness gives it a great depth of flavor.  My personal favorite of all of the BBS's I've tried."

"Ok for an everyday beer, but more girlie than I prefer"
"Pours a deep, deep brown. Without a light overhead it looks black. It has a thick light tan head that settles down and leaves some nice soapy lacing. The aroma is big bourbon goodness. It doesn't have the vanilla or oaky but the bourbon sweetness. There is also a little dark roasted malt in the background. The taste isn't quite as robust, but both the aroma qualities are present. It almost tastes as though someone dropped a shot in the beer (which isn't a bad thing) but the two flavors don't meld a seamlessly as other barrel-aged beers. The body is lighter in weight as well, not as thick or oily. Just short of great."
"This is the first bba beer I considered pouring down the drain"
"A good drinking bourbon stout as the flavor doesn't drive you away if your not a whiskey drinker. Too thin for my stout preference, but drinkable for it's lighter abv. Good intro stout."
""
""
"Like a piece of buttered toast. Just a hint of whiskey and a real bargain compared to most barrel aged stouts. This beer made me happy."
"Not an huge fan of this beer.  Too thin, too much bourbon (for the low svc), and no real presence of the base beer.  Rather have had a shot of wild turkey instead."
""
"Overall:  it's a little *too* bourbon-ey, but for the most part is a very well-done beer."
"Will not seek out or purchase again. I will try a few more barrel aged style beers though to see if it was the style or just this one that I didn't like."
""
""
"Look: Is a dark dark brown. Smell: roasted chocolate malt smell. Bourbon with some raisin s on the nose. Lots of vanilla .  Taste: Is a really nice roasted chocolate with bitter caramel and vanilla. Dark chocolate covered coconut. Feel: light body, watery, bitterness hangs around a lil bit. overall: this is not your typical BBS it is 6.5% which is cool because you could drink the whole bottle. It is not overly sweet and heavy. It has the complexity of your typical bourbon barrel beer which is pretty awesome. I like this beer a lot I bought a couple and going to try aging a couple see how a low abv handles a cellar ."
"I had this beer on draft and it was served a little to cold. The beer is very dark and has a nice dark chocolate milk colored head. A little disappointed on the aroma  and flavor this beer had no Bourbon barrel  aroma or flavor, if they had left out the name than bourbon barrel i would not have cared. The beer is delicious but when you put something in the name it leads the consumer to expect it. I did get a little bit of vanilla but no Bourbon notes, so maybe it did do some time in some oak. Great beer but disappointed on the Bourbon thing. The bar charged alot for this beer that doesn't even have hops  in it and didn't taste like it spent doing any hard time."
""
"I am glad I tried it. Easy to drink smooth as others have said a little thin for a stout. Had on tap. Slight ring of foam.  I was expecting something more."
""
"Leaves you feeling like it is missing something -"
""
"Great stout, full bodied and deliciously smooth"
"Were there rankings higher,  I would use them!"
"I think this whole effect would be better served by taking a shot of whiskey and dropping it in a stout. Duh. Then you would have some extra kick too. I'm going to try that some time soon."

""

""

"This is 2nd time I've had this from tap and was hoping it would change my mind, but it's very thin, hardly any BB smell or taste... drinks more like a porter, decent but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Incredibly smooth, great French vanilla flavor and perfect mouthfeel. Wasn't too hard to finish the bottle."
"Doesn't live up to mid level bourbon beers out there."
""
"Pour is black with a lot of tan head, a good bit of bubbles, and a lot of lacing.  Nose has some scorched wood, moderate bourbon notes, light roasted malt.  Taste is a bit thin, barrel fades in flavor, some chocolaty malt, a touch chalky, light vanilla.  Body is a touch thin, soft carb, soft and creamy feel."
""

"Tobacco overwhelms everything.  On the dry side."
"Chocolate and vanilla and a little cooked sugar for good measure on both the tongue and nose as expected with a barrel aged stout.  Not as much alcohol as I expected from a Turkey-barrel-aged beer so it lacks a little of the typical warmth but I don't really miss it here.  It is an exceedingly pleasant brew that I feel would be a great introduction to the breed.  It is not the heavier, fuller bodied, more potent example I can sip on for an entire football game but it can be nursed for a really good half!  As a matter of fact, buy 2 and make it a full game you can enjoy win or lose.  Perfect for the cool winter evenings of the South since it isn't quite as heavy as expected.  Worthy of a purchase for sure."

"Wow! This is an incredibly complex beer that manages to unite two of my favorite beverages. The nose is heavy on vanilla with a hint of cocoa. A mouthful of this beer starts with the appropriate stout dark malts and moves to a very enjoyable bourbon finish. The undertones of oak, milk chocolate and coffee combine to create a very unique taste experience. This is easily one of the best beers I've tasted in the last year."
"More bba than beer"
""
""
""
""
"Cant stand Wild turkey so I was skeptical, however this beer hit all the right notes for me.  Bourbon ties perfectly with the Blarney Flats body and flavor.  That's some Bahl Hornin!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich, flavor able, full bodied. Complex bourbon, malt flavor works really well"
""
""

"overall: There are just way too many bourbon barrel aged beers to waste your time on this one. If this is your first and you like it, all the others are better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste:  Some bitterness up front.  Light mouthfeel for a stout.  Carbonation is well balanced but watered down.  Light vanilla, and toffee with a very faint hint of alcohol hotness at the end."
"Poured a darker black. This beer smells absolutely delicious. Smells of bourbon and vanilla. You can smell it as soon as you crack the bottle open. I was expecting more in the taste department. It is a smooth beer. Bourbon and vanilla dominate the taste. It almost tastes watered down though. Most Bourbon barrel stouts are over the top and a bomber will knock you off your feet. At first I didn't like this one because it wasn't that. By the end of the bomber though it won me over."

"Overall: Much like their Pinchy Jeek Barl effort, the bourbon barrels really dominate everything about the beer."

"O: I am a big fan of Anderson Valley and their oatmeal stout. This one may surpass it as my favorite stout they make. Really great flavor combination and the bourbon is used in a way that isn't overpowering, but really compliments the chocolate, toffee, caramel mix. Under 7% alcohol as well so this is an incredibly sessionable beer that won't weigh you down like traditional Imperial Stouts or BB Stouts. Very impressed."
""
"Not real often you come across a barrel aged stout that's comes in under 7% abv but carries this much flavor and mouthfeel! I love it. Not a huge wild turkey fan myself, and the specific character of the whiskey comes through a lot in this beer, but it seems to work. Frothy look, soft grayish brown head on a dark chocolate colored body with good viscosity and so e clinging density. Nose is whiskey first, thin vanilla and booze, with sweet oak, milk chocolate, and derived fruit, maybe raisin leading the way in the flavor. Oats might froth this up a little, chocolate malt is robust, and the oak is long lasting in the finish. It's great because all the booze and body of the huge imperials is here, right there to enjoy from first sip, but it never gets hit and heavy, allowing me to consume way more of this than I could some imperial. Props to Anderson valley for putting this one together, it's perfect this time of year! A touch of acidity in the finish is my only complaint"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would describe this as a very sessionable Bourbon.  Maybe not what I would expect from a stout, but on the whole a very enjoyable drink."
""
""
""
""
"AMAZING stout, if you're a fan of bourbon, or a fan of the rich malty stout, this is the one for you, pours thick and black with a dark head."
""
""
""
"Dark chestnut colored with a beige head that sizzles as it rises up, and recedes quickly.  Low aroma of bourbon and dark malt.  Rich flavor of darkly toasted malt, not roasty.  Subtle woody notes, bourbon hints, and vanilla.  bourbon is understated.  No hop flavor, but firm bitterness offsets the malt.  Somewhat thin body, dry and talcy, a carbonation tingle finishes.  Woody notes linger.  Good, but not great."
""
""
""
"This one was difficult to rate. Many bourbon barrel stouts are so high on the ABV there is a lot more going on. This one is smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel. The barrel notes do shine through and mix well with the already sweet taste. I like this beer but it's not amazing. Something I might drink as a stout I can have a handful of. Worth giving a try"
""
"Overall I thought this beer was ok at best and I thought it was a very average example of a Bourbon Barrel aged Stout, the stout base was thin, watery and not to flavorful and it got overpowered by the bourbon.  This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't too smooth, crisp, a little watery, not filling and the taste couldn't hold my attention, one glass was more than enough for me, a whole bottle would be too much.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance, I thought it was a pretty nice looking beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the balance, it wasn't good and the stout base needed to be beefed up a little to balance out all those boozy bourbon flavors.  I wouldn't buy this beer again and I wouldn't recommend it, I just don't think it's a good example of the style.  All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer and in the end it left me wanting a lot more out of the stout base, I thought it was odd that a beer under 7% feltso boozy.  So far this is now my least favorite beer from Anderson valley and it's on the lower end of the scale as far as the style goes.  I appreciate the effort, but this beer needs some work, better luck next time guys."

"This pours a cola color with cocoa foam. I found it had a somewhat prominent, albeit light, rootbeer aroma and a muddled bourbon and rootbeer aftertaste. Thin mouthfeel for what it promises."

"22oz bottle served in pint glass.  Beer pours very dark brown in color, with an oily slickness to it, and forms a large dark brown head, with pillowy foam.  Aroma is not particularly roasty, hoppy, or otherwise beery, but is distinctly of oaky bourbon.  Flavor is like sipping fine bourbon.  Creamy, smooth, low alcohol / zero burn bourbon.  As a stout, this is pretty unremarkable, and fulfills the requirement perfunctorily with the right color.  But as a vehicle for sweet vanilla oak barrel flavor, this is quite a lot of fun."

"Smell is super barrely. Light bodied. Chocolatey, lightly smoky. Tasty."

"Very creamy body, medium full, very fine soft carbonation, above average."
""
""
""
""
"o At first not quite as bourbon dominated as the aroma and initial taste suggested.   Easy drinking.  The light mouthfeel at first distracts a bit from the drinking experience, but the persistent bourbon flavor grows more enjoyable to the point you don't mind iof the mouthfeel is light."
""
"Pours out a beautiful black color with a tan head that quickly retreats to a thin but lasting lace.  The aroma is coffee and chocolate and the taste is dominated by dark chocolate.  Not much bourbon flavor considering how flavorful Wild Turkey Bourbon is.  The mouthfeel is very smooth with low but sufficient carbonation.  Overall a decent entry."
"On tap at Brews Brothers. Mild aroma of chocolate and bourbon. Nice dark color. Has a slightly carbonated taste similar to Coke. Can tell it is wild turkey. Really has that alcohol taste. All right beer. Prefer some of the barrel aged beers in the great lakes region more."
"Overall:  This is a good, solid bourbon-barrel aged stout, but not a great one.  There are some good flavors of malt and sweetness and some bourbon too, but it’s not as strong as some other, better, bourbon barrel-aged stouts out there.  Still, it’s worth a drink when you want a bourbon barrel-aged stout but don’t want to get a full buzz or drunk on!"

"I really like this beer, one of my favorites. Strong and sorta smooth at the same time. Nice aroma and the aftertaste is bourbony. LOVE IT! Their pumpkin variation is incredibly good too btw."

"On tap at Empire Slice House OKC. Pours a dark brown with a finger of creamy mocha head that recedes quickly. The tap is pretty cold, so there's not a lot of aroma. You can definitely smell the bourbon, some chocolate and coffee. The bourbon predominates the taste, and is a bit much. Some dark chocolate and red plums sneak their way in. Really, really boozy. Medium mouth, but not a lot of oil. The aftertaste disappears quickly. Did I mention it's a bourbon first brew? It really loses any sense of balance as it warms. I'm not likely to revisit this one soon."
"On draught at Kraftwork in Fishtown. Great initial smell and taste, but taste subsides just a bit."

"O- this beer adds to my suspicion that low abv stouts and bourbon don't mix. Velvet merkin was better but not by a significant margin. Basically the beer itself acts mostly a conduit for the bourbon flavor. And whatever flavor the beer does have doesn't mesh terribly well with the bourbon.  Gotta give them credit for shooting for a low abv BA stout at a reasonable price, but just doesn't get there.  [Edit: got a bit better at room temp, but still closer to  mediocre.]"

"Export version from the Netherlands; bottle simply reads ""Bourbon Barrel Stout"" without a mention of Wild Turkey, contains the same alcohol content, and a different background image of what looks like a bear. I believe this is the same beer though. Bought a bomber bottle of this from Tanakaya in Mejiro, Tokyo, Japan. Poured into a pint class. Awesome chocolate foam and a thick, wonderful mouthfeel to this, but it really lets me down as far as ""bourbon barrel stouts"" go. There was not much in the nose to excite, and while the taste was pleasant, I was hoping for more. I enjoyed this beer, but it would not make my top rankings of barrel-aged stouts."

"I picked up a case for the restaurant that I work for after going to a trade show where AVBC was showing this off. At first I was kind of dismissive because there are a lot of these Bourbon Barrel Stouts showing up and i just logged it away with another one trick pony like some of the rest. So I visited a few other tables and then found myself standing back in front of this display, so I gave in. The nose was all Wild Turkey, that sweet, warm, toasty smell. I fully prepared myself for the same on the palate and was so delighted to have this delicious, delightfully bitter stout greet my taste buds. the finish is long and that is where the Wild Turkey showed up again. I am usually more open minded to beer and I immediately kicked myself for initially passing this one over. So I would say overall this a joy of a brew that I immediately ordered so that I had it available for myself whenever I want it."

"It's a good beer, but very bland indeed. I have had trader joe's stout that had better/intense aroma and flavor than this beer. The smell is aromatic, but not at the same level as other barrel stouts I have tried. I will give this beer a try again to make sure that this review I am posting is sane and by no means I was biased in this review."

"A great beer, just needs to be a little thicker/richer. Flavors are awesome ... the bourbon notes really stand out, both in taste and smell. It pours beautifully ... nice color and wonderfully formed head. It just seems like it should be stronger/starker."

"O: A perfectly acceptable beer, especially given the availability and reasonable price range. However, certainly fails when held to the high standards of other barrel-aged stouts out there. Worth a try for sure, and a good option if you're at a bar with limited choices on tap. Nothing I'd go far out of my way for, however."
"This beer is deceptive in many ways as it looks like it’s going to be this bad ass stout with a Wild Turkey kick, but then it hits you like a pillow, with soft complex flavors that come through a very light body and highlight the bourbon complexities without being obnoxiously in your face and overpowering. My friend Chris told me this was a great beer and he suggested that I try it, and I must say that I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was much easier to drink than I expected and the low ABV to me added to the overall experience and made this a very solid brew."
""
""
""
""
"This is not the most complex bourbon barrel aged stout I've ever had, but it's tasty, and drinkable, and doesn't fatigue you like some of the big boys do."
"An above average stout, but not great. The attempt was great but it wasn’t quite as balanced as it should have been."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a session Bourbon Barrel Stout for me... Good for when you need that kick but don't want to fully commit."
"Overall: The brew is not very complex. no real depth. the only thing going for the brew is that you could taste the wild turkey"

"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter. The smell of this beer is more complex than the taste. Taste is dominated by black licorice from begining to end. When I say dominated I mean it. I had trouble pulling any other tastes from this brew. The smell however was really nice with chocolate,brown sugar, toffee, and maybe a hint of mocha. The taste just really let me down with how one dimentional it was. Beer tastes stronger than the listed alcohol content of 6.3%.Not a great beer IMO, but not horrible either. Don't plan to buy again. Do have a Anderson Bourbon Barrel Amber that I hope wil be better."

"O:It is nice to be able to get this any time, but it is a last resort BA stout. The combination of heat, booze, and thin feel is not good. The dark roasted malts and coffee notes are noteworthy. There is a reason the successful BA stouts are crafted in small batches with careful attention. I get the impression this ale is mass produced with little attention to detail."

"O - Quite a contrast from the Enjoy By I had earlier. Some might not like the upfront bourbon taste or the sweetness, but I think this is extremely close to pulling it off. It reminds me of the home brew my cousin used to make with Crown. You know the Crown was there, and it added positively to beer. A touch more ""heft"" in the stout department would be a great addition."
"Overall a nice very tasty beer. Low alcohol for the beer style."

"22 picked up at cap market in salem. wild turkey on the label suggests someone might be paying attention to this one . . . maybe a bit, but not enough. pours well, mild foam, a bit of decent lacing, ring of foam throughout the rest of the glass. color's a nice dark molasses/caramel. nose is cocoa, bit of raisin, a bit boozy (mind you, it's only 6.9%). taste is ok, nothing to write home about, but not bad either, though a bit on the thin side. bit of cocoa, leather, but for 6.9 it seems kind of a bit much on the bourbon, a bit more than i'd expect. i'd rather have some nuanced characteristics, but it just comes across as basic. again, nothing really wrong, but nothing to warrant a second glass, especially at $10 for a bomber."

"Pours black with some reddening around the edges and a persistent two fingers of light brown head. On the nose I get woodsy vanilla, caramel, and chocolate with an alcohol aroma, which is surprising given that it's only 6.9 % ABV. There's a roasted malt quality as well. All these flavors are stretched thin in the taste: here there is relatively little malt presence. It's bourbon forward with a dry cocoa powder and vanilla flavor. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and it finishes with a moderate hop bitterness."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- the bourbon was more prominent than I expected, given the low ABV, however I think the base beer struggled to match up with the other barrel flavors. Still, very drinkable for a BBA stout"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich and chocolatey. Starts off innocently, but there's a strong fudge kick in the swallow. The aftertaste reminds me of an after dinner chocolate. i do not taste the whiskey I smelled earlier. The body is thick and the carbonation low. It's a bit like drinking a carbonated, chilled hot cocoa."
""
""
"On tap at Yardhouse, I think a pint was $7. Looks like your typical stout: black. Head was decent and tan in color. Aroma was a nice bourbon, thick with hints of stout. Flavor was above average, heavy bourbon with roasted malts but it felt too thin. I ordered thus thinking it was Huge Arker and was a little disappointed. I think bourbon barrels are great for beer but the base beer needs to be pretty big to stand up to it, lower ABV beers are just too watery."

"A super dark brown in color with a thin tan head. Aromas of vanilla and charred oak. Taste begins with some sweet grain, then some oak, after that is some vanilla. A hint of earthy bitterness in the finish. Mouth feel is a little light, but not too bad. Overall quite good. Not as rich as some bourbon barrel stouts, but not as high alcohol either. I will definitely get it again."

""
""
""

"Pours and off very very deep opaquer brown with creamy tan head that held well. Thin collar. Aroma is some dark chocolate, vanilla and caramel sweetness. Taste is much the same with no noticeable bourbon or oak presence until the very end. Creamy mouthfeel with low carbonation and a body just on the thin side of thick."
"This is my third Anderson Valley review, had this on tap at the Village Anchor. Outstanding, almost definitely the best beer of this kind that I've had. Heavy smoke, brown sugar, and, of course, bourbon flavor. Incredible bourbon and coffee aroma. If you like bourbon ales, I can't think if anything better on a chilly night. Only drawback is the price. Usually I don't invest this much for a beer, but this time it might've been worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Aroma is strange to me for the style. Lots of vanilla, caramel, toffee on the nose. Poured jet black with an inch thick light tan head that dissipated quickly. Taste is exactly like the nose, vanilla, caramel, toffee. Didn’t get much roasted malt and seemed a little light for a stout. Finish just drops out. Decent but not my favorite."

""
""

"the barrel treatment is obvious but there is no there there, meaning there is no depth here, just kind of falls flat. is it bad ? no, not by any means, and in fact this might be great with certain food pairings but overall it seems lacking"

"Overall - a really good beer that proves you don't have to turn the glass of beer into a 12% hot bourbon drink. It maintains its beer character very well alongside the bourbon, one of the better blends I've seen under 8%."

""
""

"A very well-done stout with the creamy, dark grain and malt sweetness character shining throughout. Well-balanced and nicely complex while keeping a respectably low ABV; not necessarily a session brew but could just about make the cut. Most of the whiskey barrel notes come through in the aroma while letting the malt flavors do the talking in the overall taste. Very satisfying..."
""
""
"Overall - This beer is amazing, drinks so easy while packing a huge amount of taste. Bourbon and chocolate roasted into a delicious stout. The finish has a dry taste of bourbon and chocolate making you want more and more of this wonderful stout. This is by and far one of the most drinkable stouts I've had."

"overall: my 1st Anderson Valley beer and I am not overly impressed. This is a 'lite' stout and is lacking in body and oomph."

"Overall, this beer has a lot going for it but I feel like it just lacks the body to be great. Everything starts out good but kind of craps out midway through. I would get this again, though."
"Just seems a bit faint in both the aroma and taste. Well balanced but nothing really jumps out on the palate to carry the beer forward. Gets better with warmth and time but never really reaches that high. There are just too many good Bourbon stouts out there I suppose."

"O - First impression is this is more like a mildly barrel aged porter. Enjoyable but doesn't knock it out of the park. It's got some nice flavors for a 7% brew but I think I'd rather have their Oatmeal Stout. Of interest, my wife liked this more than me particularly because it was lighter flavored and had a lower ABV. While I was looking for MORE, she liked the simpler, lighter bourbon stout flavors on display with this brew."

"Taste: Boom, boom, there it is: thickness and richness of the bourbon barrels all over the palate. Plump and full and ending a bit on the dry side. And there's the cherry, there's the vanilla, there's the roast and the toast. Mmmm. Not quite so full bodied, pretty much medium-ish….lots of tastiness. Easy-drinking. Not too strong, this one. Lot of bourbon barrel beers are imperial stouts, this one is regular stout. And it's awfully nice."

"O- Interesting take on the bourbon barrel aged stout. I'd say go boozier on the ABV and you got yourself a nicely balanced imperial. As it...amazing."
"Bourbon flavor seems slightly too subtle. The smell is actually deceiving for what you get for taste. Unusually thin with perhaps slightly too much bitterness in the finish for its lack of more intense flavors. Nothing in particular stands out to make you say ""wow"". I'm relatively new to this type of beer but perhaps have been spoiled by higher rated ones. It's a beer I'd recommend trying for the sake of trying it (after all, it's subjective) but nothing to rave about. Not a bourbon stout that improves as it warms. I felt as though I needed to drink the full glass before it warmed , vs other beers in this category which improved as they warmed and breathed and literally lasted 1-2 hrs for 12 oz. Other bourbon stouts seem to encourage continual tastes to decipher the full complexity of the beer, whereas this seems like a stout one would drink for the sake of drinking a stout while attention is aimed elsewhere. Not bad, but not great"

"Near jet black, 1.5 fingers of tan head, some lace as well. Smell is roasted with chocolate, some bourbon and oak, mild vanilla as well, a bit of fudge and lightly astringent but not unpleasant. Taste is lightly roasted, chocolate and vanilla, oak is light with a bit of bourbon mid palate, vanilla-oaky finish. Medium carbonation, fairly thin body as well. Not bad in terms of flavour but the thin points of this leaves a bit to be desired though."
"It's somewhat of a mess and I can't understand why they'd attempt this with such a light and carbonated base beer."

"And it tastes like bourbon. This beer is a little on the mild side, at 6.9% meaning that it just gets bulldozed by the barrel-aging. Now if you're a barrel-aged nut who is all about their beer tasting like bourbon, this is a great beer. If you look to barrel-aging to add complexity to already intense ales, look elsewhere as this is a mild stout bourbonized."

"Poured from bottle into chalice. Deep black color with really nice airy foamy tan head. lots of roasted malt aromas and hints of chocolate. Similar flavor...roasted malt and a lot of chocolate flavor with a hint of vanilla. Only a slight note of bourbon, but that may be the vanilla I taste. I think the best quality of this brew is how smooth it is. Its silky, creamy, and so easy to drink. Really a nice stout...although walking the line of imperial, its nice to get such a good quality semi-low abv American Stout. Well worth a try."

"O: Overall really liked the Wild Turkey burbon barrel influence here, a burbon i am highly familar with from my youth straight from the bottle. Smooth spiciness, sweet caramel cream, thought the stout portion comes off a bit light bodied and seems a bit underweight per class like a feather weight boxer to a heavy weight. This is not going to be your typical huge BA stout to the likes of dark lord, Black hole, insert any other BA stout to your liking here, rather this seems like an easy and sweet milk stout with gentle burbon highlights perfect for that causual drinking in multiples despite its 6.9%abv which seems perfect here. I really enjoyed the gentle and sweet drinking nature it had to offer, showing not every BA stout has to be a malt monster and soaked with alcohol, this does nicely as a causual drinker and something i would consider multiples in with good company."

"OVERALL: I guess for the relatively low ABV, this is alright. In the grand scheme of things, however, it's pretty uneventful and underwhelming.

"Poured into a chalice a very nice dark brown color, nice carbonaiton, with a nice small fizzy tan head, which leaves a HUGE oil slick in the middle of the glass, some nice sticky lacing as well. The nose is malty, with some very nice chocolate, coffee, and toffee notes. A little vanilla note also. The taste is slightly sweet, bitter, and malty. Lots of dark notes thrown in with some roastyness, a slight bourbon note. Medium body. Overall a very tasty brew, a nice stout with a bourbon note thrown in, glad to see it here in Utah, would definitely recommend."

"Tops off past a finger of very dark brown foam, mix of all bubble sizes and simmers down to the surface quickly, weak lacing left behind. The liquid is a thick, impenetrable black, vague tint of yellow at the rims and surface, you can see a few tiny bubbles here and there. The bourbon comes through easily in the nose, caramel, vanilla and butter, light plum fruit with a vestige of prune but it mostly surprises you for the lack of anything happening, no real roastiness, no hops, just the sweet oak and some fruit and chocolate. Medium-bodied, creamy and soft, the carbonation is moderate and makes things even fluffier. Does have some tingle, maybe from the barrel toast yet still not close to full on roast/toast. Cola, vanilla, chocolate, at many times tastes like Dr. Pepper’s. The lack of body evident through the finish as it trails off, can’t say it is trying to end cleanly. The barrel treatment much more evident in the nose. You don’t get much fruitiness here, notch up of nuttiness. You keep waiting for it to kick in and it really never does."
""
"Pours a very dark brown almost black hue with a creamy head and lacing everywhere,the nose is mostly wild turkey with subtle hints of chocolate and coffee,the mouthfeel is medium bodied,moderately carbonated and warming with that turkey first on the forefront but to my satisfaction the ageing does not totally dominate and the base beer is allowed some time to shine with chocolate,coffee and oatmeal and right at the finish the base beer and barrel intertwine for a mix of hoppy bitterness with bourbon heat and overall it's a nice drop and the ageing adds another element that the base beer lacks cheers."
"Anderson Valley Bourbon Barrel Stout ---4/5."

"(O)- A superb stout with a welcomed lower ABV drinkability to it in a sea of big monster 15%+ stouts. I am actually a big fan of when the bourbon shows big in stouts, but the subtleties of this one are fantastic. Easily one of the better american stouts I have had over the years."
""
"lighter than most in this category, I get some sweet first, and some bitter at the finish. in the middle I get a lighter variation of the roasted malts, maybe some burnt chocolate. vanilla. very smooth. the more I taste this the more I like it. perhaps the lighter-than-most abv allows the smoother-than-most taste from this one. I have found most Anderson Valley brews to be very much above average and this one is a tad better than that. not world class, but excellent."

"The body was much thinner than I expect in the style, this felt more like a light Porter. Drinkability was excellent, my glass disappeared quickly, and I think there'll be another in my future.

I'm not here to brag, I'm here to drink a good beer, and this really is a good beer. I finished wanting another, which is rare for a 22 oz. bottle; usually one 12 oz. is all I have in a night. I recommend!"

"22 ounce bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but it a recent release. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, oak, clove, toffee, toast, dark bread, vanilla, bourbon, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and barrel character; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, toffee, light oak, light bourbon, vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, toffee, light oak, light bourbon, vanilla, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of roasted/bready malts with a light barrel presence; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good barrel aged stout. Nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with a light barrel presence; and very smooth to drink. I was looking for more barrel character in the taste; but otherwise a nicely enjoyable stout."

"Excellent brew! Poured at a good temperature with a thick, foamy, tan head that settled after a bit and some lace. Color is an almost opaque, but clear, cherry tinted brown. Aroma is roast malt, cocoa, whiskey, vanilla, caramel, hint of molasses. Flavor's like nose, starts more like stout with a hint of whiskey, then the whiskey really comes out strong to a point that's perhaps a tad too much. Carbonic tang is up front followed immediately with malt sweet, then some bitter at the end. Body/carbonation are very good, tho the whiskey throws the balance a smidgen. Finish is like flavor, the whiskey makes it long. Probably only have this one bomber. Be a good one to share."

"Was waiting a long time to try this one. Pours jet black. There is definetly some nice bourbon oakey notes in the nose, not very over bearing though. Overall taste is what i excpeted an amped up version of anderson Valley's already awesome oatmeal stout. A fair ammount of vanilla, along with a nice oakey smoke flavors. Its a really chewey chunky oatmeal mouth texture to it which I really enjoy. Great to have a BA stout that won't beat you over the head with the ABV or break the bank!"

"Anderson Valley is a good name in beer but this is a miss. Disappointing as bourbon barrel aged stouts go and generally as craft beer goes. It's meh, it's almost OK, but it's not at all memorable. It's mild and round and has no real distinguishing character except for a bit of wood taste which isn't particularly good. It is lacking in substance and almost tastes diluted. Almost has a touch of that taste from the bottom of a glass of cola with ice when the cola has been watered down by all of the melted ice. And it's a diet cola at that. And I think that's actually the bourbon taste trying to come through, which doesn't speak well for the bourbon. It has kind of a cheap taste, yet costs plenty. Smells decent, with a nice chocolate frosting note. Smooth. It would be interesting to know what they were going for with this beer. Would not by again. Would not recommend. Needs to go back to the drawing board."

"There's a good beer here but two things fail it. One, a lack of body and, two, a lack of real barrel character. Close but no cigar."

"I am not a stout drinker at all, but the thought of chocolate in a bourbon barrel was intriguing, and what a bad thing it would have been if I hadn't tried this delicious brew! I keep hoping someone else will have it on tap, when it is, I am gonna buy a couple of growlers, and believe me, they won't last!"
""
"0- Overall a really drinkable bourbon stout. Most Bourbon stouts are very high ABV and you can only have 1 or 2. This is quite sessionable at 6.9%, however if you may want to begin your session with dessert, since this beer definitely has a sweetness to it."

"I love Anderson Valley's canned oatmeal stout so when I saw they did a barrel aged stout I was sold. Pours pitch black into my chalice with at least four fingers of tan head, even spread lacing. I like how they kept the abv pretty modest compared to some of the other bourbon barrel aged beers. The nose is beautiful a kiss of bourbon amongst a nice creamy dark chocolate back drop, hints of vanilla and charred oak complement the dark roasted barley in the stout. Flavor develops nicely with each sip expressing more Wild Turkey bourbon characteristics especially the smooth boozy vanilla and charred oak expressions tucked into a glorious dark roasted malt and mild herbal hopped stout, flavors I'm getting are dark chocolate bitter and dry, with a creamy vanilla center it's man candy in the realm of barrel aged stouts. Mouthfeel a bit lighter than expected but the warmth of the whiskey comes through a medium bodied stout mild carbonation albeit natural feeling and smooth going down. Alcohol burns the palate minimally at 6.9% it's a 22 ounce bottle that your liver doesn't mind finishing on it's own. Overall an impressive complex and approachable barrel aged stout I would drink this again and I know it's not too over the top to introduce bud drinking friends who enjoy whiskey. This could convert your friends into craft beer and I can tell it's going to pair great with my AJ Fernandez blended San Lotano Habano Toro cigar I'm about to toast up. Pairing with the San Lotano, the spicy Nicaraugan tobacco goes great with this flavorful stout actually bringing out more whiskey flavors! Leather and oak from the well aged tobacco also complement the flavor profile of this stout, if you try this beer do yourself a favor and pair it with a hand rolled cigar."

"D/O: This beer represents the relatively uncommon practice of barrel-aging a normal gravity porter-style ale. Not surprisingly it is reminiscent of barrel-aged Black Marlin Porter by Ballast Point, yet falls short of that other beer due to a less well-established malt base. It does yield many transformative qualities indicative of the spirit and the wood, but its runaway acidity also leaves the palate feeling nearly scorched."
""
"O: I wasn't sure what to expect with such a relatively weak BBA stout, but I was pleasantly surprised. Certainly not as flavor-rich as the heavier stouts in the category, but overall it was a pleasant beer that was very drinkable, like a BBA Stout - Lite. I had it from a 22oz bomber and felt like I could finish the whole thing. I wish the bourbon was a bit more prominent, perhaps to cover the aftertaste. I'd buy it again since it has some complexity, but not as alcoholic as the high-gravity beers."

"Reviews for this beer are kinda silly. Just because it's not super thick and strong doesn't mean this isn't a great bourbon barrel stout. The taste has an extremely well integrated bourbon flavor which wonderfully mingles with the base stout. Strong vanilla and oak tones, extremely tasty, very drinkable."
"OVERALL: Tasty brew, really like what the barrel did to this one. Subtlety works in this genre, let the barrel shine. I must admit, I really enjoy Wild Turkey, so this beer delivered a great 2 in 1."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch frothy tan head that stayed around for a while. There's also a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and a bit of dark fruit. It tastes like roasted/charred malt, bittersweet and milk chocolate, coffee, vanilla and bourbon. The bourbon character in both the aroma and taste is light, but still noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's thin for a stout. It has moderate carbonation, and goes down easy enough. I'm a little disappointed that the bourbon in this brew isn't stronger, but it's still a decent beer overall. With that being said, I wouldn't pay $11.99 a bottle for this again."

"When the label says ""Bourbon Barrel Stout"" I am looking for some serious flavors but this did not deliver in that regard. Closer to a brown ale than a stout IMO and had no bourbon to be found anywhere. Still this could make an excellent desert beer or a beer for a lighter palate who doesn't like a lot of roast or bourbon in their beer."

"O: This was one of the more boring beers I have had in the last couple of years. One of AV's poorer beers -- I think this is an attempt to lighten up a beer that I don't think really can be light -- it needs the big imperial stout dark maltiness to work with the whiskey character. Without it, they both feel off. I would definitely skip this one, especially at the unbelievable price point."
""
"O: guess I expected more than what I got - a little too thin feeling and not a very strongly flavored beer - felt closer to a porter than a stout - and the bourbon barrel aging dried it out a bit too much for my tastes."

"O - Definitely the lowest ABV if seen on a Bourbon Barrel Aged brew. Is it the most flavorful smack in the face? No, not at all. But its still got great, balanced flavor, an incredibly smooth drinkability and a hint of that bourbony deliciousness we all know and love."
"Much lighter than most Bourbon Barrel Stouts, this makes an easy drinker. However, at $13 a bottle the quality is surely questionable."
"O: good flavors and a decent balance, not a lot of barrel character but it allows the other flavors to shine a bit more. it's more of a supporting role than dominant flavor. inoffensive and quite drinkable."
"Overall, this is a good stout, not my personal favorite, but complex. Fans of bourbon barrel aged stouts should give this a try."

"Pours black with a big creamy fluffy light mocha head. Aroma is dark fruits and booze, maybe a bit of chocolate. Bit of vomit smell, blegh. Thin mouthfeel. Sweet malta and candy feuits mixed with alcohol flavor. These non-imperial stouts and porters with the bourbon just don't do it for me. Thin, alcoholic, and no complexity. Just tastes like booze, but without much booze. Meh."
"Pours midnight black with a generous finger of foam. Retention could be better, good lacing though. No visibility or carbonation. Smells of bourbon, oak, coffee, chocolate, cherry, some vanilla, rigid malts, and some alcohol. Not the most complex, but some definite activity going on here. Taste comes up pretty short, though. The bourbon is a bit perpendicular to the rest of the taste which comes and goes pretty quick, a flash of flavor- coffee, chocolate, oak, bourbon is quickly ended by the after taste of malt, bourbon, and oak. Feel is the lowest part, it's strange how this washes over the palate, flavor changes quickly but isn't enjoyable. Not the most drinkable. Overall this would be a lot better executed with an imperial stout. The stout simply isn't strong enough to stand up to the bourbon, and the beer is for naught"
""
""
"Another one shared by a friend last night. Poured into a snifter. Pours a deep black with a thick tan head. The nose is pretty weak, as I'm not getting much bourbon at all. Slightly sweet aroma of vanilla, but this is really underwhelming. Decent feel. Creamy and smooth. Velvety texture. The flavor is a bit of a disappointment as well. I'm getting little bourbon and vanilla notes. Mild oak dryness, some chocolate malt present. This beer is just sort of blah. Not much going on. Glad I didn't pay for a bottle. Thanks anyways for the pour, Jacob."

"Overall: I was impressed with the oakiness of this beer at first, but unfortunately the taste did not carry all the way through this beer.

Not quite what I would call good, but certainly one of the better brews from Anderdon Valley."

"Nope, this doesn't work for me. In fact, this beer probably explains why my experience with bourbon barrel stouts has to date been only Imperial versions. The bourbon doesn't do anything for this beer, and in fact probably harms it. It takes over the stout, without providing much good characters itself. The flavours are assertive, but they just don't work for me."

"No where near worth the $12 I paid for it here in NC. Not quite as nice as their regular oatmeal stout either."
""
"If Wild Turkey was indeed the barrel for this particular aging project, that would go a long way in explaining the big up-front Bourbon essence, followed by the drop-off, which here, at least, is picked up by the heady malt of the base stout. Sans beer, that effect is typically unpleasant as a hungry croc, as Wild Turkey is rather unappealing on its own. Nice to see it actually used for good."

"O: It's hard to make a bourbon barrel beer work in a smaller beer, and while this beer has it's moments, it's just OK in the end. The bomber price at $9.79 is crazy."

"Low B+"
"Interesting but lacking depth. Thin and lackluster. Seems like they barreled a beer that wasn't quite up to the task. There are plenty of other far better barrel aged stouts available for the money."

"Bottled version...different from the keg version (at least as far as ABV is concerned). Pours a beautiful dark black color with a medium-large, frothy tan head that disappears rather quickly. A good-lookin beer. Scent is lacking a bit... a little on the light side. Mellow bourbon flavors with sweet chocolate and hints of vanilla. Some nuttiness and dark malt aromas. Hoping the flavors are a bit more aggressive. They sure are! I mean, as aggressive as a 6.9% bourbon barrel aged stout can be. Lovely barrel flavors...definitely pick up the bourbon. Still has the characteristics of an easy-drinking, sessionable stout...but with much more complexity due to barrel aging. Nice coffee flavors with a bit of toffee and vanilla. Somewhat dry, malty finish. Tasty and enjoyable from first sip to the last. Mouthfeel is lacking a bit. Could be more heavy, as this one is light and creamy...almost like Guinness on nitro, but less watery. Drinkability is high. This beer and the bourbon barrel aged nut brown ale I had from Alesmith are part of the beginning of a new craze in craft beer. I really enjoy these low ABV bourbon barrel aged beers, because you get to enjoy a good amount of it without becoming completely intoxicated, yet you obtain those tasty bourbon, vanilla, and oak notes. Win-win. Solid beer. Haven't had the lower ABV draft version, but this one is quite enjoyable."

"The taste is even stronger coconut with hints of vanilla. The graham crackery end lends to a breadiness or maltiness. Very low in ABV it is my fear that the lack of malts lends to a watery taste and feel near the end of the swallow. Overall this is a thoroughly enjoyable and another fine entry from A Valley!"

"D - very nice overall. Abv not heavy, helps make it almost sessionable. Worth seeking it out."
""
"O: This beer feels much bigger than it actually is and makes you want to sip it very slowly, having only a small serving - impressive to have the depth of flavor and bourbon-ness without huge ABV."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tulip, the beer is a dark-brown coloring with ruby highlights and a tall, dense, foamy, light tan head. The nose is layered, with grainy sweet aromas highlighted by a boozey, spicy, bourbon scent. Flavors of vanilla and spice, with an oaky overtone and a slow build of bourbon characteristics. There is a roasty and coffee backbone throughout. Rye and boozey aftertaste with a low profile that keeps the drinkability up. Smooth, toasty finish. Very strong brew with building characteristics. As a fan of bourbon and beer, I am digging on this brew."

"Overall: Uneven but pleasant, and certainly not bad for a regular stout in barrels. Drinks easy. My first of this kind and also my first barrel-aged brew from Anderson Valley. Would try again."
""
""
"This is a nice beer, but it seems that the barrels imparted a far bigger flavor than the base beer. If I had to rate each flavor separately I'd give the Wild Turkey an A and the base stout a B. The base beer just needs a bolder flavor to stand up to the barrel aging. Overall, though this is definitely a good stout and one that is well worth trying."
""
"Overall-this is nothing more than a bourbon beer, I can hardly tast the base beer in this. The barrel characters just devour the oatmeal stout. If your not into bourbon this is not the beer for you. That being said, I'm into bourbon and this beer is killer. Very drinkable and at a smaller ABV than most barrel aged beers it's totally sessionable. It's not as complex as most other barrel beers but what it lacks in complexity it makes up with drinkability. 4.5"
""
"Overall, the best thing about this beer was the nice bourbon flavoring and rich woodiness in both the aroma and the nose. The nice thing about this was that they came with sole flavoring, without any overpowering burn, and excessive depth of musky agedness. Each component was strong, with a certain cleanliness to delineate each from the next. The lower abv also contributes to this guy being a considerably sessionable stout. At times, however, the sweetness does get up there, and make this beer seem a bit “young”, but regardless this is a refreshing offering from Anderson Valley."

" The taste is great with the aforementioned raisiny yeast fruitiness and slight cocoa blending with the bourbon's sweet and woody elements that have a mild dark malt synergy and subtle toasted taste. Overall I enjoyed this a lot, it was enjoyable and I am glad I got the chance to try it. I would order it again because the original oatmeal stout is one of my favorites and the barrel definitely is an improvement adding to the complexity of the flavor profile in my opinion."

"The way I hear it, this is the only brewery allowed to age in Wild Turkey barrels. I'm not sure if this is entirely true, but it makes for a good story regardless. This stuff pours a straight obsidian topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises whiskey, toasted oak, and dark chocolate. It's pretty simplistic, but pleasant nonetheless. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the oak character is lessened, the whiskey is consequently increased slightly (and it certainly tastes like Turkey at this point), and there is an addition of very light roasted malts and a hint of Guinness-style sourness near the finish. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly fluid feel. Overall, though a bit on the thin side and a touch too heavy with the whiskey at times, this is a pretty solid barrel-aged stout. Definitely worth a shot."
""

"Drink- I wanted to love this, sadly I didnt Nothing but mess and lack of balance behind it. No vanilla, no oak and no balance. Sadly, I wont come back to this one."
""
""
"Overall - Not bad, but not really my bag. Too much whiskey character, and not enough stout. In the end, it just doesn't strike me as a beer I'd want to try again."
""
""
"O: I always enjoy bourbon barrel-aged beers & this one is certainly solid but not at the front of the pack"
"Appearance is black with heavy lacing. Smell is ripe with hot wild turkey biurbon and plenty of chocolate, vanilla, and a stiff helping of barrel char character. Taste starts with rich chocolate that is somewhat thin, heavy on vanilla and booze. Light waves of fudge followed by heat. Taste is more of the same, light cocoa and vanilla with light oak and bourbon quality. Mouthfeel is thin. With moderate carbonation. Overall, worth a try."

"O- I'd drink more of it, but it would not be a top choice."

"O: Not exactly why Anderson Valley would take a medium bodied base stout which cant hold up to a barrel and throw it in a barrel? Not enough body on this and really not all that great"
""
"Overall: Should not be served cold. Drinks bigger than 6.9%. Has a little bit too much bourbon barrel influence."
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, cookie dough, wood, and a mild bourbon aroma. Taste is much the same with a slight tartness to it. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the barrel aged presence flavor wise is subdued."

"01/22/2013 update: Had this on tap at Rogue in San Francisco. Lots of vanilla, fruity with hints of mango and pineapple. Warm, rich, and seriously drinkable."
""
"The beer simply exudes class- both from the stout and bourbon standpoints. This new Barney Flats variation is much more than a bourbon barrel aged beer, its a collaboration of taste that dovetail together perfectly!"
""
"Overall, I was a bit concerned about Wild Turkey barrels being used, as it's too harsh for me to enjoy straight, but this changed my mind. It's been a while since I've had the regular stout, but I don't recall it being exceptional. This aging really raises it up a notch. Not enough people are barrel aging lower strength brews. It really let the bourbon character come out, while not overshadowing the base beer. Excellent balance."
"O: This is a nice easy to drink bourbon barrel aged stout that has a pleasant aroma but lacks the complexity in the taste that some of the other barrel aged beers have."
"Had a pint at Idle Hands in NYC. I haven't had many non-imperial stouts aged with bourbon that had a good balance, but damn this is fine beer. The smooth, toast and vanilla liquor notes play off the roasted barley with touches of coffee, sweet chocolate, and oats. It's a medium-weight stout, just big enough to carry all the flavors. Overall, it's a wonderfully complex beer and I went back to the bar for a second."
