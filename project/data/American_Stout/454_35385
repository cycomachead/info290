Not in that this is an overwhelmingly sweet beer (though it is quite sweet), but in that the flavor of it with the cheap grainy vibe I pick up is just not something worth $2.69 a pop. Cocoa Loco is a pretty good beer, but after having Too Cream Stout, this beer just isn't doing it for me.","Alextricity","Mar 18, 2014"

Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, molasses, raisin, light coffee, light anise, light cream, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Ok aromas with solid balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and cocoa/molasses notes; with decent strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, molasses, raisin, light coffee, light cream, light anise, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, molasses, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, raisin, light anise, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and complexity of bready/roasted malt and cocoa/molasses flavors; with good robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a solid stout. Solid robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt and cocoa/molasses flavors; and very smooth to drink. A fairly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 15, 2013"

It's fortunate that it doesn't sit to heavy, and I think a good balance is struck in the feel as well as in the other aspects.

The taste is nice, not overly flavorful, but nice. The chocolate and Graham cracker are there, nothing complex but nice. There's a touch of alcohol on the finish but I like it!

Mild chocolate and cocoa powder up front rolls into a bitter black chocolate and coffee taste with an underlying earthy bitterness. Faint chalky mouthfeel. Good balance. Faint alcohol heat and mild bitterness that builds on the back of the tongue. Not overly complex but has enough going on. Overall a pretty nice stout but should definitely come in 6 packs. Alcohol heat and astringency takes away from the beer slightly.","jtierney89","Dec 09, 2012"

The taste of this beer is chocolate, coffee and a nice complex malt variety. I do think this beer could have lost the lactose sugar and been fine because its a little too bitter sweet.

3.34,-6.2,4.5,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was an Ok beer. With a name like Cocoa Loco I thought that chocolate was going to be the main flavor in this beer but to my surprise it was the coffee that stuck out the most, the mixture of both was pretty nice and to my liking, but I would have liked the chocolate to be in the forefront and the coffee in the background. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it just looked really nice in my imperial pint glass. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, the carbonation was spot on but it just seemed to be a little thin and watery for the style. There wasn't a whole lot of drinkability in this beer, I don't think I would want to drink more then one in a sitting. I may pick this up when I need a coffee and chocolate fix and there is no FBS around but if I had to choose between the two it would be FBS every time, the taste is a little similar but FBS does it much better. If your a big fan of coffee and chocolate forward beers this is worth a try, but don't expect it to blow your socks off.

On the nose there is a great combination of ultra-rich chocolate, a huge molasses note, a slightly sour lactose note, a dark roasted malts. To me the only fault is that the lactose might be a step ahead of where it ought to be in the balance. In the mouth all of the parts of the nose are apparent on various parts of the tongue, with the lactose hanging in the background until a long finish leaves it as the last thing on the tongue. The body is medium light, much lighter than I'd have expected based on the nose and pour, and while it's not bad to the point of distraction, it's definitely short on body.

Fits the usual description, nothing impressive. The comes off first with a nice roasty whiff floating on the CO2. Then comes the chocolate, it starts out like raw cocoa powder, but then it gets creamy and full, there's almost a milky smell (surprise, there's lactose, after looking at the bottle). It smells sugary, but not sickeningly sweet, actually, once tasteing it, it's not even close to being as sweet as it smells. I actually which the taste was a bit sweeter, but there's plenty that is interesting in there. Taste's like dessert without quite as much sugar. There's a nice molasses presence, combined with the cocoa powder (that's a bit of an obvious statement I suppose). There's a bit of a slickness, which is common in dryer stouts. There's a bit of a cherry or raspberry taste, too. The molasses flavor is most prominent in the taste, but the chocolate does not have a very major presence here. The taste isn't exactly exceptional, but it's interesting, and could definitely be worse. I would say that there ought to be a bit more sweetness, maybe a bit more roastiness, and if it's supposed to be 'cocoa loco', then the chocolate should be toned up in the taste. Also the body is a bit on the thin side of medium, which isn't much in the stout category. The carbonation is kind of nice, not stingy, not harsh, but pleasant. But still, this is about average in the style. Overall, I think it's just a bit too dry, and a little too slick. It's a fairly enjoyable drink.

The aroma was full of milk chocolate, cocoa and hints of coffee and earth. The flavors were similar, starting sweet with lots of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, notes of earth and coffee in the middle and a baking chocolate bitterness on the finish.

Huge on the cocoa in the scent. Other aromas are of Tootsie rolls, a really warm roasty malt, more than a dash of molasses and a pinch of alcohol. The flavor and feel of this fuller end of the medium scale body wise beer is a chocolate malted. The use of lactose in the brewing process brings out a creamy quality that compliment the super huge & rich cocoa flavors melding them together nicely than just leaving each other stand apart. As it warms it does take on some bitter & dark chocolate characteristics but still has soothing texture all the way down.

Lacing was present and respectable. Cocoa and light chocolate on the nose. Impressive stout, nice light chocolate notes, darker malts and some sort of sweat/slightly sour thing going on. Pleasant and highly quaff able for a larger (but not huge) stout. Nice stuff, would work with a chocolate dessert, but also helped wash down a rib or two","Billolick","Mar 23, 2008"

It starts off with a sweet hint of molasses and then comes in with a big bold dark chocolate/coffee.

3.36,-5.6,3.5,2.5,4,3.5,3,"Arcadia's Cocoa Loco is a bit sedate and rather less than hoped for in an imperial/double stout. The brew pours from the bottle a modestly dark color. The head is tan and foamy, but short lasting. The smell is horrendous, being the weakest feature of this stout, bringing forth unholy thoughts of stench associated memories from the deep depths of recall. Fortunately, however, the taste does not mirror the olfactory battery. While cocoa is not what comes to mind at any point, there is a nice roasted malty vanguard, followed by some nice bitter bites on the back end. The mouthfeel is smooth but thin.

4.02,12.9,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"2006 vintage, ""Stout brewed with chocolate, molasses and lactose"". Pours black with a solid half-finger tan head, looks great right off the top and I almost marked it higher for appearance. Slow steady carbonation was a bit subdued, some lacing. The smell is the first hint that there is a lot going on here - rich chocolate, the molasses sure comes through, then a burnt, smoky odour in abundance. The taste is similarly entertaining with chocolate and cocoa and a creamy-textured mouthfeel, rich but not overpowering. Gentle bitterness is nicely balanced with a dry, nutty aftertaste. Long finish. With air and warming, there were hints of sweet caramel, toffee, toast and malt in the choco-cocoa mix, but also a bitter brazil nut astringency that I could have done without. There is a sweetness that, at times was a bit surreal, maybe that was the lactose; it struck me as a bit artificial. Still, this is an amazing stout with layers of complexity to it, if you can get by that label, that is. Another fine purchase from Merchant's in Dearborn.","ThatWineGuy","Nov 16, 2007"

The aromas were light and, again, took on milk chocolate notes with light Kona coffee, roasted malts, and caramel malts. The flavors are rich and full, but not agressive or strong by any means. The cocoa flavors rise above the coffee, nutty, malty notes. Light bittering only offers balance for the sweetness and no other contributing flavors or aromas. the body seems full and round, but not heavy or weighted at all -- remains airy.
