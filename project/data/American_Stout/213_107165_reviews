"Tastes like a coffee frappacino. Nice"
""
"O- For the money, it's decent.  But, once it warms, this beer becomes near undrinkable.  My advice is to drink this beer cold and, considering it's Narragansett, it isn't all that surprising.  Could be worse, but could also be a whole lot better."

"It was just ok to me."
"Perfect combination of coffee and stout. When your done it leaves you wanting a cup of coffee and a pint of beer. Narry's got a winner with this."

"Six-pack of tall boys from WH ABC...."
"An excellent beer for the price."
""
""
"More in line with Stone Coffee Milk Stout."
""
""
""
""
"Light bodied is my only complaint. But $10 for a 6 pack of tall boys, it's a winner"
"Rich stout with a bold coffee presence. This beer has coffee in abundance. Finish is bitter. Good coffee kick."
""
""
""
"first like this I've had. its good"
""
"This brewery's best offering by far - love it!"
""
"All I can say is WOW."
""
"This stout has everything it should.  Nice roastiness along with a good bit of Coffee flavor.  The milk stout feel was a bit low possibly being a little overpowered by the coffee.  Poured black with a nice head.  This is a very enjoyable lower alcohol stout that borders on great."

"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 9/25/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, cream, light char, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and coffee notes; with great strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, cream, light char, and roasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, cream, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good complexity and solid robustness of dark/roasted malt and coffee flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. There is a fair amount of dryness on the finish as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly creamy, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice coffee milk stout. All around good complexity and solid robustness of dark/roasted malt and coffee flavors; and very smooth to drink. This felt more like a dry stout, but was still nicely enjoyable."

"This is an average beer that drinks more like a session brown ale than a stout. I like that it is lower ABV and is easy drinking. Overall it is enjoyable but not something I will seek out again. I tend not to love coffee in beer unless it is a big rich stout."
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this relatively low abv stout/porter. It compares well with my favorite stout - SN Stout. You get a nice head on the pour with decent lacing as the beer is consumed. Some have mentioned the level of carbonation and it is a bit higher than some other stouts I've tried. It does contribute to a lighter mouthfeel. I think I'll be buying this one again."
"A bit more carbonation and thickness than a typical stout. Almost akin to a porter. The appearance of cola, and a coffe-ish chocolately taste breathes a roasted flavor of coffeebeans. Ive found its better to let it age in the can for a couple months. It lets the carbonation and particles settle more. Delicious beer though. Comes with a buzz."
""
""
"I have to admit that I was skeptical about this beer given the Narragansett name, but it totally delivers. It's rich with an authentic coffee flavor, as well as chocolate and caramel; and perfectly balanced without any flavors covering over others, or eventually building to take the lead. A moderate bitterness balances it, and it teeters between sweet and dry, but always with a pleasant roasted edge. Some might argue that there's not enough body or malt to it, but I feel that if it's got the flavor that you're looking for that's enough; it's a trade-off, more body and malt might be more satisfying, but less leaves it more drinkable. It finishes dry, and fairly short, with some coffee and dark chocolate lingering along with some very subtle hops. It's not complex, but it's rich."
""
""
""
""
"I can't fathom why anybody would rate this low, except that maybe the reviewer just doesn't think well of Narraganset lager.  I don't like their lager much at all either, but their dark seasonal beers have been OUTSTANDING."
""
"O: This is as local as it gets for me and I grew up with Autocrat,  so I'm already a fan. But it's also just a good beer in my opinion. Nothing crazy special, but It's pretty cheap and well worth a spot in the fridge."
"My rating: 2.95"
"I had this on tap and was good. Strong coffee taste but smooth. In the can it taste overpowering with coffee and booze really turned me off"

"Drank straight from the can.  I have averaged out the ratings based on an overall score.  I liked the flavor.  The coffee was fairly limited and it was nice and smooth.  Good body.  Would drink again."
"O - Easy drinker, coffee is solid but not overbearing.  If this was local and cheap it could be a go to type beer."
"The coffee aromas and flavors are dominant here, but the milk stout character doesn't quite come out. If we're talking about being true to the ""coffee milk stout"" style, it loses a few points, but if we can judge it as a coffee stout or as a beer overall, it's quite good."
"Overall: Not a bad coffee stout, with decent thickness. My review is simple because this beer pretty much boils down to one word: coffee."
""
""
"It was alright. Kind of one note, and it wasn't that good of a note to begin with. Nothing special about it at all. I think I'd rather drink a cup of coffee and then a beer."
""
""
"Quite dry for a milk stout.  Pours nearly opaque with a inch-tall brown head.  Smells lightly sweet and chocolatey with a fine compliment of dry hops.  Tastes like it smells: straightforward.  Mild coffee nodes move into a sweet and smooth middle, ending on dark-roasted barley and bitter hops."

"This beer was great, and totally unexpected"

"One of the worst beers I have had. Very thin. No real flavor. Tasted like a cup of coffee that had been sitting out for a couple of days on the counter."

"Maybe skip the lactose, and just call it a dry coffee stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown/black with a brown head with a good amount of retention to the carbonation. The smell is full of coffee and espresso with some sweetness, dark chocolate scents coming through. The taste was full of coffee flavors with an undercurrent of sweet milk chocolate. Very tasty and makes a hell of an after dinner beer."
""
"Strong coffee scent and flavor. Not thick like most stouts however."
"Certainly kind of one dimensional but I dig it for the format and price. Coffee feels fresh and flavorful and delivers atop that Narragansett yeast profile."
""
""
""
"A smooth stout with a refreshing coffee flavor."
""
""
"Taste starts with roasted dark grains, tart lactic character in the middle, and then smooths back into the close. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is good.  Enjoyable representative of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Despite losing some of the more subtle flavors and aromas due to the dominant ones being magnified, this is an excellent example of the style and hits all of the required nails right on the head.  The pour is beautiful and the finish leaves you wanting more; this works out well given the moderate ABV, which lends this to be a definite session candidate.  Honestly I have yet to be disappointed with any of the recent offerings from Narragansett, and this is no different.  At $8 for a six pack of tall-boys, it may be the best coffee milk stout I've had for the money."
"Can. Pours dark brown with an accompanying dark brown head. Aroma is moderate coffee, chocolate and roast. It does not smell very intense, which is fine because the actual smells are on point. The flavor was pleasantly dry. It was not too sweet, thankfully. The coffee and roasted flavor are dominant. Unsweetened chocolate also works it's way I'm. There is some sweetness but it isn't an overly sugary beer. Body was slightly creamy but not too heavy. I enjoyed this one."

"Good beer"
""
""
"This is a revelation- probably the best Narragansett beer I've had. Much better than the recent Stone Coffee Milk Stout. A bit more complexity on the finish, and it would be even more amazing."
""
"Narragansett's Autocrat Coffee Milk Stout is an immensely flavorful and enjoyable beer that pays homage to an iconic Rhode Island product. Like Del's Shandy, this is a welcomed edition to the brewery's portfolio."
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is jet black, with a creamy, dense, dark tan head that doesn't go anywhere. Very nice. Aromas of dark roasted coffee, subtle crème, hints of bittersweet chocolate, and earthy notes. Flavors are pretty heavy roasted coffee forward, rich and bitter, with a highlight of cocoa nibs, subtle crème, and a hint of nut sweetness. Smooth bodied, with dry undertones, this is an easy drinker. The aftertaste has more of the milky sugar notes, with coffee and chocolate still blending together nicely. Smooth, slightly dry finish, with a solid bitter and roasted linger. This is a well balanced, solid brew."

"O: A very easy to drink and enjoyable coffee milk stout - and one that I had to get because of the nostalgia factor (I lived in Southern NE growing up and drank more than my fair share of Autocrat Coffee Milks). The coffee flavor is strong but still very enjoyable."

"A very good coffee stout, not an imperial."

"Nice mouthfeel.  Not too heavy at all for a stout, I'd say on the lighter end of medium for the style, but it still has a lingering flavor.  Great carbonation level, tickles your taste buds, yet it's really smooth.  Starts sweet, stays smooth, almost milky/creamy, then has a nice dry bitter finish.  Crazy drinkable all around great beer regardless of style.  Great price too;  I'm a huge Stone brewing company fan, but their coffee milk stout isn't as good as this and it costs more for less beer.  Nice job Narragansett, you nailed this one!"
""
""
""
"Overall: One of 'Gansett's best I think, and one that I'll re-review when I get to trying it in an actual glass or something. I intend on buying more of this for the winter months, as it would be a great beer for the season without being too boozy."
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark black / Brown with a very lovely tan creamy Head. Smells of toasted Brown bread and rich malts. Taste is very smooth and creamy with hints  of brown bread, malts and rich creamy Coffee and Milk flavor. This is an awesome Coffee Milk stout and one I will get an extra case of this week while it is around. I give it a complete rating of 4.5 it is awesome!"
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good ""stout"".  My only knock is that it really isn't a stout, more of a porter at best.  Great coffee flavor."
""
""

"Another well made brew from Narragansett. Will buy more, for sure."

"O - Super drinkable. Nose is a little one dimension but I loved the flavor profile.  Can't beat the price either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  As a staple of RI coffee, it is good to see Narragansett getting back to their original state.  In due time they will get back to RI.  In the mean time, we can enjoy more of these delicious brews."
""
""
"Overall, a decent beer. An easy drinker of a stout."
""
""
""
""
"O: Certainly no FBS, but still a solid coffee stout with a nice lactose addition. Very drinkable and definitely gets you your roasty coffee fix. Great value at under $9 for a 6-pack of 16 oz. cans"
""
"A very thin coffee milk stout. For being a Gannsett beer, this is pretty darn good. Would I buy this over the Stone Coffee Milk Stout? Probably. It's cheaper per ounce and just as good. It's probably slightly less flavorful though. It's a bargain."
""
""
""
"Well worth a try if you like Narragansett's other offerings."
"O: not a stout I would reach for, but OK;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall:  like it a lot and a super bargain at the price. Have paid a lot more and gotten less.  Will drink again."

"O 3.75 - Definitely good for what it is.  I was expecting more coffee, but a decent American Stout nonetheless."
""
"o: An easy drinking and flavorful stout, highly sessionable.  Goes well with meals including breakfast.  I had my first today with Sunday brunch instead of coffee and it was lovely.  But it's also a good sipper.  Slightly superior as such to the new Stone CMS, at not much more than half the price!"

"A deft use of an otherwise awful product. Balances the syrupy nature of Autocrat with a decent base stout. Nothing to write home about, but it's all well-done and that's more than enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I knew I would dig this. It's just such a great concept for a stout. Even if it's more straight coffee than coffee milk, it's an excellent stout. I would love to see them add this to their annual seasonal lineup. It would make a great beer to look forward to every winter. Narrangansett's craft offerings never let me down and this may be my favorite one since the straight-up porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall disappointed. Wanted a good local milk stout but got watery maybe malt liquid."
"Pours a solid dark brown with a creamy off white head that persists forever. Aromas of roast, coffee, cream, and a hint of dark fruit and chocolate. The flavor reminds me of Murphy's but add some coffee to it. Earthy bitter roasted grains with a bit of cream and a whole lot of coffee. Medium to thin body with a moderate level of carbonation and a creamy silky mouthfeel. Decent enough brew, but a bit heavy on the coffee without enough body or sweetness of something to back it up."
""
""
"O: Its OK. Lot of coffee flavor and the price is always right on narrangansett, I wouldnt buy again. The Porter that apparently is discontinued is far better. I loved that beer ."
"not much aroma, a little nutty if anything; served on tap at Sullivan's in Pawtucket; Thought it was unavailable so wanted to try it; smooth flavor; very drinkable. very little aftertaste. So-so head but left decent lacing. Body was kind of weak. Decent carbonation. Feel it was made to be a flash-in-the-pan RI-thing by adding the Autocrat name to it. I didn't like it as much as I do the 'Gansett Porter. Hope they repeat it next year. Probably comparable to Sam's Winter Lager."
"Overall: An above average, slightly sweet coffee beer. The coffee is not overpowering. Tasty, but just above average for the style."
""
""
"Imagine a 50-50 split of iced coffee with dark beer and this would be the likely result. There's little else to note--no cream, no hop and very little residual sugar. The body is thin with a decent level of carbonation. A good novelty."
""
"I bought this can out of curiosity, but I was afraid to drink it for a few weeks because I feared it would be way too sweet. Surprisingly, it isn't. It is sweet, but it works. The coffee flavor could be better, but I suppose that judgment is wrong if you're a huge fan of Autocrat. I guess it's ""a Rhode Island thing."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is also a coffee and cream paradise with a mildly bitter bite coming up behind. Not bad at all."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, as the name implies it’s a strongly-flavored coffee beer and it’s a very good one."
""
"O - Decent milk stout. A great changeup from a coffee porter as a nice coffee flavored beer that is easy to drink. Pair this with jalapeno poppers or a similar spicy appetizer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The acidity and astringency really wear on the palate and make it tough to drink towards the end. The sweeter lactose side of things is stifled."
"On the whole, very solid. Not amazing, not mindblowing, but very, very solid. As a native of Rhode Island, 'Gansett did both themselves and Autocrat proud with this one, and I hope it comes around again."

"A really nice beer. Thin at first but grows bolder and more complex. Well balanced. A great drinker or it would be good to put in stew or chili. I'd return when it grows colder."
"It is very hard to find (I'm in southeast Massachusetts and find it sold out all over the area) and I'm very disappointed that this is a limited brew. I really hope that the Gansett crew will add this to the family. It's a welcome addition."
""
"O: Overall I really love the beer. Hard to find in Rhode Island as I thought it would be, but now it seems its hard to find because people figured out, ""Hey.. This is an awesome brew!"""
""
"It's my new favorite from Gansett."
"But drinkable"
""
"O: Absolutely fantastic offering here from good old 'Gansett. Have to say this would wash down a couple of hot weinies quite well!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 'Gansett did a solid job with this one. Very easy drinking coffee brew. Unlike most coffee infused stouts that need to be sipped, this one goes down very easily and would go well with a classic New England Breakfast, couple over easy, some hash browns bacon and sausage."
""
""
""
""
"Not epic but a great coffee stout and a steal for the price!"
""
""
"16oz Tall Boy. Pours a super dark brownish black color with a half inch of khaki head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is sweet chocolate with light and sweet cofee. Slight amount of earth. The taste is when the roasty coffee flavor comes out. Dark and sweet coffee with some milk chocolate. Earth and bittersweet dark chocolate towards the end. Finishes nicely with some more of the coffee and lactose. Mouthfeel is light with lots of carbonation. Very drinkable. Overall, a great addition to the 'Gansett lineup. I hope this one becomes part of the regular lineup."
""
""
"I was surprised at the drinkability of this milkstout, I plan on drinking more of this in the future."
""
"Overall a tasty treat but not anything I could drink a lot of. Check it out. Pretty interesting concept that could have easily turned out bad. I'm pleased overall"
