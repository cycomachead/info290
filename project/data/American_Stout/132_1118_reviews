"Overall – 94.3 (Excellent): Tasting this beer again after a brief hiatus reminded me of what I was missing, similar to a short breakup with a girlfriend. Holy smokes, what a fantastic beer! If you remotely enjoy chocolate OR stouts (and especially both), you owe it to yourself to sample this beverage. Extremely easy to drink, delicious, and delivering on every level, there is no doubt that several bottles of this will find it to my basement to age. Incredible!"
"A great gift brought by guests to a dinner party. Ads stouts are her favorite beer style, my wife got to contribute to this review....a rarity. Pours a deep black licorice with a pretty coffee brown bubbly head that dissipates, but returns with a gentle swirl of the glass. The scent is of toasted malt and leaves a reminder of chocolate milk. The taste is of bitter dark chocolate, a hint of coffee, and a faint caramel aftertaste. Some creaminess, but also a nice carbonation. Slightly sweet, especially late. We've had chocolatier stouts, but this was nicely balanced and really quite well done. I hope to get this again, but I'll likely have to share it."

"Great stout!"

"With such a chocolate smell upon first sip of this you'd think you were eating a piece of 70% cacao.  Pitch black in color.  Overly sweet smell but dry taste.  This might be the base malts for the voodoo donut brew they make."

"This was one of the better bombers I've had in a while. tasted very very fresh. I enjoyed it a lot. Stuff pours a little lighter then an IMP with a larger toffee colored head that keeps its shape. Taste has lots of coffee, didn't get any tobacco notes. feel is awesome, not slippery but more coarse. overall the bottle i has was fresh and i really really enjoyed it!"
""

"Much worse than its double counterpart. Too bitter and not enough chocolate for a beer called chocolate stout"

"It's a year since I've seen my girl. My lips missed your feel, tongue your taste.2 inch head is all you need, dark as night, smooth as water."
""

"Exactly everything I look for in a chocolate stout."
""
""
""
""

"Too bitter for my palate. Hops seem to overpower the chocolate and roasted flavors."

"O: This is a very well balanced stout with good chocolate flavors and a clean, crisp finish from the hops. A good amount of malt and hop flavors that work together but don't overpower the other. I could see this being a staple in my fridge, and I will have to get more soon."
""
""
""
""
"Thick black, Strong chocolate flavor. I thought it tasted like NesQuick with a drop of Liquid Smoke,"
""
"Overall - Drink this beer immediately, preferably with your buddies or by yourself in front of a fire on a cold night. It is excellent."
""
""
""
""
"Taste - The chocolate taste is first but it is not as overwhelmingly sweet as i thought it would be.  It actually had a nice balance to it with a little bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great go to chocolate stout. the new rebel hop really gives it a bitter finish that isn't quite as subtle as the discontinued 9 ingredient cascade hop version. I think the ibu on this new version is underrated but this stout is great being as it's not an imperial/double stout it has a slightly thin mouthful and a modest 6%abv but it makes up with chocolaty goodness from beginning to end.. I recommend this beer and I believe it shines as it warms as do most stouts I recommend a slight chill our pull it out of the fridge and let it sit and warm a bit I enjoy it from a balloon so it warms in my hand.. the slight complexity that is there can be easily missed if it's to cold and it will really mask the bitter chocolate taste..."

"Overall: Very nice, but not necessarily what i expected. The chocolate aspect i thought was phenomenal, but lighter bodied and too one sided for my liking. Very good though."
""
""
"Pours pitch black, no light getting through whatsoever . BIG chocolate and roasted smell. Taste is drier than the smell led me to believe, but that is nice since this is so rich. Mouthfeel is heavy as $^!@, super thick like a shake. Thick, dense, creaming head that sticks around forever and coats the entire glass as you drink. This is a great chocolate stout, around the same enjoyment as Samuel Smith's for me."

"Very solid chocolate stout.  Not too sweet from the cocoa, not too bitter like some stouts.  Middle of the road alcohol content makes this a very easy to enjoy beer.  Thumbs up to this one for sure."

"Overall I like this beer, for when I have an extra 2 bucks to toss at a bomber. 6.50 is kinda steep, but is it oh so good."
"Cream of the crop when it comes to affordable  Chocolate Stouts.  You can find this about anywhere, I bought mine from safety, but don't be discouraged just because it's common.  This stuff is legit, and I replace a bottle everytime.  One of my favorite stouts.  Smooth taste but has that ""stout bitterness"" it should.  Dark in color, great in flavor, good on cool nights."
""
"22 oz Bottle.What a nice surprise.This was recommended to me by the High Desert Walrus.Goo gookey chew.Great Chocolate Stout.Tasted just like a liquid candy bar.Put on a little John Fogerty and I was ready to rock this one.At 6.0ABV it was a little less than I am used too from a stout but the wonderful flavor and that great smell of Chocolate just really did it for me.I will be drinking this again.Thanks Walrus."

"Pitch black pour with a creamy two finger beige head with good retention and great lacing.  The nose is huge and really lives up to the name.  Tons of cocoa and dark chocolate along with hints of milk chocolate, oats, and vanilla.  The taste follows suit with the chocolate again dominating, but with a distinct bitterness.  Hints of cocoa, caramel, leather, vanilla, oats, and roasty coffee.  The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with medium carbonation and a dry, bittersweet finish.  Overall, this surprised me as I was expecting a sweet and syrupy artificial mess, but instead got a much more natural tasting chocolate stout."

"O: Pretty beer, love the bronze/copper head, solid retention and collaring dress the glass nicely. Very sweet, probably works best for a desert or after dinner sipper. I wish the viscosity were ramped up a bit. Very rich chocolate presence, boarder line overwhelming. Reminiscent of Southern Tier’s works. Tasty sipper."

"A pretty dark stout color with a strong mocha colored head. The lace thin but very strong and stained the glass big time as I drank the brew down. Very nice to look at. Nose was (guess) chocolate, candied sugar, caramel nougat, and a little rum-like ester. All were appetizing to smell, but none were presented or combined in an impressive way. Taste was (guess) chocolate and candied sugar. Had a dry hoppy finish but of the bitter sort you'd find in good chocolate. Even better was its almost fruity espresso flavors in the middle of its flavor profile. The mouthfeel was thin with a fizz that came from the head and hops. A very straightforward beer but by no means boring and one of the better stouts out of the six famous and beeradvocate highly-ranked ones I've had recently. Simple and simply edible, this is a tasty stout I am welcome to return to. With a way too easy mouthfeel, and skilled brewing, its a beer version of milk chocolate."

"Personally this Rogue beer is the only worth trying Rogue beer out there. I have tried a couple other kinds of theirs and this one was the only one that tasted exactly like it was advertised. Very good Chocolate Stout for those out there that like their Stouts actually sweet with Chocolate versus the Oatmeal or bitter taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has a non-creamy mouthfeel. It is so missing that big chocolate stoutness, but it has a great easier drinking vibe. I can easily finish the bomber and live to drink something else afterwards."
""
"O - a surprise package, smacks of coffee and bitter chocolate but in such a light taste overall. Undecided. Still unsure of Rogue yeast tho to this palate with overall aftertaste."

"I have seen this beer in the fridge at work for months though never tried it. I decided to give her a go and purchased a 22oz bottle with my food. I poured the beer and it looked fantastic. I am a fan of stouts so I had high hopes. I took a whiff and the beer impressed me once again. It was only when I proceeded to take a taste that I realized that this was not my brew. The initial taste was delightful but then easily overpowered by strong hints of cocoa powder. I read the bottle and they hit the nail on the head by describing it as ""chocolate truffle."" Too choco for me. I would recommend to a friend. Merely for kicks- as a novelty beer."

"o: A good chocolate stout, easy drinking and tasty."

""

"This is an excellent chocolate stout. The appearance is chocolatey, the smell is that of chocolate, and the taste is right on...chocolate. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall, I would call this the standard for all chocolate stouts. Then again, if you want more of this, have the Double Chocolate Stout. A double serving of this magical drink. I will have this regularly."

"Pours a nice dark brown black with a great tannish head. First sniff and I'm in heaven. Pure chocolate. Expecting a sweetness due to the aroma but this beer is not sweet at all. Lots of body and flavor and goes down well. A very impressive beer. Can't wait to try the double chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pitch-black in color with a 3-finger tan head that dissipates fairly quickly that leaves lots of lacing. You can smell the 'imported chocolate' right off the bat with some malts & hops. The taste is to be expected. Lots of chocolate and roasted malts! Just a slight bitter aftertaste, which is from the various hops. The ""9 ingredients: 2-Row, C-120 & Chocolate Malts, Cascade Hops, Rolled Oats, Roasted Barley, Chocolate, Free Range Coastal Water and Pacman Yeast"" is written on the right side of the bottle. If you like chocolate stouts that is loaded with taste, then this is for you. First 'Rogue 'that I have had and they make several different types. Overall a enjoyable brew. I would of rated it higher if not for the slight bitter aftertaste that lingers."
"Overall: Pretty solid American Stout. Now I why it has been rated the most for this style."

"This is a good beer. It is well crafted. The nose is pure chocolate and the taste is nicely complex. The main problem I have is that the nose suggest something sweet and what you get at first is sour and bitter. I also miss roasted barley that is typical for the style. Anyway, will definitely get this again."

"O: Smells better than it tastes, but it's still a really good chocolate stout. Their double chocolate stout is better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Dark pour, mostly chocolate in aroma and flavor. Nice, not too rich. Easy to drink for sure. Wish there were more flavor profiles but they did nail the chocolate part. Good but not a stand out for me."

"O: Super tasty chocolate stout that's not overly sweet. Many different flavors come out and all have their fair share of presence in your mouth. Go out and buy this!"
""

"I was impressed by the rich espresso color of this stout. It had a perfect mouthfeel. I could pick up on the chocolate flavor without it being overpowering. Is was smooth and creamy with just the perfect level of carbonation and a pleasantly bitter finish. It may sound crazy but it had the after taste of a tootsie roll. I have not had a lot of chocolate stouts, but after this one, I will be seeking them out."
"Popped the cap, smells of chocolate milkshake come to mind. Pours jet black with a one finger milk chocolate colored head. Taste is good, not quite as rich as I'd hoped for so looking forward to trying the Double Chocolate Stout. Honestly, this tastes like a Hershey's kiss, I just wish it had more of an alcohol zip the the Southern Tier Creme brûlée. Great beer though my wife likes, would definitely buy again."
""
""
"O- Not one of my favorite styles, but a great representation of it. Exactly what the label declares, Chocolate Stout. Good balance, creamy mouthfeel, plenty of chocolate. Well done beer by Rogue."

"this chocolate stout is one of the best I've had. Its a lovely be chocolate brown and the head is a beautiful mocha brown it smells vaguely of chocolate in roasted malts the taste is the deep malts roasting notes and of course in some chocolate. The mouth feel is also very very well done and the carbonation is perfect score. overall awesome beer"

"This is a poor beer. I do not understand the love for it on this site. The beer has little flavor. I don't get a lot of chocolate flavor. The poorest aspect of this is the mouthfeel. So thin. Nothing redeeming about this beer that I can tell. I used to like Rogue Shakespeare Stout and I'd heard that this was better. I hesitate to even try old Billy Shakes if this is better."

"Did a tasting from two bombers, the older 12-ingredient version and the new 9-ingredient one with real chocolate and less hop. Basically, that was the difference, and I thought the previous 12 ingredient version was better, more unique. The new version definitely has a smoother, more delicious chocolate flavor, but without that hop background, it tastes just like any other quality chocolate stout. The original 12-ingredient had something special in that combination."

"Split a 22oz bottle with a friend. This pours a dark brown color with a fluffy brown head. The aroma is mixture of cocoa and malts. I was expecting a heavy, dense, volume with this but instead its rather light and creamy. The most obvious taste being the unsweetened chocolate and malts. I was expecting a little something more and different from this one."

"O: I know this has gotten some really good ratings but I don't see why. There was very little taste to this beer and the chocolate didn't add anything to it as far as I was concerned."

"O-I really enjoyed this one. Quite thick, quite sweet, and quite dominant. I stout that runs up to you, gets in your face, and demands that you like it; despite the fact that the hardcore beer drinkers think its a sissy beer because contains chocolate. A bold and brash boss who lets you know who is in the building."
""
"I really like these thick and rich stouts that aren't jam packed full of alcohol. This is a good one, I would certainly have it again. I can't remember if I like it better than their regular oatmeal stout or not, as it's been a while. I recall liking it tho, and I would guess this one is somewhat similar in overall nature."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer had a nice scent to it... Not sure if cocoa nibs was used or just the chocolate malt but either way i couldnt get the scent right. Taste had a overpowering smoked flavor that had a alcohol finish. I wanted more chocolate but overall not a bad stout... Just not their best. I would stick with their oatmeal stout."

"It’s not exactly my style as I prefer a creamier, milkier chocolate stout like some Russian Imperials or American Double stouts. It’s more of a well rounded beer with a hint of chocolate. Go into this expecting a beer with some chocolate, not a chocolate stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. powerful stout. the chocolate is overwhelming in a good way. pretty low abv for a stout with this much flavor, but that's okay. sweet and roasty. would have again."
"O - This is the best chocolate stout that I have had thats why my fridge always has one. Glad this one is made year round."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I tend to balk at spending over 5 dollars for a bomber of beer, but I've never been disappointed with a Rogue product, and consider the money as well-spent."
""
""
"This is, hands down, the best chocolate stout I've had the pleasure of trying to date. I keep searching for something equal or better tasting, as I don't see it often up in Maine, but alas... to no avail! This beer has just the most perfect blend of true chocolate flavor... not too sweet. It's like desert in a bottle for me!"
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice beer. I didn't have a lot of expectations for this beer, so I am pretty darn impressed. The flavors are great, it's sweet but not overpowering, it's a great dessert beer. I would drink this again, and would recommend it to someone looking for a milder version of Southern Tier's Choklat."

"O: This would make a rock-solid everyday stout if it were A) in 6 packs and B) less expensive. It's still a decent offering, and better than the double."
""
"O- I really like this beer. It is a light stout that can be enjoyed any day. This beer really has both sides of the equation. It has the nice robust chocolate taste upfront followed by a bitter hoppy aftertaste which makes this beer very well-rounded and enjoyable to most beer drinkers."
""
""
""
""
""
"You really don’t fell the 69 IBUs. Great stout and well balanced, not overly complex, focusing on what is promising: chocolate. A must for chocolate lovers."
"O: Competent, if not complex, the components of this beer don't, for me, add up to an outstanding whole. I'd drink it again, and it is solidly above-average, but somehow seems slightly lacking."
""
""
""
"O: the chocolate presence is there but more with flavors of cocoa than a candy bar, the dose of hops adds an interesting twist to the finish"

"Pours seal brown with a modest mocha head of coarse bubbles. Aroma smells of milk and dark chocolates, coffee, and citric hops. Flavor is surprisingly mild considering the aroma. I'm thinking this may require considerable warming to get the most out of it. For now, I'm getting a well balanced blend of roasted malt (tending toward coffee) and earthy, citric hops. A delightful mocha haze sneaks up late in the aftertaste. Some milk chocolate is there, but it's very faint in comparison to the more acrid elements. To be honest, I'd be hard-pressed to brand this a chocolate stout when I think of the many stouts out there with a far great chocolate character. Even Rogue's own Shakespeare Stout has a stronger chocolate presence in my opinion. I had this a couple years ago and recall having much the same impression. The mouthfeel is pretty zippy, perhaps a little too much so for the style. With that said, this remains a drinkable stout with a nice roasted character, albeit short on the eponymous chocolate."

"The taste is dry, chocolatey with a strong burnt maltiness. Touches of coffee mix with the chocolate and present an espresso creaminess. There's some watery tones that end with a metal like feel at the aftertaste but its not so off-putting as to keep one from enjoying a really good stout."

"as good as a chocolate stout can get. this is divine. pours a velvety dark brown color with a thick milkshake head, mocha in color, sudsy and lasting. the nose is a mix of milk and dark chocolate, not overly sweet, but definitely real chocolate. well roasted malts are nice and dark and earthy, but not burnt to the point of being bitter. the flavor is remarkably chocolate heavy. its almost like youngs, but the sweetness isn't as intense thankfully. there is a very organic nature to this. its like adult dessert, I really like it. not incredibly complex, but more of a simple and straightforward brew, with little to distract the drinker from the robust chocolate flavors and smooth creamy feel. everything is balanced perfectly, the flavors here are just fantastic. full body, amazingly smooth, and it changes from cold to warm quite a bit. carbonation is mellow all the way through, just enough to wash it down clean. overall this might be the best beer rogue makes, and that's saying something! I am still yet to try their double chocolate though, so who knows..."
"Not subtle and perhaps not real sessionable, but a definite pleasure to drink for this chocolate lover. Well done, Rogue!"

"O - This beer seems really overrated, partially because i tend to think BA is in love with hoppy beers non matter what the style and partially because of Rogue's reputation for good brews. This is not even in my top 5 of chocolate stouts and not in my top of 10 stouts. I like hops in an IPA, not my chocolate stouts."

"This is not one of Rogues typically Verry Good beers. For a stout it is weak on flavor. Lacks the typical sweet/strong boldness I like in a stout. Having said that it is still a good beer just not up to the Rogue standard I've come to expect. Worth trying but not one of my future go to beers."
""
""
""
"Sweet chocolate mixed with a nice stout. And to reiterate: Hershey's syrup."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tall mug. Pours a very dark brown/black with a nice thick tan head. The chocolate is noticeable right away while pouring. It's a darker chocolate flavor and smells absolutely delicious. Taste is surprisingly hoppy and bitter but the dark chocolate flavor softens the blow. This is almost like a cross between an IPA and a stout. The hops bring a slight sting while the chocolate and oats add creaminess to the palate. Mouth is very creamy. Goes down so smooth, I could drink this all day."

"Second tasting. After trying this a second time, I have changed my mind. Being from the UK I am used to a British style of stout, as that was what I was expecting I was disappointed. This time around I took a more open minded sip. This is actually a very tasty and balanced beer, i still find it some what a hybrid to my tastes but a real tasty one. I hope to try more from Rogue ales."

"D - Enjoyable chocolate stout, but probably not my first choice for the style. Overall it was certainly worth trying, but I'd still put it below DDC's Aphrodisiaque. Another solid beer from the folks at Rogue; good stuff."

"A solid beer and it definitely delivers on it's chocolate taste but it wasn't quite complex enough for me. Just a chocolate beer by itself leaves me feeling like something was lacking.

"overall a very pleasant stout to drink, is heavy and creamy, the bitter cocoa powder flavor is marked and lasts in your mouth like a heavy mocha coffee. goes down easily, alcohol barely noticeable. this opens up as reaching towards room temp."

"O: A chocolate stout that delivers on the chocolate flavor."

"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Great looking opaque/black pour with a nice adequate 1+ finger mocca head. Smell was baking chocolates up front with semi-sweet chocolate on the back. Fits the name and that's what I was looking for. Maybe some burnt malts stuffed in there, but huge chocolate. Taste was melted chocolate bars with a little hop finish. Again, some dark fruits/malts are there, but the chocolate takes center stage on this chocolate stout bomb. I get a blend of different chocolate which is nice. Baking, semi sweet and dark combination. Feel is middle of the road and quite silky/creamy. Mild carbonation on this which is just fine. Overall- It is what it is! A chocolate stout with not a ton of bells and whistles. If you like chocolate in your beer, this is right there for you. Not over the top, but a good sipper and pretty enjoyable. A solid effort that hit the spot for me. Not the best out there, but work the try-"
""
""
""
"Pour is deep brown with a long-lasting khaki head and great lacing. Sweet chocolate, Hershey syrup, lacto, light roast, and coffee in the aroma. Taste is much more roasty, dark chocolate, a hit watered down, caramel, coffee, and anise with a lightly roasted bitter finish. Medium body with soft carbonation. Not bad for a chocolate stout which I'm not always too crazy about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"-Too much hops making the beer more bitter than sweet."
"O: This is truly a chocolate tasting chocolate stout. Yet, since the chocolate has an unsweetened character it fits really well into really good oatmeal stout. The result of this combination is a pleasing blend and balance of unsweetened chocolate and dark roasted grains along with the some earthy and slightly spicy hops to add complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is pretty good as some nice complex flavors come out yet it doesn't overly excite, though it could pass for a ""milk/sweet stout."" I'd have this again."
""
""
"O - Good beer. Great beer, in fact. Just didn't deliver much on it's promise. Did it smell chocolatey? Oh yes. Did it taste chocolatey? ...perhaps. Same as most stout, it had that roasted, dark chocolate character. But unfortunately, it wasn't much of anything special. The smell was more exciting and new than the flavor, but the flavor still stood up as a strong, enjoyable stout. I will drink this again, but not when I'm in the mood for strong chocolate notes"

"O-I fully enjoyed this beer and is probably the only Rogue beer I would buy again because of their high prices, (not flavor) most of their beers are way over priced, but this one is worth every penny for sure. When I go to a friends house, I'm bringin' this one for dessert. Such a well done chocolate beer. Thanks Rogue for this offering"
""

""
""
""

"Overall, I love this brew.... One of the best flavored stouts I've ever had.... Leave it to Rogue, which is amongst my top 10 favorite brewers in America, to master a perfectly balanced chocolate stout in every way imaginable.... Once again, they cease to amaze."

""
""
""

"22 oz bomber pours a near opaque black with a fair amount of floaties, and more than adequate tan head and lacing. Aroma reminds me a lot of Whoppers (hmm, chocolate covered malted milk ball - makes sense). Taste is chocolately, with faint coffee and smoke flavors. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth - this almost drinks too fast. I'm usually a bit of a purist when it comes to flavored beers but this one is very well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The perfect beer for dessert, a great 'Mood"" beer. Not one to fit in a regular Stout rotation due to the sweet character of this one, but very enjoyable in the appropriate occasion. Also make a great surprise/change of pace, I think I'll gift a couple this year."

"This is one that is great for introducing people to beer, or at least helping them realize how diverse beer can be. It is also a great food beer, pairing well with chocolate, but also Ice Cream!"
"Rogue, you have changed my mind. Now my quest to emulate this brew at home begins."
""
""
""
"O-As advertised, this is a chocolate stout, and a good one at that. Is this the best chocolate stout out there? No, but if you want to sip on a dessert beer that won't bowl you over with ABV, this is a nice choice in complexity and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Too often I find that brewers like to hype their ""chocolate"" beers, but rarely do they deliver on actual chocolate flavor. This offering is one of the few chocolate beers that can be marked ""as advertised."""
""
"Complement this beer with a silent watching of Foxxy Brown movie while listening to Grace Jones singing La Vie en Rose and more of her techno punky miracles."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Although the flavor profile on this one was not quite what I was expecting, it's a unique change of pace from the usual Chocolate Stout. Would I drink it again? Probably not, an interesting beer but not one I feel the need to revisit."

"poured this from a bomber into a ""drink vermont beer"" pint glass. had a nice tan 2 finger head that receded to about a quarter inch. not very aromatic, but black as night. feel is good, medium bodied for a stout in my opinion. the taste is what really gets me. it tastes like a chocolate milk with far more chocolate than necessary. its fantastic. but really all chocolate and quite delicious definitely a chocoholics dream."
""
"Overall - Not bad. This is rated higher than southern tiers ""choklat", but overall, i think choklat does a better job of nailing what i would want out of a chocolate beer. This is definitely better than a lot of stouts advertised as chocolate stouts, and for the price, its pretty damn solid. I do love the vanilla flavor that compliments the chocolate and the lack of overly bitter malts to give it that easy drinking feel. All in all, I would say this is definitely one to take a stab at."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Pours dark brown to black with a dense chocolate brown head. Aroma is dense chocolate with a strange yet nice fruity note - towards berries. I pick up the same distinct berry note in the flavor too. Nicely roasted malt, bitter hops flavor and smooth yet slight dusty chocolate powdery flavor. Solid bitter and roasted finish. Strange with this distinct berry flavor, yet it is very pleasing."
""

"Overall a really good beer. One of my favorite Rogues. Perfect on a cold day in front of the fire. A definite winter warmer."
""
""
""
"This is a decent offering from Rogue, but not their best, and not outstanding overall. It's a nice use of chocolate, not too sweet. But the overall body could be more interesting."
"Acrid in its roast and sweet in its chocolate. Add to that some Pacman yeast and it falls apart at the seams. Lots of flavor that feels thin and flat."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very good stout with lots of chocolate flavor. Just a tad too bitter at the finish but still very delicious."
""
"Wonderful all around. Of course cocoa and bread, stone fruits (prune, cherry) and toffee. This was just great stuff on tap. I better try the bottle again..."
""
""
"Overall: This is an excellent stout overall. It's a bit too bitter of a finish for my liking, but still quite drinkable nonetheless."
"Everything here works in harmony to create a highly drinkable beer. My only regret is I wish it had more roasted malt bite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a fantastic dessert beer. It's like drinking Hershey's chocolate. The body and mouthfeel are spot on, and the flavor is almost perfect. The only drawback here is that I probably wouldn't want more than one bottle for myself at a time. That one bottle however will be plenty delicious."
"O: This isn't just a novelty beer like I assumed at first, but it's really good and solid. Although chocolate and stout isn't the most creative combination in the world, it is definitely done well in this one."
""
""
"Why the perfect overall score despite the imperfect mouthfeel? Because the imperfection is so slight, and because Rogue's Chocolate Stout is not only among the best Chocolate Stouts out there, it is also among the best beers I've ever had."

"O- A solid Amercan stout, not overwhelmingly good, but a very safe choice for any occasion calling for a dark beer. Would go great in the winter while watching the hockey game."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong of chocolate,a bit of malts. Taste is also very chocolatey, some malts, a touch of hop bitterness. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."

"O- Nice sweet stout with different chocolate notes in the taste and aroma. Great smooth mouthfeel too."
""
""
""
""
"O:  Rogue has created a nice chocolate stout that I could smell all day. The upsetting part is that it is not transferred to the taste so much. Heavy roasted barley fades the rich cocoa flavor. This does not create a total loss however for this stout is still rather tasty. This would be a great stout to have around Christmas time next to a crackling fire. "
""
"Kind of surprised with this one. Was expecting a creamier brew. This one is a standard American stout, done very well, but for me it doesn't totally live up to the name. The chocolate is there, but it's very bittersweet. I say baker's chocolate and really high percentage cacao bars. A whole different kind of bitter compared to hops, but quite bitter. No doubt it's a unique one, and a very good one, but as far as chocolate stouts go, Young's handily beats this one because it is brewed in the milk/sweet style, which I think lends itself better to the chocolate. I feel like I'm kind of underscoring it, but you get my point."
""
"O: This was quite a bit different than I expected. Not really a chocolate bomb like Choklat. I’d be more likely to pair it with a cigar than a dessert. I’m not in love with it, but I could easily see myself craving aspects of the flavor profile at some point down the road."
""
""
""
" This was a wonderful stout. I was expecting a little more sweetness, but the charred character was actually rather interesting. I can’t speak to what the cellar actually did for the beer, but it certainly didn’t seem to hurt anything."
""
"Creamy feel with a cocoa taste that lingers slighty bitter. Lacing just clings to the pint glass. Carbonation and the silk, i enjoy the mouthfeel. High drinkability even as it warms a bit. Not bad paired up with chocolate frozen yogurt and dark chocolate coffee beans, in this case (the latter especially blends in with the aftertaste, which seems of chocolaty coffee grinds to me). In the end, a burnt cocoa brew that is not too sweet and is very easy to drink. I want to try Rogue's double of this. "

"Ordered this on accident while eating at a favorite fondue restaurant. It poured a dark, velvety chocolate brown. The head was equally as velvety smooth, caramel color. Tastes like a dessert beer first and foremost. Malt, chocolate, and a slight, lingering hop are the noticeable flavors. Strongly recommend this beer with your chocolate fondue! Or red meat.."
""
""
""
""
"Review from 3/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red brown, nearly black with a nice white head and lacing. Chocolate and dark malt aroma. Light stout maltiness with some toasted and smoky malts, a bit dry. Nice start and middle, but dry thin finish with a bit of chocolate aftertaste. Thinner bodied than other stouts, but strong, pleasant chocolate flavor."

"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of chocolate malt, cocoa powder, chocolate syrup, and milk chocolate aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, char, unsweetened dark chocolate, cocoa powder, and raw cocoa nibs. There is a high level of roasty bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the flavor just doesn't match up to how good this one smells."

"22 ounce bottle into Rogue pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger dense mocha colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, toffee, caramel, molasses, roasted malt, vanilla, cream, and light herbal hops. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength; very dessert-like. Taste of chocolate, roasted malt, toast, oats, caramel, toffee, cream, light coffee, earth, and herbal hops. Fair amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toffee, toast, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness; with a good amount of chocolate flavor and roast. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a fairly creamy, silky, and lightly prickly mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is a very nice chocolate stout. Good roasted and chocolate flavors, with good balance of sweetness; and very smooth to drink."

"22fl oz bottle. ½ Pint glass. Renjoyed on may´12. Very dark brown color. Beige, lasting, small bubbled, creamy head. Hints of chocolate, fruity touch & yeast to the nose. Flavors show roasted malts & soft bitterness. Full body, moderate carbonation. Another shared beer with Juanjo –“the bread artist”- at Cerveceria Freiburg."

"Rogue Chocolate Stout, 22 oz bomber: The body is deep brown with a touch of translucence. The head is huge, dark in color, a wonder to behold. Aroma is massively chocolate. Once the head settles down, it’s time to dig in. Well, chocolate is the overpowering flavor. This makes for a nice dessert beer, but probably would not pair well with food. Other flavors come and go; coffee has some prominence. There is a bit of bitter to the aftertaste, surprise, like dark chocolate. Not a super thick brew, but not highly drinkable because of the strong chocolate flavor. I would love to try this brew fresh on tap someday. Overall it is a novelty beer worth a taste, but is too chocolaty to make the stable of great stouts that you look forward to trying again and again."

"O/D-This is a chocolate explosion in a glass. I truly enjoyed this brew. I liked it a lot more that Southern Tier's Choklat. I found this one to be more of a pure chocolate flavor. Really nice but one glass is enough because it is very rich."
"Beautiful darkest brown, big creamy chocolate head, lace, really good looking beer. Smells, what else, milk chocolate. Nice mix of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, roasted malts, even some hops leading to a nice bittersweet finish. Nice and creamy on the palate, at the end of a (too) long day, I would have preferred 16 oz serving though. I had a growler of their double chocolate once which was probably my favorite chocolate beer to date."

"Favorite beers (for comparison, after all taste preferences are subjective): Elysian's Daedalus Irish Stout, Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar, Allagash's White Ale, New Belgium's 1554, Full Sail's Wassail, etc. Beer styles I don't like: IPAs (with few exceptions)"

"Overall - By far the most complex, most satisfying chocolate stout I've ever had, and one of my all-time favorite beers. Everything about this beer is beautiful. If you're looking for sweet chocolate, then drink this one on the fairer side of warm; the bitterness is more predominant at colder temperatures."

"Pours pitch black with a large tan head and decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is chocolate, roast and cappucino. Taste is all about dark chocolate, bitter coffee and some sweet creaminess similar to a milk stout. Mouthfeel is full and drinkability is very good."

"A beautiful pour, rich deep color with chocolate brown head that laced and cling to the glass. The aroma was of a chocolate malt and the taste began chocolate and then had a cofee/tofee flavor. Nice hop balance and a delicious coffee aftertaste. Just a touch dry at the very end."

"Pours a deep brown cola color with a two finger frothy khaki colored head. The head stays for a decent amount of time and leaves some lines of lace on the glass. The aroma is of a roasty malt backbone with the aroma of bitter chocolate coming through as well. The taste has a roasty malt backbone with a bitter chocolate taste up front and in the middle. The back end has a milk chocolate sweetness to it. The mouthfeel is smooth and lowly carbonated. Overall it is a decent stout, not best in class but it is good for what it is suppose to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 2"" head of nice deep mocha, and with longer lifespan than you usually see in a dark beer. The body is black as coffee. Smell had roasted malt up front and chocolate more in the back. Taste was the reverse, rich on cocoa. There's a long bitter aftertaste more akin to unsweetened dark chocolate than bitters or roasted malt. All in all a quality chocolate product, and a decent beer."
""

"O: This is one of the best uses of chocolate in a beer I’ve had, especially in the nose. Though light and smooth, this stout is as rich and filling as ever. $0.30/ounce? I’d say that’s the perfect price for beer like this."
""
""
""
""
"O: I am not overly impressed with the stout. It is a nice chocolate stout, a sweet smell and dark chocolate taste provides some complexity and uniqueness, but it lacks something that I can't quite put my finger on. I just didn't love it and I would consider it a tad overrated given the scores on this site, but I would recommend giving it a try for sure."
"If you like chocolate then this is an obvious choice for a beer to drink. It's so chocolatey that it's almost like drinking some milk chocolate, though without the lactose taste. This beer just screams, ""Delicious chocolate!"" I do prefer stouts to have more body and more complexity in smell and taste but in this case the Chocolate Stout excels so well in being a CHOCOLATE stout."

"Poured a dark coffee with a mocha head of two fingers that slowly fades to a heavy patchwork lacing through out the experience. Dark chocolate and roasted coffee on the nose followed by taste of expresso beans in dark chocolate surprisingly not very sweet but a dry cocoa and rich maltyness. Also present in the mouth very rich with out the unnecessary sugars. One of the best overall chocolate stouts."
""
"Very excited to try this beer and it didn’t disappoint. Black, thick pour with a thick tan head. Aroma of chocolate, smoke, coffee. Chocolate flavor with some coffee and it is very smooth. Highly enjoyable! This is a mainstay in my fridge; enjoy it on all occasions."
""
"22oz bottle, pours jet black with a milk chocolatey head that holds good retention and leaves tons of lacing on the glass. Aromas are cocoa, chocolate Twizzlers, kind of musty, with hot chocolate powder. Tastes are chocolatey again, with molasses, oatmeal cookie, chocolate Twizzler again, with some hop on the finish that prickles the tongue. Mouth-feel is full-bodied, smooth and creamy, with a slight dryness on the finish with some dark cocoa powder. Overall, I have wanted to try this for years, but never did. It's good, but I'm not big on the artificial chocolate flavors I'm picking up here. Luckily it has so many other things going for it, that they can be ignored to a degree."

"Taste is bitter chocolate up front reminiscent of cocoa powder, followed by roasted malt with some sweet caramel notes. Bitter coffee is subtle and there is some bitter herb flavor from the hops. Finishes dry and crisp. An excellent beer, it has big chocolate flavor without being sickly sweet. Very nice."

"O: This is a solid chocolate stout. This happens to also be my first offering from Rogue. I'm not sure why I've not tried anything from them until now but that's how it goes. At $4.99, this is a good buy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good stout, the chocolate character is superb, and overall it is quite balanced. I will say however that the mouthfeel does not compliment the chocolate as well as it could. Perhaps a beer like this would benefit more by having a thicker body, maybe even getting the Imperial Stout upgrade. That is getting picky though, I could drink a bomber of this no problem, and would surely be sad when I see the bottom."

""
"Overall: I was hoping for more chocolate taste, but it was a warm and inviting stout, nonetheless. Not overpowering. A fine sipper."

"O: This will probably be my last review of a beer brewed by Rogue. Whether it's the quality of the brew, or the house yeast-strain, I know that they don't push my buttons."

"This stood up against tastings of Stone's Double Bastard and Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout today, and came out the best of these three titans of great beer today. A new favorite. I hope to experience many more times to come. I will buy this again and again. This will be nigh impossible to beat according to this palate."

"O: Love how the hops complement the chocolatey goodness. Good lacing and mouthfeel too. I preferred this over the Harpoon."
"Poured a dark brown-black with a minimal tan head; no lacing to speak of. Milk chocolate in the aroma and a bit of roastiness. Taste of bakers' chocolate, sweet, but powdery, more subtle hints of coffee and nutshells, with a little bitterness in the finish to offset the sweetness. Mouthfeel was smooth, but a little light for the style, I thought. Still a nice drinker overall."

"Overall- This beer smells like... heaven... I mean the delicate balance of malt, sugar and creamy chocolate is incredible. However, the taste of the beer is comparatively average in my opinion. All that wonderful flavor is overwhelmed with a bit too much bite for my taste. The Hazelnut Brown Nectar is the exact opposite, not as rich or full of a smell, but a much smoother finish. Id recommend that over the chocolate stout any day."
""
""
"This is my new favorite beer, period. I absolutely love everything about it, it is a perfect chocolate stout. I usually favor high IBU India Pale Ales, specifically double IPAs. This beer has single handedly broadened my horizons and become my new favorite. Om Kali Ma"

"Super dark pour with a nice deep tan head. Smells overwhelmingly of chocolate, in a fantastic sort of chocolate-factory type of thing. Tastes just like you'd expect, rich and amazingly chocolate in nature, super thick. That's pretty much the dominant flavor, so if you're not looking for that steer clear. Lasts quite a while on the palate, fantastic brew."

"Sampled on December 24, 2011. The pour is nice and dark to nearly black with a long lasting, foamy brown head. Loads of chocolate malts on the aroma with a slight hoppy character on the backside. But the chocolate is the more powerful aroma. The body was a lot thinne than I imagined and I found that to be a disappointment. The taste is full of chocolate with an obvious hopped bitterness toward the end that lingers on the palate. There are chocolate stouts that I like better than this one."
""
"Overall Drinkability - Amorphous on the palate. I started off liking it, then decided after several sips that it wasn't all that great after all. Few more sips and I thought it was brilliant. I haven't ever had this hard of a time coming up with an overall score for a beer. Definitely an interesting brew. Worth trying."

"Pours a very deep dark black with a 1.5 finger head, and beautiful lacing. The smell is smooth chocolate with mild roast on the back end. It's easy on the mouth with smooth chocolate taste, with a little roasted bit bite at the end. This is a very good chocolate stout with repeat drinkability. If you don't like stouts or never had one this is a must."

"O: despite what sounds like a negative review, i didn't hate this beer. it had an enjoyable, unique smell (one of the most chocolaty smellin' beers i've ever had) and an easy-on-the-palate taste; the appearance and smell just got my hopes up. i was expecting a trip down memory lane when i used to put entirely too much chocolate in my milk when no one was looking."
"pretty damn crisp and and sweet but not too overpowering"
"Poured an espresso brown with a dark rich head. Aromas were strong - especially the bitter chocolate. Flavors were rich dark malts, more bitter chocolate and subtle wood flavors. Full bodied flavors with a finish that lasts - this was a great one. Terrific dessert beer!"
"O - Perfect for a stout fix. Not many I would take over this at this ABV range."

"Poured a dark black, very dark indeed. Subtle mocha colored head which left traces on the glass. Smelled of cocoa, coffee, and smoke. Taste was not dominated by chocolate at all, which was a relief. Nice balance of malts, with the cocoa becoming noticeable after swallowing. I've had chocolate stouts before and was disappointed. Not with this. One of the best of its kind out there."

"Poured into a standard pint glass. This beer is a beautiful rich dark chocolate black color. A dark tan creamy head sits on top and takes a long while to dissipate to a thinner film. Thick sheets of sticky lacing. The beer smells of rich bitter chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is exceptional, with dark bitter chocolate being dominant. Roasted malts abound. The mouthfeel is awesome, because it's thick enough, unlike some stouts that can be watery. Overall, this is pretty much what I'll compare all other chocolate stouts to. It's not cloyingly sweet or watery like all of the others I've had. It's delicious and very drinkable."

"O: Not the first time I have had this beer, and hopefully not the last. It's easy drinking and smooth with a nice flavor profile. Like the chocolate presence of course."
"Overall, a very good stout. I expected the chocolate to overpower the beer but it's actually very balanced and really just adds to the stout flavor profile. It's not just a sweet chocolate beer, there is a very solid roasted flavor that balances with the chocolate."
"Overall - An excellent chocolate stout from Rogue. Great balance of bitterness and chocolatey sweetness. The initial aromas certainly lure you in to this beer!"
"Definitely worth seeking out. One of the better Chocolate Stouts available. This is the definition of the style, if a bit strong on the ABV given the BJCP guidelines."
"O: Once again, Rogue does not disappoint. This is certainly one of the better stouts I have had. The chocolate is perfectly placed. It is noticeable, but not overpowering. I highly recommend this one and will be picking it up myself occasionally, as it is always available."
"O: This was exquisite, to say the least. Rogue Ales is rapidly becoming a favorite of mine, and I must say that I'm looking forward to my next beer from this outstanding brewery."
"O: Only the second chocolate beer I've ever tried. I like Sam Adams's Chocolate Bock better, but then, I like bocks better than stouts to begin with."
"Pours pretty black with a creamy two finger tan head. Tons of tiny bubbles in the head. Aroma is mostly bittersweet chocolate with trace amounts of espresso. Smells really nice. The taste is along the same lines as the smell, but much more bitter than I expected (which isn't a bad thing). This reminds me of a higher cocoa percentage chocolate bar. Mouthfeel is a bit disappointing as it is pretty thin. The carbonation is a little too high for the style, but isn't off-putting. Overall, very nice stout. This isn't as much of a dessert beer as you'd might expect. There is not a lot of sweetness here and the body is also lighter than you would expect.I would have liked to have seen a little more sweetness to help balance out the bitterness. This isn't an absurdly bitter beer, but I tend to like some sweetness in my chocolate beer. Good stout and highly recommended."
"O: The first taste of this beer was all chocolate. As I drank more I picked up more on the roasted malt flavors towards the back with a slight bitterness at the end. The chocolate flavor lasts throughout. Very enjoyable and very drinkable chocolate stout."
"For what I spent on this bomber (emphasis on ""bomb"") I could have grabbed a 6-pack of satisfying Schlitz Tallboys and a chocolate bar. You're damn right I don't give a Schlitz for this."
"O - Try it. You won't be disappointed!"
"Overall – One of the better chocolate beers I've had so far. The burnt/bitter aftertaste adds a nice dynamic to the beer. Worth seeking out in my opinion."
" ~ This is a solid beer in all categories... except the drinkability. I think this is a beer that needs the right place and the right time to really be enjoyed. I would definitely recommend it to a friend and would try it again but I think this is one that should be sipped slowly while sitting alone quietly in front of a fireplace on a cold winter night. It's too sharp for breakfast and not sweet enough for dessert."
"This brew looks good, it's a nice deep brown color with a large head. The smell is that of just an everyday stout. And the taste is that too. I mean, it's really just straight up Guinness Extra Stout-esque, in both taste and (thin) body. It's not bad, but get Guinness Extra Stout and save four bucks."
"O- Only slightly above average. Good for the style. I like Rogue alot, maybe this one isnt as fresh as id like but i can only rate this on what i have in front of me, it is what it is."
" Chocolate Stout by Rogue. A beer that i didn't think that would be like this. A perfect chocolaty, sweet and bitter. A beer that takes you from all the chocolates that have you taste to any chocolate beer that have you try. This beer is the BEST CHOCOLATE BEER on the market."
"Mouthfeel: Weak for the style and taste, but not disappointing."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I think the draft is almost as good as the bottled version, which is saying something. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall, this is a really tasty beer and good on almost any occasion!"
"This is a good, tasty beer and one that I wouldn't mind having again."
"Verdict: Really fantastic chocolate stout, we put vanilla and raspberry ice cream in it to make a beer float which made it even more interesting. Great desert beer."
"Pours a near ink black with an extremely thick dark brown cap. Great retention with loads of lace. The aroma is of semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. This is pretty straightforward. The flavor profile mimics the nose. Semi-sweet bakers chocolate up front before a pleasant roast and coffee flavor take over. The finish is more of a cocoa powder, granular type of feel. A bit syrupy, full bodied. Smooth, with just that bit of granulation in the finish. Overall, this is a solid stout. It definitely hits its mark."
"O) A very good stout with chocolate profiles that don't overwhelm the overall character of the beer. Will definitely be picking this one up again."
"Overall: I've always wanted to try this one and I'm glad I did. Not as intense as Choklat. This beer is exactly what is says it is. I'd have another."
"Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. Overall a great stout. I could drink a bunch of this. I am really enjoying my trip through the top hundred beers of fame."
"Overall: A superior stout that is brimming with bold flavor. An outstanding beer."
"This pours a pitch black color with a decent mocha colored head, but with large bubbles which quickly dissipate down to a thin layer, its a good looking beer but I prefer the look of the stouts with a nice frofty bubbled head (the one with the dense thin bubbles). The smell was pretty good, chocolate with roasted malts. The feel was good medium to thick, although it was also a little grimy and gritty. The taste left something to be desired though. The main taste was an artificial gritty/dirty/grimy chocolate flavor maybe like a Hersey chocolate syrup (the stuff you pour into milk), it was a little too sweet and I didn't get the normal roasted malt bitterness, just this grimy sweetness (gone are the great dark chocolate flavors). You could probably take a Guinness draft and load Hershey's Chocolate syrup into it and get basically the same poor taste. Overall this was decent, but I'd take a Brooklyn Chocolate Stout over this one every time (and they cost less). I definitely don't understand why this is rated so high."
"This beer punches well above its weight. It drinks like a much bigger stout than its 6% ABV - super flavorful, potent, and rich. I'm impressed."
"Overall, another favorite stout! Perfect for an unexpectedly cool fall evening."
"This beer poured out as a pretty nice looking dark brown color. The head was mocha colored and left a little bit of lacing on the glass. The smell of this beer was actually pretty nice, It gave off a pleasant sweet milk chocolate aroma with a touch of roasted malts in there too. The flavor was pretty good, I enjoyed the slight bitterness it had in the back end after all the sweetness faded. The mouthfeel like most Rogue ales to me seemed a little on the thin side. Overall it's not a terrible brew but could have used a little more body I think."
"This beer is way more bitter than I remember. It's still a good beer which I will probably get again sometime."
"This is quite simply the best use of chocolate I have ever experienced in a beer. Will buy anytime I see it."
"Overall give this beer an A- would recommend trying it"
"Overall: An outstanding American Stout with tons of flavor. Very drinkable at a modest 6% ABV. I could easily have a few of these in one sitting. This clearly sets the benchmark for an American Stout. My favorite style is the RIS, which tends to be too heavy to enjoy more than one. This is kind of like RIS baby brother. Well done Rogue!!!"
"O - Overall, this is one delicious stout, and one I can definitely see myself coming back to during the upcoming fall and winter months. Well done Rogue!"
"O - excellent. A must try for any chocolate lover. Lacking the splendid head but nonetheless on par with my gold standard: Youngs Double Chocolate Stout."
"O: A pretty good chocolate stout. Only available in 22 oz bottles makes impractical as an everyday stout."
"D: sort of one-note with all the chocolate, but it is still a very tasty, unique brew. not complaining about the note it's singing at all. after having their hazelnut and chocolate, im looking forward to just about anything else from rogue."
"D: Very nice stout that I would likely have again. However, my expectations were perhaps a little too high for this, as I was expecting a bit more complexity. Still a pleasing Rogue offering that I will likely be revisiting in the future."
"Not as much chocolate as the name suggests. Just a lot of roasted malt. I held off on reviewing this beer because I had it out of a 22oz. bomber a few years ago and have had it on draft a few times since and have been disappointed. I still find myself disappointed. When this is straight from the tap, it's cold and doesn't have much flavor. When I let it warm up...it just became a typical stout. Nothing special."
"Based on rep I thought this one would drink like a chocolate shake so to speak. Full disclosure, after kbs and to a lessor degree southern tiers chokolat, maybe I'm ruined. Still with less alcohol I anticipated a quaffer. A tasty stout but no standout IMO."
"I will surely buy another. "
"Overall, a wonderful chocolate dessert stout, very drinkable for such a rich beer."
"D - Good dessert drink; nice blend of chocolate and coffee flavors"
"On the tongue, the chocolate taste is *very* apparent--more so than perhaps any other chocolate stout I've tried. In fact, the brew tastes, in many ways, like sucking on a Tootsie Pop while sipping on, say, Godiva's chocolate liqueur. Which is not to say that it's bad in any way; in fact, it's quite good. And I don't normally like chocolate stouts. There are, of course, other flavors in the beer as well: some nice chocolate malts that give a lovely almost-burnt-grain taste; some deep caramels; and just at the edge, perhaps a hint of dark fruit esters. Hops are kept to a minimum, and are just enough to add a nice bitterness that takes the edge off of the sweetness of the chocolate. But make no mistake: chocolate is the primary flavor. It's the first thing you'll taste, and the flavor that will linger on your tongue the longest."
"Overall: This is a special-occasion beer. And by that I mean it's for when you want something really dark and hearty. (Also, it's not cheap.) But when you're in that mood, this thing will NOT disappoint. A very bold beer."
"The flavors get back a little as it warms. But could can wait for it to warm?"
"O: For a beer that is literally available everywhere, you can't go wrong here. If you're looking for something to blow you away, keep going."
"O - Wow! I am very impressed with this beer. Everything about it is excellent. I can see how any hop-head would find this disappointing due it's it's slight break from the style (less hoppy, less boozy), but can't wait to drink another bottle. I usually have trouble finishing a bomber of stout by myself, but i have no issues with this one."
"I guess this beer can be regarded like lots of visiting family members: they're great at first, but then they just become nagging."
"O - Overall this is an average chocolate stout in my mind. It has much more intense flavor than most American Stouts, but the flavor is too tightly focused and honestly not too exciting because of it. A fine beer, but I certainly won't pay the 6-7 dollars it costs to get a bomber of it here. Perhaps if I lived in Portland again I could give it another shot."
"Bottle from Beers of Europe. At £7 something per bottle here in N Ireland, I won't be buying too many of these but had to try it out... A fair bit of body with this stout, frothy tan head with excellent lacing on the pint glass. Smells of bittersweet chocolate, bitter coffe, pepper, roasty walnuts evident. I get alot of the walnut taste with this, a little chocolate, very earthy and its getting more earthy / roasty as this pint glass ends. Aftertaste is fairly bitter and nutty. I expected this a bit sweeter but a fine beer to relax with and watch a movie. At 650ml per bottle, when you have finished your pint you have a few more litres to look forward to!! Very pleasent."
"In terms of mouthfeel, the chocolate cuts the aftertaste I expect from a stout, and I like it."
"Pours nearly black with a thin brown head and thin lace. Milky dark chocolate is forefront in the nose with toasted malt underneath. Taste is very chocolatey throughout. Nice roasted malt on the middle with a dry finish.Thick, milky, lightly carbonated mouthfeel. The milky chocolate comes through strong in the aftertaste. Thickness does not impede the drinkability. Very good. I'm a fan of the chocolate stouts, and this is an excellent example and the most chocolatey I've had. At $4.49 a bomber, this will be my go-to stout for a while."
"O: This is a very drinkable, easy to like beer."
"O: Very decent stout for the chocolate lover. Lacks the body I would like in a stout though still decent."
"Excellent, easy to down, mild mannered, sweet and chocolately dessert stout. Not too rich, not too roasty, just right and delicious."
"O - I can understand why this is a top rated stout. The flavours are perfectly balanced and offer a great balance between sweetness and dark roasted stout. I could drink this stuff all day."
"Roots"
"The booze, hops, sweetness and viscosity of this beer are all pretty low, allowing the bittersweet chocolate flavor and aroma to come to the fore. Well done."
"Overall, good but not particularly complex or unique. Even after allowing it to warm for a while, not much changes. I've had several chocolate stouts and this one doesn't really stand out. But not bad either."
"Overall: Incredible! This is a delectable treat that should be enjoyed on any cold, misty evening. Cheers to Rogue for successfully crossbreeding a hot chocolate and a beer at the same time. The only quarrel I have with this beer is its overwhelming drinking factor. Simply put, it's so rich that I could never have an entire bottle on my own. Due to this, this is a good brew to share amongst friends and acquaintances as a wonderful aperitif - or a good replacement for an after-meal espresso."
"Edited to add .5 to the taste and mouthfeel because as you drink it seems to get smoother."
"Fairly light mouthfeel that is very drinkable. Excellent brew!"
"O - Good beer. I could have two bottles this size with my more enlightened friends; three might make the conversation a bit sloppy. This would be spot-on perfect with a well-grilled steak."
"The mouthfeel doesn't detract much from this beer. It's nearly perfect. Chocolate lovers all over the world need to be introduced to this beer."
"O: very nice and flavorful chocolate beer, full flavored"
"O: I honestly haven't enjoyed the vast majority of rogue beers I've had before but this one caught me off guard. It's not mind blowing, had some small flaws, and none of the tastes were entirely unfamiliar, but for a non-imperial stout I give this high marks."
"O: Great chocolate stout! Beautifully balanced and flavored. I’m a fan."
"O- I enjoyed this beer immensely. It's similar in some ways to the Shakespeare Stout (especially the mouthfeel/carbonation). I like the fact that even though it definitely is a Chocolate stout, the flavoring is balanced and mild enough so that you can drink this without it feeling like you're drinking dessert. I also appreciate the fact that they were able to avoid it getting into mocha/coffee territory - not that I don't enjoy the coffee taste, but it is somewhat commonplace for stouts of this nature to rely too heavily on coffee to cover the alcohol bite. This is a beer that accomplishes it's style with flying colors. I will definitely be coming back to this one."
"Thinner medium body, decent carbonation, a bit sticky and lingering on the palate. A drinkable, well flavored chocolate stout, but not necessarily a favorite of mine."
"Pours dark with a nice beige head. Good look. Chewy full chocolaty aroma. Some dark roast coffee. Pours opaque black smallish tan head. Long deep milk chocolate finish. Hop bitterness tempers the residual sweetness. Overall, a very fine beer indeed, and I would recommend."
"D- Good to split a bottle, maybe the whole one on a longer night. good tastes but the flavors stick on the palate so it would fatigue taste after a couple."
"Overall, very good. I'm glad I was able to try it."
"All in all this is a pretty darn good beer. It is well crafted and definitely has some good chocolate flavors. I picked it up largely because I knew it was highly rated, but found that it did not really stick out that much to me. Perhaps I am just used to the crazy chocolate flavors found in some other newer beers like ST Chokolat, but this one just did not blow me away."
"But overall I'd have to give this beer props for what it does. It is a quality chocolate stout that sits on every bodega shelf. It exposes people to a new style, and it's become a go-to beer for my close friend who doesn't drink them. Plus it's affordable. There's a lot to be said for those qualities in a brew, and so I've got to notch up the ""overall"" rating to a 4.0, where otherwise it might be around a 3 out of 5. Cheers to Rogue, keep doing what you do!"
"O: It’s good, maybe even very good, but not great. The amazing milk chocolate characters that are present in the aroma never really comes out in the drink, which is pretty disappointing. The taste just doesn’t live up to the nose."
"This beer is made with Harrington, Klages, Cascades and Crystal hops. Imported chocolate and rolled oats creates a beyond wonderful flavor. Ebony on color with a rich creamy head. An earthy flavor of oats and hops that gives way to a rich chocolate truffle-ish finish. The flavor changes with the temperature to develop from more chocolate to more malts. Yum! This is a go-to beer."
"O: This is a really nice beer. 4.5"
"O - This has good drinkability. I could have a few glasses of these in a sitting. Overall I thought it was a really tasty stout, and it definitely makes a great desert beer. I enjoyed it, and would buy it again. I recommend trying it."
"O: Everything seems to go great until the taste, then things don't go so well. I think the flavor is a bit one-dimensional and fails to highlight the chocolate as adverted. The body is thin and forgetful. Not a beer of fame for me."
"Overall: This is a very good chocolate stout that is something you can have when you want a strong chocolate flavor without the heavy body of an imperial stout. This is a lighter stout but it is tasty and balanced."
"O- Really good, I didn't think there would be such a strong chocolate presence but it was perfect. I will be getting this again."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. I've had and thoroughly enjoyed the Double Chocolate offering from Rogue, so I figured I'd give this a try finally. The beer pours a nice, viscous looking jet black with a thick, dense, foamy milk-chocolate colored head. Aromas are heavy in milk chocolate, with only the slightest hint of bitter coffee. It's like someone poured a splash of coffee into a chocolate milkshake. The beer is mid-bodied; a little light and crisp, but still fairly smooth in mouth. The flavor is a blend of dark chocolate bitterness and milk chocolate sweetness. Can't really go wrong with that in this house...I am a fat kid with a wicked sweet tooth! The coffee highlights are minimal, but present, and they peek their head out towards the aftertaste portion of your experience. Bitterness in the aftertaste does a good job of balancing all the sweetness throughout and closing the door on a very wonderful beer experience overall. The finish is smooth on the flavor and crisp in the body. Once again, very well balanced. This is a strong showing from the Rogue Brewery!"
"Overall: Truly one of my favorite American Stouts... I have tried so many, especially this past winter, and this one just always rises to the top."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Not a lot of carbonation and it adds to the smoothness of this beer. To me it is pretty mild but is still able to pack in a lot of flavor."
"Over all this is an interesting beer that surprised me. I am glad I tried it but I was expecting a bit more."
"O - Was nice to have a big bomber stout that didn't knock me on my butt from the high abv. Will seek this out again when I'm looking for an easy and smooth stout. Fair price too."
"Pours a deep dark brown with little head into snifter, and settles into light lace. Initial aromas of chocolate and malt. On first sip you can taste the chocolate and hops with light carbonation. Well balanced across the palate and not too heavy on the chocolate flavor. Overall, a smooth stout. Look forward to having it again."
"Overall not a bad beer but doesn't stand much chance against nicer chocolate stouts such as convict hill."
"EDIT: decided to pull out a dark chocolate fudge brownie to pair with it. holy crap...so freaking delicious. the bitterness of the beer begs for a bite of the sweet brownie, which then necessitates a sip of the brew. match made in heaven."
"from the bottle to my glass it poures black with brown highlights around the edges and a two finger milk chocolate colored head. the smell up front was chocolate followed by a slight roasted smokeyness with more chocolate. taste was sweet malts at first followed by bitter dark chocolate. nice and thick on the tongue with a smokey bitterness in the back of your mouth. awesome stout cant wait to try again."
"O- A well made stout. It basically boils down to if you're a purist about the whole chocolate thing. I for one think it turned out splendidly. Near the top of the stout ladder for me."
"O: great stout, one of my favorites."
"Pours dark brown with a fluffy tan head and some sediment. Aroma is basically just sweet chocolate, can't smell much else. Not a fan of the taste, it's mostly chocolate cocoa and a little burnt coffee. Mouthfeel is a little light but decent enough. Overall this one was a let down, I'd prefer it if it wasn't completely dominated by the chocolate."
"Pours beautifully black with a big chocolate colored head that's makes good use of the oats in the beer and sticks all the way down the glass. The smell is a strong chocolate/cocoa smell, enjoy it, don't look for much else. The taste is pretty light, as is the body, which is an unfortunate surprise after seeing and smelling it. It's a chocolate taste, with the roasted malts very noticeable, finishing bitter. This beer is very good, but isn't quite perfected yet."
"What was a pretty sweet and rich beer on the nose wasn't quite so on the tongue. Despite that, it's a solid beer for the style even if I was hoping for a more decadent beer (a la Young's)."
"O- Absolutely delicious. It really keeps it simple, when they say chocolate they mean it. It's brewed with actual chocolate and by the time I finished my glass some chocolate ""sediment"" had settled on the bottom. Surprisingly drinkable, I didn't have any problem killing a bomber of this on my own."
"HV"
"M - Not quite as thick as I would hope for a stout. I know that's not a do-or-die characteristic, but it's something I hope for! Nice bright carbonation that compliments the dark character of the beer."
"Really good but this is my preferred style so perhaps a bit biased."
"This is one of those Rogue beers that I only try once in a blue moon but it never ceases to impress me. My wife always exclaims that ""it tastes like a liquid tootsie roll!"" and I'm inclined to agree. This is one of the few Chocolate Stouts out that there really brings those rich chocolate flavors to the table and then some!"
"Overall, a good beer. A bit muted for the style, but it's still a pretty good example."
"D- While it was decent overall, I probably won't be having it again."
"It paired well with dessert but wouldn't consider as a session beer or anything outside of a dinner/dessert beer."
"O: Paired extremely well with some dark chocolate almonds I was eating with; great dessert drink that's for sure. My uncle asked me whose drink *this* was; I offered a taste; he said it was good; I offered the rest to him and he took me up on my offer. Good stuff!"
"My hat is off to Rogue...."
"Great beer. Enjoy it as a tasty dessert."
"Pours a black. I could see no penetrating light making its way through the bottle. A very dark head. A milk chocolate colored head. Smells of roasted malts, some bitter chocolate, honey even. Taste is a understated roasted malt combined with some charred notes. Has some carbonation which takes a little away for me. This is a very solid stout, but not my favorite."
"D - I was hoping for a little a wee bit better for only 6% ABV, but a great Stout overall."
"I really need to find this on tap as I expect it to be rather reasonably priced. That said this is exceptional beer. While I miss the intense power and weight of the double chocolate, but the hop flavors here are just exceptional and really add a lot of the beer."
"D: A true dessert stout with built-in chocolate companion flavors to boot. The 6% ABV is unnoticeable beneath the sometimes sickeningly sweet chocolate malt flavor. However, I'm partial to chocolate desserts, so I really enjoyed it. Be sure to drink your Ovaltine!"
"Good beer and even better on the nitro tap. Looks absolutely beautiful with a dark brown 1 inch head. The nitro adds a certain amount to the aroma and gives it a wonderfully smooth texture. Lots of chocolatey flavor and aroma. A solid stout that goes down easy and is just lovely."
"D - Easily the best chocolate stout I have had, and very easy to drink. I would get it if you want a chocolate stout that tastes like chocolate."
"Overall - I'd say this is one of my favorite stouts to date right up there with Samuel Smith's Stouts (which I haven't reviewed here yet /runs to store...) anyway go pick this up if you haven't already."
"First time trying the Rogue Chocolate Stout, and it is one of the better stout out there. It has a bit of a bitter-chocolate taste, though I wished it had a bit more sweetness to the taste (personal preference). The beer pours a dark brown with a generous light brown head that laces very nicely. I can't wait to purchase another bottle!"
"I didn't expect to be so thoroughly convinced, but I am. Rogue earned my trust tonight."
"D: Delicious and smooth character makes for a sipper at first but then you just can't help but want more."
"Overall, a solid brew and my favorite stout (and beer)from rogues"
"Pours a very dark brown with a one finger head that quickly goes away. I can smell malt, chocolate and hops. Not a very strong smell though. Taste is nice- chocolate, malt, and hops prevail. Mouthfeel is like drinking a chocolate beer milkshake. Very smooth and silky, with a dry hoppy finish. This one goes down real easily. Nice beer. Not super impressed, but it's good. Glad I got to try this one."
"Try this beer - you won't be disappointed."
"D- I must say this beer is exceptional. Very good and its a good price for what it is. This beer is very drinkable and tasty. This beer would definitely go fantastic with a streak or have it on its own for dessert or better yet pair it with chocolate cake."
"Oh...my....God. Ive never tasted a chocolate stout like this. The first taste. Incredible. Beautiful tasty chewy. It doesnt get any better. Great head clings all the way through. Beautiful color. A beer milk shake! Great for dessert or just drinking by itself. Ample 22oz bottle presents well like all rogue products. Hops low but present enough to counteract chocolate. Fantastic! I want more!"
"A beautiful looking pour. Nice thick tan head that sticks around forever. Excellent lacing. Very dark beer. Smells and tastes of chocolate and some roasted malts. Creamy, milky. Very well balanced, nothing overpowering. A great session beer or one to enjoy for dessert."
"D-This is one of my favorite beers in this style. This is like a wonderful desert at the end of a great dinner. WOuld use this as a finishing beer any night of the week! Great beer"
"Chocolate + Beer, does it get any better than that! This beer is easy to drink, very smooth. For me there was no bitter after taste. By the end of the beer it did get warm and was not as tasty as it was first opened, nice and cold. I do like Stouts a little heavier than this one. But all in all I very much enjoyed it and would buy it anytime!"
"Saw this on tap at a local restaurant, and had never tried it. Sampled it beforehand so I didn't have to commit fully, but I am certainly glad I did. Came out almost black, with a tan 2 finger head. As soon as I picked up the pint glass I smelled the chocolate--very sweet smelling. After tasting, however, i was pleasantly surprised at the taste--more of a bittersweet chocolate. I only had one, as it was a quick meal, but it certainly could have been more--the alcohol was barely noticeable, and it was not nearly as heavy as other stouts. Next time, I'll try to pair it more appropriately with food (pizza was an odd choice), but I am guessing that will not be too far in the future."
"This is bar far the best stout I have had, and everywhere I go I make an attempt to try any stout I find. The beer pours up with a monstrous tan head, maybe 2-3 fingers, with a pitch black body. The mouth feel is very creamy like, fairly thick but good. Taste is what you would expect, dark chocolate, coffee, the smokey aftertaste, not too much though. I have had many ""chocolate stout"" beers and this one is one the the few I have had that really has the feel taste of chocolate. Overall this beer is one of my go to stouts anytime, awesome beer!"
"Awesome overall beer. Not overly coffee-like, as many stouts are. Smooth chocolately goodness in every sip. Deep flavouring that leaves a smooth after taste. Just a hint of overall hoppage, but definitely noticeable throughout the sip. The only way to describe smell is to chock it up as a combination of a Starbucks and The Hershey Chocolate factory. Warming, smooth, and full bodied. Easy to drink, even for a heavy duty stout."
"This was a very good stout, much lighter than I would expect making it easier to drink."
"T: Not as sweet as the smell suggests. Bittersweet chocolate with a slight hoppiness coming through the middle. A hard finish of bittersweet chocolate works well. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth."
"Goes down smooth. Perfect as an after-dinner drink with dessert."
"D: Easy to drink but rather pedestrian to my tastes. Something shy of World Class IMHO."
"D: Nearly 100% perfect. Right there with Surly Coffee Bender and Tallgrass Buffalo Sweat."
"The taste starts with a slight carbonation. The carbonation builds to reveal a sweet velvet feel. A milk chocolate flavor with a roasted finisht showcases a great mouth on this beer."
"This beer was a great choice after a nice meal on valentines and Ill have to pick it up again sometime in the future."
"I highly recommend this beer if you are a fan of dark beers, it really is liquid gold. Awesome Beer."
"Be warned-- this beer should be enjoyed on it's own. I can't think of a dish, besides chocolate mousse that this beer would complement."
"Another revisiting from me during this stretch. It pours a garnet-tinged black-brown topped by a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises, you guessed it, chocolate, along with some seemingly obligatory roasted malts. The taste merely sprinkles on the cocoa powder while simultaneously skimping on the roast as well. And, unfortunately, just like the smell, there ain't nuthin' else happenin' up in here. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, despite this being easy to drink, I really don't have much of an inclination to do so. It's not really bad (meaning offensive), but it's far from very good."
"Updated 18 November 2011. Bumped up appearance and mouthfeel scores. Everything else still applies. Overall, this is a fine brew."
"Drinkability: Had some fresh and not so fresh bottles in town check your drink by dates! I love coming back to this one, but have been disappointed a couple times when I purchased an older bottle without realizing."
"Great chocolate in this beer, very mocha-like and just delicious. Fairly dry and not too sweet which helps drinkability."
"D - Had it on-tap a few days ago and the chocolate characteristics were a lot more prominent, so the bottled version is a little disappointing. Still a pretty solid stout though."
"D: I honestly didn't think I could drink so much of this beer and still want more. I drank most of the bomber by myself, and was a bit bummed when it ran out. A superb marriage of chocolate and beer - highly recommended."
"Verdict - I personally couldn't find what was so special about this stout. One of the less impressive chocolate stouts I've had. As I said, perhaps my bottle was a little old."
"So it's officially my birthday now, but it was officially my coworker's birthday a few minutes ago when this beverage started to be consumed by him. Being that we have to be at work in about 8 hours, he decided, against my better judgment, that he needed to start making the walk up the hill to better prepare himself for the morning. I'm still not sure what this was all about. But, it was a free beer. As it sat for 23 seconds unmanned, I pondered my course of action. I was then able to determine that this was clearly an early birthday present from John Maier himself in some sort of misguided attempt to assuage me into liking Rogue beers. I obliged him. The milky chocolate dominates the beer, at first a delightful treat fading into a cloying sweet Nesquik chocolate drink. It smells great, thick chocolate rising into the air. But the chocolate is compromised somehow. It is no Theo's chocolate, a thing of pure glory. Sort of a fake chocolate luster. ""Natural chocolate flavoring."" What was wrong with chocolate? Too chocolatey? Not chocolatey enough? Whatever, it is what it is. Just a thick and sweet malty brew, not awful, not undrinkable, just not worth spending my money on. Sorry, John, I tried again..to be continued..(next season)"
"I am not exactly blown away by this, but maybe just a little disappointed. However, it does seem right for the style so I can't say this is something I wouldn't drink again or would even pan. It does some things quite well."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into an imperial pint glass. Pours a rich black, with a small tan head. Major milk chocolate aroma, reminds me of hot chocolate sitting in a mug that hasn't been heated up yet. Flavors are huge chocolate notes and sweetness, touch of roasted malt flavor and smoke. Touch of bitterness on the finish, with a creamy mouthfeel. A very balanced, full flavored stout. There's a reason that this is (currently) the top rated American Stout on BeerAdvocate."
"(D)- Certainly a solid stout. A bit too sweet and chocolatey to have glass after glass of, but a great idea for dessert."
"Verdict: Unique and robust, but not worth the price. Novelty only."
"Great offering from Rogue, I've always enjoyed this one. If you're looking for a chocolate bomb, this is a perfect place to start. Recommended!"
"Mouthfeel was thick and smooth, although a bit thinner than the other stouts I've reviewed recently. Drinkability was phenomenal, as the abv somehow yielded so much taste that I don't know how they did it. Really awesome, affordable beer."
"Overall, this is a SOLID stout from Rogue we have here. Not imperial in ABV, but the smells and tastes are great for a normal stout. I would definitely reach for this one again."
"This is truly a world-class beer, and impossibly affordable too! Major kudos to Rogue."
"I must confess it took me while to try this beer. I'm not usually a fan of chocolate stouts, they seem to have too cloying a taste for me. Rogue's chocolate stout surprised me with it's ability to bring the chocolate up front without hitting me over the head with it. Go ahead and read the other reviews to get an idea about pourability, aroma, taste, etc. I'm going to go ""outside the box"" and offer a suggestion. Try mixing Rogue Chocolate Stout with Rogue Hazelnut Nectar Ale. Drop me a line; let me know what you think."
"Feels great. Smooth without feeling too thick. Quite drinkable but not amazing."
"Overall I'm digging this although I don't think it's the best American Stout I've ever had. I would recommend and I would drink again."
"The first sip was very big and full, almost creamy. The chocolate taste was balanced with the beer itself. I did wish, however, that the ABV would be somewhat higher so I could also enjoy the stout itself. The chocolate was the ruling king when it came to tasting this beer."
"Black. Blacker then black. Even when held to light. Pours a big head, that fades to about an eighth of an inch that stays throughout the drink. Smells like chocolate and nothing else. One of the most chocolaty smelling beers you will find. Smooth, creamy chocolate and powdered sugar. Roasted Malt's. Light sweetness. Not much as far carbonation and not big like other stouts. Great dessert beer."
"D: Easy to drink because there is not a lot going on."
"Drinkability- Really good stout,one to look for on a cold night."
"I find that many beers need to warm up a bit when you pull them out of the fridge and this beer is no exception. Once the beer warmed the chocolate aroma and flavor jumped out. I raised my score on the second glass due to this fact. Great head retention and I can't stop smelling this beer. I think the one thing that kept this from getting a 5 in taste is that it doesn't taste enough like good chocolate but more like Nestle's cocoa powder. I don't want to steer people away from this beer at all with this last comment, it is very tasty."
" Cheers - Matt"
"D: This beer is very drinkable nice and smooth and goes down with ease."
"The CPJ"
"D - Overall very drinkable. A heavy beer, but not very alcoholic, well balanced flavors although the taste of Hershey's syrup might wear on me after a while."
"Overall: A very good beer in one of my favorite styles. Taste is just the right amount of sweetness, aroma and appearance are choice, and drinkability is certainly high."
"Drinkability: Solid overall, this is a pretty good chocolate stout and worth coming back to."
"D - i like this beer because of the chocolates, but I still love my imperial stouts."
"D - Surprisingly great drinkability. I really expected this to be overly sweet, but it's a very well-balanced beer that goes down easily and has a good amount of depth. Kudos to Rogue!"
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured pitch black with a four finger tan head that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, milk chocolate, and Yoo-Hoo. The flavor was of sweet malt, chocolate, and Yoo-Hoo. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I loved Yoo-Hoo as a child and this brough back some feel-good memories while drinking it. With that, it could be a little more complex, but this was very easy to drink. Might be a good way to get people into craft brew that enjoy Yoo-Hoo or chocolate for that matter. A must try."
"Mouthfeel has a nice initial bite of carbonation, but finishes smooth (bordering flat) despite the head. Drinkability is good. I liked this beer, the price is right, I would certainly buy it again."
"D- A treat which Ive indulged in more than once, it drinks like chocolate heaven."
"D: The beer is extremely easy to drink and goes down very smoothly."
"Highly recommended."
"So in conclusion I really like this beer. It's just one of those great tasting beers. The flavor reminds me a little of Maui Brewing Company's Coconut Porter. So if you love dark beers but don't want something heavy and just tastes great pick one of these up. My local stores here in San Diego are selling 22oz bottles for $5.99"
"Overall this is a good beer. Not a great one, but worthy of some praise."
"mouthfeel is pretty light with good drinkability, overall a very good stout, but I m partial to imperials"
"D: This beer is thick, creamy and very smooth. With the lower ABV I could drink this beer all day. The chocolate is nicely balanced with the malts and makes this a very delicious drink."
"You have to like cocoa to like this beer. The taste took me back at first, but I grew to it as I went along. It is a unique beer in its single-minded focus on cocoa."
"D: At 6%, this was very drinkable. Rogue is really hit-or-miss with me, but their pac man yeast worked like a charm here!"
"This is a heavy beer, but the flavor is so pleasing that it's very easy to drink. You really forget that you're drinking beer. After all 22oz are done you feel warmed and relaxed, like having a mug of cocoa, only this is beer, so you're sort of drunk. Easily one of my top stouts."
"D. Highly drinkable. Not sure if I'd go so far as to say ""sessionable," but more than one may be had without problem. It's a great beer."
"Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy body but doesn't have overwhelming sweetness or thickness to make this an extremely enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"Overall a great beer but I don't know if it is really top 100 quality. But good and everyone should check it out."
"Drinkability - This beer is truly outstanding. this is the best ""all around"" beer I've ever had in my life. There could be better ones out there, but as for right now, this has no competition in my eye. Easily drinkable. I would love to have a keg of this set up in my house. I may have just found my new favorite. Without a doubt, worth a try. I took my time drinking this because I didn't want to finish. I didn't want it to end. I could talk about this beer all day. Incredible!!!!"
"I don't know why this beer is in the 100 beers. It is below average at best. Not creamy like a good stout should be. The carbinaton was that of a bottle of Pepsi. I thought that maybe it was me, and maybe I got a bad bottle, but 2 of my other friends had it also. One in Colorado, and One in Ohio, both had the same reaction. In my opinion this beer is way overrated."
"D - Highly drinkable! This is one to drink fresh over and over. Not sure cellaring would do this beer any good as the ABV is low and the chocolate would probably just dissapear."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is slightly over medium bodied and pretty smooth drinking. This is one of my favorite Rogue beers. Generally I am underwhelmed with that brewery, but this beer is pretty tasty."
"D - If you enjoy the dry bitterness of 70%+ cocoa, then the amazing dark chocolate flavor will keep you sipping"
"Very dark in appearance & nice aroma. Huge creamy head & medium body, but the flavors did not taste at all integrated. Each sip tasted like a dark beer, but then the chocolate aftertaste lingeredfor what seemed like forever. I like dark beer & I like chocolatr, but this combo was not appealing to me. And while the label lists ""natural chocolate flavoring", it tasted artificial to me. Not a beer I would seek out."
"D: I can't put the glass down, as a lover of dark chocolate and coffee, this one was hit out of the park. The light(er) body makes it drink easier, but I would prefer it thicker."
"D. Very drinkable. If you like chocolate and beer you will love this one. Great combination of chocolate and traditional stout flavors. This is a very good beer, that is very easy to put down."
"What can I say? It's a chocolate bar in a glass. If you love chocolate you will love this beer, and if you don't you should try it anyway."
"Pours an opaque black with a syrupy appearance. About 1/2"" of mocha colored head. Dominant smell is chocolate but is balanced with hops. Taste is well balanced with toasted malts sweetness and spicy malts up front and delicious cholocate aftertaste. Mouthfeel is best described as chewy, with a tingly feel left behind in the mouth. With a 6% ABV I could drink a few of these but at approximately $5.00 a bomber this beer will remain a treat for special occassions. Absolutely outstanding beer!"
"D: It's nice to find a stout with so much flavor and aroma that's this (relatively) low in ABV, but the bitterness and mouth coating make the last bit of the bomber somewhat difficult."
"My wife and I have tried this one several times,including buying it from the local Whole Foods where it is kept cold, and well it has been bitter every time -so it is either my wife and I's taste buds or just the way this one is. Everything else about it is pretty good - juts always seems to be bitter."
"This is a beautiful brew that taste amazing. ive never had a beer with this much well balanced chocalate flavor. im not even a chocalate fan generally, but this brew is amazing. i fell in love with this the first time i had one, and i continue to buy this brew. no matter what your into, please try this brew, it is a classic! My personal favorite."
"D: Surprisingly this beer can be thrown back, but more than a few might be too much of a sweet kick. This is a great beer, try it."
"This beer did not show much head, but what little it did was a mocha brown, little lacing. The smell is all chocolate, sweet chocolate, not bitter. This literally tastes like a glass of chocolate milk, but way better. Minimal hop bitterness, sweet chocolate and some toffee malt. Mouthfeel is super creamy, almost no noticeable carbonation. This beer is very easy to drink and delicious. My favourite Rogue offering by far."
"D: Very drinkable. Nice blend of flavors. Excellent aroma in my opinion. Slugging it back."
"Rogue chocolate is a solid beer with a pretty good chocolate flavor."
"be hard pressed to find a more drinkable stout. this beer is delicious and not too filling. one of the few stouts that I could have 2-3 pints in one sitting and the abv allows for that as well."
"I shared this with a friend, but next time I think I'll get a bottle just for myself!"
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown/black color with a tan fluffy 2 finger head. The aroma is pretty subdued with slight notes of chocolate, dark roast coffee, and slight leather. Medium mouthfeel. Light roast notes are the first thing I notice followed by sweet bitter dark chocolate flavors. Ends pretty cleanly. Minimal lace. Overall, not too bad but no as good as some other chocolate beers."
"D- Ill drink this stout until I pass out. Nuff said"
"D: Great, especially at 6%. Would be a great dessert on its own or with something chocolate. This is the beer I was hoping for the first time around"
"Taking a sip, lactic acid sourness initially, but nice bittersweet chocolate sweeps onto your tongue. Some coffee mid tongue and more lactic acid and malty finish. Nice creamy body with ample gentle and small bubble carbonation, bordering on nitro like."
"Poured into....not even sure what this glass is. It's a big Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. 22 oz glass with a scary shrimp smiling at me. Pours a black ale with a hefty amount of beige foam which clings nicely to the side. Aroma has the nice chocolate scents some roasted malts, hot chocolate (with marshmellows) and slight orange whiffs. Great malty, chocolate, roasty taste. The cocoa taste really lingers and a little smoke is also produced afet the swallow. Good stuff. Agitate it a little on each sip to get some nice foam with each swallow. An adventure each time. Great drink on a cold day or around a campfire....or anytime."
"This was my first Stout experience. Wow just a good good beer. The chocolate was a pleasent suprise, not too overpowering, but the way this brewer incorporates the sweet with the dark and full flavor is amazing. It is a strong beer, but the chocolate and carmel hints make it a truely unique experience."
"The beer pours practically black and has a big head on the top of the beer, which fades slightly over time but remains throughout drinking. The chocolate taste is perfect, with a slight roasted taste coming through in the middle this beer balances the taste of chocolate with beer bitterness perfectly."
"D- This was a nice drinking beer. I forgot how much I actually enjoy this beer...which is something I have a problem with at times with Rogue's beers. The ABV is well hidden until the stout warms up but that is expected. A great chocolate stout by this company!"
"Pours extremely dark brown/black with a thin, dark tan head.  Smells like cocoa, roasted malts, slight coffee.  Tastes like a hot chocolate packet, sweet and chocolately with a slight bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is medium, drinkability is kinda low, maybe one 12 oz glass but that's all. Overall a pretty damn good brew."
"D - smooth and generally stouty, the chocolate is subtle and well balanced with the classic stout flavours"
"I enjoyed this beverage. I would definitely pick this one up again. Bravo Rogue!"
"I would easily drink this again. Recommended."
"D- Very good beer if you want something that is a little different. Im not a big chocolate fan but I would have this beer again. My girlfriend loves this beer. So maybe she should have wrote this review."
"Tastes almost full-bodied but not enough to make you feel completely full. The relatively high carbonation balances helps to bring out the bitter hops and the subtle dark chocolate. Drinking this during dessert, would be the best option here. After a nice Christmas Eve dinner, this beer would go nice with some chocolate pecan pie. One beer would do the trick, and two if you really enjoy it. Great drink all around, and one of the best chocolates around."
"Overall, the Rogue Chocolate Stout is an exceptional beer in my opinion that is more than worth a try. If you love rich, chocolaty stouts, this will be a staple in your book. However, from my personal experience, I recommend either pairing this beer with an equally robust meal or finishing one off as a dessert at the end of the night; you will find the bittersweet finish turning your palate off to anything else of an equally rich variety."
"Pours black with a tan head which dissipates rather quickly. The nose is chocolate mostly with faint auromas of roasted malt and oat. Taste is a very smooth drinking delicious stout, some bitterness upfront then the expected chocolate in the middle followed by a somewhat dry finish. Creamy and heavy mouthfeel. Easy on the palatte and certainly drinkable."
"Pours pitch black, with a thick, dense tan head. Smell is sweet cacao, and high-edged. Taste is ultra-roasted dark malts and *tons* of dark chocolate. Finish is bitter and tannic, but smooth and dry. Drinkability high. Excellent stout."
"The aroma is strong of chocolate and malt. The taste includes a hint of chocolate and it is medium-bodied. It doesn't have a mouthfeel as thick as it looks and this beer has good drinkability."
"I don't know, I've seen so many good ratings on this brew but I got to say I'm dissapointed. Taste like a weak ale with a shot of chocolate syrup. I guess it's just not my cup of stout! No body very thin feel in the mouth. Just not a pleasant drink."
"This is an outstanding beer, particularly if you're looking for a good dessert. Strong chocolate taste but not too much, with a slight bitter finish."
"This is definitely a great beer."
"Chad"
"Pitch black with a thick brown relentless head thats there to stay. Exceptional lacing. Smells like espresso with chocolate undertones. Like drinking cold dark coffee no sugar no cream. Bitter like 72% dark chocolate. It does have a little sweetness to it. Excellent mouthfeel. So smooth. Im now in love with this beer. One of the best American Stouts Ive had in awhile."
"Taste is also big time milk chocolate. Deliciously sweet, not over the top or cloying at all. There's also a bit of coffee to offset the sweetness a bit. No noticeable hops, completely hidden 69 ibu. Nice medium creamy mouthfeel. Touch of carbonation. This is delicious."
"The palate opens with an intense cocoa character, very Hershey's cocoa like with a noticeable undercurrent of sweetness. The level of cocoa here is pretty darned perfect, balancing beautifully the roasted malt character that comes through on the mid-palate. Not as fruity as the nose would suggest, though there's just a touch of raisin present here. The oatmeal does present a little smoothness on the mid-palate, but the carbonation does take away a little bit from that aspect. Sweetness is almost entirely cocoa-derived without a noticeable caramel or brown sugar component present. The finish is quite excellent with flavors of burnt grain, cocoa and a little sweetness. However, there's also just a touch of a nut-like bitterness present. The other aspects of the mouthfeel are excellent too. Medium in body with a rather smooth, silky feel, the carbonation is a little high for my liking. Drinkability is definitely up there, by keeping the sweetness and alcohol low, this is almost as drinkable as water. I've drunk half my bomber in about 10 minutes. Excellent stuff, I'd LOVE to try this on cask."
"At the very end of the beer you can see tiny specs of chocolate, not a whole lot but enough to notice. It does add a few points for me in the appearance column."
"D- I couldn't comprehend drinking more than one of these. Just too heavy."
"O: Great offering over the holidays for friends and family that may not have made the transition to craft beer."
"Chocolate? Where's the chocolate? I wish this delivered a little bit more on the name."
"pretty good. Only can find in bombers and not really that cheap. I'd definitely get another one. Only 6% makes it easy to drink a bomber alone."
"d: went down smooth. I had a 22oz bottle and it was gone before I knew. Definitely a beer that could get you in trouble if you don't pay attention. :)"
"EDIT: Having drank about a dozen more of these since the initial review, I can really say I actually have come to appreciate this being a more reasonable stout, i.e. not being massive, but allowing the chocolate delivery vehicle to be right where it need be. Can't beat this stuff at $6 a bottle, one of my frequent/almost always purchases when I go to a store that has this stuff in stock."
"Pours with a very brown head, nearly 3 fingers. Black as night and head looks like that on espresso drinks. Aroma is first noted by dark chocolate and malts. Also a slight fruit note in the nose after a bit. Taste has a bit of hop bite right up front, but then goes to chocolate. Finish is dry and some bitterness with chocolate notes. Very nice beer to sit down and sit to, but can also be swallowed real quick. Really recommend picking this bottle up and giving it a go!"
"Definitely a drinkable beer, and without a doubt my favorite beer at this point in time (Just passed up Young's double chocolate stout)"
"I have said before in other reviews that Rogue is one of my favorite brewers out there and this is one, if not their best. I buy this beer often and its a great choice if you just want a good beer or are enjoying it with your desert. Thanks!"
"D: Would pair well with food (actually using some of it in the chili I'm making), but it's also not too overpowering a stout to make it your last beer of the night."
"D - A decent stout but nothing mind blowing. Worth tryingbut I doubt I'd pick it up again"
"This beer pours a balck color with a brown had that wasnt big but stayed through out this beer. It smells of strong choclate very similar to nesquick or choclate milk. The taste is initally choclate and finishs wth a strong stout like flavor. Strong full flavors but the choclate flavors make it drinkable. Overall a reallly good beer really interesting, certialty worth a try."
"Overall- An outstanding stout and a great example of what a Chocolate Stout can be. Rogue's Chocolate Stout is easily one of my favorite chocolate stouts and I purchase this beer on a regular basis because it works well as a dessert beer or with a meal or after a long day. It's a versatile and interesting beverage. I recommend this beer to people."
"Overall, its very good. The ""made with natural chocolate flavoring"" worries me a bit. Definitely one of the better brews by Rogue so its worth a try."
"By far my favorite Rogue beer, but that isn't saying much..Pours black and thick; huge creamy head. The aroma is simple, some roasted malt and cocoa. There is more to talk about the flavor; the mouthfeel is medium thick, with malt and roasted malt, with a distinctive chocolate/cocoa note. Ordinary bitterness. The style is not my favorite, but the beer is well brewed."
"D: Not a bad stout, but I'm not sure if it is top 100 worthy. Definitely an easy drinker, but in my opinion there are much better."
"Drinkability: The flavor of alcohol is simply not present, and therefor becomes easy drinking. The flavors are not too overpowering to make it unwanted after the first pint but instead appeal to the opposite idea."
"Let it out on a pint glass, it pours a dark brown brew with a thick chocolately rich full crown. The aromas are very inviting with a twist of roasted malts, dark coffe, sweet chocolate and dark cocolate as well. Full bodied brew that taste as it smells. The party on the palate starts up with dark roasted chocolate working towards the nice roasted coffe on the middle and rounding it up some sweet cocoa beans to mellow the brew and give it a great aftertaste. Very refreshing and great drinkability"
"Taste is like dark chocolate, and roasted malts, very creamy and drinkable. Their house yeast works very well with this style. It's very rich and drinkable and as it warms the chocolate comes much more present."
"D: Fairly high for me, which was unexpected. This would be quite good with a desert, especially (albeit, a little obvious) of the chocolate variety."
"D- Pretty drinkable, not overly thick, refreshing and good amount of carbonation. I've had better stouts. I've also had Rogue chipotle ale which I thought represented a ""heat"" taste more so than this ""chocolate"" stout. A good stout don't get me wrong, I just wish the chocolate was more evident."
"D: it drank real good and was really surprised with the chocolate character the beer had. I've had this beer quite a few times and has never let me down."
"D: This beer goes down easy enough, but is not very substantive and lacks complexity. I would recommend this beer to someone who may just be getting into craft beer, but probably will not try it again."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Zatec Fluted glass. Very, very dark brown, almost black. A nice fluffy thick 2 fingers of tan head. Decent lace retention. Smells straight up like a very good hot chocolate with a very slight hint of espresso. Taste is toasty. Cocoa powder, bitter semi-sweet chocolate. A very nice lingering bitter hop finish surprised me. A nice mouthfilling medium carbonation that sticks to your palate, however it finishes slightly watery. Could use a bit more body. My only complaint. Amazingly drinkable. Could probably drink two of these 22ozs, without thinking, over a couple of hours. My favorite Rogue Beer. WOW."
"Cheers.."
"Drinkability: This was a pretty full beer, which in my case, means that I cannot have more than one in a sitting. The 22oz I had were plenty for me. I would have this beer again."
"D - slightly dry."
"This beer is jet black and thick when it pours - on top of it sits a beige 2 finger head that sticks around with good lacing as it recedes. Smells of chocolate and malt - very pleasing to the nose, it almost reminds me of hot cocoa. The flavor, of course, is noticeably chocolate, however it is not overwhelming and is extremely pleasant. The chocolate seems to be in near perfect balance with the malt flavor. It is slightly sweet, but it adds to the chocolate and makes it an extremely flavorful and delicious brew. This is now one of my favorite beers - would recommend to anyone that enjoys beer."
"Cheers!"
"Killer!"
"Notes: Did not like this as much as the oatmeal stout, but this is a great stout especially as it warms."
"D: This is a VERY drinkable stout! The initial bitterness fades away as you drink and semi-sweet chocolate is a wonderful parting gift. A very enjoyable stout indeed! The best chocolate stout hands down. Highly recommend."
"The nose is chocolate chocolate and more chocolate! Also a bit of coffee and smokiness, but mostly all chocolate. The taste is not as sweet as it smells, but definitely a lot of chocolate - backed by a bit of roasted coffee and an almost a citrusy floral hop finish. The mouthfeel is a lot thinner than it looks/smells. I expected this to be much thicker consistency with a lot less carbonation. This is where this beer falls off for my tastes. I would have loved this stout to be a little bit sweeter and more body to it. Although it wasn't as heavy as I would have liked it, it proves to be a much more drinkable stout than one would expect. Overall it's a pretty delicious stout oozing with chocolate flavors, who wouldn't like that?"
"D-A very good American Stout, all the more so since the velvety smooth chocolate give this beer its character. I just wish Rogue wasn't so expensive compared to other Oregon micro breweries. This is the best I have enjoyed from Rogue."
"Not my favourite beer ever but definitely a very well done chocolate stout."
"MF/D: a silky smooth sip with a simple medium-bodied mouthfeel, too much could lead to chocolate overload due to its sweetness."
"D - Personally I think the beer is highly drinkable, just because it taste so great. It may have a full body, and be a dessert beer, but I can see myself drinking 4 of these bottles in one sitting. Sure I would probably pass out in a drunken mess, and have nightmares of chocolate bars with arms and legs, beating my ass with Rogue Chocolate Stout bottles, but in the end its all worth it for the delicious choc-a-riffic taste."
"Mouthfeel is more light-bodied and carbonated than I would have liked, but still goes down smoothly. Drinkability is probably higher than what it would be at its genesis in 2007. The hop bitterness is unnoticeable and the amplified chocolate and cocoa makes for a beautiful smoothness. Definitely dispelled all my apprehension about buying this bottle, especially due to its brewing year, but now I'm glad to have been proven wrong. Quality!"
"Mouthfeel is lighter than expected in the body, but very smooth and creamy. Overall a top notch American Stout. Nothing fancy here, but a good balance of chocolate compared to some others and a price that can't be beat for a bomber."
"Sure the chocolate smells, tastes, feel, and look are all over, but when it tastes like a thick stout with the texture of chocolate you don't hardly mind that this is such a weak (6.0) abv. I would drink again, and the moderate price makes this seem possible as a common beer for the festive season."
"Cheers..."
"Drinkability is good, a great stout with lots of chocolate, this is a good beer"
"The chocolate isn't subtle. Syrup with sweetness, and a bitter balance from the stout. Flavors are enjoyable, with the chocolate going just a bit overboard -- just a hair too sweet. Still, very easy to sip. The body is much lighter than expected, but still on the fuller side. One of the better, more complex ones that didn't ruin the beer with the chocolate."
"A perfect chocolate stout to blend with your favorite fruit beer for an amazing dessert beer."
"Drinkabilty - Very impressed. I will buy this again. This could be something to crack open when the snow starts to fly or during the holiday season. But you can also treat it as a dessert beer or you can enjoy it with your dinner also!"
"This is a very good stout with an aroma that is exceptional, as long as you're a fan of chocolate. As a 6% ABV stout, this is a great, flavorful beer."
"There aren't too many horrible things I can say about this beer, it still remains one of my favorite stouts I have tried so far, and one of my favorite beers I have tried in my short life. The only real compliant I would have is the price, it's about 6 bucks where I live for a 22 oz bomber, however I do admit it IS worth the price in taste, but my wallet can't take much more!"
"Easily quaffable as long as you don't mind the chocolate flavor seeming a bit unnatural. I'm disappointed, but that's more a function of having my hopes up too high...it's still plenty tasty."
"D-"
"Glad to have finally tried one of the classics. W wouldnt call it a phenomenal beer, but definitely a good one."
"Taste: Brilliant dark chocolate flavor with some prominent hop bitterness of the grassy variety as well. Background is full and grainy. Has a rich flavor that hints at ripe, dark fruits but they aren't quite perceptible - though it definitely adds to the nice complexity of flavors in the beer. Alcohol seamlessly blends in and adds to the overall picture. Finish is dark chocolate with a bitter tinge that makes in coffee/mocha-like in character. There is even some bready/grainyness in there too. Very nice."
"This is a straight up sweet, smooth, balanced stout with a great chocolate finish, and for the style, it's incredible. Will be looking for this on the east coast."
"D - I had one after my meal for desert. Mind you it's not overly sweet but the richness of flavors sated my desert desires. It tasted so good, I went back the next day at lunch specifically to have another."
"For all it's flavor it's astonishingly easy going and drinkable, especially exceptional drinkability for a stout. The glass and bottle are emptied quickly."
"Perfect example of a chocolate stout in my opinion"
"D - Quite an interesting beer, the chocolate character is undeniable, but the lack of sweetness skews it toward nutty coffee in a way that I didn't expect. The mouthfeel stands out more that that of most beers, due mostly to the unique slickness that comes from the chocolate. The hops in the finish help keep the beer balanced and make the darker flavors stand out. A good beer overall, though I think it would benefit greatly from just a bit more residual sweetness."
"Overall, I really like this beer, although Brooklyn's chocolate stout is still my favorite."
"Pours black with a nice two-finger, dense, tan head. Lots of rich dark chocolate aroma with just a hint of roasted malts. Flavor is also mostly dark chocolate with some coffee and bitter roastiness on the finish. Medium body with a fair amount of carbonation."
"Pitch black body, darkest American stout I've ever seen, look like a double or imperial stout. Tan/brown head with some lacing and a little head retention. Smells like dark chocolate. Fairly strong aroma, but very complex tho. Tastes like dark chocolate too, and again, lacks complexity. No roasted malt flavors to be found. At 69 IBUs this beer is surprisingly balanced however .Interesting mouthfeel, a bit heavy, but very smooth drinking. Big flavors, but not overwhelming."
"Drinkability: Another very solid beer from Rogue/ Like most of Rogue's beers, this isn't a world-beating beer, but is still very enjoyable and at least worth a try. A nice dessert beer."
"D: glad i got a growler, could almost do the 64oz myself though i would regret it."
"D. The drinkability is frightening. Not even being a chocolate person (I don't like coffee either, but I love good Imperial Stouts), I easily could have gone through a second 22 oz. bottle if the bar hadn't served me the last one."
"d- very drinkable. goes down fairly slow, but i am lifting the glass for another swig almost immediately after i set it back down on the table. would have another."
"Pours very dark with a brown head. Decent lacing and head retention throughout. Aroma is dominated by the scent of sweet chocolate. Big unsweetened chocolate malt flavor, some roasted notes. Nice touch of hops as well give the beer some balance and a little bitterness. Sweetness intensifies as you get further into the beer. Flavors aren't too intense like some chocolate stouts. Nice drinkability as well."
"Could be just a tad more thick & creamy, but other than that the mouthfeel is very nice. I would probably drink this again."
"I only had Pale Ales & IPAs in my fridge and I was filling something thicker. I went out to get this and it is really satisfying my palate right about now. Not the first or last time I will have this great beer."
"D - Delicious! Very deserving of the high remarks garnered here. Filling as stouts tend to be, but my only regret is that I didn't buy more than two!"
"D: Very drinkable stout; I love the chocolate quality does get a touch wearing though"
"d- drinkability is good, i wasn't wowed by the chocolate here, although it was very genuine and i got that 'real chocolate' sense, i would drink this again, but wouldn't seek it out, i prefer a straight forward stout with light chocolate notes, not dominated by chocolate - but that's just me."
"D: What this beer lacks in subtlety it makes up for in flavor. It's a decidedly stout-like two-chocolate punch that puts aside the traditional ""roasted"" and ""burnt"" flavors in favor of straight unsweetened chocolate bitterness. If you like chocolate, you can drink this. 22 ounces is a piece of cake, almost literally. If you really like chocolate, you could drink this all night. If you hate chocolate, don't even bother."
"The body was a bit thinner than I like for the style, but was still decently full. Drinkability was pretty good, but this brew is kind of a one-trick pony and can get boring pretty quickly. Overall, a very decent beer, certainly worth a shot."
"Drinkability: extremely drinkable except for how sweet it is, drinking a single bottle is a pleasure but more than that may be pushing it. I'd recommend trying this one for sure."
"Nice dark brown to almost black. The nose has a little more coffee than the flavor provides. It doesn't give a strong bittersweet chocolate flavor, but a more mellow almost milk chocolate smooth flavor with just the right amount of bitterness. Both different and delicious."
"D: This is a VERY drinkable stout! The initial bitterness fades away as you drink and semi-sweet chocolate is a wonderful parting gift. A very enjoyable stout indeed!"
"Goes down easy with only moderate alcohol, very drinkable."
"Notes - over all i really like this beer. i wish there was more of a thick, oatmeal type mouthfeel but thats just my personal preference when it comes to stout."
"This brew is an amazing journey from smooth chocolate to a bitter graininess, packing a low ABV for maximum consumption. This is Rogue's crowning achievement and an exemplary American stout."
"Definitely will pick this one up again"
"D: Very drinkable, I will easily finish this bomber and then promptly wish I had another. As other reviewers have noted, this would probably make an excellent beer to combine with some ice cream to make a nice float."
"D - This is a very drinkable stout. Definitely smoother and more drinker-friendly than a typical dry stout. The chocolate really makes a difference. If you are a fan of stout, you'll probably enjoy this a lot. This could even make a session stout."
"The chocolate is more of a dark chocolate and not too sweet. I found that this added to the drinkability. I could have finished another bottle if I had another on hand."
"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of chocolate, sweet malt, slight hop, slight roasted malt, slight earthiness/wood, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of an American Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight hops, slight chocolate, hint of roasted malt, and slight citrus. Overall, a good blend and aroma, decent body."
"Extremely tasty? Definitely. Extremely chocolaty? I'll try it again sometime to see if it was faded."
"One word for this beer is WOW!!! From the very first pour to the very last taste, this beer was just great! There is no doubt that this beer lives up to it's name. The first thing that wil hit you is the smell of chocolate(dark) right of the bat. There is also vanilla and malts present as well. As for the taste, it was delicious! The first thing you taste is of course trhe chocolate, but it is not sweet, it is more robust than anything. It quickly mellows off and you can taste the maltyness of this brew. It goes down silky smooth. I will be stocking up on this beer for the forseeable future."
"This is very drinkable. Like I mentioned above...was one of my favorites before I developed a taste for bigger, stronger stouts. I will always keep this in my cooler though!"
"Nearly to easy to drink. Could easily finish off two bombers in an hour. This is a nice strong brew."
"Not my favorite stout, or Rogue beer for that matter, but I have deep respect for Rogue for always taking risks and being creative with their brews."
"Drinkability: The first thing I thought was, ""This would be great as a beer float!"". And, I still believe that to be true, however, as a stand alone beer, this one is one of the better chocolate stouts. Not sure if I would have drank the whole bomber by myself...but if i had that ice cream...watch out! Another good one from the peeps at Rogue Ales Brewery."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice chocolate flavored beer. The milk chocolaty, almost chocolate milk like flavor was very nice in the nose and taste. It made a great after dinner drink tonight."
"Nice aroma of slightly bitter chocolate followed up by moderate carbonation and a not-too-chewy mouthfeel of powdered chocolate, toasted malt, and cream. Nice clean finish with just a slight bitterness. I prefer Rogue's Shakespeare Stout, but this one is still a pleasure to drink!"
"What a surprise to me!!! I open a beer claiming to be a chocolate stout- and I smell chocolate! The aroma is that of a Tootsie Roll. Beautiful dark color, decent head. I figured there was no way this was going to taste as good as it smells. I was wrong. To quote my friend who was tasting it with me ""Who needs a fudge bar when you could have this?"" The body is a little thin, but for only $6 a bomber, this will be a common dessert beer at my house from now."
"This is a drinkable stout, as to be expected at 6%. The bitterness seems to be a bit much hindering my want for more."
"D: Nice sipping beer to have sitting on the patio on a cool spring evening. Would also pair well with a chocolate desert."
"D: Better than average drinkability for a stout, which are normally heavy, and higher than average in ABV. This one is slightly above average in both categories, which makes it fairly drinkable in terms of stout drinkability. This one is more of a dessert beer, however, which seems great to pair with any food that is choclatey or smoked meats or cheeses."
"D: Very drinkable dessert that I will absolutely be enjoying more of!"
"This beer is second to the Victory at sea when it comes to chocolate tasting beers. This has just became a top 5 stout for me"
"D-- Feel like I am drinking a European chocolate bar. Just plain rich and thick chocolate. The pine is interesting and different. Just wish it was more like a mint feel, crisper and cooler. ABV is non existent and could easily drink 2 of these in a sitting. at $18 a pop is a bit hard though. Excellent beer and might become a staple this winter in Sydney. One of the better efforts from Rogue and probably even a better beer with a big steak or with a big cheese."
"it feels wet but silky... medium-high carbonation could use a little tweaking maybe between the chocolate bitterness, hop bitterness, and carbonation bite there's a lot going on that might prevent you from really enjoying the nuances but if you're looking for a really good west-coast american interpretation of stout, and you like chocolate, this one is pretty solid."
"The beer pours dark brown with a tan head. The aroma is milk chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is roasted malt, chocolate syrup and piney hops. There is some surprising bitterness, either from the roasted malt or from the cascade hops. Medium-thick mouthfeel and a biting, high carbonation. A very nice beer, but I wish the hops were more in the background since I don't think the pine flavor melds real well with the chocolate notes."
"Some say that Rogue beers are overrated, claiming the appeal's merely derived from the silkscreen-printed bottles. While the bottles are very cool (and, almost reason-enough to buy the beer), I think the taste speaks for itself. Yet another good beer from a very good brewery."
"Poured into a New Belgium chalice black with a thick tan head, good retention and lacing all the way down. The scent is strong of cocoa nibs and dark chocolate. The taste is much similar to the scent. The cocoa leaves a bit of a rough texture to the mouthfeel and leaves an extra dryness to it at the end of the palatte."
"made with imported chocolate"
"D - Man I had my doubts before but I am glad I tried this again. The most affordable chocolate flavored beer I ever had in a bomber."
"D=A+ on drinkability, I absolutely love it easy going down, not filling, looks heavy and surprisingly is not, taste wonderful, excellent beer all around!"
"D: I remember this being sweeter in the past and I liked it a bit more then, but it was nice to return to a classic brew."
"Conclusion: Not a bad stout at all, but not (IMO) up to the hype. Fairly tasty, but probably wouldn't buy it again. If I'm gonna drink a chocolate stout, I think I'd take Young's every time."
"Great desert beer. Drink might benifet from a little more malt sweetness."
"D - This is one helluva drinkable brew! Rogue certainly knows what they are doing with stouts, and it shows since they have 2 beers in the top 4 for this particular beer style. This beer works on several levels, dessert beer or just all around good brew. I'll be recommending this one to my friends!"
"An additional note to add is that it was very carbonated, I found myself belching more than usual. Definitely a beer I'd buy again, but not one that I would go out of my way to get. Worth a try to anyone who hasn't tried it yet."
"The mouthfeel is thinner than I expected, and there is quite a bit of carbonation. The mouthfeel is the weakest part of the beer."
"Had this on tap at the Rogue Public House in Portland a few months back and was impressed - this review is based on the bomber I'm currently enjoying. I like this bottle - lots of good info printed on it: ingredients, food pairings, IBU's, etc. (no freshness date, though). Pours black with a rich, two-finger hazelnut head that leaves patches of lace and manages a thin layer of retention. Aroma is dominated by chocolatey goodness, but there are also some light roasted coffee notes, oats and minty hops in the nose. The taste starts with a touch of minty hops, which quickly gives way to roasted malts and dark chocolate. Finish is sweet chocolate; there's a bit of lasting bitterness (with some light citrus notes) - the light roasted flavor lingers on the palate, too. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied; its a little chewy and there's a light zing from the carbonation. Personally, this is one of my favorite stouts and it's even more enjoyable on draft - its chocolatey and a touch hoppy. Probably my favorite Rogue ale."
"Drinkability - Great after dinner beer but not something I would just open for the hell of it. I've had this for some time now and am glad I opened it tonight. Pretty good!"
"D: I could definitely down many of these. I'll be buying it again."
"added note: now that i think of it, back about two years ago, i was introduced to craft brews for the first time by a future tulane track and field teammate. and he took me to a mix-a-six place. he told me to grab this. and this was the first craft brew to really get me into the world of craft beer. two years later, and almost a year as a BA, i finally revisit rogue chocolate stout and review it."
"Well what can i say this is has got to be one of my most favourite American microbreweries even though i havnt had access to alot of other American microbrews this was definately my first intro into nice quality American brews and if i had to say one thing about Rogue it would be their consistency to produce top quality brews anyways enough of my spiel onto the brew it pours a dark murky cola hue with really decent carbonation that leaves a rapid rising two finger creamy head off a gentle pour and a frothy ring of lacing,the aroma is like you have just opened up a tasty rich belgian chocolate easter egg it is a very lucious chocolate aroma thats sweetness is balanced out by a fruity,hoppy undertone and just from the smell itself you can tell this brew is gonna be something else,and yes i am right the taste of this brew is something to be savoured it starts off with a smooth,creamy full mouthfeel but yet finishes nice and light like a light pale ale and if i was in charge of naming this beer i would of called it Bittersweet as it starts off like a full chocolate flavoured desert beer but finishes like a bitter IPA with chocolate in it,basically they really got the balance right in this brew and please dont be put off by the fact its a chocolate stout as it really is a nice combination of flavours and will always have a place in my fridge/cellar."
"I can't say this beer is anything particularly innovative, but it is intense and delicious. Everything about it seems ""correct."""
"D - Not as drinkable as I anticipated from both the name and the aroma. A little too thin, much drier, and hoppier than I wanted. Don't get me wrong, it's still awesome but not as chocolaty as he name and smell let on."
"Cheers!"
"D-Simply great! Full of flavour with a wonderful aroma. I feel the nitro delivery added wonders to this brew. Plenty of hop/roasted malt bitterness with just enough sweetness to smooth things out. Masterful!"
"Overall, a decent beer. A ton of chocolate. Very thick like a milkshake. Pretty easy to drink a pint, but very filling. I dig it, but wouldn't buy it too often."
"D: one bottle is good for me but the abv is low enough that one bomber will not be the last beer of the night."
"Christening my Portsmouth tulip with this one. Paired with a couple Lindt dark chocolates. Pours black, excellent tan 3-finger head. Fluffy and rocky. Leaves super thick lacing and retains well, great looking beer. Smell is great, rich chocolate, caramel, truffle-esque scent. Taste is sort of underwhelming after the excellent looks + smells. Nice chocolate and oat combo, a bit of roasted malts, earthy notes and hops. The problem is it feels a bit watery, it would be truly stellar if it had some more body to it. It's a very easy drinking stout, a bit pricey though. Finish is kind of weak, a bit of booze starts to show through. An enjoyable, easy-drinking, classic chocolate stout."
"Slainte!"
"[Drinkability]: Very drinkable."
"Bomber poured into a large snifter. Dark brown/black color, creamy with an inch or so of head. Smell is a strong dark chocolate with a dustiness reminiscent of powdered cocoa mix. Taste is initially mildly bitter and grassy but finish is pure unsweetened chocolate. Medium but creamy mouthfeel, very light in terms of alcohol. Extremely drinkable."
"Overall, while I was very impressed with this beer as a whole, I would definitely like to try this again and see if I can pick up more aspects of the flavor."
"Drinkability: Nice for an occasional buy. I like a chocolate stout now and again and this would be the ""go to"" in my opinion."
"Poured from a bottle into my Chimay goblet. Initial pour is a dark brownish black with a tan head. Smells like...well, chocolate. Not too strong, however. Tastes of chocolate malts, much more bitter than sweet though. Would really like more sweetness. Very thin in the mouth. I couldn't drink more than a couple of these in a night...just a little too bitter for my taste."
"Notes: Loads of chocolate with lots of flavor. Chocolate provides slightly more bitterness than sweetness (same goes for the overall taste), but that may be just because the finish is bitter and it stays on the tongue for awhile."
"This is a very big beer but subtle at the same time, Rogue's Chocolate Stout has the balance that I am used to from this awesome brewery. I'm just sad 'cause my pint is getting empty....damn it! Salud!"
"650ml bottle purchased by my girlfriend at Beer World in Largo, FL. Pitch black body with a bubbly brown head and globs of lacing on the pint glass. Fresh baker's chocolate, milk, cocoa powder, and vanilla bombard the nose. Strong roasted malts produce a black coffee flavour that gives way to some toasted oat graininess and dark chocolate. Spicy hops make a brief appearance, followed by an excellent residual chalkiness. The after taste is drier and more bitter than you'd expect from a sweet stout. Overall, this doesn't have the 'oomph' that I thought it would, but it's still a damn fine brew."
"A really good beer with a lot going for it. One of Rogue's better attempts."
"Pours a nice two finger head and looks like a stout dream. When I take a big whiff of it i get a full nose of chocolate. There is no hiding it this is a true chocolate stout. Right off the bat you get hit with chocolate. Taste of mostly milk chocolate almost like a nice hot cocoa. There is a slight taste of coffee and a little hops. Feels nice in the mouth not to heavy like a lot of stouts. I could drink this one all night and will be picking up another one of these in the near future."
"D - drinkable. I just didn't think it was as balanced as it couldve been."
"D: yes, lots of flavor for this abv, and the lighter body and a finish that doesn't linger too long give it a 'moreish' quality."
"This is a superb beer. I hate that it took me so long to get around to trying it, but now that I've found a pub with it on draft, Chocolate Stout has found it's way into my rotation. Excellent offering from Rogue."
"It seems like a lot of the top Stouts on here are involved in an ""Arms race"" of sorts as they attempt to be more strong and extreme. This is on the other end of the shock scale. Nothing complex about this but one look at the list of what went into this on the side of the bottle and you'll know that this is well crafted as any bomber on your local retailer's shelf. For any beer or chocolate aficionado, this is certainly not to be missed!"
"D:Very drinkable, but how many stouts can you drink before your full!!"
"It pours a sold black color with around two inches of a light brownish color head. The smell is almost nothing but chocolate. Not the bland Hersey's kind though. The smell is a mix of milky chocolate and dark bitter chocolate. The taste starts with a milky chocolate flavor that moves on to a bitter yet chocolaty kind of finish. The finish in particular is amazing: it highlights a blend of bitter hops, slightly bitter, slightly sweet chocolate and slightly sweet, slightly Smokey and slightly bitter malts. Overall an excellent chocolate stout that has strong chocolate flavors without being too sweet."
"On tap Feb 12, 2010. Pours black with medium tan head. Dark chocolate and other roasted malts on the nose. Very appealing aroma! More chocolate and coffee notes hit the palate with some bitterness in the finish. Not a huge fan of the style, but this is an awesome beer! One sweet stout! Cheers!"
"The taste is a bit of burnt chocolate, dry, and bittering from the bakers chocolate extract. The beer has crystal malts and dark malts. This isn't overly complicated beer. It has tons of chocolate flavors throughout, some carbonation and this isn't a flat stout by any means. The roasted and slightly charred flavors are nice, the beer is very creamy on the tongue and very mild in the aftertaste. This is a good stout, not all that sophisticated."
"d - Overall this was a very good chocolate stout. It was a bitter chocolate but you could still taste some roasted malts, so the balance was nice. I would definitely try this again."
"All around pleasurable. I like my sweet beers like a dessert, & this had a little more bite that I'd expected, but still very good & enjoyable on its own terms."
"D- Nice aromas and luscious flavors for an astoundingly low 6% ABV... but the carbonation issue kills the drinkability for me."
"one of my favorite stouts EVER..."
"D - For the style, this is top of the class. I could not imagine a chocolate stout that is more drinkable. Perfectly smooth and balanced. Chocolate stouts aren't session beers. I finished my pint with ease and could have had another if I wasn't on my way out. Well done."
"A great tasting representation of what a digestif beer should be like: whether enjoyed after a meal or alone as a special treat, this is a unique beer that is a credit to not only the stout family but to a brewery that pays tribute to the art of beer making with many of its selections. Cheers!"
"D-this is extremely solid. i forgot how good this one was. big flavor and solid body"
"D: Cold night, plate of pork shoulder, and this beer = heaven, but it lives on its own, tool. well done, rogue"
"I could see myself drinking this again it's a solid well rounded beer. This got better as it warmed and would go great with some chocolate cake and iced cream"
"Irrelevant side note: This beer has a pleasant hoppy burp to it."
"Opaque black body with creamy tan head, excellent retension and thick lacing at every sip. Smells like a gourmet desert, melted dark chocolate and dark roasted malts. Naturally the taste is dominated by chocolate. Starts with pure rich chocolate and roasted chocolate malt and finishes with a nice bitterness. Mouthfeel was soft and creamy, although slightly thinner than expected. Enjoyable drinkability sustained itself throughout the pint."
"Respectable."
"It was a straight forward enjoyable beer that I enjoyed trying. I couldn't see making a very good session drink, though as a chocolate stout I'm not sure that it's meant to be.I would recommend this as a dinner or desert accoutrement as opposed to a strong standalone beer."
"All in all, this is a good brew, but I don't think it lives up to the hype. That's not really the fault of the beer though. It's still a good beer; but in my opinion, it's simply another good beer - it doesn't do anything to disgtinguish itself, IMO."
"D- One the best drinking stouts ever- each sip is more flavorful than the last. This beer truly shines as one the best stouts brewed in the US."
"D/Overall * I'm disappointed. I'm kinda worried this was an old bottle that was sitting for too long. I got it for $4.99 which around here is an amazing price for a Rogue 22oz, generally they're $6.99. I will try this again, but not until I find it on tap."
"First impressions, bitterness. From hops and from the chocolate. There is a roast character to it as well. Medium bodied mouthfeel is OK, some connectivity but there should be more sweetness up front. Drinkability is fine, its a good stout, but its not my favorite stout."
"Aroma 8/10, Appearance 3/5, Taste 8/10, Palate 4/5, Overall 17/20."
"D - Very good stout, chocolate or otherwise. Thinking this is up near the top of my list for American stouts. Very smooth, not a hint of alcohol in the flavor...lots of good chocolate and roasted flavors. Creamy mouthfeel. Thought this would be a good one, but I am surprised how much I like this one."
"Nice beer overall, good drinkability and very enjoyable!"
"This is really a world class stout. Why did it take me so long to finally drink this beer? The one fault is the Rogue bomber prices."
"This beer was very dark, obviously being a chocolate stout. It had a fairly small head, but it lingered. I have to admit this was my first Rogue beer (also first chocolate) so I wasn't sure what to expect. There was a nice chocolate taste to the beer, but there was also a very strong after taste which was almost bitter. I'm sure this beer is worth a taste if you like chocolate flavored beers or if you're a fan of Rogue in general."
"D- a very drinkable brew, one could get addicted this stuff quick"
"Drinkability is decent, but the overall beer has a bit of a coarse feel, from the hop character to the bitterness to the carbonation. Beautiful execution of chocolate character, but that's by far the strongest suit of the beer. Falls short in other areas, though perhaps that's more my own expectations than the beer itself."
"Poured a nice dark black from a bomber into my snifter. Smells of chocolate and hops. Taste is similar with lots of sweet chocolate, almost a brownie like flavor. Quite a bit of earthy hops, more than I would expect from a stout, but no surprise from a rogue beer. The chocolate dominates the flavor, but the hops really help balance things out. This is a standout from rogue, highly recommended for any chocolate stout fans."
"D- I drank this bomber easily, and loved it, but wouldn't want more right away. This is a rich beer, the sweetness is plenty for me. I will definitely buy more."
"excellent example of a good stout. i haven't really decided whether or not i like rogue, I've had good and bad, but this is def one of the high points."
"Overall this is a really good beer and a really good chocolate. I really dont have any other chocolate stouts to compare it to. I would recommend this one definitely."
"I prefer Choklat. But, I am so far off from everyone on this I am going to give it another shot and write a fresh review."
"Not the best chocolate-infused stout I've had, but a solid offering, especially since this isn't an imperial."
"Overall a very rich and accessible dessert stout."
"Another excellent stout from Rogue. I enjoyed this one just as much if not more than their Shakespeare Stout. Loads of flavour, perfectly balanced, not too sweet, and very easy to drink. An excellent dessert beer."
"The feel is decent not terribly drinkable."
"D - So good on a cold winter night. The bomber is all mine!"
"Bomber bottle. Black color with moderate light brown head that diminished slowly and had good lacing. Complex sweet malt and chocolate aroma. Full body with a creamy texture. Good complex bitter chocolate and coffe flavor with a long bittersweet finish. Very good sweet stout."
"D: I am loving this chocolate stout. The abv actually allows this to be a nice session brew. Really great..."
"Very enjoyable and easily drinkable. There is absolutely nothing offensives about this brew. Though Rogue can be hit or miss with me when considering their entire line up, Chocolate Stout is definitely on the top tier of Rogue offerings."
"Tastes: Wow, it's like eating a dark chocolate bar. Not as sweet as I thought it would be based on the aromas. By far one of the better chocolate stouts I have had. Rogue hardly ever disappoints with its beer, a great chocolate, coffee, heavy beer. Wouldn't want to drink too many of these at one time. Would be great served with a slice of chocolate cake or other dessert."
"Overall, this beer is by far one of my favorites, and I'd recommend it to you and any of my friends. I wish you the best of luck on your beer endeavors and as always, Cheers."
"M - This is nice and thick, but not overly so like some impy stouts can be."
"D. Goes down easy. I wish I would have bought more than one. Or maybe I shouldn't have shared it."
"Good."
"Notes: I can see why so many people enjoy this one, a solid chocolate stout."
"I've had a few chocolate stouts and this one is slightly underwhelming, compared mostly with the outrageous Choklat by Southern Tier. The appearance is great, showing thick and dark with a light brown 1/4 inch head (poured into a snifter). Mouthfeel is good, but a bit thin and bubbly. The smell is light chocolate, which, when tasted, translates about the same: a tad underwhelming. A mild hoppy character comes in towards the end to cut a bit of the up front, malty sweetness, which creates a good balance. This is definitely an above average example of the style, but it didn't make me say ""Wow!"" or ""This is ""World Class.""""
"Pours an opaque black color with a thick light-brown head showing good retention. Strong chocolate and caramel malt aroma jumps right out of the glass. Nice, but not complex. Taste begins with a nice balance of roasted and sweet malt flavor. Then a bit of hop bitterness comes out along with a sort of baker's chocolate bitterness that lingers a bit with a dry finish. Very nicely balanced for a chocolate stout in my opinion. Mouthfeel is smooth although body (light to medium) is a bit lighter than expected and carbonation is higher than expected. Overall, a very tasty beer that I could have several of."
"D- High on the drinkability scale for the purposes of enjoying a delicious dessert beer, would I pound this watching a football game? Probably not. I would like to note I purchased this bomber for $4.99, so it's a great price for an amazing stout. When ""I" drink this I want to savor the ingredients and pair it with an aged Torano Exodus cigar or perhaps even a Partagas Black."
"Drinkability: A tasty stout and one I would love to try again some time. Another win for Rogue!"
"Pitch black pour with a beautifully tanned head. The flow off of draft looks sturdy and oil rich. The frothy cap grew and grew until it grew out of my glass. The cap stayed for the full term and was left in the bottom of the glass. This brew has a great cocoa flavor with a nice bitter finish that is complimentary to the initial sweetness. This is a great chocolate and coffee representation in the aroma. This brew is missing a little of the toasty nuttiness in the flavor that I was expecting from the aroma. The mouth feel isn't as hearty as I had expected from the pour but far from thin and still properly bodied. The bitterness of the cocoa persists throughout jumping up and down on the pallet. This is no subtle brew and once you start don't plan on moving on, this one owns the pallet for quite a while."
"Drinkability: I finished my pint surprisingly quickly for a beer with so much flavor and body. Very drinkable for such a heavy stout."
"D=not real drinkable for me due to the sweetness and chocolaty flavors, but good for the designed taste."
"D- This is an alright beer. Nothing awful but I dont think I'll have it again."
"Full bodied. Finishes quite dry."
"D - The ABV is low and well-hidden, and the carbonation, while higher, isn't bloaty. I just can't deal with that weird aftertaste, although it dissipates quickly enough that the beer is still fairly drinkable (and you can always drink more to cover it up!)."
"Notes - Good mouthfeel with a decent level of carbonation."
"Body is very fulfilling. Has a great feel in the mouth. Carbonation is just enough, not too bubbly, not too flat. Everything just seems to click with this beer. It is everything that it promises and more. I've learned to respect Rogue beers, and this beer does everything to re-enforce that view, and more."
"Tried a few weeks back, but I hadn't gotten around to reviewing it until now for various reasons. Dark ruby brown with a thick brown head that left good lacing. Smells of dark chocolate and a slight bit of coffee in the background. Tastes like unsweetened dark chocolate (awesome) and had a bit of a roasted character to it, with some notes of coffee and dark fruitiness to compliment the chocolatey body. Surprisingly smooth, with good carbonation- not too heavy, leaving you to enjoy it at your own pace. It went down very easily, while still retaining full character. I did use a good portion of the bottle to make two floats (received as payment for moving a couch for my brother's girlfriend) and was able to get an ample review from the remainder of the bottle poured into a pint glass. Once you've had this, you won't even be able to look at a Guinness again."
"Very delicious. I imagine, with chocolate cheesecake or chocolate brulee, it would make for a most decadent dessert."
"drinkability: a nice beer not as chocolatley as I may have thought but still a solid beer."
"Drinkability - Very easy to consume, and yes please, I will have another."
"This is a unique beer - one that is extremely chocolaty, yet not so sweet and syrupy that it takes away from its drinkability."
"22 ounce bomber poured into a Unibroue tulip. Beige head one finger thick is imploding from within as if its the surface of some other planet, yet to be discovered. Body is black as the night itself. Aroma is chocolate, or more accurately as the bottle describes...chocolate truffle. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. I would estimate that this bottle is one year old by the amount of yeast sediment/buildup at the bottom of the bottle...the perfect age for this slow to attenuate chocolate stout. Taste is creamy and smooth with some mild hops and mild alcohol heat. Some coffee notes, but mainly just chocolaty greatness. This is the best chocolate stout on Earth."
"Drinakability in a word, fantastic! This is by far one of the best stouts I've ever had. It goes down very nicely and leaves me wanting to grab another bottle. I could drink this all night and if it were in six pack from, an instant session beer for me."
"The pour was actually disappointing, there was less than one finger's worth of head. The head was a nice brown color and the beer was a thick black, with some moderate lacing. The smell may have been my favorite thing about this beer. Rogue's Chocolate Stout smells like a fine dessert, there's some definite notes of cocoa powder, roasted malts and - of course - chocolate. The taste however is not very stoutish, it seems very watered down. There's some hop notes, chocolate, hints of vanilla,"
"All is pretty standard for a hopsy stout. Nice dark body with a somewhat dissapointingly small amount of caramel colored head that leaves a nice, delicate lacing as you drink. The smell is very intricate, if a little too faint for me. Lots of smells: cocoa powder, vanilla, hops, roasted malt; all are very well balanced and leave a nice, faint auroma in your nose. I just wish there was a bit more robustness. The taste is good but not surprising or astounding. The hops, always well done in Rogue products, really take center stage and really leave the faint chocolate flavors as more of a side note. But still... good. It feels fine enough, though it is a little watery for my taste in stouts. Little carbonation is present. So all in all, a good drink and a good beer. I understand it in those terms but not as a top 100 beer and certainly not as the best Rogue has to offer."
"This brew is a true treat to the palate, a superb stout that could go great after dinner. But hell why not make a session of it - I sure would. Superb."
"I was wearing a big red cat head, and in order to keep my anonymity I drank this through a straw. I couldn't tell it was a beer, it tasted exactly like a chocolate malt."
"Mouthfeel was dessert-like. Creamy medium to full body with enough zippy carbonation to cleanse the palate."
"D: Well, not my style at all. I like stouts were the chocolate tones comes naturally. It often takes brewers ages to get that refined taste. This is a quick shot and therefor highly unbalanced. Will not drink this again. For me adding huge amounts of chocoalte is the same as adding chemicals to beer."
"D: A deliciously drinkable stout. Very flavorful and nicely balanced."
"Overall: This is not what I expect from a chocolate stout. I expect a balanced beer, where the chocolate taste comes from a careful an long lasting selection, optimization and combination of the correct malts which give the chocolate taste to beer. I read on the bottle that the brewers ADDED chocolate to this beer. Come on, amateurs, take your time to brew a beer with a natural chocolate taste, instead of mimicking one. Call some brewers in the UK (e.g. Sam Smith), they might be able to help you, because they have centuries of experience. This a for me a typical bigger, better faster beer....what a shame. Beer should be a natural product...."
"This is my favorite beer from Rogue out of all of them I tried. Much better then the Mocha porter that they offer."
"M/D: Smooth and creamy feel towards the back, as the front is more biting with the higher level of carbonation. The texture is heavy and thick despite the lower alcohol content. A good one to share, this one is extremely rich, and proves to be a lot."
"Notes : Over all a good brew, not the best stout I have had. But the first chocolate stout I have had. Loved the smell, which is weird because I am not huge on chocolate. Going to try it with some sort of dessert next time."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout, but the carbonation matches the flavors well and the beer is very drinkable."
"uscaptainsblog.blogspot.com"
"A nicely balanced affair, something I wasn't exactly expecting - the hops keep the pushy bittersweet chocolate in check, making for a comfortable, easy-drinking stout - provided you have a chocolate sweet tooth, that is. One of Rogue's better offerings."
"D: Pretty drinkable, gets better as it warms."
"-my first formal review on BA. was planning on doing it with a ""better"" beer, but figured I would just jump in tonight. cheers!"
"Drinkability - an outstanding beer! a little leaner on the mouthfeel than I would have liked and a little bit more bitter than I was expecting, but this is still an exceptional brew!"
"D: good, enjoyability was that much better. Even through the nature was a deep dark chocolate stout this was extremely well balanced and smooth sliding down the throat with pleasure leaving a calling card of residual burnt bitterness that will positively keep you coming back for more. A can't go wrong beer here and a excellent desert beer."
"D : A nice dessert beer, but may leave you feeling heavy after 1 bomber."
"D: A tasty and hearty ale; like a meal in a cup. Good stuff. Like a grown man's chocolate milk. Wouldn't hesitate to have another."
"Drinkability: Goes down like liquid candy."
"Drinkability: as stouts go, this would make a great session beer."
"Very drinkable for a stout, but it might get a little too sweet after a while."
"D: Very drinkable. Not overly complex so the tastebuds are not needed to evolve much with this drink"
"cheers!"
"D- Pretty drinkable for me. Towards the end of the bottle the chocolate started to be a little much for me (I'm not a big chocolate-guy), but that's just for my taste. An awesome beer; unlike any chocolate stout I've ever had."
"D: Well made beer. Nice blend of flavours here, but I was expecting something thicker and fuller. Either way it's a great drink."
"Chocolatey nose and very nice appearance. Great chunky lacing that leaves craters in the foam as it slowly, and I mean slowly fizzles down. Chocolate chips, chocolate brownies and roasty black malt in the taste with a wet and bitter finish. Not chewy enough. This beer is absolutely fantastic for the style but IMO can't hold a candle to bigger Chocolate Imperial Stouts like the Lost Abbey Serpent Stout. Carbonation is a little too plain like a club soda, meaning it doesn't mesh well with the style. Could use less bitterness in the finish."
"Drinkability: chocolate and beer, great pairing. highly recommended beer."
"D- Quaffable and will pair extraordinarily with cherry or raspberry desserts. A happy medium between Young's and Southern Tier."
"D: The flavors are strong so it may not be the best session beer, but for an american stout it is at the top of it's class."
"Overall a very good beer."
"D: Not too bad, but not great - the heavy bitterness gets a little bit in the way."
"salud!"
"~ Purchased this 22 oz bomber from Frank's Beverage in Glen Cove, NY. Pours black with a big creamy light brown head. Wow! If you like chocolate (and who doesn't?), this is the beer. The smell is nothing short of amazing. Hints of Rich Belgian chocolate appear almost immediately. This doesn't taste like a beer, this taste more like something out of a Hershey's syrup bottle. A slight bitter aftertaste makes its appearance at the end, but who really cares about the hops - my mind is still set on the chocolatey goodness. For the style, and everything this Rogue presentation has to offer, I am glad to see all the positive praise from other members. This beer definitely deserves it. Two words: Simply delicious. ~"
"Overall: If you like stouts, then you'll love the Rogue Chocolate Stout! The chocolate aromas are excellent and the complexity and balance in the flavors were really unexpected!"
"Pours brown-black in the bod with a layer of cinnamon head for a delicious look. Chocolate scent, dark chocolate..ooh yeah, dessert-like. Great taste of chocolate, malty, cream, dark chocolate sweets. A thick bodied brew with great looks and decadent flavors."
"D - Rated good as I would definately have another but not drink a lot at a time as I am not big on chocolate."
"Cheers."
"Served in a goblet on tap at the dirty truth in western mass. Modest head with less than modest lacing. Smell is very chocclatey. Almost like syrup. Similiar to choklat. Taste is chocolately malty and a bit of hops at the end. Mouth is a little heavy on the carb but this shouldn't be too much of a problem for most. Thanks to CButova for affording me ths beer since I am penniless."
"Poured a pitch black into a goblet with a one finger tan head with alright retention, medium lacing is left on the glass. Smells of pure chocolate with some malts, follows the name. Tastes of chocolate, chocolate some more, some toast malts and a hoppy aftertaste balance. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation for the style, no off flavors or alcohol badness. Drinkability is great for the taste, no off flavors, price is within reason, will buy again."
"One of the top five stouts I have had the pleasure of drinking. I typically prefer the imperials, but this is a big beer with a whole lot going on. I'm eager to try it on tap."
"D- Moderate. This beer is a joy to drink but is not sessionable- for one, it's too heavy to drink a lot of, and the flavors are pretty intense despite the moderate ABV. Still, fantastic. If you like chocolate or stouts, you'll love this chocolate stout. A captivating brew and some of the better flavor-specific beer I've enjoyed."
"Overall, a deliciously chocolate flavored stout. Waves of chocolate notes make this drinkable and flavorful. A nicely balanced stout."
"drinkability: Moderate. Decent flavors, wish it was a tad sweeter; a bit heavy in body so it's very filling (as a stout should be), but the ABV is pretty moderate and doable, so that helps a bit."
"- Great brew, great taste, and wonderful drinkablility."
"D - Pretty high for the style."
"They have this on tap at Taco Mac in Roswell, GA. It 's a great stand alone beer but I usually have one at the end of the night after I have a good IPA or porter. The aroma is is the first to hit you and then the taste is very smooth. They also have it in a large bottle but the draft is better."
"Drinkability 5.0/5.0 - Would drink this anytime and a number of different types of beer drinkers would enjoy it too."
"2.5 D: Based on the appearance and smell I was expecting something akin to ST Choklat. The taste and mouthfeel eliminated that thought on the first sip. This is a bad beer, which could easily be salvaged by ramping up the chocolate flavors and thickening the mouthfeel."
"Overall: Very pleased with this one. As I see it, the gold standard for chocolate stouts is Young's brew. Without having a bottle of Young's Double here with me, I can't make specific comparisons, but I'd rank Rogue's concoction right up there."
"Notes: This is a tasty stout that I wouldn't mind enjoying after a good meal."
"Drinkability:This one is a bit more bitter for a chocolate stout than I would like. It has a small sweet taste in the beginning and in the middle that is very good. I would have another bomber at some point, but one per session is enough. This is decent, but not spectacular."
"This poured an exceedingly dark brown color with a light brown head about an inch tall. Definitely has chocolate in the aroma along with a malty ginger bread scent. Taste was also of ginger bread, with chocolate lasting through the finish. Chocolate was somewhat bitter (semi-sweet chocolate as someone else described.) This is a pretty tasty brew."
"This is a fine beer, no doubt about that. I would have rated it higher on the drinkability scale if it were just a tad less bitter, but it's still a drink that is very easily and enjoyably imbibed."
"Then you pour another one promising yourself to go slowly."
"Overall - If you're an alcoholic and a chocoholic, beware this beer, as you will get hopelessly addicted. For the rest of us who just love our beer and our chocolate, buy some of this right now; you'll be glad you did as you're sitting there in a chocolate/alcohol haze."
"Overall a very tasty and solid stout. Would def buy again."
"I haven't liked many Rogue beers but this was probably one of the better ones. Mainly because the yeast strain character is more muted."
"It smells like chocolate with some roasted malts. It tastes like semi sweet chocolate. There is some bitterness and some sweetness. It is balanced nicely. This is an excellent beer. It makes a nice dessert beer or is just fine by itself. I am glad that I tried this. It was worth the wait."
"Pours the darkest brown. Couldn't convince myself it was black, though I saw no light get through. The generous frothy head started out light brown and faded to tan (hadn't really noticed this happening with other beers). Aroma is amazing, which is stating the obvious to anyone who has had this beer. Tons of creamy chocolate, rich malts, some tang from the hops, nuts, and smoke. The hops definitely come through more in the flavor, which is dominated by bittersweet chocolate. I do crave a bigger body in this beer, but as is, I find it too easy to drink the bomber. A rather good value, so don't hesitate to grab this one."
"The body is pretty light, making this a very drinkable beer that won't fill you up too fast."
"Never had a more drinkable stout. The ABV and lighter body of this make it go down so easy. The crispness really quenches the pallate. Nicely done."
"D: Incredible for a stout, such incredible chocolate flavor. Truly one of the best stouts I've had."
"I really think Young's Double Chocolate Stout is a far better choice. If you think this is a good beer (which I did) you gotta give Young's a try."
"D- Somewhat sweet, which could make it hard to drink too many. Of course, it's price keeps one from drinking too many. A solid beer overall."
"D. Surprisingly smooth and very drinkable. A must try if you enjoy chocolate and beer"
"This is a beer that does not warm up well. It was far better cold (usually not a good sign). Poured out rich, deep brown with a generous, light brown head that faded quickly. The aroma was one of the better I've had with rich chocolate dominating. The taste left something to desire. Mostly coffee and stale, bitter coffee at that. Very little of the aroma translated into taste, but some of the alcohol did and not to the beer's benefit. ChocoRogue looked oily, but ended up watery on the tongue. Like a lot of stouts, not high drinkability, but not due to a heavy, alcohol reasons. I just had Mikkeller Beer Geek Brunch Weasel last night and may be over critical of Rogue's as a result of the comparison."
"D: I just can't give a good score here, this is a beer thats good in moderation, and that's not due to the ABV. Its just to over the top chocolate rich, and the sweetness builds to a point you can't take it anymore. This is a brew that gives a very satisfying first impression that halfway thru has you thinking about your next selection."
"MF/D: Medium creamy body, watery finish, dry at the end, a little high on the carbonation"
"D: This beer is easy to drink as long as you like chocolate. It's not all that strong either so if you like stouts this is a good one to drink. It would be great with dessert."
"Altogether balanced and producing a creamy, dessert-like quality that would serve well as the base of an ice cream float, with rich truffles, dark berries, or as a wonderful after dinner piece on its own. Not too heavy, either, and alcohol content is low enough to keep a full bottle from knocking one out for the night. Top-notch and a wonderfully well-made example of a chocolate beer. Superb."
"D- Goes down easy. Could have more than one in a session."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't have this all the time and it was a bit warm for it today, but man, great desert beer and totally will buy a few more of these to have on hand for such occasions. Not too heavy for a stout either. Definitely worth a good shot."
"Verdict: Here's a chocolate beer that really delivers in the chocolate department. But, it's not just a one-dimensional beer though, there's enough complexity here to make this a real winner."
"Appearance is a deep cola syrup black with plenty of creamy tan head that lines the tumber. Nose is dominately chocolate with hints of the smell of baileys irish cream, bitter hops, and the usualy coffee stout aroma. Lots of bitter dark chocolate hits the palate. Malts and dark roasted coffee linger. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Very good chocolate stout from an always dependable brewery."
"Had this one a while back but took notes. Poured a deep brown color with foamy brown head that faded somewhat quickly and left good lacing. Smelled of chocolate, light hops, caramel, and a tinge of alcohol. Tasted like roased, toasted chocolate. Average mouthfeel, smooth but overcarbed and left the tongue a little bitter. Went down pretty easily though."
"Overall, I really appreciate what Rogue has done here. They have pushed the limit and not just made a chocolate stout but an über one. Unfortunately, this just doesn't work for me. I can why so many people like it so much and it does taste like a good beer...with just too much chocolate."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. It literally goes down like chocolate milk, with pretty much the same consistency. Excellent stuff, I'm glad I had the chance to try it."
"A very smooth, drinkable and delectable beer. Thankyou Local Taphouse for bringing it to our shores. It was better on tap here than in bottles in the US."
"The best smelling chocolate stout I have had. Though I miss some body, it felt a bit thin at times."
"I'm a big fan indeed. What a fantastic beer. I could drink that for the rest of my life."
"A phenomenal dessert beer, without question. A job well done by Rogue."
"Contrasting this with Southern Tier Chokolat, the chocolate flavors in this are much more subtle, and enhance the flavor of the mild-mannered stout. Meanwhile, the Chokolat kicks you in the face with powerful chocolate. I like both...a lot."
"22 oz Bottle. Pours black with a nice tan head that doesn't linger. Chocolate kind of overwhelms the aroma, but that's to be expected. Medium body. Not a lot of depth to the flavor, but lots of chocolate, with some roasted malt and coffee, which is nothing suprising Overall another good stout from Rogue."
"I like this. Definitely one of the better Rogues I've had, but it didn't blow me away."
"D - Pretty drinkable."
"D - Bottle says 69 IBU - I would guess much lower! I think I'm tainted from the last few hoppy beers I've had."
"D - The light mouthfeel leads to being able to finish a whole bottle of this as dessert...I would be careful of having more than one...but it is very possible...Rogue strikes again!"
" Beau of Bama"
"Drinkability: good beer to relax with"
"O. Awesome beer. Next chocolate craving will be prescribed this beer."
"Super creamy mouthfeel makes this a great dessert beer. One is easy to down because it is so damn good but I got the feeling it was time to move on after it was gone."
"D- One really easy drinking stout with a nice flavor."
"D: A good beer, but I don't think it managed to live up to my expectations. Indeed, there is a lot of sweet chocolate flavors going on here and that's the way it should be, but it would have been nice with a little more complexity and a bigger body. Still recommended, though."
"D - More than one might be a bit much. Still well balanced and smooth."
"Sessionable? Maybe if you're sasquatch."
"Poured a very, very dark brown and the tannish head looked good and the chocolate smell was awesome. Taste was roasted malts and hersheys chocolate upfront, beginning to end. Mouthfeel is amazing, cocoa, roastiness and a slight coffee hint but very minimal. I can drink this all day long."
"D - Overall great. I didn't enjoy this as much as others and would recommend using less patent. A little goes a long way."
"drinkability is alright - its a solid stout @ 6% abv but i have had much better porters"
"m/d - Spot on for the style, slightly sticky but still easily drinkable on a cool summer evening. Extremely drinkable, very tasty and lowish ABV make this sessionable."
"I expected a sweeter drink when I bought it, but I'm not disappointed by this brew. Drinkable, although too much would be filling."
"Bottle Pours a nice black with a lasting tan head. The head is creamy and lasting. Produces decent lacing. Has a good aroma of chocolate. Smells like a tootsie roll. It is cool. Has a good carbonation. A wonderful outhfeel. The flavor is robustly chocolate. Well balanced and fresh. Has a thicker body. A real good finish and a nice aftertaste. This is a sweet drinking beer. Maybe not for everyone but very good. I like it a lot."
"D: This isn't one I could drink a lot of but I'm going to remember this as an after dinner treat every now and again that I can split with the wife."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, but a little on the spritzy side as well. This is the weakest aspect of this beer. Big chocolatey flavor all over this! They weren't kidding on the chocolate thing, were they? There's a touch of hop bitterness mixed in the middle, but the finish is the most pleasant mild cocoa flavor I've experienced. Wonderful. Wow. Why did I wait so long to pick this one up? This will be a regular dessert, celebration beer in the household from here on out..."
"D: I don't know how much of this I could drink at once before wanting something lighter and crisper. But I can drink this whole bottle, easy."
"Rogue's Chocolate Stout is easy to love and would be a good intro beer or intro stout for an inexperienced palate. I would never decline one of these."
"Should be much tougher because of the thickness, but all in all, it's alright. Not unusually easy, but not bad for a stout that I'd expect to be this heavy."
"Notes: This beer was not what I was expecting, but what ever is. While the natural chocolate flavor shines through, I was not overly impressed with the brew. I will note that this brew did get better as it warmed up, and I may have just gotten a bottle that was old or not well shipped. I will have to try it a few more times, and then update."
"Draught at The Red in Santa Cruz. Black with a dense tan head. The aroma is super chocolate powered; leaning a little toward the dark side, but still milky and creamy. The flavor takes that and adds in a roasted bitterness that doesn't completely blend, but works out alright. The body is a little thin, but pretty smooth. This is a really nice smelling beer, with a pretty good flavor to back it up, but the chocolate and roasted malt don't seem to gel as well as they could"
"Taste is sweet and has strong unsweetened chocolate flavors. Supported by a medium sweet malty body, the chocolate is flattened out and fits the beer. The chocolate flavor has some artificial edges but I get used to that. Some mild roasted malts are present, but it never gets sharp or burned. There is a sweet malt base, but the body is a bit thin."
"D- Started it before dinner and finished the bottle with my steak. I could have had another bottle for dessert. Wonderful."
"Now this evening so many years later,I picked up my first Rogue. Rogue chocolate stout,just have one thing to say about this brew,Dark Chocolate Dreams!I love it"
"rogue is an great beer."
"Overall a very nice, chocolatey, not too sweet, offering. Great Chocolate Stout"
"Pours a dark ebony with a fluffy tan head. Nose of chocolate/cocoa powder and some toasted malt. Taste was bitter, similar to 90% dark chocolate. I was hoping for a thicker mouthfeel and more depth, but it didn't deliver. Drinkability is good, but you have to pick the right time of year for it."
"D: Good toward the beginning, although a full bomber is definitely a little too much given the character of this beer. Definitely suggest splitting this one amongst two or three others!"
"D - A very tasty Stout indeed. Something I'll be drinking more of."
"Poured into a mug a jet black with a finger's worth of thick chocolate colored head. Soft chocolate smell, like an Aero bar, as opposed to a thicker, darker, sweeter chocolate. Taste is creamy smooth chocolate. Again I am reminded of Aero. No bitterness, excessive sweetness or anything else off putting. Surprisingly light and smooth, I wouldn't guess this is a stout if I tried it blindfolded. Overall very delicious and the best chocolate stout I have had."
"This beer goes down WAY too easy!!! Very tasty, great dark chocolate bitterness. I started drinking it and the next thing I knew my glass was empty and the bomber is dry. This beer could be the perfect sessional stout."
"I'll definitely drink this one again in the future."
"d: The bottle was probably old, time for a deletion. Dangerously drinkable and delicious."
"D - Very drinkable, I'd go so far as to say this is my favorite rogue beer."
"Overall, an impressive production."
"D - Not my favorite beer, but not really my favorite style either. The aroma is slightly misleading. Instead of a gentle chocolate flavor atop some roastiness, Rogue offers a fairly dry and sharp stout."
"D - This is easily one of the best smelling chocolate stouts I've come across, and this also has a pretty aggressive bitterness to boot! The nitro pour gave it a pleasantly soft and smooth mouthfeel as well. Excellent stuff from Rogue!"
"D: This is a good stout, but I can't recommend it as a gateway beer like some have. There's definitely an essence of chocolate, but you kind of have to work for it. I think you have to like stout at least a little to appreciate this."
"Notes: This would be a good chocolate stout to introduce as a gateway beer for those just getting into darker beers. Not overly sweet, but does deliver satisfaction to the sweet tooth, and also a picky craft beer drinker. Recommended"
"Overall - A good stout, though I'd rather have a Peche Mortal or Choklat, unfortunately this lacks the flavor intensity of the aforementioned stouts."
"Just started as a craft brewery fan, began with Pale Ales and IPA'a and now moving into Stout/Porters. This beer pour a very dark brwon color with a thick brown head that seems to last forever. The smell is awsome, full and deep, the chocolate is definetley there, reminds me of trufles, fondue and strawberries with chocolate. Flavor has a strong hoppy character, that gives a pleasant contrast to teh aroma. As the lable states, there are hints of oatmeal, chocolate and truffle. Aftermouth is also very enjoyable. Overall this is one of the best stouts I have had (which is not much as I said earlier) and I would highly recomend it."
"D - Average, this stout has a very strong flavor of dark chocolate that although pleasant would likely weigh on me if I tried to drink more than 1 bomber."
"Overall a very nice effort. Smell is really great. Taste is up there, just needs a little more substance in the body"
"On a side note, I was ackwardly surprised by a piece of what appeared to be partially melted glue stick floating in the bottle before I pourded my second glass out of the 650 ml bottle."
"D- I had this beer for dessert, and I recommend it for that. It would pair nicely with a very dark chocolate, which I really wish I had on hand. It's an easy drinking beer and the ABV isn't too strong at 6%. I very much enjoyed it."
"Pours black with an average toffee colored head and some greta lacing. The smell is of tootsie rolls chocolate and caramel malts and some light hopping. The flavor consists or bitter dark chocolate some grainy malts and a lingering hop bitterness. The mouthfell is quite thick for 6% and it is quite drinkable. This one is a classic, a good chocolate stout that is not 10%. An excellent example of the style."
"I poured from a bomber into a standard pint glass. It pours jet black with a large tan head. The aroma is pure dark chocolate. The flavor is heavy on dark chocolate without being overly sweet. The finish is only slightly bitter, giving the beer great balance. The beer is medium bodied, average carbonation and dangerously drinkable. This would make a great desert beer."
"D- A very nice chocolate stout, which if it were just a touch more viscous could be great."
"Overall this is a great chocolate stout. After having both ST Choklat and Harpoon chocolate stout, this one is much better than both and fits perfectly between both. It isn't ""imperial"" and it doesn't have to be. It has complexity without being too strong. The price is a bit high here, of course since its Rogue."
"Overall, a disappointment - see above for why. Could I possibly have had 2 bad bottles? Seems unlikely but I'm way off from other reviewers that normally I find a lot in common with. Since it's Rogue, I'll give it one more chance down the road. Unless dramatic improvement, one and done."
"D: easy to drink, solid flavor and no alcohol taste, so I'd say high although for me it would be higher if this were sweeter or more milk chocolate in flavor"
"This is one of the top 10(out of about 250) beers that I've tasted in my life.. a very, very good beer."
"About the closest damn thing you are going to get to chocolate beer. More so (maybe not) than Choklat, or at least it has more beer/stout like flavor than this beer. I mean it has some wonderful toastiness that compliments an outstandingly sweet chocolaty aspect. And tastes much much bigger than the six percent would indicate. Every brewer could take a lesson in the head retention that this beer shows. A half inch cap of sandy brown froth all the way through the session. Maybe just a tad too sweet for my tastes, but I'm not really a chocolate fan and I'm still beyond impressed. A must try for anyone interested in chocolate stouts or stouts in general."
"Would have preferred a little more sweetness but still quite good."
"This beer is basically a Shakespeare Stout with tons of chocolate poured in. I prefer the Shakespeare, but this one is worth a look, but you probably already know that."
"Drinkability: While I would like a slightly fuller mouthfeel, this beer is top notch all around"
"D: Very drinkable for a chocolate stout."
"everything just works in concert to produce a great beer. Highly recommended."
"Pour resulted in a nice two fingers of head with very nice lacing. The smell of chocolate was good but not as good as the draft. The taste was bitter chocolate with a hint of coffee? This beer is as dark as the night sky which is quite impressive. Overall a really good beer but I have to recommmend the draft over the bottle."
"Deep dark ominous appearance. Nice complexity in the nose, and somewhat the same in the palette. Good balance of flavors with none of the components too overpowering. Light, hearty feel. A good sipping beer. Great quaff."
"Great chocolate stout. Highly recommended."
"this was presented to me at cobblestones in a sampler glass(about 7oz.). beautiful dark body with a thick tan head. I'm not into chocolate stouts but this was exceptional. you can smell the chocolate. very good rich taste. I will be back for a pint or two sometime in the near future."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are great. Simply stunning. This beer is a total beer-drinker's dream."
"Drinkability: Not for the weak. I really good strong stout ale!! Indeed, can I have another?"
"Overall: Pretty drinkable, nice balance of hops and sweet malt, nice amount of chocolate, alcohol not very noticeable"
"Overall- This is a really good stout, one of my favorite stouts that adds chocolate. This is a beer that makes me appreciate Rogue all over again."
"D - It's acceptable in this regard, but only because it's more of a dessert item than a beer. Some will find this a good thing, but I really do not. This coming from someone that loves Young's Double Chocolate, etc."
"Outstanding! Had many chocolate stouts and this one takes the cake. Rich, black color with 2 finger lasting head. Creamy mouthfeel and very chocolaty taste. The only negative was a somewhat weak smell, but as far as stouts go, the smell is pleasant. Could drink this one all day."
"D - While I quickily downed the bomber, I'm not sure if I could drink another. The sweetness is seriously strong."
"M - Really nice and velvety, creamy, full bodied."
"D: with all the killer ""big"" beers out there, this is one standard I could come back to over & over without breaking the bank or the ABV tolerance."
"D--One of my favorite beers. Very enjoyable, I would guess that it has broad appeal."
"D - Despite the strong flavors and full texture, this is a marvelously easy beer to drink. Additionally, this beer is an absolute desert. I would rather have a mug of this at the end of a meal than a dessert served on a plate."
"Only complaint with this beer is it wasnt as thick in the mouth as I would have liked, but otherwise, great"
"D-Easy to drink and at 6.99 for the 750 I could easily see me picking this up every once in a while."
"mouth is smooth and creamy and a bit oily. finishes bitter and leaves me wanting more. Drinks very slow but easy. Good and one of the best chocolate stouts around."
"D: An up-and-down beer with good looks but not a balanced enough flavor which could be served by more body and a toned down acrid character. A let-down overall."
"D: A solid chocolate stout -- delivers the mouthfeel and impressive presence. However, it lacks staying power. It's just too sweet to drink more than one 12ozer, and this bomber is hard to finish beyond the halfway point. I enjoyed it at first, but by the end I was completely sick of it and I never want to have it again."
"A rather disappointing chocolate stout from Rogue"
"This is a very solid stout that is worth a visit every once in a while."
"Poured from a 650 ML bottle into a brandy snifter, this beer presented itself well. A deep dark burnt umber with a very decent mocha colored head that to some degree lingered to the end. Aroma of chocolate...period. The smell was pure chocolate and lacked the other nuances of a typically well done chocolate stout. Stir in a spoonful of dark coco into your next porter or stout and you'll get the idea. The taste was, frankly, disappointing. An unpleasant bitterness lingered after each sip. Once you get past the chocolate, you're kind of drinking a Guinness with a little more body. Whether this bitterness comes from bakers chocolate or a big shot of hops...or both, I couldn't tell. But to my palate, this stuff is unpleasant. The bitter aftertaste lasts until you brush your teeth. From previous reviews, I expected better. I'll take a Young's Double Chocolate, thank you."
"Pourd inky transparent black tan head. Aroma of licorice, baker's cocoa, sugar cookie, red fruit. Taste is great like cocoa powder, licorice again, dark roasted malt, some coffee, kiss of hops. I whipped this into some cream and tossed into some grated chocolate for a brownie topping. Excellent stuff - drank the entire bottle myself! My go to chocolate stout!"
"D= Very high. Pretty good brew. Great chocolate taste but little complexity."
"Pours a dark, opaque milk chocolate color with a creamy, dark tan head that leaves sticky lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma is rich and sweet like cocoa, milk chocolate, maybe a little coffee. Like aroma, huge sweet milk chocolate taste, cocoa powder, etc. Slight roast bitterness in finish. Medium bodied, but very creamy. A very nice dessert beer, and very pleasant with the low alcohol (comparable to other stouts). Chocolate is the most dominant flavor, but never out of control or overpowering."
"So I started this sampling waaay too cold. Rookie move. Very interesting how it really opened up as it warmed. Specifically the aroma went from almost nothing to chocolaty plums. The taste opened up too (not as surprising) and the mouthfeel became less thin. Even after it warms it's only a B+ for me."
"Taste is also excellent. I feel like chocolate beers can be very overdone, but Rogue strikes a great balance here. The healthy bitterness of this beer definitely contributes to that balance. Malty, not overly sweet as the aroma may suggest. Tons of dark, bittersweet chocolate. Usually I get more coffee with these types of stouts, but here the chocolate is actually an ingredient. Tasty, but the mouthfeel was not as chewy and coating as I wanted it to be. Occasionally the flavor is a little too syrupy-chocolatey, but overall it's very good. Very drinkable for a stout."
"D: Was pretty good with food. Wasn't that fantastic by itself."
"This is very drinkable. I find the tastes to balance and if you pace yourself it does not take up too much room in the stomach."
"22 ounce bottle. Almost opaque black with a lasting frothy light brown head. Nice looking. Pretty light on the aroma side. The chocolate comes of like obvious extract to me. Theres some slight coffee, and a good punch of hops in the flavor. Palate is okay. easy to drink. Not something I'd want to drink again though."
"Wow, this is some beer. Super drinkable, complex as the best women always are, at 6% you could have a couple. I have got to go get a couple more of these."
"This is one of the very best stouts I have had. It may be the best stout. It is really easy drinking and very tasty. It also has just enough bitter hops taste to remind you it is a stout. This would make for a very good after dinner beer."
"An opinion which most would share, however, is that Rogue Chocolate Stout is a titillating beer. It marries roast, chocolate and hops in a delicious, decadent and balanced manner. This should be a staple in the beer fridge of anyone who enjoys stouts, chocolate, or dessert. This Oregon brewery makes some wonderful beers and this particular one still has to be top on my list of favourites. Recommended."
"This isn't a kicking stout, but that isn't necessarily bad. Still, I've had better in the past."
"The drinkability for me was low due to the over the top chocolate flavor and heavy body. I managed to knock out a bomber in about 1 hour playing cards. Very tasty brew."
"OVERALL: An excellent chocolate stout that definitely delivers. Drinkable and enjoyable, but it would be hard to drink more than a couple glasses before having to move on to something else. Highly recommended and I'll be getting more next time I see it."
"Pours a dark, opaque, chocolaty brown with a thick tan head. Rich aroma is chocolaty and has just a hint of smoke or roast coffee. Flavor is mainly of unsweetened chocolate and has coffee, hoppy and nutty hints; and is slightly bitter. Silky smooth texture leaves a nice aftertaste of unsweet chocolate."
"Drinkability: This beer would be great with chocolate dessert or could be dessert all by itself. But given the mildly unpleasant aftertaste I'd probably not drink a second or third in one sitting."
"I had this at Isaac Newton's in Newtown PA.Poured from a bottle into a PILSNER GLASS ??? Again I am as befuddled as you are. Pours black with a coffee colored creamy heading. Smell is crazy with chocolate and barley. Taste is not much different with overpowering chocolate that balances very well. The easiest stout to drink and by far the best so far. I can't say much more about this but if you want chocolate ecstasy you got it."
"This is much more balanced and just plain better than any other chocolate beer I've had (especially you, ST Choklat). A truly exceptional beer."
"Pours a dark brown to black color, with a ton creamy head on top. The head is two inches high and shows tremendous retention, lacing slowly down the glass. The sweet scent of chocolate is apparent with a malty sweetness as well. A touch of grassiness at the end of each scent. The chocolate and malt combine to make an assault on the taste buds, being very dominant. Then it gradually blending to a grapefruit bitterness, that is not to overbearing at the end. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky, with a syrupy clingingness at the end. This maybe a beer for breakfast. WOW! This stout brings the flavor, great aroma, and a silky feel, plus it goes well with chocolate cake."
"I highly recommend this beer to anyone who loves really dark chocolate. I am not one of said people though, so I personally will not be purchasing this again, but this beer definitely hits what it aims for."
"Excellent all around, I could sip on this Stout all night. Nothing disappoints, every aspect of this beer is great."
"D- The only thing that prevents me from drinking this beer at all times is the price. Otherwise, I would be downing multiple bombers daily."
"Black with a small brown head and good amount of lacings. Smell is chocolate fudge cake. Taste is rich bitter chocolate with hints of coffee and a full bitter medium dry finish. Mouthfeel is just the right amount of carbonation. Not normally a big stout drinker but this was was like a dessert. I am thinking this would be a fine companion to a chocolate cheese cake."
"D - I'm not sharing this bottle! I'm not sure why I haven't had this one more often. Very good chocolate stout. What a treat!"
"Mouthfeel is rich, thick and creamy. Almost milky. Medium to full bodied. Has a flat feel to it though due to the lack of carbonation. Nothing that hurts the brew too much, though. Drinkability is great, as this is definitely a top notch chocolate stout. The flavors never tire and as it warms, more flavors come out. I will definitely be revisiting this brew. Rogue really did well with this."
"Medium on the edge of full body overall. Excellent brew. True chocolate taste that is niether overly sweet, nor artificial. 6% abv makes this easy to enjoy more than a pint. or 2."
"D - goes down easy, a tasty, enjoyable brew."
"Picked this brew up the other day, I was not sure what to think based on the amount of chocolate flavor that I figured would be there. The brew poured to a black color with a thick lighter brown head that had great retention and lacing. The aroma was dominated by the chocolate aroma, bittersweet. Also adding to the bitterness was the hops, with 60+ IBUs I figure that this would add to that perceived aroma? Also was a mild aroma of coffee and slightly burnt grains. The taste was dominated by the same bittersweet chocolate that was picked up on the nose, but also there was a nice malt flavor that seemed to add a dryness. That dryness was mixed with an ample hop presence at the tail. I feel that the flavors of this brew where good, it (bomber bottle) was just to much for me. The flavors just seemed to get to me after a while. I made my way through it but it took time and at the end some effort. The feel was a little syrupy with adequate carbonation. This brew is clearly worth trying and probably would be great going along with a chocolate type dessert. For me I would clearly rather have the Shakespeare Stout from Rogue."
"Overall: The one thing that would keep me from enjoying this often is that the chocolate flavors dominate. I'd probably save it for a desert beer, since I'd have a hard time pairing it with a dinner."
"Pours with an enormous head, thick and frothy and takes forever to subside, completely black-brown without a hint of yellow nor orange. Dark chocolate, coffee bean, even caramel, touches of plum or cherry fruit, even you can zen out, a nicely bitter hoppiness appears. In the mouth it's full-bodied yet in no way heavy, nimble as it has some serious carbonation to keep it from sinking too too deeply. Sure, unsweetened chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, it delivers what the label says. And, as the nose subtly suggests, there's some hoppy spine here as well, not all about the sweetness. Moderate length on finish, as if crafted to be so. No noticeable flaws."
" Mouthfeel is lighter than expected, making this beer easy to drink. Put it in cases and watch it sell like hotcakes. I know i would buy it."
"My first Rogue beer. I was not impressed."
"I would imagine that many non craft drinkers would enjoy this for a change of pace from Bud or Miller. But after experiencing some of the chewy, creamy, full bodied mouth explosion varieties of the style, this one is not in the same class (for me)"
"d- what can I say? this is a heavy, rich, dark chocolate dessert kind of beer with an immense and complex flavor. Holy crap is it good, but if you're like me you'll likely feel pretty full (in a good way!) after one bottle of this. Unless you're sharing, of course, but... share? really?"
"Very drinkable. Heavy, but the finish is just as complex and full as the rest of the beer."
"With the economical pricing of Rogue beers, this would be a great one to have on hand, most of the time."
"This is the only other chocolate stout I put in the same category with Young's Double Chocolate Stout as the best chocolate stouts available. Pure drinking delight and in a way almost too seductive in nature. Heavy mouthfeel that's light on carbonation and overflowing with a rich, dark chocolate flavor. Not too bitter with a strict stout aftertaste. I'd say the Rogue Chocolate Stout offering is slightly sweeter than Young's which is the only thing I feel sets these two apart. All in all a great stout and one that I anticipate drinking again (next time I hit the Brewhaus!)"
"Taste starts off very heavy and creamy smooth. Has a creamy chocolate in the beginning and a dark chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is heavy, creamy and chewy. Goes down very smooth and not too sweet or too much roastiness, so it doesn't get old fast."
"Good drinkability, doesn't get cloying. A pretty decent offering from Rogue."
"Easy and good to drink, would buy again in a second. Very nice."
"Rogue's Chocolate Stout pours a sturdy black with a lovely foamy tan head. The nose is filled with chocolate and roasty aromas with a few sweet and toffee-like notes to it as well. Aside from the obvious chocolate in the flavor there is also a great coffee and cream flavor in there as well. There is also a nice bitterness to it as well from the hops. The mouth fell is nice and thick and it is so smooth going down. I think I will try my first ice cream beer float with this beer."
"Drinkability A good beer for the winter. Not by favorite type of beer but a good choice for this category."
"Not the best chocolate stout that I have had, that would go to ST but still a nice stout."
"For under $5 a bomber, I will always keep these in stock!"
"22 oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. Pitch black in color with a thick rich head on top. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee, raisins, and figs are on the forefront. Gulp. Thick in texture, creamy in a sort of way. The chocolate is the star and is not shy about it. One of the better stouts I ever had the pleasure of sipping. Very drinkable and very recommendable. Will try again soon."
"Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected, but a very easy drinking beer do to the combination of all factors."
"Pours a black/very dark brown color, Big thick head-tan, good sized bubbles, slowly diminishing, like a good stout should be. Strong aroma of hops, chocolate, nuts, very interesting aroma. Strong chocolate malt taste, semi-bitter taste, overall pretty smooth flavor."
"Overall this tastes like a tootsie roll; a candy I am not fond of. I do enjoy the beer but as a chocolate stout it isn't one of my top faves."
"Delicious chocolate stout. I have not been the biggest fan of some chocolate- and coffee-flavored beers, but this one really nails the balance of flavors, never tastes artificial and still has a sweet, dessert-like flavor. The beer looks just phenomenal. It's a rich black. If you hold something colored matte black to it, you can see the faintest shade of brown, giving body to the utter blackness. The beer is entirely opaque, as far as I can tell with a wide glass and a strong light source. The head is thick and rich and leaves wonderful sticky lacing. The beer smells like expensive cocoa powder mixed with cacao nibs and a dash of roasted coffee beans. The flavor is wonderful. The chocolate is perfectly used. The beer isn't too sweet or too chocolatey. There are good mineral and earthy hop notes. The malt backbone is big and strong. It's an enormous flavor for a stout that clocks in at a mere 6% abv, a trifling amount compared to some of the Imperial versions. The lush, creamy feel is the finishing touch. This beer and Rogue's Shakespeare Stout are both such incredible stouts. They're among the best of all stouts, regardless of size, and remain affordable amongst the increasing prices of micro-brewed beers."
"This is an extremely smooth beer that goes down easy and something I could easily have a few of throughout the night. Reviewed this a week after the Sam Adams Chocolate Bock (which I did enjoy for the most part) but personally there's no competition here, Rogue wins this battle hands down. More smooth and full flavored at less than half the price. Not a beer to pass up if you haven't tried it yet."
"The beer? Rouge's Coffee Grounds Stout might be a better name. Some folks must be into that flavor. For me, no thanks. If you're going to drink it, let it come closer to room temperature first. I found it more tolerable that way. Thin body that I wouldn't expect from such a dark, frothy brew."
"Pours black in color with an average light brown head that dissipated into a light ring. The aroma is big and chocolatey, some stale coffee, and a hint of hops in the end. The taste is of bitter chocolate, roasted malt, hard water and a touch of grains. The stout has a moderate body, lighter than expected, soft carbonation and finishes bitter. A nice bitter chocolate stout, great aroma and good flavor."
"D: The flavors in this beer just make you want to keep coming back for more. A great American beer and perfect for the winter months."
"D - This is the first brew to which I've given straight 5's. Everything about it is spot on. Perfect balance of malt, hops and chocolate flavor. What makes it even better is that it's very affordable. I paid less that $5.00 for the bottle. Try it!"
"D: A great stout that I look forward to buying again. I would have no problem having a couple of these tasty treats. This is my favorite Rogue beer to date, however I'm yet to try the Shakespeare Stout which i hear is just as impressive."
"When drinking this beer I felt like I needed more. I personally have a sweet tooth and this beer satisfied my craving for sweets, but made me wanting more. I do feel like if I drank too many of these beers I would have a stomachache, the same one you would have with too much candy. Either way I am going to buy more of these when I can and I will enjoy every single one. Good Brew!"
"This is just like having a little taste of heaven in your mouth. Very sweet but not nauseatingly so, with a nice alcohol background to ground it back into reality. So smooth and delightful that I want to drink this thing like it's delicious chocolate milk!"
"Chocolatey, dry and chalky. Some hints of complexity, but never really opened up to reveal more than the mocha/chocolate notes. Bitter on the finish, but clean. Very nice with something sweet. I would not describe the taste as thin, but certainly one-dimensional. It may be decent for what it is, but I do not feel the need to return."
"This would be something you would serve at the end of the night after dinner. I probably would serve this to newbies on holiday events."
"Not as creamy as led to believe, but all the chocolates are there: milk, dark, bitter. Some coffee on the tale matched with bitter chocolate and to a decent dryness. Not much complexity, but exactly what the name leads to believe, chocolate. A little thinner then I was hoping for. Rich, roasted malts at the end as well."
"Drinkability: Nice, drinkable beer. Can't see drinking more than a few, but very tasty."
"The overall drinkability is quite good also. I think it could have been a little better if it had been just a bit fuller in the body and flavor, but overall a great beer and I'm glad I've got more of it on supply."
"good mouthfeel but average drinkability..."
"Drinkability: Too sweet and thick to have more than one, but I will definitely buy this again. It is one of, if not the, best chocolate beers I've had. An excellent substitute for a dessert."
"D: This is by far the best chocolate stout I have ever had. While there is imported chocolate as detailed on the bottle, the mixture of malts and hops with this is pure joy."
"(rated May 22, 2008)"
"This is one very rich and filling stout. One bottle is just right."
"This brew is so smooth and chocolatey I could see myself putting back a few of these"
"A finely crafted ale, for sure."
"Pours black with a decent, thick brown head. Aroma is bittersweet chocolate, cream, caramel, and just a little cigarette smoke. Creamy mouthfeel. Blended taste of chocolate, caramel malts, and oatmeal. Some vanilla cream. The cascade hops give it a sharp finish. Somewhat watery for the style. Very nice."
"3.5/5"
"Bottle and Tap"
"pour is opaque... massive head that recedes downward. chocolate colored head. nose is malt and chocolate. taste is similar to the expedition stout, bit more sour. nice chocolate... not superfluous. nice lace, lightly sticky. great feel. accompanied with a solid bitter. not chalky which makes the excessive chocolate gentle. good. no alcohol detected."
"It was damn good and well worth seeking out. Perfect amount of chocolate, slight roasty bitterness, but more than acceptable. Very nice chocolate smell and flavor. Surprisingly easy to drink, just a very nice experience overall. Rogue might be a little more expensive as bombers go, but this one is definitely worth a shot if you want your beer a little sweeter on a cold night."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- I love the subtle coarseness of the mouthfeel, as it provokes the sweet and bitter attributes to work with each other while adding texture. The most phenomenally delectable stout I can recall in ages... this is a true masterpiece, and should not be overlooked for the sheer reason of broad availability, as sometimes happens. Bravo."
"Dark pour with a creamy tan head that fades away very slowly. Chocolate aroma with a hint of hops coffee and roasted malt. . Very good mouthfeel and very smooth going down. I got the chocolate taste throughout the beer. The finish was deep smoky chocolate but very subtle. Will drink again and again"
"D - I'd do it over again.. for free. Hell, I'd even pay money to do it over again. Wonderful brew, absolute favorite as of yet."
"Gotta be in the right mood/mindset/weather for a chocolate stout, but when the mood hits, it will satisfy."
"I drank around 40 different beers while I was in Portland and Newport and after The Abyss on tap this was my second favorite beer I drank."
"I'm not as crazy on this beer as a lot of other people, but it is a structured and very drinkable stout."
"Great beer!"
"taste is smooth, milk chocolate, fudge brownie, and milk chocolate, also has a slight coffee to it, some vanilla, touch of nuts, ends a little bitter and a little sweet."
"WOW, where do I start. My favorite stout on the planet right now. Out of a 22oz bomber is a creamy blackness producing a nice creamy brown head. Smells like chocolate to me, lol. Not the cheap stuff either. I was surprised when I tasted it. The chocolate flavor is definatly overpowering like most stouts with chocolate. It's very well balanced. Mouthfeel is that of the shakespeare stout. Very creamy. #1 in my fridge, even though you can only have 1 or 2 at a time."
"D - Drinkable and enjoyable... Not to sweet... A solid and well balanced stout... A bit rough around the edges..."
" That's the best way I can describe Rogue Chocolate Stout, a good beer with added flavor that's been overdone. I'll stick with Young's Double Chocolate Stout, which tastes like beer, but reminds me of chocolate, not the other way around."
"D - A little heavy for a session beer, but this was a very drinkable stout. I really enjoyed this one and plan on hunting down some more."
"D - This is another solid beer by Rogue, the only reason they don't get less than a 4 in this catagory is because this beer is so damn good"
"I couldn't drink too much of this mostly considering the price. However, if it was free i'd drink it all day long."
"Pours a cocoa colored brown with thin white head. Aroma dominated by chcolate malts roasted coffee and tostie rolls. Flavor once again dominated by chocolate and chocolate malts. Nice roasted character and hops provide a tasty bitter dry finish. Very Good!"
"Thinner and less chocolate than expected. Not that it's a bad thing. I still enjoyed it."
"Poured a bomber into my Tripel Karmeliet glass. Wow, this is a like the Mona Lisa poured into a tulip. Just beautiful. This beer pours a nice dark brown with a huge 3 finer beige head that looks like it has the consistency of amaretto soaked ladyfingers. As the head melts into a nice thin layer, it leaves really nice lacing. The lacing actually reminds me more of what a resiny DIPA leaves behind on the glass, then an American stout should. The aroma is of Hershey's Milk Chocolate Syrup, cream, and just a slight hop bitterness at the end of the nose. The taste is a bit disappointing to me. Its very one dimensional. Baker's chocolate and sweet cream, that's about all. The mouthfeel is full and cream but surprisingly doesn't linger all that much. This is a good beer but the flavor profile seems to be lacking just a little for me."
"D: For a stout pretty good, but still a bit too sweet to have too many."
"I am a big fan of Rogue and this is unquestionably one of their best offerings...Definitely worth a try!"
"Creamy and rich feel on the tongue. Milky, with a tiny bite at the swallow. Otherwise, as smooth as it gets. In this beer, chocolate is the name of the game. Sweet (but not saccharine) and very smooth. Quite quite good."
"D= One of the better beers I have had from Rogue and certainly one of the best chocolate stouts out there. I wish the flavor matched the sweetness of the aroma more, but still a very drinkable beer."
"D - Smooth and easy to drink, but the taste isn't what I was expecting."
"Good beer, probably one of the better chocolate stouts that I've had."
"Very drinkable - low alcohol, and not a harsh tone to be found. Bravo!"
"A good solid stout, with chocolate adding a nice creamy sweet touch. This one delivers what it promises. I only wish it were available cheaper here."
"Rich floral aroma with a dark bitter chocolate scent. Black pour with a 3/4"" head that settles down to a solid 1/4", but no lacing ouch. Mouthfeel is much thinner than anticipated, finish is primarily bitter. Flavor is decent, the chocolate doesn't come through as much as in the aroma and the bittering hops seem to have a tight grasp on the taste. Overall this is not one of my top picks, kind of bummed out. The regular Shakespeare is much better. I'll be using what's left in the bomber to make a black and tan, Cheers!"
"Future outlook: Disappointed in this one. Doubtful that I will revisit it anytime soon."
"If it weren't for the high price point of the beer, I'd probably give this a higher drinkability score. Phenomenally good for a ""sweet stout," which is one of the few beer styles I have a hard time enjoying."
"This beer pours a dark brown that is almost black with a nice frothy off white head that sticks around for a while and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells of chocolate and coffee malts. Tastes of chocolate syrup, coffee malts and ends with a nice bitter finish. The mouthfeel is thinner than I expected and not as smoothed as I had hoped but holds up decently. Drinkability is good. I had no problem finishing the bomber but would not want another."
"D: loved this beer, I'd buy it again for sure. With only a 6% ABV you could easily have two of these!"
"D-This beer was enjoyable throughout the whole bottle. However, drinkability is moderate, as the chocolatiness could prove to be too assertive in the long run. But for one sitting, this beer is a treat."
"D - Too sweet to drink more that one in an evening, but something that would be good to have on hand when you need a chocolate fix. Good stuff!!"
"I would go with the ommegang chocolate or brooklyn."
"Drinkability- On the flip side of a light stout it is more drinkable, one of the few stouts I could have more than one of."
"Overall - A excellent chocolate Stout although a little more chocolate in the taste wouldn't go amiss... recommended..."
"Have to admit...I REALLY like this one. Everything about it screams Rogue. They are a top notch brewery that puts out top notch stuff. This one is the epitome of choc stouts. Dark...basically totally opaque. Sweet chocolaty goodness whafting during pour and drinking. Taste..sweeet and smooth. Minor in thickness-lacking but thicker than 75% of others in the stout category. Almost too drinkable...and at the price, I had to cut myself off. Great beer!...GO GET ONE. NOW!"
"Overall, very impressed as to how rich the chocolate taste in this beer. Definitely will be picking up a few more bottle of this."
"Great beer when in mood for overt chocolate."
"i had aged this bottle in my closet for 1 and half months...then in the fridge for another 2 and half...i think i will keep this routine as the one i had fresh was not as chocolatey as this one...also turned the bottle to stir up the bottom a bit to bring out more flavor...very nice...i will get more"
"D: A very good stout, not my favorite. Drinkable in that it isnt overly filling but I find it somewhat too sweet like a chocolate bar."
"In Minnesota, the best always comes first....Right? I thought so!"
"Drinkability- Very tasty. This was suggested to me after I couldn't find a Sam Adams Chocolate Bock and I was very satisfied. I would definitely have another. But it is heavy and filling so be prepared."
"I first starting drinking the Rogue after I moved in with my roomate and he collection the Rogue bottles and I have always wanted to try them after reading the describitions on the bottles. Its a great stout, its dark, creamy head, can seriously tatse the chocolate. Could drink it again and again."
"Overall, this stuff lives up to its reputation. I could drink this wonderful brew all day long."
"This beer is everything a chocolate stout should be - it's dark, pillowy-headed, richly flavored, with just the right mix of beer and chocolate. Not too little or too much alcohol. Perfection in a glass."
"D: An amazing American Stout. The chocolate flavor is subdued and natural tasting - never in your face. Great stuff. Highly recommended."
"yes yes yes."
"Beautiful beer! Pours black in colour with huge, I mean HUGE caramel brown head with lots of lace. Smell - dark chocolate, coffee, malts. Taste is the same, less chocolate that I would expect, but still really deep taste. Mouthfeel - silky, with medium carbonation. Drinkability - yes, it's drinkable, but honestly, based on reviews I expected a bit more from this one."
"This is a fantastic chocolate stout - I hope to find it again soon!"
"D: This is a super easy drinking beer. No sipping necessary, you can take a mouthful and down it with ease."
"Overall: great beer"
"d- i could drink these through a divorce, then again through alimony...thank you rogue...a nice session stout."
"On first poor the color is dark with a nice light tan head formation . The aroma is full of dark malt , coffee , with hints of underlying vanilla . The first sip leads to a cascade of great stout flavors chocolate coffee and roasted malts abound . By far one of the best stouts I have had for a while . The body is on point for the style . Drinkability is an issue though not because it isn't appealling but because it is to appealling and very potent ."
"I may complain about the price, but this beer is world class."
"Overall a great example of a chocolate stout - the best I've had."
"Drinkablilty: Quite delicious. I liked it more and more as I finished the bottle."
"D- I could drink this for as long as my sweet tooth is awake and then some just for kicks. The bittersweet aftertaste makes you want more after every sip."
"Poured midnight black into a mug. The smell was of chocolate milk, and coffee. Taste was chocolate up front with a campfire type coffee with chicory. A smokey, bitter finish. No one could say that this is not a well crafted brew, its just not my bag. Too much of a good thing that my palate grew tired of quite quickly. I will probably not be revisiting this offering again anytime in the future."
"Cheers!"
"Pours dark black with a brownish, creamy head that soon sinks down. Aroma is dark chocolate and roasted malts. Taste is at first dominated by roasted malt flavors, but gives way to milk chocolate flavors. An overall delicious, perfectly balanced chocolate stout."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Medium-bodied. Drinkability is awesome. This is one smooth and delicious stout."
"Drinkability: Definitely one of the finer stouts that I have enjoyed. No more than one for me in a sitting, but a beer that I would like to drink again."
"Super drinkable. I put away the entire bomber myself. Killer beer. One of my favorite offerings from Rogue."
"An expansive gloomy head with great retention over an ebony vacuum. The scent is of tantalizing Dutch dark chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is absolutely unbelievable. Rich chocolate cake with a warm swirl of alcohol, topped with a taste of cascade hops to add to the bittersweet cocoa finish. Medium to heavy, very balanced mouthfeel. One bomber was not enough to satisfy. Need more. Many more. The bar has been raised. Hats way off to this one."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Just great big bold flavor, and low alcohol makes this one easy to consume and enjoy."
"Bomber. Pours a very black color, moderate tan head that doesn't last long. Chocolate, malty aroma, although not all that strong. The flavor is pretty nice with dark chocolate right away with subtle malts and bitter hop notes following. This seems more like a dessert. Hell, maybe it can be. I can't drink too many of these chocolate beers though. A simple 12 ounce would have been fine."
"The first time I had this was on cask at the Rogue Ale House in North Beach and I enjoyed it, but something about the effervescence of the bottled version increases my enjoyment. Definitely up there with Young's Double Chocolate. Maybe even a trump of it."
"mouthfeel is bitterly creamy, oat-y smoothness, and very very chocolatey - a great stout from rogue, would love to get 6 packs of this instead of bombers but quality comes at a price, very nice"
"Glad I finally tried this one."
"D: Not cloying, which is a big plus for a beer with such added flavours - at least in this style. With some more body, it would be an even better evening sipper."
"Overall, a great dessert beer that is worth drinking!"
"This beer pours a very rich black. The scent is undoubtedly of chocolate and chocolate malt. For some reason, this time around the beer tasted a little harsher than I recall. This might be due to the fact that I was previously drinking hazelnut brown which is so very smooth itself. At the very least, it has solid stout flavor, and also has the benefit of being another one of those few beers with chocolate that actually tastes like chocolate, but without tasting artificial or detracting from the actual beer flavor."
"This is the best beer I have had in quite a while. I highly recommend it."
"Definitely recommend this beer. Nothing else I can really say."
"Drinkability - Would I have another one of these? YES, and another, and another, and another. This is one mean ass beer to throw down as a dessert itself. Pair it up with something, anything, and don't share. You'll want it all just for yourself."
"Final impression: An outstanding beer! I really loved how the character changed as the beer went from fridge to near-room temperatures. I must always have a few bottles of this stuff around."
"This beer is smooth, silkly, & the cocoa comes on stronger with each sip. The alcohol warmth only becomes noticeable about halfway through the glass. Drinkability is low, this is one of those stouts that's heavy & filling."
"D - This is an amazing stout, and I'll definitely be having it again."
"Highly recommended. Nothing too crazy going on, but they have damn near perfected your classic American Chocolate Stout."
"D- a great stout overall."
"Highly recommend, this was alot better then I expected."
"Super good, smooth, and very drinkable despite the excess of chocolatey goodness."
"Beautiful dark brown color and nice smell. A remarkable beer. I have never had a chocolate stout or porter that resonated with so much chocolate. Extremely drinkable and pleasant although I can see some ""traditionalists"" potentially turning their nose up at its distinct flavor. I could give this no grade other than an A on my scale and there aren't many beers I can say that about. Anything I say won't do it justice."
"D - Well, I'm now a Chocolate Stout fan..."
"D - This is a very good beer looks everything about it is very good its very easy to drink it would be a very good dessert beer worth trying sometime"
"I am becoming a big Rogue fan!"
"Notes: Over all this has an easy drinking character with nicely balanced flavors that work well and complement each other wonderfully."
"Pours a pitch black brew that lets not a hint of light through. Huge, frothy, dark tan/brown head that retains with a deathgrip on the side of the pint glass. Smells of Hershey's chocolate syrup, sweet chocolate, lactose, roasty malts. Splendid. Taste is more sweet, roasty malty flavors balanced by the nice chocolate touches and a nice hop finish. Very well rounded. Mouthfeel is extremely velvety and thick, yet airy. Perfect amount of carbonation and finishes dry with help from the hops. Very drinkable, this tremendous beer is."
"D - Excellent! This is some good stuff."
"22oz bomber from Ron's in Farmington. Pours an opaque black body with an inch of tan head. Smells roasty with strong cocoa notes. Tastes very roasty with some grassy hops and strong cocoa notes, especially toward the finish. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. A superb stout in every way. Super tasty with just the right balance of flavors. A new favorite!"
"Overall: So far my favorite chocolate stout. Seems like it would go equally well with a uicy pok roast or a sweet dessert. Everything in this brew is so well-balanced. Top notch stout."
"Overall, the best chocolate stout ever."
"I've had this available locally a few years ago but I never got around to reviewing it so, I had to grab a bottle yesterday when I was in Ft Collins. I'm *so* glad I did!"
"Bought the 22 ounce bomber. The appearance was delicious: solid dark, brown head and creamy lacing. Aromas were particularly strong in a pure dark chocolate aroma, with hints of mocha, cocoa and toffee. Not too rich but very specific. Taste mirrored the hinted aromas even with the bitter, chocolate aftertaste. Now the mouthfeel does make it seem pretty frappey, but I felt it was way to bubbly and airy, almost like the consistency of a McDonald's milkshake. Overall, even with some texture issues, this is a brilliant chocolate stout."
"Don't expect to quench your thirst with this one, but do expect an enjoyable experience."
"Solid, solid beer. Flavor is solid and balanced, chocolate is powerful without being overpowering, and everything else in the supporting cast comes together nicely."
"D - Drinkability is good. The beer is a good example of how to showcase the chocolate flavor. I would gladly have more of this one. The alcohol is relatively low which makes is disappear even faster."
"D - Well, I drained the bomber in short time. I thought the chocolate content would slow me down, but not so. I'm not quite gonna call it sessionable, but it was a joy to drink. I will definately do this one again."
"A pretty good, and indeed chocolate-rich, Stout with a surprisingly strong bright fruit character juxtaposed on the dark malt and a pleasantly strong bitterness ruling over the finish."
"Mouthfeel is creamy very nice. Not a lot of carbonation. A nice stout to end the night with."
"D - I could go for a time with this. Reminds me of my own stout, which I am very partial to."
"D: With so much flavor, it has to be drinkable. A smooth, creamy feel also adds enjoyability to the experience. Chocolate stout is one of the most unique beers I've ever drank, and would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in beer."
"D - The lighter body definitely bolsters the drinkability. Fairly low abv, great flavor - it's a damn drinkable stout."
"Drinkability: I definitely wouldn't want more than one of these in a sitting; it's going to be hard just to finish this one. Doesn't mean I'm not enjoying it, though...."
"One of Rogue's best. There's little to nitpick about...this is hugely enjoyable, and highly drinkable considering the style."
"Pours dark brown with a tan head that disappates quickly. Strong aroma of chocolate, but with additinal notes of roasted coffee and licorice. Tatse of chocolate and hops which really shine through at the finish. Fairly well balanced. The chocolate malts are the highlight here, but the finish is bitter and lasting. One of Rogue's best beers."
"Revisiting the Chocolate Stout after about a year. If memory serves me correct, it's one tasty SOB. A semi-hard pour reveals a very dark brown, almost black brew with a rolling and dense dark tan head that carries itself proud to a slow finish and leaves a good lacing all around to remind you of itself. Smell is quite complex with sweet and dark chocolates, malts and caramel upfront and an essence of burnt wood and pine in the background. Tastes of dark chocolates, molasses, licorice, toffee and a good hit of bitterness and some slight smokiness to finish things off. Carbonation is just right for this medium to full-bodied, yet highly drinkable stout. Rogue always does me right."
"at first its a little bitter on the tongue but it melts into a nice chocolate flavor, with a good aftertaste. it is heavy and thick though, making it difficult to drink much of it."
"Appearance is very dark brown with a thick, brown head. It has a rather strong chocolate smell with toasty malts. It doesn't taste as strong of chocolate as it smells. There's a distinct roasted malt flavor that's buttery with a hint of coffee. It has a rather strong aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very thick without much carbonation. This beer is drinkable, but very thick and rich with powerful flavors, so I wouldn't recommend planning to drink something different afterwards."
"Drinkability is hurt a little by a lack of crispness and a finish so long that you always feel like you just took a sip. This is a very solid beer, but to be honest, it gets a little boring near the end of the bomber. I don't know if I'll purchase again anytime soon, but I still recommend it to stout lovers. Of course you already know that it's good anyway. Still doesn't beat the mighty Choklat in my book."
"What a wonderful beer. Deep milk chocolate permeates almost every aspect of the beer- from the taste to the aroma, and even the mouthfeel is like drinking a hearty chocolate milk that is just perfect. My one complaint is that I wasn't able to directly discern the hop contribution to the beer because the chocolate flavor and aroma was so great. Maybe there isn't one or maybe it's not needed. I'll leave it until my next try to decide, but this is certainly a great one."
"Overall, probably wont grab this again unless I was with a girl that wanted to try craft beer. Ehh"
"I plan to drink it again soon, its just that good."
"NOTE: One wise man couldn't finish his Rogue Chocolate Stout. He claimed it tasted like ashtray and decided to drink Miller Light instead. Our name will likely be changing to TwoWisemen_and_she-man_thing."
"D: Tasty if you like the intense chocolate, goes down ok, slightly filling, decent kick, good representation of style, I've had some chocolaty stouts before but I think this one overdoes it."
"Drinkability is OK, but trying it once was probably good enough for me."
"This beer poured very dark with a light head. The smell of the beer was of a chocolate bar!! The flavor of this beer is amazing Rogue certainly hit the spot for this one! No skimping of ingridients on this beer! It is certainly not something you can drink all night but it certainly has great flavor and is a beer I will suggest to all my beer loving friends."
" Cheers to all!"
"D: I really enjoyed this beer a lot, great flavor, not one I could have multiple in one sitting. But a tremendous beer."
"The complexity of the taste from start to finish is a plus. The dry, bitter finish makes me want to experience the silky, sweet, chocolaty all over again. I truly enjoyed this experience."
"You get what you buy here. It is a great beer that does not hide from what it is named. Fantastic."
"Remember how all the beer books from the late 90's praised rogue stouts to high heaven well guess what ; they still rock. Dark rich and luscious this is a beer to savour and pair with food. No faults in this beer and the chocolate notes are spot on. A classic that stands up against all the stouts produced lately."
"Best stout ive had to this day. When i saw this and it was called chocolate stout i thought sure no beer can taste like chocolate and be good. I was wrong. This beer pours like crude oil looks like dark chocolate and tastes like guess what? chocolate. and its wonderful. dont get me wrong you can tell the difference between this and a chocolate milk. You take your everyday coffee hinted stout give it rogue quality and add a bit more than a hint of chocolate and here we are. this stuff is way ahead of guinness in my book. doesnt have the slightest flat waterdown taste that you expect with an average stout. Very filling ive had a few 22s of the stuff and cant wait to get more. pace yourself and enjoy this one"
"D - i probably wouldn't have more than one as it is quite rich, but what a great beer this is, especially to share with a friend."
"M/D: Heavy but not brainy like typical stouts slightly bitter and of course has pretty good sweetness. The beer is dangerously drinkable and would go well with any dessert."
"drinkability - It took me a while to try this. I had this in the cellar for sometime now. Very tastey of you like chocolate."
"D: This is definitely a dessert beer, I can't think of any other time that I would like to drink this other than after dinner. It is pretty heavy, and rich, but very good, but one is definitely enough for me."
"This is it. This is The Chocolate Beer. I just had a session with Young's Double Choc, Terrapin WakeNBake, Meantime Coffee Porter, and this. This one was head and shoulders better. More chocolate flavor, more chocolate aroma, better roasted malt flavor as well. Hops in perfect balance, understated (especially for Rogue) but adequate. If a beer this robust can be a stand-by session beer then this is the one."
"little dissapoints but not a bad idea"
"Congrats, Rogue. You keep impressing me."
"Rogue Chocolate Stout pours a rich dark brownish black with a nice lingering head. The smell is strong of chocolate after the initial pour, but fades quickly. It has a nice taste, unfortunately it is accompanied by a rather non pleasant bitter aftertaste. This fades slightly as the beer warms. Bitterness and high carbonation is what stands out most to me in the mouthfeel. Drinkability wise I expected this to be less bitter, I guess thats why I keep on getting it. Overall its not bad, but I do think there are better Chocolate Stouts out there."
"A pretty good chocolate stout, but would be MUCH better if they lower the carbonation and smooth it out a bit."
"D- Very drinkable for a chocolate stout. However, I still could only drink a few before switching to something else. Would be a great after dinner drink to finish off the night."
"Still, all in all this is a pretty drinkable beer. I probably wouldn't want more than two back to back, and having something else in between to break up the strong chocolate taste wouldn't be a bad idea."
"D- As stated before, the body is a bit thinner than many stouts making this maybe a little too drinkable. Is that possible?"
"MF/D: Creamy texture, low carbonation, I personally found this to be EXTREMELY drinkable. I'd read in other reviews that this isn't a session beer, but I disagree, I had four of these before I knew what was going on (probably down to my wife helping herself every time my back was turned.) Excellent beer which I thoroughly enjoyed, so much so there's a growler of it sitting in my fridge. (Ooh, speaking of which...!)"
"The chocolate components are truly some of the best around."
"This poured out thick with a little bit of very dark brown head. It had a chocolaty scent, and a flavor to match. It tasted like a liquid bar of dark chocolate. Like chocolate milk, but beer. It was slightly bitter, but very drinkable. It had a good texture, and was just plain tasty. One of the best stouts I've ever had, if you're in the mood for chocolate."
"Full body and good carbonation. A very drinkable stout. No artificial flavoring here. This was good, but is much better fresh on tap. On nitro, this is close to a perfect beer."
"Taste is bitter up front, the sweetness from the nose is lost on the taste, but not entirely when it finished with a chocolate aftertaste, the carbonation is killer though, definitely needs to be toned down a bit as it ruins the creaminess of this beer."
"I love stout. I love chocolate. But this combo missed the mark for me."
"MF&D - Medium/Full bodied stout. Sticky and chewy mouthfeel. Not a beer to be sessioned, but I could see this one going great with a chocolate dessert or on its own."
"D- This is one of my favorite styles, and this is a great representative. I could easily drink many of these any time, any place. And with the Scharfenberger, I am telling you!"
"Creamy and sugary mouthfeel that coats the pallet of chocolate malt like flavors. I am drinking this AS desert. It is incredible by itself. Another flavored offering by this brewery, I did not care for. This one. Hell yeah!"
"On the mouthful angle, I would say that 1 bottle is enough, because of how beefy the beer is. With that negative out of the way, another awesome beer from Rouge. Cheers!"
"D- Complex, delicious. This is certainly a great dessert beer, but there's quite a bit of chocolate flavor, so I can see getting tired of it. But for now I'm happy to finish my bomber and enjoy a wonderful Rogue product."
"D: Not too shabby... i'd certaintly have one or two in a night if its on tap."
"A good beer to share with people interested in discovering something new and appealing. Have yet to find any food I could pair it with. I thought about trying saltine with good Belgian chocolate, but was afraid it might ruin the enjoyment of the beer."
"This is an extremely easy beer to enjoy, and worth grabbing a second. Big and smooth, this is certainly my favorite from Rogue. Outstanding."
"D - Awesome brew and with the low alcohol content it makes a welcome addition to any session brew schedule."
"deep brown color with a dark tan, 2 finger head on inital pour, head falls quick and lacing is thick at first. Smell is minor, getting very lite, almost hot chocolate smells, not as heavy as I expected.Tingaling on the tongue with a very nice chocolate after taste. This coming from someone that isn't a chocolate fan. Finish is a bit watery, slightly bitter. The roasted malt, smoky flavors really came out towards the end and when the beer warmed up. Not really my style, but I wouldn't turn one away if offered again."
"My man at Binnys recommended this one to me and I must say i was happy. The beer poured very dark almost black with no light shining through and a little over a 1 finger high dark tan head. Smell of chocolate is very apparent over everything else. The taste is great. A dry bitter chocolate taste with a good finish that gets easier to drink as you drink more. Good finish and very nice mouth feel with the right amount of carbonation. Very much recommend this to anyone looking for a chocolate stout to try."
"It finishes clean, taking care of some of the rich flavors and making it fairly drinkable."
"Poured the bomber bottle into my mug and received a one-finger frothy head that slowly died, leaving small lacings. This sat on what was essentially a black body that you could barely see through when held up to the light. Not to be redundant, but the smell is chocolatey. I mean, there are hints of other malts in there and hops, but putting my nose in my glass was akin to unwrapping a chocolate bar and smelling it. Not only does the beer have a very pronounced chocolate taste, but it has a dryer feel to it, as if there were coffee and/or roasted malts in it. A smooth beer overall with some hop catching you on the backbite. I detected mild fruit flavors, but that could be my imagination. I just wish Rogue would sell this in six-pack form rather than just the bomber bottle."
"Not really my bag."
"Poured a great opaque color with a wonderful tan head and excellent lacing. It has a very nice scent. a bit of burnt grains with a hint of chocolate. Outstanding taste! A great stout, with burnt grains and coffee flavoring, along wiht an absolutely wonderful dark chocolate taste. It's creamy and goes down great. One of the best beers I've ever had."
"This is a surprisingly drinkable beer for it's color! Taste is hearty without being too heavy. I could definitely sip on more than one of these in one night. Another great brew from Rogue."
"Deep black oily pour with a nice medium to small sized brown head. Smell is sweet milk chocolately. Pretty smooth tasting, with an obvious big flavor of chocolate up front, followed by a noticeable, but slight hop presence in the finish. Somewhat crisp carbonation. Rich and chocolately as expected and quite good, but very simple at the same time. Might have rated a bit higher had I been more in the mood for something dark and rich."
"D: Incredibly drinkable considering it's thickness. I'm sure that after 2 or 3 pints, I'll be full, but I'd still want another!"
"Drinkability: I think it goes without saying that if a beer reminds me of a sunday....it's very drinkable. I'm a big fan!!"
"A great beer. Silky smooth and an amazing taste. the people that pass this up are fools."
"D - I think it's a great beer that i will have many more times"
"This beer poured a thick opaque black with some brownish notes. The head was about 1 1/2 fingers of creamy tan that slowly diminished to a thin ring. A very slight amount of foam clung to the glass. It smelled of dark roasted malts with a subtle sweet chocolate aroma, and a bit of alcohol towards the end. The taste was very rich in dark malt and chocolate, with a small amount of alcohol in the finish. It wasn't as thick as I would like and quite a bit more carbonated than I am used to in a stout. However, this was a delicious, highly drinkable brew."
""
"The aroma was music to my nose. The chocolate wafted its way to brain in no time and was intoxicating. The flavor was supreme for an American Stout. Smooth and mellow the chocolate rolled over the tongue and down the hatch and within no time the bomber was gone. I tasted chocolate and berries and a hint of vanilla. Overall this is definitely the best stout of the chocolate variety I have tasted."
"I appreciate stouts ranging from the kick-in-the-nuts of a RIS like Old Rasputin to the creamy drinkability of Guinness draft. This offering from Rogue is just about a perfect combination of complexity of taste and repeat-drinkability. Will definitely order again...and again."
"Pours out a black brew with a dense 2 finger head.Head is dark tan.Has a very nice chocolatecoffeemild alcohol scent,,smells awesome. Taste of some hops,,coffee,,mildly chocolate,,less chocolate then i would have thought,,reminds me of unsweetened hersheys powdered cocoa in a can.A drier beer then i would have thought.Mouthfeel is nice. A good beer although i wouldnt give it an a+,,definitely something id have again."
"This beer appears black and pours a thick head that doesn't last long, but leaves lace on the glass. It smells like Count Chockula or nestle quick mix, chocolatey goodness. The tastes are cocoa, oats, tons of malts, a bit of hoppy bitterness, and more chocolate. It finishes with a nice roasty, cocoa flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth, thick, chewy, velvety, and tiny bubbles. My favorite chocolate stout so far, this beer is delicious, rich, and so smooth it can creep up on you."
"Another excellent beer from Rogue. One would think with all their offerings they would lose some quality, but this is definitely not the case!"
"Pitch black with good tan head and big blotchy lace. A barbeque and light chocolate-malt aroma. Chocolate malt flavor as well, like a milkshake with apple caramel background, a little toffee/coffee. Bitter highlights but generally mild and easy drinking. Sweet, pleasant, but not over the top. Smooth. A beauty."
"PS Nice Valentine's day mix with Cantillon Kriek 100% Lambic."
"finally- now i can eat my layered mocha cheesecake."
" Every time I discount Rogue beers, they seem to come up with another one that gives me hope. I hope they continue experimenting to come up with more beer that truly lives up to their potential."
"Poured from the bottle into my tasting glass. Very dark brown, not quite black, with a 1 1/2"" tan head. The nose is count chocolate, think of sticking your nose in a cup of hot chocolate. There is a little more going on in the nose, but the chocolate almost overpowers. The taste is a creamy wonderful chocolate stout, first the flavor of sweet chocolate, followed by fruity hop type flavor, rounded out but alcohol warming and a slight bitterness, like eating dark chocolate. Good stout if you are a fan of chocolate, like I am. I gonna drink one or two this evening."
"Magnificent. Simply fantastic. Pours a nice dark chocolate brownish-black with a small, dark tan head. The nose hints at the forthcoming chocolate. The taste is tremendous. If you like chocolate, Southern Tier's Imperial Choklat is the only thing I've had in the neighborhood. In terms of mouthfeel, it was pleasantly bubbly without turning into champagne. As for drinkability, I had to fight off friends to whom I offered a taste. I will buy this each time I see it."
"I would still buy a bottle or 2 but it gets expensive as nobody sells them in builk and by the bottle its INSANELY priced."
"Drinkability: Decent drinkability, but lacking some body here. A very middle of the road in my opinion."
"D: has the delicious chocolatey taste but leaves an alcohol taste in my mouth. not the finest Rogue i've had."
"I may not have tasted that many chocolate infused beers, but this is the by far chocolatiest one that I have. Red hued black in color with a big mocha head. The nose is big sweet chocolate bars with a nice amount of citric hops, and some roasted malts thrown in for the hell of it. Not quite as sweet in the taste but the chocolate is definitely still there. Black and roasted malts come in as well, along with cocoa and citric hops in a light, bitter finish. Medium-full in body with lush and creamy carbonation. If you are a fan of chocolate, or a fan of beer; you will enjoy this one. It makes me want to go on a chocolate stout binge."
"Pours a pitch black, with a medium light brown head. This is one of the darkest beers Ive had, even shining a flashlight through it, it is almost completely opaque. Smells of chocolate and a hint of herbal hops. Tastes of dark chocolate truffles, with coffee, citrus, and hops as well. Bitterness is excellent and balances out the malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and rich, good carbonation levels. Due to all of the above, this is quite a drinkable beer. One of the best stouts I've had, as the chocolate adds a great flavor to this Ale."
"D: It's a really ""fun"" beer to drink. As has been recommended on the site before, it would do very well as a lone-standing dessert or paired with a chocolate-based dessert. I'll enjoy going back for it again and again."
"overall, i cant wait to get this again, would goes very nicely in the cold winter with a slice of apple pie, lovely"
"feel is smooth, slight pick-me-up with moderate carbonation."
"Drinkability at 6% is very good, alcohol not dominant, but i am not a huge fan of the bitterness in this one."
"This is really one of the great chocolate stout's especially for under $5 a bomber well worth the experience"
"All in a all an outstanding beverage that is truly a dessert in a bottle."
"Mouthfeel is just a tad too thin for my liking and too carbonated. Its a good chocolate stout but I was expecting a little more from this one."
"Pour black with a small tan head. In the aroma, a roasty malt and a small presence of chocolate. In the taste, chocolate and a malty sweetness. A a smooth and small maltiness in the mouthfeel and a semi dry choclate aftertaste. Quite smooth and a very nice chocolate presence."
"Pours an opaque darkness with a big foamy dark tan head that resists fading. Visible effervescence in the form of tiny pools on the surface. The smell is very nice. An aggressive earthy malt Hersey's dark chocolate mocha character that leads you to believe that there is serious sweetness to follow. The mouth feel is adequately carbonated with a solid note of hops. Full bodied and full flavored, the roast mocha comes out from beneath the semi-sweet chocolate taste and lingers nicely. A very good drinker with a lot to consider. IMO quite similar to ST Choklat. Enjoy!"
"This is one excellent beer. It pours a beautiful black from the bottle with a nice thick tan colored head. The aroma is of roasted malts and chocolate. It really is a nice aroma to start the beer to. The taste is excellent with roasted malts as a nice base followed by a the chocolate flavoring the aroma promised. The chocolate flavoring is perfectly balanced with the roasted malts for the right amount of bittersweet chocolate flavor. It has a great mouthfeel and it is really drinkable as I could drink a few of these 22oz bombers if I had the choice."
"D -- Easy to drink at an enjoyable pace. Had two of these and it was totally enjoyable...not too heavy or overwhelming. Jusy enjoyable. I love a stout and this is one of my favorites thus far."
"D: The bitter aftertaste was just too much for me. I finished the bottle only because I hate to waste beer. I've tasted great chocolate stouts, and I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone. The only reason it has a good grade at all is because it looks and smells really good."
"Rogue Chocolate Stout pours a rich dark brownish black with a nice lingering head. The smell is strong of chocolate after the initial pour, but fades quickly. It has a nice taste, unfortunately it is accompanied by a rather non pleasant bitter aftertaste. This fades slightly as the beer warms. Bitterness and high carbonation is what stands out most to me in the mouthfeel. Drinkability wise I expected this to be less bitter, I guess thats why I keep on getting it. Overall its not bad, but I do think there are better Chocolate Stouts out there."
"What a great chocolate stout. While the nose is almost comically strong, don't be fooled; this is an exceptionally good beer."
"Copped a 1pint, 6 fl. oz bottle from Bottle King in Livingston... The front logo brandishes a logo that says ""Made with imported chocolate""... Pours a jet-black, ebony color with tan head... dark, burnt chocolate aroma... deep espresso, dark cocoa taste with slight bitter aftertones... more bitter than sweet, although a slight sugarness is evident behind a thick, rich layer of creamy chocolate goodness... this is one brew that would go great with candy and sweet chocolates... good mouthfeel, but slight bitterness detracts from the overall drinkability... overall, a very good brew and another winner from Rogue... Definitely recommended..."
"On tap at the Rogue Public House. Damn...I wish Id bought more when this was available at the LCBO. Very dark black appearance with a mocha head. Aroma is all about chocolate, and whoah! So is the flavour! Melted chocolate, with hints of smoke and coffee. Smooth drinking and pleasant mouth feel. Extremely drinkable and highly recommended, but perhaps a tad one-dimensional."
"D:Amazing chocolate stout. Hands down the best chocolate stout I have had to date"
"poured from 22oz bottle into New Beligum snifter. Poured a jet black with thick mocha tan head. Smell bitter dark chocolate with roasted malt. Taste is like dark chocolate with milky vanilla creamness finished with a hint off coffee. Mouth feel is full but very creamy with a satin like finish. I could drink this choc. milk all day."
"This is a substantial beer with a singular profile that's a standout."
"Recommended."
"D: It's good, but not blowing up my skirts. I think I liked the Hazelnut Nectar a bit more."
"I drainpour a beer basically never (Samuel Adams Triple Bock being the other example I can think of). A good third of this puppy went right down the sink."
"D- Well-balanced and smoothly sweet stout, i would have preferred a little less coffee so that the chocolate could have come through a bit more, easy-drinking at 6%, good for a treat in small quantities"
"Overall, this is a great beer. I will definitely stock this in my personal stock on a regular basis."
"You gotta try this one. Keep up the good work Rogue!"
"This is by far the best chocolate stout I have tried to date. (keep in mind that these reviews are off notes from long ago and my palate is much different now than then) The chocolate flavor is smooth and perfect as far as I am concerned. If there is another one out there that is better, I cant wait to try it. As far as appearance goes it is dark brown with a thick head."
"black with a tan head that didn't hold as well as i was hoping, but did have pretty good staying power, and left great lace. nose was bittersweet dark chocolate, coffee, and hops. taste was just what the nose suggested, and was fairly well balanced, but the hops stood out just a little too much for my taste in a chocolate stout. nice, full body, with a little bitter finish. i believe this is a must try for a chocolate stout fan, and it won't leave you dissapointed."
"Pours a solid black with a thick fluffy tan head that stuck around for most of the experience. Initially the smell was all citrus hops, but as it warmed a bit I started getting some chocolate and some coffee. As I write this the chocolate is taking over, smells like hershey's special dark. There is a roast bitterness in the taste, but I think some of that bitterness comes from the chocolate as well. I once homebrewed a chocolate stout with pure cacao nibs, and this has that taste that I got. Taste has some hops in it as well as that silky chocolate taste. Mouthfeel gets better as it warms, I initially thought it a bit thin. Great brew, I'm glad I chose it today."
"I got very little head in my glass and little lacing, but the body is pitch black and intiminating. The smell is extremely inviting, lots of sweet milk chocolate. From the aroma, I was guessing I would be drinking a chocolate shake, but my minor complaint is you can only taste the chocolate towards the end of the sip. It starts out like a stout, roasted bitterness and coffee, before you get to the gold, which is the chocolate. Despite the thick appearance, it goes down easy. I can't say I was dissapointed, I just was expected a different journey in the taste."
"The stout pours black with thin tan head, quickly dissipates into a ring. The nose is chocolate and coffee. Dark chocolate. At first taste the coffee seems stronger to me than the chocolate. Coffee bean, chocolate and some toffee. a bit of smoky flavor but not much. mouthfeel is a little thin, but sufficient. Drinkability is quite high. A smooth drink. a good one from rogue."
"Opaque black with a mocha brown head that dissipates to a layer of foam. Not a lot of lacing but it might be my new glass. The first aroma is chocolate, not chocolate malt but chocolate bar chocolate. Who doesnt like that aroma? Tastes like chocolate and oats with a wonderfully hoppy bitter finish. Myself, I dont detect the citrus aroma of the cascade hops that I know (from reading the label) are in there. Bitterness - yes ; citrus  no. Mouthfeel is thin and clean with enough carbonation to be refreshing. Overall a great beer, if you havent tried yet and intend to, you are in for a treat."
"D - Good beer, good flavor, best chocolate stout second only to Brooklyn's black chocolate stout."
"I had this in a bottle as well as on tap. Either way you cant go wrong, but if you can find this on tap anywhere, that is the preferred way to go. Just an awesome beer and one I can drink over and over again."
"Pours a complete black with brown particles and 1 1/2 finger light brown head. Smell is woody slight smokey with chocolate bitterness and hop infusion. Very complex smell. Taste has a slight smooth chocolate taste with a very nice hop bitterness that compliments it very well. Mouth feel is a little thin, but thicker than a porter, so it passes with a 4.5. Drinkability is definately a 5. I could and will definately seek this chocolate stout again. A definate ace in my book."
"D: very drinkable. Too bad I split the bomber with my wife, I could have another."
"Good chocolate stout, but still artificial and disappointing to me."
"Poured from bomber into chalice and as soon as I opened it I could smell the chocolate. This is a black beer with a thick, mocha colored head, good retention and some lacing. Smell is of chocolate as expected but I was suprised to get a whiff of hops too. The hops are more pronounced when the beer is colder, as it warms the chocolate becomes dominant. Taste is of chocolate as well but a nice, rich, creamy chocolate, almost like a syrup. Some toasted grains and a tiny bit of hops (again, while its colder). Low carbonation and a thick, creamy mouthfeel. A pleasant, somewhat oily chocolate aftertaste left behind. Lower ABV makes this pretty drinkable. Overall a great beer and the best example of chocolate in beer I have tasted yet. As I review this is has a solid spot in the top 100, while I dont know if it will climb much higher, I certainly dont see it falling off the list. A true classic."
"D: An excellent stout. Maybe not quite as good as the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, but a close second. Well done."
"I picked up this 22oz bottle from Garys Liquor in Oak Creek, WI."
"Another nice beer from Rogue, I liked this one better than Shakespeare and their other stouts, highly recommended, glad this one is widely available"
"I did not enjoy this beer. Purchased in bomber form, the beer poured nicely, but my hopes began to wane when I sniffed it. Too much chocolate. The chocolate nose reminded me of chocolate syrup for lattes, which is never as good as Hershey's syrup--which isn't very good. The taste was more offensive--like someone dumped a bunch of flavoring into what could have been a good beer. Well, someone did. Although I did not like the strength of the chocolate, it was the synthetic characteristic that I couldn't get past."
"D - I am not a huge chocolate fan but found this beer to be very tasty."
"Poured a bomber of this into a pint glass. Poured a thick, syrupy dark brown and left a khaki head of about an inch. Very nice looking stout. Smell is overwhelmingly chocolate, believe it or not. Very sweet smelling. Taste is a sensation of chocolates. I first noticed very sweet chocolate, like Hersey. Then it was more semi-sweet. There were also notes of very bitter chocolate, almost like coffee, like the taste of eating chocolate malt. Very complex. Very delicious. I could easily kick back and enjoy these all night."
"D: Took me well over an hour to finish this bomber, and it made me quite full! Both the price-tag and the novelty keep it from being a regular in my fridge, but its fun and definitely worth picking up in the future."
"The color is dark and thick, reminds me of Hershey's syrup and has a thin mocha colored head that stuck through all the whole glass. Can definitely smell a lot of fragrant chocolate, caramel, and almost the smell of milk. The taste is really creamy, milky, and actually a bit like an oatmeal stout at first. Then it fades away into a sweeter chocolate taste that slowly turns into the aftertaste of deep dark chocolate and coffee with a lot of the bitter cocoa taste. Not too much carbonation with the beer but I think that it fits the creamy smooth nature of the beer though pretty well. A really drinkable beer too because the taste is just great and you don't get tired of the chocolate taste at all since it is not a sickingly sweet chocolate taste."
"Thanks to biegaman and Hog Town Harry for making the trek to Buffalo today, I got to try this growler tonight. Pours very dark black, tan head one to two fingers with stayng power and great lacing. Smells of coffee, shaved dark chocolate, tiramisu. Taste is malted milk, more coffee, dark chocolate almonds, chocolate cheesecake ... very, very tasty. The mouthfeel is smooth, just enough richness to make it irresistable with a medium body. I found this had a mildly bitter finish with a lingering choco-nutty aftertaste, what a treat, thanks Jan."
"Pitch black with a light brown head with thin sticky lacing and a thin head that stays on top. All sweet chocolate smell. Real chocolatey taste that's sweet at first and almost bitter on the way down. Smooth feel. Wonderful beer. If you haven't tried this, have someone hit you and then go out and pick one up."
"Good example of it's kind"
"D: Splitting a 22oz bottle of this is perfect. Not too much of a good thing. Perfect desert beer. Had an 07 vertical with dinner (bufalo burgers) then this for desert and it was perfect."
"Drinkablility: I enjoyed this one. I could easily drink another. Certainly worth trying and comparing to other widely available craft brewed stouts. (4.5)"
"Pours very dark black topped with a mocha colored head. The aroma is filled with roasted malt, dark chocolate, and what smells like some lactose sweetness. There is a roasty blast up front but it fades quickly revealing very smooth dark chocolate and some sweetness. Very tasty and very smooth but perhaps a bit too sweet. The chocolate aftertaste last a while. It has a creamy full body and excellent drinkability."
"Just about black with a cocoa head that has some decent staying power. Lower carbonation and just a good stout appearance. Smell is of rich milk chocolate with the slightest hint of spicy hops. Taste is decent but a little too sweet for me. I do enjoy beers with chocolate taste but this one seems to go in the wrong direction for me. Mouthfeel is about medium and silky with a hop bite in the finish. Pretty easy to drink, just not much to it and definitely not on of my favorites when it comes to a Stout."
"Overall a very very nice beer. One of my highly rated for sure. I gave the taste a 5 since the chocolate flavor is some of the best additive flavor ive tasted in a beer."
"Bottle temperature when opened: ~ 60F. Slight hiss, no smoke. Poured into two 12oz American 'pint' glasses. There's a quick rise to a head of about 1 inch, which scales down to medium lace around the glass. Pitch black. Smells like sweet chocolates, and when inhaled a tick layer of hop aroma. The hops are there but not overpowering - well balanced behind the malt and chocolate.. my GF loved it, and she's not a fan of high hop beers. Sweet at first but leaves behind a slightly dry, coffee -with-hops like taste. Will get this again.."
"D: This is one of the finest chocolate stouts I have ever had, far and away. Tasty, and highly drinkable."
"This is very good. I really like how this is like a grown up hot cocoa. More beers need to be this good."
"I have to say that is one hell of a brew. It has a lot of complexity to it. Definitely not for the average joe."
"Drinkability- Surprisingly easy drinker. It could be a very dangerous beer. Addictive."
"Pours a dark brown that its almost black. A huge chocolate milk head that dies slow with spotty lacing. Nose is a chocolaty as I have ever smelled. Huge on chocolate and cocoa, roastyness comes through with a nice bitter hop finish but a chocolate linger. Silky smooth in the mouth and not thick like an impy. Drinkable but more than one of these treats would be much. Absolutly the best chocolate stout I have had."
"I tried this beer alone and mixed with two other Rogue Beers. Alone it was delicious, robust with chocolate taste, and had a tight finish. I was told by a bartender to try it combined with a Rogue Chipotle Ale to make a mole black and tan, which was phenominal. I ordered another Chocolate Stout later and combined it with a Rogue Hazelnut Ale which was like liquid truffles, it was awsome. I had alot of fun with this beer."
"Drinkability - Before I finished this review, I was 2/3 finished with the beer. It went down easy, and I would have 2-3 pints in one sitting if it were the case."
"Fine looking beverage. Pours out inky black, with some ruby hue. Thick mocha head. Smell is primarily powdered chocolate. Taste- more of the same. Has that sweet chocolate milk powder taste, as well some roastiness from the malts, and a touch of lactic sourness. Mouthfeel is good, as is the drinkability. The sweet powdered chocolate gets tiresom after awhile. enjoyable beer."
"Separately, on tap is better than in the bottle if you get the choice."
"D: Could have only one at a time as a dessert substitute or poured over vanilla ice cream as a dessert!"
"d) this is one of the best stouts I've had and on of the better rogue products I've had"
"D- This wasn't an enjoyable beer. The burnt coffee dominated every aspect of this beer and not in a pleasant way. Something a little more subtle is more to my liking."
"D: Its pretty low in ABV, so its not hard to drink that way, but the carbonation is pretty strong. Not a session beer, but you dont have to chew it either. I'd come back again."
"This is an excellent stout that captures all I have been looking for in a chocolate stout with complex flavors and oat creaminess. Delicious!"
"Poured into a goblet. Inky black, opaque appearance with a light coffee-colored head that dissipated quickly; subtle lacing clung to the side of the glass during the entire tasting. Smell presented with hints of espresso and malt. As soon as the beer touched the front of my tongue, flavors of dark chocolate and roasted/burnt coffee wafted through my sinuses; however, the smell was much more intense than the flavor. Mouthfeel was thin and watery with a little too much carbonation for this style. Drinkability was somewhat less than I expected due to the amount of carbonation and the burnt taste at the finish."
"D: Though I would have preferred a little heavier body, the light body of this beer makes this extremely drinkable, especially for the style. I won't have a problem at all putting down this whole thing in 10 minutes."
"Pours a rich black with large brown head. The aroma is the best thing about this beer. It is full of sweetness. The chocolate smells definately come through but also some coffe and maltiness. THe mouthfeel is big and rich. The taste is a bit to much bitterness without much balance. A good beer I am happy to drink when available but not the best."
"D: This beer goes down really nicely, and isn't as ""stout"" as its name might suggest."
"Pours a dark brown/black color, as expected, with a foamy tan head that settles fairly quickly. Smell is all chocolate. Not really able to detect anything else, but that's okay. I love chocolate! Taste is also as expected heavy on the chocolate flavor, almost like they added chocolate syrup or copious amounts of cocoa to the beer. The cocoa flavor is very nice, gives it a kind of bakers chocolate flavor, without any noticeable roasted coffee flavors. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, possibly due to the oats used in the recipe, possibly due in part to Rogue's proprietary yeast. Whatever the cause, it is quite enjoyable. Drinkability is extremely high, unless you are just against chocolate flavor. Try it with ice cream as a float. It's delicious. Also, i've had the chance to try it on nitro before this, and i must say i prefer it from the bottle. Easily my new favorite beer!"
"22 oz bomber, poured into a duvel chalice. Smells of chocolate, the almost black beer appearance and tan head are slightly thin but almost appropriate for the style. Head retention is decent and lacing is apparent. Smell is sweet of faint chocolate. Taste is pretty darn good, its semi sweet not too much chocolate with a nice hit of hops, but really solid balance. Not very complex, but right now i dont care as the balance of this beer to the style is solid. A joke that its ranked top 50 beers in the world, but there are a lot of beers that are very wrongly classified. Whats important is that this is a well done beer and nothing to be scoffed at. An excellent example of an American Stout, and one of my favorite commercial examples."
"Tastes of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and a good amount of hop bitterness. This is the most drinkable stout I have had to date."
"Tasting this one is very nice. Lots of chocolate hits the tongue with a roll of carbonation that imbeds the chocolate into your tongue until a wave of hops digs it out and dries your tongue out in the process. Great flavor, balance and well taste..."
"Poured an attractive black color with brown head that lingered. Aroma is chocolate, but also of Cascade hops. Flavor is very chocolatey, but the sweetness is balanced well by by the hops. This was very tasty. Nice lacing on glass. If you like chocolate, do yourself a favor and try this. If you dont like chocolate this might convert you."
"Chocolate."
"Nearly black with a chocolate-colored head. Smells of roasted malts with a hint of chocolate. Chocolate is present in the initial taste, then fades to a roasted malt and hazelnut. Long lingering aftertaste is slightly bitter, reminiscent of dark chocolate. Very smooth mouthfeel. Very nicely done."
"Excellent work...."
"Chocolate, hazelnut in the aftertaste. And a very long bitterness."
"An excellent example of an american stout, one of the better offerings from an excellent Oregon micro, highly recommend."
"A phenomenal beer for any time."
"Very nice, deep cocoa coloredbeer with a good sized, tan head on top. Moderate aroma-mix of roasted malt balanced against a slight chocolate tinge. Good malty flavor-the chocolate stands out just enough to be noticed. Decent amount of roasted and choclate malt flavor as well. Nice mouthfeel-somewhat drying and ever so slightly astringent. A very enjoyable beer. Much more drinkable then some of the other flavored beers out there."
"An oversight, me never getting around to reviewing this beer. It pours a jet-black color with a big, smooth, and creamy head of foam. Nose is excellent, full of notes of dark, semibitter chocolate, lightly roasted, rich and appetizing... this is how my ideal hot chocolate smells on a cold wintry night. Taste is superbly chocolatey, though bordering on the too-sweet, balanced by moderately low hoppiness and a medium malt roast. Bittersweet finish."
"I prefer to have a balance of flavors in my beers. While a very good, and well crafted stout, I could barely perceive chocolate flavors and aromas."
"Drinkability: Although this is good it has a thick taste to it enspite of the feel you get while drinking it. May be a bit hard to finish off more than 1 of these"
"Pours inky black with a brown head. Smells of milk chocolate and chocolate milk. Slight lime citrus aroma. Strong milk chocolate and chocolate milk flavors. Just yummy. Hops impart a slight citrus acidity. Body is very smooth and thick. Oats evident in the mouthfeel. Not creamy but smooth and full. What an amazing sipper. Coffee tones build to add to an astringent finish. Milk chocolate flavors and aromas dominate to make a wonderful beer. Can't wait to purchase more and pair with chocolate and vanilla desserts."
"with a more complex and fuller body. Recommended!"
"For all that is there the beer is surprisingly thin. I'd like to see a bit more, but only if the sweetness is kept restrained. Caronation is medium and works well with the thinner body. Drinkability is limited only by my enjoyment of the style; I imagine some women I've known would guzzle this stuff."
"Pour was decent with minimal head and very little lacing. Color was dark, not black, more dark brown. Smell was wonderful, chocolate malts that almost smelled smoked come to mind. Taste was also great with a strong emphasis on blending the chocolate and beer taste to its best potiental. I could definatly drink one of these on a hot day or even as a desert after diner."
"Pours a deep, dark brown, nearly black in color with a finger and a half of dark tan head that leaves lots of sticky lacing. Wonderful aroma. The smell is dominated by a wonderful chocolate, some bitterness, a nice malty sweetness and hints of hops. Taste is wonderful and incredibly complex. Wonderful chocolatey and roasted notes dominate. At first you are hit with a chocolate flavor and some associated bitterness that melds with oats, roasted barley and chocolate malts. The chocolate flavor dissipates slightly and lets malts and roasted barley take control until the finish. In the finish the chocolate flavor comes back with a vengeance and remains long after the beer is gone. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nice, medium-ish body with carbonation that is just shy of moderate. Drinkability is great. The amazingly complex taste and wonderful aroma make this a pleasure to drink. If you haven't had this be sure to give it a try."
" I was in the mood for a nice big stout (and I'm rewarded with it also having a low abv), and this surly delivered. A satisfying beverage that comes highly recommended. Way too easy to drink."
"Drinkability- IMO opinion this beer would be best enjoyed with some kind of non-chocolate dessert or after a big ol hop bomb. Its super delicious and the only thing that stops me from giving it a five is the fact that the sweetness lingers in the mouth for quite some time. The 22oz bomber is almost too much for one sitting but youll definitely enjoy it. Yet another super high quality beer from Rogue."
"D - This was a wonderful brew. I would personally caution that because of it's sweetness that one 22 oz bottle in a session should be plenty. This in my opinion could be served as a desert in itself. I would keep some on hand for a relaxing night cap"
"Pours a deep black color with a nice brown head. The ingredient list seems similar to Shakespeare Stout. We'll see though. Aroma is very creamy with chocolate essence up front. Almost like a frothy milkshake-type of aroma. Taste is much of the same. Very creamy and chocolatey up front. The taste fades into a smooth, coffee-like aftertaste. Very nice beer that would go well with a chocolate dessert. It's not too overpowering and the creaminess really compliments it. Similar in scope to Shakespeare Stout but with more creaminess and some chocolate essence. Still very good! I'd go as far as to rate it slightly above the Shakespeare."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a shaker. This stout poured an opaque black with a huge, rocky, tan head that slowly faded away. Some creamy lacing was left around the glass. The aroma of this stout was made up of rich chocolate, light spicy hop notes, and some roasted malt. The flavor was dominated by the chocolate. Some excellent roastiness also arrived towards the end, then finished with a mild lasting bitterness. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. A very nice stout. Highly recommended for chocolate lovers."
"Slick smooth mouth feel- not chewy. A lot lighter than I would have thought for a stout. Malts predominate along with a mild chocolate, which could have been more pronounced. Moderate carbonation. Slight bitterness of hops emerges more as the brew warms."
"I had previously stayed away from chocolate stouts. Not sure why. The color was very dark black with a nice thick head. Smell is chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate. Taste is creamy chocolate with just a hint of bitterness and alcohol. Mouthfeeel was almost slightly grainy. This might have been a function of the tasting environment. I can't wait to try this with a nice slice of plain cheesecake. Will pick up a bottle to have the next time cheesecake is on the menu."
"A great brew that stands up to its moniker and reputation."
"Despite its overall lack of complexity, this was an outstanding beer. I sampled it both on-tap and in a bottle and I found the tap version to be richer, smoother, more chocolatey and, overall, far superior. It could pair perfectly with a variety of chocolate desserts but I would recommend savoring it on its own."
"Drinkability- This beer is fantastic! It would be awesome to drink in the winter time. I think when my wife is drinking hot cocoa I'll be drinking this!"
"Drinkability: Highly recommended. 22 oz bomber was quaffed readily without any ill-effects. PROST!"
"Hands down, one of the best stouts I've ever tasted. The chocolate is present and powerful, but not overly so."
"this is a very good beer, but i like the shakespeare stout better, this one is a little bit too chocolatley for me."
"Perfect Recipe with any left over (if thats possible): Reduce in a pan by 3/4's. Add 1-2 tbsp of sugar (brown or white). Add 2 cups fresh cherries. Cook for 10-15 minutes until sauce picks up a pinkisk cherry hue. Serve over good vanilla ice cream. I made this the other day and my wife and friends loved it. They couldn't believe how strong the chocolate from the beer became."
"This fine beer deserves its reputation as a great chocolate stout."
"D- This beer is excellent but i couldnt see drinking more than a bomber. Good desert beer to sip on."
"I like sweet stouts and this one fits the bill. More of a special occasion beer than a session beer like Young's Chocolate Stout but quite tasty. Recommended."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass; beer is fairly viscous, almost black in appearance with a thick, creamy looking head. Smell is mostly of the chocolate malt, but there is a slight hint of the cascade. The initial taste is quite hoppy, but it is also quite chocolaty and malty which results in a well balanced beer. There is a slight chocolate-hop residual taste. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a full, creamy carbonation. Overall, this is a drinkable and desirable beer."
"Overall, a very tasty stout. Chocolate and roastiness make for a nice brunch beer or a tasty dessert. Highly recommended."
"D-This is superb. I had a few of these tonight and paired one with Ciao Bello's Lebanese Yogurt Gelato to form one hell of an oce cream float. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys this beer. vanilla or coffee would do well to but the slighhtly tart yogurt really went well with this."
"Very drinkable, but in moderation. Sweetness of the chocolate does not make this a session beer, but it is good as a nightcap or dessert beer - mix it with a fruit-beer or lambic for a sweet treat."
"I will most definitely enjoy this beer again and again."
"Overall its another good beer by Rogue. I love how they have brought the chocolate into the foreground in this brew while muting the coffee. The coffee is there, but the chocolate is the real star here. This would be a good beer to lay on someone who is wanting to come over to the dark side. It is not too overpowering, and has they nice warming chocolatelyness that will win their heart over. It's a winner in my book!"
"Drank this from a 22 oz bomber, poured into a tulip glass. Pours a thick, opaque black - no light getting through. Big, reddish-brown head. Great retention - lots of lacing. Smell is dominated by a sweet, dark chocolate. Hints of toasted grain, too. Tastes of the chocolate, too. Little bit of bitterness, like dark chocolate or roasted coffee. Good balance between the sweet and bitter of the tastes. Medium mouthfeel - perfect for this type of stout, although I wouldn't mind it being thicker. Overall, a wonderfully drinkable stout. Nice use of the chocolate without being too one-dimensional. Another strong offering from Rogue."
"Very smooth beer overall. Very tasty beer."
"Beer poured a jet black color with a very healthy brown head. Nose is of sweet chocolate malts, Taste is of sweet chocolate malts blending nicely into a nicely hopped finish. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and goes down too easy. Drinkability is very good. This is one awesome beer that I will seek out in the future!"
"WOW....chocolate and coffee are very noticeable in this dark treat. Poured into a pint glass from a 22 oz. bottle and right off the bat, and nice 1 inch head that only every dissipated to 1/3"". This beer is heavy, dark, and filling!! Everything you would expect from a chocolate stout!! I loved this beer, and will definitely be drinking it again! Almost like drinking a sweet dessert!"
"Indeed a masterpiece; great dessert beer with chocolates or on its own."
"From bomber to becker at cold temp. Color is opaque black with light brown head, quite a bit actually. Transmitted color is deep ruby. Decent amount of lacing. Sweet chocolate aroma is very pleasing. Medium to thick mouthfeel leaving a slick, tacky coated palate. Tons of sediment. I love Dead Guy Ale, and this is another solid offering. Good amout of bittering balancing the sweet. Not really a sipper, but not something you'd want to slam either; drinkability is excellent. A little heavy on the belly, but it's a chocolate stout, so that's understandable. Great quality; nothing fake or cloying here. Definitely would try again! Not a lot going on with this, but still interesting. Could be considered a good baseline/benchmark for the style."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle, this beer was black with a tall brown frothy head with lacing that never quit. Ample smell of dark chocolate and sweetness. Taste was mildly smoky with lots of dark cacao chocolate with a little bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium with no special characteristics to note. Very drinkable beer even for a stout. I've had other chocolate stouts and the Rogue should be the benchmark to compare all others in my opinion."
"D- This is a very drinkable treat. Its not hard to drink the whole bomber in one sitting and that is enough for the time being too."
"I would drink this again. I had this with a buddy, and we quickly finished the bottle, and were disappointed when it was gone."
"D- one of the easiest drinking stouts out there. A perfect dessert beer that can be drunki often. Nothing out of whack, nothing out of control. Just balanced goodness and one of my favorites."
"D- A bit too sweet, chocolaty for my tastes."
"Very natural sort of chocolate flavor that runs throughout. This is an amazing stout, a one-off Shakespeare that does it right: no fake choco syrup or additives. Awesome brew."
"This beer was dark black as stouts usually are. The head was a light coffee color. The smell was just a hint of dark chocolate. The taste was also dark chocolate but not very strong. i was actually expecting a stronger flavor since flavoring was added. This beer was decent and probably one of the better Rogue beers I have had."
"The beer smelled of chocolate, but not in a sickly sweet or overpowering way. There was still that soft roasty note that stouts have. Chocolate is, of course, the main taste in the beer, but the roasty notes and just a bit of soft hops show through in the finish, which is crisp. The whole bomber went down nice and silky."
"Black pour with a short mocha brown head. Agood swirl brings it back up and releases the aroma. Intense bittersweet chocolate and malted milk. Smells really delicious. Interesting...The taste is not as overly sweet as the smell would lead you to believe. Reminds me of more of a milk chocolate than a bitter darker one. There are some welcome bitter notes on the finish though. Mouthfeel is good, very smooth. Carbonation does not make itself too noticeable. Very drinkable. The alcohol is low enough that it is a non issue. Delicious and filling beer. Very solid."
"The mouthfeel of this stout is very thick and syrupy while the balanced alcohol % is noticeable... Overall, a fine choice for an after-dinner beverage and high on my list of chocolate stouts."
"Great beer."
"Taste isn't as flavorful as the aroma'd suggest: some bready malt notes with chocolate and mocha coffee. A spritzy mouthfeel for a stout, a bit thin, but with good carbonation levels. It falls a bit flat after about ten minutes, but the taste gets better as it warms. A bitter, semi-sweet chocolate aftertaste finishes the flavor. Basically, the aroma on this beer hooked me. Everything else is good, like most Rogues. Definately one I'll be having again."
"Pours a dark black, with a tan two finger head that didn't stick around very long. Good color for the style. Smells of sweet chocolates with hints of vanilla and caramel. Very Very sweet smell. This smells really good cold, I will have to let this warm up a bit and then smell it too. I would have to rate this as one the best smelling ,for the style, that I have ever smelled. Doesn't seem to taste as sweet as I would have expected. Has a nice dark, very bitter chocolate fell through most of the drink, finishes with a burnt toast or kind of an oatmeal stout character, with just a hint of vanilla. This is a very full brew with minimal carbonation, perfect for the style. I may just add this to my regular drinking list. I should also note that if beers were rated on smellability this would rate a 5. I could smell this brew all day long."
"Thank you Rogue and thank you Sebbie for giving us this wonderful brew that I'll be going back to again and again. This brew proves that beer and chocolate are a combination that works together fantastically."
"Drinkability - Loved it, but not sure about drinking this one all night long."
"This is a drinkable brew, but certainly not an everyday sort of thing. It would be good in the winter, maybe for a holiday gathering. I'd have it again. I'll look for it around the holidays."
"I am not sure how to rate the drinkability. The taste stayed with me for quite a while. Not unpleasant. A drinkable chocolate bar and I like chocolate. It is just that I got satiated on this, it is not a beer that I can drink more that one of."
"I'm really impressed by this beer. Probably the best ""chocolate"" stout I've had. The tart fruity berry taste, the dramatic long finish, the way the hops sneak in at the very last moment... What a remarkable beer."
"D: Strange, but while I found this to be dry like a desert, I was won over by the immense chocolate and dark roasted/burnt malt flavors going on with this one. A challenging stout, indeed."
"D - Decent amount of chocolate in the aroma keeps you coming back. The Cocoa and bittersweet cocoa tastes are the primary flavor with a citric hop quality and a dry stout finish. It is a decent chocolate stout, but not the best chocolate ale overall."
"I love chocolate and stouts, but this one doesn't thrill me. I much prefer the Shakespeare Stout."
"On the upside though, it's hugely drinkable-- I drank a bomber of this stuff without blinking once."
"Overall: This beer was truely love at first taste, my favorite stout by far and one of, if not my favorite beer. Find it. Drink it. Enjoy"
"drinkability is good. well balanced. when cold i found the chocolate to be somewhat muted, with the more ashy and astringent character coming through. as it warms a little more sweetness shows and the ashyness mellows."
"Poured into a pint glass. Wow, this is one dark beer - pitch black with a sturdy and creamy tan head that leaves a good amount of lacing once gone. The smell is dominated by (what else) chocolate, but it is a sweet, milk chocolate smell with hints of vanilla. This smells better than some chocolate baked goods I've smelled. The taste follows suit - big dark chocolate flavor with a nice roasted oat finish, absolutely delicious. There is a some carbonation here, which I think could be toned down a little bit. This beer could use a bit more creaminess. I returned from Easter brunch a poured this for dessert & boy, I wish I had a couple more. This is one helluva beer - excellent stuff. Highest recommendation."
"I hate to sound like a broken record, but the chocolate taste is just too bitter and overbearing. I'm suspicious of the ""flavoring", but happy that they printed it so I could think about it in the first place. Points for honesty. I won't have another of these for a very long time if I can help it. I would much rather have a Young's Double Choc. Stout (in the bottle, not can). They probably use flavoring, too, but I feel it is done much better."
"Easily in my top 3 favorite beers of all time. Highly recommended to anyone."
"Enjoy."
"D: Can you really eat too much chocolate? nah.."
"22 oz bottle into a mug. Pours beautiful. Insanely huge light brown head that takes about an hour and a half to disappear (I didn't wait). Frothy and billowy, great looking. Color is dead black, with just a hint of brown along the seams of the glass. Basically the best looking beer I've ever seen. Nose is almost all the way coffee, some alcohol hints, and a good amount of sweet chocolately mocha. Taste is intense, to say the least. Lots of roasted malt and coffee bitterness up front. Nice citrus comes in too, but not too much. Them comes the sweeter chocolate on the tip of the tongue. Ends with a nice mix of hoppy bitterness and malty sweet; doesn't overwhelm with bitterness like the Shakespeare. Feel is creamy and full-bodied, although with solid carbonation for such a heavy stout."
"I could drink this one until I am stuffed. An excellent brew. This is the best stout that I have had to date without a doubt."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer for such a big body. With the first pint it feels and tastes like drinking a slightly bitter coffee. The second pint, as it warms, the smell and taste shift more to the chocolate side of this brew. It's probably not something I will be drinking once a week but it makes for a very good desert beer on it's own or served with desert. A very interesting and intriguing beer. It grew on my as I drank it and at the end I liked it quite a bit."
"The mouthfeel was a little gritty, not very smooth. Maybe I was just upset because the taste was a bit boring and it brought the mouthfeel down as well? I can't really say I'm dying to try this again."
"This was a wonderful, luxurious experience. Can't say I've had a stout like this. I have certainly tasted similar qualities in other stouts, but never like this. I can definitely vouch for this Rogue offering as a cellaring candidate. If you have a chance, put one away for a year or so and taste for yourself."
"What a great stout, the first few are very drinkable, after that I start getting a tad full. It was a realy treat to find this on tap."
"As good as a chocolate stout is going to get. Not as thick as Youngs, but with a more authentic and more embedded chocolate taste. This is easily the most decadent beer I have drank and also among the most drinkable. This is Rogue's best."
"Pours a dark black, with browns and reds at the edges. Head is a dark cream color, not too thick, not too thin. Smell is very chocolatey, with some coffee and toffee. Dark and roasty all the way with this one. Taste is VERY good, tastes like a hearty stout mixed with chocolate syrup (then again, for all I know, that could be the case). Mouthfeel is thick, but not unpleasant. This one coats the mouth a bit, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The only downside to this beer for me is the drinkability. The richness of it is honestly a bit too much for me. Very good, but I would almost have to down this one as shots. If you have the constitution to overcome the sheer richness of it, and like chocolate stouts, I'd heartily recommend this one. If you're like me, and like something not quite so overpowering, I'd suggest splitting it with a friend. Delicious beer, just hard to drink."
"D - An amazing beer. It is like drinking a bar of great dark chocolate."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is a very light and smooth stout. At 6%, it's pretty drinkable. I could down a couple of bombers with ease. Overall, this is a damn good offering from Rogue. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability - this is excellent ale, and sessionable to boot. Also would go well for and/or with dessert."
"The beer wasn't as full in the bottle as it could have been, did that effect the appearance? Most people rate it a 4 to 4.5"
"I had this from a bottle at the Rogue Brewery in Newport, OR. It poured a deep dark brown-black color, not a large or foamy head. It had a mild aroma of chocolate and malt, but not overwhelming. The taste was surprisingly thin and watery for a stout, not full-bodied at all and the flavor of chocoalte wasn't very strong."
"I have been on the lookout for the perfect chocolate stout- here it is. So sexy creamy black on the pour, with sticky lacing and head. Aromas were slightly coffee like with some undertones of chocolate in the malt. The taste- pure essence of cocoa. Bittersweet chocolate to the max. The absence of cloying sweetness made this brew absolutely delicious. Some mild flowery sweetness, like honey is in the wings to round it out, and the thick body can take it. Goes down so easy- my tastebuds are in heaven."
"Drinkability - just okay, didn't get a second, which is unusual. Too cold, too bland."
"Overall, i really havent had other beers to compare this to that are really so similar. I think it uses the chocolate extemely well in this beer. It's loaded with flavor, and i see this being a great digestif beer, and if not that, a great beer to have on it's own and enjoy it's unique flavors."
"D- good but not great. For a sweeter stout, there are others I prefer."
"Finally got to try this fine Rogue. Poured deep black as night witha big creamy colored, and audibly fizzing head that quickly faded leaving behind a half and inch of thick bubbles that laste almost to the end. Deep thick brown lace dripped down the glass. Very full looking. Smell was off course dark german chocolate, roasted or smoked smells wafted through as well. Roasted coffee and chocolate mousse as it warmed delighted the senses. Rich, smells like a chocolate dessert, very strong. Tastes followed suit well. Strong roasted chocolate, soo much chocolate, incredible, tasted like smoked pudding, Very nice. Carbonation made it very lively, and a dry finish capped it off very well. This is a big dessert bear, easily the most filling beer I have ever tried. I actually felt bloated after this. No real alcohol at all detected in this, and at a low ABV I wouldn't expect one. Suge huge bold flavors in such a low ABV are a welcome treat and make this very drinkable. The smooth, creamy, full flavor and texture and overall chocolate overload make this the perfect night cap, very well done."
"Took the bottle from the fridge and poured it right into a clean glass. Completely black with a big brown head. Great head retention and lacing. Almost odorless, which was strange. May have been a hint of chocolate in the smell, or it could just be in my mind because of the name. Medium carbonation with a medium/full body. Seemed a little bland for a stout, but the little bit of flavor that was there was very nice. I could certainly taste the chocolate and roasted malts. Good balance of hops too. No taste of alcohol present. Overall, a slightly above average stout that's very drinkable. I'm still stumped by the lack of smell, though, which really brings the score down for this one."
"I had this from a 22oz bomber bottle. Poured an almost black liquor with a one finger off white head that dissipated almost immediately. The smell was reminicent of earthy and chocolatey tones. There is an initial bitterness that quickly turns to a smokey choclate flavor. It lingers in the mouth for a while. The mouthfeel is quite heavy. This is definitely not your watery yellow fizzy beer !"
"D- filling and delicious, desert brew, good brew, im not a huge fan of chocolate but i'd recommend this"
"D: I was truly looking forward to this one for some time now but it came up a little short. I definitely want to try it on tap to get a second opinion."
"Drinkability: A great brew, light, chocolatey and delicious. I feel this brew is lighter probably because I've had Russian Imperial and double stouts recently."
"A wonderful stout to have on a cold winter night."
"Overall, the low carbonation and full body made this a smooth, creamy brew. It's a pleasant experience, in small doses: after half a bomber, I was ready for something else."
"D- It seems like this could be a hard beer to get as right as Rogue did. The best part about this beer is how well balanced everything is. Went great with a big cheeseburger."
"Drinkability: This is one of the best beers I have ever had. The End. What more does there need to be said? Close to a perfect 5, IMO."
"Whoa, this is super drinkable. I could have these all night!"
"d - easily drinkable but after a couple of glasses it becomes almost too sweet. but it is a nice change of pace and my girlfriend really loves this one."
"This tasty treat poured a shade-and-a-half away from being jet-black with a sizeable, lightly tan head and a bit of retention. The head subsides but begins as exceptionally creamy. The smell is raisiny with very rich, dark chocolate moving to the front. Cocoa fills the nose. The taste is incredible, rich and smooth yet dark and a surprising (if you don't read the bottle) entrance of hops that get stronger on the finish. A bit smoky and a ton delicioius. Very creamy yet light in the mouth and perhaps the most drinkable stout I've had."
"D: Grandma's homemade brownies in a bottle. Extremely well balanced without being too sweet. This is the best chocolate flavored beer that I have tried."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a 20oz dimpled mug. Poured a dark opaque black with a thin head that was diminishing and left no lacing on the glass. The aroma was an almost indescribable abundance of chocolate with usual stout undertones of roasted barley and subtle coffee, all very overpowered by chocolate, however. The taste was great but just a tad on the bitter side as far as the chocolate was concerned. The mouthfeel was fully tolerable with decent carbonation. This is a great beer for a cold winter night."
"This would be an outstanding desert beer. It's really desert by itself, almost like a tootsie roll in a glass."
"Purchased at Sams 650ml. bottle chilled and poured into a nonic. Head has dissipated into two centimeter milk chocolate crème lingering on surface, with nice lacing. The body is oily black, opaque, seriously does look like an I.S. Smells of subtle light smoky chocolate character, which permeates the totality of this drink. The roasted barley and oaks (as listed on the bottle) manifests and aids nicely to form an earthy well-rounded complexity. The cascades at first were rather forward, but as this warms up they mellow out and the chocolate is allowed to come to the fore. Taste wise this beer is rich bitter chocolate and coffee. Has many flavor components of a sturdy RIS, but simply lacks the strength and thicker mouthfeel. I realize this is not what they were going for, but worth mentioning. The mouthfeel definitely has a literal chocolate residual feel ""made with imported chocolate"". This is very much a worth while stout. The complexity of an Imperial stout, but the strength and mouth feel of a standard stout. Totally worth a drink."
"App. - 4 , Smell - 4, Taste - 3.5, Mouthfeel - 4, Drinkability - 3.5"
"Unfortunately, this beer is quite difficult (at least in NJ) to track down -- damn!"
"The big frothy thick head doesn't go away very fast leaving a nice lacing behind. The color is black, so much so that light doesn't penetrate at all. The flavor is sooo chocolatey with a big coffee flavor behind it, it's awsome!! I love this flavor. The mouthfeel is a little harsh with carbonation at first, but I suppose that will mellow when the CO2 has run it's course. Overall, I will get more of this beautiful brew."
"Cheers"
"My girlfriend and I tried this beer last week and we loved it. I liked the aroma and taste of this stout. My girlfriend doesn't do beer all that much but she liked the Chocolate Stout. So much so that we took home a few bottles. It went well with some chicken we had. I really recommend it."
"Silky smooth, rich mouthfeel. Very nice to drink."
"Drinkability: In a world of so many Imperial this and double that, it is nice to find a full bodied and flavorful stout that only clocks in a 6% alcohol. This is a great drink and one that you can have a few of. Plenty of complexity, while still demonstrating the fine art of restraint."
"A very tasty after dinner treat"
"It's a dessert in it's own right, but I recently had the experience of tasting this with Ice cream in it, and while not for everyone, is freaking fantastic."
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber into my Imperial pint glass an almost opaque dark, dark brown with two fingers of dense, dark tan foam. Modest lacing left on the glass with each sip. Smells of sweet milk chocolate, hops and roasted malts. Tastes foremost of milk chocolate, cocoa powder, then bittersweet chocolate and coffee, followed by a nice hop bitterness. Smooth and creamy with mild to medium carbonation. This is a really good chocolate stout. One that I always like to keep on hand."
"Pours jet black with a perfect tan head that has great retention and leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is of sweet chocolate as one would expect but there is also a strong roasted malt aroma. Taste is slightly fruity up front quickly followed up with a big dose of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt, there is also a subtle hopiness in the back. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth and finishes pretty dry. Drinkability is great. I hadn't seen this beer on the shelf for a long time around here and when I did I jumped at the chance to pick this beer back up. Another great beer from Rogue."
"Overall/Drinkability - A damn fine American Stout. Well done Rogue. I look forward to trying Rogue's Shakespeare Stout next. Grab a bomber and enjoy. Cheers!"
"There is some small print on the bottle that brags of imported chocolate. I'm not sure if they should of bothered. I couldn't tell the difference since the chocolate wasn't a very strong component."
"Altogether this is a great brew, and is a dessert in itself."
"Warning: if you don't like chocolate don't even attempt to try this beer."
"D - This is a really good stout. The best ""chocolate stout"" I've ever had."
"Drinkability- It's a stout, and hence not easy drinking. Still, very interesting and very nice on a cold night or with a big juicy flavorful steak. Well worth a try."
"I poured this 22 oz. bottle into an imperial pint glass. The beer pours a deep, black nectar that leaves a milk chocolate head hanging off the rim of the glass. The aroma is nothing but choclolate, chocolate, chocolate! After the first sip, there is rich, chocolate lacing on the inside of the glass. After another sip, I can taste the rich imported chocolate, and then the roasted malts come in. The beer tends to finish a little sweeter than the initial sip. I recommend this brew as a great desert beer, or a great change of pace beer for the long term drinker. Cheers!"
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black with a big chocolate malt head. Decent lacing as well. The smell is of fine dark chocolate. A little sweet, a little winey, a little malty, and a little sour with that undefineable chocolate aroma as well. Taste is similar. Not hugely malty and sweet, but more subtle. Very nice chocolate flavor, pure and rich with high quality chocolate. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but quite smooth. Not the vreamiest stout out there, but a little tannic bitterness from the chocolate helps to not make it cloying either and heightens the drinkability. The good quality chocolate in this beer really makes a difference. Quite nice."
"sipping and dark thoughts in the dead of winter..."
"22oz bottle poured very dark black (unable to see my fingers through the glass) with a large brown head that left lots of sticky lacing all over the glass. Smells of chocolate are pretty dominating. Lots of biter sweet chocolate in the taste with an equal balance of Cascade hops. A very nice blend not to sweet and a nice bite to it. Mouth feel is very rich and creamy. This offering from Rogue is very easy to drink and one my favorite chocolate stouts."
"D: One would be plenty, but I could go for another."
"Another good dark brew from Rogue. I liked the mocha and now the chocolate. The only reason the chocolate scored lower was the thinness of the stout. I hear that west coast stouts are thinner. Either way, it is still good. Next stop on the Rogue train is the Shakespeare Stout."
"Pours a typical stout appearance - jet black with a thin-medium head that dissipates quickly and leaves some lacing. You can tell this isn't just chocolate malt. The bottle says that it's made from ""imported chocolate"" and you can really smell and taste the chocolate. The chocolate taste is very noticeable, afterwards a hint of caramel malt is detected. A medium-bodied stout with a great drinkability. This is a beer you let your friends try just so that they can taste the real chocolate."
"Pours a completely opaque black color, with a tenacious tan head that sticks to the side of the glass. Aromas of dry, almost dusty chocolate flavors -- it reminds me of baker's chocolate. There is a milky, creamy backing to the aroma -- maybe due to the oats? On the palate, some stout sourness first off, medium carbonation and some juicy acidity. The chocolate flavor is quite dry, not sweet, and the finish is a bit short. Overall, I was disappointed by this. The chocolate flavor was a bit flat, almost subdued, and there's not much else going on in this beer to make up for it. Mouthfeel is too thin, and the staying power of this beer is kind of lacking. What's a mellifluous term for ""enh""?"
"A tasty and drinkable stout. This is a good beer, but not great."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a jet black, with a nice full 1 inch dark tan head, that left light lacing on the glass. The aroma is of dark chocolate, with a slight burnt smell in the background. The taste is great! Dark chocolate and coffee, sweet, but not overdone. The mouthfeel is full, just the way a stout should be. This beer is high drinkable. Maybe not more than one or two in a session, but easily an enjoyable beer, and one worth beginning a session with."
"The only downside is that availability is poor in the Dallas area."
"One of the best stouts I've had to date. Rich, fulfilling, and complex. A wonderful winter/dessert beer. Fantastic."
"pours an opaque black that seems to have brown swirling throughout, with a tan head that is pretty large to begin with, and persists while drinking. smells like chocolate bars being melted to make hot chocolate. tastes like chocolate, dark chocolate, and that's almost it. a slight hop bitterness keeps things fresh tasting. nothing exactly balanced here, but that's clearly not the goal. where other chocolate stouts seek to add chocolate to the stout experience, this beer merely uses the stout as a chocolate delivery device. mouthfeel is amazing -- silky smooth and very thick. it might become too thick after more than one bottle, but for one serving, it's just about perfect. drinkability is impaired only by the chocolatey nature of the beer, and that it is so rich as a result."
"Probably wouldn't go to the well to often with this but slowly sipping two glasses is very enjoyable."
"Very good beer, but hard to compare when Shakespeare is there as well. Light tan head drops very thin. Giant chocolate in nose. Competely black through and through. It's like drinking a dark chocolate bar that there's so much chocolate in the nose and taste. One dimensional as a beer, but good and I could see where it could be a chocoholics favorite."
"Overall- A tasty chocolate beer. Must be in the mood for chocolate though!! Just 1 bomber will do."
"Very nice chocolate aroma, a beautiful dark black out of the bottle with a nice creamy head. Had a good chocolate taste and finished like bitter dark chocolate. Mouthfeel was good for the style, not much carbonation. I could probably drink this all day, every day. Great beer."
"This is one tasty, easy to drink chocolate. However, I had to take a point away for mouth feel because I thought it was a little thin. Other than that I highly recommend it."
"D - This trumps Young's. It's not something I'd drink often, but my girlfriend loves it. This beer gets me laid...'nuff said. :-)"
"Very dark brown, almost black, with a small, creamy, tan, slowly diminishing head. Smells of rich roasted malt with lots of chocolate. Some dark chocolate in there but its the good dose of milk chocolate thats most notable. Actually, yes, it smells a little like chocolate milk (in a good way) accompanied by light brown sugar and grainy bread. The taste follows suit with the chocolate presence taking center stage. Big and malty with being overbearing, some very light berry in there too. The finish is pleasantly bitter and dry, and improves as the beers warms. At first the body seems huge but it thins a bit toward the finish, making this beer big and satisfying while remaining easy-drinking. Its creamy-turning-dry texture and medium-low carbonation are also nice. Not a bad beer overall. Interesting and definitely worth trying, but not one of my favorite Rogue beers."
"A superb brew by Rogue. This thing is loaded with chocolate. The 22oz makes it its own desert, or if you like, its own meal. I highly recommend this one."
"Really very tasty. Nice take on an American stout. But I think I'll try out some of the other Rogue beers before going back to this one."
"I can see me drinking this once in a while, but probably not on a too regular basis."
"D: This is an extremely drinkable stout. Ive always liked Youngs Double-Chocolate, but this one blows it out of the water. This is how a chocolate stout should taste. Simple, chocolate, and an appropriate, modest, stout mouthfeel. This beer is really a delight."
"Drinkability: For the style, this is drinkable to the extreme. I can easily have a few pints of this in one sitting."
"Pours an opaque black with a nice two finger caramel-colored head that dissipates slowly. Chocolate is evident in the smell, as it is in the taste. Just a fantastic experience. Creamy, smooth taste and the feel is lighter than one might expect, not dense by any stretch of the imagination. Totally drinkable and enjoyable."
"D: Due to the sharper coffee notes, I might be inclined to keep it limited. Still, good for another, especially suited for dessert."
"D: A fine porter, balanced well, though a tad on the bitter side. It's got 'chocolate' without being overbearing. A very nice pint to enjoy alone or with dessert. The Rogue Chocolate Stout Float is a dessert drink I have yet to try, but plan to do so in the near future (they serve them at Rogue and at Pix - supposedly 'invented' by local beer writer Fred Eckhardt, I think...)."
"I was anxious to try this beer, but it wasnt quite what I expected. Maybe an A- (rather than the expected A). Very dark, inc. a dark tan head. Less chocolate & more vanilla than I expected. Good mouthful, really good taste. Rogue Chocolate is probably one of my top 5-10 stouts. Id also recommend trying Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout and especially Youngs Double Chocolate Stout."
"The mouth is mellow and creamy on the front, and the dryness of the malt and coco, followed by the assertion of hops, results in a delightfully bittersweet finish. A truly enjoyable stout."
"A wonderful chocolate stout. I'm never surprised at the quality brews that Rogue brews. This stout is not disgustingly chocolatey, but right on the money. It has a nice mix of bitterness and buttery sweetness, set on a rich roasted malt canvas. Highly recommended."
" The tap version looked just as good but the chocolate and sweetness were far more prominent than in the bottled version-- to the point of being a little overwhelming and seriously detracting from drinkability."
"This beer poured a thick oily looking liquid with a nice cream colored head. The smell is sweet like a mild chocolate. The taste is heavy and sweet. The hops are noticeable without being overbearing. The chocolate definitely comes through. The mouthfeel is heavy and chewy. I love this beer, but dont think that it is something you can have several of in one sitting."
"Other: An OUTSTANDING beer. Unlike some other stouts out there, this beer truly tastes of chocolate and has a rich, full flavor."
"Overall, quite impressive. Very drinkable and very pleasant. Sort of like liquid chocolate. Would probably be great in a stout float."
"In the end Rogue makes a wonderful chocolate stout. It's one of the better ones currently on the market. Cheers!"
"This beer is chocalety like no other chocolate stout I've had. Actually uses choclate flavoring, so no great surprise. It pours quite dark with a tawny foam. Big foam, initially, as in ""my cup runneth over"" but it calmed down. Perhaps the oats are giving it foam? In the smell and taste department, well, did I mention chocolate? That really is the reason to drink this one -- it's easy to forget it is beer -- the hops and malt take a back seat. Sweet, but not cloying. In the mouthfeel department, it sort of dries my mouth out after each swallow, leaving a powdery feel. I find it interesting but not really one that I would try regularly."
"Poured from a 22oz silkscreened bottle and split with a friend. Appearance is black with no chance of light penetrating the beer. Thick tan head that maintains itself until the beer is gone. Smell is dark roasted malt with a load of dark chocolate. Some coffee hints as well. Taste is heavenly. Evenly balanced dark malts with bitter chocolate combine to form a nearly perfect beer. Coffee and blackened malt hints creep in as well. Mouthfeel is thick but very palateable. Drinkability is also way up there, I could have glass after glass of this. Overall, one of the best beers that I have ever had."
"D: This is fantastic. The bitterness and burned quality make it abundantly clear that you're not drinking chocolate milk. This is a terrific dessert beer. This is, believe it or not, my first beer from Rogue. I've got a few more bombers in my beer cabinet, and I'm now really looking forward to them. A wonderful introduction to the brewery. I'm hooked."
"Served from a bomber. Pours a pure black with no light passing through. Got a lot of head out of a normal pour. Kind of surprised by that. Really liked the dark, rich look of the beer. Definitely has a liquid, dark chocolate look to it. One person commented that it looked like hot chocolate. Smell is pure chocolate. Taste is alcoholic chocolate milk. Picked it because we were having smores and it was a hit. Mouthfeel was rich and oily, in a good way. Really was just like a liquified chocolate bar. Drinkability is lower because it is really sweet and rich. Split the bomber between four people and it was a good amount. Could definitely replace dessert after a meal."
"As far as recommending this... come on, does Rogue even MAKE an unimpressive brew? This is one of my favorite stouts. Buy it NOW."
"Overall, this is a very good chocolate stout, with stronger emphasis on the chocolate than other versions (such as Brooklyn's or Young's). Another tasty brew from Rogue."
"Taste; as with the smell the chocolate is the dominant flavor, which isn't surprising since this is a chocolate stout. A touch of coffee bitterness is oresent, as well as a little bit of a smokey quality. this isn't to complex in the flaovr department, but it is still very good. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, and fits the flavor profile almost prefectly. The only thing that limits the drinkability is the heaviness of the beer."
"Overall: I was afraid this beer would be too sweet, with very dominant chocolate flavors, but the roasted bitterness is high with the sweet chocolate providing a nice balance."
"D - Drinkable. Another great brew from Rogue, highly recommend."
"Very dark velvety black beer with a dark tan, barely red in it, head. Pours out thick. Smells hoppy. More sweet and mild than a hop bomb. Nothing bad, just not too remarkable. The aftertaste is a lot like semisweet or bitter chocolate morsels. Up front it is a lot fruitier and hoppy. It would be nicer if the chocolate could come out more at the front. Thick and like a stout should be. I could drink this fine, and it's not a bad beer. Maybe it's just how I feel right now, but I would prefer a lot of beers to this one."
"When I first had Rogue Chocolate Stout, it made me realize there's beer out there to be explored."
"I work at Total Wine, Beer, Spirits and More in Fort Myers. Our beer section is considered ""the home spot."" When I started there is February of this year I noticed a full case (24 loose bottles) were on a shelf under the title ""Great Brews."" I figured we had just gotten it in. Months and months went past and not a single bottle was sold but still I thought nothing of it. Finally in late August I decided to make a move and buy the first bottle off the shelf. It turned out to be an outstanding, rich chocolate stout. I first took a few sips directly from the bottle and took in the aroma. I then poured the rest into a glass and noted any taste or smell change once it got a chance to breath. It had a slightly flat taste, probably from sitting on the shelf for so long. It was a dark cocao brown. Strong bittersweet chocolate flavor filled my mouth which reminded me of biting into a Hershey bar. I'd have it for dessert anytime."
"This is one of the darkest, thickest stouts Ive had to date. This pours to an opaque, used-motor oil black, with a thick, dark tan head. The real secret to enjoying htis beer, as with many stouts, is to let it warm some. In my anticipation to try, I first smelled and tasted it right out of the refrigerator...nothing special. I then waited 20 minutes, and what a difference. Great aroma of chocolate and toffee, smelled like fresh made Turtle candy. Taste was more of the malty chocolate, but finely balanced by enough hops to not be too sweet. From the looks and smell of this thick bodied beer, I was worried about a syrupy sweet, but instead was long, smooth and just right. A very good beer."
"I am reviewing this about 3/4 of the way through this bomber. I've been working on it for around an hour just enjoying it. The (heavenly) smell and flavor have maintained throughout. You're only going to want one of these, but you'll want all of it. Not sure about dessert but this is a great nightcap and I'll happily come back to it."
"the flavor is rich, malty, chocolateness, swimming with roasted barley and some hop spice. little sweet, but a damn great beer."
"All I have to say is wow! This stuff is as good as everyone says! Pours a deep brown almost black. Thick tan heads that sticks around for a little while. When smelling it fresh out of the bottle you definately smell the malt and subtle hints of dark chocolate. The taste it just wonderful. To me very balanced. The malt is the first thing I notice, just a small hint of alcohol then the subtle chocolate flavor. The chocolate aftertaste is nice and not overwhelming at all. The mouthfeel is not nearly as heavy as you would expect it to be by looking at it. Very good drinkability but not something that you pound 4 of unless your a gorilla or something. I usually take a while to drink my stout but as I got to the bottom of the bottle and it warmed a little the alcohol taste kind of started to take over and there was less of a chocolate taste at that point. But I pretty much enjoyed the whole bottle so no real big complaints. I think it would go great with a nice chocolate desert or it can be desert just by itself! I highly recommend this one if your a fan of stouts!"
"T-Some sweet chocolate taste then leads to some bittering."
"Well i was a little worried this was going to just taste like sam adams choclate boch but let me tell ya the taste was completely different---in a good way. Made from real chocolate you can really taste it. Almost a hot chocolate taste and mouthfeel, except it was cold and and alcohol, can you say mmm mmm good!!!"
"if you're a fan of young's double chocolate this is a must have"
"First off.. the aroma of this beer is heavenly. Dark chocolate with macadamia nuts and pieces of orange zest come to mind. My friend who doesnt really dig beer at all loved the smell of this one. The appearance was very nice with fluffy head and hardly any lacing. The taste was great.. chocolate as expected with a little bitterness. This beer is basically a dessert in a bottle. Not sure if I'd drink this all night, but after a three course meal this would be perfect."
"Pours opaque black with a medium/small tan head that dissipates quickly. Smells strongly just like milk chocolate with a bit of roasted malt - very unique and nice. Roasted malt flavor with a lot of chocolate, obvious and pleasant but not overpowering. Some hops are noticable in the finish and the beer finishes with a lingering roasted malt bitterness. Surprisingly this is pretty balanced. Mouthfeel is excellent- thick and creamy. Delicious but the heaviness and chocolate flavor do take a bit away from the drinkability of this brew. Awesome overall."
"Certainly the best chocolate stout I've had. Cheers!"
"Overall, I love this beer from start to finish. The only bad thing was when the beer was gone."
"Drinkability is just not up to standard. Next time pour me something else. MK"
"Still - this is a GREAT beer. By far the best chocolate brew I've had, and the price is cheaper than most of the others, too."
"Drinkability: This would be a great dessert, but it worked well as a mid-afternoon snack too. Dry finish helps drinkability a lot."
"I went back to the bottle to look for a freshness date but none was to be found. I have to wonder if this is either stale or light damaged. I honestly could not finish the entire bottle, as it simply was not appealing to me in the least. I'm going to try a another bottle from a different state and re-review if there is a significant difference. Otherwise, I'm very unimpressed by this beer."
"A great starter AND a great finisherall qualities I love in a beer. Enjoy alone, or with a nice after dinner, light to medium bodied cigar. Goes incredibly well with NY cheesecake as well. Im sure a truffle now and then wouldnt hurt either..Enjoy."
"Recommended."
"The beer pours very, very dark brown with about an inch tan head. By far the primary aroma is chocolate, but I can smell some roasted malt and a bit of coffee too. At first the chocolate sweetness takes over, and then finishes bitter. There's just a slight bitter aftertaste at first, but the longer I drink the beer, the stronger the aftertaste gets. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. It's full bodied and it's pretty drinkable. I don't think it's quite as good as Young's Double Chocolate Stout, but the Rogue Chocolate Stout is still a pretty good beer."
"Thick and rich, chewy. Must be a bazillion calories in it! A very nice sipper, indeed. This is one to get again and share with friends."
"D: The ale is very drinkable with a decent hop flavor that underscores a decadent chocolate taste."
"A very impressive offering from Rogue, and one that I definitely recommend."
"Poured bomber into a wheat glass, pours a jet black in color with a 2 inch foamy frothy carmel colored head, very impressive looking that leaves serious lacing on glass. Smell is of bitter sweet chocolate with hints of coffee thrown in there. Taste is just what I would expect, a chocolate coffee with a bit of bitterness thrown in, great after taste of strong espresso as well, very tasty and balanced. This is another fine drink from Rogue, I highly recommend this to any chocolate beer lover out there, two thumbs way up on this fine stout."
"Overall a pretty nicely balanced stout with that bit of extra malty sweetness from the chocolate, definitely a pleasent experience."
"Silky looking caramel head, about an inch high, covering a tenacious looking black beer. Smell is of chocolate malt, and a little roasted malt? Perhaps. Taste is almost abundantly chocolate, although the hops do come through, albeit just enough to offset the sweet maltiness. Chocolate is strong, but not tedious, yet more than enough to please the chocoholic beer lover in me. Mouthfeel is a luxurious smooth, satin delight. Almost a romantic affair. Truly a sensual stout. Drinkability is slightly better than average, as I could maybe have a couple of these, but would need something to cut through the sweetness at some point. A delicious beer, but I wouldn't want to overdo it."
"Drinkability is determined if you love chocolate or not. I do and I could have this over and over. For a cheap looking bottle, this was a suprise of a drink. Chocolate lovers, get your fix here."
"No problem drinking a few of these."
"I don't know why anyone would pay $15 for a crock of Impy Stout when Chocolate Stout and Shakespere Stout are available for 1/4 of the price. Cheers!"
"Awesomely full mouth. Creamy. An excellent after dinner drink. I highly reccomend."
"ps-the low appearance rating comes from the head's shortcomings. the head wasn't that impressive and i didn't get any lacing. i feel that anyone can make a brew a beautifully dark as this; it's the head that's more nuanced"
"This is a good stout. I had it before and didn't like it as much. I probably had it too cold the last time. I'm sure this would go very well with most rich desserts."
"This is everything I was expecting and more. It poured a very dark, rich brown and left a thick, soapy, caramel coloured head that seems to be hanging around for sometime. Laced the edges of the glass nicely. Smells like milk chocolate. I mean, it actually smells like a chocolate Easter bunny. Amazing. Taste is good and chocolatey, as well, but there is almost a spiciness present. Like a nutmeg-cinnamon-clove kind of spiciness. Bizarre. Very much enjoyable, but bizarre, nonetheless. Has a bit of bitterness on the finish, which is a bit dry, as well. Mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth in the mouth with little or no carbonation sting. This is a fabulous stout. I'm glad I took the time to try it out."
"Drinkability: Good for a long winter night."
"This one pours a black with a tan head that sticks around for awhile. You can pour this one so the head stays with you for the entire beer, I find that this gives a nice aroma to the glass. The smell is of pure chocolate, sweet and inviting. It is like melted chocolate in a glass. The taste is similar, very sweet, straight chocolate, even with the heavy chocolate taste this beer is balanced so you do not get sick of it by the last sip. The mouthfeel is great, smooth and rich. I always find that I could have a couple more after the first. Every time I have had this beer it has always impressed me. An excellent brew that everyone should check out. Enjoy!"
"This was a totally different kind of beer than Young's. The smell is of sweet powdery chocolate. The taste is of liquified sweet chocolate. IBU's register at 69 but this thing actually felt like maybe 10, this one is pretty mellow. This would be the beer I'd put a scoop of ice cream in if I ever wanted a beer float."
"Overall I enjoyed this stout quite a bit but I wouldn't break it out all the time. My first Rogue offering."
"This is a tremendous stout. I know some people aren't big on chocolate or coffee stouts, but to heck with them. This is great. I really like how the bittersweet chocolate adds another dimension to what seems like it would be a world-class stout underneath. Definitely an easy going sipping brew. Another classic by Rogue."
"A: Opaque ebony with a carmel colored resilient head, with nice persistent lacing S: Unsweet chocolate dominates anything else T: Chocolate malted oats with the slightest hint of very mild hops M: Liquid toffee D: Too bold for a session with anything more than a 22 oz bomber. I enjoyed the mocha porter at the Rogue alehouse in SF, and this,simply stated, is its tougher big brother."
"Overall, my impressions of this beer changed significantly over time. this beer doesn't impress me as much as it did many years ago. However, it is still a good beer that is fun to drink on occassion."
"Draft at Friscos. Served on Nitro as Rogue Nitro Stout. Black body with a small, tan head. Mostly lasting. The aroma is heavy with dark chocolates. The flavor is milk chocolate, bitter dark chocolates, some coffee. Medium body with a slightly bitter, tanic finish."
"Rich and full bodied, this beer is an incredible drinkable fantastic treat."
"Ranked the #4 American Stout when I tried it."
"Pours from the bottle to a pitch black color with a large head of tan/brown foam. Medium high level of carbonation, even for a stout. Aromas of rich dark chocolate, chocolate malts, heavily fermented grain and an earthy note are all present. Taste is very chocolatey - dark chocolate, chocolate malt, chocolate laced molassas, earth. Wow. Mouthfeel is dense and thick, with a noticeable amount of carbonation making it's way to the tongue. Drinkability is pretty good. I'd like this again, but not in the warmer months of the year."
"Very good beer, I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's worth buying this beer for the smell alone. Great for dessert. I'm not even a huge stout fan and I loved this beer. Highly recommended."
"Eighty-five degrees with high humidity was not the place for this beer. I will come back to it once we get some frost in the air."
"D - easy to drink. could easily have a few of these in one sitting."
"This stuff is so sweet, but I did drink a whole 22 oz. bottle without trouble. I'll probably pick up another one of these days."
"Luscious head is dark brown, like the foam on a chocolate milkshake. Body is jet black, like a basement with the lights off. Spidery lacing is left all the way down. The nose is like ripping the lid off a packet of instant hot chocolate. Very inviting. Taste is big bitter chocolate, roasty malt, and a bit of sweet/sour. Mouth is nice and even. All I can say is, if you want chocolate, this is your beer. Wonderful."
"If you like chocolate, you oughta love this stuff. If you don't, you... you're wierd. The pour is dark, dark brown with a fluffy tan head. Milk chocolate fills the nose like chocolate milk. Burnt and roasted malts join the chocolate in the taste to remind you that you're drinking a stout. If you let the beer sit on your tounge for a moment it becomes velvety smooth and soooo creamy. Another plus is that this is the only sweet stout I've had that doesn't become sickeningly rich by the end. This one's totally worth Rogue's high price."
"Pours a dark pitch black with a nice creamy 2 finger tan colored head. Aroma is sweet milk chocolate and a slight hop bitterness. Taste is creamy chocolate up front with notes of coffee and hops finishing up the taste. The bitterness from the hops may be a bit too strong for this particular brew but they do help clean the palate of the sweetness preparing you for the next sip. This brew from Rogue is an absolute first class beer. One of the best and a treat to drink."
"D: Mmm. Goes down easy and makes me want more."
"Overall Impression: A Great Stout for the Month of February, when your Sick of the Cold. HUGE Chocolate Flavor and Clean Fermented. This Beer is made with Imported Chocolate, I loved it! If You Like Stouts You Have to Try This one."
"Edit: Had to add this. Just made an ice cream float with this beer and some vanilla ice cream, and it is awesome!!!"
"D: Tremendous. For beer lovers and those that *claim* that they don't like beer. Delicious."
"i dont think i've tried a Rogue that i've disliked so far, but this was excellent. im dreaming of a trip to oregon."
"Very enjoyable beer all around. Though I prefer the Shakepeare Stout, I'll definitely go back to the Chocolate in the future."
"you get the idea..."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability? I liked it so much I had another. For a full-flavored stout, I found it quite drinkable, and the 6% ABV won't hit you as hard as, say, an Imperial Stout. But if youre not into chocolate-flavored beer, you may consider this to be a one and done dessert-type beer."
"Appears near pitch black with a fair tan head. Smells great, mainly and very strongly of dark chocolate. The taste is heavy with roasted grains and a distinct chocolate aftertaste. After a few drinks the chocolate aftertaste became less pronounced and was slightly more bitter, though I would not have described the first few sips as sweet. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy on the bubbles, and I would say it was a little too much for a stout, but there was some creaminess. Overall I did enjoy this beer a lot, but when I'm in the mood for a beer like this, I usually go for something a bit stronger and more complex."
"EDIT: Just read cwrw's review, and ""creamy lactose"" is an absolutely perfect phrase for this beer."
"Over-hopped from my perspective - a ""flaw"" in some Stone brews. I can't help but feel it would soar if toned down just a bit. Even after several tries, the unpleasant bitterness lingers to make the drinkability rating mediocre (I've enjoyed barleywines that didn't suffer from this limitation) Maybe it's just me and my sweet-longing palatal proclivity. Decent numbers all-around otherwise. I'll give this contender a few more go's at it before giving up. You never know."
"This is my first chance to try the Chocolate Stout from Rogue, and if reviews mean anything, this should be a fine stout indeed. 650ml bottle with the embossed Rogue label. What I love about the Rogue bottles is their listing of the actual hops and malts used in the beer--something I have yet to see on any bottle here in Canada. Nice to have the IBU and Plato listed as well. Big whiff of chocolate as soon as I popped the cap. This, like their Mocha Porter, is extremely dark and opaque with hints of dark blue near the edges. The head is large and mocha-coloured, with little dimples of deeper brown/near red. Good tight foam and full sheets of lacing that leave rings on the glass. A fantastic looking stout. The aroma is make-no-mistake chocolate. Nesquick, raisins, and cafe mocha. A syrupy aroma floats around too, akin to tree sap or maple. The hops are really hard to smell, because this is all about the dark cocoa man--in fact, whilst the aroma is appetising, it is uncomplex. Perhaps some hazelnut, a little toffee/caramel, light licorice. Brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate bars....etc. Anything chocolate really. To its credit it smells like fresh, real chocolate and not some stale extract. The beer warms a little and some creamy lactose comes into play as well, complementing the malts. A really lovely malty aroma all in all. Soft and sweet. Cocoa and mocha on the tongue at first, with soft hints of dusty chocolate on the middle and a fairly bitter finish where the hops add their oiliness and a little grassy citrus. The bitterness is actually quite high after a few sips. Tasty malts, with some oat fulness. Licorice, chocolate raisins, and very grainy and dusty malting in the aftertaste. Still, the flavour is not quite as full or as chocolate-filled as I expected. The body feels a little weak--perhaps less smooth than I should like for a chocolate stout. Lingering taste though, with a wonderful roasty dryness. This was very good, but not outstanding. Personally I don't see why it rates so high. A definite case of ""not-living-up-to-the-hype."""
"Would be best IMO on a colder day but it was there on the shelf and I wanted to give it a go, I was pleased."
"Pours with a thick, latte-colored head of mixed-size bubbles that slowly settles to a skim coat leaving a single line of lacing. Deep, dark black with mahogany highlights at the edges. The smell is thick and inviting, filled with roastiness and a sweet chocolate aroma similar to a warm brownie or Hershey's syrup. The taste is roasty bitterness up front that gives way to clear as a bell chocolate, slightly bittersweet bakers chocolate, but with a touch of milk chocolate sweetness. There is a creamy creaminess present as well. The roast chocolate notes linger in the mouth. Full bodied and also surprisingly light, with almost no carbonation, but this works. Perhaps not a session beer, this one is highly drinkable and is a wonderful accompaniment with rich desserts."
"I must say that this is the Rogue brew that I wanted to try the most. I can't say that it is a bad beer, but I am a little disappointed. I was hoping for something closer to Young's Double Chocolate Stout, as that is one of my personal favorites. A good stout, but the chocolate is drowned out by the strong stout qualities."
"Damn good beer. I love it. I need more"
" I have tried other chocolate stouts, to date none have been in the same league as this one by Rogue. Well done!"
"Overall: Wow, a kickass porter. I think Im in love."
"Dark black pour leaves tan crust of foam. Aroma is distinctively sweet and of chocolate cake. The taste is not as sweet perhaps, it has a bit of mocha flavor with a hint of smoke, and a moderately bitter finish that has a sour after taste. Mouthfeel is quite thick, with decent carbonation. Drinkabilty is good, not overly alcoholic, but the chocolate flavor seemed a bit contrived as they added flavoring. I would have expected a bit more sweetness to balance out the taste."
"Overall: Definately worth trying. The chocolate flavor is good, though it did come off a little one-dimensional. Nonetheless, highly drinkable."
"Notes: This one is aboslutely great a chocolate lovers dream beer foam lines the glass from begining to end a winner from Rogue. Cheers!"
"This is a chocolate lover's chocolate stout. It is a beautiful beer: black with a creamy, slightly brown head that just invited the lucky drinker to imbibe. The taste is sweet for a beer, with an overwhelming chocolate taste. It is almost like drinking dark chocolate, with a nice hop undertone playing with the semi-sweet roastiness of the malt. A little slow going down due to its body, this is a very nice offering from Rogue."
"Poured near black with a two inch mocha head. Smell is chocolate, chocolate, chocolate and even more chocolate. Oddly enough, taste is chocolate too...both sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel is thick and coating. Drinkability is pretty good."
"This is a rich malty sweet beauty with a creamy off white head and thick lacing. The color is completely opaque. The aromas of chocolate and mocha are completely apparent from the opening of the bottle, there are more subtle notes of toasty or roasted grain but not overpowering. I think Rogue has once again proven to me that they can brew whatever they want and succeed. I could drink this beer for dessert any day of the week."
"I really want to hate this beer because of who makes it, but I can't do that this is really a great beer. Creamy and tasty this is quite good, and somewhat expensive at $7 a bottle. If you are holding out on trying this just because of who makes it then stop and give it a chance. I would possibly question the Style classification, as this is most certainly a heavily spiced beer."
"Pours a thick ceamy head and then disapates quickly. This beer is heavily carbonated with a strong scent of chocolate and malt. Not as strong or smooth as I hoped considering Shakespear's taste. I even tried to pare with chocolate and found it very dissapointing. This beer had no substance to it and left me hanging! Hope next years batch is better!"
"This beer leaves a very tannic mouthfeel with a long choclate finish. Too choaclaty for my liking; making this a one beer and done for me."
"Smells faintly of chocolate, and pours a very dark brown with milky brownish head. Initial taste is a bit harsh, complex combination of quite bitter chocolate and hops. Following the beer is a great mouthfeel, something like chocolate cake. Perfect drink for after dinner with a desert, or as a desert."
"Note: the ratings I gave reflect what I think the beer deserves and I will review it again soon and adjust as I see fit, thanks. S.O."
"Overall - The word of mouth has been spreading, and with good reason. This beer kicks ass. It takes a backseat to no chocolate stout (I'm looking at you, Brooklyn - you have been matched). The 22 oz. size gives you plenty of time to savor all this beer has to offer. I'm glad I bought two instead of just one! Rogue, why must you be all the way on the west coast???"
"As much as I like this beer though I've opened two 22oz bottles on seperate occasions and couldnt finish either of them. Afterwhile it just gets to be too much for me."
"Pours quite dark-- just about opaque. Big dark tan head leaves nice tracings on the glass. It took me a while to begin drinking this beer because I was having so much fun just smelling it! Rich milk chocolate, faint pipe tobacco, all wrapped up in a general candy aroma-- smells like chocolate eggs with the hard candy shell... smells like Easter! More goodness on the palate: surprisingly airy and floral, followed by a candy sweetness, chocolate, tobacco, then a sturdy roasted bitterness in the finish. Whereas the aroma seems to be all milk chocolate, the flavor takes on more of a dark chocolate/cocoa profile, along with dark fruits as are often found in dark chocolate-- in this case, dark cherries, perhaps. Whereas this baby is loaded with flavor, the palate remains by and large unsmothered, and as such you may be tempted to gulp this brew right down. But don't-- there's too much complexity and too many rewards in here to rush through. Bravo Rogue."
"Poured a very deep brown color with massive tannish head. Left nice lacing on the side of the glass. Taste is loaded with toasted malt but the dark chocolate is also present in large quantities. Taste is sensational with the sweet choclate tastes combining with the roasted malt to form an astonishins delicious taste sensation. Finishes with a slight bitterness, but the sweetness of the chocolate overwelms it. An excellent, well-made beer."
"I recommend it and I will be definitely be having it again!"
"There is no reason not to have another. An excellent brew."
"The beer pours dark & rich, as you might expect. Little to no head to speak of. Decent aroma with the foreshadowing of chocolate syrup to follow. Decent but thin mouthfeel, with an abundance of chocolate overtones and a malty body. Everything about this is hinted with that chocolate syrup taste - overtones, body, nose, finish, aftertaste. You name it, it's there. After I finished the glass and licked my fingers, it tasted like chocolate."
"This could easily be a gateway beer for chocolate lovers. A truly wonderful stout that is just beautifully crafted and will consistently bring a smile to your face with each sip."
"This beer pours an opaque black with a thick tan head from a 22 ounce brown bottle. Malt and a hint of chocolate in the nose. Tastes like a dark chocolate bar. I like beers that have a hint of chocolate in them, this may be more than I prefer, but this is still a good beer by any measure."
"I like the concept of a chocolate stout, but I found it to be more of a super dark chocolate malt taste than candy bar sort of chocolate. It's good, but I just didn't think it was well balanced."
"D - Good drinkability. Very enjoyable as a nightcap. I think the prevailing word that sums up this beer is smooth."
"This is an exceptional Chocolate Stout. Pours jet-black with a thin, lacy head. Smell is just wondrous, very heavy dark chocolate. I was a little bit worried when I saw ""added chocolate flavoring"" on the label, but the smoothness of this brew is overwhelming. Very , very nice..."
"A very good beer, but almost a bit too intense on its own. Paired with a dessert, however...amazing. Recommended."
"drinkability - I myself rate this verry high, and if you are a fan of this genre, you proaly will too...but if not you may find it to ba a bit to sweet."
"Pours jet black and completely opaque, with a fairly dark brown head that dissipates reasonably slowly, and leaves a thick ring and good lacing. Smell is laced with thick, sweet chocolate, and has a slightly burnt overtone. The smell just gets stronger and sweeter as the beer warms, until it is like a freshly unwrapped chocolate bar. The taste is of dark, roasted malts with plenty of chocolate coming through. Again, the chocolate becomes more palpable as the beer warms up. Mouthfeel is a touch thin, but still has enough body to satisfy, and the drinkability is remarkable for a stout. This goes down easier than the macro lager I was given at a party last night. Nearly perfect, this is destined to be an all-time favourite."
"Very nice. Not something to drink more than one of, but would be great to go along with desert or as desert itself."
"Dark chocolatey brown with a nice finger of tightly-packed teddy bear brown head. Definite chocolate. More so than any other beer (even Youngs, in my opinion). Kind of dark chocolate, but also some baking chocolate and maybe some chocolate syrup. Roasted malt/coffee background. Nice. Lightly sweet chocolate. Gives way to drier baking chocolate/cocoa powder. Roasted barley gives a nice bitterness, before rich, chocolate mousse takes over the long finish. This is chocolate beer. Medium-bodied. Not syrupy; in fact, almost dry. Ample carbonation. Yum."
"this is an awesome dessert stout. Nice dark almost black color, thin chocolate head. smells and tastes of chocolate and coffee. creamy taste and mouth feel. nice smooth finish. Heavy enough that you are satisfied and settled after one...relaxing. One of my favorites."
"This is a chocolate lovers delight. Such nice, natural chocolate smells and tastes. Very drinkable! Not at all to thick or rich."
"Rogue's Chocolate Stout pours black as night with a one finger brown head in a pint glass...really no lacing...looks slick. smells like dry bittersweet cocoa. tastes more so. creamy, full bodied feel, dry in the finish. very well balanced and very drinkable...one of my favorite stouts. cheers to a delicious, natural chocolate beer!"
"Drinkability also ranks high, due to low alcohol and smooth, well blended flavors. If only the aroma had more closely resembled the flavor, this would have been a considerably better beer."
"Very sweet, chocolatey and drinkable."
"D - extremely tasty brew, get a bomber of this and try it. The only reason I knock off points for drinkability is because I think eventually I would get tired of the chocolate flavor and the alcohol content of this beer would prohibit extended drinking sessions."
"An interesting idea with this beer is to have it with some very bitter chocolate. I had it with a couple of pieces of 85% cocoa Lindt, and it was fantastic (if you're a fan of the bitter, which I am)."
"Impenetrable black with a massive creamed-coffee froth, smooth and undulating. Sweet cocoa aromas predominate -- but subtly -- over a roasted dark malt presence. There is an underlying and unexpected bitterness -- perceived most strongly in the finish and aftertaste -- that pervades the roasted coffee malt flavors and chocolate sweetness. I want to say this peculiar bitterness comes from the cocoa, but subsequent burps yield a distinct Cascade flavor. Amazing complexity of tastes acheived here. Silky smooth mouthfeel; medium to full body. Not something I'd go for very frequently, mainly because of the special chocolate flavor that is the main event of this beer, but nevertheless, an formidable and worthy accomplishment by the geniuses at Rogue."
"Drinkability: Truffly goodness make this a great special-occasion beer. Pair it with a raspberry torte and you're all set!"
"Pours a jet black color with a minimal, finely textured tan head. Aroma of chocolate cocoa with a light hoppiness. Very thick and creamy looking which follows onto the palate as well. Lush body coats the tongue with a pleasant, not overbearing chocolate flavor. Slight hints of toasted malt lend a smoky, burnt overtone to the flavor. Not overly sweet with a fairly dry finish. A very nice brew to relax and sip. I'd definitely buy this one again."
"...possibly a bad choice for my first Rogue but i'll still go for another at some point. i hear dead guy is great."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this stout. I do not have access to many chocolate stouts in my area but I think this Rogue is great. I will definately buy this one again and again and again. I will probably enjoy this after a meal since I like sweets after I eat. I can kill two birds with one stone. An after dinner beer and sweet desert."
"Definitely recommended, bad artwork aside."
"drinkability - good but after a while the sweet flavors get to be too much. would be great on tap in a single serving, or splitting the 220z with a friend. if u like chocolate stouts this is a must. everyone should try this one at least once."
"Overall, I love this beer and buy it every chance I get. Is it better on-tap or from the bottle? Hmm, gonna need some more experimentation to find out."
"Cheers to Rogue! This is a fabulous beer on-tap and out of the bottle... I have had both, but this review is for the tap. I'll get around to writing a bottle review when I drink it next time ;) I cant wait to try a black and tan made with Rogue Choc Stout and Rogue Juniper Pale Ale. I think it would be fab!"
"surprisingly bitter taste. malty sweet followed with a hoppy aftertaste of pine and citrus. chocolate in the taste is more bitter than sugary. a touch more sweetness in the flavor would make this one more balanced. the appearance and the aroma are top-notch, though."
"I had a pint of this while visiting Kclingers. THe beer comes in a pint glas and there is a thin creamy tan head floating on the surface. The color of the beer is drak brown with no lite passing through when held up. The aroma is rich and chocolatey, no surprise there. The chocolate is actually fairly sweet like cocoa powder of a hershey bar. First sip reveals a fairly thick body and very mild carbonation. Nice and smooth beer. Then the flavor, things go down a little here IMO. The beer is very sweet chocolate flavored like eating a candy bar over and over. By about mid pint it gets to be very cloying and not very enjoyable. Maybe with some fruit or vanilla ice cream but with a dinner it is just too much sweet chocolate. Of course if you really dig that this is for you. I am turned off by the overdose of chocolate and wish it was some more roasted notes or coffee to balance the sweetness."
"Very smooth and drinkable. A very nice cool weather beer, went well with a hearty beef stew and very nice after dinner. Very good stuff."
"My 100th Beer Review!"
"No disappointments from this beer. It defiantly lives up to its name. The pour looked great. Dark and rich with the head being a dark brown. The smell was great. It was like you had just taken a chocolate cake out of the oven. The chocolate was there but you could still get a whiff of the good stout flavor. It was very smooth, good flavor. Kind of reminds me of chocolate milk."
"DAbsolutely wonderful. The bittersweet chocolate flavors make this one great. Any more sweetness would ruin it. Outstanding! Couldnt drink more than this bottle, though. It is incredibly thick. A great dessert brew!"
"Beers like this keep Rogue at the top of the list of American breweries."
"Still though, this is a darned good stout!"
"Low carbonation, pleasant dark chocolate aftertaste. A wonderful pairing of the stout and the chocolate, with neither overpowering the other. One of the few beers here I feel is truly underrated."
"Insanely easy to drink, has been a favorite for many years. I'm glad I finally found a place to get it regularly."
"The taste can only be described one way, chocolate followed by a mild and nicely added bitterness that is a combination of malts and hops. There is a slight hint of biscuit and bread in there as well. Overall, a very pleasant beer to drink and very well made."
"Poured an opaque black with a thin brown head from a 22oz bomber, that fell quickly to light foamy off white lacing. Aroma is rich of many types of chocolate, mainly a bittersweet/bakers chocolate and some roasted malt also present. Smells very good, nice blend of sweet and bitter chocolate. Taste is powerful chocolate and malt, hints of hazelnut and berries, doesn't deliver as well as the aroma implies, but still very good. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied, moderate to heavy carbonation, maybe a little too carbonated. Drinkability good, pretty rich tasting brew, would be an excellent dessert pairing for complementing something sweet with the faint chocolate bitter aftertaste from this impressive beer. Would purchase again, my wife has some interest in this beer as well."
"D:Too intense for heavy drinking but great beer"
"Note: if you don't like the smell or taste of chocolate you most likely not enjoy this great brew."
"Taste was OK, but not as outstanding as the visual. Tasted a little light, not as chocolatey as expected. Kind of similar to Rogue mocha porter for me, in that I expected more based on the name and previous reviews."
"Rogue continues to impress me... definitely a beer to try."
"D: I'm not a big chocolate fan, but I do really like this beer. As always another very solid offering by Rogue. Not something that I could drink a lot of at once I don't think. Would be a good beer to have on a cold snowy night by the fire to help warm you up a little."
"This is an awesome stout. This is a tasty adult treat like chocolate milk was when I was a kid. I highly recommend it. Mmm...I want another."
"However, if you, like me, relish a good dark bar of chocolate (Lindt's 70% for example...) then watch out. This beer will be the death of both your waistline and your wallet. Don't say I didn't warn you."
"Very black with one of the darkest, most beautiful heads I have seen on a beer. Creamy with a few different shades of brown and tight lacing. The aroma is so alive! Chocolate bready malt in the front with raw leafy unroasted coffee beans backing it up - mouthwatering. Taste is largely lukecold coffee and cocoaish chocolate with a very strongly herbal lasting finish. Thin feel is not slick but smooth, almost casklike as it warms! Very very drinkable. One of the, if not the, best beer at this alcohol percentage. I slightly prefer the Shakespeare, but hell, why choose when you can have both. Wonderful."
"The roasting affect and bitter chocolate leave a nice lingering after taste."
"If you like chocolate this is the one for you. A nice one off for me."
"Drinkability:I could drink this for a night. Alcohol is not pumped up and it goes down so very easily."
"Desert in a bottle, this would be paired excellently with just about any desert on the planet. Frisco's plans on adding it to whipped cream, Frambroise reduction and vanilla ice cream. Yum."
"Notes: I heard a lot about this beer and while it was good, I was expecting a more pronounced chocolate than a bitter malt. If you like bitter stouts then please pick this up."
"This poured a very dark brown, almost black with a substantial cafe au lait head. It had a sweet, chocolate odor. The taste was a little off-putting. It was very sweet, almost too sweet for me, and had a pronounced chocolate taste, It felt very carbonated in my mouth, and wasn't as substantial as I expected."
"Pours pitch black, 1/2 inch of head beginning with and shrinks to thin head, and already with lacing down the glass, and has nice streaks and blobs of lacing all the way down. Smells of chocolate, dark and malty. Simply, lovely, though a bit too understated, which is about the only complaint I have for this beer. Taste is heavenly. Have I had a better chocolate stout? Perhaps, but this is up there. And as it warms, I only become more impressed. The great thing is, the chocolate taste doesn't overpower the beer taste, nor visa versa, that is, the chocalate and malts are balance each other almost perfectly. As far as mouthfeel goes, its interesting, because it gives you a little phiz in the beginning, is smooth through the middle, then gives you some tingle during the aftertaste with choclaty goodness to leave you wanting more. This might be the highest beer rating I've given, because this is one of the best beers I've ever had."
"D: Goes down smooth, tastes great, easy on the bankroll. Get some."
"rogue, please put this stuff in a 6pack."
"Pretty drinkable; No alcohol prescence, tasty and thick. A satisfying stout."
"Overall: Has a nice flavor profile-the chocolate is matched well against hop bitterness. To be honest I expected more of chocolate flavor; however, the complexity of the flavors and the hop bitterness made this a quality brew. Nice brew for the cold weather also."
"Pours an opaque black color with a small tan head. This might come as a shock, but this beer actually smells like real chocolate! If you blindfolded me and put the beer and a chocolate bar in front me, I would be hard-pressed to tell which one was which. The taste is great as well, but I did not receive the chocolate rush that I did from the aroma. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Slightly bitter from the use of hops brings the drinkabikity down a bit, but it's still great for a stout. This beer was a treat to have on tap and left me feeling very satisfied."
"As a chocolate lover, I find the chocolate component of this beer to be extremely well-executed; it is definately a major presence, but complements the other flavors without downing them out. The hop level is similarly well-done--contributing to aroma and flavor, without throwing things out of balance. Overall, this a complex and well-crafted stout, suitable for dessert or simply good drinking."
" Overall, this beer is delicious, smells amazing, and is very well made but seems to fall just short of true stout greatness for me. Still, definitely worth a $3.99 flier every once in a while in the winter."
"Do you like chocolate? If so, this is a great beer. It does not have the usual overdone flavors, just a wonderfully balanced brew. If you're expecting a dry stout, this will be quite distracting. Go with cocoa flow and enjoy."
"This beer works well by itself or paired with a number of desserts, yum"
"One of the better Rouge beers in my opinion. This stout has a very dark brown color (thick and rich), a brown head with even carbonation. The smell is a very light hint of chocolate. A very stout taste with chocolate overtones and even more chocolaty aftertaste  nice. Its has a light mouth feel for a stout. This is a very nice chocolate stout!"
"Overall = An OK stout that I draink with apathy. I can't really recommend it, , but it's worth a try for stout fans."
"Beer and Chocolate, what could be better together?!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is meduim bodied. The beer is not as chewy in the mouth as some other stouts; however, this is still a dam fine beer."
"A very flavorful version of the style. Unique, yet still true to the style. I don't see myself getting tired of this one."
"mouthfeel is creamy and pretty heavy, but its delicious flavor makes it smooth. drinkability is excellent. only drawback is its price, but its worth the luxury once in a while. one of my favorites for the winter season."
"This beer pours black and thick. It almost looks syrupy as it cuts through the one finger head. The head is brownish tan in color and provides good lacing. The lacing continued to stick for the entire beer which surprised me. Aroma is clearly chocolate. Just like a bag of Hershey's Cocoa powder. The malts are also a little toasty smelling, but mostly hidden by the sweet smell of chocolate. Taste is outstanding and actually has good balance between the sweet chocolate malts and hops, which became more noticeable as I drank the beer. Hops have a grassy quality. Creamy, but finishes a little dry and surprisingly crisp. One word can sum this one up. Wow."
"This brew pours a dark, nearly black color with a dense tan head of moderate height. Decent lace, coupled with the visual perception of thick heaviness and serious viscosity make this an attractive one. This is another one of those beers that deserves lots of nose attention: big-time chocolate malt, deeply roasted grain, oats, dark coffee. Its a little grainy at the start, and moderately sweet. The mouthfeel is full, robust, and creamy. Its an experience. Light bitterness in the finish as a balance. This one is a wonderful, no-nonsense piece of art. I wish that I had another bottle right now."
"Drinkability- For something made with chocolate, this has a great need to be imbibed.Especially for desert."
"As far as chocolate beers go, this is the best I have had. Makes an excellent dessert by itself but I am sure it would go excellent with a slice of chocolate cake (perhaps it would even make a good cake!). Go out and find one if you haven't because this is what a chocolate beer should be!"
"I bought this and Young's double chocolate on the same trip in order to get my chocolate stout fix. I drank the Young's a few nights ago and was bitterly dissapointed, I don't feel that young's is up to the hype. This beer however is about as prefect as I could imagine from a chocolate stout. Pours as black as any beer i've seen with a frothy mocha colored head which was moderate but left nice lacing, Aroma was soft and subtle but difinitely chocolatey. Doesn't really even seem like smelling beer, it is so subtle and candylike. Taste is just right, chocolate is definitely the key here but it changes to mocha and then to coffee in the finish. I was worried that this would be too sweet but it is perfectly balanced and with each taste I respect what Rogue have done here that much more. Truly a world class effort, I suspect this is now the bar by which any chocolate stout will be judged."
"for once, a 22 oz. bomber is not enough...i could drink this stuff like coffee. not that i tried it this time, but this might even be tasty warmed up. will definitely sample again. i think the saucer has it on tap..."
"Taken as a whole, this beer is terrific. This is what I have been looking for in a chocolate beer. It tastes very strongly of chocolate (which is more than some other chocolate beers can say). Big body and bold flavor with fine balance makes for a great beer. Try it with chocolate cake; good stuff!"
"Wow! As I open this bottle man the aromas of milk chocolate sweetness, floural hop, brown butter, vanilla, Cadbury milk chocolate. This beer pours a jet black and leaves a silky brown head that looks like you poured too much vanilla in your whipped cream. As I smell this beer all the aromas I talked about milk chocolate, brown butter(butterscotch), coffee, floural hops, caramel, sugar, vanilla, are all on display in this beer. The taste of this beer just explodes on your palate. It starts with a vanilla chocolate sweetness then moves to a bitter hop kick followed by a coffee essence and finally finishes with a silky smooth butterscotch aftertaste. This is a fantastic stout I'm sad I took this long to get to it, I will not make that mistake again."
"cheers..."
"This stout pours a deep dark color. The head is a tan color and disappointingly minimal in both size and duration (but this really does not distract from how wonderful tasty this beverage is). The smell is of fine mocha and sweet malts. The taste is rather complex, being sweet, with a strong chocolate flavor. There is an occasional bitter finish to the taste which is not overly distracting. Certainly a descent stout worth searching out and enjoying."
"Interesting mouthfeel, a bit heavy, but very smooth drinking. Big flavors, but not overwhelming. Easily the best Rogue brew I've had thusfar and best chocolate stout."
"Note: Ran to the kitchen to grab a few pieces of dark chocolate as a I finished this fine Rogue product."
"The only difference from this and the Shakespeare stout was that the head was a significantly darker color and that the smell and taste of the beer had a distinct chocolate flavor to it. These factors do not make the beer any better or any worse in my opinon just different. And to be honest with you being different is one of the greatest qualities of any beer. This normally factors greatly into my drinkability"
"It is a good choice if you like these type of brews. I was surprised how good it was, and will drink it again. Definately worth the adventure."
"Cheers!"
"With a name like Chocolate Stout, I was expecting this to be way to sweet. Rogue did an excellent job. The bitterness in the end is perfectly done in contrast to the chocolate flavors, making this like a liquified block of dark chocolate. I really don't see how this beer can be improved. Flawless."
"Beer is good. Happy chocolating!"
"Drinkability: Very good."
"D: I only had one of these and would have another if I could on tap. amazing."
"Exceptional beer."
"Drinkability  The overbearing cocoa notes detract from my ability to really get into this beer, but one can tell some work went into making it. Solid. Not my cup of tea."
"Pours dark black with some minimal brown highlights. The head is fluffy and pudding like, but doesnt stick around long. Espresso and super dark chocolate smell with a hidden hop sweetness. Tastes of Hersheys and coffee with a sourness that lingers around the edge of the tongue. Finishes sour and then fades into a sweet cocoa. Mouth feel is a little light. There's tons of chocolate to go around here if that's your thing."
"One question though. . . What was the brown goo left in the bottom of my glass?"
"This is worth picking up. I will be grabbing a few more of these in the very near future."
"D- This beer is a nice smooth stout. It has good qualities and it has a nice faint chocolate flavor that is made with great grains and not chocolate powder or extracts. It is nice to see a chocolate stout that is well balanced with hops and dark malts but stays true to beer ingredients."
"Slight points detracted for the lingering bitterness in the end. Nothing bad, but the mouthfeel is just slighlty too bitter. However, I cant remember a better beer I have ever had. Bravo!"
"Very dark brown with very nice tan head Smells of sweet malts and chocolate. Alcohol scents are present. Wonderful chocolate and smokey flavors. Very rich with not much alcohol as the scent suggests. Medium to full bodied with light effervesance. Very nice"
"Perfect appearance. Almost black, great tan foam that sticks around forever and coats the glass. The smell is domineering chocolate. The taste...wow it's almost too chocolatey to be a beer. You could confuse it for some sort of chocolate liqueur until the roasted malt kicks in gently to balance the chocolate taste. There is also some molasses sweetness hiding underneath it all, which in my opinion really completes this brew. That's all I get here, but the interplay is done to perfection. The finish is mildly bitter and dry from the chocolate and the acidity of the malt. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and thick for a beer of this ABV - definitely is only hurt by the decadence of it all. This is amazing."
"D - Very good. Definitely one you want to continue to sip over and over. A great stout."
"Just a damn tasty stout. This beer is exactly what it advertises. If you want a chocolate stout, look no further."
"You could probably make chocolate out of this beer."
"This stout is the top of the food chain as far as the evolution of American beer ingenuity goes. It's like putting Laura Secord in a bottle. Dark brown appearance with ample lacing and serious retention. The smell/taste/mouthful aspect of this stout was like a 6-4-3 double play in baseball; it just flowed to a natural progression culminating with a chocolate experience unlike any I've ever had before. Exceptional drinkability may be a gross understatement as this maybe one of the five finest beers I've ever had the pleasure to sip (and sip and sip and sip). Kudos to the Rogue Brewery. PS/ Please send more product to Ontario Canada"
"Drinkability: This is a fabulous brew, replacing Youngs Double Chocolate as my favorite chocolate beer. The sweet aroma & contrasting bitterness is balanced so well. And the finish just makes me want to have more. Hmm.. I think I will."
"My only real complaints here (and they are minor) is that at 6% ABV, I really shouldn't be able to taste the alcohol. The balance leans slightly on the bitter side, just a hair more sweetness and this would be an instant favorite for dessert. That said, this is a very good stout and a must-try for any stout or chocolate lover. Floats anyone?"
"Im not writing off Rogue by any means. It could be a bad bottle; I might have served it incorrectly. I dont know, but I have to admit I was hoping for a little bit more drinkable beer."
"Chocolate. Smells like it. Tastes like it. Looks like it. Pours thick and black with a nice mocha head. The chocolate is the dominant flavor but also has some smoky and malty characters. Hops were not too evident. Really smooth to drink, unfortunately it was on special by the pitcher and even with pawning some off on my skeptical friends I was overwhelmed after two pints. It really s quite bittersweet. Very enjoyable for a pint or two."
"Dark dark dark color with an absolutely beautiful creamy brown head. Smells chocolatey, with a hint of dark fruit waaaay in the background. Deep, very rich. Tastes delicious- at first you get a wave of coffee and burntness, and then the chocolate sneaks up on you. Deep, rich, complex, and not overly sweet and cavity-producing. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and creamy. I could not drink a bomber of this on my own... but it's damn good. Drink your dessert. Cheers."
"Good though. Pleasing to the palate. Some might even wax poetic at it."
"Chocolate and Oatmeal aromas. Pours dark brown, with light brown creamy head. Bittersweet(mostly bitter) taste similar to baking cocoa. Noticible taste of hops. Thick. Overall, a very interesting beer if you are in the right mood. Not something I'd drink a normal bassis, but definitely worth a try."
"At 6% ABV its not too strong, and would make a nice dessert after a steak dinner. Try eating some chocolate while drinking this beer. Amazing."
"Very black stout. Black like, well, dark chocolate. Pours with a decent, one finger brown head that lasts for most of the duration. No lace, but that's okay. Smells mainly of dark chocolate, with a subtle hint of roasted malts. Hmm, very bittersweet taste. Sweet and bitter dark chocolate, with a bit of a roasted toast taste as well. Nice. Very nice. Mouthfeel is, hmm. Not light, but ligher than expected? I guess medium light. Good, but I was expecting something thicker. Drinkable? Hell yes. Perhaps not session beer drinkable, but one could drink these all night and not get tired of it."
"The color is pitch black with a light-brown head that is incredably thick and creamy. The aroma is of dark baker's chocolate with a nice bit of roastiness thrown in as well. The taste is of an incredably rich, sweet chocolate flavor with a mild roast flavor. The dark chocolate flavors also provide a moderate bitterness that accenuate the incredable chocolatey flavor. A hint of hops gives the flavor a little bit of an edge and reminds you that you're drinking a Rogue product. Anyway, this is world class."
"What a fun, tasty treat. This is a dessert unto itself, and a neat little novelty item--but surprisingly, there's a darn good stout in the midst of all the chocolate beer gimmickery."
"Notes: Well this is probably one of my favorite stouts to date, although Shakespeare is right up there. Rogue does a really nice job with their stouts. They impressed me more than Old Rasputin or Samuel Smith's even, and those are imperials. Well done, Rogue."
"This is an excellent beer. Pours up thick and black smooth out of the bottle and appealing from the start. The head really rises more so than I would have expected to almost 2 1/2 fingers before settling out to 1/4 finger and lacing the glass forever. The head is mocha in color and had large pockets of air within exagerating the thick frothy texture. The smell is sweet and grainy heavy on chocolate and malt, this is decieving, understood when the flavor hits your tongue. This beer does not taste nearly as sweet as it smells, the light sugary flavor of the chocolate and malt is balanced more than adequately by an excellent hop base. The thick pour of this beer is a dead givaway to the smooth frothy feel. One of the best I have had from an overall standpoint, not an everday pour but nice for special occasions, will drink again."
"This brew pours a black color with a big tan head. The aroma is as chocolatey as chocolate. As is the beer were chocolate milk. The taste is as chocolatey as this brew's name suggests. There is also a hint of coffee, which adds some complexity. The mouthfeel is full bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a very good brew. Relaxing and comforting."
"edit (10.24.05): not so fast! did a vertical with the shakespeare and the chocolate stouts. these are both equally impressive in almost every way, but are slightly different. i just can't accurately say which i like better and which i'd rank higher. if i had a gun to my head, the shakespeare might have to get the nod."
"Pours an absolute pitch black with a lovely thick tan head. A wonderful and pervasive semi-sweet baking chocolate aroma in the nose. Not much roastedness detectable; the chocolate really takes over. The taste is a near perfect blend of the chocolate into the stout flavours. It starts off with a semi-sweet chocolate but then blends seamlessly into the gentle roasted bitteness of the stout and finishes with a subtle hop bitterness. No one flavour dominates and the meld in a subtle interplay. A very nicely balanced chocolate stout. Nice smooth mouthfeel, with a gentle carbonation. A very lovely and exceedingly drinkable after-dinner beer. Quite pleased that the LCBO decided to get this in."
"This is one of the best stouts around.A full dark chocolately two finger head with a very dark liquid beer.The smell is full sweet aromatic and delicious.A dark creamy taste with hints of hops,chocolate.and coffee.Rogue never stops amazing me.I would love to try this on tap."
"On a side note, the label says 6% ABV, but I swear this has to be at least 8%, it hits pretty hard."
"22 ounce bomber. This beer pours out dark brown with a brown head. The aroma is a delicious chocolate smell with some roasted malts. The flavor is very roasty. This is probably the best use of chocolate I've tasted in a beer. There is just a bit of sweetness, but this beer is mainly bitter. The hops are just able to come through the strong malt and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy. Make sure to let this beer warm up a little before you drink. The aroma and flavor really come through as the beer warms."
"I thought this might be good since it's rarely seen on the shelves. The initial balance is good and very drinkable and the finish has an initial strong but balanced metallic, grapefruit, and astringent smoothness."
"Definitely worth a try."
"A good offering from Rogue. A nice thick & creamy head on a dark beer. Just the way I like em'. Tastes great with a pronounced roasted flavor. Lots of lacing. This is a beer that is certainly worth buying again. Bitterness is also a prominate feature. A must try for dark beer lovers."
"D: Awesome, but the body & strength prohibits it from being a long session brew. This one's more of a meal."
"Tasting notes: Dark malt that is slightly charred (which is good) , dark semi-sweet chocolate, caramel, etc."
"Tastes of coffee and cream. Of course it had chocolate in the flavor as well. Creamy mouthfeel. Excellent beer."
"Chocolate stout indeed! Big tan head sits atop brown-black body. The smell bring out roasted malts but softly mixed with vanilla and some almond. The taste is a big chocolate kiss meet with a cream almost gelatin like roast malt and a hint of hop bitterness. Beware the last pour as I ended up with leftover chocolate matter in my glass. Overall a good drinker and not bad when your in the mood."
"Overall, a nice, high quality stout by Rogue."
"Full bodied and delicious, I could buy this all the time."
"Beer pours a jet black with a big creamy beige head that quickly reduces to a thin cap. Moderate amount of lacing. Big cocoa aroma hits right away--more smelling reveals more rich luscious chocolate and a hint of roasted malt. Taste is a delicious assertive bitter dark chocolate with just a hint of floral hops. This is the most chocolate tasting chocolate stout I've ever had---every sip has a rich chocolate note--you don't have to go searching. This is a perfect beer either for just enjoying on it's own or pairing with a chocolate desert."
"This is one I wish I could find more often. Very tasty on its own, but would probably go very well with cocolate cake, brownies or ice cream... Or all of the above."
"High Quality. The appearance is a solid brown which lets no light though. This beer pours with a nice brownish tan head, which laces the glass. The smell is of chocolate and the taste of course is of...chocolate. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated with a nice chocolate taste, which turns with a slight bitterness. A drinkable beer. But because of the richness I couldnt drink too many. Like I first stated, high quality."
"Opinion: This is an excellent beer. I really like how the chocolate is a noticeable addition rather than a sharp roast that comes from generous helpings of chocolate malt. I personally think that this beer could use an addition of oatmeal or lactose sugar or something to negate the bittering component added by the cocoa. Just a thought...but still an excellent beer."
"What can I say, I enjoyed one pint six fluid ounces (650ml) of an ebony slice of rich chocolate cake, like your 10th birthday, with an earthy flavor of oats that gives way to a truffle finish. Oregon brewed, Sebbie Brown could not have done better.ah yes, Sebbie, a vision of beauty silk screened on the chocolate colored bottle.how appropriate. Kudos Rogue Ales Brewery, kudos indeed."
"Serving type 22oz brown bottle. This beer simply put is amazing . Pours a deep chocolate color with a ruby lining. A small tan head that disappears pretty quickly. Smells of roasted malts and dark chocolate. A bit of hop bitterness in the front, but by the finish you would swear you are drinking a chocolate shake just not quite as thick. One of the best chocolate beers Ive ever had."
"The taste is fantastic to say the least - everything blends well - the chocolate, the roasty taste, the bitterness (but not TOO bitter). It slides down easily - no strange aftertaste. I could definitely drink more than one. This beer is on point. I'm a fan of Rogue, so I got what I expected. =)"
"The only tip I could offer for improvement on this beer would be a smoother mouthfeel - possibly a little less bite? It is not a big deal, and not overpowering, but something a bit mellower would be nice."
"Pours the deepest brown hue (almost black) with a smallish, dark, coffee-colored head. Aroma of rich, roasted chocolate malt, sweet brown sugar, and a touch of yeast. Huge palate of roasted chocolate malt, lactose sugar, and a little tinge of hop bitterness. An exceptional mouthfeel - rich, smooth, more than a little like chocolate milk. The perfect accompaniment to a rich chocolate torte."
"Poured an opaque black color with a medium sized tan head and some lacing on the edges of the glass. Sweet chocolate blunt wrap aroma. Nice full chocolate taste with some roasted malt. Although I gave the palate a 4, I was being generous. The chocolate certainly was there, but it was not as rich as I hoped for."
"drinkability: very drinkable"
"It was a dark chocolate color. Doesn't let any light through. Thick creamy colored head. Smell of like a chocolate esspresso. Taste is rich and complex. Taste like an expensive coffee, strong with a hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick and rich. Love to let the creamy foam rest on my palate. For such a rich complex brew, it is incredibily drinkable. It has a wonderful aftertaste that last a while. This is the perfect beer to reward yourself for life's great accomplishments. Such as: mowing the lawn, doing the dishes, or making it to work on time."
"This stout poured as black as night with creamy, brown foam that settled to a thin coat and clung to the glass a bit. The smell was full of chocolate and cocoa with some mild maltiness as well. The taste was chocolatey -- darky bitter, with cocoa, malt and some bitter hoppiness in the finish. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with full body and good carbonation. The bitter chocolate flavor lingered in the aftertaste. Very nice. This was an excellent beer, and I wonder why I don't drink it more often?"
"I can't believe I waited so long to try this! Pours a jet black with a gorgeous mocha head (2 fingers thick)- the lacing was pretty sweet but retention could have been a little bit better. Such an awesomely powerful aroma- I kept sniffing this beer all the way through the 22nd oz. Smells like slightly bitter dark chocolate with just a tinge of roastiness. Taste is less bitter and more milky, thick and rich without being choking. Tastes just like milk chocolate, not like beer at all- definitely hides the alcohol. At least a top 3 stout if not the best (imperials not included)!"
"Wonderfully filling and very drinkable. Skip the dessert menu this beer will be far better than anything else there. Although perhaps a little too heavy in chocolate flavour, this is a great beer and one to revisit often."
"It's like chocolate milk for the beer dependent. Plops viscously into the glass. Raises a 1/2"" solid tan-brown head, laces well. Opaque brown - black in color. Smells boldly of cocoa, roasted grains, and a twinge of lactic acid. Tastes thick and rich of bittersweet chocolate, barley malt, and dark grains. Nice blend of alcohol warms into the body and thins the beer toward the finish. Lingers of chocolate and roasted grains. A slight hop bite remains in the back of the throat. A very good beer. Not a whole lot of different flavors, just 2 or 3 that are seriously bold. Now, I need to find a cookie and some ice cream."
"Pours pitch black, maybe the blackest stout I've seen. Barely a glitter of light through the edges when held up to a light. Big two finger coffee colored head with excellent retention and good lacing. Smell is amazing - cocoa powder, chocolate syrup, dark baker's choclate. I almost don't want to stop smelling it. Taste doesn't disappoint though. Same multi-faceted chocolate flavors as in the nose, with some mocha, espresso, and a slight hoppy bite in the finish. Not the most complex overall taste package, but a delicious one nonetheless. Mouthfeel is fairly well carbonated, smooth, yet crisp. I have found that Rougue Ales tend to be delicious, but fairly one-dimensional. Out of the 4 Rougues I've tried (Hazelnut Nectar, Mocha Porter and Shakespeare being the others) this is the most robust and interesting. Simply a world class stout if you like chocolate. Not overpoweringly sweet. Just the right amount of coffee/hop bitterness. A must try for any stout lover."
"Bottle obtained from Superior Liquor (Colorado) and consumed a couple evenings later in August 2005. Pours a two finger dark brown head over a pitch black liquid. No edging when held to light. Smells...wow. Chocolate, molasses, a hint of roast. Sweet, malty, chocolatey. Desert. Chocolate dominating the flavor with bourbon cherries underneath. Campfire wood. Fudge-cicle. Okay, a minute of sniffing and the head is a thin layer over the beer...what's it taste like? Starts chocolate with some cherry (ie, black patent) sour. While these start strong, they become very powerful during the swallow and in the aftertaste. As they rise, they get a more refined quality and a faint espresso/coffee-roast steps in, too. As strong as the flavors are, I'm surprised the flavors aren't clinging to my tongue. The body is heavy, but not thick. The finish is quite clean. Dry actually, with some hop bitter. A touch of citrusy hop flavor puts the chocolate on guard. Oddly, there is a flavor in my mouth, like I just toked on a cigarette after several months without one. Nah, maybe it's just a bit of wood flavor, like the wood that I found in the smell. Anyway, this was a really enjoyable beer. As much as I hate Rogue for the overpriced offerings they've recently put out (you know those bottles that are super-premium priced in flashy but stupid bottles), I have to admit, they make really tasty beers."
"Notes: If you drink it cold it has a dry coffee type characteristic. When it warmed the chocolate was in control."
"Drinkability was exceedingly good. Although I like stouts, I am not what could be termed a stout lover... my favorite style is double IPA, so I prefer much hoppier, somewhat lighter beers... but I could have had another of these, and it was in a 22 oz. bomber."
"Had this brew for dessert tonight. Didn't need anything else. An excellent way to end the night. I put off trying this brew for some time, mostly because I tend to take Rogue's line for granted since it's so readily available. I'm glad I finally gave it a try. Will defintely be looking for this beer in the fall."
"Pitch black color with a large creamy brown head. Smells rich with sweet chocolate, coffee malts, and a hint of bitter hops. The flavor is full of hints of burnt malts and bittersweet chocolate. Kind of like chocolate chips. A hint of bitter hops pull through. Full bodied and a creamy silky mouthfeel. Has a semi-dry bitter-sweet aftertaste. Damn, this is a good stout. One of the best flavored stouts I have ever had."
"I had the first glass by itself and the second with a slice of cherry pie, can't go wrong either way. Very nice."
"Drinkability: I have to say, I wouldn't want this all the time. I would, however, like to try it with a dessert next time, as pairing this with many different things would probably make some amazing texture and flavor combinations. I'm going to get another one ASAP and save it again for another night, sipping for as long as possible."
"This is easily the best chocolate beer that Ive had. Strong aromas of chocolate, along with the slightest hint of roasted coffee. The flavor is of authentic chocolate, not processed chocolate syrup, but REAL chocolate. The sweetness is well balanced by the hops and some Munich-ish malts. Id be in big trouble if I could drink this all the time!"
"I still like it very much, but there's much bigger goals in life."
"This beer pours black with brown head. The head stuck around for a little while but slowly faded into a ring around my glass. The nose is amazing. It smells like chocolate mixed with maple syrup. The flavor is also very chocolatey with sort of a maple flavor thing going on in there as well. I also detect some coffee flavor. This is the best stout I have had in a long time. Great mouthfeel. Nice and creamy with a full body. Very drinkable beer. A must try."
"(Big) bottle with a characteristic Rogue illustration on it. Poured dark brown with a massive dense light-UPS-brown head that laced well. Organic chocholate and caramel on the nose, plenty of coffee too, something like burnt wood lingering too. Tastes just the same as it smells with the addition of one of the best feels (you just want to let it linger and caress your tongue) I've had. Given the stye I think the feel is not improvable. I can't say it's too drinkable though, although I'd certainly go for it, because it is a bit sensory overwhelming. Kinda of like the feeling I get when I have a nice Scotch with a fresh chocolate cookie."
"Flavor has Rogue quality, I'm assuming from the yeast. I like this, but not like others do, but it's not up to some of their other beers like Shakespeare."
"D&N: I think if I ever have this on cask, I may drop dead of the sheer pleasure. I'm trying very hard to fight giving this one fives across the board, I can picture this one on cask and it haunts me. The brewers at Rogue have come up with a true masterpiece. One of the finest beers I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. This isn't beer, this is pure indulgence in liquid form. Buy this beer if you see it. Buy three. It's that good."
"I could drink these all night, but I could see where it would be filling for some. Excellent with a meal, but stands strong by itself as a dessert beer."
"i still enjoyed this beer, but i think its possibly just a tad overrated. if you want a smooth chocolate stout, get youngs, if you want a big, robust and intensely hoppy stout, get shakespeare or storm king. this is somewhere inbetween, and its not so much fencesitting as trying to get the best of both worlds. in my assessment it doesnt quite work."
"Some people might give this a low drinkability score, because it's so thick and full of flavor and filling. I won't. I could drink this stuff morning, noon, and night. I would drink this morning, noon, and night, if school/work/money/life in general wouldn't get in the way."
"Pours an opaque black with a thin khaki head that never quite disappears. First smell reveals creamy chocolate, but swirling the glass a little uncovers roasted grain, coffee, and even some lovely hops. Uber-smooth malts begin the flavor, with the creamy milk chocolate coming in pleasantly early. The sweet smooth chocolate sticks around, adding an extremely nice flavor to this stout. Roasted grain is there, along with a little fresh roasted coffee. Finish has a hint of citrous hops with also provide subtle spice. Long aftertaste keeps this hoppy chocolate wonder in my mouth long after swallowing. A truely exceptional brew from Rogue."
"This is only my third time or so having this style of beer(chocolate stout). I must say I was overwhelmed with the wonderful chocolate taste and smooth drinkability of this beer. I ordered this brew at a restaurant before my food came and damn near wanted to cancel my food and have a two or three more of these, as this is a very filling beer. This one would taste great paired with damn near anything or alone. Rogue has definately done it again with this one. Man, am I glad I found this one on tap! This seems to me to be what other chocolate stouts should be measured by."
"It came in a 22oz bottle but wish it either larger:) or I bought several. A very good stout indeed."
"This is an outstanding dessert beer. I feel like I should have a nice cigar around, though my bronchitis keeps that from being an option (haven't had a cigar in 4 months - no longer smoke anything else at all, yet I get bronchitis from f-ing allgergies. Doh!). This is way too sweet to have several pints, but as a one bottle per session beer, it's quite nice. This will have to serve as my New Beer Sunday beer, as I'm off to Wenatchee for several days and, coincidentally, don't anticipate anything new (or, frankly, good) for several days."
"Brown head lasting long and stylish like black beercolor. Nose is exceptional giving away a magnificent chocolate arome surrounded by great maltarome and beautiful hopbouqet in a very dry a strawlike surrounding. Never expirienced a chocolate aroma fresh and good as that! Taste is also great being dry, burnt, again straw like and litle cacao give it a strange not. But hell yes this is highly enjoyable and great to drink teasing my mouth and nose and whole body to take another sip. What a great beer IMHO!"
"This brew pours a dark, murkey black color with a small head that falls to a very generous ring over top of the brew. I don't know if a stout can look any better. The nose is just like cooled down hot chocolate. Huge milk-chocolate just nails me in the nose. Its almost like sniffing the concentrated powder before adding liquid. This truely is a chocolate stout. The flavor is very chocolate, but with a backbone of deep roasted to burnt malt. I enjoy it. The feel is where this brew falters. Its moderate at best. I would really like to see a nice healthy thickness on the feel. It really deserves it. Overall, not a bad brew. I find it easy drinking. The flavor is pretty darn nice. Head to head with a Brooklyn Black Chocolate, it would falter, but it is definately doing the trick for me right now."
"Drinkability is high for its style...just 6% makes this a session brew if you like the type. I would, personally prefer Brooklyn's Chocolate Stout a bit more, but both are two of the best out there."
"Split a bomber with the wife. Poured into a pint glass. Dark brown, opaque, but not black, with a rocky tan head. Lacing graced the sides of the glass. Nose is a licorice and dark chocolate blend with some cocoa, light vanilla hints also. Taste is burnt malt (maybe the hops kicking in there) with chocolate overall. Finish is bitter, just this side of dry. Mouthfeel is creamy in the middle, but wet around the edges. A fine tasting chocolate stout, though I prefer the Brooklyn and the Young's over this. I would never refuse one though. I just love Rogue Ales. Tough to go wrong with them."
"Pours a dark dark brown with a hige brown head and great lace. Smwlls of bittersweet chocolate with some highly roasted malt with a hint of cinnamon. Tastes of a highly roasted malt with a bitterswet chocolate. Probably as close to burt as you can get without actually being burt. Tick and chewy with medium carbonation and a coffee like bitternes on the tongue. Not a huge drinkability factor due to its heavyness but will make a great dessert brew."
" An excellent dessert beverage."
"Pours an almost pitch black with a bumpy brown colored head. There are some little chunks of chocolate in there too. Smells like, umm, chocolate. Of course it is a bit more complex than that! If I had to put a finger on it, I'd say it reminds me a little of German chocolate cake. Taste has a nice bittersweet chocolate flavor with some dark roasted malt. I do have to admit, I occassionally taste an odd metallic off-flavor. From what I gather, this wasn't an old bottle either. This is very disappointing because overall this is one fine stout. Mouthfeel is also a tad thin for such a heavy looking beer. Very smooth, almost like chocolate milk. I'll always try and have one of these in my stash."
"Pours with a one-finger light brown head that leaves a little lace. Totally opaque black color. Medium bodied and light carbonation. Nose is strong chocolate. Starts with a strong dark chocolate flavor (are there Hersey bars in this??) and finish is a mix of chocolate and hops. $4.89 for a 22oz bottle from Northend Superette Manchester, NH."
"22 oz. bomber straight into a large snifter. Pours black, not even a dark red, it pours black. The head was a dark brown, almost looked like some kind of chocolate frosting placed on top. Smells of burnt coffee, strong chocolate and mild hops and alcohol. First taste is of strong coffee, strong chocolate, and it finished with a satisfying mix of chocolate and mild hop kick. One of the first craft beers I tried, but one that I keep coming back to. Highly recommended."
"This beer pours out of a bomber into a pint with a 2 finger dark brown colored head and a jet black color that light cannot pervade. The smell is utterly fantastic, easily one of the best smelling beers i've ever come across. It smells like the best dessert you could imagine, dark yet sweet chocolate truffle with a hint of vanilla, perfection! The taste nearly lives up to the smell, begins with bitter hops that resemble a dark unsweetened chocolate, followed by a smooth malty middle and ends with a sweet milk chocolate sweetnesss that rests on the tongue along with a slight hops bitterness. A perfectly put togeather stout, one of the best stouts period and easily the best chocolate stout i've tried. Not very drinkable, 22oz is the most i could see drinking at a time and its quite filling. Goes well with any type of fine chocolate. Excellent stout, period."
"The drinkability is nice, a 22 oz bomber is perfect for this one."
"Drinkability- One of my top chocolate flavored stouts. Not quite as good as Stone IRS, but not that far. Quite delicious. Would be great as an after dinner dessert."
"Finger licking good!"
"Pours jet black with decent head retention into a nonic pint glass. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, maybe some fruits present. Taste is quite bold, not overly complex. Just a ton of chocolate creamyness, maybe a touch of coffee and a pronounced hop finish. The hop/chocolate dynamic was an interesting one, although it very much limits this beer's drinkability in my opinion. A very good beer, though not quite as complex as I was expecting. I've had it on draft before and found that to be a much better experience. I would drink this out of the bottle again though."
"Taste is very bitter, a great hoppish finish that beer has, some dark chocolate flavours and roasted malts are also present. It is quite different, but even me a hophead, I do thing the imbalance between the hops and the rest of the beer is not very pleasurable for long. Not a bad beer, just it doesnt go down smoothly compared to well balanced american stout."
"edit: I ended up mixing the second half of this bomber with the second half of the Rogue Chipotle Ale I just reviewed as well for a Molé Black & Tan. It was good, but I think I liked this beer better on its own, as the smokiness of the chipotle ale tends to overpower the chocolate."
"This is an artistic and imaginative beer whose exotic properties are neither shy nor misplaced."
"."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. The brew developed a nice dark tan head that dropped down to a very fine cap after about 5 minutes. Coffee, chocolate, dark roasted malts wafted from the glass. Chocolate and roasted malts dominated the initial sip with a nice balance of hops. Swirl the aroma around in the mouth and I can still taste the chocolate, roasted malts and some oatiness too. Slightly dry on the finish. I really enjoyed this brew very much and plan on getting some more in the future."
"Pours a beautiful pitch black with a great big dark tan head. Smells a lot sweeter than I expected, like high quality hot cocoa mix. Burnt coffee and malt aromas as well. Tastes like cocoa beer! A very prominent chocolate flavor dominates at first, then fades into a bitter coffee flavor. Finish is dry, with a slight chocolate aftertaste. This beer is a little heavy on the sweetness, but as it is a chocolate stout, that is not to be counted against it. Reminds me of a more in-your-face version of Young's Double Chocolate. As a novelty, I did enjoy this brew."
"Pours black with a rich tan head to die for. Chocolate aroma dominates. Burnt bitter taste eddy in a river of chocolate that flows from chocolate mountains. Great beer to end a tasting session. It could not get much better. Not embarrassed to stand behind the high marks. Why the ""low"" drinkability rating? I noticed that I was getting more than my 1/4 share. Joe, Derek, and Dave thanks for a nice evening with five craft brews ending with this standout."
"Notes: This was a very good stout. I love the chocolate as being an aftertaste. This chocolate was not over powering, but right where it needs to be. I was not impressed with the price, but I was impressed with the quality and taste."
"As Wonka says, ""Invention, my dear friends, is 93% perspiration, 6% electricity, 4% evaporation, and 2% butterscotch ripple."" In this case, its 2% Rogue magic."
"Deep black pour with a tight thick head of dark brown bubbles. Head retains pretty well before eventually dissipating. Smell is sweet with some dark chocolate and just a little bit of hoppiness to go along with the big roasted malts. Flavor is roasted malt with a lot of chocolate, but it's different from most chocolate stouts I've had. The addition of the real chocolate seems to give it a feel that doesn't taste like cocoa powder was poured in after the beer was brewed. It's deliciously complex and tasty and not at all cloyingly sweet. The Cascade hops are always there in each sip and tie everything together nicely. I might not want more than a bomber of this in a sitting, but it's delicious! Head and shoulders above all of the other chocolate stouts out there...if this one didn't cost so much, I think I'd drink it all the time."
"I enjoyed this with a bowl of vanilla ice cream on top of a banana, delish! Highly recommended, nice job Rogue."
"Slàinte!"
"Wow, powerful chocolate flavor up front, followed quickly by a light hop bitterness. Maybe a little too bitter. The richness lent by the malt up front doesnt balance as well with the hop here. Great velvety mouth feel, still very drinkable."
"Pours an opaque deep brown color with a growing chocolate milk colored head leaving nice lacing as the head subsides. Delicate aroma of chocolate amongst black patent and chocolate malts, a touch of oat and a decent hop aroma (for a stout). Almost too chocolatey. Roasted barley scorchiness helps alleviate this stout from being too distracting with chocolate. Decent dryness in the finish from the hops. Nicely balanced between chocolatey sweetness and the drier finish. Subtle carbonation works well. On its own, a solid stout, the addition of chocolate makes it a bit more luxurious and exotic. I'm not really even a big fan of chocolate, but this stout is great. No synthetic chocolate taste whatsoever. However, is is a touch too cloying to make a sessioner out of..."
"Cheers..."
"Heck, pair this up with some black forest cake and drink this instead of milk next time. Great stuff."
"Pours black with a brownish tan head. The name of this brew cant even trick Mr. Obvious. Smells of Chocolate, with hints of coffee. As far as taste goes, this one tops the ""Stout Chart"" and you guessed it, tastes like chocolate. However, I had a 22oz bottle of this, and if I hadnt shared it, I probably couldn't have finished it by myself. A 12oz bottle would be a perfect serving size. Overall another wonderful beer by Rogue."
"This beer pours a very dark brown, just like melted dark chocolate. The head is dark tan with good head retention. It leaves a good amount of laces on the glass. It smells like chocolate. There are hints of rosted malts, but the chocolate is the dominant aroma. This beer smells stronger of chocolate than any beer I have ever had. It tastes like chocolate. I cant really say any more about that. It tastes like carbonated, slightly malty chocolate. It goes down smooth. This beer is easy to drink. The carbonation is just right. I think that this beer is very good. However, I think that the strong chocolate flavor might become a little bit much after a few pints. If you havent tried this beer, you need to. Soon."
"Black hole colored if I must say so with no light transmission. I do believe light is actually being sucked into this beer. There was ample brown head to begin with which reduced to barely a coating. Aroma was of toffee with hits of tootsie rolls and expresso. Flavors of ample toasted malts and a touch of smoke. Chocolate is definately a major player in this beer. There was also an unexpected touch of slightly citrus hops coming through. Almost like that orange flavored chocolate you get around the holidays. And at the very end was a tiny amount of coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel was thinner than I expected, not really heavy at all. This is a good after-dinner beer that I'd gladly have a couple of and will revist again."
"This beer pours dark with a little dark creamy head. The smell is amazing, perhaps the best part of the stout, it is very chocolatey with a roasted malt sneaking in behind. The beer is tasty and isn't too grainy from the chocolate but becomes hard to drink. Have one but plan on sharing the bottle with a friend or two so that you don't have to drink so much chocolate."
"In summary a stout which defies logic in obtaining a non-intrusive but very rich flavor all the while not trading off on the drinkability factor. Cheers."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-two ounce enameled brown glass poptop bomber; served in a standard pint tapglass."
"Overall a good beer, worth re-visiting. I'm starting to try Rogue's selections, and I am enjoying them."
"As all stouts do this one also pours a dark coffee color. A tan head meets the top of the glass and hangs for a spell then leaves no trace. Aroma of semi-sweet chocolate is dominate nothing more and nothing less. The taste was a surprise, I thought it would be over done as some other chocolate type brews but this was well balanced with the chocolate flavor. It was not as sick sweet but a bitter sweet. Maybe the malt and hops used blended this well. Bottom line enjoyable but too much chocolate could drive me nuts after awhile so I couldnt put this as a session brew but definitely in the desert category. If you have had other chocolate brews and did not care for themtry this one from Rogue, it may change your mind."
"A very drinkable stout from Rogue!"
"Comments - This is a pretty incredible beer. Highly recommended."
"Black opaque color with an outstanding head that dies down to small froth. Chocolate aroma, nice fluffy body with a malt/chocolate flavor, aftertaste is of bittersweet chocolate. A wonderful dessert stout. This is the first beer I've ever wanted to pour over ice cream."
"Oy Vey, this is one special glass of stout. Like a rich chocolate cake with only a fraction of the calories. It is definitely a one per night brew. The rich complexity of this one would be too much for a repeat."
"This is my first chocolate stout. I was hesitant to try it because I was afraid that it would be too much on the chocolate side. But it was not and Im glad I gave it a try."
"In the hypothetical ""If you could choose only one beer"" game, this would be a contender; it manages to be completely inoffensive and flavor-rich at the same time."
"Nice body but not great, goes down smooth. This is one of the hoppiest stouts I've ever drank."
"Very good."
"Bashiba, I owe you big for this one. Merry Christmas."
"-Lush, creamy mouthfeel. Full-bodied with silk-like carbonation. Finishes with a balance of chocolate malt flavors and bright, sprucey hops."
"This beer continues to be one of my all time favs."
"I had this on tap at Smokin' Joes in Pittsburgh. This is one top notch beer. Poured a beautiful black with awesome cascading action, a brown head that stuck around to the very end and left awesome lacing. The smell is of dark chocolate, roasted malts and some hops. The taste, AMAZING. Dark chocolate and toasted malts, with the aftertaste of a chocolate truffel. The mouthfeel was rich and creamy, just as expected. It was so good I had to have another. Very drinkable, yet another awesome brew from our friends at Rogue!"
"Wow, another killer from Rogue, this boys are doing some great things."
"Overall, not a bad beer, just waaay too much to drink in one sitting (I'd settle for 6 or 7 oz once in a while). I doubt I'd buy again, unless I have someone to share with (which isn't likely...)."
"Drinkability: It's always nice to taste a stout that's full-flavored like an imperial but lacks the high ABV so that it can be drunk endlessly. Try one."
"Pours black with mahogany highlights and thick tan head which leaves good lace along the glass. Smells of very strong coffee malts, chocolate malts, and actual chocolate backed with hop spice. Flavor is a lovely balance of coffee malts, bitter-sweet chocolate, and cascade hops. Mouth-feel is soft and chewy, but relatively drinkable for a beer this heavy. Extremely appetizing as a desert beer."
"Overall, I think other Rogues have spoiled me, because this didn't live up to my expectations like I hoped it would. Either way, I recommend it because it is still a great, very tasty chocolate stout...just not exactly to my taste."
"The heavy viscocity might hurt the drinkability a bit, but truly this beer is a liquefied chocolate bar, and not of the dirty American stepchild variety. A chocoholic's dream."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a frothy tan head. Smell is of roasted malts and intense chocolate. The smell is really great but I was dissapointed by the lack of chocolate in the taste. It was sweet, malty with some hops and there was a slight chocolate flavor but nothing like I expected from the aroma. Nice thick bodied beer, like a glass of chocolate milk. Excellent drinkablity, definately a session beer."
"Black and thick, with a creamy brown head. Aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malt, some coffee. Taste was roasty, dark bitter chocolate. Somewhat smokey, somewhat sweet. After taste was a nice milky unsweetened chocolate flavour. Full bodied, yet surprisingly easy to drink. Just delicious."
"Pitch black pour. Rather long-lasting big tan head. Rich malty aroma reminiscent of chocolate milk, smarties, vanilla. Definitely reminds me of smarties... Gets a bit too tart (citric and lactic) to be extremely enjoyable to me, but as far as sweet stouts go, Ive rarely encountered better. I guess Id just love it more would another less citric hop replace those astringent cascades. Well made nutty bitter finish counters the heavy sweetness, although it tastes more like bitter black chocolate. Gets roastier and roastier as it warms, like burnt chocolate. Good full body, oatmealish, velvety."
"Looks like chocoalte, smells like chocolate and tastes like chocolate. My first chocolate stout and I was amazed how this beer really does taste like chocolate. The beer is almost black - a very dark brown with a tan leather head that did not last long but left lots of lacing on the glass. Rich, strong smell of chocoate and the taste is a tart chocolate with a hint of coffee. A smooth mouthfeel and pretty drinkable for such a unique tasting beer."
"Brown 650 mL bottle, freshness code on rear label."
"I poured this beer out of the silk-screened bomber into a standard pint glass. The body of this looks nicely dense on the pour and its just about as black as any other big stout Ive seen before. The head is surprisingly light, sort of a very light tan. That sucker is immobile for a long time though, it hangs tougher than the new kids. Big fat clumps of foamy lace cling to the glass as the liquid descends down my glass. The aroma is very inviting, roasty, nutty and not surprisingly a big fat dollop of milk chocolate. The flavor reminds me of a really nice stout mixed with chocolate milk, its that chocolatey. The flavor is predominately charred malt and soft, chewy milk chocolate, the cascade hops put their foot down a bit in the finish and after-taste but arent quite as assertive here as I perceive them in some of Rogues other beers. The mouthfeel is an even medium Id say and the carbonation lightens the perception. This is a damn fine beer, and Ive never tasted this much chocolate in any other beer before."
"Dark and thick, very roasty. Not in aroma, but certainly in solid and smooth stout. Rolled oats provide body and sweetness to otherwise semi-bitter chocolate.. Very drinkable. Very natural and well rounded, not sweet nor bitter. Nicely hopped. RIch medium-full mouthfeel."
"Although this beer was pricy, ($5.65 CDN for a 650 ml bottle) it was one that I had to try. I was not disappointed in the least. It poured a nice dark brown bordering on black, with a thick and creamy light brown head. The smell is roasted malt and a sweet coffee-like aroma. The taste is amazing, like an alcoholized mix of rich chocolate milk and espresso. The finish is like a piece of bittersweet chocolate melting down the throat. Mouthfeel is very smooth and nice a nice sweet/bitter flavour sticks around for a while. I really enjoyed this beer, and will definitely be purchasing it again soon."
"The mouthfeel is good and it goes down smoothly. Drinkability is right up there as well. It tates so good I just want to keep downing it. Forget the cake, pie, cookies or anything else...after a fine meal serve some Rogue Chocolate Stout instead."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch black stout with a medium brownish head with better then average retention. I was quite surprised at the hoppy aroma with light chocolate/ roasted coffee notes. I guess my expectation (because of the name) were to find real discernable chocolate taste, instead I feel that the overabundance of hops covered the chocolate with a lingering bitterness. A bit more sweet and chocolate taste would have been a better representation of what to expect of a chocolate stout. Nonetheless, this is a very good stout."
"Sampled while in Vegas. Poured from a 650 ml brown bottle, silk-screened label. A pitch black body, blocks out the light. Large creamy tan head. Intense chocolate aroma with faint hops. Sweet milk chocolate flavour, with dry coffee, balanced out with the cascade hops. Smooth mouthfeel, effervescent and somewhat light. Not necessarily a session ale, but one that's worth picking up on a regular basis."
"*note* One really cool thing about this beer is theres a residue left in the bottom of the glass thats like the stuff you see in a Quick chocolate milk mix. It might be yeast but it really tastes like chocolate. This beer is totally made with real chocolate."
"An excellent marriage of chocolate and beer. Worth every penny. Tasty and well crafted. Go buy a couple and be prepared to enjoy."
"I am really careful to ever label a beer as being perfect, but the beer gods allowed me to taste the nectar of heaven. This beer is phenomenal is every aspect of the sense. The 22oz bomber is a godsend. This poured out a beautiful pitch black with fluffy tan head that resembled that of a root-beer float. The smell had definate hints of chocolate that just teased the senses. That first sip got my motor-neurons running 100 mph. The sweet taste of chocolate was followed by a little burnt taste and the combinate was spectacular. This truly is the finest beer that I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying."
"Whoa! Call me the Kool-Aid Man, but I had to exclaim ""Oh Yeah!"" when I had this beer (luckily I hadn't had enough to bust through a wall yet.) Deep brown with a puffy tan head, looked good but didn't look so special, but smelled like a Hershey's Special Dark, or the bags of chocolate chips I used to steal from the kitchen cupboard. Ultra creamy fabulous semi-sweet chocolate malts with a lightly citrusy hopped coffee finish. Goes down crazy smooth with great lacing all the way. Superb."
"I like this stout....would recommend it and actually prefer it to St. Ambroise Oatmeal stout. One tip: when you pour this from the large bottle, leave 2 fingers in the bottle...swirl it then pour this into your glass...there is quite a bit of delicious oat and cocoa sediment on the bottom that really aids in the smoothness of the finish."
"22 oz. Bomber with a chick holding a mug of Stout on the front. Poured a black brew with a deep brown head that didn't last long. The aroma is fairly mild with hints of roasted grains, chocolate, and herbal hops. The flavor is exceptional as this stout has a sweetness in the beginning just as chocolate itself has a sweet creamy inital flavor, while the beer then segues to a nice chocolate finish matched by roasted malt flavors. The mouthfeel is excellent in regards to carbonation but i believe that the body is a bit light. Very drinkable with spicy foods as an excellent contrast of flavors as the Stout cuts through the heat of the dish for the brief time that it is on your tongue then after you swallow the heat is back."
"Pours a deep, beautiful, ink black with a rather active espresso colored head. Maximal lacing and good retention. Smells overtly of chocolate and coffee. This is shaping up nicely. Taste wise it is a home run. Huge waves of coffee, slightly burnt, and chocolate malt enbalm your mouth. This stuff is desert and that's just how I'm having it. Finshes slightly dry with a nice sweetly astringent quality to it. Mouthfeel is rather big but quite enjoyable. God help me if I ever find this on tap."
"Rogue Chocolate Stout was served from a 22 oz. silkscreened bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was black, and was topped by an ample brown head that eventually receeded, leaving pools of shimmering obsidian-like blackness. Rich aromas of cocoa-chocolate, cola, and creamy sasparilla wafted from the glass, integrated with a superb and intriguing roasty smoky earthiness. This stout delivered divine flavors...beginning with a dark chocolate-cola roasty maltiness that opened up with an excellent earthy cocoa bitterness and perfectly subtle non-descript esters. The finish was cocoa dry and cola-like with cherry esters, leaving lingering bitter chocolate notes. Yes I could tell there is some real chocolate in there. The body was richly full and smooth: perfect for the flavors and character of the beer. I was very impressed with the Chocolate Stout, enjoying it immensely, in contrast to the Shakespeare, which I think is a bit unrefined and out-of-wack with its esters. Being a lover of both stouts and super dark chocolate, I highly recommend this one to other like-minded individuals. Perhaps my favorite from Rogue."
"Drinkability: I'd gladly have more than one. Delicious. I'm very happy to have found it on tap in my neck of the woods."
"Well, I was wrong. The chocolate is there in the taste, but not nearly as aggressive as in the aroma, and it is quickly balanced by smooth, dark roasted malt with some nice hoppiness on the edge. The beer finishes cleaner than any stout I've ever had, as the chocolate shows up again in the aftertaste, more in the form of vanillin, perfectly balancing out the roastiness. Mouthfeel is smooth, smooth, smooth. One might classify this as a dessert beer, but I think not one to accompany dessert; rather, it IS dessert. Sublime."
"I don't care what they added to make it taste this delicious, I just hope they keep on brewing it. If ever there was a chocolate beershake, this is it. If that strikes some as heresy then I'll gladly consume their share. Rogue Chocolate Stout is, in my opinion, the definitive chocolate stout and the one by which all others will now be measured. Tremendous stuff!"
"Pours a deep viscous dark brown color which no light can escape. A nice thick creamy chocolatey head appears and stays for a while leaving a beautiful lace. Aromas are of roasted malts, coffee, cocoa, and just a slight light hop aroma. The intially taste of this beer starts off quite roasty and chocolately with the dark malts really finding their way into this brew. This follows with a nice coffee tone with hints of expresso and just more cocoa. This beer finishes smooth and thick, with a nice hop bitterness and yet more roasty malts. As for mouthfeel to this beer, there aren't many that get smoother, richer, or creamier than this beer, and its drinkability is just as good to boot!"
"This was a damn fine stout and my favorite of the Rogue's I've had so far."
"This bottle was courtesy of frank4sail, who brought it (amongst many others) to Belgium for me. I shared it with Belgianbeers during an ""American Craft-brew"" tasting the other night."
"If you are in to stouts, try it once. But that's about all you need to do with this beer."
"($3.49 / 22 oz. bottle)"
"Served in a pint glass. Beer was nearly black with little head. The aroma of chocolate was immediately evident. chocolate bars don't smell this chocolately. Sweet aroma and a slight hop backbone were detected. Taste was outstanding. Off the tap this beer had a totally different characteristic than in bottles. The strong malty chocolate was balanced by a carefully tuned hop note. Very surprizing in this style. Very agreeable. Easy on the palate, and remarkably easy to drink for a heavy, full-bodied stout. A superb brew!"
"Not as sweet as I expected from the aroma. Chocolate flavor is present and prevalent in the first few seconds to be replaced by a bitter mouthfeel that lasts through the finish. Interesting, but not something I'd enjoy on a daily basis."
"Sampled 3/16/04"
"Drinkability for me is good, I couldn't turn this into a ""session beer"" but I don't really do too many of those anymore. This is a wonderful dessert beer, campfire beer and general tounge pleaser. The only detractor is that it would overpower some meals and might not be suitable for a food-match."
"22oz Bomber. This one pours a nice black color with a great dark brown frothy head with good size. Head retention is good and it leaves a nice brown lacing about the glass. The aroma coming of this one is of heavy chocolate with a slight floral hoppiness mingling about. Some coffee can also be detected in the smell. The taste was excellent all the great qualities of a stout were present with the taste of dark chocolate. It seems the coffee flavor can out on the backside as an after taste; also there was some bitterness present. Mouthfeel was full bodies and creamy. Overall all this is a truly great beer, the chocolate is defiantly there but no overwhelming. This second half of the bomber went great with some good dark chocolate. Highly recommended, rogue does a magnificent job again."
"Man this beer looks wonderful, black on black with nice brown head, lots of rising bubbles with good lacing. Smells good roasted malts with big chocolate nose slight hint of coffee and oats.Tastes of malt flavored chocolate sweet and smooth with nice hop bite that leaves your tounge wanting more, cascade hops that is strange for a stout but good.I liked this beer but for me one at a time is plenty, kind of like a good moca grande like one now and then but drink coffee everyday."
"Overall this brew is great. It is soo very chocolatey. A very good beer and one that I will buy often."
"Found my new favorite. It was served in a 22 ounce bottle. I purposely poured it to get a nice thick head on it. It was pure, sweet chocolate brown in color. Took a while for the head to go away, so I sipped the foam. Tasted like dark chocolate toffee. A spotty lace sticks to the sides of the glass. The taste of the beer is deep, earthy malts, dark chocolate, oatmeal and coffee undertones. The finish is superb with the chocolate rising up through the nose. This is my frist 5 ever!"
"The taste is what blows me away....sweet, yet still has the strong ""stout"" feel to it. I give this beer the highest ratings I possibly can."
"Bomber bottle, pours black and rich, engine oil. Heady nose of chocolate and expresso. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Notes of expresso, cholcoate, chocolate cake. This stuff is just plain yummy. Great dessert beer, great for a night capper. Classy product from a long time major player in the craft brew market. Thanks Rogue.."
"Taste is overwhelmingly of dark chocolate. And bitter coffee as you might expect. But there is another dimension to this beer and that's the sweet milkiness that reminds you of a milk stout. Mixed with the chocolate/coffee bitterness, the creaminess lends a bittersweet quality to this brew. Again, a creamy mouthfeel with a nice bitter finish. But still very smooth. Really luscious and easy to drink. Fantastic stout."
"The smell was huge. Lots of chocolate and coffee in the aroma. Also very smooth and sweet maltiness. The taste is dominated by toffe and a slight bitterness at first and in the end leaves a massive burst of dark chocolate that lingers and coats the mouth."
"drinkability: This is definitely an enjoyable brew from start to finish and would buy it again. Would work exceptionally well as an after dinner drink in smaller portions. It's not something you'd want to quaff several glasses of unless you're really into chocolate. Too bad I've only seen Rogue Chocolate Stout in 650ML bottles."
"Black as night with a very thin, dark tan head, this beer even looks like chocolate. The smell is sweet, dark malts, but I can't really pick up any chocolate aroma specifically. Oddly, the more I smell it, the less smell my nose picks up. As the beer slides onto the tongue, the initial taste is sweet and malty. The chocolate doesn't assert itself until after it has sat on the tongue for a bit and you're ready to swallow. At that point, it really rears back and smacks...makes you think you have a piece of dark chocolate in your mouth. I detect a slight metallic taste in the aftertaste, which is ever-so-slightly off-putting. Drinkability suffers for me as it becomes almost sickingly sweet by the end fo the glass. An 8 or 9 oz. serving would be ideal as an after-dinner drink, but a 22 oz. bomber is just too much."
"Pours a beautiful and pitch black color. Fairly large dark tan head with good staying power and good lacing. Smells faintly like dark chocolate. Smooth and almost creamy. Lots of roasted malts and hoppiness. A very tasty stout thats full of chocolate flavor. Another wonderful brew from Rogue."
"One of my absolute favorite desert beers. This is pure chocolate. It pours a nice thick black with a very creamy tan head. Smell is full of roasted malts and chocolate. Taste was initially super chocolatey but later other flavors came out to play. I get faint notes of coffee and a general roasted flavor out of this as well. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is great as this is thick and creamy. Drinkability suffers a little as just 1 of these leaves me completely satiated."
"Has the darkest head I've ever poured - albeit somewhat uneven bubbles. Chocolate Mocha aroma, very nice. Thick creamy deep roasted flavor. A very moving moment. Hops asserts itself, beautifully balanced and deeply satisfying. This is what I'd hoped to experience with Rogue. Silky and velvety on the tongue and all the way down. Wish I owned a case or two. Extremely fine Brussels Lace. Rogue claims to use Imported Chocolate when making this brew and it must be said it is done with a restrained hand. It is the quintessential chocolate stout. A rare find."
"Pitch black in appearance, it has a small but continuing head. Upon smelling, a roasty cocoa aroma is quite evident. The chocolate was pleasant, went well with the roasted notes, but was not overwelming. This beer has strong bitterness that does not dominate, but works well with the roasty chocolate flavors. There is a pleasant finish. A very drinkable stout!"
"Medium bodied at best, packs a punch in terms of carbonation, which I suppose is for the better, otherwise, you might get sick of the burnt sweets. Not a bad beer, but it is really sweet. I'd like to drink this sitting around the campfire, in lew of eating s'mores. 22 oz. bomber does the trick for me."
"Overall - This one is a truly remarkable brew. If you do see this one, pick it up and enjoy it. It is worth it."
"Had on tap at Redbones. Pour was dark as night, low head dissipated quickly. Aroma was all about rich chocolate. I thought the taste was mostly dark chocolate with some roasted notes. A very nice and tasty stout that does exactly what was expected. Would get again, no problems."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Pours like motor oil. I am not exagerating at whatsoever. Thick and black, light absorbing, with the darkest brown head I have ever seen. Smells like, guess what? Chocolate! I work at a bakery and it smells just like chocolate hazelnut bagels. Sweet and smooth smelling. Taste is like many stouts, chocolate and coffee, but you can definitely taste the belgian chocolate (i think) that was used to make this stuff. I can't believe how much like bitter chocolate this stuff tastes (that is why i gave it a 5, it tastes exactly like the style it was shooting for). Very delicious dessert beer. Worthy of being ranked so high, and having the Rogue brand name."
"Notes: This is a dessert in a bottle and I'd take this over any actual dessert any day. A very smooth yet complex brew that is the epitome of a chocolate brew! Cheers!"
"Delivered with a nice head on top of a dark brown/near black brew. Chocolate and roasted malts scream out at the nose, and the taste buds are not disappointed. Bitterness tempers the sweetness excellently, almost like a mouthful of bittersweet chocolate. Hearty, smooth, imminently drinkable. Get it if you can..."
"Blacks as night with a thick head with a deep brown colour. Heafty brown lace around my glass. Smells of sweet malty chocolate. Blasted with sweet chocolate, then malt. Leaves me with a bitter chocolate taste. Very chewy, like taking a bite of a top notch chocolate bar. I could drink this everyday, all day, for the rest of my life. A 5 Star brew from rogue."
"This is a tasty brew, definitely drinkable, near perfect for after dinner. Rogue did a nice job with this one."
"This is an awesome stout that I will definitely buy again. TRY IT!"
"Not a fan of this beer. I don't like the overt chocolate flavor. I don't think chocolate belongs in beer...except Young's Double chocolate which seems to be much less overt in the chocolate department but I know they add chocolate to that beer. In the Rogue beer they add chocolate flavoring...tastes and smells like Nestlea Quik to me actually. Really quite an artificial tasting beer to me. The mouthfeel is quite thin too. Not quite sure how this is top ranked...#19???? better than Thomas Hardy's? Hennepin??? Celebration? Man...crazyness in my opinion."
"Drinkability: A rather delicious taste treat. Very smooth, but a stronger chocolate presence would be nice."
"Pours a dark, almost black liquid, with a tan foamy, almost creamy head. What a great smell of bitter chocolate, and roasted dark malt. Immediate taste is of the roasted malt, with good bitterness. Then it hits, this may be the best finish of a beer I have ever had. The finish is of a cocoa powder and milk chocolate flavor. Wow! This beer has just about anything you could ask for in a chocolate stout. Good mouthfeel, maybe not a great session beer. This is a good, special occasion beer. Another winner from Rogue."
"Pours a deep chocolate-black, opaque in the glass, with a 1"" frothy coffee-mocha head. Chocolate and chicory form the aroma. Not to be redundant, but the flavor is chocolate, with a nice bitter finish reminiscent of bittersweet chocolate. Even the mouthfeel is thick and creamy, like melted (say it with me) chocolate. All of this, however, is contained within the context of a very satisfying stout. You like chocolate? You like stouts? You'll love this. You probably wouldn't want to drink it all night, but as a treat or a desert beer, it's really good."
"An interesting chocolate offering from Rogue, especially for those who appreciate a more dry chocolate taste. This is something I'd likely have again. Smells simply fantastic!"
"I enjoyed my last few sips with a few hershey kisses lying around here - what a fantastic combination! Or maybe the taste developed because of the alcohol - I'm still not sure how much was in the bottle."
"I feel like Homer Simpson right now. Mmm.... Chocolate. The first smell after opening the 22 oz bottle was a bit hoppy with a hint of coffee, similar to the Shakespeare Stout. A deeper breath and the smell of Chocolate broke through quite clearly. When poured in a pint glass, it looked the part with an opaque brown body topped with a rough brown head. The taste is dominated by the presence of chocolate. Because of the strong flavoring, other tastes are a bit hard to distinguish. I can detect a bit of coffee, and burnt toast. Quite dry and a tad too harsh in the mouthfeel department, I think. It left me wishing for more maltyness and a smoother and sweeter body. This is definitely not to be chugged, but sipped and allowed to coat your throat and tongue as it goes down."
"on tap at isaac newton's: inky black with an increidibly dark brown bubbling head, that retreated for the most part. on the nose...oh man, what a nose...this had to be one of the best smelling flavored stouts i've ever come across....deep dark milk chocolate covered roasted barley smell. i can't stress enough how good this beer smells. a tad bit too much carbonation thins out medium body. hints of chocolate and smoke at first sip, followed by a massive roasted flavor and quite strong (for the style) leafy hop flavor. this beer smells alot more chocolatey than it tastes. a great sippin' brew, though i don't think that i'd want more than one in a sitting. a must try."
"Awesome. Pours out like a can of motor oil. Two inch dark brown head not unlike the top of a chocolate milk shake. Is this a chocolate milkshake...besides the chocolate aroma the touch of hops and strong malts tell me that this is in fact a beer. Taste is incredibly smooth. Big malts up front with a pronounced hop bitterness in the middle with a finish of sweet chocolate goodness. Overall flavor is almost of baking chocolate. This is the best chocolate beer I've had yet, and one of the best stout's to boot."
"Having had it many times over a few years, I find it amazing how consistant this beer is, regardless of whether it is served on tap or bottle. There is really nothing that the brewer could do with it to make it any more enjoyable. Great with a big slab of chocolate cake for dessert."
"Oh my! Simply put it doesn't get much better than this (from a bottle anyhow). Pours black as an accountant's soul with a burnt umber shard at the bottom. A luxurious, frothy cacao colored head that is tenaciously stubborn tops the brew and gives it a regal look. The smell is initially sweet like hot chocolate before moving onto more bitter, toasted notes of chocolate and creamed coffee. The taste is outlandishly appealing. Chocolate upon chocolate with the hops and alcohol more apparent when warmed. It is sweeter and more complex, not to mention more enjoyable, when allowed to warm a bit. It has a unique finish which is both green and creamy. Mouthfeel is great. Chewy, complex and mildly carbonated...perhaps slightly thin for the style. There is a lot going on here. Drinkability is perhaps a little too good. More?"
"Drinkability - A truly drinkable beer that has changed my mind about stouts. The chocolate and hop balance make this one of the better beers I have sampled lately. The creativeness of this wonderful brew makes me proud to be a beer drinker."
"Im not sure if a stout can look ant better that this when pouring into the glass. Pitch black in color with a large frothy tan head that has a slight cascading effect as it builds above the rim of the glass into a perfect dome shape. The head lasts a long time, slowly receding to a thick frothy lace. Lots of chocolate notes on the nose with a good amount of hops that seem earthy in nature. Some roasted and coffee notes also play in, but are intertwined with the chocolate character. This brew is huge in the flavor department and really hits my palate the right way. Roasted notes are far more apparent on the pallet then on the nose. Theres a subtle, slightly smooth start of semi sweet dark chocolate that is followed shortly after by coffee and roasted notes. A slight hint of milk chocolate comes in towards the middle, followed by and soft prickly carbonation. Good hop finish that is again a bit earthy, brings a nice balance. Roasted and coffee notes come back in the aftertaste and last forever, forcing me to draw the glass back up for another sip. Towards the end of the bottle, white sediment is noticeable as it collects on the bottom of the glass. The overall mouth feel is medium and is smooth, yet not quite so smooth due to the roasted notes. Despite this, the brew is incredibly drinkable. Im sorry to see the bottom of the glass, and Im even more sorry that I only bought two bottles."
"An outstanding brew....Exceptional appearance...black, choclolate creamy head, chunky and leving a beautiful lace. Smell...hops, chocolate, malt, a hint of coffee...all in their...definitely invites you to drink. Taste was initially slightly sweet, leveling off at mid palate and ending in anice hoppy burst. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and dry, almost astingent in the finish. A delight for malt, chocolate and hops lovers. Highly revommend."
"A most drinkable stout..nice"
"A thick pour; opaque, black beer. The head is dark tan/brown and crusty. Nice. Spotty lacing. The nose shows off plenty of dark chocolate but no possibility of hiding the Cascades. Yum. But the hops are almost confined to the aroma. The beer starts with sweet chocolate, travels through a thick, malty, chocolate base to a bitter, dark chocolate finish. This is a very tasty chocolate drink. The Cascades in the nose offset the chocolate a little, but I wouldn't take offense if somebody called this beer ""a bit one-dimensional""."
"Comes in a nice, 22oz bomber, damm skippy. Pours a black gold, a classical stout look with a good, meaty head. Smell is of malt and what else but chocolate. Taste is straight up solid. Much less of a burnt taste is there, though still quite active, this is the best brew to ever hit the chocolate nail on the head. Bold and very drinkable, one of the best chocolate stouts out there."
"This is dessert in a bottle! It poured a jet black color with a dark brown head that settled into a pillow of foam after about 1 min. The smell was all chocolate, just like sniffing the inside of a truffle. The taste was just amazing with a great chocolate sweetness and just enough hops to balance out the flavor. This is one that could be enjoyed with cake or ice cream or just by its self. What a beer!"
"What the hell was I drinking? Is this beer? Who cares? It was dark, with a chocolate head. It tasted like a good chocolate truffle, not a cheap one, but like a dark chocolate Lindt. It was so yummy, the perfect dessert! I find myself crazing this over cake or ice cream. Masterfull."
"Bomber bottle pours black as pitch with a thick, dark, tan head. The aromas are all chocolate, not the syrupy sweet milk chocolate, but a real good bitter dark baking chocolate. The taste is roasted malts and chocolate with a keen dry hop finish. The the cold mouthfeel contrasted nicely with the warm chocolate stout flavors. Dryness increased as the beer warmed. Good stuff, but couldn't see doing more than the one bomber."
"Dark pitck black. It's like looking into the nightmares of a child. Even the head is a dark tan color. But then it all becomes a dream. The everlasting chocolate smell brings me back to my childhood. It's like unwrapping a Symphony dark chocolate bar and getting that magnificent odor. The taste is purely chocolate also. you can feel it melt on your tongue as it goes down. No beer has ever brought me back to my preteen years, except Colt .45, but that is a different story. Another A for rogue. Good times."
"Very nice. Pours jet black with a huge tan head. Aroma is of chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate - also sweet malts. First taste that hits is slightly burnt malts, then some bitterness. So much chocolate. Dry with very little actual sweetness. Extremely smooth mouthfeel with just a bit of crispness. Somewhat oatmeal stout-like. All in all this is a great brew."
"Pours the colour of night with a light mocha head which sat and lingered like froth on a cappucino. Smell is of roasted malts and Chocolate almost like an Ovaltine gone Adult. The taste is of Roasted malts at first then the chocolate slides in and dominates, just enough hops come in to dry out the palate and keep everything in line. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth with the flavours lingering around long enough to keep the smile on your face. Drinkability is good although they could fill you up quick. Overall a killer Chocolate beer. I give it the edge over the Sam Adams Chocolate Bock because the chocolate character is more subtle and refined."
"A fantastic beer and a very unique flavored stout. I will definitely buy this again, even though it lightened the wallet a little."
"Pours with a thick darkish brown head. Quite black in color. The head is so meringue like that I take a bite of it. The head is like biting into the lightest, fluffiest, slightly sweet chocolate mousse. The aroma is strongly of chocolate, it dominates the aroma of this beer. Quite a creamy body, lightly sweet as well. This beer finishes with a bit of dark malt and a subdued bitterness. Just like the aroma, the chocolate is dominant in the taste of the beer as well. It is like eating a dense, rich, creamy chocolate dessert that is only lightly sweet. Very good, though I must say that it seems a bit one-dimensional."
"Pours a deep black with a thin, but lasting head. The nose is of chocolate and little spicy, perhaps cinnamon. The 69 IBUs are amply balanced by the malts. Chocolate and oats mellow it even further, although the hops may a play for dominance in the finish."
"Chocoholics, rejoice! I like chocolate, and I like this beer! No hints here, it is what it is, and that's a thick, rich, robust stout to make Willy Wonka proud. The heft and ABV limit this to mostly singular indulgences, but that one- OK, maybe two- goes down smooth and with gustatorial delight. Nestle's Quik has always been a down-home comfort drink for me. Now that I'm a big boy, this beer will take that role. In a nutshell, you'd have to HATE chocolate not to like this beer."
"This is a defining beer for the style. Rogue just keeps proving itself."
"650 ml bottle. Pours an opaque deep brown(almost black), with an honest-to-goodness light brown head that lasts and lasts, eventually giving way to ring and sheet cocoa lacing. Big aroma of chocolate, Irish cream coffee, and burnt smoky malts. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Carbonation doesn't bite, but it's there. Taste is chocolate, roasted and caramelized. Smokiness is noticeable. Cascade hops peep in, but the Dutch chocolate drives them away. Damn, this stuff has an overwhelming taste. I don't know how any other stout can claim to be a chocolate stout, standing against this one. Excellent product here, and I love it! Really close to liquid food."
"Intense flavor and heavy mouthfeel detract from the overall drinkability of this beer. The single 22oz. bottle was enough to leave me burned out on chocolate, and feeling stuffed."
"The mouthfeel is thick and full bodied. Subtle coffee and bitterness linger on the tongue behind the chocolate well into the aftertaste. The drinkability is knocked down a notch because after finishing the bomber bottle, I felt like I ate the several whole chocolate bars and I had enough for this sitting. I consider this a chocolate meal."
"I think I got a bad bottle or something, cause I got no choclate in this whole beer. The most I got was a heavy bite from hops, which I don't care for too much. I have had the Brooklyn Chocolate Stout and that blows this one away, as far as balanced out malts and hops, as well as taste. This one was way too hoppy for me and had little balance. I got very little malts in it at all, which was a huge let down. The best thing about this brew, for me, was the apperance. This is simply one of the best looking beers you will ever see. Nice head retention and super dark color. The color was so beautiful, I couldn't see through it, so that's a plus in my book. Other than that, this was below average, as far as chocolate stouts go. I couldn't finish the bomber, and that says a lot to me."
"Very easy to drink, the only problem is I think I'd burn out on the chocolate after awhile."
"Not a fault."
"Drinkability  A perfect nightcap. This would go well with burnt crème or crème brulee."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable... Willy Shakes gone Swiss Miss. Rivals Young's Double Chocolate, but a tad more bitter and not as silky smooth."
"$3.49 a bomber."
"Dark cola colored head was solid. The beer was dark as hell, light absorbing and whatnot. It reaked of chocolate, like a bottle of chocolate syrup. The body was middle of the road which is good because I didn't feel like actually drinking a bottle of syrup. The taste was all stout, not nearly as much chocolate as in the aroma, and a little bit of roasted malt. A good beer, very drinkable. I just thought the chocolate in the aroma was overbearing and a little artificial."
"Black motor oil stout with a huge rocky head that lasts for days. Huge chocolate aroma with a good hop backbone. The flavor is chocolate and coffee with hop bitterness behind. The finish is bitter chocolate and dry. Full body beer with good drinkability"
"Tasted blind at the 12/14/03 St. Louis BA tasting."
"One of the more disappointing Rogue brews I've tried. The taste on this beer is just not on mark for such a proud name. The slightly thin body provides a flavor that is just weak and quite short of stout strength. Dark as night, this beer had a small nondescript head and little lace effect. Truly short of chocolate sense as well, but long on a thin malt sense."
"Drinkability: Not at all excited about this one. Doesn't live up to the hype IMO. Won't try again."
"We tried this with a piece of ""Death by Chocolate"" cake from Greg's Restaurant in Providence, RI--making for a great combination. This stout definitely deserves its high ranking."
"Tastes exceptional. Not sure what the abv is on this but it seemed like a very drinkable beer. I will surely pick up a few more of these in the coming weeks."
"Im astounded at how much chocolate flavor and aroma is crammed into this beer. Its not a beer; its like a dark chocolate mousse that got liquified. Unbelievably drinkable; try to restrain yourself from guzzling it all before it has a chance to warm up some."
"Appearance: Ebony just barely letting any ruby highlights through at the edges when held up to the light, seems viscous with the pour and forms a nice sized milk chocolate colored brown head leves behind beautiful uniformed webbed lacing. Aroma: Hints of roasted marshmallows, deep milky chocolate, toasted nuts just one heavenly aroma barely letting some floral notes of hops. Taste: Ladies and gents what a beer, this one is definitely worthy of the Best of BA, with dark roasts blending with hop bitterness in the finish upfront the beer is full of toasted nuts and chocolate pleasure. Nothing compares to this one just awesome I like Brooklyn's Luxury Double Chocolate and Young's as well but this one kicks up a notch in the right direction. Mouthfeel: Full bodied almost chewy definitely pours like motor oil this is one big brew, awesome. Drinkability: Limit yourself to bomber this stuff is flavorful and full in body as lucious as they come an experience that I am going to enjoy for the next 30 to 60 minutes just sipping on it."
"This was a great dessert on Thanksgiving, too."
"This is definitely a beer that you will not want to serve too cold. It just got better and better as it warmed."
"Chocolate Stout pours pitch black in color with a huge tan head and great lacing. It smells of chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate. Very rich, creamy, and absolutely delicious. When I first tasted this beer I was amazed how they could pack so much chocolate into one beer. An utter joy."
"From the tap this beer poured out an amazingly rich and dark brown color with a huge creamy tan head. The aroma is rich with roasted tones and what else? chocolate. Theres no mistaking it. This beer incorporates the chocolate flavor into the beer perfectly. Sweet cocoa comes through along side a semi-sweet body of malts. Theres a hop bitterness hiding in there, also. This is a special beer."
"Jet black in appearance with a thick tan head. Aroma of chocoalate liquor. Taste is of dark chocolate, not overly sweet. A bit of a roasty quality reminds you that yes this is a stout you're drinking and not dessert. Thick, silky mouthfeel. Get's better as it warms. Excellent use of chocolate."
"Poured with a somewhat substantial chocolate soda head for a stout.Had a chocolately malt aroma a chocolate frosting first taste, with a pleasant not supersweet aftertaste.Mouthfeel was thick but not chewy got thicker and bolder as it warmed. For what it is its top notch, but to one dimensional to be placed amongst the top world beers."
"The mouthfeel is too thin for my liking, but I'll live. Drinkability: I'm pretty sure I could polish off two or three of these in a night. Good, but not as good as Shakespeare. But then again, what is? Rogue set themselves an impossible standard with that one."
"Compared to the draft version (see my review), the differences I notice in the bottled version are 1)There is a hint of nutmeg or ginger towards the middle...it's slightly spicier but in a herbal fashion, 2)The chocolate flavor and aroma is more subdued, 3) The mouthfeel is a little denser, silken and smooth, but not quite as soft. This is still my favorite chocolate stout, however the draft was a pure pint of heaven."
"Overall Impression: A smooth clean tasting beer with a chocolate twist. The chocolate is present, but not overwhelming, a nice counterpoint to a typically (for Rogue) delicious stout. There is more of the chocolate in the nose than the taste, but it’s all good. Makes me want to try more chocolate in my homebrews. Drinkability is great; I had trouble writing the review between sips, the nice dry finish invites another mouthful. Recommended, I’ll be getting more of this for dinner party desserts."
"rogue hits the nail on the head again. this is a damn fine brew. pours black as hell with a dark tan, foamy head that is oh so creamy looking. there is an obvious sweet chocolate smell that dominates with a bit of maltiness as well. it smells (and tastes) a bit like chocolate milk. the chocolate is more dominant in the flavour than the smell, which was maybe the only drawback for me with this beer...it was a bit too sweet at times. if that was toned down a bit, this would be that much better of a beer. very creamy and smooth, and just enjoyable all around."
"A big and thick black pour generates a decent and creamy tannish head that's slightly more even in color than Shakespeare. Nice intricate lacing properties. Aroma is too tipped toward chocolate to my mind, quite strong and unidimensional. Excellent body, mouthfeel, and proper carbonation. But like the smell, the malt flavors and sweetness leans too far to the chocolate side for my everyday tastes, just a slight coffee compensates. Just when you think this is going to be a Young's Luxury Double on steroids, the famed Rogue hopping balances very well and brings the close and after sensation about. A good beer for the right mood, it just lacks the slightly more masterful complexity and outstanding balance of Rogue Shakespeare Stout -- still the finest beer on the planet in so many characteristics. More than one pint of Chocolate Stout at a time gets very cloying for me."
"The pour was black and I couldn't see through it. Head was tan but pretty weak and faded fast. Nice lacing though. Smell was of a cocoa flavor. Taste was strong! Intense flavors came through. Lots of chocolate, but not really sweet chocolate, more bitter chocolate flavor. Another flavor was a woody flavor that complemented the chocolate nicely. Mixture of sweetness and hoppiness stayed balanced throughout. Very roasted feel in the finish. Medium carbonation and a medium to thick body here. Improved as it warmed. One intense beer."
"s.d."
"Eclipse black color. Large foamy tan head. Aroma is chocolate, touch of cardboard (but in a good way). A medium bodied stout. Malts are chocolate. Touch of vanilla and coffee. Hops are slightly spicy. Hops are slightly spicy. A nicely balanced sweet stout. The chocolate flavors predominate. Etched/painted beer bottle. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"I thought Young's Chocolate Stout was top dog in this class until I tried this. This has a dark brown color, a thick head, as with the Rogue Shakespeare Stout. I find the Chocolate flavor to be ideal, strong enough to know it's chocolate, but without tasting artificial or being overbearing as to ruin the stout taste. A thick, hanging, tongue-coating mouthfeel with an aftertaste that follows the initial coffee and chocolate flavors through. It is somewhat pricey, but after drinking many good stouts, this one is very memorable with the ideal amount of chocolate. Unlike flavored coffees that taste gimmicky or artificial, this is an ideal blend of stout and chocolate flavors."
"Like Youngs Double Chocolate Stout, its a bit gimicky. Sweet vanilla and chocolate flavour to start off with. The finish is quite roasty, with some bitter chocolate and then the mandatory hoppyness of Rogue beers kicks in. It had lots of flavour, and i quite enjoyed it, but i'm not quite sure it knew which direction it wanted to go. But...tasty. (Cask GBBF 03')"
"This brew pours a viscous black with a cascading tan head. Aroma is all roasted malts and baker's chocolate. Taste is a nice contrast between sweet and bitter with all kinds of chocolate flavors, milk, dark, and some coffee in the bitter finish. This beer redefines full bodied with an amazing smooth and creamy mouthfeel that reminds me of drinking some good homemade hot chocolate. This is one of those beers that reminds you that brewing is an art form."
"On second tasting a week or too later I had to lower my review. This is a suboptimal beer."
"This beer pours almost black. There was a bit of a dark tan head. The aroma is almost like taking a whiff of a Hershey's Bar. Definitely too much chocolate. The taste is pretty much the same. Chocolate bar is a glass. They have gone a bit too far with this one. It's not bad, but hard to finish more than 1. If I want a chocolate bar, I'd prefer to eat one!"
"Another spectacular beer from Rogue!"
"This bottled beer is one that I could drink exclusively for the rest of my life. And the draft is even better."
"Deep brown color with reddish highights, topped by a nice brown head that shows good retention as it slowly fades to a rocky layer of foam. Aroma is sweet, with roasted notes and good chocolate scents, but there's also a good hop component as well. The taste is very good, with sweet malt and dark chocloate notes surrounding a slightly fruity note. Then a great coffee flavor sweeps in accompanied by a blast of bitterness on the finish. The lingering aftertaste is a lot like eating dark chocolate cake with raspberries and then chasing it with an irish coffee. It surprising how much the chocolate flavors show through, as this is not a one dimensional beer at all. Much more chocolate than Youngs double Chocolate, and a heck of a lot more of everything else as well. This is one of those beers that I had passed by a few times, not wanting to pay the PA premium. But I'm glad I finally got a bottle last month. This is a great beer, truly deserving of its praise. Now if I could only get this much chocolate taste in a beer without the complimenting (and great) bitterness, maybe I could get my wife to have a brew. A must buy, worth the price you pay."
"22 oz bottle. Poured a pitch black, with a massive chocolate head that sticks around, and lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma of hops is there along with the roasted malt and coffee. Taste is Chocolatey good, lots of good roasted coffee flavor in there as well. This is one very good drinking beer. I could very easily sit and drink this all night! Rogue does it again!"
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick brown head that lasts. The aroma is rich and sweet. It smells like a chocolate bar. There is a heavy presence of dark malts, mostly chocolate. The taste is good, but a little too rich. There is a taste of roasted barley and chocolate malts. The mouthfeel is fine. This is a heavy bodied beer. It's well carbonated and very smooth. This beer drinks very well. Definately a good sessions beer."
"One of the best beers period, in my opinion. A must try for any stout lover. It is pretty much true to its name, but I'll describe my thoughts of the brew anyway: This one pours thick, and is a black hole of a brew. A nice thin, light brown head caps it off. Smell is chocolate and roasty, and...oh yeah, chocolate. Taste is exceptional.....very chocolaty, perhaps slight hints of coffee...but mainly chocolate, and more chocolate! A thick and smooth mouthfeel, easy on the palate. This one is a little thick to drink too many, but that's a good thing in my book. Nonetheless, I usually limit myself to one of these at a 'sitting'..........a delicious brew."
"At the brewery this stout poured a very dark brown, almost black, with a creamy tan head. The smell of chocolate is wat I can discribe as being outstanding. The taste was of a bitter/sweet nature and the chocolate flavor filled the mouth and palate. The finish was bitter, but, ""Oh So Good"" and very pleasant!"
"Those initial unpleasant flavors lowered this review for me. I'll have to try it again in the future"
"Granted this is a chocolate stout, but the chocolate is way too overpowering. A complex, well crafted brew, but the over the top chocolate and spices just aren't for me. It was like trying to drink a melted Hershey bar. I couldn't finish it."
"Wow what a appetizing beer,poures a ddep brown color with an off-white creamy head,the aroma is of biiter chocolate and powdered sugar.Flavor is malty sweet and of course...chocolaty nice and creamy tasting with a nice sweet finish.One of the better stouts I have had in some time."
"Looks like chocolate, smells like chocolate, tastes like chocolate. I almost forgot this is beer. This is good beer. Pours a beautiful opaque with very brown high head. The head even tastes like chocolate. Not sure if the taste is bitter chocolate bar or cocoa right out of the can!! I drank this at about 50-55F. Somewhat dry finish, yet creamy. The taste sticks around. No need to hurry. Enjoy.The only thing that held the score down was a momentary different taste right when you take a sip. Also readily available. Rogue Brewery is one of the top brewrys in the U.S."
"Drinkability - I enjoy fine chocolate as it is, Valrhona Noir Amer being one of my favorites, and Callebaut. This beer is so deliciously chocolaty I could sip it all night long. It's just too good to stay away from!"
"This is the desert beer. so sweet, but it retained all its stout like qualities and was never overwhelmed by the chocolate. Poured stout black with a ruddy tan head. The smell was initially dominated by sweet chocolates and was rounded out by mollasses and brown sugar. The taste was tons of meaty, deep smooth chocolates and caramel with a malty middle and a huge Rogue like hop finish with plenty of bitterness. Kind of like Shakespeare stout with chocolate."
"Overall I was impressed. I've had several Rogue beers now and have liked all of them, including the Hazelnut Brown Nectar and Dead Guy, but this one blew me away. Definately a beer first, but the chocolate flavor is definately there. Thanx to Liquid Solutions for this one, had to order it because I can't find it anywhere around me. I'll keep an eye out for it though."
"Excellent. As much as a chocolate flavor as any other, and a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness. This may be the best Rogue I've had. For once, the hops don't dominate. Nice body, appearance is as it should be. Good head retention, lacing throughout. Tastes like a Hershey bar. Had it along with Young's Double Chocolate, and I would give Rogue the nod."
"Thanks to weefisheads for the bottles."
"I had this one in a 22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black with 1 finger of dark tan head. There is just minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is rich in cocoa and molasses. There is a hint of hop aroma also. The taste is full of chocolate with some coffee and toffee undertones. It is exceptionally smooth also. The mouthfeel is nice and heavy, and just a little bubbly. The drinkability is also fairly good for this fine dessert beer."
"Pours ink black with a tall pillowy tan colored head that very slowly dissipates leaving spider webs of lace across the sides of the glass. Nose is milk chocolate and fresh cocoa and is very inviting. Full in body with a very creamy mouth feel. Taste is sweet roasted malts and dark fruit followed by tons of bittersweet chocolate with notes of unsweetened dark chocolate in the aftertaste. A marvelous brew and a perfect choice as a dessert drink. Thanks to Loki for the sample!"
"Truly a masterpiece of the brewer's art. A fantastic dessert beer, but seeing that I'm a BA and a choc-a-holic, I could drink this delightful concoction any time, anywhere.."
"Double your pleasure, Double your Black!"
"Black pout, huge broze head. The nose was chocolatey but not sweet. The taste was heavenly. Rich with cholcolate, both dark and unsweetened. A nice bitterness but not so much that it takes away from the chocolatley treat. Somewhat creamy. A nice rich finish that lingers long after. This is what a chocolate stout should be! A true classic of the style and of the overall beer world!"
"Medium-high body with decent, but not great mouthfeel. A beautiful chocolate stout and a chocolate lovers wet dream."
"Inky black liquid with a small, but dark mahogany colored head. The head doesn't stick around too long, but leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is distinctly of chocolate, with hints of vanilla and toffee. The chocolate flavor is just right - slightly understated, not overdone or overpowering at all, and it doesn't fight with the fine hop bitterness. Smooth and well-rounded mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable for a stout."
"Nice rich chocolate smell. Full chocolate cake with hershey syrup. Touch of hops present. Taste is rich full on chocolate goodness. Thick oatmeal stout feel and touch of oatmeal taste. Beyond smooth and creamy, into another level. Full bodied, rich chocolate flavors and a snap of hop bitterness, make it taste like bittersweet chocolate chips. One of the best beers I have had to date. Just plain incredible !"
"Dark Godiva chocolate brown and thick with a dark froth. Aroma is distinctly chocolate, roasted malt and a little earthy. Very smooth like most good stouts and creamy as well. Hop flavors are present but in the background and flavor is full. This is a very good stout and I'm continually impressed by the high quality brews from Rogue."
"Bottom Line: Another fine example of Rogue’s constant innovation."
"Better than most Chocolate Stouts but I am still having a tough time getting Chocolate and Coffee to taste good together. Don't get me wrong I liked this beer but I like a bit more stout."
"This beer is fairly rich in flavor, but not thick in flow. Easy to drink, and it has a distinct hint of chocolate, but it is slightly tart as though there are grapes or something hidden in the shaddows. Very enjoyable beer, but the aftertaste is very undesireable."
"Cheers"
"If you want chocolate, this is the beer. Quite tasty."
"Pours a deep opaque black, with a quickly diminishing small creamy tan head which leaves a minimum of lacing. Aroma is nice and full of dark bakers chocolate. Flavor is similar, with dark (maybe a semi-sweet) bakers chocolate being dominant, and a hint of hops bitterness in the end. Body is smooth, creamy, and slick. Goes down quite easy, great with desert, or maybe by itself for desert."
"Cheers to Sakaroo for the sample!"
"It's inky-black with a nice tan head that leaves lace down the glass. As soon as the smell hits the nose, you know you're in for a treat. Chocolate and oats with a fair dose of hops blend together very nicely, leaving you in serious anticipation of the first drink. As a chocolate lover, I'm certainly biased, but the flavor is fantastic. The chocolate is more akin to semi-sweet baking chololate than the milk chocolate commonly used in desserts. However, it does make a wonderful dessert beer. I enjoyed this after a big plate of spaghetti with Italian sausage and was ready to loosen my belt and take a nap. Chocolate and beer in almost perfect combination--this is life as it should be."
"Just awesome in every way."
"Pours a luscious black color with a thick dark beige head. Nice lacing as well. Aroma of chocolate and malt. Medium-bodied with a nice bitter dark chocolate taste throughout, along with malt and caramel. The finish is lightly hopped, but has a sweet aspect as well. I am surprised it took me so long to try this."
"Any technical knowledge I can pretend to fails me, and with a very good reason. This was the third, and largest, sample in my trio of chocolate stout tastings. I may have gone overboard..."
"Damn this is good. A large dark brown head on the pour, and the beer itself is black a coal, even when head up to the light there is no color change. As implied by the name, there is a nice taste of chocolate in this drink. Ive never had a chocolate beer before, so i cant compare to others, but if you run across this in the store i would definately recommend it."
"Opaque jet black. Brown, slowly settling fluffy head leaves spotty lace. Buttery, pure milk chocolate sweetness hits the nose at first, then is ceded by notes of carob and suggestions of chocolate covered candied orange peel along with coffeeish, borderline burnt roasted barley. Real chocolate never wavers in aroma, remaining constant and assertive. A joy to inhale. Snap of dark caramel sweetness is superceded by drying, pronounced hop bitterness and notes of unsweetened cocoa. Real chocolate is less assertive in flavor as the aroma would indicate, but persists throughout to underlay a smoothly bittersweet undertone. Roasted malted barley eeks in mid palate, lending a subtle smoky, carbonaceous charcoal impression. Overshadowed citrusy hop flavor struggles to add complexity. A touch light in body, with a thinnish, over attenuated mouthfeel saved by the oat glucans. Finishes with surprisingly pronounced notes of dark roast coffee and cream widening into a lingering hop bitterness. Rogue Chocolate is a delicious, rich stout. I prefer my Willy Shakes unadulterated, since the chocolate character muted the hop and roasted grain profile. A highly enjoyable treat nonetheless."
"I really like this beer and I think most people will agree with me!"
"A pretty dark stout color with a strong mocha colored head. The lace thin but very strong and stained the glass big time as I drank the brew down. Very nice to look at. Nose was (guess) chocolate, candied sugar, caramel nougat, and a little rum-like ester. All were appetizing to smell, but none were presented or combined in an impressive way. Taste was (guess) chocolate and candied sugar. Had a dry hoppy finish but of the bitter sort you'd find in good chocolate. Even better was its almost fruity espresso flavors in the middle of its flavor profile. The mouthfeel was thin with a fizz that came from the head and hops. A very straightforward beer but by no means boring and one of the better stouts out of the six famous and beeradvocate highly-ranked ones I've had recently. Simple and simply edible, this is a tasty stout I am welcome to return to. With a way too easy mouthfeel, and skilled brewing, its a beer version of milk chocolate."
"The was first taste of Rogues version of a Chocolate Stout and it wont be my last."
"Bought a 22 oz. bomber of this to help me get in the mood to study for me midterm tomorrow (something about that didn't sound right, hmm). Poured a oily jet black and produced a very large, very thick, creamy brown head - left lace all the way down the glass. The smell was dominated by cocoa, with small hints of roasted coffee. The first sip is always the best with any chocolate stout, and this one didn't let me down. Somewhat higher carbonation relative to others i have tried. The overall taste was of rich chocolate fighting with the hops for mouth domination - thats how i would describe it. In the end they both live in peace, blending into a bittersweet chocolate finish. And we all lived happily ever after - time to study."
"What can I say? The name says it all. Chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. It's like having a thin chocolate shake. It pours a dark, used motor oil black with a creamy tan head that disappears all too soon. The smell takes me back to a childhood of quaffing chocolate Carnation Instant Breakfast before rushing off to school. If only I had been drinking this instead, classes would've been oh so much more enjoyable. The flavors come in waves. First there is a quick, muted blast of citrus, then wave after wave of chocolate; first sweet and creamy, then bittersweet. The finish leaves you with a bit of roast barley bitterness. The moutfeel is quite smooth, more like a dry stout. Good Stuff, though between the two I'd choose Shakespeare Stout."
"Tried this stout thanks to Gusler. It pours a dark black colour topped by a creamy tanned head. Aroma consists of chocolate with hints of malt and coffee. Strong dark chocolate dominates the taste. An excellent beer. The only disadvantage is that it's a bit poor on the drinkability point of view. I wouldn't have more than 1 liter in one go."
"I like the beer - but I don't know if I could recommend it given that it's the kind of beer some might really dislike. The chocolate flavours are SO strong that it's almost not even a beer but rather some sort of chocolate desert malt beverage."
"Simply put.....EXCELLENT....I need not say more."
"Pours black, with a brown frothy head, at first dark, then a lighter shade. Settles into a Guinness-style thick table top. Aroma is rich chocolate. Oh wow. Taste starts off with roasted malt, a thin but respectable layer of hops, and finishes with enough chocolate to make you feel you had a melting Hershey's kiss in your mouth when you drank. And with signature oatmeal notes mixed in. Definitely an oatmeal stout at the bottom of this specialty. Thick, lush, and smooth across the tongue. Had this a couple years ago, and thought the chocolate was way over the top, but it is far more balanced now. An exceptional dessert beer / nightcapper."
"This brew was all black with very tan creamy head that diminshed into a thin layer with excellent lacing. This brew just looks creamy smooth. The smell is all rich chocolate with a slightly bitter tinge. The taste again is all chocolate, big surprise there, even though there is a lightly bitter finish which gives this brew an excellent balance. If it wasn't for the bitter end it would be too sweet. This is my new favorite stout, especially for dessert. I used this brew to top of a steak and it was excellent."
"I really didn't think that I would like this beer. I figured that it would be either too sweet, or just taste like a cheap, flavored beer. I should have known better considering this brew comes from Rogue. They did a great job of creating a mellow, chocolate stout without slapping you in the face with the flavor. Instead of seeming artificial, it just seems ""right."""
"Slick."
"Stick to the Shakespeare! I tried this and I must say that I don't like it. Stouts are some of my favorite brews, but not this stout. It's like Rogue took their awesome Shakespeare brew and spiked it will yucky chocolate. This tastes way too chocolate. There are other flavors going around in there, but the chocolate overpowers. I can see how some could like this, but I do not."
"I am definately running back to my store and buying a few more bottles to stow away for later...mmm"
"One of the better Chocolate Stouts."
"Rogue has found that secret passage that leads chocolate to beer and meshes them together so perfectly. I love this beer. Went to Andy's Corner in Bogota to hear that it was here, the first keg to hit NJ. Sounded too good to be true. Fortunately, it wasn't. This beer smells fantastic, has a great look and ""feel"" to it, pours with a great head and tastes just like heaven. Willie Wonka and Sam Smith couldn't team up to beat this beer. The only thing that keeps it from becoming a perfect ""5"? It's hard to drink many of them in one sitting. Be that as it may, a beer not to be missed!!!"
"I enjoy the stronger chocolate taste than say Young's Double Chocolate where I thought it wasn't strong enough."
"Rogue Chocolate Stout: In the 22 ounce bomber bottle. A very tall and fluffy head, looking like chocolate sponge cake sits above this absolutely black beer. Even held up to the light, nothing can penetrate this brew. The aroma is pleasant, smelling like dark chocolate. Wow, is that a terrific tasting beer! The beer does have some carbonation, but once the beer settles down, a range of very pleasant malt/chocolate tastes assaults you. In fact, if it is possible, I like the beer better after I’ve swallowed it, as the chocolate sweetness is full force, and is very tasty. I was very skeptical that this beer belonged in the top ten, but there is no question that this is a great beer. Thank God I let this beer warm up somewhat before sampling it, and you must too."
"I finally got my hands on one of these. They flew off the shelf at Palmers when they got it in. I was lucky to snag one of them. This beer poured black as the night and formed a huge foamy dark tan head the left an almost full coat of lace on the sides as is subsided. Okay, the aroma smells of malt and chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate. Coca comes out the the sweet chocolate to offset it a bit. The flavor was of malt, burnt chocolate and a touch of coffee. The finish was fairly light for this style and had a slight bitterness to it. I prefer this to Young's any day of the week"
"This was my favorite chocolate-containing beer (Brooklyn uses no chocolate in theirs). Much more assertive hop and grain flavors make this a more enjoyable stout than Young's IMO."
"459"
"Beer pours black as night topped with a creamy smooth, dessert-like tan head. Big time chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt aromas exploding out of the beer. Later on, the aroma reminded me more of a really nice chocolate milkshake. The flavor meets the expectation groundwork laid down by the aroma and appearance. CHOCOLATE! That's what this beer is all about. Dessert malt, coffee, and chocolate flavors with a great mouthfeel to boot. This isn't an overly sweet beer either, but nicely balanced. Next time I'm going to bust out some strawberries with this beer for an experiment in decadence."
"Gotta give props to ZAP, Budgood1 and Road Warrior for the combined effort to bring this beer to my presence."
"Of the Chocolate stouts I have tried, this one has the strongest chocolate taste, by far. The color is deep brown, with a brown head and no lacing. The smell hits from the minute you open the bottle - chocolate, hops, coffee. The difference with the smell here is that everything smelled fresh, I just wasn't just picking up scents, I was really smelling these things - strong. The taste was chocolatey, with more maltiness than the hops smell would indicate. The beer is really smooth, but seems low on carbonation. Overall, a great beer, but the sweetness and strength of flavor do lower my score for drinkability."
"This isn't perfect but it is very close...I still like Youngs a tad better personally but this might be a better made beer...Young's has a bigger chocolate flavor and has very little hop bite...this is more complex and should be a must try for Beer Coniseurs around the globe..."
"the beer is extremely rich and smooth with a wonderful full body and full flavor. dark malts and coffee flavors take over in the taste of this beer. you will get chocolate kicks here and there, but nowhere near what i had expected. i will say that let me down a little bit. the beer was excellent, but i want more chocolate."
"I was impressed with the fact that a chocolate stout managed to have a nice hoppy flavor in addition to everything else going on in this brew. The hops and bitterness seemed to hit me first, with some mild coffee flavors, then finishing with a great, mild chocolate flavor. This is a must have for any stout lover."
"If you're looking for a chocolate stout, this is your beer!"
"Black, with a huge, dark brown, creamy head that sticks around to the very end. Nice aroma of slightly bitter dark chocolate, with a hint of hops as the brew warms. Flavor is just heavenly. This is the most authentic chocolate flavor I've ever encountered in a beer, and it doesn't stop there. Taste develops into a nice understated roasted malt, and finishes with just enough hops to let you know you're still drinking a beer. Finish has a nice mixture of bitterness from three different sources: the grains, the chocolate, and the hops. Really pleasant. Sweet, full-bodied with a decadently creamy mouthfeel. A truly outstanding beer."
"Color was black (opaque) with a thick, rising brown head. Rich sweet chocolatey and malt aroma. Mouthfeel was smooth and very full-bodied. Roasted malt and luscious chocolate flavor dominates midtones. Natural chocolate used in brewing really sets this chocolate stout apart from others. Finish contains bitterness from the hops typical in most of the beers Rogue brews. That's about the only thing that was a slight turn-off. For such a sweet stout, I'm not sure the bitterness of the finish compliments the sweetness of the chocolate. Still it wasn't enough to detract from the overall great taste of this chocolate stout."
"I bet a cookie would go good with this!"
"Arguably I think most fans of chocolate stout would agree that this one is among the better ones. Coffee black color. Colossal head, very thick and textured, hang on until the end. Sweet chocolate aroma. Crisp roasted mat and chocolate flavors. Crisp and clean finish. A treat!"
"PS.. Do not drink too cold let it sit and it will improve as it warms. Complex and satisfying."
"Color is jet black with a thich creamy brown head that sticks to the glass. Aroma is of chocolate and more chocolate with milk and roasty malt in the backround. Rich and thick, full bodied and a wondeful creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is chocolate, lots of it and different kinds of tastes. Powered cocoa, dark, bittersweet, milk, and baker's chocolate flavors hit you at different times as you sip. Roasted malt and coffee-like taste is in the backround. Hops and bitterness makes itself known but balances nicely. The balance between them is mind-boggling. Would be interesting to try this at a lower IBU. An excellent stout, richness takes away from the drinkablity, but overall it is wonderful."
"oh man is this a killer! blacker than black in color, thick and rich, with a big dark tan head that stays forever. piney hops on top of chocolate in the nose. tastes of bitter and sweet chocolate with the usual cascade hop finish. the body of this brew is awesome...bold and heavy, yet silky smooth. how a beer can be so bitter yet oh so smooth is baffling. i'm having a hard time coming up with the right words to accurately describe this brew. so 'absolutely delicious' will have to do. a chocolate lover's delight!"
"Incredibly dark reddish-brown, as near to black as possible without actually being black. Nice brown head, but it doesn't last quite long enough. Still a bit of lace on top, though. Rich smell of lightly roasted barley, packed with chocolate. Flavor is rich and chocolaty. Combined with the hop bitterness, the taste is somewhat like semisweet chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel, oily finish with a lingering taste of bitter chocolate."
"Rogue's take at liquid Godiva, this is one excellent stout. Pours opaque with an impressive, sturdy tan head. Smell is big on chocolate with notes of caramel included, too. Taste is more of the same, with an onslaught of chocolate and a nice hint of Cascade hops along the way. Mouthfeel is chewy, smooth, delectable. For a full-bodied stout of its proportion, this stout is quite drinkable. It's one of the best dessert beers I've come across, and I suggest serving it by itself."
"I feel like Augustus Gloop sticking my nose in a river of chocolate, but I survive to take a draught of this rich and chewy brew and find myself in a world of balanced perfection. Pours Siberian new moon black with a gluey, frothy cocoa puff head. Like eating chocolate cupcakes on a cocoa plantation. It's sweet, no, it's bitter, no, hoppy? Oh no. How can a beer be so luscious and drinkable at the same time? A feast for the senses. Majestic!"
"Opaque and black, with a thin, but persistant head. Aroma of chocolate and spicy hops. Flavor began with bitter chocolate, became very slightly sweet and fruity, and finished with some underlying earthy hop flavors. Full bodied with low to medium carbonation... smooth and very drinkable. An very good flavored stout."
"Rogue Chocolate Stout was served jet-black with a rich brown head, of a good inch, wonderful lacing as I sipped away. This beer was way more robust than I was expecting. The flavors on the palate were a whopping dose of both roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. This blend added tremendously to the complexity of the Stout; then add in some hops for underlying support. The lack of sweetness was noticeable but not absent. The texture on the tongue was surprisingly creamy. This is a very, very good Stout every BA should try this one."
"This is one of the best Chocolate Stout's that I have ever had. Big, bold chocolate flavor that is like drinking desert. Dark as night with a creamy off white head. The rep from Rogue said that they use Dutch chocolate if I remember correctly. This is personally a beer that I probably couldn't have more than two of at one sitting due to the sweetness. I would like to try this out of the bottle but don't know where I could find it."
"Ah that magical pour of a well made stout, well heck the worst I ever drank was pert near good. Deep brown to black beauty with a gargantuan head that leaves a latticework of lace behind, the color a magnificent chocolate brown, with a creamy texture. Nose is bittersweet chocolate, coffee, roasted grains, and black patent malts, quite a Sniffer. Front is malt, lightly sweet, the top thick-bodied, the finish, joyously hopped, joyfully acidic, with a bittersweet chocolate dry aftertaste, la bière est magnifique. Ranks #70 on my current 1000 beer master list."
"I don't even care for chocolate that much, but I recognize a treat when I taste one. And this one is a treat. Easily the best chocolate stout I've had."
"2002 release. Thick black liquid decorated with a creamy, puffy dark tan head. Mouth watering! Stays well too. Bittersweet aroma of hops, cocoa, and dark chocolate. With a taste, first comes hop bitterness, then it evens out with some dark chocolate and roasted grain. Bitter in the middle, but really sweet on the edges of the tongue. Leafy hops in the back. It leaves that leafy character on the tongue as well, I like that. Very smooth and creamy. However, at the end of 22 oz. of this, it gets kind of cloying, so that cuts down on the drinkability. Rogue really put the chocolate in chocolate stout! Using real chocolate was a good idea. Great effort. Too bad this is only seasonal (or is it going year-round now?). Also, thanks to Rogue beers, it's easy for me to identify cascade hops now. I'm not usually a huge fan of cascades used in profusion, but they're nice in this one. Anyway, I definitely want more of this soon!"
"Aged 22 oz. bottle - well over a year old - surprisingly ""fresh"". Very, very dark brown with only minimally visible ruby highlights showing through. The thick, rocky, light brown head holds extremely well and leaves excellent ""spider web"" lace throughout. The aroma is fruity and sweetly chocolatey - very much like sweet cocoa powder. The body is surprisingly full, and givies a very creamy mouthfeel. The flavor starts fruity (raisins, berries), then becomes softly coca-ish, cereal-like and chocolatey as it warms, and finishes astonishingly long with a burst of sweet chocolate, a coffee-like roastiness, and a gently bitter character. A mild but distinctive Cascade flavor eventually emerges once the malt residue has subsided. Wow! Quite a finish. Absolutely worth trying. Easily the best ""chocolate"" beer I've ever had."
"(on tap, from notes at brewery) Nice jet black color with a thick tan head. Pretty strong chocolate nose.  Medium bodied with a very smoothe and creamy mouthfeel.  Like drinking a cup of alcoholic cocoa.  Very nice and enjoyable."
"Pitch black with huge, puffy, immaculate light tan head. Smells of chocolate (duh) and cream. Like velvet running down the throat. Malt bitterness and substantial hops abutted with chocolate creaminess into a brew that is not overwhelmingly chocolatey but hints of coffee and oats (one of the ingredients). Mouthfeel: velvety, creamy, magnificent, just shy of perfection by being a tad slippery. This is a great beer, as tasty as you would imagine, with only the herbal bitterness keeping it from reeling into the stratosphere."
"As far as flavoured stouts go this is one of the best, very well balanced and quite drinkable for a brew with such a big body."
"Truly an exceptional beer, and it makes for a perfect dessert on its own, or pair it with one."
"When they say ""chocolate", they don't lie.  This dark brown, heavy bodied stout was like drinking cold, hopped chocolate syrup.  It was awesome.  Probably the best desert I have ever tasted."
"We're not talking chocolate malt here - we're talking real chocolate.  I almost expected to see a half-dissolved Hershey bar clinking around in the bottle after I poured out the last of the beer.  Pour was thick and black, like used motor oil (only a stout lover could find this description appetizing).  Creamy and chock-full of mocha chocolate, like a chocolate creme soda.  I'm a fan of Young's Luxury Double Chocolate Stout, but Young's is no match for this chocolate monster.  My only ding against this Rogue is the drinkability factor.  A little of this beer went a long way for me, and toward the end the chocolate became cloying and just too much.  A great dessert beer."
"Rogue can do stouts and that's all there is to it. Not as good as the Shakespeare stout, but good. Stouts have a little dark chocolate flavor to them to start with and this one just accents that flavor a bit more. Good stuff."
"Wow, when Rogue says chocolate, they mean it. Spectacular brew."
