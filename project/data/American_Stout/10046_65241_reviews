"2.86/5: This voodoo is boring"

"Great smell, coffee, chocolate.  Initial taste is understated. Strong coffee chocolate aftertaste.  Otherwise very smooth.  Easier to drink than most 8.5% beers."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is dominated by roasted malt although it may be more appropriate to call it burnt malt, has a very bitter burnt flavor running throughout that controls everything, not sure coffee contributes much to the burnt bitterness since it's not overly coffee flavored but the bitterness is similar to a dark cup of joe, medium-low carbonation with decent stickiness, some cocoa peaks its head near the finish along with some sweetness after the burnt flavor wears off enough."
"Overall, this is tasty, but a little high priced at over $11 for a sixer. The 8.0% ABV is very sneaky."
""
""
""
""
"A very Pleasant smell. A thick rich tasting stout. Good flavor but not super complex."

"Roast, fruit, prune and chocolate on the nose with a suggestion of coffee. The beer pours a deep, dense mahogany with a thin tan foam cap that produces rich lace. The chocolate on the tongue begins like fine gourmet dark chocolate with 70 – 80% cacao then mid-palate hints of vanilla and caramel enter in with roast flavors dominating by the finish as chocolate flavors wrapped in a range of grain flavors linger long through the aftertaste. Finishes dry with a touch of roast astringency. Bitterness tastes as much from the roast and dark chocolate than from hops. Very creamy, chewy body with fine soft carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dry roast is the dominant flavour. some liquorice remains along with the coffee."
""
"Just a solid, big stout all around. The body is a bit thinner than most stouts like this but the flavor works out just fine with the texture. Heavily toasted nuts, burnt grains and bitter cocoa powder in a fine balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours almost pitch black with a normal head, lacing and retention. Light nose of chocolate and subdued roast over a sweet malt background with slight alcohol notes. As it warms, light dark fruit (plum, raisin) notes and molasses become evident. Medium body with a very slight creamy texture. Above normal carbonation with a nice effervescence throughout. The flavor profile is nice but not very complex or well balanced. It begins with a bitter chocolate flavor and sweetness that has a slightly burnt molasses character to it. The middle is effervescent and brings forth a light roast bitterness over a nice malt sweetness that has a molasses character. The finish is a touch astringent and leaves a slight alcohol burn at the back of the throat. As it fades, a slight note of hops is evident. Missing are the dark fruit flavors, body and smoothness that would propel this very good stout to outstanding."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light coffee, herbal, grass, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. A bit too perfumy on hops in the nose. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, herbal, grass, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good stout style. Good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Too sweet for my palette. Felt that it took away from the other features."

"Pours pitch black with a thinner deep tan colored head atop.Alot of dry roast and bitter chocolate in the nose,some sweet alcohol and dark fruit creeps.Dry upfront on the palate with an onslaught of dark fruit and molasses hitting midway,some drying comes into effect late leaving some residual dark fruit notes lingering.Not a whole lot of chocolate although it's there,there is a good amount of roast and dark fruit flavors,not to mention alcohol."

"A solid offering from Left Coast, a brewery I have never tried before now. Pours a thick dark black with decent tan head that dies down to a nice pool of tan foam with clinging lacing. Smell is of chocolate, coffee, and dark deeply roasted malts. Taste is bitter bakers chocolate and coffee up front with a hop bitterness on the back. Thick mouthfeel with an almost grit to it from an overload of cocoa. Solid beer but not exactly what I am looking for in a stout, still very happy to have tried it. Will try again later and see if tastes have changed, though I doubt it."

"Overall: Giving this a 4. I do love a nice pitch black stout. Pretty tasty."

"Most of the stuff from Left Coast that I've had is a bit rough around the edges. Never bad, just not crisp and sharp, always little things keeping it from scoring better and this is no different. It's a good beer and something I'd happily drink again."
"Poured a deep, rich black with a one-finger tan head that left slight lacing. It looks like a good American Stout. Scents of rich roast malt, roasted black coffee, dark chocolate and cocoa powder. An excellent, true to style aroma profile for an American Stout, but not standout. Flavor begins with rich roast malt, slight black coffee and some toffee sweetness. Moves into a more aggressive roasted malt flavor, more roasted black coffee and more toffee with some cocoa and dark chocolate and molasses in the background. Finish is of roasted black coffee, bitter roasted malt and bitter cocoa. A good, yet standard American Stout flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with light carbonation and a smooth feel. True to style, no complaints. Overall this is a good, very true to style American a Stout, not fantastic but still a good drinking beer with a nice aroma."
""
""
""
""
"While not rich and large like most stouts, quite flavorful even for a wet body. Nice fun beer."
""
"Looks fairly blackish on the pour. Smell is of sweet roast barley, coffee, sweet cream and chocolate. Taste is basically the same as the nose, but a real milk stout feel going on. Very delicious and certainly will be bought again."
"This is an accomplishment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A tasty, well done stout, very easy to drink."
""
""
"The color is rich and dark. The head is thick too but it dissolves quickly and the lacing is mediocre. It's smooth and light in the mouth with less coffee-bitterness in the actual flavor than the aroma. Wouldn't mind a stronger hint of malt or nuts. This is one that tastes better when fresh compared to others that even out their flavors after sitting a bit. I enjoy it and could make a night of it!"
""
""
""
""
"Poured a black body with minor head on top of an aroma that is thick of roasted malts, bordering on coffee at times, touch of dark chocolate. Simple, not complex stout, but pretty tasty and enjoyable. Chewey, slightly sticky body that is a little boozy and has some minor chocolate sweetness and a whole of roasted malts although not picking up a hint of coffee as I did in the aroma. Goes down nice with no problems and is a fine beer to have."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a very dark brown, almost black coloring with a thin, sparse, light tan surface coat of head. Aromas of subtle coffee, cream sweetness, chocolate highlights, and hints of vanilla. Smells great! Flavors are smooth and creamy initially, with a solid blast of roast and bitter coffee in the backbone. Extremely balanced, with a smoothness as it travels over the palate. Light bodied, but it never loses that smooth touch, transitioning to a roasted and more heavily bittered coffee aftertaste. The finish is bitter and dry, with a roasted linger. Solid beer, and the light body makes it very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall nice little stout, defiantly worth trying but not kick ass enough for regular consumption."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A really well done stout, just wish it had a better mouth feel. The taste pretty much makes up for it though and despite it's flaws, this one gets it more right than wrong. I'll buy again."
""
""
""
"O: An excellent example of the style. I love a good Imperial Stout."
"Overall- Above average to good, but mostly good beer. Does nothing that really stands out but has no flaws and is very accessible. I would give this a try and I might buy it again."
""
""

"Overall it's pretty tasty."
""

"Pours a luscious dark black hue with a creamy one finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is dark roasted coffee,chocolate malts,milk chocolate and a slight herbalness,the mouthfeel is full bodied and slightly carbonated and the tastes are dark and milky chocolate mixed with dark espresso and finished with a mix of roastiness and herbal hoppiness and overall a great drop that I could drink alnight a classic dessert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid example of the style, but not balanced IMO. Glad I tried it, wouldn't turn it down if it were offered, but would choose something else myself."
""
""
"O: maybe a little too sweet for me as a stout, but that's a possible upside for others. Most of the sweetness quickly disappears in the finish, leaving toasted wood and coffee."
""
"Overall: This stout is pretty solid. Very decent roasted malt flavors with a nice touch of bitter chocolate. If complexity you're looking for.. this one is a little tamed, just to the point stout. The aroma for me is the highlight on this brew. I thought I was baking a German Chocolate Cake while brewing some morning coffee. This is very drinkable for being 8.5% abv. This one just doesn't scream excellence to me (IMO). This brew is worthy."

"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twenty-two ounce brown glass bomber with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
""
"Served in a tulip glass from a bottle. Pours black with a small head a very little lacing. The aroma is of roasted coffee with some chocolate. The roasted malt flavor enhances the mouth feel and taste. I was just expecting more depth. A well done stout."
""
""
"From my tasting notes: This beer was big and robust that poured a deep black with a decent fluffy head. The taste was outstanding with loads of sweet malts and a big burnt chocolate, bitter dark chocolate flavor that sustained itself nicely. The full creamy mouthfeel kept this substantial brew thick and satisfying. The Voodoo Stout was a fantastic stout and one I would drink again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: fairly average stout. all the flavors work well together, and it tastes good. its warming, but theres no hint of alcohol in the flavor. still though, pretty average"
"Very pleasant coffee and malts up front but, there is a bitter aftertaste that I find a little unsettling. Still, not a bad example of American stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Voo Doo pours a black color with a small but lacing head. There is a smokey aroma with strong coffee and roasted notes. The taste is much the same, lots of roasted and coffee flavors. Good and full bodied, and flavorful. Overall a very nice enjoyable stout."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty drinkable. Run of the mill. Somewhere between stout and export stout, not really my thing."
""
""
"O: A very good stout, one of my personal favorites up to this point. Will definitely drink again if the opportunity arises."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like it. The earthy note isn't where I like my hops, but there's nothing wrong here. It's well made, the coffee and chocolate notes are pretty far in the background. Left Coast knows what they are doing; recommended."
""
""
""
""
" It's a good beer, one I would drink again if it was poured for me. Not one I would go out of my way to order or buy, unless it was on sale. Not bad by any means, but really doesn't hit my ""world-class"" mark."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid stout to drink for a while but there are better alternatives within the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would try one more, as I thought it was a bad batch. Glad I split one beer with two other people."
""
""
""
""
""
"drinks well for 8+"
"Overall: A pretty solid stout. More like an imperial stout with a pretty rich and roasty profile."
""
""
""
"O - It's a good middle of the road stout. Nothing fancy here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The voo do stout is a decent stout from left coast the beer poured a deep opaque black with minimal ecru head that is not lacing. The scent carries roast and espresso. The taste is powered by espresso with warming essence of alcohol. The mouthfeel is full bodied with subtle carbonation. Overall a very decent stout."
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoyed this beer. It is a reasonable price, and has a very unique taste. I will have to buy it again."
""
"Overall - Good, solid stout. Nothing truly noteworthy, but I'd have no problem drinking it again if there weren't better options available."
""
"Good average stout, something I would recommend to a beer drinker that is just starting out. This would be a nice mellow introduction to the style. I wouldn't recommend this for anybody who looking for something complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good beer. I don't think it's super unique, but nonetheless a solid beer. Definitely recommend trying it."
""
"The taste was perfect and the rest of the beer supported it well."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Seems to be between a regular stout and an imperial stout. Alcohol is very well hidden. I;m taking off a point because it's a bit pricey and I could spend 1$ more for a much better imperial stout. Grab this if you can get it for cheap. 3/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fairly one dimensional stout that only delivers if you’re really into bitter, roasted malt flavors. It’s drinkable but not much more than that. I’ve had several Left Coast beers now and I’m just not very impressed by them."
""
""
"No date on the bottle, but comes off fresh enough for my liking, don't know that age would improve this one too much. Another solid beer from Left Coast, would buy again at the sub $5 price tag."
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, char, and some slight cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"Decent stout, smells and looks great, nothing really special though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There are so many great stouts out there that the Voo Doo is middle of the pack at best. All stouts pretty much look the same, so lets move to aroma. There was an odd chemical component to the Voo Doo aroma, which was a low point. Flavor was ample in chocolate and vanilla, but dry and rough around the edges. An OK beer overall, but with so many other wonderful stouts to drink, I will not reach for a Voo Doo again."
""
""
"A good stoudt to be had."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is full of chocolate and heavily roasted malt, with a little bit of cream thrown in. The flavor is similar. There is a lot of roasted malt and a hint of smoke, along with a ton of chocolate. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice, straightforward stout that is easy to drink."
"D - It is what it is, a solid but unexceptional American stout that probably lingered on a shelf for too long for its lower ABV to warrant. Probably wouldn't bother revisiting this even if I could find a fresher example - shame on Left Coast for not bottle dating."

"DOA"
"Overall, I think this is a good stout, and I would not hesitate to get it again"
""
"Overall I would get it again but I'm not in a rush."
"Did I mention burnt? A liked this a bit more than I did."
""
"D - Next, please. Sorry."
""
""
"22 oz bomber pours a opaque black with huge lovely head. Aroma is dark roasted malt and alcohol. Taste is coffee, slight chocolate, licorice and alcohol. Creamy but thin mouthfeel is lacking that strong bite you expect from stouts. This one got better as it warmed, but overall weak flavored."
""
""
""
"""Let's see this beer is roasty and uh... roasty with some roast up front and then ... hmm... roasty."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark, intimidating appearance, and a nose of burnt coffee and dark chocolate. Flavor is basic, but again, burnt coffee, unsweetened chocolate, earthy malt. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"If this what an American stout taste like then F*ck American stouts.. no really this beer gives America and stouts a bad name. I Am a big fan of the stout but this beer taste weird like f*ckin play-dough. Avoid at all cost don't be fooled! try any other stout but this shit!"
"O: Very roasty, but an average stout. Easy drinking and smooth. Love the bottle art."
""
""
""
"Not bad, nice enough, but not quite enough omphhh. User friendly. But not knock'em, sock'em robots."
"Overall: Those well-roasted black patent type malts just always seem to bring a bit of harshness to the beer, which I'm never too enthusiastic about. Still, it's a decent enough stout."
""

"Drinkable but hardly sessionable at 8.5 ABV."
"My bottle says 6.8%. It drinks more like an Imperial, however, so maybe it is 8.5% as stated on the Left Coast website."
"O: A decent stout overall. The flavor fades a little too quickly for my liking, and I kept reaching for more to keep the ride going."
"Thick, rich, malty, with some punch, and the consistency of motor oil. Very good; what a stout should be. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a stout glass; forms a thick head that dissipates reasonably quickly. This stout has a decent aroma and a creamy mouthfeel and a certain tanginess that may not be to everyone's liking, but that I enjoyed."
"O - Pretty decent stout, worth a try and would drink again in the future."
"Pour a deep, dark brownish-black leaving a thick and dirty looking layer of head... immediate notes of chocolate and coffee beans...which brings us to what happens in the palate... coffee is definitely present, along with a bitter dark chocolate... somewhat a creamier beer that was a touch thinner than russian imperials that I've enjoyed in the past... Overall though, a pretty decent offering..."
"overall- a decent stout with hints of chocolate. A very basic stout. Nothing extraordinary."
"O - Pretty basic stout, but strong in alcohol; a little one-dimensional; worth a try though for stout enthusiasts"
"Overall a very nice stout! The smell promises more than the taste delivers but I will buy this again."
"This is a good example of a taste doing a complete 180 from the smell and appearance. First sip brought forth an extemporaneous 'hmmm...wtf is this?' Nearly all of the sweetness disappears and the roast is a bit excessive. Hops are flavorful and even a bit resinous, so if that is your thing this beer might be for you. I prefer my stouts creamy, full and on the sweeter/chocolaty side...this one does not manage to capture any of those adjectives. Not that it is all bad, I'll still finish the bomber fairly easily, but I wont buy this again and in a loaded style category, it pretty much falls flat on its face."
"This beer has a killer looking bottle. Was bought for me as a birthday gift. I split the bottle with the friends who bought it for me. The color was black and had a sticky lacing down the glass. The smell of the set was very minimal, just a light roasted aroma. The taste was roasted with some burnt malt flavors. The mouthfeel was pretty smooth has a little thickness. Overall this beer was pretty good."
"Dark black, pours with a small brown-red head. Smells of roasted coffee and come chocolate and the taste follows through on that but gets a little unbalanced and overbearing. It's a bit heavy to handle, though I'd like to try it again and revisit it."
"Beer is creamy and buttery in a bad way with chocolate and strong coffeeish roast. Something went wrong with an otherwise good beer. Interesting, overall but it seems to have diacetyl problem. Fix it and I'll have ti again."
"Overall: This stout left me underwhelmed. I was looking forward to something with a bit more heft on it and was disappointed. It was just too watery for my total enjoyment. Maybe I had a bad bottle or something happened with it being shipped over seas, but I would probably never buy another bottle of this. Sorry Left Coast, but I gave it a shot."
"Not a very good experience with this particular brew."
"Pours near black with a short mocha head and a moderate amount of spotty lacing as it goes down. The nose brings a good amount of chocolate along with some coffee and a fairly-strong roast component. The flavor has the same characteristics, but also has the unwelcome addition of diacetyl, which isn't overpowering, but does a good deal to kill the flavor profile of the beer. Medium body with a fairly-dry finish."
"D - Very good! The beer is simple, straight-forward and delicious. I'd love to have on tap."
"Thanks, chief."
"This was a fairly decent stout, not perfect, but very drinkable"
"Overdone on the malt-in-your-face. This is comparable to a scalded French roast: cheap, bitter but drinkable, and a potent delivery vehicle for your favorite legal drug."
"D: Very smooth. If you gotta have big well-toasted malts, its spot-on. It does get tiring."
"If you find one of these bottles, split it with a buddy. Worth the try since it's limited and inexpensive."
