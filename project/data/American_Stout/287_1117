The taste was bland and it took forever to drink. One beer took me about 45 minutes to suffer through. I'm a big fan of Bell's brewery but this beer is simply pathetic. I would suggest avoiding this beer at all costs. It's simply not worth the time to drink it or the money to pay for it.","Grant_Satterthwaite","Mar 30, 2015"

The aroma is light roasted notes with a little alcohol sweetness. The taste is very good but not particularly complex, with a deeper roasted tone and maybe a hint of chicory.

Rich heavy medium body with a nice creamy texture.  Below average carbonation with almost no effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is balanced, but lacks the complexity found in world class stouts.  It begins with chocolate, fades to roast and flows into a mild sweetness with a licorice note.  Hops and roast create a slightly bitter middle with just a hint of coffee and NO dark fruit.  The finish is slightly astringent.","tillmac62","Oct 10, 2014"

The aroma is of chocolate, coffee and licorice with roasted malt. Very nice smell of the mixed flavors! Lots going on with the taste as would be expected. Not overpowering though. Perfect amount of carbonation. Very pleasant overall and would rate this a good solid '8' if not a '8.5'.","BeerWithMike","May 13, 2014"

It pours a very near black mahogany with a small tan head that leaves a great film and lacing. The nose is a robust blend of coffee, chocolate, black licorice, and dried fruit. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth yet still quite light for a stout. Definitely very easy to drink. The flavor is as deep and complex as the nose with the addition of a wonderful tobacco note and a chewy bitter finish that lasts long after last sip is taken. Sure I'd love to drink Founders Breakfast Stout, KBS, Big Bad Baptist, or Black Note every day but it's not available everyday, nor could I afford it. So I settle for this delicious and much more accessible stout. Pick up a six and enjoy.","lochef81","Apr 28, 2014"

The smell is pleasant and very bold. Tastes of rich dark malts, has a heavy coffee malt flavor for me. It's surprisingly dry which really is a nice addition for the mouth feel and drinkability of this beer. It's the first i've had that i'm aware of brewed with brewers licorice. I can't taste it and I do enjoy licorice so I guess i'm slightly disappointed I couldn't pick it apart in that regard from any other dark stout. I picked it out thinking it would be a bit more unique. But if you're a dark beer fan chances are good you will like this beer. You can never go wrong with Bell's.","MIchelle","Apr 10, 2014"

Nice light brown head that lingers and a lace that clings to the glass nicely. Nice smoky sweet aroma that is balanced by some maltiness and clean bitterness in the nose. The taste follows the aroma, very coffee bitter like with some dark chocolate and burnt wood flavors. Some deep fruit notes like raisins or plums, but only slight. There is a little hop bitterness that hangs out on your mouth with the burnt flavors to make a very pleasant aftertaste. Not groundbreaking, in my opinion, but a solid stout.","cambabeer","Jan 27, 2014"

It wasn't till I got home that I realized it was brewed with licorice. I've been a huge licorice fan since my childhood. It poured dark and silky into my glass. A nice coffee scent with just a hint of licorice. The taste was the same with very light carbonation. A great stout. I will definitely get this beer again!!!!","AUGRAD06","Jan 15, 2014"

There were dark fruits, a little coffee, chocolate, and licorice in both the aroma and taste. All were on the lighter side except dark fruity sweetness and a sourness on the back end I didn't particularly care for. Mouthfeel was light with little carbonation.","tmm313","Nov 24, 2013"

It's got a good reputation, and it's one that is well earned. Bell's continues to impress me, and having only recently (a couple of months ago) moved to within their distro, I look forward to the continuing education in their zymurgical endeavours.","kemoarps","Nov 17, 2013"

Just a mild roasty flavor with little hoppy bitterness. Has a chewy mouth feel with minimal aftertaste. I enjoyed this one. And at less than $10 for a 6 pack, this could one of my seasonal favorites.

There was a little bit of roast, however. The flavor was little sweeter and a little less dry than I'd expect from a non-imperial stout. At 6% abv, it is a little stronger than some traditional stouts, but I still felt like a drier and more roasted profile would be better. I saw that they added licorice to it, so maybe this has something to do with it. I'd definitely have this one again, but there are others that I like more.","Smoke","Aug 24, 2013"

Very minimal fizzy tan head which fades to nothing rapidly; not sure how much it would have given even if she'd poured it more vigorously. Smell is dark roasted malt, gentle licorice, toffee and chocolate. Taste is dark, bitter roasted malt. Coffee, and a very slight (probably psychosomatic) hint of licorice. Hint of some hops at the end. Not much of the sweetness suggested by the smell; very roasty. Mouthfeel is surprisingly fizzy for the lack of head; overall medium-thin. Almost porter-like, if it weren't for the strong flavors.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Aug 15, 2013"

Pour was a fairly uneventful motor oil with a tiny mocca head a minimal lacing and retention. Smell is of dark malts, burnt chocolate, coffee and some carmel. A decent smelling stout. Taste follows the nose, but I pick up more of the coffee and a slight metallic finish. Some chocolate and licorice come on at the end. It's a pretty bold tasting stout and a bit too much on the burnt end for me. Has a smoky quality as well. Feel is nice and creamy. Not a ton of carbonation and I do like the silk quality on the end. Overall- It's a pretty good stout that was enjoyable. The metallic finish was a bit disappointing and I wanted more of the chocolate and less of the burnt coffee. Better than average, but not one of the best i have had. Would like to try another that is more fresh. Will give this another shot. It's worth the try-","TheDinger","Nov 25, 2012"

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Kalamazoo Stout pours solid black, with about two fingers of dark tan foam rising up and filling whatever empty space there was in the glass. Head retention is very good, and there's a decent amount left sticking around the glass. The nose has plenty of coffee, but it's on the sweet side rather than dry, black coffee. That sweetness comes together on my palate as a healthy dose of caramel right up front. Roasted grains come in next, with coffee featuring much more prominently than chocolate. There's a very subtle flourish of licorice in the finish which adds to the beer nicely. The body has some sturdiness, but ideally I'd like it to be just a little bit more full. The carbonation does an admirable job of largely staying out of the way and letting the malt shine. I'm usually a fan of Bell's beers, but the other stout I've had from them (Expedition Stout) wasn't my favorite, so I didn't know what to expect when I opened Kalamazoo Stout. It's an admirable American Stout though, and one I'd welcome in my glass again.","axeman9182","Aug 20, 2012"

The body is a little bit lighter than I was expecting, but the zip from the licorice adds a uniqueness that keeps the mouthfeel at a 4. I kind of expected a little bit more (probably unfairly) just because it’s Bell’s, but this is definitely a good and drinkable beer.","BlackBelt5112203","Jul 15, 2012"

Taste is more sweet than bitter, fruity up front, some roast not a lot of coffee (compared to Java Stout) in the middle, licorice towards the back-end mild resin bitterness in the back.

Taste of big milk chocolate, coffee, caramel, roasted malt, pine, herbal hops, and a bit of spiciness. Good amount of bitterness on the finish with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, pine, and herbal spiciness for a bit. Very robust flavors for 6%, with great balance.

Instead, it's a humble 6%, as much carbonation as is needed and doesn't have an overabundance of licorice, so you can actually drink more than one without being weighed down by unnecessary alcohol and intense flavors.

3.9,-2,4,4,4,3,4,"I think that this has a lot going for a nice stout. Very drinkable and a great session-able brew for a stout. The smell is of chocolate and slight coffee and nice roasted malt. This is a bit slick on the tongue and didn't quite have the body that i would have liked. Light tan head with a bit of carbonation that seemed to be a nice tickle on the way down. I think that for me this just needed a bit more body to it and maybe a bit more alcohol to back it up. I do understand that this is not an RIS but i guess im spoiled.

4.04,1.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Kalamazoo stout pours with a deep black color with a nice tan head which quickly dissipates to a thin lacing on top of the beer. Aroma is very good. Lots of coco, roast, can get a touch of earthyness, and a very mild caramel note. The flavor is nice, but falls a bit short. The creamy chocolatey character that the aroma had gives way to more of a patent malt burnt roastyness with a bit of an earthy chalky coco flavor which is nice, but not as great as the aroma. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. Not much creaminess, a bit sharp with a good level of carbonation for a stout. For me this is closer to a dry stout than a regular stout, but it is damn good anyway.","Agold","Oct 28, 2011"

I am not getting licorice in either the smell or taste. A mild roasty bitterness quickly fades from the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a nice bubbly mouthfeel.

Color was solid black with zero light penetration. Nose was very smoky and charcoal-ish underlain by a dark chocolate scent.

Poured with a rich beige foam that slowly reduced to a nice cap that leaves a few sticky lacings on the glass. Roasted and chocolate malt aromas. Smells creamy too. Thick and resinous feel in the beginning, and creamy smooth toward the finish with rich carbonation. Dark roasted and chocolate flavor up front with dark malt flavors transitioning to a lightly burnt malt flavor into the middle. Hop bitterness then comes alive with pleasant herbal pine character that intensifies from the middle to the end. Dark maltiness also carries through to the end along with hints of black coffee and a dry finish. Leaves you with a light herbal pine bitterness that lingers for a while.","IronLover","Jul 18, 2011"
2.92,-26.6,3,3.5,2.5,3,3,"O: Not the best showing from Bells, but I'd say licorice is a hard flavor to balance in a single style stout. There's no real bite to any of the flavors, and that's something that really bothers me. As someone that is really quite the flavor fiend, I can't help but feel frustrated by a strong flavor ingredient being subdued by the nature of the body feel and complimentary flavors. I just don't understand why they'd bother with licorice if it ends up being so dissonant in such a light bodied stout. Perhaps this used to be a classic, or even one of the breweries first beers; but it really feels like a novelty. Just because an ingredient should work on paper, doesn't mean it works in execution. Go big and imperial with your licorice, or risk being a dissonant and imbalanced single stout.","Cavery","Jul 15, 2011"
3.03,-23.9,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"O: Glad I tried this and very happy to try some bells things, but this was pretty mediocre. Volume definitely needs to be turned up on the flavors and their development.

Color is a 30 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is intriguing, with aromas of licorice, currant, honey, coffee, coco, and lemon peel. The taste, well was not quite a full and robust as I thought it would be, lots of flavor, but not so intense to knock my shoes off. There are flavors of coffee, coco, anise, molasses, charred oak, celery, grapefruit/lemon/pine, and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and has some pop from the carbonation. A bit of drying/stickiness on the sides of my tongue and back of my soft palate.

4.25,6.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O - I strongly dislike licorice, so I was a little hesitant picking this up but I'm happy to report I'm not picking up any licorice at all. The bottle says this is brewed with ""brewers licorice"" - I'm not entirely sure if brewers licorice has a completely different flavor profile than your standard old school licorice, either way, I'm really enjoying this. The flavors are bold and straightforward, not any complexity, but this is exactly what I'm looking for right now. A great stout for a cold winter night, or in my case, a humid thursday night.","drewba","Jun 02, 2011"
3.7,-7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Poured almost black with a huge light brown rocky head that lasted throughout and had excellent lacing. The aroma was of burnt cereal malts, a leathery yeast with notes of molasses, chocolate and coffee. It tasted mildly bitter and acidic in the beginning and finished with a sweet/bitter coffee flavor that stayed with you for an average length of time. Mouthfeel was full in body and creamy in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall a pretty basic stout.","CuriousMonk","May 27, 2011"
3.7,-7,3,3,4,4,4,"Overall/notes - Frankly, this beer does all of the important things right. ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" has never been truer. Maybe the dark chocolate helped it taste better than it really was, but... no. No, I just liked the beer. Another strong one from Bell's.","bbkd3b","May 26, 2011"
4.2,5.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I have had my eye on this stout for a while and I picked up a single recently during my last trip to Save On. I poured the 12oz glass into a snifter glass to find a deep black body with a tan, one inch head that left no lacing around my glass. The aroma was great with hints of dried fruits, roasted malts, coffee and hints of chocolate. The taste was great, the chocolate and coffee flavors are there like you would expect but they way the licorice is worked into the flavor its great. The beer is a bit on the heavy and chewy side but mellows out nicely and is enjoyable to drink. The carbonation and creaminess of the beer and very well balanced. Overall this beer met my expectations and I really enjoyed it and will defiantly pick this one up again!","Dan3279","May 19, 2011"
3.79,-4.8,4.5,3,4,4,4,"O - A nice wellcrafted stout by Bells. They seem to make nothing but good beers. Very glad I got to try this. Very easy drinking a good beginner stout.","kk73","May 16, 2011"
3.81,-4.3,4,3,4,4.5,4,"Was a little skeptical about the licorice, but I really enjoyed this brew. Poured black with a small carmel head. Roasts on the nose, but not as strong as I like. Nice balance between creamy and carbonation, very nice. Chocolate and malt, although not as much malt as I was expecting, and I expected more licorice but I'm ok with the subtlety. Finish lingers of roasts and coffee. Very nicely balanced. I'd prefer a little more umph from it as far as ABV, I think that would add to the overall, but all in all very nice beer.","1Adam12","May 16, 2011"
4.13,3.8,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"The taste is a beautiful thing with a dry chocolate and roast mix thats very full bodied and smooth.

4.35,9.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall / Drinkability: Hmmm....I think this would be good with steak, but by itself it's a nice beer to sip, savor, and finish the evening with. But just one is enough per evening. It's very intense in flavor which is good, but by the end, I'm pleasantly sated. I think this would also be a good beer to pair with desert, especially something chocolate.","damndirtyape","May 08, 2011"

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Full-bodied and very smooth. It has even more of those dark roasted malt flavors than the aroma would suggest. Initially it delivers black currant, and roasted malt, but it quickly transitions to charcoal, licorice and burnt malt. The finish is a balanced mix of burnt and roasted malt with a bitter hop finish. Overall this beer is a great experience.","SuperSpy","Apr 26, 2011"

One thing great about Bell's is that they are not a one trick pony but put time and effort into all their beers to be one of the best hand crafted breweries. This stout pours jet black into my pint glass with a little creamy head. Chocolate and sweet smell either hops or alcohol is very pleasant. Hoppy chocolate taste to a bitter hazelnut coffee flavor.

The nose comprises roasted malts, light char, a very light touch of anise, and a sprinkling of dark chocolate. Though there may be more listed there, the roast is king, and everyone 'round town knows it. The taste mimics the smell, with roasty dominance continuing. However, here the dark chocolate and anise shine through a bit more, along with a dull cut of coffee in the back room. The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth feel.

The roasted and sweet malts are balanced well in combination with a subtle coffee/cocoa taste that offers a bit of bitterness at the finish.

4.07,2.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours a black color with a tan head that fades rapidly. The smell gives way strongly to smoked malts. Coffee notes exist behind the prevalent smoke notes and lend to an overall interesting aroma. The main taste that comes through is char, now I know how that sounds, not too pleasant, but with the smoke nose (because it doesn't come up in the taste) it's not too bad. The remaining flavors are rich caramel notes and a backer of roasted coffee. The mouthfeel is bitter and astringent on the palate. For a stout the body is pretty damn good, but this doesn't sit too well on the tongue with out messing with it. It has the strong bitterness and acidity of a strong cup of black coffee. The drinkability of this beer overall is a still good, and I would not turn this beer down if it were offered to me at a later date.","Vdubb86","Jan 12, 2011"

The taste begins with a sweet malt, then moving to a sweet and tangy licorice flavor. Blending to a coffee bitterness that stays there till the end, that is smacked by the quick taste of licrorice at the end. The look makes think this is thick and syrupy, but in fact it is the exact opposite, thin and watery. It does gain weight gradually, but never becoming what you would think. The palate is left with a tongue smacking dryness that stays there for some time. This beer has some drinkable characteristics, a seductive and inviting look. The aroma and taste are solid, what one would expect, but the feel is inconsistent. The finish is dry, making up for the texture. Yet, it is still a solid beer.","cameraman","Dec 21, 2010"

The after taste is licorice balanced with a mix of bitterness and sweetness that is nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is a medium soft creamy feel that is also thick and chewy at the same time.

Mild spice and dark fruit in the finish, with smokiness and bitterness very present in the aftertaste. Journey along the palate is slightly dirty and prickly, but there's a certain creaminess to the body and mouthfeel at the same time. Like many of Bell's beers, this strikes me as decent and above average, but nothing mind-blowing. Too dirty/bitter for my taste, probably, but you could do worse. Other reviews mention licorice, but I really have to look for that consciously to even faintly detect it. Good head retention and one of the foamiest, stickiest sheets of lacing I've seen in a while.

This is a very potent drink which almost comes off as an imperial or experimental stout, though it is technically a standard American stout. It is quite cheap and widely available in my area, which results in a great deal because the brew itself is superb.","Gorgoroth","Jun 05, 2010"

Damn, this IS a tasty beverage. I had never had the K-zoo stout until now and am feeling major regret over what I have missed. The flavor is very well balanced between malt sweetness and the roasted coffee and chocolate character. Not too sweet or too dry, it really hits the target dead on. Full bodied, chewy and insanely smooth coming out of the cask. Nice, bittersweet finish that begs for another sip. I could drink this all day.

3.9,-2,4.5,4.5,4,2.5,3.5,"Pours a beautiful opaque black with a nice mocha head atop it. The beer has a wonderful nose. Licorice, molasses, chocolate, sweetness, yummy. The beer tastes quite nice with a rich body that has a traditional stout maltiness with a bit of a bitter kick and a great deal of molasses in the finish. The flavour would likely have been a 4.5 if the mouthfeel had been better. Perhaps it was the aging, but the carbonation was too low and it didn't have any real carbonation in the mouth to make more flavours burst out. It was so antithetical compared to the large head that was poured... Bad mouthfeel contributes to the lower drinkability grade, even though the beer could have been 4+'s across the board with more carbonation.","kjyost","Mar 15, 2010"

The aroma provides a hint of coffee, and the flavor is reminiscent of black coffee with a bit of fruity malt sweetness to balance. Heavily roasted malts are one thing, but the flavor of this one makes me think they went one step further and burnt some of the malt. Again, however, the malt sweetness brings some balance to this dark bitterness. This combination provides a nice crisp mouthfeel without giving up the distinctive flavor profile that makes this stout as easy-drinking as many of the year-round offerings from Bell's.","devilben02","Sep 19, 2009"

Personally, I think the coffee flavor's a little too intense for the style, but it still produces a really fine tasting beer. I like coffee a lot so that doesn't offend me. It might be a little better if that aspect were more restrained and allowed more of the other flavors to shine a little. Slight complaint, but there it is.

It sort of fades, but does have pretty decent retention. There is an incredibly roast barley smell - tiny hints of chocolate and coffee. The roast character is very nice, much greater than the average sweet stout. Not a huge amount of sweetness, but there is kind of a creamy smell, with a bit of a lactic twang. Very nice. The taste is very nice too. A bit burnt, but overall exactly what it should be. There's a dark roasty center to it, like some kind of a combination of dark bitter chocolate, or coffee, but really, it can't be anything other than the roast barley and black malt. A tiny bit of sourness, some decent sweetness, with a tiny bit of estery, oily taste, but not overopowering. A nice bit of sweetness balances it out, and fills out the body. Leaving it nice and creamy. Pretty full and pelasant. I'd say this is a great example of the style. One of my favorites to date, particularly because of the extra roasty character. A nice straightforward stout. A good beer for any occasion.","taylorhamrick","May 26, 2009"

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a thick, almost pitch-black body with brisk carbonation that led to a two-finger tan head that died at a medium pace and left some spider lacing. A pleasant, thick malt smell of roasted, maybe toasted, maltsoats, something akin to bread and coffee malts and a little bit of chocolate and caramel. A medium-to-full bodied beer that mixes being extremely smooth and creamy with a burnt dryness. Goes down smooth, almost slick at times and has the drying sensation that a quality stout possesses. Taste is comprised of bread malt, some roasted/toasted and coffee malt notes (possible toffee), some chocolate and caramel, maybe molasses, there seems to be hints of heavy fruits in there. My pallete is all over the place trying to pick up the bits and pieces of everything in there. Even has a slight alkie kick on the backend to boost it up and some spices. A mildly warming, complex sipper that is great to relax w/ anytime, especially as a nightcap.","clayrock81","Mar 23, 2009"

The Kalamazoo stout, along with the heavier Expedition stout, is a very solid stout. Where the Expedition stout is meant to be more of a sipper, the Kalamazoo is something that can be enjoyed at a bit quicker pace.

Smokiness that reminds me of a rauchbier, but only vaguely. Slightly bitter and very roasty aftertaste. Smooth, but the carbonation is almost sharp, and, when combined with the strong flavors, almost makes the beer a little harsh. Nevertheless, this is an incredibly flavorful stout and you'd think it would be heavier based on that. Absolutely delicious and very drinkable at around 6% abv.","dasenebler","Mar 12, 2009"

Really, truly cannot get any blacker than this, not even a hint of color. Sweet nose of grapes, rum cake, licorice (duh), coffee rinds, wood smoke, dark chocolate powder, more creamy in texture than scents, granola and cereal, as it warms a little more mixed black fruit comes out. Full-bodied, dense attack requires you focus on the act of swallowing. More roast and toast here, charred black coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate and fried butter. This tends to rise up and plaster your mouth roof while the tongue undergoes a noticeable release of pressure. The carbonation does what it can given the compactness of the whole. Same interplay between green grape/apple (acidity?) and darker fruits. No citrus nor flowers. Licorice lower here, murmur. Suggestion of mineral water opens a space for grainy notes. Nothing leaps out at you, perhaps too tightly coiled to strike fully. Tires the palate out before the first glass done.","farrago","Feb 27, 2009"

Before I even say a word about the taste let me just say that the body of this beer hits me just right. Its substantial fullness is is keenly felt initially before the carbonation lightens it up and lets the numerous flavors come out to express themselves. The roasty and dark chocolate bittersweetness come through clearly but don't shock the senses; rather, they are quite well balanced. The finish is a long and gratifying tug-of-war between the burnt malts and smoky bitterness that I find endlessly gratifying. A very nice stout that I intend to have year after year.","droomyster","Jan 30, 2009"

Taste is roasted malts, sugars, chocolate milk and some coffee hints. Only slightly bitter at the end but overall sweet. This style is really starting to grow on me and this brew is definitely in the upper echelons of this style. Complex and delicious. A typical offering of Bell's in that it has a spectrum of flavors throughout. The mouthfeel is heavy but smooth.

Aroma is earthy, chocolaty, grainy, with a hint of licorice, and milk. The flavor begins with sweet dark malt and fruit, but is quickly cut by an acrid, slightly smokey and roasty bitterness. A nice lingering roasted barley flavor sticks on the palate. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick, with a nice mild tingle from the carbonation, reminding you that it's there, though not in a dominant fashion. Drinkability: Very nice stout with a LOT of different flavors going on. One of the more interesting/complex non-imperial stouts I've tried. Kind of like Shakespeare Stout, but a bit more ballsy and earthy. That being said, the drinkability is good, but I wouldn't opt for this as a session beer by any means (though I'm not in a big stout mood these days).

Alcohol's well-hidden and reasonably low, though perhaps on the high-end for the style ... but what it really comes down to are the flavors and aromas here. And though they're bizarre, they're strangely not as offputting as they should be. Anise, cocoa, heavily-roasted coffee, all wrapped up in a dirt bow - sounds weird, but give it a shot.","CrellMoset","Nov 18, 2008"

It's a nice heavy body and the coffee flavors are apparent as soon as it touches the tongue. It's incredibly flavorful and if you like this style of stout then you can't go wrong with this one. It remains drinkable despite it's thickness. I'll definitely be buying this again and often!","jeremyd365","Nov 16, 2008"

Head hung around awhile and had some good lacing that left rings with every swallow. Smelled a slight sweet cream, coffee, and malt. Had a strong burnt coffee taste with again a slight cream. Had a slight burnt coffee bitter aftertaste that seemed to linger in your mouth. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. Almost felt a little thicker.

The flavour of this beer is pretty roasty and not very sweet; I don't think this is a sweet stout, but the flavours are quite strong. They have a good mixture of roasted barley with chocolate.

Taste is great, let this one warm up and it has a sweet milk chocolate-ness too it. Very pronounced chocolate flavor with some toasted grains as well.

A subtle but direct nose of big roasted chocolate malts. Same is with the taste, toasty chocolate malt and coffee notes are right upfront, followed by semi-sweet bakers chocolate, molasses and brown sugar. The flavors of the licorice used is very subtle and by no means threatening, this stout is so toasty it simply adds more complexity and pleasant bold nuances. Some hop bitterness is detected on the finish as well as some slight alcohol heat.

Black licorice, roasted coffee and a nutty bitter finish that lasts and lasts. All of this is nicely built on top of a rich, thick, sweet frame.

It is not sweet but has deeper flavors and heavier body than a dry stout and it is not as big as an imperial stout.

The taste was right there. Some roastiness to be sure, but a nice licorice undertone that came just shy of being too far forward.

Poured an oily, shiny black and sat that way in the glass with deep brown edges and a tan head that settled. Very nicely carbonated by fine bubbles. The smell is of cocoa, freshly ground coffee beans, cinammon sticks, dark wood furniture. A huge roast malt / burnt coffee taste, dark chocolate and expresso with a brazil nut astringency making itself felt from time to time. The finish is nutty chocolate, a lingering choco-bitter aftertaste, quite satisfying all around. Sufficiently complex yet highly drinkable; if I had access, I'd try always to have some of this on hand, a very nicely put together stout that succeeds on so many levels. Edited to add that it was Batch 8007.","ThatWineGuy","Oct 17, 2007"

Nose is strong on molasses, dried fruit, caramel, and maybe some chocolate too. Feel is solid, although maybe a little thin for a stout. Taste is excellent as well. All over the place. Up front is some sweet chocolate. Crazy roasted malts, and then some nice and pointedly sweet flavors of raisins and brown sugar in the middle. Roasted malt shows up again, a little more often as the beer warms. Ends with a solid, slightly hoppy bitter aftertaste. Solid aftertaste though, which sticks around with a nice sweet/bitter mix. This one's outstanding as well. I'm really stunned by how consistently great Bell's offerings are. I'll be picking this one up again. Possibly topped only by the incredible Expedition Stout.","soupyman10","Jul 11, 2007"

Aftertaste is a hint of a smokey nut character with peppery spices that tingle as well. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a mild but suitable carbonation.

It had a dominate element and that was the dry roasted malts. After that came the baker's chocolate, dab of sweet molasses, a touch of roasted coffee beans, and the slightest hint of dry roasted herbal hops at the end. It's a smooth medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation and with a simple aftertaste of just dry roasted malts and nothing else. Overall it's just an above average decent offering from Bell's. I kinda expected more from a beer with a grizzled Dwight D. Eisenhower on the label.","AltBock","Apr 01, 2007"

Faded from the initial 2+ inches to a 1/2 inch lace that stayed till the bottom of the glass. Very nice light brown coating left down the sides. Smell was very sweet, first hints were of coffee, and licorice, followed by sugary sweetness, and rootbeer. As it warmed hints of rootbeer or cream soda were apparent, and suprisingly pleasent. Smells were not too strong, a little more pronounced and it would have been perfect. Taste was very rich and creamy, with a soda like consistency due to the light feel and high carbonation. Predominant taste was coffee and caramel, again with hints of some kind of sweet cola taste. Only complaint on this was it came off a bit thin.

Looks black, almost entirely opaque, except it does look like a little bit of light can creep into the edges to make a dark burgundy. Produces a fantastic aroma of dark fruits, roasty bitter chocolate, light hops, and light alcohol. Mmm...smells great. Medium to medium light body with perfect palate smoothing carbonation. Creamy roasted malt and chocolate flavors hit the taste buds as a light tanic, stringency hits the roof of the mouth. I'm not a big fan of that tanic flavor, but this one is quite different to me. It reminds me of a porter more than a stout at this point. Bu I digress....so finally, to end the trip, we get a nice dry hop bitterness. Overall I think this is a great milk stout with a unique body and mouthfeel. However the tanic flavor keeps me from thinking that this is highly drinkable.","BeerHonky","Feb 11, 2007"

It pours into the chalice quite black with a medium-bubbled, yellow/khaki head that is thin, yet sustains, and leaves decent lacing. It smells of roasted/chocolate and burnt malts with dark fruits (figs?, plums?) and a little bit of a lactic character. The flavor is roasted and charred, almost acrid, with chocolate, coffee, green/piney hops, a medium to high bitterness from the hops and roasted malts, and licorice that makes a cameo after the beer warms a bit. The body is medium and smooth, with medium carbonation, and a long, roasted/coffee finish. Seems more like an American stout than a milk/sweet stout, but regardless, it is big, robust, and quite tasty.","mmmbeer","Jan 27, 2007"

Inky dark brown to almost black, as always, with a thick, yet soft looking, cocoa brown head. Nose is chocolate powder, dark-roasted coffee, a little molasses, a hint of tobacco and vanilla, and an herbal hop edge. Toasted, nutty bitterness up front. Slightly numbing herbal hops in the background, with sweetening dark chocolate and earthy peat. Sugary mocha, with extra shots of espresso and caramel try to nullify the roasted herbal bitterness. Finish is long and chocolatey. Full-body for the strength, with a spritzy, bottle-conditioned feel. Excellent, as always. Heres to the next 50!","alexgash","Oct 25, 2006"

There's also about an inch creamy tan head, and a lot of lacing remains on the glass. It smells like roasted malt, semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and some coffee. It tastes like dark chocolate and a bit of coffee, and there's a good roasted flavor too. The start is a little bitter, then the sweetness hits and then finishes bitter again with a lingering bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a good body to it.

3.98,0,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,3,"Pours jet black, nearly opaque except for thin dark mahogany highlights. The brown sugar colored head is dense and creamy and reaches one and a half fingers in hieght. Shows good retention, and the epitome of spotty lacing. Roasted barley nose, with coffee notes, faint black patent and molasses. First sip is sweet with dark roasted malts and blackstrap, some dark chocolate, and bitter black patent. Semi-drying aftertaste, a tame hop bitterness paired with coffee and chocolate. Low-medium carbonation with a full body- this is less dry than expected and more syrupy; which I found quite agreeable. Finish is akin to the aftertaste with plenty of complex residual sweetness balancing the roasted flavor and mild hop bitterness. The drinkability would score better as an export stout, but will please fans of Russian Imperial Stout. An excellent bargain at $7-$8 a six-pack.","PBRstreetgang","Aug 07, 2006"

Smell is very complex, reminds me of Dark Lord, full of coffee, chocolate, and different dark fruits, very very good. Taste is awesome as well. Starts out deceiving, but then all of a sudden it hits you with an onslaught of taste. Beginning is green, then roasty, changing quickly into cherries, plums, other dark fruits, then adds some chocolate and coffee flavors to finish it off. If it didn't start off a little weak with the green flavor it would be an easy 5 for taste. Medium carbonation, medium to full bodied, slick on the tongue. If the very beginning of the taste was eliminated this would just be beyond a great beer, the green flavor isn't bad, but doesn't seem to fit with the rest of this beer. Seriously get this if you see it. Highly recommended. Oh, and criticize if you want, this reminds me of a baby Dark Lord, I love it.","badbeer","Jul 08, 2006"

The head is a centimeter or so tall, but is a nice caramel/toffee color, and comes back quickly if you swirl your glass, I really liked the head of this beer. The smell is very roasted but sweet, with coffee and chocolate malts, but there are clear scents of dark, tart fruit as well. There are a lot of dark, tart fruit flavors in the beer as well, cherry and plum, but there is alway a strong noticeable roasted flavor that is bitter but not too. This should be a really chewy beer, it's so sweet and thick, but there is a good amount of carbonation as well that I thought gave this beer a great mouthfeel for a stout.

The aroma is fairly typical for a stout with the usual roasted malt characteristics. Coffee, chocolate, caramel and very light smoke. Also some moderate yeast and dark fruit. The taste is a little on the sweet side at first with the roasted malts again taking center-stage. On the finish it turns lightly bit, but theres a sourness in the there as well that I wasnt expecting and didnt really enjoy. It has a medium-full body, creamy texture and soft carbonation.

Moderate bitterness that seems to be from both hops and dark grains plays nicely with the roasty malt sweetness that lingers into the finish. There's some chocolate, as well as leafy hops that contribute a bit of citrus. Light, well-integrated carbonation and a medium body produce a silky, creamy texture. A bit drying in the finish. An excellent beer with a big, roasty flavour. I'll definitely pick this one up again.","DrJay","Feb 11, 2006"

Served in a pint glass, this beer is absolutely pitch black, no light at all coming through, a finger of beige head, nice retention and solid lacing. Smell isn't as strong as expected, a light roasted malt and some slight espresso. Taste is excellent, a nice roasted malt, cocoa, smooth milk chocolate, and a nice finish with some slight hops and a bitter lingering roast.

Again, slightly sweet to start. Some raisin, plum fruitiness. This fades to a sweet chocolate, toffee flavor, and finishes with a touch of bitterness from some faintly floral hops and dark roasted malts. Nice and crisp mouthfeel makes this one refreshing.

The beer lets you know it is there, in your mouth, but it doesn't overwhelm your senses. As the I drank more of the beer, and the temperature increased the flavors seemed to become stronger and bolder, as one would expect.

The taste begins with a big coffee note which is followed by flavors of lightly sweetened dark chocolate, cream, a sweet molasses like flavor and a slightly bitter roasted malt and hops finish. Really a well executed stout, kind of like a mini expedition (or maybe the expedition stout is the giant kalamazoo stout) but really tasty, and complex enough to satisfy even the biggest beer snob, lightly sweet but the finish is bitter to balance the brew quite well.

Roasted malts but not burnt or coffeeish. Probably the perfect balance between a milk and dry stout - a marriage of the two styles, if you will.

The palate matches the nose perfectly; softly roasty malts supply some coffee notes and kisses of chocolate. Milky sweetness. Dry finish with a long, roasted coffee bean aftertaste. Im sure this beer would be killer with cheesecake. The palate is a bit straightforward but it is plenty tasty! Balanced. Medium in body, low but natural carbonation with a pleasant creamy mouthfeel, it feels right for this beer. This beer is very drinkable and quite sessionable if youre a stout fan. Well, it should be noted that the 6.5% abv is not really conducive to drinking a six-pack at once. It if is any consolation the alcohol is hidden in the taste maybe it would bypass your brain as well? Just a thought. It is no frills but good overall. It is more roasty and dry than say Mackeson Triple XXX Stout, both are good beers but both offer different interpretations on the Sweet Stout style. I obtained a six-pack of Bells Pale Ale and I drank five of them, I went to review the last bottle and this is what I pulled out! Bastards! Oh well, payback is a bitch as Ive substituted beers before. This was purchased in Kansas City, MO. It is a solid beer.","bditty187","Feb 19, 2005"

It tastes too much like coffee I think. It's a great flavor to have in a beer, but not when it overpowers everything else. I think that's the case here.

The flavor is not quite as creamy as the nose tells. There is a lot of chocolate that finishes coffee, with only a slight bit of the creamy milky tones. Not bad, but not as good as their Double Cream, but not a bad flavor. The feel is nice and thick with a velvety creamy smooth texture. Good feel. Overall, this is a really nice beer.

Particularly low carbonation. Alcohol hint accompanies the restrained bitterness in the finish-> alcool which I thought should not be felt at all in a 6.5% beer with all that roasted malt. Once again, this stout got this milky aspect that I came to dislike when combined with an almost still mouthfeel. It feels, not unlike a wine, just dead in the mouth despite all the licorice, molasses, chocolatey flavors from the dark malts. Well done, but still severly overrated to my tastes and definitely nowhere near as complex as expedition. Smooth, yet ultimately close, but no cigar.","Rastacouere","Jun 08, 2004"

Aroma is of coffee and choco malts, with a bit of milk sweetness that rounds it out nicely. The taste is follows the aroma's map, and the sweetness really rounds out the flavor on the palate. Don't know where that 6.5% is hiding, but it was cloaked with some artistic brewing. If I had to find a fault, I think the mouthfeel is a bit thin for such a hearty brew, but this is really nit-picking.

Color is an opaque, inky black; evidence of a streamer or two is marked by bubbles popping up at surface of beer. Globs of yeast clinging to sides of glass are unappetizing as well. Aroma is roast, toast, and more roast toast, to a degree that I've only detected in Imperial Stouts up to this point. Nosefeel is dry and woody, with baking chocolate and coffee tones alongside a not-unpleasant taste of grain; yet behind all this, a plump, purple-fruitiness seems to be lurking. Flavor begins quite sweetly at the tip of the tongue, proceeding to huge roastiness in the midpalate. A slight cola-like sweetness lingers here, to the detriment of the overall feeling; then hops make their presence known in a bittery black coffee to dark chocolate aftertaste. And yet, again: a fruitiness almost like blueberry skins ghosts around in the background... and a woodiness more oaken than cedary. Mouthfeel is tingly and surprisingly delicate in manner; just approaching oily with a light cling that gracefully subsides. High drinkability considering the assertive flavor. A shame: if this beer only had a nice finger of head to top it off, I'd have given it a ""4" in all categories. That said, I was sorry not to have a second bottle and I intend to seek this one again.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Jan 22, 2004"

Aroma: Dark roasts create joy on multiple levels but the aroma here contains tones of mild cocoa, baking cookies, and an underlying tone of coffee beans very light but evident the oatmeal like tones are also very inviting toward my first sip. Taste: Such a beautiful balance of dark chocolate roasts and harsh bitterness from the dark roasts sweet robust flavor is just awesome solid all around, the ideal session stout. Mouthfeel: Fluffy yet medium to full bodied and smooth at the same time, unique quality to the mouthfeel can't quite describe it completely. Drinkability: A very tasty stout that helps me remember why I love dark beer so much, I once was stuck on the fact that only hops could suffice my beer sweet tooth but this is the type of brew that helps pull off a convert to stouts with still a great amout of bitter tones from the dark roasts so smooth and silky going down, just gotta love this one from Kalamazoo.","WVbeergeek","Dec 03, 2003"

Burnt malt and hop bitter sits in the back of the throat. Big, thick wads of lace hang onto the glass and slowly slide down.

Patent leather, black rubber, and sweet, milky alcohol rule throughout the cadence of dank, charcoal, lunchpail, sex and truffle nuances that come at the margins only to be tossed aside by the strict carbon organization of this beer's flavor profile. It would be better if it weren't so reminiscent of boiled potatoes and charcoal dust. I'm looking for joy in this glass of beer and all I find is a grim prison of black dirt, milk and sweet white potatoes. Christy Brown could have written a better beer.

Taste is a medley of bold and rich chocolate malts and some caramel malts noted, roasty/toasty and thinly sweet, mostly covered in chocolateyness, dark and close to espresso-like in its earthyness and bitterness. Mostly middle flavors is where it goes complex on your taste buds. Perfect balance with the late hops, notes of dark coffee beans and roasted pecans. Very nice stout indeed.

A nice sweetness follows, as well as defined roasted notes. The finish presents more fruity chocolate, with a wisp of smoke. A bit of vanilla is present as well, mixed in with the solid malt flavor in the background. As you can tell, this is one very complex beer. I also sense a bit of nuttiness in there as well. The mouthfeel is very smooth, and shows a moderate body. Not as thick as some sweet stouts, but flavor is what this beer is all about. I would gladly trade a handful of Guinness beers for just one of these. However, I could drink this beer exclusively and soon forget that there was ever any other beer in my life.

A short creamy head can easily be brought back, however, simply by swirling the glass, and it leaves some nice as well. The nose is rich with a sharp roastiness and notes of bittersweet chocolate, but also offers some floral and lightly earthy hops in the background. The medium body is enhanced by an exceptionally fine carbonation from bottle conditioning that leaves it creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor is also affected by the creamy carbonation, softening it's bitterness and rounding it's sharp roasted edges. It starts with an underlying fruitiness and dark chocolate, but immediately becomes quite roasty. It warms to reveal some caramel sweetness as it crosses the palate but reverts to deep roastiness and a solid bitterness in the finish. A rich, dark roasted coffee flavor lingers in the mouth long after the liquid had gone and occassional flashes of hop flavor can sometimes be found. Rich, complex, and highly enjoyable.

It's a good thing that I have to beg borrow and steal these beers, as my total would be much less as why sample the rest, when you can have the best. #10 of their beers sampled, not a ""loser in the bunch"". Trust the olde spavined ""Gusler", when I tell you this line of beers is phenomenal.","Gusler","Oct 24, 2002"
4.45,11.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Opaque and black as night, with a persistant foamy tan head.  Aroma of coffee, chocolate and nuts.  Flavor of the same with a bit of hops noticable at the end.  This is an amazingly complex stout, although it's not at all sweet which is odd for the style.  High carbonation for the a stout, and maybe thinner than it could be.  I'm not sure that this is what a milk stout should be, but that won't stop me from loving every drink of this wonderful brew.","zerk","Oct 16, 2002"
4.33,8.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Another beer as black as sin. If formed a nice bubbly dark tan head and left some nice lace. It had an aroma of malt, burnt coffee and chocolate . The flavor was of malt, burnt coffee and chocolate. It had a medium body and a slightly bitter chocolate finish. Another Bell's that seems better on tap.","Wildman","Oct 03, 2002"
4.6,15.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Beautiful pour. Deep black with dark tan head that looks almost sandy, but feels so creamy. It's a roll call of dark malt flavors and aromas: caramel and chocolate being dominate, but with an undercurrent and finish of burnt bitterness. Low to no coffee, though. Incredible stout.","aracauna","Sep 20, 2002"
4.07,2.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This powerful stout pours a deep black color with a foamy tan head wafting a deep roasted heavily chocolate aroma.  The roasted and patent malt flavors are backed up by an aggessive beefy hop presence.  The carbonation was a bit high from the bottle, but the flavor was nice and fork-thick.","beernut7","Sep 18, 2002"
4.95,24.4,5,5,5,4.5,5,"This is one of my favorite beers, so maybe I'm a little biased, but this is truly one of the best stouts this planet has to offer!","MJR","Aug 24, 2002"
4.17,4.8,4.5,5,4,4,3.5,"Very dark color (no light gets through, even when viewed next to a sun-filled window!) and attractive carmely bronze head.  Aroma of chocolate, caramel and coffee beckons to be drunk (so I did).  Taste is as awash with toasty chocolate and coffee as one would expect, though the bitterness was sharper than with some smoother stouts.  Nice mouthfeel.  I'll be back for more.","BitteBier","Jun 25, 2002"
4.52,13.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"The attractive beige head tops a virtually jet - black hued brew. Sharp, espresso & dark caramel, w/ rich bittersweet chocolate notes in aroma. Mild impression of well toasted buttery nuts rounds the aroma out. Rich, deeply roasted coffee & caramelized sugar followed by a pleasantly assertive roasted barley and hop bitterness in flavor. Hugely chocolately. Fairly full bodied, w/ a viscous mouthfeel. Finishes w/ a lingering enjoyable hop and roasted unmalted barley bitterness that leaves my palette beckoning for more. Kalamazoo Stout possesses many of the qualities an imperial stout has, yet is light enough for excellent drinkability. One of the most flavorful, yet balanced examples available. Akin to a true Foreign Export style stout in overall character. Yum's the word.","marc77","Jun 22, 2002"
4.23,6.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a medium - full body, opaque in color. On the nose are aromas of different hints of chocolate. There is also notes of chocolate on the palate along with hints of molasses, and heavy notes of caramel malts. The mouth feel is slightly fizzy but mostly smooth. This brew gets better as it warmsgood stuff!","WilliamPhilaPa","Jun 06, 2002"
4.63,16.3,5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Bell’s Kalamazoo Stout:  Absolutely black beer, with a dense brown head that sticks to the glass al the way down..  Full rich aroma like rich strong coffee and dark chocolate.  Very rich roasted almost burnt malt, with a bit more bitter bite than I’d anticipated, although not in a bad way at all.  A definite sipping beer, and two can last all night.  Excellent.","jackndan","May 11, 2002"
4.05,1.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Nice and dark, notes of long lasting chocolate without a heavy or bitter expresso taste...medium body with slight glass adhesion...this is really good stout, akin in the bottle to many cask conditioned stouts...worth letting warm, taking advantage of its lack of carbonation -- its the next best thing to sitting over the British cellar in your living room.","ADR","Feb 25, 2002"
4.83,21.4,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"ORIGINAL RATING: One of my all-time favorites. Even better if you get it on tap at the Bell's Beer Garden. Nice, rich taste of molasses and a velvety smooth mouthfeel. Bell's knows their stouts.","proc","Dec 11, 2001"
