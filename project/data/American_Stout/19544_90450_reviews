"I guess this is an appropriate beer for NFL draft night. Hopeful anticipation followed by a let down from a usually great Cleveland brewery. The Cleveland Browns of stouts."
""
""
"Tastes like Belgian dark chocolate and vanilla beans which yields great aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, and caramel. With a creamy mouthfeel and bittersweet finish. Nose is roast dark malt and creamy cocoa. A little dry. Definite hazelnut and a complex finish and lactic oaty creaminess."
""
"This beer poured out wonderfully with a very nice head and very good lacing. Pretty distributed in the smell. Almost nothing there for the noise. Taste isn't too bad. Tasty chocolate and hint of vanilla, but the aftertaste was lacking. Mouth feel was OK, a bit creamy, but nothing to write home about for a stout."

"A previous reviewer suggested pairing Oompa Loompa with a quality cheddar cheese, and I would concur with that fine suggestion. This is a great choco cream stout that is far less sweet and root beery than Samuel Smiths version. I highly recommend this one, Fathead's knows beer!"
""
"This is one to find."

"O - Another good brew from Fat Head's."

"Pours a dark black with a two inch light brown bubbly head. Plenty of lacing on the glass. Smells of big dark chocolate malts, roasted malts and some espresso. It tastes of dark chocolate but there is something there that's a bit off-putting. Medium body, creamy and roasty. Smooth all the way through, not really bitter or sticky. Overall, it's an alright brew but was hoping for more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad stout at all, but a little light in the body and heavy in the carbonation for me to consider it excellent. When I'm in the mood for a ""lighter"" stout, this is certainly a viable option."
""
""
"Stupidly drinks real easily, and one of the nicer simpler stouts I've had in quite some time."

"Overall an excellent American stout that I will look forward to every year."

"Fatheads Oompa Loompa Choclate Cream #tout is sweet stout that pours jet black with just a touch of raisin plum color when held to a light,~ Colossal head, more head than Violet Beaurgarde on prom night, about three fingers tall and lasted for what seemed more than a whimsical whim~ Palette was fuller than Augustus Gloop and had enough cream to make you feel about as glutinous~ Nose is Mocha, Root Beer, Vanilla, buttery and had more coco to make Arthur Slugworth jealous~ Taste is just a complete Wangdoodle! A chocolate river floats into Vanilla Bean, Maple, Roasted Marshmallow, Caramel, Butterscotch, Ice Mocha, Cola, Chocolate Milk, Frosty/Jamocha shake with Hornswaggler and Snozzwangler rounding out the back end~ This is the golden ticket! Finish is a bit bitter and very sweet, Mr. Turkentine says odds are this is a brew you will approve of, I think Grandpa Joe would agree, to bad you need a Veruca Salt pedigree to acquire it~ Overall: 91"

"The body is full but there's an almost spritzy impression simply from the abundance of the carbonation. There's plenty of creaminess, but as the char comes in it dries it out at the back of the throat a little."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Though more roast is preferred, this darker chocolate ale really lets the cream and cocoa sing. It pairs particularly well with sharp white cheddar cheese- Cabot in this case."
""
"Overall: Nice to try this but nothing special. A straightforward semi-sweet stout that is much too thin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours jet black with a small light tan head. In the aroma, a small roast and chocolate. In the taste, lots of chocolate up front, with a small spice underneath. A small spice like bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with and dry spice of cinnamon and all spice in the aftertaste. Quite nice, just the wrong time of year for me."
""
""
""
""
"It's a really nice stout. Fairly sweet for a stout, but never over the top or cloying. The bittersweet chocolate provides both the sweet and the bitter, for a surprising, easy to drink beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty unique stout; I don't love it, but I'm glad I had the chance to try it. Worth picking up if you want a stout without all the body/weight of an imperial, and it could easily blend into almost a lineup highlighting various styles from beer to beer without being overbearing."
""
""
""
""
"I have to knock the mouthfeel. It isn't creamy enough. This beer has a medium body, but no stick, no real creaminess. It might be better with nitro..."
""
""
"This is a tale I two beers. As is out o the bottle, it is over carbonated for my taste, and what I expect with the style. This carbonation distracts me too much and I cannot really appreciate the chocolate and the dark roasted malt. So, I swish it around in my glass for a while and the beer improves dramatically. I think they have a good base recipe on this one, and once they get the carbonation right they will have something here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Kind of a letdown. Was hoping for more chocolate and less bubbles."
"The aroma features such fancy as acidic roast, earthy chocolate detritus and watery vanilla. The taste is a little better than the aroma but both the flavors and the feel are puffy, hollow and vapid. The vanilla is really out of place and the roast is pathetically weak - it's basically a tangy bitterness. The chocolate becomes a little more plush but not not enough to save the beer; no, if anything it adds unneeded sweetness. The carbonation is such that it would be spot-on with an excellent beer but all it does here is portray the shortcomings of Oompa Loompa."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nicely done stout with some nice chocolate and roast qualities. I wasn't blown away however, and I feel there are much better stouts out there."
""
""

"Thanks to HopFace for this extra!"
"The label is classic Fathead's dude as an Oompa Loompa, the beer sounds sickeningly sweet thank the beer gods and Matt Cole that's not the case here. Pours a deep dark almost black with ruby cola tinted highlights with a dark cocoa bean tan head leaving light speckled bands of lacing around the sides of my glass. Aroma has sweet vinous undertones rounded out with dark chocolate roasts and hints of vanilla bean and a smidge of lactose creaminess rolling in the backend. Flavor has a balanced sweetness with dark chocolate cacao style roasted malts, a dry finish not overtly creamy or sweet compared to other milk (cream) stouts around. Dark Belgianesque chocolate hits with a nutty dark roasted coffee flavor with layered hints of vanilla bean additions peaking through. Mouthfeel has some warming alcohol shows up a bit, which is surprising considering it's only 6.5% abv, lingering bitterness from dark chocolate and herbal hops breaking through just barely. Medium to full bodied with flowing carbonation levels, goes down extremely smooth and easy. Overall a nice change of pace from the regular Fathead's lineup, roasted dark chocolate bitterness intermingles with hints of vanilla bean again thank the beer gods and Matt Cole for having the foresight not to make this a lactose bomb, in fact it's very much balanced and approachable. My cigar pairing for this beer came from Nicaragua Don Pepin Garcia's My Father cigars blended by Pete Johnson of Tatuaje for Janny Garcia: La Duena #2 Belicoso it paired well with the spicy Nicaraguan tobacco and dark tannins of the rich cigar which brought leather, spice, pepper, and black walnuts to the party."

"Lactose-y sourness mingles with a weak chocolate malt and has a bit of nuttiness. Mouthfeel blows goats - overcarbonated and flabby body. Not a huge fan of this one...I like the idea and the aroma, but the flavor does not deliver sweet, creamy chocolaty goodness. Bummer, I was really looking forward to this one."
"I wasn't very impressed with this stout. Scents and flavors are muted and it's too thin with too much carbonation."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours almost opaque dark brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, vanilla, toast, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of roasted notes and vanilla. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, vanilla, light coffee, herbal, toast, and light roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, light coffee, and roasted earthines on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of roasted flavor with cocoa and vanilla; with moderate sweetness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice milk stout. Good robustness and balance of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"o - overall a rather nice stout. milky and creamy. silky and smooth. a delight."
""

"Overall I think I would pick up a four pack since this drank very well. I am surprised at the reviews but if it truly was a sweeter stout people would complain too. I got what I expected."
""
""
""
"O - Not what I was expecting when I read ""chocolate cream stout," as I don't feel that it is overwhelmed with chocolate and, except for the mouthfeel, I don't notice much of a creamy presence. However, I still enjoyed this beer, and how can you not enjoy the label art?"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, not a bad beer. Disappointed a little by the body, but it's certainly drinkable. I could probably throw the whole six pack down in one sitting without a problem. The vanilla beans shined through more than anything. I would've liked more chocolate taste, but I'd buy again, now that I know what to expect."
""
""
""
"The aroma is faint but pleasant. The taste is similarly under the radar. It is very drinkable. The aftertaste is a bit better. The complexity is nice and you could have a few of these and it is reasonably priced."
"Taste-Dark chocolate, subtle vanilla bean, dark roasted malts, faint hop bite. Creamy, roasty, tasty and well-balanced. An easy-drinking stout that would be an excellent match for any BBQ dish."
"To be fair, this is not an ``imperial'' stout. It's a solid, easy-drinking stout beer, but it probably doesn't have enough flavor to appeal to BAs looking for a massive, intense beer-drinking experience. If you're looking for a big beer with a luscious feel and tons of flavor, look elsewhere. That said, there's not enough here to merit a second purchase of this beer."
""
""
"Oh well."
"Overall this is just ok. No single feature other than appearance separates Oompa Loompa from others in the style. It does better as it warms up, as chocolate flavors become more prominent; it was probably served too cold. Cheers."

"Eric"
"Pours a nice black, solid, with a 2 finger of dark tan head. Th aroma isn't too pungent, but there's some soft chocolate and vanilla notes, with roast and a light fruit note. Taste shines so much more with a rich dark chocolate, earthy vanilla, roast, light coffee, and sweet nuttiness. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly with a somewhat elevated carbonation level and a upper medium body. A little up in down, but the high points are high and its enjoyable in the end."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is rich and chocolatey, with large amounts of bittersweet dark chocolate and a slight burnt finish. A fine stout, and one I'll gladly revisit."
"O: A nice beer. Aroma doesn't do it justice, and while the flavors are quite nice, the mouthfeel on this beer really help its finer qualities display themselves."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, cream/lactose, and a light minerally aroma. It tastes mostly just like the aroma is, like dark chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, and some minerals. For some reason this brew really reminds me of drinking an oyster stout. And since I like those, it's a good thing in this case. But even then I have no idea why I'm picking that flavor up in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and has a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a good brew, I know I won't have any problems finishing this 6-pack! $10.99 a sixer."
"O - This is a very drinkable beer more subdued than I expected but very tasty, the lads did not disappoint."
""
""
"Delicious simple stout. Would totally recommend this to many. It's quiet for the label description, but it's a complete beer for flavor, feel, and aroma."
""
"O- I think I expected too much from this. The texture is pretty great but for a beer themed around chocolate, I could have gone for more. The flavors are all good but they're pretty subtle. It's pleasantly easy drinking, great tasting stout that leaves a nice chocolate aftertaste. Well done"
""
""
""
"O: Overall a great beer with a lot of charachter and worth looking for to try or just sit back and enjoy on a cold night."
"Overall - Well this is rather tame and mild. The flavor is to mellow and forgetable really. Bells cream stout is 10x more flavorful and enjoyble. This is like a light version, how was this released? Its not bad but nothing special and nothing id seek out again."

"Worth checking out and very tasty, but not amazing."
""
"Decently roasty nose. Flavor profile starts off quite promising, but leads to a sweet kind of thing that's really off-putting at first, but becomes less so as time goes on. Smooth feel. Overall, quite easy to drink. A bit sweeter than I would like, but it still works."
""
""
"I'm personally not feeling this one too much. Fat Heads brews some stellar beers, so maybe I had unfair expectations. This is average to me and they brew alot of insanely awesome dark beers. I don't think this one is going to grow on me either, but I am going to revisit to double check."
""
""
"I really dont gather anything from the ""cream"" part of this beer either. This seems to have had potential, but got lost somewhere in a sea of mediocrity."
""
"Overall, in my opinion, this beer is good and worth a try. It does not have the depth of chocolate that a Youngs, Sam Smith or Rogue have. It would pair well with desserts and would be a nice beer to introduce to non-craft beer drinkers. Perhaps the delicious write up set expectations too high."
"I wanted to love this beer. I ran out and got some when they had it in the brewpub. The taste is minimal, slight chocolate with maybe a pinch of vanilla. What really disappointed me was the mouth feel. Very, very thin. Imo I think they should of started with an imperial stout for this beer. Drinkable but I won't seek it out again. Hippy sippy from these guys is fantastic, I think that's what I was thinking when I got it. To each his own. Cheers!"
"OVERALL: A pretty good stout, but not my favorite Fat Heads has done. I was hoping for a bit more chocolate or vanilla flavor given the name. Still, a well made beverage and I would certainly drink this again."
