4.35,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"+1 to those who regard this as the essence of the American stout. I'm searching for beers that I call ""elemental"", that represent ideals from which other beers are concocted as mixtures/compounds. This just may be the elemental American stout, and it's available at fantastic price for the brilliance that you're getting here. It's a near-perfect balance of smooth, creamy, and bold. I salute Sierra Nevada for the continuing great quality of the older staple beers, even as the marketing arm seems to be convinced that appealing to hop-heads is the way to go. And I'd suggest that marketing this stout as their #3 grocery store beer, after Pale Ale and [seasonal hop-heavy beer], instead of another hop-heavy variety, would be beneficial to sales in the long run.","MartyMaltose","Friday at 01:14 PM"

4.1,0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 10/9/2014. Pours clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, herbal, pine, light smoke/char, light dark fruit, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted/bready malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, herbal, pine, light smoke/char, light dark fruit, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, pine, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of roast/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent American stout style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 21, 2015"

APPEARANCE: jet black body; impressively thick, creamy brown head tabletops in the glass's center, while high-arching lace adorns the outer glass; good coverage overall ... AROMA: nicely hopped, slightly lactic; some smoky, murky qualities; some plasticine hints late impede the otherwise welcome scents ... PALATE: reasonably smooth, slightly oily; medium-bodied with a palatable late rush of effervescence on and under the tongue....TASTE: a much hoppier stout than its tradition encourages, with some dry hops lending punch to a rather brackish taste; sweet, roasted like coffee and even at the finish, encouraging another sip ... OVERALL: a flavorful West Coast take on the British style; these guys do not do much wrong, and this is another example why...","dacrza1","Nov 29, 2014"

Gentle, fresh crushed coffee beans lead to pleasantly bitter, toasty aftertaste.

A good amount of lacing is seen with each sip that sticks to the inside of the glass also. Perfect carbonation for a stout. The aroma is of roasted malts for the most part but nothing else. The taste of the roasted malts comes through at first then followed up by a very bitter aftertaste, almost like drinking a strong I.P.A. (India Pale Ale). After a few more sips it didn't get any better. Way to bitter and after a good hour I ended up pouring about half of it out. One of the worst stouts I had drank.

Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is very well balanced, but not as complex as the world class stouts. It's a nice blend of chocolate, roast and slightly sweet caramel that flows into a low level bitterness. The finish is smooth leaving you with a nice lingering tingle of cocoa and hops.","tillmac62","Jul 23, 2014"

It's not as flavorful or bitter as Old Rasputin, not as big and sweet as Sam Adams Imperial Stout, but I'd rather have three or four of these than even two of those at a sitting. To compare it to something of comparable ABV, it's better than Guinness.","ChestSplitter","Jul 23, 2013"

4.04,-0.7,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"Sierra Nevada Stout - finally getting around to reviewing this classic! It's appearance is archetypal, with a dark shade of brown not unlike oil. Light barely passes through the glass, and over top is a 1/2 inch layer of puffy, tan froth. The aromas coming from the beer are great as well - milk chocolate, sweet bread, and molasses. One sip and the drinker will be in love - the velvety smooth liquid coats the palate nicely and tastes milky, toasty, nutty and decadent for such a low ABV beverage. The brewer's best achievement here is the balance of all the aforementioned elements, though. It finishes with a slightly bitter end, which leaves one to only want more. Buy with confidence - this is no 'run of the mill' stout.","Neorebel","Jul 10, 2013"

Promising aroma of dark, toasted malt, coffee and chocolate. Flavor of toasted, lightly charred malt, light coffee, chocolate and hints of nuts, finishes moderately bitter with charred coffee notes. Medium bodied with hints of creaminess. A well balanced light stout that hits all the flavor notes I want from a stout. Perhaps a bit thinner on flavor than I expected, perhaps because I've been drinking a lot of imperial stouts. A well made traditional stout as expected from Sierra Nevada.","LiquidAmber","Jul 02, 2013"

The lighter, sweeter, taste reminds me of a porter as opposed to a stout. Still, the overall deliciousness makes up for what the drink lacks in aroma...and in the case of at least this bottle, that is saying a lot! I will happily continue my search for a fine-smelling bottle...and even if that effort turns out to be in vain, I will continue to drink this beer. Yes indeed, I will.","BethanyB","Jun 27, 2013"

This stuff pours a dark sienna-brown topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, baking cocoa, light coffee, and a smattering of dark greens. The taste focuses on the roast and a milder version of the greens, with a dash of coffee in there for the sheer fun of it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, though a touch on the thin side, this is a pretty nice stout, one that keeps things as simple as the label presentation.","TMoney2591","Feb 04, 2013"

A hop bitterness also permeated each level, adding complexity, balance, and blend. The feel was nicely drying, leaving a pleasant smack and froth to the lip. If anything, the nose was comparably light, but the rest made up for it in this tasty brew.","TheBrewo","Dec 03, 2012"

3.93,-3.4,4.5,4,3.5,5,4,"Overall - A little disappointing. I was hoping for more roasted malt, but the hops battle it out for supremacy rather than taking a backseat like your typical stout. Comes across as a brown/porter hybrid moreso than a stout. Still, the incredible mouthfeel makes up for what it lacks in ideal flavor, and comes out somewhere around great. Drinking at a warmer temp allows the malt character to blossom; too cold, and the hops dominate.","TheSixthRing","May 25, 2012"

As with most of Sierra Nevada's darker offerings, the hops are more attention-getting than one might anticipate. On the other hand, the roasted qualities, which ought to be defining, are mellow and supportive instead. While Deschutes Obsidian Stout is a more balanced all-purpose example of the style, this is still not without its charms.","beagle75","Apr 27, 2012"

There are strong aromas of dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, and coffee. I can detect some faint hop aroma as well. The taste is of dark roasted barley malt, bitter chocolate, and coffee. It tastes like it smells, but the flavors are full and bold. There is some bitterness in the flavor as well and the hops provide some of that bitterness as well as extra flavor to go with the traditional stout flavors. This is a medium bodied beer with some carbonation. The mouthfeel is creamy and the beer coats the mouth very well. Overall, this is a most excellent stout and one I'd recommend.","acevenom","Apr 18, 2012"

Resinous hops cut through the roasted dark malts on the nose, an uncanny balance, like a black IPA. The taste is nice and smokey, like a breath of fresh air after a few blunders recently in the stout category. There's all the appropriate stout characteristics, dialed back to achieve a smooth and approachable balance. Not sure why I've overlooked this one until now. Quite good.

3.48,-14.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Bottle from Wing Central in the U district. Poured into pint glass. Appearance was that of any other stout, dark/opaque/murky. Small tan head that leaves quickly. Aroma was a lot of coffee, roasted and burnt malts. Taste was a lot of roast flavors and coffee, very slight chocolate if any at all. Palate was powerful, makes its way through the entire mouth. Overall it was decent. Probably a bit inflated rating after drinking IPA’s all day (not a fan of IPA). Very mild for a stout, but not exactly my favorite. There are better stouts out there.","Smurf2055","Jan 29, 2012"

Ahh, what a lovely smell...the taste, is like a choir of angels beating your ass with vines of Humulus Lupus and then giving you a scalp message in a Swiss chocolate factory. This beer has a nice big grapefuit twang and finished off with rich toasted marshmallow s'mores. If you wanted to dig deeper, you'd discover some bright coffee flavors and complex tobacco leaf. Despite all of these symphonic flavors and aromas this beer is highly drinkable. The only other Stout that comapares to this one is Storm King and pound for pound I'd rather be drinking this one right now. This is one of the best American Stouts you could get your cold dead hands on.","Star80","Jan 18, 2012"

4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Sierra Nevada Stout: Continuing my tour of the stout world, last night I tried a Sierra Nevada Stout. The Sierra Nevada comes with the standard black body and brown head. The head was ample and lasted until near the end, with a sheet of lacing on one side of the glass. The aroma was mild compared to other stouts, but foretold of what was to come. This stout has a bid flavor, mostly malt and molasses. There is a bit of bitter toward the end, but not overly so. Some stouts have a harsh finish, and that is not the case for the Sierra Nevada. I do not think I could drink two of these, but for one stout this is a robust, flavorful and manageable choice.","iSip","Dec 22, 2011"

4.13,1.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured into a standard pint glass. After the pour, it's tar black with a hint of brown hue in the light. The head starts out frothy, cream colored and bubbly. The head dissipates to a thin film on top, with more bubbles around the glass. Nice thick sticky lacing. This stout smells good! Dark rich bitter chocolate and burnt malt aroma. The taste is very solid. Bitter chocolate stands out with burnt malts (like the smell), with a dry hopped bitter finish. Mouthfeel is good as it's not watery nor too thick. Overall, this is a solid stout all the way around. Not an every week stout for me because I have other favourites, but this represents the American Stout category well, and I'll revisit this one eventually, which is saying a lot with all the options out there.","JuicesFlowing","Nov 05, 2011"
4.95,21.6,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Stout pours black, with the perfect sized tan head. The smell is rich, very malty, a bit of chocolate can be detected. The taste has a great malty earty backbone, with a strong choclate coffee flavors belnding in. Everything blends the perfect amount, and leaves a very bold flavor. The flavor is very strong, and leaves a nice bitterness on the palete, you would proabily not watn to swtich to other beers after this, no watery taste like some other stouts, and no one flavor is sharp on the tounge. Overall this is a fantastic beer, one of the best American stouts out there.","vette2006c5r","Nov 03, 2011"

The taste is pretty good though and the highlight, plenty of dark malts a little chocolate and a nice hop type bitterness at the end. Overall another pretty good SN product, I remember after drinking Guiness for so long the revelation I had the first time I tried one of these.

The taste starts with a nice roasted malt, not as sweet as the smell would suggest, the smoky notes come through and it finishes with a bitter malt flavor. The aftertaste has the chocolate and almost coffee notes. The mouthfeel is medium/heavy with bigger carbonation, and nice flavors.

I'd honestly forgotten how good and satisfying this beer could be. What I particularly like about it is that as far as the experience of drinking it goes, it sort of straddles the line between a dry stout and a cream stout. Nice roasty dryness up front with some clean, bitter, roasty notes, but without the coffee or chocolate notes you often can get with a stout. The backend is very creamy while the tight bitterness still echoes in the background. Dry throughout, but just a haunting hint of sweetness on the finish. Wonderfully satisfying- I'm going to make it a point to addd this back into the rotation.","Georgiabeer","Jun 06, 2011"

The finish has a nice touch of smoothness along with a bit of chocolate. The mouthfeel is nice, it's a ride in itself, going from prickly carbonation, to smoothness, to a dry finish.

Drinkability is aided by the smooth and easy flowing nature of the beer, but hurt a bit by the buttery aftertaste. I like the taste, just not as one that lingers for a while, leaving itself as a souvenir of the beer. It doesn't measure up to the coffee and chocolate, so I'd rather have those to keep tasting before the next sip.

It packs a bit of a hop punch, but that should be expected from Sierra Nevada. Big taste for a low price. In that regard, it's hard to beat.

Never sticky or sweet, the malt has a great roasted, fireside flavor while keeping the mouthfeel lean and drinkable. The finish is dominated by hops-- long, bitter and clean.

It poured a nice color and had a nice foamy head, the retention was also very high when I swirled it around in my glass to bring out more flavor but the thing is, to me, there is not a lot of flavor. I had higher hopes for this beer but it fell a little short. It wasn't that complex. I also did taste some hops which is not common for stouts so that kind of turned me off a little. Stouts are my favorite kind of beer and I would recommend this one for a beginner just getting into stouts since most stouts can be overpowering with their taste and character but not for a regular stout drinker like myself.","BigB415","Oct 27, 2010"

Not picking up much of that coffee from the smell, but there's a fair amount of caramel malt and toastiness, giving a nice and fairly unique sweet stout taste. Nice and thick, it goes down nicely.

Chocolatey mouthfeel mid-body with a dry, bitter and somewhat leafy finish. Not as bold as I anticipated. Pretty straightforward, but still a good beer.

It has a huge tan head that produces generous amounts of lacing, it sticks all over the glass. The smell is dominated by chocolate. I'd actually say more like chocolate malts, not as strong as a chocolate stout, but the chocolate is still the dominant feature followed by some floral hop aroma. The taste picks up where the smell left off but everything is a bit stronger. Kind of a sweet chocolate malty taste and a dry hop to it. The mouthfeel is good, but it's one of the most carbonated stouts I've ever had, it doesn't take anything away. This is a very drinkable stout, a great beer by a great brewery.","AndyAvalanche","Nov 13, 2009"

A milk chocolate color head that is thick and just sits on top of the brew going nowhere. The aroma is lacking a little. Some notes of slightly burnt malt, a little coffee, and a slight hazelnut is present. The taste makes up for what is missing in the smell. It is bold and has a strong coffee front, some burnt caramel, a slightly bitter finish as well. The balance is great.

Tastes of roasted malts up front with some chocolate and coffee. Pine hops strongly follow and some citrus hops come into play too. Pine hops and dark malts coat the mouth following the swallow. I definitely sense a bit of alcohol in this one, but a pretty good taste nonetheless. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good carbonation bite to it. Pretty creamy beer here. Not too heavy for a stout but I feel like the pine hops and alcohol flavors may take this one over with time.

There is little to no cling to speak of and some carbonation presence at the bottom of the glass after the pour. There are notes coffee in the smell but I didn't find anything overpowering. My sniffer might be off tonite because I really did not get any other smells than the coffee tones. The taste is an extension of the coffee that I smelled. There is a malty backbone and a somewhat bitter finish to the beer. Overall a good SN offering but not my favorite beer out of Chico.

I know SN loves their hops, but I feel they over do the bitterness on a lot of their beers. I wasn't a big fan of it here in this stout. Not bad, but definitely not the best. Mouthfeel is fine. Drinkability? I probably won't buy this again. There are way too many better stouts out there.","brianlg","Apr 13, 2009"

Its balanced flavor and subtleties make it a better than average stout for pairing with food, as well. It went great with a bowl of chili on a colder than usual spring evening for me. Price, availability and food compatibility often are big factors for me in beer. Well done, Sierra Nevada!","josiahschlender","Apr 13, 2009"

3.94,-3.2,5,3.5,4,4,4,"If you want a good brew that resembles the definition of an American stout, this would be it. First of all, it's dark. It's so dark that I had to hold it up to the sunlight to see any translucence at all. The perfectly sized head has a light toffee color to it. The scent of roasted malts comes through easily, as well as a hint of dark chocolate. As far as taste goes, the roasted and chocolate malts are pretty evenly balanced. The one surprise with this beer is the relatively high hoppieness at the finish, but that's not too strange for American stouts, and it explains the large ammount of lacing around the glass. This beer is medium-high bodied, the perfect viscosity for the standard stout, in my opinion. Drinkability is high, and at a relatively low abv, it makes a great session stout. I would recommend this as a good gateway stout for both the inexperienced BMC drinker and for the average hop-head who wants to branch out to the darker brews. The only thing that really stops me from giving this beer more than four in any category (except appearance) is that it just doesn't do anything to jump out of the crowd outside of its perfect color.","Boehemyth","Feb 24, 2009"

Was a little put off at first when I sipped it straight out of the fridge but it gets better as it warms a bit. Medium bodied, some chewiness to the mouthfeel. Medium prickly carbonation. Drinks pretty nicely. I appreciate a non-imperial stout with the robustness of the bigger guys.

It tastes pretty much the same way, very malty, smokey with a very dry bitter finish. The after taste is funky and stale tasting.

4.38,7.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another terriffic offering from SN. Pours dark, it looks black but when held to the light its probably the darkest mahogany you've ever seen. Nice two-finger, rocky, cream-colored head. Great retention and excellent lacing. Smell has almost a chocolate milk kind of sense to it. Muted chocolate and what seems to be a touch of grassy hops or grain. Taste is exceptional. Deep, dark and rich. Hints of chocolate, cocoa, touch of coffee, roasted grain, its got it all. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, leaves a slightly oily feel but not too overpowering. This is a great beer and an excellent stout. The reasonable ABV makes it drinkable and is best enjoyed a little bit warmer.","bunnyhustle","Jan 19, 2008"
4.07,0,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a pitch black color with touches of brown at the bottom of the glass. A small caramel colored head forms, but quickly dissolves away. The sweet scent of malt, chocolate, and coffee stirke the nose at first scent. Then it finshes with a grassy, pine fragrance. The taste of chocolate and coffee are strong at the start and dominate the majority of the flavor. Till each taste reaches midaway on the palate, that is when a mild bitterness begins to grow. That bitterness is of mild citrus, but most grass and earthy flavors, lasting till the end. The feel is smooth, slick, like thin oil, that is almost lost on the stong bubbling sensation of carbonation at the end. It still finishes dry and that felling stays on the palate for some time. This is a solid stout, all the wat around to the flavor and aroma, the feel at little less. But, overall this beer is great on a cold winters day.","cameraman","Jan 19, 2008"

Smell was full of cocoa and dark espresso... taste was rich, full of dark, burnt chocolate and the typical stout flavors... more bitter than I hoped and anticipated, so taste wasn't over-the-top... not a bad stab at the style, but not my favorite rendition either... all of Sierra Nevada brews are good, but this one was on the weaker side of the scale...

The first sniff from the glass reveals more hops with a burnt malt background. Further investigation reveals hints of chocolate. Tastes exactly as it smells. Roasted malts give away to spicy hops that touch the sides and tip of my tongue. With some effort the chocolate flavor can be found. Its a well carbonated drink that enhances the hop flavours rather than get in the way of what the beer is trying to accomplish. A light mouthfeel and very drinkable stout. I prefer more of a coffee and chocolate emphasis in a stout rather than the aboundance of hops here, but this is often found in my fridge and if I'm looking for chocolate I'll look towards Brooklyn or Young's Breweries.","Jmamay22","Jul 22, 2007"

The taste is initially rather roasted, followed by a low amount of caramel sweetness and finally a moderate hop bitterness and low hop flavor dominate the swallow. The after taste is initially the hop bitterness/flavor, but is then replaced by a residual roasted grain taste, which is slightly dry. The beer has medium carbonation, a full body, and is rather smooth. Overall I thought this stout was well done. I enjoy the solid hop bitterness at the finish, along with the simplicity of the beer.

4.43,8.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Jet black with a high, thick toast-colored head. Looks like a fine espresso. The aromas at colder temperatures are a bit tight with one dimensional Cascade hops, but as this beer warms up more elements come out: dark chocolates, malted milk and roasted malts. On the tongue, this beer is all about the interplay of fruity Cascade hops and dark-and-dry malts. Bright bitterness grips the tongue first, with the dark malt flavors providing a base for the mid-palate. The hops fade out a bit toward the end, being replaced by chocolate notes, before snapping back on the finish, with is very long and deep, with perfect dryness. This is a substantial beer but doesn't feel all that big to the mouth, in spite of the heavy carbonation. All in all, this is a wonderful beer, a superb example of an American stout, with all the hallmark elements meshing together effortlessly. One of the best in Sierra Nevada's lineup.","geexploitation","Nov 13, 2006"

The beer's body is not nearly opaque when backlit - it lets through a healthy ruby glow. The nose is heavily roasted and caramelly. Rich, too. Taste is roasty, sweet to start, and heavily hopped, as I guess should be expected. There also seems to be a sizeable portion of smoked malt. The taste picks up some chocolate as it warms.

Taste is the smoothest, almost all malt comparatively, still the slightest harsh roasted note way at the end where the hops were, so it's a bit more porter-like now, also yeasty in a good way. Mouthfeel is creamy, velvety smooth, perfect weight on the tongue, neither heavy nor watery, hence exceptionally drinkable, I conclude that I prefer it fresh but ages pretty well, and a few months at cellar (even slightly warmer) tempts was exceptional, when the hops tame a bit without disappearing as much as like they have here, but is a tad smoother than totally fresh.","Liquids","Apr 28, 2006"

So it goes without saying that it's a proper stout black color. I didn't pour all that well so I can't knock it for head, but when I swirled the glass I got a nice foam out of it which settled to a decent sheet. Smell is a comforting, familiar malt/black malt roastiness, reminds me of Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout without the winey aromas. Great mouthfeel, smooth and medium-bodied with just the right about of carbonation. Taste starts with sweet malts, then turns to black malt/molasses, but just when I should be catching some roasted malt astringency the west coast hops kick it to the curb. That hop bitterness sticks all over my palate for a long time afterward, making me hesitant to take another sip. I must admit I'm a malt fan, not a hop fan. I wouldn't buy this again, but if a hoppy stout is your thing, go for it.","Folderol","Apr 25, 2006"

I am a big time Sierra Nevada fan, but I live in Minnesota and the only thing I can get on tap is the Pale Ale, I don't understand why more places wouldn't have this beer. Never have I had a stout that used hops so masterfully, they don't mask the roasted malt flavor at all, and they are not citrusy or over bitter.

Very nice taste, composed of some dark chocolate and a strong coffee taste, paired with a bitter hop kick and right back to another coffee taste that lingers in the mouth for an extended period of time.

Just the right amount of astringency from the black malt. Along with the earthy hops, I get some citrus in the flavor that I'm not too keen on.

Bold roasted grain, light hopping, and acidity contributes a strong coffee, roasted nuts, and cocoa flavors with a light charcoal-like quality and Supported by a solid pale malt base for sweetness and complexity. Light yeasty sourness and breadiness create an added layer of complexity right before the finish. Underlying alcohol never adds sweetness, very little heat, and no off flavors.

Coffee becomes very apparent in the middle, and some mild baker's chocolate peeks through. Dry aftertaste, where earthy american hops finally become present and complete the near perfect balance.

The bitter coffee flavor imparted by the roasted barley is the major element, but the chocolate is also there in the background. It finishes with just the faintest bit of hop flavor, making it very unique. Extremely smooth and creamy, this beer should be held up as the standard for the style.

Coffee dominates the palate when the beer is cold but as it starts to warm, a wonderful chocolate flavor begins to come out in full force.

""Trying to be efficient"" comes to mind as a possible motive for the lack of balls manifested by this one. Dilute. This is a sessioner for sure. It doesn't taste bad. It really is quite alright. It just seems like a hybrid style at this point in my research. This is definitely not a one hitter quitter. I think we are meant to dispatch with the entire sixer on this one.

Also present is that dry, Guinness-like aroma. The taste is a long on the roasted barley and backed by coffee and chocolate. Some burnt black patent taste, which surrenders to an earthy taste. Hops are present, lending the slightest of citrous finishes. The roasted malt then proceeds to kick the hops' ass and dominate the aftertaste, which is pleasantly long-winded. A nice subtle dryness adds to the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little more than medium, not heavy or oily but slightly creamy.

It goes down rather smoothely and has a perfect aftertaste that stays on the palate forever. You can definately taste the roasted malts here and has a hint of coffeee flavor with moderate sweetness.

The beer leaves a warming sensation and has a slight alcohol taste. Has a roasted chocolate/coffee flavor with hops that contribute citric/floral flavors and a lasting bitterness (60 IBUs).

2.49,-38.8,4.5,3,2,3,2,"12 oz twist off bottle obtained from a local grocery store in Feb 2005. Pours a tan-brown thin layer of head over a very dark liquid that is dark red-mohoganey when held to the light (and is crystal clear). Smells of chocolate with a gentle coffee and that's about it. Tastes gently of roasted grains first, coming stronger in the middle and as the beer passes down the throat. Then, an earthy and unpleasant straw taste arises...perhaps from the hops? This unpleasant taste does have some floral character to it. Whatever it is, I'm not fond of it. A bit of a sour from the roasted grains, but not an overbearing sour like I find in so many other stouts. It's a dry beer, which serves to amplify the characteristics that I haven't enjoyed. Medium mouthfeel with mild carbonation that forms fine bubbles on my tongue. Little lacing inside my glass and the head is just a tiny ring for the last swallow. If I recall, this was just $5 per 6-pack and was not worth it. If you must chose a Sierra Nevade product, I recommend the porter instead.","mentor","Feb 06, 2005"

The smell is not as strong as some stouts that I am fond of, but smells of cocoa and coffee, with a bit of maple syrup. The yeast is slightly noticable as the ale warms. The taste is of chocolate and coffee, but slightly sweet, and light tasting for a stout, in my opinion. This ale is not very ""stout"" for a stout. Mouthfeel is a bit bland, although it is smooth. It's almost watery, like they added coloring to make it look dark, but underneath it is an average ale. I am not terribly impressed by this offering, but Sierra Nevada rarely impresses me.

Mouthfeel is quite great. There is a good deal of carbonation but not too much. As you move towards the middle of the beer the hops make themselves known.

The head is quite long-lived, producing a healthy lace until the end of the glass. Aroma is intense roasted barley malt, with a backdrop of bitter chocolate and dark roast coffee. Its simply a great smell. Taste is rather dry, with the roasted, almost burnt sensation. Its mouthcoating, creamy, and quite heavy. This is exactly what I expect when I see the word Stout. Finishes with a resonating bitterness, and a satisfying dryness. It just sort of makes you want more.","Suds","Jan 23, 2005"

In fact Im hoping to achieve this particular balance in my home-brewed stout. I dumped this one out into the appropriate Sierra Nevada pint glass. The body is black, with an off-white head that springs up rapidly and hangs around stoically. Although black, ruby-garnet hues can be seen when the beer is compared to light. Lacing leaves thick sheets down the pint glass. The nose is roasty and sweet with malts and esters, leafy pine aromas are sprinkled around the perimeter. The flavor is nice and roasty to the point of being biting, this is a good thing. Mild berry esters up front, blending in with burnt toffee and dark roasted coffee flavors, nice bitterness throughout and a mild piny hop flavors pop up here and there in the finish. Mouthfeel is good, I'd like it a teeny-tiny bit more robust though. A good stout, although my memories of this on tap are a lot better than this one tastes from the bottle.","FormatKid","Jan 02, 2005"

Good lace appears on the sides as the beer abandons my glass. Heavy malty aroma, and also a strong hops essence in the nose. Taste is hearty and dominated by the dark malts, coffee and chocolate, which leaves a bitterness on the tongue, almost as if the malt and hops flavors are two different entities with two distinct timings to their flavors.

Off the cuff, sweet malts, thick and definitely full bodied, to be expected. The sweet, dark roasted malts give way to some delicious licorise and dark coffee bean flavoring, but wait we aren't done yet. The cascade hops that SN has been world famous for, come out in the background. Finishes with a delicate dryness, and very little on the palate, just a craving for more.

The taste is what dissapointed me a bit. It tasted a little too ""earthy"" in my opinion. The hops snuck in and the roasted malt flavors were good but there was just some kind of sour flavor that I got from it that was not too pleasing. Although I did notice that there was a hard ring of yeast or something at the bottom of every bottle of the 6 pack that I drank so this batch could have been a little old.

This is a good thing...me love hops. Dried fruit and dark chocolate are also discernible in the nose. Mouthfeel is nearly perfect, smooth, creamy, and surprisingly not as carbonated as the apperance would lead one to believe. Has a very nice roasted malt backbone to balance the hop bitterness.

Deep dark color of black/brown and quite opaque. The head came up easily and lasted throughout. The head was rich looking dark tan and very full and creamy. The lacing was simply outstanding and quite sticky. IMHO the weakest element is the lack of a strong nose. This may be because the delicate balance of malt and hops cancel one another. The taste is certainly beautifully balanced with the hops perfectly blending with the malted barley. Some roast sense and an element of some citurs of the grapefruit variety.

Lacing is just adequate. Aroma is rich with sharply fruity cascade hops, dark coffee, and deeply roasted grains. Mouthfeel is initially medium-soft with a medium-dense body and then a harsh finish. Taste starts out with dark coffee, then gives way to a ton of Cascade flavor hops, a brief, subtle alcoholic note, some more Cascade, and then finishing with a long, dry, and harsh black patent/roasted barley character with mildly astringent, yet potently bitter hops. The hops become more pronounced with subsequent sips, and the malts become a tad sweeter as it warms. Completely out-of-balance with itself...the potential for complementary flavors is high, but instead succumbs to cacophony. Acrid, over-hopped, and over-roasted to be pleasant.

3.86,-5.2,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This stout poured a solid black with a half inch cream colored head that lasted through most the brew. The aroma was hard to detect, there was a some roasted malt and not much else. The taste is well balanced with a slightly bitter finish. It's hard for me to pick out any specific flavors. There is nothing overpowering about the taste. The mouthfeel is light to medium with a smooth finish. Not a bad stout.","Bruiser81","Feb 14, 2003"

4.18,2.7,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"It has a rich nearly black color and pours a big beige/brown head. A heavy lace is left on the glass. A small amount of yeast may be discovered at the bottom of the glass. Its aroma is rich in roasted malts and dull hops. Flavor is much the same but has more of a 'hoppy' element than its smell reflects. Roasted malts are the strongest flavor but there is elements of dark chocolate as well. This is a relatively bitter stout. It has a nice body--full but not ultra heavy, carbonation seems a little heavy though. But, this is a very drinkable brew none the less. I could easily quaff a sixer of these in an evening.","allboutbierge","Feb 09, 2003"
4.5,10.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Soft Cascades greet the nose as soon as the bottle is opened. It pours an opaque black body topped by a foamy light tan head that holds well and leaves nice lace throughout the glass. As it warms, the nose also reveals some chocolatey and roasty malt. The medium body is enhanced by a very fine carbonation from bottle conditioning that tingles the tongue! The flavor is quite intense; loaded with such deep, sharp roasted character (low pH), citrusy hop flavor, and yeasty fruitiness that it almost seems tart at the first sip. But it's decidedly bittersweet with more dark caramel, chocolate, and bold bitterness appearing as it warms. It's surprisingly complex with the Cascades remaining in the nose and making occasional appearances in the flavor. It finishes quite dry with a lingering chocolate/roast maltiness that fades to reveal rising bitterness and an eventual residual shadow of Cascade hop flavor. Well-balanced and complex. This is clearly an overlooked gem in the Sierra Nevada crown.","NeroFiddled","Jan 19, 2003"
4.05,-0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"I sampled a few bottles with two being quite hoppy and one not being that way at all. I guess I liked the hoppy version because it was significantly different that traditional stout. But this makes it hard to review, becuase which on am I reviewing? Anyway, a good looking beer, black with a reddisy hue on the fringes. Full biege head. Smooth rich roast and dark malt flavors, sometimes balanced nicely with Am. style hops. Excellent mouthfeel. A very good beer either way.","garymuchow","Jan 09, 2003"
4.22,3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer is virtually black and pours with a dense, rocky head that is a bit lighter than wet sand. It displays very good retention and leaves a nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is very fruity, with a strong Cascade-type grapefruit hop smell and a touch of malty chocolate. The first sip reveals noticeable hop bittering, followed by some roasted coffee and a touch of chocolate. A bit of grainess is noticeable as well. Later sips reveal more plum/raisin fruits and the accompanying sweetness. The finish is rather clean, and is punctuated by some good hop bitterness. The aftertaste is a bit of coffee, a bit of chocolate, and a touch of citrus. With a creamy mouthfeel and good drinkability, this is a very solid stout. My second favorite Sierra Nevada brew, behind Celebration.","aaronh","Jan 08, 2003"
4.95,21.6,5,5,5,4.5,5,"What can I say. I've been drinking their Pale Ale for years. My daughter told me to try this stuff. All I can say is that I love it. Great tan head which sticks around the whole time. Dark, hoppy, and bitter. The malts kick in with toasty flavor. Now on my regular beer stop list. I always have a case in the fridge.

4.2,3.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Whew! I've been putting off drinking this for a long time. Poured jet black with a brown film on the edges and a beautiful tan head. It tasted very hoppy to me, which was no surprise but as I drank more, the malt and hops blended perfectly along with a nice bitter coffee flavor. Mouthfeel was excellent, just the right amount of carbonation. Great stout, great glass of beer!","alittlehazy","Dec 11, 2002"
4.06,-0.2,5,4,4,4,4,"The taste starts slightly sweet with carmels and burnt sugars. Absolutely thick with roasted chewy barley malts with a nice bitter hop bite in the finish. Slightly acidic like a good espresso. There's simply loads of flavor in this beer. A true stout through and through and one of my favorite beers. Those guys up in Chico really can't some to do anything wrong, as far as I'm concerned.","DerKaiser","Dec 10, 2002"
4.38,7.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Oh yes, it has that brooding deep brown to black color I so admire, the head portly, the texture creamy and rich chocolate in color with thick sticky old sheets of lace that virtually plaster themselves to the glass. Nose is toasted grains, caramel, malt, the front is sweetly malt, the top thick and chewy with a pertinent acidic bite the hops masterful in their presence and to seal it off a dry bittersweet aftertaste that lingers on, and to my palate one ""Damn"" decent stout.","Gusler","Dec 06, 2002"
4.15,2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The full, thick head is light brown with some interesting darker spots and edges. And, happily, it sticks around for quite some time. Like all Sierra beers, there is a noticeable (almost spicy) hops presence, both in the nose and on the palate. But the complex roasted malts take center stage, with hints of alcohol, espresso and molasses, and with contrasting elements of sweetness and bitterness at the finish. The mouthfeel is rich and full, but still quite smooth. A unique, well-balanced and challenging stout.","jward","Dec 05, 2002"
4.77,17.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Damn. I put off trying this one for a long time. After growing up on their pale ale, Sierra Nevada simply wasn't the first name to come to mind when I thought ""stout."" Serves me right for being narrow-minded, I guess. This beer pours jet black in color with a very thin, very dark tan head. The aroma is grainy and rich, with very subtle fruit notes. Very slight alcohol nose as well. And of course, it wouldn't be Sierra Nevada without a noticeable hop boquet. Flavor is rich and roasty. Quite full-bodied, with a great bitterness from the combined hops and burnt malt. Finishes dry with a great bitter aftertaste which hangs around for a while. Quite a few steps up from Guinness in terms of aggressiveness, but the bitterness here is by no means off-putting. Great stout.","mzwolinski","Nov 30, 2002"

4.13,1.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Sierra Nevada Stout:  Wow, was I impressed with this beer, it had a wonderful balance, with a smooth mouthfeel.  The color was a deep cordovan, with a thick tan head that lasted throughout, and coated the glass the whole way down.  Very well balanced with roasted malts dominant, but a fairly aggressive hops bite to keep the malts from going way over the top.  Extremely flavorful beer, with alcohol warmth.  Excellent and interesting beer.","jackndan","Nov 05, 2002"
4.37,7.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours black with tight head that dissipates rather quickly but laces all the way down the glass.  Nice, stoutish nose to this one with strong roasted and chocolate/coffee scents dominating.  The pour and smell seem to lack the creaminess that I appreciate in a balanced stout, but the taste says otherwise--hoppy crispness and bitterness after the initial roasted smoothness.  Unexpectedly nice mouthfeel and drinkability, particularly for a stout.  Like other Sierra Nevada fare, this beer probably is as good as a ""mainstream"" beer can be.  What it lacks in quirky uniqueness it makes up for in consistency and solid appeal.","BitteBier","Nov 05, 2002"

4.28,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Black as night with a thin tan creamy head that left excellent lacing.  The aroma was a sweet malt with roasty undertones.  The taste was chocolate, then roasted malt.  As it warms, the roasty malt comes through even more.  The carbonation was big and the flavor was long-lasting.

Roasted flavors are up front and hold on throughout. Malt and hops battle to a draw. While this is a nicely balanced stout, I personally find that the intense roasted flavors keep it from being very drinkable.","doerickson","Jul 17, 2002"

Taste starts off with some roasted malts which then changes to a coffee flavor with a faint bitterseet chocolate taste in the background.  Great bittering hops make this truly an american stout.

Aroma a little like plum sauce (that shows up in the taste, see below)...Slightly winey and the deep roasted malts retain a touch of plum as well.  Acidic and dry finish, but flavor fade seems very fast.  There's something strange in the balance to me, too much spicy hop or something (Rogue Shakespeare does it right).  Mouthfeel adequate, but then again, off tastes and quick fade.  Good enough but ordinary in a weird way.  Sierra Nevada Stout joins the Pale Ale in the ""over rated"" category, in my mind.","ADR","Apr 21, 2002"
4.12,1.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Billowing tan head. Wonderful coffee aroma, burnt malty flavor initially. Unlike many stouts this is not smooth or silky, but quite sharp with a distinct West Coast bite. This is due to the familiar Sierra Nevada hops, and this is what gives the beer such great character. Even so, it is remarkably balanced and the slick oily mouthfeel gives way to a wonderful finish. This is a healthy and complex brew; there's a lot is going on here, making each sip a treat, even if the beer is not as compulsively drinkable as some of the most addictive brews.","Thrasher","Apr 15, 2002"

If this stout had just a bit more body, it would be absolutely superlative.  Anyway, this is an outstanding example of an assertive west coast stout, and is probably the best widely distributed stout available in the U.S.  Just a notch below Willy Shakes.  Cascade hops really can work in a stout!","marc77","Apr 08, 2002"

The taste pretty much backs up the looks with roasted coffee and chocolate and strong hop bitterness.  The hop bitterness is borderline overwhelming, but I'm turning into a hop-head, so I like it.  Great brew from S.N!  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Mar 29, 2002"

The smell seemed a little stronger and harsher than I anticipated. The first taste however more than made up for that. I found strong burnt malt, coffee taste and really nice strong finish. The feel is about right, maybe a little thinner than I expected, but the taste makes up for that again.This one seemed to start strong but fade toward the bottom of the glass.
