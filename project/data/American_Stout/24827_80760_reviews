"This tastes exactly the way it sounds.  I'd like to drink it with a big plate of beans."

"Very unique. Loved it. Great graham cracker and marshmallow smell and flavor, but still tastes like a stout."

"Had the Highwater Campfire Stout based on a recommendation from a friend and it was a great recommendation!  A very good stout with a rich but smooth feel and taste!"

"(bottle, 22oz) at BevMo in Valencia, CA. Aroma was like a chocolate bar. (2/21/15)"
""
""
""
""
"This pours a jet black in color. There’s definitely a s’moresy aroma to it. Melting marshmallow, graham cracker, and some milk  chocolate all come through, backed by a thick body for heft. A little too rich for me in anything but a small dose."
""

"Overall, while this was a pleasant offering, we found it to be a bit inconsistent.  To start things off, the aroma was fantastic.  Very complex, malt forward, and balanced by enough sweetness.  The taste, however, left us somewhat perplexed.  Again, it just felt inconsistent in what it was trying to do.  You would start with some syrupy sweet notes, then dive into some deep and boozy chemical things, and then finish off with a unique bitterness.  The next sip would be entirely different.  The mouthfeel lent to a thinned flavor and, with such a curious showing of rummy booziness, made for a thought provoking display, to put it nicely.  Intense critique and criticism aside, those moments of chocolatey and vanilla sweetness created a more full-flavored experience, saving the beer rather substantially."

"I think I got an old bottle... High sweetness and almost metallic that befuddles all the flavors. Get little graham cracker, if at all."

"Super nice stout on draft with a decent abv for what the beer is. Nice sweet almost marshmallow undertones to it. Flies off the shelves at my bar."

"The reason I'm giving this beer a 4.0 is because its a fun beer!  This really tastes like smores and great on a snowy upstate NY night"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste has the rich caramelised marshmallow, prune, coffee, candy and dark toast and graham cracker toast, nice sweetness with light balancing bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"This beers is tasty. Nice smell of graham crackers. I did think being called campfire that there would be a smoked note somewhere, but there is not. It tastes like a more balanced version of boulder shake."
""
"Very impressive and inviting aromas of s'mores. Taste is slightly less impressive. A very good cold weather stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Though loaded with adjuncts, this one is still quite tasty."
""
"O - I love this stout. I would love to see an imperial version. This is one of my beer tools to turn people to the dark side. Next time I go camping, you better believe this one will go with me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Subtle toasty aroma of s'mores, incredibly smooth and delicious chocolate taste. Serves well with slightly salted desserts (think pretzels, salted caramel, etc). This is my favorite dessert beer!"
""
""
""
"An excellent dessert beer."

"extraordinary in terms of style. aroma doesnt give you much but the taste has a ton of vanilla and chocolate and is extremely smooth. i was damn impressed. finished the whole bottle and want more. great stout."

"I wanted so, so much more based on that nose. That shouldn't be to its detriment of course, as it's still very nice, but I can't help but feel a bit disappointed in this beer."
"Overall: A clever idea for a beer and fun to drink for half the pint but I found that I couldn't finish it due to the sweetness"

"Pours a very dark kola hue with a chocolate laden three finger creamy head and lacing everywhere,out of all the brews that I've had that claim it tastes like s'mores this is the closest,the smell starts off with vanilla marshmallows,chocolate sauce,crackers and cocoa very inviting,the mouthfeel is full bodied with above moderate carbonation and the tastes just like smell are heavily s'more influenced with vanilla creamy marshmallows,milky chocolate,peanut butter and finished with cocoa bittersweetness and overall I like this brew it's a great dessert beer but also one of a kind cheers for actually tasting what you say cheers."

"Got in a trade with swingracex. 22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/23/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, roast, graham cracker, dark bread, light coffee, vanilla, light cream, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with well balanced dark/roasted malt, graham cracker, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roast, graham cracker, light coffee, dark bread, vanilla, light cream, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roast, graham cracker, dark bread, light coffee, vanilla, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of dark/roasted malt, graham cracker, and spice flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good spiced stout. All around well balanced dark/roast malt, graham cracker, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"Poured from a bottle into a goblet. Color is black--only shows a bit of dark brown near the surface when held up to a bright light. Thin milk chocolate colored head, nice lacing. Aroma is dark roasted malt, rich toffee, and chocolate, w some vanilla also. Flavor is dark, rick, smokey, with dark-roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate, and mildly stated hops. Mouthfeel is medium thin. Overall this is a unique and outstanding stout--a real treat!"

"Overall- I decided to review this beer because it was so interesting. OMG the SMELL is ridiculous. Fantastic smell. I recently saw a fellow BA stocking his shopping cart with 6 of these so I had to give it a try. I really do love the smell. One of the best ever. Although, it's very polarizing because the taste and mouthfeel really let's down for me. I'd say a very solid stout, just for the smell. Interesting. I'd probably buy again. It's only 6.5%, which is probably the issue."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Okay I guess. Not sure I like what was going on here, but it certainly tasted as advertised. Started off a little too sweet for my liking, but got better as I got into it. Not something I would go for again, but I could understand why someone else would really like it. Give it a chance and see for yourself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - The smell is so good. I can just sit here and smell it without drinking it. And in many ways, that's the way to go with this beer."
""
""
""
"O: it is very unique to have the smokey marshmallow flavor. Without it, it would be pretty generic, but it's a good beer to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It sounds odd, but it's like drinking s'mores and it's delicious. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - S'mores in a glass! Very tasty stuff."

"I really enjoyed drinking this, but, this is perhaps best consumed split with others. While it's not really sweet (although it *is* decadent), it's quite a huge task to consume by yourself, as the chocolate and vanilla flavors do start to weigh you down in the long run. Otherwise, it's a neat little twist on the style, with a flavor and feel that brings me back to many late nights spent around campfires, back in the day."

"Overall: On the light side, might be better served if it was more viscous. Superb smell and excellent taste. Worth a try."

"I mean, baby... we cool, right?"
""
"Now this was a surprise. Got this as an extra in a trade, had never heard of his beer or brewery. Brought this to a local tasting tonight, was the star of the show. Deep, dark rich color, little thin on the mouthfeel. Unbelievable nose on this, straight smores. Taste is exactly like the nose, smores on the tongue. Very good, can't wait to try this again."
""
"MF) This coats your mouth wonderfully. There is a smooth and silky quality to it with very low carbonation. It leaves your mouth with a slightly dry sensation, making you want to drink more."
"Highish D+"
""
""
"Nice sweetness, no bitterness at all. Good carbonation keeps the flavor going. Hints of coconut nose and coconut/caramel flavor, but not strong & overpowering. Very drinkable but can be filling due to the sweetness. Should be really good with a rich dessert, especially chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - lives up to itsdescription very well. Really cool/unique idea for a beer! Boost for awesome creativity."
""
""
""
"Deep black body with practically no head or lacing. The nose is quite interesting with chocolate and some vanilla as well as light smokiness. It's an inviting start. The flavors do not come together. The chocolate and vanilla flavors taste artificially added rather than extracted. The light smoke does not balance out the beer. The beer does not sit on the palate well either. This was a total miss for me. The flavors do not balance well and it tasted like a gimmick not a beer. The artificial taste was the biggest issue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am not sure where everyone is getting all these awesome flavors to me it taste like licking a charcoal briquet. Even if it was just a smoke stout it would fail at being just that since it's not very balanced..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Highwater really nailed this. They took a gimmicky concept, put it into a bottle and made a respectable stout. That's rare to do. Great after a glass, but I'm not so sure I'd wanna session this due to the sweetness. At worst, it's a fantastic dessert beer."
""
""
"Here's a well put together ale."
""
""
"O: All in all, this is a good beer. I was expecting more, but not bad by any means. I was just hoping for great. It definitely has a very marshmallow taste, but a little too light of a body for what this beer is trying to be IMO."
""
"I had no idea what to expect with this one, but I had to try it. It was well beyond my expectations - super tasty and actually works. Yes, it's super sweet, but no more so than any good chocolate sweet stout - they just add a few more things in there, but add plenty of roast and hops to tone it down. I think the only thing that would elevate it to amazing for me would be just a touch more roast, a touch more bitterness - but not much. Really enjoyed this one a lot, and I wouldn't hesistate to recommend."
""
""
"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass. Thin light brown head dissipates slowly into a thin film and ring around the glass, leaving light lacing. Aroma of sweet and toasted malt, vanilla and chocolate. Flavor follows with toasted malt, sweet vanilla and chocolate, finishing a bit dryer and roasty. Medium bodied. Flavor is a bit thinner than I expected, but pleasant flavors. An interesting take on an American style stout. I was hoping for a bit of smoke from the name, but still enjoyed this."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Easy to drink - tastes like s'mores. A good beer!"
""
""
"O- An excellent impression of a s'more in a stout without being sweet, cloying or artificial."
"Super solid, this beer brings me back to camping. A great combination of flavors."
"On tap. Pours a dark brown with small tan head that settles to a ring and leaves a very minimal amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is marshmallow, graham cracker, light chocolate, a bit of vanilla, and a light roastiness. The taste has quite a bit of Initial sweetness with marshmallow and vanilla. There is also some graham cracker and light chocolate. The finish has a light roastiness with a lingering marshmallow. Medium-light body. Medium carbonation. There is a lot going on here, but I didn't find it to work that well. A bit too sweet for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pleasantly surprised. Not something I would drink all the time, but it was a nice change of pace."
"O: A fun beer to try. The S'more character is definitely there and tastes and smells above all quite good. A tad pricey, but this is not just some novelty, it's a complete effort."
""
"O - Might be a good desert beer but seems more like a novelty. Couldn't finish my glass because the sweetness was just too overwhelming."
"Overall this reminds me of a dry irish oyster stout with some subtle sweet additions. Good."
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice balance of flavors. The graham crackers and marshmallows are just right."
"O: very interesting beer for sure, its somewhat of a novelty brew. Worth trying though."
"One of the better beers that is supposed to taste like something other than a beer."
"O- This was a decent stout that I enjoyed trying. I know their goal was to create a ""campfire"" stout with a s'more like presence and they were definitely able to do this. The presence was definitely detectable in the smell and taste however the taste/mouthfeel had a little bit too much booze for only a 7.3% beer. Overall I enjoyed drinking this, I'd recommend trying it if you like really sweet beers."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, and marshmallows. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with nice aromas and flavors that is easy to drink."
"Carbonation's fine, it's unobtrusive."
"T: Definitely not as sweet as it smells, but still delivers on the s'mores. Light roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla hit first with graham cracker, char and marshmallow creeping in on the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than it probably should be, but nonetheless, I would call this a success."
"Pours almost black with a tan head. Nose is full of sweet sugar and marshmallow. A nice toasted sugar note, graham cracker, vanilla, and milk chocolate. Smells and tastes pretty much like a s’more. Tons of marshmallow and chocolate flavor. Graham cracker maltiness, a hint of roast, and sweet sugar. Really awesome stuff!"
""
""
"3.5 D: Decent beer. Worth a try just for the nose. This would have scored a lot better is the bitterness wasn't so distracting."
""
"Drink- It was overall a good beer. A hard to make work beer but its worth a shot to split with friends as a dessert beer or something new. A lot better than Rogues attempt at a donut."
""
"Pours a dark black color with a large tan head that takes some time to go down. Scent is quite sweet with some roasted malt and chocolate. Quite a bit of vanilla and...toasted marshmallows... just like the label says. Great aroma on this one. Taste is just as the label describes. There is a slight metallic taste up front...but it disappears after a couple of sips. Great s'mores flavors here. You definitely get the graham cracker, marshmallow, and chocolate. Lovely vanilla, along with a bit of smoke. Mouthfeel is medium bodied...would love to see this as an imperial stout with more body, higher ABV, and maybe some barrel aging. That would taste amazing! This one is great though. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is the best thing I have tasted from High Water thus far. Solid stout!"
""
"Really, really interesting stuff—extremely well executed, even if the concept of a campfire-roasted sandwich of chocolate and marshmallow is not your thing. I believe I'll have to keep my eye on High Water in the future."
""
""
""
""
"It's an interesting and well-made beer, but I can't say that I really like it all that much. I would love to try it from a nitro tap. That might up my score a fair bit. I'm generally not a big milk or sweet stout fan, but nitro seems to help out. That said, if you are a milk stout fan, a bottle will probably be right up your alley."
"Overall this is an interesting beer. It deserves praise for taking a creative risk and doing it well. Overall it contributes well to High Waters' mix of bold traditional styles and more interesting offerings. This is less one of those beers you drink while out and more one that is meant to be consumed fireside as the bottle hints. This would also be a great winter beer."
