"Good but not great; would drink it again.  A good coffee stout but nothing there was a wow."
""
""
"Pours deep dark brown under a 1‚Äù fairly persistent, lacy foam cap. Starts on the palate creamy and grainy and then shifts to coffee and darker roast grain. The coffee and roast are not bitter or harsh and are well balanced by the grains. Average to a little above average carbonation, medium to a little above medium body."
""
"Way too thin...burnt/bitter taste, not roasty/robust. Not a pleasant coffee aftertaste. Bland for the most part, very disappointing to this particular palate."
""
""
""
""
"Good aroma.  Weak across the board beyond that.  I could list 20 beers, same style, that are superior."
"Too watery and carbonated for a stout"
"Great beer good for both beer and coffee lovers."
""
"One of the most underrated stouts I've had. Absolutely delicious and pretty easy to find in California."
""
""
"What am I drinking, water? Hardly passable as a stout."
""
""
""
"Thin to medium mouth feel, taste didn't live up to the initial aromas, slightly dry lingering after taste."

"O: This is an enjoyable beer assuming that you enjoy the taste/aroma of coffee without any associated sweetness. Alcohol is well hidden and the beer borders on being sessionable."
""

"When I saw ""coffee stout"" I expected more of a sweeter beer. Not so the case with this one, tastes exactly like a cold brewed coffee with fizz, if you like that taste this one hits the nail on the head. For me this would do much better on nitro, or at least with less carbonation, other than that I probably would get this again, I guess the low(ish) review has to do with my expectation more than the actual flavor"

"Was expecting a run of the mill stout, but actually very flavorful and smooth going down.  The coffee taste is very noticeable in the beer.  Also sense some light bitterness and a little sweetness.  I enjoyed it and would get it again."

"Overall, a decent coffee stout."

"Overall: Excellent beer. Better than I expected. I'll likely go out and pick up another bottle eventually."

"Another awesome beer from San Diego. I'm convinced any beer brewed in San Diego is going to be amazing, and this one did not let up. This beer is absolutely amazing in every way possible. Would I want it on a hot day to cool me down? No. But it's a chocolate and coffee lover's dream come true. If you like Young's Double Chocolate Stout, this beer is very comparable to that, and that's my favorite beer of all time! GO GET THIS!"

"D: This was a good coffee stout with simple but solid scent and taste. The body wasn't right, but the finish was smooth, so it was fairly easy to drink. Nice to try, but maybe not top tier."
"O: Well-crafted, light version of the style that's is heavy on the coffee flavor"

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light char, light nuttiness, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of coffee and dark/roasted malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light caramel, light nuttiness, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roast/coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, toast, dark bread, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and robustness of coffee and dark/roasted malt flavors; with decent complexity and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice coffee stout. Good balance and robustness of coffee and dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. Pretty one dimensional, but nicely enjoyable."

"Overall: a very good coffee stout. San Diego coffee works well in this style. I would like a heavier roasted coffee taste in future brews."
""
"Dark brown and clear with a ruby hue when held up to the light. The one inch cap fell relatively quickly to a thin skim of fine bubbles and a solid coating of lace on the sides of the glass. Coffee and roasted aroma, malt and brown sugar, a bit nutty with some chocolate character. Chocolatey flavour, moderate bitterness, brown sugar and roast, bittersweet, pretty straightforward. Medium bodied, creamy carbonation, dry on the palate. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor has the coffee dialed down. It's still strong and dominant but not overwhelming. The body is on the thin side and the carbonation on the high side. Overall, a bit of a one-dimensional beer--coffee without sugar or cream."
""
""
""
"O: Quite good. I very much enjoy this beer. This is the second beer from Coronado that I have had and it is very tasty, would definitely buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall mixed, coffee seems almost like coffee syrup or extract but has a roasty tannic note as well like hot brewed and condensed, the fudgey chewy and creamy oat aspect is nice, but the sticky syrupy isn't, some nice flashes and some not so nice."
""
"Poured a clear deep brown (not black) with a what I initially thought was a fizzy head. The head however settled into a creamier consistency and had great retention and some nice lacing. The aroma was fairly weak, with only some mild coffee notes and a slight earthiness to it. Taste-wise, there was a little more coffee flavor, especially up front, with some more pronounced earthy hops towards the finish. There was a decent fullness on the palate and a little bit of a crisp hops bite on the finish. Not a mind-blower but a decent beer."
""

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer pours a very dark, molasses-brown coloring with no head. There was no sound of carbonation when I pried the cap, either. This beer pours smooth and slick. Aromas of rich toffee, bitter coffee notes, some molasses highlights, subtle roast character, and a creamy sweetness. The nose leans a bit more to the sweet side than I was expecting, but smells good regardless. Flavors are slightly roasted forward, with a subtle coffee bitterness in the backbone. Some sweet highlights throughout, but mostly the coffee notes shine through on the palate. Very dry and smooth bodied, with no frills to distract. The aftertaste is a building roasted coffee bitterness as you go. The finish is slick and dry at the same time. Like I said, no frills, but this is a solid, drinkable brew."

"Purchased at Sprouts in Poway CA. Pours very dark blackish color. Decent lacing and a whiteish head that faded quickly. Smell is really great. Coffee, faint hints of chocolate, some nice earthy undertones too. Taste is very coffee forward, kinda reminds me of those chocolate espresso beans some people like to eat for a dessert. I found the coffee flavor on this stout really nice, its the first thing that really hits the palate and its bitterness, followed by some malts and chocolate to balance it out, makes for a very pleasent drinking experience. Not a particularly thick stout, with a pretty thin mouthfeel(very much like a cup of coffee) but even a russian imperial stout enthusiast can find a enjoyable beer in this one."

"More coffee grounds come out as it warms up a bit. Nice stout, that worth trying..."

"Overall, it's quite drinkable for its weakness, and it's pleasant enough overall. There's certainly at least some interest there. It feels a bit like it's neither committing to being light, nor is it being really rich. One way or the other and it'd be very good."
""

"On the lighter side compared to modern day stouts but does not lack in the flavor department at all. Smooth roasty coffee and barley leads the way in a drinkable stout."
""
""
"Poured into an 8 oz. glass nearly jet black except for a some ruby highlights when held up,a thinner beige head atop.Dry earthiness and french roast coffee in the nose,very dry.Dry and earthy on the palate,maybe to dry,tated almost dirty with no sweetness to counter-balance dry earthiness and roast.I like a dryer earthy stout but this may have been a little over the top in the category for me."

"Taste was disappointing, a little astringent, leaving a bitter aftertaste with very thin/watery mouthfeel. Beer didn't match it's aroma. Tried it chilled and at room temperature, did not develop much character."
""
"O - Powerful coffee flavor and aroma in this, make this a great go to if you're into coffee, but its another good mark in the book for me as far as Corodado goes."

"Food match: If you want to drink beer in the morning like some sort of loser then this is a good replacement for coffee. Along with the bacon/egg/toast/Sunday edition newspaper (the last one to read not eat) you might be on to a winner you morning-beer-drinker loser."

"Overall- A well executed coffee stout Coronado Brewing. The taste leans towards a bitter cup of black coffee as opposed to a sugary mocha latte. A smoother, creamier body could make this stout even more special."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark kola hue with a fast vanishing one finger head and sporadic lacing,the smell is strong coffee with tobacco and port,the mouthfeel is light bodied and over carbonated with tastes of chocolate,coffee,tobacco and finished with a roasted malty sweetness and overall it's average and would not buy again cheers."
""
""
""
"Overall a decent beer but a little to light in body and a little to heavy in smoky flavor for me. Add some oats or malto dextrin and you've got yourself a better beer."
""
""
""
"Not great..."
""
""
"D: Definitely more of a sessionable table stout. Coffee flavors are nice but not particularly robust. Mouthfeel is somewhat of a letdown for me. Would have this again on tap or Nitro even would be nice."
""
"Dominated by coffee. A little one note, but the coffee does make it a guilty pleasure."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this brew, but if they got the carbonation under control, this could be world class IMO!"
""
""
""
"A very tasty and quality coffee makes this beer. Earthy and dark-roasted. I like it."
""
"Overall just a regular coffee beer."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A sessionable pick me up stout with agreeable flavor, but I found it a bit thin and watery. It's not bad, Id get it again someday."
"Overall, nice easy drinking straightforward coffee stout. A solid offering from Coronado."
"Pours a solid three fingers of very dark brown foam, while frothy with many larger bubbles the retention is credible and long lasting, the lacing comes in fairly thick streaks but this tends to slide away swiftly. At first glance the liquid seems black but it is likely the darkest shade of brown possible, completely opaque, no visible bubbles, no hint of other coloration at the rims. The nose is quite roasty with a heavy emphasis on the coffee, quite milky too, black fruits and raisins, oatmeal and other sweeter baking grains, splash of mineral water, overall it‚Äôs not that sugary but likewise it does not have a noticeable hoppy charge to it either. Full-bodied, dense and reluctant to move freely, it has a strong drying effect on the mouth, to the point where it impairs the flavors. Coffee, powdered dark chocolate and a hint of molasses yet no core of sweetness, the plum, cherry fruit diminished and no citric nor floral element. The minor doughy breadiness helps. Carbonation is low but not absent. Some chicory notes at the end. Smooth but the dustiness adds to its lack of flow and slightly dilute ending. Not horrible but nothing I would purchase a second time."
""

"Overall a pretty straightforward approach to a coffee stout. Easy to drink and approachable, but nothing particularly extraordinary or unique here."

"Overall I am not wow'd by this stout but am impressed they made such a balanced coffee stout. Totally worth the $6.50 paid and I would do it again."
"Coronado Blue Ridge Coffee Stout pours a deep brown with two fingers of mocha head. The aroma is about what you'd expect from a coffee stout. Coffee and roasted malts. The taste is robustly roasty at first, and that is only doubled by the coffee flavors that present themselves. There's nothing sweet in this stout at all, it's all roast, all the time. Some hops help contribute to the overall bitterness of the beer. It's lacking a little in complexity, but it's tasty. The mouthfeel is light for style and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is good. It's a solid coffee stout."
""
""
""
"O - A decent offering with room for improvement. Having it on nitro would improve it tremendously I feel..."
"Overall, there is nothing wrong with Coronado Blue Ridge Coffee Stout. I would blame the name more than anything else. In fact, right under the name it says, ALE BREWED WITH COFFEE. There you have it folks: ale. That jives with my take."
""
"A moderately dry Yankee stout, for those caffeine freaks out there - you can certainly taste the guest ingredient in this one. I have to give credit, however, for as strong as the coffee initially seems, there's enough else going on to keep the rest of us non-users and non-early risers happy."
"with a 10$ price tag I don't think I'll be buying a second, its decent beer but I could get nearly a 6 pack of a similar quality for what I spent on a bomber"
"Overall- this coffee stout is not showing off and not falling behind. The coffee or roasted malt kind of lend a burnt taste to the beer that is a bit off putting. Someone described on here a flavor of cigarettes. I do however like the low alcohol. Coffee is very session-able, why shouldn't coffee stout be ?"
""

"I'm not much of a coffee drinker but this stuff might help sway me."
""
"It's 5.4% in the bottled version. Bought the 22 oz bottle at Ibis Market in Mission Hills, SD."
"O: A drinkable coffee stout, good flavours, nothing wowing, but a solid well-made effort."
""
""
"This coffee stout heads in the direction of an ink black color, topped with a mocha-tinted head. Leaving its marks around the glass are healthy doses of lace. You can expect lots of coffee in the aroma. There's mocha and chocolate covered coffee beans and a nice roasty aspect too. There's a theme going on here, and it's coffee, which continues into the taste. The flavor is coffee all the way with a light stout aspect that attempts to catch one's attention. A little mocha makes its case, but this is all coffee. The beer is medium bodied with a very bubbly body, a bit overcarbonated for what I like in a stout. In summary, this is an acceptable coffee beer, one that tastes more like a coffee than a beer."

"D - Not going to be my goto. Might be good over ice cream and chocolate syrup. Mocha, baby."
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with some crimson around the edges and a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, and some slight cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same but there is a slight sourness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a better smell than taste in my opinion. However, the slight sourness I am getting in the taste is unexpected."

"Overall: Not a bad coffee stout - very drinkable. This beer could be really good if aged in some bourbon or whiskey barrels for a couple years."
""
"Overall: A good coffee Stout. Mellow and enjoyable."
""
"O- Very nice coffee stout. Would call it more of a porter but would be good for breakfast!"
"Overall I like this brew. I have frequent the CBC just for a pint of this bad boy. One of the most significant coffee smelling and tasting brews I've had. Good stuff"
"I like a good Coffee Stout like the next guy but this just leaned WAY too heavy to the dark side of things. Just not enough actual flavor (beyond charred roast) coming through, and this could have also used some more balancing sweetness. There were a lot of interesting looking beers on tap here during our visit and this one left me disappointed."
"overall a very good stout."
"D - While the mouthfeel was a bit thin, this is a very coffee-forward stout with a bold roasted malt presence and nice chocolate character to complement the heavy coffee flavor."
"Pours a dark coffee black colored body. Smallish light tan head. Has a strong chocolate taste, and a little roasted coffee. Roasted coffee taste, some dark chocolate. Somewhat watery palate."
"This beer would benefit greatly from an improved mouthfeel - creamy and more carbonated would make this one a winner."
