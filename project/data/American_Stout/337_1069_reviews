"Dark, dark rubyish color, kinda looks like a really dark coke color. Pours a dense tan head, that dissipates quickly. Smells of roasted malts. Tastes chocolatey and coffee like. Has somewhat of a medium creamy mouth feel. It kinda feels a bit more like a porter than a stout. regardless it is one tasty beer."

"Not sure if this should be considered a stout?  Thick head, not super dark in color, very thin.  I rated it as such."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smelled alike a stout but was light to the point were it almost was a porter or a black lager. Tasted fine but just not much to it."
"Kinda glad its just a single. Not a drain pour by any means, just kinda a boring low abv stout. I am not saying low abv stouts are bad. There are just much better stouts in this abv range."

"Pitch black.  Thin brown foamy head.  Retention and lacing small.  Slight roasted with chocolate aroma.  Watered down aroma and taste.  Malty taste with more chocolate. Slight bitterness. Decent and drinkable."
"Pleasant enough, drinkable beer.  Not especially dark, thin body, not a whole lot going on other than dark roasted malt.  Nice flavor but nothing really special. Also seems a bit over-carbonated to me."

"Pours a dark brown with tan head. Roasted malt is foremost on the nose, with a little chocolate and a hint of coffee; follows onto the palate. Finishes with more roasted flavors."
""
""
"Could be a bit stronger for a stout"
""
""
""
"It's a nice stout but a tad on the light side for my taste. The head is weak at best and dissipates rapidly. It has a hint of coffee and chocolate that is not over whelming. It pours dark chocolate brown with a slight amber hew. It has a lighter then average feel for a stout with a smooth light roast malty finish. It may be much improved with a nitro poor on tap. However, I have only partaken in the bottled version."
"Maybe I've had too many BA Imperial Stouts lately."
"The new mobile format is making me justify my rating with a review. This was a surprising disappointment coming from St. Arnold. Thin mouthfeel, bitter throughout. I've tried three of these and didn't finish any of them."

"Got home and realized one of the beers in only half filled. Didn't get much better from there. Beer looks good, but is waaaay too light tasting for my liking. I'm probably going to switch to Sierra Nevada's Narwhal after I'm finished with this beer."

"Overall: not a bad stout, a little light bodied in my opinion but well worth trying. This stout has good malts and chocolate characters to it and the hops are hidden but balanced."

"O: major disappointment. there's just a pinch more dark malt in this than SA's amber lager, and that's a bummer. a perfect gateway beer for your friends, but if you want a stout, this ain't it."

"O: The 2012 batch seems to have been a lot better from what I remember. Not sure because I have come a long way since then and never even reviewed it. I just remember drinking the 2012, really liking it and wanting more. It is not bad. Its just not as good as last year I don't think. I bought a sixer and I will drink it but will not be buying more this year."

"Overall this was lackluster for me. What roasted chocolate flavors that are present are quite muted. That chalky presence doesn't add wellness to this brew. I just didn't enjoy this one."
"O- While it's quite lacking in the mouthfeel department, it's a halfway decent beer otherwise."

"Above average stout, esp from cask. Served with about 1cm head. Heavy roasted aroma is very pleasant. Initial taste is softened by the cask, but still has plenty of flavor. Certainly less acidic. Finish is surprisingly strong, with a good deal of malt flavor remaining, along with the thickness of the stout. Considerable lacing down the glass. Sure, there are better stouts out there, but if you find this, especially from a cask, give it a try."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours dark brown to black with a thick, light tan head. Some ruby light is visible along the bottom of the glass. There are aromas of dark roasted malts, chocolate, nuts, and toffee. The tasty follows the nose and the mouthfeel is creamy. The roastiness is pretty mild overall with some mild toffee sweetness. The chocolate and nut notes also play well with the rest of the flavors, producing a well-balanced brew. The carbonation is moderate and the body is full. This is an easy drinking stout. This is a very good beer."

"This is an angsty teen of a beer. A lot of things going on that ultimately don't make a ton of sense. Not bad, but there are better takes on the style for at least the same price."
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark hue, maybe a little too much carbonation, not much of a head, and no real lacing. Nuts and coffee with black licorice in the nose. Full roasted nutty coffee malt body. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"O - Saint Arnold makes some serious beers, in my opinion, and this is one of my favorites. It has all the classic stout characteristics and the perfect mouth feel. Puts a lot of other stouts to shame with it's perfection of a simple approach. I'd love to see the imperial version, but it'll probably be a while."
"Overall, I like this beer and though it is not iconic of a traditional stout for drinking in cold wet environs, it gets the job done here in Southeast Texas."
""
"Update: Much better flavor and aroma when served at the proper temperature. I'm an idiot (or impatient). Numbers upgraded accordingly."

"pours out lookin like a soda pop, dark brown body with ruby highlights. has the head of a soda also. quickly rises and quickly fizzes out to nothin. smell is pretty weak, some dark malt and milk chocolate. taste is meh. mouthfeel is thin and cola like. if i didnt pour this myself i would swear this is a glass of pepsi sittin here. pretty thin and weak overall in all categories."
"poured a deep brown with a nice amount of tan head (great lacing). smells of vanilla, coffee, cocoa, caramel. very sweet in taste.. basically tastes like cafe con leche.. with a few sugars. hints of toffee, subtleness of toasted grains.. a very nice light tasting, medium bodied stout with a creaminess to it that makes you thirstier and thirstier! overall, a really good light tasting stout - honestly perfect for the fall/winter months."

"thanks to tim in houston for the beer trade that brought me a six of this brew..."

"O- Very easy drinking stout. Almost a hybrid between an irish stout and an american oatmeal stout IMO. I would drink again if it was around, but definitely wouldn't go out of my way to get. Good value, good product, just need a little more oomph in my craft beer quests..."
""
""

"Overall- A medium bodied stout, but a bit too much carbonation. This is a good beer to try, but its slightly 1 dimensional."

""

"Still, quite drinkable...a good session or introductory stout. I'm always glad to have a decent go-to Texas beer at my disposal."
""
"The flavors are all there, though not too complex, it's not heavy enough for me, but it's very drinkable. So, if you want a good and drinkable stout then this is a good choice."
""
""
""
""
"D: very very drinkalbe. enjoy!"
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty decent beer. It's hard to go back to normal stouts after drinking RIS for months, but this one is very good."
""
""
"M / O. Thinner mouthfeel and medium-low carbonation to this one. Pretty sure this was last year's vintage, so I would go easy on it. Winter Stout is not bad at all, but I would very much like to try this fresher..."

"O: I'd call this a 'Porter' but everything else agrees with me. Nice sweetness, but reserved enough to remain approachable and quaffable."
"The taste is mildly roasted. It has some creamy and milk chocolaty notes. The beer has a light maltiness which gives a bready impression. The bitterness is low for a stout. The hops make me think of US hops. Mouthfeel is medium."
"O: Interesting but not really much of a stout."
"Overall pleasing flavors, mild and easy, but has good malt and spice to it. Very flat, even for a stout. Would be good for an intro into the stout world."
"O: It's a bit sweet and not balanced enough to really enjoy many of. Didn't particularly enjoy this one. Hard to finish the bottle."
"Poured a nice dark brown, little pencil thin head. Not too thick of a pour either. Tastes very bland, some malt, some light chocolate and a little roast coffee. This beer was over carbonated and had an unwelcomed acidic finish maybe a bad bottle but this beer is a miss for us."
"Taste is really good. Lots of dark chocolate and roasted taste. Very sweet. The after taste is bitter and more sweetness which becomes a slight turn off. Moutfeel is relatively heavier and carbonation is excellent. This is a very solid stout that doesn't leave me feeling bloated."
"mouthfeel - way too light bodied especially for the style, nothing making me enjoy it in my mouth which is sad, but nothing wrong with it either"
"O: I feel this beer has been unjustly maligned. 3.6? I just don't see it. Easy-drinking, tasty, and solid. Perhaps not the best stout on offer, but certainly more than mediocre. Recommended."
"O - Ehh, it's a fairly typical Stout with a too-thin body and too much carbonation. Not bad, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"o - Overall I thought this one was a pretty average American stout heavy on coffee and roasted malts. It was a bit too carbonation for me as well. Glad to have tried but wouldn't seek it out again."
"Overall-Very average, what I was expecting. Still a drinkable beer, I could throw one of these down at 7AM. Just not complex and rather boring."
"Notes: Again, nothing to rave about, but it made for a nice casual stout during this visit to Texas"
"With its 5.6 percent ABV this is very drinkable. It's not flashy & won't leave a major impact on you, but it has the makings of a go-to beer."
"Big thanks goes out to optimator13 for sending me this one in The Small Aquatic Mammal BIF '11! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a massively dark reddish brown with a two finger light khaki head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, toffee, and subtle caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocoalte, coffee, subtle caramel, and cream. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this wasn't a bad American Stout. This had a pretty nice flavor that made it pretty easy to drink. As with most American Stouts I have had, this one also wasn't very robust. The aroma was okay, but not very robust either. Definitely worth trying as I really enjoyed this one while sitting out on the patio."
"O: Well done, not great, but above average. If I were in Houston, and this was on tap, I would likely drink again."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is slightly over light bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Not bad. Overall, this is certainly not a bad beer. It just doesn't measure up real well. Probably about average for the style."
"D/O- Not a bad little stout. Nothing too memorable but glad I was able to have it. Very easy drinking stout."
"RJT"
"D - Smooth and easy to drink, no profound flavors but good for the style."
"Is this beer getting better every year? Seems like it. A little more roasted malt in the nose, but by no means a lot. Looks great with its black translucent pour. Nice head, lots of bubbles. A little lacing and small head. Taste is a tad more complex in the malt department than I remember, and the bitterness is a little more pronounced. Nice job, SA. Definitely worth getting a single every once and a while this winter."
"Lighter medium body for the style, higher carbonation, a bit dry and lingering on the tongue. Easy on the alcohol, but pretty light on flavor and feel as well."
"Drinkability is ok. The beer itself is pretty good. Decent flavors and it goes down pretty easily. It just misses the mark for being a stout."
"D: One of my favorite local stouts when it comes out every year and one I buy when I can. This is a nice replacement for higher ABV stouts like Buried Hatchet and is not as expensive."
"Light body with medium carbonation. Based on aroma alone, I expected this to be better than it was. The taste just doesn't follow up and the mouthfeel comes off a bit watery. This one is just okay, but not one of my first picks for a decent stout."
"I thought it was very tasty, it's not too heavy, and it's not really a typical stout, I thought it tasted like a cross between a porter and a marzen."
"Thanks, FreeVerse, for the opportunity"
"Picked up on a recent trip to Texas, my first Saint Arnold Brew. Poured from 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is black, but the body allows some light to pass which creates ruby reddish flashes in the glass. Small tan head, dissipates quickly. Aroma is lightly roasted, chocolate, but both are somewhat muted. Pleasant, but would prefer a stronger presence. Similar in the taste, all the elements are there buy would love them to stand out a little more. Mouthfeel is a touch too thin, almost watery. Finishes dry. The thin characteristics of this beer aren't always what I want when I grab a stout, but it does increase the drinkability in terms of being able to drink a few and still enjoy it."
"I don't really dig any of the Saint Arnold beers except the Divine Reserve ones, and Lawnmower ain't bad. I'm beginning to think they're all too light for my heavy beer tastes, but being in Texas and almost always hot, they probably need much lighter beers. Not quite up my alley mostly, but I'm sure they're much better on a hot day in Texas."
"From the label: ""As Bishop of Metz, Saint Arnold spent his life warning of the dangers of drinking water and extolling the virtues of ale. During his funeral, his pallbearers stopped to slake their thirst, but regretfully, there was just one mug of ale to share among them. Then a miracle came to pass ... that one mug never ran dry and all of the thirsty mourners in the entire gathering were satisfied."""
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter glass. Thanks to philhyde for the extra. Beautiful stout beer pour, black with dissipating beige head. Nice stout aroma, rich dark chocolate, nuts, and some mild roast. Fun and nice immediate palate, bubbly fresh and stouty! Roasty taste does not overwhelm. Very good stout experience. There is a developing attempt to be bitter towards the end. Just what I expect from St Arnold, quality beer."
"M/D: Light for a winter stout which would make you think the alcohol and flavors would be big. Could pass as a decent English Brown Ale, but a stout? Disappointing."
"D - The thin body adds quite a bit to drinkability, and the flavors aren't too upfront. A solid beer, if a little lacking in the typical ""big"" stout flavors. Solid."
"Drink- It was a nice extra from a good trader. I like St. Arnolds #9 and I think St. Arnolds does a nice brew here too."
"D: If it weren't for the odd aftertaste, this would really be pretty drinkable. As it is, however, it's almost a drain pour. I'll finish it, but it's not something that I'll look for again."
"For a dark stout, I was very surprised how watery and non thick this beer was."
"Again, I may just be a curmudgeon with bad memory and changing tastes and sensibilities, but hey, isn't that the definition of a beer geek?"
"Overall, this is a solid little stout, with solid drink-ability. Definitely my favorite from St. Arnold. We should be seeing in stores here soon, and I'm pretty stoked now."
"Saint Arnold usually hits it out of the park with their cask offerings. Not to mention I am a fan of the Winter Stout to begin with. Though this is just off, and seems week to me. Along with the odd sourness. I want to question the cask, or Stags Head quality. Though both those are usually fine. A disappointment for me."
"D - Not my new favorite, but very drinkable, good session stout."
"D - overall, this was pretty light and enjoyable - yet complex enough to keep my attention. there are better stouts out there, yes...but this one strived to be better than just average, and succeeded. a good, drinkable beer all around."
"d- well this one is getting 3's across the board for the fact its super easy to drink and i wouldnt mind having this again but it is boring as all holy hell."
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 3/4"" orangey tan head above the slightly cloudy orangey amber brew. Head falls gradually, with average lacing. Aroma is lightly spicy sweetness. Taste begins with spicy maltiness, finds somewhat tart fruitiness in the middle, and closes lightly chalky. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, soft over the tongue, with alright drinkability. Was looking for more."
"On tap at Alamo West Oaks. The beer was fairly opaque and dark brown, good 1-2 fingers of tan foam, some lacing on the glass. The aroma was more on the roasted side than sweet, toasted and a little biscuit/bread, but mostly roasted malts. Same with the taste, not as sweet as I'd like but still not bad. Fairly simple roasted malt stout profile. Medium body, I guess this is a simple fairway shot, safe and playable but not anything to make the crowds applaud with appreciation."
"While this beer wasn't really the American stout I was expecting, it's a quality, very easy-drinking winter seasonal."
"D: It's a drinkable stout. Not too heavy."
"Overall, probably no surprise here, but this is a good porter, how it ever got labeled a stout is beyond me. I don't think anyone that knows much about porters and stouts would call this a stout in a blind taste test. Another question, what makes this a ""Winter Stout"" - when i here a name like that, i think there might be a bit of spices or something that sets it apart from a regular stout [porter] but nadda."
"D: The more I drink, the more I like. A nice chocolate and coffee flavor and there is more sweetness to this beer than most stouts. The hop flavor gives it a really nice balance and the light body makes it highly drinkable. Different than the dry Irish stouts and popular Imperials...tasty and worth a try."
"While this received lower marks in some categories, I felt it tasted just fine. I wouldn't actively seek it out, but would gladly drink it if offered."
"= i want to like this, there just isn't enough there to like."
"I would probably drink this again, but not over any of their other beers. I enjoy some of the year rounds more. At least it is better than Divine 9!"
"M/D - This is a thin-bodied stout. It goes down easy but it is very light for the style. There is no lingering taste or mouthfeel. You could easily drink several of these. It feels more like a porter than a stout. Alcohol is very slight."
"D: very good for a stout! The lighter flavor and body make for easy drinking."
"I liked this one, nothing incredible or really special but a good, serviceable easy-drinking stout."
"Thin, watery stout. Alcohol not hidden well which is kind of funny considering it's only 5% abv. Head dissipated quickly, one of the lighter colored stout I've seen. Almost no lace, thin nose offering roasted barley malt and espresso coffee. The taste is thin and hurt by a poor mouthfeel offering burnt coffee beans, dark chocolate covered coffee beans and the hops add an earthy character. This might be good to a newb but not to an experienced stout drinker. Honestly I have been very unimpressed with Saint Arnolds, even their Divine Reserve series has only been beefed up versions of their already crappy beers."
"Poured into a new belgium glass dark brown at first then to black once it filled the glass. Thin off white head, min. lacing. There is a slight carmal malt scent to it. The taste is fairly generic, but that's not a bad thing. Hop front is slight, but the carmel sweets are well defined at the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel isn't too terribly thick, probably just perfect. Overall this is a very very drinkable winter treat."
"All-around average. It's a stout."
"Very solid beer. Thanks guys. :)"
"D - Nothing exciting, but it's enjoyable and very sessionable. A great beer to sip on when you're burned out on biggies."
"Taste is nearly all roasty and cocoa maltiness with a few flashes of dark chocolate. It is certainly not a sweet stout and has a fair amount of hop bite on the finish. Overall, it is a malty stout without alot of complexities, but it is a fairly enjoyable beer to drink. I usually pick up at least one sixer every December."
"It's not a bad stout but a little on the sweet side for my tastes."
"Thanks to mhewes for tossing this in on a recent trade, as spring is already here, I figured it was time to give this one a whirl. Pours jet black with about a one finger head. Not much lacing left as that tan head erodes swiftly. A slight, but nice sweet coffee aroma. A sweet, but back-ended bitter taste. The bland of the malt sweetness, almost seems countered by bitter lactose flavor. Feels a bit thin for the style, but definitely a drinkable stout, with a subtle sweet milk stout character to it."
"This is a decent, if pretty lightweight stout that's drinkable but not too complex."
"Drinkable - almost too (for a winter brew). Not bad - nothing particularly special though. Just an easy-drinking stout (that doesn't have much to it, esp. in the body)."
"Pours a very dark brown amber that is black until held to the light. There is a two finger tan head that recedes to a thick ring and thin cover. The smell is of licorice, bitter coffee, roasted malts, dark fruits and a bit of chocolate. Taste is roasted malts, chocolate with a hint of coffee. The sweetness from the dark fruits balances out the bitter roasted malt and coffee. The mouthfeel is a little thin but still silky and creamy. Drinkability is great for such a cold night. Not an alcohol bomb but helped warm me up."
"Overall tasty but relatively mild flavors."
"Easy to drink. Would have another. Nothing awesome, but a serviceable stout I'd have again. Gets better as it warms."
"This is a just above average stout that definitely resembles a winter warmer."
"The smell of light chocolate hit me as I took my first sip. Mouthfeel was a bit thin for my taste. Quite drinkable but reminded more of a porter than a stout."
"D-Just a tad bit warm on the alcohol which could be more hidden, but very drinkable."
"D- I rarely dislike darker beers, but I will not be drinking this beer again, it reminded me of Kahlua liquor. If only it tasted as good as it looked."
"Again, I'm getting more of a porter vibe from this beer, especially with respect to the mouthfeel, which is highly carbonated and has a tangy porter-esque ""zing"". Flavors of light chocolate, roasted cocoa beans, and a finish of dark, peppery spices. Despite missing the style, this isn't in any way a bad beer. I suppose it goes well with the lighter Texas winters, but I like a little more meat on my stouts."
"D- This beer has the tastes of a stout that I especially want in the the cold dark winter, but it doesn't have the body to back up the flavor profile. Better on draft. Despite this it is a quality tasting ale from Texas and worth a try if you're here to get it."
"This is a mighty chocolatey stout. It feels like a baby brother to Choklat, except not quite as bitter, and more heavily carbonated. Not overly sweet, all I can really taste is the chocolate. Little bit of hop bitterness at the end for balance. Also seems to cloy a bit with a slightly medicinal taste. For me, it's a little thin in the middle, for a stout it's not a real heavy body at all. Drinkability is helped along by the carbonation. Overall I like the chocolatey taste, and that is the saving grace. Without that flavor, there's nothing for me to like here. I don't know if I would go out of my way for this again, but I like it OK enough."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, but this beer is to fizzy and carbonated for my taste. I would also have liked to taste more flavor, especially the chocolate that you can smell."
"Black, ruby highlights (obviously). Maybe a bit thin looking, but pretty none the less. Brown head, with soft lacing. Roasty aroma. A bit of coffee bean. More coffee in the flavor. Some where between dry and sweet. A sweet dryness. Definitely dry in the back. Very nicely balanced. Again, a bit thin with the mouthfeel. Overall though nice to sip on. I could have a few for sure. And will."
"this brew pours up a solid dark brown with a decent tan head. nice lacing too. in the nose, I get bread dough from the yeast, roasted malts, cocoa powder, dark chocolate. I taste sweet chocolate malts, toasted grain, burnt wood, slight hop bittering, piney hops (in that order). medium bodied, medium spritzy carbo. My favorite of the Saint Arnold line up, besides the Divines."
"D: A decent brew. I'd prefer a little less bitterness."
"Notes - Needs more hops and dry malts to balance the sweetness. Still, there are not enough regular stouts available to suit my taste, and Saint Arnold's beer is a welcome one."
"lower the chocolate malt and use less attenuative yeast and this one will get better"
"D - If you're a fan of malt, this goes down great. Very easy to sip."
"D- Very good. Sweet and filling, yet dry and clean"
"Overall another great Winter seasonal from Saint Arnold. I usually don't like beers that have any kind of chocolate or caramel flavoring, but this beer has just enough to be good. Not overpowering at all. Throw in the hops and it makes this a very solid beer from Saint Arnold."
"D - Nice stout. A little too roasty for me."
"D - A pretty good beer for the most part fairly easy to drink a little too carbonated for my liking but overall its worth a try"
"Pours a dark black colored body, with a light tan head - small and quickly diminishing. Has an aroma of malts, some nuttiness, and chocolate. Fizzy palate, coffee and chocolate notes. Has a medium body. Sweet tasting."
"JonathanL7890, thanks for the hitchhiker. Pours black with foaming brown head, that quickly dissipitates. Neutral aroma, faint roast. A bit thin mouthfeel, with ground powdered coffee taste, backed by malt. OK, but rather plain stout. Carbonation is fine."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown/reddish orange in the light, very murky looking, thin light brown head forms, big bubbles, quickly settles to a very thin collar, no lacing. Smell is heavy on the caramel, light bit of chocolate, very malty, light roast, bit of fruity sourness, cherries, not a whole going on, not too stouty, but overall smells okay, almost get a hint of spruce or some sort of spice. Taste is better, almost brown ale/porter like rather than a stout, malty, caramel, chocolate milk, bit of coffee roast, heavy maltiness, some fruits, not a lot of complexity but isn't offending. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, easy to drink, not too bad, not a whole lot of stout character though. Thanks Parker!"
"D: I'll probably try this again if i'm in TX but not otherwise"
"Pretty drinkable beer; low ABV helps in this department."
"Body pours to a perfect blackness. Head is an inch and a half of fuzzy tan brown foam that fades in minutes. Nose is dark and has hints of burnt minerals, coffee, vanilla beans and hints of backround anise. Exceptionally smooth and creamy as you take first sip. There is sweetness layered on some mellow spicyness but the spice is even and soft. Mouthfeel is very smooth, sweet and nicely creamy. A very sesionable stout that I would keep in the fridge if it were available locally."
"Drinkability - a solid stout from Saint Arnold. Thanks to PHawk for a few of these traded at DLD08."
"D: Not a bad stout all around. A bit thin but the flavor is good. I'd drink it again."
"Not bad, but the major downfall is the airiness of the mouthfeel."
"Thanks to turbine2475 for including this beer in a trade and giving me a chance to try it. Pours chestnut brown with an okay head that settles to a ring. Smells lightly roasty, somewhat more like a brown ale than a stout. A touch of cherry and plum in the aroma as well. Taste is similar, but with a nice biscuity chocolate on the the finish as well as a touch of sweet malt. The same roastiness is there as well, and a bit deeper flavored than the smell might suggest. A bit light in body, but nice. Quite drinkable. Toasty and nice."
"D- Not a terrible beer by any means just not a favortie of mine. Fairly easy to drink though."
"Notes: Nothing too fancy here, but very solid. Thanks to JonathanL7890 for tossing this in as an extra."
"Drinks pretty good, but a little too much coffee for me to session on"
"Overall not bad at all, not the best stout I have had but it would work in a pinch, cant say I would recommend seeking it out, but it is certainly not one to avoid at all."
"Drinkability: Aside from the green taste, this would be a good beer. I was disappointed to taste the weirdness. Not worth trying. I won't get this one again."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured an opaque dark brown with deep red highlights. Half-inch off white head dissipated almost immediately, yielding a thin skim and then nothing. Some watery lacing during the tasting, but zero adherence. Scent of coffee with a hint of dark fruit. Taste similar to nose with coffee slightly more pronounced, but all and all, pretty bland. Mouthfeel is watery, with a little too much carbonation and finish is a bit chalky. Average drinkability; not what I would consider a go to beer."
"a little light on the mouthfeel not substantial -- almost a little watery the light body makes this beer very drinkable not a huge stout but it would be a good, dark session beer."
"Overall, this is a very good stout from a brewery made up of really good people. It is not the best stout I have had, but it ranks pretty highly on my list."
"Pours almost black but lets in a touch of light. Big tan head, but fades very quickly. Smell is of coffee, dark roast malt and a hint of a cardboard too. Taste is sweet dark roasty malt, mildly bittered with a somewhat sweet roasty finish. medium bodied and more carbonated than ideal for a stout, but its easy drinking and actually doesn't taste that bad. Honestly expected worse, and this is a decent beer all around, but no great standout qualities really, either."
"Verdict: This a truly a brilliant example of an American Stout with the added bonus of being local. I really wish Saint Arnold would brew this year-round, but they say the demand is not there. What a shame."
"Pours out a straight-up ruby body with a thin head that fizzles out to just a ring of bubbles. Smells of some roastiness, milk chocolate, and gummy worms. The weird Saint Arnold ""Sweet-'n'-Lo-meets-Haribo-gummy candy"" esters are going wild on this one. Really overpowers a lot of the chocolate and roast. Overbearing. In the aftertaste, more ""stout"" characteristics come out. It's too bad I have to wade through the actual taste of the beer to get to the decent aftertaste. Mouthfeel is kind of thinnish with a bit of harsh carbonation scraping against my tongue. Not all too drinkable."
"Poured black with red edges and looked a little bit thin on the pour. Decent off white head that dissipates failry quick. Not a ton of aroma-mild roasted flavor and fruittiness. Maybe oats. Taste was fruitier than I expected. Mild roasted malt flavor, light coffee, light chocolate with some cherry and some citrus fruit flavors. Low on hops but add to the citrus on the back of the tongue. Kind of thin in the mouth, decent carbonation, and crisper than most stouts. Very drinkable. Not the best stout I've ever had but good and a little different take on the style."
"Great for a weekday beer with the lower ABV. Enjoyed it."
"D - A decent stout that is a great alternative to any guiness drinker that wants to try a crisp beer"
"An easy beer to drink, and a good stout and tasty too"
"As previously stated this beer is all about the malts. It starts with great malt taste that fades into some dark fruits and mild chocolates. The aftertaste is all malt. This beer tastes as fresh as a beer brewed just the other day... and thats a good thing in this case. It has a fresh mouthfeel and taste that inspires you to drink more. 2007-early 08 bottle."
"Pours a dark brown with dark ruby highlights when held to light. Smallish off white head dissipates but doesn't disappear, moderate lacing. Smells of lactose, roast, coffee and a faint bit of chocolate. Taste is sweet with dried fruits and some roast. Bitter in the background. Mouthfeel is medium thin. Aftertaste makes you want to take another sip. Overall not a bad stout. The color is lighter than it should be, and the roast could be a bit more up front. I certainly wouldn't turn any down!"
"Overall, this brew is not a complete failure, but the first thing that comes to my mind is that there are several things that could use some fine tunning. Not a half bad brew though, as some part of me does actually like it, even though it's not the best example of what a good stout should be."
"Thanks to Wasatch for this sample of another nice brew from Saint Arnold!"
"Pours a nice clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice small fizzy tan head which lasted awhile, not much lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet roasted malts, toffee and caramel. The taste pretty much follows the nose malty and a nice touch of caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice stout, true to style."
"D - not undrinkable but not the best stout available"
"Bought a bottle at GrapeVine Market in Round Rock, TX (700+ beer selection, 5k wines....Heaven on Earth). I won't go into depth w/ a description of the beer, since so many others have done so quite accurately. I'll simply say this is one of the best stouts I've had. It's incredibly smooth & creamy and a bit lighter than is typical."
"Appearance is black with ruby at the edges. A medium brown head that settles to a cap and laces well. Smells is pretty straightforward. Roasted grains, chocolate, some raisin. Taste starts with a bit of roast and transitions into a strong chocolatey finish. Pretty light bodied for a stout, but the mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Overall, an easy drinking stout that isn't strong enough to put you under and is tasty enough to bring you back for more."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. The front label has a notch on the side indicating the month brewed - December in this case. The color was a dark, dark brown - basically black with just a hint of mahogany when held right to the light. It has a couple fingers of head that slowly dissipated to constant film with some lacing. Mouthfeel was really good with a smooth creamy bite. The aroma was roasted malts with coffee and chocolate but was not very strong overall. The taste was incredibly smooth. It starts with a malty bite that jumps right into a smooth, chocolately finish. This may not be the best tasting stout out there but something about it justs hits the spot perfectly. If you told me that I'd find a stout session beer I would never have believed you. For me most stouts are a once and while beer but I ready to crack open another one of these right away. This is now my favorite St Arnold by far. Only wish it was available year round. Highly recommend!!! (4.75, HR, T, Y)"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this one. High on the malts without being too powerfully bitter. Seems dangerously close to the Irish Dry Stout style. Recommended."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a dark brown, almost black, forming a 1/2 inch tan head, that left nice lacing on the glass. The nose is mostly roasted malts, with a hint of coffee. The taste is that expected from a stout. Roasted malts, and coffee flavoring. Medium mouthfeel. A very tasty stout, and an easy session beer for those cold winter nights. By far my favorite offering from Saint Arnold. Try this one before the season ends."
"Lightweight Stout, but still a decent brew. I would call it a porter."
"A pleasing and exceptionally tasty winter treat from Saint Arnold. This is on their top echelon of beers. I highly recommend it."
"Overall, I have to say I like it. Definitely above average."
"A decent stout and easy to drink, but I expected a little more body and robustness in a winter stout."
"Overall, very nice stout. More complex than i expected. Quite enjoyable."
"Cheers2Beers"
"This is St. Arnold's winter special beer. The appearance was exceptional, a beautiful dark stout. The smell was average at best. The tast was strong, with limited bitterness. Overall the drinkability was phenomenal. Probably one of St. Arnold's best seasonals, only falling short of teh summer pils."
"Arguably more like a porter than a stout, so my review reflects my enjoyment of the beer more than whether or not it really fits into a traditional stout category."
"Poured a deep, dark ruby colour with a thick, creamy tan head. Chocolate and coffee aromas. Tart, almost sour to start. Finishes dry and with a slightly bitter, chocolate flavour. Mouthfeel is a little thin, perhaps a little watery. Okay for once and awhile, but not a stout that I would drink very often."
"Opinion: I think that this is a pretty good beer. This year it is quite under carbonated, so this makes it come across the palate as rather heavy with some serious accent on the roast grains. It is still a very drinkable beer."
"Solid winter stout from SA this year."
"Forget about color, head size/duration, this stout delivers."
"This stout has a dark brown color and a light amount of carbonation and very pleasant aroma and taste. The aroma is malty. It is sweeter than many other stouts and finishes with a slight bitterness that may not please fans of dry stouts. However, since the sweetness subsumes the dryness, a lot of subtle flavors can be detected, notably, caramel, coffee, and dark liquorish. A mild after taste lingers for a few seconds due to a watery texture that leaves your palate warm and refreshed."
"The Saint Arnold Winter Stout pours a very dark brown with a moderate off-white head. The aroma is strong roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. The aroma translates very well to the flavor, which is roasty and sweet with a slight hoppy finish. This stout does have a sweet character but this is not a sweet stout. the roasted malt gives the beer a dry character that overpowers the sweetness. For a winter stout, I would like the alcohol to be a little more pronounced, or at least have a warming character. However, this is a tasty beer."
"This beer pours a rubied dark brown color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is a mix of coffee, chocolate and a hint of dark fruit. The flavor is coffee bitter, but slightly chocolate sweet on the finish. The feel is not quite as thick as I would like it to be. Just at moderate. This is easy drinking and refreshing, but I want a little less drinkability in my stouts. I want to have it be thick and coating so I sip it more and drink it less. Still, not a bad beer."
"Pours a still-translucent dark color, with a tiny creamy tan head. Smell is very light coffee, slight acidity. Taste is very sweet and slightly acidic. Coffee and hoppy, yes, but not the best representation of the style. Flavors need to be bloder, mouthfeel needs to be thicker. A drinkable, almost too approachable stout. Thanks to assurbanipaul for the oppurtunity."
"A somewhat average beer from our state's oldest surviving microbrewery."
"Dark cola colored, which to me equals almost black, but with a dark ruby shade in the light. Head is very thin and light-brown. Aroma is of roasted malts with a hint of coffee. Taste is of a soft roasted flavor with moderate coffee notes. A very mild taste of chocolate is noted too. There is a moderately lingering sweetness. Overall the taste of Saint Arnold Winter Stout isn't quite full enough to be great. Everything seems just a little light here, which may actually increase drinkability. This is a very good beer, but lacks a richness which is needed. Saint Arnold Christmas Ale is a better winter seasonal from this company."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours black with a tan head that fades quickly. Strong roasted , toasted grain smell. Taste is toasted malts with a strong , almost astringent coffee flavor ; finishes very dry . Light bodied for a stout. A smooth, easy drinking Texas brew."
"Very drinkable stout. If you like Guinness Extra Stout, you'll love this one. Thanks again HardTarget!"
"Mouthfeel is a little blah with very little carbonation but the body stands up well, if a little thinner than expected in a stout. I think this beer suffers from it's name -- it's really a winter ale, not fair to compare it to Guinness or Dark Lord. Overall, not a bad winter seasonal."
"This beer is a toffee brown/black, deep garnet highlights before the light. The head is small, brown, fine. There's just a hint of smoke in the roasty, chocolate nose. A touch sickly-sour, too. It starts tangy, with burnt toffee, passing through a thinnish, slightly watery middle to a nice, bitter, smoky finish showing coffee and chocolate. Vegetables (peas?) and burnt wood in the aftertaste. This isn't bad. It gets maltier and chocolatier as it warms."
"This beer pours a very deep black with a very very thin head. One of the first things you notice (besides the lack of carbonation) is the sweet chocolate and coffee smells, these smells are also the most noticeable flavors you find while drinking this brew. Lots of roasted malt flavor and dark chocolate. This isn't a bad beer, I just really wish it had a little more carbonation to it, hold the head longer, but overall, not bad. With a few improvements, this could be a really great brew."
"Drinkability/notes: A very pleasing winter stout, I was fortunate enough to find a bottle of this  apparently it did not receive much distribution in Austin last winter. Alas, its only May and I am already wistful for cold weather and winter brews. And, an aside, what fantastic label art  Saint Arnold outside with a tankard of ale on a snowy, star-lit winter evening and flanked by evergreen boughs dusted with snow. Its not relevant to the beer, but this is my favorite label art."
"Very dark brown, if not black in hue; brunette head, smallish, fair retention, no lace. The nose is inviting, while not potent, there is a perceptible aroma of toasted malts and chocolate. Decent palate, grainy, bitter, much more roasted (contrary of the bouquets invitation), less chocolate, the hops are noticeable. The finish is long-lasting, chalky with sweetness lingering ever so gently... seems to get more acidic as it warms. The body is a touch too thin. Overall, this Stout is drinkable and pleasant, not outstanding but Im glad I had the opportunity to try it thanks Morris729."
"Bottom line, a pretty good stout."
"This is the second time i'm having this stout and it seems a bit different from the first, especially the aroma. A nutty caramel aroma is still there but a stale sour odor dominates it. The heavy roasted malt flavors hold more than their own against the slightly spicy hops. A gentle moderate carbonation gave it a nice mouthfeel but not as smooth as i had remembered. It would be more drinkable if the aroma wasn't so off. Thanks Morris729 for the sample."
"Saint Arnold Winter Stout pours with a black body (ruby in the light) with an annoyingly fast-dissipating head, characteristic of all Saint Arnold beers. The nose smells of burnt sugar, sweetened café au lait and Belgian Aromatic malts, the last of which really lends a nice aroma to this beer. Unfortunately, I poured too much of the carbonation out of this beer while trying to raise a head, so the body was a little thinner than I know it to be. The result was that the roasted malts (last time I spoke with Brock Wagner at Saint Arnold, they used no roasted barley in the Stoutchocolate and black malts only) created a slightly astringent, sour flavor in the finish. Other than that, this sweet stout was pretty enjoyable and better than Mackesons (though Saint Arnold uses no lactose)sweet, roasty smooth and uncomplex."
"Nearly black, with clear, deep burgundy hue when held to light. The initially thick head settles readily into a spotty dark tan layer. Sparse foam aggregates remain down the glass. The aroma is comprised of chocolate malt and smooth, mildly smokey roasted grain, with sweetness provided by dark caramel. Trace butterscotch. Chocolate laced, sugary sweetness hits the palate at first, then is briefly superceded by grainy tartness which quickly diminishes. Sweetness reemerges in the form of molasses-tinged brown sugar and couples with the mild chocolate malt undertone, lending token richness. Paltry hop bitterness leaves malt sweetness unhindered. Lightly bodied, passably dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes mostly clean, with a fading impression of powered glucose and cocoa. Not a particularly rich or complex stout, and somewhat one dimensionally sweet. It's cleanliness, stately roasted malt character and lack of flaws lend it good drinkability. A touch too sweet to be a great session stout. Thanks to TXhops for sending the bottle."
"Pours a dark brown, perhaps black color with garnet highlights. It produced a small tan head that was very short lived but leaves a nice layer providing a cover for the brew. Light aromas of chocolate and roasted malts smell quite nice. The flavor mirrors the smell with the chocolate being dominant followed by the roasted malt, hops, and finishes with a burnt bitter taste. This beer is too thin IMHO and it finishes just slightly dry. The mouthfeel is the only flaw that I can find but when you are not dissecting a beverage, the mouthfeel can affect the taste as in this case. It is still a pretty decent brew and since its made in Texas, Ill continue to support them. Cheers!"
"Not a bad beer at all, and definitely a drinkable and enjoyable one. But if I had to choose a stout, I would definitely go with one of the Young's stouts."
"This is an excellent seasonal stout. With hints of Christmas buried deep within. The hops and malts are blended well to give s surprisingly good finish to this beer. The head is not very creamy and is a brown foam when poured. It settles pretty quick and leaves you wondering what you just got in the way of a stout. The initial taste is surprisingly good and so is the last. An excellent and matured stout that has the harshness taken off by a proper fermentation that is not speed up."
"Pours a very dark, almost black color with a thin tan colored head that quickly dissipates. Nose is dominated by sweet roasted malts and grains with notes of toffee. Dark coffee and bitter chocolate come through in the taste. Not a great stout, but one of the better Texas brewed stouts Ive tried."
