"small head. dissipates very quickly. Not as deep black as I like when observing the stout in the glass. Smells unbelievable. Like a roast/coffeehouse. The aroma really is all there Taste is upfront stouty but really unoffensive. If youre ia stout head then this is very mild brew but still very flavorful and enjoyable. Very smooth and grainy. I really enjoy Hopworks and this stout was certainly no dissapointment."

"Smooth sweat stout with heavy coffee notes and light body, toasty oats, rye and wheats."
"I'd be curious to taste these seven grains without such a potent dose of coffee in the mix. The latter flavor is too strong, masking the other goodies that one can sense are lurking beneath."

"Served in a Spiegelau Stout glass. Appearance is a brownish-black with light tan lacing. Roasted malt on the nose. Very smooth mouthfeel, possibly from the variety of grains added. Bold taste of coffee leads to hints of chocolate malt."

"This is a solid American stout from an equally solid brewery! I honestly can't tell if there are 7 grains or 3 grains in this beer - it's delicious either way! It pours with a nice foamy head, lovely color, and definite notes of coffee. The flavor is truly satisfying - Stumptown coffee, hints of dark chocolate, and roasted malt. This is a winner in my books!"

"On tap at PreFunk. Sharp peppery taste, pours out black with small beige head. Aroma is normal stout dark malt, roast grains. Slick, slippery mouthfeel, lingering pepper/spicy finish. Spiciness is a nice touch to what is an otherwise solid stout, lip smacking good"
""
"Overall: this beer, while good at the beginning, manages to keep growing on me. It's just a delightful and drinkable stout that, while not overly complex, is well-wrought and smooth as can be. Kudos!"
""
"A decent coffee stout overall, and not too heavy or alcoholic. Easy to drink."

"An interesting quaff, and I'm glad to see the experimentation with the non-traditional fermentables. Though I think the jury's still out on the oddball grains. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Bottleworks in Seattle."
"Overall- Solid, good beer to really good beer. Different enough to be interesting but orthodox enough to accessible. I would give this a try."

"Pours dark black. No foam, clear on top. Roasted coffee nose. Dark chocolate. Smooth creamy slightly sweet, balanced bitter close. Punchy carbonatiomn for a stout. Delicious grains. Coffee. Excellent."

"Pours dark bround with a tan head, nice amount of lacing is left behind, and great head retention. The nose is heavy on coffee roast, carob, anda hint of molasses. There is a hint of roasted malt in there, but it is not pronounced. The taste is similar to the nose with bold and spicy coffee notes with an earthy quality towards the finish of the coffee. Some molasses is present and provides a bit of sweetness. Mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation. Overall, this iOS a unique coffee infused stout, the coffee shies away from cocoa and chocoalate and gears towards spicy and earthy notes."

"O- This is maybe the best stout I have ever had and one of the best beers ever. So amazingly complex, bold, flavorful, aromatic, and drinkable. Reminds me a lot of Oakshire's Overcast Espresso Stout, a personal favorite of mine. I would say the coffee is the star of the show, but there is so much else going on too."
""
""
"Bomber poured a clear reddish bown with a small lasting creamy tan head. Aromas of caramel, bakers cocoa, light vanilla and light coffee., Mouthfeel was light bodied and crisp with a dry finish which is a little off for a stout. Flavors of bakers cocoa, roasted malt,light coffee and a hint of vanilla with a crisp dry lingering roasted malt finish"
""
""
"Flavors of dark malts, sweet malts, various grains, bitter chocolate, cold coffee, slight lactose, #2 pencils, grassy hops. Overall easy drinking yet flavorful enough...lots of different tastes with emphasis on dark roasted malts."
"O: Solid coffee stout. A bit thin, a bit one dimensional."
"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, late 2012 bottling. Pours crystal clear almost opaque dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big roasted coffee beans, milk chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, caramel, oatmeal, toast, light char, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted notes with plenty of coffee presence. Taste of roasted coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, oatmeal, toast, caramel, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, oatmeal, toast, caramel, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted flavors with coffee; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent American stout style. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted and coffee flavors with the multiple grains used; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
"Poured from a 650ml bottle. Pours a dark, dark brown colour. Notes of coffee and coffee grounds predominate. There are chocolate aromas, as well. Taste pretty much follows suit. Coffee dominates, but there are also rich grainy and nutty notes, with a bit of rye bread flavour and chocolate, as well. Mouthfeel is incredibly creamy."
""
"O - It's got an appealing chocolate/coffee flavor that improves as it warms. Glad it is organic. This is right in my wife's wheelhouse with the almost-sessionable ABV and porter-like flavor. Flavor-wise, it's a solid contendor for a top spot but the thin mouthfeel detracts from the overall experience for me but not my wife."

"O: What an interesting brew. Lots of exotic grains that balance well and combine into a surprisingly decent flavor. Coffee is very strong in the aroma but it is toned down in the flavor portion quite a bit, such that it melds with all the grains instead of overpowers them. Don't expect a normal stout with this one, it's basically got lots of toasted, borderline roasty grain notes with coffee mixed in. Like a malt-heavy brown ale with coffee in a manner of speaking. Sort of a hybrid beer. Still very tasty, complex (especially for 5.3%) balanced and smooth. I enjoyed it."
""
""
"O The organic aspect is appreciated. I wish it had more of a variety in the flavor profile to balance out the earth tones. Really reminds me of a cold carbonated cup of coffee. Not a bad thing, but not what I expected. Would go great with a granola bar."
"O- I had higher expectations for a beer that looked so good, but unfortunately it didn't hold up."

" The flavor is good with nice coffee accent and mild hop bitterness with creamy malt which is toasted with some dried fruit flavor from both the coffee and yeast with nice tinge of herbal hops that balances the grain flavor which has sweet and earthy flavor that adds to the cold pressed coffee which is more cocoa-like than bitter coffee. The overall impression was a very good stout, I like the unique combination of ingredients and flavors that it brings with some nice currant and coffee in the taste."
""
""
"As a coffee beer, it fails as there are dozens of better ones in the market. As a exotic grain beer, it fairs much better as the flavor is unique."

"I really enjoyed this stout and though not something I would get all time, I will keep an eye out for it if I want a nice coffee forward stout."
"Poured a dark brown-black with a thin tan head. Roasty aroma, dark malts, bits of smoke, coffee. More of the same in the taste basically, big on the roast, dark malts, lightly toasted oats, notes of coffee and cocoa, subdued sweetness, but mostly just roastiness. Medium body with some bitterness left in the mouth. Decent overall."
""
"O: A very enjoyable beer. I'm glad I have a coouple more to enjoy."
"This is not quite what I expected, but the more I drink of it the more I like it. definitely worth checking out."
"That said, I *should* do this side by side with Peak Organic Espresso Amber...if only the two could ever be found in the same place at the same time!"
"Medium in body...I found it to be too thin for the style. Low carbonation. Not bad, but not great."
""
"o - overall a nice bold stout. the body is a bit weird and light and it feels like the ABV should be higher from the shine it leaves in my mouth (perhaps that's the grains at work?). smells pretty great and tastes solid as well. a worthwhile stout to check out for sure."
""
"Appearance is dark brown with a creamy dark tan head leaving a nice curtain of lace. Smell of sweet vanilla creamer in coffee. Taste has the roasted malt, coffee bitterness fromn the mild hop thats just enough for balance. Mouthfeel is full, goes down slick with a mild spike of carbonation. Overall a very nice enjoyable stout."

"Overall: Just and ok beer. Not sure if it is the organic ingredients or the coffee but it has a funky flavor profile"
"overall - very good coffee beer, coffee bender has a challenger !"
"Wow, this was good Stout, with those lush flavors just seeming to literally jump out of the glass here on draft. I became a big fan of Stumptown coffee during this trip, so I wasn’t surprised to find out that this ended up being finished with it, as the coffee character here was my favorite part of this. It was maybe a little too coffee heavy at times, as I really didn’t get any of the nuances from the multitude of grains used in this but whatever. Stouts this rich and flavorful are always appreciated when I find them."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 2 inch puffy tan head that settles to a thin cap. Thin foamy rings of lace mark the drink down on the sides of the glass. Smell is of brewed coffee, coffee grounds, and grain aromas. Taste is very heavy on the coffee flavor, almost like a strong coffee that some coffee grounds got into. There are also some grainy flavors but I have never had amaranth or kamut so I have no idea if these are present. Bitter coffee ground flavors stick around after each sip. A low level of carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good stout that is heavier on the coffee than the grains. Still a solid brew that I am glad I got to try."
"The appearance was a little interesting, the beer gave me pretty good lacing, not amazing though. The body looks good from the start and it still does. The one thing that kinda sucks is the foam and head on top of the body are completely gone now, and the top of the body kinda just reminds me of the mouthfeel, watery and thing. It's not a huge problem, because the overall appearance was good, but it makes it easier for me to give this beer a 4 for appearance rather than a 4.5."
"A perfect winter beer. Great coffee flavour while still being a little balanced."
"Overall a solid stout that I would defiantly seek out again if I had the chance to. I had no problem drinking the entire bomber, the ABV was on the low side and it made this beer that much easier to drink. I'm interested to see how this would taste with a year or two under its belt, but overall I enjoyed this one."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a tasty coffee stout, super big espresso flavor. I've always found this to be a very good beer, and while today's offering delivers more coffee then I'm accustomed to, I miss some of the nuance I've enjoyed in previous versions."
"O: A drinkable stout with barley, wheat, oats, amaranth, quinoa, spelt and kamut. As I have nothing to compare it to in regards to the different grains, all I can say is that it is an enjoyable beer that I would have again."
"Interesting bottle picked up in vancouver. A lot of interesting grains that yield a cerial of tastes, yet it doesn't all integrate together. Expresso and coffee so if you are a coffee drinker you probably liked this better. Dark and lacey despite a small head. big roast, above average mouthfeel of course. In a word, roasted grains."
"Aroma has tones of semi-sweet chocolate and fine roast coffee, with a very strong smoky overtone and a hint of toffee. It pours a deep, warm sable with a thick, if not overly persistent, tan head that leaves some good lacing. Smoky flavor has roast coffee and woody tones with nutty, chocolate and toffee hints. Texture is smooth and fizzy, a teensy on the watery side but still more than acceptable. If ever you are in Oregon, look for this one!"
"O - a very tasty oatmeal stout, only slight knock being the chaulkiness but that is outweighed by its drinkability and great flavours"
"Nothing earth shattering here, but this is still a very solid offering from the folks at HUB."
"O - A tasty stout and definitely worthy seeking out if its available. Nice coffee notes and not overly bitter. The coffee on the finish is quite enjoyable!"
"This is one of the better <6% stouts I've had in recent memory. It integrates the coffee extremely well as it doesn't overpower the beer. Really well done."
"GET THIS BEER, GOOD TIMES!"
"A dark black pour with a mocha coloured creamy head. The typical stout aromas of espresso, molasses and heavy roasted malts are all present. The taste however is a little lacking I find and comes off as a cold coffee. The mouthfeel is somewhat light and has a bit of a watery feel. There are some good flavours here and it is an easy drinker. Not bad but I've had better."
"D: This is my new favorite beer from HUB, excellent, I will be buying this again for sure."
"Works for me for the most part, but some of the extra grains tend to detract more than add. In fact I think the coffee and any dark malt used helps to mask the sour astringency of them if anything. Otherwise hits the spot for a dry stout."
"Overall, a decent enough stout - smooth, sure, but silky, not so much. The different grains get lost in the mire, with only the barley, wheat, and oats standing out in their typical manner. If this thing had to survive on the other four, the whole house of cards would come tumbling down. Still, drinkable and enjoyable for what it is - a brewing geek marketing gimmick."
"Overall this is a great coffee beer and a good beer overall. The lighter ABV is excellent but the coffee tends to become a bit overwhelming while attempting to finish the entire 22 oz bottle."
"I could see myself drinking this again its working well for me right now so I'd say its worth a try"
"D - Drinkability is high. Easily drank this bomber over the course of studying and it went down a lot easier than expected. Really surprising beer and wish I could get more!"
"Drinkability: Very high!"
"D- For someone that has a hard time finding stouts I like, this would rate right up there."
"Wow, what a way to take a Coffee Stout and turn it up a few notches."
"Beer is medium bodied and has a strong roastiness throughout the beer. As an extra in a recent trade I'm pretty happy with it but overall it's a strong, bitter, coffee stout. I'd have it again but it was an above average beer to me in a style that I have a hard time really getting into, I can appreciate a good example but otherwise I'm fine."
"Pours a near black color with a thin tan head and a bit of a collar as the small head settles down. The nose brings forward a pretty good amount of coffee plus a nice bit of roasted malt. Fairly-strong roast throughout. The taste carries this a bit further and is almost a bit too roasty without much else in the way of complexity. Slight coffee presence, but that's about it. Feel is pretty good with a medium body. Overall, a pretty decent beer though there wasn't anything all that special about it. I liked their IPA much more."
"D - Easily a daily drinker. Excellent flavor and too drinkable. The smell is really the star here. Incredible."
"D: This beer represents a rare achievement in the world of stouts brewed with coffee--it allows all of the coffee's contributions to deliciousness that it is capable of providing, without struggling with the acidity and astringency issues that are typical of the style. While the ""seven grain"" advertising slogan smacks of hipster marketing in the vein of Dogfish Head, one cannot help but wonder if some quality of those grains are coming together here to smooth out the harshest qualities of the coffee. Or, do the talented brewers at HUB simply hold mastery over that unruly ingredient?"
"This beer works on so many levels. Creepily drinkable, restrained ABV, coffee utilized in proper manner, simple, but elegant & brutally tasty. My first beer from Hopworks, & I'm impressed. Excellent beer, & a benchmark for those striving to make a good stout."
"Overall, a nice brew. Certainly worth trying if you see it and, perhaps, some effort to get."
"Drinkable and sessionable, but not a particularly good stout. There are a lot better and at a much more reasonable price."
"Drinkability - Definitely a smooth stout, very balanced, nothing prominent - which could also be a weakness to some reviewers. It's worth drinking, and the organic quality is a nice addition."
"D-This is a very drinkable and approachable stout."
"D: Good oatmeal stout, but a little on the lighter side. But rather nice drinker."
"Drinkability: Probably the best pure coffee stout I've ever had. I can't remember ever encountering better coffee flavors and aromas in a beer. I'd buy this again in a heartbeat."
"I'd consider this more of an imperial porter based on the mouthfeel but its pretty damn good regardless."
"Cheers!"
"HV"
"I found this to be a rather average stout. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't see why I should need to try it again."
"I dig it. Very robust, round flavor a bit more than a typical stout in some areas. I hope they do an imperial soon."
"drinkability - flavorful coffee stout, easy drinking, robust"
"D - Good drinkability, to the point it almost felt like a porter. A decent beer, one I would look to try fresh if presented the opportunity but won't hunt down again."
"In these times of gargantuan stouts, it's nice to have a delicious one under 7% that isn't an Irish dry or milk stout (for the record, I love gargantuan, irish, dry & milk stouts, so keep yr beermails to yrself touchy fanboys. $4.25 for 16 oz on cask. What mo you want for drinkability in a stout?"
"Flavor mirrors the aroma nicely, with a hint of chocolate liqueur and roasted, dark malty goodness. A bit chalky on the finish with grain husks and oat sweetness, but still nice. Medium-thin body is a bit underwhelming, but the carbonation is spot on with a creamy, smooth finish. Overall, a very tasty Stout...great flavor and supremely drinkable, even in the summer Austin heat."
"Enjoying the Survival stout after a blackout in my building (I hate it here in NoVa...). It pours a slightly translucent ruby-highlighted black-brown topped by about a finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises coffee, bitter chocolate powder, roasted malts, blackened oats, and a dash of black smoke. The taste is dominated by the roast and the coffee, with the toasted oats maintaining the darkness. It's nice and charry, without being overbearing. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, almost watery feel. Overall, a very nice, rather dark-tasting stout, without being overpowering or too thick. A very nice, very drinkable dark beast, with sessionability to boot."
"Overall this is a very good strong coffee stout that has strong flavor but is still quite smooth."
"m/d-Light bodied for a stout with a little bit of a grainy texture as it goes down. Doesn't leave a strong or bitter aftertaste. Very enjoyable if you like coffee."
"Pours coffee black with eggshell colored head. The aroma is tremendously coffee-like. Which goes well with the unexpectadly light body. It's hard to rate this beer because as I drink it I keep forgetting its a beer and thinking that I'm jst drinking a cup of coffee that's gotten cold. There is no hint of alcohol at all anywhere in the taste and this is generally very drinkable. Not my absolute favorite."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is thinner but still filled the mouth well. This is about the most drinkable oatmeal/coffee stout I have ever had. Most in this style are far heavier and harder to get through. This is a beer that I wouldn't mind starting my morning with in my coffee cup."
"Flavor...a stout with coffee! There's no surprise here, malts, barley, wheat, oatmeal, and lots of espresso! The coffee notes are dark roasted. Medium mouthfeel, carbonation is middle of the road, booze is down, doesn't have a lot of hop bitterness. Pretty drinkable, and enjoyable!"
"Hopworks Urban Brewery--HUB--Survival ""7-Grain"" Stout--Malt Beverage With Coffee Added--Sustainable Organic Beer--2010 22 oz. Bottle. 5.30% ABV. 35 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) Foamy lacy light tan head. Thin coffee black color. Light roasted coffee cocoa hop hint delicate aroma. Slightly creamy sweet silky toasted dark biscuit grain bread roasted light coffee fruit mild Stout body. Smooth refreshing mild hop dry Session Stout end. If blindfolded I do not think I would think this was a Stout. Very mild dark malt character. Seems as if color comes from coffee, not malt. Sampled 8/14/2010. 2 @ $5.99 Each."
"This brew is extremely tasty, light, and easy-drinking. The flavor is perhaps less multi-dimensional than other stouts, but for those who love coffee, don't hesitate to pick this one up."
"D: Good"
"D: Goes down OK, but I've had better stouts to drink."
"This is roasted and charred enough that 22oz goes a long way, but I really enjoyed this brew. Kudos to HUB for unique and flavor-packed stout."
"Good, mild carbonation but the bitter taste really makes this an after dinner sipper. Even if this were served in smaller bottles, I think this is a once a night beer."
"I have had this on tap and in bottles. This is reviewed from a bottle in '10. Pours a dark brown with a minimal off-white head. Nose is strong espresso and roasted malts. Taste is coffee, toffee, burnt toast, and some bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but pretty good for a standard stout. A respectable coffee stout to be sure."
"In honor of the last episode of '24', I wanted to drink a beer that summed up Jack Bauer's life: Survival. I have had this beer in my cellar for about 10 months now, since bringing it back from Portland last summer. Poured into a stemmed glass. Very heavy amount of carbonation, almost like cola. Huge tan head formed atop the jet black body. Smell was like roasted oats and espresso. Taste was excellent. Heavy grain presence. Flavors of chocolate, coffee, and roasted barley. The coffee flavor was there but did not overwhelm. It was a nice balance. This stout was not as thick on the mouthfeel as I would have expected considering the ingredients. Still, with a low abv and a great smoothness, it's an outstanding oatmeal stout. I will have to try to pick up more HUB bombers if I can find them in the Northwest on my next visit this summer."
"Poured from a bomber, this stout is pitch black with a tan head. The 7-grains are intriguing, but the star of this beer is the Stumptown espresso beans. The malt does get an unusual earthy, spicy taste from all the grains, but those beans deliver smooth java taste that reminds me of the best iced coffee I've ever had. Stout lovers looking for something different, or anyone that likes coffee beer, should check this out asap."
"22 oz bomber from Capital Market, Salem. Deepest,deepest black, black, black..wonderful frothy tan head. A thing of beauty art in a glass. Lovelly aromas, of fresh black french roast coffee, chocolate cakes,brazil nuts and cream. Taste much the same as the aroma but even more fresh dark gorgeous coffee, complex roasty ,toasty flavours assault the tongue..too many to define yet blening perfectly into a heavenly elixir. Wonderful full mouthfeel. Just a gorgeous stout..best I have had for ages"
"Pours a dark black/brown with an oatmeal colored head. Very nice lace retention. Smells of rich roasted malts, espresso, and brown sugar. The taste is wonderful with lots of espresso framed with roasted, toasted, notes; a hint of nuttyness, and a dash of chocolate. Very nicely wrapped into a beautiful package. Nice weight, balance, and texture. This baby would be blockbuster on nitro. Stunning, but a little rich and heavy for continued drinking."
"This beer pours a nice black color with no carbonation activity present after the pour. There is a nice two finger off white head that sticks around for a least half the beer. There is really no cling to the glass either. As far as the smell goes I am picking up heavy notes of roaste malts and small hints of the oatmeal. Overall a nice smelling beer, it seems to set itself apart a little from other stouts in terms of smell. In regards to the taste this is where the beer shines. It is front loaded with a roaste malt flavor that which mellows out quite nicely. A good tasting beer that makes this a must drink when available. I recieved this beer from madhombrwer as part of a Portland locals box. A very nice beer that is going down rather well."
"All-and-all I am very impressed with this beer. I am not an ""organic"" (I view it as an effective marketing tool) and thus was wary of this beer. I believe this Survival ""7-Grain"" Stout would make an excellent ""session"" beer for the winter months. I'd love to have this on tap the next time I'm in the Portland, Or area."
"this beer made me miss shizzy b throwing up in the bathroom the last time we went to portland. what a doll."
"Pours black with a light brown head. The aroma is strong coffee with some roasted malt. The flavor is strong coffee with some bitterness as well as some chocolate. You also get some nutty characteristics. Medium mouthfeel but a little more watery than I expected. Very drinkable. Great beer."
"D- Very drinkable, and goes down smooth."
"Some."
"Hopworks Urban Brewery continues to impress this BA. I've now had three of their beers and have enjoyed each and every one. If you like hoppy stouts that also include coffee, Survival ""7-Grain"" Stout will do you right. And wake you up."
"Poured deep brown to black with a tan head. The head dissipates quick, but lacing stays to the last drop. The nose has some clear coffee notes, but also an underlying earthiness. The taste is pretty complex compared to your traditonal coffee stout - I love how the coffee is present but not overly powerful (it lacks that dominating roasted espresso note). You also get some sweet molasses, brown sugar, and milk chocolate in the taste, followed by a light balance of earthy hops. The carbonation is a bit low, making it highly sessionable. Well done!"
"From a 22 oz bottle this poured a very dark brown that looked nearly black in the glass with a foamy and rocky tan head that left lacing like carpenter's glue. Nose is roasted malts with aromas of chocolate, coffee, and grains. Very smooth and velvet mouthfeel. The flavor is malty but there are a lot of complex nuances in there making this a top flight stout."
"This was very good stout and is worth seeking out."
"- Huge marks on drinkability... the flavor is great, and the mouthfeel is great... I could sit and drink this stuff all day."
"Drinkability: Somewhere, in a secret, candlelit room, the uninvited, unwelcome Rye Grain sits alone brooding. From floor to ceiling, the walls are plastered with iStockphoto.com stills of the various grains all X'ed out with bright red lipstick. This won't, this cannot end well. Survival Stout, with its wide array of various grains and added cold-pressed espresso presents a rich, inviting complexity and yet there's a very, very sensible ABV%. Recommended!"
"This is a great stout! Perfectly balance, well crafted brew. Sells for a decent price, this will be a staple stout in my fridge."
"22 oz. Dark black/brown pour with some translucentcy to it. Small tan head that disappated fairly quickly to a ring. Subdued roast malt and coffee aromas. Taste is much more impactfull. Good roast malt and grain, quite a bit of coffee throughout. Accents of dark chocolate, maybe some oatmeal, more rye likeness. Medium body, nice carbonation, almost creamy. Finish is lingering coffee. Aroma becomes more pronounced as it warms. Very drinkable. Not sure I'd call it oatmeal, but a very nice stout none the less."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a very nice coffee note, toffee/caramel. The taste is slightly sweet/bitter, malty, with lots of coffee notes, with toffee/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, my first from this brewery, thanks Brian."
"D: I happen to really like this one, nice work Hopworks. As my glass heads toward room temperature thing get even tastier"
"Overall: delicious, well done, and interesting. I can't say how all the unique grains specifically contribute, but the end product is great."
"Survival has smooth contours all around. It is an ale of irrepressible character - aggressive yet agreeable. Highly recommended."
"Overall I am looking forward to trying this one at the brewery."
"Very drinkable, quite sessionable for a stout. Very impressive for all organic ingredients. Well done, HUB!"
