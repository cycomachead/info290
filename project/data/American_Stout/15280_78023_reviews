"My personal favorite from Atwater.  Very silky smooth feel because of the low carbonation.  Sweet dark chocolate aromas make the mouth water!  Great taste from start to finish.  Your typical sweet, not bitter, dark chocolate taste turns almost into a root beer-ish middle, and finishes smooth with more cocoa tastes.  Wonderful beer from a wonderful town."

""

"Overall I would definitely try again, a solid enjoyable beer."
""
"Great visual and aroma. Flavor is a little disappointing. It's not as smooth and it lacks body. However, chocolate flavor does come through nicely in the after taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Look and smell are excellent. Taste is disappointing.  Lacks depth and is over carbonated. Two parts soda water and one part Hershey's syrup about sums it up."
"Just an amazing brew. Easy drinker."
""
""
""
"I enjoy it but if you dont like chocolate forget this beer."
""
"O: lots of carbonation almost like carbonated chocolate drink with slight vodka burn off"
"Delicious chocolate ale. Tastes like a chocolate bar."
"If you want a true chocolate stout this is the one. Tons of true chocolate and caramel flavors coming though. Wonderful carbonated yet creamy mouthfeel. Nice thin head and lacing retained throughout. Really nice in a tulip glass on a winter day. Will pick up again when I can find it."
""
"Pours a dark brown with khaki colored head. Smells like a brownie or chocolate cake, tastes like it too. I like."
""
""
""
"O - It absolutely delivers on the name.  Heavy chocolate eclipses most other characteristics.  As an exercise of how to amplify chocolate smells and tastes, the exercise is interesting, but ends up feeling a bit one-noted.  That is a significant detraction for a beer, even with the spot-on chocolate hit it delivers."
"Overall, not too great. It has chocolate yes, but that's about all it has, and the mouth/body and base malt beer are just sooo thin and watery. It def could have benefited from some oats or creamy feel in general, or even just more body from the malts."

"Magical things happen when you mix this 50/50 with their vanilla java porter. Tastes like ice cream."

"Mouth feel: Smooth, soft, quite pleasant."
"o: A very drinkable and quite tasty brew, although perhaps too lightweight to justify being called ""Decadent.""   An enjoyable holiday time and/or colder weather beverage."
""
""
"Overall, it's a very ""OK"" beer. It isn't quite remarkable in any way, and I think Young's Chocolate Stout beats this in most categories, even if it's a different style. If you're looking for a chocolate stout, definitely go with Young's over this one. If you're looking for something new to try, I recommend trying something else."

"If you want to drink a Hershey's bar, this is your beer. Very good for a novelty drink. Super chocolatey, although one of my friends tasted coffee (not an afficionado - probably the roasted malts). You aren't going to want to drink it all night. Order one for shits and giggles and then let it go... you've tried it. And you can tell all of your friends. Sort of like that banana bread beer."

"Most accurate label I've seen. Just smelling gives you a good idea how strong the chocolate flavor is, and actually drinking is a bit overwhelming the first time around."
""
"It is what it says it is... delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown and opaque with ruby highlights and a beige head of frothy foam that settles quickly.  Rich aroma of cocoa and dark malt.  Flavors of sweet cocoa upfront, morphs to coffee and marshmallow, notes of cola.  Dry and tannic, slightly puckery and talcy.  Average beer."
""
""
""
""
"If you like Hershey syrup, this is your beer.  All other notes are average at best"
""
""
""
""
""
"If you like chocolate stouts like I do, you'll love this one. One of the best I've ever had."
""
""
""
"Fav Atwater beer"
" The flavor has a good cocoa flavor with mildly sweet  taste and light toasted malt flavor with very light sweetness and yeast in taste. The cocoa carries a light woody accent w/ mostly dry flavor in the finish. Overall a pretty decent chocolate flavor, not as stout as it could be but it is certainly above average w/ enough cocoa to redeem the lack of malt somewhat."
""
"Black pour with a small tan head. Big chocolatey aroma. Taste follows the nice with chocolate upfront that has a combination of dark chocolate, milk chocolate and light bittersweet flavors. Also has additional flavors of light espresso and roasted malt and cocoa. Medium bodied but drinks very easy. Finishes lightly sweet and chocolatey."
""

"Not what I expected tastes like diet yahoo. Tastes really flat and plain. This brewery usually puts out really solid stuff.."

"This brew is extremely dark, with reddish highlights when held to the light. The head is tan and fairly this. A brilliant chocolate and malt aroma dominates the beer. Reminiscent of a chocolate malted mild in the smell, it is an engaging and enticing aroma. The taste is balanced, and not as sweet as I expected. Flavorful. It has a mildly toasted and breads character, as well as the chocolate. Somewhat chalky. Full in body and good."
""
""
""
"This beer is over the top! The only way i could express the pleasure is to compare it to a night on the beach with a beautiful woman (m wife), a fine cigar,, a fine beer, and soft music off in the distance. How could I better express my satisfaction?"
""
"This had a pleasant cola-like feel, but this seemed more like a Schwarzbeir lager. It didn't seem to have the full ale flavor. It had a bright finish. Maybe I'll try another though."
"O - Good beer, very little chocolate, more toasty malt, well balanced"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's cola-like finish is a far cry from the promising upstart of lavishness, silkiness or velvety texture that the nose and early taste promises. Light, perhapse thin and on the verge of watering, the beer's structure falls flat and gives its taste a cola-like finish. And that's unfortunate because its upstart is so, so promising."
"Pours very dark deep brown with scarce foam on top. Deep dark chocolate nose, malty and sweet. Taste is on the lighter side. Chocolate. Falls a little flat though and off the mark. Not enough bitter. Just ok."

"Final Grade: 3.84, a B+. Atwater Brewery's Decadent Dark Chocolate Ale delivers as advertised - anyone looking for an affordable, sessionable chocolate stout should consider giving this one a try. My only real complaint with this one is the weak mouthfeel, but other than that it's getting the job done. Tasty stuff; I'll have to keep an eye out for more Atwater products in the future."

"Big thanks to Adam for gifting me this and other Michigan beers. the beer is near black (the lighting was low) with a small tan head. This beer is all about the chocolate. The scent and the flavor are rich, dark, chocolates. A hint of espresso bean, cocoa. medium bodied with a light sweetness. perhaps I was in a chocolate mood. This was delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Was a big fan of the ""bottled on"" date at the bottom of the sticker. Got a fairly old batch (bottled Jan, 2014) but it was still good beer."
""
""
""
"Dark brown color, no head. Has an amazing dark chocolate smell, but the taste is underwhelming. Despite the promise of the aroma, I got very little in terms of flavor. Has a watery feel. The taste is strongly reminiscent of a weak Dr. Pepper. Palate is strongly carbonated and comes off a little too harsh."

"Dark, rich color with red undertones, but when you drink it, it doesn't feel heavy or thick. I like the subtle bubble, almost like soda, but not too much carbonation so it's still smooth and not airy. The aroma of dark chocolate is stronger than the flavor (unfortunately), and the after taste is a bit bitter, which takes away from upcoming sips, so the first swallow is the best. I would enjoy this beer as a snack or dessert rather than with a meal because it is so delicious on its own merit. It's bright enough that you can drink several and not get tired or overwhelmed by its sweetness. Atwater Brewery can claim a degree of pride despite the low reputation of Detroit. My only other suggestion is a slightly higher alcoholic content. If you're looking to enjoy such a wealth of flavor and texture, you might as well get a buzz while you're at it. :)"

"I could like this beer. But at every step, I'm left wanting more. More flavor, more richness, more body. It's not bad, it's just not enough."
""

"Dark Chocolate Ale pours a black color with a very small head. There is a strong dark semi-sweet chocolate flavor. The taste has a semi-sweet dark chocolate flavoring. Very nice bold chocolate flavors, and very easy to drink, with a nice body. Overall WOW, a very strong dark-chocolate bomb."
"Very Interesting Pick---- J"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Interesting and somewhat complex. Not overdone with chocolate so you could have a few, just as if you were drinking a straight-forward stout. Worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall the nose is the best aspect here, fresh, strong and powdery, the flavor falls off a bit, decent but a bit disappointing when compared to the nose, and the mouthful is okay, but could of been more lush and full. Drinks more like a milk stout imho with a nice chocolate aspect."
"O: solid brew. Kind of like the bud light of american chocolate stouts . Liked it!"
""
""
""
""
"That was about it for the positives. Somehow all the wonderful chocolatey elements were strictly limited to the smell and none are evident in the taste. There's a slight malt character, with a the barest hint of the chocolate that was so ""decadent"" in the smell, and after that... nothing. It literally tastes like a watered down version of itself, or what I expected based on the intoxicating smell. Just bland, slightly sour, not decadent in the slightest. The mouth feel is similarly poor, just thin and weakly carbonated with no body. It really feels like drinking a Killian's or Bud that had slight chocolate flavor added. As it warms, instead of the flavor opening up, it just gets bland and kind of gross. I'd drink this over something like PBR but what's the point? If not for the delicious aroma, this beer would be a total waste of money. When you consider that a four pack of this costs the same as Founders Breakfast Stout or some of the excellent New Holland High Gravity Series (here in Michigan at least) there is absolutely no reason to buy this."

"Dark cola hue nearly black with ruby highlights, thin tan head texture seems a bit flimsy for a big chocolate stout. Aroma is sick with chocolate syrup, perfume laden caramelized sugars, with a hint of roasted coffee. It could induce diabetes just by smelling it, but seriously the perceived sweetness on the nose if off the charts think Hershey syrup. Flavor how does that sweetness the nose derives to the senses play out on the palate? Actually somewhat balanced think dry cocoa powder in a very much bitter dark roasted base stout, enough creamy bitterness with a bit of lactose and coffee roasts pleasantly blends the flavor into something much more enjoyable than the initial aromatics. Expansive creamy dark chocolate fades away to let the lactose milk sugars take stride, leaving a bit of an interesting creamy texture to the medium to full bodied stout. Carbonation level is natural and smooth on the palate finishes pretty clean with minimal acrid notes of acidity from the dark notes. Overall a complex stout that I was thinking was going to be a train wreck, ended up being pretty much a win in my book. Only 2.50 for a single definitely worth the experience but in truth I'm glad I didn't invest any more, it doesn't seem to be the type of beer that I would drink in number."
"Decent little beer. Good flavor. Worthy."
""
"This ale pours a nice dark brown, almost black, with very little head or lacing. Smell is chocolate first and foremost, a hint of bread, and not much else. Heavily, harshly carbonated. Taste begins as chocolate soda; the only clue I have that this is beer is at the finish, which is thin and watery with some nondescript beer flavor. The chocolate flavor reminds me of chocolate NECCO wafers. I've had chocolate stouts that were much better. This tastes more like soda than beer to me. Won't be drinking this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes very similar, if not exactly, like the Vanilla Java Porter that Atwater also makes. This flavor was great excellent - you can sense a medium coffee taste hinted with a vanilla creamer. I would rank this in my top 5 because it's such a great combination of everything intertwined together. I could drink this pretty steady. Est. 168 calories per bottle at 5.5% ABV."
""
""
"Overall: Delivers on the promised chocolate, but sweet balance, thin body, and a lack of complexity limit its appeal. Still, woth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is not as good as it should be, but the misclassifying does not help. I guess you do have to call it something, and I don't know what it should be called. American dark ale with flavoring maybe."

"The only thing that keeps this from being an outstanding beer is the mouthfeel. At the same time I've come to like it for the same reason. Like others have said, it's a little watery but comes off as refreshing to me and goes down great on a hot day. I think I may have stumbled on a ""sessionable"" stout. It may not satisfy the need for a nice, hefty, dessert beer but might cure the urge for stout on a summer day without the ""big"" beer commitment."
""
"Definitely chocolatey! A dessert of a beer. Would be more pleasant without that mid palate character and the cola notes. Too charred for my liking."
""
"Mild head, maybe half a finger of deep tan which is gone lickety-split, not much stick in the lacing which is more of a thin, slippery sheet than anything else. While the liquid is pure black it doesn’t seem “impenetrably dense” for effect’s sake, thin aura of yellow around the rims, there you can see a blip of carbonation. The nose is extremely creamy, maple syrup, molten milk chocolate, caramel, coffee ice cream, malted milk balls, light cherry fruit, not overtly sugary nor is it lacking posture, simply a one trick pony. It’s light to medium-bodied in the mouth and drier than expected based on the nose, tighter punch to the carbonation too. The chocolate, cocoa, coffee, malt flavors are all there, however, they lack resonance and depth. More grains and oats and a dried to blanched nuttiness as well. Here there’s some herbal hoppy kick. Any fruit gets cloaked by the roast, minor cherry, plum at best. Tacky character, dries onto your tongue. Plenty of retronasal cocoa powder. Unfortunately it is sort of lifeless and turns watery at the end. Ehh, what can you do."
""
""
""
""
"O: A bit thin for a heavy chocolate stout, but it's not bad. Would I buy again? Probably not, but it's definitely not bad."
""
"For dark chocolate lovers this is the beer you want! Have tried many chocolate beers in the past and Atwater hit it head on. Actually walked into this one blindly having only tried a few other beers by Atwater. starting to become a huge fan of this brand."
""
"Overall: Tasty, sort of a gimmicky beer that I probably won't buy a six pack of. That being said it was an interesting experience that got old a bit fast. The nose is definitely its strongest attribute but the thin mouthfeel and relative lack of complexity are definitely its weaknesses. That being said its not a terrible beer so if you're thinking about trying one in a mix-a-six, I definitely encourage you to try it."
"Very enjoyable, and this has to be my favorite beer from Atwater, which is a brewery that tends to underwhelm me. If the feel on this one were to be a little bit creamier, and the aftertaste was more like the taste is on the front, this could be my favorite chocolate-forward stout. Regardless, a shockingly tasty beer... and the price is right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the strongest aspect of this beer was its aroma. This showed big chocolates, brown malts, sugars, vanillas, and general sweetness, certainly deserving of the title of “decadence”. Where we lost points was through the end of the sip, where the flavoring was almost entirely washed out with watery grain, affecting not only the taste, but also the feel. Atwater has continued to disappoint us in cohesion and final execution of their styles, so I guess we’ll have to wait for the next one in hopes of finding something that is worth coming back to."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of chocolate milkshake, sweet, some hints of vanilla. Taste is very chocolatey, roasted malts, some vanilla, sweet and tasty, lots of flavor here. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a quality beer worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this beer. It is not the best chocolate Ale (the label does not say stout but says Ale) but i think it is good. Not exactly what I normally want in a chocolate brew, but this is an easy drinking beer that I could use as a session beer. I will get again."
""
"Overall – Not bad, but from the nose I was expecting much more in the taste and the feel, which it fell somewhat short of. Worth a try, but not the best out there."
"Overall: Promise unfulfilled - after a very nice start, the chocolate was not sustained and ultimately the beer was a disappointment"
"Malt beverage just sounds... wrong somehow, like Old English 800 or Zima."
"Overall this was much better that I expected that it would be, with really enjoyable chocolate flavors and notes which mix well with the roasted malts, coffee and vanilla notes. An easy drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - A pretty good beer, which I do recommend at least trying. If nothing else, the chocolate presence is nice, if you're like me, and absolutely love chocolate and beer, and the two together. Just be prepared to be a little disappointed, because this beer had the potential to be great."

"Excellent brew. I recommend grabbing it, but to be enjoyed in limited quantities as they flavor might wear on you after one or two."
"On a side note, I would like to note that this could match up amazingly with a nice cigar!"

"The Decadent Dark Chocolate Ale is a very interesting beer. The beer poured an opaque black with thin off-white head that is leaving some lacing. The smell is unbelievable...sweet dark chocolate is pronounced. The taste has some chocolate....but would definitely want more...cocoa powder is present. The mouthfeel is a bit lacking....would really like a more creamy body. Overall thou it was amazing...thanks to my BRO IN LAW!!!!"
"The nose on this one is a very good advertiser. Unfortunately, the rest of the beer doesn't live up to things. Kind of chalky with cocoa or something. Doesn't mesh well with the beer at all. Meh. This is looking quite like a waste of money and something I don't want to finish."
""
"I got a cap of a finger of dense, deep-tan head with good retention from my pour. Color was a deep, dark-brown allowing zero light penetration. Nose smelled like a liquid chocolate bar. I have to admit that I have been underwhelmed by some previous Atwater offerings, but this was showing real promise. Mouthfeel was thin, especially for a stout, but the taste was very chocolaty, although not what I would have expected from dark chocolate. Were they referring to the color? Hmmm. It was quite sweet, but still very chocolaty. Finish remained very sweet and this would be a dessert beer for me. Not bad, but not great, either."

"O: I'm let down here. The smell started off pretty strong, but it was all downhill from there. There are better options out there, even if this 6er was right around $10."
""
"Good stuff here. Nice to have a stout that is flavored with chocolate that is sessionable. Good stuff here."
"Highly drinkable and tasty. A really nice winter-time change of pace brew for me."
""
""
""
"O - A decent beer, I would recommend trying it once or twice after a meal. Definitely a fall to winter beer. I havent had many Atwater brews and this one doesnt turn my opinion either way."
""
""
"O - I had high hopes, so I am a little disappointed, but it was an interesting beer to try. This isn't a very drinkable beer by itself, but I feel like it would be a treat if it is paired well with something else. For some reason, ham with pineapple comes to mind as a good complement to this beer's flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a nice extremely dark opaque brown. Poured a practically non-existent head. Aroma was a very rich milk chocolate, slightly over sweet. Taste was a sweet chocolate up front before shifting to a slightly smokey flavor with a bit of bitterness. Felt ok in the mouth. A bit of chew, slightly thick, coated well, but no carbonation at all. Overall not bad, but a few notches short of what it could be."
""
"This is terrible. I like maple syrup but a) I was expecting chocolate and b) that's a nasty back end. That's yucky two ways."
""
""
""
""
"D -- Nice brew from Atwater. Defintely worth a try and very appropriate for late autumn / early winter. Worth a pickup for a holiday meal ender."
"O- Good beer very desert esk but easy to drink. I would recommended giving it a try the chocolate isn't overwhelming like some other chocolate ales"
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was an ok and an average example of a Chocolate Stout, it was going in the right direction when it came to the aroma but when it came to the taste is felt like a watered down version of the aroma and that was a bit of let down. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down pretty smooth, but the flavors would wear on me quickly so I think one would be enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it was nice and dominated by chocolate syrup, the appearance was also wasn't that bad. What I liked least about this beer is how watery it tasted and felt, this beer would be much better if the body was much thicker. I don't think I would buy this beer often, I would much rather have their Vanilla Java Porter, but it is worth trying once to see where you stand with it. All in all I thought this beer had a flavor that's pretty similar to Vanilla Java Porter, but the aroma was dominated by chocolate syrup, it was ok, but it's nothing I feel the need to drink again anytime soon. This was a decent attempt by Atwater but when it came to flavor and mouthfeel it fell short, better luck next time guys."
"Overall, this is a successfully drinkable chocolate ale."
"O - not bad but not good enough to break into the rotation."
""
""
""
"Overall finally a beer from Atwater that I actually enjoyed! It's no Southern Tier Chocolat but it fills the need for chocolate flavored beer."
""
"Very nice! Flavors are richer than those of Southern Tier's Choklat and there's a better balance here. I wonder if the ABV affects such flavors?"
""
"Overall - Delicious. At first I thought it more of a ""dessert"" beer--the kind where you have just one. By the time I the first though, I found myself wanting another and even a third after that. I will definitely be seeking this beer out in the future."
""
""
"Overall: The ""dark"" chocolate seems a bit forced. I've had several other stouts with a more natural and better quality cocoa flavor. The aroma had my hopes sky high, but the taste didn't quite come though."
"I really like this beer. Probably the best chocolate beer I've had. I would gladly buy it again and would recommend it. I can't say I've ever had a chocoalte beer as well balanced as this one. Kudos."
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled January 2012. Pours slightly hazy dark brown color with a small 1 finger light tan head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, vanilla, cream, and a touch of herbal hops. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, caramel, toffee, biscuit, and herbal hops. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of roasted malt, caramel, toffee, vanilla, chocolate, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Not as much chocolate in the taste as I was hoping, but there is a good flavor balance. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish present. Overall this is a nice, pleasant, and enjoyable brew from Atwater. Very smooth and drinkable as well."
""
""
"Overall one of the best chocolate ales I have had. This brewery has exceptional chocolate stouts, I am glad they transferred that knowledge to an ale."
"Overall, not too bad. Good to try."
""
""
"What a treat. I thought this was going to be a huge, sweet beer like the Southern Tier Blackwater series but this is quite the opposite. All the flavors of chocolate, cream and vanilla are present without the diabetic shock coming with it. Glad I got to try this one out, worth seeking out to try."
