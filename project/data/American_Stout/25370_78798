After sampling the flavor, I find it to be very full for only a 5.3% ABV beer... It's big with coffee, dark chocolate, and vanilla bean flavor. It's got a creamy finish and a pleasantly soft mouth feel. Overall, a fine balance of toasty, bitter, and sweet! I'm glad I tried it, as I hadn't heard of the brewery before - would definitely buy again.","Neorebel","Beers"

Smooth drinking with a low ABV, this stout punches well above its weight given its price point and relative obscurity compared to similar stouts with more name recognition.  I'd rate this beer a couple of points higher on the basis of those two factors alone.  But focusing on what this stout brings to the table, it is highly affordable, highly delicious, and all from a tallboy can.  Recommended.","Buschyfor3","Aug 24, 2014"

I like this beer but I don't know if it was a too-chilled can or just mental on my part but there was a touch of medicinal/metallic ""canniness"" or something that caused some of the sips to be bitter and watery.

Impressively black though, with absolutely no light getting through. Rich chocolate and coffee bean aromas front and center, lactose creaminess, caramelized sugar, and some mellow vanilla blended into everything. Kind of pipe tobacco-y as it warms up. Roasted malty flavor...coffee with cream and sugar, vanilla bean, tobacco, plenty of bittersweet chocolate, and nuts. Light on the carbonation, creamy texture, a little dry char developing as I sip it. Would make a nice dessert beer, though many wouldn't even consider a 5.3% ABV stout to do the job.

I was hoping to get some more later on but the store said it didn't sell that well and they didn't plan on ordering anymore. Bummer. Well today was a good day as it just happened to show up again on the shelf! Apparently the distributor made a deal the store could not refuse. For such a low alcohol content this beer is a really really big beer. I disagree that with another reviewer who thought it was 'thin'. It truly is motor oil. I'm thinking this stuff is darker than any of the imperial stouts I've tried (and I've tried more than a few). It's characteristics are pretty simple -- chocolate and vanilla -- and I'm OK with that. Tastes yummy. Not allot of crazy things going on like a high alcohol imperial stout but no mini-hangover the next day either from having two of these. Nothing else like this out there (as far as I know). A truly unique beer but more of a niche taste not for everyone.","joebeerdude","Nov 02, 2013"

3.93,1.6,4,4,3.75,4.25,4,"The Crack reveled yet another brimful craft CAN and as a previous reviewer mentioned, not only are you definitely NOT getting gypped, it is like a Baker's Dozen. The only drawback in this instance is that it is a very dark beer and if it splashed on white or colorful clothing, it might be an issue. I recommend opening it away from the CANsumer's body as a result. The tallboy nature of the CAN made it a little more difficult to perform an inverted Glug, but as a professional, I was able to pull it off. I was faced with a finger of dense, deep-tan/light-brown head with decent retention. Color was a deep, dark, cola-brown which allowed for zero light penetration. I even took a wee dram in a fest tasting glass outside to see if I could get any traction and even then, only at the edges. The SRM on this one must be extremely high. Nose smelled like French Vanilla coffee, reminding me to pick up some of Giant Eagle's brand the next time I am near one. To quantify, there were roasty notes of coffee and chocolate but with vanilla added to the equation. I have never made (or drank) a full pot of French Vanilla coffee as it tends to be too sweet, but I am pressing on with this one. Mouthfeel was medium with an oily slickness on the tongue that I had not expected. Previous reviewers had led me to expect a fullness which was not present, but neither was there anything wrong with that slick feeling. The taste was definitely French Vanilla coffee and I recommend a name change to ""Finch Vanilla Stout", but I will understand if the brewers disregard my suggestion. Finish had a dryness that left a powdery feeling in the back of my throat, like dehydrated beer, just add water. This was a very different stout than what I was used to or even expected. I would probably stop at one as a self-avowed hophead, but that is just me. The fact that it is available in CANs makes it a bonus.","woodychandler","Jun 04, 2013"

Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, coffee, toast, vanilla, toffee, cream, light floral, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted malt notes with moderate creamy vanilla; with good strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, toast, vanilla, toffee, cream, and roasted earthiness. Slight coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, light char, toast, vanilla, cream, and toffee on the finish for a while. Really great balance and complexity of roasted malt flavors with moderate creamy vanilla; with huge robustness and no cloying flavors present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent vanilla cream stout! Great flavor complexity and balance with big robustness; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 15, 2013"

It has a thick, medium-roast coffee colored head that erupts quickly from the pour and then settles down rather quickly. No light penetration at all. The smell was quite aromatic. It was a nice compliment of roasted malt and milky sweetnes. There was a nice subtle, not overly dramatic vanilla edge to the smell as well. It was equal parts roasted coffee beans and milk chocolate on the nose. No real hops on the nose. If lactose can have a smell, it was in this beer. The taste was rather good. It was quite swet and very smooth with the very mildest of a bittering hop to keep it reined in. For the most part though, it had all the nice flavor of a glass of chocolate milk. It was quite sweet with a nice roasted quality to it. The vanilla seemed to work synergistically with the lactose to create a strong sweetness. The mouthfeel, therefore came off as a little bit cloying. No alcohol on the tongue, good full body, but that sweetness just ended up lingering longer than I would have liked.","estlinska","Apr 14, 2013"

Front of the sip is a bit of dark fruits (?) for sweetness, but then there's pretty much nothing but malty, chocolate goodness until the end. As the beer warms up, the beer seems to get a tad bit more bitter, and the vanilla comes out a LITTLE more, but I notice a lot of people complaining about the vanilla in it. To be honest, I don't really get much at all (at least when it's cold)... and that disappoints me. It's there in a subtle way, but I actually wanted a little bit more.

This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth and the flavors held my attention, but the high amount of sweetness would prevent me from wanting another one, one pint is the right amount for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty awesome with tons of nice chocolate and roasted aromas that mixed perfectly with the vanilla, I was impressed. What I liked the least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness, I think if it was toned down just a little bit it was help the roast balance it out better. I would buy this beer again, I would like to take a couple cans on my next ski trip, I think this would be the perfect beer to have in the warming hut and share with friends after a morning full of skiing, and the fact that it comes in cans makes it that much better, I recommend this to anyone who loves stouts, especially Sweet and Milk Stouts. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I didn't know what to expect from this brewery but this turned out to be a good beer and they made a pretty good first impression on me, they crammed a lot of flavor into a beer that is fairly light on the alcohol, I will for sure be on the look for more beers from them, good job guys.","StoutHunter","Dec 29, 2012"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Gonna see if my pre-wedding Friar Tuck's run pays off here: This stuff pours a stark matte black topped by a finger (at most) of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, mild vanilla, and a touch of dark chocolate powder. The taste brings in more of the same, though the dark chocolate comes across as sweeter, and the vanilla comes through stronger, bolder, with more of a bean character than before. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, this turned out to be a solid stout, easily the best thing I've had from Finch's. If only they could replicate the success, bring it over to their other brews...","TMoney2591","Jun 07, 2012"

3.88,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch brown head that stays around for a while. There's a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is a bit light, but still nice. The brew smells like bittersweet and milk chocolate, vanilla, roasted malt, and a little bit of coffee. The taste is just like the aroma, but I think it's stronger in comparison to the aroma. Also, I think this is more of a sweeter stout as the milk chocolate and vanilla flavors are stronger than the other ones are. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with good carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, it's definitely worth a try at $5.99 a bomber.","bluejacket74","Apr 11, 2012"
3.64,-5.9,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours dark in color. No head at all. A thin film on top is all that resembles a head. Smells sweet with vanilla notes. Some chocolate to which is nice! Flavor is sweet as well. Roasted malts and chocolate up front. Vanilla comes in and takes over pretty quick. Lacks a punch you expect from a stout, but the vanilla is very nice and makes up for it. Medium body, a little on the thin side for a stout. This is very easy to drink. I like stouts with a little more flavor though. Still a very nice vanilla stout.","HosP","Mar 30, 2012"
2.8,-27.6,3,3,2.5,3,3,"pours thick and oily lookin, but a lack of head and lacing doesnt set this apart from anything else. smell is some chocolate with a hint of vanilla, kinda sweet like a milk stout. taste is prety plain for a stout with, i hate to say it cause i dont know for sure, but it tastes like imitation vanilla. mouthfeel is thinner than it looks and kinda oily. goes down easy but could use carbonation. overall this is a standard example of a stout. nothing spectacular, but nice and easy to drink at only 5.3%.","match1112","Mar 26, 2012"

Up to this point Finch's beer offers have not been impressive, but this beer is seriously the real deal! I hope that Finch's will consider making this beer a year around offering and put it in canned format instead of bomber format. Must try if you like vanilla in stouts. 3 final words: Flavorful Session Stout!","4DAloveofSTOUT","Mar 17, 2012"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Creamy light feel, light earthy chocolate bitterness. Not much vanilla, but plenty of dark chocolate and some earthy hop bitterness. Dry roasty aftertaste, light bitterness and lingering chocolate traces. Not overly sweet, balanced with just the right amount of chocolate and mellow hops. A rich and flavorful stout, better than most/all of Finch's output thus far.","emerge077","Feb 26, 2012"

3.85,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer pours a medium bodied chocolate brown with no head and just a slight lacing around the glass. It smells of roasted malts, bitter baking chocolate, and light coffee. I don't pickup any vanilla though. It's smooth and what to be expected. The flavors give off a light roast, nice milk chocolate, mild bitterness, with a touch of creamy sweetness, yet not necessarily vanilla. It is pretty good though. It drinks medium in body and is very smooth. It drinks nicely and leaves a slight bitter chocolate flavor behind in the after taste. Overall this is a solid stout and worth trying, especially in the under $7 price range.","aasher","0"
