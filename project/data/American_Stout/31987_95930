Taste is old bitter coffee that tastes stale.  There is no canned date.  Not sure if the beer is old, but that's on the brewer to date if this beer does go bad or fade.  The thinness of the body really makes it hard to call this a stout.","PHBoiler","Jan 12, 2015"

Nice soft vanilla notes round out the chocolate.  The feel is way more porter than stout. Fizzy charcoal, and although the low point of the brew, still an easy drinker. Very impressive beer.

The taste has loads of coffee, but it’s not overbearing.  There is some roasted barely on the back end. Interestingly, this is first time I’ve had a beer in which the mouth feel was a major-contributor to the overall rating.  It had a nice, medium milky mouth feel that complemented the flavors perfectly.  The beer is not incredibly complex, but delicious all the same. It’s just a fantastic beer.","thomda11","Sep 13, 2014"

I drank this beer over two highly regarded imperial stouts because I didn't want an entire bomber at the time. Delicious late night or cold weather brew.

3.76,-6.2,3.75,4,3.75,3.25,3.75,"16oz can poured into pint glass. Pours a cola brown with fizzy head that disappears rapidly. The nose is heavy roasted coffee with a touch of oatmeal and biscuit, not a whole lot else. The taste is similar. Pretty one dimensional, heavy coffee roast, a bit of cream and not much else. Wish there was more of a malt backbone here. The oatmeal is definitely present and brings a cream like component to the beer. The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. This is an easy drinking coffee stout. This would be a good ""summer stout"" as it features some nice roasty flavors but drinks very light and is refreshing.","homebrew311","May 11, 2014"

Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of coffee and dark/roast malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, fresh coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, oats, and roasted earthiness.

Fantastic balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roast malt and coffee flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding coffee stout. All around awesome balance and robustness of fresh coffee and dark/roast malt flavors; and very smooth to drink.

Light cream and earthy hop round out the aroma. Roasty earthy coffee grounds with a huge bitter edge and a touch of cream make up the flavor. Pretty straight forward, possibly a bit one sided. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a bitter roasty ashy mouthfeel. I enjoyed the first few sips of this, but as my glass warmed it got harder and harder to finish the pint. The coffee and bitter roast is over the top on this especially at warmer temps. There needs to be more malty sweetness to back up the coffee bite here imho.","johnnnniee","Nov 16, 2013"
