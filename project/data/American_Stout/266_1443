Hints of coffee, very smooth and slithers down your throat. Smells very robust like a porter and I sense a smoky smell as well. Just going by taste, it would be good with ice cream or some chocolate dessert. The mouth feel is good although at clocking in at 6.5% abv, it could use a little more alcohol to enhance the taste and even out the robust creamy coffee flavor. Great for the average stout hound.","austin_page","Sep 03, 2013"

This is a DARK beer. Very tough to get any light through it. A nice chocolately, malty scent that is just right. Everything about this beer is tempting. Poured it, looked at it, smelled it, and was dying to taste it. This is what beer drinking is about. A percentage point or two of alcohol higher would of made this a total winner but who's to complain? I guess I'll just have to drink more than one. aftertaste lingers a bit longer than i would like and gets a bit sour on the tongue but the taste is good enough to sustain the linger. well worth the price!","faulkster4","Apr 27, 2013"

Smell is complex with caramel malts, eathy hops, black licorice, stale coffee and burnt wood which all blend to near perfection. Tastes of more caramel malts with a good addition of hops right behind for more near perfection in the balance department. Goes down smooth and creamy with a slight crispness at the end.

I literally watched the head disappear before my eyes more quickly than any I can remember. A nice aroma of chocolate malts in the nose, coffee hints in the background. Definitely an appetizing smelling stout, in the classic sense, just strong, dark malt. Taste is even better, extremely strong chocolate flavor, but a purely malt based chocolate. The flavor does not end there, as coffee and a slight bitterness add a nice blend to the back-end of the flavor. A nice full mouthfeel, without any alcohol heat makes this a highly drinkable stout.

A nice bitterness rounds things out and balances the light sweetness, a touch of coffee and dark fruit. Nice, thick, and creamy mouthfeel.

Perfect balance of flavor and roasted barley. Thick and chewy in the mouth, but easy to drink. Even more flavor erupted as it warmed to room temp. Could sit all night and enjoy one, or have a couple because the flavor was so good and it was so easy to drink.

The nose is perhaps too dense itself, you have to work at teasing out accents of milk chocolate, mocha powder, carob coated raisins and then apricot, apple fruit scents, coffee oddly absent, for all of its maltiness and lack of hops, there is a saline, metal edge to it before it dissolves in your nostrils. Full-bodied and bottom heavy in spite of its very polished and round mouth feel and suave carbonation. Like it gets to the party and plops down on the first coach it sees. More toast than roast, dark chocolate, carob, licorice, green coffee bean, not very bready, maybe raw grain or meadow grasses. Traces of mixed blacker fruits. Past the midpoint the palate dries out appreciably, you can feel the moisture evacuate. While more or less monochrome flavor-wise, does have depth.

The finish is dry with the carbonation tingling the sides of tongue. Slightly drying. This would be a good breakfast stout to me, as it seems very filling. It's also a stout with a good balance; not too sweet or too hoppy and bitter.

Not fond of the mint twinge on the tail end, as well as the sweet finish, which drags down the drinkability. Bitter toasted barley saves the day. Crazy smooth going down, creamy but not terribly thick.

In the finish I'm getting some herbal and nutty qualites, the herbaceous hops come off almost minty. Flavor is balanced with some of the fruity qualities wrapped in chocolate and just roasty enough to scream extra stout. Definitely whipped cream layered on a cappuccino with dark chocolate shavings with a touch of hazelnut, finishes with some of those hop qualities described earlier especially the mint note. Mouthfeel is full bodied yet creamy textured a nice way to drink under six percent carbonation is mellow and smooth on the palate nothing weighs you down with bitterness or any one sensation.

There was certainly plenty of roasted malts, with burnt coffee tones. It was thick, creamy, and smokey.

Very clean and pure tasting and feeling, but no dominant characters that grab me either. The beer opens with a convencing opaque, dark brown hue and 1/2"" head retention that reduced to a simmer before holding firm. Timid aromas of roasted grains, sweetness, lactose, and toast. Aromas rely on confectionate-type matiness that hold character, but is not descernable. Taste rise the roasted / cocoa a bit, but the soft malty flavors and texture prevail, yet remaining non-descript. The body holds a creamy texture with a slight linger with malt, cocoa, and toast. The hops are also timid, especially in the aromas and flavors. The bittering is fair, but I expect more for the style. Though light in character, the brew is quite clean and controlled.

It's medium-light bodied with a very fine-bubbled, zesty carbonation (it appears bottle-conditioned, unless whatevers in the bottom of the bottle isn't yeast). Through the front and middle, the flavor delivers a note of vinous fruit that's wrapped in luxurious caramel/toffee, and then dipped in sweet milk chocolate.

Taste: luscious rush of roasted malts upfront, burned crescent roll (but in a good way), chocolate, chocolate pudding, coffee grinds.

Taste features a full onslaught of roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, and essence of walnuts. Plenty of dark roasty malt bitterness with some grassy and citrusy hops for a nice balance.

Lots of vanilla and caramel along with some slightly smokey roasted malts and maybe some coffee characteristics. It actually looks like a french vanilla latte! Brown roasted malts accompanied by caramels is the main flavor here. Some smoke makes it way through giving this a dryer feel especially on the finish. No alcohol really to report, but lots of coffee aftertaste. Nice taste overall. Nothing too elaborate on the mouthfeel: well balanced carbonation throught, dry on the finish a bit (oak flavor almost) and nice sweetness balancing the roasted flavors.

4.7,16.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"The aroma is a licorice, coffee blend, with hints of cherries and red grapes. The taste is much the same, chocolate tasting and lightly bitter. The maltiness is heavy and the tastes a little like wine in the aftertaste. This is a fabulous stout, one that makes me think that stout is my favorite beer style. Highly recommend.","abcsofbeer","Sep 19, 2004"
4.55,12.9,4,4,5,4.5,4.5," Exceptional balance and outstanding Stout character. A truely great example of a Foriegn / Export/ Extra Stout.","Shiredave","Aug 08, 2004"
4.12,2.2,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Appearance is black as night but it poured a dissapointing head leaving no lacing. Smell is good, toasted grains, coffee, and chocolate. Taste is getting better the warmer this brew gets. Roasted malts, hints of coffee and chocolate, and a nice dry finish. It is a bit thin for a stout. Overall drinkability is good. I have another bottle that I will be sure to let warm up from fridge temps!","arizcards","Aug 08, 2004"
3.68,-8.7,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich black and chocolate malt scent along with dry, yet creamy finish. The taste is decent. It has an extremely rich black and chocolate malt flavor that is very thick and dry. It goes down slow and finishes with a bitter black malt aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent drinking stout. It has a little lacking in the mouthfeel department as well as a little too intense in the grain bill.","WesWes","Jul 21, 2004"
4.36,8.2,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Very dark pour with small caramel head. Scent of bitter chocolate and mild roastiness. Very nice nose. Nice roasted bitterness in the flavor - the hops, chocolate and slight coffee bounce around in unison. Light on the tongue. A delicious brew! Mad River brews are slowly moving up the ladder among my favorites.","JahNoth","Jul 21, 2004"

4.05,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Cant pour any darker than this pitch black stout with a thin mocha colored head,aromas of deeply roasted malt and mocha flavored coffee very rich and appetizing on the nose.Taste is very roasted with a unsweetened chocolate note finishing very earthy and nutty.Very raw and bold beer like the earthiness in the finish and the creamy mouthfeel a big winner here.","oberon","May 13, 2004"
3.18,-21.1,3,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours an oily black with a big brown head that's gone rather quickly. Not much for lacing. Smells of roasted grain and coffee with a slight hoppy smell as well. Taste is of a bitter coffee and slight chocolate with a nice roasted malty taste as well. Lingers pretty well in the mouth, but nothing too spectacular here. Pretty well carbonated with a light mouthfeel for a stout. I don't know here. A decent offering, but again nothing too terrific. I was impressed with the scotch porter, but this was just OK.","abents","Apr 13, 2004"

4.08,1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Nice full body, very smooth and clean tastes all around. I could easily make a night of this superb stout. The price is just right for this, so it's even easier to dive in.","Skidz","Mar 06, 2004"
4.2,4.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This is a fine extra stout. It pours out a dark, opaque black colour with a nice frothy espresso coloured head. The aromas are nice. Chocolate, espresso, caramel, hops, deep roasted malts, and a bit of spicy booze. The taste follows suit with a wonderful melange of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is neither thick, nor thin, and it is all too easy to drink one of these puppies down. Nice stuff.","francisweizen","Jan 04, 2004"
4.32,7.2,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The full, heavy, and thick body is just shy of being syrupy, earning it high marks in this lesser dimension. The drinkability is likewise enhanced by the moderate ABV and lovely feel. Grande! Let this Steelhead come upstream and multiply!","AtLagerHeads","Jan 01, 2004"
4.35,7.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The beer pours pitch black with a slight ruby highlight when held to light. The brown head forms quickly and then falls slowly lacing the glass. The aroma is chocolate and coffee and roasted malt. The flavor is chocolate and coffee and roasted malt. The body is medium-full and appropriate. The finish is dry coffee.","GCBrewingCo","Dec 29, 2003"
4.51,11.9,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Comments  This is one stouty stout. This is what I think of when I think of stout. This is a tremendous example of the style. Much thanks to the Santa Monican MickeyMac for sending me this offering from Mad River.","RoyalT","Nov 28, 2003"

4.48,11.2,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a raven color, not a hint of light passes through this stout, the head pythonic in size, the texture spumescent, and the color a rich chocolate brown, as it disperses, a thick and claggy lace welds itself to the glass. The deep rich aromas of the toasted grain reaches you first, followed by the sweet malt, with hints of bittersweet chocolate and yes even some deep rich roasted fresh ground coffee, delectable the nose. Start is ambrosial, thickly malt, the top full and chocolate rich with the finish pleasantly acidic, the hops spiteful in their spicy presence, very dry and slightly bitter aftertaste, clings to your palate like a newborn baby to its mothers bosom, quite quaffable this beer from a fine brewery.","Gusler","Oct 01, 2003"
3.74,-7.2,3,4,3.5,4,4,"Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malts, some fruitiness and coffee. A medium bodied stout. Malts are chocolate and coffee, with a touch of fruit sweetness. Hops are slightly bitter and dry. Smoky and peaty as well. Very drinkable stout. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Aug 31, 2003"
3.87,-4,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with a twist-off cap, this pours inky black. It appears highly carbonated on pouring, but the head never really comes to life and it just sort of sits there. Espresso, chocolate, and just a touch of raisin combine nicely in the smell and taste. It has enough hops to lend a nice twang. The mouthfeel is fairly chewy. Despite the nice complexities, it runs its course after one or two.","mickeymac","Jul 13, 2003"

3.87,-4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours opaque black with a thick, fine brown head that soon melts to a thin lace. Aroma dominated by espresso, with dusty roasted malt. I liked the lack of alcohol in the aroma. Nose is dry roasted malt and coffee, with a little dark chocolate, that thins to a surprisingly light mouthfeel for a stout that looks so thick. Hops are present as a muted, minerally astringent bitterness towards the finish, which is snappy. Nice coffee aftertaste. I wouldn't call this a deep or complex stout, but it has a great smell and aftertaste. Its lighter, drier and more drinkable than you'd expect. Worth trying but not seeking out.","bcm119","Apr 04, 2003"
3.78,-6.2,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured into the glass a jet black color, no light penetration. The head was a medium brown color, but left fairly fast. There was no head retention and no lace visible. The aroma was of dark fruits and berries, malt, coffee and chocolate. The taste was creamy and semi thick. Hints of chocolate dominated, as well as coffee and chocolate and some alcohol peeked through. The flavors were fine while in the mouth and good while they caressed the tongue, but once swallowed the flavor left fast. Shame on this I was enjoying this beer up until this moment. Would like to have more lasting flavors after the last sip.","Jarod","Jan 21, 2003"
4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Jet black color, huge thick tan head, roasty coffee aroma, roasty chocolate-smokey flavors, nice full and creamy mouthfeel, has a nice hop bite in the finish, a nice tasty easy drinking stout, I think I will have another.","maxpower","Dec 23, 2002"
4.03,0,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Dollars-to-flavor, you can't find many Stouts better than this. This was similar to Cooper's and Zonker Stout, which is definitely a good thing. Pours a near-black color with a thin dark beige head. Rather sweet with some chocolate and coffee in the flavor and aroma. A pleasant experience overall, my only complaint is that it could have been a little more rounded.","Dogbrick","Nov 21, 2002"

4.15,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Ah, when this beer pours it brings back memories.  This beer is so dark, my old roommate who was a strick macro lager drinker(but drank coffee blacker than sin non stop, go figure)would have asked what swampwater I was drinking.  Formed a dark head that subsided quickly but left some lace.  Wonderful stong aroma of malt and coffee.  The taste was strong but not overpowering of coffee and slight hint of chocolate.  A lighter body then some other stouts.  A definate keeper if your into stouts and worth checking out.","Wildman","Jun 14, 2002"
4.41,9.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer is black.  Seems pretty thick as it glugs out of the bottle.  Nice brown head that is gone in seconds, however, this beer does lace the glass nicely throughout the drink.  Coffee and bitersweet chocolate on the nose.  Taste contains a very pleasant roasted character.  Very low on the burnt tones.  And there is a slight sweet taste here that I'm not familiar with in stouts. Nice bitterness in this stout. The beer is very creamy and easy drinking.  Very Solid Stout in my book.","Bighuge","Apr 24, 2002"
4.77,18.4,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"This is a dandy...My first experience with Mad River Brewing.  I love this stout.  It pours black with a slight amber hint to it.  A creamy, lucious tan-reddish head caps this ""liquid"" of delight.  The aroma is outstanding...strong chocolate, and breadiness...It is a beer of high character.  It feels the way a stout should feel, and tastes the way I expect a stout to taste...creamy and easy drinking, this stout features a strong chocolate malt base, with just enough hopping to keep it from being too sweet.  It is an excellent stout, in the same ballpark with all my favorite stouts from Kalamazoo, Mackesons, and Watneys.","ZAP","Apr 02, 2002"
4.8,19.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is a great stout.  They really couldn't do much to improve on it.  It poured a deep black, not a trace of light coming through.  I would have liked a better head on it.  The smell coming off of it is licorice and strong roasted malts.  Great taste.  Faint licorice with roasted malts and a nice chocolate taste in the background.  Very clean across the palate, in fact surprisingly so for a stout.  I would have liked a little creamier feel to it, although this probably comes through with a proped nitro tap.  Extremely drinkable.  Probably the first beer that I had ever almost finished before I even thought to start my review.  This is just one great stout.  I love them and this is a beauty.","Murph","Mar 13, 2002"
