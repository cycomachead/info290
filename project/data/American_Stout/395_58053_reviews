"Overall it was a little underwhelming, decent option for its low price tag for a bourbon barrel aged beer, seems like a lot of them are ten times more expensive these days, but the more expensive ones are indeed better, so getting what you pay for"
"Very good bourbon barrel stout, not too heavy"
"O: Despite the poor mouthfeel, this beer looks and smells great and is tasty enough. Just for kicks I added a small pour of bourbon to the second half of the glass and it made it quite nice"
"Bourbon Barrel Stout is a great tasting  beer. I prefer the beer taste from the tap instead of bottled. When you open the bottle you smell bourbon. You can taste the bourbon, but it is not overwhelming.  You should try this beer"
"On tap at Ford’s Fish Shack in South Riding and served in a small snifter. The beer is a dark brown that’s nearly opaque, but shows some cola highlights when held to the lamp. Minimal head once it got to the table which settled to a sheen. Clearly a barrel aged beer from the aroma which is deep with vanilla and oak. There are roasted malt, molasses, and char notes as well. Taste is not exciting and leads off watery. It is moderately sweet with vanilla, molasses, and a dusting of cocoa. It is also moderately bitter on the finish with espresso, oak, char, and roasted malt flavors. A weak medium body, thin texture, moderate carbonation, and a sweet woody finish."

"Being from Louisville it makes me sad to say that BBC just does not come through on anything. Poor execution."

"This was very nice and balanced. Bit of bourbon, bit of chocolate. Unfortunately, I sampled it after Extremely Angry Beast. If you like subdued barrel aging, like I normally do, this might just be for you. More of a gentle pinch than a bone - crunching hay maker."

"Taste is a little light in the loafers so to speak, the malts need some beef. The barrel character is pretty nice, and the roast well integrated. It just seems to lack body and sweetness that would go a long way here, certainly thin is a good descriptor. The aroma was good here, but the taste leaves me wanting [a better beer]. I would be hard pressed to give this one another go."

"O- A decent enough BBS but not particularly complex. Very mild - this might be the BBS to serve your friends that have never had one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Decent. Mild in all sense for this style. Light on the flavors and complexity."
""
"Had this while waiting entirely too long for my takeout Thai food to be ready. Second offering from these guys. Nice brownish/black color. Relatively mild bourbon flavor, could've used a little more...some slight pecan notes in there as we'll. Faint aromas considering the genre, expected stronger. Not as smooth of a mouthfeel as you'd expect either. Decent, maybe a little underrated on here."
""
""
"I was a little disappointed by this. If you want a good Bourbon Stout I'd suggest Alltech's brewing. Their brewery is shared with Town Branch bourbon distillery so the barrels they use are fresh. Literally the barrel empties 5 year old bourbon, and hours later is filled with a batch of beer to age. They have perfected the art of bourbon barrel aging for beer."

"Solid pssffft upon prying the tap, and the oversized bubbly head both suggest an over-carbonated stout. Given the appearance, the aroma suggests this could be an infected bottle: it smels dank and sour. There is a hint of bourbon and maybe the dank is just from the oak barrel. ... (sips)... Definitely over-carbonated. Flavor features spoiled dark grains. It's drinkable, barely, at best. ... (a few more sips) ... actually, I think I'd rather pour this out and have a good beer."
""
"O - This was a disappointment."
""
""
"The carbonation was way too much, it blew out the rest of my sences...in the taste no hints of oak or a barrel at all...."
""
""
""
"Overall: I was a bit sad with my experience of my first barrel aged stout. I feel that the bourbon was overdone without the flavors of the beer remaining in the taste profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's a decent barrel aged stout that is easy to get in my area. I would like just a little bit more flavor and a thicker mouthfeel."
""
"O-average stout, barrel-aged adds a little, but still does not have notable flavor and light body for a stout"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Best bourbon barrel stout I've had. It's my 'go to' when I feel like a bourbon barrel stout. The bourbon flavor is not over the top like some (New Holland Dragon Milk for example). It's smooth and easy to drink. You can taste the bourbon, but it doesn't overwhelm the stout. I recommend it to anyone."
""

""
""
"Poured into a Guinness pint glass nearly jet black except for ruby highlights when held to the light,a very thin beige head that was one in a blink atop.Big vanilla/bourbon and sweet brown sugar in the nose,smells very sweet...almost cloying.Thin and borderline watery feel just takes any steam this beer may have had away,flavors of vanilla and brown sugar,faint char but it doesn't impede the sweetness much.Wow this is a clunker,I was hoping for something much better."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a goblet. Black (it's a stout, surprise, surprise), with very little to no head. The aroma was nice, but very subtle. Like some other reviews, I would've appreciated a stronger hint of bourbon, but it definitely was not offensive by any means. The taste reminded me a bit of something oak-barrel aged (I.E. vanilla notes), not sure if that's the case or not. It was a bit watery, for lack of a better word (not as creamy as I'd like), but overall, pretty solid stout, one of the better ones I've had in awhile, would definitely drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
" definitely not as strong as what I would like the Bourbon flavor. I would definitely buy this again. try it you'll probably like it"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty easy drinking stout with a touch of bourbon flavor. I'd say the flavor was added instead of it being aged in bourbon barrels like most other beers. It's very easy to drink and isn't necessarily a sipper. I'd recommend it."

"a thick black pour with a slight bit of head which quickly dissipated. smells of delicious sweet chocolate, hint of vanilla and bourbon, molasses. the bourbon smells really subtle, which is honestly relieving for a change. OOH YEAH! a delicious coffee/chocolate flavor blast up front followed by a nice mellow vanilla bourbon bite. a really nicely done stout, i honestly cannot for the life of me understand the average rating.. this is one of my favorites so far. nice bitter dark chocolate flavor lingers for most of the drink and every gassy burp brings up hints of vanilla. really loving this one. medium in bod with moderate carbonation.. light for a heavy bourbon barrel stout, but honestly nice for a change. a very nice easy drinking stout mellow on the bourbon, but it's still very noticeable. really like this one a lot."

"Lacks in bourbon character. Good notes of chocolate, but may be a little overly sweet."
""

"O- my grading is based on what it is, a stout, although the ABV may suggest otherwise. I was looking for more bourbon flavors but its still a pretty tasty stout nonetheless."
"Low B"
"Overall, not a bad beer. I was expecting something much bolder in flavor, but I can see that the barrel aging didn't take the main focus here. My biggest beef is that the base beer, the stout, was fairly standard to begin with - if we were dealing with a top-notch stout as the base beer, this could have been great."
"o - Overall I liked this one a lot; I was pleasantly surprised and liked it a lot more than I thought I would. Lots of chocolate and vanilla and some nice light bourbon, this is a good BBA stout that comes in 12 oz. bottles and isn't too heavy or high ABV. Would definitely have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, not a great beer, but the base stout seems like a pretty good beer. It doesn't have a whole lot of malts and flavors going on, it's not an imperial stout so fairly good for just an American stout. however, the lack of Bourbon Barrel really hits hard as I really wanted some of that."
"A fairly okay Barrel aged stout, nothing special"
"Pours black with a thin, tan head. Nose has chocolate, coffee, vanilla and bourbon. The tastes are balanced with a nice, but not overwhelming bourbon character at first and finishes mostly vanilla bourbon. The feel is very nice and chewy. I would have this beer again. Nice on a cold night."
""
""
""
""
"I want to like this more, but for the price there are just too many others that surpass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours Dark but with no head. The smell is Coffee. Taste is vanilla, dark chocolate and caramel. A little sweet and some fruit. Bourbon and woody barrel taste as name implies. The alcohol lingers on the tongue. Creamy and has a full body. However the body needs more depth before I rank it higher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a real missed opportunity here. I think if the mouthfeel could be improved this could really be a top notch brew. Until then, not really worth seeking out."

"O - Looks good, smells good, but the thin body and booziness just seems out of place."
"Overall I'd say this is pretty good the chocolate flavour was great,smooth and creamy."

"Served from bottle into a flared pilsner. Poured a dark red brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, wood, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, wood, sweet alcohol, subtle caramel, and smoke. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. I saw this one on the menu and that it was bourbon barrel aged and had to try it. However, while the barrel was definitely there in this one it really made me wonder how good the actual base beer really is as the barrel was pretty much the dominate factor on this one. While being okay to drink it did leave a little to be desired. Worth trying at least once if you can, but I would leave it at that."
""
"Pours black with an off white head that lasts all the way down. Red around the edges. The nose matches the taste. There is a bit of chocolate, a bit of coffee, some roastyness, a bit of vinalla, and of course a touch of bourbon. The tastes all seem balanced and in check but its not extremely exciting and I didnt get a ton of the bourbon character. The feel of this beer is decent, It has a nice size but it has a somewhat unpleasant soapyness that I cant quite put my finger on. It's a pretty decent beer, nothing to really seek out by any means but if your into it, not bad."
""
""
""
""
"O: Mild and buttery - not terrible, but certainly not average."
"For 'Bourbon Barrel Stout' to be in the largest font on the label, this beer doesn't live up to its namesake. It's an okay stout, but it's missing the mark on many levels. This is an average-to-half-decent American Stout that happens to be barrel-aged, although it didn't pick up many complexities. I'm going to give it a 3.5 overall, but mostly for effort."
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer but a little thinner that I wanted/expected for the style. There is a nice complexity to the flavor but it is a little harsh to be a sessionable beer. Alcohol could have been more well hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Medium body with decent carbonation for a stout. Good flow and a pleasant aftertaste. Good stuff. I liked it alot."
""
""
""
""
""
"It was an ok beer in general, but a complete miss on the style."
""
"O- A great barrel aged stout that is very drinkable. Hardly a trace of booziness in this beer, just some nice warming. Really flavorful and a great mouthfeel. I have not had a ton of bourbon barrel aged beers but many I have had really overdo the bourbon but this beer strikes a great balance."
"Fizzy carbonation is the first impression in the mouth. Overall this beer shows some of the promise of a barrel aged double stout, but perhaps also some of the difficulty in finding the right balance in the barrel treatment."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
"Overall: Extremely disappointed in this one. You can barely tell there's bourbon in there. Tastes like a weak brown ale, not even close to a stout. Not offensive taste-wise but offensive to the style. Stay away!"
""
"The mouthfeel is very thin for a stout. Overall, I find this beer to be too sweet and thin to compete in the -bal aged category. Decent try but not great."
"O: Not a very good beer unfortunately."
""
"I found this to be pretty good stuff and better than the BA score here indicates. I had only modest expectations going in but was pleasantly surprised. Not up to the level of the big barrel aged heavy hitters out there but I would put this on par with something like Weyerbacher’s Heresy."
""
""
"Disappointing. This is the example of a brewery that has jumped on the ""barrel aged"" bandwagon. This is a watered-down example of a barrel aged stout and is frankly a disgrace to carry the name barrel aged stout. Black in color with a weakly colored brown head. Taste is weak, with light notes of chocolate that fade as quick as you can begin to taste them. Watery and light for a barrel aged beer. Mouthfeel is like drinking water. Save your money....extreme disappointment."
"Feel = thin to medium body with very little carbonation."
""
"This is neither a good stout nor a good bourbon-barrel beer. It's not pricey, but I guess I know why."
"There is a hint of that char from the inside of a barrel that penetrates the brew. I don't care for that flavor in a wine, but it works well with a stout so long as it is subtle."
"Overall this actually isn't a bad beer, but for slapping the bourbon barrel name on there, this is not quite pulling it off. It's more of a roasty American porter/stout to me but still enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall: I am disappointed by this years offering, past years have been mush better, and in fact the Jeffersons aged beer is far superior to this beer."
"O: not a bad beer for its price, no bad flavors, just falling a little short of its competitors"
""
"O- poor attempt at a BA stout. Missing the bourbon, vanilla, and oak flavors and aromas acustomed to the style."
""
""
""
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with an abundance of carbonation that is effervescent and bubbly on the tongue. I dont want to be the one that screams infection over this brew but this is a drastically different experience from the last bottle I had. The previous bottle I consumed had an abundance of dark cherry tartness and minerals that was not enjoyable at all. While this bottle was slightly better, it still tasted a bit off to me. This brew flirts with having potential but something has gone wrong. I wouldn't mind having this again when it is fresh but I would be hesitant."
""
"Not bad overall, but really lacking in some areas. Just kind of wimped out, honestly, plus some off-notes in the aroma. Doable, & I don't think I'd pass up another one, but not real memorable."
""
"O: This isn't a terrible beer, but definitely not as good as others in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Again, this beer is not bad, but not awesome either. I'm pretty sure it is going to get a ""C" from me, and I think that is a very fair assessment. Thanks again Joe!"
"D - This isn't a hard beer to drink but it isn't one that's as complex as the name would suggest. A nice addition to my mix and match 6 pack but not something I'm going to go out of my way to enjoy again."
"M - A little too much carbonation for my tastes but its fine; medium bodied still really smooth."
"O - This is a so-so beer. It's not terrible, but it has some off flavors and is a bit too thin. It could probably use some more bourbon on the tongue."
"Pours black with only a sliver of cocoa head. Below average lacing on my snifter glass. Very little carbonation as well. Nose is basically two things: Oak and vanilla. I really don't get anything else with this brew. Somewhat disappointing, but I don't get bourbon in the nose at all. Kind of weird for a bourbon barrel stout... I actually get a little bourbon in the taste, as well as smoke, and some hops. Feel is undercarbonated, and a little sweet for what I'd like to see. Overall, this was a bit of a disappointment. I probably won't look for this again. Cheers"
"O - better than nothing, but well down the list."
"D: overall, this is a miss for me. the backbone just doesnt work with the wood and bourbon and like i said above it leaves me wanting something more from this brew. potential, but i think some tweaks need to be made."
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled Dec 2010. Pours pitch black color with an instant 3 finger than head with great retention that reduces to a nice lacing cap that lasts. Some moderate lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of dark fruits, roasted malt, bourbon, oak, vanilla, and some chocolate and coffee in the background. Some interesting and bourbon forward aromas here. Taste of big oak, bourbon, and roasted malts on the front, that leads to chocolate, vanilla, and light coffee on the finish. A bit of bitterness on the finish with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of bourbon. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, not too bad. This was pretty enjoyable."
"had some high hopes for this one, but it did not really pan out as I had hoped. Pour was uneventful, thick black oil like, with no real head. Decent lacing throughout. Smell was very full, lots of oak, and bourbon aromas, and the vanilla is unmistakable, in fact pretty much over powering. First impression was not pleasant, it was vanilla overload for me, nad what the vanilla didn't kill the oak took care of later. Not enough carbonation left it feeling utterly flat and uneventful. Really had a rough time getting all of this down as the vanilla and oak were just overdone and killing it for me. Overall nah, I am good."
"I would recommend passing on this one."
"O: B- grade for this one. Nothing to write home about really. I have had much better BA stouts."
"Overall: Not an impressive beer. The idea is good ut something is missing here. Picked it up as it's a somewhat local brewery but I won't make that mistake again."
"It's black, thick, and smooth with a huge, creamy tan head. It was excessively carbonated and took a couple of pours to get it in the glass. The color had me instantly wondering something that unfortunately was true of this beer. Because of the stout characteristics including the roasted, smokey, nutty flavors, the bourbon was really hard to pick up. There were some late woody and vanilla notes, but the bourbon was not as prominent as I would have liked."
"Overall is ok at best. I grabbed a 4-pack of this and can't really see myself doing that again."
"This is a very good bourbon barrel beer and likely the best year round bourbon barrel on the market."
"O: Bluegrass' Bourbon Barrel Stout isn't a bad beer, it's simply average personified. Nothing here, sans the nose, is worth mentioning. Middie of the road is a dangerous place to be. Here's to Bluegrass picking it up a bit, as producing beers like this can very quickly lead to a dead end."
"D- Overall, I love bourbon barrel-aged stouts, so I thoroughly enjoyed it. Although, it is pretty light, and nothing close to a good bbal imperial stout. I really cannot believe this beer is 8.6% because it is incredibly easy-drinking. I think the biggest fault for this beer is the high ABV because that's the only thing preventing me from going through a fourpack."
"D - Pretty good overall, let it warm up just a bit and it is quite enjoyable. A decent stout that I would have no problem picking up again."
"Overall, not much to set this one apart. No real flaws, just nothing to really grab you, smack you around and introduce you to its mother."
"As a porter, this would be a solid beer, but as a stout, its lackluster in its finest moments. I was expecting smoothness from the bourbon barrels, but it was absent. The metallice taste is disheartening."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is very nice and quite complex. I get a lot of bourbon as well as some chocolate, vanilla, maple and dark fruit. The flavor is just as complex. The chocolate and roasted malt come through very strong, but the flavor also has all of the components you expect from a bourbon barrel aged beer. I get some bourbon whiskey notes as well as some maple, oak and vanilla. Medium to thick mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation. A very nice barrel-aged stout. Glad I got to try this one."
"O: Not a bad beer and it's nice to have a bbal beer that isn't super thick, super sweet, and/or super boozy. Still, I could go for a bit more bourbon flavor and a thicker body."
"Pours a very dark brown. A tan head soon recedes to a film, and then disappears entirely. Smell is sweet and chocolately, with a bit of grainy booze. Taste has a nice dash of (overly) sweet malts and vanilla, followed by an (overly) hot alcohol rush. Too much of a contrast, imo. And I'm left feeling like I had a whisky chaser. If this was a bit more balanced it would be good, thus it is just OK."
"Overall: Not a bad beer, but not a great beer either, I think the barrel flavors could have been better integrated and the beer flavors could have been more apparent."
"Pours a tootsie roll brown color with light easily coming through the edges, minimal head and lacing. Scent strong on bottom shelf bourbon and vanilla, roast profile minimal with a cheap holiday milk chocolate presence. Odd buttery toffee/ cracker jack dominates the end of the scent profile. Taste disappoints again with thin tastes all around, even the bourbon notes are watered down and still dominate taste. Off cracker jack notes again come through the finnish Medium bodied, dry and thin for style. Beer offers very little in the way of anything that could be destined as full or aggressive."
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight oatmeal, alcohol (bourbon), hint of smoke, and a hint of roasted malt. Fits the style of an American Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, roasted malt, alcohol (bourbon), and hint of wood. Overall, weak in appearance, but the bourbon aroma and taste is well apportioned with all other notes."
"The mouthfeel is predictably thin. It isn’t water-thin; in fact, it is almost within the range of appropriateness for the style. The strong carbonation doesn’t help, though. Nothing about the mouthfeel works to bolster the flavor profile. Overall, this is not a good beer. This is bourbon barrel aging just for the sake of it. It’s kind of a shame that a Kentucky brewery can’t get a bourbon barrel aged beer right, but then I’ve never once had a beer from Bluegrass Brewing Company that I was impressed by. I shouldn’t be surprised by how poor this effort is."
"I don’t think this beer was as bad as a lot of people said. It had a deep opaque body with a bit of carbonation. The head was minimal and there was some tan lace. The flavor is extremely sweet. There are strong bourbon tones in both the flavor and the smell. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for this style."
"O: Huge disappointment. Not very happy about having 3 of these left in the fridge."
"Poured a deep rich black with a large light brown frothy head that lasted about 3/4 of the way though the glass and produced some really excellent lacing. The aroma was strong of burnt dark chocolate malts, a medium leathery yeast with notes of roasted coffee, molasses, some chared oak and a mild dose of bourbon with a hint of vanilla. It tasted, (WOW) pretty awesome with a nice bitter coffee flavor from the onset and then slowly maturing into a nice chocolate, molasses, coffee medley with an ever so slight whiskey finish. Mouthfeel was kind of bold but not as full as I would have thought, more medium than full in body. The texture was absolutly smooth and creamy with a flat carbonation. Overall an outstanding stout, although I would have like a little more body and a tad more of the bourbon flavor."
"O - flavors are here, just not right some how."
"O: The fact that there's not a good base for the bourbon to build upon hurts the beer overall. I've had many other beers that just dump this one."
"The beer pours visibly thin for the style, but is capped with a nice head for a supposed -bal. The nose offers chocolate, mild bourbon, toffee, vanilla and some naked grain, although these impressions are very light. The flavor is a mirror image of the aroma; it is like diet -bal Stout. It really tastes pretty good, actually; almost like the (-bal) real thing. I would drink this again, though I would not likely seek it out."
"Well, the taste could, I suppose. It was more watery than the smell hinted. Booze, bourbon, malts, and water all combined in the mouth, but they felt like separated ingredients rather than a well-built beer. Those pieces themselves were quality, and the sweetness of the bourbon still dominated the chocolate and hops, but the overly boozy finish made this a pass for my friends. And there was a sour lactic note that shouldn't be there. Which made it all the more dumb why I finished the bottle. And also the reason why my girlfriend wound up dragging me across the floor to bed. Sometimes you just don't learn."
"Got this one from Red Dog Wine and Spirits in Franklin, TN. It pours a deep dark brown with a healthy three finger head when poured vigorously. The head is a lighter brown color, with mix of bubbles ranging from large to small. Smell has some smokiness with the definite bourbon vanilla notes present. Also presenting in the aroma are notes chocolate. Tastes good with the bourbon vanilla and smokiness of the malt still present. Bitter chocolates are also apparent in the taste. Feel is very smooth, not quite as carbonated as I would like, some oiliness in the feel as well. Full bodied. Overall I very much enjoyed the beer, a good representation of the American Stout style. Though I have had others that I enjoyed more, I really like the drinkability and flavors present in this Bluegrass Brewing Company version."
"D: If this beer wasn't labeled as a ""Bourbon Barrel Stout," it wouldn't be too bad, not great but pretty average. However, labeling this means there should be some of those characteristics in the beer, there aren't any, which is a let down."
"12 oz split with a friend who brought it back from a recent trip to Kentucky. Appearance is decent for the style, although a bit heavy on the fizz, but it goes down from there. Tons of sicky vanilla in the nose. Same in the taste, totally one dimensional, not enough bitterness and no malt complexity. Too much vanilla flavor. Does not hide alcohol well. Mouthfeel is kind of weak and not lively. Overall, this beer is not that good, not at all. Always nice to try something new though, even if it sucks."
"Poured from a bottle and wow, so much popping from all of the carbonation. Way too much for the style IMO and I haven't even tasted it yet. Smell is of weak coffee and roasts. No bourbon. Taste has much less body than I want for a stout. THERE'S the carbonation. So much, too much. Still no hint of bourbon. I taste mild malt. Taste kind of watered down with a mild coffee finish. If you are curious to try this, I would recommend buying a single bottle before buying the 4 pack, if possible."
"Light coca and some powdery sugar are in here. A touch of vanilla and oak round out of the flavors. Roasted bitter flavors as well, but there is an underlying sour note that’s really taking away from this. Over carbonated to the extreme makes drinking this undesirable as well. The head looks nice deep brown chocolate milk like with a fairly black body."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a very dark brown almost black color with a dark tan head that settles down to a thin head that collars around the glass throughout the session. The aroma is dark chocolate, coffee, and slight bourbon. Medium mouthfeel. Roasty, coffee, dark chocolate, with a slight bourbon note but not really overly strong. Not bad, the body isn’t as heavy as I would like for a beer like this. however, this reminds me of a KBS which brought a grin to my face. A cheap and accessbile beer that is! The bourbon is pretty minimal as well. A pretty easy and good drinking beer overall."
"O - Not a bad stout, but not what I wanted from the label."
"Pours black with a small amount of tan head. Smell is a light, but enjoyable vanilla and roasted malt flavor of a stout. Taste is of a pretty light stout. The roast is predominant in the flavor, with only the slightest hint of barrel aging from vanilla and oak. Not bad, but a bit one dimensional. Barrel is almost comically absent given the title of the beer. Distinctly average. Mouthfeel is good carbonation with a sugary finish and a fairly light body. This one is hard to rate because it seems to be barely what it claims to be. It's not bad and is kind of odd. The body seems to change as you make your way through it. Kind of meek in the flavor despite the sugar clinging to my palette after each sip."
"O: I'm thinking maybe I just got a bad batch because there just wasn't any head or depth. Slight metallic bite as well. Probably an outlier."
"D - Was this infected with brett? It's very dry and low in sugars and it's definitely overcarbonated. There are some off flavors in the nose too. The light texture makes this easy to drink even though it's far from the best barrel-aged stout I've had."
"O: Taste is not exactly a winner, but the aroma is a complete deal breaker."
"(12oz bottle). Pousr near black with khaki head and small carbonation bubbles. Aroma has oak, chocolate, coffee, but I’m not getting much in the way of bourbon. Hmmm, brewed in Kentucky, but not much bourbon. Now, it smells fine, but it just doesn’t smell like a bourbon barreled stout. Taste is roasty bitterness that is balanced by some sweetness. Medium to full bodied with a slick texture. Dry finish. This is actually a very nice beer, but I just don’t get any bourbon. That its from Kentucky is what makes me shake my head."
"overall: this was a good attempt at a barrel aged stout. This beer is taken to much barrelling and not enough time being a stout. Less carbonation and heavier body."
"Overall, skip this one. The flavors aren't off per se, there just isn't enough of it. The mouthfeel just really kills this beer though."
"O: All in all, this one is slightly strange in the taste, but not unbearable. Just kind of taste like milk with a hint of chocolate syrup. Good to try if you want a milk chocolate stout."
"I liked the bottle I had and would buy again."
"Drinkability - Well, this beer looked really good in the glass. I loved the smokey aspects, although I was expecting and hoping for a bit more of the Bourbon aroma and flavoring. Oh well, it was still rather enjoyable and an easy drink. Went down very easy considering the high ABV. Not horrible, but kind of misleading. I would have another though. Maybe two. I thought this would be a ""sipper", but I found myself taking big gulps."
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer. I might consider giving it a try again in the future with a fresh bottle but I feel that the results will probably be the same."
"Pours a pitch black with a 1 inch chocolate milk colored head. Some foamy ring lacing on the drink down. Smells of roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, cookie dough, and faint hints of bourbon. For some reason the cookie dough smell stands out, but this is a good thing because to me this smells very nice. Tastes of bourbon up front, followed by bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee, and vanilla notes. This beer is somewhat over carbonated for this style and leaves a weird fizzy feel on the palate. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that I am glad I got to try. In my opinion it is better than the C+ average it gets on here."
"Drinkability- Not sure how to ever score this. Can I drink a ton of these or do I want to drink a ton of these. The answer is.... The alcohol at 8.6 is well masked so I could drink quite a few of these in a row but I would choose to spend my money on some other stout on the shelf, and drink many of those in a row."
"Lighter-bodied than would be expected from this type of stout, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
"D- The flavor was decent but the nose was lacking and I didn't get any bourbon. Way too carbonated."
"(Drinkability): Not drinkable. If you were to receive a bottle for free, it would be worth trying for the sake of trying to comprehend how it ever got on the shelf. I couldn't even finish my entire glass. Do not buy."
"This beer pours a very very dark brown to the point that it is opaque in the glass. There is little to no head to speak of the beige foam that was initially on the surface didn't stay around too long. I perhaps have allowed the beer to get to cold as the aroma doesn't appear to be as bold as I would have anticipated initially. A bit of time helped, as the aromas that came out were rather pleasant. There is a great deal of vanilla on the nose with oak portions. Hints of coffee waft into the aroma as well, surprisingly I can smell no bourbon as of yet. The palate is rather woodsy upfront, but the vanilla helps it to fade back and go down easy. The aftertaste has some bitterness due to the late arrival of the coffee flavor to my palate. I wish I'd gotten a little touch of bourbon in this beer, but I am sadly out of luck. This is a good beer to sit down and drink and enjoy. On the lighter end of the spectrum for it's style, yet delicious and robust as it should be. I would recommend this beer. I found it to be quite nice."
"RIYL dry, bitter stouts."
"I would definitely drink this if it was in front of me but it wont be on my short list. Just too many out there better."
"I found more to like about it this second tasting than I did the first a couple days ago. This isn't amazing, but the bar has been set so high for bourbon barrel stouts that one performing merely B-level (""good"") gets slapped around a lot. I'm not sure that's fair, but hey, life isn't fair, and beer is one of the best things in life, so...just give it a shot and think for yourself."
"D - Very drinkable but somewhat one dimensional. Would love to see a little more character in this one."
"I've had a lot of luck in the last few porters/stouts that I've had the pleasure of tasting, and this is a pretty nice stout. Much like the most recent porters I've tried, this succeeds in that it doesn't try too hard to be overpowering in any sense of the word."
"D - I'm struggling to get through this, I can't believe how badly they screwed up the mouthfeel on this. Make it creamy with lower carbonation an you'd have a great beer on your hands. As it is? A trainwreck."
"There are no redeeming qualities to this beer, it should be avoided."
"D- I could drink it again but I wouldn't want to. I'm sure I could find something better. This could be a really good beer. They just haven't found the right combination fot it yet."
"Okay I'm new to these barrel aged beers and what not, but the bourbon does not mesh well in this brew and the aging process probably took what was once a decent stout, and turned it into a heap of a mess."
"D-This is not a very good beer. And my first from Kentucky."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle an oil black with a small tan head that receded very quickly and left no lacing or trace of head to be found. Smell was heavy in the coffee and roasted malt with a small amount of vanilla and bourbon sneaking through. Taste was very similar to the smell, dominated by roasted grain and coffee and small amount of chocolate and vanilla, the beer finished with a small hop bite and very little of the bourbon. Mouthfeel was thinner than expected and being an aged beer the lack of carbonation did not help the thinness of the beer. Drinkability is good, not an overpowering stout smooth but not as much flavor as I hoped. I would have to say I prefer goose islands broubon county over this beer."
"D - It's not going to be a go to stout, but I wouldn't turn one down either. I am a fan of the style and almost every stout I have had is drinkable. That being said, I feel that this is an above average beer in the entire landscape of beers."
"This one is barely drinkable, even in cold weather. The vanilla is too strong, without any accompanying roasted malts, and the body of the beer is all over the place."
"D- Despite my mouth going numb I couldnt finish this. Next time Ill just draw all over my tongue with a brand new Sharpie."
"Pretty disappointed in this one. Was hoping for a more full bodied, full flavored experience here, especially when I generally really enjoy BBC's beers. I've had the Jefferson Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout on tap and it was pretty good from what I remember. Might have to track some more of that down."
"The mouthfeel on this one was the worst part about this beer. Way overcarbonated and chalky. Thus, this beer is tough to stomach. I can feel the gasses expanding in my nether regions, and it aint pretty. Not worthy."
"Poured into my pint glass this beer is a very dark brown/almost black with ruby highlights. Barely any head but a thin ring around the glass. Smell at first is bourbon, straight up. As it warms some sweet chocolate notes shine through. Taste = bourbon. Holy crap this is heavy on the bourbon. I've had plenty of bourbon barrel aged beers in my day but this has the heaviest bourbon flavor of any. There's a hint of stout underneath but I can't get away from the bourbon. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and this beer burns my throat minutes after each sip. If you love bourbon this is for you but it is not very beerlike."
"My god... no... never.. not in a million years. Someone will have to test this first before I even get near it. The flavors and aroma are so sickening I feel nausea coming on. I can't even stomach the idea of drinking it right now."
"Poured into a Libbey tumbler.Strangely, there is a fluffy head of foam that wants to stay that way, presenting a very thin body, especially for a stout, with a palate that is rather bland and chalky. The graphics on the bottle label has more complexity than the actual beer. Alcohol strength is well disguised, although in this case, this could not be considered a virtue. Totally one dimensional."
"It's an easy beer to drink. It's not sweet like a porter, despite the vanilla. While there is some bitterness, it seems to be the right amount. Full-bodied with lots of alcohol, but drinks easier than you'd guess."
"Overall, I like this beer, but the bourbon notes are no where to be found. The flavors are good. Rating this as a stout, it is good. Rating it as a bourbon bal stout, it is not up to par. I like it though."
"Bottle. Pours a very dark brown almost black color with a dark tan head that settles down to a thin head that collars around the glass. The aroma is dark chocolate, coffee, and slight bourbon. Medium mouthfeel. Roasty, coffee, dark chocolate, with a slight bourbon note but not really overly strong. Not bad, the body isn't as heavy as I would like for a beer like this. The bourbon is pretty minimal as well. Pretty easy drinking though. For a stout it is good but as a barrel aged stout it is lackluster."
"D/M: The carbonation is robust but it is almost too much because it does not last very long. This wasnt a very heavy beer but still had a large presence of alcohol."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: It's just OK. Sure was let down from loving the aroma."
"not good."
"One and done definitely. I remember drinking their bourbon brown ale last year and feeling the same way. This brewery is a long way from pro status in my opinion. Way too thin and watery. Flavor is weak and needs more behind it. Worst bouron barrel or any wood aged beer I have consumed to date."
"The mouthfeel is thin, not good for the style."
"I am still looking for a bourbon barrel-aged stout that can even come close to Weyerbacher's Heresy."
"D - Served at about 50f seemed to bring the most character to the table. Easy to come back to. Good overall but nothing that really sets this apart from the crowd."
"Drinkability: I will certainly not be seeking this one out again and I really think that BBC should be ashamed of themselves for trying to pass this off as bourbon barrel aged."
"Drinkability: This beer is pretty good, and very drinkable for its ABV, but it lacks depth to make it very good. Not quite worth its price tag, but still solid and worth a try, if only once."
"And on rolls the Leaving Falls Church uber-bender. This entry pours a straight obsidian with only an imitation of Tim Tebow's hazing-induced haircut done in brown bubbles serving as a head. The nose is fairly weak, comprising chocolate, a hint of whiskey, a woodchip of oak, and some dry coffee beans. The taste holds notes of coffee, dark chocolate, Coca-Cola, molasses, and cinnamon. The bourbon, if actually there, is too weak to come through for me. But, at least what did show up performed nicely. The body is a surprising medium, with a moderate carbonation and a rather watery feel. Overall, this was a highly disappointing stout, especially after the enjoyment associated with the Jefferson's Reserve offering. It's quite a bit too light, the nose is weak, and the bourbon doesn't shine through very well. It doesn't taste bad, thankfully, but it's nowhere near great."
"BBC fell a bit short of the mark on this one. Poured tarry black wiht light mocha head. Aroma was toffee and coffee. Sweet, roasted malt flavor with coffee, unsweetened cocoa powder and a bit of charcoal. Not much bourbon came through - overall this struck me as a middle-of-the-road American stout, with no real barrel aspects, othter than perhaps the contribution of the charcoal note."
"Mouth is thinner than expected. But it does make for a pretty drinkable beer"
"D: Just doesn't have the girth to even approach the 2nd tier for this style. Middle of the road."
"D: Another piece of evidence that -bals do not always make a beer better/good."
"D- I didn't really know what to think but this was a little bit of a letdown. I was hoping for more of a bourbon flavor and just a tad bit thicker."
"D: One and done. Easy to drink but the mouth feel is off. Way too thin and watery. Flavor is weak and needs more behind it. Not that great at all."
"This is a very confusing beer because the little information we have from the label was misleading. No clue on the ABV but I would guess it to be on the lower-side"
"Overall a very decent barrel aged stout. I might seek this out again."
"D - Meh. Too thin and something seems a little bit off otherwise it's a fair bourbon barrel stout."
"This is drinkable for sure...not as complex or strongly flavored as other BA stouts, but worth a try."
"Over all a great beer. Nice to try a ba brew that you can drink nice and easy."
"The beer pours from the bottle but with a lack of head and the dark coffee lacing you would expect. This follows through on the smell which has little in common with Bourbon other than place of birth, the mouthfeel is thin as reported above but the taste has enough malt to hang in there as a drinkable dark beer, its just a disappointment as a Bourbon Stout."
"If you have any, don't drink it. Just pour it out."
"D: In all, it isn't a bad beer. I'll pay more for a more substantial stout any day, though."
"D: This is a pretty tasty beer, but I don't foresee me drinking more than one of these at a time. Highly recommended."
"D-Probably one of the easier drinking barrel aged stouts around. I'm not sure of the ABV but there is really very little alcohol presence detected. Overall a well done Bourbon barrel stout from Bluegrass."
