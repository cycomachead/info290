The nose starts with medium roast coffee followed by a hint of smoke, and some green pepper. Notes of chocolate and vanilla are sprinkled in, but coffee and pepper dominate the nose. The taste starts with mild acidity, presumably from the coffee, this develops into notes of chocolate and deep notes of fresh brewed coffee paired with smoke. The chipotles don't bring much heat to the table, but some definite smoke and vegetal notes. The finish dry and revisits the coffee along with roasted barley. Mouthfeel is medium to light with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a nice brew that could be so much better. I think the brewers went a little shy with the chipotles as heat never really presents itself on the palate.","homebrew311","Nov 15, 2013"

This is definitely not a beer to drink too cold, the subtle flavors are totally lost. I'm not getting any noticeable coffee, but the smooth chocolate liquor taste, balanced by a mild roast will ease your mind and please your palate.

Sweet vanilla and some cinnamon as well. Fresh coffee. Not really any chile or chipotle in the aroma. Taste is a little different however. Initially, there is a definite chile pepper flavor. Not heat, but just the flavor. The heat is very subdued and only comes through on the tip of the tongue after quite a few sips of this. Not overwhelming at all, just some tingling heat that lingers on the tip of the tongue and the lips. There are lovely coffee flavors and great cocoa taste. Very well balanced and a great way to introduce someone to what peppers can do to a beer. Mouthfeel is where this beers lacks... it's a little too light (I wish I could try the bourbon barrel aged version). Mild spicy finish. Drinkability is very high.

3.75,-0.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The post-fantasy football draft party continues here. This stuff pours a garnet-highlighted black-brown topped by a finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises light coffee, hickory smoke, roasted malts, light dark chocolate, and a rather light twinge of hot pepper in the background. I'm not entirely certain how much the power of suggestion was at work here, but I could swear the pepper was back there. The taste holds notes of mild smoke, roasted malts, watered-down coffee, and a larger bit of pepper in the back. With every drink, the pepper seems to grow more powerful, similar to the effect found in Hunahpu's (just with different flavors surrounding it). It makes for an interesting taste experience, believe you me. Unfortunately, the ancillary flavors are all kinda weak, save for the roasted malts. The body is a straight medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a rather enjoyable brew. I was hoping for something a bit thicker and more full-bodied, but it wasn't too big a deal here. I'd also been worried that the pepper had faded (seemed to be the recent review consensus), but instead it seemed the coffee had faded, though this allowed for a nice cumulative pepper effect. I'd say this brew was a success regardless, just not a monstrous one.","TMoney2591","Aug 06, 2011"

Certainly not bad looking as it rests in the tulip glass, but not exceptional either. Smells of fresh coffee, very subtle chili, a touch of chocolate, faint caramel, and some grassy hops. Taste is a little bigger than the nose, with some roasted coffee notes up front, roasted chocolate malt, caramel, lighter hops in the middle, and a mild chili flavor in the very end. For some reason, it makes me think of poblano peppers instead of chipotle, which seems a bit odd even to me, but it works alright. Mouth is a bit watery in between bursts of flavor, feels a bit under-carbonated, and finishes quite dry and sticky. Overall, a rather average coffee stout. The addition of the pepper mixes it up a bit, but really doesn't add much value to the beer for me. I'm certainly glad to have tried it, but I wouldn't actively seek it again.","eclipse54","Jul 17, 2011"

The chocolate and coffee is there, but the chipotle is done with a pretty light hand. Lastly, the body is saved by the creamy sensation of smokey adobo. This is a good beer with a lot of saving graces in each category. Definitely worth trying, and I think Bootleggers have a decent starting recipe to a much better beer.","Cavery","Jul 05, 2011"

3.89,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Vigorous pour gets you two plus fingers of creamy dark brown foam, all micro-bubbles with a uniformly flat surface, you can see hundreds of bubbles popping at once as it simmers down to the surface with ease, the foam glides down the glass sides in solid sheets, no lacing. As expected, the liquid is pure jet black without a trace of color, appears to have no haziness. Wastes no time unleashing the chipotle peppers, albeit the heavily roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate and cocoa, follows up with lactose, cumin and coriander spice, over time the pepper recedes in favor of earth, muddy straw and cigar ash. Medium-bodied, firm and muscular, the weak carbonation would surprise if you only viewed the glass after the pour and not minutes later when there is absolutely no bubbles to found anywhere. As a result, the heat and spice are able to soak in and maintain as consistent a presence as the bitter dark chocolate, coffee and milk cream. Except for the burn there's no real roughness, smooth enough overall texture. Oatmeal, corn bread, biscuit breadiness is doughy and not that sweet. Momentary touch of orange peel. Any greenness is akin to tea leaves or tobacco wrappers. Not particularly complex but does show determination in getting its few words across.","farrago","Jan 04, 2011"

3.8,1.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"d - pretty drinkable, actually, which is surprising for a coffee/chipotle beer, the alcohol is well hidden though not all that high to begin with at 6.7%","WeisGuy","0"

3.86,2.7,4,3,4.5,4,3.5,"D - Not sure how many of these I would really comsume in a night, probably just one. This is tasty beer, and very unique, but like all spicy foods, the more you drink the more chipotle you taste. The burn is not intense, but it is there. One and done for me.","Genghis22","Sep 24, 2009"
3.3,-12.2,4,4,3,4,2.5,"Notes: I could definitely see how some people would love this beer. If what you're looking for is some smoky spiciness in your American Stout, then this is probably your holy grail. Personally, as much as I liked the aroma, it just didn't float my boat when it hit my palate. Still, excited to see a Bootlegger's brew in a local shop. Gotta support the locals!","sweetbrew82","Sep 13, 2009"
4.04,7.4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"D: A very nice beer from Bootlegger's. Both of the local North County breweries have made a chile beer and both have turned out to be really good. Check this effort out.","Halcyondays","Sep 02, 2009"
4.44,18.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Served on tap at the Verdugo Bar. This beer came out black as night with only a trace of head that quickly fizzled away. A little disappointing, until I got a whiff. The nose was a big hit of coffee. I don't particularly care for coffee by itself but I love me some coffee in my beer. This one did not disappoint. The taste was more of the same, fresh ground coffee perfectly blended with roasted malts and a touch of spice at the end. The chipotle takes a back seat in this beer, with the coffee up front and then a nice touch of spice in the finish, complimenting the beer instead of overpowering it. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a medium body. I could have had a few of these if the Verdugo didn't have so many great beers to try. Overall this was an excellent beer, well balanced and extremely drinkable. I'll be looking for more of these in the future.","PretzelCity","Jul 09, 2009"

I have tasted this a couple times on draft as well, the the local roasted coffee stood out more, intense and delicious. I plan on putting up another review for the growler format soon.","vacax","Beers"
3.81,1.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle purchased from Hi-Times for $4.49, saw this one last bottle on the shelf and snagged it out of curiousity, split with my dad tonight as a big fan of this beer style, poured into my Stone pint glass, color is very dark brown, big 1 1/2 inch creamy tan head, some lacing at the top, decent retention too, aroma consists of mostly coffee, bit of chipotle shining through but nothing like I expected as far as the scent from the peppers, also some roasted malts, smokiness, toffee, and dark chocolate, taste starts off with a slightly sweet coffee flavor, fades into some malt in the middle that is a little roasted, finish is the same but a mild burning sensation from the peppers, once this beer warms up you can taste them more but not much at any point, not like other chile beers I have had in the past at least, roasted, slightly sweet and spicy mouthfeel, medium bodied, moderate carbonation, taste lingers well, could have drank this bomber but not much after that, pretty heavy for how low the ABV is, sweet and spicy at times which can throw the stomach for a loop, still decent drinkability considering its style, would drink again, this was a limited release according to the label but I hope to see it again, recommended","Floydster","0"
