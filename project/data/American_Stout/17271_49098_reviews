"The heat from the chipotle peppers comes through as the beer warms up."

"especially good on nitro!"
"I was expecting another gimmicky kind of beer where the gimmick advertised can't be discerned.  I was wrong.  Chipotle flavor is noticeable and adds a nice zing to an already decent stout.  I had low expectations, but I was nicely surprised."

"Overall: I really liked this stout. The coffee, malt, and chocolate are balanced well together, the mouthfeel is very good, and the subdued peppers give it a unique taste without being too much."

"Smell is light all around but what comes through is plum, sweet cigar, chocolate, coffee, toasted grain with a slight astringent finish. Flavor is dark chocolate, cherry, tobacco, strong roasted coffee, slightly sweet, no bitterness, mild chili on the back end - heat dissipates instantly. Finish is dry, light effervescence, on the lighter side of medium bodied - wish the chili lingered a bit longer, but still a good beer."

"O: this is nice because the spice is present, but not overwhelming to the point where the stout flavors are dominated. Would have like a little more roasted qualities, but overall it's better than average."
""
"Overall- A good winter warmer, having played around with my own chile brews I know the temptation to just go wild with the spice, but this beer keeps it on the quiet and lets the coffee and peppers take turns with the palate. The mouthfeel left me a bit unimpressed, but I'd gladly have another."

"Extra'd by daveydapoolman- thanks!! Pours a deep opaque brownish black. Pour yields minimal head with no lacing or retention to speak of. The nose starts with medium roast coffee followed by a hint of smoke, and some green pepper. Notes of chocolate and vanilla are sprinkled in, but coffee and pepper dominate the nose. The taste starts with mild acidity, presumably from the coffee, this develops into notes of chocolate and deep notes of fresh brewed coffee paired with smoke. The chipotles don't bring much heat to the table, but some definite smoke and vegetal notes. The finish dry and revisits the coffee along with roasted barley. Mouthfeel is medium to light with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a nice brew that could be so much better. I think the brewers went a little shy with the chipotles as heat never really presents itself on the palate."

"I'll admit I was a little hesitant to try this for a while for I was in doubt of how this would taste, but I was pleasantly surprised. Lots of coffee up front with a nice spicy kick from the chipotle in the tail end. Nice and smooth, creamy. Goes down easy. Will definitely be having one of these again."

"O: More than I was expecting here. My first beer from Bootleggers was very nice. I see the ratings are bit lower than mine. I think some people forget this is NOT a Imperial Stout as others BA reviews have eluded to "" I see where this one is going but just misses the mark on the flavors of a big stout."" Its a single stout. It hits all of the BJCP criteria and its very flavorful and full for the style. Well done."
"Overall, I liked this beer. I really don't like too many coffee stouts or chipotle stouts (or chipotle/chili pepper any beer...), but I enjoyed this one. I think the roast malts, hops, coffee, and chipotle was all balanced very nicely. I think this beer would be good with a big bowl of chili on a cool fall night watching football...or with a big bowl of VENISON chili in deer camp. I would get this beer again."

"overall not really what i was expecting but i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this one. it only has just a trace amount of heat to it, but it is very enjoyable. i was very much enjoying the coffee flavor of this stout. definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys coffee flavored ales."

"Ashy at times. Didn't really perceive any heat of flavor for the most part of my drinking experience related to the peppers. Yes, it does grow as the beer warms, but I think Stone has a cheaper alternative (smoked porter w/ chipotle) that is easier to find and better quality. Good enough, but won't be stocking up on these."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a black color with a half finger of off white head. There is just a touch of heat in this beer until the finish when the peppers ramp up. I'm getting some coffee, but it's more in the background than the peppers. Just enough sweetness from the roasted malt."
""
""
""

"B-"
"O: As someone who loves spice and coffee this beer ultimately let me down with only moderate coffee notes and non-existent spice presence."

"O- if it wasn't for the crazy high carbonation this would be a very good beer. Nice amount of coffee and chocolate with some pepper burn."
"First thing I noticed wasn't the taste, but how this bear foamed up right when it hit my tongue.. it's HIGHLY carbonated. The medium-full body brings a bunch of roasted coffee beans right upfront and through the mid-palate. The beer finishes with the slightest heat and then more coffee, only to be followed by by a bit of an itch in my throat form the peppers again. The flavor of this beer is coffee-forward and comes in waves. Quite interesting, but the burps come in waves afterward too."
""
"O:  Overall, this is one I would pass on in the future.  I like how big the chipotle heat is, but the stout flavors and characteristics just arent there.  I appreciate what they were trying to do, but its sure as hell no Mexican Cake.  "
"Drink- I enjoyed it. I am just not a fan like I said of the smoky hot thing. I like the addition of the coffee on this one and it was a good idea to keep the ABV low to make everything a bit more mellow and not compete against the booze."
"Pours black, and has a rim of light tan foam and quite a bit of clarity. Smells of herbal hops, some some, some soily dust, bits of coffee and some cardboard. Taste is empty, watered down stout with toasted and roated malts, some coffee, a little too much smoke flavor, some hints of coconut and weedy. Mouth is empty with alittle too hi carb and an off dry finish. Okay beer. My wife really dug it so she drank most of the bottle."
""
"O- I like my stouts and porters very much, this one is a very filling and bold stout. I don't know about breaking the wallet for one, but if you can afford it go for it! Yum yum YUM!"
""
""
""
""
"So there are a few differences between the nitro and non-nitro versions. The nitro version is easier to take, while the non-nitro version fills your mouth with more spicy peppers and coffee. I'm totally taking this ride again."
"Picked up a bomber while in El Segundo. I opened the bottle after dinner and it makes a fine dessert beer. It's by no means sweet, but there's a medium, thicker body and tasty cocoa notes. I only get the slighted hint of chipotle and heat once the beer warms to cellar temperature, but it's a nice touch. This is definitely not a beer to drink too cold, the subtle flavors are totally lost. I'm not getting any noticeable coffee, but the smooth chocolate liquor taste, balanced by a mild roast will ease your mind and please your palate. Give this a try if you find it."

"No false advertising here- it says chipotle coffee stout on the bottle and that's exactly what it is. Not as big or complex as I prefer my stouts but overall it's not bad at all. No problems finishing the bottle myself in one sitting but not something I'll hunt in the future. "
"Pours a very dark brown color...borderline black. Has a small tan head. Scent is nice and toasty with some roasted malt and chocolate cocoa. Sweet vanilla and some cinnamon as well. Fresh coffee. Not really any chile or chipotle in the aroma. Taste is a little different however. Initially, there is a definite chile pepper flavor. Not heat, but just the flavor. The heat is very subdued and only comes through on the tip of the tongue after quite a few sips of this. Not overwhelming at all, just some tingling heat that lingers on the tip of the tongue and the lips. There are lovely coffee flavors and great cocoa taste. Very well balanced and a great way to introduce someone to what peppers can do to a beer. Mouthfeel is where this beers lacks... it's a little too light (I wish I could try the bourbon barrel aged version). Mild spicy finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer is an outstanding chile stout. I would definitely buy more of this."
""
"O: Overall, this was just slightly above average for me. I like the addition of chipotle peppers, just wish they were more present in the aroma. However, their presence in the taste saved this one for me."
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice stout and the touch of hot chipotle is a nice touch for some depth."
"Overall: If you don't mind the light carbonation of it, its still a solid drink. I really wish it had more carbonation though, because I believe it would liven up the flavors. The man who was doing the samples said to get it on tap, and I think it'd help."
"Smooth beer, very smooth. Initial hits of the coffee flavor, den that lil spicy note crept up on me like all sudden n stuff. Kinda like wen I'm watchin tha Dodgers in my own zone, n my girl all of a sudden asks me for a 20 to get her nails did. She look good with her nails did."

"Chewy body with a good balance of sweet chocolate and roasted malt.  Lots of sweet and bitter dark chocolate along with hints of toffee, coffee and oatmeal.  Toward the end of the palate there is a prominent chili pepper spiciness that lingers well after the finish.  Chocolate and chili well integrated, creating a well balanced and flavorful sipper.  Reminds me of an artisan chocolate bar."
"Bootlegger's should only put this on nitro. It's so much amazingly better than the carbed up version."
""
"O- Tasty, smells nice. Appearance and feel are less than perfect. Would love to try at the source."
"Phoenix is a very, very good porter, especially on nitro. Gentle pepper heat and nice roasty flavors. The body isn’t quite up to the standard of most nitro beers, but it’s good enough here."

"O- Could have been decent, ended up a blank, foamy, light, liquid. Not sure if a batch issue or what, but I see some reviews eith my same problem and some without. The base porter I could taste really was decent, but everything else... sigh"
""
"overall not bad and higher hopes. wasnt a fan of the spicy mocha after taste."
"Overall it's a good beer and real easy to drink. I was just disappointed by the lack of chipotle representation in the flavor and the mouthfeel."
"O - This beer is not too bad. Some good stuff, but there is all sorts of bubbles goin on, and it's not helping."
""

"O: Pretty tasty, and it was my first from this brewery, gotta keep my eye out for more during my trip to Cali to try more of their offerings."
"Thanks to Monkeymagic for this. Poured into a snifter. At first lots of carbonation, not sure if that's from movement during shipping. Very black beer, after all it is 'Black Phoenix.' Could smell the coffee in the beer. Tasted dark chocolate malts and coffee flavor. Didn't taste the chipotle very much. Very smokey finish but just too carbonated for me, for a stout. But was overall a good beer."
"o: pretty interesting, fairly tasty. worth a try"
"Feels lightish to medium bodied. Seems right for the style."
"Overall I'm a bit disappointed in this brew. I did have high hopes and almost from beginning to end not a very pleasant experience. I'm hoping it was a fluke and later on down the line I'll get a bottle that will impress me and I'll get to re-review this beer but for now this is where I must stand: an over-carbonated mess that was either past its prime or just a horrible brew. Looking at other reviews i hope its the former and not the latter."
"A simple though uninteresting chili stout--nothing special, but nothing unpleasant either."
"The post-fantasy football draft party continues here. This stuff pours a garnet-highlighted black-brown topped by a finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises light coffee, hickory smoke, roasted malts, light dark chocolate, and a rather light twinge of hot pepper in the background. I'm not entirely certain how much the power of suggestion was at work here, but I could swear the pepper was back there. The taste holds notes of mild smoke, roasted malts, watered-down coffee, and a larger bit of pepper in the back. With every drink, the pepper seems to grow more powerful, similar to the effect found in Hunahpu's (just with different flavors surrounding it). It makes for an interesting taste experience, believe you me. Unfortunately, the ancillary flavors are all kinda weak, save for the roasted malts. The body is a straight medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a rather enjoyable brew. I was hoping for something a bit thicker and more full-bodied, but it wasn't too big a deal here. I'd also been worried that the pepper had faded (seemed to be the recent review consensus), but instead it seemed the coffee had faded, though this allowed for a nice cumulative pepper effect. I'd say this brew was a success regardless, just not a monstrous one."
"Dark brown with about a centimeter of light brown head that quickly fades away to a ring around the edge of the glass. Certainly not bad looking as it rests in the tulip glass, but not exceptional either. Smells of fresh coffee, very subtle chili, a touch of chocolate, faint caramel, and some grassy hops. Taste is a little bigger than the nose, with some roasted coffee notes up front, roasted chocolate malt, caramel, lighter hops in the middle, and a mild chili flavor in the very end. For some reason, it makes me think of poblano peppers instead of chipotle, which seems a bit odd even to me, but it works alright. Mouth is a bit watery in between bursts of flavor, feels a bit under-carbonated, and finishes quite dry and sticky. Overall, a rather average coffee stout. The addition of the pepper mixes it up a bit, but really doesn't add much value to the beer for me. I'm certainly glad to have tried it, but I wouldn't actively seek it again."
"D - Not sure how old this bottle was - I've know Chris and Bobby for about a year, so I haven't had this bottle for more than a few months. Hopefully I'll get to try this fresh and it's a significant improvement. However, Bootlegger's could using some bottle dating. Coffee and pepper flavors seemed to fall out rather quickly in this beer."
"Cheers..."
"Future outlook: Enjoyed this for-me-one-off that I drug back from Cali....doesn't make it out here though, so unlikely to encounter again."
"O: This beer is really on the edge of quite good and just good for me. The smell would be a lot weaker if it wasn't for that smokiness, but the chipotle in that smokiness is a hard note to pick out. Furthermore, the taste is a bit tame considering the ingredients. The chocolate and coffee is there, but the chipotle is done with a pretty light hand. Lastly, the body is saved by the creamy sensation of smokey adobo. This is a good beer with a lot of saving graces in each category. Definitely worth trying, and I think Bootleggers have a decent starting recipe to a much better beer."
"O: Definitely not a bad beer. Good mix of flavors, but I think it was a little simplistic and straightforward, and underplayed it's most interesting ingredient: chipotle. Worth picking up if you like the aforementioned flavors; not worth picking up if you're looking for an intense pepper experience or just something complex and new. Hats off to bootlegger's, though, as everything I've had from them so far has at least been good."
"Overall: I really really really like this beer as I am writing this I actually just cracked another one I like it so much. The peppers are noticeable but are very well balanced. The coffee and chocolate notes really give this beer a great flavor."
"Overall an ok beer. Not bad. Worth a try. Might have it again"
"Overall, I like this beer and think it's a very tasty stout. Like I said before, the coffee in this is better than some I've had before. It seems to be very well integrated. The chipotle adds a weird angle, once you have a glass or two and start to realize it's there. Enjoyable brew."
"D: Overall, not what I was expecting after reading the description. Fails to deliver on the promise of chipotle. Coffee was decent but couldn't carry this beer on it's own"
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch dark khaki head that fades to a thin cap. Random spots of lacing form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee beans, and a smokiness from the chipotle. Taste is just like the smell with a nice roasty pepper taste that lingers after each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. The body on this beer is somewhat light for a stout though. Overall, this is a good stout and I really like the smoked chipotle aroma and flavor found in this beer."
"A large medium tan headed formed atop the pitch black body. Good retention. Aroma includes smoky bqq, coffee, dark chocolate and heavy focus on the roasted malts. Dark chocolate, earthy. Clean ferrmentation. Non-threatening, moderate level of bitterness. Carbonation level seems slightly high, medium-bodied."
"Beer is medium in body and pretty bitter at the back, lots of roasted coffee coming up in this one overall. The beer has this mildly dry finish and on that desert of a palate remains this slight smoky heat. Interesting. The chili flavor comes out the more I drink it, the stronger it gets but it never get overwhelming. It is just resting there, in the background popping up to remind you, ""This isn't a porter it is a chile beer"" -- I don't think I'd have it again but I did enjoy it."
"D - Fun to try."
"Taste is bittersweet chocolate and some decent coffee roastiness. The chipotle addition is more of a light smoke/ash presence as opposed to spicy pepperiness, which is fine by me as I typically have not enjoyed any of the other beers I have had with chipotle. Mouthfeel is less than full, but enough and certainly not thin. Good beer, wasnt sure what to expect but it is a very nice little coffee stout here. Makes me want to try some more offerings from Bootlegger's. Nice and low ABV makes it that much more enjoyable."
"This is most certainly reminiscent of a stout, like Bootlegger's claims, however classifying this as a Chile Beer here is wrong, IMO. Nonetheless, this is probably the best example I've seen of how to properly use chipotle peppers in a beer. They should not be the focus, instead blended with other flavors that will play well off each other -- something Bootlegger's has done."
"Drank most of a tulip glass at Pizza Port in Ocean Beach, San Diego."
"O: Slightly above average. It's a bit mild on the chipotle side, but it's still there, and in that regard, a good intro for the Chile beer style, imho. Still pretty solid, and I've enjoyed it when I've had it. So far, it's been my favorite offering from Bootleggers."
"Viewed as a Sweet Stout vs. this Chile nonsense...Yet still quite marginal overall. Bottom line, yet another overpriced wannabe. Check please..."
"This was an exceptional surprise. I was expecting to have just another tick but this beer is actually quite good. I would gladly drink another."
"The aroma of rich dark coffee dominates this brew with a slight chipotle coming up in the back end. In the taste department you get a lot of coffee at first. I think if this was marketed as a coffee brew alone it would be fantastic but the chili pepper is under done a bit. There was some but I really had to think about it to pick it out. I think it just needs a touch more chili the concept was great but it didn’t quite come thru for me."
"Smells like a porter with a few muted coffee notes and peppers. Tastes decent but the chipotle part isn't really doing it for me; I'm almost getting an ashtray taste hiding behind the peppers. I still drank the bottle, but not sure I'd get this one again."
"Overall: A decent chipotle brew."
"smooth, mellow, yet just enough character to keep me interested. I could see myself drinking a few more of these easily."
"mouthed...rauchiness...a thin beer not too hearty....a small bit o chipotle...an odd combination that could work with perhaps a bit more sweetness or malty creaminess...6.7%...it is decent to try the once...but nothing i will try again unless on tap or cask..."
"Drinkability - Goes down smooth. A great late night beer (as I am enjoying right right now) handled in moderation."
"Absolutely nothing I would ever go out of my way to have again: a pedestrian stout with a dash of pepper. I don't like chile beer sin general and this one didn't change my mind."
"D- I'll admit I have fall in love with add a dash of chipotle to beers. I've brewed my own chipotle ale turned out great. Its a great twist on a all ready good porter (or maybe its masking some of its bad traits) who knows... I def plan to drink more of this, although after one you might be running a risk of heart burn."
"Overall, this is a good, nice, drinkable stout with a hint of chili spice. I like it a lot, even though I wish there was a little more spice kick"
"Overall, decent beer. It could be awesome if it wasn't so roasted. Somewhat drinkable."
"To wrap this up I would have to say that I like this beer. I think it could just be the bottle that gave this beer the lacking smell and taste. I would love to get a nice big glass of this right from the tap. My local beer stores here in San Diego are selling a 22oz bottle of this for $5.99. I think this is very reasonable price considering the expensive ingredients that went into making this darkness. I would say if you like dark beers with coffee and have never tried one with chipotle peppers than pick up a bottle of this and enjoy."
"Vigorous pour gets you two plus fingers of creamy dark brown foam, all micro-bubbles with a uniformly flat surface, you can see hundreds of bubbles popping at once as it simmers down to the surface with ease, the foam glides down the glass sides in solid sheets, no lacing. As expected, the liquid is pure jet black without a trace of color, appears to have no haziness. Wastes no time unleashing the chipotle peppers, albeit the heavily roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate and cocoa, follows up with lactose, cumin and coriander spice, over time the pepper recedes in favor of earth, muddy straw and cigar ash. Medium-bodied, firm and muscular, the weak carbonation would surprise if you only viewed the glass after the pour and not minutes later when there is absolutely no bubbles to found anywhere. As a result, the heat and spice are able to soak in and maintain as consistent a presence as the bitter dark chocolate, coffee and milk cream. Except for the burn there's no real roughness, smooth enough overall texture. Oatmeal, corn bread, biscuit breadiness is doughy and not that sweet. Momentary touch of orange peel. Any greenness is akin to tea leaves or tobacco wrappers. Not particularly complex but does show determination in getting its few words across."
"D - this is a really good chile beer. The chipotle isn't as in your face as I have experienced with other chile beers; instead, the are more subtle and complementary in their use. Big thanks to MaxStout for sending this to my doorstep - I really enjoyed this one!"
"D: I really enjoyed this beer that featured some roastiness chocolate and chipotle peppers. I just just wished the chipotle character was more potent throughout. Still drank good and was a decent brew."
"it was drinkable at approx six percent and felt alright in the boca."
"Pretty please?!?!"
"The palate is also pretty good, heavy on the grainy/bready malt and dark roasted coffee, light on the chipotle flavor and heat. The beer grows in complexity as it warms, bringing the chipotle flavor closer to the forefront. The finish is roasty and mildly hot, which lingers nicely. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I'd like, but hefty enough. This was surprisingly enjoyable."
"HV"
"O - Nice beer overall. I'll definitely be sampling another to see if I just got an off bottle."
"D: I couldn't drink this all day, but it's quite nice. One bomber is probably good for me! I absolutely love this beer now."
"D - Okay. This is an okay coffee stout, but with the light, almost unnoticeable pepper flavor and heat, its just a little bit weird."
"Drinkability - Damn drinkable. And for how cheap this beer is, a definite repeat. Bootleggers continues to impress!"
"D: For $5 it's well-priced, and it's tastier than a number of traditional stouts. I'd buy it again."
"The beer pours a dark reddish-brown color with a white head. The aroma is very nice. I get chocolate, coffee, smoke and roasted malt. The flavor is roasted malt, chocolate and smoke. Medium to thick mouthfeel and low carbonation. I don't get a lot of pepper flavor or aroma, but I get the smoke from the chipotles. Very nice beer."
"Very dark pour with a huge tan head on top. a lot of foam at first that quickly receedes into nice fluffy head. Mocha and chocolate aroma upfront. Bit of roasted graininess, mildly metallic. Improves as it warms aroma wise. Big roasted mocha and chocolatey flavors with a decent level of roasted grains. The chile peppers tend to come thru near the end with a pleasant bite on the back of the tongue. Coffee is more of an afterthought here-hence the mocha flavor over straight coffee? Smooth and velvety mouthfeel for the most part-a bit acrid in the finish. Very enjoyable and well balanced between the ingredients in here."
"D-At only 6.7% it's pretty easy drinking. I'm really loving how the peppers and coffee shine in their own ways and compliment each other."
"This beer is really bad. Big fail for Bootlegger's. Made it through about an inch of this beer before the rest went down the drain."
"Dark brown to black beer without head. My nose is greeted with pleasing milk chocolate and coffee aromas immediately. Also, a certain milky creaminess and a little smoke. Very chocolaty taste, I wouldn't put this in the chile beer catagory at all, even though chiles are used. Would we put Wrath of Pecant in the plantain catagory just because they are used? You know what I mean. There isn't much chile or spice to this beer at all, maybe a hint of chipotle late in the swallow. It could much easier pass as a coffee stout. It's clean with quite active carbonation. It's enjoyable, but you know what not to expect."
"Nicely done. I'd drink this again."
"D: Good, nice drinkable stout with a hint of chili. I like it a lot."
"This one is pretty good, actually. Interesting and worth a second look. Hopefully that Chlorine smell was just my imagination."
"Pours a deep, rich black color, with a nice, dense brown head. Coffee is prevalent on the nose, along with dark chocolate and just a hint of the promised chipotle. Tastes like a big roasty porter, with hints of coffee, smoke, chocolate and chipotle. As the beer warms, I start to feel a little more of the heat coming through. A very nice effort; smooth, flavorful and easy to drink."
"Overall this wasn't the best example of a chile stout I've had however it didn't skimp on the chile flavor like some others I've had either. Worth a shot."
"D-this is a great stout! I actually am not a huge chile beer guy and would prefer the chilies not in this to take away that peppery spice; but, knowing that is what they wanted the rest of the stout properties are great! Big flavors, nice roasted malts, chocolate, and a little sweetness at the finish with a very solid body. I'd love to try a regular (or even better an imperial) stout!"
"D: Not nearly as ""bad"" as I was expecting, for the style, that is. From talking to people, it seems they have dialed back the chipotle component, and it's for the better of the beer. It's not spicy, but does have a little kick. That said, it wasn't my favorite beer, but an interesting one to try."
"Won't be revisiting."
"This is a very complex and original stout with the peppers really bringing something different to the table. I really enjoyed this one."
"Overall this was pretty damn solid I have to say. Nothing really over the top and the pepper really balanced well against the coffee, playing off each other very nicely. A solid brew from top to bottom."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. Medium amount of head. Strong coffee aroma and light nutty and chile aromas. Slightly spicy front end followed by powerful coffee/stoutish flavors on the back end. Light to moderate sweetness. Low carbonation/very smooth going down typical of style."
"d - pretty drinkable, actually, which is surprising for a coffee/chipotle beer, the alcohol is well hidden though not all that high to begin with at 6.7%"
"Paired real well with our sweet and hot pepper cheddar"
"D - Not sure how many of these I would really comsume in a night, probably just one. This is tasty beer, and very unique, but like all spicy foods, the more you drink the more chipotle you taste. The burn is not intense, but it is there. One and done for me."
"Notes: I could definitely see how some people would love this beer. If what you're looking for is some smoky spiciness in your American Stout, then this is probably your holy grail. Personally, as much as I liked the aroma, it just didn't float my boat when it hit my palate. Still, excited to see a Bootlegger's brew in a local shop. Gotta support the locals!"
"D: A very nice beer from Bootlegger's. Both of the local North County breweries have made a chile beer and both have turned out to be really good. Check this effort out."
"Served on tap at the Verdugo Bar. This beer came out black as night with only a trace of head that quickly fizzled away. A little disappointing, until I got a whiff. The nose was a big hit of coffee. I don't particularly care for coffee by itself but I love me some coffee in my beer. This one did not disappoint. The taste was more of the same, fresh ground coffee perfectly blended with roasted malts and a touch of spice at the end. The chipotle takes a back seat in this beer, with the coffee up front and then a nice touch of spice in the finish, complimenting the beer instead of overpowering it. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a medium body. I could have had a few of these if the Verdugo didn't have so many great beers to try. Overall this was an excellent beer, well balanced and extremely drinkable. I'll be looking for more of these in the future."
"Recommended. For the locals, if you aren't keeping up with Bootlegger's you are going to get left behind. I have tasted this a couple times on draft as well, the the local roasted coffee stood out more, intense and delicious. I plan on putting up another review for the growler format soon."
"22 ounce bottle purchased from Hi-Times for $4.49, saw this one last bottle on the shelf and snagged it out of curiousity, split with my dad tonight as a big fan of this beer style, poured into my Stone pint glass, color is very dark brown, big 1 1/2 inch creamy tan head, some lacing at the top, decent retention too, aroma consists of mostly coffee, bit of chipotle shining through but nothing like I expected as far as the scent from the peppers, also some roasted malts, smokiness, toffee, and dark chocolate, taste starts off with a slightly sweet coffee flavor, fades into some malt in the middle that is a little roasted, finish is the same but a mild burning sensation from the peppers, once this beer warms up you can taste them more but not much at any point, not like other chile beers I have had in the past at least, roasted, slightly sweet and spicy mouthfeel, medium bodied, moderate carbonation, taste lingers well, could have drank this bomber but not much after that, pretty heavy for how low the ABV is, sweet and spicy at times which can throw the stomach for a loop, still decent drinkability considering its style, would drink again, this was a limited release according to the label but I hope to see it again, recommended"
