"Did I just eat a piece of chocolate cake? Fantastic!"
""
""
""
"Smelled like fake chocolate cake, tasted like a watered down milky brown ale (though its considered a stout, it was transparent in my glass). Just not good."
""
""
""

"Delicious tastes like chocolate cake, may be a little overwhelming though."
"Overall: It really gets the chocolate ""check in the box"" but there is no base beer to set as a canvas. It's just a watered down chocolate drink. It really is unfortunate because the chocolate stands out and would probably work great on a beer that has some flavor and body. I wouldn't recommend it."
"I unscrewed the cap after making my wish (Shhh!) and commenced an aggro pour, resulting in a finger of light-tan head that quickly fell to wisps. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled like Devils Food Cake or a rich chocolate brownie! Zounds! Mouthfeel was kind of thin and watery, especially for a Stout. The taste was really amazing and I really have to give a Tip o' the Wood to the reviewer who said ""yellow cake with chocolate icing""! Spot on! I was braced for it to be sickeningly sweet, but it was very pleasant. I did not have a cake since I am not big on sweets, but this stood in nicely in lieu of one. The finish was semi-sweet and the chocolate was not front and center as I imagined, but there was a cake-like flavor leading the way, instead. Happy Beer-thday to us all!"

"Does not have the usual texture of a stout, and has an an aroma of tootsie rolls and Kahlua-like taste."
"Shiner Birthday Beer Chocolate Stout -----4/5."
""
""
""
""
"Surprisingly this is a really great chocolate stout. The chocolate, to me, taste more like s chocolate ice cream. This is due in part to the creamy feel of the stout. Give this one a try. Really good!"
""
""
"Overall a very enjoyable and favorable offering from shiner.   Much better than I have come to expect from them over the last several years.  This is a very well done option that is not typical of their offerings."
""
"Overall: if you want a beer that tastes pretty much EXACTLY like a chocolate birthday cake, look no further.  Shiner could make a fortune off of this beer if they made it year-round and told Gabriel Iglesias about it, that's how similar it is to chocolate cake.  I haven't tried any other beer from Shiner yet (their Bock is the only one I ever see around here, though I did spot a few others in the Roanoke area alongside this one), but if the special beer for their 107th birthday is on the same level of yumminess as the 106th, I'll be sure to check that out when it comes around.  Heck, I may just have to get some more of their 106th Birthday Beer for my 29th that's coming up in a few months--it'd be a shame to only have this once in my entire life!"
"Pours black with a thin head. Smells like fudge brownies. The smell is incredible and is really the best aspect of this beer. The taste is reminiscent of a stale tootsie roll. Not much complexity here. Very thin mouthfeel. Overall, it's just not a very good stout. The smell from the bottle was very nice though."

"yummy."

"I've never tasted a beer that taste exactly what it's going for like this beer. Holy shit it's chocolate cake! But, at the same time it's gross because I'm drinking beer that taste like chocolate cake! Awesomely interesting"
""
""
""
"The great chocolate aroma but downplayed chocolate sweet flavor make this quite drinkable."
"Tried this beer today after finding it at the store. WOW....I want more of this stuff. It was as if I just drank a piece of chocolate cake! This is a very limited beer so if you want to try  .....and can still find it buy it. It's definitely worth a try if you like this style of beer. I bought the last one so I'm on the hunt for at least one more of these before they are gone for good."
"Very light taste, great smell."
""
"Overall : I'm going to stop writing so I can enjoy this beer. Fabulous session stout with no off flavors and a milky, silky feel."

"O-  Not bad, glad I got a free can!"
""
"Nice dark color. Good head that sticks around. The taste reminds me of footsie rolls. Overall a really nice beer."
""
"Overall I was quite impressed. This is the first Shiner beer I've tried. Everything about it screams old scool and it is enjoyable."
""
""
""
"The aroma is straight up a mixture of chocolate cake and tootsie rolls. The taste is thinner than expected and very sweet."
"Overall- would try again on a hot winter day."

"A nice dark beer with the rich chocolate finish"
"This beer goes from being enjoyable to inoffensive at best as you drink it. Nice creamy chocolate notes give way to a taste not to dissimilar to soy sauce. Started out liking this one; ended up disliking it."
"PLEASE bring back the ability to just give a number for a rating.   this outlier/review stuff just sucks.   as does this horrible beer.  watery fake chocolate flavor is nothing close to what i consider a stout.  probably my last shiner beer"
""
"I bought a 12 pack with high hopes. I keep trying them, and drain pouring. Aroma is spot on,  initial taste is spot on, so I guess by those standards the brewers hit the nail on the head. However I have a hard time stomaching more than half a bottle. As offerings from shiner go I'd rank it at the bottom. Any ratings over a 3 I find hard to believe. I was thouroughly disappointed because im a stout lover, and a shiner supporter. I'd rather drink a tequiza than this though"
"Wooooooooooooio so so so wo"
""
"THIS WAS TERRIBLE. As someone who loves dark beer this was almost undrinkable. It tasted like someone took shitty beer and added Nesquick to it. Also no nice foamy top, which just made me sad."
""
""
"THIS BEER NEEDS TO BE DRANK VERY COLD OUT OF THE BOTTLE , ITS THE TITS THAT WAY.  SUPER CHOCOLATE, NEVER GIVES UP , BUT NOT SWEET"
""
""
"Taste-Cocoa, toasted malt, cashews, vanilla. Faintly sweet. Think ""chocolate frosted yellow cake"" and the flavors will reveal themselves. Interesting flavor."
""
""
""
"I've had other chocolate stouts that were decent but I find this one to be very heavy on the chocolate side. If you like really sweet beers, I say go for it. However, I find this beer hard to drink and agree that it tastes like a tootsie roll."
"Spotted this at whole foods. Bought it for my birthday was a little bit disappointed with the taste."
""
"Is no one going to say it?  It tastes exactly like a tootsie roll! Very good if you like dessert beers. I wish shiner made a normal stout that they kept on the shelf."
"We need to fix this outlier thing..."
""
"Review (not optional). Good beer."
"Dark and intensely flavorful with virtually no effervescence or bitterness.  The heavy, intense chocolate notes over power any secondary notes or flavors, rendering ""Birthday"" an occasional indulgence.  Not at all refreshing.  Best when served very cold in a chilled glass.  I could never drink more than one at a sitting.  A huge minus."
"this beer is ridiculous. i mean, its really neat that they got so much flavor into the beer, and i have to respect that because its unique, but i would never be able to finish a whole one of these. it smells and tastes exactly like cake batter for a chocolate cake or brownie, straight hersheys in the taste, and the nose has more of a vanilla cocoa complexion, but its anything but subtle, and the fact that its a beer instead of a milkshake is entirely lost on me. aside from being cold and wet, nothing about this is beer-like at all, which obviously negatively impacts my overall opinion of it. it hardly even seems like a beverage, more like a dessert, so much chocolate at to be diabetic in its sweetness, and it never finishes, i taste this for hours. i cool project i suppose, to invent the most overly flavorful beer ever brewed, but it does very little for me in terms of overall satisfaction. i encourage you to try it though, there absolutely isnt anything else like this in the market."

"Good beer for a birthday.  Very smooth chocolatey taste with a thick, tight, foamy head."

"tastes watered down. Nice chocolate flavor but bad finish"
"Over all... not worth another try."
""
"A different taste for a stout; on the sweet side; actually tastes a little like birthday cake; not my favorite but I would drink it again"
"Guess my sweet taste buds are jacked up, because this did not taste as decadent as cake or icing to me. That being said, it does exhibit sweet, toasted caramel flavors but to me, not as sweet as everyone made it seem. Mouthfeel is appropriate for a birthday cake theme, yet viscosity could be thicker. I'd drink it again, but I'm still on the hunt for a FANTASTIC dessert beer."
""

"You want to like this, yet the residual sugars and cloyingly sweet character generally  detract from the beer overall. It tastes like a German chocolate cake or very sweet chocolate fudge which may appeal to some folks, but for those looking for a better balanced chocolate stout, you may want to keep looking..."
"Way too sweet. It tastes like chocolate frosting in a bottle. Don't get my wrong, I love chocolate but this is way too rich. It needs some balance."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 4/12/2015. Pours slightly hazy very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, fudge, vanilla, cream, and light toast. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and cocoa notes; with good strength. Smells exactly like chocolate cake and frosting. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, toffee, fudge, cream, light toast, and slight herbal hops. Minimal roast/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, fudge, vanilla, cream, and light toast on the finish for a good bit. Good balance, complexity, and solid robustness of dark/roasted malt and cocoa flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this a very good sweet stout. All around good balance, complexity, and solid robustness of dark/roasted malt and cocoa flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Great taste. Good choice it taste alot like chocolate."
"Very nice and gentle chocolate cake smell and taste!"
""
"Good start, it DOES smell and taste like really good chocolate cake at first, but middle and aftertaste a bit like that lame Canfield's chocolate soda from the 1970s. I'd buy it again."
""
"Tasted like a chocolate cupcake."
""
""
"Grainy.  Unbalanced.  Below Spoetzel high standards.   Bring back Cheer!"
""
"Definitely a novelty."
""
""
"Pours a black color.  1 inch head of an off-tan color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, strong chocolate, hint of yeast, hint of alcohol, hint of wood, and slight of coconut.  Fits the style of an American Stout.  Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of strong chocolate, strong sweet malt, hint of yeast, hint of coconut, and a hint of wood.  Overall, this beer tastes the most similar to actual chocolate cake, than any beer I've ever had.  This was quite appropriate since there is a birthday cake on the bottle.  The chocolate and the sweet malt are very strong, so the balance is off, but I will rate with the intention of making a cake beer in mind."
""
""
"Feel: medium+ body; smooth; overly lively carbonation."
"Tastes like chocolate birthday cake!... but is that a good thing?"
"Really sweet tasting beer! It's like a bottle of chocolate cake frosting!"
""
"Pours a very dark brown with tan head. Smells like chocolate cake, and kind of tastes like it too. Not bad."
""
""
"Tastes like there is a significant amount of artificial extract. Not a good beer."
""
""
""
"Dark, almost black. Sugary, chocolate, cream scent. Lightly toasted chocolate taste. Light, almost thin feel. Good gateway beer for milk stouts (or dessert beers), but not that great of an example of the style."
"Overall: Hostess Cupcakes at 5.0% ABV."
""
""
"This doesn't seem like a stout hugh dark molasses head leaving quick to a lite glaze smell like baker chocolate taste like baker chocolate not sweet to me glade I tried but wont buy again"
""
""
""
"Overly sweet chocolate. More porter than stout."
"I was excited to try this but we're not talking subtle dark chocolate undertones here.   It's like drinking a chocolate egg cream that is heavy on the chocolate syrup.  My girlfriend who only drinks ciders or lambics and generally hates beer absolutely loved it.   Too sweet for my taste.  A dessert beer."
"Overall, I wish I only bought one of these and not a six pack. Sad to say that I'm disappointed. On the plus side, six year olds would love it (of course, please don't give beer to six year olds)."
""
""
""
"3.52/5.00"
"Dark brown pour with brown head and sweet chocolate aromas.  Sweet upfront with a soda like, slightly roasted finish.  Excellent flavors, aromas & drinkability.  Much better & easier to enjoy than some of the over powered Imperial sweet stouts."
""
""
"The taste is has a kind of chocolate and vanilla syrup flavor to it with only the vaguest of hops at the end.  It is very sweet."
""
""
"This brings the chocolate in a big way. Almost too much though. I feel like I'm drinking a fizzy birthday cake, and couldn't have more than two in a sitting. That being said, it is delicious if you don't mind tasting more chocolate than beer."
""
""
"chocolatey and not much else, a bit light for a stout. might go great with a scoop of ice cream."
""
""
"Generally I'm very picky about my stouts, mostly liking Irish dry stouts and not much else; but I really enjoyed this one. As some have noted it doesn't necessarily have that much of a ""stout flavor", but this is a chocolate stout; don't believe that there is much of an established criteria for a chocolate stout unless you're comparing it to another one. I felt it a had a perfect balance with the chocolate and sweetness; I find many others to have a battle between the chocolate, bitterness and sweetness not blending well on the palate. Not here, maybe because there's not much bitterness here, other than just enough to give it a really good overall balance. To me it tasted like a piece of chocolate cake.... a really good piece of chocolate cake. So far, my favorite chocolate stout I've had to date. I believe this would be a really good beer for a novice beer drinker or perhaps one new to craft beers and/or stouts and maybe doesn't like really dark bitter beers. To me this is a really easy beer for people to like, provided you like chocolate and don't have any preconceived ideas as to what a chocolate stout should taste like."
"A weird tasting beer that just does not work. An artificial chocolate flavor dominates the smell and the taste is a very thin imitation of a real stout. If it had a good basic stout flavor that actually had chocolately notes complimented with the addition of natural, subtly flavored chocolate, then this combo might have worked. The chocolate is just too in your face and conflicts with the essential taste of the beer. It's not a horrible beer but it is not a good rich stout. Thank god I only paid 7 for this brew, I saw it for 10 at another store and hope that this review will prevent someone from throwing that away :)"
"Not into this one."
""
"Overall - I do not think it is fair to thrash this beer too badly, although it is overwhelming with the chocolate flavors. Yes, it does go a bit overboard, or maybe a lot overboard, but it is still a drinkable beer, especially if you like sweet beers or for a special occasion, i.e. a birthday. I will say it is worth your time to drink, if for no other reason than I bet you have never tasted anything quite like it before."
"The taste reminded me more of chocolate milk or Yoohoo than of chocolate cake. Interesting idea but this beer missed the mark for me."
"As I said,  it is what it is. Not the best or even close to the best stouts out there but it's a masterpiece in its own right. Highly recommend to try, you don't like it you lost two bucks tops."
"d thumb DOWN"

"Tastes like a malty fudgesicle! Not so much a stout."
""
"Had to try this because it's Shiner.  This is very chocolatey, so much so that it's kinda like drinking brownie or chocolate cake mix.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  I put my ratings in the middle because the jury is still out on this one.  Smells nice, looks good, but I wasn't crazy about it.  But then after the glass was empty I kinda wanted more.  So thanks for the intrigue, Shiner."
"Wow this the a good beer for appearance and scent....tough for taste and mouthfeel.  Worth a try...sure."

"Shiner never disappoints. Well balanced and delicious beer, goes down smoothly. I'd drink this again and again."

"This beer has an aroma of chocolate cake batter that is really quite impressive. The flavor is chocolate cake as well, but not as rich and decadent as the nose. It's easy drinking and finishes dry with a cocoa powder finish. Exceeded my expectations by a long shot. I'd drink this again..."
""
""
"Ewwww not really a stout."
""
"Bought two 12 oz. bottles, drank one and gave the other away. The smell was just too much chocolate cake frosting. The taste was the same. So much so that it tasted artificially flavored. The feel was thinner than I expected and was a bit underwhelming. Glad I didn't buy a six pack."
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown with about a two finger head, leaving a little lacing on the glass. I have to admit, i was a little suprised by the aroma, it kind of smells just like a slice of bready chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. A bit sweet, but interesting nevertheless. The aroma gave me a little hope for this beer but then the flavor is what lost me, very watery. Nothing ""bad"" or ""offensive", but very lacking. Mouthfeel, was about medium, slightly creamy. Wouldn't care to purchase another one of these, but it is not the worst beer out there. I think people who are generally scared of ""darker beers"" may appreciate it. Not something i could see anyone wanting to drink a lot of."
"AP: Poured a murky deep rusty brown. Can see light through it. Giant caramel colored head slowly settled into just a faint frosting over the top. Slight residual lacing pooled together very quickly. AR: Smell was over the top death by chocolate. No roast, no nuttiness. Just straight out of the jar sugary frosting. TA: Slightly bitter licorice front gives way to under baked chocolate cake. Tastes like licking the bowl in the finish, mostly yeasty raw egg. MF: Super thin and watery. OA: I was interested to see if the gimmick worked, no I'm pissed I bought two bottles."
"Lots of chocolate smell and taste, little thin on the body, a bit of a metallic aftertaste"
""
""
"I like a good stout, but this is not it. Too much of the birthday cake gimmick, it tastes like a chocolate protein shake. Glad I bought a single."

"Smells better than it tastes. Smells just like chocolate cake. Too thin for my liking."

"Tasted like a stout with chocolate syrup added."

"I like this beer.  I'd be happy to hear it if Shiner decided to brew this more than once."
""
""
"Black in color with a very minimal amount of light penetrating and only when held up to the light.  A quarter inch of creamy beige head with consistently erupting tiny bubbles of foam is present.  This smells like a Hostess cupcake.  Nailed the aroma and dessert is served.  The flavor is as advertised with the aroma.  Sweet milk chocolate in abundance.  The mouth is very creamy and dry.  If you have a sweet tooth and pair this with raspberries or blueberries you will be in heaven."

"Pretty good beer. Comparable to many big craft name stouts. I enjoyed it for sure!!"

"slight nutty taste, but a nice rich stout taste"
""
""
""
""
"Great beer! Best brew Shiner has put out in a while!"
""
"O:  This one surprised me.  Some folks thought it was too sweet, but my wife and I dove right in.  Would go well with (of course) chocolate cake."
""
""
"I like the taste and smell. It is a good to drink with a Cohiba toro cigar as well. The pair together nicely. It has a nice brown head as well as being a Shiner beer anyway is enough."
""
"The body was OK, smooth and even, but certainly thin for a stout. Drinkability was good, my can was gone quickly, but I'm not sure I'd have several in a row. Overall, a pretty nice brew, and one worth having for a change of pace."
""
""
"Nice chocolate stout. Almost tastes like German chocolate cake"
"If the goal here was to make a birthday cake stout for the birthday beer, mission accomplished. But it's not very stout like. Not chewy at all. Still, I'd have another."
""
"Overall: Not particularly something I would go for again. It does have a good chocolate cake quality about it. I'm glad I tried it though."
"O: Not a great example of a milk stout but still enjoyable - the chocolate flavors as slightly artificial (like cheap chocolates - Hersheys/Russell Stover/Tootsie Rolls). Still easy to drink and just about sessionable."
""
"My mom got me this, saying it was a ""tasty beer"". I've been on a stout kick lately, so I was excited to try it. It didn't live up to expectations. Watery, simple flavor. Drinkable, but not enjoyable."
"Pours deep espresso blackish-brown with glimmers of cherry red when held to the light. Adequate--not abundant--tan head with moderate lacing as the head fades.   Big nose aromas of dark cacao, dark roasted malts, and cherries with hint of birthday cake sweetness (in line with the name).  Taste is lighter than the nose, with more of the birthday cake coming forward in front of the chocolate, with a slightly higher carbonation than expected for a stout.  Enjoyable to drink, glad I bought as single and not a six-pack.  Normally big fan of Spoeztl's offerings and may go for a single again next year."
""
"Of course, this was for a birthday party. Chocolate cocoa Bomb. Not overly sweet. Better as it warms. Great with chocolate almond mocha cake."

"Extremely artificial tasting. The worst chocolate stout I have ever had."

"I really injoyed this beer!"

"Thin, artificial mess. I had seen some decent reviews for this and figured I would give it a chance when I saw a single"

"If this were CakeAdvocate, this beer would get a solid 5. As a beer, it's damn close."
"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and i thought it was a pretty average tasting example of the style, when it came to the aroma it was much more chocolate cake like than I ever expected it would be, but that never really carried over to the taste and in the end I was a little let down.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, a little watery, a little creamy, slightly crisp, not too filling and the taste didn't do a great job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, the taste doesn't really make me want to go back for more.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both good and to me they were the highlights of this beer.  What I like the least about this beer was the taste it wasn't bad, but it lacked that rich chocolate cake aspect that the aroma had.  I might buy this beer again if they release it next year, but it isn't something I'm going to stock up on and I would recommend giving it a try if you really like chocolate stout's but I don't find it to be a stand out for the style.  All in all I wasn't to impressed with this beer, the aroma was just a little impressive, but the taste was not and it left me wanting more out of this beer.  So far this beer falls right in the middle for Shiner and I think it's a pretty average example of the style.  This was a decent beer, but with some work it could be much better, better luck next time guys."
""
""
"Overall: Wow! Happy Birthday Shiner! This is pretty special. I don't think it would hold up well in the cellar, so I'll have to hope they make more in the future. Until then, I'm getting another 6er."
"Not terrible for what it is. Somebody had to make a chocolate stout for people who read ""Chocolate"" on a beer label and want chocolate. Shiner did it. Bummed by the low abv for a stout. Otherwise color and flavor are there. Maybe garnish with mint... ;-)"
""
""
"Bought this on a whim as I love stouts, especially chocolate stouts, and this is under $3 for the bomber, so figured why not. Awesome chocolate smell off the bat, had me encouraged, sadly this was the highlight. Moutfeel? Weird. Rather thin, and yes I realize this is a lower ABV stout, but expected more. Almost like water. The taste is just off putting. I guess it's chocolate, but more of the fake imitation chocolate you run across. It reminds me when as a kid my dad would get cheap and buy the store brand chocolate syrup. Yes it's chocolate syrup, but it was obvious it wasn't the real thing. Outside of the nice smell, this beer is a great example for other on how not to make a chocolate stout."

"Tons chocolate, dough, faint licorice, mild roasted malt, smells like bakery. Taste chocolate cake, light roast, slight bitter sweet finish!"

"Solid dark brown with ruby at the edges. Huge Hershey's chocolate syrup aroma dominates letting little else through. Brownie batter and milk chocolate flavors abound. Kind of sweet and one dimensional, but satisfies like licking a bowl of batter does."

"Ok this is a Birthday Cake Chocolate Stout.  I will not compare this to a serious RIS or BA Stout because I do not believe Spoetzl was going for that.  This is a sweet chocolate stout.  S/Chocolate, a little hops and some roasted malts. T/Chocolate and yes chocolate frosting!  I think if I were to drink a liquid tootsie roll it would taste like this.  No bitterness present in this stout.  I picked up a 6 pack after having this on tap on NYE.  It is a sweet desert beer and I treat it as such.  It is only a 5.0 ABV.  A little thin for a stout but again I don't think they were trying to put out such a stout.  This is certainly a tasty stout and a treat.  I wouldn't drink one every night but I like having it in the fridge.  I will pick up more for the non beer friends that come over and for the occasional sweet low ABV beer.  I was surprised to see this coming from Spoetzl but I think they did a great job on this beer considering what it is."
"Not bad, a bit sweet but easily one of the better beers I've ever had from these guys, a bit one dimensional though"

"Normally, I don't like chocolate stouts. However, Shiner has converted me on this one. As soon as you smell it, it smells like chocolate syrup, but it is DELICIOUS."
""
"Super thin. Smells and tastes artificial. I do not recommend and sent the brewery a note stating such."
"Black, opaque body.  Thin brown head.  Aroma is laden with sweet chocolate.  Not much else.  Lots of chocolate.  Too much chocolate.  Taste brings more of the same.  Like Russell stover chocolate candies.  Mouthfeel is syrupy and slick.  Pretty one sided and artificial tasting.  Not a lot of ""beer"" qualities."
""
"The smell of the beer was chocolate with hints of cherry.  I didn't notice that much carbonation like some of the other reviews.  I thought it was a fine stout.  It's not a heavy stout.  It's very much like a chocolate milk shake with alcohol in it."
"Big chocolate milk aroma...definitely tastes like chocolate as well.   More milk chocolate, (than dark chocolate) with sweeter notes.   That is a all good but the body on this is really lacking.   It is thin and too carbonated....not sure which of those two attributes bothers me more.   Probably the carbonation.   A nice creamy but thin bodied stout is fine in my book but this drinks too charged up.  I'm, tempted to just let it sit for a few hours to see if it drinks any better.     They got the chocolate part in there for sure though.   I would not buy again."
""
"Drank this straight out of the bottle because it's just a Shiner. It's very light for a stout, but I was expecting that. The cocoa flavor is very prominent, with an initial unpleasant stale beer flavor right behind that cocoa flavour. What's kind of cool, though, is that the aftertaste is very much like chocolate cake and not unpleasant at all."
"Tastes and smells like chocolate milk I Really don't like it"
"Very tasty chocolate stout.  Tastes like chocolate cake without being sweet."

"It's a good stout, but nothing really special."

"I am not great at describing the taste of beer or what 'notes' a beer drinker can derive from a beer, but this stuff tastes like Duncan Hines chocolate cake. No 'notes' of a stout exist in this beer, that is, it does not taste like any stout I have ever had. It tastes and smells exactly like chocolate cake made from a store bought mix. Avoid it and do not buy as a ""birthday beer"" for your girlfriend as you will both be quite disappointed, unless you don't care for beer, but enjoy cake from a box mix. I could see somebody in those shoes liking it. I only gave a decent rating for the smell because I like the smell of chocolate cake, from a box mix or from scratch. Shiner, you failed once again. Shabbiest brewery in Texas, hands down."

"The beer smells and tastes like wort.  I still like me some Shiner Black and Cheer, but unless they were trying to hit some obscure version of a chocolate stout (which maybe they were) they ought to be ashamed of themselves for this one."
"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"I drank it from a bottle.  40 degrees.  Tasted exactly like a chocolate cake.  An almost too rich chocolate cake."

"Pours a very deep chocolate brown letting hardly any light through. Decent mocha head and tremendous lacing. Aroma is of hot chocolate and maybe a small hint of coffee. Taste is of hot chocolate. There is a subtle ending taste of coffee, also. This beer has nice carbonation and feels great going down. This is slightly on the weaker side as stouts go, but the hot chocolate flavor makes it. Happy Birthday!!"

"Poured into a pint glass. A: black, letting no light through when held to light bulb. one finger thick head that dissipates quickly with very little lacing. S: rich chocolate and mocha with a hint of bitter hops. Very subtle hints of dark fruit like raisin and date. T: immediately hit with strong dark chocolate, almost too rich, but then the bold chocolate is balanced out with coffee and mocha flavors. Aftertaste leaves mainly mochawithhints of bitter hops and dark fruits. M: smooth, very little carbonation, more dominant froth like you would get from a Guinness. O: great beer for the winter, or if you have a sweet tooth. Shiner did a great job making this limited edition 106 year anniversary beer."

"O: If there's such a thing as a ""Light Stout", this is it. Imagine a stout you could chug from the bottle and not feel sick afterward -- that's this beer. If you want to drink casually from a bottle but taste a little more complexity than usual, this is the beer for you."
"Drinkin this on tap at The Tavern Christmas Day!"
"O: interesting offering from Shiner. Certainly a break from their traditional line-up of lagers / german beers."
"Pours a pitch black (or super close) in color with a good 1-finger beige creamy head that finally settles down to a couple of millimeters after a while. A decent amount of lacing is seen after each sip that sticks to the glass. The aroma of chocolate hits your nose right up front, more than other similar stouts. Pretty much the same for the taste. More like a dark chocolate beer than a stout. Very smooth and goes down very easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Medium-bodied and perfect carbonation. Have to say that this is one of the best Shiner brews I have had so far. Great job Shiner!"

"Pours with a small, brown head. Initial smell is more of a coffee-type aroma. Tastes  how it smells, except with a hint of chocolate. Can hardly detect the alcohol in it, but it is still present nevertheless. Goes down smooth. I would recommend this beer with a doughnut or strudel. Sounds strange, but the sweetness of this beer would pull it off."

"Tried this today and found that I rather liked it.  Poured dark with a nice head that lingered.  You are hit up front with the chocolate, but not like the sweet Southern Tier Chocolat.  This wasn't per say as much of a stout as a dark chocolate beer.  But to be honest I found it very drinkable and would be a good beer to finish the nite with without the heaviness of most chocolate stouts.  Kind of sad this is a one and done, this would be a very easy beer to pair with desserts"
