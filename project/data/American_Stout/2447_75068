3.68,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light char, light nuttiness, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of coffee and dark/roasted malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light caramel, light nuttiness, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roast/coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, toast, dark bread, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and robustness of coffee and dark/roasted malt flavors; with decent complexity and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice coffee stout. Good balance and robustness of coffee and dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. Pretty one dimensional, but nicely enjoyable.","superspak","0"

There was no sound of carbonation when I pried the cap, either. This beer pours smooth and slick. Aromas of rich toffee, bitter coffee notes, some molasses highlights, subtle roast character, and a creamy sweetness. The nose leans a bit more to the sweet side than I was expecting, but smells good regardless. Flavors are slightly roasted forward, with a subtle coffee bitterness in the backbone. Some sweet highlights throughout, but mostly the coffee notes shine through on the palate. Very dry and smooth bodied, with no frills to distract. The aftertaste is a building roasted coffee bitterness as you go. The finish is slick and dry at the same time. Like I said, no frills, but this is a solid, drinkable brew.","GarthDanielson","Mar 08, 2014"

Coffee, faint hints of chocolate, some nice earthy undertones too. Taste is very coffee forward, kinda reminds me of those chocolate espresso beans some people like to eat for a dessert. I found the coffee flavor on this stout really nice, its the first thing that really hits the palate and its bitterness, followed by some malts and chocolate to balance it out, makes for a very pleasent drinking experience. Not a particularly thick stout, with a pretty thin mouthfeel(very much like a cup of coffee) but even a russian imperial stout enthusiast can find a enjoyable beer in this one.","theteleman","Feb 14, 2014"

2.97,-18.6,4,3.25,2.75,2.5,3,"Pours a solid three fingers of very dark brown foam, while frothy with many larger bubbles the retention is credible and long lasting, the lacing comes in fairly thick streaks but this tends to slide away swiftly. At first glance the liquid seems black but it is likely the darkest shade of brown possible, completely opaque, no visible bubbles, no hint of other coloration at the rims. The nose is quite roasty with a heavy emphasis on the coffee, quite milky too, black fruits and raisins, oatmeal and other sweeter baking grains, splash of mineral water, overall it‚Äôs not that sugary but likewise it does not have a noticeable hoppy charge to it either. Full-bodied, dense and reluctant to move freely, it has a strong drying effect on the mouth, to the point where it impairs the flavors. Coffee, powdered dark chocolate and a hint of molasses yet no core of sweetness, the plum, cherry fruit diminished and no citric nor floral element. The minor doughy breadiness helps. Carbonation is low but not absent. Some chicory notes at the end. Smooth but the dustiness adds to its lack of flow and slightly dilute ending. Not horrible but nothing I would purchase a second time.","farrago","Feb 16, 2013"

The taste is robustly roasty at first, and that is only doubled by the coffee flavors that present themselves. There's nothing sweet in this stout at all, it's all roast, all the time. Some hops help contribute to the overall bitterness of the beer. It's lacking a little in complexity, but it's tasty.

You can expect lots of coffee in the aroma. There's mocha and chocolate covered coffee beans and a nice roasty aspect too. There's a theme going on here, and it's coffee, which continues into the taste. The flavor is coffee all the way with a light stout aspect that attempts to catch one's attention. A little mocha makes its case, but this is all coffee. The beer is medium bodied with a very bubbly body, a bit overcarbonated for what I like in a stout.
