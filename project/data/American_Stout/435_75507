Good enough value for me to not regret buying a bomber (Trader Joe's, $2.29), despite it being a watery/carbonated stout rather than a creamy/dense one like I usually prefer.

Some fruit and roasted character appears as well, both in the aroma and the flavor. The grassy and leafy hops, as might be expected for the style, are relegated to a background role. Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation level that leaves it with a delicate caress before smoothly passing. Balanced. Pleasant but still somehow lacking.","NeroFiddled","Dec 14, 2014"

So dark when I held it up to the afternoon sun you STILL can't see through it. However, this one proves the saying 'you get what you pay for'. Yes, it is definitely a stout. It just lacks depth and has a certain watery body to it. Couldn't taste any chocolate, personally. A bit of creaminess with a slightly hoppy aftertaste.

Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but the dominant flavor is roasted/grainy malt, with some cocoa powder/bittersweet chocolate noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. Not a bad overall beer. Can't complain much when it's $1.99 a bomber (from Trader Joe's of course).

The aromas are very one dimensional. Reminds me of a biscuit with honey on top getting toasted, with aromas of coffee and cocoa, but a fake, extract-like chocolate. Also, I'm getting a LOT of metallic aromas here, rather off putting. Actually, it is quite off putting. A big bit of booziness despite the lower abv. There is a strange sourness that just doesn't belong here. The flavor starts sweet with malt and chocolate but the sourness creeps up again along with the metallic flavor and kind of ruins it for me. The body is thin and very carbonated. Overall, this beer is plain disappointing.

The taste holds notes of sharply bitter roasted malts, dry and bitter coffee, and a touch of dark chocolate powder. Everything seems burnt, overly-roasted, and too bitter for its own good.

3.65,10.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A no-frills, uncomplicated, yet very pleasant chocolate stout that is what it says. Deep, dark brown in color, creamy tan head, with a rich, malty scent. The flavor is not complex or original, but the roasty malts and strong chocolates are great, balanced by just enough hops, give a rich but smooth and dry finish. The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy, but very drinkable and not heavy. Overall tasty, very easy to drink, and well worth $2 for 22oz.","fezmeister","Jan 10, 2012"

3.38,2.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Too bad we can't rate economics, as this 2 dollar beer has a great value, if not the best of flavors. On flavor as it is, it's better than the DIPA for the 2 bucks, but not on the ABV. Also, it seems that this beer is meant to be enjoyed cold, as all the flavors and smells aren't as good warm.","Drinkerofales","Dec 30, 2011"
3.41,3.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O- This might be one of the fastest drinks of chocolate stout I've ever had, as it's as thin as a pale ale and hardly a challenge. Best as a sample for someone who doesn't like dark beers too much, or to satisfy a sweet tooth.","ManuelHerrera","Dec 26, 2011"

3.3,0.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Foamy thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, chocolate syrup, and some dark cocoa powder. Taste is of dark roasted malt, unsweetened cocoa beans, and some slight coffee bean flavors. There is a slightly sour and roasty bitter flavor to this beer as well. This beer has a crisp carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good stout especially for the price but not worth buying again in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 15, 2011"

3.58,8.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Aroma offers dominant notes of carob and cocoa with some faint spice as well. Some earthy hop notes pop out a bit with some warming. Taste follow and adds a bit of dark cherry and chocolate. Nice and smooth in the delivery though a touch thin in feel at first, firming up with some cocoa and spice on the finish. But then at 5.4% I guess it does just fine. And a solid value for sure though not particularly 'chocolately' foor a self proclaimed chocolate stout.","HalfFull","Dec 07, 2011"
