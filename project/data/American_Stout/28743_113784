Earthy, roasty coffee in the aroma, dark malts and more roast. Good melding of dark malts and coffee in the taste, which I like, as opposed to some coffee beers, which end up tasting like a full-blown glass of cold coffee. Notes of caramel, ash, and maybe some subtle dark fruit. Rich, tasty, smooth, medium to medium-full body. I can be picky with coffee beers, but this is probably one of the better ones I've had.","Rifugium","Apr 05, 2014"

Doesn't have a ton going for it other than the coffee, which is great, but more complexity, or at least the nice malts I know are there that can't get through due to the coffee just overpowering them, would be nice.","jlindros","Mar 23, 2014"
