"Coffee smell and taste cold. As it warms up the chocolate comes through and taste sweeter."

"Had on tap at a winter beer fest. Awesomely ""clean"" and ""fresh"" taste for a stout. Goes along well with their other offerings like Blazing World. Love Modern Times!"

"O: this is a solid beer I think i would gave been more impressed if it was called a porter instead of stout. Stout conjures thoughts of deep abyss blackness and insane viscosity. This beer has a nice taste but it's not world class at best this is worth trying and then passing on."
""
""
""
""
"Minimal carb despite vigorous pour.  Smell is muted with some black coffee.  Mouthfeel is very thin.  Seems like a black ale.  Taste is old bitter coffee that tastes stale.  There is no canned date.  Not sure if the beer is old, but that's on the brewer to date if this beer does go bad or fade.  The thinness of the body really makes it hard to call this a stout."

"Pretty good stout. Had it on draft and I think I could taste some of the grounds. But really good overall coffee flavor."
"Pours nearly black and thinner than color would suggest with a bit of beige head.  Big toasty, malty, rye and coffee nose.  Taste reminds me of pumpernickel bread and coffee.  Very clean finish and solid stout."
""
"The can says chocolate-covered espresso bean, and that is a good description.  A nice surprise in a can.  Worth a try."

"Would love to try the variants of this beer."

"My favorite stout. Incredible, creamy mouth feel, but not viscous. Fresh roasted coffee nose hits you right away. Flavor has mocha, smooth coffee (not bitter). I can drink this stout all day, even on a warm day."

"Poured from a 20oz big boy can chilled to below 40.  Pours a deep dark chocolate brown if not black.  1/2 finger of head.  Dissipated quickly.  Aromas of espresso thinking Ethiopian and Sumatra.  Roasted malts.  Light in the mouth with strong above coffee and roasted malts.  Not boozy.  Must be light abv.  Definitely better than Guinness but not far from it.  Solid.  like it.  Stout you can drink all day on a warm day even."

"O:  Perfection in a can!  This beer is EXACTLY what the label says it is.  I would drink this all the time if I could."

"Verdict: A nice American Stout from Modern Times, really well done while not being yet another 10%+ coffee stout. This is highly drinkable and easy to enjoy on a chilly evening, nothing too pretentious or overly complicated, just simple coffee and stout goodness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a huge fan of low gravity, non-barrel aged stouts, but this bad boy is packed with complexity and all-around solid flavor. Coffee is perfectly placed and the roasty-ness of the malt shines through. Great beer from Modern Times."
""
""
"Overall a good beer for sure, but a bit one dimensional, and didn't get much coffee for it. Worth checking out and solid for sure, would buy it occasionally if I were a local. Easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Roasty, chocolately and coffe, whats not to like"
""
""

"Huge coffee flavors and still low in ABV, I like what they did here. I could throw back a number of these no problem."

"Overall pretty nice, a big creamy rich stout with nice cocoa, milk chocolate, roast, coffee, and hint of bitter hops. Very nice, rich and big while still drinkable and quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another great beer by Modern Times. I love that they house roast their own coffee. This beer is perfectly balanced, not too bitter, not too sweet. I really enjoy it. It is a great stout at a great price."

"The Verdict: Darn good beer. They describe it as chocolate covered espresso beans, and that just about covers it."
""
""
"t/m/o - taste really matches the nose.  A medley of gourmet coffee.  The can says 75% Ethiopian and 25% Sumatra???man would I love to try the coffee of the blend of these beans.  Nice soft vanilla notes round out the chocolate.  The feel is way more porter than stout. Fizzy charcoal, and although the low point of the brew, still an easy drinker. Very impressive beer. Mi would like the beer tube beefed up (and stuck in bourbon barrels), but this one is heaven for a coffee lover."
"While I greatly prefer bigger, bolder, RIS...this is a very good beer."
""
""
""
"The beer pours jet black, with a half-finger-width head.  The aroma is pleasant with robust coffee and a touch of roasted barely. The taste has loads of coffee, but it’s not overbearing.  There is some roasted barely on the back end. Interestingly, this is first time I’ve had a beer in which the mouth feel was a major-contributor to the overall rating.  It had a nice, medium milky mouth feel that complemented the flavors perfectly.  The beer is not incredibly complex, but delicious all the same. It’s just a fantastic beer."

"o: its pretty enjoyable.  as i've found with a few of the coffee beers i've had lately, i wish the coffee would be just a bit more pronounced on the front of the tongue.  its really smooth, and has a real nice toasted chocolate flavor that is definitely enjoyable on its own.  for sure worth a pick up"
""
""
"Poured from a pint can into my Stone snifter. Pours jet black with a delayed light tan head that begins to form from the middle of the glass. Smells of coffee and cigar tobacco. Taste is very similar to the aroma. Smooth and slightly oily mouthfeel. Pint can was the perfect amount for a good relaxing buzz. I drank this beer over two highly regarded imperial stouts because I didn't want an entire bomber at the time. Delicious late night or cold weather brew. Will be buying some more."

"The palate opens with a blend of milk chocolate, medium roast coffee that's pretty fruity (dried cherries), a little bit of cream and some sugar. Mildly roasty on the mid-palate, the chocolate does dominate. Creamy and smooth on the palate, this beer is softly carbonated and has a beautiful coffee flavor on the finish. Excellent stuff."

"Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Pours dark brown/black with a thick tan head. A lot of coffee in the nose. Some chocolate and maybe just a hint of dark fruits. Taste follows pretty closely. A good amount of coffee bitterness. I don't drink many ""single"" stouts, mostly imperials, so obviously the lighter mouthfeel was a bit different for me, although expected from a <6% beer. Overall, a great, drinkable stout. I love how much the coffee stands out in this one. It's so smooth too, it feels like I'm drinking a milk stout."
""
""
"O - Overall, a nice big coffee stout, however that's about it. Not much else going on here."
""
"Overall - This is an okay stout. Needs more richness and other flavors."

"Overall - Dominated by coffee, but it's very drinkable."
"Overall: This isn't a bad beer, just not too much for me to love it. The way this brew feels should be heavy and coat the palate with its goodness. There could be some more residual sweetness from the malts as well. Just my two cents worth. Yet for being a Stout this doesn't scream greatness. This brew is worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
"This stout is very standard. The appearance, smell, taste, and mouthfeel are all mediocre. Maybe my taste buds are spoiled...or maybe they aren't and I can discern a quality stout over something simple. This stout is pretty cut and dry, simple. Nothing stands out, or makes me want to drink this beer again. The best thing about this beer is that it is in a can and can be toted around fairly easy. I have nothing bad to say about this brew, but I also have nothing good to say either. I would try this again."
""
""
"Overall, I pay to have access to some type of stout like this locally. The version of East End's coffee beer they recently brewed was amazing on cask at Piper's Pub it's called Joe Melt instead of their winter seasonal Snow Melt. All comparisons aside this stands out as a great coffee beer that this newer brewery should stand behind and let it cruise into position as their flagship offering that will put them on the map for the rest of the country. I bet those 16 ounce cans will ship great across the country once Modern Times grows enough to expand!"
""

"Overall: Solid all-around stout that puts coffee on full display. I have never had a more intensely coffee flavored beer."
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall - I enjoyed this beer more than I expected I would. It's a tasty stout that delivers on its promise of rich, coffee flavor. It is lighter than other stouts that I prefer, but I would hardly say that detracts from its appeal. Not the most exotic beer, but I can imagine I would not get sick of drinking this very quickly. Would recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I enjoyed this stout very much. It tasted exactly like it smelled which was a little too overwhelmingly coffee, but not unpleasantly so. I would prefer a little chocolate notes to it as well, but overall very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"I tend to prefer my coffee stouts thicker, heartier and slightly sweeter but this is a quite flavorful and easy drinking brew. Solid, enjoyable work but other than being packaged in a tallboy can (which is indeed awesome) it doesn't quite pull ahead of the rather crowded pack of coffee oatmeal stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This stout really delivers on the roasty and coffee aromas. I would have liked more chocolate maltyness and a heavier feel but this is good for a coffee fix."
""
""
""
""
"Overall wonderfully balanced and I love it's simplicity more than anything. THis would be a great go to stout to have all the time, sort of reminds me of Cadillac Mountain a bit minus the coffee angle."
""
"16oz can poured into pint glass. Pours a cola brown with fizzy head that disappears rapidly. The nose is heavy roasted coffee with a touch of oatmeal and biscuit, not a whole lot else. The taste is similar. Pretty one dimensional, heavy coffee roast, a bit of cream and not much else. Wish there was more of a malt backbone here. The oatmeal is definitely present and brings a cream like component to the beer. The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. This is an easy drinking coffee stout. This would be a good ""summer stout"" as it features some nice roasty flavors but drinks very light and is refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This is a brew served two ways. Could easily pass as an iced mocha in the can. Even though the coffee steals the show what you get is an incredible fusion of all the flavors and the mouth feel is a true delight. Probably my favorite from Modern Times next to the Fortunate Islands."

"I really liked this beer. Would love to have it again."

"I seem to detect an English influence throughout, though the lack of yeast character and the purity of the coffee bring the beer back to this side of the pond. While not perfectly ""to style"" it is a tasty brew. Bonus points for their copywriting, packaging, and label design."
""
""
"Well-made but ultimately somewhat unsuccessful take on a coffee stout. A bigger, stouter stout would have supported the coffee flavor better, I think. Or maybe less coffee? The relatively modest nature of this beer (note the ABV) means the coffee runs roughshod over the other flavors. Maybe coffee oatmeal stouts shouldn't be ""sessionable""?"

"A solid coffee stout. A heavier bodied mouthfeel would propel this effort to greatness."
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer, however I prefer a bit more chewier and developed stout. If you are looking for a straightforward coffee offering of this style, this is for you."

"Light black in color,yet still penetrable to light. A minuscule bit of khaki colored head covers the top. Brussels lacing. Aroma of dark roasted coffee greets my nose. The mouth is silky,smooth,and dry. The taste is bitterly dark roasted coffee and roasted barley. The finish is pretty smooth and sweet along the lines of plums."
"O- A very sessionable stout."
""
""
""
"Aroma is subtle but has a good amount of coffee, light bitter chocolate and dark malts. Flavor is very similar with a balanced coffee component playing off the dark malts. Carbonation is right on, mouthfeel is full but not thick and syrupy. Overall a great stout that I will have whenever I get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really good beer, Modern times is making some excellent beers. Very well balanced between the chocolate and coffee flavors not over done smooth and easy to drink. This is a great drinkable stout that wont knock you out after having one."

"O: The more it warms up the better the coffee comes through. A good, straightforward coffee stout."

"16oz Tall Boy pours a black color with dark brown hues and a 1/2 inch of head. Some lacing. The aroma is chocolate, earth, roasted malts, coffee, and a bit of marshmallow. The taste is coffee and dark chocolate followed by some smokey malts. Peat and earth. Finishes with some more coffee and bitter dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is a bit on the lighter side, but its a Coffee Stout so it fits the style. Very drinkable with very little alcohol presence. Roasty with lots of coffee and dark chocolate. Overall, pretty solid beer I'd grab again."

"Got in a trade with BeerBaron666. 16 ounce can into pint glass; no canning date, but should be fairly fresh. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge milk chocolate, fresh coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, oats, and roasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of coffee and dark/roast malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, fresh coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, oats, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, oats, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roast malt and coffee flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding coffee stout. All around awesome balance and robustness of fresh coffee and dark/roast malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark, opaque brown with at thin tan head that maintains a thin film and ring around the glass with light lacing. Mild sweet toasted malt aroma with fresh coffee and light chocolate. Flavor is a very nicely integrated sweet toasted and caramel malt, coffee, finishing with sweet coffee and a hint of grassy hop bitterness. Nice medium body with some light creaminess. A nicely made and balanced coffee stout, with no real wow components, but nicely put together and quite flavorful for a non-imperial stout. I liked this quite a bit with my lunch. I hope to taste more from this brewery when I visit southern California."

"Smooth, full bodied and viscus."
"I'm very glad that I bought a 4-pack, because the Black House kicks ass. It's very flavorful without forcing you to take small sips. The type of beer that you would show off to your friends."
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oat, cocoa, and slight coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and coffee bean flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a slightly better cocoa and coffee presence in the smell in my opinion."

"Edit: I have had the nitro version on tap on a recent visit to San Diego and I have to say that it really, really does well with nitro. I would highly recommend trying this on nitro."

"O- A nice coffee stout, I'm a fan of sumatra coffee and could distinguish it in the beer. Highly drinkable for a coffee stout. Good intro to Modern Times for me."
""
""
""
""

"A very simple and good coffee stout, doesn't cut any corners with the flavor or the aroma. Mouthfeel could be hefted up to add body and sweetness to the back end of the drink."

"As a whole, I'm feeling it, but like your little sister who is trying to be the next Jennifer Lawrence, there is still more work to be done."

"low abv = more flavorful taste. true. even for a stout... still getting used to a CANNED STOUT... oh well, here it is....nice frothy foam in the glass. nice pour, indeed. nice head. super dark brown. distinct 'can' taste, if there is one, but it seems so... nice aroma, great taste. chocolates and coffees, typical of the stouts and very nice smooth taste. wonder if the can plays a role in the taste? kind of hard to envision drinking something so thick and yet so low in abv, but hey, it's got a great flavor."

"Pours a solid dark brown with the faintest of ruby highlights at the edges when held to light. The aroma is fresh ground coffee beans in spades with a roasty malty edge. Light cream and earthy hop round out the aroma. Roasty earthy coffee grounds with a huge bitter edge and a touch of cream make up the flavor. Pretty straight forward, possibly a bit one sided. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a bitter roasty ashy mouthfeel. I enjoyed the first few sips of this, but as my glass warmed it got harder and harder to finish the pint. The coffee and bitter roast is over the top on this especially at warmer temps. There needs to be more malty sweetness to back up the coffee bite here imho."
""
""
""

"Nice dark roast coffee ground feel and some good black malts to support it. Rich aroma is especially nice."

"Overall: I'm excited to get some cans in the fridge (next two weeks they tell me, maybe?). In my opinion, this immediately jumps toward the top of local, sub-6% stouts. Love the ability to kick back a few of these instead of the crazy 10+ ABV gutbombs going around. Sometimes, less is more."

"Coffee flavor is quite pronounced, but it's a nice mellow roast. A tangy taste with a flicker of hops, but mostly it's the dark roasted malt. Some charred grain adds a little bitterness. This has a better coffee flavor than a lot of the muddy flavored stouts, but maybe it needs some cream."
