"Maybe with age this would be good but very thin and heavy carbonation almost like a chocolate soda"
"Overall: Ehh it's okay...has much room for improvement. Not bad but not great either. Nice dinner beer as opposed to the dessert that i would normally crave. Salud!"
""
"Good beer in my book..nice appearance with a khaki head and lots of lacing..smells chocolatey and and a little roasty..taste is the same with a thin to medium mouthfeel..B to B-Depending on the mood I'm in"
""
"Nice head on the beer.   Taste more roast than chocolate.   Much better beer than expected from the ratings."
""
"Picked this up at Trader Joes for 2.49 in a 650ml bottle. Pours a very dark black with a nice creamy head. Faint smell of chocolate and roasted coffee. Tastes pretty good, picking up notes of chocolate and coffee. Thin mouthfeel. Not the best chocolate stout, but for 2.49 i'm not disappointed,"
""
"I paid $2.50 for a bomber of this at Trader Joe's.  I figured it was a great deal. Now I realize I overpaid."
""
"Long story short: Inoffensive and cheap stout-like beverage."
""
"Not bad at all for the pricepoint.  2.29 a bomber.  Mine was brewed by Rhinelander.  The coffee was very prominent with a very smooth roasty bitterness behind it.  I actually enjoyed this."
"Deep chocolate brown with decent head and ok lacing. Smell is of a bit of chocolate. Taste has a touch of chocolate but the malt presence is way too high and renders this beer to the bottom of its style...."
""
"Not bad. Would happily drink anytime. Good enough value for me to not regret buying a bomber (Trader Joe's, $2.29), despite it being a watery/carbonated stout rather than a creamy/dense one like I usually prefer. There seems to be some debate here about how chocolatey it is. I found it to be delightfully less chocolatey than the overt claims on the label might imply."
"Overall this was a decent representation of the style but nothing outstanding. There was something that tasted off but i couldn't pinpoint that thing. Glad I tried it but its far from the best in a crowded market."
"Looks good..But taste and aroma are quite lacking. And without a payoff kick, it's not so stout."
"Notes: Distinctly chocolatey with a decisive bittersweet dark chocolate character. Some fruit and roasted character appears as well, both in the aroma and the flavor. The grassy and leafy hops, as might be expected for the style, are relegated to a background role. Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation level that leaves it with a delicate caress before smoothly passing. Balanced. Pleasant but still somehow lacking."
""
"wow! very nice. very chocolate-y. very under-rated, I think... i'm not afraid to call it what it is- a Trader Joe's Special! okay..... but it's pretty darned good. low abv, but that transfers to taste (hopefully). I do not understand the ""75"" rating.... maybe because it IS Trader Joe's stuff... but this is pretty good, in my opinion, on a neutral evening, and with un-biased taste buds..."

"I tasted quite a bit more chocolate than many of the reviewers here, but generally concur that it falls short of what a chocolate stout can be.  For the price, not bad at all, but quite a few other comparably-priced Trader Joe's offerings surpass it."

"Not enough chocolate, not enough black patent malt.  But not bad by any stretch."

"Bought from Trader Joe's in Raleigh, NC. supposed to be chocolate stout but minimal chocolate flavor. Not very good. Won;t be trying again."
"Overall:  it is unfortunate, but this doesn't seem like a super high quality beer.  It's not horrible or anything, but a chocolate stout can be so much more than this."
""
""
""
"Overall a good brew for the cost. A good session beer."
""

"Taste/mouthful- nice and smooth great body lives up to the stout style, almost creamy in texture, bitter sweet chocolate malt, hopped perfectly, just a hint of tanginess from the hops but sits back to let the chocolate take the fore front of the flavor.  For 2.99 I was a sceptic, you could charge way more. Must try, would par Nicely with any desert."
"Poured from a pint bottle into a pint glass. Pours a medium to dark brown with three fingers of a foamy khaki head. Smells of malt, hints of metal, and a corny lager smell overall not too appealing on the nose. It tastes of malt, hints of roast or smokiness, with a strong chocolate finishing taste, medium carbonation. Medium bodied with a crispy carbonation feel. Overall it's nothing exceptional and the best thing it has going for it is it's appearance"
""
"Poured into my frozen beer mug. The one thing this brew has going for it is the appearance - rich creamy brown foam with small to medium lacing. So dark when I held it up to the afternoon sun you STILL can't see through it. However, this one proves the saying 'you get what you pay for'. Yes, it is definitely a stout. It just lacks depth and has a certain watery body to it. Couldn't taste any chocolate, personally. A bit of creaminess with a slightly hoppy aftertaste. It's drinkable, but I won't be looking out for this one next time I'm in the store."
""
"Overall: Nothing special. Much cheaper than a chocolate stout from Rogue, but not nearly as enjoyable."
""

"O - Gave it a chance, but it wasn't happening. The chocolate fades fast, and you are left with smoke/ash."

"O- Looks good, smells decent from the bottle, not a fan of the flavor as it gets bunched up into nothing, was really hard for me to pick out the flavors that I smelled. Glad I did not pay much for this one, wont be getting it again."
"O - Nothing that stands out. Light flavor and light feel."

"O: decent cheap brew from Trader Joe's"

"Overall a decent chocolate stout, definitely not horrible, with some great characteristics, though not a comprehensive package. Certainly unique and appreciable for it's good appearance and vibrant chocolate taste, but still quite a distance from perfection."

"I am picking up some chocolate malts and a slightly bitter hop bitterness at the end. But the beer really feels like someone sprinkled some Nestle cocoa mix into the beer. That cocoa powder they boast about on the label tends to become its downfall."

"Purchased from Trader Joes in Carmel Mountain, CA. Pours a dark black with a whiteish coffee colored head that faded quickly. Smell is of chocolate, malts, and kind of an earthy dry malty backbone to round out the nose. First sip, very malty, choclatey, smooth mouthfeel, pretty thin for a stout, but overall pleasant. Some coffee coming through a bit more as it warms up to room temp, balances out nicely with the malts and chocolate. Overall a pretty decent stout, I like that its not too heavy but still has some nice flavors coming through."
"O: Definitely recommended if you like a good chocolate stout. Well worth a try."
""
""
"Pours a solid black with a smallish tan head.Aromas heavy on the roast and coffee and light on the chocolate as advertised. Bits of caramel and dark fruit round out the nose. The flavor is a slightly sweet roasty coffee malt beverage. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet roasty mouthfeel. Decent beer, but a bit one dimensional and not nearly enough chocolate of malty sweetness to make me think of chocolate."
"O: This is a good beer, but great value for the price. $1.99 at Trader Joe's in Columbus, Ohio. Totally worth it!"
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown to black color with a very thick foamy 3 finger tan head that faded very slowly and left very good foamy lacing and a layer on top. Smells of cocoa powder, grains, oatmeal, caramel, vanilla and peat moss; very nice chocolate nose that smells rich. The flavor is a drop off from the nose as it's a muted version with cocoa powder, grains, oatmeal, caramel, vanilla, herbs, floral hops and peat moss; still pretty good, but very thin for a stout. Mouthfeel is very light and watery with basically no carbonation and a slightly bitter and dry cocoa powder finish. Overall it was decent, above average, but lacked any real flavor excitement."

"Boatswain Chocolate stout pours a black color with a nice large tan head. There is a strong hoppy aroma with good hints of chocolate, but with a metallic note. The taste has a nice strong chocolate flavor, weak beer flavors. A bit watery, but not overly sweet. Overall it has a nice good chocolate flavors."
""
""
"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing opaque black in the glass. Thin brown head and thick ring around the glass with light lacing. Aroma of sweet toasted malt and light chocolate, pretty nice. Flavor is toasted malt with slight char, coffee and light chocolate with a bitter, somewhat astringent finish. Light to medium bodied. Delivers well what it promises; a cheap, decently made chocolate stout. All the flavor notes are there, but a bit thin on body and sharp and undifferentiated bitterness in the finish. A decent inexpensive light stout."
""
""
"O: Smell and taste are a mixture of coffee (more than chocolate) stout and imperial stout, although the mouth-feel is more like a medium porter. Good on its own account, and excellent for the price point."

"O: Overall it's alright, bit lacking in most aspects but still it wasn't bad. Could drink quite a few of these but I would keep my socks on. I'd recommend though, well, well worth the price, I only paid $2 for it from trader joes, same amount for a stinky coke from a vending machine."

"Overall- This is not a mind blowing stout but it is a good one especially for the price ($2.50 a bottle)."
""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"O: Overall a decent chocolate stout, but not quite what you would expect in the bomber packaging and for the price, even at Trader Joe's. Brewed with ""cocoa powder," and the taste beckons a less than stellar ingredient quality. Nevertheless, nothing is below average about this brew."
""
""
""

"O- Don't expect a lot from this beer but I got a bottle for $2.50 which is unbeatable."

"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours very dark brown with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like roasted/grainy malt, bittersweet and milk chocolate, along with a bit of coffee. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but the dominant flavor is roasted/grainy malt, with some cocoa powder/bittersweet chocolate noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. Not a bad overall beer. Can't complain much when it's $1.99 a bomber (from Trader Joe's of course). Worth a try at that price."

"Boatswain Chocolate Stout is a black ale with a slightly reddish cast. The smooth, dense, brown head has decent retention. It has a roasted aroma with notes of coffee, dark chocolate and toffee. It feels smooth and full bodied with a clean, dry finish. A little grit is left on the teeth. There's a hint of sweetness, but it's dry overall. The chocolate flavor is very dark and pretty subtle. There's a bit of caramel going on mid-taste. The chocolate is probably most prominent in the dusty aftertaste. The bitterness is very subdued and is just enough to balance things out. This is a very solid, drinkable and enjoyable stout.Boatswain Chocolate Stout is a black ale with a slightly reddish cast. The smooth, dense, brown head has decent retention.

"Taste is definitely overwhelmingly chocolate. I get a silky milk chocolate character more as this brew warms up. Not a complex nor multi-dimensional ale, but decent enough."

"-Overall 3.75: It may be cheap, but it is really good beer. I have had several expensive stouts that are nowhere near as good as this brew. Unfortunately, I think that many people see the price and immediately let their preconceived prejudices do the tasting. Pay the jerks no mind and gleefully pick up this beer and enjoy it with the full knowledge that you are offending the sensibilities of legions of Buddy Holly glasses-wearing Arcade Fire fans. I like this brew and I bet the weirdo stock guy would, too. I think he would give it four out of five ""ughs."""
"A bit too smoky, but it was actually better than I thought it would be. And for $1.99 what more can I ask for?"

"Poured this American Chocolate Stout from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a dark black color produced an average tan head, below average retention and it left some lacing on the glass. The aroma of this ale consists of roasted grain, chocolate and coffee. Medium bodied, a foundation of roasted grain, chocolate and coffee. Overall, decent beer- to thin for my liking- Better Chocolate Stout's out there."

"Flavor is chocolate stout right up the middle. Not too sweet, but a distinct chocolate note comes through the body of the stout, though it doesn't dominate. The label claims 66 IBUs, but given how neutral this beer is I suspect there's a lot more sugar in here than I'm tasting. It's really quite balanced. The mouthfeel is a little bit lighter than I'd want in a chocolate stout. And while there's nothing really standing about this beer, the value is fantastic."
"Poured very dark, nearly black, with deep garnet hues in the light. Tan bubbly head that remained as a thin cap. Looks decent so far. The aromas are very one dimensional. Reminds me of a biscuit with honey on top getting toasted, with aromas of coffee and cocoa, but a fake, extract-like chocolate. Also, I'm getting a LOT of metallic aromas here, rather off putting. Actually, it is quite off putting. A big bit of booziness despite the lower abv. There is a strange sourness that just doesn't belong here. The flavor starts sweet with malt and chocolate but the sourness creeps up again along with the metallic flavor and kind of ruins it for me. The body is thin and very carbonated. Overall, this beer is plain disappointing. I added a bit of bourbon to see if it makes it any more drinkable but unfortunately, I wasted a couple teaspoons of bourbon. Ended up drain pouring it."

"Pours a very dark brown, clear but looks black in the glass excepting the brown edges. The dark tan head has decent retention and the glass is nicely coated with lacing after each tip. Plenty of dark and medium chocolate in both the aroma and the flavor [near 4]. Excellent sweet/bitter balance, if a tad more hoppy and bitter than usual for a chocolate stout. A hint of licorice lingers into the slightly smoky aftertaste. Creamy smooth medium-full body with excellent carbonation."
""
""
"O: Definitely not bad for a three dollar bomber, but I don't think I'll be buying another."
"Remarkably unremarkable beer. Poured out of a 22oz bomber into an Imperial Pint glass. Dark black with mocha colored head. Not much head and no lacing to speak of. First taste is non complex but decent. Mediocre flavor. A tad bit bitter for the style but not overly. Overall it is kind of boring but is perfect if I feel like an American non-imperial stout and don't feel like spending much money. 1.99 at Trader Joes."
"Overall, on the sweet and syrupy side, but decent roast character...and chocolate...lots of chocolate. Definitely a dessert beer."
""
"An alright stout, the aroma seems to be better than the taste, but still very drinkable."
""
""
""

"O: An average American Stout without much character."
"O: Not a big fan of the style but surprisingly good and more complex than a $1.99 beer deserves to be."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark brown coloring, thin in appearance, with a ring of light tan film around the surface. Aromas of bittersweet cocoa powder on a rich, roasted backbone. The nose is a bit one-dimensional. Flavors are thin and smooth, with a touch of roast and smoke on the bittersweet chocolate backbone. Slick and light in mouth, the beer has a roasted coffee and mocha aftertaste. Rich, bitter finish...not bad, but lackluster."
"Yup, a random Trader Joe's-bred bomber. The price was right, honey. This stuff pours a very deep black-brown topped by a finger of light brown foam. The nose comprises chocolate powder, light roasted malts (bordering on the acrid-ish), and a hint of coffee. The taste holds notes of sharply bitter roasted malts, dry and bitter coffee, and a touch of dark chocolate powder. Everything seems burnt, overly-roasted, and too bitter for its own good. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, an average stout at best, one that really doesn't express all that much chocolate character, and one that goes too bitter and roasted for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 1.5"" mocha head with average life. The body is deep dark as coffee. Smell is milder than I expected and with roasted malt but not really any chocolate. Then the taste was the opposite with a good amount of dark chocolate but not really any coffee or roasted malt coming forward. Medium body and medium finish. I still fully enjoyed it, and it was ultracheap at Trader Joe's."
""
"Comments: an average stout, slightly too toasty and dry for me, can taste the chocolate and sugar, but it is too subtle and overwhelmed by the roast"
""
""
"Overall: The best of the three Boatswain beers I had. Not outstanding, but a solid all-around stout and well worth a drink, especially for $1.99. This would be a great go-to beer when on a budget."
""
""
""
""
"This is the best of the Boatswain Four, hands down. It isn't spectacular, but I find it tastes fairly good and it's easy to drink. Great price, too."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nevertheless, a good beer-decent and worth drinking with dinner or when you are not on the mood for a special tasting beer."
"O- Not too bad at all. Totally worth the 2 buck for this bomber."
""
""
"While the Chocoalte Stout certainly lives up to its namesake, it does little to celebrate what's best about its malt, hop, or chocolate makeup. It's content to live in so-so land of beers."
""
"O: Not bad at all! If this were a $7 bomber, I'd kvetch and whine about this being a failure of a chocolate stout, but considering it was $2, I'd say this is a shockingly decent dark beer."
""
""
""
""
"O A nice beer but I would to see some more thick taste of chocolate along with the coffee, malts, and hops."
""
""
"O - A drinkable stout, with this light feel and subtle flavors."
"22 oz bomber for 2 bucks at Trader Joe's in Indy. Poured a very nice deep dark chocolate brown, with some very nice head and decent initial lacing. Decent roasty aroma with a nice chocolate hit and earthy hoppiness underneath. Nice chocolate flavors, seemingly from powdered cocoa, with some light roastiness underneath and a bit of stout astringency. Goes down well, but the flavors don't merge as well as they could."
""
""
""
"Not bad for two bucks, but then again, it's not something I'd go out of my way to obtain again."
""
""
"i'm overall pretty disappointed in this beer. granted it was $2.29, but it's nothing close to a decent stout."
"Bought this today at trader joe's. 1.99 for a bomber. Pours black, but looks over carbonated. Smells, um...a bit dirty actually. Slight malt, maybe the faintest bit of chocolate, earthy. Just smells weak. Taste is actually not terrible. Very thin mouthfeel, but the taste could be good for the right hot day. Small chocolate taste, malty, burnt flavors. However, the finish has this...blood taste to it. Not huge on the blood, but the rest isn't bad, especially for 2 bucks. Might by this again...but might not."
"O- For two dollars? This beer is a winner. Otherwise? Average at best."
"If I see it out on the shelf, I might pick it up again, but if I see Young's Double Chocolate, or Rogue's Chocolate, I'll go for one of those."
""
"O - Not the greatest thing in the world but for the price it's not that bad and I would get it again."
"Overall, a pretty decent beer. It's far from great, but it's worth trying with the price tag it has."
"Simply average."
""
"In conclusion: Alright. Not regretting the purchase, and thinking it would be a heck of a lot better than the Guinness/Murphy's cans floating around for St Patty's day. But I won't be calling my friends to recommend it either. For 1.99 a 22oz I'd have hard time making this beer! Good effort at that price point. Will try it chilled tomorrow."
"I really enjoyed the chocolatey, dark bitterness. Definitely will have again."
"Notes: I did not get any chocolate out of this. Great value and true to the style, so i didn't kill it on the rating. It is, to me, entirely average."
"Overall - Very similar to the Bison Organic Chocolate Stout in many ways, but I'm digging this a lot more."
"Pours dark brown in color with a rather sizable tan head. Not a bad aroma, actually. Some chocolate along with roasted malt and a mild toffee sweetness. There might even be a touch of vanilla. The roasted malt is the most dominant flavor, but there is a little bit of toffee and chocolate in there. The vanilla that seemed present on the nose doesn’t really come through at all. The body on this beer is incredibly thin and light."
""
""
""
""
"Reminds me of a Foreign Export Stout to some degree - a touch sweet and rough overall, but quite drinkable and almost as good a value as ""two buck Chuck."""
"Overall a decent American Stout with some dark roast flavors but probably not one I will be revisiting anytime soon."
""
""
""
"A no-frills, uncomplicated, yet very pleasant chocolate stout that is what it says. Deep, dark brown in color, creamy tan head, with a rich, malty scent. The flavor is not complex or original, but the roasty malts and strong chocolates are great, balanced by just enough hops, give a rich but smooth and dry finish. The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy, but very drinkable and not heavy. Overall tasty, very easy to drink, and well worth $2 for 22oz."
"Final thought - $2 and very drinkable? Yes please! Add a teaspoon or 2 of bourbon and a pinch of sugar and watch out!!!"
""
"Too bad we can't rate economics, as this 2 dollar beer has a great value, if not the best of flavors. On flavor as it is, it's better than the DIPA for the 2 bucks, but not on the ABV. Also, it seems that this beer is meant to be enjoyed cold, as all the flavors and smells aren't as good warm."
"O- This might be one of the fastest drinks of chocolate stout I've ever had, as it's as thin as a pale ale and hardly a challenge. Best as a sample for someone who doesn't like dark beers too much, or to satisfy a sweet tooth."
""
"Overall: This beer is a pretty solid beer nothing spectacular but the simple fact that it is only $1.99 a bomber will keep me purchasing it more often. I can honestly say that this beer might give you the most bang for your buck"
""
"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Foamy thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, chocolate syrup, and some dark cocoa powder. Taste is of dark roasted malt, unsweetened cocoa beans, and some slight coffee bean flavors. There is a slightly sour and roasty bitter flavor to this beer as well. This beer has a crisp carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good stout especially for the price but not worth buying again in my opinion."
"Another one of Trader Joe's deals here. Aroma is better than flavor."
""
""
"Aroma offers dominant notes of carob and cocoa with some faint spice as well. Some earthy hop notes pop out a bit with some warming. Taste follow and adds a bit of dark cherry and chocolate. Nice and smooth in the delivery though a touch thin in feel at first, firming up with some cocoa and spice on the finish. But then at 5.4% I guess it does just fine. And a solid value for sure though not particularly 'chocolately' foor a self proclaimed chocolate stout."
"Overall the best beer yet from Fresh & Easy. Two bombers of this for $5.99, a good deal on a tasty beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, for $2 this is a steal. I would absolutely buy this again for that price."
"The beer poured fine and had nice head. flavor very nice, fresh chocolate or cocoa and bold. This is as good if not better than Guinness extra stout and for the price is amazing. It did lose the foamy head but was perfect with the last gulp of beer. So stout lovers drink up!"
"T: Roasted malt, some powdery cocoa powder and a hint of earthy hops on the finish. For me, the taste was a little too one-dimensional and it got old before the bottle was through. Still, at $1.99, this is an absolute steal. Very worth the price."
"From the 22 oz bottle. Another beer sold by Trader Joe's and brewed at the old Huber brewery in Monroe, Wisconsin. Label says ""Rhinelander Brewing Co."""
