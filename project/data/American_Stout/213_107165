3.7,-2.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 9/25/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, cream, light char, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and coffee notes; with great strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, cream, light char, and roasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, cream, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good complexity and solid robustness of dark/roasted malt and coffee flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. There is a fair amount of dryness on the finish as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly creamy, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice coffee milk stout. All around good complexity and solid robustness of dark/roasted malt and coffee flavors; and very smooth to drink. This felt more like a dry stout, but was still nicely enjoyable.","superspak","Jan 21, 2015"

4.1,7.9,4,4,4.25,4,4,"I have to admit that I was skeptical about this beer given the Narragansett name, but it totally delivers. It's rich with an authentic coffee flavor, as well as chocolate and caramel; and perfectly balanced without any flavors covering over others, or eventually building to take the lead. A moderate bitterness balances it, and it teeters between sweet and dry, but always with a pleasant roasted edge. Some might argue that there's not enough body or malt to it, but I feel that if it's got the flavor that you're looking for that's enough; it's a trade-off, more body and malt might be more satisfying, but less leaves it more drinkable. It finishes dry, and fairly short, with some coffee and dark chocolate lingering along with some very subtle hops. It's not complex, but it's rich.","NeroFiddled","Jan 08, 2015"

The pour is beautiful and the finish leaves you wanting more; this works out well given the moderate ABV, which lends this to be a definite session candidate.

It does not smell very intense, which is fine because the actual smells are on point. The flavor was pleasantly dry. It was not too sweet, thankfully. The coffee and roasted flavor are dominant. Unsweetened chocolate also works it's way I'm. There is some sweetness but it isn't an overly sugary beer. Body was slightly creamy but not too heavy. I enjoyed this one.","VelvetExtract","Beers"

Aromas of dark roasted coffee, subtle crème, hints of bittersweet chocolate, and earthy notes. Flavors are pretty heavy roasted coffee forward, rich and bitter, with a highlight of cocoa nibs, subtle crème, and a hint of nut sweetness. Smooth bodied, with dry undertones, this is an easy drinker. The aftertaste has more of the milky sugar notes, with coffee and chocolate still blending together nicely. Smooth, slightly dry finish, with a solid bitter and roasted linger. This is a well balanced, solid brew.","GarthDanielson","Nov 17, 2014"

Crazy drinkable all around great beer regardless of style.  Great price too;  I'm a huge Stone brewing company fan, but their coffee milk stout isn't as good as this and it costs more for less beer.

So-so head but left decent lacing. Body was kind of weak. Decent carbonation. Feel it was made to be a flash-in-the-pan RI-thing by adding the Autocrat name to it. I didn't like it as much as I do the 'Gansett Porter. Hope they repeat it next year. Probably comparable to Sam's Winter Lager.","BeeGinner","Jan 30, 2014"

It is sweet, but it works. The coffee flavor could be better, but I suppose that judgment is wrong if you're a huge fan of Autocrat. I guess it's "a Rhode Island thing."","angrybabboon","Jan 20, 2014"

Slight amount of earth. The taste is when the roasty coffee flavor comes out. Dark and sweet coffee with some milk chocolate. Earth and bittersweet dark chocolate towards the end. Finishes nicely with some more of the coffee and lactose. Mouthfeel is light with lots of carbonation. Very drinkable. Overall, a great addition to the 'Gansett lineup.
