"Easily the best coffee stout I've tried and it is probably the best non BA stout I've tried...one of my top 10 favorite beers...can't recommend this highly enough"
""
"The only reason why this doesn't get a perfect 5 is because Good Morning exists and this beer can somehow be improved upon. The smell is out of this world, only can really compare it to a fresh 2013 BCBCS (without the bourbon). This is what a big coffee stout should smell like. incredible smooth taste with balanced sweetness and bitterness. Coffee flavor is still there. Love this beer and lucky enough to live in MA."

"Treehouse can do no wrong.  Distant second to good morning."

"Very strong on the coffee to the point of being a bit out of balance. Definitely a step or two down from Good Morning"

"There's not much more to say, Treehouse hit this one out of the park... again."

"If I had some now, I would put it in my morning coffee cup....Smells and tastes like coffee"

"o; A very tasty and easy drinking brew, which does not suffer from a thin body as some do.  A solid top level stout."

"O: One of the better, and definitely the best in recent memory, regular coffee stouts Iâ€™ve had. I wish this was available locally because I would definitely drink this regularly. Thanks again for the growler Kevin!"

"Appeared solid black in the light of the bar, with a dark brown head that retained as a small ringlet, leaving dots of lacing on the glass. Earthy, roasty coffee in the aroma, dark malts and more roast. Good melding of dark malts and coffee in the taste, which I like, as opposed to some coffee beers, which end up tasting like a full-blown glass of cold coffee. Notes of caramel, ash, and maybe some subtle dark fruit. Rich, tasty, smooth, medium to medium-full body. I can be picky with coffee beers, but this is probably one of the better ones I've had."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The nose is 100% coffee dominated. The flavor is also strong with coffee but there is plenty of beer aspect remaining. Get this, its great. Thank you Heath for sharing."

"One of the best coffee stouts I've had, even up against some double digit ABV stouts."
""
"Overall not bad but mostly just all coffee. Doesn't have a ton going for it other than the coffee, which is great, but more complexity, or at least the nice malts I know are there that can't get through due to the coffee just overpowering them, would be nice."
""
""
""
"O - Overall this beer was pretty good, loads of coffee but that's about it. Really would benefit from some barrel aging. Some day."
""
"Edit: Had a sample at the source and it cemented how delectable this beer is."
