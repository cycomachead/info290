"Didn't even taste like coffee... Tasted like a cheap chocolate mess."

"Hefty pour left only a 1'', quickly dissipating, collar of foam. It looked pretty thin too. Opaque, almost a dark autumn amber. When I returned to my seat I realized that I could smell the deep roasted malt and quality coffee from 3 feet away! Very inviting! The taste wasn't what I would expect from the style, almost espresso like. If coffe is your style, then this is your beer. The mouthfeel was disappointing. Thin, and free of any carbonation. Overall a mediocre brew. I would, however, strongly recommend it to my friends who love that that in-your-face coffee taste."

"Good beer overall. Coffee smell is great, but a little off in the taste.  A little too thin for my taste in stouts."
"A good thin coffee stout. Not really much else to say, it's low ABV and mouthfeel make more like a coffee Porter. It's not bad at all, just not very complex."
"Nice roasted malt and coffee flavors. Light carbonation, with a smooth mouthfeel.  All in all a tasty brew. I don't know if I would seek this out to purchase on its own, but I always enjoy the two bottles that come in Lakefront's ""box of beer."""

"I enjoyed this beer. A solid coffee stout."
"Will not seek out and purchase again. Good, but there are other coffee stouts that I can get much easier."

"Very similar to Coffee Bender from Surly."

"Ratings on this beer do not do it justice.  Roasted malt and coffee flavors mix well, resulting in a pleasant drinking experience.  Will pickup again."

"o: A very drinkable stout.  Little indication of the presence of coffee other than in the initial aroma, but a solid example of the stout style.  Perhaps age muted the coffee flavor."

"Final Thoughts: Another decent stout with added coffee. Sort of a popular style these days. Would I drink it again? Meh."

"O- Pretty good coffee stout. Plenty of coffee, plenty of roast malt. Just about what you'd expect from an above-average, tasty coffee stout. This packs more flavour than our more local New Glarus Coffee Stout, but it hits you a little bit more quickly. Surprising that it isn't as well-received as I'd expect based on my review, but then again Lakefront has a tendency to be underrated. [4]"

"O- Very nice coffee stout.  I particularly like the pricing point (1.59 for the bottle at Copper Vine).  While not a deal breaker for me, the USDA Organic stamp is a bonus.  Maybe not quite up to the Bell's or Dark Horse versions, but very drinkable."
"Great aroma and a descent tasting beer."

"Overall (3.22) - Not a beer I'd buy again but it was an interesting tryout. I get an image of sitting by a fire on a cold winters' night drinking this beer with family and friends. But of course there's winter lagers for that."

"coffee coffee coffee the over powering smell of coffe the overpowering taste of coffe thats all i can say it gags me i cant get tatse out of my mouth i got nothing more to say about it skip it and try another beer they make others but this one doesnt work for me the coffee lingers too long in my mouth"

"The mouthfeel is quite thin for a stout, with active carbonation playing on the palate. Overall, this is a very disappointing brew. The lack of coffee presence, and the lack of complexities in the stout as a whole make it something not really worth drinking."

"OVERALL: Fuel Cafe delivers on the promise of an accessible coffee beer, and it works, but doesn't take it to the next level like some gourmet coffee brews. Barrel aging or adding more quality ingredients could really develop this one into something special."

"Pours black, some fizzy tan foam on top but mostly settled and gone. Dark chocolate nose, some coffee. Stout taste, coffee flavored, light bitter. A little buttery. Taste fades, not abrupt. Becomes more coffee like over time. Lightly carbonated. Good."
""
""
""
""
""
"No real complaints, just not as ballsy as a beer called 'Fuel Cafe' should be. Still, a worthy coffee stout."
""

""

"Dark brown in color with a fairly limited amount of light breaching this beverage. The khaki colored head quickly dissipates to the point that it only just covers the majority of the top. Aroma is faint but is a blend of roasted barley and coffee. The flavor is predominantly bitter dark roasted coffee and yet the back of the palate is a bit on the sweet end with plum like notes. The mouth is a bit oily and viscous."
""
""
""
""
""
"If you like coffee and beer and coffee stouts you'll enjoy the drinkability of this one, don't expect to be wowed with stout attributes. More of coffee brown ale or porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fidelity notwithstanding, this is a surprisingly drinkable coffee stout--dare I say sessionable--if one avoids excessive warming."
""
"This beer pours a bit thin looking, with a crackling, active head that manages to stick around for longer than expected. Deep dark hazel brown color, a deep garnet/reddish hue to light. Decent looks, smell is a bit odd, almost a smokey-fish smell initially. Hint of peppers in there, but devoid of heat. Grainy smells, a bit of coffee in there, too. Taste offers more than the aroma, with some decent coffee flavors and dark roasted grains. I still taste a sort of hollow peppers, no heat just the pepper essence. Is that the hops? The hops in this beer, seem buried, with only a bit of their potential peeking out from beneath the malt and roasted tastes. Taste is a bit scatterted, directionless. Wide array of flavors that don't quite mesh together. A ""coffee stout"" is a stretch."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep brown with a foamy brown head. Smells of coffee, chocolate and a bit of malt. Big dark-roasted coffee taste that overpowers everything else. Very little bitterness. Slightly sweet. Medium mouth, but not very oily. Coffee stouts have to strike a good balance to be noteworthy. This one is missing the stout."
""
"I was Jonesing for a coffee stout tonight and wanting something new so I bought this. I got home, saw the score and became disappointed immediately but jumped in with an open mind. IMO this brew is soooo underrated. This is a straight forward, no frills, no nonsense coffee brown, although it claims stout. Only two things hold this back for me-one is the sweetener aftertaste and the other is the thin structure, but hey, neither bother me. This you can literally have in the morning and get a nice buzz to carry you-if you were inclined to do so. Hell, Mikkeller could put this brew in bourbon barrels for a week and sell this for about 6 bucks @ 12oz and receive accolades-I think you get my point. This Fuel Cafe sixpack is at a great price, a Mikkellerish like coffee stout (c'mon some of those overrated), Peruvian Morning aroma, not infected make this a click to pick!"
""
""

"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and coffee bean aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and slightly acidic coffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the coffee presence is better in the smell in my opinion."
""

"I had this on Nitro. It was pretty good. When a stout is on nitro, the coffee taste stands out. My girlfriend didn't try this one. She pouted and got mad. We went to comet cafe after this and I bought her a canvas bag. This kind of changed her mood."
""
""

"Overall: Generally, I can't see why this beer is rated as low as it is here. It's a solid offering, but one that could use just a little tweaking. More roasted malt would really make this beer take the cake- there just isn't enough ""stout"" happening in this beer for me. An offering with a higher proportion of roasted/smoked malt would make this one golden."
"O - The first time I had this was at the Brickskeller in DC and it holds some nostalgia for that reason, although even at that time I knew there were much better coffee stouts out there. Coming back to it I appreciate Fuel for what it is as an easy drinking stout with some coffee flavor. It is worth trying it you frame it from that perspective."

"DATE TASTED: December 20, 2013... GLASSWARE: Guinness pint...OCCASION: let the Christmas season celebration season begin!... APPEARANCE: jet black body--no daylight--with a dominant, three-finger brown head that settles to a beautifully even line'; no lacing, though .. AROMA: peppercorn, vanilla bean and coffee; creamy latte also works its way in; the combination is not altogether appealing... PALATE: a warming, rather thin body; slickly moves down the throat; mellows and remains drinkable, but not an impressive strength...TASTE: whoa--complex and intense--the coffee isn't pronounced, but creates a funky, briny stringently medicinal quality; a bit of a downer... OVERALL: surprisingly, a Lakefront bummer--the overall effect neither promotes the coffee or the stout aspects..."

"O - I am not sure why this beer is rated so poorly. I thought the flavor and aroma were great. It was pretty thin for a stout, but other than that I enjoyed it."

"The moderate carbonation gives a refreshing feel."
""
""
""
""
"O: I would prefer it to be a little fuller and thicker but overall it is a good coffee stout. The carbonation was surprisingly stronger than expected but it didn't take away from the flavor."
"O: Decent beer for the style."
""
""
"O - Coffee is certainly present in Fuel Cafe but it doesn't punch one in the face with coffee flavor or bitterness, rather, roasted malt incorporates quite a bit of dark chocolate flavor for a stout-leaning coffee beer that's lighter-bodied than it looks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Serve on nitro at the brewery. Appearance is black with cascading brown head. Typical creamy nitro appearance with heavy lacing and light brown head. Nose features a moderate level of medium roast coffee with notes if cream and light chocolate. Taste is neutral in the malt department with a light amount of roasted barley followed by significant coffee flavor. The flavors are somewhat subdued here, but what there is is nice. This is more of an easy drinking stout versus a sipper. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, overall, this could benefit form a lot more coffee and roasted malts."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I've had much better stouts with more personality"
"O: A mysterious and ORGANIC beer, definitely worth a try, but I will not be coming back. Good for a stout taste off, as an out-lier."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours pitch black with a small light brown head. Smells of coffee and raisins, interesting combination. Tastes of coffee and slight chocolate, but with a watery taste. Beer is carbonated heavily but full body goes down smooth. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
"This American Coffee Stout poured a dark brown color, produced an average tan head, average retention and it left some lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of prune juice and a slight hint of coffee beans. Aroma was underwhelming. Medium bodied there is a flavor of dark fruit and some hints of coffee. To thin for my liking- there are much better quality coffee stouts- I would not purchase this again."

"If you're looking for a good coffee stout look no further. This is quite good. It's one of two that I've had and I couldn't pick which one I liked more so I'd say try this if you want to get into it. I will say, if you don't like the flavor of coffee do NOT try this because you won't like it. That being said I think it's fairly accessible; I found it at my local Friar Tucks in Fenton. Enjoy!"
"Fuel Cafe pours a black color with a smaller lacing head. Their is a sweeter roasted aroma, with hints of coffee. The taste has a mellow sweetness, strong roasted flavors, with good hints of coffee. Nice rather full flavors, a bit too carbonated. Overall a nice easy drinking coffee stout."
"Overall: Not a bad beer, but there are far, far superior coffee stouts out there. This one just doesn't do a whole lot."

"Pours a solid black color with a small bubbly tan head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells of slightly acrid coffee with a hint of caramel, but little else. The flavor is an assault of java with a roasty malt edge. Light burnt caramel and dark chocolate malts attempt to provide some balance but aren't strong enough to stand up to the unrelenting coffee bean. Medium to thin body with a light carbonation and a slick almost ashy mouthfeel. Decent enough coffee bomb, but really could use a bit more body and sweetness to help stand up to the acrid and thinning effects of the coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty nice American stout. Coffee bitterness is a bit much, but it is still an enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"O: Not very good. Not a beer I would ever buy or order on tap if it were available."
""
""
"O- The weakest beer I've had from Lakefront. Maybe it would be better fresh. Right now it tastes like old coffee grounds."
""
""
"Overall not worth a repeated purchase but a great gateway to someone who wants to try a coffee stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is an awesome espresso stout. I wish i could buy this by the case but since I'm huddled away in a whole in Montana this'll have to do. the most concentrated espresso flavor i've had yet in a beer. Good job lakefront, always a fan of your brews"
""
""
""
"O: Not terrible, but not something I'd have again. A lot better offerings out there. Definitely an interesting take on a coffee stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not horrible and maybe hurt a little by age but I still think this is simply an average to below average beer because of the number of off-flavors and lack of substantive body."
""
""
""
""

"Correct me if you feel I am wrong about this BUT as a rule I expect STOUTS to be of a HEAVIER mouthfeel than PORTERS - even though BOTH can be a dense opaque black. This stout pours a beautiful chocolately opaque black with a thin tan head around the edge of the glass. I've had MANY porters like this but very few stouts - it seems misnamed. As a stout I would give it a lower grade than if it were classified as a porter. As a stout it lacked the expected body and malty flavor where as a porter it had a very sweet finish - too sweet for me. Billed as ""Coffee Flavored Stout"" I was wondering where the coffee went - I am an avid coffee drinker and I did NOT get the delivery of coffee at all while many stouts deliver strong espresso aftertastes. As a homebrewer, I know how it is to 'miss your intended style' and this one to me is more at> Porter or a black Belgian Ale style than a stout classification. If I were to rate THIS BEER in a ""style class of choice"" I would have the highest probable rating for this beer in the Belgian Ale classification with a judged complexity of sweet/sour notes and finishing notably sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall, while there was much in the nose that was excellent, the flavors were much weaker on the tongue, and were largely washed out by coffee. The watery mouthfeel does not help here, giving the impression of someone trying to disguise a weak porter with a bevy of coffee grounds. And even the coffee grounds aren’t terribly flavorful, equivalent to perhaps pre-ground Folgers, as opposed to fresh-ground Peet’s. Better ingredients, and a better recipe, including several more pounds of good malt, would have done much to make this beer more rounded and flavorful."
""
""
"Maybe it's because I drank this while eating a chewy chocolate brownie, but I loved this beer. Super match anyway. That was tonight, but I also had this a few months ago with a Cobb salad and that was a delicious match as well. It's a simple stout and seems like a great choice with food."
""
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a thin creamy dark brown head. Aromas of chocolate ice cream. Taste begins with a bit of acidic coffee bean flavor, followed by some schwarzbrot flavor, then a bit of earthy chocolate finish. Mouthfeel was watery and bland. Overall an average stout, pretty light tasting for how strong it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hops: Zeus"
""
"The taste has a burst of fresh brewed coffee flavor with a choclate coming after, i also pick up some roasted malt flavor. I don't detect any hops. The mouth feel is nice, well balanced, and rolls off the tongue very well, not to thick or to thin. Overall this is a a good coffee stout."

"O-	A decent beer. Not a whole lot of coffee flavor but the brew seems to be balanced nicely and is enjoyable."
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this one much more than I expected. Becoming a fan of Lakefront, between this and their IPA."
""
"Overall- Not a terrible beer, but if you are going to advertise as a coffee flavored stout I would expect a stronger coffee flavor (or stout flavor)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A most enjoyable offering from Lakefront, but I really love having my coffee in the morning and strong; therefore, it made complete sense that I enjoyed this stout. The infusion of coffee is a great coffee bean flavor without the bitterness. A must try if you're a stout lover."
""
""
"3.5 D: It's not an outstanding beer, but it's passable for a coffee stout. I don't understand all the hate."
""
""
""
""
"Medium to light bodied Stout, very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty bad showing here. The beer doesn't taste like coffee and the other characteristics don't compensate for this."
""
""
"I like coffee beers and this really delivers on coffe flavor but lacks any depth. It comes across like a cold pot of coffee with a mere wisp of beer. I'll be taking my beer dollars elsewhere. "
""
"Overall- This coffee stout is serviceable, and they would be very easy to throw back one after the other. However, if flavor and a quality feel are what you are looking for, it would be best to get your java fix from somewhere else."
"poured a deep brown almost jet black with a quarter inch brown head (quickly diminished). smells of robust coffee, tobacco, chocolate, cedar. tastes of chocolate up front, hints of barrel aging which is nice and unexpected..bringing out some sour notes.. black coffee and dirt. feels light bodied, which i don't really like for my stouts this rich in flavor, very fizzy and watery on the roof of the mouth. this was the perfect midnight snack. something to quench my thirst, and something sweet at the same time. not a great stout style, but the taste and flavor are definitely there."
""
"This beer pours black with a thin tan head and a thin lacing. It's aroma is of coffee with hints of smoke and roasted malt. The flavor leads with coffee followed through by a dark chocolate sweetness and faint nut notes. The flavor is light medium. Lakefront Fuel Cafe (Coffee Flavored Stout) is a good beer, smooth and a good example of the style. Recommended."
"Fuel Cafe is a very dark, nearly black beer with a small tan head. It's looks clearly like a stout. The smell is good...a medium intensity of coffee and roasted grain. No real hop scents, although there is a wood and charcoal scent, mingled with dark malt. The beer is dryish, with a malt and coffee flavor and only moderate bitterness. Medium in body, it does have a little oil-like slickness and some sharp edges. Drinkable and good, but far from great."
""
"M: Suprisingly watery. Good coating, decent aftertaste. Lacking some of the bitterness you'd expect."
""
""
"O - Overall I believe the best word to describe this brew is mild. Highly drinkable and contains the flavors one may desire but there is no boldness in any category to speak of. I will not be purchasing any more, as I feel there are a number of coffee porters that outclass this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Solidly drinkable top to bottom. Cheers."
""
"O: For the price, this wasn't bad. I would probably skip it next time though, just nothing really special about it."
""
"O: Inoffensive, easy drinking, but not worth paying considering that it's craft and you actually have to pay for it. Sierra Nevada Stout, on the other hand, worth every penny."
""
"O: excellent coffee stout. Really rich with multiple flavor levels and complexity. Really nice. Not too dry at the end which is exceptional."
""
""
""
"O: A very average to below average coffee stout that I just didn't get. Sorry."
""
"Pours dark with a thick, tan head. Looks pretty nice at first but dissipates fast. Smell has some coffee, some roast, some malts. Nothing crazy. Taste is very blah. Nothing much going on. Coffee is just an undertone. Feels watery and is just too thin."
""
""
""
""
"The one I had must have been better than the one you did because mine was fantastic."
""
"O: Tasty, but it hit a bit below the mark for me. The fragrance and taste both seemed a bit too subtle for what the name and appearance suggested. Very chocolatey with a good coffee flavor, but neither were sufficiently strong enough for my liking. It tasted surprisingly mild for such a dark beer, which is not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion, just not what I was hoping for. In the end I feel it is worth drinking as long as you're not expecting too much."
"This poured out as a nice looking black color with a tan colored head. The lacing wasn't too bad on the glass. The smell of the beer was full of coffee and other roasted aromas. The taste of the beer had a good amount of coffee flavoring along with some chocolate bitterness in there too. The mouthfeel of the beer was average, there wasn't too much in way of complexity in this brew. Overall it's ok but I wouldn't have to buy it again."
""
"Overall, this is a substandard beer. I purchased this bottle in Kansas City -- a market that has numerous other coffee stouts that are better (Schlafly's comes to mind immediately; let alone imperial stouts like Founders Breakfast Stout). This beer is kind of incoherent. I'd avoid it."
"O) The weak coffee flavor makes this a disappointing brew. The thin body makes it feel like a light ale with dark color."
""
"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Pours opaque black, head and lacing are lacking. Coffee, toffee, and alcohol aroma. Coffee is very present in the flavor - masking the lack of significant stout complexity. Very thin mouthfeel. Coffee aspect is not bad - without it you have a really wimpy stout."
""
"O- If anything's wrong with the beer, it's that it has a bit of an identity problem, since it claims to have mainly coffee flavor when it exhibits more of a chocolaty tendency. Other than that, it's not especially exciting but I guess they can't all wow ya."
""
""
""
""
"Aroma of burnt coffee. Appearance was a dark ruddy brown with a pale beige head. head lasted about 3 seconds and droped to an oily slick. no lacing.Taste of acidic chocolate and burnt french roast coffee. Funky, biting aftertaste. Why do brewers keep trying to mix beer and coffee?"
"O: Something missed the mark here. Not horrible, but not much coffee presence and not much else going on with this beer. Would not try again."
""
""
"Poured into standard pint glass. This beer is a deep rich chocolate tinted black. The dark cream head dissipates to a wisp with a ring of cocoa cream bubbles around the edges. Light lacing. Smells delicious: milk chocolate and cocoa, burnt malts. This beer tastes like it smells. A real milky chocolate comes through, and finishes with a dry, bitter chocolate malt note. It's sweet, too. The mouthfeel is just right for the American stout style. Overall, a really delicious beer. It's not cloyingly sweet, but enough to be a dessert beer. Easily drinkable, and very milk-chocolatey."
"The aroma was just loaded down with coffee. Rich notes of mocha mixes in with a rich, and sweet coffee note. A tiny bit of bitterness and an earthy flare lying down underneath of it, but the majority of this one was hands down, rich brewed coffee. The flavor was more of the same. Rich notes just rolled over the tongue in waves and thoroughly coated the inside of the mouth. Sweet with touches of chocolate and vanilla to highlight the coffee notes,"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Just an average beer, or maybe a little below average. I'd pass."
""
""
"Overall: Not a horrible beer, but not a lot of bold flavors going here. A thin stout with a dash of coffee."
"If you like drinking black coffee though you'll love this. I'd also like to add that the beer exceeded my expectations so that was nice. Not a bad beer at all."
"this one just didn't do it for me, nowhere near a drain pour but not something I'd ever spend 17$ for a 6er, waaayyy over priced in this part of the world."
"I enjoy coffee flavoured stouts but this one was too much coffee and not enough stout. The bitterness on the finish and the lack of a smooth mouthfeel really decreased the drinkability of this beer. I could barely finish one let think of buying a six pack."
"O - I almost want the label to say ""A Coffee Brewed With Stout"" rather than the other way around. Still a decent beer, but damn, so much coffee."
"If I recall correctly, this was $8.99 a 6pak at Total Wine. Well priced, I am liking Lakefront Brewery more & more."
"O: This is a good coffee stout and a fine way to start the day. I would've liked some more complexity, but if you're a coffee lover, this would be quite enjoyable."
"O: The overall impression I got from this brew is a lighter more approachable morning coffee brew, with a lower ABV for style and a lighter easy drinking character. I wouldn't say that this brew defines the style, but is a very nicely balanced beer."
"Not too good. I doubt I will revisit this one"
"M - smooth but with some hops/carbonation tingle; semi-dry finish. Near medium body."
"Poured dark brown black with an inch of tan head. Smell was coffee-forward with background notes of malt, grain, chocolate. Taste was heavily roasted coffee as advertised with malt and bitterness of the beer a background element. Body was on the lighter side of medium. Overall this tastes like a middling quality lager with a healthy dose of french roasted coffee, served cold. Decent but the flavor profiles are only partially integrated, perhaps by design."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, a little prickly on the tongue, some lingering dry and chewy feel as well. I'd like to see the coffee amped up a little on this, but not bad."
"Easy to drink. Nothing offensive, but nothing extraordinary."
"i have had coffee stouts that really tasted burnt, and others that have gone the opposite direction by going all Frappucino. Give Lakefront credit for doing neither. However, the beer was a bit bitter yet, and the consistency was little gritty. Nevertheless, a pretty good drink."
"M - Medium body, light carbonation"
"Overall, this is a pretty interesting stout, one that doesn't quite fit the coffee billing to me, but it's interesting in other ways. There are certainly redeeming qualities here, but if I want a coffee stout, I'm usually going to reach for something a bit bigger and a bit more coffeeish."
"O: its a gooood coffee stout worth the try"
"Medium body but bitterness prexominates. Interesting."
"Flavors are pleasant, but also a little too delicate. Despite the fact I had this on a hot summer night, it still felt a little too watered down."
"One and done for me. Overkill at its purest. The flaws are hard to overlook. What works, works really well, but as I drink this I'm adjusting ratings - lower. Everything works well but the taste, and for a beverage that's a big flaw."
"Overall: This is not a bad coffee stout but it's not great especially when you compare it to something like speedway stout"
"Pours an opaque brown colour with thin tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smells of very mild coffee with some mild roast, very faint smell for a coffee stout though. Flavour has a little bit of bitterness and roast, not too much going on. This is ok, but I've had much better versions of this style."
"D: It goes down pretty easily, but it's not something that I particularly enjoyed. I love a good coffee stout, but this just fell short."
"O - I have had better. I think it has potential but it fell well short of my personal expectations."
"O: Better then average over all prospect, but not by much based solely on nose and decent flavor, appearance and mouthful were average. Unlikely repurchase begins to tire out half way though, single purchase only."
"Overall, it is what is advertised. A very coffee forward, albeit simple, American stout. Wouldn't get again though when there is so much more that can be done with the style."
"O - A good coffee stout, but not as bold as I like my stouts to be. I guess for a 6% beer, that's to be expected. Still, a good beer."
"O - overall, ok. Maybe I just don't dig coffee stouts, but I was a bit disappointed by this."
"The label was notched ""June/Week 4", so let's call this six year-old beer. And by gum, it stood up well. I got a rocky finger of deep-brown head with limited retention. Color was a deep brown with only cola highlights at the edges. Nose was still rich with French Roast coffee notes. Very dark, very roasty, very coffee-like. I even got some dark chocolate in there as it warmed. Mouthfeel was not quite creamy, but close and the favor had begun to take on a (probably unintended) sourness to accompany the bitterness. It was not overwhelming, but it should be kept in mind if you want to age this beer. Finish was quite bitter, like my morning coffee. As a retired US Navy sailor, I drank my share of bitter coffee. We used to try everything, from ground cinnamon to salt, but when you are making massive amounts in a stainless steel machine, bitter is the name of the game. This had that same bitterness and all I need now is a doughnut, two eggs over easy and some grits and I'll be right at home."
"This is a good example of a coffee stout and one to try."
"Fuel Cafe pours a very dark brown with a head that doesn't stick around for too long. Based off of the smell alone you can tell there are more than just hints of coffee. Upon tasting, the burnt coffee notes were present along with a bit of a chocolate taste. The mouthfeel was surprisingly watery for a stout. I think this was a good beer, but not the greatest example of a stout."
"Aroma of dark malt and diner-style breakfast coffee, notes of cocoa. The flavor overall fairly matches the aroma. Mild bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit slick, semi-watery, finishes dry and tannic. Tasty but nothing special."
"O (D) - well, it's better than Guinness..."
"O- Not very impressive. I will not be seeking this one out."
"The mouthfeel is surely a bit thin for a stout, however the weakness of the mouthfeel almost works with the weakness of the flavors, so I can't dock it too much. The creaminess is fairly nice. The drinkability is fairly good. This almost reminded me of a Guinness draught with the coffee flavor amped up. Personally, I like my stouts a bit thicker and with more flavor, but I could see this having it's fans."
"Drunkability: Not bad, not great. I am back and forth on whether or not I feel like the taste is satisfying. It does seem rather filling. I guess I would take a 32 oz of one of these for a meal."
"O-A very average beer...run of the mill...mundane...mediocre...fair to middling...dime a dozen...well, you get the idea."
"O - Overall a decent coffee stout. Not the best i have had, but definitely not the worst. At $1.99 for a 12oz bottle i can think of many beers i would rather spend my hard earned dollars on."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a little head but vanishes quickly. Has that strong stout scent with coffee and cocoa being the most noticable. Has a smooth semi creamy taste to it and finishes with a strong coffee aftertaste. Not too bad especially since I don't care for coffee, but could use a little work on it's aftertaste."
"Taste follows this lead. Very coffee, with a hint of cocoa. I get very little complexity here. Suffice to say, if you like coffee, this one may appeal. Otherwise, Fuel Cafe isn't something I'd seek out."
"This beer has a very light mouthfeel with moder carbonation. It definitely dissapoints for a coffee infused beer. However, this is still a good beer, not to be ruined by its ""as advertised"" name. I would recommend drinking this beer with an open mind"
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side for the style, and carbonation is moderate. Overall, it wasn't one of my favorite coffee infused beers, but it was a decent American/milk stout. Easy drinking, slightly sweet, with some decent chocolate flavors."
"The mouthfeel seems way too thin for a stout in my opinion. Overall, the flavors don't mix very well. The aroma I described as tangy hops in the background almost seems sour in the flavor. I think a few changes are needed to make this a better brew."
"I remember thoroughly enjoying this brew during my days in NoVa, so I'm looking forward to having it again today. It pours a bleakly murky black-brown topped by a finger of sandy ecru foam. The nose comprises coffee, dark chocolate, light roasted malts, and a touch of straight dry malt extract. Not really sure what to think of that last one, frankly. The taste focuses on the coffee, though now it is more sour/astringent than dark/roasty. The dark chocolate returns, along with a beefed-up measure of roasted malts, and the DME seems to have dropped out (though I'm not terribly surprised about that), but everything seems to be dwarfed by the sharp coffee. It's definitely not a train wreck, but it's also definitely not something I would call genuinely enjoyable. The body is a sleek medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a pretty solid coffee stout, but the astringency of the coffee is a bit much and keeps this brew from ascending to the heights of greatness."
"D - Not a strong stout, pretty easy to drink. Just an 'OK' effort."
"EDIT: I just noticed the -proprietary- Lakefront date code notched onto the side of the label, and this beer is easily six months past its bottling date. In other words, this beer wasn;t fresh, but held-up VERY well. Better than I remember it, in fact, and as such I have adjusted my score."
"Has a fair amount of carbonation and is dry upfront to the end. This brew actually isn't too bad for the additional coffee, so be it."
"D/M: The first drink was pretty good then everyone after that seemed to go down hill. But overall I would never turn one down."
"D: A coffee should be centered around (get ready for it)...COFFEE. Instead, this tastes more like a rauchbier-mild porter blend."
"The fact that the ABV% was relatively low reinforced the notion that this was a good marriage of different flavors and styles. It would have been a bit more bold but for a winter beer that's dark and doesn't have any hint of alcohol in the taste, this is a good choice. It won't be replacing my drink at Starbucks but it's certainly worthy to have as dessert on a cold winter's night!"
"Overall, a bit too carbonated on the palate, as the fizz takes some of the texture away from an otherwise well-bodied brew. This is a fairly decent coffee stout, and I wouldn't hesitate to drink it again, though a bit more coffee and a good amount less roast will really do a lot for it."
"D- Nothing too impressive and with the weak mouthfeel it doesn't get much above average for me on this one."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.--Fuel Cafe Coffee Flavored Stout--Brewed By Lakefront Brewery Especially For Fuel Cafe--A Stout Brewed With Coffee--2011 12 oz. Bottle. 6.10% ABV. 18 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) No sediment. Thick dark bronze pour. Obsidian black brew. Big lacy dark espresso head. Rich roasted mellow coffee front. Crusty roasted burnt mild creamy sweet smooth coffee mild fruit Stout body. Dry mild hop tangy hint lingering roast refreshing balanced end. Sampled 1/27/2011. Malt of the Earth Beer of the Month Selection received 1/19/2011."
"D - Easy to drink and very tasty. A quality beer in many ways and a great stout for any night."
"I got this as part of a BOTMC. The pour is jet black and it has a thin little tan head, light lacing. The aroma is black coffee. It has black coffee up front, as well as some chocolate. It has a lingering bitter coffee finish. The beer is a solid medium body, carbonation is average/light for the style. A decent coffee stout, one of the better selections for the BOTMC."
"Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D/M: drinks very smooth on the pallet, slight lingering coffee malt on the pallet, slight carbonation"
"Cheers!"
"First beer I've had from Lakefront, not bad overall, certainly worth it if you like coffee stouts, just don't expect to be blown away."
"Flavors are simple citric bitter light coffee with a very short club soda water finish. Not for me."
"Overall- Pretty good coffee stout, but nothing outrageous or intense. If you like a healthy kiss of coffee without it being overwhelming, this is your brew! Relatively sessionable and quite enjoyable."
"D - Overall a very tasty coffee stout, and I would definitely grab a 6-er of this. The flavours are strong, but the sweetness is very tasty. One of the better coffee stouts I've had and worthy of trying."
"Drinkability - One and done, however, not as bad as the reviews make it out to be. Decent for what it is."
"I feel like this is a beer that ups its flavor character to hide the alcohol. At 5.9% it has to try to cover the alcohol, and it does this by upping the espresso and roasty character. For the first time in my life I am asking for a more tame version of a beer."
"for a run of the mill, think you can brew it, coffee stout. This one is ok. It really doesn't have the wow factor that I have come to associate with an exceptional coffee stout. Nice color, nice look, thats it. every thing else fall flat with this one. Sorry ."
"Notes: A slightly odd beer. Coffee was obviously a very strong component of this beer. The smoked malt/meat flavor and aroma really threw me for a loop and caught me off guard. Not a bad beer, but I probably won't get it again."
"D - Good coffee flavored stout! Great aroma and body compliment the taste well. Nothing extraordinary but still very good and highly sessionable."
"Tempted to add a shot of half-n-half to the black coffee to take the edge off the bitter burnt sensation. I've no sense of the beer hiding behing a bad cup of coffee here."
"The unbalanced taste really throws this one off for me; not drinkable, and I would not get this again."
"Another impulse buy that turned out ok. I was quite impressed with the consistency and dark color pouring out almost in clumps. The aroma was malty with cocoa and coffee. The taste was a good portion of coffee with a bit of cocoa and toffee. Being a Starbucks my expectations for coffee are a bit high but this was enjoyable. I downplayed the mouthfeel because it seems a bit acidic for a stout, this lessened as the beer warmed up. I'd get this one again, but not frequently."
"Not being a fan of coffee in any of its myriad forms, I still find this to be a pleasant enough stout - flavourful, and enjoyable. Worthy of picking up, for javaheads and anyone else."
"Overall: Not a bad beer, but its grade will get hurt for being called a stout. This seems like a really dark porter in flavor and mouthfeel, but it's nose and look definitely fit the style. I've had much better coffee stouts as I expect something a bit more flavorful."
"Overall not a bad beer, but one that definately needs some work."
"The coffee is there but it's a little weird. It has good flavors but they don't quite line up. That being said, I enjoy this beer. I took a chance and bought a six pack. I would buy this again."
"Not sure what is bad about this beer. I'll have to read some of the other reviews. It's a pretty tasty beer IMO, and only has a slight off flavor variation in the taste, mostly from the coffee I believe."
"It's hard to put my finger on exactly what's not right with this beer. It doesn't have any glaring mistakes, just the overwhelming, odd coffee flavor. And I'll note here that I'm a coffee enthusiast and I've never found coffee that tasted quite like the coffee character in this beer does. Perhaps Fuel Cafe Espresso Stout would be a more appropriate name that would indicate the strength of the coffee in this beer."
"D: Very light for the style and when combined with the taste, you could do well to have a few of these."
"So for a Coffee Flavored Stout is it not overly coffee.. strange, but overall not a bad little brew."
"D - my love for coffee saves this brew. I could have a few of these before wanting to move on."
"D- it's okay, certainly unexceptional. Reminds me of when I brewed a can of Mountmellic with a little coffee. I could take it or leave it."
"Pretty good coffee stout. Not up to standards set by others, but worth a try."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink; the flavor is good but it doesn't have a lot of body."
"Overall, drinkability is decent. It's obviously a well-crafted & proportioned beer. I just wish it had more coffee on there. Though it isn't something I'd seek out, I'm glad to have tried it."
"This is a pretty heavy-drinking beer eve for a stout. I am really enjoying all the roasted coffee flavour they packed into this one. It delivers exactly what it claims to deliver. Overall, a really tasty brew but I would rather stick to one serving of it rather than pound back a whole 6-pack - it's just a bit too heavy for that. Still, a must-try for all coffee lovers."
"Bought at The Bier Stein in Eugene OR. Surprised to see something from Milwaukee in Oregon, but anyways, this beer is meh. pours a dark brown, but appears black in the glass. no lacing whatsoever. I got this because I'm a big fan of coffee beers, but I refuse to buy this beer again. Taste is so-so for a coffee stout. I def. wouldn't drink more than one of these. the smell is probably the best part of it."
"All in all, not a brew for the taste. Nothing special by any stretch of the word."
"Like many other Lakefront beers, the maltiness waivers a bit at mid-palate, allowing for a grain character to a bit more of an impact than I prefer."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, small fizzy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with a slight hint of coffee. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, bitter, nice touch of coffee. Medium body. Drinkable, I was expecting more from this brew."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Nonic. Pours from the bottle a dark brown almost black color, minimal tan head formation. Aromas of caramel stand out in this one more than coffee. Flavors were smooth and not overpowering with slight malt and a hint of coffee that intensifies upon swallowing. The brew is light with good carbonation. No apparent lacing throughout. Overall this was a very nice beer. It was easy to drink and had a nice flavor as well. As I don't drink coffee, this was a nice stout. I was concerned that the coffee would be overwhelming but it was not at all. Very enjoyable, but still not a homerun."
"D - goes down easy enough but just one is good."
"Holy coffee batman. This is a true coffee stout. Stay clear if you are not a coffee fan. From what I gathered from the bartender this beer has about 4 cups of coffee worth of caffeine per pint. That said the smell is of a fresh coffee roast but has hints of chocolate. The taste starts sweet with a slight carbonation bit then becomes dry with a blast of coffee. For me I gave it an average on taste as i do not like the taste coffee that much but this beer is very unique and deserves consideration for any coffee lover."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer but there are several other coffee-flavored beers that I would choose first."
"Beautiful pour with a creamy head and a black, opaque color into a snifter. Just a little lacing, but the creamy head never completely went away. Smells sweet, almost fruity like an oatmeal stout. Tastes wonderfully sweet, almost caramelly. Reminds me of a Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout with just a little coffee flavor, but nothing like I expected (which isn't a bad thing). Fuel Cafe Stout is not too sweet by any means. Mouthfeel is good with exceptionally drinkability. Not a session beer. Would be a great breakfast beer, however. The best from my Lakefront 8-pack sampler so far. I couldn't find a fault with this beer, but being a newbie I didn't want to seem too enthusiastic. I notice I'm well above the average for this beer, but I really did like it.There was only one in the sampler; I will buy a six-pack."
"Medium house roast coffee in the aroma, a little coca cola. Low intensity, not too interesting, but ok. The taste is much of the same, with a little of an off-flavor that I can't quite place. Low coffee bitterness, same with the coca cola-type sweetness going on. A little too thin of a mouthfeel, low end of the carbonation spectrum for the style. It's ok, but there are better coffee beers out there."
"Wow, mighty tasty beverage here. Smooth coffee roastiness is nicely offset by a pleasant chocolaty sweetness. Just creamy enough not to be thin, yet silky and very drinkable. Seems to have maintained a decent hop bite and dry finish. Chocolaty flavors and low fruitiness make me a fan of this coffee stout. Not sure what it would taste like fresh, but I am digging on it with a touch of age."
"D - It would make a good breakfast stout! I would share this with family and friends, but isn't something I'd take to a party to have lots of."
"Pours a dark brown color with a small brown head. Lots of roasty grain, coffee grounds and cocoa in the nose. Medium/full bodied stout, light carbonation with great coffee flavor. Excellent drinkability a great almost sessionable offering in a style that is becoming very over crowded."
"D - Low price + easy mouthfeel + <6% ABV = a very drinkable stout."
"All and all, a pretty drinkable beer. The flavors are balanced with nothing cloying or overwhelming. I could have a few of these with no problem."
"Overall a quirky coffee ale. I really have a hard time thinking of it as a stout. An English dark ale would be more like it. Too watery and quickly fading flavors for my liking. Glad I tried it and also glad I only bought a single."
"Mouthfeel is excellent, you come across the nuances of bitterness, layer by layer with the burnt malt. Chocolate minimalism, this one is dominated by coffee and toffee flavors. Very drinkable, both for the ease with which it hits ya, but also, a decent price at $7 a 6er."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a deep dark chocolate brown color with a brown 2 finger head that settled to a 1 finger cap. The aroma is full of burnt malts, slight caramel, and light coffee hints. The taste is a little overpowering on the burnt side. There is a subtle coffee taste that is nice and the sweet brown sugar is good but not strong enough to over take the malt. Could be a better balanced brew, but I like the fusion of coffee into a brew."
"Drinkability: Btw the taste and the mouthfeel I'm not wanting to drink more."
"This stuff is alright but I will stick to my RIS from now on. If I want low volume stouts I will but Samuels Smiths Oatmeal Stout."
"Drinkable, but not a great example of the style. There are many other coffee stouts I would grab before this one."
"D – I am not stoked on this at all."
"To summerize: I like stout and I like black coffee. Both of them together sounds great; this beer was not. I had this beer more than a year ago and thought it was wonderful, not so thrilled this time around."
"Into a pint glass: poured black with two fingers of brown head, with fairly good lacing. The smell consisted of coffee beans, brown sugar, oak, and seemingly a hint of whiskey (?). The flavor was certainly lacking; earthiness, oak, and surprisingly little coffee relative to the aroma. Semi-dry finish, and dry afterwards. Medium-bodied, with more carbonation than expected. Too flavor-less for me to session."
"Pours a midnight black body with a thick, dark tan head, that eventually falls to a cap. Aromas of coffee, cream and vanilla. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Flavor is dominated by bitter roast coffee that gives way to a dark roasted malt character with a slightly sweet aftertaste. I've remembered this being better in the past, but this bottle may be a bit passed it's prime."
"Seems to be a decent ""small"" alcohol stout, but the price of $10 detracts from the drinkability of this brew. An average brew with a high dollar price tag."
"Overall, this beer has potential, but it is just too light. I loved the aroma, but then I got to the taste and it was just didn't pack the punch I was expecting. Still, fairly decent."
"Very dark brown body with a thin off white head that fades quickly to nothing. Aroma is a coffee note tinged with lemon. Slight acrid notes push through as well. On the palate, the smoky, coffee flavor takes on almost a meaty quality. There are touches of malt sweetness, hints of slight sourness as well, almost like a small amount of sour-mash wash used. Mouthfeel is rather light, carbonation is slightly prickly. Drinkability is OK. More malt, less sour mash would be appreciated here. All in all, on average beer."
"I'm not sure what to make of this beer. For a stout, the body is quite light and watery and it really doesn't have many characteristics that I associate with stout, namely bitter chocolate and roasted flavors. I guess I just expected this to smell and taste more like....well, coffee. The beer is not bad by any means....just odd."
"Still in all, a pretty drinkable stout that tastes pretty good if you weren't expecting a lot of coffee flavor. The biggest flaws were the aroma and mouthfeel, for me. Not bad, though."
"Pours a pitch black color with a one finger dark tan head that retains decently. I am getting no lacing on my clean beer glass. Smells and tastes of roasted malts, sweetness, and some chocolate and coffee. The coffee is really light and not what I was expecting. It has some coffee bitterness to it. I get some sour to it and it is confusing me, not good in a stout. Mouthfeel is pretty light for a stout but the carbonation is good and there is some creaminess to it. Drinkability is alright, the price was good and the flavor is not bad. Not really sure if Ill have this one again."
"Picked it up in a Lakefront sampler pack and this was one of the better ones. This is a very candy like, sweet stout that reminds me of the Old 38 stout. Pours a deep dark brown, almost black, overflowing tan head. Smell was a very strong coffee with a ton of sugar, McCafe like. This a better beer but not the best, pretty simple. But since this is a small micro in NorCal, big ups to that for getting out here."
"Pours a dark brown color with a large tan head that had good retention. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Not much going on in the aroma or flavor department that tells me this is a coffee infused beer. A little roasted malt in the aroma with notes of chocolate. The flavor reminds me of a straight stout and not that good of one. Some roasted malt and that about sums things up. On the sweeter side. The body is on the thin side. This beer has a severe lack of depth in many departments. Not many positives in this beer and not much reason to drink again."
"D - Not a terrible beer, but it's far from the level I expect from a good coffee stout. I had high hopes, which were dashed. Sorry Lakefront...just not my idea of a good American Stout."
"Drinkable, but there are definitely better, more well-developed choices out there."
"Conclusion: A simple, fairly tasty coffee stout that does not offend; that's really its only downfall; there's not enough to make it memorable...did pair nicely with some good dark chocolate, however."
"D - this is a decent stout. Good coffee flavors, but not much depth to it. Not bad, but nothing too extraordinary."
"D: This was pretty easy to drink, but that's not what I am looking for a in a style like a coffee stout. I want rich, complex, not thin and ""pound them back""."
"Pours a dark black color. One and one half inch head of a tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, sweet malt, hops, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of an American Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and sharp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of coffee, roasted malt, sweet malt, hint of oatmeal, hops, and slight alcohol. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend."
"Drinkability- though I was a little disappointed in this as far as coffee stouts go, I might pick it up to have around for it's drinkability."
"~ Purchased this 12 oz bottle from New Beer Distributors in Manhattan, NY. This beer pours black with a healthy tan head that diminishes quickly. The aroma I get out of this is chocolate, followed by hints of coffee and roasted malts. Taste is slightly sourish, and I did not really pick out any of the coffee. For a stout, the body is a little on the thin side. Overall, this is an interesting beer (interesting in a weird sort of way). Thank God for the Mix-a-Six! ~"
"Mine was fresh, maybe a month old or so...but I bought it right in Milwaukee, so...."
"Maybe with some olive oil this could make a passable salad dressing? Eh, probably not. Let's just hope it doesn't cause too much damage to my plumbing. Drinkability, no. I don't think I've even had a macro this bad. Anyone have a ""normal"" bottle??"
"This beer is easy to consume from a tulip glass with friends and pub food, and is well suited to consumption while watching a ball game."
"This beer pours an opaque black with a creamy 1/4 inch head that recedes rapidly. Nice lacing left on the glass. Nose is rather muted, some coffee and faint floral hops but that is it. Taste is of sweet malts up front, followed by faint coffee flavoring, touch of chocolate but I really had to look for that, with a hop bitter finish to it. Light bodied, high carbonation, carbonation is almost distracting in this brew. If you are looking for a stout, there are numerous other offerings that would be a better representation."
"Poured into a pint glass this beer is dark chocolate brown. A small smattering of head dissipates and leaves a bit of lace. If looks mean anything I'm liking it so far. The nose is less impressive. I get a hint of coffee but for a beer named for an actual coffee shop in Milwaukee it's not exactly full blown java. The flavor is an even bigger let down. Uber smoked malt is the main profile player here. It tastes more like smoked meat then coffee. Hints of caramel and bitter hops can be percieved if you really try. It just comes back to smoke though. The beer is medium to light bodied. Very thin with moderate carbonation. This is maybe the weakest offering from a brewery I expect alot from. Well they can't all be winners. I will stop by the brewery in the near future and sample this straight from the cows udder. Maybe if it's fresh it will come across a tad better."
"Not the most pleasant of things, but it fills the need sometimes."
"Appears pitch black in body no light slips through when held in a bright room. Light tan head forms thick more than two fingers with and settles nicely. Head rises above the rim of my pint glass and dimples without loosing any liquid over the edges. Aroma has a touch of stale coffee with herbal hops, light fruitiness rises up as well. Flavor has a nice mix of malts and roasted coffee flavor, not a heavy espresso note think gas station black coffee. With fruit and herbal hops intermingling during each sip, pretty nice. Flavors aren't playing nice together actually a lot of clashing comes from the this pretty thin bodied stout, carbnoation level works but it's just not a big ol' coffee stout this is a dry irish with hints of coffee. Not bad just not my bag compared to some of the beer offerings out there. Drinkability overal is decent but definitely not a beer to beg for or carve anytime soon."
"Pours a deep dark brown that borders on black with a fizzy khaki colored head that quickly dissolves and leaves no remains. The nose has some chocolate, roasted malts and just a hint of coffee. The flavor is sweet chocolate upfront and is accompanied by some smoke and earthy hops and finishes dry. Its a medium bodied beer that has a hearty amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is completely lacking and the flavor is pretty faint as well and the body makes it seem more like a porter than a stout."
"Dry, bitter, and roasty, not very sticky like other coffee/chocolate stouts I've had. A good cheap buy - a very tasty and not lacking brew!"
"Comes out of the bottle a deep, warm sable with a very thick, fine-bubbled and fairly persistent beige head. Rich aroma is like a fine coffee and has hints of unsweetened chocolate and smoke. Flavor is like a good mocha, but too thin to be first-class - it does not seem to live up to the appetizing aroma. There is just a hint of sweetness. Texture is smooth but rather watery, not like most stouts I have tried. Still, it's OK."
"The feel is oily at first, then dry and ashy. Still, it's lighter-bodied. It doesn't quite live up to the promise of its look and aroma, but it's a solid beer nonetheless."
"Overall: I'm not very impressed, but it is drinkable."
"A bit tarter and more carbonated for what I would really like, but it does have a coffee character mixed with a solid stout character, and the detracters didn't totally destroy it for me. There are better coffee stouts (and porters), but this one isn't bad (if you can ""get over"" the minor flaws.)"
"Decent coffee stout, worth a try if you come across it"
"Out of standard bottle this beer was a nearly opaque brown/black color with lots of visible sediment. The head was tan, one-finger, retained decently and left respectable lacing. The aroma was of sweet malt, roasted malt, coffee and light alcohol. The flavors were underwhelming and perhaps a little washed out. Light chocolate malt, coffee, and toasted malt. One-dimensional and lacks the heartiness I expect from stouts. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium/full and the carbonation good."
"The totally neutral taste makes this beer close to a drainpour."
"Easy enough to drink, especially if you like coffee. Worth a try."
"I really wanted to like this beer and I'm a huge fan of coffee infused beer but this one really didn't deliver."
"Nice! Finally a coffee stout that tastes like, you guessed it, good coffee. Not the Dunkin Donuts coffee nor the watered-down, syrupy coffee, but honest-to-goodness, quality, roasted bean coffee. Was hesitant at first but found this a refreshing surprise. Would have liked the nose to be stronger, and you can't have too many of these as they are on the heavy side, but it packs a great deal of coffee flavor for just 6% ABV."
"Dark brown, flat, doesn't appear very lively - but that's consistent with most stouts I've seen. Nothing special. Heavy coffee scent that I like. Mouthfeel a bit on the thin side, kind of syrupy and sticky. Heavy slightly-burnt coffee taste that overpowers the beer a bit. I probably couldn't drink more then one of these without getting bored with it, but not a bad offering. This is my first coffee stout and I imagine there's probably better ones that taste a little more like beer and less like an espresso."
"D: You could drink it if you want to but honestly I really wouldn't care to have it again."
"Poured this into the in-law's version of a pint glass in South Georgia. Pours a watery brown with little head. Almost no lacing on the glass. Smell is very medicinal. I didn't get any coffee taste at all. Taste was a tart taste, almost like dark cherries and medicinal as well. Tastes like a dumbed down jaegermeister. Almost no coffee notes, which is odd since this is a ""coffee stout"". Not a fan of this one. Tastes too much like medicine and its coffee notes are nearly non-existent. Not a fan."
"d-one at a time. this is definitely a sit down beer. Avoid if you are looking for the slightest buzz because it will require much mental strength to do it."
"I don't get to try too much from Lakefront brewery (only their sorghum beer is available in my own town). Pours black.. and I mean black, with a nice light brown head. Smell is of roasted nuts.. smells like coffee.. what a surprise!! Taste is.. a lot of coffee. While I'm not a big coffee person, I don't necessarily hate the flavor. I'm sure this beer would taste a lot better if I did enjoy coffee more. As it is, it is pretty smooth with a nice creamy mouthfeel but its quite heavy on the coffee flavor. Also, the flavor of coffee does linger in your mouth for an unusually long time.. nice to try if you like coffee."
"Drinkability: one bottle was enough for me. The coffee flavors are a bit overpowering creating a one dimensional beer. If you are a coffee lover this beer may be for you."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled August 2008. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. It smells like roasted malt, coffee, and unfortunately a good amount of vinegar. And even more unfortunately, the vinegar is pretty noticable in the taste too, along with coffee, roasted malt and a weird sour taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick but also a bit thin. Drinkability isn't good, pretty much because of the off flavors of this beer. Looking at some of the other recent reviews, it seems there was a bad batch or two of this beer that was sent out. I can tell there's a decent brew behind the vinegar/sourness, but this bottle isn't good. The appearance was good, but just got worse from there. On the bright side, I only bought a single of this and not a six pack. I'll have to revisit this in the future."
"Note also, this was bottle one from a six-pack. Hopefully they aren't all like this, though I have my doubts if they came from the same batch."
"Body is thin with medium carbonation which doesn't work really well here, which hurts the drinkability. For my ""coffee"" stouts, I'll be sticking with Founders and Terrapin."
"Overall: Very disappointed and was expecting something completely different. Avoid this beer. Cheers!...or in this case...no cheers!"
"Poured fairly dark brown, with a cream colored head. Strong coffee aroma, slight roast malt. Taste is mostly bitter coffee, maybe some mocha, finishes a bit bitter. Medium body with some carbonation that borders on too much. Not real stoutesque. All around a bit too watery and timid. Wouldn't even say it's all that drinkable because of the bitterness. Just OK."
"D: enjoyable brew. I still find it lacking in coffee presence and would consider throwing a shot or two of espresso in the mix. As far as stouts in general, I find it very timid. i would like a little more malt presence as well"
"D: Drinkable, sure. The bitter acidic aftertaste kept me from wanting to drink another, good think I only bought one."
"The taste of coffee is intense. Very bold and rich. Too be honest, it's a bit too intense. There's a strong sourness and the coffee aftertaste basically makes you feel like you just had a coffee. It's an interesting beer in a very short dose."
"Pitch black beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is dominated by coffee.Taste is coffee bean,chocolate and molasses.Lightly carbonated with a pretty decent smoothness.I would recommend to try at least once.It's not something that is really going to wow you but it is still pretty good."
"6/4/5/3/13 (3.1/5)"
"Overall, it's low on firepower and has an odd echoing flavor that may get in the way. Making a coffe stout wasn't a bad idea, making a beer taste this way was."
"Good full flavors but not too overpowering. I could put down a few of these brews very easily."
"Not bad, not great."
"Pours a very dark brown with s decent head that fizzles away quickly. Smells of acidic coffee and dark chocolate but nothing overly expressive. Taste is of a sort of metallic coffee flavor, dark bitter chocolate, and a very slight raostiness, very little hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, airy, not too much carbonation. Its drinkable, just a lot better out there."
"Overall I'm glad I got a good batch; judging from other reviews the beer I had is certainly better than most. I recommend it, but caveat emptor."
"D= decent if you like this style, its a coffee stout for sure. I liked it for what it is but I don't think I will be trying it again, just not my style"
"M&D - will update when i retry this, i can stomach another swallow"
"Notes: I'm glad I only bought a single bottle at Olivers."
"This is amazingly bad.... The strange, overpowering sour unripened dark fruit flavor has no place in a stout, and is something I just can't get past. Possibly the worst stout I've ever had. Just terrible."
"Overall another dud from lakefront. Out of my 8pk sampler this was the one I had the most hope for, unfortunately it was not good."
"Mouthfeel: Appropriately thick mouthfeel."
"This could be an easy session beverage. Then again, so could water. Just not much flavor going on here to tempt me to come back."
"Horrible Stuff. 2 mouthfuls is all I could stomach. The rest I poured down the drain. Too bad for the drain."
"Served in a standard pint. Looks just like cola with ruby highlights around the edges and copious tiny bubbles that adhered to the walls of the glass. Sizzling and popping off-white head dissipated immediately. No lacing present during the tasting. Nose is dark fruit, sour, malt and some cocoa. Also picked up a slight metallic character. Taste consistent with nose, but sour dark fruit overwhelms the cocoa. Not sure where the coffee comes in. Mouthfeel is watery. Some carbonation and a slightly sour/astringent finish. Not a drain pour, but one was definitely enough."
"D- As noted above, I really hop this is just an infection and not the true representation of this beer. This was terrible."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a very dark brown with 1 cm of tan head that diminishes in the time it takes me to walk to the other room. I think there is some stuff suspended in the beer. Aroma of malt and a hint of coffee. Initial flavor of sweet mat, light creamy coffee comes in towards the end. No carbonation, light body, no lacing, no alcohol presence. Overall, wondering if I got a bad bottle, disappointed with this one."
"Drinkability is moerate. Poor flavors are uninspiring. Not the best coffee beer, but certainly not undrinkable."
"A drinkable beer. I thought it would be more strongly coffee-flavored, but this is decent. It could also be a bit heavier seeing as how it is a stout, but I would drink a couple or possibly a few during a sitting."
"Mouthfeel is actually on the light side of medium, low ABV goes down quite easily. If you are just beginning to try this style, give this one a shot."
"D: Not bad... just something a little off about it. Not one I could see myself going after again, though I might to see if I just got a bad bottle."
"Drinkability: Decent enough! Definitely easy drinking, particularly with the restrained ABV."
"drinkability - Not too fond of this. Some cofee stout, didn't like the sour bitterness to it though. Seemed more like a porter to me."
"Smells of sweet roasted malt with hints of molasses, chocolate and cinnamon. Pours to an opaque dark brown with a tan head that's not real foamy. Taste is a slightly roasted coffee flavor with a neutral dry bitterness. Good body, not too heavy, not too light. Carbonation seems a little high, and the beer would have more flavor with less carbonation. All said a tasty brew that has good flavor and is highly drinkable. I especially like the ""stout"" flavor yet the dry finish leaving one to take another sip. However the carbonation needs to be lower."
"Pours dark brown, pretty much black. There is somewhat of a head that forms on the pour, but it's quickly gone. Nothing remains. Smell is slight coffee and cocoa. Taste is coffee bean. Which is very good and dark. However, there's a sweet, off flavor that's coming through and completely killing all that good flavor. A little more thin on the mouthfeel than I like as well. It's just not good enough, especially in an over crowded style."
"Taste was very mild, very little coffee, just a little hint of paper. Really disappointed in the amount of coffee present. Thin and watery mouthfeel. All in all, not a very big or tasty beer."
"This beer was a very dark brown, almost black, color with a thick tan head. The head disappeared almost instantly. It had a strong coffee aroma, as well as some sweetness. Bitter coffee taste, with a sweet finish. Funny mouthfeel, I thought there was a real disconnect between the bitter coffee and the sweet chocolate."
"12 oz from LifeSource,Salem OR Nice looking stout, very dark brown almost black but not quite, nice tan head. Aroma is fine, as expected, coffee and roasty malts. Sweet malty flavour, with a hint of nice dark coffee, some fruity aspects also. Plate is quite watery, really watery in fact even for a sub-5% beer. OK but coulda been better had they improved the palate."
"Pours dark, dark brown with mahogany hints around the edges. The head is fairly small, bubbly and short-lived leaving just a bit of lacing. The smell sweet roasted malts and burnt espresso and dark chocolate. There is also a little licorice in the nose as well. The taste is sweeter than the aroma would suggest. There is the sweet roasted malts and baker's chocolate with a milder coffee taste with a lingering bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thin with pretty high carbonation. The drinkability is pretty high on this one but it's probably just an average stout for me."
"Pours a dark black with about a half inch tan head in my tulip. Nose is mildly tar-like with very little molasses in there. More noticed is the coffee. Flavor is a sustained bitter thing with definite coffee presence, but nothing really blowing away the palate. Feel is fairly thick on liquid and the carbonation is lower. Overall a nice enough stout to drink. No great shakes or anything crazy as far as the palate goes, but it's still worth going for."
"Loose mouthfeel, yet very easily drinkable..."
"D - This is a pretty good coffee flavored stout. I enjoyed it better than some. The coffee flavor isn't overdone."
"12oz brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester as part of this brewery's sampler 8-pack. Pours an opaque black body with a good inch of short-lived tan head. Smells roasty - like black coffee with dark chocolate notes. Tastes roasty and sweet, with strong coffee and chocolate notes. Full-bodied with ample carbonation, one sip definitely invites another. Nothing wrong with this brew - practically perfect coffee stout!"
"Pours a near black color with a smallish brown head. The smell is of stale coffee, some raisins, charred wood, and a light grain aroma. Not exactly big on the coffee, kind of unique. The taste is of stale coffee, woody, some roasted meat flavors, and a tad grainy. Not a true coffee flavor as it has other things going on. The feel is moderate with fairly active carbonation and finishes fairly smooth, perhaps a touch sticky and ends with a coffee bitterness. A solid stout down the board. I expected a blast of coffee flavor but this had other flavors that took away from the coffee."
"Fuel Cafe pours from the bottle as might be expected, bringing up a full, frothy head of creamy tan over its dark brown-black body. The head holds well, especially given that the oils in coffee would normally kill it, and it leaves some very nice Brussels lace about the glass as it goes. The aroma is more of stout than Starbucks, but there is coffee there, and it is noticeable. In the mouth, the coffee flavor somes on strong with an almost expresso-like character. It acts as the centerpiece, and also the back bone, to the rich maltiness. Some notes of dark, soft caramel and rich chocolate bouy it, and it's quite pleasant and intriguing. Many coffee-flavored beers can push the beans really well, but all too often they end up being just a little too much on the palate as you progress through the glass - even a little too acidic at times, but that's not the case here. Instead, it's fairly well balanced between malt and coffee, and the roastiness and acidity never overpower. Very nicely rounded, I could see having more than one of these in a row, although not too often. Perhaps during a cold winter storm, or a night at the pub with the lads. And I'd certainly be up for buying a six-pack to keep in the fridge for special occassions. Worth trying."
"Don't drink and review."
"overall, i enjoyed this brew and will look for it again"
"One more Lakefront to go. This mixed 8-pack of theirs is not a bad deal."
"Not a bad attempt, but nothing that could compare to other offerings. Terrapin, Dieu du Ciel, Bell's and Founders come to mind."
"A decent stout from Lakefront. I was expecting a lot more coffee flavor from this than it delivered."
"The taste is sweet but sour and tart, mostly winey steak sauce and prunes, with a ltitle vinegar, before a short dark toast finish. Oddly, the feel seems slick and oily but the body is thin and watery."
"D- This is good, the best I've had from Lakefront so far. I could have this anytime. I got this in a variety pack from Lakefront in Alabama and I would buy again if I see it around Nashville."
"Not a bad beer."
"12oz. brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Appeared to be bottle conditioned. Poured a deep brown/black with a quickly dissipating tan head. Roasted barley and coffee in the aroma. Some sweetness lots of coffee and chocolate in the flavor. A little thin on the body. Some hop bitterness in the middle. Long dry finish with more coffee and chocolate. Fairly easy drinking."
"D: An interesting beer from Lakefront, would have again, but there are certainly better coffee beers to be had."
"Light-medium in body, thin and a little watery. Too much carbonation takes way from smoothness. First few sips are great, but it just gets boring. I didn't finish the bottle as I just lost interest. Not horrible, but just dull with not much depth or flavor."
"I hate to do it, but there's really no reason to go out of your way to try this one... get Hitachino Nest Espresso Stout or Meantime Coffee first. This is a very average coffee stout."
"D - Ok drinkability. The coffee character in this beer leaves something to be desired. It is assertive but nondiscript and lacks the depth of coffee character that the few excellent coffee stouts possess. The weakest point is its almost artificial tasting sweetness, but that flaw is mitigated by a quite pleasantly flavored coffee finish. The overall impression is a bit strange; this beer isn't really all that great while you are drinking it, but the finish and lingering coffee aftertaste are very nice."
"Overall impression: Smooth, pretty drinkable. This is a nice offering that I could definitely drink a few of."
"Pours out thick and very black with a thick frothy brown head that leaves decent lacing.The smells are like a almost empty coffee pot left on the warmer all day,its borderline offensive.It tastes bitter and burnt,and not in a good way.Sorry but this just doesn't mix very well,it also tastes like cheap gas station coffee,with no sweetness at all I found myself actually wanting to add sugar,it really needs some help.If there was a .5 on the drinkability I would score it lower than 1.0!"
"Pours a nice dark brown/black color, but with almsot no head and no lacing at all. It has a slighlty sweet scent to go with its slightly burnt grain flavor, but I detected an off-bourbon scent instead of coffee. A very odd and off taste, it seems like they brewed stout and poured brewed black coffee in at a 2-1 stout/coffee ratio, and it didn't mix well. It's fairly smooth, but it's one of the least well flavored stouts I've ever had."
"The body is fairly moderate, there is a little bit of carbonation going on. I liked everything about this beer except for the taste. I will never get this again. Maybe mine was skunked or something, but there was definitely something I didn't like in the flavor."
"Poured a very dark brown, nearly black as coffee. A super nice light chocolate brown colored head that faded to fast and has some spotty lace. Smell is faint of black coffee and darkened malts a bit chocolatey. Light coffeeish taste, dark and earthy and espresso-like. Some coffee-like dryness and very light hop dryness as well. Feel seems to light, I needed more body and heftyness. Its a little to quick to end, I wanted more body and longer lasting effects and flavors. It's a nice light stout, not bad, not great, so so, could be better I think."
"d: An odd coffee beer. Lots of coffee bitterness, not much coffee flavor. Some odd sourness. Don't know if my bottle is off or this is as it was intended. I like coffee beers, but this one is not for me."
"The beer was very dark brown, almost black in color. Opaque, with a small tan head that quickly thinned out. The smell was of rich coffee and chocolate. Very nice. The taste was of strong coffee, with dark roasted malt notes, however the mouthfeel was much thinner than I like from a stout. The alcohol was very apparent as well. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't my favorite."
"Looks great, but doesn't hold up. This beer should shed the sour and embrace the large, fat belly of the American stout."
"i'll happily deposit the rest of my six pack in my belly, but will pass in the future when the chance to purchase this lakefront offering occurs."
"Easy drinking stout."
"Although not my cup of tea, this is quite good for what its trying to be."
"Quite dark with a bit of fine, tan foam, some lacing. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa and roast, light coffee and a hint of cherry. Low bitterness with considerable sweetness, lingering fruit, some roast and sour cherry. Fizzy carbonation, medium bodied with a fair texture. Pleasant enough, but a little too fruity."
"Pours a dark brown/black with a big tan head that hangs in there for a while. Minimal lacing. Smell is surprising, in addition to malt, I detected a Belgian beer kind of dark fruit aroma..very nice. Taste was average for a stout...some malt and dark chocolate, the coffee was the predominant taste. The taste was just ok, nothing memorable. The relatively thin mouthfeel affects the taste. Drinkability is good...but just not that great a beer."
"A very deep black stout with a thick cocoa-colored head that eventually fades. The aroma is all about roast coffee, roast barley, and drk chocolate malt. The flavor is true to the aroma, with a little malt sweetness to balance the roasty elements, but mouthfeel retains an unrepentant bitterness like a a straight shot of espresso. If, as I do, you like your espresso without all the sugars, flavoring syrups, and other crapola that the coffee joints seem to believe is necessary, this will be a great beer for you. If your idea of great coffee is a strawberry grande latte with extra sprinkles, fuggedaboutit, and while you're at it get out from between me and my coffee and admit that what you really want is a milkshake. The flavors in this brew are a little too intense to qualify as a session brew, but a second or third wouldn't be overwhelming."
"D. very drinkable. would go great with dessert or a good cigar would definitely have again"
"D - Great beer. I bought the variety 8 pack from Lakefront Brewery. I was not thrilled with any of the other beers. This is the first I haved really liked. This is really good. Buy it!"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was black as tar and had a nice tan head that was very lumpy, very poofy. The smell was of coffee and nut. The beer had a rich toffee coffee tast with a bit of nuttiness to it. I liked the beer and will try it again I'm sure."
"This beer poured a tick black oily color with a thick brown head  unfortunately it isnt retentive. The aroma is simply coffee. The taste is coffee with a hint of sweetness. The coffee flavor is strong  nothing else seems to make much presence. The mouthfeel is medium and could stand being a bit more full bodied to bring the brew together. Overall, this is an interesting beer and if you like stouts and need a jolt of caffeine, then this may be a good option."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is small, tan, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of coffee, with a hint of milk chocolate, but is rather faint. The taste is like the aroma. It is very pleasant, but would be a lot more enjoyable if it were stronger. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a higher level of carbonation than I like in a stout. Overall, this isn't a bad beer, but there are a lot better coffee stouts out there. I don't think I will drink this again."
"Deep black color with a very slight, tan head. Slightly fizzy. Aroma is sharp and metallic-amost smells of rust. Decent roasted flavor with a healthy dose of coffee thrown in. Coffee doesn't overwhelm like I was expecting it to. Body is somewhat thin-a slight boost would bring up the flavor some. Enjoyable and drinkable brew. I was afraid it would be all coffee and it wasnt. Nice effort."
"Overall a pretty stout. Seemed a bit processed flavorwise (perhaps some artificial sweetness), but tasty nonetheless."
"I've avoided this beer in my fridge lately during my nighttime drinking, but it looks like the perfect after work pick-me-up today. Pours a jet black hue, topped by a small finger's worth of tan head that doesn't stick around for very long. Aroma of roasted dark malt and pure fresh coffee beans. Palate is a sweet blend of roasted dark and chocolate malts, along with some dark fruity notes. The coffee flavors come through mid-palate, along with a touch of hoppy bitterness. Finish is a creamy coffee flavor that leaves a lingering sweetness. The creamy body is great for the style and for the flavor combinations in this beer - I wonder if they used any oatmeal in the brewing process. While I wouldn't want to drink one of these every day, this is a solid beer that packs a bit of a caffeine punch as well. Well done."
"A slight disappointment. I am a coffee stout fan, but this was lacking a rad. Appearance was fine, with a dark brown appearance and nice pillow head. Smell was roasted malt with just a hint of hops. Taste was tangy, almost a bit astringent, coffee and cocoa aspects were evident. Mouthfeel was light and a bit watery. Drinkability suffers due to sourness/astringency."
"Overall, not bad but not good. I wouldn't search this out again, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"Nothing special about this beer to make me want to go back. Pours an inky black with a coarse head that subsides quickly. Smell of dark unsweetened chocolate, a slight coffee note, really a rather acrid aroma. Coffee doesn't come across well in the flavor either. Bitter in an sour way with a thin mouth feel for the style. Can't really say I like this beer, the sourness really puts me off."
"drinkability is good for a stout. this is not a rich or bold brew, but is more laid back and subtle. overall, it could use more character."
"d - easy sipper and enjoyable overall."
"Sorry that this is such a miss. Not bad tasting, no serious flaws, but neither refreshing, filling or interesting."
"Pours a dark black with a thick chocolate milk head that dies quickly. Smells of roasted nuts, some chocolate and to my surprise just a touch of coffee. Tastes as it smells which is a big dissapointment. For a coffee stout this does not even come close to the mark. Mild flavors, minor hop bite at the end. Smooth in the mouth with some carbonation. Drinkability is high but Ive been thrown a curveball with no coffee to be found. Will not be trying this again."
"Overall: Not a good version of a coffee stout at all. The coffee taste is lacking, and there is nothing really left behind worth a mention. To be honest I would not drink this one again."
" ~ I don't see myself looking to try this brew again. The simplicity and subtleties of what I think a beer like this should focus on are not accented in any way. I will not recommend this beer to my friends."
"This is the stout from Lakefront that I'd like to try against other stouts."
"D - I can't handle this. I absolutely can't stand artificial sweeteners and that is really the dominant flavor. Yuck."
"Came in my Lakefront Variety 8-Pack. Coffee Stout. Now there's an image for you. Dark, rich and caffeine-laden. This is two of the three. I didn't read any caffeine amounts on the label, but the rich color, the soft carbonation, the smoky roasted (not coffee, but malt) smell and the moderate (refreshing) mouthfeel sure woke me up. Nice presentation. The taste was not disappointing either. Reminded me of a very well-done porter. Roasted malt through and through with a touch of bitterness to keep you drinking and give it an edge. Like some who have posted here, I really didn't taste coffee which, for me, was a good thing. I like coffee to be coffee (and beer to be beer) so this was a great!"
"Taste is coffee with a roasted maltbitter, also some roasted malt. There is some vanilla in the taste. Coffee is not as strong as in other coffee beers, but there is certainly a coffee flavor. Mouthfeel is soft and drinkability is good. Body is a bit too thin for this beer."
"The coffee is there, it may be the age, but it gives a more sour impression than i'm used to in a coffee stout (not a bad thing). There's a round, medium mouthfeel. Pretty malty. Easily drinkable, most likely better on tap."
"D- A decent beer, but farr from great."
"Pours black with a good initial head that fades to a ring. The aromas are of vanilla, roasted coffee beans, chicory, and perhaps a slight whiff of hazlenut. The taste is quite nice, and not too sweet. Initially, there is a hit of roasted coffee followed by some creaminess. The overall impression is of decent coffee with cream and a touch of sugar. Several reviews have mentioned the lack of coffee flavor. I can only surmise that freshness matters greatly with this brew. My sample was straight from the distributor as a new product and was markedly flavored by coffee."
"A very nice. easy to drink, stout."
"Overall: I am a sucker for coffee stouts, so I picked this up right when I saw it. I wish it were more of a coffee stout. It's a decent beer, walking the line of a sweet stout and a porter, but the subtle coffee flavor of it lacks the edge I look for in a coffee stout. Decent beer, not what I was expecting."
"Fuel Cafe (Coffee Flavored Stout) pours an opaque black that is brown around the edges with a thick light brown head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is kind of funky, there is a touch of what I guess could be coffee in it, but really just kind of smells like burnt malt. To me, the coffee flavor seems quite strong at first. I see others don't feel that way, but most java stouts to me seem to have a green pepper flavor, and this one doesn't. There are some chocolate notes too. Mouthfeel is just a little thinner than I would like. An interesting beer, worth a try."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" dark brown head over the almost opaque dark brown brew. Head holds nicely, with thick slow-falling lace. Aroma is dark grains with some tartness. No coffee? Taste is lightly of dark malts to start, but quickly gives way to moderate tartness, and that's about it. Again no real coffee here either. Mouthfeel is creamy, and drinkability is alright, but the lemony character just doesn't belong here."
"D- I found this beer to be very drinkable."
"Overall, this is a pretty tasty coffee stout that I might order at a pub for a change of pace, but I won't be buying it for home again anytime soon."
"12oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours a deep dark black color with a tan colored head that leaves a decent amount of lacing arond the edge of the glass. The aroma is extremely faint and it is hard to pick up much at all. The few faint flavors that do escape from the aroma is dark roasted malt and a touch of coffee. The taste begins with a bittersweet roasted maltiness and some coffee flavors present in the finish. Overall, I am not a huge fan of this stout and will steer clear of it in the future."
"Coffee stout is made or broken by how well the coffee blends with the stout and the method in which it is used. This particular brew has some redeeming qualities, but it falls just short of being more than average. I could probably drink a few in one sitting, but there are better coffee stouts to be had."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Notched as bottled Wk4, Feb. Poured a dark brown color with a brown bubbly head. The head was heavily carbonated, mostly big bubbles, and disappeared quickly. Couldn't place anything special in the aroma when I smelt it. Possibly very very slick undertones of coffee, but nothing really noticable. The flavor was reasonable, in such it had no major flaws, however, it also had nothing to make it stand out. Try as hard as I might, couldn't taste any coffee at all. Felt fine in the mouth, absolutely no problems. Easy to drink, however no real compelling reason to drink it. Overall, just an average beer."
"My first offering from Lakefront and to be honest it likely wont be remembered,poured an ink black with a thin quick to fade mocha colored head that left no trace as it settled.Hmm something is off in the nose it has almost a sour lactic quality to it wich isnt very appealing in a stout some roastiness and mocha java qualities show thru as it warms a bit but still that sourness never really fades.Way to thin and prickley in the mouth pretty much water fizz,no depth in flavors light roastiness and earth.Ouch this is really bad and I hope to forget about it quickly this is a drain pour."
"I was excited about this beer, as other coffee stouts I have had I really enjoyed. I saw the Brothers review, and glanced at other reviews, before reviewing. I really was as objective as possible, but the consensus is spot on. This is an okay brew, but lacks depth and complexity."
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my Sly Fox shaker glass. Appears a medium dark brown with barely a finger of tan foam. Smells of roasted caramely malts, and coffee. Tastes of bitter coffee beans, vanilla and bittersweet cocoa. Thin in body and mildy carbonated. Worth a try if you like the style."
"12 oz., bottled during the second week of November. It pours quite black with a thin, dark khaki head which swiftly forms a small collar before eventually reducing to nothing. Rich coffee and roasted malts in the nose at first, but soon an imposing sourness shows up. On the palate there is strong coffee with roasted/burnt malts, along with some sweetness, yeast, lactose?, and a distracting sour character. The body is drying, light/medium with comparable carbonation, and it leaves a medium finish. Overall it seems a little out-of-whack - not sure if the sourness is intentional or if this beer oxidized too quickly; and the coffee didn't meld well with the lactic/sour quality. A disappointment, but luckily I've got a Java Stout waiting for comparison."
"($8.69 / 6-pack)"
"you're looking for an amiable sweet stout this is a good place to start."
"D: A pleasant stout, not disappointing on its own although I would have preferred a more forward coffee presence. Would probably make a decent pairing to a platter of fish & chips."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is almost black in color and has a one-finger, bubbly brown-tan head. Smell is not as coffee dominated as I had expected although it is there. There are also some chocolate notes and a malt presence. The taste is also not as dominated by coffee as I had expected, the coffee seems more like an aftertaste than anything. This is good though, a sweet chocolate/amber maltyness balanced nicely and just a touch of coffee at the end. The mouthfeel is also a bit lighter than I would have expected and it has a light mouth-burning carbonation. This is a very drinkable stout, in the time it has taken me to write this review I have almost finished my pint. Excellent taste, although it could be stronger in some areas, it's a winner."
"This poured from the 12 oz bottle with a black, maroon-tinted hue and a nice rolling-hills head of tan froth. The aroma was vaguely roasty, but not as buzz-inducing as a Starbucks -- which is what I expected. More disappointingly, the flavor had barely the lightest twist of Columbias finest bean. In fact, the more I drink, the less I sense any java. Instead I get a vaguely roasty brew with a bit of a milky aspect ... pretty much a let down. (#2690, 2/7/2007)"
"Drinkability is very low for me. Given the difficulty of getting through one, I may have to save the rest as pawns to sacrifice if someone too drunk to care about quality attempts to raid my stash."
"Well, compared to the best I've had, this one adds up to really good but the six of Brooklyn's Chocolate Stout in my fridge, the best wins."
"I guess its not too bad, but its just not what I expected. First of all, it has all these strange flavors that didnt really do it for me. Secondly, the bitter, roasted coffee character was disappointingly mild. Not recommended."
"Interesting brew - Would try it again. Glad it was part of gift pack."
"Not sure what went wrong here - struck me as too much coffee and not enough stout. Thin with a slightly acidic sour note that vied with some smoke/roasted malt for control. A little astringent at the finish, like cold coffee. If the malt presence had been pumped up a bit and a touch of sweetness in the malt to balance the acidty had been added, this might have been pretty good. As it was, it was drinkable, but not particulary enjoyable. One where you sigh as you contemplate the five left in the six-pack. Wonder how this would be in chili?"
"This looks damn good and smells pretty nice....just don't put it in your mouth."
" The drinkability improves as it warms. But for me The one was enough. MK"
"Yuck, not very drinkable in my opinion."
"This beer pours incredibly dark with a thick, yet suprisingly frothy and light head that dissipates farily quickly. Despite its billing as a coffee-brewed stout, the smell of this brew is fairly unremarkable and is perhaps a bit yeasty. What this beer lacks in smell, however, it makes up for in taste. This brew drinks very plesantly--appropriately heavy yet very smooth. The coffee flavor of this beer remains an undertone and does not dominate. I am able to taste both roasted malt AND roasted coffee notes in this beer. I highly recommend this beer as one that is suprisingly drinkable, given its heavy appearance and one that is uniquely tasty."
"A thin feminine stout. Lacks body, complexity and balance. The coffee is very latte esque and has hints of sweet dark chocolate. Lactose is very prevelant. It wouldn't be bad if they made it more robust and complex. Unfotunately it's not."
"Not a whole lot going on in the Fuel Coffee Stout. It's light, and not really bringing much coffee flavor."
"The pour was deep brown almost black with small head. Aroma was uninteresting and flat with just a very light coffee scent. Flavors were also a bit flat with light coffee and almost no hops presence. Mouthfeel was watery and bland. Drinkability was that of water. You can drink it all day, but why. Overall, a rare disappointing review for me. Not impressed with this one. But, I do look forward to sampling some of the other brews from my home town Lakefront Brewery in redemption of the brew city."
"drinkability: it is not that good, and not what it says it is, but if i liked these flavors, there is nothing about it that makes it slow to drink.. not to thick, not to sweet not to bitter not to boozey it goes down easy, but i just dont like it."
"D - Due to this beers rather unimpressive taste and character its hard to palate more than one of these beers in one sitting. While it is not bad it just simply is not unique and does not stand up to most other beers of its style."
"A one and a half finger head after a hard pour. No retention or film. black, slightly syrupy molasses. A decent aroma of Folgers coffee beans with some caramel malts trailing off at the end. The tartest tasing American stout I've had. Almost like they brewed this beer with Brettanomyces yeast. Why would you want a tart coffee stout? An almost sour palate. Very tart to say the least. acidic, and drying. I woould not recommend this beer to the served with anything if you like sour coffee and beer."
"Drinkability: I can finish this one but would not seek out another"
"Pours a four finger dark brown head that fades instantly leaving no lace. Black color. No carbonation and heavy bodied. Roasted coffee/sour cherry nose. Roasted/burnt coffee, sour cherry syrupy flavor, no aftertaste. Not what I was expecting, Redhook had a much better coffee stout. $1.29 for a 12oz bottle from Blue Max Liquor Burnsville, Mn. I agree with Beaver13s comments, brewed in March and should be good now."
"Overall, I'm not impressed. I've liked the coffee stouts I've had in the past and this is a very sub-par example. I get very little coffee out of this. I wonder if this bottle might be bad with the sour notes. I have had this once before and remember not being too impressed, but I don't remember it being this bad."
"Deep mohagany color with a capuccino head that dissipates quickly. Good lacing left behind. Roasty aroma. More stout like than coffeeish. Smokey and a touch sweet. Coffee smell seems to be more remnant of malt used than actual coffee. But I still really like the smokey characteristics of it. Taste has more coffee present in a quality made stout. This is no Breakfast Stout, or Java Stout, but it has its place. Solid coffee backing, touch of smoke, good amount of sweetness. Caramel frappucino-ish. An enjoyable beer. Very drinkable."
"Dnot bad, but not great, overall flavor is pretty mild, I doubt I would have another."
"Pours black with a light cola like head. Strong coffee aroma has me salivating, it is mixed with a lighter chocolate aroma, this beer smells rich with hints of bourbony alcohol. The taste is where I was thrown, there is an extremely lemony tartness in the flavor which may be fine in another style, but not what I was expecting here, especially after the inviting aromas. I'm not sure if the tartness is a result of roasting the malts and the tangy acidity that follows or something else, but it masked most of the flavors and was very prevalent. Mouthfeel was good for the style, smooth and creamy with a nice dry finish. I have more of these and will sample again with the hope that the taste in this bottle was a singular event as I usu love coffee stouts and this one was otherwise quite promising."
"Not a horrible beer by any means, but it could use a little bit of work. I will enjoy the rest of this six pack, but I don't think I'll be buying it again anytime soon. There are just better coffee stouts out there."
"Into a pint glass, pours an opaque black with fizzy tan head shrinking to a sparse foam. Decent lacing. Aroma is lots of coffee and roasted malt, some chocolate, maybe a little nutty. Taste is less coffee, more roasted malt, chocolate mixed with a mild hop bittering, and I want to say I taste some raisin in there. But the body is too thin, too carbonated, and I have to burb up way too much gas it pisses me off. I probably would have liked the taste better if the mouth weren't so ridiculous. Overall, glad I traded for it, cause it was an interesting taste, but not again."
"Fuel Cafe Coffee Stout is a strange beast in that it isn't very coffee-like at all. An ounce of Peche Mortel per bottle ought to fix it right up. My two other experiences with Lakefront beer (Organic ESB, Pumpkin Lager) were less than happy ones. This beer though, while a bit bizarre, is worth a purchase if only to see just how bizarre it really is. Don't worry, there's still some enjoyment to be had."
"A pleasant, but unimpressive stout. Pours pitch black with tan head, like a good coffee stout should but lacks head retention. Smells mostly of roasted barley. The coffee flavor really comes out in the aftertaste, which is nice. Too bad thats the best thing this beer has going for it. Reminds me of a slighty dumbed Kalamazoo Stout. Fairly close in flavor, heavy on the roasted malts with a touch of coffee."
"Verdict: Judging by the label, I expected this to be a gimmick beer. I guess that's what it is, but it's still tasty. The flavor is bold and unique. I just wish the mouthfeel could be smoother."
"The mouthfeel loses points for being rather stingy in the beginning, but a bout halfway through the pint that fizzled out to reveal something more pleasant. Quite drinkable none the less, especially for such a flavorful beer."
"Overall: A decent stout with a somewhat unusual flavor."
"Pours like your classic stout, but the clasic-bness ends there. Rich black color with a decent, but quickly fading head. Very rich and bitter fore but that is the best part it goes down hill from there. Something watery in the middle and aftertaste ruins the overall effect. The coffee is there as is some roast and chocolate, but that watery flavor just kills it. It is still decent enough just doesn't live up to that FUEL hype."
"The mouthfeel is thin. Not very drinkable, and falsely advertised as a stout (much less a coffee flavored stout)."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a towering tan head that slowly fades. The aroma is decent. It has a stale roasted malt scent along with light hints of coffee. It's sweet and toastey with a slight metallic aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth roasted malt flavor with a sweet finish. It has a mild coffee flavor, but nothing in you face. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. It is a little thinner than what I prefer, but it drinks well. This is a fine brew. It has excellent flavor, but the aroma is weak. I would buy this again."
"This is by far the worst coffee stout/porter I've had ( out of about 6). The one that work, well like the red hook expresso stout use the coffee as an enhancer, this tastes likes the coffee with beer added as an afterthought. Plus it did a terrible job of waking me up!"
"Drinkability: It has been a long time since i have been this bored by a stout, pass."
"ehh, this was far from moving, glad i tried it though"
"12 ounce bottle. This beer looks very thick pouring out of the bottle and into my glass. It's color is black with a brown head. Caramel and roasted coffee aroma. Starts out with lots of coffee flavor, although it's not very bitter. Turns chocolatey in the middle, at which point the flavor dies. The finish is very weak. Too thin for the this style of beer. A do like the use of carbonation. There's lots of very small bubbles that you don't even notice until you try to drink too fast. This is a good stout, it just needs a fuller body and flavor."
"Not a bad beer, but it was weak on mouthfeel."
"Almost black in colour. Powerful coffee aromas. Flavors of strong coffee with a hint of milk chocolate on the finish. Coffee (rather than hops) bitterness is present, but not overpowering. This coffee stout is on the right track, but not quite there yet. It needs more body and more sweetness to balance out the roasted flavors."
"Excellent coffee stout."
"The taste, however, sets the tone for this beer, and it isn't that good. This beer is just an alien product to me that tastes like poorly spiked coffee. I'm left with a tingled mouthfeel and a bad aftertaste. Unless you like coffee/beer shooters...Pass on this one."
"Pours an inky black with a tan head and very good lacing. Looks solid and menacing. Surprisingly, doesn't smell like much. There's a hint of old coffee, but not much. There's some sweet malt upfront in the taste, but in the back, where I'm looking for chocolate/nutty/roasty flavors in a beer like this, all I get is a smokiness, like meat cooked much too long. It's acrid and bitter and not very pleasant. There's not a vibrant coffee flavor to this beer, like I was hoping. In fact, there's not a lot of coffee character at all, except that it's bitter as hell. There's no reason to get this beer. The worst I've yet had from Lakefront, easily."
"D- This beer doesn't have the stout complexity or big maltyness to stand up to the coffee. There is very little hops and the coffee taste is more of a cold coffee than a coffee bean taste."
"12oz bottled poured into a pint glass. Appearance is opaque black with a thin mocha colored head - no complaints here. Aroma is (surprise) coffee. Also small roasted and chocolate in the nose. However for a coffee stout, the aroma is rather weak. The taste is like an average stout with old coffee added. First to the tongue is a thin roasted flavor, followed by lots of black coffee. Think about a cup of black coffee that you forget on your desk for two hours. When you remember it, its cold and potent. This beer is kinda like that. I really like the flavor of black coffee, but this is a little overdone."
"Last swigs: Bitter coffee stout. DFH Chicory Stout blows this away. Enjoyable interpretation of the style."
"Drinkability: I could drink these all day. Light enough that the drinkability doesn't suffer but bold enough to have some good character. More like a coffee porter for me. I'd recommend it to all."
"This is nearly exactly like a thinner bodied version of Kzoo stout. I attribute the metallic note, thinner body, and astringency to the coffee used to brew this stuff. Considering how much coffee they must have used to thin this stuff down, I'm not appreciating a distinct coffee flavor like I would expect in a beer of this style. A good beer, but it needs more malt body and less coffee. I'll stick with my favorite instead:)"
"Black, maybe a dark brown highlight around the edges but even against a light this beer is black and opaque. The head reached a little over a finger in height, foam color was russet. Head retention was okay; it faded a little too rapidly. Before long the foam had turned into a thin, foamy cap. This cap did have good staying power. Subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling all that well. The general look of this beer is positive, some of the details are lacking though; otherwise this beer would have had a standout appearance. The nose is roasty with chocolate undertones and some acidity from the roast. Coffee aromas are limited to hints of day old black coffee, very faint at that. A stout brewed with coffee, says the label, the nose says otherwise. Ive had regular stouts that have produced a more potent coffee aroma. The bouquet is simplistic but pleasant. Inviting but nothing special. The palate is good, nothing more, and nothing less. It is not anywhere near Bells Java Stout but much closer to Spilker Ales XPO. Id rather drink the Bells interpretation of the style. Coffee flavors are limited. Roast is slight, some chocolate, and just a dash of creamy sweetness. Acidic at times. Hops dont offer much, some random, light, earthiness maybe. The finish is far too quick and the aftertaste is empty. I cant see this beer working well with food, in large part because the body is too damn thin. Coffee stouts are good with various cakes and even steaks but there is no body here; it couldnt standup to most food. Oh well. Light in body, thin, watery, weak carbonation, the mouthfeel is completely unimpressive and outright disappointing. It is really easy to drink, there isnt much complexity on the tongue that forces you to slow down and really figure the beer out. Plus the body is thin; it slides down like a cool glass of water. Refreshing (!) but a pointless and undesirable quality in a stout. Ive had much beer stouts with coffee; Ill drink those and skip this in the future. It was purchased as part of a sampler-pack in Milwaukee, WI."
"Pours a coffee black with a small tan head with good lacing. Smells of sweet roasty malt, coffee beans, and bitter dark chocolate. Kinda mellow though. Taste starts out slightly sweet, followed by dark chocolate notes. The coffee bean kicks in later, bitter, roasty. Finish is joe bitter with a hint of cocoa sweetness. Mouthfeel is a little watery and too bubbly. Not a bad beer, but meh."
"A Starbucks Thanks to Minneapolis BA TallGrandeVenti for this one!"
"This is a nice stout made from the folks at Lakefront, who normally favor lagers in their repetoire. This stout, I presume made with ale yeast though finishing clean, gives dry stout lovers a beer to enjoy. Well done!"
"Nice thickish pour, opaque black with a sturdy dark reddish-brown head. Laces all over the place on the glass. Dark malty aroma, some brown sugar, just a light java tone. On the other hand, coffee starts the flavor profile in spades, a little obvious, but not unpleasant. Light caramel impression mid mouth with a light and overall too thin finish for my tastes. Coffee returns in the aftertaste. This is a decent beer, coffee and Stouts work well together, but it just doesn't have the impact like a Bell's Java Stout, for good or for bad. Smooth and drinkable though."
"Brewed with coffee from local bean roaster Alterra and made exclusively (although easy to find at most stores) for the Fuel Cafe. This is a very enjoyable Coffee Stout, but tends to lean more toward the bitter side. Somewhat forgotten and under-rated IMO."
"Labeled as Fuel Cafe Coffee Flavored Stout not Fuel City. Hope I'm reviewing the right beer. Pours an opaque darkest brown with a rich tan to brown head. Kind of nutty, roasty and fruity aroma, can't really discern much coffee. Tastes rather thin but a good roasty malt profile. Not picking up on any hops, nor coffee (other than the acidity that coffee would provide to a beer). Sort of like a milk stout. Enjoyable, but not really what I expected."
"Just one comparison to make...this beer is very similar in build to Guinness Extra Stout. It has that same fruity parts that really put it in a different category as far as flavor and smell is concerned."
"ng"
"The feel is disappointing when compared to the look. Whereas the look is rich and full, the feel is thin and a bit watery - more porter like. The drinkability is limited by the heavy coffee sense and a perceived high ABV."
"Poured like a carbonated cup of coffee. Yep, it has a definite coffee aroma not overpowering but distinct, a subtle chocolate coffee taste with a coffeebean aftertaste. You get a blast of coffee aroma every time you go for a sip. Nice for what it is, not a session beer, but something nice when you want to take a break from the hops."
"This one is new in our area, so I thought I'd give it a try. Really black with nothing coming through and a small dense head. Aroma is really nice with strong coffee and roasted malt but no noticable hops. Flavor is of coffee and malt that is dry and slightly bitter. Body is maybe a tad thin but pretty decent in my opinion. Overall this is a good stout that's worth a try."
"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Aug 4th, 2003: I normally like the coffee aspect in many Stouts but in this case it is a little too much. Pours like a cup of cold coffee. Very small beige head and thin lacing. Aroma is coffee, coffee, coffee. A little on the thin and brittle side for a Stout. This is actually leaning toward a Porter in many ways. The coffee flavor is dominant, with a slight roasty malt presence, but you have to search for it. The finish is a little watery and maintains the bitter coffee flavor found throughout. Lakefront really seems to be hit and miss to me."
"Taste is incredibly unique! Reminds me of a german smoked beer with delightful roasted malts and smooth smokey finish. The taste caught me off guard, but is balanced so that the palate quickly adjusts, copes, and then begs for more. This is one to go back to again and again."
"It's a nice light stout, not bad, not great, so so, could be better I think."
"A decent stout, that I'll give you, but where's the coffee already?"
"Fuel City Coffee Stout: Cripes, I hope there is no caffeine in this, cause its awful late. This is a black beer, not mahogany, black. Decent deep brown head shot up several inches, but settled down to a cream colored head fairly quickly. Hmmm, this coffee stout tastes a lot more like the grounds than the brew. The aroma ain’t bad, the taste just is not there. This beer is very light bodied as well, which is not a compliment. Fey."
"This is a black beer. It is a bit charged. Deep, thick, dense, creamy brown head. Nice chocolate aroma with slight coffee too. Very creamy mouthfeel. Nice lace forms as I drink. There are subtle tastes of blackened malts and java. There's a nice bittersweet chocolate aspect to this brew I like. Medium to full body and very easy drinking for a stout. Good coffee stout, but I wouldn't say it is great."
"Overall, I am a bit disappointed in this beer. When I drink a specialty beer, I want to strongly taste the ""Specialty"" part. This just doesn't pack much punch for a coffee stout (Kalamazoo's Java Stout is considerably better)..this one pours nicely...midnight black with a redish/brown creamy head. The aroma is a bit odd...There are some coffee tones but also almost a spoiled egg smell...There is none of that (spoiled egg) in the taste, but then again there isn't really a huge amount of taste to this. It is definitely on the drier side...and it is thinner than I expected. The taste is a cocoa base with some subdued coffee notes. I expected much more coffee on the nose and the buds. I'm not big into coffee stouts to start with but when I have one I expect more. I would not purchase this one again."
"Thick black with a brown wispy head. The smell is AWESOME with a dark roasted coffee smell upfront, mingled with roasted malt and some slight yeast and hop aromas. The coffee wasn't overpowering, but it was there, and very pronounced, but still allowing the heavy roasted malt character to come through. A medium hop bitterness cleaned up my palate, but still left some roasted coffee flavor behind. This stout has a thick and rich feel, near-perfect carbonation. I must have more of this stout..."
