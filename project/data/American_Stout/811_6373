3.95,2.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Highland's Black Mocha Stout pours a solid black, with about a finger and a half of tan foam capping the beer. Head retention is pretty good, and there's some spotty lacing left around the glass. The nose has a nice, fairly potent coffee aroma. Dark chocolate provides a solid background note. The flavor profile follows that outline exactly. Lots of coffee up front, an impressive amount for a beer of this size, and then dark chocolate creeps in and adds a little depth so that the beer doesn't just taste like cold chocolate. The mouthfeel is just a little disappointing, in that it's a bit watery. I know the beer's not even six percent as far as ABV, but I'd still like the body to be a little bit more sturdy for a stout. The carbonation is nice and understated though. Minor mouthfeel issue aside, Highland's Black Mocha Stout is a really nice beer, I'll be checking out more offerings from the brewery next time I'm down in North Carolina","axeman9182","Jul 15, 2012"

This beer doesn't have good drinkability, the bitter astringent finish and the lack of the flavor living up it's name would prevent me from wanting more then one, and it's a little tough to finish this glass. What I liked most about this beer was it's aroma, it was pretty nice and had some nice mocha like aroma to it. What I liked least about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, they were both off for the style and didn't work well with this beer. I wouldn't buy this beer again, and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone, there are lots of better Coffee Stouts around. I was pretty let down with this beer and so far I have yet to be wowed by any beer from this brewery, but I am still willing to give them another chance, better luck next time guys, this one needs a lot of work to compete with the better Coffee Stouts, but if it tasted as good as it smelled it might have had a chance, but that just wasn't the case with this beer.","StoutHunter","Apr 15, 2012"

Nice big hoppy finish left a very long lingering burnt aroma, I could literally taste it for 20 mins after the last sip, very outstanding full flavor.

The aroma brings a big wave of coffee beans and roast. The beer is malty, with a moderate amount of roast and coffee in the flavor. The coffee aspect could be a bit fresher and/or higher quality, as fresh, strong coffee can be wonderful in a stout (obviously). The body is a bit thin, but as this is a pretty drinkable, easy going stout at <6%, I suppose that's to be expected, at least to a certain degree.

Terrifically fragrant, the aroma is packed with a smooth combination chocolate and coffee. The flavor is likewise potent yet mild and smooth at the same time, with notes of creamy milk chocolate, weak coffee, a bit of nuttiness.

The aroma was of burnt chocolate malts, a leathery yeast and a moderate does of hops with a strong coffee and dark chocolate note with just a hint of molasses. It tasted moderatly bitter with a note of coffee in the beginning and then progressed into a mild bitter chocolate-coffee flavor with a nice hoppiness at the finish.

Decently assertive aroma of coffee and cocoa, light hints of roasted grain and sweetness. This, again, is a rather one-dimensional beer. But the taste makes up for it. Nicely roasted coffee beans, blended mellowly with dark chocolate to yield a creamy, mocha/cappuccino flavor. It's like cappuccino superimposed on Guinness Foreign Export Stout (w/e it's called). Finishes with a rich chocolatey and toasted grain character. Body is a touch thinner than expected but the carbonation makes for a creamy and velvety experience. A nice beer to have after dinner with some cookies or something. I approve.","DmanGTR","Feb 13, 2011"

Dark roast notes in the nose along with leather and some dark chocolate. Medium mouthfeel and a little lighter than I thought it would be. Dark roast flavors dominate the flavor but not overly so. For the roasty taste I am a little surprised there isn't a more bitter end to this but rather only very slight and end a little dry.

Smooth, slightly chewey and creamy with a bready feel and minor amounts of sweet caramel and chocolate. Unfortunately not well-balanced as the roasted and coffee malts seem to be more powerful than anything and leave a husky, dry backbite.

Rather heavy but that's to be expected. It feels like you ate a full meal after you've had a couple. Not a session beer by any means but a nice change up every once in a while.

4.07,5.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Up front, tastes as it smells, coffee, but again, it doesn't taste as strongly of coffee as some others I've had, and is a bit sweeter. The coffee flavor lingers, it seems like it's more of a gradual effect, and not all front loaded. There's a nice balance to be found here as the beer warms. Right away, I get a malty sweetness, but after a second or so the coffee catches up with it. There's also a little bit of a hop kick at the end in the back palate. Mouthfeel is full and chewy /sticky , I think a little more carbonation would help out a bit, keep things a little fresher. I do like that the coffee doesn't completely overpower this brew, making it pretty drinkable. The low alcohol content also helps on this front, there's quite a bit here from such a ""small"" beer.","damienblack","Nov 23, 2008"

Coffee, chocolate and malt. Taste consistent with nose, but a little more subdued. Coffee and chocolate flavors are very balanced; neither seems to dominate. Mouthfeel is somewhere between light- and medium-bodied with a mild carbonation throughout the mouth. Easy drinking and very flavorful for the style and abv.

The aroma is more of milk chocolate than coffee, but there is still some coffee in it. Roaste malt and vanilla round out the aroma. The taste seems to be where the coffee lies. Milk chocolate, vanilla, and roasted malt linger in the finish with more coffee at the end. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with light carbonation, and a velvety texture.

Roasted chocolate malt is the most defining smell but overall the aroma is not as powerful as I expected. The chocolate malt has a sweet, almost milk chocolate smell. Very mild hop taste carries through a milky & malty beverage. The malty flavor and creaminess is fantastically tasty. Smokey flavor like dark roasted cofee makes this a perfect treat for late afternoon. Light and watery mouthfeel from the hops but a milky/malty stout coats the inside of the mouth. I find it just as creamy as a milk stout but with a cleaner mouthfeel. For less than $3 for a tall bottle, I could easily drink this more often.","Big78CJ","Feb 03, 2008"

Looks a viscous, malty, roasty brew with tan head retention, lacing and everything else that is good in the world. Smells very chocolatey, syrupy, with hints of espresso, nuts, and dark fruits (fruit cake). Tastes even better. Best described as a Young's Double Chocolate Stout, but bolder. Hopped for balance and that's all. Allows the roasted grain and coffee flavors to round out the bitter flavors. Feels rich and smooth with a long lingering chocolate / coffee mix.

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"The 12 oz. brown bottle was adorned with the typical Highland Brewing Company motif with a Scottish theme. The pour appeared reddish brown and clear out of the bottle, but in the glass it was very dark brown and nearly opaque. The head was khaki in color and one finger thick. The aroma was that of a dark roasted espresso, with a smattering of chocolate. The taste was drier than I was expecting, as the dark coffee and roasted grain flavors supplanted any residual sweetness. Not much chocolate coming through in the taste to justify the mocha in the name. But despite that, this was a very delicious stout with a pleasing palette. A little hint of tobacco juice in the finish was followed by a brief hop flourish. Prickly and granular mouthfeel stopped just short of being chewy. This turned out to be a solid stout all around the board, so I am glad I bought the sixpack instead of a single bomber.","rajendra82","Aug 26, 2006"

Roasted malt comes through in the taste as well. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, not overly heavy. This beer is exceptionally drinkable, which is not a bad thing. I rarely drink more than a beer or two, but I might make an exception for the Black Mocha Stout. IMO, this beer compares favorably to most American Stouts.","ThorsHammer","Jul 01, 2006"

It has good balance between the sweet and the sharper roasted notes. Flavor is nice as well. Solid roasted notes that are mellowed by the lightly sweet chocolate, finishing with a mild coffee. It has a very creamy character to it that really rounds out all the flavors, keeping them all a little ligher than I would like. This one could use a little more forcefullness. This carries over into the mouthfeel, as it is somewhat creamy, with a light carbonation. It's moderate in body. I enjoy this one, but it just seems to lack anything that makes it stand out.

Good retention too which after awhile became very good lacing around the glass. Right from the beginning, you can smell the roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and a hint of toasted bread. The smells clearly prepare one for the taste, rich dark malts, chocolate, and coffee. There is a very mild hoppy undertone that creates a certain crispness to the beer.
