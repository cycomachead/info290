Aroma is lightly roasted, chocolate, but both are somewhat muted. Pleasant, but would prefer a stronger presence. Similar in the taste, all the elements are there buy would love them to stand out a little more. Mouthfeel is a touch too thin, almost watery. Finishes dry.

Almost no lace, thin nose offering roasted barley malt and espresso coffee. The taste is thin and hurt by a poor mouthfeel offering burnt coffee beans, dark chocolate covered coffee beans and the hops add an earthy character. This might be good to a newb but not to an experienced stout drinker. Honestly I have been very unimpressed with Saint Arnolds, even their Divine Reserve series has only been beefed up versions of their already crappy beers.","natelocc787","Oct 18, 2009"

For me, it's a little thin in the middle, for a stout it's not a real heavy body at all. Drinkability is helped along by the carbonation.

Mouthfeel was really good with a smooth creamy bite. The aroma was roasted malts with coffee and chocolate but was not very strong overall. The taste was incredibly smooth. It starts with a malty bite that jumps right into a smooth, chocolately finish. This may not be the best tasting stout out there but something about it justs hits the spot perfectly.

For a winter stout, I would like the alcohol to be a little more pronounced, or at least have a warming character. However, this is a tasty beer.","kindestcut","Feb 13, 2005"
3.15,-13,3,3,3.5,2.5,3,"This beer pours a rubied dark brown color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is a mix of coffee, chocolate and a hint of dark fruit. The flavor is coffee bitter, but slightly chocolate sweet on the finish. The feel is not quite as thick as I would like it to be. Just at moderate. This is easy drinking and refreshing, but I want a little less drinkability in my stouts. I want to have it be thick and coating so I sip it more and drink it less. Still, not a bad beer.","kmpitz2","Feb 03, 2005"
3.12,-13.8,2.5,3,3,2.5,4,"Pours a still-translucent dark color, with a tiny creamy tan head. Smell is very light coffee, slight acidity. Taste is very sweet and slightly acidic. Coffee and hoppy, yes, but not the best representation of the style. Flavors need to be bloder, mouthfeel needs to be thicker. A drinkable, almost too approachable stout. Thanks to assurbanipaul for the oppurtunity.","TastyTaste","Dec 26, 2004"

3.65,0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Dark cola colored, which to me equals almost black, but with a dark ruby shade in the light. Head is very thin and light-brown. Aroma is of roasted malts with a hint of coffee. Taste is of a soft roasted flavor with moderate coffee notes. A very mild taste of chocolate is noted too. There is a moderately lingering sweetness. Overall the taste of Saint Arnold Winter Stout isn't quite full enough to be great. Everything seems just a little light here, which may actually increase drinkability. This is a very good beer, but lacks a richness which is needed. Saint Arnold Christmas Ale is a better winter seasonal from this company.","Gagnonsux","Jul 10, 2004"
4.19,15.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"12 oz. bottle. Pours black with a tan head that fades quickly. Strong roasted , toasted grain smell. Taste is toasted malts with a strong , almost astringent coffee flavor ; finishes very dry . Light bodied for a stout. A smooth, easy drinking Texas brew.","beerceller99","Apr 14, 2004"

3.76,3.9,3,4.5,3.5,3,4,"Mouthfeel is a little blah with very little carbonation but the body stands up well, if a little thinner than expected in a stout. I think this beer suffers from it's name -- it's really a winter ale, not fair to compare it to Guinness or Dark Lord. Overall, not a bad winter seasonal.","assurbanipaul","Jan 27, 2004"
3.43,-5.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"This beer is a toffee brown/black, deep garnet highlights before the light. The head is small, brown, fine. There's just a hint of smoke in the roasty, chocolate nose. A touch sickly-sour, too. It starts tangy, with burnt toffee, passing through a thinnish, slightly watery middle to a nice, bitter, smoky finish showing coffee and chocolate. Vegetables (peas?) and burnt wood in the aftertaste. This isn't bad. It gets maltier and chocolatier as it warms.","kbub6f","May 11, 2003"
3.22,-11,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"This beer pours a very deep black with a very very thin head. One of the first things you notice (besides the lack of carbonation) is the sweet chocolate and coffee smells, these smells are also the most noticeable flavors you find while drinking this brew. Lots of roasted malt flavor and dark chocolate. This isn't a bad beer, I just really wish it had a little more carbonation to it, hold the head longer, but overall, not bad. With a few improvements, this could be a really great brew.","usualpulp","Apr 19, 2003"
3.83,5.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability/notes: A very pleasing winter stout, I was fortunate enough to find a bottle of this  apparently it did not receive much distribution in Austin last winter. Alas, its only May and I am already wistful for cold weather and winter brews. And, an aside, what fantastic label art  Saint Arnold outside with a tankard of ale on a snowy, star-lit winter evening and flanked by evergreen boughs dusted with snow. Its not relevant to the beer, but this is my favorite label art.","Pegasus","Mar 26, 2003"
3.42,-5.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Very dark brown, if not black in hue; brunette head, smallish, fair retention, no lace. The nose is inviting, while not potent, there is a perceptible aroma of toasted malts and chocolate. Decent palate, grainy, bitter, much more roasted (contrary of the bouquets invitation), less chocolate, the hops are noticeable. The finish is long-lasting, chalky with sweetness lingering ever so gently... seems to get more acidic as it warms. The body is a touch too thin. Overall, this Stout is drinkable and pleasant, not outstanding but Im glad I had the opportunity to try it thanks Morris729.","bditty187","Mar 01, 2003"

3.12,-13.8,4,2,4,3,2.5,"This is the second time i'm having this stout and it seems a bit different from the first, especially the aroma. A nutty caramel aroma is still there but a stale sour odor dominates it. The heavy roasted malt flavors hold more than their own against the slightly spicy hops. A gentle moderate carbonation gave it a nice mouthfeel but not as smooth as i had remembered. It would be more drinkable if the aroma wasn't so off. Thanks Morris729 for the sample.","paceyourself","Feb 18, 2003"
3.59,-0.8,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Saint Arnold Winter Stout pours with a black body (ruby in the light) with an annoyingly fast-dissipating head, characteristic of all Saint Arnold beers. The nose smells of burnt sugar, sweetened café au lait and Belgian Aromatic malts, the last of which really lends a nice aroma to this beer. Unfortunately, I poured too much of the carbonation out of this beer while trying to raise a head, so the body was a little thinner than I know it to be. The result was that the roasted malts (last time I spoke with Brock Wagner at Saint Arnold, they used no roasted barley in the Stoutchocolate and black malts only) created a slightly astringent, sour flavor in the finish. Other than that, this sweet stout was pretty enjoyable and better than Mackesons (though Saint Arnold uses no lactose)sweet, roasty smooth and uncomplex.","TXHops","Feb 04, 2003"
3.35,-7.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"Nearly black, with clear, deep burgundy hue when held to light. The initially thick head settles readily into a spotty dark tan layer. Sparse foam aggregates remain down the glass. The aroma is comprised of chocolate malt and smooth, mildly smokey roasted grain, with sweetness provided by dark caramel. Trace butterscotch. Chocolate laced, sugary sweetness hits the palate at first, then is briefly superceded by grainy tartness which quickly diminishes. Sweetness reemerges in the form of molasses-tinged brown sugar and couples with the mild chocolate malt undertone, lending token richness. Paltry hop bitterness leaves malt sweetness unhindered. Lightly bodied, passably dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes mostly clean, with a fading impression of powered glucose and cocoa. Not a particularly rich or complex stout, and somewhat one dimensionally sweet. It's cleanliness, stately roasted malt character and lack of flaws lend it good drinkability. A touch too sweet to be a great session stout. Thanks to TXhops for sending the bottle.","marc77","Jan 16, 2003"
3.65,0.8,4,4,4,2.5,3,"Pours a dark brown, perhaps black color with garnet highlights. It produced a small tan head that was very short lived but leaves a nice layer providing a cover for the brew. Light aromas of chocolate and roasted malts smell quite nice. The flavor mirrors the smell with the chocolate being dominant followed by the roasted malt, hops, and finishes with a burnt bitter taste. This beer is too thin IMHO and it finishes just slightly dry. The mouthfeel is the only flaw that I can find but when you are not dissecting a beverage, the mouthfeel can affect the taste as in this case. It is still a pretty decent brew and since its made in Texas, Ill continue to support them. Cheers!","BeerAngel","Jan 06, 2003"
3.27,-9.7,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Not a bad beer at all, and definitely a drinkable and enjoyable one. But if I had to choose a stout, I would definitely go with one of the Young's stouts.","kwill","Dec 27, 2002"
4.2,16,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This is an excellent seasonal stout. With hints of Christmas buried deep within. The hops and malts are blended well to give s surprisingly good finish to this beer. The head is not very creamy and is a brown foam when poured. It settles pretty quick and leaves you wondering what you just got in the way of a stout. The initial taste is surprisingly good and so is the last. An excellent and matured stout that has the harshness taken off by a proper fermentation that is not speed up.","AtrumAnimus","Beers"
3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a very dark, almost black color with a thin tan colored head that quickly dissipates. Nose is dominated by sweet roasted malts and grains with notes of toffee. Dark coffee and bitter chocolate come through in the taste. Not a great stout, but one of the better Texas brewed stouts Ive tried.","Morris729","0"
