Finish is semi bitter and toasty. A lot of flavor with an exceptional dry finish that makes it very drinkable. Well done.","loubar","Mar 26, 2015"

3.38,-2.9,4,3.5,3.25,3,3.5,"I was sold on the idea that this is the first chocolate Stout. I was also sold on the idea that ancient Aztec culture, Montezuma and his chocolate obsession is upon the label associated with this beer. I expected richly, intense flavors of cocoa and that claim of ""Peruvian Coco."" By the label, I was led astray. This is an acceptable stout, not exceptional. Moreover, it is really only a mild Stout, not what now would be considered chocolate according to new craft beer standards. I think what bothers me most is the diluted, almost watery mouth feel. Roasted malts mostly dominate the flavor and aroma of this beer. Meaning, the overpowering roastyness works against its purpose as being chocolatey.  I can see how in '89 this stout may have seemed game changing. But today the stout and it's recipe are due for some improvement. I will not buy this beer again until the flavor and smell can rightly be boasted of in the context of Peru, ancient Aztecs, and Montezuma serving up chocolate in ""goblets of beaten gold.""","everyman","Feb 26, 2015"

Flavors are roast forward, with a blend of cocoa and baker's chocolate forward, with a bitter undertone and creamy highlights that help to keep the palate balanced. Roast and bitter aftertaste.

3.65,4.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had this bottle sitting around for quite some time so time to give it a try. The color is pretty much solid black. The light brown head is near two fingers high and leaves generous lacing. The nose includes a very nice, deep nutty malt with milk chocolate sweetness. I get some sweet herbal hop and light charcoal-coffee. Very nice by my senses. The first taste brings a fairly tart citrus-grass bite quickly followed by decided charcoal and subtle chocolate. This is medium bodied with a pretty aqueous feel with a chalky edge. It has modest, but adequate carbonation. The flavor leans a little too close to ash tray at times but generally is fine and provides a somewhat bitter malt brew with a chocolate kiss. Not overly sweet, reasonably drinkable if you enjoy the style. Definitely worth trying.","Durge","Nov 26, 2012"

The flavor disappoints after this, with the dryness of the dark chocolate coming through, but not all that much of the actual chocolate flavor. Some modest roast character in the background.

The organic stamp since 1989 shouldn't be an excuse for lack of taste. As it warms there is a very minor amount of hop character in the nose and some coffee character reveals itself in both the nose and taste. After letting this beer warm up well beyond ideal serving temp (while I contemplated pouring it down the drain) I went back in for one last smell an taste and noted just a bit of dark fruitiness.

Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin, but a nice smooth finish keeps this category at par. Fantastic flavors are present. Roasted and coffee malt are clearly detectable soon followed by a perfectly blended chocolate taste. Cocoa is added to the mash when this is brewed which is clearly evident.

It is labeled as a chocolate stout and the chocolate should be the strongest taste in this beer but it isn't (in my opinion). There's both sweet and bitter in this brew, and it does have a bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with average carbonation. It's a bit thin, but not quite watery. Drinkability is decent, it's not hard to drink. Overall it's a decent brew, I'd drink it again but I wouldn't make it a point to seek this one out either.","bluejacket74","May 24, 2008"

Aromatics full of roasted dark chocolate and pseudo coffee notes from the dark roasted malt profile utilized here. Doesn't smell any more chocolate than any other stout but I guess they did add some Danish cocoa, according to the label. Light, herbal, friendly hop profile with creamy milk chocolate in the finish. Flavor brings it altogether seems light and airy in texture but the flavor rides a nice wave over the palate with mildly brash dark roasts finishing into a creamy milk chocolate crescendo, staying semi bitter sweet without going candy on me. Some may ask for more chocolate sweetness I'm cool with the cocoa addition to the boil with just the subtle flow going on and definitely more bitterness from the darker roasts rather than from hops which are evident but more light and herbal than anything else. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but texture wise creamy almost nitro draft feel to it, bitter dry finish with a touch of chocolate sweetness, carbonation is subtle and smooth on the palate finishes with the dark roasted malt bitterness lingering the way it should.

The first time I poured it, this mocha head of foam came out of nowhere and made the mug look like an erupting volcano of black beer. After it overflowed the glass, it looked like the mug was leaking oil all over the place. After it settled, I tried to pour it a second time and it did it again. So after it settled down for the second time, I poured the beer a third time and it didn't do it again. I finally got the entire bottle into the glass and it only took three tries. It had a rich aroma of old dark chocolate, roasted chocolate malt, a hint of chocolate covered cherries, and a pinch of chocolate covered hops at the end. The taste was a lot like the aroma, but it had a few subtle differences. It tasted like a bar of dark chocolate was infused with chocolate malt, chocolate covered hops, and with a pinch of chocolate covered cherries. It wasn't just one taste after another, it was just one big organic chocolate punch to the tastebuds. It was medium bodied with an aftertaste of a watered down Hershey's milk chocolate bar with a dash of bitter hops added into the mix. It was just an OK beer and probably is the best organic beer I've had. If you love drinking organic alcoholic chocolate, then by all means, try this one.","AltBock","Feb 24, 2007"

Most captivating is the taste, with a thick smokiness that lingers in the mouth and comines with the dark-roasted coffee flavors, roasted almonds, and of course the dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is again, a bit watery for a stout, but well-balanced in carbonation but lacked the creaminess I was hoping for. If this was a bit thicker it would do wonders for the mouthfeel, appearance, and boost the already great taste.

Very chalky cocoa fore followed by some roasty malt and an admirably bitter finish though it is a tad watery. But, something just doesnt work for me here. Its just forced feeling and while I like the individual tastes there is something about the total effect i dont like.","Jredner","Jan 15, 2006"
4.94,42,4,5,5,5,5,"22oz. bottle poured into pint glass. Deep black color, like motor oil, only not as thick. Nice creamy, frothy head. Aroma exploding with chocolate and roasted malts. Like a nice double mocha from my favorite coffee shop (Tinys). As soon as I put the glass up to my mouth, it and my nose are filled with chocolate. But not dark chocolate, rich coco powder. One part Nestle Quick, one part Godiva. Full chewy body, mouth-coating feeling is wiped clean be a balanced carbonation level. This beer kept its flavor in my mouth for for a long time after each drink. It was a rich flavor of a dark chocolate truffle rolled in coco powder, then washed down with a shot of esspresso. Highly recommend this beer. Lost a point due to the fact that there were some chunks floating in my glass after the pour. Wow, what a beer!","imrichbeeeatch","Beers"

Palate is rich roasted malt, dark chocolate, some bittering hops, and some anise and licorice on the finish. Body is a little thin for a stout, but creamy nonetheless and leading to a nice dry finish. Doesn't pair as well with a chocolate orange as I would have hoped. Not particularly special.","ElGordo","0"

The aroma has a big coffee character, roasted malt, dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, and some floral hops. The flavor starts off with expresso, blackstrap molasses, roasted malt, floral hops, and some dutch cocoa in the finish as well as some mild warming alcohol. Pretty good stout, would have thought it was better if they hadnt specifically labeled it a ""chocolate stout", as it doesnt have much of a chocolate character. Mouthfeel is full and rich, and drinkability is ok. Dont buy this if you are looking for a big chocolate character (go with rogue chocolate stout or sam adams chocolate bock), but its a good american stout overall.","silver0rlead","Nov 03, 2005"

I saw no freshness or drink by date for this one, but it did have a big sticker advertising its ""certified organic."" The beer poured a deep, dark brown/black with a foamy, finger or so of head. The beer's aroma hinted at a chocolate flavor, and the beer came through in a big, albeit not overpowering or sweet way. The beer's flavors were of a good coffee flavor with a good chocolate finish. A beer with a thinner mouthfeel than I would have expected, although it can slide I had looked for something slightly more substantial. All and all though, something pretty solid. I've had a few ""organic"" American, craft beers before and had been pretty dissapointed with the entire experience with most of them up until this point. A good find.","edmundfitzoil","Sep 01, 2005"

There is a coffee taste hidden behind the strong chocolate taste. This beer is full bodied and sweet. It leaves a chocolate taste on the palate. This beer might not make a good session beer because it is too rich. It is very good, but the richness of it will get to be too much. This beer is definately worth a try.","OStrungT","Dec 21, 2004"

The beer has quite a bite to it, not sweet and buttery and chocolatey as you might expect. Rather, it tastes of unsweetened baker's cocoa powder, not too far from mocha or even espresso. It's a bitter stout with ample hops whose herbalness marries pretty well with the cocoa to obscure the sweet roastiness of the malts. It's good, not great, and leaves an unpleasant chalky bitterness on the tongue.","Thrasher","Oct 20, 2004"

Big roasty start to the flavor, too, with a malty middle that grows more assertive as the beer sits. Very light bitterness to the finish with a light cocoa flavor in the aftertaste. On the whole, I'm just not happy with the way this beer finishes. At first it seemed to end too quickly, with not much going on on the back of the tongue. This got better as the beer warmed, but then it got *worse* as the beer seemed to leave a bit of a harsh, off taste in its wake.
