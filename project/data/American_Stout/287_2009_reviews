"Flavor is modestly roasty and very chocolatey at first, finishing lightly bitter and rye dominant. There's some dark fruit notes that add complexity."

"This beer was very comforting. Started out with a strong flat cola taste (I find this to be positive), and finshed with a bunch of roasted coffee."

"Overall: a extremely drinkable and tasty stout. probably one of the more flavorful non-imperials I have had in a while. The flavors all blend together really nicely."

"O-decent stout with a little rye flavor, smooth drinking"

"Draft at Bells. Pours dark brown/black with minimal head. Aroma is distinctive rye grain, citrus fruits. Taste is big hit of citrus, rye, smokey tones. Rye is the star and comes out nicely balanced. Delicious. This is trendy these days but Bells was out ahead of the curve and has produced another good variant here."

"Overall this is a pretty solid beer. The flavors are all subtle which is both good and bad. It makes for an easy to drink beer. Problem is the finish is weak and I can't pinpoint any outstanding qualities. Pretty nice beer and worth checking out."

"Seems like more of a milk/sweet stout than a regular stout. I would've liked the rye to play a more prominent part, but overall it was a pretty tasty beer."
"M -Medium body. Light carbonation."

"For a Bell's stout (cherry, expedition etc. . . ) it was below average, but easily above average for every other stout out there. Enjoyable and would drink again. I think the next bottle I'll drink as my first beer of the day to try and get a better grasp on the rye aspect."

"O: Decent beer. Enjoyed the opportunity to try this. At $3 for 4oz I would probably skip it next time."

"Overall, I wouldn't have guessed there was rye in this, but it's a fairly tasty stout from Bell's."
""
"Overall, decent offering from Bell's. Enjoyable stout with impressive profiles all around."

"Fuller medium body, slightly higher carbonation, dry and sticky on the tongue. A nice hybrid between the stout and rye qualities - something I'd definitely drink again."

"O- It's decent. Creative too. I probably wouldn't revisit, but doesn't mean you shouldn't"
"Had a pint at the Bell's Cafe. I enjoyed the earthy, roasted character, but overall the stout was just a little too thick and sweet for my liking. This is a pretty big, thick stout, but didn't have the complexity I'd want from a higher-ABV American stout."
"O-good beer. Would like to try again"
"poured a semi-translucent black with a cap of tan foam that disappeared quickly. Smell was roasted malt and a bit of earthy spice. Taste follows with more roasted malt, semi-sweet dark chocolates, earthy spice. Full-bodied with decent carbonation. Overall impression is richness but lighter than many typical stouts."
"Overall: I really liked this stout. The rye was there, but it complimented the other flavors and didn't take over. I would definitely have another."
"2009 Bottle, Batch 9370 - Thanks mibirder! - Pours an opaque dk brown with a large tan head...aroma is roasty and woody, cocoa and plum, with a pronounced graininess...flavour is similar, sweet caramel malt, coffee, a great amount of rye taste without becoming one dimensional, finish is somehow a lingering char bitterness, but the mouthfeel is completely sweet...odd brew that I completely enjoyed!"
"Overall: I enjoyed the experiment with rye, but I think that it doesn't really impart too much in the way of flavor, and I came up thinking that the stout could have used a bit more in that department. This would be a very interesting beer to barrel-age or flavor with wood. As it is, it's easy to drink, but was left a bit cold by it. Possibly because all the brews at their cafe were served extremely cold..."
"O- The rye makes it different, but that's about it for this beer. Thought it was good but wouldn't seek it out again."
"Found this one to be pretty interesting. This beer pours out like most stouts do with a deep black color and brown head. The lacing was pretty good on this one. The smell of the beer had a deep roasted aroma and had a pretty good amount of rye on the nose. The taste had an impressive amount of spicy rye too. The mouthful was at a good thickness, overall I enjoyed this stout quite a bit."
"I'm a big fan of rye beers, so I was very pleased to see this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. It's easy enough to find a rye ipa or lighter beer, much harder to find a rye stout. I really enjoyed this quite a bit. Poured dark brown, approaching black, with a creamy head. Smells of spicy rye balanced beatifully with some firm malt and some roastiness. Tastes similar- and very nice. Lovely gobs of spicy rye supported by lightly roasty malt and a huge creaminess. The rye really shines here and isn't overwhelmed by charred notes. Great beer."
"Black pour with little head, unpleasantly reminiscent of blended black and tans. The flavors are lacking in coffee notes but almost compensates with nice toasted malt flavors. The smooth dry finish is a high note for this blandish understated stout. While the carobonation is nice and the brew is smooth it lacks the creaminess expected. Overall, eh."
"O (D) - A very solid, fairly interesting stout. A good drink."
"This is a good beer, though Bell's for me has always been top-notch to this point. Still, I'd drink this again for sure."
"D: Just not very impressed..."
"This was my first Bells and I was impressed. I was told this isnt even one of Bells best so I cannot wait to try their other concoctions. I really enjoyed this beer and would definitely drink it again."
"I expected more from a stout from Bell's overall was a great stout that I would recommend."
"Overall, this was not bad; however, it was a little underwhelming for me. I expect everything from bell's to really push through and hammer down styles; I was just not so sure this one was really that big of a winner. Definitely worth a try, no doubt, just not as big as I hoped it would be."
"Bell's Rye Stout pours a dark brown with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Coffee and chocolate are apparent in the nose and flavor, toffee also strikes me in the flavor. Definitely a decent brew, but pales in comparison to other Bell's stouts. Still, it's better than a lot of other breweries efforts."
"D-super easy to drink.. really like the unique taste... can't really pin point it. But like it.. will get this again!"
"Cheers!"
"Reviewed on 5/20/2010. Bottle thanks to Tsotsi. Pours a dark brown with a small light tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, a touch of coffee, sweet malt. Flavor of sweet roasted malt with a touch of spice although I can't really say that the rye is very prominent. Pretty tasty overall (although I was hoping for just a little more)."
"Beer is medium bodied and finishes drier than it probably should. There is a ghost of an aftertaste of smoke, subtle smoke that creeps in from the back of the beer. The forward is mildly rye flavored with a little barley sweetness. The roast character in this supposed stout is completely absent."
"D: session all over this one. Very tasty brew"
"Tasteful and traditional, it went nicely with an appetizer of wine-pickled herring."
"The stout is a dark brown ale with a moderate sized head that retains nicely. The aroma coming off of the stout is chocolatey roasted malts and a bit of rye spiciness. The stout has a very sweet chocolatey caramel flavor, clearly the result of a pleasant malt mixture. The flavors meld together seamlessly, allowing the stout character and a bit of rye sharpness to come together nicelessly. The rye sharpness is a nice undertone that keeps the stout together. The velvety smooth stout is a joy to drink, chocolatey yet silky smooth. A delicious ale. The ale is smooth and sweet, delicious without going overboard on the roasted malt element."
"Bell's really knows how to do a stout. Not my favorite from them, but very solid."
"Overall I had higher hopes for this beer however I found the rye influence to be more muted than I would have liked. Still, an easy drinking beer with a good deal of complexity that's worth a shot."
"D - Very good. I had to fight the urge to drink this beer quicker than I did (which is often true anyway), but savoring it was well worth the effort."
"Overall, a really solid stout that I enjoyed very much. Highly recommend. Would love to try a fresher one as well to compare. Not avail here in TX so shipped back from my Indy trip. Rotation - this is an occasional release but I'd get a sixer or two per release if I lived where available. For now, I'd definitely get more to ship back during trips to the folks. Also would get a 6 to drink while in Indy. [R;Y;ship]"
"Rye Stout is easily drinkable & enjoyable. It's solid, too - I just wish the rye was cranked up several notches. I'll have to give a fresh bottle a go sometime to see if that's the issue."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, good kick, good representation of the ""rye stout"" sub-style, this is a good beer to drink when you want something that's a bit different than you're normal stout."
"D: Not the most rye beer I've had, making it more approachable and a good learning beer for a person just getting into rye."
"D: Okay, but I had much higher expectations."
"i'm not sure if they followed my advice after my last review (bottle) or if it's just that much better out of the tap or if my palate changed...i enjoyed this much more than i have before (and i tasted it from a tap at a bar in chi recently and i think my thoughts then were what my past review in 6/07 reflected)"
"Very easy drinker for ~7%."
"Drinkability - For a rye stout, it's pretty drinkable, thanks in large part to the lightness and the coffee, which blends the alcohol into the background quite effortlessly. The slight sweetness makes it that much easier to open another bottle."
"D - Ya don't believe I will be having this again, just unremarkable overall, sorry Bell's!"
"D- This is my first rye stout. I really enjoyed this one and would come back to it again. Super easy to drink and a great amount of flavour going on here."
"Pours a dark black that doesn't appear to be too viscous. A pretty decent-sized medium brown head. Plenty of rye and roasted malt in the nose. Flavor is similar along with a little bit of coffee. Medium to full body with good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty high. Good take on the rye beer category; one of the more unique ones I've had within the style."
"The flavor finds spicy rye grains battling it out with roasted milk chocolate malts. Earthy, soily hops grab hold of the tastebuds and provide a lasting bitterness. The carbonation was really a sleeper, and it fired up after the pour to lash the palate with spritzy, sharp bubbles on into the finish. Rye eventually pushes out the rest of the malt, unfortunately, because I think the base for this beer is probably delicious. Still, Rye Stout is tasty, and I applaud Bell's for the ingenuity. (again) It helps that I love rye. Pick this up and give it a try."
"the light body and high carbonation levels. The finish loses the harshness but the tartness continues as it fades quickly with some lingering sweetness."
"D: I really liked this beer. Something quite a bit different. Would drink this again."
"It is a very drinable beer and a great stout but I would like to see a little more flavor from the rye when it comes to something that has rye in the name."
"Drinkability and mouthfeel: Very good stout, not too heavy but carries enough of a presence to fill you up. Might need a little more carbonation but overall a very drinkable beer."
"The smokiness and roasted flavor make it good tasting, however, the strong flavor hinders the drinkability."
"Overall, I don't dislike the beer, but it's definitely one of the least remarkable of the Dark Side case. I found it to lack the complexity of the Expedition or the Third Coast, though I understand that they are different styles of stout. I guess they can't all be first place winners, and it's not my least favorite in the case either."
"The stout pours near black with a bit of a garnet hue when held to the light. The moderate fluffy tan head diminished to a skin with just a hint of a lace. The aroma is moderately roasty along with some hints of chocolate. The flavor is moderate-high malt, bittersweet upfront followed by roast and chocolate. The roast character of the malt, hop bitterness and maybe rye give a spicy, slightly dry finish that is pleasant and leaves just a bit of bittersweet malt on the palate. Carbonation is moderate and body medium. Overall well crafted stout, rather drinkable yet a lot of flavor. Maybe a bit less roast than most stouts and more bittersweet malt with a spicy/slightly dry finish."
"This beer suffers a bit on drinkability. It does sort of overwhelm you after awhile. Drinking more than one 12oz bottle would be tough. A solid offering overall though."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer and I would venture to say that this wouldn't be a stretch for your Guinness drinkers. Overall, no one quality is overpowering."
"Enjoyable, and a unique twist on a stout, but not the best option - rye has been done better."
"O- A good stout- not a lot of rye but worth getting a sixer of."
"D - This is a very good stout. The rye added a sweetness to a bitter stout."
"D: Nice, big roasty flavors dominate. Bready, smokey and tasty as all hell, though a bit of a sipper. Still damn fine brew."
"drinkability is good - any lower abv stout with this much flavor is a winner in my book"
"A little too carbonated off the bat but once I got to the end of the glass it felt just perfect. the roasted malts are a little too sharp for an excellent drinkability"
"Bottle: Poured a deep pitch-black color stout with a small dark brown foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with light peat notes. Taste is very particular with some good peat notes and deep roasted malt. Body is quite full with a very nice creamy texture and good carbonation. Very singular since I am not used to rye being used in a stout but still very interesting."
"Mouthfeel is coating as each swallow glides down my throat. There must be some oatmeal in there to make it so creamy. Carbonation is a little too crisp while cold. Let it warm up a little and it expands in it's chewiness. This is not like any stout I've ever had and it's fantastic."
"D- I need to find a six pack of this because it opened my eyes being that there are not a lot of rye stout's out there, this moved me. I also want to see if there is any difference in appearence vs. the kegged version. This is easy drinking and probably my favorite of Bell's lower ABV 'dark beer' offerings. Will have again."
"D_A well done beer by Bell's and an interesting way to do a stout. I could go with a little more rye but I would imagine that is hard to pull off with the bold roasted malt presence."
"Growler purchased from Liquor Barn, Louisville, KY (Springhurst). Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and rye. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but with the addition of some dark fruit and a little bit of licorice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. I think this is a good overall brew, and a great beer for a cold winter day. I'd definitely buy this again."
"D - I like it. I could have another I think but again, my lack of experience in the rye area doesn't allow me much insight into the exact uniqueness of this over, say, Bell's Java Stout."
"Drinkability: A rye stout is an interesting concept, and this is good, but it's not quite up to the standards of most Bell's beer. Definitely worth a try for fans of Bell's or those who love rye, but a bit lacking for my palate."
"D decently drinkable, smooth, a little heavy though and will fill you up."
"D - This is a seriously tasty stout - Bell's is a master w/ so many great tasting stouts. This is one of the best they make as the rye addition is not overdone, just enough to compliment the caramel and dark malt flavor. The smokiness adds complexity-truly drinkable"
"Overall, this is a pretty enjoyable stout with any glaring weaknesses and is very drinkable."
"Overall, I initially questioned this brew. I was so wrong and will never, ever question a brew from Bells again. High drinkability, very manageable ABV and tastes great."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer on top of all the roasted malt characteristics. It is pretty easy drinking. The cocoa in the aroma is awesome. I am glad that they brought this one back."
"D- This is a solid offering from bell's. The rye brings a nice bready quality to the stout as well as accentuates the roasted malt and barley characteristics of the brew. Bell's offers a solid lineup-but I still have not found a Bell's brew that really WOWs me."
"pours a dark black cherry color with a quick dissipating head it does have some clinging sticky lacing..the smell was toffee and fig some caramel and rye..the taste was rye and spice with chocolate and some roasted coffee this is one good stout that may be overlooked..i like the addition of rye to this style..its sweet and robust a well balanced stout that is highly drinkable from a brewery that puts out lots of stouts..another fine one from bells"
"This is good but a bit thin for me. Tasty beer overall, though, should be a Bells staple for every winter."
"Have to thank Grumpy for sending me this one off of my wants list. Poured a deep reddish brown with a thin white head. Chocolate and lightly roasted malts in the nose with a touch of rye. Taste was nice and simple. Chocolate, roasted malts and some rye all perfectly balanced, each flavor complimenting the next. Although the head wasn't too impressive the carbonation was present in the mouthfeel, which added nicely to the beer. Very smooth and super drinkable, medium to full body, this beer doesn't try to overwhelm you with flavors, it just uses each flavor extremely well. I really enjoyed this beer, I had high hopes and it did not disappoint. Hope to get more soon."
"D: Very drinkable and delicious; alcohol is well masked and this is quite drinkable"
"D- Quite good, I could have several of these over the course of a night. Very balanced and I'm quite pleased to discover it."
"Rather fair drinkability. Big and flavorful, this beer is worthy of a good session in the winter months."
"Medium bodied and quite soft; very quaffable. The rye seems to work well with this beer. Whereas most rye beers seem to be hoppier expressions where the hops overpower the rye, here the rye has a chance to express itself. Well done, Bell's."
"Thin tan head,but it has decent retention. The body is pretty much black. Only a little bit of brown shines through the edges of the glass. Chocolatey sweet flavors combo nicely with the rye. Bit of a smokey quality to this. Really rich and luxurious stuff. Once again, Bell's has made an outstanding stout."
"Not bad, an average stout. I was not sure what to expect with a rye stout, but there is not much rye from what I can detect. It is still worth a try."
"The beer is poured a black to brown color, with a small tan to light caramel colored head on top. The deep chocolate and coffee aromas come out at first scent. There is a slight fragrance of dark bread and rye to finish each scent. The dark malt dominates the palate at the beginning with chocolate and dark bread roll across the palate. There is a hint of coffee as well. It finishes with a touch of rye sharpness and a mild pine flavor that lingers shortly, then fading away. The feel is hearty, a milky texture at the start then gradually thinning, leaving a medium dryness. This is a very drinkable stout, a pleasing color, strong aroma and flavor, along with the rich feel, make this a beer to crave each taste."
"This is a very drinkable stout...a little on the light side, but that makes it easy to throw a few back!"
"12oz bottle from a sixer purchased in Detroit in December 2009. The beer is nearly opaque, dark burnt reddish brown, thin tan foam. The aroma is NICE! Roasted malts, chocolate, a nice dose of rye, just brilliant. The taste is no slouch either, roasted but not overly bitter, some rye spiciness that contrasts the dark malts, possibly some wheat but it's hard to tell through all the other rich flavors. Thick and creamy mouthfeel, maybe some oatmeal was added? Seems like Bell's pulled all stops on this one, outstanding and delicious. Needs to be a standard beer."
"A very sessionable stout from Bell's. Not great, but very solid."
"Notes: Maybe not outstanding, and surely for my liking I would be expecting a far more assertive rye profile, and still leves me wondering what a stout like that would be like. Here it works on a rather subtle, and balanced side, giving a decent and fairly likeable stout."
"D- Pretty easy drinking considering it's close to 7%. It was interesting in that I haven't had a ton of beers with a rye component. I'll be sure to try others and probably come back to this one."
"A very solid winter stout. I can't really find much wrong with this."
"Despite a lackluster nose, this ultimately emerges as an enjoyable, drinkable stout, given a bit of a twist thanks to the rye. Not a huge wallop of godliness, but certainly not a purchase to be sad about (that poor thing on the label must not have had enough money to purchase a bottle. Cheer up you!)."
"Drinkability is great and leaves me desireing more then this one bottle."
"Fizzy for the style, but a good heavy feel. Very easy drinker for a stout, good fullness for the abv. Overall, of their 6 stouts this one is just OK."
"D: It had high drinkability. I could have kept drinking this one."
"Drinkability- I really enjoy this beer quite a bit. The rye isn't overdone and mixes with the stout body surprisingly well. It's very quaffable and just what the doctor ordered. Now if it just had a tinge more body this thing would be a homerun."
"D- Very complex and exciting, and yet very drinkable. Perfect for a slow session where one drinks two or three over a period of four or five hours, like a movie or a night of chatting."
"D - This started off as a nice stout and it really could have finished as a good stout...but the addition of the rye kind of knocked it down for me...I like both stouts and rye beers but this combination just didn't work for me...it was just an okay beer"
"Overall, this is a fairly easy beer to drink but mostly because there is a lack of intensity, but solid components. Fairly good but I would have preferred more kick to this beer."
"My hopes were high because 1.) Bell's typically makes good stouts and 2.) I love rye beers. The rye is, very unfortunately, a minor player in this stout. This should have been an imperial stout, as more body (and more rye) would have made for an improved product. As is this beer is too expensive for a normal-ass stout."
"D- An interesting brew that was different but quite nice."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Batch 9399. Bottle conditioned. Poured a dark brown/black with a thin tan head. Chocolate malt and a little coffee in the aroma. Medium bodied with a rich and creamy mouthfeel. More chocolate malt in the flavor, a bit of malt sweetness. Long dry malty finish with lingering flavor of chocolate (again). Interesting beer, almost to the cream stout side, not a lot of roasted barley flavor."
"It is an ""above average"" Rye Stout. A solid ""B""
"Drinkability: this was all right. much prefer their other stouts."
"D- Pint went down smooth and clean. Left me satisfied and slightly full yet I could easily session a few of these."
"D: Okay, but I wouldn't order again or buy a sixer. Won't be hard to finish the pint though."
"Notes: good, easy-drinking stout. not as chewy or even as flavorful as most but an excellent variation on the style"
"Drinkability: I found this a nicely drinkable beer that I could have more than one of with no trouble at all. I enjoyed each sip, wanted more and was disappointed when it was finished. While I'll not go out of my way to track this beer down, I'll be happy to drink this one again the next time we cross paths."
"Drinkability is good - tasty and well put together, just different enough to have an identity while not going too extreme in any one direction."
"D - This is a good stout. The rye adds a new, interesting taste to the stout. The chocolatiness off this stout makes it enjoyable and easy to drink. I am glad I picked this up, however I like some of Bell's other stout offerings more than this."
"An interesting stout, but not quite as unique/intense as I had thought it would be. Thought the rye would add more to this stout than it did. Overall very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This beer improved vastly as it warmed, but it's still lacking a little something that makes Bell's beer great. Of all their stouts, it doesn't really stand out (give me the Kalamazoo or, hell, please, the Expedition), though it isn't necessarily a bad beer, and at 6.7% is certainly not ""undrinkable."" Give it a shot if you feel so inclined, though I'm hesitant to recommend."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark opaque black. Smell is faint but sweet.. some hints of oatmeal and grain. Taste is light and sweet.. some hints of vanilla and oatmeal. Fairly light in complexity and strength for a stout, with medium mouthfeel and almost no alcohol presence. Very drinkable and pretty much a sessionable stout, but not very exciting."
"On tap at Paridiso in Georgetown. Dark brown appearance with a small head that disappeared quickly. Almost no lacing as I drank it. Aroma is good with caramel coffee tones and the rye as a nice addition. Very good taste, all the roasty chocolate and coffee flavors go well with the rye flavor. Very drinkable, could have a few of these."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, bitter, sweet, and...a bit weird. I'm really on the fence with the whole thing. The beer screams that it wants to be toasty but it's not. It's dry from the rye."
"D - Great stout with a dominating spicy rye presence and plenty of hop bitterness. I'm a big fan of rye beers, and the addition of the rye really complements the stout attributes quite nicely."
"I found this to be quite good. The head was nice and dense, leaving nice lace behind. The color, when the glass was tipped, was as expected: a deep orange-red fading into the darkest brown. The aroma was a nice combination of rye malt and dark malts, though I didn't detect the roastiness I usually associate with stouts. I wanted the flavor to have a touch more rye character, which I could detect but thought was overshadowed by the dark malts (mostly chocolate malt?), but not drowned out. Overall very good."
"Slightly viscous medium body with a nice balance of roasted malt and sweet caramel and rye malt notes. Hints of toffee, roasted coffee bean and hazelnut with a nice hoppy dry finish. Very nicely balanced with subtle alcohol heat. Very drinkable with lots of silky chocolate malt and sweet ruye notes balancing out the roasted notes and alcohol heat."
"D - Very nice. I wasn't sure what to expect, though I was worried that rye would be poorly suited to the style. As it turns out, the rye blends in well - enough so you notice it's there, but not so much that it overpowers the rest of the beer. This stout is definitely worth a try - I'll be sure to seek it out each year when it's released."
"On drinkability, however, I'm tempted to buy another sixer and invite some friends over to celebrate the end of my student teaching. I think this is a great beer- just not measured in the right style!"
"M-pretty smooth and slightly creamy with a fair amount of carbonation, which was a turnoff."
"On-tap at Busy Bee served in a standard pint glass a nice opaque black with a decent khaki head that slowly diminishes to a ring and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is exactly what I expected, roasted malts and rye. The taste is an interesting blend of roasted malts and rye, complementing themselves nicely alongside slight espresso and bitter cocoa. The beer is medium bodied with mild carbonation. This is a very enjoyable brew."
"What is up with this beer? For something so dark, it lacks flavor and body. Has a deep black color but not much head forms. A thin layer of tan bubbles lingers on the surface. The aroma is weak. A touch of roasted malt with hints of bitter chocolate and coffee. I am hard pressed to find any rye charactor in the aroma or flavor. Weak malt flavor. Slight roasted characteristics. Bitterness is low. Some fruitiness from the yeast. The body is thin for a stout, it would be thin for a straight porter. This beer needs more, more roasted malt, more rye. Very disappointed in this beer."
"(D)- A good stout with a good balance to it. I wonder how much rye they added to this, cause it is seriously potent in that regard. Not Bell's best effort though."
"Overall I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again. The rye doesn't contribute much, if any, character, but I won't hold that against it because the beer is still very enjoyable."
"Pizzaria Paradiso/$6/Pint"
"Black body with no head or lacing. Smell is typical stout roastiness with detectable rye notes. Taste is chocolatey and roasty with the rye bringing an extra dimension, adding both sweetness and tartness. Finishes sweet. Rather bready mouthfeel. This is definitely a good change-of-pace stout. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Very light and easy drinking Stout despite the 6.7% abv. However, it is also a little light on flavor. Mostly seems like a tamer version of their Kalamazoo Stout."
"D- For the style and richness of flavors, this goes down rather easily. A unique beer that is worth a try."
"It's a very balanced beer overall with an obvious, great rye flavor; not as oily or heavy as some stouts as well. A fine offering and certainly worth a go."
"D: I'm not a huge rye fan, but this beer is still quite drinkable."
"Poured a deep brown with red highlights and a tiny head that disappeared completely. The aroma was a freshly opened can of roasted coffee. The taste was malty sweet with coffee and a little chocolate. The feel was full bodied with a surprising amount of carbonation, considering the lack of head. Drinkability was good. A very enjoyable beer. It had a different quality in it's flavor that I couldn't quite describe, so I'll just have to chalk it up to the rye influence."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is medium. Very nice mouthfeel. Drinkability is good for the style, easy drinking, very tasty."
"D= A damn fine stout! Sort of reminded me of Kalamazoo Stout with less licorice and with the addition of rye. In any event, it is a great beer I will definitely buy more of!"
"This poured an opaque black with tan head. It smelled like roasted coffee and dark chocolate with some earthy rye malt. It tasted like roasted coffee and bitter chocolate with cream and rye. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a mellow bitter aftertaste. Overall this is another solid stout from Bells. It had a nice smell and taste that was like Kalamazoo with a twist. I'd love to try those side by side. Great body (as always from Bells) and very easy to drink. This beer won't blow your mind, but it's still very enjoyable. Definitely recommended."
"D- It's a nice drinker. Bell's always seems to do well with their stouts, so I set the bar pretty high. It's very solid, but I wasn't blown away. I'd like to see them showcase the rye a little more."
"D: Not a bad brew overall and worth a try for something different. I do like Bell's other stouts quite a bit more though."
"I pored this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a nice dark color and the beer had a nice tan head. I really liked this beer as it was grainy in the sense of like oats,not gritty grainy. I like this Bells product and hope they keep making it."
"Drinkability: I like it because i can taste the rye in this rye beer. I also love the hints of smoke. This is a winner from Bells, but I do think that two in a sitting is the most I could do."
"This beer is all right...tastes kind of like a milk stout, actually. I picked up a single bottle, and that works for now."
"Flying Saucer Charlotte. Deep brown pour, not really all that thick in appearance. Some nice off white head. Aroma of roast malt, light chocolate and roast nut. Definetely has that rye mouthfeel, add nice body to it. Being on tap attenuates the carbonation I could see this having in bottle form. Not very aggressive with the roast, some oat, rye and bakers chocolate with a good dose of peaty nut. I liked, a good change of pace stout. Somewhere between a stout, porter and nut brown. Interesting and very drinkable. Would recommend anyone to give it a try."
"Nice to pick up a few bottles of this from Archer Liquors. Haven't had it in probably 4 years. Pours translucent brown with tan head. Smells and tastes of sweet roasted malt and what I suppose is rye. (I've had rye bread many a time and this doesn't taste like rye bread. Not that I expected it, but based on a review saying pumpernickel is present, I wondered....) Body is medium with medium/high carbonation - typically spot on Bells. Very sessionable stout."
"Taste begins with a wonderful bready flavor, like pumpernickel, rye. Bitter cocoa and coffee, more subdued here than in the nose. Reminds me of chicory on the finish. Mouthfeel is where this beer loses me a touch. Medium bodied, but could stand to be a bit more stout. A little to thin on the tongue. Moderate carbonation, active but non-obtrusive. Drinkability is pretty good. Could easily kick back a few pints on a cold evening."
"Overall I'm impressed with this one, wasn't expecting much I guess. A highly drinkable brew that I could easily see myself buying more of"
"Dark brown body accompanied by a tan head that quickly fades to absolutely nothing. No lace, no thin layer of foam, just dark beer in the glass. Aroma sort of has an odd meatiness to it. Smells more like a cured sausage than a beer. I'm getting hungry and craving salami-laden anti-pasto. Flavor has a very sharp rye flavor - like I'm eating that salami on rye bread. There's a slight off-note on the finish as well. A slight chocolaty component creeps in after several sips, and then fades back to a smoky lingering note. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Drinkability- it's rough to finish this. SO many funky flavors, seems like several beers combined in one. One of the few Bells' beers I'm not fond of."
"Good brew. Enjoying this one, but am going to let the other bottle rest in the cellar for a few months to see if the pieces come together a bit more coherently."
"A nice and easy to drink stout. Nearly sessionable. I haven't had a rye beer that I haven't liked and I think it's a great addition to a stout."
"D Fair to good as this is a nice stout. 4.0"
"Not bad, but not particularly noteworthy either. I expected more from a brewery who already has several stouts on the market."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with a decent bite of carbonation."
"D- the rye makes for a nice twist on this style. enjoyable and somewhat sessionable. glad this one is back this year, as we didnt get it here last year."
"Stout? Porter? Stout porter? Whatever, either way this beer is tasty and really easy to put down. Thanks Larry!"
"Drinks very easy. I will admit I am underwhelmed, probably due to high expectations I have when it comes to a stout from Bell's. Good brew just not what expected. Would definitely drink again."
"Overall, I'm glad they started bottling this again."
"drinkability is high with lowish abv, great flavor, and mouthfeel.really an excellent beer."
"D: This is a wonderful and highly drinkable stout. It has all of the roasted flavors I look for in a stout and the rye really works well here. I will have to drink this stuff up while it's around. This beer has definitely piqued my interest in rye stouts. Perhaps I will try to brew one of my own!"
"Taste-Coffee and toffee, chocolate, and definite, although subtle, rye spiciness that adds a nice twist to this brew. A dry, black coffee finish, with some lingering spice and some hop notes as well. A fine Autumn offering from the boys at Bell's."
"Drinkability: Pretty high - I'm really impressed by the balance of so many distinct flavors and the smoothness of the feel."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a standard shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a translucent rich chestnut color with about a finger of creamy ecru foam. Aroma and flavor are of medium roasted grains, bitter-sweet chocolate, a touch of spicy rye malt, figs, brown sugar, a hint of coffee. Around medium in body with ample carbonation for the style. The rye adds a nice twist on the stout style. Worth a try if you find it."
"HV"
"Drinkability: I fear I should have consumed this a while ago, but it got buried in my cellar; a decent but unremarkable stout"
"Brown colored beer with a thin, light tan foam. Signature and distinct Bell's Stout nose, with a decadent malt notes of fudge and roast. Flavor has dulled and thinned about, but still shows some nice dark malt complexity, with notes of rye. What a badass stout, especially given it's nearly 3 years old. Bell's Stout hold up very well."
"Notes from 1/10/06"
"This has held up quite well and I am quite enjoying the cocoa notes and the bright, concentrated fruit flavors that are offset by the smooth roast character."
"Interesting stout and definitely enjoyable, but probably not something I'd have in my fridge every day. Lacks robustness overall, in my opinion."
"Pretty sure froggyfrog sent this my way and if so, thanks!"
"I cant believe that I hadnt tried this one untill now. This is batch #7235, so it had aged at least a year. A half an inch of spicey dark tan head fades to barely a skim in just minutes. A glassy black body is quite attractive. Nose is big with roasty coffee tones almost like fresh chicory. As you take first sip you get a hint of the rye feel that comes through as a edgy fruit sweetness and creamy coffee feel. A long dry bitter is actually even and well recieved on the back of the palate. Dryness hints to a twing of sour, but it is shore and gels well. Mouthfeel is a little zesty and bitter staying thick on the back of the tongue. This is a very drinkable almost sessionable stout."
"Pours dark black with a creamy, soft tan head. Smell is lightly sweet dark rich roasty malt but with a unique element from the rye, I'm guessing. A bit light of a mouthfeel, but the flavor is nice with a good roasty presence and a bit of the rye coming into play in the taste as well. Moderate carbonation, and a nice, if not spectacular beer. Very enjoyable though."
"In the past I would buy a case of this beer at a time. So good. I'm sorry that this is my last one for a while."
"I enjoyed this beer, though the moniker ""stout"" may be a bit misleading."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Carbonation is very good. Very smooth and drinkable. I could handle a few of these. Overall, this is a solid beer. Recommended if you happen to run across it."
"Overall: Not what I was expecting and a slight disappointment for a Bell's stout. Nonetheless I was happy to try it and I think imstillthegman for his wonderful package of brews."
"Pours an almost black with a one finger light tan head that slowly dies down to a thin frothy layer. Stickiness is pretty weak, not much of anything. First whiff I get is rye but quickly followed by a light french roast coffee aroma. There is a slight nutty aroma with some caramel malt sweetness. Taste is a grassy roasted malt with another appearance from the coffee. Slight smokey flavors which is complimented by a chocolate sweetness. Mouthfeel is very light for the style but that's where the rye comes in. A bit of carbonation that tingles the mouth. Alcohol is very well hidden in this brew. Very interesting take on the American Stout, but as usual, Bell's doesn't disappoint."
"Drank this rye stout while eating a reuben and I don't think there could have been a better combonation on that cool November day."
"This beer is fairly dark with just a small rim for a head. The smell is a nice chocolate. The taste is like a nice porter, with roasted hints and oatmeal. The mouthfeel is smooth and the drinkability is good. My bottle says this is from batch 7235 which according the Bell's website was bottled on 2-9-06. In that case the beer is holding up just fine. Obtained from Dertbert in a trade a while back."
"Easy to drink as it's so smooth."
"Appearance was dark and beer was somewhat un-carbonated, unlike the Bell's Kalamazoo Stout and Java Stout. Aroma and flavor were very minimal and not very roasty at all, again unlike its other Bell's stout stablemates. I felt a bit let-down by the lack of flavor in this beer; much the same way I felt the last time I had a Guinness. Mouthfeel was a bit watery. Not a bad beer, but nothing to get excited about."
"drinkability is pretty good, just lost something with time. the alcohol is completely hidden, making it a little dangerous. would really like to re-review this one when i can get a fresh bottle."
"This beer poured a deep dark brown with a small tan head. It had a wheaty sour smell, and some roasted barley. The taste is real nice, a rye spiciness on top of the roasted barley with a little chocolate. It has a very nice thick smooth mouthfeel, very drinkable."
"D: This is a very sessionable stout."
"Drinkability- Good example of a sessionable stout. Good flavor and texture. Thanks for the brew Steven!"
"Ordered the last bottle they had at Cole's the other night. Minscule <pfft> sound upon opening, and it proved to be slightly flat. I struggled to get any head to form, and what little of the sandy foam emerged quickly receded. Deep onyx was the color of the rest of the beer. Zero head made it difficult to discern the roasted grain and earthy-spicy rye scents that came through in the aroma. Decent flavor, with coffee and chocolate percolating amidst the prickly rye zing. Detected some carbonation in the mouthfeel, which was otherwise slightly slick and somewhat chewy, so this stuff wasn't totally flat. An interesting flavor profile, but not something I'd go back looking for explicitly. It's great to see Bell's beers available from time to time out here where there's no ""official"" distribution, so the novelty may have inflated my scoring a bit."
"D: The ale is smooth and sweet, delicious without going overboard on the roasted malt element. This stout is sessionable and very good."
"I had a hunch the rye would render a unique touch and it didn't disappoint. It's a bit sassy, rather glib, and quite fun. Sure, it won't astound, but the core essence and manageable ABV champion some fine drinkability. It makes me glad I caught this rye brew, which would mmake me a catcher of...of the...never mind."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: Thanks go out, once again, to HimerMan for this tasty brew. It was on my wants list, and now I can take it off. I liked this one, and would drink it again if I could get it."
"A curious little stout, very mild and unassuming, almost a wallflower with eyes pointed towards its shoes within the style. The rye provides some pleasant earthy and nutty notes, but not enough to make enough of an impact or impression when all is said and done. Either way, many thanks to rudge75 and fisherman34 for the sample."
"Pretty easy drinking. medium mouthfeel and drinkablity. Over alla nice brew, but I would't run out to get it"
"Body is medium but the beer itself is huge. Big flavors but balanced and light enough to enjoy at any drinking pace. But drink slowly."
"Great stuff."
"Impenetrable by light, it has a slight brown tint with a nice tan head but it dissipates completely in my glass. Has a roasted barley, coffee, and dark cocoa smell. It has very light carbonation and well hidden alcohol. The taste is mostly earthy, sweet, roasted, and bitterness like that of dark chocolate. Not a bad stout, but nothing too exciting, due to its smoothness it could be a good session beer."
"An interesting take on a stout, but not one I find terribly appealing."
"This beer pours a really dark brown color with a lot of nice carbonation going on. It has a tan head that didn't last to long at all. I'm not really tasting the rye to much but it does have a nice taste and smell. Nothing to fancy here just really good overall drinking. Really smooth with a nice pleasantly sweet aftertaste. Very, very drinkable, I could probably drink quite a few of these."
"Overall, a very interesting take on a stout. The flavors are brand new to me. Its hard to tell whether on not I like it. Im pretty sure I do, but this stout is unlike any other stout. Better looked at as a rye beer than a stout, so as to not be disappointed."
"Bell's = dark ale goodness. Another winner. Worth getting a few."
"Pours a stout black with a gauze of sandy brown head. Roasted coffee, mud, spicy dark chocolate. Grainy, roasted, slight-sweetness malt with a peaty, smoky edge. Spicy bitterness fights with creamy tobacco and milk chocolate in the finish. Medium-bodied with a creamy feel. Interesting stout to try, but not as flavorful as most of the other Bells stouts. Ill try again though."
"D- This beer is very interesting and it has more layers to its complexity with every sip."
"One of the most drinkable stouts I've had. This couldn't quite be an every day beer, but a really great beer for watching the game, and refreshing and balanced enough for after rugby games or bike races. (I may have to bring this to both)."
"(Batch 7235, bottled Feb '06, aged 7-8 months)"
"Beer is good, happy rye-off beering."
"D - definitly a good beer. The rye is a nice twist."
"Overall a good and drinkable beer from Bell's. Kalamazoo is such a good brewery I have high expectations when I crack open a Bell's and this beer lived up to those expectations."
"I don't mean to demean old Rye here because he is packed in an awful prettty wrapper that looks like artwork from one of the great master painter's works but he is pretty ho-hum as far as Bell's and other stouts go. A nice rich and muddy flavor that does nothing to separate itself from the standard quality stout. Don't get me wrong, I like it like it, I just don't LOVE it like it. So let's just be friends Rye. No no you can't touch my bulging biceps or my washboard stomach Rye. No Rye we can't have a sleepover. Rye don't make me call the beer police. RYEEE!"
"Rye Stout has to be classified at a letdown, in large part because I've come to recognize the brilliance of Bell's beer and have very high expectations whenever I crack one open. If I read the tea leaves correctly, Rye Stout is a one time only re-release to pay homage to an old friend of the brewery. That's fine by me since I'd rather drink the other Bell's stouts, but I'm still glad that I was able to make its aquaintance today."
"I'd buy this again tomorrow if the stuff wasn't such a high commodity and so damned hard to find. So, yes, it is quite drinkable."
"Overall an excellent stout. The rye adds an added dimension to this stout. Absoultely delicious."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/2"" brown head over the cloudy, barely translucent dark brown brew. Head holds on well, with average to good lacing. Aroma is hearty dark grains, almost some smoke in there, very nice. Taste is sweet dark malts as well, reminds me of a milk stout, which is always cool. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very good, smoothness and coffee bitterness keeping the sweetness in check well. Wouldn't mind seeing more of these Bell's Stouts out this way, for sure."
"It looks nice enough. A dark, dark brown with a frothy tan head. Smell was pretty nice, too. Dry baker's chocolate, roasty grains, a bit of coffee. But the taste wasn't as smooth as I thought it could have been. A bit too dry and not as well balanced as I would have hoped. Decent medium mouthfeel, though."
"Opaque brown with an interesting aroma of chicory, highly acidic coffee, burnt rye toast, bitter chocolate, cream, and tea leaves. Taste is almost smoky from the rye with an sour quality from the coffee flavors. Tea leave hop finish with well roasted dark malt base. Feel is thick and very dry, an odd combination. Heavy body. Twangy from the coffee and chicory at certain points as well. Not very drinkable for me. I just am not too excited about these flavors. I dont think they blend or balance well."
"D: Good drinkability."
"This a very drinkable stout, just not to my personal preferences."
"on tap at Maduro with dirtylou"
"The beer paried up fairly nicely to a broubon chocolate ball. So with that it seems that semi-sweet chocolate would be a nice pair with the beer."
"Cheers."
"Thanks to BA JeffKrenner."
"Despite a slight shortcoming in the mouthfeel (IMO), this beer is very tasty, and combined with such a complex, mind-blowing and amazing aroma, is a pleasure to drink. I wish I had picked up more than one bottle!"
"Available at Vintage Estates in Boardman, OH...appears a dark caramel brown near black with a nice tan head leaves even thick bands of lacing with each sip from my saturated pint. Aromatics contain creamy doughy chocolate with a hint of Irish cream coffee, evident spicy rye in all it's grainy herbally goodness. Flavor has a slight vinous feel to it quality soft chocolate notes streak across the palate with mellow herbal hop layers and subtle spicy rye finish characteristic unfiltered doughy Bell's touch as well. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied low key gentle carbonation silky smooth going down great brew. Drinkablity...I love all stouts outta Kalamazoo another reason to love Bell's brewing I could definitely enjoy a few of these."
"I find Bell's Rye Stout to be an exceptionally drinkable stout. You won't be overpowered. Hops play a supporting role here. The rye is just part of the ensemble. I really enjoy this stout!"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a dark brown to black color, with some ruby edges. Thin tan head disappears immediately. Aroma is certainly rye, roasty, and slightly sour. Milk chocolate flavor gives way to some roasty flavors, cream, rye bread and sour milk. There is also some earthy yeasty flavors present as well. Low carbonation with a decent mouthfeel. This is not one of my favorite stouts from Bell's. Interesting experiment, however this one does not suit me well."
"Very nice Rye Stout wish I had tried it on tap."
"Easy drinking, but I'm not sure if I could handle more than one of these. Certainly not my style."
"Dwonderful! I only bought one, but wish I had bought a six pack. I will have this again for sure."
"Tastes caramel, chocolate, coffee, a mild sour from black malt. Gently sweet and a touch of cream. Rounded hop floral in the end and opening the aftertaste. A touch woody and dry in the aftertaste...plus some iron. Nice mix and well balanced. Not quite as sweet as the Founders Rye stout I just had. A bit more complex, but not quite as easy drinking. Md-thick mouthfeel and modest carbonation. Has a ""Bell's"" flavor quality about it."
"It had a subtle grainy flavor, but was surprising NOT overpowering. It didn't fit my stereotypical idea of a dark roasted stout. It wasn't so thick and chewy, but a little thin and watery for a stout. But weirdly, that lack of punch made it easier to drink. It felt smooth, with no abrasive carbonation. Overall, it wasn't an impressive stout in terms of character and flavor, but it was a pretty easy and pleasant experience."
"Slàinte!"
"let me down."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black color with one finger of medium tan head. There is just a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell has a good dose of roasted malt, slightly sweet with bitter black coffee and just a hint of rye. The taste is sweet and nutty at first, with some chocolate and almond coming through. It has a dry rye and coffee finish though. Fairly tasty. The aftertaste is pleasant. The mouthfeel is just a little light and watery on the tongue. The drinkability is great though. Another solid beer from Larry Bell & the gang."
"I think this is a very drinkable beer. I liked this one a lot and wish I could still find it in my area. Had to of been a pretty limited release."
"Mouthfeel - balanced in flavors"
"Mouthfeel is heavy, creamy but smooth. Milky texture without milky flavor. Love my rye beers. Now, love my rye stouts even better. A glass was gone far too quickly."
"This is a great beer with good carbonation and an enjoyable feel. Please come south, Bell's. We need you down here. Thanks to CRJMellor for helping me get my hands on this one."
"Received as part of BIF 33, from orbitalr0x, Bells Rye Stout poured out dark brown and very well carbonated. The head was four fingers thick, and occupied nearly half the pint glass. The smell was mild, and had the typical chocolate aroma typical of the stouts of this strength. The taste was a little too light for the style, with sweet, sour, and grainy flavors. Not sure if I detected any rye in here. The mouthfeel was thin and dry, and aftertaste minimal. I could not detect any alcohol at all, which made this very easy to drink."
"12 oz bottle pours a dark mahogany body, opaque but not inky. Small tan head quickly subsides and leaves minimal lace. Smells like a sweet stout, initially, with a lacto note. Spicy rye, old coffee, and a vague hint of bittersweet chocolate come on as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium, but thins as it warms. Carbonation is moderate. Taste has lots of spicy rye which infuses the dark roasty stout flavors with a pleasant bite. Some earthy hop character works well. No hint of the abv, making this an easily drinkable addition to the worthy array of stouts by this fine brewery."
"Pouring a 12oz into my pint glass, I have sitting before me a nice looking stout. Obsidian in appearance, though not 100% opaque it is close. The head doesn't stay for long, but forms a creamy khaki ring that clings to the sides of my glass. The aroma is big and bold, rye and raw grain up front, with plenty of coffee and chocolate, as well as some caramel and breadiness, spicy notes becoming more pronounced as the beer warms. Flavor is crisp, the grains sharp, these impressions accentuated by tight carbonation. Raw grain collides with roasted barley and produces some bitter espresso and unsweetened chocolate flavors in the process. Possibly some oats too, there is a smoothness under all of the brackish grain. There is an obvious spiciness, can't quite be attributed to hops, most likely due to the rye. Yeasty breadiness is also floating around in my mouth. Finish is complex - spicy, dry & roasty, and some bitter, slightly sour lactic flavor that borders on acidity. Definitely an interesting take on an American Stout. Bell's knows their stouts, and aren't afraid to experiment. This isn't a beer for everyone, but is worth checking out."
"Pours out almost black with a tan foamy head that leaves a scattering of sticky lace around the glass. Dark chocolate and roasted malts over a light rye aroma. Some what sweet but pretty mild. Light roasty notes with a bit of grainy rye and bitter sweet chocolate. Fairly simple but enjoyable taste ends with a touch of chocolate. Smooth enough mouthfeel and pretty easy drinking overall. Nice and enjoyable but this would get boring fairly quickly."
"overall, not bad but not something i have any desire to return to, especially at Bell's prices."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. The beer has a clinging oilyness that helps the flavor linger. This is a very good beer treat. I just have one question where is the rye?"
"Pours a black/brown with the ruby hue round the bottom, with a thickish one inch head dissapating to a thin foam, lacing that hangs around for a bit, falling in bubbles down the glass. Aroma is of roasted malts, a darkish chocolate and a faint bready something that just must be rye I suppose. A rather nice mouth, smooth and warm and dry. Tastes of a rich, almost subdued roasted malt with chocolate tones, and where the nose was faintly bready the taste is fainly wood-like. Most perplexing, yet highly enjoyable, I'm going to have to go pick this up for another go-round."
"It is pretty light in body and creamy smooth in texture. Damn this one goes down easy. I really like this. I'd love to have this on tap."
"I see this as a great every-day (read: mellow) stout that could work wonders as a newbie-converter."
"Pours a dark brown/near black with a brownish tan head. Full-bodied mouthfeel with ample carbonation. Nothing really special on the nose. As it warms a chocolate and rye or grain-like aroma emerges. This is a hearty rye stout. It's almost chewy. Nuttiness and dark malt are noticed, but it's a hard taste to describe. Hops balace nice with the rye flavor. Great beer to pair with a German dark wheat bread during lunch. Or any other hearty sandwich. Not something I'd drink everyday, but a beer I feel would accentuate certain foods."
"Mouthfeel- A little dry and chocolatey. But the entire palate is covered with flavor."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite stout, even among bell's products. I can appreciate that they tried something different, though."
"Worth having several."
"Pours an opaque black/brown, small tan head forms, some nice lacing. Smell is roasty, with some rye spice, wheat, caramel, and a little citrus. Taste is roasty chocolate and coffee, caramel, some citrus and rye spice in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Nicely done, first for me for a rye stout. Thanks DrJay!"
"Rye, Sugar and coffee with more than a hint of dryness. The aroma included coffee and a hint of dark fruits. Not a terribly complex beer but for what it does, it does well. I will be picking up more of these in the future."
"Yet another good beer from Bells Brewing. This is a good stout and I like the unique rye taste. Keep up the great work!!!"
"12 ounce bottle. Bell's Rye Stout pours out a nearly black color with a head that quickly fades away. The aroma is a burnt roastiness but with a slightly carboard-like smell behind it. Rye flavor is quite apparent. Nutty, roasted grain. Like the aroma, there's something in the flavor that reminds me of cardboard. A little bit of chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel is medium. No sign of the alcohol. This beer underwhelmed me, but I had high expectations from Bell's, the ""King of Stouts""."
"Almost black in colour with medium carbonation. Malty aroma with suggestions of coffee, milk chocolate, molasses and berry fruit. Flavor wise, the milk chocolate aspect becomes dominant, but some and spicy rye notes also become aparent along with other toasted grain nuances. Huge mouthfeel to this one. Very enjoyable, but perhaps a shade less forcefull than the Kalamazoo stout."
"Drinkability - Not bad. Worth a try at least."
"Piss on that."
"Medium body, but king of greasy on the tongue, fairly drinkable. About what I've come to expect from Bell's. Average."
"This is solid drinking all the way. Can't put down the classicly smooth mouthfeel and totally balanced flavors."
"Very dark, nearly black, but really more of a clear, deep ruby. A short tan head of fine bubbles appeared after a fairly aggressive pour. Great lacing. The aroma is very roasted with a bitter coffee character. Kind of caramel sweet and chocolatey too. Milk chocolate and roasted flavour, mild bitterness, with a bit of spice and a hint of alcohol warmth in the finish. Full, creamy body with low carbonation. Luxurious texture. Another high quality stout from Bell's."
"Poured a black, opaque color with a cream colored head that was covered with small, clear bubbles. Aromas of dark chocolate, alcohol, grains, and roasted malt. The taste followed the scent with a semi-sweet chocolate flavor that melted into grainy, hoppy flavors. Hop bitterness is apparent throughout each and every sip. Subtle sour & bitter tastes in the finish. Quite flavorful and drinkable. Somewhat chewy texture with added thickness in my mouth."
"Another Great Stout from Bell's. Right up there with the Kalamazoo Stout. Pours out to a dark as night black color with a nearly violently formed head of brown / tan foam. Medium low carbonation. Lots of lace. Aromas of rye, wheat, grain, malt and roasting meat are unique and enjoyable. Taste is medium full bodied and totally quaffable; dried sugar cane, roasted malt, grainy rye, some bread and biscut notes, touches of dark chocolate. Best flavor in an American Stout i've had. Mouthfeel was medium bodied but quite creamy. Very smooth going down. Very drinkable at 6.7% ABV. Could be a sessioner. Definitly Recommended."
"The first time I had this Rye Stout I thought it was ok. I found its sharp rye notes haunting me. I had to go back for a second. It pours a brillant cocoa from the bottle and rest a rusty black in the glass. Besides the distinct Rye flavor upfront, I truely enjoy the alkaline mouthfeel and clean finish."
"A good beer, but it doesn't knock off my socks like the last time I had it. I wish it had a heftier body. A 6-pack will be plenty for me. Absolutely must be drunk out of a good glass. Drinking it in the bottle, so much is lost. I'll stick to the Kzoo stout!"
"D - Enjoyable stout. The spice of the rye is nice but seemed to fade too quickly."
"Bell's delivers again. Very sweet, smooth, creamy, and characterful. About as black as you get with very little light permiating. A thin, dense head remains to the bottom of the glass. Smooth and sweet in the same Oatmeal Stout sort of way. Sweetness depends on big barley additions, roasted grains, and lactose. Smoothness depends on oats and milk sugars. Rye (pumpernickle rye bread) flavors add a grain, earthy, dusty character. A grain-husk bitterness rides into the finish. Lowly hopped and to offset the sweetness only--contributes little to the finish brew. Quite clean in the finish with a light residual milky flavor and texture."
"I could see myself drinking a few of these when I'm in the mood for something with such a roasted malt profile."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a tingly carbonation. Goes down easily, however I could've gone for a little more body here. Seems a bit on the thin side to me. Drinkability is good. The fairly low abv would make it easy to have a few in a sitting. Yet another tasty stout from one of the masters of the style! Bell's puts a smile on my face yet again. Now quit reading this and go get some :-)"
"drinkability: somewhat hindered by the nature of it, but still solid"
"Pours a brown color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has some spicy notes and quite a bit of roasted and chocolate hints as well. The flavor has a lot less rye character than expected, just a little rye spice. The chocolate and the roasted notes bring things around for a smoothness. Not being a huge fan of rye, the low rye profile was nice for me. The body is moderate and the drinkability was pretty good."
"Pours very dark, almost black but you can see some light getting through.. no head even though i poured from quite a distance. Smells like dry rye wafers and roasted malt. Dry, smooth coffee taste, very subtle in tone. Some chocolately notes. Rye taste is faint and i wouldn't recognize it if not for the beer's name. Finish is coffee-like. Smooth, dry mouthfeel. good drinkability. not an overbearing stout, probably a good session beer for me."
"This stout pours a deep dark brown color with some ruby highlights. Absolutely, no head, just a thin cream colored line on the outside of the glass. Very little lacing. Strong smell of coffee and malasses, with a smoky background to it. Taste does mimic the smell leaving a slighly dry feeling. This brew has quite a sour and bitter feel, with some carbonation. Not my favorite stout from Bell's, but worthy of a try."
"Aroma is a little spicy with chocolate and dark karo syrup notes. Deep black with a quickly fading tan head. For is spicy and tobacco tinged with the flavor what I imagine hot water that had had rye seeds steeped in it would taste of. Spicy pepper notes tickle the tonsils as I swallow. A smooth choclate malt flavor runs through all ranges. The finish kind of reminds me of a very toned down version of the Stone 03 03 03 and its lingering spiciness. Interesting, but it gets thin and the lack of any real head hurts the visual appeal."
"Filled about 2.5 hours ago. Pours a deep brown color with ruby highlights at the bottom of the glass. A 2 finger light tan head falls to a quarter inch over top of the beer. Its pretty dark, but clarity is still easy to see. A nice clear brew. Nose is definately rye spicey. This is balanced by a very deep roast, but not overpoweringly strong. There are lighter chocolate notes playing behind the sharper and stronger rye and roast. Flavor is nice. The spicey rye hits initially and stays with through the duration of the taste. This melds very well with a more subtle roasted character, with a sweet caramel and very light chocolate undertone. I think the flavors in this one really work well togther. Nothing is too strong, and I think the balance is done well. The feel is thick, with a light carbonation, giving it a very chewy feel to it. This also works very well with the other characteristics of the brew. I think this beer is very well built. Even though it is a substantial beer, it doesn't sit overly heavy, and nothing keeps me from wanting to put this one away with ease. I dig it. I'd like it to have been a shade darker, but that may just be me."
"This brew pours an opqaue black color. The head is mere lacing that recedes into a thin ring around the glass within seconds. The aroma is ever so chocolaty with a lot of roasted malt. It reminds me a lot of Bell's Porter's aroma. The upfront taste is of roasted and chocoalte malt, while some spicy rye comes through in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but is perceived as being a bit lighter due to its medium level of carbonation. Overall, this beers seems to me like a cross between a porter and a stout. Nothing in it really stands out, but everything in it works well and I can't help but like it."
"Drinkability is great on this one. It goes down smooth, there's nothing crazy about this one that makes it difficult to suck down. Damn good beer here."
"Notes: Solid beer. Definitely not my favorite Bell's stout, but this one is very drinkable and it certainly isn't obvious that it is almost 7% abv. Seems almost sessionable."
"Burning rubber scented dark brown liquid. Alfalfa sprout, over roasted coffee, over extracted cocoa, until these are sharp and intensely sour and resinous. Smoky like the butt end of a good cigar. On the palate it's sweet and simple with burnt earth flavored structure underneath. Oddly vegetal. Wilted lemon essences on the finish. Charmless/boring to drink."
"Another great stout by Bell's. This beer gives an enveloping amount of rye in the nose with hints of choclate malt and caramel. Very easy to drink not a big bold imperial. Can definitely drink a few of these babies. Same taste as smell with an added hint of vanilla."
"Overall, yet another interesting beer in Bell's vast stable of stouts. The spicy character in the finish is what makes it unique, and this beer is pretty close to the Kazoo Stout / Special Double Cream league for me. All of those beers are closely related, they just showcase slight variations, the Rye is just another good option if you're looking for a stout from the guys in Kalamazoo."
"Drinkability: Immensely enjoyable. Nothing over the top here. Just a very well made stout that would be strongly recommended especially for the non-stout drinker."
"Found a bottle of this beer in my basement from several years ago. So I am reviewing this beer now after about 3 years of cellaring. I don't really remember what this beer tasted like when I first had it, but I will say that cellaring must not have changed much with it. First of all, it survived the time well, no off flavors, nice carbonation. Aroma is nice and full, roasted coffee, caramel, dark chocolate, and fresh baked bread. Rye is one of my favorite malts and it works well here, adding a spicy edge to the malty stout. Hops are well balanced and go well with the slightly smoky flavor. Overall this is quick drinkable, but nothing special (even after aging it)."
"Seven and a half years later I had on tap and the colorur was brown witha little head. Big chocolate Sweet-spicey, not as edgy so I am keeping up the bottle review."
"Pours a deep brown with a light mocha colored head that is gone pretty quickly,aroma is marshmellow-like and slightly nutty.Taste has a sour note to it with with a roasted malt favor that comes thru in the aftertaste with an almost cola like flavor as well.It was a nice beer to try but not really something I would go out and get again."
"Pours a black witth a thin tan head. Kinda sweet, has a roasty choco-oaty thing goin on. Rye flavors are there with some spicing. Mouthfeel is very smooth and welcoming. A solid stout which I enjoyed very much. I wish Bell's beer were available locally."
"Big thanks to my drinkin' buddy Feloniousmonk for the bottle!"
"cheers to feloniousmonk for the sample!"
"The color piceous with a gargantuan sized head, the texture frothy, the color a light chocolate with the decomposition of the head a satiny veil of lace forms to obscure the glass. The ray adds a bit of earthiness to the somewhat sweet nose, toasted grains evident, and a fine sniffer for sure. Front is thick and sweet, top full bodied and rich in its feel to the palate. Finish is mild in its acidity; the hops are pleasing in their spicy bite, bitter chocolate dry aftertaste a real treat that I sample only rarely."
"Overall an amazing beer. Hopefully it will be more available in this area in the future."
"This had, on the whole, a much more milky, sweet flavor (and feel) than a standard stout. That bitter, roasted balance is a little absent here -- but not to its detriment. One of the more pleasant beer surprises I've had lately."
"F"
"Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is roasted malts and slightly spicy. Medium bodied stout. Deep roasted malts are chocolate and coffee. The rye adds a nice spiciness to the beer. Well balanced. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Pours a dark color with a solid sized head that lasted until I was midway through the drink. Aroma showed that this did in fact have rye in it along with some roasted flavors. The taste backed up the aroma. Roasted coffee/espresso begins the taste trip. Rye flavor comes in the middle and provides a dry, spicyness to this beer. Caramel malts are noticed throughout along with some earthy hop flavor. Finishes with a roasted barley taste."
"This brew poured a small head of light brown bubbles and an opaque black colored body. It had a strong coffee and rye taste with good lacing. Its initial fizzyness made it hard to taste the initially flavor, but it finished well. We had this beer at the festival in Frankenmuth Michigan."
"Roast grain, chocolate, apples, and a slight metallic taste. Sour rye lingers, passing hop bitterness. Not particularly dry, but sour rye keeps it balanced."
"This is another good offering from Kalamazoo, but that tartness isn't quite my cuppa. But it tames with temperature and I'd definitely try this again. Thanks, of course, to felonious!"
"Originally sampled on 23 November 2002. I'm writing this review from my notes. This pours dark brown. The aroma has hints of coffee & roasted nuts. It's hard to describe precisely what the rye adds here, but it's definitely in the mouthfeel. It's different & not outstanding."
"Purchased at the Brewery in November, 2002. Served at cellar temperature."
"Dark brown and opaque with a slightly red hue. Very little head was evident. Slightly chocolatey aromas with a hint of some spice. Flavoer had a bizarre tang that sat on top of the chocolate flavors. Fruit and a good sweetness are also present but only start to really show themselves after drinking a few mouth fulls, coincidentally when the tang started to go away too. Finishes dry and spicy."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for this bottle."
"Virtually black, with cloudy deep garnet perceptible when held to light. Sticky one fingered head leaves sparse lace. Dryish spicy rye hits the nose at first, then is contrasted by dark caramel malt sweetness and mellow chocolate malt. Hints of prune like tartness and cassis provide a dark fruity undertone in aroma. Fairly tame, but pleasant aromawise. Currant laced sweetness at first in flavor is ceded by a melange of candyish chocolate and mellow prune tinged tartness. Non descript malt sweetness both from residual, unfermentable dextrins and caramel malt persists throughout due to the understated hop bitterness. Moderate bodied, with a enjoyably thick, rye induced gluey proteinaceous mouthfeel. Light, tamarind like rye spiciness emerges mid palate and serves to contrast sweetness. Faint earthy hop flavor. Finishes surprisingly dry, with a snap of trace citric tartness. Bell's Rye Stout is flavorful for sure, but was perhaps a touch lacking in depth of malt character. It's reminescent of a Boulder Singletrack Copper ale and Kalamazoo Stout hybrid. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for the bottle of this unique and tasty brew."
"Perfect ebon color, large fizzy brown head. Aroma is richly roasted and spicy, with hints of graininess. Heavy mouthfeel, but smooth on the palate. Sits sturdily in the mouth, leaving a nice, pleasant finish, and an abiding sweetness, with hints of cherry, coming through in the middle. A very satisfactory stout, and an accomplished experiment from Kalamazoo."
"Very much like the spiced stout minus the spices. Dry, less espresso flavor, flavor seems a bit thin. Can't really say this is their best offering since the thin bitter flavor underneath grows the further into the glass you get."
"Pours nearly black, with brown/amber highlights showing up only under the scrutiny of a bright light. Substantial creamy tan head that slowly breaks up to leave a sparse filmy head and clingy lace. The smell is very sweet with only faint hints of dark, roasted flavors--not what I expected for a stout. Taste seems rather watered-down but is otherwise pleasant. Sweet and light at the start with grains gradually taking over. Relatively light body for this stout gives it a nice mouthfeel and good drinkability as well."
"Bell's is liquid crack for Stout lovers like me. This beer pours almost black with a medium thin light brown head. Very little lacing. Nice bittersweet aroma of chocolate and black cherry. Flavor is a smooth blend of roasted coffee and what I am assuming must be rye. Points for pulling off something unique so well."
"A tasty little stout, aided in memorablity by the rye. Sessions are possible, as this one never gets too overpowering to enjoy more of."
"Another of the November stouts...this is quite the interesting ride!"
"Pours black opaque with a finger of head. Maltiness and roasted aroma. Taste is of roasted malt. The one thing that seems a bit distinguishing to this beer is a slight sour tangy taste. Rye taste hangs in the background. Well it seems everyone has few words to describe this and I'm no different. It's OK but I don't miss it too much the rest of the year."
"Pours almost black in color, roasted coffee and chocolate aroma, starts sweet with a thick mouthfeel, full bodied sweet with a nice bitter finish, not bad, then agian I like all of Bells stout."
"This beer pours very dark, almost black and formed a nice light bubbly brown head that subsided quickly and left trace lace.  The aroma was of malt & rye and the flavoer of rye and chocolate.  A silky body and medium finish.  Not as good as their other stout's like expedition and kalamazoo, but not bad."
"Opaque, darkest brown aided by lots of floating chunkies.  Poured the beejeezuz out of it to get just a trace of a head.  Sweet aroma, definitely tinged with a rye sense.  Nice mouthfeel, a trace of an oily presence I like in some Stout styles.  Deep roasted flavors, a trace of dark chocolate sense with some spice.  Subtle rye flavor (good for me, love the bread, have problems with Rye Whiskey)...pretty nice beer, what Stout is next, Kalamazoo?"
"Deep and opaque... with a thin tan head and clinging lace.  Aroma of rye, chocolate, and coffee with a touch of sweetness. Assertive aroma that I really enjoy. Flavor begins slightly acidic... some burnt malt, then rye... finishes with a bitterness and sweetness that reminds me of cappuccino.  Medium full body with a smooth creamy mouthfeel. This is a finely created brew from the masters of stouts.  It's brews like this that make me happy to drink local!"
"The Rye Stout is a good looking, almost opaque stout with a substantial amount of yeast floating throughout. It had minimal head that disappeared quickly. The nose was of roasted malt and rye. The taste was the same and was rather easy to drink. Kalamazoo is one of my all-time favorite breweries and it certainly knows how to craft good stouts. This one did not disappoint."
"Deep, dark brown body with a big tan head.  Head retention is a bit weak, but a clinging lace lasts the life of the beer.  Rye really stands out in the smell, perhaps too much.  Flavor full of rich roasted malt with chocolate.  Rye also stands out in the flavor, but not nearly as strong as in the smell.  The brew feels great on the tongue - just thick and oily enough for a solid stout.  Certainly not the best of Bell's stouts, but still better than many other stouts on the market.  Rye is also an interesting change up for those with stout-heavy diets."
"Nice opaque appearance with some yeast sediment noticeable.  Thick brown head that is a bit fizzy.  It disappears quickly.  Smells of oats to me.  Very inviting aroma.  Very creamy mouthfeel.  A slight spiciness is present, presumably from the rye.  Medium body.  Just a little viscous but not overbearing.  At times, I think it tastes a bit like a chocolate candy bar.  But I don't get that in every taste.  Not overly bitter.  Easy drinking.  Quality Stout."
"-This is a beautiful stout...nice subtle cocoa aroma with grains present...just a wonderful sweet-style stout that isn't overly thick or overly sweet...nice character..unique hop bite on aftertaste..very well made stout by the stout king."
"One of Bell's ""10 Stouts of November"".  A decent offering, but not their best.  Interesting spice on the palate.  rye, eh?"
