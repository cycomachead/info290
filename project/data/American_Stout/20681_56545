Front of palate is hit with a sweet, almost cherry taste and the vanilla flavor settles after. Tan 2 finger foam laces the glass. Smooth but clean mouth feel lingers for a time after finishing.","hotpauko","Mar 31, 2015"

A light hint of vanilla on the nose but mostly toasted malt notes, cocoa, coffee and toffee.  The mouth feel in concert with the flavors are almost immediately reminiscent of a classic egg cream soda.  It's the carbonation of this beer that really do that.  It's uncanny actually.  It was the first thing I thought of upon my first sip.  Nice long finish and lingering aftertaste.  Really a fine stout.","Lumens66","Feb 16, 2015"

Nothing super strong, but a complex meld of roasted malt, coffee, and just a touch of warming spice, all finishing with a pleasant vanilla aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. Feel is rich and creamy with a proper carbonation level. This is a bit pricey, but the quality of the ingredients is evident in the final product.

3.9,-1.8,,,,,,"Maine Brewing doesn't make a bad beer by any stretch, but I was expecting something a little more assertive given the aroma presentation when I first poured it. Don't go into this expecting to be bowled over by vanilla. After the initial wave hits you, it turns into a relatively pedestrian (but extremely drinkable) dry stout. I consider it a bridge between a boring irish stout and the more aggressively flavored ""big"" stouts. Save for the oatmeal characteristic, this could easily be rebranded a porter. Which would be fine except Maine already makes an outstanding porter that Mean Old Tom does not want to be compared to.","dd43","Dec 01, 2014"

Very dark chocolate brown brew, nearly black, with little in the way of colored highlights and a large amount of creamy light brown head (for a stout). Aroma is assertive dark roast coffee and chocolate, slight floral vanilla and grassy hops (!). On the palate one gets more of the same, dark coffee and chocolate milk, faint butterscotch and red licorice. Starts quite sweet but dries out quickly, an interesting contrast. I am noticing a nice nutty malt character as well, a unique element for this style that is amplified over the course of multiple sips. Very smooth creamy mouthfeel, moderately thick with low to medium carbonation. Finishes roasted and very dry, peanut shells coming to mind. Very light citrus hops wink in and out (they use Centennial in this). The vanilla beans add a tinge of floral perfume and do not dominate the proceedings. Debates about price points notwithstanding (I think the ingredients these guys use and their entire approach justifies the cost, not to mention how freaking good the beers are), Maine Beer Company proves here that they aren't just hop wizards, although I imagine I will always prefer the hoppy stuff from these guys.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 19, 2014"

Smooth, creamy, the roasted coffee edge is there for flavor and balance, as well as making the beer a little more fuller bodied and have a slightly dry finish, but it's the vanilla/espresso like sweetness (with some chocolate as well) that livened up my sweet tooth and led me to really like this beer.","clayrock81","Jul 03, 2014"

There is indeed a special vein running through the majority of this brewery's offerings, but methinks this offering took one too many sick days when they were handing out the decoder ring for that.","biboergosum","Jun 18, 2014"

Medium bodied, smooth, soft like maybe velvet, clean, and so well-balanced. To conclude: I've rated this low abv stout quite high even though I prefer my stouts super strong in taste, thickness, and alcohol.

Aroma has dark chocolate malts, roasted malt brings out hints of coffee and the beer was aged on vanilla beans so therefore there's a define creaminess on the nose to bring it all together. Dark chocolate bitterness on the palate, creamy vanilla beans with a hint of acidic coffee notes from the dark malts because I'm pretty sure there's no coffee in this brew. No signs of oxidation bottled on 12/10/13, I'm okay with that it's a bottle I bought in Pittsburgh, yet MBC is not distributed here yet! The nose is magnificent the flavor is sufficient and it's a damn solid beer creamy smooth natural carbonation the palate goes down way too easily. Overall a very stand up solid beer that I will continue to enjoy when I have the opportunity to try it.","WVbeergeek","Mar 03, 2014"

Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big milk chocolate, vanilla, roasted malt, cocoa, light coffee, caramel, toast, oats, light floral, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast malt and vanilla notes with light hops; and good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla, toast, oats, light char, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, oats, vanilla, caramel, light char, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with light vanilla and hop presence; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn good stout. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. Vanilla was much more prominent in the aromas than the flavors; but it was very enjoyable offering otherwise.","superspak","Jan 11, 2014"

Some might say it's expensive for what it is - I believe I paid around $7 for the 16.9 oz bottle, but I justify that by comparing its price to what I might pay at a bar, though anything is more reasonable that way. In any case, this is one of the more well-balanced stouts that I've had recently.","pvo","Dec 11, 2013"

Robust roastiness, espresso and, accents of vanilla cream; slightly reminiscent of a vanilla latte. Bakers chocolate upfront and hints of cream; vanilla beans join in with continued dark chocolate notes. Finishes with big, bold roasted malt, espresso notes, and ample hops smoothed out by returning vanilla notes. Moderately carbonated, heavier side of medium bodied; bordering on full bodied. Smooth, velvety on the palate; exceptional. Overall, this brew was much more bold and robust than expected. A nice enjoyable surprise.","chanokokoro","Dec 09, 2013"

Pitch black liquid, perhaps a touch flat and not a lot of shine, you can see little pin pricks of carbonation as the bubbles reach the surface, otherwise opaque. While there’s a good deal of roast to the nose it is not overdone and allows the chocolate, vanilla and licorice to sweeten things up, date and fig fruit, dose of candied nuts, lasts well without losing its relaxed feel. Medium-bodied plus, has a pleasingly dry texture without sacrificing flavor. Cocoa, milk chocolate, coffee more than vanilla. Carbonation keeps it refreshing not fluffy and soft. There’s plum, cherry and light fig going on. At times there is some booziness, odd given its relatively light ABV for the type. Comes up with a bit of mineral and earth for depth. Fashioned in a classic style, has length and cleanliness. Leaves you without much to say, preferable to just enjoy it.","farrago","Sep 21, 2013"

Head thinned out fairly fast, but left a thin layer with plenty of lacing. Aroma was very slightly sweet. Subtle chocolate notes, but very faint, with a bit of brunt vanilla. Flavor started off sweet, than developed a bit of tang, with some earthiness that hung around in the mouth. Mellowed out a bit over time which made it more enjoyable. Felt ok in the mouth. Definitely hung around for a while, coated nicely, but left a slightly strange feel at the back of the throat.

It poured dark and creamy. The foam stayed thick and creamy for as long as it took me to drink. I smelled just a hint of vanilla with chocolate. Tasted malt, and chocolate at first the more I drank the more vanilla I tasted. I do not know if they barrel age this beer but if they did I would LOVE to try it!!

The vanilla came out decently, with a great, simple, and heartily roasty stout base. This translated well through the flavoring, but some of the vanilla brightness did get a bit lost until the very end of the sip and aftertaste, where it gave sourness and eventual cleanliness respectively. The feel was silky smooth and creamy, aiding drinkability. The current trend is that people are loving all over Maine Beer Company’s more hoppy stock, but we think it is these sleepers that you need to watch out for.","TheBrewo","Beers"

Nose is cocoa, sweet vanilla beans, roasted coffee, grass & earth. A hint of char, medicinal alcohol that kept coming forward as it warmed and way in back some faint floral. Taste is smooth, on the heavy side but velvety. Vanilla, burnt coffee, burnt toast, roasted grains, bitter chocolate. I didn’t taste a lot of char but some and I am tasting some oats and some alcohol. Finishes semi wet and a little ashy. The hops were in there I can tell by the underlying fruit sweetness and a bit of slick oil that lightly coats the tongue. Bitterness is very light considering all that roasted toasted and burnt.

4.09,3,4.75,4.5,4,3.75,3.75,"This is a beautiful looking beer. It had an inch of thick, brown, fluffy head. The smell was pretty mesmerizing too. Very roasty and chocolatey. The taste was almost disappointing after that. It's good. Maybe even very good, but not mesmerizing. The chocolatey and coffee notes hit you first, but as your palate adjusts to their bitterness, it's a pretty straightforward stout. It's a very thick one with a lot of bitter notes. The roasted malt, the chocolate bitterness, and the cold coffee ground flavours all come together in a nice way. And maybe the vanilla bean flavour helps to mellow those out a bit, but I sort of wish it did more to that end. Breckenridge's Vanilla Porter may be catering to a different crowd with it's sweetness, but I thought it did a much better job of making the vanilla bean flavour a key part of the beer, at least. This one just screams of cold coffee flavour. It's still a decent stout, though. It, too, is partakable. Be prepared for a bitter, more traditional American stout, though. There is no sweetness here. I was wondering how something aged on vanilla beans could be ""mean," but now I know. Tom was indeed a rascal, drinking stuff like this. However, that hint of vanilla flavour that ties it all together and mellows out the flavour just enough shows that he had a soft spot for those willing to look for it. I may not have been expecting a bitter beer, but I got one and it's still worth giving a chance.","ElCommodoro","Feb 24, 2013"

The aroma is a tad weak, but the flavors present are very nice. Light cocoa with some coffee and roast. A very well-integrated and strong but not overbearing shot of vanilla. Some of the sweetness is almost lacto in character, or perhaps I just expect that in vanilla stouts. Definitely tends toward the sweet milk chocolate side of things. The taste could be quite good, but it just lacks the necessary depth. Kinda washed out. I'm mostly getting a sorta watery vanilla milk chocolate flavor. It's nice and I appreciate the thought behind it, but this beer could be a lot better if the same flavor profile was just turned up in intensity. Mouthfeel is actually pretty creamy despite the somewhat watery flavor. It's a nice beer and doesn't diminish my excitement for MBC, but I'm a bit disappointed after trying Lunch, Zoe and Peeper.","popery","Dec 23, 2012"

4.08,2.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"The beer pours a lovely coffee black with nice brown sugar notes on the edges of the glass. The head is puffy and colored like sand dunes, though it dissipates quickly, leaving long spider web curtains of sticky lacing on the sides and a ring of sandy fat bubbles on the edges of the glass. The smell is lightly roasty with some slight chocolate and coffee hints, and there’s also a sweet and slightly sour tinge of vanilla in the back and base of the smell. The beer’s taste begins wonderfully with a sweet vanilla that turns slightly sour as it lingers. Coffee and roasted notes are definitely present as well, bringing some lovely smoky notes to linger like a little campfire in your mouth. Vanilla coffee with a lightly soured milk are the dominant flavors in the beer. Mouthfeel is slightly tingly with carbonation but velvety smooth and chewy on the tongue. The beer leaves the mouth with a light dew drizzle of saliva on everything and a slight smoky dryness on the tongue that begs for more. The sweet is a little cloying from the vanilla, but that just makes this beer more of a sipper than a chugger. The beer also seems like it might do nicely with a little cellaring. Overall this is a very nice vanilla stout with great flavoring and has a lovely mouthfeel. Definitely worth a sip.","Maxwell","Aug 22, 2012"

3.78,-4.8,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"500ml bottle served in a standard pint. 0105012 printed on the label. Pours one shade shy of black with a voluminous, 1.5 inch, mocha-colored head. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap. Some spots and strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses roasted malt, cocoa nibs, a trace of vanilla and a suggestion of either lactose or artificial sweetener towards the back. Taste consistent with nose; however, the flavor profile comes off a bit watered down and there is a slightly ashy char that reveals itself towards the finish and lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a crisp, even carbonation that leaves a mild, residual prickle across the tongue. Overall, a solid beer, but not my favorite from this brewer. Also, the $6.99 price tag on this brew is a bit of a deterrent from adding this to my regular line-up. Worth trying if the opportunity presents, but not something I need to seek out again.","Jwale73","Jan 18, 2012"

4.17,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured from a bottle and served in a pint glass, the beer is an extremely dark brown coloring that is almost black in the depths. Pours with a thin, foamy, light brown colored head that remains a subtle eighth of an inch layer that retains throughout consumption. Aromas are rich and woody, with a slight coffee roast, creamy chocolate, and slightly charred blending. Smells complex and tasty. Flavors are also well blended, and come in a little more subtle than the nose prepares you for. Combined with the creamy smoothness of the body, this makes for an extremely easy beer to drink. The beer has an initial mocha coffee flavor, with more of the dark roasted coffee in the background. Some earthy and woody highlights throughout, with a chocolate profile through the backbone. The aftertaste is more of the bitterness from the coffee and dark chocolate flavors, with a touch of roastiness once again. The finish is smooth and slick, with a slight linger to the earthy characteristics. Very easy drinker, and solid flavor profile throughout. Very tasty!","GarthDanielson","Jan 17, 2012"

Taste is heavily favored on the roasty side giving Tom a porter vibe over stout IMO. Cocco, vanilla, roast, slight coffee/chocolate. All of these tastes are light though and mix very well.

3.65,-8.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Medium bodied with a nice balance of roasted and sweet flavors. Lots of dark malt flavor with hints of roasted gourmet coffee, burnt toast, oatmeal and dark chocolate followed by a creamy lactic and sweet vanilla presence mid-palate. I was nervous that this would be a vanilla overload but there is enough of the flavor there without overpowering the stout characteristics. It actually serves as a nice balance to what would otherwise be an overly roasted stout. a bit tame and light bodied for my liking but enjoyable and easy to drink.","corby112","Beers"
3.47,-12.6,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"Simple, straight-forward, and ultimately pretty plain. The vanilla didn't come through appreciably in the sip. Not enough body for my tastes, felt like a sweeter porter. Still not unpleasant at all to quaff. MBC has hoppiness down pat, but this stout wasn't the direction I'd hoped they'd take.","OldIronLungs","0"

4.2,5.8,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Roasty nose, fluffy cream head and dense black. Very creamy in the mouth, almost milky, it would be a milk stout if it wasn't for the roasted malt. Perfect amount of hops. There is a bit of bright fruit as well, not sure what though, coconut? Maybe not. Nice amount of vanilla, not sweet but straight Madagascar bean. This would do great on a nitro tap. Medium dry finish. Half way through the glass the roasty flavor disapears and it mostly creamy. Overall a good beer, I would drink it more frequently if it wasn't for the price, this is more of a $12 a six pack beer then a $5.50 a 16oz beer. Excellent anyway.","redleaves","Nov 10, 2011"

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"O: Since this summer, I've been an advocate of MBC via Peeper, Zoe and (especially) Lunch, but this is a first tasting of Mean Old Tom. It's a good stout. It's straightforward -- a tad simpler than I anticipated, based on other offerings of MBC. I'll look forward to trying a more aged version and of following MOT to track its evolution.","bierbrauer","Sep 26, 2011"

3.28,-17.4,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. While the flavors are nice, they are a bit too mild and lacking the vanilla I was looking forward to. The mouthfeel as well does this beer no favors, as it is a bit thin and even watery at times. Cool label, though!","nhindian","Aug 23, 2011"
4.05,2,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Batch #1. Frankly, I think the label just shows a Mildly Perturbed Tom... Anyway, it pours a dark sunset amber-garnet topped by about a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises dark chocolate powder, chocolate syrup, light roasted malts, dark greens, very light grass, and light coffee. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate powder, light vanilla bean, and black pepper. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta-kinda watery feel. Overall, a pretty tasty and enjoyable little stout. Frankly, I have yet to have a bad Maine Beer Company beer...","TMoney2591","Jul 07, 2011"

3.57,-10.1,4,4.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Taste is light and smooth, a balance between a bite of bitterness/carbonation and mellow vanilla and dark malts.

Overall quite nice - even on a summer afternoon.","kingcrowing","Jun 29, 2011"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"O - Not overly complex, but smooth, even and consistent throughout the sip. My only criticism would be to thicken it up, but considering I'm drinking this one in the midst of a 90 degree day, the light medium body seems to be just right for situation.","jzeilinger","Jun 25, 2011"

4.08,2.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"The palate is not quite as nice as the nose. Silky smooth, this almost has some oatmeal characteristics here. Moderately roasty with a nice toasted grain character, there's a mild grainy bitterness that balances the sweetness from the vanilla and caramel. The vanilla isn't particularly noticeable on the palate, but the base stout is good enough to hold its own. The mid-palate is just a touch watery, a hair more bitterness would take care of that. Drying, roasty and mildly bitter on the finish, this beer is medium-light in body, moderately carbonated and as with the Lunch IPA, expertly conditioned. Either I'm just in the mood for a good, simple stout, or the rest of the reviewers don't know what they're talking about :-) My only complaint would be the price, and even that's a half-hearted one.","DefenCorps","Jun 10, 2011"

3.52,-11.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Overall impression - for the most part, nicely done. I'm convinced this would be better labeled as an American Brown Ale as it seems more in line with that style than a stout. To that end, I have to knock it a bit to style but I'll happily give it the benefit of the doubt.","Ryan011235","May 23, 2011"

3.7,-6.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Poured into a pint glass. The beer pours dark brown with a thin layer of light tan head that washes away quickly with thin lace. This is certainly a vanilla bomb. Mostly vanilla in the aroma with dark roasted malts in the background. I'd say too much vanilla maybe, but it's still pleasant to smell. The taste, much like the smell is borderline overpowering with vanilla. It's rounded out with mocha like flavors and a nice bitterness to the finish. I'd like this more if I didn't feel like I had to focus so much to get past vanilla. Real nice feel to this though, creamy and full with good soft carbonation. Overall, a welcome new offering from Maine Beer Company.","Bendurgin","Feb 16, 2011"

4.55,14.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"New seasonal from the guys at MBC. Have eagerly awaiting this one... Pours a robust brown with ruby edges, a nice and hearty beige head, nice life, nice lacing. Really worth a few whiffs - the nose is subtle at first, with coco and subtle vanilla, followed by some mellow coffee and chocolate. Flavors meld so well - light roastyness allows the vanilla to poke through amidst the toasty coco and chocolate, with nice coffee undertones, nutty, and a dry and dusty hop finish. Low bitterness. Super smooth texture, nice and mellow, with the perfect dry finish to balance. For the style (stout) this is supremely drinkable. This beer has the nice balance of plenty of interesting flavors and complexity, while pulled off with subtlety, yet still remains a refreshing and drinkable stout. Can't wait to see what comes next.","twelvsies","Feb 10, 2011"
