4.35,4.8,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Overall – 94.3 (Excellent): Tasting this beer again after a brief hiatus reminded me of what I was missing, similar to a short breakup with a girlfriend. Holy smokes, what a fantastic beer! If you remotely enjoy chocolate OR stouts (and especially both), you owe it to yourself to sample this beverage. Extremely easy to drink, delicious, and delivering on every level, there is no doubt that several bottles of this will find it to my basement to age. Incredible!","TheCraftBrewReview","Feb 19, 2015"
4.12,-0.7,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"A great gift brought by guests to a dinner party. Ads stouts are her favorite beer style, my wife got to contribute to this review....a rarity. Pours a deep black licorice with a pretty coffee brown bubbly head that dissipates, but returns with a gentle swirl of the glass. The scent is of toasted malt and leaves a reminder of chocolate milk. The taste is of bitter dark chocolate, a hint of coffee, and a faint caramel aftertaste. Some creaminess, but also a nice carbonation. Slightly sweet, especially late. We've had chocolatier stouts, but this was nicely balanced and really quite well done. I hope to get this again, but I'll likely have to share it.","RobbDogg","Feb 18, 2015"

Stuff pours a little lighter then an IMP with a larger toffee colored head that keeps its shape.

I think the ibu on this new version is underrated but this stout is great being as it's not an imperial/double stout it has a slightly thin mouthful and a modest 6%abv but it makes up with chocolaty goodness from beginning to end.. I recommend this beer and I believe it shines as it warms as do most stouts I recommend a slight chill our pull it out of the fridge and let it sit and warm a bit I enjoy it from a balloon so it warms in my hand.. the slight complexity that is there can be easily missed if it's to cold and it will really mask the bitter chocolate taste...","PhillyJ","Nov 02, 2014"

Tons of cocoa and dark chocolate along with hints of milk chocolate, oats, and vanilla.  The taste follows suit with the chocolate again dominating, but with a distinct bitterness.  Hints of cocoa, caramel, leather, vanilla, oats, and roasty coffee.  The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with medium carbonation and a dry, bittersweet finish.  Overall, this surprised me as I was expecting a sweet and syrupy artificial mess, but instead got a much more natural tasting chocolate stout.","beerdrifter","Aug 19, 2014"

Nose was (guess) chocolate, candied sugar, caramel nougat, and a little rum-like ester. All were appetizing to smell, but none were presented or combined in an impressive way. Taste was (guess) chocolate and candied sugar. Had a dry hoppy finish but of the bitter sort you'd find in good chocolate. Even better was its almost fruity espresso flavors in the middle of its flavor profile. The mouthfeel was thin with a fizz that came from the head and hops. A very straightforward beer but by no means boring and one of the better stouts out of the six famous and beeradvocate highly-ranked ones I've had recently. Simple and simply edible, this is a tasty stout I am welcome to return to. With a way too easy mouthfeel, and skilled brewing, its a beer version of milk chocolate.","WoodBrew","Aug 02, 2014"

I poured the beer and it looked fantastic. I am a fan of stouts so I had high hopes. I took a whiff and the beer impressed me once again. It was only when I proceeded to take a taste that I realized that this was not my brew. The initial taste was delightful but then easily overpowered by strong hints of cocoa powder. I read the bottle and they hit the nail on the head by describing it as ""chocolate truffle."" Too choco for me. I would recommend to a friend. Merely for kicks- as a novelty beer.","Gabriel_Vaughn","Jun 04, 2014"

Just a slight bitter aftertaste, which is from the various hops. The ""9 ingredients: 2-Row, C-120 & Chocolate Malts, Cascade Hops, Rolled Oats, Roasted Barley, Chocolate, Free Range Coastal Water and Pacman Yeast"" is written on the right side of the bottle. If you like chocolate stouts that is loaded with taste, then this is for you. First 'Rogue 'that I have had and they make several different types. Overall a enjoyable brew.

Is was smooth and creamy with just the perfect level of carbonation and a pleasantly bitter finish. It may sound crazy but it had the after taste of a tootsie roll. I have not had a lot of chocolate stouts, but after this one, I will be seeking them out.","chefcurtlee","Jan 05, 2014"

Taste is good, not quite as rich as I'd hoped for so looking forward to trying the Double Chocolate Stout. Honestly, this tastes like a Hershey's kiss, I just wish it had more of an alcohol zip the the Southern Tier Creme brûlée. Great beer though my wife likes, would definitely buy again.","BradT","Jan 05, 2014"

Basically, that was the difference, and I thought the previous 12 ingredient version was better, more unique. The new version definitely has a smoother, more delicious chocolate flavor, but without that hop background, it tastes just like any other quality chocolate stout. The original 12-ingredient had something special in that combination.","shigg85","Nov 17, 2013"

Flavor is surprisingly mild considering the aroma. I'm thinking this may require considerable warming to get the most out of it. For now, I'm getting a well balanced blend of roasted malt (tending toward coffee) and earthy, citric hops. A delightful mocha haze sneaks up late in the aftertaste. Some milk chocolate is there, but it's very faint in comparison to the more acrid elements. To be honest, I'd be hard-pressed to brand this a chocolate stout when I think of the many stouts out there with a far great chocolate character. Even Rogue's own Shakespeare Stout has a stronger chocolate presence in my opinion. I had this a couple years ago and recall having much the same impression. The mouthfeel is pretty zippy, perhaps a little too much so for the style. With that said, this remains a drinkable stout with a nice roasted character, albeit short on the eponymous chocolate.","MaximalC","Apr 01, 2013"

I am still yet to try their double chocolate though, so who knows...","StonedTrippin","Mar 29, 2013"

Smell was baking chocolates up front with semi-sweet chocolate on the back. Fits the name and that's what I was looking for. Maybe some burnt malts stuffed in there, but huge chocolate. Taste was melted chocolate bars with a little hop finish. Again, some dark fruits/malts are there, but the chocolate takes center stage on this chocolate stout bomb. I get a blend of different chocolate which is nice. Baking, semi sweet and dark combination. Feel is middle of the road and quite silky/creamy. Mild carbonation on this which is just fine. Overall- It is what it is! A chocolate stout with not a ton of bells and whistles. If you like chocolate in your beer, this is right there for you. Not over the top, but a good sipper and pretty enjoyable. A solid effort that hit the spot for me. Not the best out there, but work the try-","TheDinger","Dec 22, 2012"

3.88,-6.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Kind of surprised with this one. Was expecting a creamier brew. This one is a standard American stout, done very well, but for me it doesn't totally live up to the name. The chocolate is there, but it's very bittersweet. I say baker's chocolate and really high percentage cacao bars. A whole different kind of bitter compared to hops, but quite bitter. No doubt it's a unique one, and a very good one, but as far as chocolate stouts go, Young's handily beats this one because it is brewed in the milk/sweet style, which I think lends itself better to the chocolate. I feel like I'm kind of underscoring it, but you get my point.","TheRealBigC","Aug 17, 2012"

High drinkability even as it warms a bit. Not bad paired up with chocolate frozen yogurt and dark chocolate coffee beans, in this case (the latter especially blends in with the aftertaste, which seems of chocolaty coffee grinds to me). In the end, a burnt cocoa brew that is not too sweet and is very easy to drink. I want to try Rogue's double of this. ","TBoneJones","Aug 14, 2012"

Smell is of chocolate malt, cocoa powder, chocolate syrup, and milk chocolate aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, char, unsweetened dark chocolate, cocoa powder, and raw cocoa nibs. There is a high level of roasty bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

Pours fairly pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger dense mocha colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, toffee, caramel, molasses, roasted malt, vanilla, cream, and light herbal hops. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength; very dessert-like. Taste of chocolate, roasted malt, toast, oats, caramel, toffee, cream, light coffee, earth, and herbal hops. Fair amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toffee, toast, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness; with a good amount of chocolate flavor and roast. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a fairly creamy, silky, and lightly prickly mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is a very nice chocolate stout. Good roasted and chocolate flavors, with good balance of sweetness; and very smooth to drink.","superspak","Jul 01, 2012"

3.93,-5.3,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Rogue Chocolate Stout, 22 oz bomber: The body is deep brown with a touch of translucence. The head is huge, dark in color, a wonder to behold. Aroma is massively chocolate. Once the head settles down, it’s time to dig in. Well, chocolate is the overpowering flavor. This makes for a nice dessert beer, but probably would not pair well with food. Other flavors come and go; coffee has some prominence. There is a bit of bitter to the aftertaste, surprise, like dark chocolate. Not a super thick brew, but not highly drinkable because of the strong chocolate flavor. I would love to try this brew fresh on tap someday. Overall it is a novelty beer worth a taste, but is too chocolaty to make the stable of great stouts that you look forward to trying again and again.","iSip","May 30, 2012"

4.03,-2.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"22oz bottle, pours jet black with a milk chocolatey head that holds good retention and leaves tons of lacing on the glass. Aromas are cocoa, chocolate Twizzlers, kind of musty, with hot chocolate powder. Tastes are chocolatey again, with molasses, oatmeal cookie, chocolate Twizzler again, with some hop on the finish that prickles the tongue. Mouth-feel is full-bodied, smooth and creamy, with a slight dryness on the finish with some dark cocoa powder. Overall, I have wanted to try this for years, but never did. It's good, but I'm not big on the artificial chocolate flavors I'm picking up here. Luckily it has so many other things going for it, that they can be ignored to a degree.","barnzy78","Feb 08, 2012"

The taste is exceptional, with dark bitter chocolate being dominant. Roasted malts abound. The mouthfeel is awesome, because it's thick enough, unlike some stouts that can be watery. Overall, this is pretty much what I'll compare all other chocolate stouts to. It's not cloyingly sweet or watery like all of the others I've had. It's delicious and very drinkable.","JuicesFlowing","Nov 26, 2011"

4.01,-3.4,5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours pretty black with a creamy two finger tan head. Tons of tiny bubbles in the head. Aroma is mostly bittersweet chocolate with trace amounts of espresso. Smells really nice. The taste is along the same lines as the smell, but much more bitter than I expected (which isn't a bad thing). This reminds me of a higher cocoa percentage chocolate bar. Mouthfeel is a bit disappointing as it is pretty thin. The carbonation is a little too high for the style, but isn't off-putting. Overall, very nice stout. This isn't as much of a dessert beer as you'd might expect. There is not a lot of sweetness here and the body is also lighter than you would expect.I would have liked to have seen a little more sweetness to help balance out the bitterness. This isn't an absurdly bitter beer, but I tend to like some sweetness in my chocolate beer. Good stout and highly recommended.","hmf05","Nov 04, 2011"

4.03,-2.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a near ink black with an extremely thick dark brown cap. Great retention with loads of lace. The aroma is of semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. This is pretty straightforward. The flavor profile mimics the nose. Semi-sweet bakers chocolate up front before a pleasant roast and coffee flavor take over. The finish is more of a cocoa powder, granular type of feel. A bit syrupy, full bodied. Smooth, with just that bit of granulation in the finish. Overall, this is a solid stout. It definitely hits its mark.","ColForbinBC","Sep 30, 2011"

3.5,-15.7,4,4,3,4,3.5,"This pours a pitch black color with a decent mocha colored head, but with large bubbles which quickly dissipate down to a thin layer, its a good looking beer but I prefer the look of the stouts with a nice frofty bubbled head (the one with the dense thin bubbles). The smell was pretty good, chocolate with roasted malts. The feel was good medium to thick, although it was also a little grimy and gritty. The taste left something to be desired though. The main taste was an artificial gritty/dirty/grimy chocolate flavor maybe like a Hersey chocolate syrup (the stuff you pour into milk), it was a little too sweet and I didn't get the normal roasted malt bitterness, just this grimy sweetness (gone are the great dark chocolate flavors). You could probably take a Guinness draft and load Hershey's Chocolate syrup into it and get basically the same poor taste. Overall this was decent, but I'd take a Brooklyn Chocolate Stout over this one every time (and they cost less). I definitely don't understand why this is rated so high.","DavidST","Sep 23, 2011"

The flavor was pretty good, I enjoyed the slight bitterness it had in the back end after all the sweetness faded. The mouthfeel like most Rogue ales to me seemed a little on the thin side.

4.2,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"On the tongue, the chocolate taste is *very* apparent--more so than perhaps any other chocolate stout I've tried. In fact, the brew tastes, in many ways, like sucking on a Tootsie Pop while sipping on, say, Godiva's chocolate liqueur. Which is not to say that it's bad in any way; in fact, it's quite good. And I don't normally like chocolate stouts. There are, of course, other flavors in the beer as well: some nice chocolate malts that give a lovely almost-burnt-grain taste; some deep caramels; and just at the edge, perhaps a hint of dark fruit esters. Hops are kept to a minimum, and are just enough to add a nice bitterness that takes the edge off of the sweetness of the chocolate. But make no mistake: chocolate is the primary flavor. It's the first thing you'll taste, and the flavor that will linger on your tongue the longest.","jondeelee","Aug 13, 2011"

A fair bit of body with this stout, frothy tan head with excellent lacing on the pint glass. Smells of bittersweet chocolate, bitter coffe, pepper, roasty walnuts evident. I get alot of the walnut taste with this, a little chocolate, very earthy and its getting more earthy / roasty as this pint glass ends. Aftertaste is fairly bitter and nutty. I expected this a bit sweeter but a fine beer to relax with and watch a movie. At 650ml per bottle, when you have finished your pint you have a few more litres to look forward to!!

4.5,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O- I enjoyed this beer immensely. It's similar in some ways to the Shakespeare Stout (especially the mouthfeel/carbonation). I like the fact that even though it definitely is a Chocolate stout, the flavoring is balanced and mild enough so that you can drink this without it feeling like you're drinking dessert. I also appreciate the fact that they were able to avoid it getting into mocha/coffee territory - not that I don't enjoy the coffee taste, but it is somewhat commonplace for stouts of this nature to rely too heavily on coffee to cover the alcohol bite. This is a beer that accomplishes it's style with flying colors. I will definitely be coming back to this one.","seabass87","Jun 30, 2011"

There's a lot to be said for those qualities in a brew, and so I've got to notch up the ""overall"" rating to a 4.0, where otherwise it might be around a 3 out of 5.

4.5,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. I've had and thoroughly enjoyed the Double Chocolate offering from Rogue, so I figured I'd give this a try finally. The beer pours a nice, viscous looking jet black with a thick, dense, foamy milk-chocolate colored head. Aromas are heavy in milk chocolate, with only the slightest hint of bitter coffee. It's like someone poured a splash of coffee into a chocolate milkshake. The beer is mid-bodied; a little light and crisp, but still fairly smooth in mouth. The flavor is a blend of dark chocolate bitterness and milk chocolate sweetness. Can't really go wrong with that in this house...I am a fat kid with a wicked sweet tooth! The coffee highlights are minimal, but present, and they peek their head out towards the aftertaste portion of your experience. Bitterness in the aftertaste does a good job of balancing all the sweetness throughout and closing the door on a very wonderful beer experience overall. The finish is smooth on the flavor and crisp in the body. Once again, very well balanced. This is a strong showing from the Rogue Brewery!","GarthDanielson","May 09, 2011"

Came out almost black, with a tan 2 finger head. As soon as I picked up the pint glass I smelled the chocolate--very sweet smelling. After tasting, however, i was pleasantly surprised at the taste--more of a bittersweet chocolate. I only had one, as it was a quick meal, but it certainly could have been more--the alcohol was barely noticeable, and it was not nearly as heavy as other stouts. Next time, I'll try to pair it more appropriately with food (pizza was an odd choice), but I am guessing that will not be too far in the future.","cneville","Feb 24, 2011"

The beer pours up with a monstrous tan head, maybe 2-3 fingers, with a pitch black body. The mouth feel is very creamy like, fairly thick but good. Taste is what you would expect, dark chocolate, coffee, the smokey aftertaste, not too much though. I have had many ""chocolate stout"" beers and this one is one the the few I have had that really has the feel taste of chocolate.

The nose comprises, you guessed it, chocolate, along with some seemingly obligatory roasted malts. The taste merely sprinkles on the cocoa powder while simultaneously skimping on the roast as well. And, unfortunately, just like the smell, there ain't nuthin' else happenin' up in here. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish.

Being that we have to be at work in about 8 hours, he decided, against my better judgment, that he needed to start making the walk up the hill to better prepare himself for the morning. I'm still not sure what this was all about. But, it was a free beer. As it sat for 23 seconds unmanned, I pondered my course of action. I was then able to determine that this was clearly an early birthday present from John Maier himself in some sort of misguided attempt to assuage me into liking Rogue beers. I obliged him. The milky chocolate dominates the beer, at first a delightful treat fading into a cloying sweet Nesquik chocolate drink. It smells great, thick chocolate rising into the air. But the chocolate is compromised somehow. It is no Theo's chocolate, a thing of pure glory. Sort of a fake chocolate luster. ""Natural chocolate flavoring."" What was wrong with chocolate? Too chocolatey? Not chocolatey enough? Whatever, it is what it is. Just a thick and sweet malty brew, not awful, not undrinkable, just not worth spending my money on.

Major milk chocolate aroma, reminds me of hot chocolate sitting in a mug that hasn't been heated up yet. Flavors are huge chocolate notes and sweetness, touch of roasted malt flavor and smoke.

Go ahead and read the other reviews to get an idea about pourability, aroma, taste, etc. I'm going to go ""outside the box"" and offer a suggestion.

I think the one thing that kept this from getting a 5 in taste is that it doesn't taste enough like good chocolate but more like Nestle's cocoa powder.

It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I loved Yoo-Hoo as a child and this brough back some feel-good memories while drinking it.

Overall, not too bad but no as good as some other chocolate beers.","kbutler1","Dec 11, 2010"

4.3,3.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into....not even sure what this glass is. It's a big Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. 22 oz glass with a scary shrimp smiling at me. Pours a black ale with a hefty amount of beige foam which clings nicely to the side. Aroma has the nice chocolate scents some roasted malts, hot chocolate (with marshmellows) and slight orange whiffs. Great malty, chocolate, roasty taste. The cocoa taste really lingers and a little smoke is also produced afet the swallow. Good stuff. Agitate it a little on each sip to get some nice foam with each swallow. An adventure each time. Great drink on a cold day or around a campfire....or anytime.","kaseydad","Dec 09, 2010"

However, from my personal experience, I recommend either pairing this beer with an equally robust meal or finishing one off as a dessert at the end of the night; you will find the bittersweet finish turning your palate off to anything else of an equally rich variety.","RossCain","Dec 03, 2010"

4.25,2.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The palate opens with an intense cocoa character, very Hershey's cocoa like with a noticeable undercurrent of sweetness. The level of cocoa here is pretty darned perfect, balancing beautifully the roasted malt character that comes through on the mid-palate. Not as fruity as the nose would suggest, though there's just a touch of raisin present here. The oatmeal does present a little smoothness on the mid-palate, but the carbonation does take away a little bit from that aspect. Sweetness is almost entirely cocoa-derived without a noticeable caramel or brown sugar component present. The finish is quite excellent with flavors of burnt grain, cocoa and a little sweetness. However, there's also just a touch of a nut-like bitterness present. The other aspects of the mouthfeel are excellent too. Medium in body with a rather smooth, silky feel, the carbonation is a little high for my liking. Drinkability is definitely up there, by keeping the sweetness and alcohol low, this is almost as drinkable as water. I've drunk half my bomber in about 10 minutes. Excellent stuff, I'd LOVE to try this on cask.","DefenCorps","Nov 11, 2010"

Also a slight fruit note in the nose after a bit. Taste has a bit of hop bite right up front, but then goes to chocolate. Finish is dry and some bitterness with chocolate notes.

A very nice lingering bitter hop finish surprised me. A nice mouthfilling medium carbonation that sticks to your palate, however it finishes slightly watery. Could use a bit more body.

The mouthfeel is a lot thinner than it looks/smells. I expected this to be much thicker consistency with a lot less carbonation. This is where this beer falls off for my tastes. I would have loved this stout to be a little bit sweeter and more body to it. Although it wasn't as heavy as I would have liked it, it proves to be a much more drinkable stout than one would expect.

I like this bottle - lots of good info printed on it: ingredients, food pairings, IBU's, etc. (no freshness date, though). Pours black with a rich, two-finger hazelnut head that leaves patches of lace and manages a thin layer of retention. Aroma is dominated by chocolatey goodness, but there are also some light roasted coffee notes, oats and minty hops in the nose. The taste starts with a touch of minty hops, which quickly gives way to roasted malts and dark chocolate. Finish is sweet chocolate; there's a bit of lasting bitterness (with some light citrus notes) - the light roasted flavor lingers on the palate, too. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied; its a little chewy and there's a light zing from the carbonation. Personally, this is one of my favorite stouts and it's even more enjoyable on draft - its chocolatey and a touch hoppy. Probably my favorite Rogue ale.","jpro","Mar 28, 2010"

The smell is light chocolate, which, when tasted, translates about the same: a tad underwhelming.

This is a great chocolate and coffee representation in the aroma. This brew is missing a little of the toasty nuttiness in the flavor that I was expecting from the aroma. The mouth feel isn't as hearty as I had expected from the pour but far from thin and still properly bodied. The bitterness of the cocoa persists throughout jumping up and down on the pallet.

I just wish there was a bit more robustness. The taste is good but not surprising or astounding. The hops, always well done in Rogue products, really take center stage and really leave the faint chocolate flavors as more of a side note. But still... good. It feels fine enough, though it is a little watery for my taste in stouts. Little carbonation is present. So all in all, a good drink and a good beer.

Chocolate chips, chocolate brownies and roasty black malt in the taste with a wet and bitter finish. Not chewy enough. This beer is absolutely fantastic for the style but IMO can't hold a candle to bigger Chocolate Imperial Stouts like the Lost Abbey Serpent Stout. Carbonation is a little too plain like a club soda, meaning it doesn't mesh well with the style. Could use less bitterness in the finish.","natelocc787","Oct 09, 2009"

This doesn't taste like a beer, this taste more like something out of a Hershey's syrup bottle. A slight bitter aftertaste makes its appearance at the end, but who really cares about the hops - my mind is still set on the chocolatey goodness.

Mostly coffee and stale, bitter coffee at that. Very little of the aroma translated into taste, but some of the alcohol did and not to the beer's benefit. ChocoRogue looked oily, but ended up watery on the tongue. Like a lot of stouts, not high drinkability, but not due to a heavy, alcohol reasons.

The smell is awsome, full and deep, the chocolate is definetley there, reminds me of trufles, fondue and strawberries with chocolate. Flavor has a strong hoppy character, that gives a pleasant contrast to teh aroma. As the lable states, there are hints of oatmeal, chocolate and truffle. Aftermouth is also very enjoyable.

Every brewer could take a lesson in the head retention that this beer shows. A half inch cap of sandy brown froth all the way through the session.

2.95,-28.9,4.5,4.5,2,4,2,"Poured from a 650 ML bottle into a brandy snifter, this beer presented itself well. A deep dark burnt umber with a very decent mocha colored head that to some degree lingered to the end. Aroma of chocolate...period. The smell was pure chocolate and lacked the other nuances of a typically well done chocolate stout. Stir in a spoonful of dark coco into your next porter or stout and you'll get the idea. The taste was, frankly, disappointing. An unpleasant bitterness lingered after each sip. Once you get past the chocolate, you're kind of drinking a Guinness with a little more body. Whether this bitterness comes from bakers chocolate or a big shot of hops...or both, I couldn't tell. But to my palate, this stuff is unpleasant. The bitter aftertaste lasts until you brush your teeth. From previous reviews, I expected better. I'll take a Young's Double Chocolate, thank you.","theBubba","Feb 18, 2009"

4.25,2.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Taste is also excellent. I feel like chocolate beers can be very overdone, but Rogue strikes a great balance here. The healthy bitterness of this beer definitely contributes to that balance. Malty, not overly sweet as the aroma may suggest. Tons of dark, bittersweet chocolate. Usually I get more coffee with these types of stouts, but here the chocolate is actually an ingredient. Tasty, but the mouthfeel was not as chewy and coating as I wanted it to be.

The sweet scent of chocolate is apparent with a malty sweetness as well. A touch of grassiness at the end of each scent. The chocolate and malt combine to make an assault on the taste buds, being very dominant. Then it gradually blending to a grapefruit bitterness, that is not to overbearing at the end. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky, with a syrupy clingingness at the end. This maybe a beer for breakfast. WOW!

3.93,-5.3,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Picked this brew up the other day, I was not sure what to think based on the amount of chocolate flavor that I figured would be there. The brew poured to a black color with a thick lighter brown head that had great retention and lacing. The aroma was dominated by the chocolate aroma, bittersweet. Also adding to the bitterness was the hops, with 60+ IBUs I figure that this would add to that perceived aroma? Also was a mild aroma of coffee and slightly burnt grains. The taste was dominated by the same bittersweet chocolate that was picked up on the nose, but also there was a nice malt flavor that seemed to add a dryness. That dryness was mixed with an ample hop presence at the tail. I feel that the flavors of this brew where good, it (bomber bottle) was just to much for me. The flavors just seemed to get to me after a while. I made my way through it but it took time and at the end some effort. The feel was a little syrupy with adequate carbonation. This brew is clearly worth trying and probably would be great going along with a chocolate type dessert. For me I would clearly rather have the Shakespeare Stout from Rogue.","Stimack","Jan 19, 2009"

Dark chocolate, coffee bean, even caramel, touches of plum or cherry fruit, even you can zen out, a nicely bitter hoppiness appears. In the mouth it's full-bodied yet in no way heavy, nimble as it has some serious carbonation to keep it from sinking too too deeply. Sure, unsweetened chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, it delivers what the label says. And, as the nose subtly suggests, there's some hoppy spine here as well, not all about the sweetness. Moderate length on finish, as if crafted to be so. No noticeable flaws.","farrago","Jan 17, 2009"

I have not been the biggest fan of some chocolate- and coffee-flavored beers, but this one really nails the balance of flavors, never tastes artificial and still has a sweet, dessert-like flavor. The beer looks just phenomenal. It's a rich black. If you hold something colored matte black to it, you can see the faintest shade of brown, giving body to the utter blackness. The beer is entirely opaque, as far as I can tell with a wide glass and a strong light source. The head is thick and rich and leaves wonderful sticky lacing. The beer smells like expensive cocoa powder mixed with cacao nibs and a dash of roasted coffee beans. The flavor is wonderful. The chocolate is perfectly used. The beer isn't too sweet or too chocolatey. There are good mineral and earthy hop notes. The malt backbone is big and strong. It's an enormous flavor for a stout that clocks in at a mere 6% abv, a trifling amount compared to some of the Imperial versions. The lush, creamy feel is the finishing touch. This beer and Rogue's Shakespeare Stout are both such incredible stouts. They're among the best of all stouts, regardless of size, and remain affordable amongst the increasing prices of micro-brewed beers.","popery","Jan 05, 2009"

Taste mirrored the hinted aromas even with the bitter, chocolate aftertaste. Now the mouthfeel does make it seem pretty frappey, but I felt it was way to bubbly and airy, almost like the consistency of a McDonald's milkshake.

A semi-hard pour reveals a very dark brown, almost black brew with a rolling and dense dark tan head that carries itself proud to a slow finish and leaves a good lacing all around to remind you of itself. Smell is quite complex with sweet and dark chocolates, malts and caramel upfront and an essence of burnt wood and pine in the background. Tastes of dark chocolates, molasses, licorice, toffee and a good hit of bitterness and some slight smokiness to finish things off. Carbonation is just right for this medium to full-bodied, yet highly drinkable stout. Rogue always does me right.","stephens101","May 29, 2008"

I mean, there are hints of other malts in there and hops, but putting my nose in my glass was akin to unwrapping a chocolate bar and smelling it. Not only does the beer have a very pronounced chocolate taste, but it has a dryer feel to it, as if there were coffee and/or roasted malts in it. A smooth beer overall with some hop catching you on the backbite. I detected mild fruit flavors, but that could be my imagination.

Not quite as sweet in the taste but the chocolate is definitely still there. Black and roasted malts come in as well, along with cocoa and citric hops in a light, bitter finish.

An aggressive earthy malt Hersey's dark chocolate mocha character that leads you to believe that there is serious sweetness to follow. The mouth feel is adequately carbonated with a solid note of hops. Full bodied and full flavored, the roast mocha comes out from beneath the semi-sweet chocolate taste and lingers nicely.

The first aroma is chocolate, not chocolate malt but chocolate bar chocolate. Who doesnt like that aroma? Tastes like chocolate and oats with a wonderfully hoppy bitter finish. Myself, I dont detect the citrus aroma of the cascade hops that I know (from reading the label) are in there. Bitterness - yes ; citrus  no. Mouthfeel is thin and clean with enough carbonation to be refreshing. Overall a great beer, if you havent tried yet and intend to, you are in for a treat.","CDBeerDisappear","Dec 24, 2007"

Taste has a slight smooth chocolate taste with a very nice hop bitterness that compliments it very well. Mouth feel is a little thin, but thicker than a porter, so it passes with a 4.5.

4.32,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured from bomber into chalice and as soon as I opened it I could smell the chocolate. This is a black beer with a thick, mocha colored head, good retention and some lacing. Smell is of chocolate as expected but I was suprised to get a whiff of hops too. The hops are more pronounced when the beer is colder, as it warms the chocolate becomes dominant. Taste is of chocolate as well but a nice, rich, creamy chocolate, almost like a syrup. Some toasted grains and a tiny bit of hops (again, while its colder). Low carbonation and a thick, creamy mouthfeel. A pleasant, somewhat oily chocolate aftertaste left behind. Lower ABV makes this pretty drinkable. Overall a great beer and the best example of chocolate in beer I have tasted yet. As I review this is has a solid spot in the top 100, while I dont know if it will climb much higher, I certainly dont see it falling off the list. A true classic.","bunnyhustle","Dec 13, 2007"

The chocolate nose reminded me of chocolate syrup for lattes, which is never as good as Hershey's syrup--which isn't very good. The taste was more offensive--like someone dumped a bunch of flavoring into what could have been a good beer. Well, someone did.

Then it fades away into a sweeter chocolate taste that slowly turns into the aftertaste of deep dark chocolate and coffee with a lot of the bitter cocoa taste. Not too much carbonation with the beer but I think that it fits the creamy smooth nature of the beer though pretty well. A really drinkable beer too because the taste is just great and you don't get tired of the chocolate taste at all since it is not a sickingly sweet chocolate taste.","jeonseh","Dec 01, 2007"

Not really able to detect anything else, but that's okay. I love chocolate! Taste is also as expected heavy on the chocolate flavor, almost like they added chocolate syrup or copious amounts of cocoa to the beer. The cocoa flavor is very nice, gives it a kind of bakers chocolate flavor, without any noticeable roasted coffee flavors. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, possibly due to the oats used in the recipe, possibly due in part to Rogue's proprietary yeast. Whatever the cause, it is quite enjoyable. Drinkability is extremely high, unless you are just against chocolate flavor. Try it with ice cream as a float. It's delicious.

Not very complex, but right now i dont care as the balance of this beer to the style is solid. A joke that its ranked top 50 beers in the world, but there are a lot of beers that are very wrongly classified. Whats important is that this is a well done beer and nothing to be scoffed at.

The chocolate flavor dissipates slightly and lets malts and roasted barley take control until the finish.

The taste fades into a smooth, coffee-like aftertaste. Very nice beer that would go well with a chocolate dessert. It's not too overpowering and the creaminess really compliments it.

There is a slight chocolate-hop residual taste. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a full, creamy carbonation. Overall, this is a drinkable and desirable beer.","gmfessen","Jul 14, 2007"

Good balance between the sweet and bitter of the tastes. Medium mouthfeel - perfect for this type of stout, although I wouldn't mind it being thicker. Overall, a wonderfully drinkable stout.

Good amout of bittering balancing the sweet. Not really a sipper, but not something you'd want to slam either; drinkability is excellent. A little heavy on the belly, but it's a chocolate stout, so that's understandable. Great quality; nothing fake or cloying here. Definitely would try again!

I would have to rate this as one the best smelling ,for the style, that I have ever smelled. Doesn't seem to taste as sweet as I would have expected. Has a nice dark, very bitter chocolate fell through most of the drink, finishes with a burnt toast or kind of an oatmeal stout character, with just a hint of vanilla. This is a very full brew with minimal carbonation, perfect for the style. I may just add this to my regular drinking list.

The smell is dominated by (what else) chocolate, but it is a sweet, milk chocolate smell with hints of vanilla. This smells better than some chocolate baked goods I've smelled. The taste follows suit - big dark chocolate flavor with a nice roasted oat finish, absolutely delicious. There is a some carbonation here, which I think could be toned down a little bit. This beer could use a bit more creaminess. I returned from Easter brunch a poured this for dessert & boy, I wish I had a couple more. This is one helluva beer - excellent stuff.

Color is dead black, with just a hint of brown along the seams of the glass. Basically the best looking beer I've ever seen. Nose is almost all the way coffee, some alcohol hints, and a good amount of sweet chocolately mocha. Taste is intense, to say the least. Lots of roasted malt and coffee bitterness up front. Nice citrus comes in too, but not too much. Them comes the sweeter chocolate on the tip of the tongue. Ends with a nice mix of hoppy bitterness and malty sweet; doesn't overwhelm with bitterness like the Shakespeare.

Mouthfeel is thick, but not unpleasant. This one coats the mouth a bit, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The only downside to this beer for me is the drinkability. The richness of it is honestly a bit too much for me. Very good, but I would almost have to down this one as shots. If you have the constitution to overcome the sheer richness of it, and like chocolate stouts, I'd heartily recommend this one. If you're like me, and like something not quite so overpowering, I'd suggest splitting it with a friend. Delicious beer, just hard to drink.","StargherKing","Mar 17, 2007"

Poured deep black as night witha big creamy colored, and audibly fizzing head that quickly faded leaving behind a half and inch of thick bubbles that laste almost to the end. Deep thick brown lace dripped down the glass. Very full looking. Smell was off course dark german chocolate, roasted or smoked smells wafted through as well. Roasted coffee and chocolate mousse as it warmed delighted the senses. Rich, smells like a chocolate dessert, very strong. Tastes followed suit well. Strong roasted chocolate, soo much chocolate, incredible, tasted like smoked pudding, Very nice. Carbonation made it very lively, and a dry finish capped it off very well. This is a big dessert bear, easily the most filling beer I have ever tried. I actually felt bloated after this. No real alcohol at all detected in this, and at a low ABV I wouldn't expect one. Suge huge bold flavors in such a low ABV are a welcome treat and make this very drinkable. The smooth, creamy, full flavor and texture and overall chocolate overload make this the perfect night cap, very well done.","mikesgroove","Feb 24, 2007"

Almost odorless, which was strange. May have been a hint of chocolate in the smell, or it could just be in my mind because of the name. Medium carbonation with a medium/full body. Seemed a little bland for a stout, but the little bit of flavor that was there was very nice. I could certainly taste the chocolate and roasted malts. Good balance of hops too. No taste of alcohol present. Overall, a slightly above average stout that's very drinkable. I'm still stumped by the lack of smell, though, which really brings the score down for this one.","BeerCheese","Feb 23, 2007"

The aroma was an almost indescribable abundance of chocolate with usual stout undertones of roasted barley and subtle coffee, all very overpowered by chocolate, however. The taste was great but just a tad on the bitter side as far as the chocolate was concerned. The mouthfeel was fully tolerable with decent carbonation.

The body is oily black, opaque, seriously does look like an I.S. Smells of subtle light smoky chocolate character, which permeates the totality of this drink. The roasted barley and oaks (as listed on the bottle) manifests and aids nicely to form an earthy well-rounded complexity. The cascades at first were rather forward, but as this warms up they mellow out and the chocolate is allowed to come to the fore. Taste wise this beer is rich bitter chocolate and coffee. Has many flavor components of a sturdy RIS, but simply lacks the strength and thicker mouthfeel. I realize this is not what they were going for, but worth mentioning. The mouthfeel definitely has a literal chocolate residual feel ""made with imported chocolate"". This is very much a worth while stout. The complexity of an Imperial stout, but the strength and mouth feel of a standard stout. Totally worth a drink.","mmcave","Feb 07, 2007"

Overall, I was disappointed by this. The chocolate flavor was a bit flat, almost subdued, and there's not much else going on in this beer to make up for it.

Actually, yes, it smells a little like chocolate milk (in a good way) accompanied by light brown sugar and grainy bread. The taste follows suit with the chocolate presence taking center stage. Big and malty with being overbearing, some very light berry in there too. The finish is pleasantly bitter and dry, and improves as the beers warms. At first the body seems huge but it thins a bit toward the finish, making this beer big and satisfying while remaining easy-drinking.

Months and months went past and not a single bottle was sold but still I thought nothing of it. Finally in late August I decided to make a move and buy the first bottle off the shelf. It turned out to be an outstanding, rich chocolate stout. I first took a few sips directly from the bottle and took in the aroma. I then poured the rest into a glass and noted any taste or smell change once it got a chance to breath. It had a slightly flat taste, probably from sitting on the shelf for so long.

I then waited 20 minutes, and what a difference. Great aroma of chocolate and toffee, smelled like fresh made Turtle candy.

The mouthfeel is not nearly as heavy as you would expect it to be by looking at it. Very good drinkability but not something that you pound 4 of unless your a gorilla or something. I usually take a while to drink my stout but as I got to the bottom of the bottle and it warmed a little the alcohol taste kind of started to take over and there was less of a chocolate taste at that point. But I pretty much enjoyed the whole bottle so no real big complaints. I think it would go great with a nice chocolate desert or it can be desert just by itself! I highly recommend this one if your a fan of stouts!","TheBeerWolf","Sep 08, 2006"

Chocolate is strong, but not tedious, yet more than enough to please the chocoholic beer lover in me. Mouthfeel is a luxurious smooth, satin delight. Almost a romantic affair. Truly a sensual stout. Drinkability is slightly better than average, as I could maybe have a couple of these, but would need something to cut through the sweetness at some point.

3.85,-7.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"This is my first chance to try the Chocolate Stout from Rogue, and if reviews mean anything, this should be a fine stout indeed. 650ml bottle with the embossed Rogue label. What I love about the Rogue bottles is their listing of the actual hops and malts used in the beer--something I have yet to see on any bottle here in Canada. Nice to have the IBU and Plato listed as well. Big whiff of chocolate as soon as I popped the cap. This, like their Mocha Porter, is extremely dark and opaque with hints of dark blue near the edges. The head is large and mocha-coloured, with little dimples of deeper brown/near red. Good tight foam and full sheets of lacing that leave rings on the glass. A fantastic looking stout. The aroma is make-no-mistake chocolate. Nesquick, raisins, and cafe mocha. A syrupy aroma floats around too, akin to tree sap or maple. The hops are really hard to smell, because this is all about the dark cocoa man--in fact, whilst the aroma is appetising, it is uncomplex. Perhaps some hazelnut, a little toffee/caramel, light licorice. Brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate bars....etc. Anything chocolate really. To its credit it smells like fresh, real chocolate and not some stale extract. The beer warms a little and some creamy lactose comes into play as well, complementing the malts. A really lovely malty aroma all in all. Soft and sweet. Cocoa and mocha on the tongue at first, with soft hints of dusty chocolate on the middle and a fairly bitter finish where the hops add their oiliness and a little grassy citrus. The bitterness is actually quite high after a few sips. Tasty malts, with some oat fulness. Licorice, chocolate raisins, and very grainy and dusty malting in the aftertaste. Still, the flavour is not quite as full or as chocolate-filled as I expected. The body feels a little weak--perhaps less smooth than I should like for a chocolate stout. Lingering taste though, with a wonderful roasty dryness. This was very good, but not outstanding. Personally I don't see why it rates so high. A definite case of ""not-living-up-to-the-hype.""","Cwrw","May 04, 2006"

Deep, dark black with mahogany highlights at the edges. The smell is thick and inviting, filled with roastiness and a sweet chocolate aroma similar to a warm brownie or Hershey's syrup. The taste is roasty bitterness up front that gives way to clear as a bell chocolate, slightly bittersweet bakers chocolate, but with a touch of milk chocolate sweetness. There is a creamy creaminess present as well. The roast chocolate notes linger in the mouth. Full bodied and also surprisingly light, with almost no carbonation, but this works.

It takes a backseat to no chocolate stout (I'm looking at you, Brooklyn - you have been matched). The 22 oz. size gives you plenty of time to savor all this beer has to offer.

4.5,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours quite dark-- just about opaque. Big dark tan head leaves nice tracings on the glass. It took me a while to begin drinking this beer because I was having so much fun just smelling it! Rich milk chocolate, faint pipe tobacco, all wrapped up in a general candy aroma-- smells like chocolate eggs with the hard candy shell... smells like Easter! More goodness on the palate: surprisingly airy and floral, followed by a candy sweetness, chocolate, tobacco, then a sturdy roasted bitterness in the finish. Whereas the aroma seems to be all milk chocolate, the flavor takes on more of a dark chocolate/cocoa profile, along with dark fruits as are often found in dark chocolate-- in this case, dark cherries, perhaps. Whereas this baby is loaded with flavor, the palate remains by and large unsmothered, and as such you may be tempted to gulp this brew right down. But don't-- there's too much complexity and too many rewards in here to rush through. Bravo Rogue.","VoodooBrew","Mar 31, 2006"

Taste is loaded with toasted malt but the dark chocolate is also present in large quantities. Taste is sensational with the sweet choclate tastes combining with the roasted malt to form an astonishins delicious taste sensation.

Smell is laced with thick, sweet chocolate, and has a slightly burnt overtone. The smell just gets stronger and sweeter as the beer warms, until it is like a freshly unwrapped chocolate bar. The taste is of dark, roasted malts with plenty of chocolate coming through. Again, the chocolate becomes more palpable as the beer warms up. Mouthfeel is a touch thin, but still has enough body to satisfy, and the drinkability is remarkable for a stout. This goes down easier than the macro lager I was given at a party last night.

4.43,6.7,4.5,4,5,4,4,"Impenetrable black with a massive creamed-coffee froth, smooth and undulating. Sweet cocoa aromas predominate -- but subtly -- over a roasted dark malt presence. There is an underlying and unexpected bitterness -- perceived most strongly in the finish and aftertaste -- that pervades the roasted coffee malt flavors and chocolate sweetness. I want to say this peculiar bitterness comes from the cocoa, but subsequent burps yield a distinct Cascade flavor. Amazing complexity of tastes acheived here. Silky smooth mouthfeel; medium to full body. Not something I'd go for very frequently, mainly because of the special chocolate flavor that is the main event of this beer, but nevertheless, an formidable and worthy accomplishment by the geniuses at Rogue.","orfeu","Feb 21, 2006"

The chocolate is actually fairly sweet like cocoa powder of a hershey bar. First sip reveals a fairly thick body and very mild carbonation. Nice and smooth beer. Then the flavor, things go down a little here IMO. The beer is very sweet chocolate flavored like eating a candy bar over and over. By about mid pint it gets to be very cloying and not very enjoyable. Maybe with some fruit or vanilla ice cream but with a dinner it is just too much sweet chocolate. Of course if you really dig that this is for you. I am turned off by the overdose of chocolate and wish it was some more roasted notes or coffee to balance the sweetness.","sulldaddy","Feb 14, 2006"

Taste is powerful chocolate and malt, hints of hazelnut and berries, doesn't deliver as well as the aroma implies, but still very good. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied, moderate to heavy carbonation, maybe a little too carbonated.

Perhaps, but this is up there. And as it warms, I only become more impressed. The great thing is, the chocolate taste doesn't overpower the beer taste, nor visa versa, that is, the chocalate and malts are balance each other almost perfectly. As far as mouthfeel goes, its interesting, because it gives you a little phiz in the beginning, is smooth through the middle, then gives you some tingle during the aftertaste with choclaty goodness to leave you wanting more.

The malts are also a little toasty smelling, but mostly hidden by the sweet smell of chocolate.

The mouthfeel is full, robust, and creamy. Its an experience. Light bitterness in the finish as a balance. This one is a wonderful, no-nonsense piece of art.

4.58,10.4,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"I bought this and Young's double chocolate on the same trip in order to get my chocolate stout fix. I drank the Young's a few nights ago and was bitterly dissapointed, I don't feel that young's is up to the hype. This beer however is about as prefect as I could imagine from a chocolate stout. Pours as black as any beer i've seen with a frothy mocha colored head which was moderate but left nice lacing, Aroma was soft and subtle but difinitely chocolatey. Doesn't really even seem like smelling beer, it is so subtle and candylike. Taste is just right, chocolate is definitely the key here but it changes to mocha and then to coffee in the finish. I was worried that this would be too sweet but it is perfectly balanced and with each taste I respect what Rogue have done here that much more. Truly a world class effort, I suspect this is now the bar by which any chocolate stout will be judged.","masikon","Dec 21, 2005"

This beer pours a jet black and leaves a silky brown head that looks like you poured too much vanilla in your whipped cream. As I smell this beer all the aromas I talked about milk chocolate, brown butter(butterscotch), coffee, floural hops, caramel, sugar, vanilla, are all on display in this beer. The taste of this beer just explodes on your palate. It starts with a vanilla chocolate sweetness then moves to a bitter hop kick followed by a coffee essence and finally finishes with a silky smooth butterscotch aftertaste. This is a fantastic stout I'm sad I took this long to get to it, I will not make that mistake again.","Franchise","Dec 19, 2005"

There is also some molasses sweetness hiding underneath it all, which in my opinion really completes this brew. That's all I get here, but the interplay is done to perfection. The finish is mildly bitter and dry from the chocolate and the acidity of the malt.

The head is mocha in color and had large pockets of air within exagerating the thick frothy texture. The smell is sweet and grainy heavy on chocolate and malt, this is decieving, understood when the flavor hits your tongue. This beer does not taste nearly as sweet as it smells, the light sugary flavor of the chocolate and malt is balanced more than adequately by an excellent hop base.

It starts off with a semi-sweet chocolate but then blends seamlessly into the gentle roasted bitteness of the stout and finishes with a subtle hop bitterness.

Taste doesn't disappoint though. Same multi-faceted chocolate flavors as in the nose, with some mocha, espresso, and a slight hoppy bite in the finish. Not the most complex overall taste package, but a delicious one nonetheless. Mouthfeel is fairly well carbonated, smooth, yet crisp. I have found that Rougue Ales tend to be delicious, but fairly one-dimensional. Out of the 4 Rougues I've tried (Hazelnut Nectar, Mocha Porter and Shakespeare being the others) this is the most robust and interesting. Simply a world class stout if you like chocolate. Not overpoweringly sweet. Just the right amount of coffee/hop bitterness. A must try for any stout lover.","Golden2wenty1","Aug 11, 2005"
4.12,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Bottle obtained from Superior Liquor (Colorado) and consumed a couple evenings later in August 2005. Pours a two finger dark brown head over a pitch black liquid. No edging when held to light. Smells...wow. Chocolate, molasses, a hint of roast. Sweet, malty, chocolatey. Desert. Chocolate dominating the flavor with bourbon cherries underneath. Campfire wood. Fudge-cicle. Okay, a minute of sniffing and the head is a thin layer over the beer...what's it taste like? Starts chocolate with some cherry (ie, black patent) sour. While these start strong, they become very powerful during the swallow and in the aftertaste. As they rise, they get a more refined quality and a faint espresso/coffee-roast steps in, too. As strong as the flavors are, I'm surprised the flavors aren't clinging to my tongue. The body is heavy, but not thick. The finish is quite clean. Dry actually, with some hop bitter. A touch of citrusy hop flavor puts the chocolate on guard. Oddly, there is a flavor in my mouth, like I just toked on a cigarette after several months without one. Nah, maybe it's just a bit of wood flavor, like the wood that I found in the smell. Anyway, this was a really enjoyable beer. As much as I hate Rogue for the overpriced offerings they've recently put out (you know those bottles that are super-premium priced in flashy but stupid bottles), I have to admit, they make really tasty beers.","mentor","Aug 09, 2005"

Taste has a nice bittersweet chocolate flavor with some dark roasted malt. I do have to admit, I occassionally taste an odd metallic off-flavor. From what I gather, this wasn't an old bottle either.

Chocolate is definately a major player in this beer. There was also an unexpected touch of slightly citrus hops coming through. Almost like that orange flavored chocolate you get around the holidays.

Maybe the malt and hops used blended this well.

I guess Id just love it more would another less citric hop replace those astringent cascades. Well made nutty bitter finish counters the heavy sweetness, although it tastes more like bitter black chocolate. Gets roastier and roastier as it warms, like burnt chocolate.

The body of this looks nicely dense on the pour and its just about as black as any other big stout Ive seen before. The head is surprisingly light, sort of a very light tan. That sucker is immobile for a long time though, it hangs tougher than the new kids. Big fat clumps of foamy lace cling to the glass as the liquid descends down my glass. The aroma is very inviting, roasty, nutty and not surprisingly a big fat dollop of milk chocolate. The flavor reminds me of a really nice stout mixed with chocolate milk, its that chocolatey. The flavor is predominately charred malt and soft, chewy milk chocolate, the cascade hops put their foot down a bit in the finish and after-taste but arent quite as assertive here as I perceive them in some of Rogues other beers. The mouthfeel is an even medium Id say and the carbonation lightens the perception.

It poured a nice dark brown bordering on black, with a thick and creamy light brown head. The smell is roasted malt and a sweet coffee-like aroma. The taste is amazing, like an alcoholized mix of rich chocolate milk and espresso. The finish is like a piece of bittersweet chocolate melting down the throat.

I guess my expectation (because of the name) were to find real discernable chocolate taste, instead I feel that the overabundance of hops covered the chocolate with a lingering bitterness.

The flavor is exceptional as this stout has a sweetness in the beginning just as chocolate itself has a sweet creamy inital flavor, while the beer then segues to a nice chocolate finish matched by roasted malt flavors. The mouthfeel is excellent in regards to carbonation but i believe that the body is a bit light. Very drinkable with spicy foods as an excellent contrast of flavors as the Stout cuts through the heat of the dish for the brief time that it is on your tongue then after you swallow the heat is back.","RenoZymurgist","Sep 12, 2004"

In a pint glass, the beer was black, and was topped by an ample brown head that eventually receeded, leaving pools of shimmering obsidian-like blackness. Rich aromas of cocoa-chocolate, cola, and creamy sasparilla wafted from the glass, integrated with a superb and intriguing roasty smoky earthiness. This stout delivered divine flavors...beginning with a dark chocolate-cola roasty maltiness that opened up with an excellent earthy cocoa bitterness and perfectly subtle non-descript esters. The finish was cocoa dry and cola-like with cherry esters, leaving lingering bitter chocolate notes. Yes I could tell there is some real chocolate in there. The body was richly full and smooth: perfect for the flavors and character of the beer. I was very impressed with the Chocolate Stout, enjoying it immensely, in contrast to the Shakespeare, which I think is a bit unrefined and out-of-wack with its esters. Being a lover of both stouts and super dark chocolate, I highly recommend this one to other like-minded individuals. Perhaps my favorite from Rogue.","HiroProtagonist","Aug 20, 2004"

The chocolate is there in the taste, but not nearly as aggressive as in the aroma, and it is quickly balanced by smooth, dark roasted malt with some nice hoppiness on the edge. The beer finishes cleaner than any stout I've ever had, as the chocolate shows up again in the aftertaste, more in the form of vanillin, perfectly balancing out the roastiness.

This follows with a nice coffee tone with hints of expresso and just more cocoa. This beer finishes smooth and thick, with a nice hop bitterness and yet more roasty malts.

The taste was excellent all the great qualities of a stout were present with the taste of dark chocolate. It seems the coffee flavor can out on the backside as an after taste; also there was some bitterness present. Mouthfeel was full bodies and creamy.

The smell is sweet, dark malts, but I can't really pick up any chocolate aroma specifically. Oddly, the more I smell it, the less smell my nose picks up. As the beer slides onto the tongue, the initial taste is sweet and malty. The chocolate doesn't assert itself until after it has sat on the tongue for a bit and you're ready to swallow. At that point, it really rears back and smacks...makes you think you have a piece of dark chocolate in your mouth. I detect a slight metallic taste in the aftertaste, which is ever-so-slightly off-putting. Drinkability suffers for me as it becomes almost sickingly sweet by the end fo the glass.

2.42,-41.7,4.5,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Not a fan of this beer. I don't like the overt chocolate flavor. I don't think chocolate belongs in beer...except Young's Double chocolate which seems to be much less overt in the chocolate department but I know they add chocolate to that beer. In the Rogue beer they add chocolate flavoring...tastes and smells like Nestlea Quik to me actually. Really quite an artificial tasting beer to me. The mouthfeel is quite thin too. Not quite sure how this is top ranked...#19???? better than Thomas Hardy's? Hennepin??? Celebration? Man...crazyness in my opinion.","cerevisiaephilus","Feb 18, 2004"

4.45,7.2,4.5,4.5,5,4,3.5,"Pours a dark, almost black liquid, with a tan foamy, almost creamy head. What a great smell of bitter chocolate, and roasted dark malt. Immediate taste is of the roasted malt, with good bitterness. Then it hits, this may be the best finish of a beer I have ever had. The finish is of a cocoa powder and milk chocolate flavor. Wow! This beer has just about anything you could ask for in a chocolate stout. Good mouthfeel, maybe not a great session beer. This is a good, special occasion beer. Another winner from Rogue.","Bierguy5","Feb 15, 2004"
4.53,9.2,5,4.5,5,4.5,3.5,"Pours a deep chocolate-black, opaque in the glass, with a 1"" frothy coffee-mocha head. Chocolate and chicory form the aroma. Not to be redundant, but the flavor is chocolate, with a nice bitter finish reminiscent of bittersweet chocolate. Even the mouthfeel is thick and creamy, like melted (say it with me) chocolate. All of this, however, is contained within the context of a very satisfying stout. You like chocolate? You like stouts? You'll love this. You probably wouldn't want to drink it all night, but as a treat or a desert beer, it's really good.","jtfest","Feb 14, 2004"
4.27,2.9,4.5,5,4,4,4,"An interesting chocolate offering from Rogue, especially for those who appreciate a more dry chocolate taste. This is something I'd likely have again. Smells simply fantastic!","beergeek279","Feb 07, 2004"
4.25,2.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I enjoyed my last few sips with a few hershey kisses lying around here - what a fantastic combination! Or maybe the taste developed because of the alcohol - I'm still not sure how much was in the bottle.","jahred","Feb 07, 2004"
4.12,-0.7,4.5,5,4,3.5,3.5,"I feel like Homer Simpson right now. Mmm.... Chocolate. The first smell after opening the 22 oz bottle was a bit hoppy with a hint of coffee, similar to the Shakespeare Stout. A deeper breath and the smell of Chocolate broke through quite clearly. When poured in a pint glass, it looked the part with an opaque brown body topped with a rough brown head. The taste is dominated by the presence of chocolate. Because of the strong flavoring, other tastes are a bit hard to distinguish. I can detect a bit of coffee, and burnt toast. Quite dry and a tad too harsh in the mouthfeel department, I think. It left me wishing for more maltyness and a smoother and sweeter body. This is definitely not to be chugged, but sipped and allowed to coat your throat and tongue as it goes down.","rajendra82","Feb 06, 2004"
4.12,-0.7,4.5,5,4,3.5,3.5,"on tap at isaac newton's: inky black with an increidibly dark brown bubbling head, that retreated for the most part. on the nose...oh man, what a nose...this had to be one of the best smelling flavored stouts i've ever come across....deep dark milk chocolate covered roasted barley smell. i can't stress enough how good this beer smells. a tad bit too much carbonation thins out medium body. hints of chocolate and smoke at first sip, followed by a massive roasted flavor and quite strong (for the style) leafy hop flavor. this beer smells alot more chocolatey than it tastes. a great sippin' brew, though i don't think that i'd want more than one in a sitting. a must try.","pheurton","Feb 06, 2004"
4.7,13.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Awesome. Pours out like a can of motor oil. Two inch dark brown head not unlike the top of a chocolate milk shake. Is this a chocolate milkshake...besides the chocolate aroma the touch of hops and strong malts tell me that this is in fact a beer. Taste is incredibly smooth. Big malts up front with a pronounced hop bitterness in the middle with a finish of sweet chocolate goodness. Overall flavor is almost of baking chocolate. This is the best chocolate beer I've had yet, and one of the best stout's to boot.","chaduvel","Feb 02, 2004"
4.74,14.2,4,5,5,4,4.5,"Having had it many times over a few years, I find it amazing how consistant this beer is, regardless of whether it is served on tap or bottle. There is really nothing that the brewer could do with it to make it any more enjoyable. Great with a big slab of chocolate cake for dessert.","sparkydoyle","Feb 01, 2004"
4.95,19.3,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Oh my! Simply put it doesn't get much better than this (from a bottle anyhow). Pours black as an accountant's soul with a burnt umber shard at the bottom. A luxurious, frothy cacao colored head that is tenaciously stubborn tops the brew and gives it a regal look. The smell is initially sweet like hot chocolate before moving onto more bitter, toasted notes of chocolate and creamed coffee. The taste is outlandishly appealing. Chocolate upon chocolate with the hops and alcohol more apparent when warmed. It is sweeter and more complex, not to mention more enjoyable, when allowed to warm a bit. It has a unique finish which is both green and creamy. Mouthfeel is great. Chewy, complex and mildly carbonated...perhaps slightly thin for the style. There is a lot going on here. Drinkability is perhaps a little too good. More?","MobBarley","Jan 31, 2004"
4.3,3.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability - A truly drinkable beer that has changed my mind about stouts. The chocolate and hop balance make this one of the better beers I have sampled lately. The creativeness of this wonderful brew makes me proud to be a beer drinker.","filabrazilia","Jan 30, 2004"
4.48,8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Im not sure if a stout can look ant better that this when pouring into the glass. Pitch black in color with a large frothy tan head that has a slight cascading effect as it builds above the rim of the glass into a perfect dome shape. The head lasts a long time, slowly receding to a thick frothy lace. Lots of chocolate notes on the nose with a good amount of hops that seem earthy in nature. Some roasted and coffee notes also play in, but are intertwined with the chocolate character. This brew is huge in the flavor department and really hits my palate the right way. Roasted notes are far more apparent on the pallet then on the nose. Theres a subtle, slightly smooth start of semi sweet dark chocolate that is followed shortly after by coffee and roasted notes. A slight hint of milk chocolate comes in towards the middle, followed by and soft prickly carbonation. Good hop finish that is again a bit earthy, brings a nice balance. Roasted and coffee notes come back in the aftertaste and last forever, forcing me to draw the glass back up for another sip. Towards the end of the bottle, white sediment is noticeable as it collects on the bottom of the glass. The overall mouth feel is medium and is smooth, yet not quite so smooth due to the roasted notes. Despite this, the brew is incredibly drinkable. Im sorry to see the bottom of the glass, and Im even more sorry that I only bought two bottles.","byrd","Jan 26, 2004"
4.38,5.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"An outstanding brew....Exceptional appearance...black, choclolate creamy head, chunky and leving a beautiful lace. Smell...hops, chocolate, malt, a hint of coffee...all in their...definitely invites you to drink. Taste was initially slightly sweet, leveling off at mid palate and ending in anice hoppy burst. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and dry, almost astingent in the finish. A delight for malt, chocolate and hops lovers. Highly revommend.","edchicma","Jan 22, 2004"

3.95,-4.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"A thick pour; opaque, black beer. The head is dark tan/brown and crusty. Nice. Spotty lacing. The nose shows off plenty of dark chocolate but no possibility of hiding the Cascades. Yum. But the hops are almost confined to the aroma. The beer starts with sweet chocolate, travels through a thick, malty, chocolate base to a bitter, dark chocolate finish. This is a very tasty chocolate drink. The Cascades in the nose offset the chocolate a little, but I wouldn't take offense if somebody called this beer ""a bit one-dimensional"".","kbub6f","Jan 16, 2004"
4.38,5.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Comes in a nice, 22oz bomber, damm skippy. Pours a black gold, a classical stout look with a good, meaty head. Smell is of malt and what else but chocolate. Taste is straight up solid. Much less of a burnt taste is there, though still quite active, this is the best brew to ever hit the chocolate nail on the head. Bold and very drinkable, one of the best chocolate stouts out there.","RocketWidget","Jan 16, 2004"
4.85,16.9,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"This is dessert in a bottle! It poured a jet black color with a dark brown head that settled into a pillow of foam after about 1 min. The smell was all chocolate, just like sniffing the inside of a truffle. The taste was just amazing with a great chocolate sweetness and just enough hops to balance out the flavor. This is one that could be enjoyed with cake or ice cream or just by its self. What a beer!","Dmann","Jan 13, 2004"
4.5,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"What the hell was I drinking? Is this beer? Who cares? It was dark, with a chocolate head.

Masterfull.","bewareOFpenguin","Jan 13, 2004"
4.13,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Bomber bottle pours black as pitch with a thick, dark, tan head. The aromas are all chocolate, not the syrupy sweet milk chocolate, but a real good bitter dark baking chocolate. The taste is roasted malts and chocolate with a keen dry hop finish. The the cold mouthfeel contrasted nicely with the warm chocolate stout flavors. Dryness increased as the beer warmed. Good stuff, but couldn't see doing more than the one bomber.","counselor","Jan 12, 2004"
4.6,10.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Dark pitck black. It's like looking into the nightmares of a child. Even the head is a dark tan color. But then it all becomes a dream. The everlasting chocolate smell brings me back to my childhood. It's like unwrapping a Symphony dark chocolate bar and getting that magnificent odor. The taste is purely chocolate also. you can feel it melt on your tongue as it goes down. No beer has ever brought me back to my preteen years, except Colt .45, but that is a different story. Another A for rogue. Good times.","CBFanWish","Jan 09, 2004"
4.15,0,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Very nice. Pours jet black with a huge tan head. Aroma is of chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate - also sweet malts. First taste that hits is slightly burnt malts, then some bitterness. So much chocolate. Dry with very little actual sweetness. Extremely smooth mouthfeel with just a bit of crispness. Somewhat oatmeal stout-like. All in all this is a great brew.","Admiraldinty","Jan 06, 2004"
4.38,5.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours the colour of night with a light mocha head which sat and lingered like froth on a cappucino. Smell is of roasted malts and Chocolate almost like an Ovaltine gone Adult. The taste is of Roasted malts at first then the chocolate slides in and dominates, just enough hops come in to dry out the palate and keep everything in line. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth with the flavours lingering around long enough to keep the smile on your face. Drinkability is good although they could fill you up quick. Overall a killer Chocolate beer. I give it the edge over the Sam Adams Chocolate Bock because the chocolate character is more subtle and refined.","TinusTime","Jan 06, 2004"

4.08,-1.7,5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours with a thick darkish brown head. Quite black in color. The head is so meringue like that I take a bite of it. The head is like biting into the lightest, fluffiest, slightly sweet chocolate mousse. The aroma is strongly of chocolate, it dominates the aroma of this beer. Quite a creamy body, lightly sweet as well. This beer finishes with a bit of dark malt and a subdued bitterness. Just like the aroma, the chocolate is dominant in the taste of the beer as well. It is like eating a dense, rich, creamy chocolate dessert that is only lightly sweet. Very good, though I must say that it seems a bit one-dimensional.","Gueuzedude","Jan 05, 2004"
4.52,8.9,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a deep black with a thin, but lasting head. The nose is of chocolate and little spicy, perhaps cinnamon. The 69 IBUs are amply balanced by the malts. Chocolate and oats mellow it even further, although the hops may a play for dominance in the finish.","TPoling","Jan 04, 2004"
4.4,6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Chocoholics, rejoice! I like chocolate, and I like this beer! No hints here, it is what it is, and that's a thick, rich, robust stout to make Willy Wonka proud. The heft and ABV limit this to mostly singular indulgences, but that one- OK, maybe two- goes down smooth and with gustatorial delight. Nestle's Quik has always been a down-home comfort drink for me. Now that I'm a big boy, this beer will take that role. In a nutshell, you'd have to HATE chocolate not to like this beer.","Foxman","Jan 04, 2004"

4.52,8.9,4,4.5,5,4,4,"650 ml bottle. Pours an opaque deep brown(almost black), with an honest-to-goodness light brown head that lasts and lasts, eventually giving way to ring and sheet cocoa lacing. Big aroma of chocolate, Irish cream coffee, and burnt smoky malts. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Carbonation doesn't bite, but it's there. Taste is chocolate, roasted and caramelized. Smokiness is noticeable. Cascade hops peep in, but the Dutch chocolate drives them away. Damn, this stuff has an overwhelming taste. I don't know how any other stout can claim to be a chocolate stout, standing against this one. Excellent product here, and I love it! Really close to liquid food.","merlin48","Jan 02, 2004"
4.12,-0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,3,"Intense flavor and heavy mouthfeel detract from the overall drinkability of this beer. The single 22oz. bottle was enough to leave me burned out on chocolate, and feeling stuffed.","Ilacquin","Jan 02, 2004"
4.45,7.2,4.5,4.5,5,4,3.5,"The mouthfeel is thick and full bodied. Subtle coffee and bitterness linger on the tongue behind the chocolate well into the aftertaste. The drinkability is knocked down a notch because after finishing the bomber bottle, I felt like I ate the several whole chocolate bars and I had enough for this sitting. I consider this a chocolate meal.","Gavage","Jan 01, 2004"
3.26,-21.4,5,4,3,3,2.5,"I think I got a bad bottle or something, cause I got no choclate in this whole beer. The most I got was a heavy bite from hops, which I don't care for too much. I have had the Brooklyn Chocolate Stout and that blows this one away, as far as balanced out malts and hops, as well as taste. This one was way too hoppy for me and had little balance. I got very little malts in it at all, which was a huge let down. The best thing about this brew, for me, was the apperance. This is simply one of the best looking beers you will ever see. Nice head retention and super dark color. The color was so beautiful, I couldn't see through it, so that's a plus in my book. Other than that, this was below average, as far as chocolate stouts go. I couldn't finish the bomber, and that says a lot to me.","JISurfer","Dec 26, 2003"

The body was middle of the road which is good because I didn't feel like actually drinking a bottle of syrup. The taste was all stout, not nearly as much chocolate as in the aroma, and a little bit of roasted malt. A good beer, very drinkable. I just thought the chocolate in the aroma was overbearing and a little artificial.","HappyHourHero","Dec 18, 2003"

The slightly thin body provides a flavor that is just weak and quite short of stout strength. Dark as night, this beer had a small nondescript head and little lace effect. Truly short of chocolate sense as well, but long on a thin malt sense.","AtLagerHeads","Dec 12, 2003"

Aroma: Hints of roasted marshmallows, deep milky chocolate, toasted nuts just one heavenly aroma barely letting some floral notes of hops. Taste: Ladies and gents what a beer, this one is definitely worthy of the Best of BA, with dark roasts blending with hop bitterness in the finish upfront the beer is full of toasted nuts and chocolate pleasure. Nothing compares to this one just awesome I like Brooklyn's Luxury Double Chocolate and Young's as well but this one kicks up a notch in the right direction. Mouthfeel: Full bodied almost chewy definitely pours like motor oil this is one big brew, awesome.

3.83,-7.7,4.5,4,3.5,5,3.5,"A big and thick black pour generates a decent and creamy tannish head that's slightly more even in color than Shakespeare. Nice intricate lacing properties. Aroma is too tipped toward chocolate to my mind, quite strong and unidimensional. Excellent body, mouthfeel, and proper carbonation. But like the smell, the malt flavors and sweetness leans too far to the chocolate side for my everyday tastes, just a slight coffee compensates. Just when you think this is going to be a Young's Luxury Double on steroids, the famed Rogue hopping balances very well and brings the close and after sensation about. A good beer for the right mood, it just lacks the slightly more masterful complexity and outstanding balance of Rogue Shakespeare Stout -- still the finest beer on the planet in so many characteristics. More than one pint of Chocolate Stout at a time gets very cloying for me.","ADR","Oct 30, 2003"

Intense flavors came through. Lots of chocolate, but not really sweet chocolate, more bitter chocolate flavor. Another flavor was a woody flavor that complemented the chocolate nicely. Mixture of sweetness and hoppiness stayed balanced throughout. Very roasted feel in the finish. Medium carbonation and a medium to thick body here. Improved as it warmed.

I find the Chocolate flavor to be ideal, strong enough to know it's chocolate, but without tasting artificial or being overbearing as to ruin the stout taste. A thick, hanging, tongue-coating mouthfeel with an aftertaste that follows the initial coffee and chocolate flavors through. It is somewhat pricey, but after drinking many good stouts, this one is very memorable with the ideal amount of chocolate.

Aroma is sweet, with roasted notes and good chocolate scents, but there's also a good hop component as well. The taste is very good, with sweet malt and dark chocloate notes surrounding a slightly fruity note. Then a great coffee flavor sweeps in accompanied by a blast of bitterness on the finish. The lingering aftertaste is a lot like eating dark chocolate cake with raspberries and then chasing it with an irish coffee. It surprising how much the chocolate flavors show through, as this is not a one dimensional beer at all. Much more chocolate than Youngs double Chocolate, and a heck of a lot more of everything else as well. This is one of those beers that I had passed by a few times, not wanting to pay the PA premium. But I'm glad I finally got a bottle last month. This is a great beer, truly deserving of its praise. Now if I could only get this much chocolate taste in a beer without the complimenting (and great) bitterness, maybe I could get my wife to have a brew.

Smell is chocolate and roasty, and...oh yeah, chocolate. Taste is exceptional.....very chocolaty, perhaps slight hints of coffee...but mainly chocolate, and more chocolate! A thick and smooth mouthfeel, easy on the palate. This one is a little thick to drink too many, but that's a good thing in my book.

Chocolate and oats with a fair dose of hops blend together very nicely, leaving you in serious anticipation of the first drink. As a chocolate lover, I'm certainly biased, but the flavor is fantastic. The chocolate is more akin to semi-sweet baking chololate than the milk chocolate commonly used in desserts. However, it does make a wonderful dessert beer. I enjoyed this after a big plate of spaghetti with Italian sausage and was ready to loosen my belt and take a nap.

Buttery, pure milk chocolate sweetness hits the nose at first, then is ceded by notes of carob and suggestions of chocolate covered candied orange peel along with coffeeish, borderline burnt roasted barley. Real chocolate never wavers in aroma, remaining constant and assertive. A joy to inhale. Snap of dark caramel sweetness is superceded by drying, pronounced hop bitterness and notes of unsweetened cocoa. Real chocolate is less assertive in flavor as the aroma would indicate, but persists throughout to underlay a smoothly bittersweet undertone. Roasted malted barley eeks in mid palate, lending a subtle smoky, carbonaceous charcoal impression. Overshadowed citrusy hop flavor struggles to add complexity. A touch light in body, with a thinnish, over attenuated mouthfeel saved by the oat glucans. Finishes with surprisingly pronounced notes of dark roast coffee and cream widening into a lingering hop bitterness. Rogue Chocolate is a delicious, rich stout. I prefer my Willy Shakes unadulterated, since the chocolate character muted the hop and roasted grain profile. A highly enjoyable treat nonetheless.","marc77","Mar 25, 2003"

Nose was (guess) chocolate, candied sugar, caramel nougat, and a little rum-like ester. All were appetizing to smell, but none were presented or combined in an impressive way. Taste was (guess) chocolate and candied sugar. Had a dry hoppy finish but of the bitter sort you'd find in good chocolate. Even better was its almost fruity espresso flavors in the middle of its flavor profile. The mouthfeel was thin with a fizz that came from the head and hops. A very straightforward beer but by no means boring and one of the better stouts out of the six famous and beeradvocate highly-ranked ones I've had recently. Simple and simply edible, this is a tasty stout I am welcome to return to. With a way too easy mouthfeel, and skilled brewing, its a beer version of milk chocolate.","nomad","Mar 13, 2003"

The first sip is always the best with any chocolate stout, and this one didn't let me down. Somewhat higher carbonation relative to others i have tried. The overall taste was of rich chocolate fighting with the hops for mouth domination - thats how i would describe it. In the end they both live in peace, blending into a bittersweet chocolate finish.

The smell takes me back to a childhood of quaffing chocolate Carnation Instant Breakfast before rushing off to school. If only I had been drinking this instead, classes would've been oh so much more enjoyable. The flavors come in waves. First there is a quick, muted blast of citrus, then wave after wave of chocolate; first sweet and creamy, then bittersweet. The finish leaves you with a bit of roast barley bitterness.

Taste starts off with roasted malt, a thin but respectable layer of hops, and finishes with enough chocolate to make you feel you had a melting Hershey's kiss in your mouth when you drank. And with signature oatmeal notes mixed in. Definitely an oatmeal stout at the bottom of this specialty. Thick, lush, and smooth across the tongue.

The beer does have some carbonation, but once the beer settles down, a range of very pleasant malt/chocolate tastes assaults you.

4.25,2.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"the beer is extremely rich and smooth with a wonderful full body and full flavor. dark malts and coffee flavors take over in the taste of this beer. you will get chocolate kicks here and there, but nowhere near what i had expected. i will say that let me down a little bit. the beer was excellent, but i want more chocolate.","ElGuapo","Dec 24, 2002"
4.3,3.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I was impressed with the fact that a chocolate stout managed to have a nice hoppy flavor in addition to everything else going on in this brew. The hops and bitterness seemed to hit me first, with some mild coffee flavors, then finishing with a great, mild chocolate flavor. This is a must have for any stout lover.","IrishRedRock","Dec 23, 2002"

4.88,17.6,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Black, with a huge, dark brown, creamy head that sticks around to the very end. Nice aroma of slightly bitter dark chocolate, with a hint of hops as the brew warms. Flavor is just heavenly. This is the most authentic chocolate flavor I've ever encountered in a beer, and it doesn't stop there. Taste develops into a nice understated roasted malt, and finishes with just enough hops to let you know you're still drinking a beer. Finish has a nice mixture of bitterness from three different sources: the grains, the chocolate, and the hops. Really pleasant. Sweet, full-bodied with a decadently creamy mouthfeel. A truly outstanding beer.","mzwolinski","Dec 18, 2002"
4.03,-2.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Color was black (opaque) with a thick, rising brown head. Rich sweet chocolatey and malt aroma. Mouthfeel was smooth and very full-bodied. Roasted malt and luscious chocolate flavor dominates midtones. Natural chocolate used in brewing really sets this chocolate stout apart from others. Finish contains bitterness from the hops typical in most of the beers Rogue brews. That's about the only thing that was a slight turn-off. For such a sweet stout, I'm not sure the bitterness of the finish compliments the sweetness of the chocolate. Still it wasn't enough to detract from the overall great taste of this chocolate stout.","Winter","Dec 15, 2002"

4.68,12.8,5,4.5,5,5,4,"Color is jet black with a thich creamy brown head that sticks to the glass. Aroma is of chocolate and more chocolate with milk and roasty malt in the backround. Rich and thick, full bodied and a wondeful creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is chocolate, lots of it and different kinds of tastes. Powered cocoa, dark, bittersweet, milk, and baker's chocolate flavors hit you at different times as you sip. Roasted malt and coffee-like taste is in the backround. Hops and bitterness makes itself known but balances nicely. The balance between them is mind-boggling. Would be interesting to try this at a lower IBU. An excellent stout, richness takes away from the drinkablity, but overall it is wonderful.","Lupe","Dec 03, 2002"
4.78,15.2,5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"oh man is this a killer! blacker than black in color, thick and rich, with a big dark tan head that stays forever. piney hops on top of chocolate in the nose. tastes of bitter and sweet chocolate with the usual cascade hop finish. the body of this brew is awesome...bold and heavy, yet silky smooth. how a beer can be so bitter yet oh so smooth is baffling. i'm having a hard time coming up with the right words to accurately describe this brew. so 'absolutely delicious' will have to do. a chocolate lover's delight!","budgood1","Dec 02, 2002"
4.55,9.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Incredibly dark reddish-brown, as near to black as possible without actually being black. Nice brown head, but it doesn't last quite long enough. Still a bit of lace on top, though. Rich smell of lightly roasted barley, packed with chocolate. Flavor is rich and chocolaty. Combined with the hop bitterness, the taste is somewhat like semisweet chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel, oily finish with a lingering taste of bitter chocolate.","Viking","Nov 30, 2002"
4.55,9.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Rogue's take at liquid Godiva, this is one excellent stout. Pours opaque with an impressive, sturdy tan head. Smell is big on chocolate with notes of caramel included, too. Taste is more of the same, with an onslaught of chocolate and a nice hint of Cascade hops along the way. Mouthfeel is chewy, smooth, delectable. For a full-bodied stout of its proportion, this stout is quite drinkable. It's one of the best dessert beers I've come across, and I suggest serving it by itself.","Jon","Nov 25, 2002"
5,20.5,5,5,5,5,5,"I feel like Augustus Gloop sticking my nose in a river of chocolate, but I survive to take a draught of this rich and chewy brew and find myself in a world of balanced perfection. Pours Siberian new moon black with a gluey, frothy cocoa puff head. Like eating chocolate cupcakes on a cocoa plantation. It's sweet, no, it's bitter, no, hoppy? Oh no. How can a beer be so luscious and drinkable at the same time? A feast for the senses. Majestic!","inebrius","Nov 25, 2002"
4.25,2.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Opaque and black, with a thin, but persistant head. Aroma of chocolate and spicy hops. Flavor began with bitter chocolate, became very slightly sweet and fruity, and finished with some underlying earthy hop flavors. Full bodied with low to medium carbonation... smooth and very drinkable. An very good flavored stout.","zerk","Nov 24, 2002"
4.13,-0.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Rogue Chocolate Stout was served jet-black with a rich brown head, of a good inch, wonderful lacing as I sipped away. This beer was way more robust than I was expecting. The flavors on the palate were a whopping dose of both roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. This blend added tremendously to the complexity of the Stout; then add in some hops for underlying support. The lack of sweetness was noticeable but not absent. The texture on the tongue was surprisingly creamy. This is a very, very good Stout every BA should try this one.","bditty187","Nov 23, 2002"
4.32,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is one of the best Chocolate Stout's that I have ever had. Big, bold chocolate flavor that is like drinking desert. Dark as night with a creamy off white head. The rep from Rogue said that they use Dutch chocolate if I remember correctly. This is personally a beer that I probably couldn't have more than two of at one sitting due to the sweetness. I would like to try this out of the bottle but don't know where I could find it.","CharlesRiver","Nov 20, 2002"
4.53,9.2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ah that magical pour of a well made stout, well heck the worst I ever drank was pert near good. Deep brown to black beauty with a gargantuan head that leaves a latticework of lace behind, the color a magnificent chocolate brown, with a creamy texture. Nose is bittersweet chocolate, coffee, roasted grains, and black patent malts, quite a Sniffer. Front is malt, lightly sweet, the top thick-bodied, the finish, joyously hopped, joyfully acidic, with a bittersweet chocolate dry aftertaste, la bière est magnifique. Ranks #70 on my current 1000 beer master list.","Gusler","Nov 19, 2002"

4.45,7.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"2002 release. Thick black liquid decorated with a creamy, puffy dark tan head. Mouth watering! Stays well too. Bittersweet aroma of hops, cocoa, and dark chocolate. With a taste, first comes hop bitterness, then it evens out with some dark chocolate and roasted grain. Bitter in the middle, but really sweet on the edges of the tongue. Leafy hops in the back. It leaves that leafy character on the tongue as well, I like that. Very smooth and creamy. However, at the end of 22 oz. of this, it gets kind of cloying, so that cuts down on the drinkability. Rogue really put the chocolate in chocolate stout! Using real chocolate was a good idea. Great effort. Too bad this is only seasonal (or is it going year-round now?). Also, thanks to Rogue beers, it's easy for me to identify cascade hops now. I'm not usually a huge fan of cascades used in profusion, but they're nice in this one. Anyway, I definitely want more of this soon!","hyuga","Nov 14, 2002"
4.5,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Aged 22 oz. bottle - well over a year old - surprisingly ""fresh"". Very, very dark brown with only minimally visible ruby highlights showing through. The thick, rocky, light brown head holds extremely well and leaves excellent ""spider web"" lace throughout. The aroma is fruity and sweetly chocolatey - very much like sweet cocoa powder. The body is surprisingly full, and givies a very creamy mouthfeel. The flavor starts fruity (raisins, berries), then becomes softly coca-ish, cereal-like and chocolatey as it warms, and finishes astonishingly long with a burst of sweet chocolate, a coffee-like roastiness, and a gently bitter character. A mild but distinctive Cascade flavor eventually emerges once the malt residue has subsided. Wow! Quite a finish. Absolutely worth trying. Easily the best ""chocolate"" beer I've ever had.","NeroFiddled","Oct 17, 2002"
4.59,10.6,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"(on tap, from notes at brewery) Nice jet black color with a thick tan head. Pretty strong chocolate nose.  Medium bodied with a very smoothe and creamy mouthfeel.  Like drinking a cup of alcoholic cocoa.  Very nice and enjoyable.","jreitman","Sep 04, 2002"
4.48,8,5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Pitch black with huge, puffy, immaculate light tan head. Smells of chocolate (duh) and cream. Like velvet running down the throat. Malt bitterness and substantial hops abutted with chocolate creaminess into a brew that is not overwhelmingly chocolatey but hints of coffee and oats (one of the ingredients). Mouthfeel: velvety, creamy, magnificent, just shy of perfection by being a tad slippery. This is a great beer, as tasty as you would imagine, with only the herbal bitterness keeping it from reeling into the stratosphere.","Thrasher","Jul 30, 2002"
4.4,6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"As far as flavoured stouts go this is one of the best, very well balanced and quite drinkable for a brew with such a big body.","Jason","May 26, 2002"

4.82,16.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"When they say ""chocolate", they don't lie.  This dark brown, heavy bodied stout was like drinking cold, hopped chocolate syrup.  It was awesome.  Probably the best desert I have ever tasted.","beernut7","May 08, 2002"
4.32,4.1,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,3,"We're not talking chocolate malt here - we're talking real chocolate.  I almost expected to see a half-dissolved Hershey bar clinking around in the bottle after I poured out the last of the beer.  Pour was thick and black, like used motor oil (only a stout lover could find this description appetizing).  Creamy and chock-full of mocha chocolate, like a chocolate creme soda.  I'm a fan of Young's Luxury Double Chocolate Stout, but Young's is no match for this chocolate monster.  My only ding against this Rogue is the drinkability factor.  A little of this beer went a long way for me, and toward the end the chocolate became cloying and just too much.  A great dessert beer.","Brent","Apr 03, 2002"
4,-3.6,4,4,4,3,4.5,"Rogue can do stouts and that's all there is to it. Not as good as the Shakespeare stout, but good. Stouts have a little dark chocolate flavor to them to start with and this one just accents that flavor a bit more. Good stuff.","aracauna","Mar 28, 2002"
