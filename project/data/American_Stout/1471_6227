3.83,-3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Overeall: This is definitely a different take on a stout. Its decently good. I enjoy that its not a blueberry bomb and that the stout flavors can meld with it. There is some sort of subtle off flavor i get however, perhaps from the artificial flavoring. I also get a sense of lactose on the finish that is odd to me becuase i dont think its a milk stout. For me the aftertaste is the biggest negative to this beer. All in all worth checking out as a fun beer, but its a one and done for me.","Bone53","Mar 18, 2015"

Again, the blueberry is there to accent this beer -- not turn it into fruit juice. If I had any complaint, it'd be that I'd like it to be a bit more bold on the flavor. More blueberry and more roasty depth. This stuff tastes great as it is, but uhm... maybe an Imperial version, Dark Horse? Just a thought. Definitely try this one out.","Alextricity","Mar 20, 2014"

(I always wait for one to do that to me) Ive had this beer again and again, over the years. Ill agree with some other posts I have seen, as the head does not have very good retention, but when it is there is has a nice red color. This beer is pitch black and oily. It has the most wonderful aroma of blueberries and smokey malts. Dark Horse makes a fantastic stout, Ive had them all, but this one is my favorite. If there wasnt blueberries in it and it was just a little thicker, this would be a perfect regular stout. The alcohol is well hidden, but there is the slightest bite, which I figure comes from the fruit. While the taste is definitely not what you would expect, and I only say that because you would think Blueberry would be most prominent, which it is not, the rest of the smell meets taste in perfect symmetry. The mouth feel is watery for a stout of this ABV, but it is almost chewy, which I like. This is art in my opinion, and its relatively cheap, in my opinion, for a beer of this quality. Id love to have this on tap. I recommend!","Jay_Ulreich","Jan 14, 2014"

This stout gets its blueberry notes across but takes nothing away from the stout experience itself. Maybe one of the better examples of pulling a bold stout off.'most overdue the fruit.

The liquid is a full brownish black with some particulate visible, more than any bubbles, maybe some faint orange tint around the rims. The aromas do evoke ripe unpicked blueberries rather than juicy juice, good bit of roast to the cocoa, dark chocolate scents, vanilla, toffee and some heavy cream, not getting much other fruit or citrus, likely cloaked by the blueberries, has nice purity and thankfully is not really all that aggressive. Medium-bodied, light carbonation but this doesn’t seem to effect the freshness and the light fluffiness allows it to soak in but not get clingy. The blueberry flavor displays restraint and lends as much sour kick as sweetness, if you are looking for blueberry syrup you will be disappointed. Sneaks in some softer coffee notes alongside the chocolate, mocha, at the same time the roast is stronger than in the nose. Not much flavor hop-wise but texturally they may help stiffen it up some.

A surprisingly pleasing combination that goes really well together. Taste is chocolately and malty, kind of lactose-esque, with blueberry weaved in throughout. It adds a lot to the smoothness and the suck-down-ability. I'm not trying to drink this fast but I definitely seem to be. Mouthfeel is smooth, slick, soft, and blankety. Stout appropriate. Overall I think this is a nice change of pace. I was a little weary of the blueberry at first but it works really well with this style.","tastybeer","May 05, 2013"

Fruit flavored beers have always been very hit or miss with me. The smells I picked up were those of luscious desserts and bakery treats. Natural blueberry muffin, pie crust, cappuccino, dark roasted malts. The flavor of the blueberry was front and center, but there was an unexpected and pleasant smoked character as well. Slightly bready, it coats the mouth nicely with a moderate chewiness and a crisp finish. Don't hesitate to pick this up, even for those wary of fruit beer.","Neorebel","Apr 26, 2013"

Aromas of blueberry tart and sweet, with a heavy dose of roasted coffee in the backbone. Flavors are rich and creamy, with a mocha backbone giving rise to a subtle sweet blueberry ribbon of sweetness. The fruit imparts a blueberry muffin character to the brew, and there are roasty highlights throughout. Very robust, on a smooth, full body. Roasty and fruity aftertaste, with a balancing bitterness.

A sweetened dehydrated blueberry aroma flits above the surface, but underneath is an almost nutty bran muffin and hint of dark chocolate. The flavor is not quite as integrated as the nose.

I can tell it is a mix of blueberry and chocolate, but really, it kind of smells like vomit (by kind of, I mean it literally smells like last night’s dinner coming back for an encore). Just weird. Luckily, the flvaor starts out okay. Not much blueberry going on to start, but the flavor is very roasty with hints of chocolate. Definite bitterness--not expected at this level from a sweet stout--and there are definitely hops here. Slight tinge of blueberry. Roasty smokey aftertaste with some cocoa. As I get through it a bit more the blueberry really starts coming out on the finish, and then all the way through. This just ends up becoming an all blueberry beer. Sweeter and sweeter as I go. Ultimately a drainpour. I just can’t deal with this one. Admittedly, I am not a huge blueberry fan anyway. Higher carbonation for a stout, which keeps it a bit lighter than It actually is on the palate. Overall I guess they hit what they were going for. But need to work on that truly effed up aroma pI would think even for those who are blueberry fans. Certainly different and interestingly complex, but not for me.

Blueberry is definitely apparent in the aroma, blending with some roasted malt and dark chocolate. Berries take it down a notch in the mouth as the flavor opens with more of a dark, charred maltiness, bittersweet chocolate, and a hint of roasted coffee - almost like a dry stout - before the blueberry enters and permeates all the nooks and crannies with lightly tart juicy sweetness. Medium bodied with some texture and a slightly dry finish.

Had a 1 finger mocha brown head that was all little bubbles. over time it flattened out, and became a bit creamer with just a bit of hold on the sides of the glass. Aroma had an initial hint of blueberry, but shifted to a more of a roasted dark chocolate smell. A bit of fruity reminded hiding in the back. Flavor was more a mild chocolate that shifted to a definite blueberry pie filling. A bit of blueberry lingered afterwards. Coated nicely in mouth, a bit of cling to the sides, with a nice chew. Overall exactly as it should be. Well balanced stout, with a flavor profile that hit the name dead on.","mountdew1","Nov 16, 2012"

Aroma heavy with dark roasty malts, and a distinctive scent of fresh-baked blueberry muffins. I know how hard it is to successfully meld fruit with the dark malts of a rich stout and get a satisfying result, but I think Dark Horse really nailed it with this one. Very roasty on the tongue, lots of dark malts, notes of coffee and dark chocolate, and an ubiquitous presence of fresh blueberries. Well, it delivered what it promised.

It smells like blueberry muffins as soon as I pop the cap. Roasty herbal earthy aromas as well as some berries upon closer sniffing. Taste is herbal and earthy up front to the point of being annoying. That slowly fades into a burnt sugar roasted kind of thing. Long lingering caramel roasty sweetness with a touch of heat in the finish. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation, and a rough sticky mouthfeel.

Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, blueberry, coffee, caramel, toast, and light herbal hops. Fair amount of coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, blueberry, coffee, roasted malt, and caramel on the finish for a good bit. Great balance of flavors; very nice showcase of the blueberry and roasted chocolate notes. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice highly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden at 7%, with only a slight warming after the finish present. Overall this is a highly excellent stout. Probably the best I have had with fruit in it.

Smell is fantastic, smells like blueberry muffins and roasty stoutness combined together, and it seems like there's something somewhat spicy lingering there as well. Taste isn't quite as impressive as the flavor, but it's still quite nice. Blueberries and roast are the primary flavors, neither overwhelms and they're pretty balanced, but I almost wish that there was more blueberry here. There's also some breadiness in there and some interesting spice that doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the flavors. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for the style.

It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of darkly sienna foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate, dank blueberries, and some molasses thrown in for good measure. The taste brings in more of the same, but the conflict between the dark chocolate/bitter roasted malts and the blueberries is apparent from the get-go. It ends up coming off as too bitter, too pithy (sort of) for me. The body is lightly hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a nearly chewy feel. Overall, a pretty good beer, but the flavors involved just don't seem to mesh entirely well. I can drink it, just not very easily and without complete enjoyment.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and blueberries. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, blueberries, and subtle dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Blueberry stout you say? Hmmm, might as well since I have the rest of the series to get through today... Doesn't smell too bad, but you can definitely tell this thing has blueberries in it without a doubt. The flavor is more of the same. Typical American Stout based brew with a touch of blueberry that comes throughout the sip and after swallowing.

Light blueberry flavor in the beginning that is quickly dominated by a growing leather and roast flavor. A couple of sips of this pretty much told me exactly what kind a beer this was.

4.44,11.8,4,5,4.5,4,4,"From the beginning, the aroma harkens back to the childhood cereal with the blue ghost known as ""Boo Berry"". The malts in the aroma combines with the scents of blueberry make for an interesting combination. The appearance shows a dark murky brown, with little head after the pour. No forced carbonation in the mouthfeel. The creaminess of the lactose reinforces the cereal theme nicely. The sweet malt flavors really stand out in the initial taste. This is no macro-brew stout! The sweetness and the blueberry hints make an easy drink. The blueberry is not overpowering in the taste. If the fruit were more potent, one might forget he/she was drinking beer. The sweet malt fades to the back of the tongue, ending the pleasant experience.","JohnnyHopps","Sep 27, 2011"

The taste isn’t quite as nice as the aroma but still good with the dark roasted malts and bittersweet chocolates dominating. The blueberries are present but not overwhelming, making for a nice, balanced flavor. The mouth feel is medium bodied with tons of carbonation, Odd for a Stout.

Taste did not deliver quite the overwhelming blueberry flavor that I picked up on it the aroma, but it was still present. Some standard roast malt and chocolate was present as well. Not the thickest stout by any means but a nice medium profile in mouthfeel which almost seemed more appropriate since its a fruit stout.

The caramel and dark malt flavors form a solid base for the blueberry to be supported by with mild toastiness and semi-dry flavor as it finishes. I really enjoyed this and think it has just enough blueberry without going overboard and losing sight of the base stout. I am a fan of blueberry so I could probably enjoy it in any style as long as it is done well. I think Dark Horse did a great job of combining the two flavors.","Slatetank","Jul 03, 2011"

Smells exactly like chocolate covered blueberries. Awesome. Taste is pure bittersweet dark chocolate covered dried blueberries. A very complex balance between the roasted and chocolate flavors and the blueberry. An almost perfect level of carbonation leaves this beer feeling very crisp yet smooth and creamy. Overall, this is a shockingly exceptional beer. I was expecting this to be way different with a fake tasting fruit flavor. This is a beer I could drink all night long without getting tired of it, especially at the 4.5% ABV it has.

It's a nice combination of a very dry and bitter stout with the perceived (aromatic) sweetness of blueberries making for a phenomenal balance. I usually prefer a hefty stout with twice the alcohol, but this was just as satisfying. I'm glad to see it get good ratings, since the blueberry thing might pigeonhole it with some people as somewhat of a novelty. And I didn't even think of myself as much of a blueberry fan before trying it.","AnonymousNick","Apr 24, 2011"

Not overtly carbonated, but that was ok because the mouthfeel wasn't terrible viscous. Thought it could have used some more carbonation and heavier mouthfeel. The nose is wonderful blueberry. Not much more than that with a hint of caramel maltiness. Not as much blueberry on the taste, kind of not loving the flavor as much as the nose. The malty roasty flavors I like in a stout aren't really prevalent. Overall good beer, glad I tried it, wouldn't seek it out.","wchollif","Apr 20, 2011"

4.34,9.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Overall I really liked this beer and it tasted just as good as it did a year ago. This beer had some complexity to it and had great balance between roasty stout flavors and freshly picked blueberry's. I thought the combination of blueberry's worked really well with this beer, it really makes it stick out from all the other stouts on the market, one whiff of this and you know it's not your average stout. I am going to have to go back to the store and grab another four pack before this beer disappears till next year. If you like your stouts with a twist and are looking for a fruit stout done right look no further this one is on point. I find a lot of fruit infused stouts don't turn out that good and taste artificial, well this one doesn't, Dark Horse hit the nail on the head with this brew. This is my favorite beer from the their stout series, don't pass this one up.","StoutHunter","Apr 16, 2011"
4.65,17.1,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark thick color with a finger or so of thick, dark foam that lingers. The blueberries come through best on the nose on top of the large roasted scent of the barley. Only a hint of blueberry comes through in the flavor profile, but it is there, especially lingering at the end between sips. The main flavor is of a robust, roasted stout. The mouthfeel is pleasantly thick for the style. Overall, this is a pretty darn tasty drink, and the low ABV lends itself to being a good session beer.","RedSpecial1","Apr 09, 2011"
4.08,2.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"O: I am pretty impressed with this. I really like the way the blueberries play with the chocolate and roast. And at only 4.5%, I could have a few of em. Reccomended. Skal.","Gtreid","Apr 07, 2011"

Taste is a lot more delicious than I was expecting. Great blueberry flavor followed by coffee and dark fruits...then some chocolate and roasted flavors. Finishes with more blueberry. There is strong sweetness throughout. So much flavor for such a low ABV beer. Mouthfeel is pretty standard for a stout. Not to thin, and not overly thick like an imperial stout. Drinkability is high.

1.84,-53.7,4,2.5,1.5,2,1,"Mouthfeel is fairly thin for the style. Carbonation is on the high side making for a fizzy/odd mouthfeel. I'm in the minority here but I thought this was an awful beer.

4.18,5.3,5,4.5,4,4,4,"This brew, and the others in the line, are good, but so burnt tasting. It is difficult for me to pick out other traits when the roast character is so prevalent.

3.3,-16.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"I have mixed feelings on this beer. I was enjoying it with the exception of the carbonation so I tried to swirl it down which didn't seem to help much. A good swirl brought forth some off, almost stale aromas and the flavors seemed in disarray, too. I'm taking it with a grain of salt as I otherwise enjoyed this beer; I've simply never encountered this before.","Ryan011235","Mar 27, 2011"
3.96,-0.3,3,4.5,4,3,4,"The aroma is particularly good on this stout; there is a lot of fresh blueberry aroma, along with nutty, chocolaty, and yeasty aromas to compliment. The beer pours with a very deep black color and a head that stays around the rim of the glass leaving a swirl on top of the beer. From the smell I expected this to be very fruity, which in it's own right it is, however not in an alcipop sort of way. The initial flavors are of a very strong and bitter stout. Flavors that hit the tongue right off the bat are a little overwhelming but very nice to pick through. The blueberry introduces the beer at the tip of the tongue while strong flavors of wood and dark roasted coffee take over. The back of the tongue gets a deep almost burnt malt flavor which dances well with the hop bitterness. The flavors are so intense that it reminds me of an imperial stout! The palate is almost bizarre as the beer slides across your tongue but is somewhat harsh going down. Overall this is absolutley worth a try (or even a case)","BieresDesMoines","Mar 23, 2011"

4.06,2.3,5,4,4,4,4,"(bottle courtesy of jcnd9803). Pours black with 2 finger chocolate head. Lots of fine carbonation bubbles. Aroma has dark chocolate, blueberry, roasted coffee.

A nice beer, but wish the blueberry was a bit stronger. Still, I like this this quite a bit.","trappistlover","Mar 19, 2011"

3.97,0,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and full. The mouth pucker is weird but not a killer. Finish is drier than usual for the style because of the fruity character, but that's ok. The beer is drinkable as well, although not as drinkable as other stouts out there due to the blueberry effect on the mouthfeel. Abv is not noticeable, and finish is good though it could be better. Great fruit stout, as there aren't many that can pull something like this off.","veinless","Mar 18, 2011"
3.44,-13.4,3,4,3.5,3,3,"Half pint at Black Swan Brew Pub, Plainfield, Indiana. Poured a very nice deep brown, near black, but with no head and very little lacing. Nice stout aroma, with decent roasted grains, along with a huge blueberry scent; mingles together nicely. Decent flavor, but the blueberries almost completely overwell the stout; you do get a bit of nice roasted grains, but mostly it's berry. Goes down fine, nothing grand, nothing bad. Wish it has slightly less blueberry, since this was a blueberry stout, and not a stout blueberry.","JamesS","Mar 17, 2011"
4.6,15.9,5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is the last of the stout series I had yet to try. I thought Too Cream Stout was good, but this is phenomenal! Jet black, orange-tan head. Robust, roasted coffee and dark chocolate with a whisp of fresh blueberries. Flavor is brief blueberry that explodes into roasted coffee, patent malt, toffee. Brief end of blueberry/fruitiness and finishes deep roast, malt bitterness. Carbonation that bounces flavor off the taste buds. This is not a fruit beer! However, the blueberry lends a complexity and finish like no other. Absolute mastery! If you haven't tried the stout line from Dark Horse - go out and try them! But save this one for last! Stout that is extremely and dangerously drinkable.","arkurzynski","Mar 15, 2011"

Aroma is wonderfully unique with huge notes of fresh blueberries backed by roasted malts, dark chocolate, earth, and a bit of peat with hints of coffee and cinnamon oatmeal. Flavor is great as well, never tasted anything like it really. Tastes like blueberry spiked coffee with notes of dark chocolate, roast, and dry barley with a hint of ash.

The promised blueberry is present in the nose but blended well with notes of bitter chocolate, roasted malt, and a dab of caramel. This definitely has all the flavor of a good American stout. The bitter chocolate and roasted malt is in there, mixed with a shot of coffee and a dab of blueberry. The blueberry takes a backseat in this stout which is nice. I'm not sure of the IBUs but there is a moderate hop presence but hardly noticeable. Medium/full body and the medium carbonation play perfectly in the mouth.

4.5,13.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"At Smokin' Joe's this beer was amazing, dark roasted malts bring out that dark chocolate/slight coffee hint. As the nose opens up you realize there's a nice earthy blueberry character taking hold, low alcohol minimalizes interference from other flavors. Overall you take the first sip and you realize dark roasted malts/creaminess/blueberry all at once almost overwhelming but excessently awesome version of a fruit stout. I will grab a four pack when available in OH, but this version on tap at Smokin' Joe's was my beer of the night. Mouthfeel was creamy alcohol was smooth or non-existent on the palate, excellent version of a great beer. Drinkability overall was Class A, the type of beer I want to experience again and again from today's craft brewing industry...you can just tell this beer is labor intensive.","WVbeergeek","Feb 12, 2011"

4.1,3.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This pours a medium bodied black with a one finger, creamy dark khaki head. It looks like it should. The aromas are of light blueberry, bitter chocolate, and light malty sweetness. You definitely pick up the blueberry first but it isn't overpowering by any means. The flavors too are blueberry upfront followed by both sweet and bitter chocolates and a mild coffee roast. The blueberry presents itself well here as well. This beer drinks very, very smoothly and is overly drinkable. The flavors and aromas are presented quite well and get the blueberry across in a light and appealing manner. This is one of Dark Horse's better offerings and worth a try.","aasher","Feb 08, 2011"

The flavor is different, as the fruit is much more apparent. I get a lot of blueberry character as well as some roasted malt and a touch of smoke.

As advertised, smells like dark roasted malt, blueberries, and a dash of cocoa. Quite nice for a stout consumed on a summer day. The flavor is in accord - charred malts, blueberries, and cocoa. Never had a blueberry stout before, but this definitely works. Blueberries aren't so strong as to push this into a nasty fruit beer mess, nor so subtle that you barely notice them. Nor is this beer excessively sweet. Body is medium with lots of carbonation. If this really is only 4.5%, it's surprising, as I would guess it's more like 6.5-7%.

With the blueberries it makes it interesting and a nice change from the ordinary. Nice rich velvety stout, a bit on the sweet side, a touch of roasted coffee and cocoa.

3.68,-7.3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a stiff black malt earthiness as well a touch of chocolate malt sweetness. The blueberry aroma is fresh and damn enticing. There is a nice roasted character here. The taste is decent. It's bone dry with lots of roasted black malts present. It goes down easy with a bit of prickly carbonation. The blueberry flavoring seems artificial; most likely extract, which is disappointing. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is an interesting beer that I believe needs some minute tinkering. It's a good drinker that I wouldn't shy away from buying in the future.","WesWes","Mar 06, 2010"
4.05,2,4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a rich, dark, near black with a minimal khaki colored head, minimal retention and ok lacing. Smell is of earth, ash, roasted nuts, cocoa powder and blueberry. Dark roasted malts are at the forefront with a earthy, ashy quality to them. The blueberry comes through and does not over power, akin to a blueberry pancake. Hints of cocoa powder and a slight bittering at the end. Body is medium, semi creamy with maybe a touch too much carbonation. Very nice beer where the fruit flavor is neither over or underpowered in relation to the other ingredients, would have prefered a little more body and creamyness to compliment the flavors.","rfgetz","Mar 04, 2010"

It's a nice balance that blends really well. The blueberries aren't too intense or overwhelming and lend nicely to the roasty, chocolaty flavors of the stout. Like a homemade blueberry muffin.

The quaff also has lots of blueberry in it with a nice crisp bitter finish. I really am enjoying the taste of this beer, something new to me but the sweetness is very well balanced with the malty and bitter notes from this style. Mouthfeel is fairly think.

Creamy medium thick body with minimal carbonation.

3.89,-2,3.5,4.5,4,3,3.5,"The beer pours amazingly dark, just like the other two to this point. The head on this one comes out fighting. I mean well over an inch, pushing 2. But the bubbles are loose and rush very quickly, pushing the dark liquid up on top of them. Really interesting to see, but if you look away for just a second, the head is gone. The smell, without question, immediately reminds me of blueberry muffins. I mean it's very bready, a bit grainy, filled with overripe, caramelized blueberries. Maybe a day-old blueberry muffin, one that's a little cold. Very good. The smell, if you look for it has a nice roastiness, a bit of dark chocolate, some light coffee smells, some burnt bits. It says it's a blueberry stout, and when you smell it, you can tell. The taste keeps on where the smell ends. There a great burst of ripe blueberry in each taste, but almost no tartness like young blueberries. There's an incredible breadiness, sweet an cakey, but efinitely not too sweet. You get a bit of burnt bread, a tiny bit of chocolate, that's the extent of roastiness. The body on this is nice, not too heavy and full, not like the others, (but I suppose that it's tough when the ABV is so much less), but the carbonation definitely does not have the same burst. as the others. Pretty normal, with a bit of a slickness from the fruit. The drinkability on this is pretty good. I mean, it's not going to hamper further drinking too much, as some flavored beers tend to do, and the ABV isn't too high. But the fruitiness would keep me from coming back to this often.","taylorhamrick","Sep 17, 2009"

Highly recommended.","biegaman","Sep 11, 2009"

4.15,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"At 4.5% this is a ridiculously delicious beer that won't kill you in the drinking.

It's quite drinkable though the blueberry limits what you can pair it with, more a dessert beer but normally I look for something a little heavier in that category. Nonetheless, delicious all around.

4.04,1.8,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Roast is much more pronounced in the flavor, with a burnt coffee core that holds up notes of chocolate and toasted caramel. The blueberry is all but an afterthought--a vinous tart note that's overridden by a snappy, almost impeding carbonation level. The body is as thin as you'd expect for a 4.5% stout, with a smooth finish that leaves some sticky residuals as if it were a much bigger Imperial Stout. Still, the low ABV adds to the drinkability, as does the fact that this is a very tasty beer from a solid Michigan brewery.","wagenvolks","Aug 20, 2009"
4.19,5.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The taste was overwhelmingly of blueberry with a sweetness that seemed true to the fruit itself. Some mocha chocolate notes, a slightly understated coffee presence, more sweet than bitter and quite delicious. The real bitterness, although understated, came at the finish with a touch of nutty astringency that lasted quite long. There was a slightly creamy texture and it was a bit thin in body for a stout. I could drink several of these in a sitting, an abundance of natural berry fruit set in a dark malt backdrop,very nicely done by Dark Horse Brewing Company, another winning recipe well worth the $1.99 I paid for it at Merchants in Dearborn; too bad I didn't pick up six more of these!","ThatWineGuy","Aug 18, 2009"

Blueberry is sprinkled in and definetely has an interesting effect, more in the finish. The blueberry is what makes this not quite as good as the too cream stout.

The flavor follows suit almost to a tee. Milk chocolate fudge, cream, and blueberry juice. The blueberries in the flavor remind me more of an artificial blueberry then the actual fruit. The mouthfeel is a bit dry. I thought there might be oatmeal in the mash but the creaminess dies in the finish. Dryness is all I get from the tip of the tongue.

Aromas are obvious sweet blueberries, roasted malts, and chocolate. Mouth-feel is creamy and smooth. Flavors are milk chocolate, espresso, and finishes fairly boldly with roasted malts and fresh, ripe blueberries that are not overbearing in flavor - this was something I was concerned with prior to drinking it. They were actually quite pleasant. I liked this unique stout and it was worth the try, given it was in a series of 5, but wouldn't try it again.","barnzy78","Apr 07, 2009"

Tastes of rich roasted grains, caramel, mocha, and real blueberries. Nothing artificial or fake about the smell and taste of the blueberries.

You have to use your tongue to clean off your teeth, it's that thick. Scrumptious good. Mouthful is exceptional and thus the drinkability is very high, too.

This beer has a very large nose, with tons of blueberry and some carmel notes, basically it smells like a blueberry pie/tart. The taste as well is very well composed with a nice amount of blueberries and a nice dark malt base, I would imagine this beer has a much higher % of dark malts compared to other American stouts.

Fascinating smell. The taste isn't quite as nice as the aroma but still good with the dark roasted malts and bittersweet chocolates dominating. The blueberries are present but not overwhelming, making for a nice, balanced flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with tons of carbonation and leaves the palate tingling.

Zero lacing present during the tasting. Scent of blueberry syrup dominates with just a subtle suggestion of chocolate in the background. Blueberry flavoring is significantly masked by a strong malt presence, in addition to a well-balanced chocolate and coffee character. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Starts off slightly viscous at the front, but a light carbonation balances it out at the finish. Drinkability is outstanding. This brew went down easy and left me wanting for more.

Medium to medium full in body, low in carbonation, and very smooth and creamy with a nice unique blueberry twist that is very easy to detect but not detracting of the other flavors.

2.96,-25.4,4,3,3,3,2.5,"Thanks to autumnaldave for this bonus bottle. This pours practically black, with a very dark tan head that dissipates quickly. Smells of blueberry, molasses, and surprisingly alcohol. Tiny bit of chocolate coming through as it warms. Diving in, there's clearly a solid dry stout flavor profile here - roasty coffee, chocolate, slight nuttiness and faint oak bitterness, but the blueberry sweetness is just derailing it for me. It just dosen't mesh. Liking the dry finish but it clashes a bit with the lingering, increasingly cloying fruit. Bitterness leaves off with a strange herbal twang. Very thin mouthfeel, heavily carbonated - same sort of seltzer-like quality I noted in Double Crooked Tree. Could use a bit more body, maybe an oatmeal version, and maybe dialing back the bitter/dryness. Novel effort, but I'd much rather drink the (clearly quite good) plain old stout here that's been dressed up.","grandq","Apr 28, 2008"
4.23,6.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer pours and looks like motor oil with a thin, creamy looking, mocha colored head. The nose has a nice wiff of blueberries on first smell and a deeper examination reveals subtle chocolate and coffee notes. Taste is nice, an intro to sweet blueberry followed by the finish of a dry stout, coffee being prevalent. The mouthfeel is viscous and very lightly carbonated.

4.37,10.1,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"So dark that you can't see through the pour. Yields better than a full finger foamy dark tan head that fades fairly quickly, leaving spotty lacing patterns. Hey, guess what it smells like... no seriously... it starts out with a distinct celebration of blueberries then settles out to a low-roasted chocolate stout that sells its edge to the berry. Blueberry's aren't naturally very fragrant. This bottle has a residue on the lip that picks up berry-roast combo as a muffin-like aroma. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is smooth, rich and tingles nicely in a medium body. The flavor is really nice too. A solid stout character that trades what might have been a modestly roasted chocolate flavor with that of the healthy blueberry. The berry taste isn't a big blast, but it lingers long enough to be considered well. Its really a cinch to drink. A little warming on the way down, but otherwise well integrated. This one scores maximum points for imagination!! Besides the New Glarus products, this Dark Horse is one of the first Fruit/Vegetable beers that i wouldn't hesitate to stick in my grocery cart.

This beer is everything a stout should be; very dark, with a heavy roasted malt character, and an acrid bitterness with the added and welcome addition sweet/aromatic blueberries.

Taste starts off with a tiny bit of fresh blueberries which is quickly dominated by the big french roast coffee flavor. A bit of an oaky wood taste towards the end with some grassy hop flavors as well. I was hoping for just a bit more blueberry sweetness on the tongue with this one, but still a decent taste overall.

Taste starts out nice and roasty. Rich, roasted coffee and bitter dark chocolate work nicely together. Hints of floral fruitiness soon become stronger with noticeable blueberry essence mid-palate. Strong coffee bitterness, baking chocolate, and slight roasted grain astringency in the finish. Slightly warming. Medium-bodied (could be a bit fuller IMO) with a dry, slightly metallic finish.

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark Horse's Tres Blueberry Stout is an interesting see-saw of a beer, hitting you upfront with a sweetish and somewhat tart blueberry flavor and aroma (there's less in the aroma than the flavor), and then turning spot-on-a-dime and hammering home dark, rich malts with a solid bitterness and roasted character. The fruitiness helps to cut through it and keep it refreshing, or at least interesting, while the blunt darkness of the end-side offers it great depth. Some grassy, leafy hops flutter here and there in the finish, and there's an edge of black coffee ""acrid"" character (but it's not acidic as many beers this dark can be) and dark bittersweet chocolate, but very little blueberry. Odd!!! It's an unusual combination that works, and although I've seen this done with raspberry and cherry, I think that the blueberry might be a better (or at least more distinct) choice because it stands out so readily. And of course we're talking about extract here, but it really makes no difference. It does the job, and it's done nicely. In fact, you couldn't do it with real blueberries, they just wouldn't cut it. They'd ferment through and leave too little behind (and more of a fruit-pulp character than any recognizable blueberry). As for drinkablility however, I'm not sure the playfulness and teeter-totter gentility of this beer could keep up beyond one serving. It's very well done and interesting, but I think I'd have to move on after one or two of these. Certainly worth trying however!","NeroFiddled","Feb 20, 2007"

Anyway, the aroma consists of chocolate and fresh blueberry skins. The taste has a lush blueberry taste to it blended with a rich stout flavor. The blueberry is fresh and real... not at all like a concentrate or syrup. It reminded me of the Jersey blueberries we pick in summer while visiting my wife's grandma in Indiana. The blueberry taste is definitely featured here in the stout and is done without comprising the stout characteristics of the beer. Powdery dry finish to wrap things up.

Blueberry is really big on the nose and underneath is a bitter burnt grain odor that i expect from nice bitter stouts. do they meld well? kind of. i can smell the blueberry from three feet away, which is interesting. Taste is pretty interesting too...and it has 3 stages. First its just a blast of heavy blueberry juice, then you get the burnt roasted malt of the stout and then the finish is a nice blend of the two. The blueberry falls more into the background as i drink more and its more of just a good stout. Full, nicely put together beer. Not a great drinkin', swiggin' beer but its made well and interesting to drink.

4.42,11.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"12 oz bottle. 9 oz sample. Pours a deep dark black color with a half finger of brown head that falls to just a full coat over top. No light comes through the brew, and no carbonation is apparent. No doubt about this one being a stout. Nose tells me that its a blueberry stout. Initial aromas are full blueberry, almost like a fresh squezed berry, hanging over a malty chocolate base, with a hint of coffee hanging on the end. Its interesting to take a deep inhale and see how it progressed from blueberry to stout over the course of a few seconds. For what it is supposedto be, I have to say the aroma really carries the flag. Flavor definately portrays both characteristics. Taking air over the beer as its in my mouth brings moderate notes of blueberry that hang over a nice base of chocolate, coffee and roast. Swallowing the beer blends the blueberry nicely with the chocolate, and mocha notes. On the finish, the roasted character really comes through, leaving a very mild bitter, but not something I would attribute to hops, but to the blueberry and coffee. I enjoy this one even thought I don't like blueberry all that much. I think it works well in the stout. Feel is nice and thick, with a very light carbonation. I definately have to say, I am surprised by this one. I obtained it because of the novelty of having a blueberry stout, but I am more than pleased with how enjoyable this one has been.

The body and carbonation were on the light side of medium and produced a slightly creamy texture. There was a little dryness as well. I was surprised at how well the blueberry flavour came through, particularly with all the dark malts. Different and tasty!","DrJay","Apr 24, 2006"

2.83,-28.7,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Black as night. Moderately aromatic, with notes of blueberry pancakes, coffee, anise and chocolate. Taste is odd, revealing more than twice its potency in flavor. A subtle blueberry flavor is present but it distracts from other flavors more than contributing a flavor. Notes of anise, ginger, strong coffee grounds and a hint of blueberry.","Crosling","Apr 12, 2006"
4.32,8.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is very creamy. The beer has a medium body. This is just one fantastic gem of a stout. The beer is very well balanced between sweet maltyness and hoppyness.","nlmartin","Apr 06, 2006"
4.12,3.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Mmmm aroma is a crusty baked blueberry pie served right next to a steaming cup of quality roasted coffee. Deep black color in the body with a very dark brown pinky thin, creamy head. Fore is roasty with chooclate and coffee notes..slightly bitter then the bluberries kick in toward the middle. Lots of bitter dark chocolate, cocoa and coffee flavors collide with the blueberry notes in the finish. This is a damn tasty beer and it is not lost in the blueberry notes...its still very much a stout first.","Jredner","Feb 24, 2006"
3.75,-5.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability is good based simply on what this is. A blueberry stout. If this had a profoundly delicious taste, it would be the ultimate in dangerous. The drinkability would be off the hook. This beer made me skeptical from the jump, but as I started to ponder the possibilities it led me to hope. Ultimately this brew was very disappointing. So much potential.","SupaCelt","Feb 13, 2006"

3.42,-13.9,4,4.5,3,3,3,"I love stouts and blueberries, so I had to give this one a try. Very dark black in color, with a thin tan colored head that didn't last long. The best part of this brew is the smell. Lots of blueberries with hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste is pretty much the same with the blueberries taking a backseat to the coffee and chocolate flavours. A medium-heavy bodied mouthfeel, not much carbonation. I would recommend this stout to anybody, its worth a try, but not a session brew.","BigDaddyWil","Dec 13, 2005"

3.95,-0.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,3,"A very well crafted crossover between a stout and a fruit beer. Poured out to an onyx black color with a nice 1 inch brown foamy head. Medium low level of carbonation, and many rings of lace are some of the characteristics that make this brew very stout like. Aroma is sweet and earthy, with a powerful natural blueberry aroma, almost like blueberry pancake syrup. Taste is very very unique; flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt and blueberry are all very present, and seem to work out ok. I give this brew a 4 for taste in the sense that the flavors are there, but they don't mesh all that well. Mouthfeel is again very stout like, heavy and dense. Drinkability is fair; i'd have this every once in awhile, but not all that often. Worth a try.","Frozensoul327","Dec 06, 2005"

4.23,6.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Nice crisp body cuts through the richness of the malt and keeps the beer on its toes. Very nice bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. The restraint of the fruitiness, and the level of integration make this an easy one to down. Great job!","Realale","Sep 26, 2004"

3.7,-6.8,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Pretty beer. Pitch black with a dark tan head that doesnt fade immediately, but doesnt last. The bluebeery aroma is nice and is the first thing you notice. Under that is a bit of hop and chocolate. The malts take dominance in the flavor with chocolate laying down the foundation of the flavor with toast and a little char filling in the cracks. The blueberry is there in the flavor, but not so strongly.","aracauna","Jun 07, 2004"
3.65,-8.1,4,4,3.5,4.5,3,"Thanks to trbeer for the bottle. A good beer to have one of, but maybe I'm just not a fan of blueberry and hence don't care for the flavor much. Still, maybe have a single one again in the future.","beergeek279","Mar 18, 2004"
3.93,-1,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"It was good. Interesting. I had my little PBR 8-oz or whatever glass of this during a movie, so it had a chance to sit and warm and change a bit. It was a dark stout brown color with a small tan head. It smelled like blueberry muffins and coffee, nice and roasty/toasty. It tasted similar, not too much blueberry though, more of the roasted malt and coffee flavour. I've seen blueberry muffin coffee at 7-eleven but was always afraid to try it. I think it may be similar to this beer. The blueberry taste did shine through a bit more as time went on, but I think I would've liked more berries in there. Mouthfeel was ok, maybe a little watery and thin for a stout, so drinkability suffers a bit. I'd try it again but I'm not upset that i don't have another bottle right here and now. Overall a decent beer with an interesting flavour.","erica","Feb 24, 2004"
4.07,2.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Opaque black with tan edges. Aromas of blueberry cake, chocolate, and a hint of hoppy caramel. Taste is roasty, toasty, and sweet.

4.12,3.8,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"I've never heard of a blueberry stout until I saw this one at my local beer store. It poured very dark, almost pitch black but not quite, with a weak dark head. There were some signs of oxidation which was this beer's main problem. But it was so unique and tasty. I didn't even have to smell the beer, the blueberries came out and smacked my nose with a strong-ass scent. The actual taste had a lot of roastiness. It actually was so roasty that it was smoky. Blueberry was still prevalent. It reminded of toast with blueberry jam on it. Tarty finish. I need more Dark Horse products.","granger10","Oct 31, 2003"
4.18,5.3,5,4.5,4,4,4,"Quite amazing stuff. It would earn a perfect score if it gained some sort of cohesion or balance. Perhaps a lighter touch with the roasties would help.","putnam","Sep 06, 2003"
3.85,-3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Quite the little beer here from Dark Horse. Neat B&W label. Dark brown/black in color with a deep tan, porter-like head. Definite blueberry aroma but mixed with a deep roasted aroma. Roasted flavor hits the tongue first and mellows to a nice chocolate-blueberry flavor. Pretty easy to drink. I'd certainly have this a few more times. It'd pair nicely with a chocolate cake if you're sick of your standard chocolate cake beer, whatever that might be.","marburg","Mar 17, 2003"
3.53,-11.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Much thanks to trbeer for this brew. I have been waiting to try this one for awhile. Pours black with a small tan head that seems to last. Malt, fruit, blueberry and grain are what I smell. The taste is malt, smoke, blueberry and coffee. Very good but not great. The aftertaste is very much coffee and chocolate. I would love to try this on tap some place.","CharlesRiver","Feb 28, 2003"
3.93,-1,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"You'd think that Dark Horse BC pays 4th graders to create their labels in sweat-shops. What appears to be a Mobius strip and either: 1) a rabbit turd, 2) a red blood cell, or 3) a tomato, adorn this label. You'd think they would put a blueberry on the...oh wait. Nevermind. This beer looked a little oily when I was pouring, so I thought I'd try to give it a little head with a vigorous pour and ended up with some of it on my countertop. Oily, absolutely ebony-black with a quickly thinning dark-brown head resembling espresso crema. No lace at all. Nada. The aroma is rich with dark-roasted grains, dark coffee, a sweet little tang of blueberries, subtle hops and a wisp of alcohol. Mouthfeel is moderately smooth, thick and oily, with a medium-strong body. Taste starts with lots of dark-roasted malts, followed by dark coffee and chocolate, a metallic note, a dry whisky character, and then giving way to an unpleasant alcohol bite, which thankfully only last a short instance before the nice finish with a pronounced nutty, coffee-bean character. The blueberries are only evident in aroma and one is never cognizant of their presence otherwise. The alcohol becomes evident as the brew warms, taking on an isopropyl character and giving me an odd sensation. Again, dunno what the ABV is, but it gives me a wierd little buzz. These guys seem to have a way with stouts:) Enjoy.","Mitchster","Feb 24, 2003"
