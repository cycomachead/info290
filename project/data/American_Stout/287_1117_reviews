"O- I accidentally aged this one that got lost in the back of the cellar, but it ages gracefully! All of the flavors are meshed and mellow, good stuff"
"Coffee flavor, a little bit burned, chocolate? and Tick, a little bit hop"
""
""
""
"Dark color. Mild coffee hints with a roasted and smokey flavor.  Good body but pretty rich."
"Very poor example of a stout."
"Thick coffee aroma, full bodied roasted coffee beans. Heavy chocolate and a little bitter."
"Easily the worst stout I've ever had. Some guy at a local beer store recommended it to me over the Left Hand Milk Stout. What a poor brew. The taste was bland and it took forever to drink. One beer took me about 45 minutes to suffer through. I'm a big fan of Bell's brewery but this beer is simply pathetic. I would suggest avoiding this beer at all costs. It's simply not worth the time to drink it or the money to pay for it."
"Tasted from a 12 oz bottle on March 29, 2015."

"Just ok! Disappointed thought it would be more like muddy! Little bitter."
"Taste:  Dry and nicely crispy, roasted malt, some hot alcohol at the end, a little smoke in the middle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thick, dark, grainy and somewhat smokey with a definite hop presence. The vegetal smell seems a little off."
""
"A perfect example of the non-barrel aged, non-imperial American stout. The thing that's great about this beer is that it lacks a gimmick, and doesn't try to do anything that takes it away from being a great stout. The roasty burnt finish is divine."
""
""
"O: This is a nice everyday stout, something I could drink regularly. It has a nice mellow coffee dark chocolate bitterness up front, some roasted malt flavors in the middle, a semi dry finish, definitely drinkable, worth a try if you love stouts but the price might keep me away as I can get a stout just as good for less than $10 a six-pack compared to that was well over $10 for the six-pack."
"yeah, I gave it a 5 in look. it's beautiful. most beer is. the flavor is nice but for some reason seems thin at the end. but it's good, nonetheless. like some of their other stuff, this is an easy going brew. reminds me of Modern Times' stuff in the way it appeals across the ranks, although Modern Times is quickly turning on my palate due to the ultra sweet malts and flavors ALL their brews have. sorry to get off track.... this one is very good."

"Perfect blend of roasted grains, coffee, molasses and chocolate in a stout. Hands-down, this would be one of my top choices for an everyday stout if only it didn't cost north of 13 bucks a 6 pack."
"Just an average stout. Expected more,very little coffee and licorice .Disappointing"

"This was a decent beer overall. Wouldn't be my first choice typically, but I'm glad I tried it."
""
""
""
"Thin, watery, terrible body. No interesting tastes, just bland nothingness. Barely any smell. This is an awful stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very average beer. Not great, not bad"
"Pours a deep black with khaki colored head. Coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, and some nice molasses notes on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with some sweetness, more molasses and chocolate."
""
""
"Roasty flavor after taste.  Good body."
""
""
""
"Postscript note:  The bottled date on the beer was 2/18/13, and I drank this beer on 2/17/14, which, if my math is correct, and I was never good at math, but I can do this math, the beer was almost a year old to the day.  If this lower ABV beer was this good, aged (accidently) almost to a year to the day, I have to try a more fresh bottle to see if its better.  That being said, if you happen upon an older bottle of this beer, up to and including a year old (though maybe even older would be good too), don’t worry, you’ll enjoy it!"
""
""
""
"Flavor is rich and roasty, with a charred character hitting mid palate and carrying into the finish, where there's a slightly sweet reprise of chocolate. Nutty malt offers strong support. A little more charred than I care for. Dark cherry emerges as it warms."
""
""
"The nose is toffee and cocoa with a sniff of drip coffee. Perfectly carbonated with a smooth mouthfeel. The liquorice back end dances with your tastebuds and gives this an extra element that elevates the beer to another level. Fantastic."
""
"Not bad, but flavor seems a bit weird. Better stouts are out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Extremely light bodied for a stout. Carbonation was fine"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, a little disappointed with Bells lately. Kalamazoo needs a little something more to be better then just above average. I don't really pick up the licorice, but I do get a nice amount of dark coco. I would drink again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to search for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.06): This is just a good ol standard stout, nothing more or less. It has a good chocolate presence with a hefty amount of roasted malts and coffee character with undertones of smoke and licorice. It wont knock ur socks off, but it does hit the spot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good, not my favorite, but much better than the dagger stout I had sampled same trip to Bell's."
"It tastes like black licorice, but not in a way that makes you say, ""Aw, shit...no one likes black licorice."" It's good."

"The smell made my mouth water and want a drink. The first drink was fantastic the flavor was deep and rich. It has a slight bite very slight. I Its a great beer. I have had better stouts like left hand brewing companies nitro but that being said this is still a fantastic beer."

"Pours an almost-black deep brown. There's a thin-ish medium-light tan head that mostly dissipates quickly but leaves some nice soapy lacing. The aroma is light roasted notes with a little alcohol sweetness. The taste is very good but not particularly complex, with a deeper roasted tone and maybe a hint of chicory. The body is thinner and smooth."
""
"O:  A terrific sipper.  Great with cheddar cheese or something chocolate."
""
""
""
""

"O-    Drink ability is high, flavor is well balanced. Definitely a stout I will search for when craving one"

"Overall, I can hardly imagine a better stout.  I feel like I could just knock these back one right after the other, and with the relatively low ABV, I probably could!  Absolutely perfect flavors and feeling - they really hit this one out of the park!"

"BOD 2/22/14.  Pitch black pour with a very good head.  Lacing and retention are also very good. Surprisingly light nose of chocolate and roast over a mineral note.  Rich heavy medium body with a nice creamy texture.  Below average carbonation with almost no effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is balanced, but lacks the complexity found in world class stouts.  It begins with chocolate, fades to roast and flows into a mild sweetness with a licorice note.  Hops and roast create a slightly bitter middle with just a hint of coffee and NO dark fruit.  The finish is slightly astringent."

"O: The word ""licorice"" in the description scared me (I hate licorice). But there are no discernible ""licorice"" flavors in the beer. I mark that as a big plus. Very nice roast flavor with a modest 6.0% ABV. There are not a lot of complexities of chocolate and coffee - but this is still a well made and good tasting stout."
""

"Cheers!"

"Yesterday was a very brisk day for May, so I wanted a beer to match. Bell's Kalamazoo Stout didn't disappoint. A bold, fragrant heavy brew that matched the dark, overcast day. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who loves a classic, dark stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This ""Stout brewed with Brewers Licorice"" pours black with a very small tan. Lots of lacing after each sip that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of chocolate, coffee and licorice with roasted malt. Very nice smell of the mixed flavors! Lots going on with the taste as would be expected. Not overpowering though. Perfect amount of carbonation. Very pleasant overall and would rate this a good solid '8' if not a '8.5'."
""
"o: its pretty good. a nice balance of flavors that is really smooth in the mouth and makes for a nice drinker. body is just thin enough make it easy drinking a smooth sipper. really quite enjoyable!"
"O - A very enjoyable and moderately complex porter."
"overall there isn't a whole lot of upfront taste. But then it comes fairly heavy, not overwhelming. This is a really tasty stout but if I had one complaint it would be that the aftertaste builds towards bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very nice lower abv stout. Really reminds me of Founders Porter in pretty much every way. There are some nice qualities that you usually find in a bigger imperial beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- well brewed, amazing appearance but too one sided on bitterness and dry mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
"Let me start by saying that this is my go to stout so I maybe a little bit partial in my judgment of this offering. It pours a very near black mahogany with a small tan head that leaves a great film and lacing. The nose is a robust blend of coffee, chocolate, black licorice, and dried fruit. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth yet still quite light for a stout. Definitely very easy to drink. The flavor is as deep and complex as the nose with the addition of a wonderful tobacco note and a chewy bitter finish that lasts long after last sip is taken. Sure I'd love to drink Founders Breakfast Stout, KBS, Big Bad Baptist, or Black Note every day but it's not available everyday, nor could I afford it. So I settle for this delicious and much more accessible stout. Pick up a six and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very full bodied with complex tastes. Dark chocolate and coffee flavors with almost a hint of licorice. Balances the significant hop presence against the roast malt body. When poured, offers a big head of dark beige and very dark brown in color. Caramel and vanilla undertones as well. Solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: slightly disappointed in the lack of a really distinct flavour, but this is going up on the list of all-around favourite stouts."

"O - I like it, not even close to some of Bell's other stuff (can you compare anything to Black Note)."
""
"This is a good stout. I'm very fond of this brewery. It's a nice deep dark color, can't see thru it. A thin brown head, kind of classic of a stout. The smell is pleasant and very bold. Tastes of rich dark malts, has a heavy coffee malt flavor for me. It's surprisingly dry which really is a nice addition for the mouth feel and drinkability of this beer. It's the first i've had that i'm aware of brewed with brewers licorice. I can't taste it and I do enjoy licorice so I guess i'm slightly disappointed I couldn't pick it apart in that regard from any other dark stout. I picked it out thinking it would be a bit more unique. But if you're a dark beer fan chances are good you will like this beer. You can never go wrong with Bell's."
""
"O: pretty damn good overall with something interesting at every phase of the experience. Definitely opens into a different place upon warmed state."
""
""
""
""
""
"I will give it credit for the better drafts and bottles I've had before."

""

"O: whatta class act Bell's has proven to be - this is a quality stout that'll satisfy most fans of the style, dark ales, porters, and the like - licorice is showcased quite nicely - I suppose if you dislike licorice, this beer may not strike you the way it struck me."
""
""
""
""
""
"I will try some more of Bell's Brewery's offerings since I have heard positive comments about the beers but do not believe I will return to their stout."
""

""

"good balance between coffee bitterness and sweet chocoaltiness. when you're a jersey kid in a PA bottle shop, you get whatever bell's has. I only got two actually, two hearted and this one and this one's a pass, can't say i'm blown away by it. looking forward to 2 hearted"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A smooth easy drinking stout that has sweetness and lots of earthy bitter notes to round out the taste. I was worried at first because I'm not a fan of licorice forward beers but it works well with this beer and compliments nicely. A great stout to stock up on."

"pours a used motor oil black that i cant see any light through. about 1 finger of a brown mocha colored frothy head that dissapates rather quickly. leaving good lacing on the glass. the smell is straight roasted coffee almost a milky chocolate ,lactose type note to the smell. i dont detect any of the licorice that used in the brewing process. the taste is pure coffee and creamy chocolate. nice bitterness & roastyness. i get the licorice on the back of the tounge just faintly after a sip. mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. this beer must be great on nitro tap if thats even available. overall a damn good stout! definatly something id pick up again. too bad the abv is a little to low for any real cellaring...cheers!"

"Drinkability: Another top stout without too much ABV, one of my favorites."
"Dark brown ale with a slight tan head. Has a roasty aroma and a slight roasty flavor with a hint of coffee in the finish. The beer is smooth and has a nice full body feel. Nicely balanced. This is a beer that is just a pure joy to drink on any occasion."

"O: overall, bittersweet with a tiny hint of licorice in the aftertaste.... not terribly hoppy, if at all.... darn good stout - I would certainly try this again"

"O - A very nice stout highlighted by an amazing body"
""
""

"Overall - A simple, well-crafted stout by an excellent brewery. It is flavorful and full bodied, and meets all the criteria you would like for in a regular stout."

"Seems to be pitch black, but close examination shows its just a little off, some brown hues in there, but thick and completely opaque. Nice light brown head that lingers and a lace that clings to the glass nicely. Nice smoky sweet aroma that is balanced by some maltiness and clean bitterness in the nose. The taste follows the aroma, very coffee bitter like with some dark chocolate and burnt wood flavors. Some deep fruit notes like raisins or plums, but only slight. There is a little hop bitterness that hangs out on your mouth with the burnt flavors to make a very pleasant aftertaste. Not groundbreaking, in my opinion, but a solid stout."
""
"Overall, a really good, if not excellent, stout. While the aroma is lacking a bit it is full of flavor and stops short of being over the top remaining quite drinkable. Very nice."

"So I picked up the Bell's Kalamazoo Stout without really checking it out. I figured, ""It's cold outside, a Stout sounds good."" It wasn't till I got home that I realized it was brewed with licorice. I've been a huge licorice fan since my childhood. It poured dark and silky into my glass. A nice coffee scent with just a hint of licorice. The taste was the same with very light carbonation. A great stout. I will definitely get this beer again!!!!"

"one of the great stouts of the Midwest, this is a real winner. shiny black, dense to light, and sporting a lovely just off white head over an inch tall, full of air, and leaving plenty of lace. big bitter roast barley aromatics with just enough hops. smoke, wet earth, and acidic coffee all contribute to the nose and taste of this beer as well, but what I love about it is its straightforward nature, no frills, just good roasty stout. its really clean for the style, finishing quickly and not drinking too heavy at all. kind of an all year stout rather than just a short day cold weather beer. its not overly creamy in feel either, with a slick sort of coating mouthfeel, thin enough to drink several off, but big enough to satiate me after that many. sweet in the middle comes out of nowhere, but the bitter finish triumphs. one of bells less exotic but most trustworthy beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall: This stout is low alcohol (6.0%) but it's a formidable beer on taste alone. The absence of coffee and the presence of dark chocolate, makes this a memorable beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: a nice lighter stout. not super unique or complex but very well done."

""

"Kalamazoo poured a gorgeous, creamy, 2 finger head with great lacing. But other than that, I felt the other factors being reviewed were too subdued for my taste. There were dark fruits, a little coffee, chocolate, and licorice in both the aroma and taste. All were on the lighter side except dark fruity sweetness and a sourness on the back end I didn't particularly care for. Mouthfeel was light with little carbonation."

"O: An excellent American stout that balances its intended flavors very well without overpowering your senses."
"This is a beer by which I've long been intrigued. It just keeps being superceded by other opportunities. I found a single on sale at the store today and decided to pull the trigger. I'm extremely glad I did. I would consider this in the upper tier of every-day stouts that I've had. It's got a good reputation, and it's one that is well earned. Bell's continues to impress me, and having only recently (a couple of months ago) moved to within their distro, I look forward to the continuing education in their zymurgical endeavours."
""

"Owing to brands like Kalamazoo as well as Expedition, Double Cream, Cherry and Java, Bell's became an elder statesman for American craft-brewed stouts even before it could legitimately be considered an elder. Like so many others, this beer was one of my first forays into stouts not named Guinness or Murphy's and I still enjoy it now as much as I did then."

"Overall: An excellent stout, and that's coming from an IPA lover who only recently developed a taste for stouts. Not a huge fan of black licorice so the aroma wasn't my favorite, but the roasted coffee flavors more than make up for it. Another hit for Bells."

"I cant believe I hadn't rated this beer. Nice and dark for a good stout. In fact i like putting this stout in my chili along with the Bells Porter for flavoring purposes. small to medium head. smooth tasting all the way down and really cant ask much more from this stout. Bell's always has fine products this one is no exception."

"O - really smooth/easy drinking stout. Probably best consumed relatively fresh if you want more flavor. Really smooth drinker but a bit mild"
""
"Poured from a bottle into an English pub style glass. Massive chocolate brown head that lingers and leave great lacing on the glass. The licorice notes are very evident along with some more subtle chocolate notes. This is a very drinkable stout; no overpowering coffee or chocolate here. Just a mild roasty flavor with little hoppy bitterness. Has a chewy mouth feel with minimal aftertaste. I enjoyed this one. And at less than $10 for a 6 pack, this could one of my seasonal favorites. A good, not great, everyday stout. Merry Christmas"

"O- To me the smell is better than the taste, had a bit to much bitterness for me, the flavor is pretty good, would have to be in the mood for the bite tho. The fizziness was a little more than I cared for, but passable. Would have another, but wont be stocking it."

"I poured this one from a bottle and the tan head and the black beer seemed right on for the style. The aroma was subdued, but that is what I expect from a stout. There was a little bit of roast, however. The flavor was little sweeter and a little less dry than I'd expect from a non-imperial stout. At 6% abv, it is a little stronger than some traditional stouts, but I still felt like a drier and more roasted profile would be better. I saw that they added licorice to it, so maybe this has something to do with it. I'd definitely have this one again, but there are others that I like more."
"I really enjoyed this - why does their porter lack the same dynamic, flavorful, and creamy qualities this has? This could pare well with a lot of food and desserts, and works well on its own. I hope to seek out more beers from Bell's that are more on this level for sure."

"Poured into nonic pint glass; jet black showing slight tinges of gentle brown in the sun on the edges. Very minimal fizzy tan head which fades to nothing rapidly; not sure how much it would have given even if she'd poured it more vigorously. Smell is dark roasted malt, gentle licorice, toffee and chocolate. Taste is dark, bitter roasted malt. Coffee, and a very slight (probably psychosomatic) hint of licorice. Hint of some hops at the end. Not much of the sweetness suggested by the smell; very roasty. Mouthfeel is surprisingly fizzy for the lack of head; overall medium-thin. Almost porter-like, if it weren't for the strong flavors."
""
"Other than the slightly unpleasant mouthfeel, this is a very good beer. The licorice seems to take a backseat to the more roasty, traditional notes of a good stout, so I would be curious to see how it changed with age."
""
""
""
"The body is pretty full with a nice thickness, and pleasantly creamy off a bite of crispness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An enjoyable beer that is a good example of this style. I'm not a big fan of licorice and was glad that that this was minimally present in the taste. As expected, this beer benefits from letting it warm up."

"O: Their Porter and Stout aren't making me too excited for their much lauded Expedition Stout. Too dry and without prominent flavors for me."

"O - A very good solid stout. Nice smokey and roasted coffee flavors. With it being a lighter feeling stout, a person could easily have multiples."

"Overall: A really great beer. The faint licorice flavors really compliment the roastiness of the malts. It's a fantastic combination, especially when you consider other adjuncts thrown into stouts (e.g. coffee, chocolate). I would love to taste a more heavy licorice flavor. I like black licorice, so the subtlety of the flavor makes an impact, but I would love to see it be a little more assertive."
"I really appreciate that Bell's has such variety and strong tastes, but that necessarily means that you're not going to like some of it."
""
""
"Overall: One of the best American Stouts out there, period. This is definitely under rated, if given the time and opportunity I can drink these all day. Kalamazoo Stout can hold up well to an oily cigar."
"O - For me Kalamazoo Stout is a year round Stout the craft brew lover can enjoy any time and enjoy multiple without the sloppiness. It packs all the flavors a good stout should all while remaining an easy offering. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys stouts as this is one of the best American stouts anyone in the world has to offer."

"Overall, I prefer more heft and body in a stout and I shouldn't work too hard to find the flavors. The taste is there but just dial down the bubbles and we could have something truly good."
"O: drink one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer for me is too toned down. I prefer Deschuttes Obsidian Stout with its bigger roasted malt character and deeper flavors. In the end, it’s a well made beer and quite delicious. However, just a good stout."

"A great stout, comparable to a Deschutes Obsidian or SN stout"
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: A very complex stout for its relatively low ABV, with heavy emphasis on the roasted/charred flavors. I only wish it was balanced with a bit more lighter malt character and sweetness. The body seemed a bit thin, although the high carbonation is partially to blame."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown-to-black color with over a finger of tan head. There is mild roast in the nose. Roasted maltiness and bitterness are upfront, but the bitter finish is the most noticeable quality of this offering. Quite flavorful for a single stout."
""
""
"Went to school in Kalamazoo, great beer town..."
"Very light carbonation and thick mouthfeel, smooth. For as dark as it is, it is a ""lighter"" stout."
"Overall - A solid, near exceptional American stout. More sweet than roasty, with great smoothness and a remarkably drinkable body. Has the flavor of an imperial stout, without the punch. As much as I'm enjoying it, it's strangely one of those remarkable beers that I wouldn't miss if I never had it again, mostly due to cost, availability, and the quality of other stouts more readily available to me."
""
"Taste is is ok but with the lack of alcohol the beer missen that something."
""
""
""

""
""
"Kalamazoo Stout is a solid Bell's beer. I'm not a big fan of stouts, but this one's fine and good. It's not super big, roasty, and thick like some other stouts out there (or Imperial Stouts, of course), but that's not a bad thing. Not extremely memorable, but still a good one. Definitely overrated, though, in my opinion."
"O-So far, my favorite Bell's brew. It's the only one that exceeded my expectations. Subtle, but the flavors all make a good presence. The body is thick and chewy but it finishes crisp. Very satisfying brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: A good, light beer!"
"Aroma & Taste: Had a big chocolate and toffee aroma. The beer was heavy and full bodied with a long finish. The chocolate and toffee mashed well over slight molasses and spice undertones. The long finish added to the enjoyment."
"Aromas of coffee and chocolate enticed as a thick, foamy head formed on the thick, dark black beer. The taste is very roasted malty and sweet, with notes of coffee and chocolate. The aftertaste is pleasantly sweet. This stout was so sweet to me that I could see myself drinking this as a digestif/dessert type beer. But the roasty stoutness complements the sweetness well."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am very glad that I finally tried this stout. Admittedly, I initially predicting this beer to suffer from common stout complaints (watery, thin-bodied, etc); however, this is easily one of the best stouts at this price point, and given its easy-drinking and enjoyable qualities, Kalamazoo Stout should never be overlooked."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Teriffic. The nice smoky wood flavor is wonderful up front, and the licorice adds a nice touch. This almost reminds me of Dogfish Head's Chicory Stout, only better and more regularly drinkable. I really enjoyed this one, and will definitely be buying again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Alot of complex flavor without the the big alcohol volume. This beer fills the void in the quest for big stout like flavor that it might be a while before I pick up an Imperial stout again. I might have to try Founders side by side:). Bell's nailed it."

"I'll have this again for further thoughts."
""
""
"Pours about a finger width of head, mocha to tan in color. Smells of coffee, chocolate and licorice. Tastes of espresso, chicory, and licorice with just a bit of smoky peat. Mouthfeel is not very fizzy due to low carbonation, but rather thick and rich. Overall, a nice smoky stout. Can't go wrong with Bell's and this beer is no exception."
""
""
""
" ~ I'm not sure the cellar did much if anything for this brew. That being said, I wouldn't shy away from it either."
""
""
""

"The beer is a deep, dark brown with a half inch of beige head. The aroma offers molasses, dark roast, black coffee. Malty with dark roasted coffee. Rich and slightly sweet, finishing bitter. Molasses with a touch of dark chocolate. Medium bodied with moderately low carbonation. Another solid offering from Bell's."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A tasty stout with a great drinkability and wonderful feel/flavor. A great roasty, but rather balanced stout."
"Overall- thank god the burnt smells I got weren't in the taste. This would make a wonderful session beer for stout lovers. Not the best stout out there but one that is above average for sure. Price is right for the flavor you get. This would be one I get again. 4"
""
""
""
"O: Outstanding single American stout! This beer is very robust and complex for a single 6 ABV stout. It has more depth and flavor than many Imperial Stouts I have had. The licorice is well balanced as is this beer in general. Slam dunk for Bells."

"The color is black with a light brown head. The head didn't last long but, left a foamy ring. The smell is of dark roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, dark fruit and caramel. The taste is of dark fruit, bitter chocolate, and licorice. The mouth feel is thick, chewy, velvet, and has nice carbonation. Very good stout!"
""
"It has a smooth chocolate roast aroma to it. Flavor is wonderful—dark cocoa, dark roast—big, rich, and smooth. Great finish. As enjoyable as I remembered!"

"Poured into a goblet. Dark Brown with a thin beige head. Espresso, burnt sugar, molasses smell. Flavor: Smoke, bitter chocolate, a bit of a metallic after taste. Full bodied, dryer than most stouts but the dryness compliments the taste. Overall: A nice change up. If you are looking for a bit more hops in your stout, this one may be right up your alley."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark giving way to a nice brown head. The smell is strong of coffee some caramel. Taste is roast, toasty with a strong flavor, coffee, chocolate, hint of vanilla. A creamy and thick mouth feel with interesting bitterness. This here is a robust porter"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into snifter with a 1 finger tan head which quickly dissipated leaving slight lacing. Beer is very dark colored. Aroma filled with roasted malts, vanilla and toffee. Great roasted flavor with hints of dark chocolate and coffee. Beer finished bitter with notes of hops and licorice. Medium body, less heavy than I expected based on the appearance. Moderate amount of carbonation, could be slightly creamier. Overall a great beer with lots of flavor. This is the first Bell's that I've had, looking forward to trying more!"
""
""
""
"This a great, quality tasting stout, especially given the good price I picked a bottle up for on a whim. Often it seems stouts can be a little heavy on coffee or chocolatey tastes, but there was none of that noticeable to me in this beer which works to its benefit. Because of its fairly low profile, but all around crisp and relatively mild flavor, it’s definitely something I could drink with some regularity. I will certainly be purchasing it again in greater quantity in the future."
""
""
""
"o-a very good stout, and a shame i cannot get this and other bell's beer in california. i'll continue to buy this when i can."
""
""
""
"Overall: I thought it was pretty good, especially for the price.. I think it was on sale at Meijers for $8.50. I would say its way better then the majority of easy to get bell's beer (excluding hopslam, two hearted, and expedition)."
""
""
""
""
"O- A very good stout. A great combination of sweetness and hop bitterness along with notes of vanilla, chocolate, coffee. Several beers from this brewery do not disappoint. I can't wait to sample some of the other stouts in the lineup."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad. A little on the bland side. An average stout. Worth a try, but nothing all that special."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would say this was a slightly above average stout, it could have been more flavorful but overall not bad."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid stout that is packed with a huge aroma and a huge flavor, especially for being only 6% ABV. The body could stand to be a bit thicker and creamier, but this is still something that is very drinkable and very flavorful, all the way up and down."
""
""
"Commendable brew. I have an expedition waiting in the fridge, expectations from which have increased."
"O: It's what I was expecting, I have been impressed with Bell's, a trend that is likely to continue, it wasn't too pricey either, and it was worth every penny and more. A must have."
"O: Easy drinking, solid stout but something about the licorice and smoke turn me off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle poured into snifter. This one has been chilling in the cellar for a while (10 months) and moved to the fridge a few weeks ago. Pour was a fairly uneventful motor oil with a tiny mocca head a minimal lacing and retention. Smell is of dark malts, burnt chocolate, coffee and some carmel. A decent smelling stout. Taste follows the nose, but I pick up more of the coffee and a slight metallic finish. Some chocolate and licorice come on at the end. It's a pretty bold tasting stout and a bit too much on the burnt end for me. Has a smoky quality as well. Feel is nice and creamy. Not a ton of carbonation and I do like the silk quality on the end. Overall- It's a pretty good stout that was enjoyable. The metallic finish was a bit disappointing and I wanted more of the chocolate and less of the burnt coffee. Better than average, but not one of the best i have had. Would like to try another that is more fresh. Will give this another shot. It's worth the try-"
""
""
""
"This a very good stout, the taste is spot on, I think this is one of the best non imperial stouts."

"Gets better as it warms, but I'd still serve it chilled."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a thick brown with tight, tiny-bubbled head; pitch black in color; faint smoke, a hint of licorice; a lot of roasted and charred burnt taste going on; A nice creamy smooth full body, coffee flavor with the presence of carbonation and alcohol. Finishes bittersweet with a long, lingering char flavor that keeps on coming."

"O- Overall I think this is a great everyday stout, lower abv, good balance, and something I would go for again if I wanted a low abv stout. I will get the higher abv imperial stouts next time though if I am looking for the stout flavor I love."

"Poured dark with a relatively thick, nitro like head giving off little nose. Smells of wood, chocolate, and toasted malts. Tastes of dark chocolate, malt, smoke, oak, coffee. Smooth mouthfeel with medium carb. Overall a ~decent stout but if it wasn't local I wouldn't trade for it."
""
"Kalamazoo Stout pours up a nice black with a minimal tan head and lots of residual delicate lacing left on the glass. Smell is licorice, roasted nuts, coffee, bread, soy sauce, and floral. Mouthfeel is very full erring on the side of less carbonation. Taste is fantastic. Hops at the beginning, sweet in the middle, and hops in the end with a not so disagreeable coffee aftertaste. A magnificent offering from Bells!!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Great stout - the finish takes a little bit away from it overall, but a real pleasure to drink."
"This was a very disappointing beer. I don't know if i just got a bad bottle or something but mine poured nearly completely flat with absolutely no head. I looked at it and there was literally about 3 bubbles floating around on top. One of my favorite parts of stouts is the nice thick head. I got it at a bar and needless to say i was very upset that I had just wasted $6 on such a terrible beer. Luckily I had some amazing beers as well that night that made up for it."
""
""
"O: A very nice stout. Balanced and tasty."

""
""
"The Kalamazoo Stout is a straight ahead traditional stout that reminds of how good a beer can be when the fundamentals are well honed."
""
"Kalamazoo Stout pours solid black, with about two fingers of dark tan foam rising up and filling whatever empty space there was in the glass. Head retention is very good, and there's a decent amount left sticking around the glass. The nose has plenty of coffee, but it's on the sweet side rather than dry, black coffee. That sweetness comes together on my palate as a healthy dose of caramel right up front. Roasted grains come in next, with coffee featuring much more prominently than chocolate. There's a very subtle flourish of licorice in the finish which adds to the beer nicely. The body has some sturdiness, but ideally I'd like it to be just a little bit more full. The carbonation does an admirable job of largely staying out of the way and letting the malt shine. I'm usually a fan of Bell's beers, but the other stout I've had from them (Expedition Stout) wasn't my favorite, so I didn't know what to expect when I opened Kalamazoo Stout. It's an admirable American Stout though, and one I'd welcome in my glass again."
"This one serves well as a standard of well-done licorice aroma and flavor in a dark beer, it had enough to be exciting but not too much so as to be cloying."
""
""
""
"Reviewed from 12 oz. brown bottle poured into pint glass. Bottle marked January 16th, reviewed August 17th."

"O: it's always a treat to get the chance to try a Bell's beer here in California. I've had several varieties, and haven't been let down yet, save for Cherry Stout. They sure know what they are doing in MI. I can see myself buying this on a regular basis. The only other year round un-imperial stout that holds a candle is Deschutte's Obsidian."
"I'd be drinking this on a regular basis if it was available in my part of the world. went down easy even on a hot summer evening"
""
""
""
""
"M- Lighter side of medium, slick feeling."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I really liked this beer. It's one of the best stouts I've ever had from a bottle, almost treading the line between being a porter and a stout. I'll definitely being seeking this one out again, especially in the colder months."
"This beer is pitch black and has a brownish head with decent retention.This beer has a relatively low bitterness. There is a smooth and very creamy feel to the beer and it has an overall great feel to it. This beer is very roasty, but also has some chocolate flavor in it to keep it from being too bland. I quite enjoyed this stout and hold it a notch higher then their double cream stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"A nicely dry, mild stout that doesn't overpower, but stands its ground. Would definitely recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a good stout. All of the usual suspects are here as far as look, smell, and taste with the addition of a little bit of licorice at the finish. The body is a little bit lighter than I was expecting, but the zip from the licorice adds a uniqueness that keeps the mouthfeel at a 4. I kind of expected a little bit more (probably unfairly) just because it’s Bell’s, but this is definitely a good and drinkable beer."

"No glass, so unable to comment on color or head. Scent of coffee and milk chocolate. Excellent taste, likely my favorite of Bells stout's thus far, particularly pleasing aftertaste. Tasted slightly nutty, strong coffee taste, hint of licorice. Lingering coffee aftertaste, less herby than Expedition. A robust and well balanced stout."
"D: If it weren't for the wonderful succession of flavors that I got in the ten seconds following each sip, I would call this beer mediocre. As it is, I call it good, but by no means great."

"Hayward Abbey Rating: 87"
"Pours a wonderfully deep black with some very nice tan head and very good lacing throughout. Nice deep roasted malt scents with a nice bit of earthiness underneath. Wonderfully deep roasted malt flavors, with great chocolate taste and a hint of coffee, along with a nice semi-citrus and semi-earthy hoppiness at the end. Very rich, creamy, smooth, and thick."

"Overall it's surely a favorite and worth putting in the six pack rotation of stouts."

"Unique, intensely flavored, yet with a very manageable ABV. A great stout with a pleasant black licorice twist (without the added sweetness of molasses)."

"Overall, a slightly better than average stout. Too bad i don't see it around here often."

"O-Similar to their Porter, a solid stout, nothing makes it stand out among the crowd though."
"Very fine beer. I want to drink this before sex in the snow, but after a fine conaque. Larry, well done (again)."
""
""
"O: Pretty good stuff. Licorice didn't really translate into the taste, but whatever, I'm fine with that. This is a tasty beer, and very quaffable. It sits very lightly in the stomach. A nice, sessionable beer."
""
"O: Pretty nice stout. The licorice is a little too dominant and some other strong flavors to balance it would be nice. Otherwise quite good."

"Finger and a half billowing medium brown head, fairly slow dissipating with clinging solid lacing, over dark brown oapque body, really dark. Nose features complex amalgam of roast, some citrus, mild licorice, faint cocoa nib, a bit of grassiness, the aroma changed significantly once the beer warmed, chocolate notes became more assertive. Taste is more sweet than bitter, fruity up front, some roast not a lot of coffee (compared to Java Stout) in the middle, licorice towards the back-end mild resin bitterness in the back. As the beer warmed the chocolate became more prevalent. Mouthfeel pretty close to medium not heavy, good effervescence. A pretty filling beer for the ABV, on the heavy side a bit, pretty complex for style."
"O- Hard to believe that the same brewer that makes Expedition, makes this watered down, flat stout. I guess I can tick this off the list and never be wanting one again."
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty nice stout with lovely notes of licorice in it. There is an enjoyable flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel. Not exactly a sessionable beer but it is pretty easy to drink and you could probably enjoy a couple in an evening."
""
""
"Overall: This is a great stout. I normally dislike black licorice notes in dark beers, but this is enjoyable! Good stout made by Bells!"
""
""
""
"Overall - For a stout, it has alot going for it. It's got rich flavors, a great smell and a balanced mouthfeel. This is hands down one of the best stouts I've ever had and it's absolutely worth checking out!"
""
""
"This is a very good stout. It has very clean flavor, and the aftertaste is really good. I wish I could get this in New Jersey. I would like to age a few bottles to try over time. Maybe I could find this in Pennsylvania."
""
""
""
""
""
"First off, I must say those guys over there at Bell's continue to put out a quality product. This beer is very good. UPon pouring you will notice the rich, dark chocolate color and how smoothly it pours with the right amount of head and lace. The aroma is of creamy malts and a hint of chocolate. The taste is extraordinary. Very few beers go down this smooth! THis is a great stout, leaves no aftertaste, just smooth refreshing stout at its finest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy drinker and an excellent stout. Well worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The licorice never really crossed my palate or was identified. I thought the smell was unmatched for a simple American stout but lacked depth in taste. Still very much enjoyed. I blame some of the quality on the store which I purchased this single beer from (world market) where this beer was stored warm for multiple months. I can easily get a six pack fresh which I will do and re-review."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – This is an excellent example of a solid stout, another good offering from Bell’s. I have been disappointed with my last few reviews so it is nice to review an impressive beer which exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend this brew, sessionable, easy to drink a bunch of them. Man this was good. I will get more."
"Overall, a very nice stout. Bell's seems to do no wrong and I only wish that I could buy their beers in Ontario."
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with modest carbonation. Mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth, accentuated by the body and carbonation. Quite pleasant to sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The palate opens with a wonderful blend of licorice, dark chocolate and an aggressive yet restrained roast. Fruity mid-palate with some dried figs, along with an excellent creaminess. Dries up on the finish with a rather exceptional balance of roast, licorice, dark chocolate and just enough sweetness to balance them all out, this is really nice. Medium-light in body with moderate but creamy carbonation, this feels really really good on the palate. Among the best stouts there is, highly recommended."
""
""
""
"o: very drinkable, but also pretty standard for the style. ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It’s not outstanding in any way, but taken on its own merits it is a very drinkable Stout and easily a session Ale."
""
""
"Overall- Not the best stout in Bell's line-up. Coming in at only 6%, its a welcomed change from all the heavy hitters I've had lately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely a great stout. It's not perfect, but it genuinely makes me wish I didn't have to drive to Virginia to get it (then again, it's worth going a state over to pick it up...)"
""
"This is an enjoyable stout, but not one I would go out of my way to have again. I would recommend it if you see it offered somewhere where you're shopping, or if you are a big fan of licorice as an additive."
""
""
""
"Pours black with small off white head. Nose is heavy on chocolate with some beautiful roasty, earthy, spicy coffee in the background. Taste is full bodied with the big coffee and mocha standing out prominently, earthy, light coffee spice, roast, WOW. Not too sweet or syrupy, medium carbonation. What an excellent stout! This is probably the best non-imperial, non-sweet/milk stout out there. And you can drink it all day."

""
""
""
""

"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of full bodied, with moderate carbonation. The beer finishes dry. Overall, this is a great stout, even if I would only have one per sitting."
"O-this is pretty good. nothing special, but great stout for a pretty good price. could benefit from a bit more of a chocolate flavor. but very good still."
"O: Overall, quite good, again, somewhat different than the usual stout, but still quite good in its own respects."
""
""
""
""

"The taste is robust. A balanced bit of hop bitterness is definitely there, while the dark malt leaves an amazing roasty, bourbon-esque flavor in your mouth long after you swallow. The mouthfeel is chewy and only ever so slightly carbonated. I don't know how they pulled this off while keeping it at 6% ABV. I'm impressed. A good sipper."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a really dark black with a medium tan head. Smell of roasted coffee and chocolate. Taste is the same as the smell; roasted coffee and chocolate. Great beer and on a winter day. Also a very good beer to pair with dessert. Highly enjoyable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not really my type of stout. It was overwhelmingly dry and bitter and just lacked much flavor with the licorice barely being noticeable."
""
""
""
"*One last note - the ""brewers licorice"" comment on the label made me shy away from this at first, do not let this deter you if you don't like licorice. This is NOT a ""licorice beer"". The licorice is simply a component of a complex symphony, one that is worthy of tasting."
""
""
"O - The flavors and smell are right on, although a tad more liqorice would be nice, but to me a more substantial mouthfeel would make this a much more enjoyable beer. Maybe more carbonation or simply a bit thicker/oily/whatever."
""
""
""
""
"Easy drinking, smooth taste. I remember my first time drinking it after a night out, that it tasted like pure chocolate. Of course, in more of a sober state it doesn't taste exactly like chocolate, but it is pretty close."
""
""
"Pretty good non-Imperial stout."
"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled 9/14/2011. Pours pitch black color, with a nice 2 finger fairly dense tan head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent lacing clinging to the glass. Aromas of big milk chocolate, caramel, coffee, roasted malt, light herbal hops, and a hint of licorice. Nice well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, coffee, caramel, roasted malt, pine, herbal hops, and a bit of spiciness. Good amount of bitterness on the finish with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, pine, and herbal spiciness for a bit. Very robust flavors for 6%, with great balance. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Hardly any alcohol presence except for a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent and highly robust stout. Very drinkable with great flavor balance."
"Overall this is a really tasty, well put together stout."

"O: Overall I'd say that the appearance and some of the uniqueness in flavor of the beer's taste balance out the shortcomings of body and ""traditional' stout flavor. It's a beer that makes you want to take a second sip after the first because you can't really figure out what flavors your taste-buds are pointing you towards. I didn't get a lot of coffee, caramel, chocolate, etc from the beer and I thought it was actually quite thin. It's a tossup."
""
""
"The body isn't overly robust, albeit extremely easy to drink. The carbonation is gentle, and the fluffy mouthfeel has a slippery character to it. It finishes pretty dry, aiding to it's effortless quaffability."
"I wasn't particularly looking forward to this beer because I feared a licorice bomb. I was pleasantly surprised that this is just one small aspect of a very big flavor. I approve."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A black body with about an inch of foamy, frothy, light khaki head. Nice gobs of lacing. Aroma is of roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, hints of vanilla, and cane sugar. It tastes rather sweet up front, with sugar, chocolate, vanilla, and some faint hops. Finishes with roasted malt and coffee grounds. Mouthfeel is rich, thick, and finishes a bit syrupy. Overall, a good American stout."

"Mouthfeel is thin and light with a light body, an almost watery overall feel, and a tasty bitterness that makes this a sessionable stout for me. Very smooth, full of flavor and easy to drink. This is a great, light stout that I could drink all night or pair with food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel has a medium to high amount of carbonation and a body in the range of moderate to full. Finishes dry with an aftertaste of dark, bitter roasted coffee. Overall a solid stout. On a side note, Bells says this has licorice in it, but I couldn't detect any."
""
""
""
"Pours black and opaque, impenetrable to light. Cocoa brown coloured head of a finger or two, with light retention and some pretty good lace. Nose has some cocoa, licorice and a general sweetness, with a bit of roast. Taste has baker's chocolate, a bit of sugary dark fruits, licorice is more subtle and big kick of roastiness at the end. Good sweetness complements the roasty bitterness and balances it nicely. Pretty fullbodied, with a fairly low carbonation. An excellent stout, I wish I could stock this regularly."

""
""

""
""
"Pours a nice deep black with a great tan head. Great deep aroma with a bit of chocolate and a slight hint of licorice. Fantastic tasting beer. Really deep complex flavor that has just enough licorice for you to taste but not to overpower the whole beer. Finishes strong and stays with you. Excellent beer."
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light-medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Drinks fairly smoothly. Overall a pretty decent stout, but not outstanding. Like a lot of stouts out there, doesn't do much to really differentiate itself and grab my attention."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks so much to Marc for sending me this in an epic Michigan beer box! This was a great stout with big coffee and chocolate notes. It had a medium mouth-feel and is perfect as a session stout. I could drink this all night and never get old of it. It is also surprisingly refreshing. Great brew! Thanks again Marc!"

""

"I was lukewarm on this beer at first but I find myself liking it more with each sip. It's flavorful and balanced. I wouldn't mind it if they cranked up the licorice, though!"
""
""
""
"Pours straight black with one finger of dark brown head. Lots of nice roasty, chocolatey notes on the nose. It also has an underlying complexity that I am interpreting as the licorice that the label says is in there. Just a touch boozy, estery on the nose. Taste is more of the same, really full bodied roasted stout. Good complexity but also very easy drinking. Overall a really nice brew, just wish they distributed to my area."

"Overall an absolutely fantastic stout. Big fan of Bells and most of their brews and this one does not disappoint."

"This beer is extremely well executed and very drinkable. After having their sweet and luxurious Double Cream Stout, this one is kind of like that, but with a hefty dose of hops to halt the sweet malts in their place. It is really a toss up between them, and you can't go wrong with either."

"Pours an inky black with a brown head, which clings nicely to the glass. The aroma is slightly crisp and medicinal. I believe this is due to the licorice mentioned on the bottle. The taste consists mostly of roasted barley, toasted bread, and a hint of caramel. This beer coats the mouth very well - it is solidly thick. Not as dry as some stouts either. Well done Bell's!"

"O: This beer is great. Not the best of the style. In my opinion Deschutes Obsidian is more the American Stout for me but this certainly has it's place too. I love the rich roastiness. I've been having so many imperial stouts lately I drink it expecting it to be 10% so it's nice that's it's not and a little more laid back."

""

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - ""Good"" is the best adjective to describe this beer in my opinion. It is good, but doesn't really have any qualities that really set me off or make me really think hard about the flavors. It is a solid beer, but not one that I will be thinking about for too long."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I must say, the apprehensive nature of this beer is impressive. Here you could have an extreme beer with a 9% ABV, loads of carbonation and a bunch of licorice dumped into it. Instead, it's a humble 6%, as much carbonation as is needed and doesn't have an overabundance of licorice, so you can actually drink more than one without being weighed down by unnecessary alcohol and intense flavors. Yet again, I say Bell's is the shiznit."

"This is a good stout staple. Embodies what I think of as a regular non-imperial stout. If I wanted to introduce someone to the style, I might use this one."
"O- One of my favorite stouts and one of my favorite beers from Bell's. There cherry stout still reigns supreme of this but it is decent."
"This is a solid stout. It's fairly simple and to the point, but the simplicity works here. I've had this one several times and will probably have it again."
"Overall, it's a brew like this that makes Oatmeal Stouts and stouts overall among my favorite styles. I will get this again, and soon."
"This was certainly a surprise as I tend to dislike anything brewed with anise/licorice. The good part is that it's not overpowering by any means, and really works as an addition to the base flavors. Again, put it on the label? I don't think so, unless you just want to say you're doing something different."
"I think that this has a lot going for a nice stout. Very drinkable and a great session-able brew for a stout. The smell is of chocolate and slight coffee and nice roasted malt. This is a bit slick on the tongue and didn't quite have the body that i would have liked. Light tan head with a bit of carbonation that seemed to be a nice tickle on the way down. I think that for me this just needed a bit more body to it and maybe a bit more alcohol to back it up. I do understand that this is not an RIS but i guess im spoiled. For an everyday stout this is great but i was expecting a little more with the great rating this has been given."
"Medium bodied with low carbonation. A little syrupy, but not overly so. Very drinkable and good! I get this once in awhile and I always enjoy it."
"Kalamazoo stout pours with a deep black color with a nice tan head which quickly dissipates to a thin lacing on top of the beer. Aroma is very good. Lots of coco, roast, can get a touch of earthyness, and a very mild caramel note. The flavor is nice, but falls a bit short. The creamy chocolatey character that the aroma had gives way to more of a patent malt burnt roastyness with a bit of an earthy chalky coco flavor which is nice, but not as great as the aroma. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. Not much creaminess, a bit sharp with a good level of carbonation for a stout. For me this is closer to a dry stout than a regular stout, but it is damn good anyway."
"O: Unique. A good, tasty stout...with the combination of sweetness, roast and dryness I probably wouldn't want more than one though."
"Overall: This is definitely one of the more enjoyable stouts I have had in this ABV range. I would definitely have a few of these while I sat at a pub."
"Drink- I like the use of the licorice in this bottle the format works well as I don't think I could do a whole bomber or 750 of this stout."
"I'm glad I tried this, though it would not be my first choice for a stout, it is interesting and good."
"Cheers..."
"Overall I would try this stout again. Good stuff from Bell's."
"Overall: A great stout for somebody who doesn't want to be overwhelmed by the 'big' that is so common of this style yet keep from compromising the flavor. Easily understood as a 'cult classic'. Ty Bell's!"
"Way back when this was my first stout that wasn't a Guinness. Still one of my favorites."
"overall: really the first beer that got me into craft beer. just an overall great beer."
"A decent, well-flavoured, dessert-adjacent Yankee stout. The extra point of ABV well-obfuscated, the licorice not overplayed - what's not to like?"
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, roasty and a small, sweet licorice presence. In the taste, a small roast, sweet coffee, and notes of licorice. A small bite, yet mainly smooth and a medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a dry and roasty coffee and licorice in the aftertaste. Nice sweet to dry coffee and notes of licorice."
"o: Just okay, not something I would revisit."
"OA: Its okay, more regular stout than licorice. I liked the Stone Belgo Anise IRS better, just had the stronger anise."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1/2 foamy khaki head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing on this one on the drink down. Smell is of uncooked bread dough, slight chocolate, and oddly enough a bit like playdough. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and some mild coffee bean flavors. I am not getting licorice in either the smell or taste. A mild roasty bitterness quickly fades from the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a nice bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good stout but nothing that great in the long run. I enjoy the way this beer smells more than the way it tastes."
"O- not a bad take on a stout. the licorice at the end is kinda different but that isn't always a bad thing. I enjoyed this but it didn't wow me."
"Overall: A very solid stout that is very full flavored and heavy for a non imperial stout."
"An impressive everyday stout that mixes in some flavors other than straight coffee. Really liked the licorice scent."
"O: Really solid, licorice is a differentiator. Flavors could be a little more bold."
"Overall: An excellent stout in all regards. Very hard to beat."
"Kalamazoo Stout is an amazing American Stout."
"Great stout. I've had this on tap and in bottles. Pours opaque black with a cream beige head. Aroma of roasted malts, milk chocolate, and licorice. Taste of dark roasted malts with coffee notes, sweet chocolate, caramel, and light sensations of dark fruits and licorice. Full-bodied, smooth and rich, and nicely drinkable."
"Overall, too bitter. Not necessarily in a hoppy way, but more of a burnt manner. Mouthfeel is too oily. Not overwhelmingly impressed."
"A delicious stout. Thanks again!"
"O- Reminds me a lot of Edmund Fitzgerald, but with the chocolate notes being at the forefront of this one rather than the roasted coffee being at the forefront of the Edmund Fitzgerald. Good balance of sweet, roasty, and bitter though and very drinkable."
"This has always been a beer I have avoided because I really don't like anise. I think time may have faded it a bit to a ""not that bad"" beer."
"I couldn’t get behind this as much as the other three Bell’s I had (Pale Ale, Two Hearted, Amber Ale), but that won’t stop me from trying more Bell’s."
"well money has been tight so i haven't had the luxury to buy some good beer but i decided to splurge for something new. Beer pours darker than almost any other beer i can think of, its as dark as celebrator easily. It may be the darkest beer i've ever had. Smells of toffee and sweet roasted malt, with maybe some chocolate in there. Taste is fantastic as one would expect from bells, the alcohol is barely noticeable and the chocolate smell is much more pronounced in the mouth. It really is a good beer, and i'm going to savor this 6 pack."
"O-this is a good resonably priced stout"
"This may be my favorite stout I have had all year."
"O: A pretty good stout. Nothing mind-blowing and doesn't really deliver on the licorice flavor, but definitely a solid beer. I enjoyed the mouthfeel on this one a lot...very thick and very drinkable...a good session beer, although maybe just a tad high at 6%..."
"Enjoy!"
"O: I like this beer, but the appearance and nose totally deceived me. That being said, it's still a good beer that I'd like to try again."
"O - A very good stout. Another well done beer from Bells"
"Not sure what to make of Bell's stout offerings - one of the hallmarks of a great brewery is a superlative stout, and having had Expedition, Kalamazoo, and Java, all come well short of that distinction. Yet everything else I've had from Bell's is invariably great. I guess stouts just aren't their sweet spot."
"Overall – Bell's is quickly becoming my favourite brewer. I've yet to be disappointed with any of their beers. The mouthfeel with this beer was amazing and it has a fantastic appearance in the glass. The taste was great and it was very easy to drink. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."
"O - I love this stout. It's not my favorite, and not my go-to, but it is still fantastic. The flavors meld perfectly."
"Overall, a good, well rounded, drinkable stout. Not overly complex and I enjoy the licorice."
"O - Solid but simple. I'd buy it again."
"overal this is a very good stout"
"Smooth, yet still big and chewy, it's a mouthful. Very complex with bitter chocolate, hints of charred wood, and those anise notes. Maybe even some grape in there, too. It all leads to a dry, chalky, woody, lingering finish."
"Pretty excited when a customer dropped this off at the store for us to try. The beer pours black with brown around the edges with an espresso head. Smells big and roasty. The taste has got a lot going on, big ashy charred flavors, roasted coffee bitter chocolate, touch of licorice. I'm not a licorice fan but I like the stout, not something to avoid, even if you don't like licorice. This is a wonderful, full-bodied stout that I'm honored to try outside of distribution. Bell's, come to NY!"
"Had this one at the Fountainhead. Pours pitch black and smells of roasted malts and licorice. The taste is extremely roasty, but there is an astringent side that really balances this brew. I was disappointed that they did not have the Expedition Stout, so I tried this one instead. It ended up working out for me."
"Overall. Great stout. Everything a stout should be. Easy drinking, but very satisfying"
"Overall, this beer was great despite my low expectations due to the addition of licorice. I will seek this out in the future."
"O-a very decent stout, though i'm noticing that the flavors start to diminish the more i drink...making it not something i'd want to drink all night long. its still a great stout, that i would absolutely recommend for any who likes stouts, or even those that aren't big fans."
"My first beer I had mixed feelings on it. The licorice was commanding to me. As it warmed it was less prominent. A solid beer from Bell's."
"O - Tons of roasty goodness, great representation of the style. I was worried about this being overly licorice-y, but the licorice gives a nice light note. It could be a little more full bodied."
"O Disappointed with this beer. Was looking forward to it but I will definitely not be seeking this out again."
"Medium to full bodied with excessive carbonation, this beer has great drinkability for a stout. The body is just a little sticky and coating, which is just right for the flavors and the style. On the other hand, the carbonation is so powerful it truly detracts from the beer. While it does help to make this beer more drinkable, it is so strong and fizzy that it covers the flavors when the beer is held in the mouth."
"O: Very nice stout which, while not medium or heavy bodied and super creamy is still creamy enough and thick enough that it's not a porter and coupled with the licorice, really add another layer of character to the beer. Worth trying and drinking more of."
"O- A good beer but the smell was really the only thing I found memorable about this one."
"Overall a pretty straightforward but decent stout."
"D – Another good brew from Bell’s. Pretty enjoyable. I would get this brew again and recommend it"
"I suppose I was expecting more pronounced licorice or molasses flavor given the description of this one, but I think Bell's did a nice job in producing a stout that's well-balanced and engaging. I can come back to this one again and again."
"Overall: Very drinkable. On the sweet side for the style, barely any bitter."
"O: Pretty good stout. More complex than some of the other non-Imperial stouts I've had. Maybe went a tad overboard but big kudos for doing something slightly different."
"D: i do like the licorice, it gives the beers aroma something unique when compared to other american stouts. however, i found the palate, mouthfeel, etc to be sort of american stout redundant. not a bad brew, but not as blown away as the masses."
"Pours a black as he'll color with no head. Smells like a rich milk chocolate and roast roast roastiness. Tastes the same with rich chocolate flavor and coffee hints. Feel is super smooth and moderate to thick with the slightest carbonation. Creaminess and roastiness. Come on bells. Just fucking distribute to western ny already."
"This is really a pretty unique stout, but the licorice flavors, while interesting, don't really do it for me. But I love the smoothness Bell's gives to their stouts, and this I can drink this one easily. I liked the Oatmeal Stout at the Eccentric Cafe much more than this, though."
"Overall: Another solid beer from Bell's. Decidedly drinkable with a wealth of flavor and aroma to keep things interesting. Everyone who can get his all the time, I'm jealous."
"(revisited and tweaked with a 2012 bottle in Nov. 2013 - paired with a Green Flash Double Stout which proved to have more flavor but otherwise was quite similar.}"
"Mouthfeel is surprising. This beer is as rich and filling as a Double Stout at 10-12% abv. but without the paralyzing kick. Overall this is a good solid stout that will please the RIS/Imperial Stout lovers with the flavor and mouthfeel as well as the ""pint man"" that could quaff a few."
"o - nice semi-sessionable and accessable stout."
"Jeez, Louise, it looked like spent motor oil coming out of the bottle and into my glass! I briefly had a finger of deep-tan head before it disappeared. Color was solid black with zero light penetration. Nose was very smoky and charcoal-ish underlain by a dark chocolate scent. Mouthfeel was fairly full and the roasted bitterness had really come to the forefront with coffee initially and chocolate following. Finish was more like chocolate fudge than anything, rendering it a dessert beer. It held up extremely well."
"O- This is an interesting beer, not the best from bells, definitely would not buy again."
"O-a solid stout with nice flavor and balance"
"This beer poured out as a deep black color, the head was thick and tan colored. The smell of the beer is roasted and has a light chocolate aroma in there too. The taste of the beer had heavy roasted malts, and hints of chocolate too. The mouthfeel of the beer wasn't as thick as I was hoping for. Overall this beer isn't too bad. I would gladly drink it again, I just feel there are better stouts out there."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Totally black in color. Poured with a rich beige foam that slowly reduced to a nice cap that leaves a few sticky lacings on the glass. Roasted and chocolate malt aromas. Smells creamy too. Thick and resinous feel in the beginning, and creamy smooth toward the finish with rich carbonation. Dark roasted and chocolate flavor up front with dark malt flavors transitioning to a lightly burnt malt flavor into the middle. Hop bitterness then comes alive with pleasant herbal pine character that intensifies from the middle to the end. Dark maltiness also carries through to the end along with hints of black coffee and a dry finish. Leaves you with a light herbal pine bitterness that lingers for a while."
"O: Not the best showing from Bells, but I'd say licorice is a hard flavor to balance in a single style stout. There's no real bite to any of the flavors, and that's something that really bothers me. As someone that is really quite the flavor fiend, I can't help but feel frustrated by a strong flavor ingredient being subdued by the nature of the body feel and complimentary flavors. I just don't understand why they'd bother with licorice if it ends up being so dissonant in such a light bodied stout. Perhaps this used to be a classic, or even one of the breweries first beers; but it really feels like a novelty. Just because an ingredient should work on paper, doesn't mean it works in execution. Go big and imperial with your licorice, or risk being a dissonant and imbalanced single stout."
"O: Glad I tried this and very happy to try some bells things, but this was pretty mediocre. Volume definitely needs to be turned up on the flavors and their development. If the same flavors were amped, this would be an easy B or B+. As it is, hard to really recommend this beer unless you like your stouts unusually light and fleeting."
"For me there is something wrong here. The alcohol note is slightly acetone like and fusel-y. Further, the malt character doesn't have the chocolately, coffee, roasty note expected of the style."
"A nice stout, I would buy this one again."
"O: This is a decent brew, definitely worth a try."
"Black color, very little head or lacing. Roasty aromas that continue in the mouth, with bitter hops, coffee and bittersweet chocolate flavors also present. Medium mouthfeel, not too thick or carbonated. Modest ABV allows for decent drinkability. Yummy and typical of the style. No surprises here, just delivers the goods. A very nice stout indeed. Not too big or over the top. Gotta find myself a bottle of their Imperial Stout next!"
"From the wide variation in reviews here on BA, it seems that this brew is very sensitive to age and whether it's in a bottle vs. on tap."
"I found myself literally saying ""mmm"" without thinking after every few sips. I don't believe I've ever done that before. It was very hard to put down. I know I'll have to get my hands on some more of this. Luckily, one of my local places does get Bell's in."
"Overall a solid stout that if they had six packs around me of I would buy as an every day stout."
"Overall: A nice stout worth drinking at least once."
"Overall, this is an excellent stout. The roasty bitterness blends well with the slight sweetness to create good balance."
"O: This is a great year round stout to scratch an itch for the darker beers. Just solid simple brewing in this beer. One of the best in the $9-$11 sixer range for me."
"O: Well, this has a definite following amongst Bell’s lovers, stout lovers, and just plain ol’ beer lovers; now I see that it’s for good reason. I only wished that this beer had a bigger presence: more ABV, thicker body, bigger roasts, etc. Other than that, though, it has earned its place in my heart and mind as a Bell’s classic. Thanks again, guys! I’ll be sure to think twice next time I’m tempted to just walk by your other offerings."
"MF- Almost full bodied, but creamy and smooth."
"O: Definitly a drinker over and over again, good till there aint no more."
"Sort of a thick pour, like used motor oil into my glass, resulting in a two finger head of moderately dense foam of light brown color. Lace is somewhat clingy. Color is a 30 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is intriguing, with aromas of licorice, currant, honey, coffee, coco, and lemon peel. The taste, well was not quite a full and robust as I thought it would be, lots of flavor, but not so intense to knock my shoes off. There are flavors of coffee, coco, anise, molasses, charred oak, celery, grapefruit/lemon/pine, and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and has some pop from the carbonation. A bit of drying/stickiness on the sides of my tongue and back of my soft palate. Yes I would like to drink some more of this brew, but I got the last bottle and being at the end of the supply chain, I can only dream."
"Dark in color with 2 fingers worth of tan head. Laced through out with a good amount of carbonation. Not much of a nose here. Flavor is robust. Lots of burnt malts and strong coffee. Heavier part of medium thickness in mouthfeel. Would definitely not be on the top of the stout style IMO."
"O: A very tasty brew. I would get it again it it was distributed to my state."
"O: A very tasty stout. 4"
"Overall: A nice stout but i found it lacked a bit of oomph. Well made though and worth a look."
"A very solid American stout. Lacks the bright hop flavors and aromatics of some American stouts, but has the characteristically big flavors and big roast. This beer would pair fantastically with a number of desserts."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an inky black color with a 1/2 inch head, considerable lacing throughout. Smell is of roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is the same, chocolate and roasted malts, very little in the way of licorice. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a very enjoyable beer."
"Light mouthfeel, but not unexpected for the moderate abv. Overall, very drinkable and an excellent stout."
"Beer pours a thick black with tan creamy head. Decent retention and nice lacing. Roasted aromas of coffee and cocoa, some char and maybe leather. Flavor is roasted coffee and some sort of dark fruitiness. A really nice stout that I will definitely come back to."
"A decent brew. Very roasty and a bit one dimensional. There is too much out there that I enjoy more for me to go back to this one again."
"O - Overall a good to average beer. A little one dimensional, but enjoyable. Not sure I'll rush back to it any time soon."
"O - I know why I used to love this stuff. I do not know why I haven't got back with this sooner. Now, some controversy: though different styles (and intents), Kalamazoo is a WAYYY better beer than Expedition. Yes I've had fresh Expedition. Yes I've had (x)-year-old Expedition. Kalamazoo FTW."
"D - Mild carbonation. not as sweet as many stouts. Nice."
"O - I strongly dislike licorice, so I was a little hesitant picking this up but I'm happy to report I'm not picking up any licorice at all. The bottle says this is brewed with ""brewers licorice"" - I'm not entirely sure if brewers licorice has a completely different flavor profile than your standard old school licorice, either way, I'm really enjoying this. The flavors are bold and straightforward, not any complexity, but this is exactly what I'm looking for right now. A great stout for a cold winter night, or in my case, a humid thursday night."
"Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Poured almost black with a huge light brown rocky head that lasted throughout and had excellent lacing. The aroma was of burnt cereal malts, a leathery yeast with notes of molasses, chocolate and coffee. It tasted mildly bitter and acidic in the beginning and finished with a sweet/bitter coffee flavor that stayed with you for an average length of time. Mouthfeel was full in body and creamy in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall a pretty basic stout."
"Overall/notes - Frankly, this beer does all of the important things right. ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" has never been truer. Maybe the dark chocolate helped it taste better than it really was, but... no. No, I just liked the beer. Another strong one from Bell's."
"I have had my eye on this stout for a while and I picked up a single recently during my last trip to Save On. I poured the 12oz glass into a snifter glass to find a deep black body with a tan, one inch head that left no lacing around my glass. The aroma was great with hints of dried fruits, roasted malts, coffee and hints of chocolate. The taste was great, the chocolate and coffee flavors are there like you would expect but they way the licorice is worked into the flavor its great. The beer is a bit on the heavy and chewy side but mellows out nicely and is enjoyable to drink. The carbonation and creaminess of the beer and very well balanced. Overall this beer met my expectations and I really enjoyed it and will defiantly pick this one up again!"
"O - A nice wellcrafted stout by Bells. They seem to make nothing but good beers. Very glad I got to try this. Very easy drinking a good beginner stout."
"Was a little skeptical about the licorice, but I really enjoyed this brew. Poured black with a small carmel head. Roasts on the nose, but not as strong as I like. Nice balance between creamy and carbonation, very nice. Chocolate and malt, although not as much malt as I was expecting, and I expected more licorice but I'm ok with the subtlety. Finish lingers of roasts and coffee. Very nicely balanced. I'd prefer a little more umph from it as far as ABV, I think that would add to the overall, but all in all very nice beer."
"The taste is a beautiful thing with a dry chocolate and roast mix thats very full bodied and smooth. Some faint licorice notes but mostly it has an almost RIS level of roast and burnt qualities that I really like. Easy drinking and tasty stout."
"O: This is a solid refreshing stout. The flavors were solid roasted malt and dark notes. Nothing too adventurous. Delicious brew. Didn't blow my mind but very good and will certainly drink it in the future."
"O: So far, my second favorite stout. Excellently crafted. Obsidian still holds the top for me, but this would be a great substitute."
"O/D - I would call this a good session stout. Not too heavy and the flavor is a good balance of sweet, bitter and trace smoke. I will be picking this up again."
"Overall / Drinkability: Hmmm....I think this would be good with steak, but by itself it's a nice beer to sip, savor, and finish the evening with. But just one is enough per evening. It's very intense in flavor which is good, but by the end, I'm pleasantly sated. I think this would also be a good beer to pair with desert, especially something chocolate."
"The mouthfeel is a little weak, this feels way too carbonated. I'd like something a bit smoother for sure, maybe a bit more thickness too. Let it sit for a while to let the carbonation mellow and it becomes more enjoyable. The drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a great unique stout that I highly recommend."
"O - A less bold stout, a nice starter to your stout night."
"Overall - its a good but not great beer. I probably wont think to have to have this beer again."
"O – Roaster than I typically like in the style, and I feel like the smoke note is a little unbalanced, but not a bad beer."
"O- This is a good stout but not what I was expecting. A little more hop bitterness than a normal stout. I enjoyed the feel of it and the hints of coffee and chocolate."
"Full-bodied and very smooth. It has even more of those dark roasted malt flavors than the aroma would suggest. Initially it delivers black currant, and roasted malt, but it quickly transitions to charcoal, licorice and burnt malt. The finish is a balanced mix of burnt and roasted malt with a bitter hop finish. Overall this beer is a great experience."
"Poured into Ikea beer mug. Black-brown opaque with a very thin cocoa brown head. Very faint smell of a frothy mix of coffee and chocolate. Tastes of malt right off the get go all the way to through the middle, and finishes with a delicious hint of coffee and chocolate. Feels smooth and creamy on the tongue; enjoyable to drink."
"Drinks pretty well. A good offering from bell's."
"O: Quite happy with this beer. Glad that the coffee doesn't overwhelm the beer since I am not a fan of coffee beers. Not my favorite stout, but I wouldn't turn it away."
"D-Overall this a a great stout.Lots of good flavors come out, very drinkable. Great smell and taste. Goes down soo smooth. Love this stout"
"O- I thought I wasn't going to like this with the black licorice and all but it's not as dominant as I thought it'd be. The mouth could be thicker, but this is drinkable. Curious to try other stout offerings from Bells, and their brews in general."
"Overall solid good light stout, very nice and enjoyable easy drinking, good flavor and feel."
"Draft. Served on cask at Town Hall Tap. Poured into a nice nonic glass a dark brown color with a mocha tan head. Cask causes it to cascade like a nitro beer. Heavy roasted nose along with dark chocolate and slight leather. The head is intense and sticks around for quite a while. Medium mouthfeel, a tad light than expected. Very smooth flavors. Dark roast coffee notes upfront with some vanilla and chocolate flavors as well. Slight bitterness in the end."
"Solid beer, the liquorice definitely comes through. If you don't like black liquorice, you probably won't like this beer."
"Overall - All in all a very solid stout, good carbonation, great smells, and a great taste that lingers, a definite go to for me as far as stouts/porters go."
"Pours a deep black with a decent tan coloured fizzy head with little retention. Nose has plenty of roasted malts, giving way to burnt coffee, dark chocolate and black licorice. Taste is similiar to the smell; theres the dark brewers licorice flavour with toasty cocoa notes. Full bodied mouthfeel, well rounded with a creamy mouthfeel and a bitter dry finish. A decent stout with a unique overall taste of licorice. Well priced and another quality beer from Bell's lineup."
"O - Overall a pretty good stout. Rises above average by being more complex than a lot of its competitors. A great year round beer."
"Overall, a cool new addition to an old style. One of the few times I've seen a cool twist on a stout."
"Overall-A very enjoybale drinking experience! This stout is lively and flavorfull and dances on your palate. I am not a huge stout fan, but this is one of the better examples out there and definitely a 2-3 pinter!"
"D: Overall, this is a good stout, not great but pretty good. For me the charred/smokey flavor was kind of overpowering, it wasn't bad but could have been a little less of a punch to the palate."
"O - A pretty good beer, one of my favorite Bell's beers, and worth having again."
"Overall-Two Hearted, Oberon, and now this. Bells makes very nice sessionable beers for people with different tastes. Please distribute to Texas."
"Overall this is a decent but slightly unbalanced stout. At 6% ABV this is quite sessionable but not overly flavorful enough that I need to revisit. Worth a go but not necessary to sample."
"O: Really nice easy drinking stout. You could definitely have a couple of these."
"O - Very nice beer. Easy drinker with a bundle of flavor. I still don't get the chocolate that everyone else is talking about, or the brewer's licorice."
"this is the ideal american stout, without adding anything to it they did everything just right for the style. IMO, not enough breweries make this simple, tasty, yet overlooked style. i could drink this anytime of year and i would definatly recommend it. a nice session beer."
"Good stout, first stout I've had from Bell's looking forward to trying more."
"Bell's makes another great beer in this Kalamazoo Stout. One thing great about Bell's is that they are not a one trick pony but put time and effort into all their beers to be one of the best hand crafted breweries. This stout pours jet black into my pint glass with a little creamy head. Chocolate and sweet smell either hops or alcohol is very pleasant. Hoppy chocolate taste to a bitter hazelnut coffee flavor. You can feels the hops on tongue and is an easy drinker. Love this Michigan beer."
"Quite enjoyable. Another great brew from Bell's, which I love is in my hometown!"
"Overall not a great beer, but a very good one. I have to say I love expedition aged, but fresh this just does it for me."
"I'd buy again."
"D: A very solid stout and one that I could see myself enjoying regularly if it were available to me. Lots of different flavors going on but overall it's not very potent. Easy to drink."
"M - Just what I expected from seeing how much of that foam clung to the side of the glass. Big and chewy with a dry finish leaving you craving the next sip."
"Mouthfeel is buttery, creamy and thick, and it works well for this beer. Drinkability is quite good due to the lack of any overpowering flavors, and the buttery character in the middle makes me want to keep drinking this. Finish is just bitter enough to get the palate ready for the next sip as well. This is a really good regular stout, and it's nice to have one of these while everyone chases big huge enormous stouts all the time (myself included)."
"O- Overall, this a a decent stout. It has all the makings of being really explosive, you can taste it on your tongue that it wants to be better than it is. The sweetness hits a little too strong on the tongue at first, and controls the feel of the beer from there, very sweet."
"Great brew overall. Fun to drink, easy to appreciate. Would definitely rec. to anyone."
"Flavor is heavy on the smoke, malt and a bit of hops to add some balance. It lacks any overwhelming ""flavor"" per say, but its a good heavy balance. Body is big, and its a smooth beer going down, particularly with a reasonable ABV."
"D- A solid beer, especially for the ABV. It's a good near sessionable beer and I plan to get this again. Also, it's one of the best regular stouts in regards to character. Most stouts seem lacking in one way or another, but this one has all you could ask of a 6% stout."
"Cheers!"
"D.) Due to it's lighter body and only 6.0% abv, this is something you could have a few of and still keep your wits about you. This would be a great cold-weather beer. Unfortunately, I could never find Bell's beer when I lived in Syracuse, and I don't have too much time to drink big winter beers in the Florida heat."
"D- This is a pretty approachable stout, in a world filled in RIS this provides a nice lower ABV alternative."
"Another excellent offering from Bell's, I've enjoyed everything I've had from them and this one was no different."
"D: I have been too busy with BA stouts so this one went down very easily."
"D - Nice and drinkable, at at 6% ABV I could have a couple of these in a sitting. Solid everyday Stout!"
"This seems very comparable to the SN stout actually... however less hopped. This is a good go to beer."
"This beer was definitely drinkable but one was enough. I would definitely drink it again."
"I was also unable to locate a bottle dating so I have no idea if this is fresh or not.."
"Very drinkable. The beer goes down very easy. With moderate alcohol, you can enjoy these all night long."
"D - I've had better stouts. From Bell's. It's just decent to me."
"D: i could kill a few of these fairly quick due to the smooth goodness of them. i would absolutely drink this again."
"The CPJ"
"D: I really enjoyed this glass and will certainly be picking this up again; glad I gave it a second chance after picking it up initially and being disappointed (maybe I was expecting something much more similar to an imperial stout- this is a totally different, but equally enjoyable style)."
"D - Very, very drinkable. The thinness of the beer goes down very smooth and it carries the ABV well"
"A daring beer, complex but a bit too much. not a chore to finish, but kinda close."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable beer. Especially if you like black coffee or licorice. Not my drink of choice, but definitely a great beer."
"Pours very very dark. A reddish tint around the edges. A small amount of brown head that sticks around for a bit. Smells roasty and chocolatey. Lots of bitterness on the nose from the dark chocolate. Tastes sweet and malty. Lots of roasted flavours and a tough of licorice backing it all up. Coffee and licorice blend well. Thick solid mouthfeel. Well carbonated. Fairly drinkable but its a pretty low abv"
"Drinkability: Well crafted and complex without being huge and in your face. What a delicious beer. I think you can sip this for an evening, and I think you put 3-4 back in an evening as well. It's actually pretty versitle thanks to a wonderful taste profile combined with a reasonable ABV."
"Overall a pretty good beer. I'd go for an expedition stout over this every time, but this is a little cheaper and easier to find."
"Overall its not a bad beer."
"This is a very flavorful stout for 6%. Loads of roasted flavors as well. I expect these flavors in a RIS so it is really nice to see in a lower abv brew. Caramel and buttery notes come out more as the beer warms which adds an odd flavor so I prefer to drink this stout a bit colder."
"D=Outstanding, especially for this style. The low ABV definitely helps, along with the good, but not overly complex taste."
"Poured almost black with a huge light brown rocky head that lasted throughout and had excellent lacing. The aroma was of burnt cereal malts, a leathery yeast with notes of molasses, chocolate and coffee. It tasted mildly bitter and acidic in the beginning and finished with a sweet/bitter coffee flavor that stayed with you for an average length of time. Mouthfeel was full in body and creamy in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall a pretty basic stout."
"Hey, my label's different! (I'm sorry, it's all I had to start with. I'll try better next time...) No matter, it pours sleek obsidian (that seems to want to be tinged with either ruby or garnet, but just can't quite get it done) topped by a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, light char, a very light touch of anise, and a sprinkling of dark chocolate. Though there may be more listed there, the roast is king, and everyone 'round town knows it. The taste mimics the smell, with roasty dominance continuing. However, here the dark chocolate and anise shine through a bit more, along with a dull cut of coffee in the back room. The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a pretty nice stout, kinda one-dimensional (and then some), but it definitely hits the spot when a stout is desired."
"Overall, a pretty decent stout. Nice and creamy, though the burnt coffee aftertaste is a bit unappealing."
"D- Good but i am not a licorce fan"
"The amount of body and flavor are impressive for a 6% brew. Pretty substantial beer and this one seems to have aged quite well, although any licorice is barely detectable and only found because I was looking for it."
"Pours very dark brown which ends black once settled in the snifter. The tan colored head fluffs to about an inch and slowly settles. The nose offers scents of toasty malt and light coffee. A calm sweet scent is also present. The taste is bold and toasty. The roasted and sweet malts are balanced well in combination with a subtle coffee/cocoa taste that offers a bit of bitterness at the finish. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy with just enough carbonation to tickle the palate. This this stout is very drinkable due to a well hidden ABV and great taste."
"Poured dark as night from a bottle into a pint glass. A thin caramel head quickly vanished but created a light brown ring surrounding the glass. Very good coffee and chocolate notes for the nose which gets enhanced on the taste. Roasty chocolate malts on the tongue make for a real easy drink. A slight bitter finish but not filling at all."
"Pretty good lil stout. Probably wouldn't seek out again though, could really use some more sweetness in my opinion - vanilla, chocolate or something."
"D- Though this stout is a bit too coffee-ey for my likings, it was very easy to drink, and is complex enough for my likings. It was perfect with a chocolate-based dessert"
"D: The beer is easy to drink because it isn't very filling."
"Overall... anoth Bells to be very happy with"
"Has a light mouthfeel which makes the drinkibility high. This is a highly complex brew."
"Good beer. Would pick this up again."
"Drinkability is great over all. Very easy to drink, with good tastes and aromas...multiples should be a must."
"Overall: Probably my favorite American Stout. Another great beer from Bell's. This is going to be a regular in my rotation. Highly recommended. Only negative here is the lame label!!"
"D-Smooth drinker, could drink a couple of these"
"A winner!"
"D: One of my fav's from bell's will definitely be having this one again."
"Exceptional example of an American stout. Tons of flavor with excellent balance."
"D-Overall, this was a disappointment from a brewery that has gained high accolades."
"The flavor is closer to the classic dry stout profile. It has notes of espresso and faint nuttiness. There's a blend of hop and burnt toast taste in the finish which lingers long after the swallow. The body light to moderate and the carbonation is spot on. A good, but not great, stout."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Full bodied and creamy. A flavorful beer with a wonderful smell but I couldnt manage to drink too many of these."
"Even though the ABV is not crazy high, it's not one that I'd have back to back. This is a one at a time as the coffee keeps me satisfied at one. Could certainly drink this another day. An overall good brew."
"This beer pours a black color with a tan head that fades rapidly. The smell gives way strongly to smoked malts. Coffee notes exist behind the prevalent smoke notes and lend to an overall interesting aroma. The main taste that comes through is char, now I know how that sounds, not too pleasant, but with the smoke nose (because it doesn't come up in the taste) it's not too bad. The remaining flavors are rich caramel notes and a backer of roasted coffee. The mouthfeel is bitter and astringent on the palate. For a stout the body is pretty damn good, but this doesn't sit too well on the tongue with out messing with it. It has the strong bitterness and acidity of a strong cup of black coffee. The drinkability of this beer overall is a still good, and I would not turn this beer down if it were offered to me at a later date."
"Really good example of stout. Thick,creamy and bursting with rich dark stout flavors, highly recommended."
"D- Not too thick, medium bodied, easy to drink but heavy."
"Beer is medium in body and pretty creamy in the mouth with minimal carbonation on the palate. There is a nice chocolaty midpalate flavor, after the initial mild sweetness, the bitterness in this beer is practically perfect. A very good beer all around."
"D: Neither dry nor sweet with a firmly dark, dark roast character. Just impressive depth and breadth to its flavor profile. It doesn't really too strongly on any one note and only hints at the harsh & rough things dark malts can bring. Mostly it is smooth, robust and deeply, darkly roasted - rather cozy."
"Chad"
"D. A very drinkable, solid, go-to stout. I like it better than the Double Cream."
"D: This is actually one of my go-to beers when I want a good all- around American Stout."
"D- This is a mighty taste explosion on the palate. The ABV is low enough to have a good number of these unlike most big huge stouts that pack as much flavor as this one. Nice job Bell's on this one."
"D - Good flavor and carbonation and a relatively dry finish make this a very sessionable stout."
"d- down right delicious, this one kinda blew me away, was just expecting an average beer and got a really wonderful one. this was the first time i had this and definitely won't be the last."
"D: Great drink with sweetness and bitterness combined. Sweeter beers tend to make me thirstier. Not always a bad thing. Good balance."
"D: A very solid stout, especially if you like yours on the bitter side."
"Poure jet black from the bottle with a tight 1 inch tan head. Bottle says stout brewed with licourice, but the smell of this beer off the bat is coffee and roasted malt, maybe the licorice is in the taste. Taste is roasted malt, bitter cocoa and coffee with perhaps a small amount of licorice in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was a bit thinner than expected but it finished dry do that helped the beer a bit. Drinkability is good, not my favorite stout from bells definately prefer the special double milk from them."
"I liked this quite a bit overall. I am a fan of bitter stouts, though."
"A dark black opaque color with a beige half inch head, that stays there and doesn't move. The rich aroma of coffee, chocolate, and a little tickle of licrorice at the end. The taste begins with a sweet malt, then moving to a sweet and tangy licorice flavor. Blending to a coffee bitterness that stays there till the end, that is smacked by the quick taste of licrorice at the end. The look makes think this is thick and syrupy, but in fact it is the exact opposite, thin and watery. It does gain weight gradually, but never becoming what you would think. The palate is left with a tongue smacking dryness that stays there for some time. This beer has some drinkable characteristics, a seductive and inviting look. The aroma and taste are solid, what one would expect, but the feel is inconsistent. The finish is dry, making up for the texture. Yet, it is still a solid beer."
"D: nice stout, try this fine Bell's sample. could have more than a few."
"I enjoyed this a lot. The licorice is not my favorite candy flavor but I enjoy it in small amounts. I actually pick up more coffee then licorice for some reaso."
"Drinkability - an excellent American stout very indicative of the style. Affordably priced and not over done this is the perfect dark beer for a cold winter night."
"Pours into a black beer with a tan head that has very good retention, excellent lacing and moderate carbonation. The smell is of licorice, roasted malts, faint scent of chocolate and coffee. The taste is licorice followed by some floral hops, some chocolate, toffee, and coffee notes. The after taste is licorice balanced with a mix of bitterness and sweetness that is nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is a medium soft creamy feel that is also thick and chewy at the same time. This is a very drinkable beer and is now one of my favorites after trying it for the first time. This is a must try stout for any beer lover that likes a good beer."
"D: very"
"Pours black, with a tan head about 1 finger high. Really dark in appearance cant see through it which is classy for a stout. Lacing quickly sticks to glass but falls away quickly too. Smells of sweet coffee, hints of licorice, stronger licorice on second sniff. Tastes good and solid like i would expect from a stout. Sweet coffee taste with undertones of licorice and caramel. This is very tasty. Has a thick mouthfeel with nice carbonation goes down solid. Tastes fantastic. I really like this stout, its a nice twist on this variety of beer. Tastey! would definitely drink this again...and i cant wait, i think i will have another!"
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Overall impression: Good stuff. Check this one out if you get the chance."
"Nice chocolate stout appearance, light coffee bean nose, somewhat unique for reasons I can't quite point out. Tastes of strong middle-palate malt, more malt than coffee, which isn't typical of a stout. Light body but full flavor, lingering malt bitterness. A different kind of stout with a burnt malt and a lighter, illusory complex flavor. A pleasure to drink."
"Notes: Batch 9984. Really enjoyed this. A great stout, and just what I was hoping for. Definitely worth picking up. Really balanced and a joy to drink."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A well made and easy drinking stout. I love two hearted, but have been a little less impressed with a few other of Bell's offerings. However, this is another good one."
"Taste: Kind of bland first entering the mouth, but a distinct malty stout flavor takes over in the middle, with a bit of bitterness coming in to mix things up. Mild spice and dark fruit in the finish, with smokiness and bitterness very present in the aftertaste. Journey along the palate is slightly dirty and prickly, but there's a certain creaminess to the body and mouthfeel at the same time. Like many of Bell's beers, this strikes me as decent and above average, but nothing mind-blowing. Too dirty/bitter for my taste, probably, but you could do worse. Other reviews mention licorice, but I really have to look for that consciously to even faintly detect it. Good head retention and one of the foamiest, stickiest sheets of lacing I've seen in a while. All in all, B at best, decent-ish, but not a personal favorite."
"I'm a fan, but not going to be craving this tomorrow."
"D - This is a very good stout. Mouthfeel is excellent - that alone is enough to have me come back to this one. Flavors are good and blended well...recommend giving this one a try."
"D: Quite the tasty American stout, complete with the herbal, semi-fruity bitterness of American hops married to a dark-roasted, creamy and bittersweet malt blend that warms with its 6% ABV. Full-bodied and roasted indeed, the Kalamazoo stout is a very good, traditional American stout."
"Drinkability - This beer could get me in trouble. Truly an outstanding beer. Well balanced and easy drinking. Could make a night or two out of this all too easy. I can see myself sitting by the fireplace with this all night long."
"D: A stout that lends itself more toward the savory than the sweet. Dryness is a dominant sensory quality found here, becoming relentless by the finish. Qualities of this beer allow it to stand out from other American export-style stouts, which makes it worth investigating even if frequent return visits are unlikely."
"Cheers.."
"Drinkability: The flavor is bold and invigorating; drinking a bottle for breakfast sounds like a good idea. I am impressed, and also a little frightened by the prospect of drinking Bell's Java Stout, which must be pretty sinister if it is more coffee flavored than this."
"D - This is high for me. It is a simple yet effective beer. Nice ABV."
"The feel of this beer is hearty and full bodied. It is big but not heavy, going down with little effort it tickles as it goes down. A really delicious stout."
"Drinkability- good after dinner, not more than one."
"I like this stout an awful lot because it reminds me of Boulevard Bully! Porter. Only not as good, because Bully! Porter is less sweet, features some heavy hops, and is even more roasted. Regardless, Bell's has opted for something restrained here, and they succeed. This is a beer you will always be happy to drink."
"Pours a pitch black, with a dark tan head. Smell is roasted coffee, with a deep earthiness and a hint of the licorice. Taste is dense and roasted, with a bitter base. nicely complex. The feel all the while is complex too - dry, yet effervescent. Drinkability is above average. A unique brew, that's for sure.."
"The mouthfeel is medium to medium full with a level of carbonation which lends a little bit of creaminess in the mouth. Drinkability is pretty good with the only ding against it being the lasting roast after the sip is done. I find this character in many, but not all, stouts and I don't find it very pleasant. Overall this is a really great stout, readily available, and with a great flavor profile, One of the better ones I have had."
"D - Very good across the board but just a little to roasted for me, the finish has a bit of brutality to it. One is enough to damage the tongue from sampling another beer. Great stout though."
"D- not hard to put down but it isn't exactly my favorite stout, however its a decent one that is worth picking up every now and again"
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Thick black with a small tan head that turns into a cap with some great lacing. Smell is burnt sugar, roasted malts, sweet black licorice, spicy hops. Taste is spicy hops and roasted malts up front, some burnt flavors, coffee, and licorice in the background. Mouthfeel is medium body and rich, finish is slightly dry and clean. This is a delicious beer and easily my favorite american stout, right up there with Shakespeare stout."
"I miss you bell's ... a lot."
"Poured a nice very very dark brown. had a decent tan head on it that lasted for just a little bit before falling and leaving just a little bit of lace on the glass. Smelled of dark malts, chocolate, and molasses. Tasted of chocolate, molasses, toffee, and a hint of coffee possibly. Decent carbonation with a medium/heavy body. Coats the mouth nicely and really gives you a chance to taste it. I really like this beer. I could drink these all the time. Great job Bells."
"This one pours the darkest of browns with the slightest khaki head which quickly dissipated. It smells rich and sweet, as of molasses. It tastes bold and rich, very coffee/java like. It is rather sweet but appealingly so. It drinks smoothly and medium bodied. It has subtle carbonation but has an appealing mouthfeel. This one didn't miss where most craft American stouts miss. It's very drinkable, a great American stout, probably one of my new favorites."
"Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised with how good this is. I don't know why - Bell's always delivers."
"This is a very nice beer, easy to drink, with just enough character, and certainly something I would like to enjoy again."
"Normal pour into a pint glass leaves 2 fingers of mocha colored head, with light lacing. Somewhat muted scents, maybe some roasted malts, some dark fruits as well. The taste is much more pronounced than the nose - malty with a bit of sweetness upfront, also some semi sweet chocolate which is followed by licorice / fruity flavors on the finish. Complex and well balanced, maybe just a touch thin in the mouth. Otherwise, another nice offering from Bell's Brewery."
"D- This is one tasty brew. Im ashamed that it took me this long to try it."
"D - Well I did like it and may pick up a six pack in the future but it defiantly treated me better than the batch 9,000. Soild stout."
"Drinkabilty - High. Id love a case of this but ive never seen this around til i hit a bottle shop on a trip. I could see drinking 4-6 of these if i didnt watch it. Has everything you'd want in a regular stout."
"Good, but there is some better stuff around for sure."
"(32)"
"This is one of my favorite stouts, without dipping into the imperials. A very solid brew, and one I will purchase again and again."
"Drink well my friends"
"I would like to try a fresh one now too, just to see if the freshness would make a change in the appearance and taste."
"One of the most flavorful regular stout I've ever had...can't believe I hadn't reviewed it yet as I've gone through a number of sixers through the years and will continue to do so. Fantastic stuff!"
"D- This would be a great beer to drink by a campfire."
"Drinkability is limited somewhat by the bitterness, but it's tasty and pretty well balanced. Nice representation of the American Stout."
"Serving type: bottle"
"To be fair, if I didn't like smoky beers, the taste would probably have turned me off. Given my bias, I give it a B."
"D: I would stick to this as a goto Stout, as well as recommend to a person willing to expand their styles."
"Given the style and ABV, this is a very solid single stout. Tally another + for Bell's."
"D: Good drinkability. I would get sick of it after a few or so. It does drink fairly easily though."
"D- really nice. I also drank this in a Stout tasting of 14 different stouts I setup. This beer was ranked #2 second only to Bells Expedition"
"D - Moderate. Good with Mexican food and any cooler evening adventure."
"D: This is an excellent example of this style of beer. Its smooth and drinkable, yet very complex. Bell's beers rarely disappoint me. I wish bell's distribution channel would bring it to the west coast so that i can enjoy these beers more often."
"Overall this one damn tasty beer. Bells set the benchmark for stouts with this brew. This beer is great example of not going overboard, just a great stout overall and one of my favorites. A classic example of focusing on staying true to the style rather then breaking the mold."
"D_Full bodied,full flavored American stout. Extremely session-able Extremelyflavorful ."
"As far as stouts go, I don't think this would be among my top choices, as the chocolate is a bit on the bitter side for me, and it's just too thin. Pretty average."
"D: Maybe I got a bad batch, but I have to say this beer tasted off and was not harmonious at all."
"A very solid stout, fairly heavy, but it's flavors and complexity are what one would expect out of a good American Stout."
"Overall- i would compare all other american stouts to this one. bell's really went to work on this american crafted piece of excellence. for being an ipa fan and mostly that this brew is great for a change of pace. i highly suggest you all to give this a try."
"D - Awesome stout. Easy to drink and extremely tasty. Fantastic finish to my around the world tour of a bells variety pack."
"D: not as challenging as some imperial stouts, so it's very approachable"
"D: A must try. Could drink this again."
"D: About as drinkable as they come."
"There is an overall sense of several flavors vying for the lead in this one, not exactly reaching an accord. This could be distracting. Taken in whole with the on/off body this probably decreases the repeat same-session drinkability but nonetheless I enjoyed Kalamazoo stout and will not have a problem finishing the other five, and I will buy it again."
"A very good everyday stout."
"D: Great, this is one of my favorite American Stouts. Nah,..this is my favorite."
"D - Very approachable, easy to drink stout. I'm not crazy about it, but it's good."
"D - Easy and tasty! However a bit filling after a few."
"D - decent overall. would love to see an ""Imperial"" version of this sometime. body is lacking and falls apart at times."
"D - This one was quite the mixed bag for me... The appearance and aroma were great, the taste was middle of the road but confusing, but it fell apart in terms of mouthfeel and drinkability... Overall I found this one rather unpleasant and slightly off putting..."
"D: A delicious stout, an excellent representation of the style, and another success from Bell's. All the same, I wouldn't drink more than one every once in a while. Definitely one to pick up as a single, but I don't know if I'd grab a six-pack."
"Pours pitch black with a nice sized tan head that diminishes rather quickly. I smell some very sweet chocolate scents. Lots of chocolate. Some sweet malts and maybe just a tiny bit of hoppiness. This taste is definitely highly chocolatey tasting. Tons of sweet chocolate and vanilla dancing around on my palate. I also get maybe the slightest little bit of coffee in the aftertaste. This sure is delicious though. The mouthfeel on this is a bit light. It's not watered down or anything, but it could use maybe just a tad more body to it. The drinkability is very high due to how tasty and light the mouthfeel is."
"This beer is amazing, everything that I want in a straight-up stout."
"D: A lighter stout. Not really sure where the licorice is coming in to play. Maybe its that tingly feeling. A decent beer, but not one I would seek out again."
"D- not a huge fan. The feel throws me off a lot, and the licorice is a flavor I'm not used to dominating a stout like this. Don't think I'd get again"
"Drinkability - Not bad at all, but as I would always personally do, I wouldn't drink this with food, at least not with anything very heavy or filling. I think you would do just fine drinking one or two of these by themselves."
"D: Are you kidding me!! I could drink these all night. And, for the price, I just might do that very soon!"
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts: Very smooth and drinkable; quite complex for a standard stout yet very inviting. Bell's puts out many solid beers, and this is no exception. This is a very potent drink which almost comes off as an imperial or experimental stout, though it is technically a standard American stout. It is quite cheap and widely available in my area, which results in a great deal because the brew itself is superb."
"Buy Again? No."
"This one pours very dark black and the head is brown and made up of big bubbles. The aroma presents some notes of roasted malts but nothing else. On the taste, it is still roasted malts and the bitterness at the end is similar to an espresso coffee. Creamy in the mouth. This is a good stout. Nothing complex but it delivers to bring some good feelings in the mouth. A nice one to have and could be very sessionnable."
"D - bell's certain has no problem with brewing stouts, very enjoyable, nothing out of the ordinary but its nice to see the basics being done properly"
"Easy to drink, especially if stouts are your thing. If you are a porter fan but don't like stouts, this is your beer. I will be buying this one again. Great job to Larry and his employees. Another reason I love Bell's."
"Drinkability: Great finish. But then again, Kalamazoo always brings a smile to my face."
"Despite the somewhat creepy-looking guy on its label, this beer utterly enjoyable and a great milk stout. I'll surely visit Kalamazoo again."
"Notes: I loved the smell of this one and the taste was quite inviting. The only thing I wasn't terribly fond of was the harsh bitterness I detected towards the end that made it somewhat off-putting. I would definitely buy this one again, especially considering the reasonable price."
"Conclusion: Bell's has some great beers...this one just doesn't come together for me. I can't really pinpoint it."
"Pours a thick and dark brown color, nice plume of brown head, leaving little lacing behing. Smell is of charred wood, earth, hints of bitter coffee and cocoa. Despite the aggressive scents, the taste is a smooth blend of the char, smoke, earth, coffee and chocolate note... hints of licorice and molasses in the background, the subduedness is almost porter like but and interesting finnishing taste is present, almost bolder than the first sip. Medium to Full bodied, chewy and grainy. A very nice unique stout."
"D- Excellent American stout and one of my favorite beers. If I were closer to home (Michigan) and this were more readily available, I'd drink this more often!"
"This is by far one of the best American Stouts that I've had the pleasure of drinking. This is a great beer to sit down with friends and enjoy with friends. I've had some really good stouts, but this is by far going to be one of my favorites."
"D- really nice. I drank the whole six pack."
"D - Easily, even eminently drinkable. Hit the spot wonderfully after a long day at work."
"While this is a decent stout, there are many better ones out there, even by Bell's, such as their Java Stout or Expedition Stout."
"D: A very good stout; the licorice flavor could wear on you after a while but it holds up fairly well"
"DB- A fairly standard six pack price and a good stout flavor with a nice addition of licorice. It is nice to have variations on a pretty beaten down style and licorice certainly does the job. I am glad I picked up a lot of Bell's when I was in PA and hope to go back and try some more soon."
"I think if this beer weren't so easy to get, it would be rated higher. Scarcity makes demand I guess. These are the days of limited release. . ."
"D: Easy going, almost sessionable beer, definitely a session beer in flavor, just not alcohol (6%)."
"I had a half pint of this the night it was tapped. The head had awesome retention, as have all the Bell's casks I've tried. The nose nearly matches the flavor of the actual liquid, being light and playful with the roasted malts that are typically quite heavy. Needless to say it was gone way before I was ready to be done with my beer. Kudos to Bell's again."
"D - An excellent stout. Definitely worthy of being a staple."
"The licorice adds a nice dimension to this stout that is definitely welcome. Not too sure how this would go at parties - unless I'm there, cause I'd drink this all day long."
"thumbs up."
"It's nice to have a tasty easy drinking stout of a lower ABV after drinking BCBCS and KBS lately. Would definitely buy this again."
"Nice session beer to wash down a burger."
"All in all, this is a good beer. I was very surprised by the well blended flavors in this one. If you like stouts, then this is a definitely must try. Worth hunting down."
"This is a very good, easy drinking brew. This is yet another sessionable brew from Bells."
"Pours a thick black with a tiny tan head. Smells rich and wonderful; notes of chocolate and vanilla with a hint of spices. Taste is also excellent - a bitter blend of cocoa and a hint of licorace. Not very sweet at all. Mouthfeel is thin and a bit overcarbed. Very drinkable despite the richness of this beer. Very nice."
"Drinkability - Not as filling as the nose indicates. Definitely tastes like much more than a 6% beer."
"D: I would have another, for sure. This is a well-crafted beer that would be highly session-able for the stout lover. Pretty decent price tag, too."
"Notes - Plenty of carbonation"
"This is a very flavorful stout, without needing to be some crazy 10%+ beer. Very drinkable. If only I could get Bell's here!"
"M/D - Full body but thinner than the smell suggests. Lacks residual sweetness, ends dry. Relatively easy to drink, lowish ABV and big flavor, good beer."
"Served cold from bottle into glass, leaving yeast in bottle. 2 fingers of beautiful tan head that lingered for 15 minutes. Great black color. Initial taste was fine with the licorice adding an interesting layer, followed by one of the worst lingering tastes I have ever experienced in a beer. The mouthfeel was viscous without being dense. I could not drink more than 1/2 of this beer."
"D: Well, it's D is high..I made a few trips back to the cask, it was just addictive as hell. Nice job on this beer!"
"Picked this up on a whim, so glad I did. An exceptional stout. Incredibly chewy in feel. Complex and warm. This stout is a little more smoky than chocolate or coffee but not an overwhelming smokiness. Dark fruits also come through. A little thinner than some stouts but it really works for this one. Also beautiful black appearance."
"Has a nice chewy, full bodied mouthfeel, with a nice level of carbonation present throughout the brew yet still very creamy. Perfect mouthfeel for a stout."
"M/D- Smooth silky mouthfeel. medium-full bodied, low carbonation. nice easy drinking stout, not overpowering of the senses."
"Rating by Tommy Davis from www.BrewFanatics.com"
"d - I would not have a problem drinking this by the mug. goes down easy and flavors are enjoyable"
"Served up deep, dark, nearly opaque black brown (like the Ikea wood tone) with a beautiful creamy tan head. Aroma of roasted malts, some coffee and a touch of bitter cocoa. Damn, this IS a tasty beverage. I had never had the K-zoo stout until now and am feeling major regret over what I have missed. The flavor is very well balanced between malt sweetness and the roasted coffee and chocolate character. Not too sweet or too dry, it really hits the target dead on. Full bodied, chewy and insanely smooth coming out of the cask. Nice, bittersweet finish that begs for another sip. I could drink this all day. Superman wears Larry Bell underpants."
"Pours opaque with a small head. Cloudy cap and some good lacing. Smell is licorice malt and some vanilla. Taste is malty. Vanilla is great. My favorite aspect. Licorice and malt some coffee. Drinkable light mouthfeel. A little thin at times. Overall good brew"
"the licorice isn't as subtle as i hoped, but is nonetheless interesting and harmonized into the brew."
"Nice stout. I've had better but this one has some nice individual characteristics."
"The mouthfeel is on the thicker side with below average carbonation. Drinkability is good, I've never been a big fan of licorice but it wasn't too overpowering in the beer."
"Pours a beautiful opaque black with a nice mocha head atop it. The beer has a wonderful nose. Licorice, molasses, chocolate, sweetness, yummy. The beer tastes quite nice with a rich body that has a traditional stout maltiness with a bit of a bitter kick and a great deal of molasses in the finish. The flavour would likely have been a 4.5 if the mouthfeel had been better. Perhaps it was the aging, but the carbonation was too low and it didn't have any real carbonation in the mouth to make more flavours burst out. It was so antithetical compared to the large head that was poured... Bad mouthfeel contributes to the lower drinkability grade, even though the beer could have been 4+'s across the board with more carbonation."
"Beer poured black with a nice two finger tan head that is long lasting. Nose is roasted malts. Taste is roasted malts with a coffee presence, finish is hoppy. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth. Drinkability is quite good. This is a nice roasty hoppy stout that is almost at a sessionable abv level. A beer definitely to put into the rotation!"
"The taste is great--sort of a fudgy, coffee-like, really much more bitter than sweet, roasted, nutty, and chewy stout, a little bit charred, very smooth and full. Decadent really--a great dessert beer, would pair brilliantly with a cheese plate."
"drinkability: highly recommended. thanks to jdv for this one."
"d - Not a bad stout. I enjoyed the smell much more than the taste; I thought the bitterness was a little too prevalent in the taste. I would drink this again."
"Overall, this is just another great beer from a fantastic brewery. For a standard stout, there's a whole lot of complexity and variety of flavor. You can't go wrong with Bell's and this is just another example as to why. A very good to great beer that is certainly worth drinking."
"Pours black with a tan head. The aroma is awesome, with coffee, roasted malts and some cream. The flavor is bitter coffee, roasted malts, cream and some chocolate. The aftertaste is cream. Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Rich coffee and dark chocolate flavors, mingle with roasted malt and alcohol sweetness. Touch of bitterness on the finish. Not as dry as some in this style, but that's not to say it's sweet either, because it's not. Nicely balanced."
"Can't wait to get my hands on the expedition stout if I can find it."
"Bell's Kalamazoo Stout poured black, with a brown head, that was of decent size. There wasnt much of a smell to it. It had a heavy taste, and there were flavors of coffee. It was heavy but easy to drink. Overall it was a very good stout, deffently worth picking up, only real downside is its a little pricy."
"Overall, pretty good, nothing crazy or overpowering, really reminds me of a sessional porter."
"D: Easy; didn't expect a stout with this flavor to be so smooth and chewy at the same time, but I could easily drink a few in one sitting."
"D - were the taste a bit stronger this would be a really good brew. As it is you could drink this singularly all evening, but there are better options out there."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a dark coffee color with a dark beige head, typical for a stout. Aroma was a mix of roasted malts, coffee, and dark chocolate. Taste was similar to the aroma, but with a little more emphasis on the roast and coffee rather than cocoa. Pretty good weight, one of the better stouts I've had."
"Well carbonated for a stout and has a silky feel. It has a soft roasty taste that makes it very drinkable. It is good on a cold winter's day or a warm sunny, day at Bell's beer garden."
"Feels chewy in the mouth, not a bad quality, but cannot handle many of these in one sitting."
"D-it is very clean and goes down nicely. huge flavor for a single stout, more powerful than some imperials I have had. this goes down great and could easily be a go to single stout."
"I'd recommend this. Good not great--one problem may be that I was tasting this alongside of Bar Harbor's Cadillac Mt. Stout, which was incredible. Makes me want to try the Expedition to compare with Brooklyn BCS."
"Pour is very dark brown with some orange to ruby highlights when held up to light. About a finger of tan head that hung around for a few minutes and left lots of lacing. The smell was anise, espresso, and vanilla with a slightly smoky undertone. Coffee and sweet vanilla are the major tastes. There's also a smoky, nutty thing going on. I didn't get the licorice until I was in between drinks. Has some bite in the feel and a pretty clean finish."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with no freshness date, just a batch number. Almost totally black in color with about an inch of tan head. Roasted grains, malts and nut like smells. Dark chocolate flavors, some minor notes of dark dried fruit. Thick mouthfeel, almost syrupy. Very tastey stout, would certainly have this one again."
"I would recommend this stout to anyone who wants to try a stout but isn't quite sure. A beginner stout if you will."
"Notes: To experience euphoria, pair with fresh chocolate chip cookie."
"Overall - The dark fruits in the nose bothered me a bit with each sip, but luckily the taste of the beer made up for it. In a way I'm glad I've passed over this one and I will probably continue to do that. There are better stouts out there for the price, but by no means is it bad."
"d- velvety and smooth. easy drinking, but just not my style of stout. i like em big and real thick ;)"
"D: Quite full bodied for a beer that is this low ABV. Bell's really know's their stouts and it shows here. A bit carbonated for its style but it works for me here. Nose and flavors are complex and enjoyable. I wouldn't hesitate to go for this one again."
"D: Not too bad for a heavy. This is one of the most drinkable stouts I've had. Drinking a few of these in succession around a campfire would be quite satisfying."
"That molasses follows through on the palate with a swift kick of vanilla. And as I leisurely took my final sips, I got an aroma and flavor of chocolate mousse. Like the final bite of a delicious dessert. Great job Bells."
"Overall a solid stout, but not one of my favorites."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Overall this is a very solid stout."
"D - Overall not that complex. Not one I would seek out again."
"Bells, I've had many of your beers now, and I have to say Kalamazoo is one to be remembered. Would love to have a chance to try their cream stout, expedition stout, and this tasty brew side-by-side. I know that would make for one hell of a night."
"This is a stout you could pour into a snifter and sip as a winter warmer when you're not in the mood for a high alcohol bomber."
"This is a good stout, but it's powerful, astringent dryness limits its appeal for me"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Next review!"
"This is one beastly stout! Gorgeous black color in the glass with dark brown head that almost overflowed my glass. Head retention is good with nice lace. Nose has some pleasant freshly ground coffee aromas and a trace of fruit in the distant background. Big dessert flavors are noted on the palate, perhaps like one of those double chocolate chip cookies. Hops balance out nicely, and finish is long with a lot of roasty flavors."
"Wrote this from my phone, hopefully not a ton of tpyos....=)"
"Smooth mouthfeel, followed by a long, bitter finish. Easy drinking."
"Pours jet black in color with a boisterous brown head that leaves a decent lacing behind. Aroma consists of bubblegum, licorice, with hints of toffee, coffee, and roasted malt. Taste is bitterness of roasted malt and coffee up front, with sweetness of black licorice in the finish. A bit watery finish as well though."
"Dark, almost opaque color with a thin tawny head. Aromas of burnt coffee and faint hints of chocolate. Some fruity and hoppy notes as well in the nose. Medium bodied and smooth. The taste is consistent with the aromas. Nice coffee bitterness. Chocolate and caramel and toffee even a little vanilla bean. Very easy drinking stout. Not at all heavy. Makes you want more than one. A very, very competent offering by a premier brewery."
"Drinkability and mouthfeel: Very drinkable for a stout. This one has a lower alcohol content and manages to be crisp and clean. Very flavorful and fun to enjoy."
"Licorice and chocolate in the aroma. My friend picked up some definite soy sauce notes also. Taste is roasty malt and licorice up front. Clean finish with some lingering coffee notes. Medium body. Clean finish. Unusally high drinkability for a stout while maintaining big tasted. Another winner by Bell's."
"D- Drinkability is not bad, but not great, either. The burnt (and somewhat bitter) flavor makes it hard to drink quickly. The slowest-drinking low abv American stout I've experienced. I normally don't mind bitterness in a stout, but there's nothing really balancing this out."
"Essentially an average looking stout that's enjoyable in every way, but wasn't quite as exceptional as I hoped."
"M/D- possibly a little on the thin side here. a nice subtle carbonation fits in quite well. the mouthfeel brings out some of the coffee characters, so it does work for this beer but I could use a little more viscosity. it's quite easy drinking for a stout. no extreme flavors slowing you down."
"D - This beer is so complex it makes many an RIS seem simple. No element of this beer is even slightly offensive to the senses. This will be a staple in my fridge."
"In all, a very tasty stout that doesn't sacrifice flavor for drinkability. I like this a lot and will probably purchase again."
"This one pours a dark dark brown, but with not much head. I dumped it pretty hard towards the end and got maybe 1/8"". Smells of coffee and chocolate, and tastes the same with some licorice thrown in. A nice blend of flavor, but not very intense. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout, and this one is almost bordering on a porter aside from appearance."
"Drinkability: Very good, and not too bad in terms of alcohol. I could have a few of these, but after a while, I think i would get sick of how ridiculously strong and coffeelike this is."
"D - An overall satisfying taste and a very easy drinking beer."
"Medium body very smooth and easy to drink. Wish I bought more than one."
"Drinkability- Excellent, especially considering this is a stout. Not a session beer, but I'd drink two."
"pours a licorice black color with a 1"" head like all bells brews have.. it had a black cherry ring with some nice lacing,,smell was chocolate,molasses fig and plum the taste was a bittersweet chocolate with an over roasted coffee taste followed by some currant fruits and malts..overall a good stout allthough a little to bitter and not well balanced..not my favorite but worthy..bells is no longer a go to brew for all styles 4 me their quality in small batch brewery charm has taken a hit in their hopes to expand to quickly to many areas to fast and in turn has hurt them imo"
"Slight hop bitterness in front fades into a roasted coffee rich flavor with anise showing up to on the back end. The mouth feel of this is great, really full and creamy without being to cloying. The aftertaste shows mostly the roast flavor and just a bit of the hops as well, giving this beer a spicy kind of aspect to it. Overall this is a really solid stout, and at 10.99 a sixer and only 6%, I'm only a little bummed."
"This is one of hell of beer. My first offering from Bell's and I'm impressed. A wonderful American stout."
"This convinced me to pick up a case. This time around, I wasn't as impressed. Still good, just not as good as the first. Only thing to compare that may be the reason, it was better ice cold. The colder the better. The second time I had it there was more of a bitterness to the licorice than recalled. Overall though, definately a worthy stout...enjoy it!"
"M/D - Medium bodied and a very easy drinking beer. The plain old American Stout is often neglected, but this is an excellent one."
"Great roasted flavor and char taste in this stout."
"Thinner mouth feel than expected from an American Stout but I like it. Makes for about as sessional (yet decent) a stout as you are going to find."
"The stout pours a jet black with a tan bubbly head that is about 2 fingers thick. Not much lacing lines the glass. Ah how I love the smell of a good stout. Big malty smell hits you up front with a sweet nutty finish. Taste is a little different than I am guessing it is the licorice that is giving the strange sweet quaff, but I can't quite pinpoint what is going on with this thing. Very good tasting none the less. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp. Drinkability is of course high, I don't think there is a Bell's brew that I couldn't handle a whole nights worth of drinking. Overall a great American stout from the brewers at Bell's."
"MF&D - I'm a bit divided on whether or not to give the body a 4 or 4.5, I think it is a bit too light, but the carbonation does a great job of thickening out the overall feeling. the body is a very light medium, but the carbonation is quite full. either way, the drinkability is extraordinary, as the beer is incredibly delicious."
"D- All around a very respectable stout. I wouldn't refuse another but I can think of some other beers I'd rather have."
"Pours a deep, dark brown with a thin tan head that quickly dissipates. The aroma provides a hint of coffee, and the flavor is reminiscent of black coffee with a bit of fruity malt sweetness to balance. Heavily roasted malts are one thing, but the flavor of this one makes me think they went one step further and burnt some of the malt. Again, however, the malt sweetness brings some balance to this dark bitterness. This combination provides a nice crisp mouthfeel without giving up the distinctive flavor profile that makes this stout as easy-drinking as many of the year-round offerings from Bell's."
"Jet black with a light brown head and deep dark mahogany highlights against the light. Roasted malt and chocolate on the nose. The roasted flavors are awesome, strong but nicely integrated. Great balance between the roasted, coffee bitterness and the devil's food cake, fudge/chocolate flavors. One of the most drinkable stouts I think I've ever had."
"Damn fine stout."
"Drinkability-Could easily sit down and drink a few of these anytime. Really enjoyed the brew, a greatly balanced unique stout in my opinion."
"Obsidian color with tree bark colored head, abundant aromas. Dark bakers chocolate everywhere, something alot like raisinettes too. Mildly roasted, a bit milky flavor. Licorice is hardly noticeable. Some minerality in there too. Very rich. Mouthfeel is very chewy. A moderate ABV makes it much easier to order a second."
"D - It's easily drinkable & I would like to see how it fares on tap. Other than that, I am in no hurry to drink it again. There are several other stouts I would turn to before this; several other Bell's offerings, too."
"D- This is one sessionable stout! I love black licorice so this was a real treat for me. Definitely will always have a spot for one in the fridge!"
"I went to this brewery back during the time I lived in Michigan. It was called the Kalamazoo Brewery then and not Bells I think I had a bottle of this, not really sure. I got the bottle and poured it straight down the middle of the room temperature glass and beheld a glass full of black liquid with a tan head about 1-2 fingers tall. The aroma was very smokey with hints of chocolate. Tasting it revealed nothing more, still a lot of smokeyness and some roasted malt and a bit of coffee. The mouthfee was a little heavy but not too much considering you couldn't even see through the glass holding it up to a light."
"I'm not big on stouts or licorice, but this is very good."
"(From tasting notes dated 23 Aug 2009)"
"Overall: A nice variation on the magic of Bells A+ stout recipe."
"Drinkability: Fairly easy to drink."
"(D)- A good stout with very potent roasted components. Great for a fall/winter night beside the fireplace, or for an early morning pick-me-up. Rather simple and straightforward, but rewarding nonetheless."
"This was a nice medium stout, the strong coffee taste made it very drinkable for me."
"Pours a dark brown with a small head that quickly reduces to a collar. Aroma was light coffee. The taste surprised me. IMO, Bell's forte is the IPA types and their dark beers are not up to that level. However, the Kalamazoo stout is an exception. Very nice flavor of coffee and a little licorice. Far better than their porter or that horrible expedition stout (absurdly strong coffee taste). The mouth feel was a little light for a stout, not bad. Drinkability was quite reasonable for a stout, the 6.0 ABV helps."
"This is a very drinkable stout, and at only 6% ABV I'm sure I could easily consume a sixer to myself on a cold winter's night. Yummy!"
"This beer pours a deep dark opaque black with a thin dark brown head to it that recedes very quickly, not much lacing to speak of. Nose is of strong coffee with toasted and roasted malts in the background. Taste starts with some burnt malts, moving in to toasted malts in the middle, finishes with a strong bitter coffee finish. There is a bit of cream that mingles in this beer to give a touch of sweetness. Medium body, low carbonation, creamy feel to this beer. This is by and far one of the best stouts that I have had recently, and is one to sit with for a long time."
"Mouthfeel was rich and silky. Moderate fine carbonation."
"I really can't put my finger on what I think about this beer. Stouts are not my favorite style, but the taste is interesting. Even on a stout kick, this wouldn't be the first one I'd reach for."
"D-Nice stout I would love to drink again. I am going to pair this with a Cu-Avana Intenso cigar and I am betting it will be a nice pairing.."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, but it has a surprising carbonation bite. There is even a slight acidity that I wasn't expecting. Drinkability is high. I could (and will) slam these back all night. This is going to be one of my go to stouts. Reasonably priced too."
"The texture and feel of this beer is perfect. Full bodied, rich and thick, much moreso than I'd expect from a 6% stout. This beer is an absolute joy to drink."
"D: Nice example of the style, but I prefer heavier stouts."
"Notes: I feel as if this stout is one that is perfect for someone looking to start drinking this style."
"Notes: this is a big beer with lots of dark fruit. This is an imperial stout in flavor without the ABV"
"My bottle of Kalamazoo stout poured a deep, opaque black, as if from Stygian depths. Its thin, light brown head slowly disappeared, decorating my glass with a pretty lacing. A light, chocolatey smell. Roasted, almost charred, coffee flavor. No bitterness or aftertaste. Immensely smooth and drinkable. Thick and hearty mouthfeel. Much more drinkable than Old Rasputin, although it lacks the latter's complex array of flavors."
"This is a very drinkable stout. A little burnt tasting, but still excellent, and the 6 percent ABV makes it sessionable."
"Pours nearly black with a thin beige head and nice lacing. Coffee aroma and a little roasted malt. The flavor is complex with some coffee, malt, chocolate and a mildly smoky finish. Medium-heavy mouth feel is satisfying. Not too sweet nor bitter, good balance. Overall quite good and will probably be a regular for me."
"OVERALL: A nice and tasty treat, but overall not quite a smash hit. Lots of bold flavors, which were both enjoyable and almost overwhelming. It might be tough to have more than one of these, but that one would be a real treat. Good beer, a must try for lovers of the style."
"Drinkability: Excellent beer, but a little filling for my taste. However, I could certainly get this again."
"The body lets this one down, it's just too light. A little more bulk to this one, a little more roast and it could be a world-beater. As it is, nice but nothing spectacular."
"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still a pretty damn good stout."
"pours a dark black with a light head, tan in color. was no lace, but the head and color was great. smells a strong strong coffee and chocolate with roasted malt and hops. a very creamy feel with a full body and smooth carbonation. tastes mostly of coffee and chocolate."
"D - I usually do not like licorice, but the addition of this to the Stout actually was welcome here and produced a good beer"
"D: Great stout and pairs fantastically with my cheesecake for dessert."
"Tasty beer. Good flavor of roasted grains, not overly bitter at any point. Slightly burnt chocolate taste with even a slightly sweet finish. Not a lot of overwhelming hop character to this beer, but balanced well. I don't think I'd go out of my way to get my hands on more, but it is an easy beer to drink more than one of."
"Drinks very smoothly, the sweet/cream flavor makes it a great drinker."
"Tastes like old musty cigar smoke... this is slightly below average for the style. Maybe some sweetness for balance or some other dimensions?"
"Another great one from Bell's. I could easily have a few of these over the course of a night."
"Darkest brown, almost black with a dark chestnut head of dense foam that leaves thick creamy lace behind. The smell is roasted malt, coffee, fudge and anise. The flavor is nice and roasty with much of the same flavors as the nose but with an assertive charred bitterness that balances the flavors nicely. Nice medium heavy mouthfeel, smooth and slightly viscous. A great stout."
"Well, it's no Expedition, but it's still pretty tasty. This would actually make a fairly decent 'session' stout."
"To be honest, I wasn't expecting a great deal from this beer, but it pleasantly surprised me. Its a darn good stout. I'll definitely buy this again."
"Kalamazoo Stout's another fine beer from Bell's. It's a very, very good Milk Stout. Easily one of the better ones out there. Personally, I think the coffee flavor's a little too intense for the style, but it still produces a really fine tasting beer. I like coffee a lot so that doesn't offend me. It might be a little better if that aspect were more restrained and allowed more of the other flavors to shine a little. Slight complaint, but there it is. A little more body would add a smoother feel, as well. Who am I kidding? This is a damn fine beer and worth seeking out. Go find a few."
"Pours out a dark, pretty much black color, with like a cm brown head. Kind of thick and dense, leaves just a little bit of lacing. It sort of fades, but does have pretty decent retention. There is an incredibly roast barley smell - tiny hints of chocolate and coffee. The roast character is very nice, much greater than the average sweet stout. Not a huge amount of sweetness, but there is kind of a creamy smell, with a bit of a lactic twang. Very nice. The taste is very nice too. A bit burnt, but overall exactly what it should be. There's a dark roasty center to it, like some kind of a combination of dark bitter chocolate, or coffee, but really, it can't be anything other than the roast barley and black malt. A tiny bit of sourness, some decent sweetness, with a tiny bit of estery, oily taste, but not overopowering. A nice bit of sweetness balances it out, and fills out the body. Leaving it nice and creamy. Pretty full and pelasant. I'd say this is a great example of the style. One of my favorites to date, particularly because of the extra roasty character. A nice straightforward stout. A good beer for any occasion."
"Comes out of the bottle a deep, opaque sable with a thick beige head. Aroma is strong and oily, mainly of burnt coffee. Mouth-filling flavor is strongly smoky with a coffee undertone and hints of molasses. There is just a hint of sweetness and just a hint of hop bitterness. Texture is thick and smooth with a tingly edge, and it leaves a coffee-ish aftertaste."
"Drinkability is high based on the flavor and the relatively low ABV. A classic and it seems to keep well."
"It trades off a little body for drinkability, but that's just nitpicking. It's obviously a great beer."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Creamy and full-bodied...borders on chewy. This is a rather robust beer...and a fine example of what I would expect from a milk stout. Very nice!!"
"Another solid stout from Bell's. While the Kalamazoo Stout is definitely more complex in its tastes than other similarly situated stouts (while I realize its no longer in the same stylistic category, I think Young's Double Chocolate is fairly comparable with its roasted coffee/milk chocolate flavor profile), it doesn't have that same mouthfeel and overall experience for me.  Nonetheless, I would heartily recommend the Kalamazoo Stout to any stout fans, and I look forward to drinking this beer again."
"Drinkability: One of the top two in the style I have tried so far. Definately worthy of my 200th review on this site. A great beer by one of my favorite breweries, you barely notice the high abv...Really tasty stout"
"D: I'd love another. This is an excellent representative of the sweet stout style."
"Tasty, but very filling. Great dessert beer."
"All in all, a very nice (albeit sweeter) stout from Bell's. Everything melds quite well and its construction is nearly flawless. This is not one I would seek out all the time, but as the occasional session stout, hell, I'm game!"
"D: Very drinkable for such a serious beer. Could drink 3-4, but wouldn't out of respect."
"Finishes very well. Smooth and mealy, with a bit of brown sugar."
"Drinkability - A nice drinkable beer. I would drink this again."
"D: Fairly drinkable. A less-intense stout experience."
"Not sure if this is an English Sweet Stout or an American Stout. Doesn't matter, as either way, this is the best non-Imperial Stout I have ever had."
"This isn't really exceptional, but it is a solid lighter stout that is pretty sessionable."
"Drinkability: I turn to milk stouts as a snack, something to enjoy after dinner and could get around to two or three in a row if I'm in the mood. This beer is pleasant, great drinkability, sipper and savor or session if you can. I would recommend this for the man looking to get his woman a stout or a man looking to enjoy a few on a cool night. Love this beer."
"Overall: These days its getting hard to find good stouts with bold flavors that come in at a relatively low abv (to my tastes at least). This is one is pretty good, But I wouldn't put it up with the likes of Obsidian, for example. It is a bit on the thin side and over-carbonated. The aroma is terrific, but the body and taste don't live up to that promise."
"D = This is a fairly easy drinker for a stout. I don't quite buy into the taste, but it goes down easy anyway."
"D- Overall a pretty good brew that had a deep roasted flavor."
"Overall, this is a solid stout with bold flavor that hinges on being sessionable. Highly recommend."
"Buy this beer if you want something good to drink. Nothing else needs to be said."
"Pours black with a huge rocky tan head that holds great ret & leaves an explosion of lacing. Aromas are chocolate, roasty, espresso creamy, rich, dark bitter bakers chocolate, roasted barley, french roast coffee, ashy. Mouth-feel is velvety smooth, creamy, full body. Overall, great to go back to this and reaffirm its awesomeness."
"The mouthfeel is fairly light and I prefer it to the taste because I don't get that kinda nasty licorice aftertaste when I let the beverage simply rest in my mouth. I'm obviously not a big fan of this one, but I respect Bell's and enjoy stouts enough to appreciate the character this beer offers to a true beer advocate."
"D: Very good stout, one of the best I've had in a while. Would be perfect as an evening beer. Highly recommended, would drink again."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, medium-full body, with a higher than expected level of carbonation."
"Notes: had this about a week ago, just taking me time to post the review, though it's been saved on my computer. Bells are not available in my area, but I got this from a friend that made a beer run in Ohio. I wish I could get it more often, without a two hour drive involved. Want to give props on how thick this beer is, something a lot of so called stouts lack."
"Very drinkable beer, it's so drinkable in fact that this glass of it may be going down slightly too fast."
"Over all i'm very impressed with this beer. It's everything I look for in an american stout. Strong but not to hoppy and a great, lasting finish. I highly recommend it!"
"D: This is an exceptional beer. Stouts are my favorite style and this beer is one of the reasons why. I do enjoy a lot of bigger stouts, but this one stands out among others. Bell's brews two of my favorite stouts between this and Expedition."
"D: Very good. Another quality offering from Bell's"
"Overall, this is another great beer from Bell's. It is quite drinkable because the flavor does not thrash the palate and the ABV does not send you to the moon. If you haven't had it, it is definitely worth trying and likely enjoying."
"D - This is a top level stout. Not the best by any means, but it's right up there in the big leagues. Dig the licorice. I've always been a big fan of black licorice."
"Drinkability: Another solid beer form Bell's. Not as sweet as some milk/sweet stouts, but maybe a little more complex."
"Poured a thick, almost pitch-black body with brisk carbonation that led to a two-finger tan head that died at a medium pace and left some spider lacing. A pleasant, thick malt smell of roasted, maybe toasted, maltsoats, something akin to bread and coffee malts and a little bit of chocolate and caramel. A medium-to-full bodied beer that mixes being extremely smooth and creamy with a burnt dryness. Goes down smooth, almost slick at times and has the drying sensation that a quality stout possesses. Taste is comprised of bread malt, some roasted/toasted and coffee malt notes (possible toffee), some chocolate and caramel, maybe molasses, there seems to be hints of heavy fruits in there. My pallete is all over the place trying to pick up the bits and pieces of everything in there. Even has a slight alkie kick on the backend to boost it up and some spices. A mildly warming, complex sipper that is great to relax w/ anytime, especially as a nightcap."
"D- Not too heavy and not too carbonated. Overall, a good beer, but I think I enjoyed it better fresh."
"Overall: Bell's Brewery continues to amaze me. I've yet to drink one of their beers that isn't extremely inspired and worthy of my hard earned cash. The Kalamazoo stout, along with the heavier Expedition stout, is a very solid stout. Where the Expedition stout is meant to be more of a sipper, the Kalamazoo is something that can be enjoyed at a bit quicker pace. With such a low ABV, this is one that can be ready to go with only about 30 minutes in the fridge."
"Drinkability- For a stout, this is one I couldn't have more than a couple of."
"Strongly flavored, but pretty smooth. More tangy than sweet. Tons of roast, chocolate, and coffee, probably the most I've tasted in a non-RIS stout. Smokiness that reminds me of a rauchbier, but only vaguely. Slightly bitter and very roasty aftertaste. Smooth, but the carbonation is almost sharp, and, when combined with the strong flavors, almost makes the beer a little harsh. Nevertheless, this is an incredibly flavorful stout and you'd think it would be heavier based on that. Absolutely delicious and very drinkable at around 6% abv."
"- Not too dry but i'm sure it would be a bit tart for some... but for a stout, it is what it is and should be. Very drinkable as well... it's like Guinness but a bit more refined. A very pleasant stout. Would be a great stout with seafood."
"D- not the most exciting version of this style, and something i wont buy again. i guess i expected more from bells."
"This beer pours out very dark. Taste a lot like an Imperial Stout. Smells like dark chocolate. Exceptional mouthfeel. Calm and yet so smooth. Robust flavor that doesnt overwhelm your taste buds yet rich in flavor. Very nice aftertaste as well. Not an overly impressive head but creamy in color. This is definitely one of my favorite beers."
"D - Oh how I wish we had this in Texas. Smooth thick delicious flavor!! Not as sweet as I would usually catagorize a sweet stout as. More like a heavy stout but with a smoother finish to the roasted malts. Highly recommended!!!"
"A very tasty sweet stout. Thanks to Imstillthegman for the opportunity."
"Drinkability: Good - not sure that I could drink more than a few of these."
"Thin dark brown head which settles around the glass edges quickly, vacating the center. Lacing not as pronounced as you might expect. Really, truly cannot get any blacker than this, not even a hint of color. Sweet nose of grapes, rum cake, licorice (duh), coffee rinds, wood smoke, dark chocolate powder, more creamy in texture than scents, granola and cereal, as it warms a little more mixed black fruit comes out. Full-bodied, dense attack requires you focus on the act of swallowing. More roast and toast here, charred black coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate and fried butter. This tends to rise up and plaster your mouth roof while the tongue undergoes a noticeable release of pressure. The carbonation does what it can given the compactness of the whole. Same interplay between green grape/apple (acidity?) and darker fruits. No citrus nor flowers. Licorice lower here, murmur. Suggestion of mineral water opens a space for grainy notes. Nothing leaps out at you, perhaps too tightly coiled to strike fully. Tires the palate out before the first glass done."
"D: I don't think it was designed as a session beer, but it is highly drinkable for a sweet stout."
"Overall: The mouth feel is medium full with some carbonation. The finish is medium to full and last for a few moments on the palate. This is a great full flavored beer that has a lot of wonderful characteristic in this stout. It is not overtly sweet, but well balance and very easy to drink. A very nice brew."
"drinkable? most definitely. I could go through a few of these in a sitting... an excellent stout. Really struck me more of a strong stout than a sweet stout... more roasty and bitter notes than creamy sweetness. which is alright... it's still delicious, just not as expected. definitely worth the time to give it a shot."
"This is a very good, very drinkable stout, and a full notch better than the double cream stout. I'm not sure what the differences are in the recipes but it doesn't seem quite as simple as 'start with Kalamazoo and add more cream,' which is too bad, because that would make the double cream stout a better beer. This is a very good one. Great stuff that I'd be glad to have in my fridge at all times."
"bottle poured into a tulip. very dark with a dense tan head that subsided quickly. smelled of bitter coffee and slightly burnt toast. surprisingly thin on the tongue and very carbonated for a stout. flavors of espresso and molasses strike first with a lasting feel of burnt caramel and over-boiled coffee (but in a good way). expected this to be an intense and robust stout, but was surprised to find it thinner and softer than I thought. well balanced but lacking some of the backing sweetness of a milk stout and somewhat dominated by the carbonation. the flavors blend well and offer a pleasing experience."
"Overall: This has got to be one of my favorite straight up stouts, it's just as flavorful as a lot of RIS's without all the alcohol."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a wonderful oil black color with a thick chocolate milk head. The head is short lived, but leaves a nice cap on the brew with sticky lacing on the glass. The smell is solid with strong tones of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, but the burnt smell is a little overpowering. The taste is great. The chocolate rolls on your tongue and leads to a balanced coffee finish. This is a full bodied brew with a perfect amount of carbonation that makes the taste pop in your mouth. Extremely well put together brew."
"Pours very dark brown almost black. Not a whole lot going on in the nose. Very dark malt, molasses and bitter chocolate in the taste. Seems to be a bit reserved, the younger brother of the Expedition. A little thin, but smooth in taste. Decent beer, but there is not much that can hang with the Expo. I'll stick with it."
"D- Great taste combined with reasonable abv would make this a decent session beer. It would be a great one, but there's a little too much sweetness for this to be a classic, ""getting drunk with the boys on Saturday night"" beer."
"Poured into my pint glass. Very dark, coffee colored with a substantially sized, creamy, off white head. Smells of coffee, toffee and malt. Very roasted...Tastes like roasted malts with a very slight sweetness. Exceptionally smooth and well blended. Easy on the palate."
"The archetype of the style. This is the Anchor Porter, the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, the best representation of the style. That being said, I'll always be on the lookout for one that's better, and rest assured, it will happen. Even Jordan retired, and brewers will always get better. But now, this is the top dog. Cheers!"
"D - This didn't knock my socks off...but it was nice to sit back at sip on"
"M/D - a nice light bodied stout that has a very smooth nice taste and is easy drinking."
"Pours a dark black. 1/4 inch head with slight retention and lsight lacing. Smells of a dark rich malt and sweetness. Fits the style of a Milk/Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and slighty thick. There's a high carbonation level and an associated bitterness. Tastes very rich, of a strong malt, some roasted malt as well, and there's a slight hop bitterness. Overall, a very good rich stout - definitely couldn't drink more than a couple of these."
"Overall I liked this as a good stout to have on hand when a nice food beer is needed."
"Kalamazoo Stout pours jet black iwth a big, fluffy, brown head with good retention. Smells are good but nothing extraordinary: all of the dark chocolate and roastiness expected of a craft stout. Sipping --- wow. Before I even say a word about the taste let me just say that the body of this beer hits me just right. Its substantial fullness is is keenly felt initially before the carbonation lightens it up and lets the numerous flavors come out to express themselves. The roasty and dark chocolate bittersweetness come through clearly but don't shock the senses; rather, they are quite well balanced. The finish is a long and gratifying tug-of-war between the burnt malts and smoky bitterness that I find endlessly gratifying. A very nice stout that I intend to have year after year."
"Completing my Bell's Beer Slam of tonight with this stout brewed with brewer's licorice. Smell is chocolate, both milk and semi-sweet and cinnamon, some coffee, cookies and cream ice cream, wow. Pours to a jet black with a creamy tan head. Taste is roasted malts, sugars, chocolate milk and some coffee hints. Only slightly bitter at the end but overall sweet. This style is really starting to grow on me and this brew is definitely in the upper echelons of this style. Complex and delicious. A typical offering of Bell's in that it has a spectrum of flavors throughout. The mouthfeel is heavy but smooth. A little sweet to be a sessioner but these would be great rotated in with a hoppy brew."
"D - Easy to drink, could knock out a few of these."
"D- Average, a pretty good brew, but nothing I would go out of my way to have."
"D-Very easy to drink with a nice and unusual complexity. Enjoyable for sure."
"I must say that I really enjoyed this offering. Had it at the Melting Pot in Minneapolis. There isn't much of a head but a nice deep black color. Smell and taste are very similar. Nice chocolate nose and taste. A bit of dry malt on the back end. Mouthfeel is a bit weak for the way that I like my stouts. Drinkability is great for the style."
"D- very good stout that you can have a few of due to the moderate ABV"
"Pours a deep black that I can't see tyhrough. A creamy brown, modest head sits on top, and leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is earthy, chocolaty, grainy, with a hint of licorice, and milk. The flavor begins with sweet dark malt and fruit, but is quickly cut by an acrid, slightly smokey and roasty bitterness. A nice lingering roasted barley flavor sticks on the palate. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick, with a nice mild tingle from the carbonation, reminding you that it's there, though not in a dominant fashion. Drinkability: Very nice stout with a LOT of different flavors going on. One of the more interesting/complex non-imperial stouts I've tried. Kind of like Shakespeare Stout, but a bit more ballsy and earthy. That being said, the drinkability is good, but I wouldn't opt for this as a session beer by any means (though I'm not in a big stout mood these days). It's a well balanced, interesting, flavorful and bold stout."
"This tastes pretty good for a sweet stout. Again, the tastes mirror the scents pretty well as I'm tasting dark chocolate, coffee, nuts, and some wine-like flavor. Mouthfeel is a little weak. Slightly watery. It looks thick, but goes down a little thin. All in all, not bad. Give it a try."
"All in all, the finest Milk Stout I've ever had."
"i venture to a decent Stout now and then, and this one I really like. Black as night, nice creamy think head, nose does remind one of licorice. it's nice to have a Stout not heavy on the coffee , chocolate flavor. The licorice is faintly there, toasty, surprising bit of hops for a stout which nicely licks off the whole package. Worth a buy anytime. if your into Guinness or English Stouts give this one a try, the flavor comparison is insane head to head."
"Overall, another excellent offering from Bell's. Only wish we could get this here in the Great Beer Desert of Texas (St Arnolds being the Oasis). Highly recommend. For me, too bitter to want to make a session beer (if available) but this would be a player in the change-up rotation."
"D - Very good. Rather complex without being a very big beer. Seems to be a theme for this beer -- quite impressive for its size."
"Nothing crazy but a killer example of a robust American Stout (I don't agree with the Milk/Sweet stout classification at all)."
" A very drinkable, delicious stout- at 6.0 abv go for two (or three)"
" Never once did it cross my mind that this might be strong enough as the 6.50% ABV would indicate. The deep brown hue with the traces of crimson at the edges indicates that this has a softer tone to it than other beers in it's style, and if you can handle a strong chocolate aftertaste that subtly lingers, this is worth going out of the way to find. If root beer could be made for adults, it would probably resemble this..."
"Great thickness and mellow-moderate carbonation which is just the way I enjoy my stouts. A very good drink overall and can't wait to buy again along with other Bell's brews."
"Bells knows how to knock their stouts out of the park and this is no exception. This is a fantastic stout and one of the best of its style. Highly recommended."
"The flavor is slightly sweet and kinda milky when it first hits the tongue. It's followed a roasted malt warmness and a slight bit off coffee bitters. It then finishes with a complete turn around with the same characteristics that were found in the front. It's light carbonation and little less than medium body make it an easy drinker."
"I enjoyed the nice dark flavor. I also like the old school no frills label, which I think microbrewery's sometimes go too far on (many purchase a beer based on the graphics on the label, see anyone who like's Saranac beers)"
"Despite all the quality attributes of this beer, I do find it to not be particularly distinguished against the competition."
"Exceptional and won't ruin the checkbook. What more could a guy ask for?!?!?!? This beer is just like a good dog...always there, never fussy, will be the same today and tomorrow, no frills, and will stand by you through thick and thin. What more could you want?!"
"Mellow roasted flavors, licorice, milky consistency. Goes down fairly easily, but quite filling. Nice."
"Lighter colored tan head on top this jet fuel black liquid. Head retention is fair. Aroma...faint coffee grounds, milk-like sweetness, a pinch of cocao. As for flavor, this is very coffee-like. Roasted ground coffee. But there's a little more carbonation than I like here. Anyway, very roasted flavor. A slight sweetness akin to creamer keeps this beer in balance. If you like your stouts robust and roasty, this is one to grab."
"Drinkability is a high point, this goes down easy and Would make a good session stout. Would have again."
"This beer has a nice creamy texture with a fairly mild amount of carbonation which really lends itself to the creaminess throughout. A really good offering from Bell's as far as I'm concerned."
"I'd put this stout in my top five for any variety. (RIS, Dry Irish, Milk Stout, Oatmeal, etc)"
"This is a sexy stout."
"Overall - Very nice satisfying stout."
"D: Very drinkable. This reminds me of why I used to drink a lot of stouts."
" Pours BLACK like oil with a medium tan head. Aroma of roast malt,coco,and coffee. This brew has a very smooth creamy falvor with notes of licorice, raisin, smoke, vanilla, coffee,and so on,and so on. I could find no fault with this stout, other than I believe it made me slightly flatulent,good stuff buddy. Thank you to the hard working crew at Bells. Very Drinkable"
"Michigan... Great state, great people, great beer! Come visit...Enjoy and get your beer on!"
"Notes: Again, another good stout from Bell's but I really did not detect any licorice. I have read in other's reviews (after publishing mine for the first time) that the licorice is sublte. Subtle would be the minimum word that I would use to describe it. If anything there is a shade of it in the taste spectrum. For a more classic stout look for Bell's Expedition."
"I love the Bells dark offerings, they generally add more hop character than most. This works out really well in their stout offerings. I lived in Kalamazoo, so maybe I'm partial. Nice black pour with a dark tan head. Standard stout flavors intense as with any Bells. I will say, as I've seen in reviews for this, that most Bells beers are not all that well balanced. The special double cream stout is slightly better, I'd rate this one 2nd in their stable."
"Poured from bottle to a Sam perfect pint. Pours a slick black with a thin tan head. Smells of dark chocolate, light alcohol, some dark sugar. Taste is of very bitter chocolate with a coffee like finish. I get the slightest bit of black licorice on the sides of my tongue as the aftertaste. Very different, bitter type milk stout. Tends to take on a medicinal aroma as it warms as well. Good, original beer."
"must try beer"
"D: This is a drinkable beer that goes down easy. It's well made and has solid attributes."
"I had read a lot of good things about this beer, and was not the least bit disappointed. Good job Bells!!!"
"8/5/7/3/14 (3.7/5)"
"D- At 6%, this is one of the more perfect stouts that I have had. I normally go much higher; for imperials, but this had everything in it that I could ever ask for!"
"Killer!"
"Pours a dark brown/black with a thin coffee colored head. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate and licorice. Roasted malt flavor with taste of chocolate, coffee, licorice, and dark fruit. Nice bitter dry finish with strong chocolate, roasted coffee and icorice aftertaste."
"Pretty good, although after trying other Bell beers I was expecting something a bit more..."
"Pours black with a very thin dark tan head. Nose is a good bit of roasted and molasses tones. Flavor brings the same with an almost oat bitter tone that mixes in. Very hearty and robust. Nearly a meal in itself. Smooth liquid feel. Low carbonation. A nice winter time beer. It's 30-something outside and this is precisely what I should be drinking."
"D - good to session but not something to really seek out"
"Great beer for the colder months and a fine offering from Bell's regular lineup. Very highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly good, given the concoction of flavors here. Alcohol's well-hidden and reasonably low, though perhaps on the high-end for the style ... but what it really comes down to are the flavors and aromas here. And though they're bizarre, they're strangely not as offputting as they should be. Anise, cocoa, heavily-roasted coffee, all wrapped up in a dirt bow - sounds weird, but give it a shot."
"I can't believe I hadn't had this before! It pours a thick, oily blackness with a light chocolate brown head. The smell is chocolatey but the taste is a great roasted coffee-ness. It's a nice heavy body and the coffee flavors are apparent as soon as it touches the tongue. It's incredibly flavorful and if you like this style of stout then you can't go wrong with this one. It remains drinkable despite it's thickness. I'll definitely be buying this again and often!"
"I was hoping for somthing a bit more thick and creamy, as the nose and flavors may have hinted towards. Still a terrific beer. I'd give it an A+ if it were more thick and creamy."
"Notes from 7/18/05"
"D: The slightly lighter body and complex flavor profile add to the drinkability of this very good sweet stout. Another winner from the Bell's lineup."
"Notes: I don't know if this one really qualifies as a sweet stout, but nonetheless, it is one full-bodied, smooth-operator that is quite the tasty brew. I really liked the interesting twist of licorice that this one brings to the table, unusual but pleasant. Overall, it's a very good stout that I will definitely have again in the near future."
"D - Pretty good stout, and a complex one at that. There are certainly lots of flavors and aromas to unearth from this brew. I've been on a stout kick lately, so it was nice to try this one after having it sit in the fridge for about six months."
"Drinkability: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It's a litlte more pricey than I prefer (although still very reasonable compared to a lot of other beers out there), and the taste and feel of it is a nice change-up. I rated it a little higher than I thought I would, but it's got a lot going for it."
"D: Never had a memorable milk/ sweet stout before this one and then this came and broke the bank! Bell's has a huge winner here, this is an amazing brew which is amongst the elite I've had at this point. I've been wanting to try more Bell's and this has me officially hooked, I'm on the lookout for more of their luscious stouts now!"
"D: It was a nice and enjoyable mid-winter, late night sipper. Not a great session beer, unless the session is two bottles long. It's heavy and too rich for a long session."
"Yeah, we can see why this beer has cult status. This Stout is so robust, you can almost chew it. Big thumbs up for the subtle and artful addition of licorice. For a pairing, try some rosemary beer-braised lamb lollipops, or even an old-fashioned pot roast."
"looks like a stout. dark. opaque. smaller head chocolate milk foam color. nice denisty. smell is chocolate, malt, molassas, and playdoe... what? i think i may have a bad bottle on my hands. had a yeast aspect but not bready... thicker. i wouldn't go for this one if you expect a sweet milk stout. its mild. in all aspects."
"D: Something just doesn't seem quite right here. Its burnt nature seems to throw everything off balance. The bottle says it's brewed with ""brewers licorice""...I've never been a fan of licorice and this one seems overly astringent for the style. It's certainly interesting, but I can't say I'd have more than one."
"A great coffee stout, Bell's really does some great stuff and I'm usually very impressed with their offerings, this is definitely one of their finest"
"An absolutely brilliant beer from Bell's, the best I've had of theirs and one of the best sweet stouts I've had the pleasure of drinking- a solid straightforward, no bullshit beer!"
"A very enjoyable stout with great flavor and balance. Would highly recommend and look forward to another."
"D - Easy drinking, tasty stout."
"Overall, this is a spectacular showing by Bell's. Not sweet like a milk stout, but a nice, big bold stout that deserves another go."
"D- This was a very nice stout. It's dark and toasty and the anise note is very well balanced. Perfect for MN winter!"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my shaker glass a deep dark brown color with a healthy three fingers of fluffy ecru colored head. Smells of milk chocolate, roasted grains, coffee, and anise seed. Tastes like a mocha coffee with a shot of black sambuca added to it (minus the alcohol burn). Rather complex with a bitter finish. Medium in both body and carbonation. A nice bitter stout that I like to revisit from time to time."
"This is a gratifyingly rich and satisfying beer. It has as much flavor as some smaller imperial stouts, but with less alcohol and heaviness. An excellent beer to take you from fall into winter. I would love to try this one on tap. Or better yet, on cask."
"I've tried a lot of beers in this style and it's a little hard to choose a lot of the time. This one has its own unique character and it's a little more iced coffee than the dark hot mochas of other milk stouts. Enjoyable and worth a reccommendation."
"Bell's Kalamazoo Stout pours a creamy dark as night black, with a fluffy tan head. It smells of burnt grains and roasted coffee, with sweetness that I can't pinpoint. It tastes much like it smells which is great; it's smooth and creamy with a mild crispness in the back of the mouth. Like all stouts it's pretty filling and a bit thick. All in all, another great beer from bells."
"This beer is very well balanced and allows you to partake in a couple. Not heavy but has enough meat in its body. It's almost as if you want another one, just to experience it all again."
"D- I am not too crazy about it. Just a decent milk stout to me; definitely not standoutish but glad I could try it."
"Poured to a good two inch head. Head was light brown in color. Stout was black in appearance. Head hung around awhile and had some good lacing that left rings with every swallow. Smelled a slight sweet cream, coffee, and malt. Had a strong burnt coffee taste with again a slight cream. Had a slight burnt coffee bitter aftertaste that seemed to linger in your mouth. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. Almost felt a little thicker. I would enjoy these on a cool October day like this one, but it wouldnt be my brew of choice on a hot summer day. Ill buy again and perhaps this fall once again."
"D: A nice drinkable stout from Bell's. With it not being distributed here I don't think I'll have it for a while, but I'll definitely revisit it if given the chance."
"Body is medium/heavy and oily. More suited to a double stout but where does it say that milk stouts can't be thick? Definitely drinkable if you like roast and coffee flavors, I don't however."
"A good session stout, but it's not my first choice."
"drink is very good wish it was a little higher abv for its desert style taste"
"all in all a good beer. i would grab it again. i would really like to try it off cask"
"The nose on the beer has a sweetness that comes through with a great hint of roastiness. The beer is super black with a nice tan head, about a centimeter in height with good retention. Looks beautiful. Not much carbonation though. The flavour of this beer is pretty roasty and not very sweet; I don't think this is a sweet stout, but the flavours are quite strong. They have a good mixture of roasted barley with chocolate. The bitterness comes from the roasted malts, and the hops are far in the background. The beer is pretty creamy with a bite from carbonation. The beer is drinkable."
"D: Not bad, but just not great."
"Good stout, I enjoyed it very much."
"D: Too much bitterness for me to drink it so quickly, but it's a decent stout. Looks and smells wonderful with a solid flavor. Definitely one of the better stouts I've had--it's almost like a RIS-lite."
"D - this is a great stout. It definitely holds its own in the flavor and interest departments for me. I will definitely seek this out again."
"My first stout tried was Guinness at the factory in Dublin, and this is no Guinness (though American Guinness is not, either, sadly). This stacks up well as a stout in its own right due to the nice licorice hints."
"Pours dark as can be (a little dark cherry color around the edges when held to the light) with nice, thick, dark tan head. Lacing is ok, retention isnt great but a very thin cream is left on the beer for the remainder. Smell is of dark sweet chocolate, some coffee grinds, and a tiny bit of black licorice. Taste is great, let this one warm up and it has a sweet milk chocolate-ness too it. Very pronounced chocolate flavor with some toasted grains as well. Very slight bitterness as it goes down but I dont detect any hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety, more on the fuller side. This is a great beer from Bell's I must say. This might be my favorite right up there with Two Hearted."
"Mouthfeel- The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine stout. It has great aroma and flavor a good sessions ale."
"Very velvety smooth with taste of coffee and dark chocolate. Slightly sweet with slight hoppy finish. Brussels lace hung nicely down side of glass. A very smooth drinking delicious stout!"
"Drinkability: Very solid beer. I'm so glad Bell's is now distributed in Florida."
"D: Solidly drinkable, very very tasty and before I even realized it, my glass was empty. Nice and smooth couterpoint stuck between this beer and the Bell's Porter."
"Overall, a pretty good stout with some complexity and uniqueness. I would definitely buy this again!"
"Very drinkable. Carbonation is just right."
"D'ability - A heavyweight stout even if just 6.5% ABV, but a good choice if in the mood for a big, flavorful stout. I could see myself buying it again, but drinking it a bit cooler."
"D: Overall a good stout with an easy drinking quality."
"This is such an amazing beer and I would recommend this to anybody! I am so impressed with Bells on this one!"
"Drinks easy, a good, not great stout, middle of the road as Bell's offerings go"
"The Kalamazoo pours a dark brown almost black color with some small reddish brown light slivers and a 2 finger brown head after a rigorous pour. A subtle but direct nose of big roasted chocolate malts. Same is with the taste, toasty chocolate malt and coffee notes are right upfront, followed by semi-sweet bakers chocolate, molasses and brown sugar. The flavors of the licorice used is very subtle and by no means threatening, this stout is so toasty it simply adds more complexity and pleasant bold nuances. Some hop bitterness is detected on the finish as well as some slight alcohol heat. It sports a surprisingly light/medium body, very smooth and sort of creamy, the after taste is long, lingering and very enjoyable. Excellent beer, must try."
"D: I love this stuff, and I say that while admitting I like bigger, heavier stouts. I'll always be happy to bring it home."
"this brew poured up a dark brown color with a light brown head...perfect little appearance...the nose was delicious dark chocolate malts....love it....the taste was very nice and straight forward...subtle sweetness and dark chocolate malts...subtle alcohol blended in the flavor....not bad at all though....wish I could get my hands on a sixer!"
"Drinkability: Not bad, not great, one was enough."
"I like the color, it's nice and dark . The aroma is quite pleasant. And the feel is robust but not to thick."
"The taste was surprisingly hoppy for the style, not that I really minded. Bitter, resinous hops coated the palate, while baker's chocolate and black licorice added a great balance. The chewy, thick body was perfectly carbonated and the hop bite at the finish made the experience all the more enjoyable. Bell's makes very few brewing erros, and Kalamazoo isn't one of them...not by a long shot."
"taste wise is melasse flavours with shy licorise, malty, dark chocolate with a shy bitterness, some hints of coffee notes are present too"
"I'm very picky with stouts and this is one of my favorites. I don't like too much roasted malt flavor, and this certainly isn't heavy. It is a great balanced stout with just enough of everything. Very drinkable for a stout."
"12 ouncer with different art work then shown on this site, no freshness into be had. This one pours stout black, dark tan head, well knot, retentive and then leaves plenty of slippery and then sticky lace. Roasty/malty nose. Yummy, easy drinking stout, with notes of sweetened coffee, molasses, dark toast. Sweet and roasty, silky as it rides over the tongue and swirls in the mouth. Top notch in all ways, more fine suds from Bells"
"Pours an opache black with a small tannish head. Aroma is sweet chocolate and coffee. Maybe just a hint of dark fruit buried underneath all of the dark malt. Flavor is really more of the same although the fruit shines through a bit more. Finishes somewhat short and cocoa bitter. Medium bodied, very smooth texture."
"Pours a black color topped with just a thin brown head. Aroma is roasted chocolate and malts but rather mild. There is however quite a bit of flavor to this one. It starts off with a nice rich toasty dark chocolate flavor blended in with malts and traces of coffee in the background. A bitter aftertaste lingers a while. Mouthfeel is nice and full. In between sips I keep tasting a roasted, almost burned, dark chocolate, bitter flavor. This is good."
"Overall, very good stout with a creamy mouthfeel. The softness of it would lead to several brews, something one can't get with many heavy hittin' craft brew stouts."
"D - An enjoyable and reasonably complex beer. Pretty drinkable, but with this level of sweetness I wouldn't want more than one. The chocolate notes in the flavor and aroma are particularly nice."
"Overall this isn't a great beer, but it is a very good one. Worth a shot."
"D-One of the best stouts I have had in a while I have been very hit or miss with Bells and this is for sure a direct hit."
"Definitely a good stout worth the money you pay for it."
"a decent stout the licorice is a nice touch, i'd buy it again, but not really seek it out."
"Another day, another great beer from Bell's. Pours to a thick, rich head of dark tan that leaves nice lacing. The smell is somewhat muted - I get some tree bark, coffee and roasted malts with a faint, sweet note. What this lacks in the nose is made up for in taste and body - wow! Black licorice, roasted coffee and a nutty bitter finish that lasts and lasts. All of this is nicely built on top of a rich, thick, sweet frame. I will be keeping more of this around as our nights begin to cool."
"This beer tastes and smells of bitter chocolate/coffee, raisins and has a big malt profile. A bit on the sweet side. I absolutely love the carbonation and mouthfeel of this beer, very smooth. Drinkability is relativly high on this one. A great session beer even with the ABV being a little higher."
"D= A damn fine stout! Despite the ABV, its still a session beer. I really enjoyed this one and will drink again."
"The taste on this one didn't really do it for me, compared to Bell's other stouts. I didn't find it that interesting. I really really dug Java, Double Cream, and Expedition stouts, but I didn't find this one to be as interesting. Excellent mouthfeel saves this though; It's certainly not bad, I think my expectations for Bell's are now very high."
"The mouthfeel is medium and a bit dry, and the drinkability is way up there."
"D: Sip or go on and indulge a little more carefree. It is suitable for either, which is a a plus. An interesting flavour contrast, this one might take a couple experiences to really get a feel for."
"Pours almost-black, shades of brown around the edges of the beer when held up to the light. Massive frothy mocha-colored head fades very slowly, and leaves behind big gobs of lacing. Sweet smell, almost a touch of cookie dough in there, some smoky aromas, mild coffee. Bitter coffee taste, some milk chocolate, charred background. Pretty active carbonation, medium-bodied stout, really smooth. I'd have this one again, a really solid brew."
"D: A good overall stout, I've had better though. Could probably only have about 2 consecutively before my mouth was overpowered. I could definitely see myself buying more of this if it was available in my area."
"This is probably one of my favorites in the American Stout category. Very tasty, very smooth, and quite drinkable. Another great beer from Bell's."
"I really enjoyed this beer from Bell's. Can't wait to get me some more."
"This is definitely not your normal stout, but I rather enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to try something new, or during a large, hearty meal."
"Worth trying if you can get it."
"Drinkability is pretty top notch. While the flavor does somewhat fade quickly, the overall brew as a whole is nicely done. A good Bell's beer!"
"Overall, a very drinkable example of the style that I feel falls a bit flat on mouthfeel and taste. I tend to lean more towards the Double Cream though. However, this is a good starting point for a stout and if you like it already, seek out the Double Cream for more of the goodness."
"A likeable, fairly straightforward stout. Roasty aromas and flavors dominate, with some coffee and bitter chocolate and a solid licorice presence. Goes down smooth and easy, and the reasonable abv makes this a nice one to spend a quiet evening with. This isn't one of those stouts where every sip is a long flavor journey, but what's there is quite pleasant. Bell's seems to excel at making solid, yet approachable beers, and this is no exception."
"overall, a very drinkable interpretation of a stout."
"Nothing to set it apart from the pack, but a pretty good beer."
"D- Easy to drink, just don't think I could drink a lot of these."
"Black in color with a mocha colored head after pouring from a bottle. Nose is so faint that I am not even able to place it. It teases, but doesn't make itself available. Coffee flavor is very strong and there appears to be a strong flavor of anise that I am guessing comes from the brewer's licorice. Heavy smoke flavor. I rated it a C but must admit that it varied from many of the ""normal"" stouts you might try so it almost dares you to try and pin it down."
"D = Drinkability is okay, but not much higher than other sweet stouts and I really didn't like the mouthfeel with the sting on my tongue."
"Enjoyable brew, as drinkable as you can get with a stout."
"D: Very drinkable, easy to drink. Not overly sweet."
"M/D - Smooth, clean, crisp. A great stout from a great brewery."
""
"Poured thickly from a bottle into an imperial pint. Darkest brown you can imagine, bordering on black, with an inch of chocolate milk colored foam, leaving moderate lacing.. Not getting much from the smell, just some graininess and roasted malts. Taste is slightly bitter and dry, with hints of burnt caramel, roasted coffee beans and bitter baker's chocolate. Very thick and full-bodied and light on the carbonation. As somewhat average representation of the style. I prefer their Special Double cream stout myself."
"This certainly was my second favorite taste @ the Eccentric Cafe last night. This poured a dark brown almost black with a tan head. Once I smelled this beer I knew I was in love. Very complex with deep rich coffee smells, chocolate and other yummy things. The taste of this beer was just as delightful as the smell. VERY complex and extremely easy to drink. I was very impressed with the amount of flavor they were able to fit into this beer. VERY WELL done again another beer I will suggest to my local beer distributor"
"Bell's Kalamazoo Stout pours a medium thick black with a short tanish head. The smell is moderately strong of roasted malts with a slight hint of liquorice. Taste is very malty with just a touch of tart bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, light to moderately thick, and has a low amount of carbonation. The small amount of carbonation is just enough for a really nice feel. Overall drinkability is good, I wish this had more flavor, but the silky smoothness goes a long way and makes this one quite enjoyable."
"D - good brew, drink two!"
"Another quality offering from the Bell's camp."
"12 oz bottle from a 6 pack into an imp pint glass. Pours black black with a tan head. Sweet coffee and roasted malt smell. Coffee taste that holds in the mouth with licorice in the back. I rated it a 4 in taste, because I don't like coffee, but if I liked coffee I would rate higher. The mouthfeel is pretty light, and it is a smoothe stout."
"Drink em' if ya got em'"
"D - A decent session beer. Probably not something I would drink one after the other of, but for a stout it's nicely drinkable."
"Medium-bodied, dry and somewhat crisp up front, with a lingering sticky, chewy oily character in back. Lively carbonation."
"Smell has a clean milky/malty smell. Taste follows through with additional notes of chocolate and coffee. Really nice finish. Bubbles are a bit more than I'd normally like, but otherwise a pretty smooth brew with a more than decent taste."
"Usually more of a fan of the more hop forward Bells offerings, this one impressed."
"mouthfeel is creamy with lots of texture, roasty, dry/bitter finish, delicious! one of my most favorite stouts from bells :D"
"Good stuff..."
"Dark and a bit thick with a little head. Smell is smoky and complex, and the taste follows that lead with notes of molasses and dark roasted malts. At the end of the glass, this is definitely a beer I wish I had more of... Bell's knows what they're doing with their line of stouts for sure."
"Another kick ass offering from Bells. These guys know how to get it done.."
"Pours out very dark with a lot of creamy caramel colored head. Lacing was very good. The smell is very strong, lots of roasted malts. The malts pretty much dominate the smell, maybe a hint of coffee. Taste was outstanding. Once again the roasted malts dominate. The beer is very smooth and full-bodied, also has a very thick almost syrupy feel. Overall this beer was excellent and a definite recommendation to anybody that likes stouts. I would definitely drink this again."
"Pours thick black with a good tan head that leaves good lace. Nose is of roasted malt, some copper. Taste is quite good with great roasted malt flavor, a great sweetness that is nice and mellow rather than sickly thick. Very robust. Some slight coffee and a bit of chocolate flavor. Nice little bitterness on the finish that is just about perfect. Very crisp and snappy mouthfeel, which is refreshing. Drinkability is quite good for the style, would love to session this one if it was locally available. Defenitely would be a go to stout for me. Too bad I live on the ends of the earth. Defenitely a unique and impressive stout from Bell's. Has inspired me to dig out one of my expeditions and try it again. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite all around stout breweries. Great."
"D - Overall a stout that packs a lot of punch and is yet easy to drink. Reminds me a bit of the Expedition except I found this to be more balanced. One thing I have noticed about Bell's stout is that they seem to have some earthiness and some bitterness to it that you have to get used to. However, I was rather impressed by this one and it would be a great one to have as a session stout."
"drinkability is great. this is a smooth and easy-going stout that does not overpower the palate, but provides rich and complex flavors at the same time. a solid offering from Bell's. cheers!"
"Big full body, smooth and creamy. Just a little chewy. Tastes and drinks much bigger than your typical 6.5% beer, which takes a notch away from the drinkability. The flavor and complexity does keep you coming back for more. Not quite a sipper, but not a session beer either. What ever it can be classified as, this is one damn good beer."
"D: One is enough for this average brew."
"D: It has a slight drying after taste that makes you want to come back for more. For its style, its much more drinkable than most, but its far from a session beer."
"T: Full bodied, very thick and creamy but not as cloying or lactose-y as some other milk stouts. Body has a slightly stronger nutty chocolate taste than expected and lots of rich, roasted malts. Aftertaste is more chocolate than milk. Throughout there is a subtle hop bitterness providing nice balance. One of my favorite easy drinking stouts, not just for milk stouts."
"Pours pitch black with small cocoa head. Sweet aroma of chocolate, caramel and unknown spice, perhaps clove. Tastes of medium-sweet chocolate, roasted coffee, clove, with delicious slightly sour-bitter ending on back of tongue that lasts. Everything in perfect balance. Creamy, rich mouthfeel."
"Easy drinker, but not sure about sessioning this one. Nonetheless. it's a fine stand-alone beer. Should go well with red meat."
"Bottle code on back is 7837 indicating it was bottled on Feb 21st, 2007. So it's a about 13 months old, perhaps past its peak or getting close. Has sort of a soy, or slightly sour dark malt smell to it. The taste has a little creaminess in flavor maybe from added lactose, some very mellow coffee in the background but not much else in terms of roasted flavor. Not bad, this one is probably better right when it comes out of the tanks."
"This poured pitch black with a little bit of dark tan head. It smelled like a cappuccino, with dominant milk and coffee scents, and a bit of licorice that it was brewed with. It tasted stronger than expected, like bitter coffee and burnt chocolate mixed with the surprising presence of floral hops. It was slightly thick with no carbonation and a bitter coffee aftertaste. Overall this was a pretty good stout with some unique characteristics, but it wasn't the best of Bell's brews."
"Definitely something to sip and enjoy."
"It's a heavy stout but very drinkable. Medium alcohol level, but after a few you know you've been drinking it."
"d - not what I was expecting from a milk/sweet stout. It was ok. There are way too many other stouts out there that blow this out of the water to spend too much time here again."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Dark chocolate and light roast coffee in even portions with a nice creamy backbone. The use of brewers licorice lends a spicy undercurrent, though it's subtle enough that it doesn't distract from the malt. Great mouthfeel, velvety and rich but not overly thick. The dryness of the finish really enhances the drinkability for me, as I'm generally not a huge fan of beers that are sweet from beginning to end. Great stuff here, probably a top example of the style."
"D - Very enjoyable, this stuff goes down way too easily. Great brew, if you see it, don't hesitate, recommended."
"Thanks a bunch Steve."
"This is a really nice stout, and easy to drink for sure. Highly recommended."
"Overall: An enjoyable classic stout with great chocolate/malty flavor. Recommended."
"D - This gets 3.5 only because it's a bit much to drink on a regular basis. Very good, once in a while however, and should be on anyones list who can get it."
"So easy to drink that this would be perfect to session. Nice tasty beer."
"D: This is a definite sipper that grew on me. I decided to hold off on tasting notes until I had a second later in the week. The aftertaste is a bit much, but the subtle nose and delicate palate made up ground for me. This would probably pair well with sweet desserts to help cut that bitter closing."
"d: Best cream stout I have had. I love the complex roasted character and the creamy feel. Very easy drinking. Bold and delicious."
"A very drinkable stout, much better than I expected from some reveiws and I will certainly have more of these!"
"This is a stout for those who love that roasted barley bite."
"M/D this is a great creamy beer that leaves a great sensation on the palate. i love it. good times.!!!"
"It's got a big imperial-like flavor but with the mouthfeel of a regular stout. I really enjoyed it as it opens with a nice roasted taste and ends with a sweet aftertaste."
"Overall this beer is a nice change of pace from all the RISs I've been drinking."
"Overall a quality stout."
"Pours basically opaque black with a sticky staying big tan head. Smell is big and roasty at first, with some dryness about it. As it opened up I didn't enjoy the smell quite as much. Tastes of dry, unsweetened roastiness but with a tart soy flavor creeping up more and more as I drank it. Creamy, nice body and mouthfeel with good a carbonation level, but I get the roast & ""soy"" flavor more than coffee and chocolate. Still not bad, but just had a component I'm not crazy about."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Smokestack goblet. Pours an opaque black that turns slightly red when held to the light. When poured, it has a rocky tan head that turned into a thin oily layer that left flecks of lacing down the glass. Aroma is sweet up front, like cream from whole milk. Then it melds into chocolate with a bit of instant coffee. Taste is dark chocolate, and then milk sugar. This isn't a horribly complex beer in its taste but it isn't a negative either. Mouthfeel is thin. Honestly thinner than I would have wanted. Its a really drinkable beer and a 6.5% it makes it that much more drinkable."
"This beer poured a nice black color wit a huge, rocky, tan head. The aroma was chocolate and espresso. The taste was of light coffee. Almost a ground coffee taste. The mouthfeel was medium heavy with very little carbonation. Overall this beer was great. Bell's makes some great beer!"
"D_A good medium sort of stout. Not one I would go out of my way for but a good drink."
"Drinkability - Well, it's all subjective. Didn't really like the dominant and lingering bitter taste. I wish the beer would taste more like it smelled. Some sweetness would help."
"Served in a nonic. Poured a dark opaque brown (almost black) with deep red highlights around the edges. Half-inch coffee colored head quickly dissipated into a thin skim of beer algae. Scent of malted milk chocolate and perhaps a hint of caramel sweetness lingers at the end. Taste similar to nose, but also yielded a pronounced coffee presence and perhaps a slight hops presence at the finish. Very pleasant mouthfeel; body was not overly full and alcohol was well-hidden making this an excellent session stout. Wish this was more widely distributed in my area."
"Nice chewy stout. The flavors are complex and there is a struggle between sweet and bitter over the tongue. That bitter chocolate coffee taste wins out though with a similar linger that sticks with you way past the finish. I don't know that I necessarily agree with the ""sweet stout"" designation but I enjoy the beer just the same."
"Similar to Bell's Java Stout except less intense flavor-wise."
"Close to a masterpiece, without a doubt."
"Served in a 16-oz glass at Alibi's last week (enjoyed it so much on Wednesday, I returned on Thursday for two more!) There wasn't much of a head on this beer, but what was there made a nice creamy top to my glass. The color was very dark, but held to the light, a faint dark red came through the glass. The aroma was all about the roasted coffee bean, and this followed through to the flavor. The flavor was additionally complex with dark chocolate, and as others have mentioned, a slight licorice tang. The mouthfeel was a little thin, but the flavor burst made up for that! I was really glad to find this available two nights in a row."
"M/D: Carbonation is slightly high, full and slightly creamy body. Drinkability is good, pretty easy drinking for a 6.5% stout."
"Drinkability- Not a bad brew but overall as much as I love my dark beers this one just wasn't what I was looking for. I don't think the flavors meld very well and something just seems misplaced. The best part of this brew is the mouthfeel. Thanks again to ClockworksOrange and TheodorHerzl!"
"12 oz bottle. Pours pitch black with a 2 cm foamy tan head that is lasting. Aroma of chocolate dominates the maltiness. Flavor is balanced between the bitter chocolate, mild malts, and a hint of sweet creaminess. Tons of lacing, no noted carbonation, and light on alcohol. Medium to full body. Drinkable and great for when you want a big tasting beer without the imperial alcohol."
"Overall- It's a great example of the style."
"A very easy to drink stout a nice finish to the night if it was available I drink it again"
"Recommended!"
"This a very good beer and another winner from Bell's."
"Super easy to drink beer. Smooth and mellow are two things that this beer has in spades. Super drinkable beer that I will look forward to trying again."
"Pours a dense, opaque molasses color. Brown head quickly dissipates, leaving a persistent ring. Aroma is of dark chocolate and coffee. The taste is a sweet expresso flavor, with chocolate. Some roasted bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick, slightly stick, with some tingling carbonation. A very nice sweet stout."
"Pretty disappointed with this one for the most part, do not think it measures to any of the other Bell's stouts I have tried, not worth seeking out if this beer is unavilable to you like it is for me, stick with some of the other Bell's brews"
"Poured a deep dark, almost opaque black, with a thin brown head. Smells slightly of licorice and coffee. Starts of tasting sweet, with a coffee and licorice flavor, finishes somewhat drier than the start. It is very smooth on the tongue, little carbonation, medium to heavy in body. Very drinkable, no off tastes, very much in the style."
"The beer pours a very deep black with no highlights when held up to the light. I was a little disappointed on the head on this. A small swirl of tan head dissipated quite quickly, but did leave solid lacing on the glass. The nose is fairly classic for a sweet stout. Chocolate and coffee make way for molasses and roasted grain. The flavor profile's two strongest flavors are roasted coffee and bitter chocolate, but it also has a nice medium sweetness as well. Side flavor characteristics include black liquorice and toasted grain on my palate. The mouthfeel is full bodied and very creamy. An easy drinking stout that I would gladly have again."
"I very much have enjoyed my Bell's variety case, thank you beer god."
"All in all, I think it's a pretty good brew, but strangely sweet for my taste in a stout."
"Notes: A very good stout, but I was expecting more of a unique flavor here. I might pick this up again. A good experience all around."
"D- A good beer by itself, but probably not one to drink several at once. Certainly good to enjoy slowly and sip on."
"D: Would definitely love to have this as a constant beer in my fridge. A great one!"
"D-Not bad I could have two, but if there was other beers to choose I might switch after one."
"I liked it enough to drink it again, but I won't seek it out."
"Pours a solid black with a tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lacing around the glass. Smells of roasted malts some dried fruit and a sweet milk stout smell. Taste is sweet lactose some more of the dried fruit and a touch of hops in the background. Has a creamy mouthfeel, but is a little thin. Great sweet stout, not over the top with sweetness like so many of this style tend to be."
"Definitely a good sweet stout; I much prefer the Expedition."
" Taste is chocolately with rum soaked dark fruit. Nice roasted malt bitterness, but not overly done. Mouthfeel is smooth, and full-bodied, nice carbonation level. This is a beer I have seen at my local shop for a long time, and for whatever reason I had not picked up and I dont know why. This is a wonderful beer and will become a regular part of my rotation. Terrific stuff from Bell's."
"typical looking stout- Got a good thick two finger head in a Duvel glass. Nose- some anise, bakers chocolate. Taste- very rich, and good balance of dry and chocolate/molasses sweetness. Great body and nice hoppiness on the finish. Drinks bigger than it really is. A lot of impy stouts probably wish they had the richness and flavour profile of this brew. One of the best non impy stouts Ive had. great work!"
"Pours black, with about a quarter-inch tan head that settles fairly quickly, though some lacing remains. Aroma and taste are pleasant enough, with roasted flavors and hints of the brewers' licorice coming through in the taste. Finishes with a slight bite."
"Pours completely black with a nice 1 inch tan head of foam. Aroma was an enticing mix of roasted coffee beans, licorice and dark chocolate. Taste was very similar to the aroma. Lots of roasted coffee flavor, dark chocolate and a hint of alcohol. Drinkability was damn good, as I love a bold tasting stout. Mouthfeel was medium bodied in the palate, with a slightly sweet finish. Another great beer from Bells."
"Mouthfeel-very tasty, a lower carbonation. The flavors run the stout spectrum. Bitterness from the dark roasted/black malts. Earthy hops are present and they linger with the finish. Bittersweet chocolate, robust with very little sweetness. A good froth on the palate releases some licorice flavor. Good stout and a solid offering from Bell's."
"The taste consists of burnt coffee, chocolate, and other dark malt flavors. It has a dry finish and a bit taken back by how dry it is. It is medium bodied with excellant carbonation for the style. This is a strange milk/sweet stout. It is not sweet but has deeper flavors and heavier body than a dry stout and it is not as big as an imperial stout. A good stout overall but not really to my liking style wise."
"Very dark in color with an inch of fine bubbled, tan foam. Plenty of lacing down the sides. Aroma of coffee though initially strong fades to subtle. Taste is dry to bitter. The taste is superior to the smell. Good mouthfeel with pleasant carbonation. A very drinkable beer. May I have another?"
"This is one fine stout. I will have to trade for more bell's. If not, I'll have to visit my brother in Michigan sooner than expected."
"Very dark in the glass with an equally dark thin head that does some respectable lacing down the sides. There is alot going on in the nose and taste. Nose is Sweet, dark roasted malts. The taste is simply amazing. Bitter sweet in the begining that turns to a dark roasted chocolate maltiness and well balanced hops that finishes semi-dry but makes me salivate for more. Very smooth and silky in the mouth. I feel like there is more there but my brain can only comprehend so much. Highly Recommended!"
"Thanks to kryptic for the trade."
"This is an easy drinker as far as bigger stouts go, I quite enjoyed it. Thanks to orrshow for splitting the bottle."
"I love a good milk stout, and Kalamazoo really hit the spot. Well done, Bell's. Now would you kindly sell your beer in my home state?"
"Nice dark brown almost black beer with a bit of head that is off white. The head has a nice consistency and lasted most of the glass. There is a dried fruit burnt chocolate smell at first. Unfortunately, the smell didn't translate well into the first taste. First the roasted chocolate flavor and then a hoppy bitter aftertaste overwhelms by mouth. As the beer warmed the balance between slightly sweet and bitter hops got better."
"Enjoy this after dinner, before, but not with dinner. It is just too good to pair up with food, except ice cream."
"I really dug this stout. I am a big stout fan and this one did not disappoint. The aroma wafted up, revealing some hints of chocolate and licorice. The mouthfeel was silky. The taste was right there. Some roastiness to be sure, but a nice licorice undertone that came just shy of being too far forward. Finally, the hop presence was nicely aggressive for this style of beer, keeping it from being too sweet. If you want a stout, making yours a Kalamazoo wouldn't leave you crying in your beer."
"This beer packs a flavor wallop, but remains quite drinkable. This may be my favorite stout that is not a RIS, but much more sessionable."
"Nice and smooth beer. Will seek it out again"
"I couldn't stop drinking this one. It's just outside of the range of a session beer, but a few of them can probably be handled with a good meal. The licorice adds a nice touch without being dominating and distracting. This one is more of a malt lover's beer, as the hops don't really come into play. Recommended."
"The label on the back not describing the beer should've been a good clue. Opened cold - tasted - wasn't much, but it is a stout, so of course I let it warm up. At cool still not impressive. Up to about 55 degrees and still a flat, slightly watery unimpressive stout. It poured dark, giving me hope. Head was flat and dissipated quickly. Had light milk chocolate and coffee flavors, and hints of more complex flavors, but it never got there. The flavors didn't meld, was unveven in the mouth. Light mouthfeel, neither sweet nor bitter. Would not recommend it to a serious stout drinker."
"D: I loved this beer, Bells has yet to disappoint me."
"Overall a decent stout. I wouldn't have penned this as a ""sweet"" stout, although I guess it's not as dry or bitter as most ""regular"" stouts. It's good for the lover of roasted malt, and its silky mouthfeel makes it a pleasure to drink. Not my favorite, but certainly worth a try. Recommended."
"This is one fine stout, obtained from Merchants Fine Wine in Dearborn. Poured an oily, shiny black and sat that way in the glass with deep brown edges and a tan head that settled. Very nicely carbonated by fine bubbles. The smell is of cocoa, freshly ground coffee beans, cinammon sticks, dark wood furniture. A huge roast malt / burnt coffee taste, dark chocolate and expresso with a brazil nut astringency making itself felt from time to time. The finish is nutty chocolate, a lingering choco-bitter aftertaste, quite satisfying all around. Sufficiently complex yet highly drinkable; if I had access, I'd try always to have some of this on hand, a very nicely put together stout that succeeds on so many levels. Edited to add that it was Batch 8007."
"Mouthfeel surprisingly crisp for a sweet stout, with carbonation that is not quite creamy, but that's really all to criticize with this brew. The flavors of dark roasted coffee and bitter chocolate form the backbone, with various spicy and hoppy notes dancing and fleeting. Just enough dextrinous sweetness to balance the bitters, but this is a remarkably refreshing dark inky black awesome beer. Longgg finish. Incredibly enjoyable stout, another great effort from Bell's."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, but could be more so. I would drink this all the time if it was available."
"D: Very! I'm not a big fan of black coffee, so the coffee bean aspect of some stouts/porters is sometimes a turn-off, but this one has done it very nicely for me. Well balanced, and supremely easy to quaff."
"D: Not a bad stout at all. Too bad Bell's isn't available around here."
"This beer was a very pleasant and drinkable dessert beverage."
"Pours an opaque black with a big light brown head that dies slow and laces. Smells roasty, chocolate, and expresso. All of the smells are in the taste along with a small hop bite. Balanced, delicious and subtle all around. Medium in the mouth and smoooth. Very drinkable on its own session or as a treat."
"D - This is a very good stout. Not a surprise that Bell's churned out another good brew."
"D: Very easy to drink, but as with most stouts, Ill be stopping with one and saving the rest to be enjoyed later. Looking forward to trying the expedition stout."
"D: I give her an A!"
"Bell's Kalamazoo Stout pours an opaque, dark brown/almost black with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is sweet and malty. The flavor is nice and rich, chocolate notes, and especially coffe notes are noticeable, the coffee especially in the finish. The mouthfeel could be a bit thicker, but that's a minor quibble. An excellent stout."
"Bell scores in a major way with this stout. Huge flavors with a slightly sweet background to complement the dark malts, and a long finish that leaves a good aftertaste. Smooth, coating mouthfeel. Easy to drink, and very interesting. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Rich and full flavored. This is one you could drink for the long haul with it's lower ABV."
"It's money. I might drink nothing but stout if Bell's distributed to Atlanta..."
"Despite the flavors, this brew is quite refreshing, light and very drinkable. Not my top stout, but a very good one. Would definitely re-visit this if given the chance."
"Taste was equally as pleasing. Tons of dark chocolate and coffee hit the tastebuds first, with a little bitter kick to it. A nice touch of the brewers licorice was noticed, along with some roasty malt and a bit of nuttiness. Finishes a bit dry, with a little tingle in the throat from the ample carbonation. Leaves a very nice but soft flavor behind. A silky smooth mouthfeel leaves you wanting more. Very good drinkability thanks to the lower ABV. Overall a very tasty stout."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and tasty. That meants highly drinkable. Lower alcohol content makes this a beer you could have a few of. Will definitely be searching this out again. Highly recommended."
"Pours a very dark brown/black. A tan head appears, then slowly disipates. Smells fairly sweet, of chocolate and butterscotch. A decent mouthfeel, a little thin, but nothing really to complain about. Taste is exactly what I look for in a stout. Great chocolatey/roasted/carmel taste. A little bitter at the end, but man oh man is this a good beer. This is my first from Bells, and I am sure it will not be my last."
"The head is modest, but it stays forever. Nice sandy, mocha color to it. All around a great beer."
"dark dark with a big dark tan head. big lace. smells of hops, roasty malt, coffee, chocolate, licorice. tastes like roasted malt, coffee, subtle hops, and licorcie for sure. well blended, complex and sweet. smooth, silky, thick and velvety. goes down nice. i'll have another please."
"perfect for a gloomy, rainy afternoon."
"Drinkability: Simply astounding"
"Overall, a tasty brew that is easy drinking. Yet another fine brew from Bell's. I'm thrilled that they are making their way into Florida!"
"Eric"
"Overall, this is a very well made stout and one I hope to run into again. Now I can hardly wait to open the Expedition Stout!"
"D: A mouthfull of flavor with a nice lingering bitterness. Not quite as sweet , but certainly full enough, for my liking. A bit strong for a sessionable stout, but a well-balanced one that I'd love to have again. thanks to CRJMellor for sending this one several months back..."
"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a thick creamy medium colored tan head that leaves lacing all around the glass. The aroma is dark roasted malt with some cocoa. The taste is roasted malts with a semi-sweet and bitter finish. Overall, this is a solid stout that is recommended."
"Drinkability: I could toss back a few of these without any trouble whatsoever! Nothing offensive at all."
"D - A full bodied stout w/ a good hop profile + licorice flavor with tinges of molasses. The sweetness is balanced by the herbal flavors. It is not one I would drink single every day, but so smooth I probably could."
"Get a bottle and try your hand at reviewing this."
"Recommended"
"Probably way too sophisticated for my palette since I was thinking about my next beer halfway through this one. It was just kicking the back of my tongue's ass, and I wasn't into that at the time."
"My favorite stout hands down. It has a unique bitterness for a stout that smacks your tongue instead of shaking its hand. The initial pow is balanced with malty, coffeey, chocolaty, desserty tastes. It smells of all the best things available to the style."
"After sitting and sipping this awhile, it occurs to me that this would be an excellent stout for those new to the style. Superbly balanced, straightforward but not simple-minded, and purely delicious. Also, Bell's needs to put their stuff it bigger bottles...it always disappears to quickly. Another fine entry by this excellent brewery."
"Something seems ""off"" and astingent. I do like it, especially the way the licorice plays in, but too chalky and burnt to really enjoy."
"The mouthfeel is heavy and creamy with a bit of natural carbonation. Very smooth and dessert-like throughout."
"ORIGINAL: 4.5/4.5/5/4/5 - Pours the first totally black beer I've ever seen, with a solid finger of tan head on top that disappears fairly slowly. Nose is strong on molasses, dried fruit, caramel, and maybe some chocolate too. Feel is solid, although maybe a little thin for a stout. Taste is excellent as well. All over the place. Up front is some sweet chocolate. Crazy roasted malts, and then some nice and pointedly sweet flavors of raisins and brown sugar in the middle. Roasted malt shows up again, a little more often as the beer warms. Ends with a solid, slightly hoppy bitter aftertaste. Solid aftertaste though, which sticks around with a nice sweet/bitter mix. This one's outstanding as well. I'm really stunned by how consistently great Bell's offerings are. I'll be picking this one up again. Possibly topped only by the incredible Expedition Stout."
"Overall: Good brew. I like some of Bell's other stouts better, but this is the only one currently available in Florida. It's an easy drinking stout that I can get my hands on which scores it extra points. It is complex in taste and I love the added smoke in there. There is no easier drinking stout around. Bell's in my opinion is one of the top 5 brewers around and this is one of the reasons why. Please I am begging you bring your entire line to the sunshine state."
"D: Purely subjective, its not for everyone, but I could drink this all night long."
"Drinkability: Quite nice! It should be on anyone's list of things to drink before they die."
"the taste is much of the same, roasted malts and coffee being the dominant flavors. i don't really notice the licorice as much at all. which means to me, it's just the right amount. enough to add to the flavor, but not enough for me to refer to this as ""the licorice stout."" fairly heavily bodied, though surprisingly easy to drink. theres a somewhat bitter aftertaste too it. not a bad thing really, just makes me want to drink more. i'll have to slow down though...this is the only one i bought."
"An excellent representation of the style. Pours a nice oft beige head and leaves tons of lacing down the glass. Tastes better as it warms. Lots of chocolate with some nice hoppy dryness towards the back of the tongue. Nice smelling brew. Possible coffee and milk shine through. A great interpretation of a milk/sweet stout, and very comparable to St. Pete's cream stout."
"Taste is very heavily of roasted malt, the brewers licorice adds a lovely subtle dimension, especially in the finish. Dark chocolate, coffee, black pepper and a light buttery sweetness to finish. Very well executed. Mpouthfeel is not overcarbonated with a full body and a bit of dryness after a thick, bitter finish. This is a stupidly drinkable stout, Not overly complex to me, but that's what I like about it. It's not muddled, it's well made and super sessionable. What more can you ask for?"
"An oustanding stout with a complex flavour profile. Very enjoyable!"
"Poured a complete opaque black with a two finger dark tan head that dies down to a nice lacing. Stickiness is very good, holds on all the way through. Smell is of a toffee like malt with a toasted nut aroma. Very mild hop odor as well that tickles the nose. Taste is so sweet and creamy with hints of milk chocolate and dark fruits. Aftertaste is a hint of a smokey nut character with peppery spices that tingle as well. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a mild but suitable carbonation. So smooth, drinkability is there for sure with this style. Glad I picked up another one in a trade. Bell's continues to amaze me."
"B'ham UK"
"D - It very high because it is creamy, but not acidic like some other stouts"
"I would say this is a pretty damn solid beer. It seems that everybody, including myself, is trying to reinvent the stout and this beer right here is just clean, simple, and delicious."
"Appearance is an inky black with a decent head that seems to materialize once the beer's been in your glass for 10 seconds already. Aroma is very chocolately, but this didn't show up much in the flavor. The flavor was distinctly smoky, which I was a bit intrigued by. Mouthfeel was smooth and good. Definitely recommended."
"I like other stouts better but this is good enough for me to enjoy and try their other offerings."
"It's not that I didn't enjoy this beer, it was tasty and satisfying...but, overall it's quite a bit unbalanced in my opinion, and feels like there are some flavors that could be there but aren't being let shine through due to the imbalances. I kept noticing myself thinking I was about to taste something that never actually came. Still though, not too bad overall... would I buy it again? Probably not."
"Bell's Kalamazoo Stout was opaque black in color with a tan head. The head had good retention and left a sheet of lace behind. The smell was nice with coffee and chocolate aromas. The taste was roasted grain, dark malts, and chocolate with a nice balancing bitterness and long finish. It was full bodied and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability was very good. This is definately one of the better stouts out there and is worth seeking out."
"A unique and superbly crafted Milk stout. My favorite to date, highly recommended."
"The drinkability is hindered by the metallic aftertaste."
"Taste is burned with coffee and dark chocolate and a strong maltbitter. There is also a good hopbitterness, which, together with the roasted side, are the 2 key players in this beer. The burned notes could have been a little more pronounced or sharper. Body is slightly sweet and medium. Drinkability is good"
"This is a very impressive American Stout. It is flavorful and potent. A sipper at the start, but good for more than one."
"As far as drinkability is concerned it is pretty thick, but for a stout-lovin guy that's all right. Its very, very sweet. Maybe I wouldn't have too many of these if I was out with other option, but two of these makes me smile pretty good."
"Drinkability - The 6.5% ABV is well hidden beneath the rest of what's going on with this one. I could 'nurse' a couple more watching the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Many thanks to drunkmonk... Go Sabres!"
"12 ounce long neck bottle, but with a different label than shown above. The beer has a very dark color, basically black, with just a hint of light able to shine through when held to the light. It has a thick brown head, great stability with sheets of lace. An excellent looking brew. Beer was served cold, so had to let it warm up a bit so all of the aromas and flavors came through. Roasted malts aroma with some fruitiness, coffee and cocoa. Tastes slightly bitter, roasted coffee, dark chocolate, all the flavors you want in a sweet stout. Balanced by some sweetness in the end. Full bodied, creamy smooth, with just enough alcohol warmth. Very enjoyable, solid beer, worthy of its praise."
"Average beer, I am definitely unimpressed, their Expedition Stout is infinitely better."
"A tasty stout with great aroma and complexity."
"D - Okay, I might have again, certainly worth a try."
"Overall, a good stout to keep around. Not too extreme on any front, but with enough complexity to be rewarding."
"The Take: I would get this again I have to for more fine tuning, Good Choice"
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, slightly filling, decent kick, this one is an excellent sipper, especially if youre looking for a beer with the flavor of an RIS but less of the alcohol punch."
"This was like pouring carbonated oil into a glass. It was black with a beautiful thick tan head. The aroma was faint of malt mostly. The taste is malty and spicy. It is robust but not overpowering. It ends with a faint taste of licorice. The mouthfeel is heavy and carries the beer quite well. I admit that I am happily surprised at this beer brewed with licorice, and find it quite drinkable."
"Pours pitch black with lots of lace and a head that lasts all the way down. Very roasty, malty, dark fruit, coffee, cocoa aroma. Flavor is the same but much more intense. Carbonation is spot on. Finish is actually better than the taste. Gets rid of the dark fruit thing. Not into that so much. Solid stout character."
"Poured a black licorice black with some light penetrating the beer at the bottom and at the top. It just had a thin and tan colored head of foam that just dissipated away in a matter of only a few seconds. There wasn't much of it to dissipate away anyway. When it dissipated away, it left behind a small trace of mocha rings and tan colored lace around the glass. The aroma was just a little bit this and a little bit of that. It just had a little bit of roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, molasses, and a little bit of herbal hops to finish off the aroma. The taste was a little different. It had a dominate element and that was the dry roasted malts. After that came the baker's chocolate, dab of sweet molasses, a touch of roasted coffee beans, and the slightest hint of dry roasted herbal hops at the end. It's a smooth medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation and with a simple aftertaste of just dry roasted malts and nothing else. Overall it's just an above average decent offering from Bell's. I kinda expected more from a beer with a grizzled Dwight D. Eisenhower on the label."
"Solid stout, one I'll seek out again."
"Overall: This is not an overpowering stout. Extremely well-crafted and balanced. The espresso flavor lasts for a while and is quite mellow. A very laid back stout with a lasting flavor."
"Feels creamy in the mouth, not extremely heavy, but definitely a little dry. All-in-all, one of damn fine beer, not the best, but something I wouldn't hesitate to buy again. In fact, I may pick up a couple more just to share them with friends. A very unique and wonderful experience."
"overall this is one of the better beers ive had, a deffinate favorite"
"D- Very drinkable for a sweet stout. So well balanced, and dry in the finish... leaves you wanting more."
"D - This is one of my favorite stouts. I could drink these all day."
"Mouthfeel is a bit creamier (and in my opinion, better) than the Mackeson. Both are superbly drinkable and extremely tasty. Well done."
"D: This stout performed the balancing of sweetness and roasted bitterness quite well. Extremely drinkable and enjoyable."
"Huge brown head with a black body and some very nice lacing on the glass.The taste is roasted malts and some faint chocolate.Its very smooth since its a milk stout and very easy going down.Carbonation is very easy also and its sorda between thick and thin side.I cant smell any of the smells in it.I may enjoy this more as I drink it, I think the hype hasnt set in that Im drinking a Bell's Kalamazoo stout, all in all its a damn good stout."
"Pours a large, tan head and leaves quite a bit of lacing as it dissapates. The color is basically black. The smell is of chocolate, coffee and figs. Tastes of dark roated malt and coffee with a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium. Another very drinkable, quality beer from Bell's."
"Not really a sweet or milk stout if you ask me. Certainly isnt sweet. Bitter flavors abound and the finish is bitter, borderline astringent. Drinkabilty is lower due to the bitterness of the beer overall and its astringency. Medium mouthfeel. Very Average Stout."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Large creamy, thick, tan head that stays forever. The color is opaque and murky. The aroma is a nice roasted chocolate with a licorice twist. The taste follows suit. Big creamy, choclate, roasted highlights, slight astrigent bite once the beer is in your mouth (hop bitterness), and that licorice flavor pulls through. The body is medium and oooh so creamy smooth. A great brew that I can enjoy a couple in a sitting. Maybe my favorite stout."
"Overall: Thanks go out to HimerMan for this fine brew. You truely are great for hooking me up with a fine Bell's stash. Great beer."
"D: A fine, fine stout. Excellent mixture of bitter/roasted and creamy where one aspect doesn't steamroll right over the other. Excellent balance!"
"Drinkability: A fine stout , fine stout indeed. Some interesting complexity , nice roast and body and a pleasant kick. I would have to say i like the nose on the beer a bit better than the taste. The bite at the end was just a little strong for my liking in a Sweet Stout."
"Finally able to taste a Bell's stout, picked this one up at Brawley's on my last trip. Poured a thick deep dark black with a big creamy brown head. Faded from the initial 2+ inches to a 1/2 inch lace that stayed till the bottom of the glass. Very nice light brown coating left down the sides. Smell was very sweet, first hints were of coffee, and licorice, followed by sugary sweetness, and rootbeer. As it warmed hints of rootbeer or cream soda were apparent, and suprisingly pleasent. Smells were not too strong, a little more pronounced and it would have been perfect. Taste was very rich and creamy, with a soda like consistency due to the light feel and high carbonation. Predominant taste was coffee and caramel, again with hints of some kind of sweet cola taste. Only complaint on this was it came off a bit thin. Other than that this was a fine brew, just a bit thin, but a good session beer."
"D- This goes down like water. Very refreshing- for a stout."
"Bell's does it again. This beer is a wonderful rendition of the style and shoots Bell's further up the charts of my favorite breweries. I'll be looking forward to changing it up and having Expedition Stout later tonight."
"I drank it blind. And after read the label and went, oh yeah. That was licorice in there. Nice job."
"Drinkability: Good stuff."
"I purchased this bottle while in Michigan, but I can now get this in Council Bluffs, Iowa. As with most of the Bell's beers I've had so far, this is one damn fine brew."
"Just had this on tap tonight at Flying Saucer and reviewed from notes. Poured a very opaque black with a thin darkish head that was mostly diminishing and left almost no lacing. Aroma was good and strong, abundant chocolate and black malt. This beer had a rich complex flavor; chocolate, molasses and just a hint of black licorice. There were subtle hops present as well, but you could tell they knew there job was just to balance. The beer had a decent carbonation and the alcohol was well hidden. Overall, this is a great stout, very enjoyable!"
"Drinkability: If it wasn't for the fact that it is above 6.0% ABV, I could drink this all day. A great beer after 18 holes or after a hard day at the office."
"Interestingly flavorful with that nice dry stout bitter finish. Really nice brew all around, worth bringing a sixer home."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Quite possibly the best feeling beer I've ever had in my mouth. A full heavy, creamy body is what I expect from a stout and here my expectations are surpassed. The beer is easy to drink with light carbonation this beer slides down easily. This is a beer I'll definitely buy again and in addition to that I'll be sure to check out more milk stouts as this is my first. It just beats the normal dry stout if you ask me."
"I found the mouthfeel smooth but a tad thin. This a stout I think I could have a session with so I rate the drinkability high. I would love to have a significant supply of this on hand to input in my everyday drinking cycle."
"Thanks for this one JohnnyM2002."
"Rigorously poured into a small snifter glass to stir up the beautiful thick, tan head, about two fingers worth. Looks black, almost entirely opaque, except it does look like a little bit of light can creep into the edges to make a dark burgundy. Produces a fantastic aroma of dark fruits, roasty bitter chocolate, light hops, and light alcohol. Mmm...smells great. Medium to medium light body with perfect palate smoothing carbonation. Creamy roasted malt and chocolate flavors hit the taste buds as a light tanic, stringency hits the roof of the mouth. I'm not a big fan of that tanic flavor, but this one is quite different to me. It reminds me of a porter more than a stout at this point. Bu I digress....so finally, to end the trip, we get a nice dry hop bitterness. Overall I think this is a great milk stout with a unique body and mouthfeel. However the tanic flavor keeps me from thinking that this is highly drinkable."
"I can not believe that people in Indiana of all places can enjoy what we in the only outpost of civilization in the entire midwest are forbidden. This is the finest stout made. Not quite as black as I would prefer, but if you dim the lights, you will not notice. Easily the most drinkable stout that I have enjoyed and perhaps what made me finally appreciate the genre. Give your guiness to a small child and awake to the good news, BELL'S BEER IS ALIVE!!!"
"An absolute pleasure to drink, it's been quite a while since I've come across a stout that I've enjoyed this much. It just all seems to work. It's not bombastic, it's not over the top, it's not overwhelming, just a great session-worthy stout after my heart. I'd reach for this again and again if it were available locally."
"Bells is fairly new to my area, and Ive been trying as many of their brews as I can get my hands on lately. I noticed that they pull of the coffee flavor really well in a lot of their stouts. In any case, like most of their beers, this one is well crafted and drinkable. Recommended."
"This beer pours a nice black with a creamy head that holds nicely and laces well. The smell is sweet with a small roasted characteristic and a hint of chocolate. The taste is very similar to the smell - very sweet and a small amount of roasted and chocolate characteristics. The mouthfeel is creamy as expected with smooth carbonation. Overall a good stout. I was expecting the liquorice flavor but it was not too strong."
"Found this one at a local store that has some pretty hard to find beers, at least in my area. Pours a dark, near pitch black. Decent brown head but nothing too special. Batch #7767. Smell is chocolate with some fruit undertones and a hint of the brewer's licorice they mention on the bottle. Taste was better than I expected after the initial impression I received. The milk and sweet side of this stout come through, especially when poured in a pint glass. Goes down well all things considered. Overall, I would consider this one to count on."
"($8.49 / 6-pack)"
"This is a very creamy stout with a very good balance of sweet and bitter. The smell is of toffee and cocoa. Taste is a good balance of hops and malt. Malt has a sweet roasted coffee flavor, reminescent of vanilla. Hops is definetly present, not too fruity. The mouthfeel is extreamly creamy and chocolaty, reminding my of nutella. I would rank this a fairly drinkable beer, one of the better from Bell's."
"One beer I wish I would have been drinking for many years now."
"The ""brewers licorice"" used dominates the taste as well as the scent as the coffee and roasted flavors again help carry the day. This is a dry stout with a good deal of carbonation and medium body that could use a slight upgrade in the thickness department. The flavor has many textures and makes this a very drinkable stout with a lot going for it."
"12 oz. bottle, brewed with brewer's licorice - batch 7715 (packaged 11/1/06). It pours into the chalice quite black with a medium-bubbled, yellow/khaki head that is thin, yet sustains, and leaves decent lacing. It smells of roasted/chocolate and burnt malts with dark fruits (figs?, plums?) and a little bit of a lactic character. The flavor is roasted and charred, almost acrid, with chocolate, coffee, green/piney hops, a medium to high bitterness from the hops and roasted malts, and licorice that makes a cameo after the beer warms a bit. The body is medium and smooth, with medium carbonation, and a long, roasted/coffee finish. Seems more like an American stout than a milk/sweet stout, but regardless, it is big, robust, and quite tasty."
"Bell's Kalamazoo Stout has a lot of wonderful qualities and very few if any low points. The pour is thick and creamy with very nice lacing and a coffee house aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and zesty without bitterness or sour. Each sip seems to have a life all its own and remains on the palate for a while. I am rarely disappointed by ANY of Bell's offerings and this is positively no exception. A great beer for a cold winter's night."
"-Oelergud"
"Black color and a firm tan head with excellent retention and heavy lacing to the bottom. The nose is primarily nutty, coffee, and roasted nuts. A lot of malt activity; hearty dark roasted espresso, roasted and charred malts, dry but not too bitter. Other balanced notes of some sour fruit and a strong hop addition that doesnt detract from the flavor. Buttery caramel notes notes develop half way down bringing together the hop and malt characters. The mouth is chewy with a nice creamy smoothness. The finish is relatively clean with slight lingering nutty roasted malt notes. Solid brew and one that I could drink a few of."
"I really can't say enough good things about this beer. I'd have to say this is one of my favorite stouts and I could easily drink Bell's out of this stuff given the opportunity."
"Taste is very smooth with a fine blend of roasted malts followed by a nice bitterness from the hops . This is a very fine example of the style and is very drinkable."
"Very satisfying. Hits the spot when you have a hankering for a stout and thats always a good thing."
"Another great stout, from one of the best stout brewers in the world. It's amazing how many stouts Bell's can brew, yet all of them are good and unique. Recommended."
"Good easy drinking sweet stout from Bell's."
"Mouthfeel is lighter than I expected. This is a drinkable stout which probably would not fill you up as quickly as others."
"As far as the taste of the beer itself, I found it very average at best for a stout. Had a fairly bitter finish with lingering flavors of coffee."
"The head pours a nice lacing that falls thin into a lacing that doesn't stick all to well. The taste is a little too bready and the coffee flavors are dominated by off flavors that aren't great. The mouthfeel is very nice and very smooth. Overall I would like something a little more fresher, but I will still try another for freshness sakes."
"Taste does have a burnt quality to it, in a good way though, the roasty toasty malts so strong, with notes of coffee espresso, chocolate, anise maybe?, and un-hoppily bitter hops. Mouth is a zinger, hefty carbonation prickling the tongue, yet still kind of smooth. This seems to me that this beer is to stouts as mean beastly bastard hop-bombs are to IPAs, and as with hop bombs, I like it."
"Dark as hell nice tan head, that sticks around for a little while. The smell is a roasty ride punctuated with fruity notes and anise-fennel-esque musings. The taste is a powerful sweet stout with plenty of coffee roastedness to even out the sweet, with the anise flavors noticeable and nice without being to ripe. The body is a little thinner than most stouts, but it fits well with the beer. It is a pleasent drinker but not an all day affair."
"Pours a five finger brown head that fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Black color. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Chocolate nose. Starts with a roasted/burnt chocolate flavor, some sweetness, nice stout. $1.89 for a 12oz bottle from Chalet Party Goshen, In."
"Very drinkable. Has enough interestinf flavors to keep you going, but its dry enough to not at all be cloying."
"Incredible appearance, smell, and taste in this one. They all speak of creamy smoothness with a rich coffee taste, and a toasted, burnt malt flavor. I am incredibly glad that this was made available in my area, and I recommend it to all who enjoy great craft beer if they get a chance to taste it. I personally recommend drinking this slightly colder than most stouts as it seems to enhance the smoothness and slightly mellow the burnt flavors. Regardless, an outstanding beer."
"Overall a delicious milk stout. Very smooth despite the burnt malts. Very sessionable."
"poured into tumbler at 50 degrees. Beer had a nice head that reeked of chocolate and smoked nuts. The tase was fantastic and was also rich with that nice malty rich coffee/toffee (but not sweet) chocolatey yummy taste. I really like this stout and will certainly purchase again."
"Drinkability and notes: I could picture having two of these, but its in no way a session beer. Regardless, its too much of a pleasure to drink to take away points because of this. Well, the reason to celebrate the arrival of Bell's to Washington D.C. is this Kalamazoo stout, top notch stuff."
"D.) If you have had trouble finding a good stout, milk/sweet stout, to drink, this is the one to start with to get into the type of brew. Excellent beer to have after a small meal, in my opinion."
"D: Very drinkable. Excellent example of the style."
"Still, a very solid stout from a solid brewery."
"The body is thick and creamy. Not too dry, not too sweet, not too roasty. Just good beer. Very drinkable. Like I said, I've had mixed results with this beer in the dozens of times I've tried it, but it just so happens that the bottle I decided to finally review is the best it has ever been. As much as I have loved this particular beer, I have much more consistent enjoyability with the porter. If only the stout were consistently this good (sometimes it tastes like beef jerky)."
"I found this to be drinkable but it tasted better with food than by itself"
"perfectly decent stout, certainly worth trying."
"I got a gal in Kalamazoo...well, I got a beer NAMED Kalamazoo, anyway. And it's a tasty creamy, sassy stout. Everything about it comes across as crisp, refreshingly, and nicely drinkable. So maybe Kalamazoo is a state of mind, and if so, my mind is now a happy place."
"I had higher expectations for this brew coming from Bell's. I've also had better milk stouts. Not bad, but not great."
"D: Another amazing brew from Bell's. Have they a bad beer? Not sure they do. Very drinkable bordering ons session like. Smooth and silky makes this offering a must if you can try it."
"A good stomach warmer. Easy going."
"coated the palate well - perfect level of carbonation. drinkable, but not something I would pound away constantly, since it just wasn't anything special to me."
"Batch 7571, via trade with akorsak. I did not even know I was recieving this beer, and I'm very happy to have tried it. Average looking stout without too much of a head, but the nose really stands out. The licorice root is apparent as it melts in with the sweet malts. Lactose sweetness and chocolate roastedness. Hops are not featured, as per the style, but the depth of the malts keeps things exciting. Very drinkable and refreshing. The carbonation is a bit dull but it fits the style just fine. Great for anytime of day, and it's also a very accessible stout for the uninitiated. Recommended. Cheers!"
"Marvelous. Chewy and sweet, then roasted... lingering... I love, oh how I love a beer that encourages you to slow down. Well done and highly recommended."
"EDIT: Just read some other reviews and I don't seem to be the only one who has found the smell off-putting. Could be a more extensive problem"
" Very nice, flavorful, well balanced and highly drinkable."
"The pour into my Fuller's nonic raises a sparse, dark brown cola-like head that dissipated very quickly into just a slight glass ring, over a virtually opaque body that lets just a little light through at the edges. Lacing is impressive considering the complete lack of head, but still pretty sudsy. The nose is very much filled with dark chocolate and roast, with definite espresso notes. Pretty straightforward. The flavor is quite bitter, but loaded with roast and coffee notes, with some very dark bready tones, as well. Leaves a pleasant lingering bitterness in the mouth. Bits of piney hoppiness, too. The mouth first struck me as being incredibly thick, but on second thought, it's only mildly thick. The carbonation seems to be quite high, but smooth. A hefty beer, but I now know I won't be hunting for this one."
"Solid creamy mouthfeel, damn tasty and damn drinkable, this is a session beer that'll leave you feeling nice and warm."
"-Overall - The astringency of this brew hurt the taste and drinkability scores big time. I had a hard time isolating the characteristics of this beer during my tasting experience. I'll probably pick up one more six pack just to make sure I’m not missing anything. Looking at the other reviews of this beer, I must be missing something. Oh well, cheers!"
"The K-Zoo Stout when poured from the bottle is extremely dark. Pitch Black. Medium head. K-Zoo smells of malts mixed with coffee. As stouts go, K-Zoo is a pretty smooth one. Not too bitty, but this beer is no slouch. Has a hint of malts mixed with coffee. Pretty easy to drink and tastes great. adding to an already decent line of bell's beers."
"The drinkability is also good. This is quite a nice brew, Prosit, MK"
"Very drinkable. Smooth, delicious, and nothing here that slows down the enjoyment. I wouldn't say it's light, but it's not thick at all."
"The drinkability is great. All nighter, everyday."
"Overall, a very comfortable easy drinking, flowing, tasty stout, that could use some work on the aroma."
"All in all this is quite the stout and I actually prefer this slightly over it's also excellent big brother Expedition Stout"
"This is about as balanced a sweet stout as I've yet encountered. It'd be a stretch to drink more than one at a sitting, but as a regular, especially in the winter months, it would be wonderful. Wish I could get this stuff here."
"These drink great after dinner. Bells' just keeps giving me more and more reasons to be happy I moved to the Midwest."
"This may be my 50th bottle of Kalamazoo Stout, but this is the first time I have sat down to review it formally. Inky dark brown to almost black, as always, with a thick, yet soft looking, cocoa brown head. Nose is chocolate powder, dark-roasted coffee, a little molasses, a hint of tobacco and vanilla, and an herbal hop edge. Toasted, nutty bitterness up front. Slightly numbing herbal hops in the background, with sweetening dark chocolate and earthy peat. Sugary mocha, with extra shots of espresso and caramel try to nullify the roasted herbal bitterness. Finish is long and chocolatey. Full-body for the strength, with a spritzy, bottle-conditioned feel. Excellent, as always. Heres to the next 50!"
"This is my 400th review. Just absolutely delicious. Poured into a pint glass, a black color, nice carbonation, nice creamy tan head, some lacing afterwards. Scents of sweet roasted malts, and toffee/chocolate. The taste is a creamy sweet roasted malt, with a nice toffee finish. Medium body, slightly carbonated feel on the tongue. Very drinkable, glad to had a chance to checkout this fabulous brew."
"D: Very drinkable. I purchased the mixed case to try this and I am not disappointed."
"D- Very good stout. One of my favorite stouts I have tried. Not to strong of flavors. Think it is well balanced."
"The mouth is medium-bodied and considerably complex. It's very drinkable and slightly sweet, yet still has some bite on the finish. It's not my favorite of the Bell's Stout family, yet it still a damn fine brew"
"D - actually not too shabby. the mellow taste is nice and that little bite keeps it interesting. i would drink this beer again"
"Drink: a great flipping beer, a must try. Top notch baby!"
"Overall, an excellent stout! It's up there with Yeti as my favorite. Even at a year old, this is excellent. I wish I could get this out in CO...it and Two-Hearted would be regulars in my fridge."
"I poured this 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug and took in its dark almost balck color and its dart tan head. I smelled and tasted sweet of coffee and dark hops. Its mouthfeel is full and well carbonated and easy to drink. I really like this stout, it is recommended."
"d= a wonderful stout, creamy & enjoyable."
"Pours black and slightly thick. grat head retention nice lacing and the head is light brown in color. rich dark coffee smells, along with rich malts, and baking chocolate. Great tasting stout; bitersweet chocolate and roasted malt flavors relaly make this a good stout. on a cold winter day near a fire place you could really warm up with a few of these."
"D - I drank this after dinner (well, in place of dinner.. ;-)) and it fared very well for a cool-weather, dessert beer. I drank this to commemorate the 1-year anniversary of my Jeep (running out of excuses..)."
"Cheers!"
"Notes/Drinkability: This is one fine stout. Richly dark in appearance with a subtle underlying sweetness. Full of bittersweet chocolate and dark roast coffee makes for a great combination. Alcohol never shows its head at 6.5%. Highly drinkable, I could see sitting down and putting these back all night. My first beer from Bell's and I'm very impressed. Definitely a must buy and one that I will try and aquire again. Glad I have 10 more left. Highly recommended."
"All in all, Bells kicks major beerass.~"
"This is a tasty stout, just seems kinda' low on the creaminess and sweetness factors, with the creaminess (for me) being an especially nice characteristic for this style."
"Overall, Kalamazoo is a good beer, heck I drank a six and enjoyed the flavorful roasted elements and the small hint of alcohol it left on my tongue."
"The beer is very enjoyable, but I think I would tire from the roasted bitterness after a couple of these. It's a nice example of a sweet stout."
"355 ml bottle. Consumed on 9-1-06 packaged on 6-15 (info available from website actually). No head, with thin lacing. Faint aroma. Very opaqe deep dark amber (no transmittance). EXCELLENT taste! No conditioning sting, this is bottle conditioned so ita a REAL ALE. Bitter at start, malt and chocolate in middle, finish is sweet black licorice. Medium mouth feel. Suprising how high the alcohol content is actually. Somewhat filling. Excellently crafted beer!"
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks BeerBeing!"
"Perfect big black, creamy head. I don't think it could be any more black. Great roasted coffee and chocolate. Nothing atypical with respect to sweet Stouts. Flavor was perfect. No bite or alcohol taste. Very, very smooth. This got even better as it warmed up. I wish more brewers would brew this type of stout."
"Poured this beer out into a pint glass, beer is dark as night with a nice two finger head that quickly dies down to a slim rim with good lacing. The smell is of roasted and chocolate malts; not overly strong but pleasing. The taste is definitely of deep roasted malt but it is balanced nicely which makes for a drinkable beer. The mouthfeel is creamy and well bodied. Overall, I think this is a very good beer, and would recommend trying it."
"Poured opaque black with a small tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Chocolate, roated malt, and light caramel in the aroma. Bakers chocolate, light smoke, roasted and toffee malts in the taste. This is a solid, lower gravity stout that can be sessioned as opposed to the Expedition."
"Pours a dark black liquid with a light brown/cream color head. Smell is weak but some roasted like smell. Taste is a sweet coffee with a somewhat metallic finish. Mouthfeel is exactly what I want in a sweet stout smooth with almost no carbonation. Drinkability would be high on a fall or winter day but this being mid summer I'll limit myself to two tonight."
"An incredibly drinkable brew considering it's richness and alcohol content. The bittering hops cleanse the sugars from this big bad beer."
"It's ard to describe something this black. But it's topped with a rather thick, super sticky tan head that lasts for a long time. The aroma is of roasted barley. Taste is not as dry as I would have expected given the dry nose. It's dry, but still has a bit of sweetness at the end. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy. Nice carbonation. It's a slow-drinking beer, but not because of the alcohol content. There's a lot of beer in this beer!"
"Retains a good head of foam. Sweet brown sugar and chocolate malt in the nose. Ahh...that supreme roast flavor takes me back to the last Kalamazoo Stout I had almost a year ago. It builds up on the palate. Appropriately bitter with a hint of chicory or coffee in the aftertaste. Still vibrant and packs a punch after 1-1/2 years in the cellar."
"An excellent stout that i will visit again, after visiting with some of his brothers. Rye up next."
"D: Very enjoyable stout. Very good flavor. Another awesome beer recieved in trade with nlmartin."
"Dark black appearance with brown head, creamy on top and fizzy on the sides. Diminishes but lasts throughout the beer. Strong roasted flavor with average to long aftertaste. Smooth from beginning to end. This is a high quality, very drinkable stout and my choice over the expedition by Bells, which has too much of an alcohol bite for my taste."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark, dark brown with some reddish tints when held up to the light. There's also about an inch creamy tan head, and a lot of lacing remains on the glass. It smells like roasted malt, semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and some coffee. It tastes like dark chocolate and a bit of coffee, and there's a good roasted flavor too. The start is a little bitter, then the sweetness hits and then finishes bitter again with a lingering bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a good body to it. The Kalamazoo Stout is a very good beer, I'd definitely buy more of this in the future."
"Pours jet black, nearly opaque except for thin dark mahogany highlights. The brown sugar colored head is dense and creamy and reaches one and a half fingers in hieght. Shows good retention, and the epitome of spotty lacing. Roasted barley nose, with coffee notes, faint black patent and molasses. First sip is sweet with dark roasted malts and blackstrap, some dark chocolate, and bitter black patent. Semi-drying aftertaste, a tame hop bitterness paired with coffee and chocolate. Low-medium carbonation with a full body- this is less dry than expected and more syrupy; which I found quite agreeable. Finish is akin to the aftertaste with plenty of complex residual sweetness balancing the roasted flavor and mild hop bitterness. The drinkability would score better as an export stout, but will please fans of Russian Imperial Stout. An excellent bargain at $7-$8 a six-pack."
"Medium bodied with little carbonation. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Very easy drinking despite the bitterness. Very smooth and balanced."
"drinkability is good. it feels like a big beer even though it comes in at 6.5%, so the lower alcohol makes it more drinkable but the mouthfeel lowers it some. the highly charred flavour lingers long after finishing the glass, which also serves to lower the drinkability. overall it's ok."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer. A little thick to have more than just a couple though. A good sipping beer."
"D - Very smooth and easy to drink with a nice finish."
"This is a delicious drinkable meal in a bottle."
"Poured a deep brown with a thick head. The smell score is low just due to a soured smell. The taste is good. It has a oatmeal taste. The mouthfeel is smooth. This is a heavy bodied beer. Very filling. A meal in a bottle. A good beer for the style."
"Drinkability: Not too bad one of the better stouts I have had. Like I said it could be alittle over powering if your drink a few in a short period of time. But all in all a very nice stout."
"I have GOT to get me some more of this. I mean, this is great. The malt magicians at Bell's have done another magnificent job."
"Drinkability- Glad my parents grabbed me 2 bottles when they were in Michigan, sadly I cant find this stuff locally but man is it good. It would be a regular in my mixed 6 packs if I could find it locally."
"Thanks to thefatkid13 for the trade. Pours a deep, dark black with garnet highlights, topped by an inch of creamy brown head that leaves some nice lacing. Aroma of coffee grounds, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and some fruity hops. Palate is rich, sweet malt, milk sugar, dark chocolate, and just a touch of bittering from the hops. Body is rich and velvety, damn near perfect. An excellent milk stout, and one that I wish I'd asked for more of in my trade."
"Pours out black with a nice tan head with very good retention. Smell is very complex, reminds me of Dark Lord, full of coffee, chocolate, and different dark fruits, very very good. Taste is awesome as well. Starts out deceiving, but then all of a sudden it hits you with an onslaught of taste. Beginning is green, then roasty, changing quickly into cherries, plums, other dark fruits, then adds some chocolate and coffee flavors to finish it off. If it didn't start off a little weak with the green flavor it would be an easy 5 for taste. Medium carbonation, medium to full bodied, slick on the tongue. If the very beginning of the taste was eliminated this would just be beyond a great beer, the green flavor isn't bad, but doesn't seem to fit with the rest of this beer. Seriously get this if you see it. Highly recommended. Oh, and criticize if you want, this reminds me of a baby Dark Lord, I love it."
"This beer looks great, it's dark as crude oil, just barely can see a hint of red and brown around edges. The head is a centimeter or so tall, but is a nice caramel/toffee color, and comes back quickly if you swirl your glass, I really liked the head of this beer. The smell is very roasted but sweet, with coffee and chocolate malts, but there are clear scents of dark, tart fruit as well. There are a lot of dark, tart fruit flavors in the beer as well, cherry and plum, but there is alway a strong noticeable roasted flavor that is bitter but not too. This should be a really chewy beer, it's so sweet and thick, but there is a good amount of carbonation as well that I thought gave this beer a great mouthfeel for a stout. This is a pretty heavy beer, average drinkability for a good stout. Bell's just plain knows how to make stouts."
"medium feel with a low-medium carbonation. sugary coffee, roasted bitterness and alcohol dominate the flavors; finish is bitter coffee and a touch of hoppiness. lighter in feel than many other stouts, but with a robust flavor."
"Close to black with deep brown hues. Small brown head settles to a quarter inch. Smokey as a Siberian chimney after a hard winter. Aroma of creosote, heavily roasted barley, coffee, roasted nuts. Taste is dominated by huge smoky roastedness. Slightly sweet with a thick, rich body. Low carbonation leads to easy drinking. I remember it being much better on tap."
"Overall, I don't know if this is one I could sit and drink all night, but it is one of the better well-rounded, blanced brews I've had recently. I could easily drink another bottle."
"Drinkability- One of the most drinkable stouts ever. I was very pleasantly surprised at this one."
"Drinkability - this goes down great, and is excellent. Rich and hearty and satisfying. I could session this any time, but it may be too hearty for some."
"Very dark brown, almost black, with a medium, tan, pillowy head that slowly diminishes to lingering chunks. Lots of lacing all the way down. The aroma is fairly typical for a stout with the usual roasted malt characteristics. Coffee, chocolate, caramel and very light smoke. Also some moderate yeast and dark fruit. The taste is a little on the sweet side at first with the roasted malts again taking center-stage. On the finish it turns lightly bit, but theres a sourness in the there as well that I wasnt expecting and didnt really enjoy. It has a medium-full body, creamy texture and soft carbonation. Not bad, but nothing impressive, especially coming from Bells."
"I've had this on tap and from the bottle and there's little to no difference. This beer was pitch black with a nice tan head. It smelled heavily of roasted malts with a bit of chocolate in the back ground. Taste is similar with a very dry, bitter bite to it. Appears to have a very clean yeast strain and the malts almost taste like you're chewing on the grains. I found it nice and interesting at first, but the dryness got to me after a couple bottles."
"Drinkability - I am glad I bought a sixer of this, this is an excellent beer!"
"As far as the smokier stouts go, this ones top notch. Its charred, but still smooth and clean with a superb silky mouth feel."
"Poured from a 12oz'er into a standard pint glass. Appears almost opaque black with a massive, chocoate-colored head. Nose is sweet malt, oatmeal, and a bit of baker's chocolate. Palate is of roasted malt, oats, nuts, and espresso. Very rich. Mouthfeel is medium, with light carbonation. Finishes slightly drier than I would have thought for the style it's labeled under, but that's not a complaint. Good hop bitterness lingers here ... This is a very good stout, though I would hesitate to call it a milk stout. Really top-notch as is most of what Bell's offers. May I have another?"
"Smooth across the tongue, lightly carbonated, with a medium body - leaning to the full side - though I expected a chewier brew. A nice, alcohol-infused oak & smoke aftertaste. This is a really good beer. It went great with the homemade chocolate chip cookies I finished it off with. :-)"
"D - Im hoping I can get some of this fresh someday. I bet it is a million times better."
"Pours a strong black coffee color with a medium tan cap with orange hues. A one finger cap quickly dissipates to lacings on top. Aroma is chocoloate, coffee, orange, and fusal hops. Flavor is maltose malt, toffee, chocolate, coffee, orange, and roasted barley. Mild citrus and fusal hops in background. Very good beer with lots of toasty roasted barley. Good blend of sweetness, hops, and burnt notes. Medium carbonation and medium body."
"This one is pretty good. The roasted malt and slightly overcarbonated body makes it a bit uneasy to swallow easily but it doesn't take away from the great characteristics found in this brew."
"I could drink this stout all night long. I didn't find it tough to drink after the first half of the glass as some ""sweet/milk"" stouts are. Very impressive all around."
"D: Very nice stout, very nice. A low(er) alcohol content allows this beer to be enjoyable and not over the top. Another good stout from Bells."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer for being a darker beer. I've drank a 6-pack of this on a few occasions with out a problem...or regret."
"Poured from a bottle into a Tulip glass. Beer pours a very dark, deep brown color, nearing black. Not much head or lacing. Smells of yeast and malty sweetness. Taste is very good. Bready, with subtle fruit tones and a hop profile that is perfect. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Perfect amount of carbonation and such a smooth beer going down. Medium and nice. I'm thinking this must be a standard thing with Bell's stouts. Expedition is the only other stout I can recall feeling this good in my mouth. Drinkability is also very good. Too bad I can't get it in California."
"Overall: Ok, the smell seems like the odd man out for this beer. Everything else is so perfect that the aroma pales in comparison. Even at that, the aroma is still good. All I can say is: if you don't drink this beer, I'll pick up the slack.."
"D - Refreshing stout with a lower ABV (which is not noticeable). Could definitely be a fallback beer if I wanted something familiar and heavy."
"A nice and solid beer. I'm imagining that more complexity may show up on cask, but I'm not sure if I'll ever experience that."
"Two fingered brown sugar headover a black brew. Sharp, espresso & dark bittersweet chocolate aroma. Double crack - roasted coffee, roasted barley and balanced hop bitterness in flavor. Very strong chocolate flavor. Full bodied, viscous mouthfeel. Finishes w/ a lingering enjoyable hop and roasted unmalted barley bitterness almost an imperial stout. Put this together with my first beer at Bell's Ecclectic Cafe and I was in heaven"
"Bell's stouts rock!"
"Bottom line: This is quite the different stout and one I favour...I recommend it."
"drinkability is high, a very pleasant beer overall. a little expensive in my opinion."
"Nice black color with a big foamy dark tan head. A fairly heavy pour created huge lumpy head. The head falls to a fairly thick film that leaves some nice clumpy lacing. Hints of expresso, coffee, chocolate and roasted malt. The smell isn't as strong as i expected. Taste does come through with more punch than the smell. Again coffee, chocolate and roasted malt. Slight bitter chocolate aftertaste but very minimal. Mouthfeel is very smooth, almost a milk like smoothness. Overall a very drinkable beer. Not world class but certainly very good."
"D - A solid easy drinking stout. Nothing jumps out and grabs you about this beer but there are not really any flaws either. A great session beer to have on hand when you are looking for a nice stout."
"I rather enjoyed this beer it is a very high quality milk stout."
"the mouthfeel is a little thick but nothing you would not expect from a milk stout, fills the mouth and coats the inside."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into an Imperial pint glass. A very nice tan head sits on top of a near black body leaving fair lace on the sides of the glass. Dark coffee and roasted malts dominate the nose. Acrid and astringent, dark malts dominate the initial swallow. I can't find any lactic/milk sweetness. Full bodied and somewhat rich but I can't get around the roasted malt that sticks around to the end. Not a bad beer but not one that I would rank up near the top end either."
"poured jet black with a beautiful thick brown 1in head that left some nice lacing. The aroma isn't too potent but whats there is nice. Subtle chococlate with mild roasted malts. When i take the first sip what immediatley comes to mind is frozen coffee drink maybe a coolata or something. Nice and sweet with a nice balance of a little bit of hops along with the malts. Mouthfeel is slightly thicker than medium body. Drinkablility is high as this one is very smooth and enjoyable."
"Solid."
"Review #400"
"The sweetness of this beer might be a bit too much for some, but I like it and it is a sweet stout afterall. That being said the k-zoo stout is very well balanced and has an exceptional amount of complexity. This is a mainstay around our house."
"Black beer with brown edges and a dark tan stand of head composed of fine bubbles. Plenty of thick lace. Rich, malty, roasted aroma with some coffee and licorice character. Moderate bitterness that seems to be from both hops and dark grains plays nicely with the roasty malt sweetness that lingers into the finish. There's some chocolate, as well as leafy hops that contribute a bit of citrus. Light, well-integrated carbonation and a medium body produce a silky, creamy texture. A bit drying in the finish. An excellent beer with a big, roasty flavour. I'll definitely pick this one up again."
"Poured into a pint glass and was impressed with the look of this beer. dark, reddish brown color with a 1in. caramel colored head. head is creamy on top supported by large bubbles. Fantastic odor. like i expect stouts to smell. closest description i can come up with is cold, alcoholic chocolate chip cookies. Smotoh, coffee/chocolate flavors. bitter citrus-like hop taste on back of tongue. bitter roasted malt finish. tangy quality that is midly odd. mouthfeel is smooth going in. prickly going down. nice and thick. Great finish lingers and leaves me wanting more. this is a great stout."
"Super black and opaque with a tan/brown head. Roasty nose, exceedingly dry roasted flavor. Lick smackingly dry. Smooth, slightly oily, again, so dry as to be almost tart. A very drinkable stout, but not overwhelming. From a batch in the 6700s, which would put it around a year old."
"Da wonderful stout; I d have maybe one more due to the thickness."
"Received a bottle from CRJMellor as part of SS '05. The batch ID# 7061 printed on the reverse lable indicates a bottling date of (not found in database)."
"Pours nearly black with a smallish tan head. The smell was not very pronounced, mainly bitter roasted malts and a bit of hops. The taste however was quite good, starting with sharp roasted coffee flavors and decent herbal hops, then with sweeter chocolate/toffee notes, finishing with some more bitter hop . Somewhat complex and decently rich. Mouthfeel is very well balanced with good carbonation and very slightly oily finish. High drinkabiliy and decent value."
"With that being said, you could put this up against the Brooklyn Chocolate stout or the Rogue's and it would hold it's own. If you are a stout lover then please give this a try, just don't expect greatness.!"
"Medium to full bodied, could throw back a couple. Not bad, not groundbreaking, but pretty good on tap."
"Strong musty aroma of roasted malt and dark chocolate. The flavors are quite robust for a single stout. Too many stouts fall on the thin side, and the rest of the brew falls apart, but this one is thick and creamy enough to help the rest of it out. The little brother to Expedition, this brew is very rich and flavorful, and a must-try if you haven't been able to sample it yet."
"Overall, the more I think about it, the less my ""taste"" description does it justice. This beer is not especially complex, it's no imperial stout, but the balance of roast, chocolate, and woody flavors is sublime. Expedition may be the showpiece of Bell's stouts, but this one's definitely the bread and butter - I could drink Kalamazoo stout all night long."
" A pretty good stout."
" Rich, creamy and robust, an exceptional sipping stout  but to me, more along the lines of an export stout versus milk."
"The beer is smooth with a mild body. Very nice drinkability with a easy finish. The acidic aftertaste keeps the astringency down but still lets it come out. Overall a great stout but would like a bit cleaner fermentation."
"Drinkability- Even a stort that reimnds of motor oil deserves to take another glass to the lips."
"Overall: A nice stout, somewhat sweet but not cloying, with a big roasted chocolate flavor. One that I'll pick up again; Bell's never fails to impress."
"Initial mouth feel is full, but finishes more thin. Highly drinkable. The standard Bell's stout. Good and easy to find in Michigan."
"Chocolatey in taste and a bit chalky on the mouthfeel. Excellent flavor. Dry and smooth... but seemingly a tad thin. Still, the roasted, malty, chocolatey flavor wins over."
"As it warms the coffee moves to the forefront. The lacing is still marking the starting line, while I hit the finish line."
"Still, an amazing 'everyday' stout that is easy to forget in the Midwest with so many other good Bell's stouts."
"Nice stout for sipping but the sourness might be a bit too much after a while."
"First Bell's Stout I've had the pleasure of trying, on tap at Klinger's in Hanover PA. Served in a pint glass, this beer is absolutely pitch black, no light at all coming through, a finger of beige head, nice retention and solid lacing. Smell isn't as strong as expected, a light roasted malt and some slight espresso. Taste is excellent, a nice roasted malt, cocoa, smooth milk chocolate, and a nice finish with some slight hops and a bitter lingering roast. Excellent balance between the sweet lactose and the bitter roast. Despite the thick chewey mouthfeel, I found myself downing this rather quickly. This is an amazing stout, I wish I could drink this more often."
"Mouthfeel is big and viscous, it fills the mouth and definetly has a nice chewiness. However at the same time it is incredibly drinkable and I find my glass emptying rather quickly. A great stout overall, from a brewery that seems to never miss with the style. Put the words Bell's and stout together on a brown bottle and you'll undoubtedly see a smile on my face. Well worth seeking out if you're a fan of the style."
"Dark brown in color with Mahogany highlights. This beer poured from the bottle and was topped by a bubbly tan colored head that leaves an intricate lace on the side of the glass as it settles. The aroma is more subtle than the Expedition Stout. Hints of roast malt, espresso, and just a touch of chocolate come across immediately. Just a touch of citrus on the back end. The flavor is again more subtle than the Expedition. Layers of chocolate, espresso, just a bit of walnut. Caramel in the finish. Nice touch of bitterness lingers as I contemplate the rich, full mouth feel. Nice beer, much more approachable than the Expedition."
"Heavy, dark roasted coffee flavor reminds me of starbucks' mocha-chip ice cream. A little dextrinous and moderately chewy. While it has an initial hit of sourness, almost like an old-school porter, it finishes smooth with a kick of roasted malt bitterness. Somewhat out of balance, but still quite good and quite intriguing. Overall easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is not a terrible beer I am just not impressed. The sweetness is not balanced by any other taste factors."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium brown color head with great retention. Aroma of roasted malt with faint chocolate in the back. Taste is very creamy-like with a nice dose of chocolate. Not a whole lot of hops but I think this is for the best. Very well balance beer."
"A fairly straight-forward beer. Coffee flavors are most predominant, so if that's what you look for in a sweet stout, this is a great one. Otherwise, this is solid Bell's offering."
"Nearly pitch black brew. Some brown around the edges. Medium brown head was small and fleeting. As expected this is a sweet smelling stout. Comes across with a bit of milk chocolate and some caramel maltiness. The slightest bit of charring in the background. This has a very pleasing flavor which isn't overdone at all. Again, slightly sweet to start. Some raisin, plum fruitiness. This fades to a sweet chocolate, toffee flavor, and finishes with a touch of bitterness from some faintly floral hops and dark roasted malts. Nice and crisp mouthfeel makes this one refreshing. Still has an oilyness to it as well. Drinkability is superb. A very well crafted beer."
"drinkability: incredible"
"This one is black, and I mean BLACK. No light or any other color shines through when held up to the light. There is a somewhat small, yet brilliant dark brown colored head. Maybe the darkest colored foam I've seen on a beer. The smells are strong of sweet roasted malts and maybe a hint of chocolate. Quite sweet scents. The taste is gordgeous. Quite possibly the perfect balance of roasted malts and hops with a nearly citrusy-sweet finish. Wonderful tasting beer. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and nice. The carbonation is present, which I was hoping for. The drinkability is nice as well. Its a sipper, but you should'nt get bored with it. Definitly worth a try if you find it on the shelf."
"As far as drinkability goes, this beer is not the best. The flavor isnt engaging enough for me to want another, and I have a feeling that the thickness of this beer would get to me after a while."
"Starring Bell's Kalamazoo Stout as...Blacula! Big, rocky, determined chocolate-colored head--about as good as a stout can look. Smells fairly caramelly and lactose-sweet, but not really strongly of anything. Tastes strongly of toffee, a roasted, buttery sweetness, with a little hint of rotten prunes and raisins underneath. Yeah, diacetyl+roasted+caramel=toffee. Mouthfeel is nice and full, creamy. Overall, easy to drink, but not especially interesting. The Java Stout is better."
"Again, the roasted notes are strong in the taste. The cocoa is there again but coffee comes through with a balancing dose of dry hops. Solid. I would like a fuller mouth, but the drinkability doesn't suffer."
"Another great beer from the folks at Kalamazoo Brewing Company. This was my first second stout and I think that it is delicious. This will definitely be in my fridge during the winter months. Keep up the great work Kalamazoo Brewing!!!!"
"Pours black in color with creamy brown head that gave way to good amount of lacing. Intensive roasted malt, along with carmael, chocolate, coffee are the dominant flavors. Somewhat bitter which I liked. If you like stouts you will not find to many any better than this one."
"This is one great stout that I will not get the chance to sample much since I'm down here in North Carolina. Great mix of chocolate, caramel, and coffee smell and taste. Beautiful head and lacing. Smooth and milky-easy to finish and ask for more. Not too overwhelming, could really enjoy in the winter months."
"A smoky flavor is complemented by the malts which came through as the dominant flavor. There was also a sweet aftertaste left in my mouth, so I would assume this beer is a sweet stout. Mouthfeel for this beer can be described as confident. Not brash or cocky nor weak or feeble. The beer lets you know it is there, in your mouth, but it doesn't overwhelm your senses. As the I drank more of the beer, and the temperature increased the flavors seemed to become stronger and bolder, as one would expect. This, however did not affect the drinkability at all, as it went down smooth for the entire twelve ounces. I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a good regional stout in the area."
"overall: tastes wonderful and the aroma is to die for! very balanced milk stout, but the roasted flavors and sweet malts take charge. many thanks to skyhand for this brew!"
"Wow. This one is really amazing. Poured out to a really nice black color. Really, it was totally black, couldn't see through it.Perfect carbonation and an nice 2 inch head ( I poured it with the intent of creating a large head). Some minor lace was noted around the glass. Aromas of sweet cream and earth are present, albeit very light. The flavor is phenominal; smooth cocoa and chocolate, caramel, coffee bean, raw sugar, and an earthy roasted taste. Very well balanced. Not much of an aftertaste, but this brew went down with a very creamy mouthfeel, making the glass quite hard to put down. Finished like on a roasted nutty note. This is a top beer for me, I just wish I had bought more. Highly Recommended for all BA's."
"12 oz bottle enjoyed at Waldo Pizza in KC,MO. Espresso, dark chocolate, and some hop aroma. Pitch black with a brown head. Some lace. Looks pretty think. Very sweet. Reminds me of like chewing on a coffee bean. Bitter enough to balance sweetness. Quite full bodied an silky smooth."
"Taste is smooth and creamy- no, mouthfeel is creamy. Nevertheless, you get this nice roastybitterness in the aftertaste and very much a bit of that coffee/chocolate lingering. Tastes upfront are a bit of sourness, a bit of sweetness and this really nice creaminess, almost like a round feeling. Mouthfeel is good, bonus points for spilling over onto taste. Although this is a great beer, I'm not sure I could session on this one. Another excellent Bell's overall."
"Pours pitch black with a very small brown head that dissipates quickly leaving a small ring of foam around the edges that sticks to the glass. Smells fantastic - dark chocolate, caramel, and fruit. Taste is dominated by the roasted malt. There are definitely some chocolate, molasses, espresso flavors lurking here too. They aren't quite as noticable as the wonderful aroma would suggest but they do emerge as the brew warms. Very tastey but maybe slightly off balance - not quite as delicious as it's aroma would suggest. It's medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation and definitely not a chore to drink."
"Because of the ridiculously hot and humid weather here lately, I've been in the mood for lighter bodied beers. But, the temps have cooled down for a few days and I need to experience a good, solid stout. This one pours as black as midnight with a small dark head, but poor retention. Nice roasted nut aroma. Slight hops can be detected upon tasting, but nothing too hoppy, this was all about the malts. Black coffee overwhelmed the taste. Bitter aftertaste hurt the mouthfeel a bit, as well as the drinkability."
"Another impressive stout by Bell's. This has a similar flavor, aromatic, and visual profile as the Expedition Stout--Just kicked down a notch. This is impressive with it's balance of roasted, chocolate, caramel, and barley malts. Hopped only for balance. Slight tartness. Creamy with sight bittering; no astringency or graininess. Present alcohol, but never dominates. Finishes slightly bitter with nice linger period."
"All in all an okay stout but not quite what I had expected. While it had some sweet components and a moderately smooth body I was surprised to read this is a milk stout. A drinkable stout but not what I would have called 'outstanding'"
"Black in colour with a fair amount of carbonation and a very dark head. The aromas are generally sweet and malty, with notes of milk chocolate and a bit of plum. The flavors are quite roasty, and suggest coffee, molasses, caramel, and a bit more chocolate. I could also detect a bit of hop flavor as well, but most of the bitterness comes from the roasted malts. Massive body to this one too"
"D- This milk stout has nice character but it is missing some depth that would really add to its flavor. I would like to see some more creaminess in the mouthfeel. Nice stout non the less."
"Pours jet black with some sediment. Nice creamy tall head which stays for a while. Smells lightly malty sweet, with some bittersweet coffe/chocolate and also rather fruity. Taste, surprisingly reminded me of bittersweet apple cider, maybe some grapes. Not nearly as ""roasty"" as the back of the bottle might have implied. Quite interesting. Mouthfeel was thinish, but smooth. Quite drinkable, but not outstanding. Java Stout just blows this out of the water. Not bad by any means, a decent fruity, sweet stout and a solid offering from Bell's which has yet to disappoint."
"Tastes are not overly defined. Rather laid back and utterly drinkable. Fairly thick body makes the K-Zoo forceful, yet not bullying. This is fine, but it is not going to make headlines. I love stouts of imperial stature. I cannot remove them from my mind as I review this beer. As a common stout this one will do. I would prefer something more over the top though. Might as well go BIG."
"Another great beer from Bell's."
"Pours a motor oil black with a small dark tan head. Smells of chocolate, cream, and toffee. Taste is sweet and creamy. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, and smooth. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer. It is flavorful but not overpowering in the way most stouts can be."
"A different kind of drinkability."
"Medium body, though it isn't really a session beer, best enjoyed a couple at a time."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a killer stout. One of the better offerings from Bell's. I like this much more than their double cream stout. This one offers more complexity and richness, while still being highly drinkable. Good stuff!!"
"Thanks to NeroFiddled for the trade, the beer pours an opaque black with a creamy tan head that retains well and leaves nice lacing on the glass. The smell is big coffe aroma (expresso or something strong), chocolate, cream and a roasted background, a very nice and complex aroma. The taste is very similar to the expedition but toned down alot (personally I thought the expedition was slighly overwhelming) which is definaetly a good thing because i can pick up the flavors more easily. The taste begins with a big coffee note which is followed by flavors of lightly sweetened dark chocolate, cream, a sweet molasses like flavor and a slightly bitter roasted malt and hops finish. Really a well executed stout, kind of like a mini expedition (or maybe the expedition stout is the giant kalamazoo stout) but really tasty, and complex enough to satisfy even the biggest beer snob, lightly sweet but the finish is bitter to balance the brew quite well. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy (appropriate for the style) and the drinkability if pretty high."
"Drinkability: Goes down very easy. Definitely could session if one were so inclined."
"Bottle. Deep dark brown, big tan head, bordering on brown. Decent lacing. Nice roasty coffee aroma, with hints of chocolate and lots of roasty grains. Nice full bodied roasty flavor. Hints of coffee and sweet dark chocolate. Roasty bitterness lingers on the palate. This is exceingly drinkable for a stout lover. Rich and satisfying. I think the best of the style."
"Creamy smooth, very drinkable."
"Overall this stout can be many things to different palates. What I mean is, this stout really 'breathes'. The flavors have enough 'space' between them that leave room for many interpretations. I love it for it's subtleties - soft, silky, fluffy and a tad dry - but never chalky. Not sweet but very creamy. Roasted malts but not burnt or coffeeish. Probably the perfect balance between a milk and dry stout - a marriage of the two styles, if you will. I most definitely will be trying this throughout the year to experience more nuances I might detect. A true flagship from Bell's."
"Pours opaque black with a khaki colored head. Milk chocolatey aroma mixed coffee and roastedness. Very creamy bittersweet chocolately taste, with plenty of roasted character. Some hops bite out admist the huge malty smoothness. Finish is roasted dry, with a lingering coffee like aftertaste. Very pleasant to sip and admire the finish. Definitely another good stout from Bell's, who I have come to respect as talented in the stout field."
"Drinkability- One of the best stouts I have had. Creeping fairly close to Stone IRS. Wish I had easy access to these. I've been damn lucky with stouts and porters as of recent."
"Pours out thick and dark with a dark brown head. Sweet malty aroma with some chocolate. The aroma is good, but not strong enough. The flavor is very strong, with a big malty flavor up front, followed by chocolate and a solid roasted flavor. Full mouthfeel, mikshake like in the consistency and the sweet flavor. Highly drinkable too. This is a very nice beer."
"I notice my review is higher than many of the others. Maybe being in Michigan I have the chance to get this beer a lot fresher than BAs out of state."
"Mouthfeel is luch, creamy, and luxurious. Carbonation is very light, which suits this style just fine. Delicious in every respect. More please."
"Slàinte!"
"Pours inky black with a nice mocha colored head and decent lacing. The nose is smoky and bittersweet. Tastes much like the nose: smoky roasted malts, sweet sugar, bittersweet chocolate, and a slightly salty, hoppy balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. The perfect balance between bitterness and cloying sweetness. Best stout I've had in a while."
"Black in hue, it is damn dark. When backlit there is a slight dark brown highlight around the edges. The color is beyond ideal. The head was brunette in color; the tightly compacted bubbles formed a head of two fingers in height. The head retention was excellent and the tight cap lasted forever. There was some spotty subsequent lacing, clingy. The appearance is good. The nose is soft and well-rounded, it smells like espresso with milk and a side of gourmet chocolate. Lightly acidic. The potency is moderate. I like what this beer is saying. It is fairly complex for they style but straightforward. It is pleasant to sniff. The palate matches the nose perfectly; softly roasty malts supply some coffee notes and kisses of chocolate. Milky sweetness. Dry finish with a long, roasted coffee bean aftertaste. Im sure this beer would be killer with cheesecake. The palate is a bit straightforward but it is plenty tasty! Balanced. Medium in body, low but natural carbonation with a pleasant creamy mouthfeel, it feels right for this beer. This beer is very drinkable and quite sessionable if youre a stout fan. Well, it should be noted that the 6.5% abv is not really conducive to drinking a six-pack at once. It if is any consolation the alcohol is hidden in the taste maybe it would bypass your brain as well? Just a thought. It is no frills but good overall. It is more roasty and dry than say Mackeson Triple XXX Stout, both are good beers but both offer different interpretations on the Sweet Stout style. I obtained a six-pack of Bells Pale Ale and I drank five of them, I went to review the last bottle and this is what I pulled out! Bastards! Oh well, payback is a bitch as Ive substituted beers before. This was purchased in Kansas City, MO. It is a solid beer."
"This is a nice, full-flavored stout. I'm not disappointed with this one at all."
"Great drinkable stout! One of the best tasting and balanced stouts I have ever had. Smooth, malty, roasty with a hint of chocolate. These flavors really come out as it warms. A nice 6.50% ABV. Pours rather thick (but not too thick) with a creamy-tan head. Lacing goes all the way down the glass. Recommended!"
"One inch to an inch and a half head on this dark beauty. Wonderful lacing as well. Toffee aroma. I'd expect a bit more roastiness in the aroma for a stout, but that's just me. Taste is okay, a bit of the bells yeast funk going on, roasted flavors are rather muted as well. Mouthfeel is good and coating. This isn't a bad stout by any streach of the imagination, but it fails to ""wow"" me."
"This pours black in the glass with a thick billowing root beer float kind of head that leaves nice patches of lace down the sides of the glass. The aroma is sweet malts, biscuits, and chocolate. The taste is sweet chocolate and caramel with some hop bitterness and roasted/burnt coffee flavors in the end. Absolutely smooth and velvety across the mouth, medium to full bodyvery drinkable. Wildly impressed with this stout"
"A dark typical looking stout with a bit of bubbly brown head floating around. Smells of chocolate milk, coffee grounds, sweet roasted malts. Taste is a bit off though. It tastes too much like coffee I think. It's a great flavor to have in a beer, but not when it overpowers everything else. I think that's the case here. Dry mouthfeel but a bit thick as well, strange. Not the most drinkable beer. It's a nice try, maybe it'd be better if they toned down the coffee taste."
"Kalamazoo Stout is the best milk/sweet stout that I've had yet, surpassing Bell's own Special Double Cream Stout (although it's been a while since I sampled SDCS). It's one of the biggest and boldest 6.5% ABV beers that you're ever likely to drink and is truly one of the best. Kudos all around."
"Picked this beer up a few days ago because I tried the Double Cream Stout a little bit ago, and wanted to see where this fell in relation to it. The beer pours a very black color with a half finger of head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is great. Balanced between the chocolate and the milky marshmellow creamyness. Wow. The flavor is not quite as creamy as the nose tells. There is a lot of chocolate that finishes coffee, with only a slight bit of the creamy milky tones. Not bad, but not as good as their Double Cream, but not a bad flavor. The feel is nice and thick with a velvety creamy smooth texture. Good feel. Overall, this is a really nice beer. I enjoy all the parts of it. I will have to have this again when I find it. Solid beer."
"Pours a black on black no light thru this baby with a big fluffy chocolate colored head that leaves a good lace coat, looks great. Smell is lightly roasted malt with expresso and chocolate present some light fruits in background. Taste is great lightly roasted malt expresso flavors with some hints of chocolate . Moves from lightly sweet malt to burnt bitterness from malt aided by good dose of hop bite. A great stout wish I could get this down in TN. Mouthfeel is right side of medium not heavy enough to be creamy but still feels good. Drinkability is good, man this is one tasty beer, thanks go to merlin48 for this tasty treat. If I ever make it to the Liquor Barn in Lexington this will be on my list of must haves."
"Thanks to Pisskynights and Feloniousmonk for sending a bottle each, respectively."
"one of the best stouts i've ever had."
"12oz. bottle: This pours an inky, dark brown color. There was very little brown head to this one. The aroma is raosted coffee, with some sweetness also. Possible chocolate and caramel. The taste is quite rich. It is silky, sweet, and has roasted coffee, chocolate. Full bodied. Extremely nice!"
"Very straightforward and not overly complex, but still a fine stout."
"This has a deep black color and a huge brown head. Almost as dark but not as oily looking as an imperial stout. The head leaves heavy lacing. There is a delicious sweet, malty, chocolaty aroma that is very appealing. The taste is great. It starts out sweet, then the chocolaty roasted flavor hits, and it finishes dry with a slight bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is also great. I hate thin tasting stouts but this one has some nice body and a very creamy texture."
"The aftertaste is sweet and leaves one waiting for a second-go-round. A very drinkable stout overall."
"This is a very fine drinking stout. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a classic example of an American Stout."
"poured black small brown head with very little lacing. aroma was a very pleasant sweet chocolate, carmel, and molasses, my nose said thank you.got a nice coffee, chocolate taste with a taste of raisins. ended with the right amount of bitterness for me"
"This is a rich and impressive drink. I enjoy it, but don't know if i could enjoy more than one at a setting."
"this beer is a solid quality representation of a sweet stout, and i find it always a pleasure to partake of, which is quite often."
"Pours out a pitch black with a slow forming head that works its way up to about an inch and a half of brown foam. As the head recedes down to a smaller on that lasts throughout rings of lace are left decorating the glass. Picture perfect looking brew here nice head good lace, what more could you want. Strong aroma with roasted coffee and dark chocolate coming out the most. I was able to smell this as I was pouring it. Taste is similar with a bitter coffee flavor up front and a slight earthy hoppiness as well. Slight bit of cream to the flavor before it ends in a lingering bitter coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slick with a medium to full body. Great drinkability as this went down very easy and I would have had another if I had it."
"Rich and smooth in the mouth with medium carbonation. Nice body, but doesn't quite match up with the heavy dose of roast. Not a bad stout by any means, but not one to be consumed in large quantities."
"Can they make excellent stouts or what?"
"The beer came in a brown 12 oz. bottle. When poured into a standard pint glass, the body was black with brown tones. The head was rich and creamy and khaki in color. The aroma was very roasty with strong black coffee being the prominent smell. The taste was robust with bitter coffee, burnt toast, raisins, and unsweetened cocoa powder. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with a soft carbonation. The aftertaste was dry and slightly peppery. Very nice and drinkable stout that has an amazing depth of complexity to boot. Many thanks go to Ninjaworm for this bottle in trade."
"Pours with a tiny and bubbley dark brown head. The smell is sour and acetyl with a woddy smell (oak?). The texture of this beer is fantastic on the palate. It has a frothy creaminess to is, but the beer is a bit empty of flavor. It is very roasty but not complex at all which leaves a lot to be desired."
"Simply excellent. As soon as I finished my first bottle, I was online looking up the brewery and how far it was from St. Louis. The aroma was sublime. The taste was warm, sweet, and urging me to take another sip. The color was black as a moonless night. The head was nice and thick with good lacing throughout the glass."
"From the bottle comes a deep dark black liquid with a great tan creamy, fluffy head. The head on this beer was present for much of the beer, and there was a decent amount of lacing on the glass. What a great looking beer so far. Smells of milk chocolate, cocoa, maybe a hint of coffee, and slight dark fruit. Tastes are a nicely roasty malt, followed by some sweet chocolate flavors. Maybe just slightly smoky. Slight hop bitterness at the end. Low carbonation, and a creamy mouthfeel. This could probably be a little fuller, but that is about all I can complain about. Pretty drinkable, although it is slightly sweet. Another winner from Bell's."
"What a nice beer from Kzoo, this is the best beer I have had from Bells. The kind Kzoo brew."
"It has been a while since I have sampled a milk stout. This one is quite nice. The head is thick and leaves an intricate lacing. The nose is quite varied with hints of chocolate and coffee. The hops are subdued but they compliment the sweet character very well. Tastes of chocolate combine well with a literally ""bittersweet"" character. The mouthfeel is quite dry which is suprising for this style of beer. Quite drinkable and tastey. Drink up!"
"a pitch black stout with a small saddle colored head that faded to a ring before long. smell eas of dark coffee and semi-sweet chocolate with a gentle acididty to the back. taste is slightly hoppy for a milk/sweet stout but, not imperial hoppy. chocolate malts with a slight sour coffee are dominant. slight pepper in the aftertaste. mouthfeel is nice and heavy. thick. very nice beer to break up an all day drink-a-thon. will try again."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich dark malt scent that is dominated with chocolate and roasted barley. It is sweet to the nose and seems a bit creamy. The taste is good. It has a dry black malt flavor with some chocolate hints and a semi-sweet finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine stout. It has great aroma and flavor a good sessions ale."
"I will not have any problem drinking the rest of this sixpack !"
"Overall: A finely crafted beer but it wasn't what I expected. Good but not great."
"Final Thought: The Bell's line is quite impressive with this being the best of the breweries stout line... tastes like a full flavored Guinness!"
"Comments  Big thanks to feloniousmonk for the hook-up!"
"I think this would be my favorite sweeter stout to date; would make a very good session stout and would be perfect with dessert; preferably a heaping of vanilla ice cream."
"poured an ink black that allowed no light through even when held up to a lamp. good deal. a moderatly thick head that thinned out before i got through half of the glass. little to no lacing. last couple beers have been like that, maybe its me. aroma was of burnt malts, very roasty. taste was of expresso, with a ting of milk sweetnes peeking through. aftertaste was that of a sweetened coffee. mouthfeel was of a full bodied brew. this was a thicker brew and i dug it. a fine beer in my opinion. damn fine"
"Poured black as crude oil with a monster chocolate-milk coloured foamy head. Very chocolate/coffee like in smell almost like melted, warm chocolate ice cream, and extremely so in taste. Quite tasty! This is my favourite style of brew to begin with, but I'd have to place this one in particular in my top five. The mouth feel is nice and smooth and quite easy to drink. A bit heavy, but so is the nature of the beast. I have yet to have a brew of this style that wasn't a least a little bit heavy. I strongly recommend this to anyone who fancies porters/stouts."
"Simply one of the best sweet stouts I've ever tasted."
"This stout is very drinkable for dessert and after. Might be a bit sweet for most dinners but starting with dessert and even a couple after it would be very enjoyable."
"Peering out through its opacity, I was impressed by the depths of the k-zoo stouts darkness. There wasnt much head  but the color of the beer almost made up for that failing. The coffee and chocolate aroma drew me deeper in love with this black beauty. The strong flavors of roasted malt provided a foundation for chocolate, coffee, and a few hop notes. Its a most excellent, full bodied and warming beer. The alcohol doesnt play on the palate, but it contributes significantly to the mouth feel."
"Poured a distinctly opaque black.Nice slight tan head atop.Nice roasted aroma-hints of coffee and dark chocolate.Huge roasted flavor.Theresa great combination of mocha,licorice,roasted malt and chocolate.Really well done-not overly complex.I dont find the residual sweetness you get in some other milk stouts.Nice full mouthfeel-full bodied but not too big and ""oily"".Very drinkable beer."
"It pours opaque black with a very generous, long-lasting sticky tan head in my fin du monde glass (great with stouts I find). Aroma displays very creamy malt, I could have believed this was a milk stout. Roasted chocolate and burnt coffee grains complement the sweetness. Very round and full mouthfeel, creamy. Particularly low carbonation. Alcohol hint accompanies the restrained bitterness in the finish-> alcool which I thought should not be felt at all in a 6.5% beer with all that roasted malt. Once again, this stout got this milky aspect that I came to dislike when combined with an almost still mouthfeel. It feels, not unlike a wine, just dead in the mouth despite all the licorice, molasses, chocolatey flavors from the dark malts. Well done, but still severly overrated to my tastes and definitely nowhere near as complex as expedition. Smooth, yet ultimately close, but no cigar."
"The beer isnt thin yet it also isnt very thick also. It lacks the really heavy taste akin to a brooklyn black choc stout but it is still rather good on its own right. I'd pick up another sixer of this sometime for sure."
"Had this again after three years and it really hits the spot, often imitated never copied. Bitterness is so well controlled by roast and malt, not overwhelming coffee either."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a big ol' 1"" mocha-hued head above an opaque dark brown/black brew. Dense head has good staying power, and laced tremendously. Aroma is of coffee and choco malts, with a bit of milk sweetness that rounds it out nicely. The taste is follows the aroma's map, and the sweetness really rounds out the flavor on the palate. Don't know where that 6.5% is hiding, but it was cloaked with some artistic brewing. If I had to find a fault, I think the mouthfeel is a bit thin for such a hearty brew, but this is really nit-picking. One of the best stouts I've enjoyed, just wish it was more widely available."
"Somewhat disappointed in this one. Bottle appears to be fresh, and has been stored properly, to the best of my knowledge. Possibly, an off-bottle here, judging from other reviews. Lack of carbonation and the mysterious sour element in the taste are my reasons for wondering about this one."
"This was a very dark beer. Midnight black in color and topped off with a tan creamy head of foam. The aroma is malty and rich with chocolate syrup. Sweet and buttery with molasses and caramel. The taste is pleasantly rich and very smooth. Not overly anything, sweetness is right on and has just the right amount of roasted bitterness. Good malt body with some of that roasted bitterness coming through in the finish and lingering in the throat. Overall a very pleasant and an exceptionally drinkable dark beer."
"Pours a jet black with almost no head at all. The aroma is a little different, i smell some butter and i'm not sure what else to be exact. It wasn't an awful aroma, just not the best either. Taste is full of roasted malts and yeast. Not very well balanced if you asked me. Mouthfeel is really nice as this is a nice, thick, creamy stout. This isn't my favorite stout by any means, but I wonder if i just got an off bottle."
"The Kalamazoo basic stout, while not exceptionally strong or earthy, I can sip it all night as slow as I want at whatever temperature I want and it never becomes overwhelming or lose its appeal. When you don't feel like you're up to handle an imperial stout but you still want that thick earthy feeling and full mouthfeel, look to kalamazoo as an easy drinking stout that has a taste that is simple and subtle."
"This beer would be something else if the diacetyl was cleaned up a bit. Having said that, if you don't mind a bit of diacetyl, this would be a really good beer for you."
"Pours a very dark brown color with some reddish highlights as well as a mountainous tan head that very slowly recedes, coating the walls of the glass as it does so. Nose is dark caramel and cocoa beans blended with fresh brewed butter-pecan coffee. Medium to full in body and quite smooth and creamy in texture. Taste begins with notes of French Roast followed by unsweetened dark chocolate and some spicy yeasts. Some faint smoky charcoal is present towards the finish as well as a touch of bitter hops. Probably not what Id call a milk/cream/sweet stout, but quite enjoyable nevertheless. Thanks to feloniousmonk for the sample!"
"Thanks Feloniousmonk!"
"Motor oil black, with a gingerbread brown head. Smells strongly of coffee, alcohol and molasses. Goes through an interesting flavor progression. Starts with a smooth coffee flavor, somewhat acidic. The alcohol is apparent, but not offensive. Mouthfeel is both smooth and carbonated at the same time. Very good, all around."
"buy it, love it, buy it again. my new favorite beer."
"There's a bit of chocolate and coffee in the smell. These flavors show through stronger in the taste. You can also make out carmel, hops, and a bready-yeasty flavor. It's all very balanced and very enjoyable. The alcohol never shows through at all. Well done indeed."
"Overall - Drink this one. I loved this all the way. Very much a full-bodied stout with some great character. Enjoy!"
"Pint glass arrived with a nice, creamy, thick tan head. I must say that the appearance of that glass as the server brought it was the best part of the beer. A nice lace coated the glass from the top to the last drop. It has a slightly sweet, faintly licorice odor. It also had a fairly noticeable licorice flavor that I personally didn't care for. A nice roastiness tried to chase it away, and that is what saved the beer and made it drinkable. It did have a full, substantial mouthfeel. Overall, I thought it was adequate but unremarkable."
"12 oz bottle. Poured out black as pitch, with a moderate head that slowly faded, leaving lacing on the glass. Aroma is muted roated grains, and malt, with a sweetness thrown in. Taste is that of roasted malt but in a very thin and weak way. Lingering bitterness in the finish. Carbonated more than a traditional stout. Not a bad drinking beer."
"Pours a jet black with little head. The aroma is of a sweet chocolate and hint of coffee but isn't that powerful. The taste is a blast of chocolate and espresso that blend very well together. This taste lingered in my mouth for quite sometime afterwards. This is a very sweet mellow brew. Again the mouthfeel and aftertaste are outstanding. A very drinkable beer for any occasion and a must try for anyone who loves these types of stouts."
"Tasted blind at the Saint Loius BA tasting 12/14/03"
"My first ever product from Bell's has a slightly viscous, ebony-to-brown pour which results in a thin, dirty-tan head no more than 1/4"" deep that dissipates quickly and spottily to nothingness, just a puny collar. Color is an opaque, inky black; evidence of a streamer or two is marked by bubbles popping up at surface of beer. Globs of yeast clinging to sides of glass are unappetizing as well. Aroma is roast, toast, and more roast toast, to a degree that I've only detected in Imperial Stouts up to this point. Nosefeel is dry and woody, with baking chocolate and coffee tones alongside a not-unpleasant taste of grain; yet behind all this, a plump, purple-fruitiness seems to be lurking. Flavor begins quite sweetly at the tip of the tongue, proceeding to huge roastiness in the midpalate. A slight cola-like sweetness lingers here, to the detriment of the overall feeling; then hops make their presence known in a bittery black coffee to dark chocolate aftertaste. And yet, again: a fruitiness almost like blueberry skins ghosts around in the background... and a woodiness more oaken than cedary. Mouthfeel is tingly and surprisingly delicate in manner; just approaching oily with a light cling that gracefully subsides. High drinkability considering the assertive flavor. A shame: if this beer only had a nice finger of head to top it off, I'd have given it a ""4" in all categories. That said, I was sorry not to have a second bottle and I intend to seek this one again."
"Stout."
"Overall a fantastic offering from Bell's though, and yet another reason I'm glad that I live in SW Michigan."
"Other: Choose a good 'un for review 250. Thanks to feloniousmonk for directly making this possible and xlperro for indirectly doing it."
"Overall, this is very drinkable for a thick beer. I would probably fill up on these if I had 3 or more, but could definitely have another if I had one."
"Pours black with a great brown head. Beautiful. Taste while it's in your mouth is a mix of sweetness and bitterness, the combo is like a freight train hitting your brain. Impossible to pick everything out, though fun to try. The aftertaste is rough on this one though, very bitter and lingers on the tongue. It feels great to roll it around in your mouth for a while. I could easily drink this beauty all night."
"Then I sipped again."
"12 Oz bottle seems like it was not filled all the way... but onlt half way up the neck of the bottle. Slight roast nose but not huge. Thick rich milk cocoa colored thick airy head. Dark black opeque look in the pint glass. Rich slightly sweet roasty initial taste then gives way to layers of Expresso and dry cocoa powder in the slightly sour finish. Mediumish mouth. Not at all as good as the draft version I had quite a while ago.. but still a nice stout."
"Overall, a very good, quite drinkable stout - one of the best I've tried (and I've tried quite a few)."
"Left a gorgeous, fluttery, creamy lace in my pint glass. Sweet."
"ng"
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable stout. I have enjoyed all of the Bell's beers I've tried and this is no exception."
"[mad props out to PaulB for the hookup]"
"On premise at KBC. Darkest of the stouts we had on our weekend pub crawl across Michigan. A deep coffee roast flavor and appealing body. I suspect this might have been better if we bought it bottled and let it age. Don't know why really, but I just wasn't as impressed by these beers as everyone else. Perhaps it was the somewhat cold serving environment at the Eccentric."
"The first Bell's stout that I've reviewed, and I'm quite impressed. A very nice and bitter stout, and one that I'll certainly have again."
"Pours a dark chocolate brown and thick with a creamy dense head. Aroma is rich with roasted malts, notes of coffee and molasses . Body is creamy and smooth with modest carbonation. Flavor is a nice blend of sweet, bitter and dry. Really balanced out well. Sweet coming from roasted malt that reminds me of dry cocoa with a bitter finish. Overall one of the most even stouts I've had."
"thanks to feloniousmonk for the offering!"
"Appearance: Dark ruby brown could easily be mistaken for black so full it pours thick from the bottle, the thicket of foamy moccha tan head is magnificant looks like bread rising has that texture very chunky and bubbly so nice forms collar of lacing as it slowly dwindles, quite the resiliency on this one. Aroma: Dark roasts create joy on multiple levels but the aroma here contains tones of mild cocoa, baking cookies, and an underlying tone of coffee beans very light but evident the oatmeal like tones are also very inviting toward my first sip. Taste: Such a beautiful balance of dark chocolate roasts and harsh bitterness from the dark roasts sweet robust flavor is just awesome solid all around, the ideal session stout. Mouthfeel: Fluffy yet medium to full bodied and smooth at the same time, unique quality to the mouthfeel can't quite describe it completely. Drinkability: A very tasty stout that helps me remember why I love dark beer so much, I once was stuck on the fact that only hops could suffice my beer sweet tooth but this is the type of brew that helps pull off a convert to stouts with still a great amout of bitter tones from the dark roasts so smooth and silky going down, just gotta love this one from Kalamazoo."
"A huge thanks to feloniousmonk for sending this one my way."
"A HUGE thanks goes out to feloniousmonk for this taste of midwestern goodness!"
"This one pours a very dark color with a small brown head that leaves a small bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malts and hints of coffee and chocolate. The flavor was much the same as the aroma: mostly roasted malts, coffee and chocolate with possibly a hint of caramel. I didn't find anything special about this brew and there are other milk stouts that better represent the style."
"An outstanding stout! Easier to drink than the Double Cream Stout thanks to a lesser %ABV, Kalamazoo Stout embodies what I love about a good stout - a smooth, creamy feel, rich taste and great appearance. This offering from Kalamazoo Brewing ranks right up there with Two Hearted on my Bells Best list. I brought four back on the plane with me."
"Black, with a full tan head. Carbonation, which is on the low side, seems to fit a beer with such a creamy, luscious mouthfeel. The nose is slightly fruity, with hints of chocolate and cream. Roasted malt leaps forth in the flavor profile on this one, with a comforting chocolate backnote. A tad sour at the finish. Overall, a very impressive brew."
"ave"
"Dark espresso, & bittersweet chocolate swirl around playfully. A roast grain flavour cuts in and leads towards the exit, drying things out along the way. The coffee flavour lingers, and is enjoyable, but it leaves me wondering - That's it? That's all? Full bodied, with prickly carbonation, make it quite drinkable, but I'm still left to wonder about its potential."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for this one!"
"Man I was pumped up about this beer, my first from Bell's. Looks nice. Pitch black with a thick tan head. Roasted coffee and a little bit of chocolate in both the aroma and the taste. Very sweet. But then there is that off flavor. Tastes like a plum that's a bit stale. It adds a bit of sourness that I find quite undisirable. I know Bell's has a reputation for being inconsistant at bottling, but I haven't got one yet that blew me away."
"Big Cheers to BigHuge for a good bottle of this one!!!"
"Thanks to sakaroo for the sample."
"Deep dark brown, just about black. The chunky, lumpy brown head sits an inch high, and doesn't sink at all. It looks like ice cream, I think I could float a quarter on it. Aroma is sweet chocolate and roasted malt. Flavor is big chocolate, caramel, and molasses. Finish is a burnt malt, and the lingering aftertaste is bitter coffee. Burnt malt and hop bitter sits in the back of the throat. Big, thick wads of lace hang onto the glass and slowly slide down. I'm more than halfway through the glass, and there's still a half-inch head. Everything about this one is great, but the flavor is very full and rich, which limits the drinkability a bit."
"This beer comes out with a great looking brown head rising out from the completely black beer under it. The smell of this drink is a roasted one. The same goes for the taste, only its REALLY roasted, with a chewy feel to it. This is a damn good beer i would say."
"Damn, I wish Bell's would get their shit together already. I'm sick of getting ""off"" beers from them."
"Pours a pitch black with rather big creamy almond colored head,the aroma is a mocha coffee and some nuttiness.Tastes sweet and roasted with some chocolate tones nice and creamy tasting.Its a beer to drink and savor for sure, this an Expedition are definently high quality stouts worthy of high marks."
"All in all, this is a stellar brew, just lacking that special something to make it a 5. The mouthfeel on this is very nice, with a reasonable amount of carbonation balancing the thickness, and helping it go down easy. As far as drinkability goes, I do like this stout for its moderate alcohol content but full flavor. Definetly one to return to again and again for an evening stout, although I haven't experimented with mixing it with food yet. Overall, an excellent beer."
"Much more a session than most stouts, and thats the icing on the cake of milk stouts. An all-time favorite, no doubt."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black color with two fingers of medium tan head. There is some lacing left on the glass. The smell is a sweet mix of roasted malt with some caramel and toffee. The taste is full of burnt malt, chocolate, and coffee. It is fairly sweet, with only a little bit of bitter hops coming out in the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly strong and thick. The drinkability is also pretty nice. A good all-around stout."
"The smell of heavy cream and plump sweet grains, broiled until black and sweating, emerges from the glass immediately. Very pulpy aromas force me to look for chunks floating in the black liquid. There are none. Patent leather, black rubber, and sweet, milky alcohol rule throughout the cadence of dank, charcoal, lunchpail, sex and truffle nuances that come at the margins only to be tossed aside by the strict carbon organization of this beer's flavor profile. It would be better if it weren't so reminiscent of boiled potatoes and charcoal dust. I'm looking for joy in this glass of beer and all I find is a grim prison of black dirt, milk and sweet white potatoes. Christy Brown could have written a better beer. But I suppose that's a credit to this beer."
"Flavor: it has a Nice roasted flavor. Very rich. Lots of chocolate on the palate"
"Is the Michigan DEP hiring? I could drink this happily all day long. Bittersweet with a roast coffee and slightly chocolatey/toffeelike sweetness. Very creamy, almost oatmeal-oily like mouthfeel. Then it dries out towards the finish, with the alcohol making its presence known in the background. Beautiful. This could quite rapidly become a favorite."
"This is a pretty damn good stout. The head is seriously lacking, and the mouth feel leaves a lot to be desired, but other than that this is a solid, standup stout. It has a nice flavor of burnt coffee that is really satisfying. This entry is better than most, but I would rather drink guinness."
"Bell's has made another terrific stout in this one. However I could see how some people that don't care for stouts might not like this. Strong coffee taste mixed with other malty flavors (chocolate, roasted barley, caramel). There's some bitterness but it's not a real hoppy bitterness and it's not real distinguishable, kinda mixed in with the malts. Very drinkable for a stout. I get this one often."
"This sample purchased at the Brewery's General Store on July 3, 2003."
"Reasonable abv, tasty enough to be on the short list whenever a good stout or 3 is necessary. Deserves permanent shelf space in my fridge."
"Good lacing on the pour. The head was a nice light color made up of small bubbles which quickly disappeared. Its body was a opaque black color. Its taste was that of some carbonation with a strong coffee and roasted caramel flavors. It went down very smoothly."
"A really dark brew, with a nice thin quarter-inch head. Oh boy, the smell on this puppy is goooood, and good chocolate aroma with a deep roasted, freshly ground coffee. The taste is great, I mean it's goooood, chocolate robustly flourishes on the tongue which is then swept over by the coffee, wonderful coffee flavor. Hints of molasses come through as well. The beer is smooth and leaves a nice roasty aftertaste."
"This stout poured a long lasting small creamy tan head of fine-small bubbles. The lacing was just fair on the sides of my glass. It had a chocolate aroma to it and a good strong and bold coffee flavor. This was a smooth and creamy tasting stout. The more I drink stouts, the more I am taking a liking to them."
"Good color of a solid stout, very dark brown, nearly black with super deep ruby amber highlights up to the light. Thin creamy foamed head of a very tan brown, looks like a pancake cooking. Strange glaring, hazy, spotty lace. Smell is a very nice sweetly dark chocolatey tone, roasty, with notes of earthy fresh hops, dark fruits of banana, cherry, and starfruit. One excellent nose on this stout. Taste is a medley of bold and rich chocolate malts and some caramel malts noted, roasty/toasty and thinly sweet, mostly covered in chocolateyness, dark and close to espresso-like in its earthyness and bitterness. Mostly middle flavors is where it goes complex on your taste buds. Perfect balance with the late hops, notes of dark coffee beans and roasted pecans. Very nice stout indeed. Feel is beautifully full, pleasurable, luscious, rich, creamy, with a late tangy dryness holding forever it seems on the roof of my mouth. One yummy, scrumptious stout. Another Bell's goody thats deserving of notoriety."
"The look and smell lead to an incredibly rich, thick flavor of chocolate, molasses, coffee, and smokey grain; is that a flash of licorice? Maybe. This is one big flavor extravaganza. Thick and creamy mouthfeel with a strong bitter finish in the back and sweetness lingering on the lips. Warming and soothing, this is one with which to linger for a long while, hopefully at fireside with a nice companion at hand."
"But who is this guy depicted in the etching portrait on the label? Bald but for unkempt hair on the sides and a wild beard. He seems to scowl - as though to say to a sales clerk: ""What do you mean, out of stout? This can not be!"""
"Thanks to francisweizen for the bottles!"
"Drinkability: Not too much for me to rave about. The slight sour aftertaste was a turnoff. Perhaps I missed something, but I just wasn't that impressed."
"Cheers"
"Nearly opaque as most stouts are. The smell is not as strong as some of the other Kalamazoo stouts, but this stout has some nice flavors of roasted malts. The flavor is somewhat coffee-like with a burnt barley bitterness in the finish. This is a great stout, and is wonderfully balanced with chocolate and caramel flavors as well. Bottom line is that this is a super roasty stout with a nice full body."
"Hands down Bell's top stout in my opinion. Gorgeous black color with a nice, puffy tan head. Aroma is of burnt Cocoa Krispies. Tastes like chocolate with a strong roasted flavor reminiscent of a Shakespeare Stout or some similar full-flavored brew. Decent hop presence. Very well balanced beer, and balance is something I think some of the other Bell's stouts lack."
"Part of the MJR Blockbuster deal."
"509"
"Another great Stout from Bells. I was surprised at the amount of head, it poured a thick chunky head that lasted the whole pint (more than any of the other Bell's Stouts I tried tonight). Very dark with tan head.Strong coffee, and chocholate milk flavor. Good stuff."
"Reminds me of Shakespeare stout with the combination of chocolate/coffee tase and hops bitterness. I think the Shakespeare has an edge in flavor, but this is a good stout (I liked it at least as much as the Victory Storm King). Pours a nice head with good retention, dark as night, with an appealing roasted aroma. Bitter, but not overly so. Fairly carbonated, with a medium body. I still prefer the smoothness of a Samuel Smith over the drier, more bitter micro-stouts, but this is an enjoyable beer, well worth trying."
"Who cares? It's delicious!"
"F."
"A really nice stout from one of my favorite brewers. A very opaque black brew with dark brown head appears out of the bottle. it has a huge roasted malt aroma, espresso with bitter chocolate and a slight whiskey undertone in the nose. The flavor is a great balance between the roasted malt and sweet malt with a long roasty finish. It finishes dry with a nice espesso acidity and a hint of smoke. It has a great drinkable medium body that isn't too rich for another bottle. Highly recommended stout."
"I don't know how the magicians over in Kzoo do it, but despite being so rich and complex, this brew is extremely drinkable. The only thing better than this is having it on tap. I feel sorry for the people who don't have access to all of Kzoo's brews. They brew some of the finest beer you'll ever have. This is an exceptional beer that I couldn't live without, and one of the only reasons I still live in Michigan. A World-Class King of Stouts. Cheers!"
"This stout is simply one of the best. It's pitch black, very opaque, and has one heluva roasted aroma. There is also a small hint of chocolate in the aroma as well. The mouthfeel is so smooth and creamy, with also a crisp carbonation if you leave a swig in your mouth for a little while. Taste is very much dominated by the roastiness and wow is it enjoyable. Chocolate comes through a little bit, more so in the finish along with the bittersweetness. The aftertaste lasts long and is burnt coffeeish. I can't find anything I don't like about this stout. It's one of my favorites and I could easily drink one for dessert, or even a few in a row if I really want to indulge."
"Aroma of coffee overpowers the nose, followed by dark roasted malts. Faint hint of alcohol. The taste is of coffee/toffee, roasted smoky malt, slight chocolate, and a faint hint of licorace. A semi tart mouthfeel reminds me more of a dry stout rather than sweet, with a light hop finish. Rather thick, couldn't have more than two. Nice beer though."
"Dark, almost opaque color with a thin tawny head. Aromas of burnt coffee and faint hints of chocolate. Some fruity and hoppy notes as well in the nose. Msdium bodied and smooth. The taste is consistnet with the aromas. Nice coffee bitterness. Chocolate and caramel and toffee even a little vanilla bean. Very easy drinking stout. Not at all heavy. Makes you want more than one. A very, very competent offering by a premier brewery."
"Pours a deep reddish chestnut color, almost black, with a thin tan head. The aroma is very strong with sweet fruits, like cherry and pear. Scents of the finest chocolate in the world tease the nostrils. A bit of hop spiciness mixed in as well. Truly delicious aroma. The taste is strong on dark, bittersweet chocolate. A nice sweetness follows, as well as defined roasted notes. The finish presents more fruity chocolate, with a wisp of smoke. A bit of vanilla is present as well, mixed in with the solid malt flavor in the background. As you can tell, this is one very complex beer. I also sense a bit of nuttiness in there as well. The mouthfeel is very smooth, and shows a moderate body. Not as thick as some sweet stouts, but flavor is what this beer is all about. I would gladly trade a handful of Guinness beers for just one of these. However, I could drink this beer exclusively and soon forget that there was ever any other beer in my life. While each bottle may not last that long, I can see this is the beginning of a long-term relationship with Kalamazoo. Oh, what a beer! Thanks to cretemixer for the trade."
"Pours an opaque black (no highlights when held to the light, but the yeast sediment is clearly visible at the bottom of the glass) with a frothy light tan head that holds fairly well before dropping to a decent collar and whispy surface covering. A short creamy head can easily be brought back, however, simply by swirling the glass, and it leaves some nice as well. The nose is rich with a sharp roastiness and notes of bittersweet chocolate, but also offers some floral and lightly earthy hops in the background. The medium body is enhanced by an exceptionally fine carbonation from bottle conditioning that leaves it creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor is also affected by the creamy carbonation, softening it's bitterness and rounding it's sharp roasted edges. It starts with an underlying fruitiness and dark chocolate, but immediately becomes quite roasty. It warms to reveal some caramel sweetness as it crosses the palate but reverts to deep roastiness and a solid bitterness in the finish. A rich, dark roasted coffee flavor lingers in the mouth long after the liquid had gone and occassional flashes of hop flavor can sometimes be found. Rich, complex, and highly enjoyable. This makes a great after-dinner drink or nightcap. Highly recommended and well worth seeking out."
"Pours an opaque black with a tan head. Roasted malt aroma. Wonderful roasted malt flavor with sweet chocolate notes. Full body. Finishes well and has good drinkability. Of the beers I've had from Kalamazoo Brewing, this is my favorite. Overall very good if not exceptional. If you're into sweet stouts this one is top notch."
"Young's Double Chocolate Stout has been a favorite Stout beer, until I tried Kalamazoo Stout. This beer is the Stout of all Stouts. It has a very rich, black color with a brown earthy head. The exceptional smell of deep ""roastyness"" is unique. You get a slight burnt flavor, yet at the same time, a long lasting and residual chocolatey sweetness. This is not a bitter beer. I highly recommend!"
"Overall this is a very nice stout. A nice complexity of flavors and odors that make for an enjoyable drink. It is bitter and sweet and tart along with dry and wet all at the same time. My second Bell's product and my opinion of them is getting better."
"Another great Bell's stout. This one pours an opaque black with a fizzy tan head. Excellent head retention leaves substantial lace down the glass. Smell is big on roasted malt and espresso. Taste is more of the same and some chocolate characteristics, with the roasted aspects taking priority. There is a bittering hops quality to it, as well, but overall the taste is rather sweet as the style would suggest. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Excellent drinkability, too, makes this a wonderfully delicious stout suitable for all occasions."
"This is a great flagship Stout from Bell's. Pours a a deep dark brown with a thick, somewhat foamy light brown head. Decent lacing. Nice chocolately and coffee bean aroma. Sweet flavor of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. Slightly bittersweet dry finish. This is a great beer."
"Black as a moonless night with a smooth creamy head. The aroma is of roasted malt with chocolate and coffee. A nice bitterness, not too overpowering. Medium body with a good mouthfeel. Another very good Bell's product."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a foamy tan head, smoky roasted malt aroma. Nice malty taste with a prominant roasted malt flavor with dark coffee tones and maybe a little caramel thrown in, also a little bit of cracker maltiness Tastes really solid, not a watered down stout. A definate must for stout lovers."
"pours midnight black with a fine tan head. aroma is chocolate espresso. medium body with a good carbonation level, affording a good mouthfeel. the taste is dark roasted malts, with a cocoa-coffee finish. a very nice stout that gets better as is comes to room temperature. reminds me somewhat of rogue chocolate stout, just toned down a bit. very good."
"Pours thick dark black color, nice lasting tan head, leaves a perfect lace, aroma of chocolate, coffee and nutmeg? Thick and creamy full mouthfeel, coffee and sweet chocolate taste, this may be my favorite stout, its hard to stop at just one, the best stout IMHO."
"The pour as dark as they come with an extravagant head, a large olde frothy ""Thang", long lasting and chocolate brown in color with the lace in voluptuous sheets. Nose, coffee, bitter-sweet chocolate, roasted malt, ah yes my friends one ""Sniffable Beer"". Front malt, sweet, the top portly, the finish is benignly acidic, stupendously hopped, lordly dry. It's a good thing that I have to beg borrow and steal these beers, as my total would be much less as why sample the rest, when you can have the best. #10 of their beers sampled, not a ""loser in the bunch"". Trust the olde spavined ""Gusler", when I tell you this line of beers is phenomenal."
"Opaque and black as night, with a persistant foamy tan head.  Aroma of coffee, chocolate and nuts.  Flavor of the same with a bit of hops noticable at the end.  This is an amazingly complex stout, although it's not at all sweet which is odd for the style.  High carbonation for the a stout, and maybe thinner than it could be.  I'm not sure that this is what a milk stout should be, but that won't stop me from loving every drink of this wonderful brew."
"Another beer as black as sin. If formed a nice bubbly dark tan head and left some nice lace. It had an aroma of malt, burnt coffee and chocolate . The flavor was of malt, burnt coffee and chocolate. It had a medium body and a slightly bitter chocolate finish. Another Bell's that seems better on tap."
"Beautiful pour. Deep black with dark tan head that looks almost sandy, but feels so creamy. It's a roll call of dark malt flavors and aromas: caramel and chocolate being dominate, but with an undercurrent and finish of burnt bitterness. Low to no coffee, though. Incredible stout."
"This powerful stout pours a deep black color with a foamy tan head wafting a deep roasted heavily chocolate aroma.  The roasted and patent malt flavors are backed up by an aggessive beefy hop presence.  The carbonation was a bit high from the bottle, but the flavor was nice and fork-thick."
"This is one of my favorite beers, so maybe I'm a little biased, but this is truly one of the best stouts this planet has to offer!"
"Very dark color (no light gets through, even when viewed next to a sun-filled window!) and attractive carmely bronze head.  Aroma of chocolate, caramel and coffee beckons to be drunk (so I did).  Taste is as awash with toasty chocolate and coffee as one would expect, though the bitterness was sharper than with some smoother stouts.  Nice mouthfeel.  I'll be back for more."
"The attractive beige head tops a virtually jet - black hued brew. Sharp, espresso & dark caramel, w/ rich bittersweet chocolate notes in aroma. Mild impression of well toasted buttery nuts rounds the aroma out. Rich, deeply roasted coffee & caramelized sugar followed by a pleasantly assertive roasted barley and hop bitterness in flavor. Hugely chocolately. Fairly full bodied, w/ a viscous mouthfeel. Finishes w/ a lingering enjoyable hop and roasted unmalted barley bitterness that leaves my palette beckoning for more. Kalamazoo Stout possesses many of the qualities an imperial stout has, yet is light enough for excellent drinkability. One of the most flavorful, yet balanced examples available. Akin to a true Foreign Export style stout in overall character. Yum's the word."
"Pours a medium - full body, opaque in color. On the nose are aromas of different hints of chocolate. There is also notes of chocolate on the palate along with hints of molasses, and heavy notes of caramel malts. The mouth feel is slightly fizzy but mostly smooth. This brew gets better as it warmsgood stuff!"
"Bell’s Kalamazoo Stout:  Absolutely black beer, with a dense brown head that sticks to the glass al the way down..  Full rich aroma like rich strong coffee and dark chocolate.  Very rich roasted almost burnt malt, with a bit more bitter bite than I’d anticipated, although not in a bad way at all.  A definite sipping beer, and two can last all night.  Excellent."
"Nice and dark, notes of long lasting chocolate without a heavy or bitter expresso taste...medium body with slight glass adhesion...this is really good stout, akin in the bottle to many cask conditioned stouts...worth letting warm, taking advantage of its lack of carbonation -- its the next best thing to sitting over the British cellar in your living room."
"ORIGINAL RATING: One of my all-time favorites. Even better if you get it on tap at the Bell's Beer Garden. Nice, rich taste of molasses and a velvety smooth mouthfeel. Bell's knows their stouts."
