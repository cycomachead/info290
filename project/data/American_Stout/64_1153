It is surprisingly full flavored for such a low ABV beer! I cannot differentiate between the Chicory and coffee flavors personally. Overall, the only weakness is a somewhat thin mouthfeel, which is a small gripe for such a great beer. I purchase this one without hesitation anytime I see it on the shelf!","Neorebel","May 14, 2014"

The nose is packed with bitter roasted coffee and bitter dark cacao. The mouth is smooth and surprisingly light. I actually wish it had a little bit more body. The flavor follows the nose with an abundance of bitter coffee and chocolate as well as burnt dried fruit and a little sweet malt to balance the bitter. This is a very well crafted stout and quite easy to drink. I look forward to enjoying it again down the road.","lochef81","Apr 18, 2014"

Smells wonderful; huge aroma of roasted chicory and coffee beans, malt and vanilla and faint smokey-ness. Flavor is hugely coffee, very reminiscent of cappuccino with some hints of cinnamon and chicory. The downside is that the flavor seems to end abruptly leaving behind a smokey, roasted aftertaste. Slightly sweet, mildly earthy, underwhelming malt and hops. The aftertaste really starts to bother me after a while. Medium bodied, light carbonation.

Head has almost a soda like consistency to it with good lacing. Right away you can smell the coffee roast and chicory. I'd say this beer smells better than it tastes even. The taste is a bit underwhelming. I was expecting something that could possibly top DFH's India Brown Ale, but sadly, I don't think this does. It lacks the creaminess and richness that I've come to love about the IBA. It's very dry in contrast. Like I said, this just doesn't have the smooth, creamy feel of the IBA either. And at almost 10 bucks for a 4 pack as opposed to a 6 pack, this beer just doesn't seem worth the extra cash. It was good to try this, but I think I'll stick to the IBA instead.","MisSigsFan","Mar 01, 2013"

Rare trails of foam line the glass. This beer speaks colors to me. I smell caramel blended with malted grains with a bit of toffee sprinkled on top. The lightest trace of pecans trailed behind the roasted barley, toast, cocoa, and fresh coffee and joined the sweetness from before. As you sip, the same order of subtleties come out, with the sweetness lingering a few seconds after the finish, until the mild bitterness of burnt toast and coffee emerge and let a dryer feel take over. The carbonation is refreshing, yet smooth upon the medium bodied liquid. Overall, a very nicely drinkable, yet tasteful beer.","DmanGTR","Feb 24, 2013"

Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, roasted malt, light caramel, toast, light wood, light char, floral, and slight licorice. Fantastic aromas with great balance, strength, and complexity of roasted flavors with the added coffee and spices. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, light caramel, light wood, light char, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, light caramel, light wood, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of roasted flavors, with only a light amount of added spices noted in the taste. Zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice stout! Very nice balance and robustness of roasted flavors; extremely smooth to drink. The aromas kind of made the taste a letdown, but this was still very enjoyable.","superspak","Feb 22, 2013"

3.92,5.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O: I get that this is a very taste-specific beer - and I want to respect that - but I really liked it, so my ratings may be higher than the average - it all has to do with chicory, which is like radicchio and endive - bitter, woody, herbal, and earthy - and coffee-like, but not coffee-tasting - similar, but different. Try a coffee brewed with chicory, and if you like that, and beer, you will love this. Otherwise, it's probably hit or miss.","Greywulfken","Nov 07, 2012"

3.83,2.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"First off, NO truth in advertising here! My pour created just over two fingers of dense, mocha-brown head with decent retention. Color was a deep, dark brown with ZERO light penetration and cola highlights only at the edges. Nose smelled of coffee, not strong like I usually brew, but coffee all the same. Mouthfeel was medium and the bitterness normally associated with coffee was, indeed, smoothed out by the chicory. It was like non-bitter coffee and I was conflicted since I like bitter, black coffee, but this took on a vanilla aspect in the mouth. Finish was smooth, coffee-like, tasty. One would be plenty for me, however.","woodychandler","Jul 28, 2012"

Nice roasted malt and slight smoke aroma. Roasted malt, coffee and sweet malts to start melding into a sweeter malt with roasty elements, somewhat dry finish, but well integrated and nice flavor progression. This is a nicely made low ABV stout. Will try again.","LiquidAmber","Mar 29, 2012"

Smell is big coffee and roasted flavors, with big chicory, along with a smokey aroma. Flavor follows the nose, and is surprisingly strong on the palate, the coffee and chicory are wonderful, with roasted malts on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but not terrible for a regular stout. Overall, a really nice beer, with a real big flavor profile for a single stout. Well done.","zac16125","Feb 28, 2012"

Smells of the mexican coffee listed as well as dark cocoa and malt. A good full bodied flavor in the mouthfeel up front with the coffee and cocoa mixing with the chicory for a wonderful roasty finish that's spicy but fades fairly cleanly.

It does get a bit sweeter as it warms, though. The body is perhaps on the light side, but it has a nimble feel.

Considering its very ordinary abv, this beer deserves an upward tick on account of drinkability.","beagle75","Dec 22, 2011"

The tastes packs a bit more kick then I was expecting. Very acidic tasting, slightly dry finish, despite having a vaguely creamy feel while in the mouth. The taste is a bit like coffee, mixed with some raisin, and roasted and toasted grain. I like the taste, and most things about the beer, but I do feel it's a bit on the thin side... the carbonation also kind of makes it feel more biting then I was anticipating for a stout. All in all, I like this beer, but I don't think it's one I will be getting as a staple.

4.2,12.6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty damn good American Stout. It had a pretty good flavor, there was some nice complexity and even though I couldn't find the difference between chicory and coffee it was still a nice flavor that worked well with this beer and it helped balance out the heavily roasted malts. I find this beer to have pretty good drinkability. if I had another one I would drink it, I could probably drink two or three of these in a sitting without a problem, which is pretty good for an American Stout. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, there wasn't anything that I felt was out of place or that could be improved on. What I liked least about this beer was that it comes in four packs, this has six pack beer written all over it, but at least Dogfish Head didn't put it in a 750ml bottle, that would suck. I will for sure be picking up a four pack of this before they are all gone, it makes for a good tasting and easy drinking American Stout. I recommend this if your a fan of American Stouts or coffee flavored beers, this will hit the spot. Dogfish Head did a great job with this beer, I just assumed this would be a big beer so I was surprised to this was only 5.2%, but it still had big beer flavors. The more beers I try from Dogfish Head the more they impress me, their crew really knows what they are doing when it comes to making good tasting and unique beers.","StoutHunter","Dec 09, 2011"

4.03,8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours out nigh-black until held closely to a light source...than it gets some dark brown highlights around the edges. Single finger of tan colored head dissipates into a thin fizzy membrane on the surface of the brew in about two minutes. Very nice bubbly carbonation in spite of this, however, and a lovely silky medium thick body. Aroma is strong with chicory licorice at first, but this element fades out gradually over time compared to the other aspects as the brew warms up. As it warms, It develops much more of a roasted element alongside a strange coconut / bitter spiced chocolate candy odor. I taste some nice roasted chocolate at first which resolves into a black coffee which is significantly milder in harshness than the black coffee notes I typically get from stouts, perhaps it is the chicory acting as a tempering agent? There is definitely a herbal / earthen hopping accent, and the oddball coconut aroma is missing from the flavor... strange yet satisfying. Very full of flavor for the low ABV. I like it. Comes across as almost a sort of holiday spiced stout.","WastingFreetime","Nov 26, 2011"

There is a nice ring with some great looking lacing. Smell is some roasted dark malts up front, sweet milk chocolate, and faint coffee. This first hits similar to a sweet milk stout with the coffee flavor notes subtle and sneaky. It's great that this is not overdone. Pretty smooth all around with a light aftertaste. Much lighter than I expected. No alcohol noticeable and carbonation is on the lower end. It's a classy brew for sure. A complex coffee blend in a stout that you could session it up with; yeah I said it. Dogfish Head getting the holiday season started with a solid banger.","mindlucent2007","Nov 17, 2011"

Taste follows the nose nicely, mostly getting coffee and chocolate in a lovely mocha way. Hops still have a bit of a presence, surprising since the bottle is older.

The head then dissolves away slowly to a thin layer on top. Chocolate and coffee fragrances strike the nose at first scent, followed by a sugar syrup scent and ending with a twang of licorice. The malt comes out at the front of each taste with the expected chocolate and coffee flavors. Then the flavor just seems to fade away, a slight touch of burnt bitterness, but nothing comes forward to stand out. The feel is a big disappointment, it starts across the palate like a heavy water and it thins out very quickly. This beer started out great, beautiful color and thick look. A solid and fragrant aroma, then it all went to hell. The flavors were there but it never brought any strength with and faded way too quickly. The feel left me in a WTF mode for some time.

Mouthfeel was on the thin side for a stout, but it didn't hinder the drinkability. Quite quaffable, with a manageable abv.

This is an easy drinker for a stout and, based on appearance, the overall effect is unexpected. Even folks who dont typically like stout can enjoy this one.

Also tasted like black coffee, with acidic, bitter chocolate tones and some smokey aftertaste. It had a medium body with decent carbonation.

It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. It was a little on the light side for the mouthfeel than I like my stouts, but still not terrible.

Finishes with a bit of vanilla and oats. Mouthfeel is very light and fluffy...a bit watery, but not too watery. The fluffiness of this stout makes up for it. Awesome mouthfeel.

4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Dogfish Head Chicory Stout is a solid, tawny black ale with a dense khaki head that thins to a film and leaves excellent lacing. It has a strong, roasty, herbal aroma with notes of coffee and chicory. It's pretty full bodied. It's a little metallic at first and then very chewy at the finish. It has chocolate and coffee ice cream flavors, perhaps a note of strawberry. It's well balanced. The bitterness isn't blatant, but it sustains the finish. It's creamy with a hint of lactose. It's a solid stout that's found a niche.","yesyouam","Dec 28, 2010"

Slightly hoppy feel.","Ryanm1","Dec 26, 2010"

Smell is pleasant with lots of different things to pick up on at each nosing. Tastes chocolaty with slight bitter taste on the back of the toungue. There is a floral or herb taste that makes itself known on every other drink. Rich and flavorful, not as mealy or thick as other stouts, goes down pretty smooth. Mouthfeel leaves a little to be desired but that may just be my taste, i like carbonated brews and shy from porters which is what this reminds me of rather than a stout.

The aroma is roasty from malt and coffee, with dark chocolate notes, a touch of wood and some licorice. The taste is of a deep roasted malt, some coffee and chocolate. There is a hint of peat or some wood. The flavor tails off a bit in the end; finishes with a lemony tea like taste. The feel seems fairly light, especially towards the end, for a stout and has prickly carbonation. The beer remains bitter on the palate throughout. A very tasty stout for 5.2abv.

Gorgeous black with a 1/2 inch dark tan head that sat like a permanent fixture on top of the glass and laced it all the way down. Slightly coffee/chocolate roasted malt flavor in the nose and in initial taste, but the flavor soon expanded into a myriad of different things that raced across the tongue. Everything was there--the coffee, chocolate, licorice, even a hint of hops bitterness but definitely not hoppy. Roasted and rich and extremely drinkable, this one was a keeper. I'm usually not a fan of beers with a lot of extraneous ingredients (esp vanilla in my stout--thank you Dogfish Head). But the little extras in this one really set it apart in a good way.

It's quite unique and still pretty strong after over a year in the bottle.

Aroma is of chocolate milk, roasted malts and smoke. Taste is nice - I really like it. Starts chocolatey, then there's a brief showing of roastiness followed quickly by the chicory smokiness. My only knock on this beer is it's lackluster finish and thin mouthfeel - if it was only a bit creamier it would be superb! Drinkability is high - despite the thin mouthfeel, I enjoy the flavor enough to warrant having a few.","jpro","Feb 12, 2010"

3.68,-1.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The color stands throat-deep in very dark brown, with even deeper blacks creeping up the legs. On its head is a cap of light ecru that fades fairly quickly, leaving a galaxy of individual suds and accompanying ring. The scent is roasty and toasty with a slight smokiness pulling some strings in the backroom. The taste emphasizes the toast over the roast and perfectly balances a subtle hoppiness and a meek toffee-and-nuts flavor. Beneath it all, the chicory punctures the crust, allowing an herbal lava to ooze out nicely, settling into a tasty archipelago. Though it feels almost heavy on the tongue and coats the mouth well, it is smooth enough to make the experience enjoyable.","TMoney2591","Feb 02, 2010"

There are some cocoa powder chalky flavors, there is tons of roasted malts, there are also some charcoal slightly harsher flavors. I'm getting the chicory and the chocolate in balance, with some coffee grain in there too. The beer is fairly low ABV, which is probably a good thing for a complex stout, and easy to drink. There are some bittersweet chocolate notes, the cherry-ish chicory flavors are very subtle. The beer is dry in parts, bittersweet in parts, but with some sweeter malts interlaced.

This beer produces very little lacing to the glass, it slowly works it's way down to the liquid on each sip. It's black in color with brown highlights, very dark beer. The smell is good, clearly has a lot going on. Smell of both chocolate and coffee slight hop at the end. It has a good, but very complex flavor. Like the smell, you can taste both the chocolate and the coffee, malts are also very present and this is well hopped stout. It has a smokey finish. The mouthfeel is pretty good, it's the slightest bit too carbonated, but still a pretty good mouthfeel. The drinkability is good. All in all I like this beer, very tasty and complex.

Medium to full in body, fairly high in carbonation for the style, weakening the body. Decent beer, some unique flavors, but nothing too complex. I imagine some people would really like this and could do a nice session on it.","vacax","Nov 21, 2009"

Very dark brown in color, falls just short of black, touch of metallic orange at the outermost edges. Light roast to the coffee bean and dark chocolate notes in the nose, the chicory a little less obvious than expected, multi-grain bread, not much of a fruit presence, not hops for that matter, texturally comes off as dusty. Medium-bodied, same dry, dustiness pervades the mouth, like if some coffee grounds got into your mug. Dark chocolate as if unsweetened. Moderately more chicory-led bitterness here. Carbonation stays the middle course. As in the nose, no real fruit presence, same for spices, citrus. Solid enough but definitely monochrome. The overall dryness detracts from mouthfeel.

I found this beer a bit too astringent at times with an off-beat sourness that made it all a bit less palatable. But in terms of the roasted chicory and organic Mexican coffee bean flavours, this beer is pretty up front and in your face, almost overbearing.

The retention as a collar was pretty good and the lacing in a pattern like torn curtains. The aroma was of roasted malt, nuts, wood and light spices. The flavors were a bit odd, the roasted malt seem to being competing with the spices and herbal hops. Again, wood and nuts but neither was distinct. Mildly peppery.

I would suggest this beer for someone who still wants beer with a fantastic aroma yet not a huge robust and thick body.

A one-finger thick head of creamy, tan foam settled a bit, then lasted throughout the entire glass. Excellent lacing. The aroma consisted of freshly roasted coffee, caramelized sugar, and a light, herbal/mint note. The flavor also showed a nice, evenly roasted coffee note, followed by caramel, a bit of chocolate, a hint of licorice, and a very mild hop bite at the finish to even things out. Mellow and quite tasty! The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had moderate carbonation. This stout incorporated each flavor evenly, without the coffee overpowering the subtle sweetness.

A lot of the time I object to this kind of water quality in other beers. I'm always complaining that some breweries don't treat their water correctly for the style but this seems about right for an American Stout but would be way wrong for and IPA or anything. Any chicory in there must be very mellow. I've only had oaked beers before and this is a lot lighter in wood character. It mostly comes out with the roasted malt to bring out some sweetness and round out some of the edges. This also seems radically underhopped for an American stout. Overall, this is a good beer but it's a little too close to my crappy homebrew, which makes me think something is wrong.","wiseguy142","Dec 27, 2008"

The appearance is good, not quite pure black, but close, with a tan head and good lacing. The aroma is a bit funky though. It's hard to pin point exactly, but it's almost like a blend of dark berries and metal. Usually when you stick your sniffer down into a nice, dark stout, you come out with coffee, chocolate, and roasty aromas. In this one, the fruity, herbal, metallic notes seem to dominate. I don't think I would be opposed to those aromas if they were secondary to the malts, but the fact that they take over leaves me a little dissatisfied. The taste is also a little off. This is a perfect example of a situation where there are multiple flavors, but instead of blending together in harmony, produce a strange, mixed-up cacophony where it is hard to tell just what you are actually tasting. The aftertaste is one of raisins, prunes, and port, which I kind of dig, but then when you take another sip, you lose the mild, semi-sweet dried fruit flavors and go right back into the metallic and almost astringent taste that I'm not a fan of. Now of course this is just my opinion. Some may find this beer very intriguing, (and probably the brewers knew they were going a little off the beaten track adding chicory to the kettle) but I find it a little confusing and not quite my bag. I'm a big believer in a well-rounded, well-balanced, harmonious beer. This one is just a little out of whack for my taste buds.

It's really amazing that the taste is so well represented in a beer. If you like Chicory (and I know quite of few of you don't) try this beer.

Finishes with some pepper and hops. Medium light in body, smooth with lots of coffee bitterness.

The look is nice with a medium fluffy head that comes just short of the bone white of the bottle description. The head and look would probably benefit greatly from a nitro tap. The smell is a bit light for the style. A nice strong smell is a hallmark of a good coffee stout. The taste was a harsh roasted flavor with a fruity undertone. The chicory is know for being less smooth than coffee and that comes through in the beer. I have to say that I prefer a nice smooth coffee infused sweet stout ,but this beer is interesting and different.","mhaugan","May 15, 2008"

My mouth just doesn't pine for that next sip as it does with beers with more substance.

Overall this was a very good stout, but it wasn't nearly as unique as I was expecting. I'm not sure exactly what chicory is supposed to taste like, but I didn't taste anything unusual in this beer.

The head is thick and grayish tan in color. The scent smells exactly like roasted coffee beans. There are notes of smoke and charcoal as well as a dark chocolate sweetness. The taste is very similar to the aroma. This beer tastes like carbonated espresso with its signature bitter finish. This flavor is not altogether unpleasant but, to me it was not very drinkable.

Grains, chocolate, coffee flavors up front. Oily yet somehow crispy mouthfeel. No detectable hop presence; an odd combo of flavors afoot that bewilder and gratify the taste buds.

Small cocoa colored head. Moderate aroma of roasted malt and a slight coffee tinge. Somewhat vague flavor-ok roasted taste. A hint of chicory-sort of mocha like. Slightly burnt bite in the finish. Average body-sort of thin for a stout. Pretty average all around for me. Some DFH beers I love-others I just cant get my liver wrapped around. This is the latter.","lackenhauser","Dec 29, 2007"

2.95,-20.9,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Pours the standard American stout black with a light brown head -- but not much of one. It rises to about a finger and diminishes in seconds to a ring. Fairly weak aroma -- not as pungent as I'd expect, but some faint dark-roasted coffee notes and not a lot else. Taste is a vapor of coffee/chicory beans wafting from the mouth to the nose with some astringency in the finish that tastes similar to the bottom of a cup of Maxwell House. A little bit of chocolate on the palate as well with a moderately creamy undertaste. Mouthfeel is pretty thin and watery. An easy drinker at 5.2, but really, who wants to? Nothing terrible, but certainly nothing to go out of your way for.","eberkman","Dec 25, 2007"

4,7.2,4,4,4.5,3,3.5,"The dark brown body was capped by a three finger thick head. The smell was coffee like as expected, since chicory is often used as a filler in coffee. The taste was much different than the smell suggested. There was a roasty bitterness here, but it was quite subdued, and was matched by a chocolate sweetness. Quite light on the palette for the style, and soft in texture. Easy drinking and approachable, but had it been a little stronger, it would have been far more memorable.","rajendra82","Dec 08, 2007"

Poured with a tan colored head that dissipated into a thin skim with a ring of foam lingering around the perimeter of the glass. Color was a dark, opaque brown, almost black; with red highlights in the light. Presented with a smell of malt and coffee upon opening. Once poured, released a subtle smell of chocolate. Coffee was somewhat masked by an earthy/smoky flavor. Mouthfeel was somewhat watery with a little bit of astringency, although not really due to the alcohol content. Drinkability was average at best - better representations of the style out there.","Jwale73","Dec 05, 2007"

At least it isn't vanilla flavored.","boogles","Dec 04, 2007"

The taste is definitely very coffee-like, although I'm not sure if that's the chicory or the "organic Mexican coffee". There is also a bit of chocolate taste and some roasted maltiness. Either way, it's really quite tasty and I'm surprised there isn't as much hops bite as I expected. It's very drinkable for a stout and the mouthfeel almost feels like a soda.

A large 2 inch light brown head rests on top and dies down slowly leaving a thin layer on top with plenty of bubbles. Smell is doughy, with a creamy cup of coffee aroma and some sweet malt.

4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours black tinged with brown and with a nice initial head that fades to a thin cap and ring. Some okay lacing. The smell is dry and roastywith dark roasted coffee and a light herbal bitterness. The taste is similar, but deeper than the aromas. Deep dry roasted notes, herbal and coffee bitterness, and a piney note are all there. Mouthfeel is chewy, but not big nor particularly creamy, instead its very dry. Pretty tasty. The chicory lends a note of nutttiness and the hops are a little more present than in other coffee stouts. Those qqualities combined with the drynesss make this one a little diffferent and probably more suitable as a companion to many savory dishes. Nice.","Georgiabeer","Nov 20, 2007"

Finish is somewhat lackluster and lacks the intensity of flavors that I initially experienced. Mouthfeel is ok, body was fairly thin for the style. Drinkability was fairly good.

Smells like toasty malt and coffee. Tastes like burnt malt, chicory, and coffee in pretty much equal parts. Fuller in body. I like it better than I remember, though it reminds me more of a porter than a stout. But I'm not sure I'm so keen on the addition of chicory.

Not much to it, actually. Taste is nice and roasty - lots of coffee & chocolate, maybe a little hop bite as well. Mouthfeel is thin/too carbonated - needs more creaminess.

Veers towards tart and vinous fruits. Molasses residue with maybe licorice and tobacco in the finish. Overall, a little tarter than I like (think raspberry dark chocolate).

Maybe it was me, but the flavors seemed to get stronger as you get to the bottom of the bottle.

3.9,4.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"I am from New Orleans and chicory is commonly used in our coffee down here. Chicory is a root that when grinded down into powder is added to coffee for its bitterness and preservative qualities. I have always been impressed with Dog Fish Head and when I saw that they had a Chicory Stout I just had to try the beer. I had this one out of a 12oz bottle and it pours near black in color with a light tan colored head. The taste is wonderful and has a coffee/espresso note. I found that this beer improves in flavor and drinkability as it warms up a little. I recommend taking one out of the fridge about 5-10 minutes before drinking so that it is not as cold when served. I was very impressed by this stout and highly recommend it to anyone. The only reason that I rated the drinkability as a 3.5 is that I personally feel that the unique flavor of this beer is captured by drinking only one bottle....one evening I had two of these in a row and I found by the second bottle that the flavor was not as enjoyable.Overall, a very good and unique stout!

Smell was weak at first, but improved as it warmed: roasted coffee, chocolate, and a hint of smoke. Taste is predominantly roasty, little in the way of hop character, with a distinctly smoky character that a friend said reminded him of bacon - not a descriptor you often hear for beer!

There's is no question the there is coffee present here. I'm not exactly sure what the chicory is, but there is certainly a faint burnt wood aspect to the smell, as well. I am very pleased so far. Taste starts of with bitter chocolate and coffee beans, and then turns sweeter toward the middle.

At a glance the stuff just tastes burnt, but it really is wonderfully complex and refreshing. Mouthfeel is a bit dry, and has a bit of a champagn feel.

A fairly dry finish, some bitterness from malts but nothing from hops come across in terms of flavor. My biggest problem is the carbonation level which I found to be way too high.

The smell is quite nice, with heavy chocolate notes and rasins, mixed in with the burnt malt and the slightest bit of hops. The taste reflected the smell somewhat, though it seemed much flatter and a bit too thin. There was no prevailing flavor on the front, and the back seemed a bit alcoholic, though it wasn't enough to consider it offensive. The aftertaste opened up a bit, with some tangy yet bitter malts seeming to come through in the vapors. A pretty run of the mill taste.

The flavor at the beginning is different. I have never had any chicory before. It isn't earthy really. Maybe it is a little woodsy tasting, sort of a coffee bitterness. Not the most exciting stout I've ever had but it is decent. It has a mouthfeel that is just a bit too watery and light for what I would expect.

Oddly, no lacing. With such a thick head, I expected lace. Smells of breads, roasted malts, bitter chocolate, chicory, and coffee. Something else is in the scent as well. Not quite sure what, but it reminds me of... Barbeque? On first taste, my tongue recognises what my nose did not. Charcoal. After that, oh, so that's what it was moment, my tongue also tasted coffee, bitter chocolates, chicory sticks, roasted malts and bread. There is a difference between the taste of malt and bread in this beer. The malt is more grainy, while the bread has a chewy feel to it. The aftertase is a bit oily. Buttery, perhaps?

It's got that same bitter, metallic, burned tang to it, along with a sour black licorice flavour. While I like the look and smell of this beer (heavy dark fruit, coffee, herbs, alcohol) it's just too off-base for me tastewise. Yup, just too astringent, as a previous reviewer put forward.","TerryW","Oct 03, 2005"

Coffee aroma is quite pronounced, earthy hops and a little wood & smoke. Moderate bitterness, with coffee starting things off. Sweet flavour with a bit of acidity, sour fruit and licorice starts at the midpoint. Dry, roasted finish that melds with the other flavours, but the astringency gets to be a little too strong after a while. A bit slick with a fairly light body. Moderate carbonation. Good drinkability especially if coffee stouts are your thing, but the astringency was a little too strong for me by the end.","DrJay","Oct 02, 2005"

The head and the body are both thin and a little too relenting. But the flavors are melded nicely. Sweet roasted malts with bold coffee and cocoa flavors round out nicely. Hops and roasted grain combine for fair bitterness. A creamy mouthfeel aided by lactic acids make this beer slide right down. Slight grape or plumb flavors chase the carbonated finish.

Some smoky woodiness is there as well. Mouthfeel is thinner than I would have expected. Flavor is full and big, but somewhat unbalanced. The flavors simply do not flow well.

Actually, to a small degree, it resembles a chicory flavored coffee. The taste is dry and bitter, grainy, and a little slick-oiliness.

Aroma consists of burnt and smoked malts. The hops were almost not present at all, this is a very malty beer. The taste was just overwhelming. It is not a terrible taste, but it is extremely smoky. The best way I can describe it is my uncle makes these smoked baby back ribs, and they're really good, but you can only eat a few before the smoky taste gets to you. I will not be having this beer again, but I'm glad I tried it. It was a struggle getting thru one of these.","Jacobob10","Sep 07, 2004"

2.68,-28.2,3,2.5,3,2,2.5,"Poured a nice Tan head which made me laugh as it says right on the bottle "...beneath a bone white head." Anyway for a stout a tan head is acceptable though I thought the brown hints of this brew made it a little unappealing visually even though it was very black and completely opaque. The aroma reminded me of dirty wood with a slight roasted grain finish. Not very pleasant but not indicative of any fault in the beer so I gave it a 2.5. The taste was very smooth and there was a very nice finish to this beer. That woodyness is present in the beginning but only as a background to the upcoming blend of light sweet malt and a very smooth, clean roasted malt flavor. This beer has a lighter body than I like in a Stout and the carbonation detracts from the flavors making the carbonic bite take away a lot of the in the initial rush of flavor. This beer is one that is worth trying but not one worth mentioning to anyone unless you are trying to dissuade him or her from brewing with chicory. The chicory taste is like a woody, dirty coffee flavor that is only semi-pleasant as I appreciate the attempt that the brewer made and I also appreciate the diversity on the shelves this ale presents.","RenoZymurgist","Jul 28, 2004"

I just now drank the 6th (about 3 months after the originals) and it seems like a different beer. The flavors are bolder, maltier and sweeter.

Much more chocolate than I would expect. Hops provide a nice counter balance of bitterness to the sweet flavor but no real flavor in themselves. A creamy coffee taste comes back in the finish along with some bittersweet chocolate. My problem with this beer was the fact that all of the flavor that I mentioned had an astringency to them. This was esp. true relating to the coffee. It almost seemed like the batch might have been infected with something. I don't know, this could've been really good but something went wrong and threw a nasty astrigent flavor in with all the other flavors.

The flavor is surprisingly reserved and balance. I'm used to Dogfish Head stuff being over the top, but this is actually reserved, but just a little more flavorful than the typical stout.

Its head is thick, creamy, and retains itself incredibly well. The nose is varied, with notes of roasted coffee, chocolate, some hazelnut and tobacco. Taste is diverse, as well. Big notes of roasted coffee beans, chocolate, macadamia nuts, and spicy hops are evident. The overall flavor is a battle between sweet and robust, with the sweetness of the chicory and malt reigning champion over the roasty coffee flavor as the beer warms a bit. The finish is long and complex as would be expected. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side for a stout. This is a unique brew, as I've come to expect from Dogfish Head.

The aromas that came from the glass were of dark malts, some sweet malts, dark fruit (faint), coffee, chicory and a hint of burnt chocolate. The aromas seemed to be more complex as it warmed. Better. The taste was very similar to the aromas. Tastes of dark and sweet malts, creamy chocolate, roasted coffee, chicory, dark fruits (as it warmed), roasted nuts and hints of alcohol. And also like the aroma the flavors seemed to get more complex as the temperature rose. When served cold it is not too bad a little rough, but when allowed to warm up, all the flavors blended together to produce a really good flavor over your tongue.

It has some smokey grain, coffee thing going on, nice hints, but not enough for an eyebrow raise. Felt a bit creamy and finished a tad lighter then I was expecting.

The taste is primarily a sharp bitterness of harsh roasted malt and hops with the softer flavors taking the back seat coffee, cream, and chicory. It's not what I was expecting from a brewery capable of WWS. Two different worlds I know, but even the body is too light here, I am just not digging this one.

The strong smell actually set me up for a little bit of a disappointment. Heavy, dark maltiness came through in the taste, along with the licorice or chicory detected earlier. But the end result was a somewhat weak stout. A decent taste, but a little dry, and very little hop presence. The mouthfeel was definitely a little too light for my taste in a stout, too.

This one has a good amount of bitterness for the style.  Definitely different, but not something I would try again from a bottle.","beernut7","Jun 04, 2002"
3.65,-2.1,4,4,3.5,2.5,4,"Stout? More like a mocha porter. The addition of coffee made this too thin to be a stout. This beer tastes pretty good but got a low review from me due to the adjuncts used. I hate it when brewers add coffee or chocolate to get a desired flavor. These flavors can be acheived by the types and amount of malts used (like SN Porter or Rogue Shakespear Stout). Also, I don't want my beer to be drugged with caffiene!!! At least the description on the bottle stated that it had coffee added unlike some other beers.","Longstaff","May 30, 2002"
3.57,-4.3,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Bottle claims "bone white head," but actually it's quite tan and short-lived. Interesting stout, with some great coffee flavors and some dark bitter chocolate. I think it could stand a bit more of a sugary flavor. The beer is quite bitter, initially from hops but then a lingering, rooty finish that I'm not wild about. Very thin body, it grips the tongue but lets go too quickly. Some very good flavors, esp. coffee, but eventually the beer veers off to a greasy, dirty taste that I can't recommend.","Thrasher","May 08, 2002"
4.42,18.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Smell of roasted malt and hints of coffee.  Black/opeque color with a moca colored head.  Sweet roasted malt flavor with hop bitterness.  Slight acidity/sourness with a vague coffee finish.  This one is very complex.. and you will enjoy it more and more the deeper into the glass you go... and yes even when you have your second....","frank4sail","May 02, 2002"

3.95,5.9,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a deep dark black/brown with only the faintest bit of light getting through in the corners and a nice creamy head that sinks but never disappears completely and a nice clinging lace.  The smell is of roasted malt, coffee, and some chocolate.  Taste is slightly bitter from the chocolate, coffee and roasted flavors.  The mouthfeel is slightly creamy and very smooth and it is a very drinkable stout.  This beer reminded me almost of a cross between SA Cream Stout and Redhook Double Black.  Since I really like both of these that is definitely a very good thing.  I really liked this stout, about the only improvement I could think of was to thicken the flavor some and make it a little creamier.","Murph","Apr 18, 2002"
3.88,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours near opaque in color with a creamy brown head with little retention.  Aroma is a little on the sweet side for a stout.  I get licorice and coffee on the nose.  A nice lace is formed while drinking this beer.  Creamy texture.  Pretty interesting taste.  Different than most stouts I've tried.  While it is bitter, it doesn't seem like a roasted malt bitter so much, but rather, some exotic coffee bean bitterness.  I also get some licorice on the buds.  This stout has a little fire.  I like it, don't love it.","Bighuge","Apr 05, 2002"
3.43,-8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Notes: An ok coffee stout, some flavours just don’t seem to mesh well together. Astringencies get in the way and become a nuisance to drink.","Jason","Apr 02, 2002"
4.33,16.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The bottle touts flavors of coffee and chicory with a bone white head.  Poured a beautiful black, with a tan head.  I got no coffee in the flavor at all.  I've had chicory coffee, but I don't know that I would recognize it in a beer.  Fairly thin for the style, but was exceptionally smooth and easy to drink.  Hard to pigeon-hole.  Not dry or smoky like an Irish stout, not particularly sweet or creamy like an English, certainly not dense like an imperial, and not hyper-hopped like many American interpretations.  This is simply one of those beers that is so enticing that, before you know it, you are looking at the bottom of an empty glass.  When I finished the first I was eagerly anticipating the second.  I don't find a lot of stouts with that kind of drinkability.","Brent","Mar 10, 2002"
2.9,-22.3,3,3,3,2,3,"Thin and uninspiring. Contained none of the characteristics typically found in a stout. This is more like a light bodied porter.","John","Oct 22, 2001"
