4.85,18.3,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,"Poured from a fresh growler into pint glass, pitch black color, a finger of mocha head that disappears quickly. Moderate carbonation, medium body. Not as thick as I thought it would be, more oily and smooth. Not a bad thing, though. Aroma is vanilla and sweet caramel, with hints of roast coffee. Taste is the opposite, roast coffee and dark chocolate forward, with sweetness underneath as a smooth balance, not too bitter. The coffee has a definite roasted note, not burnt. Beautiful balance, one of the smoothest stouts I've had.","Tripel_Threat","Feb 05, 2015"

The java coffee flavor domintes the start to this but after a second a nice sweet vanilla note joins the flavors and pairs nicely with the coffee. Slightly roasty and dry finish. Some chocolate notes as well. Overall, pretty good.","kbutler1","Jan 01, 2011"

The nose is quite nice with a lot of cream and vanilla plus a good deal of coffee. Some roasted malt lingering in the background. The flavor is a bit too cloying as the vanilla and cream start to take over a bit. Still, nice flavors lingering in the background and I like the addition of the coffee, which makes this much, much more drinkable than Southern Tier's Creme Brulee. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy and the sweetness works here. I like this version better than the Imperial.","Thorpe429","Jun 20, 2010"

But the Kuhnhenn version blows the ST out of the water IMO. I like the ST because of it's high ABV but the Kuhnhenn just tastes that much better. A lot of coffee and a lot of cocoa.

Taste is a wonderful balance of vanilla creme, chocolate and roasted espresso. This beer is everything that I was wanting. Much different than the Southern Tier version. This beer is much more approachable and drinkable. Very creamy and smooth on the mouthfeel.

That's fine, 'cos the beer is the bomb on the nose - excellent, this is what Southern Tier should have done. Brilliant vanilla, butterscotch and chocolate, but to keep things from getting cloying, there's some coffee and a gorgeous roasted character, both of which (along with the chocolate), lend a balancing bitterness to the beer. On the palate, this beer opens up with the same flavors - moderate vanilla, some butterscotch, caramel, chocolate and coffee. The roasted bitterness provides the necessary backbone for this beer. The m/f is great too - medium-light in body with soft carbonation and a great sweet/bitter finish. I drank about 20oz and could have gone for more!","DefenCorps","Mar 27, 2009"

A fair amount of stick clings to the sides of the glass here and there. Smell is just sublime. Vanilla, toffee, egg nog, caramel, and bittersweet chocolate. A good amount of smokey malts and coffee beans as well. Just a delight to stick your nose down into. Taste starts off with a big explosion of sugary coffee with lactose and butterscotch. Midway some slightly burnt toast flavors and dark chocolate emerge on the tongue. The finish is nutty and sweet with a toffee glazed almond taste. Body is somewhat thin but still creamy and soft. Carbonation is light in the mouth but enjoyable. Another one of those ""I want to take this to work"" beers. I can't find a touch of alcohol anywhere making this way too easy to put down. This is a zillion times better than Southern Tier's Creme Brulee because it's actually drinkable, why they have the same B+ score is beyond me.

I must have had it built up so much in my head that this was bound disappoint. Brought to me in a pint glass out of a nitro pour. The appearance is nice - thin, tan head over deep mahogany, dark brown. Smells like vanilla cake/frosting/cake batter, burnt sugar, & roasted malt. Aside from the malt, it smells like a creme brule. Taste is vanilla sweetness up front followed by some bitter espresso & malt, but then there's a bizarre sour flavor that hits like cheap coffee - very odd. The mouthfeel was very watery, this needs to be creamier. With all of this taken into consideration, this is not very drinkable. It was actually difficult to finish.

The coffee, chocolate, burnt caramel (creme brulee) flavors were there in the aroma as well as the taste, and the beer was awesome! I set 3 aside to see what age would do...the results were not good. The beer took on a vinous, sour taste after 2 months and by 4 months it was undrinkable (poured 2 bottles out, after sampling). Definitely, this beer is to be consumed as soon as posible and should not be put down for future consideration...unless you mean to put it down by shooting it...like Old Yell'r (sob....sob...).

Taste is actually reasonably well balanced between coffee and fruity (cherry?) tartness, sort a light lambic thing going on. Mouthfeel is average, maybe a bit above, with smoothness overcoming the sourness a bit, and drinkability is okay. Just have trouble believing this brew is supposed to be like this.

It's sour, and I think I better gobble this up before it gets any more sour, as it's barely tolerable now. Perhaps it's just a bad bottle. Not sweet at all, and not stoutish at all, this reminds me of the Reaper Ale with the wierd sourness.

The stout works beautifully with the coffee and carmelized sugars. Sweetness with roasted notes. It takes you on an interesting taste journey through the glass. Have when fresh. A repeat visit some weeks later would cause me lower my ratings by 0.5. I think this is one of the most solid efforts by Kuhnhenn. Very smooth mouthfeel.

Heavy cream, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel, molasses, and then the hints of hops and roasted malt. The aftertaste is cocoa sweetness with a touch of hop bitterness. Caramel and dark chocolate lingers on the tail end. The flavor draws out for a good while, and you could really stretch a pint of this beer. Very easy to sit and savor, but just as easy to have more than a couple. The mouthfeel is just ultra creamy, silky, sexy. I considered skipping my flight for this beer, but thankfully they provided me with a couple bottles for the trip home. This is that beer that falls into the top 1% of beers you drink.

Its aroma is an overwhelming espresso medley, not even beany, this wins big points considering the vanilla undertones. I rarely encounter them without this usually unpleasant beany aspect. Strong chocolate complexities make this a total dessert brew. Strongly carbonated body, medium in size. It has pleasant sweet and tart vanilla essence notes that match the chocolate in an overall sweet flavour profile that doesnt quite match the aroma, but this remains a surprisingly good stout.","Rastacouere","Mar 29, 2005"

It wasn't quite that, but still good. The beer was very dark brown, reddish up to the light, with a light brown fat head that settles down to a thin layer which lasts throughout the glass. The aroma kind of got to me. It took me a few sniffs before I was OK with it. I thought it smelled like sweet sweet coffee with the slightest creaminess, some sourness, and covered in dust from some attic. Really, I got a weird musty smell mixed in with the roasty desserty goodness. Tasted better than it smelled, thankfully. There is a highly acidic flavour which helps to balance out the sweetness and roastiness of the beer, so no one taste is overpowering. I got a dry, almosty fruity (grapey?) aftertaste. Not bad. Mouthfeel was good and creamy, not too thick though. Drinkability for me is not the best- I would maybe have this again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get ahold of a bottle. Mainly because the sour musty smell kept punching me in the face, and not in a real good way. The taste made up for that a bit, but didn't cancel it out.

The aroma screams of strong dark roasted colombian coffee beans, roasted malts also come into play. There is also a slight hint of vanilla in the background. The taste is all roasted coffee. Bitter and acidic. There is also a sweetness in the background and hints of vanilla bean, sugar, and perhaps even the creme brulee that this brew is named after. The mouthfeel is light, considering all of the flavor that is packed into this gem. It's also acidic and a little lactic on the tongue. One can certainly tell that a double/imperial version of this brew beefed up to about 10%abv with a thick-ass mouthfeel would be legendary. Hopefully the brothers Kuhnhenn take note! Drinkability is good as well, but not perfect. The mouthfeel and acidic sweetness of this could get annoying after a while.

I love the look of the dark beers, and this one doesn't dissapoint. Nice chocolate mix with toffee creme head. After all the beers I sampled at the World Beer Festival yesterday, this was the most unique. The combination of flavors and smells was off the planet. Vanilla, coffee, caramel, creme, malty, thick and yummy!!! Sweet, but not sickly sweet. I would love to have this with creme brule'. Wow, what a beer!","finepaws","Jul 27, 2004"
