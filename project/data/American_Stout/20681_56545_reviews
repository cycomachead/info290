"These ratings are for the Nitro version of Mean Old Tom."

"Nice, well made dark beer. Flavors work well together. Touches of coffee and chocolate but not much. Front of palate is hit with a sweet, almost cherry taste and the vanilla flavor settles after. Tan 2 finger foam laces the glass. Smooth but clean mouth feel lingers for a time after finishing."
""
""
"Wonderful in appearance and texture. The chocolate is there without tasting like a piece of candy and the coffee does not overpower the finish.  Great on a  cold day."

"Dark, roasted, and bold at first, then a very smooth aftertaste to end. Great stout. Can't detect much vanilla though"
""
""
"Beautiful dark color not dissimilar to coffee, with a nice dark brown head that dissipates quickly unlike an Irish stout.  A light hint of vanilla on the nose but mostly toasted malt notes, cocoa, coffee and toffee.  The mouth feel in concert with the flavors are almost immediately reminiscent of a classic egg cream soda.  It's the carbonation of this beer that really do that.  It's uncanny actually.  It was the first thing I thought of upon my first sip.  Nice long finish and lingering aftertaste.  Really a fine stout."

"You can't go wrong with Main... ever!!"

""

"Overall:  Wow, what a great stout!!  Tons of roasted malt and brown sugar-like sweetness and vanilla, wrapped up in an extremely smooth beer.  Delicious!"
"Would prefer a stronger vanilla taste as opposed to chocolate. Smooth stout with sweet notes"
"I was happy the vanilla was not overpowering....it was nicely balanced."

"Pours a dark brown with thick white head. Smells of chocholate also hints of vanilla and caramel. Taste is dominently chocholate with slight hints of the vanilla bean. Some dissapointment as would have preferd more vanilla. Has just the right amount of carbination and drinks very smooth. Overall solid offering from Maine."
""
""

""
""
"Any beer than can incorporate hints of onion peel and pepperoni, paired with all the expected coffee-like, vanilla bean flavors, is impressive to me. This beer is probably underrated, but why? Maine Beer Co. does everything large. Recommended."
""
"Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate and faint vanilla. Thin tan head with a pitch dark body. The vanilla takes a back seat in the overall taste profile here, gives this beer a slight undertone rather than a sweetness. Which is a good thing all things considered. A very good beer - carbonation and roasted malt comes together. Almost a porter mouthfeel - not overly thick."

"Another winner from the Maine Beer Company."

"On nitro at Blind Tiger New Year's Eve party. Super coffee flavor and very creamy. Excellent."
"Cheers!"
"Overall its a decent beer, probably would not purchase again. Doesn't ""stand out"" exactly but it isn't a bad offering either."
""
"I don't understand why this beer doesn't receive higher marks, very well-balanced with a solid vanilla flavor.  One of the best Maine has to offer imo."
""
""
""
""
"More coffee and chocolate in taste with vanilla in the nose. Was hoping for a bit more creaminess in mouthfeel and more smoothness and vanilla in the taste. Surprisingly tastes more like a coffee stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a lovely black color with a beautiful two finger head of caramel colored foam that sticks around for a while. Nose is a little underwhelming, a nice roasted stout with just a hint of vanilla. Taste is simply fantastic. Nothing super strong, but a complex meld of roasted malt, coffee, and just a touch of warming spice, all finishing with a pleasant vanilla aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. Feel is rich and creamy with a proper carbonation level. This is a bit pricey, but the quality of the ingredients is evident in the final product. It's certainly worth a try."

"O-   Overall  it’s a smooth beer that’s very drinkable. I’m slightly disappointed with the flavor, I expected more. I will try this one again in the future to see if there is any change. It will be interesting to see other reviews on BA. (I don’t read them before I review)"

"Maine Brewing doesn't make a bad beer by any stretch, but I was expecting something a little more assertive given the aroma presentation when I first poured it. Don't go into this expecting to be bowled over by vanilla. After the initial wave hits you, it turns into a relatively pedestrian (but extremely drinkable) dry stout. I consider it a bridge between a boring irish stout and the more aggressively flavored ""big"" stouts. Save for the oatmeal characteristic, this could easily be rebranded a porter. Which would be fine except Maine already makes an outstanding porter that Mean Old Tom does not want to be compared to."

"O: I was pretty excited to try this beer. Besides the great reputation of MBC, it just looked and smelled the part of a top notch stout. I mean, just smelling this thing was enough to put me in a good mood. Sadly, the taste and mouthfeel were simply not up to par. It is by no means a bad beer, its actually quite good... but the taste letdown is just too much. Well, that and the $7 price tag for a 16oz bottle, but thats another story."

"Pours black in body with khaki head that melts down the side of the glass. Aroma of cocoa, mild ash, tobacco, dirt, and burnt ends. Tastes of cocoa, burnt bread, tobacco comes through toward the finish and then cocoa And vanilla come back again. Surprising how smooth this beer is. Glad to see it isn't a booze bomb either. Very refreshing despite the dry tone of the flavors. Very good stuff."

"Bottle poured into a tulip glass. Very dark chocolate brown brew, nearly black, with little in the way of colored highlights and a large amount of creamy light brown head (for a stout). Aroma is assertive dark roast coffee and chocolate, slight floral vanilla and grassy hops (!). On the palate one gets more of the same, dark coffee and chocolate milk, faint butterscotch and red licorice. Starts quite sweet but dries out quickly, an interesting contrast. I am noticing a nice nutty malt character as well, a unique element for this style that is amplified over the course of multiple sips. Very smooth creamy mouthfeel, moderately thick with low to medium carbonation. Finishes roasted and very dry, peanut shells coming to mind. Very light citrus hops wink in and out (they use Centennial in this). The vanilla beans add a tinge of floral perfume and do not dominate the proceedings. Debates about price points notwithstanding (I think the ingredients these guys use and their entire approach justifies the cost, not to mention how freaking good the beers are), Maine Beer Company proves here that they aren't just hop wizards, although I imagine I will always prefer the hoppy stuff from these guys."
"O- Mouthfeel is there, but taste is of an average dry irish style stout.  I get no vanilla."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is very dark brown with a light brown head. The smell has a lot of malt to it giving off some very sweet aromas. The taste is full of dark chocolate and a little bit of espresso. Also the vanilla bean makes for a semi-sweet, very delicious finish. The mouthfeel was also nice consistency for a stout, not overly thick but with a very defined body. Overall I really liked it. I'll definitely pick up another one soon."

"O: Me likey. May be my favorite flavored stout due to mouthfeel and not overtly chewy malty notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Honestly, the weak mouthfeel is the only thing keeping Mean Old Tom from being a world class stout. The flavors are bombastic and incredible, and the addition of organic vanilla bean flavoring keeps this dark roasted behemoth balanced and smooth. Truly delicious, but not without flaws."

"Excellent taste with dark chocolate flavor blending perfectly with the vanilla. Very drinkable with silky mouth feel. Dark black appearance with strong, lingering tan head. Smell of chocolate and vanilla is dessert like. Paired with ribeye steak and jalapeño mash ended potatoes"
""
""

"A well crafted, rich not boozy interesting, yet not complex beer. I should have bought a second bottle."

"Poured a black body with two finger khaki head and minor lace patches with a coffee/roasted malt aroma that has more than just traces of both vanilla and chocolate (more vanilla than chocolate). Smooth, creamy, the roasted coffee edge is there for flavor and balance, as well as making the beer a little more fuller bodied and have a slightly dry finish, but it's the vanilla/espresso like sweetness (with some chocolate as well) that livened up my sweet tooth and led me to really like this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A quite enjoyable stout with lots of flavor all at a more modest (at least in big flavored stout terms) abv of only 6.5 %. This was a rather nice roastey and sweet treat."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An American stout that is more subdued than I am used to for the style. There are good flavours in here but I wish they were more pronounced."
""
""
""
"Well worth a try but unlike the other beers I've had from these guys I don't think I'd drop 10$ on another half litre bottle."

"Calling yourself an American Porter may mean, for the most part, employing adjuncts that the English don't allow or particularly care for, and that's the problem here. Maine advertises the vanilla - in the end, a sort of snake-oil salesman move - and fails on the Yankee hopitude front. There is indeed a special vein running through the majority of this brewery's offerings, but methinks this offering took one too many sick days when they were handing out the decoder ring for that."

"Pours a dark brown with a thick, 4 finger brown head and great retention. Aroma is coca, and chocolate shavings. Taste has a nice semi-sweet chocolate base but not getting much vanilla. Medium body at best, lacks a little but a good pick i think."
""
""
""
""
""
"O) This is my first sampling from Maine Beer Co., and after this tasty treat, will surely not be my last. Being readily available in my area, this could become my new go to American Stout. Excellent Brew."
""
""
""
""
"The vanilla beans add a nice creamy sweetness that for all purposes is subtle. However, the roasty stout base beer is a great combination of roast barley and deep dark chocolate."
""
""
"After having this on nitro, the bottled version is a tad underwhelming, but this is still a great beer."

"The mouthfeel is rather light with a tad chalky bite that makes for a rather dry finish. A nice quaff from a great Maine brewer."
""
"O: An enjoyable hop forward stout with strong notes of coffee with some nice vanilla creamyness. Body is thinner than expected but it is quite easy to drink. Recommend if you like hoppy/roasty stouts."

""
""
"Found them when I was in NJ on business. Wish I could get them in SC. Would be a nice dark beer to drink at sunset in the lowcountry heat."
""
"First Maine Beer Co. that I have tried. Very nice dark stout with a decent foam head. Smells of strong roast with slight hints of vanilla. The taste was more of roasted coffee than chocolate for me and the vanilla is there too. Hop bitterness to boot at the finish. The mouthfeel was where this beer worked for me. Medium bodied, smooth, soft like maybe velvet, clean, and so well-balanced. To conclude: I've rated this low abv stout quite high even though I prefer my stouts super strong in taste, thickness, and alcohol. Overall there was nothing I did not like about this brew and it actually took me by surprise. Very well done Maine Beer Company!"

"Gentle carbonation lends a smoothnes to the front end that is quickly, nicely washed away by burnt barley roughness. This segues into a semi-sweet finish of bakers chocolate, coffee, and fresh vanilla bean."

"Stout style creates an obviously dark appearance with nice head retention. Little to no aroma. The bitterness is rather subdued for a stout. Though the beer was brewed with vanilla beans, I also picked up on an almost salty chocolatey note. The mouth feel was velvety and incredibly smooth. Overall a great choice for the stout category, of which I am not the biggest fan."
""
""
"pours very dark with extremely dark head. lots of coffee vanilla on the nose, very roasty. flavor matches with some dark chocolate, and hops. light to medium bodied, creamy fluffy feel. very nice brew indeed. bit of brown sugar and milky sweetness. very drinkable"
""
""
"Pour is a dark brown with a tan head and a fair bit of bubbles. Nose is moderate roasted malt, notes of cooked coffee bean with a decent touch of vanilla and notes of dark chocolate. Taste is not sweet but does have a good bit of the vanilla. Light roasted malts, rich chocolate and vanilla, a marshmallow quality, well balanced and not sugary. Pretty well done! Medium body and incredibly smooth feel with gentle carbonation. Very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"This bottle was originally purchased to honor a friend who recently joined the ranks of the elderly. While I’m not sure if he enjoyed the homage, the beer was enjoyed with lengthy, nonsensical conversation. A second bottle was aged about ten months, which mellowed out the alcohol and the vanilla. Aged or not, this is an enjoyable beer that works as well on a warm day as a cold, windy, November evening."
""
""
"A pretty good stout with nice flavor and aroma in a lower-abv package. Very enjoyable and worth trying."

"M: Medium bodied, maybe a touch to much carbonation, wish I was a tad creamier"

"O - My first MBC. It was a good beer, delicious. Not a revelation, but well executed. I might have been a bit disappointed by the lack of vanilla notes if it weren't for the fact that it is so easy for those to become overpowering, and this was such a decent brew that I didn't miss them."
""
""
""
""
"They know dark beer at MBC, I love the King Titus porter, this one is pitch black big tan head forms thick and leaves fine even lacing. Aroma has dark chocolate malts, roasted malt brings out hints of coffee and the beer was aged on vanilla beans so therefore there's a define creaminess on the nose to bring it all together. Dark chocolate bitterness on the palate, creamy vanilla beans with a hint of acidic coffee notes from the dark malts because I'm pretty sure there's no coffee in this brew. No signs of oxidation bottled on 12/10/13, I'm okay with that it's a bottle I bought in Pittsburgh, yet MBC is not distributed here yet! The nose is magnificent the flavor is sufficient and it's a damn solid beer creamy smooth natural carbonation the palate goes down way too easily. Overall a very stand up solid beer that I will continue to enjoy when I have the opportunity to try it."
"After pour has a nice thick head and good initial smell. Vanilla is certainly present but not overpowering. I get some good roasted malt with coffee as well. Taste has some chocolate, light coffee, toastyness and only a slight amount of vanilla. Went down smooth but just wasn't as impressed as I expected to be from Maine. I'll be sure to drink a Lunch next time instead."
""
"Rich and roasty with a tangy hop profile and a good dose of vanilla. Faint coffee bitterness and flavor with a touch of sweetness. The dryness behind this stout really makes it that much more palatable. Quality roasted malts and floral hops with a glimpse of pine. Awesome mouthfeel with a velvety body and an elegant carbonation level. Good stuff!"
""
""

""
""
""

"O - Solid offering, reasonably priced, would recommend, but I have to say, leaves you wanting. Could use more vanilla, more coffee notes."

""
""
""
"O: A nice beer. A bit thin for a stout, but I actually enjoyed how drinkable it was as a consequence, and the complement of flavors was really nice. I was giving this beer credit for the vanilla that was nearly imperceptible, partly due to the bottle being slightly past its ""enjoy by"" recommendation. That said, I've typically not had vanilla fall off like that, so maybe there just wasn't much to begin with."

"Pours a nice opaque black with some tan head and a nice medium collar. Good lacing out of this one. Aroma is really deep roasted malt, some faint coffee, and earthy too. Taste is where the vanilla comes out. Vanilla up front, char and roasted malt in the middle, then fades into a sweet dark caramel. Nice thick body and low carbonation. Very good but the whole time I felt there was just something off-putting."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color. Off white forms and retains well. Aroma of coffee and roasted malt, not so much vanilla. In the taste, vanilla, coffee, smoke and sweet malts. Quite nice and coffee like. A bit of vanilla as it warms. Nice citrus hops with mild acidity. Medium bodied, well carbonated brew with vanilla coffee and hops in the finish. Tasty brew. Through and through."

"I pounded it, but I didn't particularly enjoy it. Like nights of youthful indiscretion, I kept my eyes shut. Maybe this is mean by Maine standards, but here in Wisconsin we, well, shit most everybody's nice. But still, this ain't all that mean."

"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/1/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big milk chocolate, vanilla, roasted malt, cocoa, light coffee, caramel, toast, oats, light floral, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast malt and vanilla notes with light hops; and good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla, toast, oats, light char, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, oats, vanilla, caramel, light char, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with light vanilla and hop presence; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn good stout. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. Vanilla was much more prominent in the aromas than the flavors; but it was very enjoyable offering otherwise."

"Bottle dated 7/2/13 poured on 12/27/13. Shared with Dad. Says drink within 90 days but whatever. Dark brown to black pour with a light brown creamy half finger head. Aroma of huge roast and light vanilla, some smoke, semisweet chocolate. Flavor follows the smell with big roast and semisweet chocolate, light vanilla, and lingering bitter roast lingers. Medium carbonation and light medium body. This comes off as a porter rather than a stout and with that expectation is very nice. Recommended for lighter stout fare for sure."
"On the flipside, it's very well balanced. This is a good beer, but my palate needs something a little more exciting."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The taste is much like the aroma with less emphasis on the vanilla beans and more so on the baked dark chocolate. The slightest touch of dry bitterness on the backside. Very nice beer."

""
""
""

"I've had this on tap and it was much, much better. Vegetal flavors coming through the palate and dominating pretty soundly over the light vanilla characteristic I've known before on this brew. What happened here? Minus points for really only the flavor, but I'm probably sensitive and it's still a good stout."
""
"O: Enjoyable stout that isn't heavy at all and is super easy to drink. A nice low abv at 6.5% makes this a nice stout to drink and won't set you on your ass. Each sip makes you want to keep going back for more and more. For sure I will be buying more of this in the future."

"Really enjoyed this - it's a medium-bodied stout with a lasting roast flavor. Very well balanced, not too high in alcohol, just a very solid beer. Some might say it's expensive for what it is - I believe I paid around $7 for the 16.9 oz bottle, but I justify that by comparing its price to what I might pay at a bar, though anything is more reasonable that way. In any case, this is one of the more well-balanced stouts that I've had recently."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, capped by a light beige one finger head. Average retention, a bit of lacing present. Robust roastiness, espresso and, accents of vanilla cream; slightly reminiscent of a vanilla latte. Bakers chocolate upfront and hints of cream; vanilla beans join in with continued dark chocolate notes. Finishes with big, bold roasted malt, espresso notes, and ample hops smoothed out by returning vanilla notes. Moderately carbonated, heavier side of medium bodied; bordering on full bodied. Smooth, velvety on the palate; exceptional. Overall, this brew was much more bold and robust than expected. A nice enjoyable surprise."
" A crisp, jazzy, up-beat side to an aged stout! roastie nuts, mild chocolate, vanilla and cream, maybe a hint of peanut butter and rum in the finish. Dry, earthy hops provide a nice balance. Complexity is good, but the flavor's could meld more, lay this one down for 3 mounths and we might just have a true epic."
""

"This is an ordinary stout that is gets taken to the next level by the vanilla beans. Very drinkable with medium mouthfeel and a very nice coffee like finish."

"Bottle. Pours dark brown with long lasting, foamy beige head. Aroma is of toasted malt, sunflower seeds, vanilla, chocolate and dark fruit. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is of toasted malt, burnt grain, vanilla, coffee, chocolate and hints of dark fruit. Long finish is bittersweet. Delicious stout."

"This is an extremely approachable stout. I was hoping for more vanilla flavor; instead, I was left with a strong burnt toast, toffee, and coffee finish that was far less dominating than in other stouts. This is a very creamy and smooth brew, and is one of the better-priced offerings from Maine Beer Co."

"O. Very rich and tasty. Not too tart. Very good stout."
"Froths up past three fingers of loose foam, mostly larger bubbles, lots of dimpling, very dark brown coloration, the lacing is wispy but has stickiness to spare. Pitch black liquid, perhaps a touch flat and not a lot of shine, you can see little pin pricks of carbonation as the bubbles reach the surface, otherwise opaque. While there’s a good deal of roast to the nose it is not overdone and allows the chocolate, vanilla and licorice to sweeten things up, date and fig fruit, dose of candied nuts, lasts well without losing its relaxed feel. Medium-bodied plus, has a pleasingly dry texture without sacrificing flavor. Cocoa, milk chocolate, coffee more than vanilla. Carbonation keeps it refreshing not fluffy and soft. There’s plum, cherry and light fig going on. At times there is some booziness, odd given its relatively light ABV for the type. Comes up with a bit of mineral and earth for depth. Fashioned in a classic style, has length and cleanliness. Leaves you without much to say, preferable to just enjoy it."

"Is this a stout or a black hop IPA? Couldn't finish in one seating so I put in the fridge overnight. Finding the tanginess went away. This kind of stout had me at one time saying ""I could take 'em or leave 'em"". Bottom line for me is this is not sweet or creamy-should it be?!? Basically bitter coffee and bakers chocolate with vanilla extract. Every stout has it's place."

"Poured into a goblet. Born on date 8/26/12. Color was a very dark dark opaque brown, with a nice 1 finger creamy light brown head. Head thinned out fairly fast, but left a thin layer with plenty of lacing. Aroma was very slightly sweet. Subtle chocolate notes, but very faint, with a bit of brunt vanilla. Flavor started off sweet, than developed a bit of tang, with some earthiness that hung around in the mouth. Mellowed out a bit over time which made it more enjoyable. Felt ok in the mouth. Definitely hung around for a while, coated nicely, but left a slightly strange feel at the back of the throat. Definitely showed potential, but perhaps needs a bit more time to mellow out."

"Wow! I loved this beer. I was looking for something different to go with my steak. I grab it off the shelf warm brought it home and poured it into the glass. It poured dark and creamy. The foam stayed thick and creamy for as long as it took me to drink. I smelled just a hint of vanilla with chocolate. Tasted malt, and chocolate at first the more I drank the more vanilla I tasted. I do not know if they barrel age this beer but if they did I would LOVE to try it!! This is the first Maine Brewing Company beer I have tried but it will not be the last."

"Additionally, I drank this on one of the hottest days of the year, in the middle of the day, outside in my back yard out of my favorite tulip glass. Maybe it was because of its thin body (thin for a stout) or maybe because I left it in my fridge for a day, but it was a great stout to have in warm weather."
"O: This is a solid stout that I would buy again. I don't know if I would classify it as a dessert beer by itself, but the lower sweetness level might make it nice to pair with sweet desserts. The only thing I really wanted was some more of that vanilla to come through on the palette."

"Though the ales demeanor is bold and masculine, its not overwrought either. Its a sensible Stout with impeccable balance, vanilla intrigue and flawless in recipe design and brewing technique. But because of its perceived modesty, it'll never get the notoriety that it deserves."

"a near miss, something about the body rubs me the wrong way, it is smooth and has some fantastic characteristics but falls a bit short for me, maybe this needs to be had even sooner than the 90 days stated on the label ? that is a question for you to ponder my fellow beer pioneers..."
"O - This is a tasty stout with lots of roasted malt and coffee flavors. The vanilla bean aspect, while present, was a bit of a let down (I was hoping for a lot more). Very easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is great for a stout. Good rich body but not to thick. Carbonation is good."
"O – This is a very tasty stout. The vanilla really shines through but isn’t overdone at all. There’s a great roasted malt character to balance out the sweetness of the vanilla. I’m really glad that I got to try this one. Thanks, Frank!"

"Overall a nice stout, nicely balanced, good overall flavor. The vanilla brought a nice sweetness without being too strong. The smokiness was a little surprise, but maybe that is not the right term. Enjoyable, will drink again. On tap (had at the brewery), I would give it a slightly higher rating. It lost a fraction of something in the bottle in my opinion."
"very dark to black in color about 1/8 inch head and some light lacing. strong aroma,s of roasted malt and coffee. wow very strong, smokey, burnt roasted malt hits you some dark chocolate some vanilla in the taste. mouthfeel is light carbonation ok not weak didn't taste any smoother for the oats in the brew. a little to strong and bitter for my taste and i am not putting it down in any way."

"Mean Old Tom pours a black color, with a small lacing head. There is a roasted aroma, with nice hints of coffee and vanilla notes. The taste is sweeter, roasted flavors are present, with generous hints of vanilla and nice subtle coffee flavors. Nice full flavors, and very nice full body, subtle but noticeable flavors. Overall a nice creamy flavored stout."

"O - Not bad, definitely not great, if you really like dry stouts you may like this a bit more. I also am not a huge fan of hoppy stouts, and this is leaning in that direction. Vanilla aroma and flavor is fairly absent from this beer."
""
""
"Sweet vanilla kiss right off. Melds into a warm chocolate flavor with a bit of char on the back end. A touch of alcohol noted, but it is incorporated well into the beer, adding a nice touch of heat to it. This was a really good beer. Glad I added it to my wants. Thanks again, Jeff."
"a fantastic stout, im sure there will be a barrel version of this some day right? wow. it pours a midnight black color with creamy frothy thick off white head with fantastic retention. the nose is a big stout to me, the vanilla doesn't add much aromatically, somewhat surprisingly. big bitter barley malt and a hint of cocoa is all. the flavor is true to style, rich and creamy, not sweet at all, more bitter than anything, and the vanilla is also subtle, but natural. its less vanilla intensive than some others, which is just fine by me, it lets the malts really shine. big sturdy mouthfeel, soft and dry, full body, enough bubbles. this is one of the better beers in the genre ive encountered for some time. a really nice beer, like they all are, from maine beer company."
"A well balanced stout that could be a great one with less carbonation and more body. Definitely worth a buy or a try."

"Pours dark black, full 1/4 inch of tan foam. Sticks around the sides. Coffee espresso nose, hints of vanilla. Burnt wood too. Taste is a full malt bitter, coffee notes. Undercurrent of vanilla, especially in the aftertaste. Chewy. Real good."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its aroma. Here things were kept fresh, well balanced, inclusive, and cooling. The vanilla came out decently, with a great, simple, and heartily roasty stout base. This translated well through the flavoring, but some of the vanilla brightness did get a bit lost until the very end of the sip and aftertaste, where it gave sourness and eventual cleanliness respectively. The feel was silky smooth and creamy, aiding drinkability. The current trend is that people are loving all over Maine Beer Company’s more hoppy stock, but we think it is these sleepers that you need to watch out for."

"Pours almost black & thick looking with a khaki head of tight foam that shrank slowly to a couple of big islands on top. Soapy lace. Nose is cocoa, sweet vanilla beans, roasted coffee, grass & earth. A hint of char, medicinal alcohol that kept coming forward as it warmed and way in back some faint floral. Taste is smooth, on the heavy side but velvety. Vanilla, burnt coffee, burnt toast, roasted grains, bitter chocolate. I didn’t taste a lot of char but some and I am tasting some oats and some alcohol. Finishes semi wet and a little ashy. The hops were in there I can tell by the underlying fruit sweetness and a bit of slick oil that lightly coats the tongue. Bitterness is very light considering all that roasted toasted and burnt. This is a hearty and favorable stout that is not too complex and has a lot to enjoy."
""
""
"T: Opens on a nice coffee and roasted malt note. There's just a hint of acidity to the coffee but it's never so strong that it becomes unpleasant. Vanilla, burnt brownies, milk chocolate and some charred wood intermingle fantastically in the middle. Finish brings some light cola, smoke and dark chocolate. Nothing about this beer feels forced. The vanilla is very subtle, but adds a lot of depth to the flavor profile. Not the craziest stout out there, but this is a keeper."
""
""
""
"O - This is a solid, well-balanced stout. This beer isn't charting new territory but it succeeds in being a great stout where many others fall short. Appreciate it for what is: a stout, no barrel-aging, no crazy flavors. This is definitely a go-to stout when I want a classic example of the style. Well done, Maine Beer Company."

"Oil black, with small amount of tan head. Vanilla is evident in the nose, with undertones of roasted malt, and some dark chocolate. Drinks very smooth. Vanilla, dark chocolate, and a light coffee flavor dance around, ignoring the light hop bitterness, that sits on the side, like a 5th grader at his first middle school dance. Full bodied, but still easy to put down. Alcohol makes an appearance in aroma na flavor as the beer warms, but remains subtle (it's only 6.5%). I could easily drink this all night."
""
"Overall a good stout. Not the best but a pretty good example of the style. I'd have another."
""
""
""
""
"Taste steps it up a notch with a nice, clean drinkable stout with a moderate compliment of vanilla beans. I wouldnt mind a bit more sweetness to go with the beans, but I think MBC was going for an easy drinking, balanced beer here. Mission accomplished, vanilla additions are nice and would make a really nice cask ale to have a pint or two locally, but it just leaves me wanting a little more richness, sweetness and surprisingly - chocolate to compliment the vanilla."

"O: A solid American stout, and the vanilla, while not strong, does add a nice touch. A little pricy for frequent consumption, but worth trying on occasion."
"O/D - A nice stout. My frist from Maine Brewing and I was slightly underwhelmed based on their hype. Complex and tasty nonetheless. Quite rich, but needed some more vanilla."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Pretty drinkable. They managed to hit a good level of vanilla without overdoing it, and to integrate it well with the base beer. That being said, the vanilla can be a bit fatiguing in moderate quantities."

"D: This was a great stout. I didn't pick up as much vanilla character as I hoped, but the scent and taste were both still very enjoyable. The body was great, seeming more like a double stout. The finish was incredibly smooth, so it was very easy to drink. Doesn't need age, but who knows what cellaring may accomplish. Great refined brew. Recommended."

"Pours nearly jet black except for a tinge of ruby when held right up to the light,a creamy beige head atop that left a broken ring of lace behind.Vanilla and more vanilla in the nose,some dark roast comes into play as well as some chocolate but the vanilla wins out.It's roasted on the palate but I love the vanilla warming flavors,it's not overly sweet with a nice somewhat drying earthy finish.This beer is underrated in my opinion,it's warming with a nice vanilla flavor that isn't overly done,a great beer."
""
"Blackish brown with a thick and frothy head that rises up a full inch, and then settles out to a low cap with legs and ringlets rising up the sides of the glass. Rich aroma of darkly roasted malt and subtle vanilla. Rich flavor of roasty malt, somewhat smokey, bitter malt, cocoa, root beer, some hop bitterness, subtle hop flavors, subtle vanilla notes. Rich mouthfeel, but a bit slick, yet tannic. Really good beer."
"O: Quite good. The carbonation conflicts with the favor profile a bit, but overall pretty unique and very enjoyable."

""

""
""

"o: Other great beer from MBC, no surprise there."

"Really tasty vanilla Stout. The vanilla isn’t subtle, it’s definitely here and a big component of this brew, nice chocolate notes too. I’ve got one more bottle that I’ll sit on for a couple of months to let the hops fade out a bit which I think would help."
"O: Heck, I'd pay $7-8 buck for this again. Maine never disappoints. Welcome to DC!"
""
"D: overall i enjoyed this brew. wouldn't have hated for more of the vanilla bean aspect to come across on the nose/palate, however, still a good American stout."
"Overall: Once again Maine Brewing has done it!!! Another excellent brew that I will continue to enjoy!"
""
""
""
""

"This is a beautiful looking beer. It had an inch of thick, brown, fluffy head. The smell was pretty mesmerizing too. Very roasty and chocolatey. The taste was almost disappointing after that. It's good. Maybe even very good, but not mesmerizing. The chocolatey and coffee notes hit you first, but as your palate adjusts to their bitterness, it's a pretty straightforward stout. It's a very thick one with a lot of bitter notes. The roasted malt, the chocolate bitterness, and the cold coffee ground flavours all come together in a nice way. And maybe the vanilla bean flavour helps to mellow those out a bit, but I sort of wish it did more to that end. Breckenridge's Vanilla Porter may be catering to a different crowd with it's sweetness, but I thought it did a much better job of making the vanilla bean flavour a key part of the beer, at least. This one just screams of cold coffee flavour. It's still a decent stout, though. It, too, is partakable. Be prepared for a bitter, more traditional American stout, though. There is no sweetness here. I was wondering how something aged on vanilla beans could be ""mean," but now I know. Tom was indeed a rascal, drinking stuff like this. However, that hint of vanilla flavour that ties it all together and mellows out the flavour just enough shows that he had a soft spot for those willing to look for it. I may not have been expecting a bitter beer, but I got one and it's still worth giving a chance."
""
""
""
"The vanilla is a nice complement to a solid base stout. This is a restrained stout that can be enjoyed in a large serving, though the same restraint hasn't been applied to pricing, which makes it hard to recommend wholeheartedly."

""

"O - A simple addition to a stout that makes it intriguing."
"Tasted better towards the end of glass, I would serve it a bit warmer next time and let it open for a couple minutes. Good beer."

"Maybe perceived at first as somewhat of a simple stout, but well made and very flavorful. Something about this reminds me of the aroma and taste of a mash from a stout. Nicely done, now throw some in a bourbon barrel!"
""

"Overall this beer is delicious. Real easy to drink with a great balance of components. This one is probably very appropriate to be paired with a dessert like Lava Cake but works equally well with Beef Stew. Will definitely buy more when my local store stocks up again."

"A Very tasty stout. This is the best stout with vanilla I can remember having. Soft carbonation. Bottle from Capone’s. Great drinkability. Soft mouthfeel of dark black with bubbly head. Chocolate and roast aroma. Another great mastery by this brewery."

""
"This is a good beer from the Maine Beer Company. I would recommend picking up a bottle."
""

""

"This may have been one of the lightest Stouts that I've ever had, when it came to the alcoholic content. Downing this 1 pint, 9 ounce bottle was a joy and had I had the time, I could have had another in a sitting. Anyone who's new to this style would be well-versed to start out here, as this is strong enough to easily fit into this category while being easygoing enough to offend no one. A great example of why beers of this style are desserts unto themselves."

"Overall: I had feared the vanilla beans would be too much but I really enjoy the subtle nuance they add. A solid brew."

""
""

"Astringent, chalky, black, and bold...this is a fine American stout. It's utterly obsidian, with a light brown head. The smell is of highly roasted, but not quite burnt, grains. The vanilla also comes out nicely in the smell. Dry...very dry taste, which accentuates the grain. Full in body and very drinkable. Enjoyable stout."
"Inky black with a slight white-brown head. Smells like sweet malts, light brown sugar, fresh coffee grounds, and a little bit of lightly toasted vanilla marshmallow. It tastes like coffee, light chocolate malts, and roasted grain. The vanilla is very subtle, sometimes I get a hit of it other times I don't. Sometimes I get a little almost homebrew flavour. Fairly creamy mouthfeel. Overall its a little lighter than I expected, but its still a very nice little stout."
""
""
""
"Pour dark dark brown with a frothy two finger head. The smell is great, fresh ground coffee, roast malt, earthy tones. Taste starters with some ground coffeeness, some bitterness from it. The vanilla isn't as prevalent as I had hoped but you can taste it throughout. This was pretty good, great mouthfeel and smell were what stood out for me. Worth a try. We don't get this in Columbus so I'm glad I got to try it during a trip."
""
""
""
""
"O - a nice stout. I was hoping for a bit more vanilla but was pretty much what i expected. plesant but i was expecting something a bit more aggressive overall."
""
"O: Agree with some of the previous reviewers that something is a bit off with this. It's quite bitter, almost sour at times. Maybe aging would smooth it out a bit, but for something similar, I thought King Titus was better."
""
"O-a good dessert beer-clean and flavorful"
"Pours black with a creamy head, light brown, about the color of coffee with a splash of milk. Lots of fine bubbles. The aroma is a tad weak, but the flavors present are very nice. Light cocoa with some coffee and roast. A very well-integrated and strong but not overbearing shot of vanilla. Some of the sweetness is almost lacto in character, or perhaps I just expect that in vanilla stouts. Definitely tends toward the sweet milk chocolate side of things. The taste could be quite good, but it just lacks the necessary depth. Kinda washed out. I'm mostly getting a sorta watery vanilla milk chocolate flavor. It's nice and I appreciate the thought behind it, but this beer could be a lot better if the same flavor profile was just turned up in intensity. Mouthfeel is actually pretty creamy despite the somewhat watery flavor. It's a nice beer and doesn't diminish my excitement for MBC, but I'm a bit disappointed after trying Lunch, Zoe and Peeper."
""
""
""
"QUITE NICE; GIVE IT A GO!"
"Overall: 3/5 Ok beer, I expected more and was a bit underwhelmed, none of the flavors really stood out and the mouthfeel was a little thinner than I would have liked."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Especially as it warms, this is a great beer. Intense overwhelming roast bitterness couples with harsh unsweetened chocolate. Waves and waves of bitter tempered by some delicate vanilla. A little light on mouthfeel but smooth and not lacking. Light sweet vanilla on the nose."
"O: The label says you can age this. This particular brew is 7 months old. When you start drinking you can tell that something is off. It comes through in the finish. Then it really comes through when you begin to analyze the feel. This is an above average brew, but just barely. For $7.70, which was what I paid for this you can find much better stouts."
""
"O - This is a pretty good stout and the vanilla beans certainly add a nice touch. It is a fairly straightforward brew that is easy to gulp down. Cheers!"
"O: Maine Beer should turn this into an imperial stout -- even as a porter this would seem thin and short on character. More base malt to carry the roast and vanilla more as accents would be step in the right direction. Pretty disappointing for the price and especially compared to MO and Zoe (and even Peeper Ale)."

"Overall- So far from Maine Beer Company I've only had this and the Peeper ale and both have been very good for such a small batch brewery. I will certainly buy this again and I look forward to other beers they make. Im glad I tried this stout and I'm glad I reviewed it."
"Overall, quite tasty. Nothing spectacular but certainly enjoyable."

"500ml bottle: This one pours an opaque, inky dark brown. There was a small tan head on it that doesn’t leave much lacing. Nice nose. Chocolate, some roastiness, vanilla, coffee. Nice taste. Medium bodied, but still has a lighter feel even though there is a lot of flavor. Milk chocolate, hint of coffee, faint vanilla. Balanced well to have almost no sweetness and a hint of bitterness in the finish. Nice!"

"O: This is a nice stout with a good mouthfeel. Perhaps less hoppy bitterness would help it along but other than that I really enjoyed it."

"Verdict: A much simpler beer than I was hoping for, I thought the vanilla might take this to another level, but instead, it came off artificial and lacking complexity. It's not a bad beer by any stretch and was enjoyable to drink, but it's nothing too special."
""
"Dark brown, medium head, medium retention. Smells burnt and acrid at times; the roast is powerful in the taste as well. So charrred with only hints of vanilla. Tastes too tart because of the acidity... I think the roast is up there for a beer not so big and could have been dialed down. The beer is lost in it. Mouthfeel is right on though."
""
""
"Overall: Really enjoyed this stout as Maine Beer Company really seems to be doing all the right things."
"Kind of the quintessential usual old school stout, drinkable by yourself, not massive. Nice roast, solid chocolate presence, mild vanilla presence. A little hoppier than you might be used to for a straight up normal stout. Not thin, but not imperialized motor oil version of a double stout. Its what most people have come to know as a porter these days. This is a beer better of as part of a 4 or 6 pack, moreso than being in a 1/2 liter bottle. You can drink lots of it, and you'd want to, as its enjoyable for sure. Never had anything bad from Maine beer company. Still hunting for Zoe though. . ."
"O - An easy to drink, flavorful, and nuanced beer. Can't ask for too much more."

"O: An easy drinking stout that's full of flavor and complexity. Lots of things going on and none of them are offensive or overpowering."
"Really good stout, really hits on the flavors I look for, with the vanilla being a nice twist."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with light tan foam of soapy consistency. Smells of vanilla, licorice, cola, some cocoa, and a bit of coffee. Pleasant nose. Robust beer, nice bitter coffee character, toasted malts, hints of leather and vanilla. Nice and big without being a monster boozer. Full, velvety body with modest carbonation and a bilevel finish for me - slick up front, dry on the pharynx."
""
"I'd buy again. It's not the best that Maine Beer Co has to offer, but this is a very nice brew that in fairness should be rated more highly."
"Quality brew. Nice dark pour with a solid head and good retention after pour - cream colored. Aroma is heavy malt with a large presence of chocolate and coffee. Quality mouthfeel - nice and creamy. Taste is chocolate malt heavy with some mild spicing including presence of vanilla on the back end - the vanilla helps bring the chocolate forward."

"Dark roasted malts that are borderline burnt. Interestingly, little coffee flavor, but there's a bitter chocolate taste. Smooth mouthfeel with a decent carbonation level. The finish is mostly burnt malt flavors with a touch of hop. No errors here."

"16.9oz bottle with a bottled on date of 081212 081012. Pours a dark black color with an inch of frothy light brown head. Some lacing. Aromas of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, and a bit of smoke. The taste is of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, and smoke. Didn't really get any vanilla in the aroma but it's definitely present in the taste. Smokey, vanilla finish. Mouthfeel is a bit light for the style. Overall, well not as good as the other Maine Beer Co brews I've had, its a solid offering. Worth having again."
""
""
"The beer pours a lovely coffee black with nice brown sugar notes on the edges of the glass. The head is puffy and colored like sand dunes, though it dissipates quickly, leaving long spider web curtains of sticky lacing on the sides and a ring of sandy fat bubbles on the edges of the glass. The smell is lightly roasty with some slight chocolate and coffee hints, and there’s also a sweet and slightly sour tinge of vanilla in the back and base of the smell. The beer’s taste begins wonderfully with a sweet vanilla that turns slightly sour as it lingers. Coffee and roasted notes are definitely present as well, bringing some lovely smoky notes to linger like a little campfire in your mouth. Vanilla coffee with a lightly soured milk are the dominant flavors in the beer. Mouthfeel is slightly tingly with carbonation but velvety smooth and chewy on the tongue. The beer leaves the mouth with a light dew drizzle of saliva on everything and a slight smoky dryness on the tongue that begs for more. The sweet is a little cloying from the vanilla, but that just makes this beer more of a sipper than a chugger. The beer also seems like it might do nicely with a little cellaring. Overall this is a very nice vanilla stout with great flavoring and has a lovely mouthfeel. Definitely worth a sip."
"A very enjoyable stout. Too bad I brought back only one."
"Overall: It's not up to the standard of Lunch or Peeper but how many beers are? In the end, Mean Old Tom has enough flavor to be a very enjoyable pour. Another winner from MBC."
""
"Pours not the darkest black with a one-finger, greyish head. Roasted coco, malts and vanilla bean aroma. Flavor begins with sweet, creamy chocolate notes, before a dryer, roasted, bakers coco middle. Just slight hints of molasses and pine hops. Excellent fresh vanilla bean finish. Sweet, but in no way artificial. One of the best uses of vanilla flavor in a beer out of the many I have tried. Extremely drinkable and another awesome offering from Maine Beer Company."

"bottle"
"O- nice stout with roast, chocolate and creaminess."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee, cocoa, and vanilla beans. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with nice aromas and flavors that make it tasty and easy to drink."
"This beer poured out as a decent lookig black color. The head was a tan color. The head fades away leave just a film over top of the beer. The smell of the beer has a roasted aroma, with some chocolate notes, not really picking up on the vanilla like I had hoped for. The taste of the beer is roasted, it's got a toasted flavor it in the finish, not much of a hop profile or anything. The mouthfeel is dry and slightly creamy. Overall I was hoping that this had a little more vanilla to it. It's a decent stout in my opinion."
""
""
"A nice beer, very solid."
"Overall: Pretty solid stout. Has aspects of an oatmeal stout, so almost a hybrid. Nice though. Would maybe get again."
"M&D - Smooth and easy down with plenty of life on the palate. The flavor is complex without being overbearing, easily pairable with food and even sessionable. A great intro to this brewery for me."
""
""
"Pours a three finger light brown head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Black color no highlights, ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Vanilla nose and flavor is sweet vanilla and roasted coffee. Decent stout. $6.49 for a 500ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
""
"Pours dark brown, almost black, in color with a small off-white head. Roast is the dominant aroma here with a fair amount of chocolate and cocoa. Smells a bit...dusty? Some hints of vanilla, but not as much as I would have expected. The flavor is a touch watery and thin. Does have a nice chocolate and vanilla character, though. Good, but could have been better."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it’s a very solid beer worth drinking for a long time."
""
"I'm a huge fan of stouts, and this is a very good example. Not too overpowering, but you can definitely pick out the different flavors that combine nicely in the final product. Definitely a slow-drinking brew, but recommend."

"O: I'm glad I tried this because I did like it"
"Black body, beige head of a couple fingers. Moderate retention and a bit of lace. Nose has dark chocolate, cocoa, roast and a mild vanilla bean note. Tastes of milk chocolate, coffee-like roast, and vanilla bean notes are quite subtle. Medium mouthfeel, but on the lighter side of things. Quite nice in terms of carbonation though. A nicely flavoured stout, certainly revistable."
""
""
""
"Jet black in colour, about a finger of dense tan head, quite a bit of lace going on here as well. Smell is of cocoa and roast, a big dose of vanilla follows closely behind, coffee and milky chocolate with more deep roasted qualities. Taste is of roasted malts and chocolate, vanilla flavours start to come in and bring with them a bit of coffee as well, lightly bitter with some coffee and vanilla in the finish and aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, medium bodied and a decent feel as well. While this is not outstanding stuff it is a very flavourful and delicious stout that I found to be quite an easy drink."

"Good enough, and a nice night cap, but a somewhat simple stout overall. Maybe I should have consumed this one as fresh as possible?"

"O - Very good beer that delivers as promised and I'd definitely purchase it again. Even though this beer isn't classified as a coffee beer, it still might take the cake for my favorite coffee beer (even over the BBC Coffeehouse Porter)."

"For 8$ a bottle, it was worth a try but i prefer others in that price range."

"Pours a dark black with a creamy tan head that settles to a thin haze and solid ring, leaving behind spotty lacing. Sweet aromas of roasted malt, chocolate, and vanilla bean. Wishing the vanilla was more prominent. More flavors of dark roasted malt, bitter chocolate, and coffee-with-cream. Bit more vanilla then the nose suggests, but I'd still like more. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Overall a solid Stout, but I'll stick with their IPAs in the future."
"The beer is dark brown with a beige head that leaves ample lacing stuck to the glass. The aroma offers some pleasant roast and chocolate notes. Lots of tasty roast in the flavor as well. Light bodied and really easy to drink. I would have this again."

""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown, near black, cap of firm khaki head, decent lacing. Scent brings heavy roast from grain, light char even, bitter cocoa and baking chocolate, heavy roasted coffee beans, light berry like whiffs, moderate lingering creamy sweetness. Taste begins with big roast yet again, clouds positive notes of chocolate, coffee and berry and the vanilla is no where to be seen except a faint twinge of potent alcohol laden extract. Body thinner for style, carbonation moderate and beer has a faint graininess despite being mostly smooth. A decent stout heavy in roast and lacking the vanilla."
"Overall: Not a bad stout, but not overly exciting either. In the future, I would probably pass on this and just have some of the other Maine beers."
""
""
"O- Overall not much to this but I do like it. Incredibly drinkable, but it is underwhelming in the end. Not something to really try and pick apart, next time I'll just drink and enjoy."
""
""
"Overall-Don't know if I waited too long from the 11/10/11 bottle date to pick up on the vanilla beans. With the price $6.49/bottle may pick up a fresh bottle again as this is a stout that could be enjoyed any time of year. Wouldn't repeat trying to age it though"
"D - A very average American Stout... Text book for the style... Though nothing blew me away, this is a very solid beer... My biggest complaint is that for a brew that's aged on vanilla beans, this one had almost no vanilla to speak either in the aroma or on the palette... Solid, but uninspired would be best description..."
"O: I'm a bit disappointed that the vanilla seems completely MIA, but if I hadn't been promised that on the bottle I'd be quite happy with the drinkability of this beer. It does seem a bit light compared to some stouts, but it's got good flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good effort from a brewery to watch."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is average. I wouldn't seek it out again, but I'll have no problem finishing this 17oz bottle. I cannot believe this is supposed to be vanilla. This should be labelled as a stout, not a stout aged on vanilla."
""
"Overall: A solid beer. I was hoping for more vanilla which wasn't in the nose or taste. The beer had good sweetness and an almost total lack of bitterness. The beer didn't have anything which wowed but it had nothing that offended. A great beer to keep in the fridge."
"Beer tastes a little plain, the aroma was the best part, medium bodied, nice finish, a little bitter, dry, good mouthfeel and connectivity and a nice finish. I may have this again."
"Received as an extra. Poured into a half pint glass, my favorite glass. Its black, if held to light the edges are tawny brown, light tan head, plenty of lacing a nice looking stout, just rather poor retention. Aroma of coffee, bitter chocolate, charcoal, english yeast. Smells a little to estery for an american stout. No vanilla detected. Tastes like fresh roasted coffee, bitter cocoa, charceterful english yeast, again not much if any vanilla. Really very roasty malts This stout tastes slightly hollow for some reason and chalky. While there is something left to desire in the aroma and taste the texture is full and velvety. I was hoping for more from a brewery I really love. I mean I really, really love lunch, zoe, and peeper, mean old tom just fell a little short for me....sorry Main Beer Company, but don't worry I still love the rest of your products."
""
"Overall a pretty pleasant stout. My only real criticism is that although the flavors are not quite flawed, they are a bit muted. Based on Mean Old Tom, I'll try more of the Maine Beer Company's other offerings."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being below average. It felt a little thin and over carbonated for my tastes in the style. Overall it was a pretty good beer, nicely flavored and easy drinking. Very enjoyable overall."

"O: Another fantastic beer from Maine Beer Co. A great example of the style."

"O: a pretty decent beer, though I'd like more vanilla presence. It's very smokey and roasted and not sweet at all."

"This is good beer. The vanilla beans do not overpower in any way. Well-crafted american stout. I could drink this any day."
"Now what exactly ""aged ON natural vanilla beens"" is-- stout filled barrels placed on a pile of vanilla beans-- or stout filled barrels fed a few vannilla beans from time to time... good question."

"Overall a good stout with awesome vanilla tones. Just a little to thin and delicate."

"This is clearly a very well made beer. It is smooth and balanced, but not very complex or aggressive in the smell or flavor. It is an easy drinker, and does have some limited depth. Perhaps the vanilla comes through stronger when it is more fresh? This bottle came off a warm shelf, and was 3 months in the bottle. But, at $7 for a 500ml bottle, Cadillac Mountain at $5 for a 650 or $11 for a sixer is looking pretty good. Maine Beer Co makes nice beer, but I don’t think it is quite as good as it should be for the elite level pricing it sells for."
"Overall: A wonderfully balanced, drinkable stout. Way better than the bottle!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was let down by the taste after the expectations I had from the smell and appearance. It wasn't a bad beer, but I was hoping the vanilla would be a major contributor to the taste, and it just wasn't. The mouthfeel was extremely disappointing - it had no body, which would have added a lot. I doubt I'll be seeking this one out again with the number of other beers in this style that have great character."
"O- do something... fix the watery finish,"
"Poured into a Squatters True Pint glass a very nice black color, very nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger creamy light tan head, which leaves some very nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some vanilla notes, lots of chocolate/toffee. The taste is sweet, malty, with some very nice chocolate/toffee going on. Medium body, very nice smooth texture. Another very tasty brew from MBC. Thanks Bill!"
""
"O: This is a Sweet Stout at heart. Nicely roasted and sweet with a lot of milk chocolate. The vanilla is not as prevalent as I've hoped but perhaps this only helps to boast the chocolate flavors in this beer. The flavors are too subtle for my tastes but may be an excellent introductory Stout to people afraid to try dark beer."
"O: Very sessionable and very enjoyable - easy to drink and it tastes much bigger than the ABV."
"O: This beer really packs in a lot of body and flavors for a beer that has a relatively low alcohol content compared to other beers in the style. It is also very sessionable."
"Overall: Mouthfeel aside, a pretty solid beer in my opinion. Can't wait to try more from this brewery."
""
""
"overall - a decent stout, but I don't see the vanilla bean aging."
""
"Very dark brown, black appearance. Thick, foamy khaki colored head with fantastic lacing. Aroma consists of vanilla beans, rich milk chocolate, oak, cherries, roasted coffee, chocolate malts and heavy cream. Taste is milky, mildly bitter with lots of rich and smooth chocolate and roasted coffee flavors. Great notes of cherries, vanilla bean, molasses, malt and some hints of yeast and light hops. Sort of a sugar-cookie flavor towards the end. Medium to light body with mild carbonation. Aftertaste is mostly rich coffee flavors and smooth chocolates. Wonderful, fantastic American Stout."
"Overall: I enjoyed the roasty elements and the subtle vanilla treatment and think the chocolate comes through very effectively, call this a Porter and there would be fewer complaints about the mouthfeel, I think"
""
""
""
"Overall this was enjoyable, but as the vanilla is advertised, it lets you down on that front. No big deal. Still tasty. Just wish it had a little more body."
""
"My second beer from Maine Brewing and enjoyed it very much. The vanilla referred to on the label didn’t seem all that strong, but it brought out the chocolate flavors nicely. Also the mouthfeel was full and smooth and reminded me of some of my favorite oatmeal stouts like Doubly Down and Dirty."
"Dave"
"O-> Significantly disappointed by this one given the pedigree I have become accustomed to with the other MBC offerings. Also for being ""a stout aged on natural vanilla beans"" I got very little vanilla, if any at all. May revisit this someday from a different batch but not exactly jonesing to do so after this experience...maybe this beer needs more time?"
""
""
""
""
"A very tasty stout, just didn't get the vanilla. I like the woody flavors and light coffee but felt a bit thin. Still a must try though."
"500ml bottle served in a standard pint. 0105012 printed on the label. Pours one shade shy of black with a voluminous, 1.5 inch, mocha-colored head. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap. Some spots and strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses roasted malt, cocoa nibs, a trace of vanilla and a suggestion of either lactose or artificial sweetener towards the back. Taste consistent with nose; however, the flavor profile comes off a bit watered down and there is a slightly ashy char that reveals itself towards the finish and lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a crisp, even carbonation that leaves a mild, residual prickle across the tongue. Overall, a solid beer, but not my favorite from this brewer. Also, the $6.99 price tag on this brew is a bit of a deterrent from adding this to my regular line-up. Worth trying if the opportunity presents, but not something I need to seek out again."
"O - Overall this is a rather enjoyable stout. Really wish it had a better mouthfeel but the vanilla is quite nice and somewhat more than subtle. Not my favorite Maine Brewing Company beer but a good beer nevertheless."
"Poured from a bottle and served in a pint glass, the beer is an extremely dark brown coloring that is almost black in the depths. Pours with a thin, foamy, light brown colored head that remains a subtle eighth of an inch layer that retains throughout consumption. Aromas are rich and woody, with a slight coffee roast, creamy chocolate, and slightly charred blending. Smells complex and tasty. Flavors are also well blended, and come in a little more subtle than the nose prepares you for. Combined with the creamy smoothness of the body, this makes for an extremely easy beer to drink. The beer has an initial mocha coffee flavor, with more of the dark roasted coffee in the background. Some earthy and woody highlights throughout, with a chocolate profile through the backbone. The aftertaste is more of the bitterness from the coffee and dark chocolate flavors, with a touch of roastiness once again. The finish is smooth and slick, with a slight linger to the earthy characteristics. Very easy drinker, and solid flavor profile throughout. Very tasty!"
""
"O- This is a very mediocre beer. I want some carbonation before I decide if vanilla is present or not and regardless of vanillas presence I want alot more of it"
""
"overall- Somewhat dissapointed, it was a little over priced."
"O: Not as much to this one as I would have liked. A stout with vanilla beans brewed by MBC should have been something I'd go crazy about. No real off-flavors--just a bit bland for my liking. See what you think about this one."
""
"O - This one was ok. It has some good flavores going for it but it lacks the more substantial body needed to be great IMO. I won't turn down another but I wouldn't go running out of my house to get more."
"O: Much better over all after it warmed up some. A little pricey for the 500ml, and being a 'good' brew."
"O: All in all, I was hoping for more. It starts well, but needs some more tweeking to get the taste right. First disappointment from Maine Beer Co for me."
""
"Fuller medium body, somewhat higher carbonation, a bit creamy yet prickly on the tongue. If the mouthfeel was better this could be really good...still a nice milder stout."
"Overall: A decent brew that I would have again, but nothing special really."
"D - I appreciate that they've packed a lot of flavor into a relatively low ABV beer, but the flavor is a touch too burnt and the body is a bit too flaccid for this to be an unqualified success. Still, it's another quality effort from Maine Beer Company. I like that everything they release is polished and reliably good. Finished the 500ml bottle no problem."
""
""
""
"This beer was just ok for me. It looks fantastic and feels right on for the style but the flavors and aromas are just too muted. I'm all for being subtle and straightforward with simple flavors but this one might seems to need a bit more."
"Mean Old Tom sports a very dark look with a black color in the liquid and a dark brown foam up top that left minor splotches. Good retention on the head. Smell is fairly balanced with vanilla beans, light espresso, roast, a light chocolate and malt. No real hops to speak of. Taste is heavily favored on the roasty side giving Tom a porter vibe over stout IMO. Cocco, vanilla, roast, slight coffee/chocolate. All of these tastes are light though and mix very well. This is not a in your face type of beer as well Feel was in between light and medium, Very smooth off of the tap. This is some good stuff, no alcohol to be found and the tap just smoothes things out. Drinkable for two (maybe three)"
""
""
"Overall - Nice stout, if perhaps the least exciting beer from MBC. I enjoy the vanilla, but the stout itself could use another dimension."
"Overall: I had this on draft months ago at Jimmy the Greek's in OOB and the beer seemed more vanilla sweet. I liked it more on draft than in a bottle, but still a good easy drinking stout that does not leave you full. Would be interesting to see on nitro."
""
""
""
"Had a glass at Liberty St Tavern. Overall, a tasty and classic American stout. At least it's what a classic American stout should be. There's a big, but not too thick, roasted mocha flavor up front and a pleasant balance of citrus hops in the finish. I reminds me of Bear Republic's Black Bear Stout, but toned done a bit for greater drinkability. Excellent beer."
""
"D/O- Nice stout offering from Maine Beer Company. A little different than regularly available stouts around these parts. Would like to try more from MBC. Thanks 4DAloveofSTOUT!"
"Taste starts sweet, full of grain husks, continues rich in the middle, and closes with a wisp of vanilla and some light bitterness. Mouthfeel is extra smooth, and drinkability is easier than you'd expect. Nice brew, wish there was a bit more vanilla."

"O- A nice tasty stout that I would seek out again. Was hoping it was thicker and had more vanilla. Overall good."

"O - Where's the vanilla bean? It would have been perfect here."
"overall: very good, though was expecting / hoping for a bit more vanilla. i'd give it another go."
"O: No vanilla. None. Weird. Anyway this is a nice light stout. Flavors are roasted and a bit one dimensional but this is crazy easy to drink. I’ve had porters that taste just like this. Thanks again, Michael."
"o - Overall a decent stout. The nose was nice but the taste was a bit bland and watered down. If the body was a little bit thicker it would near perfect. Worth checking out but falls a little short in the taste department especially."
"An ok beer. I'm not a huge fan of the sweetness in the aftertaste and I wish a bit more vanilla came through on the flavor, but still glad I tried it."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer, just wish is had a bit more flavor and body."
""
"poured out a dark brown with a half finger of mocha colored head that fizzled out quickly and didn't bother to leave much lacing behind. nose picks up on roasted malts, a little coffee and some vanilla. taste is likewise, big roasty presence with some vanilla and a bitter coffee finish. mouthfeel could be fuller and the carbonation could be more, but this is still a good stout with a creamy feel to it."

"M: The ale goes down very easily, very quickly. Ten minutes max, I'm talking. I went in looking for Sucks and was more than happy to see this in its place."
""
""
"Roast malt and vanilla blend very well with each other. Woody. Flavors come through dull and flat though due to a thin body and lack of carbonation. Every other Maine Beer killed it in the mouthfeel department which is curious that Tom is so unappealing. Maybe that's why he's so mean."
""
"I do like MBC's bottles/artwork though."
"o: A very good stout. Not my favorite style in general, but this is very drinkable and is great on a cold winter's night like this one. I would highly recommend Tom, but it's probably not a case purchase like the Lunch IPA is."
"Pours a solid black color with a huge fluffy tan head that exudes great retention and lace. Smells of roasted grain, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, a bit of caramel. Smells nice like a stout with vanilla beans, but not to heavy on the vanilla. Taste is just what I expected from the aroma. A solid roasted grain presence with hints of vanilla and caramel. Medium body and level of carbonation, sweet slick mouthfeel. This is a great simple easy drinking stout. If these weren't 7 dollars for 500ml and available only once a century I might actually drink it more often."
"edit: WTF is with the reviews below? This is an American Stout, not a RIS or ADIS. C'mon people, review to Style!"
"Overall: Not dissapointed by this beer, but mildly underwhelmed. This is the part where I sound like a demanding little kid... I want MORE vanilla put into this beer, lots more vanilla! Its a sessionable stout that has some nice flavors, but they are fairly mild. Kick this beer up a notch and bring in more rich stout flavors. Mean Old Tom was not as mean as I was hoping for... In summary: its like guiness has a more shophisticated big brother from the state of Maine and his name is Mean Old Tom."

"opened the bottle and poured into a tulip. smell was awesome. nice rich coffee and vanilla aroma. took my first sip and found it thinner than i was expecting. at first it felt and tasted similar to Bell's Porter. thought it was good, but not great. let it sit for a while to lose a little of the chill and found i enjoyed it more and more as it warmed up. a good stout, easy to drink, but not mind blowing."
""
""
"overall a very nice, easy-drinking stout. no wow factor necessarily but no worse than a B+ range brew."

"Another line drawing on a well-designed label means another good beer from Maine Brewing. Nice color, dense head, waffley aroma with molasses and tobacco throughout; a good cloud of almost Swisher-Sweets smoke that does not repel (unlike the cigars...). The body is a tad thin and the bubbles are a tad brittle. Although MBC says this beer is aged over vanilla beans, I didn't smell or taste any more or less vanilla than any other porter. That might change with aging, which means buying a few bottles and hiding them for a year. Dang."
""
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style. My one beef with this offering is the lack of body to it. The lower carbonation is the only real knock. That being said, another fine offering from Maine Beer."
""
"Deep pour, nearly black with a two finger tan head. Nose is roast, coffee beans, some faint chocolate. pretty dry and subtle. Fairly thin mouth with lots of bubbles. Flavors focus on dry roasted malt, coffee beans through the palate and long on the finish, with a touch of unsweetened dark chocolate, faint vanilla. Dry and restrained, balanced. Nothing that will blow away the BIG BAL beer nerd, but this is super refined, balanced, and drinkable."
"Overall: This is better than many American stouts but nothing exceptional. I still recommend it, more so if the price were lower. There are a lot of better stouts that I can buy for less (per ounce)."
"Pours a deep near-black color with a very nice tan head and some good lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward quite a bit of chocolate and vanilla along with a touch of roast. Flavor goes quite a bit down from there with far too much roast. Simply an average stout profile. Medium body with good carbonation and a slight vanilla finish. Decent enough, but not something I'd go back to really."
""
"O: Love Maine's other products, but this one missed the mark. By no means a BAD beer, it just was a little lacking. I'll go B- for the overall."

"Another nice addition to beers available in PA. I can't wait to try the Peeper and Lunch which I have heard great things about."

"Overall: Nice balance and the vanilla adds a nice touch. Great depth of flavor without pushing too hard. Another solid take from Maine Beer Co."

"A good beer, but one that would benefit from the slightest increase in sweetness. Having said that, I realize this isn’t an Imperial Stout and I am not asking that it try to be one."
"Mean Old Tom is a rich, robust and bitter chocolatey American Stout. It's not overboard on any one aspect though I did expect a lot more vanilla beans than I got. Although, it seems unless you go crazy on vanilla bean aging it never imparts a big punch, unlike extract would. Still, this is a really nice take on a lower-ABV stout."

"Reminds me of a lighter version of Ballast Point's Victory at Sea."
""
"O: Overall, quite delicious. I'd definitely buy this one again."
""
""
"Taste: The vanilla beans are much more stronger this time."
"O - A decent example of an American stout. Body is a bit thin however. It is a fairly easy drinker. Smokey, acrid, burnt malt flavors take the lead with other typical stout flavors mixing in behind. Sadly not enough of the vanilla bean came thru for me."
""
"So I guess not everything Maine Beer Co. touches turns to gold (or Peeper, Zoe or Lunch). Womp, womp."
""

"very easy drinking stout. Not as mind-blowing as Zoe or Lunch, but another very quality brew from Maine Beer."
""
"O/D-Maine Beer Co. is one of my favorite breweries. Lunch, Zoe, and Peeper are among my favorites of their respective styles. Mean Old Tom is pretty damn good, but a slight step below the perfection of their other brews. I still really enjoyed this. Its drinkability is very, very high. Very happy to have a bottle. Nothing to complain about here, and dare I say its a tad bit underrated."
"Overall a solid stout."
"Mouthfeel has a medium body texture which is smooth but a bit bubbly at first but becoming creamier as it progresses. Overall, I really enjoy this stout quite a bit but it's not my favorite from the MBC lineup. Definitely would have again if the price was right."
"O: well judging by the appearance, this brew looked like it was going to be lacking in the flavor department. I was wrong. This beer features a wonderful use of vanilla beans. Great balance."
""
"O - A very enjoyable stout. I've had a bottle from both releases and enjoyed it each time."
""

"Medium bodied with a nice balance of roasted and sweet flavors. Lots of dark malt flavor with hints of roasted gourmet coffee, burnt toast, oatmeal and dark chocolate followed by a creamy lactic and sweet vanilla presence mid-palate. I was nervous that this would be a vanilla overload but there is enough of the flavor there without overpowering the stout characteristics. It actually serves as a nice balance to what would otherwise be an overly roasted stout. a bit tame and light bodied for my liking but enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Simple, straight-forward, and ultimately pretty plain. The vanilla didn't come through appreciably in the sip. Not enough body for my tastes, felt like a sweeter porter. Still not unpleasant at all to quaff. MBC has hoppiness down pat, but this stout wasn't the direction I'd hoped they'd take."

"A good solid version of the style. Does not seek to be over the top or overly complex, but still manages some nuances that are really great but subtle."
""
"Roasty nose, fluffy cream head and dense black. Very creamy in the mouth, almost milky, it would be a milk stout if it wasn't for the roasted malt. Perfect amount of hops. There is a bit of bright fruit as well, not sure what though, coconut? Maybe not. Nice amount of vanilla, not sweet but straight Madagascar bean. This would do great on a nitro tap. Medium dry finish. Half way through the glass the roasty flavor disapears and it mostly creamy. Overall a good beer, I would drink it more frequently if it wasn't for the price, this is more of a $12 a six pack beer then a $5.50 a 16oz beer. Excellent anyway."
"O - its a nice stout. i like how they arent trying to do something too crazy here. my only major complaint would be that i wished the vanilla beans were more present. still a fine stout however."
"O: Since this summer, I've been an advocate of MBC via Peeper, Zoe and (especially) Lunch, but this is a first tasting of Mean Old Tom. It's a good stout. It's straightforward -- a tad simpler than I anticipated, based on other offerings of MBC. I'll look forward to trying a more aged version and of following MOT to track its evolution."
"O: And with this beer I complete the MBC superfecta and it is another good beer. A bit thin for the style, but still a very flavorful and quite enjoyable."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. While the flavors are nice, they are a bit too mild and lacking the vanilla I was looking forward to. The mouthfeel as well does this beer no favors, as it is a bit thin and even watery at times. Cool label, though!"
"Batch #1. Frankly, I think the label just shows a Mildly Perturbed Tom... Anyway, it pours a dark sunset amber-garnet topped by about a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises dark chocolate powder, chocolate syrup, light roasted malts, dark greens, very light grass, and light coffee. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate powder, light vanilla bean, and black pepper. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta-kinda watery feel. Overall, a pretty tasty and enjoyable little stout. Frankly, I have yet to have a bad Maine Beer Company beer..."
"An average offering from Maine Beer Company. I can't say that I'd pick one up in my journeys, but it won't turn me off to trying any other brews that Maine Beer Company has to offer."
"Taste is light and smooth, a balance between a bite of bitterness/carbonation and mellow vanilla and dark malts. There is that molasses taste here, almost like dark chocolate as well. Mouthfeel is a bit light and watery. Finish is crisp and a bit bitter. Overall quite nice - even on a summer afternoon."
"O - Not overly complex, but smooth, even and consistent throughout the sip. My only criticism would be to thicken it up, but considering I'm drinking this one in the midst of a 90 degree day, the light medium body seems to be just right for situation."
"Another win for Maine Beer Co."
"The palate is not quite as nice as the nose. Silky smooth, this almost has some oatmeal characteristics here. Moderately roasty with a nice toasted grain character, there's a mild grainy bitterness that balances the sweetness from the vanilla and caramel. The vanilla isn't particularly noticeable on the palate, but the base stout is good enough to hold its own. The mid-palate is just a touch watery, a hair more bitterness would take care of that. Drying, roasty and mildly bitter on the finish, this beer is medium-light in body, moderately carbonated and as with the Lunch IPA, expertly conditioned. Either I'm just in the mood for a good, simple stout, or the rest of the reviewers don't know what they're talking about :-) My only complaint would be the price, and even that's a half-hearted one."
"A nice enough beer, if not exactly one of the superstars of the Maine Beer Company portfolio. Still, glad I was able to try this one."
"Overall impression - for the most part, nicely done. I'm convinced this would be better labeled as an American Brown Ale as it seems more in line with that style than a stout. To that end, I have to knock it a bit to style but I'll happily give it the benefit of the doubt."
"Overall – A pretty good beer. Damn quaffable, not overpowering. I would for SURE pick this up again if I saw it on the shelves by me (sadly not likely for a lonnng time)"
"O: Was hoping for a bit more vanilla. This is a solid beer that hopefully in future batches will have that vanilla boost. Another solid beer from MBC."
"The CPJ"
"Overall not bad, I appreciated the opportunity to try this brew. It is medium bodied and slightly thin almost watery with it's low level of carbonation.. It lends itself to being easily approachable and very easy drinking without the shock of big alcohol impact. I'd give it a try again."
"Anyone ever see them on tap?"
"Overall pretty good, very drinkable, decent enough hops, lots of vanilla as it promises, nice malts, perhaps a bit more body and chocolate would help, a nice bitter and sweet balance too."
"Nice enough."
"Decent enough beer, but not much to it. I like a shot of coffee in my beer, not the reverse, & that's the case here."
"Overall, this is an excellent stout - the vanilla adds the right amount of balance and sweetness to the roasted base. A little more body and this would be a world class American stout."
"I had the opportunity to try bottles before they hit the market at Novare, I wasn't overly impressed that night but it seems a bit better in the comforts of my own home and not ""ruining"" my palate with huge beers prior to trying it. Still though, I can't help but be a bit disappointed since Peeper and Zoe are a couple of the best beers that Maine has to offer."
"With all being said though, this is still quite a good beer for drinkability."
"Poured into a pint glass. The beer pours dark brown with a thin layer of light tan head that washes away quickly with thin lace. This is certainly a vanilla bomb. Mostly vanilla in the aroma with dark roasted malts in the background. I'd say too much vanilla maybe, but it's still pleasant to smell. The taste, much like the smell is borderline overpowering with vanilla. It's rounded out with mocha like flavors and a nice bitterness to the finish. I'd like this more if I didn't feel like I had to focus so much to get past vanilla. Real nice feel to this though, creamy and full with good soft carbonation. Overall, a welcome new offering from Maine Beer Company."
"D - When it comes to stouts, this is incredibly drinkable. Low ABV and delicious."
"The beer is worth a try hoped for better though."
"I should note that some of the flavors, textures and especially the appearance of this beer makes me think it could have come from a cask, but the menu did not indicate such, so I reviewed it as though it was a normal draft pour."
"New seasonal from the guys at MBC. Have eagerly awaiting this one... Pours a robust brown with ruby edges, a nice and hearty beige head, nice life, nice lacing. Really worth a few whiffs - the nose is subtle at first, with coco and subtle vanilla, followed by some mellow coffee and chocolate. Flavors meld so well - light roastyness allows the vanilla to poke through amidst the toasty coco and chocolate, with nice coffee undertones, nutty, and a dry and dusty hop finish. Low bitterness. Super smooth texture, nice and mellow, with the perfect dry finish to balance. For the style (stout) this is supremely drinkable. This beer has the nice balance of plenty of interesting flavors and complexity, while pulled off with subtlety, yet still remains a refreshing and drinkable stout. Can't wait to see what comes next."
"For a stout this great I'm astonished how they were able to have the taste and aroma differ but have it go together"
"D: Another solid offering from MBC, this definitely has some potential. Easily drinkable and not too heavy"
"D: Will the real Mean Old Tom please stand up? I'm really hoping this is it, because it's much better then my previous bottle experience. Nicely done first batch"
"drinkability: very good. nicely balanced flavor, could definitely put a few of these away."
"Not good enough to get again though, especially at the price of well over $6/bottle."
"D - The vanilla isn't overly sweet here and instead adds a nice accent to this fine dry stout. Quite enjoyable, even though it was dispensed from a trash can!"
"D - The stout is very good - a great tasting vanilla bean ale w/ low alcohol effect on the palate (relatively) for the style. This was very tasty and was just a good beer anyway you slice it"
"Vanilla, coffee, and chocolate malt in the nose. Similar taste with dark roast coffee dominating along with a nice layer of vanilla. Not the most complex beer ever but very flavorful. Drinks very well. Nice and smooth with great mouthfeel. A nice solid stout from Maine Beer Company."
