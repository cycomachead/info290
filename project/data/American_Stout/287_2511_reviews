review_text
"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Appearance: It’s dark and thick with a light tan head. The slowly fades out leaving just a ring of foam at the edge of the glass. Lacing is mostly slick. Smell: The aroma has a light toasted grain character with hints of almond like nutty notes and cherries. Taste / Palate: The flavor has a tart cherry roasted maltiness up front. As it warms I get more roasted coffee like malt notes. The finish has a mix of light tartness and bitterness. Carbonation and palate feel right on."
""
"Overall: Fail, at least with some age on it. I really needed to try this one fresh to get the true flavor but I can guarantee you that it should not be aged. The mouthfeel dries out too fast and there isn't enough body to sustain it in the cellar. The cherries should have stayed on the trees or gone into some nice preserves or something. Keep your cherries out of my beer please. Skip this one in the future and pay the extra money for the Bell's Expedition Stout; totally worth it."

"The look and the smell of this beer is fantastic, however, the taste is too tart for me and I did not like the texture of this beer while I was drinking it. If you like sour beers, though, you will enjoy this one."
""
""
""
""
"Maybe this isn't my cup of tea but the cherry tasted so artificial it made me gag. I am a huge stout lover but this was a bad representation of the style."
"Overall: I really, really liked this beer. The ABV is not that high and it goes great as a dessert or with some kind of chocolate or vanilla or cheesecake. I don't understand the low ratings on this one."
""
""
""
"Not much cherry in the aroma, smells like an aromatic, vanilla laced chocolate stout. The tart cherries hit you in the taste with dark chocolate, reminiscent of of a holiday boxed dark chocolate with sour cherry filling. At first it was a little strange for a stout lover who loves the roasted malt and dark chocolate, but after having a bite of whole wheat bread this beer truly shines. Not a session beer but is superb with a meal."
"This beer can't decide if it's a stout or sour."

"4th of the evening. Smooth, black, with a mocha head and a hint of amber. Smells roasted, bitter, tart, and tastes very much much the same. Best cherry Stout I've had so far, not cloying, artificial or overwhelming like others I've had."
""
"This is a smooth and very tasty beer worth every sip."
"A pleasant mixture of dark chocolate and tart cherry. Like if a stout and a wild ale had a delicious baby."

"if you like the taste of tart sours and stouts you should try this beer. it really is good I really enjoyed it"

"Cherry was too cloying, like cough syrup."

"Mouthfeel is thick.. Syrup like and pours out weird.. Even the way it rolls out of the bottle is strange.. Like syrup .."

"I can't believe Bell's put this out......  Maybe if this were going to be a sour stout, it might have been better, but this beer tastes unfinished.  The sourness of the cherry juice overpowers the rest of the stout.  I'm a huge sours fan, but this basically taste like a stout that was infected, and not in a good way.  I can smell the cherries and the roast, but that doesn't come through in the taste."
"I like Bell's but this was not good. There was absolutely no head when this poured and gave off a slight roasted malt and sour smell. The taste was medicinal cherry, chocolate and roasted malt. The flavors just did not mesh together."

"Bad taste.  Not what I thought it would be."

"Nasty, skip it, god awfull, did I say nasy. Worse than CAMO BLACK special resurve."
""

"Nice tasting stout with good reason to call it cherry.  The cherry is immediately noticeable.  Has almost a slight burn effect when drinking it which I liken to a whiskey."
""
""
"Pours a rich black color with cherry red accents visible during the pour. Once it hits the glass, the subtle red hue is barely detectable. An interesting and unique appearance, despite the lack of lacing or head retention. The scent is that of a silky porter, with chocolate malts and light roast. There's a sour cherry aroma hiding in the background. The first sip is surprising to say the least. The slight chocolate malt sweetness is absolutely crushed by  a shockingly sour flavor. A lemon-like puckering tartness  and vague cherry gives way to an ashy finish. The body and carbonation are thin, with little intrigue. Wow, pretty much a train wreck! It was as if someone poured lemon juice in to a nondescript porter, then emptied their ashtray in to it. If I didn't know better, I'd think this one was spoiled. Judging by the bottle date (11/6/14) and the other comments, this is the intended product. I nearly relegated this to drain pour status, but a part of me was really rooting for Bells, so I gave it the old college try. I must admit, I am not particularly fond of sours. After it reached room temp, it was considerably easier to drink. The underlying flavors of the stout became more discernible and attempted to keep the sour notes in balance. Attempt is the key word. Either way, this is one sour beer, and the flavor profile just doesn't add up. Ashy, tobacco smoke and citric sour cherry tartness are just an odd combination. Quite frankly, it just doesn't work."

"Tastes like dark chocolate covered cherries and toast. Great by itself and would be good with chocolate cake. Highly recommended. My 700th different brew!"
"Pours black with minimal head. Smells of roast malt, some chocolate and licorice. Cherry comes through on the tongue, slightly tart. Some chocolate, dark molasses, licorice, hint of coffee, and burnt toast. Medium body, a bit thinner than expected. Good beer that I found rather unique but not a standout by any stretch."
""
""
""
"Oily black, lacing brown. Roasted Choc malt, burnt ends, cocoa and backend Cherry. Star and finish tart, roasty choc middle. Interesting."
"Looked great.  Disappointing otherwise.  Smell as taste were reminiscent of something aged in bourbon barrels.  Rather thin as well.  Nobody is immune to a clunker"
""
""
"Sweetest stout I have ever tasted."
"There is just something off-putting about this beer for me.  I freely admit that I am a Bell's fanboy so I have tried Cherry Stout now a few times across many years, but everytime, I get the same sour, cloying aftertaste.  Not a sour stout like Funk Metal or Tart of Darkness, more like it was spoiled.  I have given up on this one and have moved onto greener pastures."
""
""
""
""
"Hard to finish.  Taste was overpowered by tartness."
"Sampled on tap at Surfside Tap House on Oceanside.  Full disclosure this beer had been on tap over 2 months so perhaps not the experience the brewer intended.  Pours a very attractive rich black color with a beautiful dark tan head.  Smell is dominated by chocolate with a bit of cherry sweetness lurking.  Wow- taste is surprisingly tart.  Maybe like a tart version of a chocolate covered cherry.  While I generally dig sours, this combination is a bit off putting.  Mouth feel is almost gritty.  Interesting but not something I need to try again."
""
""
""
""
"An enjoyable stout.  The tart cherry can be a bit strong at times but I think it mixes well with the stout body.  The body can be a bit beefier I suppose."
""
""
"Overall: I feel that this would have been better as a milk stout with more chocolate malt. Solid but not awe inspiring. A novelty but nothing I would do more than get a single of."
""

"Couldn't get past the fact that it just tastes like a puckering, infecting stout."

"Overall: it's not a bad beer if you are ready for tartness. The first sip of this beer took me by surprise arena was not enjoyable but a renderer that me pallet adjusted and it wasn't too bad. I was able to sip through it and enjoy it. Personally I wouldn't order it at a bar at full price and I wouldn't buy it but as a special at the bar and considering it is 7% it's not bad to have one and switch it up."
""
"Overall:  I love the tart Michigan cherries that Bell's is using in this, so I really want to like this beer.  However...  You do get the tart cherry notes... but it just isn't integrated in a way that comes together for me.  Maybe if there was more chocolate? I don't know...this is my least favorite of Bell's stouts."
""
"Not good. Too much sour cherry juice, not enough stout."
""
"Overall, this is more of a novelty beer than anything.  The cherry taste is contrived and achieves no synergy with the rest of the flavor profile.  The harsh prickliness is offputting, and there’s just not enough else there to overcome its flaws. If you want cherry, find yourself some New Glarus or a good sour ale."

"Overall- I can't say they didn't tell me what it was.  Still, it's kinda disappointing.  Not terribly balanced.  If you don't like big fruit notes, especially tart ones, stay away."
""
"do people really not like this? I thought it was a brilliant fusion of tart cherries and rich earthy stout. the fruit is maybe a little medicinal in the nose of this dark chocolate colored forthy tan headed wonder. sharp sting from the cherry and the alcohol is maybe a little much on the nose, but I think its pleasantly mellowed by the charred dark barley character and a hint of sweet cocoa. the flavor is better balanced I think than the nose, but equally dynamic. it is a stout first, lots of nice deep dark grain properties and a perplexing smoothness, while the cherries come on later. they marry well into the dark grain, a definitely chocolate covered cherry thing going on here, like those little ones soaked in booze you eat at holiday time. dark authentic fruit with enough tartness to almost trick me into tasting wild ale yeast or bacteria. its not though, its just piquant enough too, and clean in the finish for the style, not the least bit sweet. I like its complexity and its drinkability. it feels perfect with snow and chirstmas coming on, and like all bells beer, its expertly made. I would definitely buy this if it were available in Colorado."
"Nice tart, crisp cherry"
""
""
""
"I've found fruits are tough to do in beers most of the time and that's true with this one too. It just wasn't special and was a bit too tart."
""
"O: Not what I expected from a Bell's stout, much less a cherry stout.  The cherry was apparently code for sour stout, with some cherry qualities. I've seen this in six packs, and loving most Bell's I had reluctantly passed this up for others on the shelf. Glad I did, a pint was all I needed. Try it, but at a bar first before purchasing the 6-er"

"Straight out of the gate this one leaves me conflicted. I want to like this beer. It pours jet black and almost oily devoid of any carbonation or even lacing. It's nose is it's best feature, a malty sweetness with presence of coffee and cherries. It tastes like a nice stout with some great malt accompanied by coffee which introduces some bitterness. The second half of it's flavour quickly turns into a sickly sweet experience before the tart cherries finish it off. This is the part which leaves me conflicted. The stout by itself would be great, the middle is very off-putting and the cherries at the end just don't seem to belong. In the end the mixture of sweet, alcohol and tart is reminiscent of cough syrup. I have a second bottle and hope to revisit this after a better experience."

"Pours midnight black, a decent tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly with average retention, lacing is nice though, coating my glass from start to finish. Smell is classic Export Stout - roasted malt, chocolate and faint coffee - no cherries in the aroma for me (???). The flavor saves this one for me - a ton of fresh tart cherries up front, followed by roasted malt, chocolate, mild sweetness, and espresso. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and extremely creamy, finishing just a bit dry and somewhat chalky. Overall very enjoyable and tasty Cherry stout that is well balanced and definitely left me wanting to drink another. A great beer for the Fall season upon us."
"Its a different stout, not something I would crave but its not undrinkable. It is a good blend of the great Michigan Cherries with Bell's stout"

"O:  This is a great beer and is very refreshing for a stout.  Highly recommend and don't understand why it only has a score of 80 except that people may expect it to be a sweet cherry taste."

"Bottled 10/4/11, enjoyed 10/14/14. Appearance is dark black with a reddish tinge around the edges. Not much of a head to speak of. Smell is roasty & a bit sour. Taste is quite tart. I'm pleasantly surprised at how much tartness it has. There is a subtle sweetness from the cherries too. It's nowhere near being a cherry bomb, but the cherry notes really do add something special to this beer. As a stout it's got good roast also. I'd buy it again, age it again, and consider it pretty underrated at a mere 80 points BA score."

"The smell is fantastic! Rich and roasty malts with just a hint of cherry. The taste on the other hand is very tart and briney. I'm trying really hard to enjoy this one, but if can't get past the initial taste of olive juice type flavor. I personally think that the cherry juice needs to toned down a lot in order to make this one palatable. Glad I can say I've tried this one, but I personally didn't care for it and wouldn't drink it again."

"Good beer! Nice to have at the end of cherry season, too."

"The appearance and smell bring forth the stout. Don't get any cherries on the nose. Those came later on the finish; slightly sour, which I like. This beers starts out all stout then finishes almost all cherry syrup. Occasionally you'll get the stout mixed with cherry tartness - which is excellent. Good, but not great. Would like to try the barrel aged version sometime."
""
""
""
""
"D: Not very drinkable. Thin and tart. Does not hold up well to room temperature. This is cherry juice with a little stout, not the other way around, unfortunately."

"Dark black in color and impenetrable to any light. The head is minimal,dark brown,and does not cover half of the top of the beer. Aroma of roasted barley, along with more of a sweet cherry note that seems almost along the lines of a plum note. The sweetness of the cherries is on the front end and nicely transitions into a bitterness from the roasted barley. The mouth is pretty carbonated and creamy."
""
"Overall a really drinkable beer that I love and will definitely be buying it every year."
""
""
""
""
""

"I do give credit for cherries tasting real, but the cherries are almost too tart. For the price, I wouldn't get it again. Worth trying one time, though."

""
""
""

"O - Interesting beer, but I find the sourness somewhat distracting in a stout that, absent the cherry, would be offering a smooth lusciousness and very nice roasted malt characteristics. As it is, I'm glad I tried it, but pretty sure it won't enter the short list of my go-to options."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: I like what Bells tried to do here, but I think it missed the mark. The cherries are a little too tart, while (somewhat contradictory) the finish is too sweet. Good beer here and I'll revisit it in the future, but this just didn't do it for me the way most Bells Beers do."

""

"By itself it is pretty sour for a stout, but with some food, it is really good. It definitely is an interesting concoction and the kind of treat I deserve!"
""
"O: I am extremely disappointed here, but I still want to try the Java, Special Double Cream and Black Note (obviously). I don't think I'm going to be able to finish this. but will probably just share it with someone or cook with it."

"O- I enjoy the complexity of flavors offered in this brew, but I thought it was just a little too much with the coffee, smokey flavor, and sour cherries together. I really like the idea of a sour stout, and will be looking for beers of similar style."
"Thick black solid body. Nice lacing. Wet mouthfeel. Smells of sour cherries. Front palate is all port and merlot. Lots of sour cherries and some coffee bite mid-palate. Full bitter stout riding over chocolate covered cherries with some more Merlot. Lots of sour. It's real hard to make a consistent beer flavor with something this sour-- but they pull it off. Very drinkable despite the complexity. Not for amateurs. A real sour beer in stout form. 3.5 out of 5. Good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not necessarily a bad beer, but at $17.99/6pk, not at all worth the money. I really wish it was more flavorful and cherry-ier, as this would really accentuate the transition from sweet to tart. If I had paid $9.99/6pk like most of Bell's beers, I would have a much better opinion of this beer. Probably better on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Bell's is my go to brewery, when I can't decide on what I'm in the mood for. I love cherries and stouts, so I imagined this being a match made in heaven... unfortunately, it was far from that. I'm a guy that likes tart, so when I say it's tart - take notice... It is! Worth trying if for no other reason than to add it to your palate of tastes."
"Thanks to Illudium for the sample!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer isn't really that heavy compared to other beers in the style but has a nice mixture of cherry flavors."
"While I usually enjoy beers from Bell's, I was very disappointed with the Cherry Stout. I like both cherries and stout, but the BCS was, in my opinion, difficult to drink, as each sip left a lingering bad aftertaste on the palate. In addition, it was hard to taste the cherry juice. The beer tasted ""artificial"""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not something want all the time but a nice change of pace stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I think its great, I do warn you though its super tart, and the cherries really give your taste buds the blam style, but its still got that nice bitter chocolatey, malty background to remind you its a stout. If youre new, and wanting to get into stouts, I would recommend this to you! If youre not a ""sweet"" beer person, id still say try it! But just be warned its sweet and tart."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: I'm surprised how low this beer scores.  It's a very innovative and unique beer. People flavor ales all the time with cherry juice but they do it in a stout and pull it off.  Try it."

"Incredible beer, with an initial sourness that balanced with its cherries notes and strong roasted and hoppy base."

"Try it but it's not tart or sweet like you'd think for a dessert in a glass."

"A dark brown beer with a red tint and a nice tan head. The tart flavor was off-putting at first, but as I continued drinking it I began to enjoy the combination of tart cherry and roasty caramel. This is one I would revisit again, maybe after aging it some."

"12 oz bottle into rogue pint glass. Very dark, syrupy appearance when poured, light brown head that dissipates quickly. Chocolate/cherry/metallic nose. Label says ""Stout brewed with cherry juice."" This drinks more like cherry juice with a little bit of stout added. Strong, sweet cherry syrup taste. Interesting, but less than moderately appealing. It's an OK beer."
""
""
""
"Overall this one just doesn't strike my fancy. The cherry comes across a bit fake and subtracts more than it adds to the flavor profile. Thinking it would be better as a regular milk stout."

"O- Found it very interesting use of tart cherries, reminds me of a flanders red than of a stout. Still a pretty good beer if you like that style, which I do from time to time."

"O - Bell's cherry stout holds a well deserved place amongst an array of their stout releases. The breweries from Michigan I love call the cold months 'stout season' and its hard to argue Bell's don't release a load of great, drinkable stouts for winter. I enjoy cherry stout and its almost a tradition for my friends and family to have one every winter. It's like an American stout meets sour ale with them walking hand in hand down your palate with the cherries only being there for flavor and not to just pucker you up. Cherry Stout holds a place in my heart and a place in Bell's winter lineup and I hope it remains there. One of the best fruit stouts ever made."
""
""
"Overall: Just doesn't do it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Feels is pretty typical, although it's a bit carbonated for a stout. Super silky smooth, but overall not my cup of tea. Glad I tried it, but low on my list of bells beers. Worth a try, but I prob won't give it another shot. Won't dissuade me from bells, though, cheers."

"O: Damn, this is a good beer. One is enough, though. As a dessert beer, it's hard to fault. While it's really only great in the right mood, during said mood, it hits the spot fantastically."
""
""
""
"The beer is smooth and drinkable and I am enjoying it throughout the sampling. QUite a bit of a coater on my palate, and I dont think I could drink more than 1-2 of these in a night, but it is fairly enjoyable overall."
"Overall – An interesting cherry stout. While it starts out with a decent stout flavor, cherry is really the dominating taste in this one, especially at the end where it almost entirely knocks out the stout flavors. While it is not a brew that I would go to all that often, it is one that is well worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Stout in standard pint glass, hardly any foam, dark dark chocolate cherry color and taste. Well balanced, and very smooth, love the slightest hit of bitter/sour final note. Haven't ever had a bad beer from Bell's. Gravity comes in at 7%. Love the cherry rush/smell when poured into a glass, not a from the bottle beer. Hopslam forever!"
""
""
""
"Overall I liked this more than I thought I would. The sour cherry thing actually proved to be an asset in my opinion, it sets it apart from other stouts. I'd buy it again."
""

"O: Great example of a fruit beer where the fruit can really stand on its own without being in a sour. (And there's a solid stout behind it to boot.) Looking forward to having another of these next winter."

"O- An interesting beer, could use some sweetness to balance out the tart. I guess the profile I'm really looking for would be a cherry Founders Breakfast Stout. Missed getting this beer two years ago and last year they didn't brew it due to a cherry shortage. Did have the barrel aged version and have to say that is far superior, the barrel adds the vanilla and sugars this beer needs."

"O: I was very surprised by this beer, as I did not know what to expect from a naturally flavored stout, and because I have never been a fan of chocolate covered cherries. This was a very good beer, and is something I would have again."

""
""

"O - nice stout, but one is enough for me. It's been a few years since I've had this and although it was a bit better than I remember, it's not something I'd buy regularly. Good to finally come back to though."
""
"Overall, this is somewhat disappointing but then again it's enjoyable...peculiar."
""
""
""
"O: While this is a great idea, sour cherries in a stout, it might need to a little more balance between the tartness of the cherries and some sweeter cherries or more milk chocolate flavors."

"O- not bad, tangy michigan cherries, nice roast flavor, not too complex. If you don't like cherries you really won't like this, a nice beer"
""
"O: A decent stout. Was a bit of a let down. This one falls short of the excellent stouts (Expedition, Black Note, double Cream....ect...) that Bell's usually does. As much as I love cherries, here they are too overly dominant. Wish more of the classic stout flavors where there. If the cherries were toned down just a notch this one could be damn near perfect."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 10/8/2013. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, tart cherry, cherry skin, light char, toast, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt with a fair amount of cherry presence; with good strength. Taste of tart cherry, cherry skin, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light coffee, light char, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of cherry tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with prominent cherry flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice fruited stout style. All around good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and cherry flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Bottled 10/8/13. Nice cherry nose with a roast compliment. Low medium body. Cherry is the predominant flavor, with it being on the tart side rather than sweet. The roast malts are overpowered by the cherry. The crisp finish has a touch of sweetness, but again, the cherry predominates and lingers as the only aftertaste. As it warms, a better balance is achieved and roast becomes evident. I began this review at 33 degrees F. Another fine stout from Bell's."
""
""
""
"Overall it was a damn good stout. Smokey malt surprised me in the taste since I could not detect it in the nose however it added some nice complexity."
""
"O - As I think this it is growing on me, I'm not a big over the top stout person. Given it is a cold windy day here in Ohio, this is a nice brew to be sipping while sitting outside by the fire."

"Bell's Cherry Stout ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a rich, thick beer that's very big-bodied and robust without being too heavy. It's smooth, with a little prickly from carbonation but otherwise moving like velvet on the tongue."
"Overall: a poor showing from bell's. I expected a lot from this one especially after the year hiatus last year. but the strong juice taste takes away from what this beer could be."

"O: Pass. Certainly drinkable but Bell's straightforward dark beers are much better"

"Overall: Pleasantly surprised. Ive gotta a couple more bottles of the same bottling date that I'll break out with some friends over the course of the next year. As well as this beer has held up over the course of the last 2 years I don't expect that to continue too much longer. Fresh, I'd drink this beer over the course of an hour; it's that frickin' tart. This one I polished off in about 10 minutes."

"On tap at Gainesville HOB. Pours pitch black with a creamy brown head. Sweet cherry chocolate aroma. Flavor is dominated by cherry flavor, with a hint of chocolate at the end. Mix of sweet and sour cherry. Seems extremely thin for a stout, despite it looking very creamy. Medium carbonation. This is OK, but not a huge fan."

"pours thick and black with red-tinted foam around the edges. Aroma is earthy, smoky, and slightly sour. Flavor opens with sweet and tart cherries surrounded by a bitter, chocolatey smoky presence. Nice cherry presence. Very full-bodied and rich and smooth in the mouth, still finishing without too much lingering sweetness. Very good if you're in the mood for a big, rich stout."

"Overall its great. I think that most people won't appreciate the cherry influence. It's not a dessert cherry and not what most people are thinking when they see ""cherries."" But this beer is a great reflection of Michigan. They did very well indeed."

"Bottle from Sahara Mart bloomington, in. Pours pitch black with about a 1 finger reddish-brown head. Aroma has stout characteristics: chocolate, roasted malt and a hint of cherry. Taste has none of the chocolate and all of the cherry. The slight carbonation gives a smooth sweet texture. If you like very tart stouts then this beer is for you. But other than that it is not balanced well and is too tart for a sweet stout. If the other ingredients could come through this would be an above average beer but just settles for average."

"A mess of a brew. I really wanted to like it, but it was just too off from what it represents to be. The ABV is well hidden and presents no heat. Can't quite recommend it, although I did drink it and kinda enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing Adam!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very interesting beer. Kind of presents a chocolate covered cherry flavor. Not sure if I'd go for this again, but a new experience at least."
""
"Well done, Bell's. Impressive!"
"O: Good beer, definitely one I'll try again. It's a different take, and I probably wouldn't want to have more than 1 at a sitting, but the unique taste was one I enjoyed. I've heard some people describe this as tasting like chocolate covered cherries, and I can certainly see that correlation (as long as you remember it IS a beer hiding in there). Definitely a desert-style beer and one that I could really see myself enjoying with a piece of chocolate cake or chocolate dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A little bit more carbonation would be nice and maybe a touch more sweetness. The taste is interesting.. I was expecting a little more ripe sweet cherry rather than a tartness. Glad to have tried, but I wouldn't reach for this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this one on tap at the Khyber during PBW. While I appreciate the attempt, this one doesn't quite work for me. This was the 2007 version too. The sour cherries def come through but add a little unsettling tart funk that I didn't enjoy. Glad to have tried it though."
""
"Overall, drinkable enough, but sort of an experiment that didn't fully succeed. This is a CHERRY... stout, not a stout with cherry notes."
""
""
"O - The initial sourness stuns you when you are expecting a stout and isn't the best flavor. Otherwise pretty good beer."
""
""
" Drinkability is very high, due to the sour combination of the cherries and the real stout flavor. At 7% AbV it makes a robust pairing with any food."

"Really enjoyed this. Very well balance with and excellent flavor profile combining an outstanding stout with cherry tartness. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I enjoy this I think it's a good fit using the cherries. I wish though it was a lot heavier than it is. I feel the juice watered down the beer considerably."

"A nice find at The World of Beers in Fort Myers, Florida, this one is a pitch black brown color. This stout carries a decent chocolate-tan colored cover and modest lacing. The aroma is a unique blend of tart cherries and chocolatey malt. Pleasant and enticing with a lemony hint. The flavor brings a more challenging blend of bitter cherries with charcoal malt, with very little chocolate. Bitterness really takes over here but the malt base remains and carries a modest herbal hop. Tasty but takes some taste bud adjustments. Medium bodied with a pretty cohesive feel that includes a bit of chalkiness. Carbonation is very subtle but a bit prickly. You do get use to this and I would say it’s a neat, unique stout worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this beer. More tartness than I would like but still has its place. It's different, that's for sure."
"a beautiful dark brown pour into a snifter with enough room for the dark brown head to rise to the top without spilling over (excellent lacing). scents of cherries, maple, smokey, coffee, tobacco. a bitter roasty flavor with a touch of sourness. caramel, cherries, toasted oats and grains, chocolate, coffee. medium bodied with a lot of constant carbonation creating a nice fizzy feeling going down. this would have been perfect this winter, but seems a little out of season with the heat rising. still a very refreshing fruity stout, so it'll be ok for the remainder of the spring season. i'm glad i made the dive and spent so much on the six pack!"
""
""
"Edit: I let it sit for about 6 weeks and found it much more palatable. I've got a few left and I am going to age them a little longer."
""
""
"O - A fine stout. The balanced roasty/chocolate/coffee/cherry aroma is rather deceiving as the taste is dominated by tart cherries. Not bad at all, but I hoped for a more robust, balanced beer. Still worth trying at least once."
""
"Not at all what I've experienced as a cherry stout before. The aroma hides the tart flavor and seems to indicate a much more sweet malt presence. Interesting, but a bit more tart dominant than I initially expected. I like it much more as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brownish color with the slightest pink tinge to an otherwise khaki colored head. Aroma of sweet cherries and roasted malts. In the flavor, a blend of roasted malt notes mimicking coffee, cocoa and mild astringent bitterness, paired with tart cherry flavor. Interesting how tart the cherries have become (this beer was aged 5 months). Tart, sour, roasty, mildly bitter and quite tasty. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth. Overall, a pretty nice stout, with tart cherry flavor. Solid."

"Overall this beer just doesn't work. I must say that the sweet and tart flavors aren't as out of balance as they were two months ago when i tried my first one, but now its just more medicinal. I don't think its getting any better as it ages."
""
""
""
"O: I like cherries and I like stouts, but this didn't blend well, not bad, but I probably couldn't drink more than one in a day"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my least favorite Bell's offerings. That being said, I don't often think the addition of cherry is beneficial to most stouts."
"Cherry Stout pours a very dark, black color, with a very small brown head. There is a dark roasted malty coffee like smell, with chocolate notes, and just hints of a tart cherry smell. The flavor starts with a nice roasted malty flavors, with good hints of chocolate, then the tart cherries flavors kick in. It finishes with a rather tart cherry note. It can be a bit hard to drink, the after taste is strong, and doesn't blend well. Overall I found this a very good beer; you must love cherries to enjoy this, and there is a nice complex flavor, the aftertaste is a bit abrasive and doesn't fit well, but there is a moment with each sip that all the flavors mingle, and make this beer worth it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a very unique and very tart cherry forward stout. It is very good if you like cherries, but would be very difficult to have more than one if your not a big fan of tart cherries. I do like this, the cherries almost yield a wine-like feel, but many may not want to session something like this."
""
""
"Beer is medium to light in body, tart on the corners and sweet up front, the flavors are interesting but not a combo that I particularly enjoy. I had enough after a bottle and won't be going back for more."
"not bad, not something i would seek out again though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think there's a really good stout under there. The cherry does more harm than good."
"O - Not my favorite offering from Bell's, too bad since I had it on cask a couple of years ago and was blown away."
" I'm still not blown away but I am intrigued by the wine similarities. Your wine drinking friends might like it. It still costs a little too much. But, if you really want to reel a certain wino pal of yours into the beer sphere this might prove a sufficient lure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Its a 'mysterious dance' alright. Combining this one with some chocolate-covered coffee beans seemed to cut through the tartness a little..still pretty overwhelming, but a beer I was glad to be able to try!"
""
""
""
"O: Overall I think a person could get some enjoyment out of the malt sweetness, but the fruit flavor has an alarmingly pungent flavor that is off-putting. Not really the same as what I get from Lambics, but just...off. I don't recommend the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was not a favorite of mine. It could be that i just dont like cherries but wow this stuff is sour. I have had other cherry flavored beers such as mad elf and quite enjoyed it but the cherry in this beer I find to be overpowering. The combination of the cherry and the stout...iness remind me of cough syrup."
""
"O- A strange stout. Like someone dumped a bit of wine into a heavy porter/light stout."
""
"Pours a dark brown with extremely small, tan/off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is somewhat sweet with a bit of vegetable aroma and some cherry. Hints of vanilla and coffee as well. Taste is chocolate with some coffee and burnt malt. There is also some tart cherry flavor...wasn't expecting it to be tart (kinda like the cherry stout collab. from Stone). Mouthfeel is kinda light...borderline medium. Drinkability is fair. Overall, this beer is somewhat strange. I love sours/tart beers, and I love rich, dark beers. I also love beers that fall safely between. This one doesn't seem to fit in the ""safely between"" category. Still an okay beer though that I would like to try again."
""
"I think I may like the concept of a cherry stout more than the actual cherry stouts I have tried. This one seems to have a lot of potential, but it needs some more balance between the cherry and the malts."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty disappointed in this brew. I was hoping for more complexity and this brew is overpriced IMO. Everything seems to be lacking except for the tarty cherries."
"Overall, not bad. Interesting."
""
"Overall: A tasty cherry stout. The cerry is very prevalent in the taste, but subtle in the aroma. Drinkability is good."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love cherries, and I'd say this is a okay use, but this isn't something I could drink alot of due to the tart sourness. It's not really something I'm used to identifying with a stout."
""
""
"Still, overall it's very solid, though not a stout I think I'd return to except for on occasion. The cherries definitely shine through, but they never dominate the craft of the drink, though it might wear a bit thin by the end of the drink if you're not into cherries or tart flavors overall."
""
""
""
"This beer isn’t a ‘cherry-bomb,’ it’s not a sweet, syrupy fruit beer, and (in my experience) it’s not going to be the ‘gateway’ kind of beer for non-beer drinkers. I had this at a party and was careful to share sips with others curious about it who were expecting something lighter, fruiter and sweeter by suggesting they smell it, think of dark cherries, and let it warm. This is a real treat of a brew and I’m glad I can enjoy it to the extent that I do."
"O - The cherry dominates the stout a bit much, and the stout component itself is rather unimpressive, but it's a unique and moderately tasty beer overall."
"O: An ok dessert beer, but the cherry flavor doesn't taste as if it's fully integrated with the base beer giving two flavors that just seem to lie on top of one another."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is a bit puckering from the tannins. Cherry skin and barley husk come to mind, although the overall effect is nice. This beer drinks smoothly and I enjoyed it."
""
""
"o- I like this beer but I think it'd be even better with a better balance of the cherries and other flavors."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice black body with a little brown head that goes away quickly to a thin lace. The smell is of cherries and a hint of chocloate. The taste upfront is tart of the cherries, then the roasted malts come next and then at the end on the back of the tonuge is a hint of chocolate. The mouth feel is really good, rolls off the tongue nice. Overall this is a really good stoudt."
""
""
""
"O: This is a tasty Cherry stout from Bells. I would probably drink more of them if they were available, but was glad to have received this in a trade from Scoot69! Thanks again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent stuff - I had it as an aperitif of sorts after some time outside in the cold, and it worked to wake up the taste buds and warm the belly. But a bit too tart overall to get a higher score."
""
""
"Overall: This stout has a nice smooth rich cherry taste. The drinkability is phenomenal! Very well balanced and delicious. $15 for a sick pack. Worth it! Cheers."
"Pours a super dark brown- almost black, with a beautiful one finger dark chocolate head. Average lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is chocolate, cherry, malt, and some funk.. Not bad. The taste is interesting. A little heavy on the sour cherry, and a little light on the chocolate/malt. Still, it's pretty good. Feel is super smooth w/ the malt backbone vs. tart w/ the cherries. Nice. Overall- a solid brew. If it was a little bit more balanced, this would be a great beer."
""

"O: I've been waiting a year for this and I am not disappointed."
""
""
""
"Very good and very interesting."

"M - It actually feels like drinking cherry juice in the way that it's lightly astringent and cleanses the palate. Don't get me wrong, a great body for a Stout. Medium-to-full bodied and a noticeable carbonation. Becomes a bit too bitter and cloying once the beers warms but still drinkable. I can't get over how ""cherry"" the taste and feel are. It's very unique for the style but I guess my expectations were too specific. Very typical of Bell's to transcend the style. I would definitely drink this again, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I love this beer and will gladly purchase it again. Another home run for Bell's stouts."
"D: It's a tasty beer, but not the most drinkable one. It may be the cherries for me, just too odd."
""
""
"4.0 D: This accomplishes what I imagine the goal was in creating this brew. Solid taste, solid overall. Cherries are well incorportated."
""
""
"O - a fine beer, an interesting cherry thing, and a nice balance."
"This beer was exactly what I was expecting it to be, which is to say it was alright but I won't be seeking it out again. It looks good on the pour, dark and a nice head that diminished over time and left just a little lacing. It smells of cherry, predominantly. I served it fairly cold and it was enjoyable. More cherries came out as it warmed up, which I let happen to get that aspect of the beer but I actually preferred the more subtle cherry flavor when it was cold. Before the cherry started dominating, I got some chocolate and more heavy malt but a decent amount of bitterness. Now that the cherries are kicking me in the teeth that's really all I'm pulling out of this one. It's a fun beer to drink but as I said earlier, I won't seek this one out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I liked this but really didn't love it. I think brewing with cherries is a great idea but this one was brewed with cherry juice and I think that takes it way out over the top. Too tart for me. I like to taste roasted flavors in my stouts. Worth a shot if you can just pick a bottle like I did."
"Pours black with a hint of a reddish hue. Not much head on this beer. Slight hint of cherry and roasted malts in the aroma, not much else and not too strong. Flavor begins with tart and distinct cherry juice flavor. Tastes a bit artificial and borders on sour. A slight roasted malt adds a much needed counter to the cherry with hints of coco."
""
""
""
"A little bit of metallic flavor, but can't really say it distracts from the overall enjoyment. Its very cherry dominated, and tart. If you don't like that, don't venture forth unto this beer, its really what its all about. Usual coffee and chocolate suspects stay well behind the cover provided by the cherry."
""

"Definitely interesting and different, but could be better."

"Overall, It was not bad...just nothing there to balance the sourness. I finished the glass feeling just a little disappointed as I really looked forward to this offering from Bell's.Will try it again another time."
""
"Lots of cherries, very fruity. Malty background is a bit lost, but you still know it is a darker brew than most fruit beers. Many stout characters are not present here...roasty coffee, burnt toast and chocolate all seem to be pretty M.I.A. The fruitiness is just a bit much, and I love a good fruit beer. It falls somewhere in the nether-realm of a tart sour, a sweet fruit beer and a export stout but never commits to any of them, to the beers detriment…on my palate at least. I am glad I got this as a single instead of a whole sixer and would not seek it out again."
""
""
""
""
"It's not bad but is a bit overpowering. An after dinner type drink beer if you ask me."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I have a few problems with this beer. It's too thin, it's under-carbonated, and there's too much juice IMO. So much so that it really doesn't taste all that much like beer on the back end."
""
"Overall: An interesting mix of bright and sweet cherries and dark malts. Would go well with a piece of cherry cake or pie."
"Overall, this is a decent stout, but I find the tart cherries to be very distracting form what I want out of a stout."

"O- This beer would have benefitted either from more cherry flavor (without adding more tart), or toning it down more. As it stands, it came across just as a tart stout, without the vibrant fruit flavor I hoped for."
"O - Nice, if you like REAL cherry juice and stouts. It's a great marriage!"
"taste is good but not really something I would seek out again."
"Overall a great fruity stout."
"So yes, technically this is a sound beer. But if you are expecting to taste something a little different, this one will probably let you down in that category."
"Overall, a lil too sweet, but a very well done beer. Would have to be in a specific mood to enjoy one again."
"This beer poured out as a nice rich looking black color with a thin tan colored head on top. The head faded and doesn't really lace the glass all too much. The smell of the beer is sweet, roasted and has a tart cherry aroma coming off of it. I was hoping for more of a sweet cherry but either way you can tell there will be some cherry in there. The flavor if the beer is just a little off in my opinion. I was thinking that this would have gone better together but I felt the cherry was just a little too tart for me. The mouthfeel was a bit on the light side also which hindered my thoughts on this beer too. Overall this brew was fun to try but I haven't really got much desire to have it again."
"O: It isn't all that drinkable. The sweetness, while headed off by the tart cherries and roastiness, is undeniable and sort of takes over after a while. Strange aftertaste."
"Pitch black head with brown/tan head. Smell of tart cherries, maybe slight chocolate? but that may be my mind playing tricks on me by it's appearance. Taste is tart cherries, and smoke. This was a lot more sour/tart than i was expecting. Slight chocolate taste. Mouthfeel is way too watery for a stout for me. This was the them most disappointing aspect of this brew for me. Overall, it's interesting, but i would pass on it next time around."
"O: Very enjoyable stout. A bit more malty than I prefer. Excellent use of the fruit component; blends very well with the stout without overpowering."
"Overall, I don't like the addition of the cherry juice to this. I think it overpowers the malts of the stout and ruins the taste. Not a huge fan."
"Overall, strong flavors, but well-balanced for what it is."
"O: This beer just does not do it for me. The tartness of the cherries is there but the flavor does not come though enough for me. I feel that the cherries either need to make more of an appearance or not be in the beer at all."
"Overall: Traditional stout base with lots of cherry infused into it at all levels. Strong alcohol feel and taste which is surprising since it is a low ABV beer."
"More of an opaque brown than black (if I can get away with saying that). Bubbly light coffee head that stays. Strong aroma of booze, slight cherry, earth, medicinal notes and raisins, dark chocolate and sharp cinnamon. Whoa! Chocolate, tangy and sour fruit, cherry purée, booze, and rides sharp tang to the finish. Heavy in body and light in carbonation. The cherries are a bit strong here and personally would like it more as an accent in the drink rather than being at the forefront."
"Pours out a dark brown hue with a thin tan head that maintains good retention and decent lacing. The nose has a strong cherry aroma with some chocolate and sweet malts in the back. The taste is similar to the smell in which the cherries over takes everything. The cherry taste stays through out and in the aftertaste. I do get some chocolate, coffee, sweet malts and a hint of hops in the back. Everything is well balanced, but the cherries was a bit too much. I think it would have been better with a little less cherries in this beer. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and easy drinking and if you like a strong cherry taste in your stout than this is the beer for you."
"O- I'm all for adding fruit to a stout but it would be nice to pick up more on the malts without all the sour cherry taking over. I love a good sour beer, but not when i'm expecting a nice rich, deep, complex, roasty, and malty stout."
"Overall a great beer given it incorporates fruit but I'm not sure how it works singularly as a stout. The interplay of cherry and malt flavor alone makes this worth drinking and almost makes it a lower gravity dessert beer if you weren't into drinking an eisbock. I aged this bottle for a year and while it liked it better fresh, this is still a great one for a cold night."
"Certainly not the best beer I've ever had from Bell's, but still worthy."
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and chewy on the tongue. This smells delicious, but the overwhelming tart cherry became a turn off for me."
"Starts off with a bit of sour cherry taste mixed with the dark chocolate aftertaste. Moutfeel is pretty good, I'm not the best judge for this category, it honestly felt like a lot of other stouts by Bells. I would like to try it on tap more often, so will have to get lucky at Ashlys or make a trip out to Bells when its on tap at the Eccentric Cafe."
"Overall, it's good, but the pieces don't really come together. It also has a bit of bite that brings it down a notch for me. Not bad, but not great."
"Smells slightly of cherries but mostly hidden by the strong chocolate malt smell. It pours a deep black with a fizzy brown head that settles quickly. It tastes a bit sour from the cherry juice and that is followed by a sweet chocolate taste. Smooth on the palate but it is a bit heavy. Overall this is a beer that I could drink more of and I would like to see if it is a bit better on tap."
"Drinkability - More of a sipping beer that opens up once it hits 45 degree."
"Overall a good stout, but in my opinion nothing spectacular."
"Overall: Good beer overall. Not my favorite, but the cherry adds an interesting element. Worth a shot."
"O: Very impressed with this beer. The massive domination of the cherries are the only thing wrong. If not so tart and a little sweeter and more hidden this would be a truly awesome beer."
"O: Not my favorite stout. Happy to be able to try it considering Bells does not distribute here. I doubt I would ever get it again."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Received this as an extra in a trade. Poured with a nearly nonexistent head despite a fairly vigorous pour. The nose starts off with a faint cherry scent. Fast forward to the taste, and it's all cherry all the time. Big, bold, sour cherry. This is like...a sour stout. Mouthfeel is very tart. This one's hard to retain. Intake, swallow, repeat. The longer it's in your mouth, the more twisted and contorted your face is sure to become. Overall, this is average at best. Wouldn't make an effort to revisit, and might not drink if it was the only beer option. Interesting nonetheless, and glad I got to try it."
"Overall: This is definitely the tartest stout I've ever had. It's a unique brew that one could order to mix things up later in a drinking session. I generally like rounder, roastier, maltier/sweeter stouts, but this one was an enjoyable change."
"O: Although not my favorite stout, this brew has me interested in cherry stouts even when I didn't think I would enjoy them."
"O: This is a treat to be appreciated. In the wrong tasting context, or with an expectation of a different experience, it would be easy to write off this brew as a creators indulgence. However, I was lucky enough to taste after a late summer meal of fresh vegatables and only IPAs to influence my palate. I taste and imagine this brew and it's ingrediants all mellowed from time stored in american oak barrels. A beer perfectly suited for a last of the night choice, esp in the context of slow and relective evaluation of events of the day...and this brew. Demonstrates the top capability of a very experienced brewer."
"I don't like this beer as much as I expected to. I guess cherry juice + roasted malts = too much acid. If I reframe it as a sour beer, it's a little more palatable, but too roasty. The mouthfeel is a little thin. Oh well. Not an awful beer, but I won't be seeking it out again."
"Overall: I put this akin to my first experience with Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. It's all tobacco and burnt. There's a chance I'll love it in a few years, but right now it's a charred mess. It's definitely unique, but it's not the strongest beer in Bell's lineup...not by far."
"Overall: This sure seems like a big miss for Bell's. This is one that should be dropped from their line-up, IMO. This took some effort to finish."
"O - Interesting brew. If I look at it from my wild ale/sour loving perspective, this is definitely an ok beer. I was expecting something a little more stout-ee, and didn't get that at all. It's a confused brew. Not quite sour, but not quite a stout. If you like roasted sour cherries, give it a go... I probably won't be trading for it any time soon though. Glad I got to try it!"
"O: Overall I'm surprised to say that I really liked this beer since I'm not a huge fan of cherries. The tartness from the cherries really blends well with the roasted malts. I would love to be able to purchase this on a regular basis. Highly recommend you try if you have the chance."
"O - One is enough with the intensity of tart cherry."
"12 ounce bottle shared at the July Santa Cruz tasting. Pours dark brown with a light tan head. Aroma is chocolatey, but sort of salty too, like, uh, those salted chocolates. A touch of soy and smoke, coffee, and a mild cherry tartness. Flavor is dark chocolate and cherry juice with a nice dry finish."
"Pours black and syrupy with a small dark brown head and a minimum of lace. Some sediment is present. Smell is roasty and a bit of smoke with a TON of cherry. The malty stout aroma floats in the middle. Taste is smoky roast on the front with some minimal sweetness in the middle with bittersweet sour cherry at the finish. Tartness is a bit of a shock, but grows on you quickly. Very complex. Slippery mouthfeel with not a lot of carbonation. Actually the cherry is very tart throughout. Aftertaste is sour cherry and lots of smoky bitterness. This is not your girly fruit beer. The taste is complex and smoky, and the cherry is bitterly tart. This cries out for a bold smoky ham sandwich with sharp cheddar."
"O: The tartness on the nose was nice and added some depth, but it really took over on the palate and became too much."
"Overall exciting fruit stout, good for lambic/Flemish fans."
"Drinking this beer made me think of black forest cake. Since I'm not a huge fan of black forest cake, this did not bode well for my enjoyment of this beer. If you can handle the clash of tartness and richness, you'll like this beer. Personally, the cherry tartness just didn't quite work for me. I won't buy this again."
"Drink and overall: Overall, I really enjoy this stout (on tap). This beer does not age well in a bottle, for whatever reason. The cherry fades, and turns into an unappealing mess. But fresh on tap, it's a work of art. I really enjoy what Bell's has done."
"Pours black, just doesn't look very thick. Reddish, gold lacing. Smells of tart cherries, dark chocolate, roasts, and a bit of coffee. First taste has coffee, a bit of chocolate and a bit of sweet cherry, however when I swallow, I'm overwhelmed with tart cherry. Different kind of stout than what i'm used to. Mouthfeel is creamy, but a bit thin. Not much carbonation. The cherry lingers in the aftertaste. Tart, but not overly tart. I catch quite a bit of chocolate on the aftertaste as well. Overall, this wasn't bad. Not sure I'll buy it again, but not bad."
"Dark black pour, with a thin gray head. Potent aroma of cherries, that yields a light cherry cough syrup taste. The cherries are prevalent enough to tell these are very likely real cherries, and pretty fresh. A bit too much malt (Black Patent) for my taste though. The alcohol comes a bit to hard and bitter, but still well worth trying."
"D - No carbonation at all, oily in the mouth."
"Overall, I wouldn't buy this again. It's one for the books, as they say. Something to try... But - if you like cherries and stouts, it's all for you!"
"I used a very gentle pour as I was concerned that lees may have formed over time. I am unsure that it mattered, however, as there was very little carbonation present and even a vigorous swirl failed to produce any head. Color was an Opaque Black (SRM = 44) with only some cola highlights visible at the edges. Nose was filled with the scent of dried tart cherries, slightly medicinal, but still pleasant. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and without carbonation, as I had previously mentioned. This allowed the tartness of the cherries to really shine and I feel as though I have come a long way since my original review. I did not find it to be at all unpleasant. Instead, I liked the way the cherries had really come to the forefront, especially since I was not getting much in the way of the dark malts. Finish remained tart, but not puckering. It was an interesting experiment, to be sure, but I am coming to the realization that fresher probably would have been better. My last pour was that of the lees, agitated back into suspension. This last bit was much more tart than the rest, which is worth noting."
"O - Overall, I liked this beer and I'm glad I tried it. Could be an excellent beer if the cherry were a little more subtle but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"O- I wish this was a little more roasty and had some better balance, a little too cherry forward. Definitely a sour, tart cherry flavor, but I like sour beers so the sourness did not bother me but the chocolate and espresso background got lost some. If this tasted more like the aroma this could be great."
"Personal opinion only: I still prefer my local Wildrose Cherry Porter - wish I could have tried them side by side."
"Overall: I enjoyed it, although, the flavor profile did not provide the depth that the aroma provided it was still enjoyable."
"Pours black with a finger of dark khaki foam. Decent retention, but no lacing. Aroma is a nicely balanced dark chocolate/cocoa, roasted malt, and a hint of cherry fruit. Smells tasty. The taste opens with a burst of tart, mouthwatering cherry which slowly fades over a good 30 seconds--impressive if it were balanced with other stout-y flavors, but it turns out like cherry juice. I do get some cocoa on the finish, which turns out to be better than the beer itself. Carbonation is low, too low for the style. Overall, the nice aroma got my hopes up, but this beer doesn't avoid the trap common to cherry stouts of ham-handedness over subtlety."
"Pours pitch black with almost no head at all. Nose is somewhat muted but along the lines of Guinness or Murphy's stout. Palate is somewhat tart but mostly just tastes roast and like coffee, molasses and malta. Sounds more interesting than it actually tastes. Cherry does manage to not seem artificial which is a plus."
"And the beer is...Bell's Cherry Stout! 2 for 2 guessing beers when I know the brewery now, otherwise I've been off. Thanks a lot Kyle, this is a beer that should have been on my Wants list!"
"Very thick, dark brown in color, with thin but lasting head. The scent was full of malt and chocolate with a hint of cherry, which was much more present in the taste. Tart cherry dominated the taste, following an initial chocolaty smoothness. Overall this was an excellent beer, and it makes an great dessert drink."
"Overall- Wow! You have to try this stout to enjoy it! Not sure I would name this a Fruit/Vegetable Beer because it definitely has the attributes of an American Stout. Drinkability was decent but wouldn't drink more than 2 in a night. Perfect beer with a chocolate cheesecake or dessert. Will be promoting this beer without a doubt!"
"Overall, decent but certainly not worth the hefty pricetag."
"i was not impressed with this beer. The smell is good enough, lots of tart cherries but not much else works for me. Very light on the mouthfeel and the taste lingers but i don't care for the taste. It has a medicinal taste and not in a good, sizzurpy kind of way. It is very light for a ""stout"" and I don't think I would purchase this again. In a word, ""meh."""
"O: Decent, but too sour for me. 3.5"
"Dark brown in color with a small whispy head. Smells pretty interesting but not overly appetizing. Roasted grains, chocolate and cherry that is somewhat medicinal. Palate is basically the same as the nose with more of the tart cough syrup flavor. Very fluid mouthfeel with low carbonation. Seems a bit too thin and watery for a stout. Not a great beer by any means but could be worth a try if cherry flavor is your thing."
"Not one of my favorites from Bell. I get what they were going for but it doesn't seem to do it for me. The blend of tart cherries and malty coffee, just doesn't seem to work. Right off the bat the beer looks great but the nose and taste leave something to be desired. If there was a little more sweetness to the beer to balance out the tart that might help. Tart and bitter, in this case, not a great combo."
"**NOTE Not sure how ""fresh"" this beer is. Could be affecting some of the tartness I'm getting out of this beer..."
"Served from bottle into goblet at refrigerator temperature. Pours jet black with an appropriatly thick brown head. The aroma is quite subtle and doesn't offer much of a hint to the large flavor to come- a flavor which is dominated by tart michigan cherries. The cherry flavor, which is quite authentic and doesn't resemble cough syrup or candy at all, is far and away the most dominant flavor in this brew. The flavor is more ""adult"" than other mass-market cherry beers, owing much to the tart cherries, but is still very cherry indeed. Although very tasty, I believe that the best use of this beer is in cooking. This is not a complaint- this would make a great component to a sweet dessert. For drinking, though, it would be tough to drink more than one, but the quality is quite evident and I would definitely recommend trying this one."
"O: It's interesting and well crafted. I like the deep roasted stout flavor, but the cherry tartness and sweetness was a bit strong...good beer nonetheless."
"O: OK. I buy this occasionally. It's interesting to try. I like sour stouts, so this is more up my alley, but it can't hold a candle to Madrugada Obscura."
"O: A very surprising failure from Bell's."
"Overall: I just didn't like the way this one came together. The roast and the tart fruit kept fighting for my attention."
"Poured into a pint glass. Not a lot of head, just less than one finger of tan foamy head. The aroma is of black cherries and roasted cold coffee beans. The favor plays rigth into the smell. Subtle cherry/blackberry favor, drying winey note that reminds me of the use of real fruit when I brew. The alochol is hidden, but there just seems something missing; still a good brew."
"It pours black with a reddish-brown two-finger head that's slow to fall. When cold, the nose is a bit difficult to distinguish. As it warms, the aromas of tart cherries and bittersweet chocolate are apparent. This is definitely another sipping beer. The cherry flavor is strong and tart, far from the over-sweetened brew I expected. It's roasty and malty with a nice bitter chocolate coffee finish but it's a bit too carbonated. I am inclined to marinate pork in this one."
"Completely opaque dark brown. Syrupy looking on the pour, almost no head but what there is looks like espresso foam. Smells a bit tart with alcohol on the nose. But the smell is surprisingly weak. The flavor is very interesting and hard to pin down whether it's good or kind of bad. I guess it depends on your mood. The positives are a sweet, chocolaty, tart cherry medley which makes this come off as a dessert beer, if there is such a thing. The downside is it can lean towards a cough syrup flavor and consistency. So, not good there. But it plays tricks on my tasting facilities: one sip is ""hey this is pretty good," and the next is ""no it's not my thing."" A strange brew, to be sure. I'd try it rather than pass it up, if only for the experience with this rare style of beer. Overall I'd say it lacks dimension, but it may be what some people are looking for."
"O - this beer is decently made, but not my cup of tea. I was expecting more chocolate cake with cherries then a pile of cherries masking the cake. The aroma is very nice but the flavor just wasn't balanced. If they cut down on the cherries a little I think it would be much better."
"D - Not my favorite, but always fun to try something different."
"(12oz bottle). Pours black with light brown head. Aroma has plenty of coffee and dark chocolate, which predominate, with a little bit of smoke or ash. I'm not getting cherries at all in the nose. The taste, however, is different. The taste is tart cherry which off-sets the intense roasty bitterness in a clunky, but pleasant way. Thin bodied with slick texture and dry finish. I first had this beer 10 years ago and hated it. Glad to see that I can understand the play in flavors a bit better. I could see myself grabbing a 6'er of this."
"O: decent brew.. I could probably only drink one.. gets overly sweet towards the end.."
"The tangy fruit and the stout flavor are good in this beer, and while they are balanced nicely they just don't pair well enough to make a winner. Overall worth a try."
"Overall I have to say I really enjoyed this beer. All the cherry flavored beers I have had before now have all had an overpowering artificial cherry flavor to them, this beer did not. This beer focused more on the tart side of the cherries and I feel like that is a way better match for a stout then the cough syrup cherry flavor. I have never had a stout that tasted tart so this was a new experience. This beer beat the hell out of Atwaters version and while it may not be everyones cup of tea, I sure enjoyed it. I would buy this again and recommend it to anyone who likes unique brews."
"Perhaps these aren't the right cherries for this beer. Their sourness makes this feel less a cherry stout and more a lacto-infected mess. I finished the glass, but I wasn't happy about it."
"O - Train-wreck of a beer. Must be better in bottles because that B rating is much too high."
"O- Overall, this was a very interesting beer. I thought going in that this would be a stout with a hint of cherry. But I was wrong, this is definitely a cherry dominated brew."
"Pours a thick and opaque black with no head whatsoever. There is a tiny bit of a film on the top of the beer. Smells of roasted espresso beans, bittersweet chocolate, and sour cherry puree. Taste is of sour cherry juice up front with the dark malts, roasted coffee, and bittersweet chocolate on the finish. There is an acidic/sour twang to this beer with each sip. Somewhat of a high level of carbonation. A bit sticky in the mouth. Overall, a neat idea but something that is an acquired taste."
"M - smooth but not quite creamy; light but detectable carbonation."
"O - Pretty good... I'd like to compare it to the bottle at some time..."
"The mouthfeel is nice and satisfying, it's decently thick and has some nice prickliness on the way down to go with the fruit flavors. The drinkability is superb for such a stout. Overall, I really enjoyed this one. It's a great fruit beer for the dark beer lover. Looking forward to next year's batch already."
"Pours garnet-black with no head. A few bubbles effervese to the surface. Aroma is deep roasted malt, mocha, and a touch of sweet dark cherries. First sip is really dissapointing. Mouthfeel is syrupy, watered down, flat, and dry. Roast vegetal flavors (celery? carrot?) followed by a cough syrup cherry. Not horrible, but not recommended."
"D: I would not be getting this one again thats for sure."
"Mouthfeel is acidic while being full and syrupy, again a weird combination. Solid feel, just strange and unpleasant in parts. Drinkability suffers from the acidity and strongly flavored roast not pairing well, although the abv is hidden very well. I laud the effort, but the beer just never comes together."
"Opinion: Wow, I have always been happy with Bell's products, but this is the exception. This beer failed from square one for me and I wouldn't drink it again. It isn't as horrible as Sam Adams Cherry Wheat by any means, but it is absolutely my least favorite offering from Bell's. I had pretty high hopes for this one, and unfortunately for me, my palate, Bell's, and anyone else that will listen, this beer was a pretty major let-down."
"OVERALL: A decent cherry stout for sure. The palate needs a little beefing up, but the flavor definitely fits the bill. Enjoyable and drinkable, this is one worth checking out if you get the chance. Thanks again for doing the legwork guys. Recommended."
"I had been looking forward to this, but am glad I didn't get a 6 pack. Pretty pricey and not as good as I had hoped. I love Bells."
"Overall, I really like Bell's Brewery. I've enjoyed, to varying degrees, each of their beers I've tried. I've been looking forward to trying the Cherry Stout for a while. Staring at a half-filled glass, I'm hard-pressed to say that I'd give this one a shot again."
"Had a local microbrewed cherry stout first so this was a good comparison. Was surprised at almost how identicle it was to Sun Up's Cherry Bomb. Color was black. Small head. Big cherry aroma and a sweet cherry flavor, reminiscent of marchiano cherries. Some warmth from the alcohol but not in a bad way. Felt like the beer was just to young and that it could age some."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer presents a deep black, with amber-brown highlights and a thin, milk chocolate colored head that quickly disappears. Aromas of molasses and dark cherry, with some dark chocolate highlights. The beer has an initial bitter dark roasted coffee flavor, quickly switching to a tast, sweet dark cherry flavor. The dark roasted malt and molasses flavors also peek in for a bit. Sweetness is there in the aftertaste, too, and with the rich and slightly oily/slick body, this one can be overpowering. The finish is a little boozy and a little syrupy. Not unpleasant, but rich, and not one I would drink in succession."
"Pours super-dark, mahogony black. Perhaps the darkest head ever recedes very quickly. This stuff looks like beer bile, really. Smell is smooth coffee, sort of mild in fact.. maybe played down by some tartness. Which describes the taste. I'm someone who likes cherries, but I don't think they work with this beer. There is a feud between the malts and cherries which ends up tasting sour and sort of like beer bile. Thin feel, mostly cherry tartness and a bit of burn after-the-sip. I wouldn't drink another."
"Worth trying once, but not a beer I'd have often. Not personally a big fan of numerical ratings, but I gave this an extra half point above average in the taste category for being different. The cherries definitely make their presence known, tart though not quite as over-the-top tart to me as some of the other reviewers here mentioned. Wish there was a heavy chocolate flavor as that may have really meshed with the other flavors well and pulled this up to another level."
"Drinkability - Interesting brew, not quite like the other cherry-flavored beers I've tried. Don't love the taste, but I appreciate the brew and what they were going for."
"D - it's okay but I don't really need another one of these. Moving on."
"This pours almost black with red highlights around the edges, an off-white small head, and a little bit of lacing. On the nose the cherries jump out, tart and huge, but under that there is some caramel malt. In the mouth the tartness becomes even bigger, the cherries are just huge in this beer, but there is caramel lurking underneath. The finish is long on tart, but the mouthfeel is a little thin to me. I'm glad I had it, and I would have it again, but to me this is a one-and-done beer because of the cherry intensity."
"D: Too tart and sour for my tastes but an okay brew."
"Body is too thin to handle this flavor. Bulk it up and even out the balance and it's looking like a damn fine flavored stout."
"D: This is definitely a tasty stout, and is different enough to be notable. However, the tartness from the cherries and the heavy licorice character keep me very satisfied at a single serving."
"Drinkability is low. I was worried when I bought this, but interested. Wasn't sure how the cherry flavor and a stout would mix but I had high hopes. Didn't turn out like I had hoped. This would fare better with more chocolate flavor up front. It's not awful, but I'm not really enjoying it too much."
"I couldn't finish the beer. Had to leave about 1/4 of it."
"D: Tasty brew indeed. Not sure why it's classified as fruit/vegetable beer when Bell's clearly classifies this as a ""cherry stout"" but whatever. I could drink a few, or 6."
"D-well i didn't think i was gonna be able to drink this too quickly but it did disappear fast! the taste stays well."
"Definitely a dessert beer. Good when you're in the mood for something really sweet. Bell's should pull back on the cherry and let the stout out!"
"Poured a deep black with a medium brown creamy head that was mostly lasting and had fair lacing. The aroma was mild of roasted malts, a sweet yeast and strong notes of cherries and dark chocolate. It tasted mildly sweet with a strong cherry flavor at first and ended with a sweet-tart cherry flavor that had a hint of chocolate with the taste of cherries lingering on you taste buds for only a short while. Mouthfeel was medium in body and creamy yet watery in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall a tasty stout, a nice change from the norm."
"D: High. Very high. This is one of my all-time favorite ""first beers of the night"". I like to start with a stout, and this is one of my go-to's."
"Verdict - This stout has all the right elements going for it here. I felt like it was a little too sour for a stout for my tasting, however. I was still an enjoyable drink, but I would not purchase an entire pack of it."
"Medium body feel to the beer, defiantly light on the carbonation. Obviously the beer's drinkability suffers from the overwhelming cherry taste. This one was really disappointing for me as Bell's is one of my favorite breweries."
"Overall, an interesting beer that I am glad I tried, but I don't know how often I would return to it. Its a good stout, but I feel like bells just poured some really delicious cherry juice into my glass."
"D: This one is a little strange. It's not bad, but I'd never want to have it again. It doesn't quite taste like a stout, but it doesn't quite taste like fruit beer either. It could be better."
"Notes: This beer is very unique and has a lot of potential. Though it does get better as it warms the flavors just don't seem to meld together like they should. I wonder if a little age would help this beer."
"This is beer I think I would enjoy more the second or third pour after I had a good idea of what to expect."
"Fruit beers definitely aren't my main cup of tea (or beer), but this one is one of the better ones. The roasted malts prevent the fruit from becoming too overpowering."
"D: The taste really turns me off so that hurts drinkability, as does the lower carbonation."
"This Bell's winter seasonal poured a beautiful black with ruby/cherry higlights and a dark brown sudsy head. Very nice looking. The smell was strong with malts, cherry, and a little alcohol (7% ABV) all standing out. And the taste - wow. The cherry is not subtle. And it is real cherry flavor, as this bad boy is brewed with cherries from Traverse City. Loud and Proud. Also coffee notes, overall a sweet stout with a tart real cherry flavor. It was smooth and medium-bodied, and great drinkability."
"D- Its a sipper and the tartness makes it one to drink slow. It gets better as you acustom yourself."
"There's a passing flash of toasty malt flavor initially, followed by a crescendo of abrasive tartness which even seemed to affect the mouthfeel of the beer (going from nearly chewy to thin and filmy). The astringent aftertaste of off-cherry juice mixes poorly with the slight bitter hop profile, and lingers unpleasantly until I wash it out with a more palatable stout. If you value your taste buds, leave this one on the shelf."
"Overall I don't think I could drink alot of this. It's good but 12 oz's is kind of alot. It's The tartness of the cherries moxed with the roast that I think makes it soo different."
"D: This is a huge miss. It is impossible for me to enjoy this."
"Glad I tried it..open to drinking it again...would never buy an entire 6 pack of this. Thank you Chuck's for selling singles."
"A good beer overall. I wouldn't buy this often if it were available in CA, but it's interesting and I was glad to try it. 4"
"Unusual, and worthy of a taste, but not something I'd care to revisit."
"D- much easier to drink a few of these than some of the thicker stouts. I like this!"
"The aroma has an acidity in it that is impossible to miss, if i didn't know that this wasn't a typical stout i'd be fearing a ruined beer, but knowing what has been put in here it only opens up more excitment. The flavors are very much like a dry dark chocolate covered over dark cherries, like a fruity cocoa powder thrown into a pressed juice. It's really more of a dryness with a light tartness and it works so well, it tastes so natural. So tasty and drinkable i'm over half through my glass in no time."
"Drinkability, I'm not that jazzed about what the cherry adds,but it's pretty good. Quite a bit better once to it's favorite temp,which is a bit of a hassle."
"Bell's Cherry Stout is black like all the others, a big black stout with a thin layered light tan cap up above that left no traces. Swirls could not even bring up a inch of foam. Smell is all cherry, tart cherry, although I know it's not the real deal, just juice. A blast of cherry backing a smallish stout with some chocolate in the back, slight roast, not in the big picture though. Getting some licorice and malt with the cherry. Feel is tangy, slightly tart, not funky. Body is medium with a lively carb, perhaps too much, it was a bit bitey. Another great one from Bell's but one that is a single go for me."
"D- I was surprised by this one that's for sure. Did not expect this much of a sour cherry presence but I dug it."
"Not very impressed with this beer, especially for the price. I would not recommend this to a friend."
"Drinkability: Once again, it smells great, but the taste is another story. I just don't dig this style at all. Though there is promise, it is an overall letdown."
"All in all, the MO for this brew is BALANCE! With the exception of the nose and the appearance, this brew has amazing balance in all other categories! Not only is it balanced, but it brings something unique, new, and fresh to the craft beer scene. An AMERICAN WILD STOUT! That's the only way I can classify this. I think BA should make a new category. Great to try if you like well balances beers, wild ales, and stouts."
"I guess this can be useful for cooking... but not very much for drinking..."
"D: Not sure if cherry was a good choice for a stout. The tartness was too prevalent for me. Although I found it flavorful at first, this ended up being hard to finish"
"Overall: This one is almost to sour proportions of beers. Don't expect a malt forward taste, the cherry tartness is what hits hardest and longest."
"D: As others have mentioned this is sort of Black Forest Cake of a beer. Lots going on and it pulls it off nicely. It is an interesting, different and tasty fruit beer. Emphasis on the beer and the fruit - nothing fake or unhinged here. The dark side though, rather than the usual ""whatever"" wheat ale. Tart cherry is reasonably balanced by a by a relatively narrow profiled dark roasted malt. I think this would be better with more malt sweetness and rounded character. It is a nice treat - a desert beer even."
"The aroma and flavor is a bit off putting for me on this brew!"
"Poured very dark, and a darker than usual head that was very thin. Initial smell was of Cherry Coke and sweet malts including molasses. Initial baker's cherry blast, very tart. That in itself is ok, but the rest of the flavors made this practically undrinkable. This is the second beer I've dumped in the last 10 years..the first being the Bell's Porter. Both of these are just kinda gross. Sorry"
"Pours a dark black color. 3/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, citrus, and slight hop. Fits the style of a Fruit / Vegetable beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight acidic feel. Tastes of citrus, hops, roasted malt, and sweet malt. Overall, great appearance, good aroma, and good mouth feel. The body is a little lacking though. The cherries are not strongly noticeable, but I enjoy that more than most probably would."
"D: An interesting stout but the sweet cherry flavor is a bit too much"
"D: Sour cherry notes aren't something that I thought would mix well with stout flavors, and this beer didn't really change my mind. I think this is about as good as a beer like this could be, but it's still not something I'd want to go out of my way for."
"Drinkabilty - If you enjoy this style then you could drink a few of these since the alcohol is masked very well. This is too bitter and bland for me, one and for sure done"
"Drinkability: It's smooth and when it warms it's pretty good, but it's pretty bad before that."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I tried it,but I think you have to be a real cherry lover to reach for another one. As much as I like the tart cherry flavor of Northern MI, I usually have it an pie or a small glass of cherry juice. 12oz is a bit much after awhile. Maybe combined with the right desert this beer would be really something, but by itself it's a bit much."
"Drinkability -- Clearly a well-crafted stout -- Bell's knows what they are doing -- but it's not my cup of tea. As a Fruit/Vegetable beer, it's pretty good aside from the lack of cherry in the aroma, but as a stout I could take or leave it."
"Drinkability - One and done. The cherry sweetness comes through more as it warms up, and becomes a cloying sweetness. Glad to try, glad I only got a single."
"D: This is a nice ""change of pace"" beer, definitely not what I expected on the nose or palate. I guess you could say it is a surprising beer. Don't think I'll be grabbing more than one of these at a time, but it was a nice experience. Solidly interesting beer."
"This had a very dark color, chewy mouthfeel, with a bit more carbonation that I'm comfortable with. I won't have any trouble drinking this 6-pack. It has a warming, but not in your face alcohol ""burn"". First impression is coffee and cherry. I wouldn't mind getting this again, but since I'm new this year to trying different beers every time I go to Friar Tucks ... I might wait awhile."
"Tastes like an imperial stout but lighter on the bitterness. Cherry tart backend. I liked it but wouldnt drink it all the time. Still a good beer if your looking for something different. It became more enjoyable as I got into a few of them. Drank five. I will drink again for sure."
"Bell's and Southern Tier are my go-to's for stouts, both do very interesting ones that are based off of quality stouts; the Cherry Stout is a very good one from Bell's that makes me want to follow it up with Choklat or Mokah from Southern Tier"
"A little to tart for me to drink many. I would drink another"
"D - Drinkability is good. This is a very unique and interesting beer. It goes down easy and smooth. The dark malts really balance out the cherries, and I think it just works really well. This is one of my favorite beers that incorporates cherries. If you haven't tried it, give it a shot. Good job Bell's. Cheers."
"Bottle. Batch 9993. Trying this one again after some time. I recall years ago having it and not being able to drink it all that much. Poured into my KBS chalice glass a dark brown color with a medium tan head that quicly settles to form a slight collar. Dark roast notes in the nose with a touch of sweet fruit. Medium mouthfeel with some carbonation. Roasted flavors with a subtle and lingering sweetness with some tartness. Overall, not bad."
"Dark brown with ruby tints, nearly completely opaque, capped off with a nice brown head. Aroma of malty chocolate, sour cherries. Mildly sour black cherries obviously right up front on the palate and lingering throughout. Roasty malts in the background. It's hard to get a fruit flavor that doesn't clash with roasty dark malts, but Bell's does a pretty good job of it here. Medium-to-heavy body, not too thick. Moderately drinkable, though not many people seem to be into stouts that have a sour twist to them, so take that as you will. Overall, very tasty."
"Drinkability: Overall, this is a pretty good one. They made a flavored beer that actually tastes like the flavor without taking it too far. Don't think I'd get tired of this one as quickly as some similar brews. Another solid beer from Bell's."
"D - I've enjoyed this beer a lot. This is one of those beers that will have either very high ratings (as a fruit beer) or lower ratings (people looking for more stout flavors). This thing lies right in the middle of the two styles in my opinion. It's listed as a fruit beer here, and that is probably the closer style...but the stout aspect cant be discounted in this one. Very good and worth a try! Bells did a good job with this one."
"D: one of my lesser favorites from a long list of favorites from Bells. Good from time to time"
"I have to say drinkability on this beer is not very high for me but then most fruit beers just don't do it for me. The cherry flavor is not cloying like some other cherry beers I could name but I think could be a tad sweeter perhaps. If you like tart cherries this is right up your alley!"
"I would put this ahead of NG Cherry Stout as the cherries taste very tart rather than medicinal. A very good beer, I'm happy I cellared this one."
"This beer is light in body and has a nice aftertaste that makes it feel bigger then it does at first sip. It does hold a grip on the pallet for a time then lets go with some nice after effects."
"Drinkability: Overall, it's not bad and I certainly wouldn't turn it down as it is fairly tasty and kind of unique, but it's not really something that I would likely seek out or buy on a regular, or even annual basis as I feel there are some better options out there. The weight isn't awful for a stout-ish beer and the ABV only clocks in at 7%, which, while nothing to sneer at, would likely catch up after a couple. Makes for a nice nightcap."
"D // It's heavy, and it's sour cherry. I can't be expected to drink a twelve-ouncer on my own, honestly."
"This is a medium bodied offering with a modest level of carbonation. Despite the shock and awe treatment I had throughout the experience it is quite good. In a way I want to ravage the rating of this review because I went into this experience expecting a stout with cherry flavor and ended up with a fruit beer with minor stout qualities. If you want to enjoy a roasty flavored stout on a cold evening, this is not the brew to pick up. This is a fruit beer in disguise as a stout but in it's own right it is pretty darn good."
"D- This is a pretty good beer. Would I call this a stout? No. Definitely not. Overall though, enjoyable. Not an issue on the alcohol, not an issue anywhere really. Just... decent."
"D- I'd prefer a stout with the usual flavors, but this is a nice little change of pace"
"So I'm shopping at Bruno's, one of the few grocery stores in Tuscaloosa that is open on Thanksgiving. I see the Cherry Stout six-packs on the shelf and think ""Oh, I haven't seen this year's batch on shelves yet."" My roommate, who loves this beer, buys a sixer. When I get home, I notice under natural light that the bottles are very dusty. I check the batch number, and sure enough, it was packaged on Nov. 18th, 2009. Now, I have friends who hate this beer. They can't stand out cherry-forward it is. These year-old bottles, though, are quite balanced. Basically, I am telling you to drink this beer aged rather than fresh. Six months to a year will mellow out the medicinal harshness of the cherries and leave you with a pretty solid, if one-note, stout."
"D: This is very interesting along side the Short's Black Cherry Porter. This was way more straight forward with the cherry flavor, but at the same time still managed to work. It was a little too sour and tart for me to want to keep drinking these, but my girlfriend really enjoyed it."
"I like dark beer and I like cherry beer, so this is a natural for me. I prefer sweet over tart, but this works well. It's got a good punch with 75 ABV, but you wouldn't know it."
"I have drunk three of them this week and still can't decide whether I like this unique combination or not. The mouthfeel is weak--too much like soda, not creamy or full like it probably should be--and honestly, the cherry needs to be sweeter and less tart. I appreciate what they're trying to do but this is not a must-drink beer."
"D - no, no and um... no."
"NOTE: This beer is somewhat expensive at about $14/6-pack. Ouch!"
"D. Definitely drinkable. I like this beer the more I drink. I might be a sucker for fruit/vegetable beers and I love stouts, so this combination is right up my alley."
"D: That cherry flavor really does dominate and confuse the palate rather than blend a mellow, fruity flavor with the decent, roasted malt blend presented in the stout. The 7% ABV and heartburn isn't worth it for me to go back again, however. Worth a try, but take a Pepcid, this stout is sour and tart."
"The tartness would make this a single pinter for me. While enjoyable and cleansing if you've been drinking some more cloying beers it's not one i good session, and at 7% that's a good thing."
"D - I remember having this about a year ago expecting something along the lines of Lindemans lambic so I immediately dismissed it as horrible but now that my palate is more sophisticated and I love stouts, the tart cherry and bold roasty flavors really click nicely. Well done bells!"
"D- I expect this beer to fair out much better then I thought it would. I like cherries and stouts but this is way to much of cherries and not enough of the chocolate and dark malts to compliment it and even add some type of sugar to interwoven the beer as a whole."
"O: A good choice for desert. I'll need to keep this one in mind for Christmas deserts."
"Drinkability is fine and alcohol was warming. Overall this is a unique beer but I don't find this style as a favorite."
"The cherry flavor though is good and not that artificial, cough syrup cherry that I've had in other beers. I think that the mouthfeel suffers because for a beer that should be full bodied and smooth, the tart cherries make this beer prickly and drying. Alcohol heat is a little present just on the back of the throat, but not too bad. I don't think I would try this again unless the recipe was changed, but it was a nice experience."
"Interesting stuff, but I don't really see myself buying again, except that I will take Bell's advice and try cellaring one bottle to see what happens."
"I'll make it a point to grab a pack of this any time I see it."
"Overall- I enjoyed the beer for the complexity of cherries and malts but the beer really seems to clash. I will probably not try it again but am glad to add this beer to my drinking experience. It's so difficult to create a great fruit stout and this beer does fall short."
"A decent tasting stout, but previous versions I've had tasted better. needs a little more sweet tasting cherry flavor IMO. the fact that it's extremely expensive a 6pack, and that I don't really crave it, don't think it's too high on my drinkabillity scale."
"D- I could definitely sit and do a 6er no problem of this stuff."
"Notes: Definitely a stout with cherry flavors present. Pretty nice, although the flavors fall a little short for me (as far as the stout flavors go, the cherry was about on). Great dessert beer with a very nice, thick body."
"D - For a fairly big stout, very drinkable. If I could get this in Colorado I would think about drinking another. But seeing as I only brought two back from Missouri, I'm gonna save it for a nice cold winter day."
"Drinkability was bad - this tastes horrible and I do not want to take another sip."
"D: Scrump-u-li-cious. Yeah I pulled a G.W. Bush."
"I actually tried to clear my palate with a follow-up beer [Summit EPA], but it wasn't up to the task. The cherry lingered for *a long* time."
"Overall at this point I think I prefer an Imperial or Oatmeal stout to this fruited style."
"D: Its a good change of pace from a normal Stout. One of these in a night is enough for me."
"Drinkability: Big disappontment. This one tastes like cough medicine to me. It gets better as it goes, but the spicing--cinnamon I believe-takes over too much. I have had better from Bells."
"I suppose the taste was going to be predictable with the mix of cherries and roasted chocolate/coffee malts, but it still surprised me how different this beer was."
"One taste is good enough but defintely worth trying."
"Meh."
"2010 vintage bottle poured into a standard tulip glass. Head is a half inch of dark tan that doesn't linger long. Aroma is subtle but of chocolate and cherries. The flavor is chocolate and coffee with cherries. Not the sweet maraschino cherry, but the fresh bitter picked off the tree and eaten without washing first even if your mother taught you better cherry. On the palate this beer is not overly thick but it does leave a tart almost slimy residue on the back of your tongue. Drinkability / poundability this is not a hot summer day beer, more a cool evening by a fire sipper."
"Stumbled on a pile o' these guys at a nearby store and pounced (they go quickly around here...unlike the Beltway traffic...Zing!). It pours a starkly opaque black-brown topped by a thin finger of very quickly-dying khaki foam. The nose is heavy on the maple syrup, molasses, and roasted malts. A tinge of figs and black cherries hides in the back, barely nasally visible. The taste resembles a batch of sour cherries doused in dark chocolate, molasses, and toasted caramel. Once the cherries die away, a nice, smooth, roasty character finishes things off. The body is a firm medium, with a light carbonation and a rather smooth feel. Overall, a kinda surprisingly good fruity stout. It may not sound right, but it sure tastes right."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is cherries, chocolate and cream. The flavor is more of the same. I get some cream, smoke, cherry, chocolate and roasted malt. There is a roasted aftertaste. The cherries are slightly tart, but not as tart as I was expecting. Creamy, thick mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"D: I don't think this beer is overly drinkable. I'll stick with it for desert and thats about it."
"T- VERY tart. I'd had this before but don't remember it being quite this tart. Mouthfeel is a little thin but drinkability is quite good, especially if you like tart cherries. I'll be doing more of this for sure."
"D- The cherry taste is very intriguing and being a homer, it makes me miss the Michigan cherries..."
"D - I'm enjoying this beer however the cherry flavor is pretty damn strong making it hard to really want to drink another one right away its still worth a try though"
"D: I would probably get this again in the winter to see if things were different sitting next to the fireplace however it's not one that I would stock up on."
"D: This is a very enjoyable sipper."
"The resulting mouthfeel from the tartness is my only complaint here. Not overly sweet, like so many fruit beers. This is likely my last craft brew before I leave for the beer wasteland of South Korea for the summer, and it was a pleasure. Not sure I could handle more than a couple pints on any given night, but it goes big with its flavors. makes it work, and well."
"Beer poured black as night with little to no head. Nose is roasted malts and a hint of cherry. Taste is primarily roasted malts with the sour cherry blended in fairly well. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth but there is a lack of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. The cherries are blended to where it is not overwhelming which is good but the sour stout concept combined with a lack of carbonation makes this not overly appealing. It was fun to try the concept though."
"D - Very unique. Not necessarily one that I'd drink a lot of, but certainly a beer that I'd drink again. The combo of stout and cherries is an interesting match that might not be the best for everyone. I dug it quite a bit though."
"D/Overall - I'm not typically one to only drink a certain style of beer in a certain season, but this is a great option for a summertime beer with ""stout"" essence. Not too heavy and quite crisp overall. Great for a backyard session on a not too hot day, or a summertime evening jam session on the front porch."
"I'd say this is a very good interpretation on a fruit flavored stout. It has good presentation and is a good drink. The only knock I have on this is the price. Six packs can be north of $16."
"Notes - Medium mouthfeel"
"To me, this beer is more like a porter than a stout. Not very creamy. Not very dark. The tart cherry flavor is at first a bit exciting to the tongue, but it gets old quickly. I can't see having more than one of these at a time. The smell of the cherry is nice the whole way through."
"The true star of this beer is the cherry. The stout itself serves only as a backdrop. Par for the course for Bell's. Actually it drinks kinda like a porter. Delicious. The cherry is true Michigan. Not a sweet dessert cherry Like you would put on a sundae, rather a tart masterpiece. It adds so much to the smell and taste of this beer. Don't expect to pound a sixer of this beer but as a beer lover you must try one."
"D: Not a bad beer, but i wouldn't want more than one in a six pack."
"M/D- medium-full bodied, low carbonation. the sour cherries make this one that isnt goin to go down fast. not unpleasing just good in small doses over time."
"M/D - Full silky body. Easy to drink but I could only take 1 in a night. Would be a perfect desert beer with some fruit or chocolate cake."
"D- This is one that one is enough. Overall, the sourness of the beer would lend itself to a single serving."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a wine glass. Pours a deep dark black, with a nicely formed tan head. The nose is roasted malt, smoke, chocolate and coffee. Surprisingly no evidence of cherry here. Upon taking a drink, I get more of the above, especially the smoke and chocolate, although finally a bit of the promised cherry flavor. Although not much of a cherry stout, this one is still a pretty good stout, very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D: ABV is nowhere to be found and the flavors are interesting, enjoyable, and very easy to drink. This would definitely be one of my go-to winter brews if it was available in CA."
"Overall Impression: A really good balance of flavors. Not nearly as tart or sweet as I expected, which is a good thing. I have always been a fan of the combination of cherry with dark chocolate, and this did not disappoint. It also has a yeasty homebrewed quality to it that I enjoyed. It reminds me of a Chocolate Cherry Stout I brewed years ago."
"This is quite nice, I really like how the rich Stout / malt character is balanced by the kiss of tart cherries; I can't imagine the texture of the two components working together any more harmoniously than they do. The fruit and the roast grain somehow combine to contribute an almost smoked prune sort of flavor (more fruity than smoked). A damn fine beer that makes me quite happy that I can now get this locally in Arizona."
"D - Surprisingly good tasting, thought it would be more cherry flavor but it was well balanced with the rest of the ingredients. Not an everyday beer but glad I tried it."
"Nice, different style of beer. Definitely willing to try more than once."
"Barely drinkable. A noble attempt, truly, but really an odd flavor profile and that's that."
"D: Taste is alright, goes down relatively easily. This a beer that one of two would be enough."
"This is a very good beer. Not one to have more than a couple in a night, but excellent on those cold autumn, winter, and early spring nights."
"D - A good stout; it is nice that they didn't make this overwhelmingly sweet."
"Black pour with two fingers of head. Aroma is slightly sour cherry, oak, roasted malts, and lip gloss. The flavor is tart cherry up front on top of a bed of lightly toasted malts, with an odd lip gloss finish. The body is medium and the carbonation is somewhat high. Finding a good cherry stout seems to be a tough task...I thought if anyone could do it Bell's could, but unfortunately this beer just is not very good."
"Pours black, dark black, with a nice little 2 cm brown head. The bubbles are a little loose, and dissipate kind of quickly. No real lacing to speak of. Looks right around average. The aroma is immediately filled with cherries. A bit of sweetness, like overripe ones, and a bit of tartness, like the slightly yellow and orange ones. Nice cherry aroma, but still enough of the coffee, chocolate smells to let you know that it's a stout under there. Overall, a good smell, it does what it says here. The flavor is interesting, tart, juicy, and fruity, backed up with coffee, with a taste of dark chocolate. But the dark cherry flavor dominates overall. It finishes a bit dry, I wish there was more chocolate sweetness to accent the cherry flavor, as opposed to sort of bitter astringent coffee, but it's a great blend of stout flavors and cherry flavors. The body, is medium, maybe a little heavier than that, but still lighter than I expected, maybe because of the cherries. A decent chewiness though. The carbonation is very low - I would've liked a little more, though I can see how it would be easy to have too much in a beer like this. It's a little high on the ABV scale, woudln't want more than one, though I did enjoy the one I had. I could see this being much better - primarily with a slightly more sweet stout, but it was a pretty good beer."
"Tastes of sour cherries and peach juice accompanied by a wood and chocolate note that sort of reminded me of some red wines. Mouthfeel is delicate and silky in texture, but its sour nonetheless. A touch of alcohol rounds out smell, taste, and mouthfeel, probably most noticeably at the end of each sip. Cherry Stout is interesting, and I'm glad I grabbed a bottle, but I'm equally glad I didn't buy a six-pack."
"This is quite nice, I really like how the rich Stout / malt character is balanced by the kiss of tart cherries; I can't imagine the texture of the two components working together any more harmoniously than they do. The fruit and the roast grain somehow combine to contribute an almost smoked prune sort of flavor (more fruity than smoked). I didn't expect cherry-flavored coffee flavor to work, but Bell's figured it out."
"Overall I found this brew enjoyable and wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again."
"J"
":("
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with a thin dark tan colored head which gaves way to some lacing. The smell is of roasted malts, coffee malts and cherries. The tasted is of deep roasted malts and caramel malts. The first couple sips were of tart cherry with the rest tasting more like a sweet cherry. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and thick. The drinkability is good, it is smooth and has good flavor it could get a little old though the cherry could get a little bit much after a while."
"Overall, this is a decent stout. The cherries really come across as cherry juice, like the bottle says, but it seems like they could be incorporated in a better fashion. Glad I got to try this but I probably won't seek it out in the future, especially with Bell's other offerings."
"Hats off to Bell's for this one. It's the first Cherry anything I've had besides sours and it has set a commendable bar."
"D- Like a lot of the stouts I've been drinking, this one is cpmplex enough to savor, but works well in large gulps as well. I'm not sure I could string too many together though, because of the sweet and tart intensity."
"Drink ability was good. For 7 percent this is like candy. Just think the tart cherries were too overpowering and hid the stout characteristics that make them my favorite style of beer."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. I don't think my score reflects how much I liked this, but I swear I enjoyed it. It's unique and good enough to keep me coming back for more."
"D – A lesser brew by one of the great breweries. That still equals quite drinkable."
"Definitely recommended, a little different than some of the other styles and a refreshing change."
"Pours opaque black with light tan head. Nose has a whiff of cherries but is surprisingly light for this style. Palate has plenty of sour cherries, not overly sweet, but just mostly sour cherries with a poor attempt at the roasty malt flavors to balance it out somewhat. Low carbonation and a very light, watery finish."
"Overall impression: Not bad at all, but the more I think about it, the more I think this is a good candidate for cellaring. Seems like it could improve if the cherry is given a chance to blend with the other elements. I might pick up a few more to experiment with."
"Bell's deserves some points for creativity, for cherry and fruit generally can work well when the flavors blend instead of conflict, and for my palate, anyway, when sweet and sour are in more harmonious balance. JD mentioned in our discussion that he found the cherry and coffee more disharmonious in the past than in this manifestation of Cherry Stout. Unfortunately, I must disagree, for it seemed to be moving in different, somewhat incompatible directions in this version. A sweeter version, with lots of caramel, would be very interesting to taste."
"drinkability: sessionable stout, no bad, I think it's undertaed on here because it has fruit in it."
"This is a good session beer that hides its alcohol content well."
"D: This is a decent beer, but I think I'd prefer it without the cherry addition. It seems that the reviews are a mixed bag on this one - I fall somewhere in the middle. If I had my choice, I'd probably just opt for a brooklyn chocolate if I wanted a sweeter stout or even just a straight expedition."
"D: One to sip. Only a 7% and I need to sip it. It's a good beer...but..."
"M - Thick, chewy, viscous."
"Flavor...Brett? haha, I don't remember hearing or reading anything about Brett, but the sour and tart cherries really resembles the characteristics. Tasty, sweet and tart...like dark chocolate covered cherries. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Very good adventurous stout."
"I bought a 6-pack and I'm on the 5th bottle now. It's growing on me, but the cherry taste never integrates or tames enough for me to enjoy it. It feels like a grenadine chaser. But I don't want a grenadine chaser. I want a creative flavorful stout."
"Overall I thought this beer benefitted greatly from the cask conditioning - the cherry flavors were fuller and better integrated. Worth a shot."
"The upfront astringency is hampering the mouthfeel a little bit, otherwise it drinks fine. Drinkability is a hair above average for a stout of the ABV."
"Decent beer."
"D- Drain pour. And I *never* drainpour beers. Just not my cup-of-tea I guess. I like Bell's IPAs, this stout left a bad taste in my mouth. I cannot recommend this beer, too much of an acrid tangy fruity mess."
"Drinkability: Hard for me to tell if this is well crafted or not, as I can't finish it."
"If cherries and fruity beers float your boat, then this might be the stout for you. I, however, am not a huge fan of cherries, and having them covered in chocolate and served to me in beer form isn't totally appealing. It's not horrible, but I won't search this out again."
"Thin head that dissipates quickly, with a slight bit of lacing. Very, very black, dark, chocolate looking beer. Considering it was cherry, although a stout, I thought it might be a bit lighter. I'm not sure what I exactly think of the smell, it smells very much like chocolate cherry cordials, which I enjoy, but I'm not sure if the smell is somewhat cheap. I think its a good thing. Very much a dessert beer, and its drinkable in terms of stouts being drinkable, but this is definitely a sipper. Has a very chocolate taste, but don't expect to drink more than one of these. Would probably be great with some type of dessert beers."
"M/D- decently thick for a stout. bordering on imperial stout viscosity. the carbonation is subtle and spot on the style of beer. not the easiest of drinkers. the contrasting, bold flavors make this one go down a good bit slower than most"
"D: Good one, very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing."
"drinkability is ok - i do like this stout over dark horse blueberry stout"
"I've had this on-tap and other bottles and it has shown better in the past. In this price range it's hard for me to not pick up their old ale instead."
"D= This is a really quality beer for what it is actually. I've heard a little guff given to this one but I enjoy it quite a bit. It's not something I would drink a whole lot but tonight it's really tasty. Another winner from Bells."
" Beau"
"D: Could barely finish it due to tiresome sourness."
"Very dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light. Thin dark tan veil of a head. Smells like chocolate covered tart cherries. Tart cherries are very prominent in the taste. Then comes a semi-sweet chocolate finishing with a bitter coffee. I really like how the flavors come together. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew...something I've been unable to do with many other offerings from Bell's."
"Medium body has a delicate carbonation. Tasty stout from Bells."
"With the exception of Belgian lambic, I am not a fruit beer guy, but my buddy talked me into trying one and I liked it enough I ordered it again. I have a feeling I wouldn't like it as much from a bottle or standard tap with a higher level of carbonation, but ... only one way to find out."
"D: Drinkable, but not something I'd readily return to. Not bad, though."
"Certainy not a session beer but I enjoy one now-and-again as a treat."
"That's all."
"D- not bad, but not my favorite,"
"Overall this was an interesting stout, that I actually enjoyed more than I thought (this was a recommendation by a staff member). Worth a Look."
"The pour is fairly standard, black with a thin dark brown head that recedes to nothingness rather quick. The nose is great, I like it a lot more than out of the bottle. Chocolate, licorice and a excellent sour cherry character, the chocolate being the most dominant. Noticeable roast with a mild malt bitterness present, but not so much as to clash with the tartness from the cherry. The palate opens with a tart cherry character, almost tannic with sourness quite prominent. This is followed by the chocolate and licorice that balance the sourness. Chocolate character is mostly dark choc in nature, lending a bitterness that persists on the finish with the cherry tartness carrying through as well. Carbonation is on the low side, enhancing the experience, and allowing the medium body, tart cherries and dark chocolate the come together quite well. While I spent close to 30 minutes nursing my pint, unlike the bottle, this is something I'll gladly revisit. Now, if only I could get down to CK when they had Two Hearted on cask..."
"Drinkability suffers a bit from the oddity, but is still above average."
"12-oz bottle. Thin brown head the disappeared rapidly. No lacing. Black, black, black. Not much aroma either. Some coffee, dark chocolate and cherry. Actually smells a lot like a chocolate covered cherry. Taste is sour and only slightly bitter. Texture is medium with mild carbonation. Long finish with a touch of tinniness on the end. A very interesting brew. I would try this again with food but not by itself. Taste buds need recovery time between sips to recover from sourness."
"The scent from the bottle is surprisingly sweet. After the pour, for some reason I'm not getting a whole lot of sweetness, but rather a very mild smokiness - seems on par with most stouts. Pours like you would expect a stout to in terms of color. Modest head with a slight reddish hue that fades quickly. The payoff here is the taste. You get a blast of VERY tart cherry which forms the base of the brew! Here is what makes this beer excellent in my opinion - so many beers with fruit in the title end up having very synthetic fruit flavors (i.e., SA Cranberry Lambic and Cherry Wheat) but this one doesn't have an artificial syrup flavor. (Additionally, I am at a loss for those reviewers who can't figure out why this beer is so 'tart', especially when the bottle tells you to expect it to be so!!!). The tartness then mellows a bit and you can taste some smoky coffee notes you would expect from a stout. Mouthfeel is good - seems a little thicker than your average stout, which I like. As this one warms the tartness dies a little and gets sweeter just as you would expect. I can recall when this beer had a higher abv and was even thicker and richer (and a little better from what I can recall, honestly)...too bad it changed, but still a fabulous winter brew!!! Easily my all-time favorite seasonal."
"Drinkability is average, I can finish one of these but the cherry juice is too sweet for me to drink much more. Overall it is an interesting beer but I would have preferred the cherry flavor be a little more subtle."
"Drinkability: This was the first beer I've had from Bells' that I wasn't really a fan of. The flavors just didn't come together for me, and the sourness of the cherries was off-putting in this style of beer. The cherry flavor seems more of a distraction from the stout flavors. While it wasn't terrible, I probably wouldn't buy it again. Maybe just not my thing."
"Usually I don't appreciate sweeter beers, but this one seems pretty good. A nice, solid stout."
"Moderate amount of carbonation gives this beer a pretty full, well-rounded body. Still retains some creamy feel. Flavor starts out pretty tart from the cherries. Plenty of roasted flavors in there as well, with a touch of dark chocolate. Lightly sour finish. The more I sip this, the more I like it. It was a bit odd at first, but this is pretty good. Not my go-to stout for sure, but a pleasant break from the norm."
"Bell's usually releases great beer. This is one of those rare cases where they miss the mark. Cherry Stout needs a little more of everything except cherry to succeed. More malt, more coffee, more body, more strength in the nose. You get the picture. If you're looking for a good Bell's beer, you can do much better than this one. Keep looking."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very good stout, easy to drink. Good alcohol content for the flavor it has."
"Drinkability- Not the greatest brew I've ever had. The tartness of the cherry is too much for the rest of the beer. It all doesn't work well together and I either need more stout or less cherry. Either way, really glad I tried (and didn't buy an entire sixer)."
"I really enjoyed this."
"D - An ok beer, but not my style. Too sweet."
"Bell's Cherry Stout is sweet--literally and figuratively. Not as thick as the best stouts, with a wine-like taste and feel, but very tasty and worth seeking out every autumn."
"Overall, very drinkable, and pretty well balanced"
"Not sure I really care for this beer. I would not buy again. This was this months selection in the office BOTM club."
"D - A good beer, but not an everyday beer. This could pair really well with chocolate desserts, though for most purposes I'd prefer a simple oatmeal stout."
"Drinkability is up there. This goes down smooth and doesn't have a hint of alcohol, and the nice mouthfeel makes it even easier. Confession: I've played beer pong with this beer before, it's so drinkable. A nice quality beer from my favorite brewer and a great seasonal one to pair with food, especially desserts."
"M/D - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. The cherry is a touch too strong and brings the drinkability down a notch, but still rather drinkable. Be sure to drink colder than you would most stouts though because it becomes rather unpleasant as it becomes warm."
"D- This beer lacks balance in my opinion, and the mouth feel was really too thin for what I like in a stout. The tart cherry(almost vinegary) flavor really stays with you for awhile. I'm glad I tried but also very happy that I only bought a single bottle."
"Not very drinkable all things considered, very bitter and thick. Good to try though."
"pours a dark black color with a black cherry ring and some nice lacing..looks good..the smell was chocolate and currant fruit semi sweet chocolate and cocoa the taste was ok it had a bad cherry flavor was not tart enough and the stout was not balanced between the tartness the hops and malts the cherry flavors did not take this stout anywhere it just was not in balanced IMO wont be buying again"
"Looks and smells very good on the pour. Scent of dark chocolate or cocoa, just a tinge of dark fruitiness and definately some smokeyness. Salty, tangy, taste is chocolate and cocoe and sweet at first then the stout characteristics and the longer it sits the more sour/tart it gets. Bitter and refreshing it is! - But a bit to much sour/tartiness for this toungue. The cherry taste and smell is completely lost in my opinion. A nice unique brew and not a bad brew but I dought my puckered cheeks can handle this one again any time soon. Not sesionable for me."
"This is my first time having Cherry Stout in several years. The last couple times I had it I was not a big fan. Either my tastes, or this beer, has changed - because I like this a lot. Pours nearly black in color with generous tan head that recedes to a wave of nice lacing on the surface of the brew. Smells predominantly of cocoa with subtle dark cherries and vanilla. Taste is more cocoa, vanilla, and cherries; but this time the cherries are slightly tart. But not nearly as tart as I remember previous bottles of this being. Body is on the heavier side, with plenty of carbonation. For a fruit-flavored stout, I find this highly drinkable, even sessionable. I'll seek this out when visiting my family for Christmas."
"D: this beer is rich and heavy in the tart fruit characteristics. Not exactly a session beer... and at the hefty price tag, its not exactly a go to beer. It's a nice unique stout, but I was hoping for something a little different, a bigger stout character would have been desired."
"D: Average, the sweetness may be the only thing that keeps this down."
"CHEERS!!"
"M/D: Pretty poor and not very drinkable"
"Pitch black in color with a 1/2 finger head. Aroma is of dark fruits, chocolate, and roasted malts. Taste is dominated by tart cherry with a light acidity plus chocolate/roasted malt and coffee. Medium mouthfeel and a short sweet finish. At two years old, I think that this still has the staying power for a few years to come. I can't wait to find out."
"Overall good, not great, but good. Bought a single bottle at Capone's in Norristown, PA. Drinkable, but I would pair this with cheese or a dessert rather than with a meal."
"Pours a deep opaque sable with a fairly thick tan head. Aroma is rich and smoky with undertones of coffee, cherries and unsweetened chocolate. Smoky, slightly sweet flavor has a firm and slightly sour cherry tone as well as hints of coffee and chocolate. Silky smooth texture is just a little tingly."
"D - Definitely a dessert beer... Unique and memorable, but not necessarily in a good way... The components here seem a little forced... An excellent appearance and aroma aren't complemented by the disappointing taste, mouthfeel and drinkability... Honestly is a little bit of a struggle to get all the way down..."
"D - This beer is very good to me, but two of my favorite styles are Stouts and Sours, so naturally you combine the two, and you have a beer that isn't for everyone, but perfect for me"
"Didn't have the mouth feel of a Guinness, a lot thinner but a nice flavour all the same. Got better as it warmed up."
"Well, hats off to Bell's for trying something new and unique. I don't mean at all to knock this attempt or the brewery, it just doesn't sit well with me. Hope you enjoy it more than I did."
"Update: I wonder if the sixer I got over a year ago was bad. I had it on-tap in Pittsburgh and it was quite good. Still not as much stout taste as I would like, but it wasn't overly cherry. Nice dark color with good head. Went down smooth with some good stout characteristics."
"D - It's flavor is a good experiment into fruit-added beers but this one is, for drinkability, a hard combo to handle. The burnt, bitter malts and tart cherries in conjunction are rather harsh and will cause involuntary head twitching. A good beer overall though. One that may be best enjoyed on a cool fall evening as it warms up."
"D - Expecting this to be a good beer, I was not disappointed. Though not an everyday stout, I contend that it does have a time & place. When said time & place arrive, it's spot-on."
"The taste is good, I just think that there could be more complexity. I would definitely like to try this one again fresh."
"Poured dark brown with some red tints. Modest head that reduce down to nothing very quickly. Aroma? I got some sweet something, may have been cherries, not much else. The taste was sour cherries and the barest hint of chocolate late, at the back of the throat. Feel was full bodied with minimal carbonation. Drinkability defaults to above average because this is not a beer for everyone, but if it's in your taste wheelhouse, you could drink a few. This was an interesting beer. The sour cherry taste was true to form, as advertised. As mentioned, not a beer for everyone, and I'm of two minds about it myself. The beer could almost replace a wine in certain situations."
"D: This beer is dangerous as hell. At 7%, it is EXTREMELY quaffable. If I give a 4.5/5 on drinkabilty, it normally means I have hard time putting the glass down. This holds true. As soon as the glass hits the table, I'm ready for more. Awesome beer. Only thing keeping it from a 5 is not sure I can do 2 in a row."
"D- Very good dessert beer, would compliment nicely with almost any pastry (chocolate of course) and I would suggest something with cherry flavor as well (hoping to amplify the cherry taste of the beer). Overall wonderful beer, though I do not think that I could drink more than two at one sitting, but definately need to try it!"
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is very low, due to the sweet, sour combination of the cherries. Overall, I really enjoy Bell's offerings, but this one, I'm afraid, will be a drain pour for me. Will not buy again. Skal."
"D - suprisingly plesant, ABVs hidden well, the natural cherry flavor is a plus"
" notes and flavors."
"Thin body for a stout. It's relatively smooth, but too light. The unpleasant sourness ultimately makes this a tough one to swallow."
"I poured into a pint glass to absolutely no head. There was a thin brown film on top, but that's it. The brew is jet black. There is not even a hint of light coming though and very little carbonation. I smell tart cherries, roasted malt, and alcohol. I immediately taste the cherry flavor. It is very tart. The tart cherry flavor sticks to my lips. It is followed by bitter, coffee flavor. The more I drink, the more tart and bitter it becomes. It's not terrible, I just would have trouble downing more than one or two as is the case tonight. Bell's makes some great beer this is not one of their best."
"D - Too weird and too sweet. I'll pass."
"Inky blackness, subdued tan head, ring and minor lace. Tipping the surface reveals small bubble carbonation in all that blackness. Smell is strong coffee, cherry liqueur. Taste is sweet dark cherry, mid swallow chocolate layers, black forest cake, tort with stewed prunes, over ripe cherry. Nice balance with bitterness, chocolate malt, black liquorice, low to medium astringency not really a factor. With air, more dark sour fruit, maraschino cherry in brandy, increasing sourness with air and warming. Medium bodied mouthfeel .. very nice overall, an interesting beer, could also pass for a porter."
"heard a lot about this one and it didn't quite live up to the hype for me. pours a dark brown with a slight amber hue. thin but easily agitated medium tan head. smells of tart chocolate. definite cherry tartness balanced decently with chocolate roastiness. goes down fairly easy with a residual tart after taste. not bad, but I was led to expect more."
"On the whole, it's almost as though this is two different beers poured into one, each beer somehow remaining separate from the other. I like the idea, and I really liked this beer at first, but as I moved through the glass the cherry just became overwhelming and unappetizing, and almost sickeningly tart and sour."
"The malty appeal at the forefront of each sip is enjoyable, but the lingering sour negatively balances things for me. I yearn for a more natural cherry feel. It's a strong body overly juiced [insert Jose Canseco joke here]. The peculiar mouthfeel leaves this one tough to finish."
"Very nice and thick, I brought a few of these back to Florida from Michigan. While Expedition is still my favorite from Bell's, who knew that I would enjoy a cherry stout. The head drops down quickly, the smell is, well, very cherry. Taste wise it's a bit like chocholate covered cherry coffee with a bit of alcohol in it, perhaps a perfect breakfast beer. I can't say I'd really want more than two of these at a time, it's still a good 'fruity' stout, so I enjoy it for what it is. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: Decent. I do so love a great stout and Bell's does make a great many of them, but, well, this one just doesn't quite do it for me. Pass the Kalamazoo or Expedition, please!"
"Pours dark, almost black. bells company was kind enough to unclude a thin, tan head and some medium lace. smelled like coffee, malts, cherries, and some coco. the flavor was of cherries and coco, but tart. felt full and creamy. was ok, but won't be getting any others"
"D: I could have one or two. It's not awful just not my style."
"D: Very drinkable, a great, fairly complex stout without a huge ABV. I could enjoy a few of these on a cool night. Really like how the cherry flavor does not get lost in either the aroma or taste. Look forward to more of these in the future."
"D- kicking ass in flavor and seemingly lackluster in other departments, this is still one delicious and dangerously drinkable stout. no evidence of booze in this flavor packed monster and the cherry juice makes it inviting enough to keep drinking away without regard for the rustic burnt flavor. bell's has created quite an anomaly for me here, and my first fruit stout worth remembering."
"(D)- Most definitely a sipper. For 7%abv, this feels alot stronger than that due to how potent the acidity is that the cherries give off. One would be good for me at a time. Its a nice beer that should be enjoyed slowly though."
"D - I am enjoying the flavor of this beer. It is definitely just a sipper for me. A good sized gulp just makes the puckering effect a little too much for me. This puckering really reduces the overall drinkability for me."
"this brew pours up jet black in color with a nice tan head. the nose is cherries, dark malts, chocolate, marshmallows. I taste big malts immediately followed by super sourness! same deal....cherries and chocolate malts, full bodied, low carbo. Good buuut I could do without the sour insanity here...."
"Drinkable, the cherry helps the alcohol go down."
" Buy this if you dare, but you must like cherries, and you must have patience."
"Drinkability is ok. If I wanted more. Thing is, the cherry just comes off a bit too juicy, like the stout and cherry juice never really blended together all that well. As a result, I don't get as much actual stout flavor as I'd like."
"D: Drinkability is average. The flavors are a little overpowering and the mouthfeel is a tad off, but a pretty good tasting beer."
"Pours hazy cloudy black with an enormous purplish head. The smell is slight and roasted. But, Oh, the Flavor - the Flavor is overwhelmingly sour cherry, it simply blasts everything else away. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth, but that intense, overwhelming cherry flavor makes this beer nearly undrinkable"
"2008 - One Year Cellared - Pours pitch black completely opaque with a small very quickly receding caramel colored head. Smells of cherries, coffee, and tobacco notes comprise the nose. First sip is cherries, past ripe dark fruits, deep roasted malts, and a splash of tobacco. I had this fresh when the cherries were ruling this beer, now the cherries have mellowed and stepped aside allowing for a more welcoming brew. Medium bodied and now less carbonated, the beer never gets too sweet or too bitter."
"I'm glad I just bought the single, this beer isn't really my thing. Good to try though if you are a Bell's fan."
"Other than appearance, this doesn't really come across as a stout to me. (Perhaps why it is classified as it is here despite the name). Fruity, sweet, tart, and syrupy.. it is one of the better fruit-flavored beers I've had."
"The other beer comes when you taste it, and this is where it shines. The perfect balance of roasty, chocolatey stout and tart cherry. Doesn't really shine so far as complexity goes like a lot of the bigger stouts, but it's a nice beer interpretation of a chocolate covered cherry. Starts off roasty and cocoaey, and quickly turns tart - the cherry is all tartness and not at all cloying sweetness, which I love. For me, it's close, but taste is closer to a 4.5 than a 4. There is little (hardly any) carbonation here, and the mouthfeel really doesn't pack a punch at all. Drinkability is amazing - I could keep knocking these back forever. Definitely not a complex beer, but great for a relaxing, straightforward fruit beer. Far better than many I've had. I would love for this to be available here."
"This was interesting. That's really the best word for it. It starts out like a stout with some roast and bitterness, turns to cherry, and finishes entirely tart like cherry juice. This was a good beer to share with someone who does not like bitter hoppy aftertastes."
"This beer starts off very stout like. Plenty of roasted malt and cocoa. This eventually gives way to loads of tart cherry flavor. I would much prefer the less cherry flavor and more of the stout to shine through. The finish is a mix of bitterness from the roasted malt and tartness from the cherries, and I dont really care for it. Nice concept but I dont really care for the overly tartness of this beer."
"D: This is not bad. I mean the flavors work for me and it goes down pretty easy. The feel is a bit off for me and the look and aroma are bit of a let down. Still it doesn't fall below the average area, just a lot of it is average at times. With that said, I am glad I gave it go and I would not mind having this again. Not bad at all."
"Unfortunately what disappoints the most with this offering is the taste of the beer. The taste is sour and fake tasting and unfortunately there is not much that impresses with Bell's Cherry Stout. The cherry taste within the stout is reminiscent of a cough syrup fake cherry flavor and unfortunately because the cherry is so overpowering it takes away from anything else in the stout taste. Though there is a mild roasted nature to the stout, it is muted by the fact that the cherry nature of the beer is so overly highlighted in the taste. Had the cherry been a bit more subtle and a bit less sour, perhaps this offering could have panned out alright."
"Bells makes some good beers, this is not one of them in my opinion."
"Very drinkable except the high abv"
"Smells weird & looks black. Tastes...terrible. First Bell's brew I've had that was just off. The cherry taste is rather sickening, not even rising to the pleasantry of cough syrup. The malt interacts with the cherry yuckily. Blech. Thankfully my wife is around to finish it, she likes it quite a bit. Away it goes."
"The base beer is pretty tasty on it's own, but the Cherry doesn't really add much beyond a light fruit character and tartness which seems out of place."
"D - Tough one, one might think this is an odd combination. From the nose I thought for sure there was going to be too much cherry flavor, but it's so balanced! Wouldn't want to drink a sixer (and probably couldn't!), but I would definitely want to drink this all the time if it was available."
"Overall, I was scared that it was too old (soy sauce taste) but I really enjoyed the cherrys. I am slowly sipping away at this one. Probably a one-only beer. But I will enjoy another one some other night."
"I am thoroughly impressed with this *wonderfully* crafted stout of Bell's. Quite possibly one of the best stouts I have ever had. Brilliant!"
"D: Good, though I wouldn't order another or buy in a six-pack."
"This is a one and done for the night kind of beer. Its a sipper, very good though."
"Drinkability - Drinkable, but it is a sipper to be sure."
"Picked up a single bottle at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $2. I'm tasting this side by side with the Bell's Bourbon Barrel Cherry Stout. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my shaker glass. Appears a dark brown, almost black color with about an inch of dense tan foam. The foam settles to a thin layer within a minute or so. As expected, this beer is quite different than it's barrel aged brother. Smells of sour cherries, coffee, and chocolate malts. Tastes of tart cherries, mocha, like a cherry infused sweet & sour sauce, and molasses. Medium in both body and carbonation. I favor the complexity of the barrel aged version, but this is still a tasty stout. Worth checking out if you have the chance."
"This beer is delicious. I will definitely be looking for more of this Gem."
"Anyone that has been drinking with me has heard me say, ""Fruit does not belong in beers"" or ""If you have to add fruit to a beer to make it drinkable, then it is not a good beer."" This, however, is the exception to the case. The cherry flavor is so mild, that it just enhances the richness of the malts. It opens up the taste buds to really appreciate the total experience. Even if you are like me and am not a fan of fruit beers, I would recommend at least giving this one a chance."
"D- It's tough getting through this one, but I can finish it. Would I be able to get down another one? Probably not."
"D- kind of a novelty. the bottle was easy enough to finish, but i cant see myself going for more than one of these at a time."
"D - Very unique flavor! Not as much ""stout"" taste as I would expect. There's definitely more focus on the cherry aspect of this beer. Very easy to drink, but a little more complex than I think I'm tasting. Definitely a tasty beer and one I'm going to have to try again to fully appreciate."
"D: The intensity of flavor doesn't throw me off. I could have several and enjoy every last drop. But it is very thick, and that does impede drinkability ever-so-slightly."
"this is remix of a bad chocolate cherry custard. i don't taste any flavors, i feel a clotted egg protein sensation. the tartness at the back of my throat wants me to drain pour it."
"Thick brown head sits on top of a black body. Pretty good lacing and head retention. Aroma is very roasty with hints of tart cherries. The taste is a combination of roasted coffee sweet chocolate and loads of tart cherries. Perfect beer for anyone that likes fruit flavored beers and stouts."
"Cherries make a nice highlight in this stout."
"I poured a bottle halfway up a wine glass. The appearance is black with very little head. Smells faintly of chocolate and fruit and some slight coffee, not a lot of nose on this in general. Taste is the same with a black cherry tone, just a bit of tartness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky medium body, not to sticky for a fruit stout. I could drink a fair amount of these in the winter, the acid balances out the sweetness well. Certainly worth a try, another fine Bells Stout."
"Conclusion: Quite an interesting fruit beer for sure...It's pretty tasty, just a little overwhelming in its combination of ultra sweet and ultra tart characteristics...probably not a beer I'd drink on its own again, but maybe split a 12oz between me and the lady with some bittersweet chocolate cake?"
"Drank okay the ABV is well hidden, but, the tastes weren't really pulling together for me, expected so much more from this one"
"Some might be put off by the powerful cherry taste, but I found this stout to be enjoyable. It's definitely not your typical stout. Makes a good dessert or after dinner beer, but would not recommend it with a meal."
"D: alcohol isn't very noticeable, but the flavor isn't very preferable to me so i wouldn't keep drinking it"
"Rich and creamy with a sour twang in the finish - a great beer to get Super Sunday off an running."
"Overall....Ill get this again..part out of a nice change to stouts..part out of fear that Bells might leave Chicago again..."
"7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"Poured black as I would expect from a stout, but the head dissipated much more quickly than I would have wanted. The first whiff is cherries, dark tart cherries with subtle malt aromas. True enough, I was hit with tart cherry flavor. I was a little off put at first and then warmed to the experience over the course of the bottle. Perhaps the 8.5% ABV may have had something to do with it. I did notice some coffee and bitter chocolate malts in the back of the sip. After adjusting to the initial shock of being hit with tart cherries, I came to really like this ale and proceeded to drink another."
"Overall not too impressed...i'll admit I am not as familiar with stouts as I am a good hoppy beer...but i'm open to keep trying..."
"D: I could have a couple of these no problem, but any more and I'd be pretty tired of it."
"Overall, a good beer that is worth trying but don't hurt yourself trying to get it. I love most Bell's but this one is single instead of a triple or homerun that they usually put out."
"Low drinkability, between the ABV, price, and the sour cherry bomb with a coffee grounds backbone. I give respect for the idea, and this might be someone's favorite. They say go big or go home... and Bell's went big. But coming from a fan of fruit beers, this one is out of control."
"Note: My bottle said 7.0% abv and the site here says 8.5%"
"d: this one is difficult as it is such a unique beer. i like it but it is a slow sipper and one that would take off your tongue if you had back to back sessions. the abv works its magic too. as another reviewer put it, more cherry than stout but the stout toastiness is the final taste. However, the cherry doesn't let you forget that it's there and that is what you are left with."
"D: Wow !!! Cherry Stout.... More Cherry than Stout and that is the problems for me... I'm sorry to say I will not do this one again...."
"price/unit: $2.39 / 12oz"
"D= It was great to try this on tap the day after having it from the bottle. A solid beer and one I will surely try every year, just not my favorite Bell's stout (it has some famous brothers after all)."
" I'd only consider this a session beer because it's not one that's gonna get chugged down. Yes, the 8.50% ABV is strong, but not easily felt. I'm not sure when this is released, but this would be a good beer for the end of winter when the cherry blossoms are about to burst open with color and stouts are on their way out for the season. Only a Michigan Brewery could put this together and craft it well, but it doesn't mean that this is worth the effort. Only worth a shot if you're a fan of fruit beers of a different sort..."
"Overall, a bit one dimensional with the cherries in the flavor, but fun nonetheless."
"D - Not a session beer that's for sure...it would compliment any meal as a dessert"
"Cheers!!!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but somewhat oily, and little texture."
"Otherwise, great stuff. Way to go bells!!!"
"T. Cherry all the way as could have been forseen after taking a whif of this badboy, fairly creamy and smooth with slight carbonation which came as a surprise based off of the appearance, ends with a slight amount of choclate"
"I enjoy it as an apertif or dessert beer, although I'm sure there are many great food pairings for it. Really remarkable. Worth seeking out."
"On-tap at Liberty St. Tavern. Served in a goblet and paired with their habanero butternut squash soup. Appears a dark, murky brown with short tan head. The beer has a cocoa powder and cherry liquor aroma. The flavor is very juicy with the cherry upfront and all around, the malts take the backseat with mild roasted barley in the background. Very tangy mounthfeel, puckering, but still drinkable. Like cherries? Give this a try."
"M/D - Very nice light bodied stout with nice cherry and chocolate flavor. I don't think its an every day beer for me, but it would be great with dessert."
"Drinkable: I appreciate this beer as a cherry stout. That being said, I really wasn't a fan. I found it a little too tart and a little too overpowering for my tastes - this was more of a cherry beer with stout overtones than a cherry stout. In addition - though it was undetectable, which I appreciate - the alcohol was pretty high, which has gotta knock it down another half point or so. It took me a while to finish, as well, which is always a bad sign. Still, it's worth at least a try, as I'm actually sort of impressed they managed to dump this much flavor into a beer."
"Overall a home run for bells, another beer which is a little off the beaten path. Fans of stouts and sours will esp like this one."
"T: Full body, very smooth, light carbonation, but also a strong prick of sour and tart from cherries. Interesting balance of sweet and sour from the start. Strong roasted malt, chocolate like body, remind me of a lighter Expedition but has a very strong sour, dark cherry bite that dominates the finish and lingers for a long time afterwards. Very little presence of alcohol. A very nice stout, and very drinkable but not for everyone."
"I am not a fan of cherry, so this was never going to be a big win for me. I did find this brew to be a very interesting experience. Bells makes a fine brew and although this one is not for me, I can still appreciate the art that went into it. For those wanting to try a fruit beer, I would recommend giving this a try."
"Black body that has a ruby glint around the edges. First pour was headless, but the second one managed to get a mocha cream layer on the surface. Aroma was slightly lactic, milk sugar, chocolate. Cherry was slight if there at all, it may have been residual after a few sips. Chocolate and cherry tartness in the taste. Cherry isn't sweet, or fruity really. It reminded me of more tart dried cherries that have a little acidity even. Very smooth and velvety body, rich and malty. Easy to finish, although I didn't really want more than one..."
"Notes: Another great entry from Bell's. I recommend it."
"Bottle. Pours deep black with a light brown head that disapates fairly quickly.A light aroma of dark roast and tart cherries. Medium body, with some sweetness upfront. Warming sensation in my chest indicating alcoholic strength. Flavor is dominated by the sour cherries. Roast is evident, but not prominent. Some chocolate notes as it warms. Finishes slightly dry with a fair amount of tartness. Overall, a very nice beer, but certainly not what I was expecting. This stout pales in comparison to the other fine stouts Bells puts out, and while the sour cherries are fantastic, it just doesn't quite live up to expectations."
"A lot goin' on with this one. Quite enjoyable but a little on the heavy side..."
"D- This was a bit painful without food. Paired with some chocolate, it became more balanced. I still, however, will not drink this again."
"poured a rich black with a hint of red that cant be seen through with a heavy tan head that rises on this one. the sent of rich malt and tart black cherrys filled my nose, the taste in the begining is sour tart cherrys and coffie, the middle is the cherrys fading to a mild sweetness mixed with heavy dark roasted malt taking the forground, and the end is sour but sweet at the same time cherrys begging you to drink more! all the while the 8.5 % alchoal is hiden well. this is a great beer"
"Pours a very dark almost black color with burgundy edges and a small off white foam head. Roasted malty aroma with a strong cherry scent. Odd combination of roasted chocolate maltiness, coffee, oatmeal, toffee and sweet cherry flavor. Sweet and malty with a very dry finish."
"Future outlook: Situationally likely to purchase again. Might be interesting to try aged, so I'll probably sock a few of them away for another time and place."
"The aroma is really the best part of this beer. It's got cherries and toasted malt with chocolate and coffee. The appearance is dark brown with a small head. The taste has all the elements from the aroma but it is also sour and bitter in an astringent way. Not good. The palate is thick. Overall it's good but not really something I want a lot of."
"Medium body, lighter carbonation. Leaves a Warhead candy type of sour tartness in the mouth for an aftertaste. This one is going to be hard to finish. Maybe it's the age, maybe it's just the beer....I don't know. This one isn't working for me, though."
"D: The bottle I had lists the ABV as 7% rather than 8.5, which would make a little difference in overall drinkability. With the big, tart flavour, it's still a sipper, though."
"I'm generally a big fan of Bell's beers, but this one just isn't working for me. It's not bad, but I'm disappointed by it. I've never had it fresh, so it could be the accidental aging that I don't care for. I'm not sure. I won't go out of my way to find this one again."
"HV"
"Notes from 8/24/04"
"I felt the need to edit this as I forced down the end of the beer. It went from not good to horrific by the end. Bells, what were you doing?"
"I've enjoyed every other Bell's beer I've had but this was so bad, I gave it away to the bartender (who enjoyed it and confrimed that it was not skunked)."
"Could be improved by using real tart cherries, not juice concentrate. However, I really enjoyed it."
"I just don't see myself getting this again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall, a decent fruit stout from Bell's. However, if I were in the mood for one of their stouts in the future, I would go with Expedition or Kalamazoo."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer. Sour fans should seek it out. But if I want to spend this much on beer, I'll go for an excellent one, like Bell's Hopslam."
"If you are a fan of Sam Adam's Cherry wheat, you will be a fan of this darker cherry offering."
"D - This was tough to drink. Just too much tart cherry flavor. I need more sweetness to balance it out."
"Big disappointment from one of my favorite brewers."
"I had this beer a little while ago out of a six-pack I bought and I didn't care for it. So I just tried it again and still didn't care for it. The appearance was nice and the smell was attractive but that's where it ended. The flavors just didn't mesh it came across flat tasting and not something I'd buy again. That being said, this is the first beer from Bells' that I've felt this way about."
"This poured an opaque pitch black with a bit of dark tan head. It smelled like chocolate and burnt coffee with rich dark cherry. It tasted like very rich dark chocolate and mouth watering sour cherry, with a bit of copper hops and roasted barley. It was slightly thick with moderate carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was definitely a cherry stout. It had very nice flavor that was clean and drinkable, but it could have used a bit more body (surprising for a Bell's stout). This beer was a great change of pace from regular stouts."
"is it black with no head. smell is mild of malt, but not really getting any cherry from it. it is very malty and rich, roasty. the cherry flavor is more tart than sweet and it doesn't really complement the flavors very well. it is medium bodied and i wish it was a bit thicker. the aftertaste is very roasty and coffee like. the flavors almost blend well and balance out, but come up a bit short."
"not one of my all time favs.. but still really good...a great change after most stouts...refreshing and vibrant with cherry...great if you love cherries.."
"Interesting and well done. Worth trying if you like variety in your stout menu."
"At first I thought that this beer was mediocre, but now I have learned to enjoy it very much and get cravings for it often. The cherry blends really well with the roastiness of the stout."
"D - I've bumped this up a point as I've been drinking it as well. Although very sweet and intense, this is an extremely well done fruit beer with a perfect harmony of flavor. No off flavors or insane bitterness to deal with, and the sweetness or fruitiness never becomes overbearing. The best I've had from Bell's so far."
"Outstanding cherry stout! It's beers like these that Bell's should stick to."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable experience but one is enough in a setting."
"Pours a nice black viscous brew with a good tall fizzy tan head that reduces to a surface film rather quickly. Nose is roasted malt and alcohol with some slight cherry. Cherry is more apparent in the taste than the nose. Slightly tart, very slightly, decent cherry flavor is there with a good roasted malt background and some slight chocolate. Alcohol is very subdued for the abv. Mouthfeel is just where it should be in a stout like this, although I would like to see it a bit thicker. It is kind of watery. Drinkability is very good here, as the abv is well hidden, and they have made the cherries mingle quite well here. Certainly a unique brew, and one I would buy again if it were local. Bell's knows how to work a stout, thats for sure. Good beer."
"D: I bought a 6er... Its going to take a few months for me to be in the right mood to finish each one. Not a session beer by any means. Destroys the palate."
"low carbonation but I think it works for this stout. too much would overpower the flavor, drinks easy but it's definitely a sipper, sould go well with a cherry cheesecake or a cherry dessert."
"D-Not bad nothing I would drink very often though and in my opinion not worh 16 dollars a 6 pack."
"I found some of Bell's other stouts to be amazing (Java, Expedition, Double Cream), but this one is too experimental for my tastes. Might be worth a try if you're feeling up to it, but the flavors don't mesh well for me."
"D: not good. not good at all."
"D - Definitely not what I was expecting in a good way. Most fruit beer usually are not the best, but the cherries in this taste like the cherries I get in August when I visit Michigan and worked well in a stout setting. This makes for an excellent sipping and dessert beer."
"Drinkability is ok. Not a beer I'll search for but wouldn't turn one down. Good for dessert."
"12 ouncer purchased today at the brewery. Enjoyed in a Bell's tulip glass. (also from the brewery today...) Pours quite black under a reddish, dark tan head and leaving respectable lace on the glass. Nose is strongly of ripe cherries. Dark Chocolate, sour cherries, and more sour cherries. Pungent layers of cherry, over chocolate, some chalky drying out late. Not the greatest take on the style, but I'd like to try this as an after dinner/dessert beer....give me a piece of chocolate cake with this beer and I likely will be a happy man"
"drinkability is dissapointing. the overly sweet nature of the brew and the simplistic profile make this a one dimentional brew, without much else besides black malts and cherry flavor. for what it is, it is not bad, but the overpowering sweet juice and black malts do not come together to produce a complete brew."
"This beer is completely out of balance, way too much tart cherry for this cowboy. You'll see I also just reviewed Verhaeghe's cherry beer, and I gave it very high scores because the tart cherry character works in that beer. It doesn't in this one. I want more stout character and less tartness in my cherry stouts please and thank you."
"D: The taste while interesting really cuts it down for me. The roast and the cherries are pulling this beer in totally different directions. Nice attempt but fell just short."
"Pours dark brown/black color with barely any light reaching through the glass. Small amount of foam, little lacing. Slight cherry aroma, a bit of coffe, and bitter chocolate. Taste is equal to the nose. There are equal parts tart sourness to creamy malt. Lots of silky, dark malt flavors in the back with a slight cherry tint to a strange sourness. It's interesting to say the least. It's different from anything I've ever had. Tastes more like a winter warmer than a fruit beer, as the fruit flavor is not ever-present. Interesting stuff, but not one I would drink more than one of at a time."
"Well done and not over the top. It a good fruited beer and well worth a try for something a bit different if you can get your hands on some."
"Not a bad stout overall but I don't think that cherries belong anywhere near a stout, unless you're having a stout with a cherry-flavored dessert."
"D: A nice easy drinking beer. One of the best fruit beers I've had. Would love to try it with a dessert such as ice cream. A little on the filling side to drink more than one, but I'd definitely buy it again."
"Pours a deep brown with a remarkably thin tan head for the force of the pour. Head doesn't stick around too long. The nose notes plum first, then cherry compote. Fairly vinous with a musty, malty base. Wowza, the cherry flavor is way more upfront than I'd anticipated and I can at first sip see this getting cloying. Pretty tart, but the sourness morphs into a kind of lactic sweetness that I quite like in a stout. Unfortunately the sweetness continues to linger as toasty oat and nut try to peak out, drowning them out for a saccharine finish. The mouthfeel is pretty good - appropriately creamy - but leaves off with a milk like film that traps the sour cherry aftertaste against the back of the throat. Almost enjoyable on a lot of counts (Bell's does make some of my favorite stouts), but the cherries could be dialed back more that a bit. Some kind of cocoa or bitter dark chocolate note might help things here. Glad I tried it, but this isn't something I'm inclined to go back to."
"Not very drinkable, nor tasty, nor particularly impressive in the glass, this is the kind of brew that makes me glad my local bottle shop sells singles instead of just sixers. This way, I don't have to figure out what to do with five mediocre non-fruity 'fruit' 'stouts' that don't taste like 'stout', either."
"Pretty decent stout - first fruit stout I've had, so we'll see how it holds up. I'd take Bell's Kalamazoo over this in a heartbeat."
"flavor that left a dry aftertaste. The cherry flavor was more towards the finish. a very easy to drink brew, certainly not one of Bell's best stouts but a very tasty one."
"Bell's Cherry Stout pours a dense deep black with a short stiff tan head. The smell is decent with medium strong hints of malt and cherries. First taste is a thick and malty with an odd sour cherry flavor in the back. Mouthfeel is medium thick, slightly carbonated, and a little too much on the syrupy side. As a stout is does get a little better as it breaths a bit, the taste mellows slightly, but still isn't really that pleasant. Overall this is drinkable, but I'm not that impressed and wouldn't recommend it as a fabulous cherry stout one should have to try."
"Pours a solid black with a very little tan head that dissipates almost instantly. Aroma is a subtle dark chocolate and some sour cherries, a bit vinous with a chocolate flair, really nice nose. Taste is tart cherries with a bit of chocolate in the background, but the cherries command your mouths full attention. Its tart in the front, coats your entire mouth in tartness, some bitter roast makes its way through for a couple then your left with a tart cherry aftertaste. Sticky mouthfeel, low carbonation. Very unique brew. I'm not sure I'd seek this one out again, but I'm glad I got to try it."
"D- this seems easy to put down but it is a lil thick. a nice beer for the summer as my friend says but i think this beer would be great with a wings."
"Ok on the drinkability meter, and if nothing else, this is a unique brew. Would recommend pairing with a dry, 'dark' food."
"Dark syrupy cherry flavor. Sweet and sour fruit notes overpower the smooth stout flavor. The flavor is a bit too, well... flavored I guess I would say for my taste. I would prefer a more traditional stout flavor with only hints of cherry, but this is more like a cherry beer with hints of stout. Not bad though."
"I really like Bells beer, this was the first time that I ever did not like one, I looked a little flat when I poured it, and the taste was bad, cherry and dark beers should go well together, and this one did not. I know I will never drink this one again."
"Pours a very dark brown with red tinges, almost like a coca cola. Forms a nice, small tan head that disappears rather quickly. The cerries come to the fron of the nose with coffee backing them up quite nicely. The cherry taste does not reflect the smell but they're there nonetheless. Subtle and sweet. Rather light mouthfeel for a stout, especially a Bell's stout. Pretty drinkable but I wouldn't want more than on just because the tongue really couldn't take another one."
"very nice"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a generic shaker glass. Pours a thin jet black with ruby highlights, and left absolutely no lacing whatsoever. The beers aroma is tart pie cherries, dark chocolates and vanilla. The taste is much the same with the sour pie cherries coming out big up front, which I find distracting. Also espresso and dark chocolate come through on finish. The mouthfeel is really thin for the style. All in all its good for a drink but I don't think that I would order another."
"Certainly an interesting beer and worth the try, but I doubt I'd go back for more."
"I am enjoying the hell out of this one. While this is a rewrite of a previous review this beer has grown on me. Flavors are fantastic and drinks rather easily. This is Bell's most polarizing beer, as for me I thoroughly enjoy this one."
"Ok I don't know how drinkable this beer is, it's very full and very much a sipper! An awesome brew by Bell's!"
"D: The more I drink of this, the more I enjoy it."
"-Oelergud"
"Into a pint glass -- It poured a thick and dark black with a little bit of red. The head was super attractive and also reddish, and it smelled great as soon as it poured. Out of a limited selection of Bell's beers, I chose a fruit beer. Here's why: Michigan is where sour cherries are from, Sour Cherries are one of my favorite fruits, I love a good stout , and Bell's stouts are amongst their most well regarded beers. This 12oz bottle did not disappoint. A big stout with the traditional roasted flavors, big amounts of coffee and chocolate, balanced and countered with the sourness from the cherries. Not too much sweetness, and seriously, it smells just great. Not a beer I would drink several of in a row, but it definitely lives up to its reputation and I can't wait to get into more of the Bell's."
"Eric"
"Purchased at the Bell's General Store next to the Eccentric Cafe. No freshness dating, but 8339 printed on the bottle. Served in a nonic. Poured black with red highlights around the edges. One and a half inch mocha-colored head with decent retention, good consistency and lingering bands of lacing during the tasting. Scent of malt and dark fruit; very subdued but good presentation. Cherry flavor reveals itself as somewhat tart and is a nice complement to the chocolate flavor and malty backbone. Nice slick mouthfeel with good consistency; smooth and silky without being viscous. Really nice brew, but drinkabiity is somewhat limited in my opinion. I could see myself enjoying one or two on occasion, but not an all purpose go to stout in my opinion. However, delicious nonetheless."
"D - Moderately drinkable. While the base stout is solid and the cherry essence is nicely done, but the two elements do not mesh as well as I would have hoped. The cherries clash with the malt more than they compliment it, and the percived sweetness is a bit over the top."
"flavor that left a dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel was dissapointed for a stout. The mixing of cherrie juice must of watered down the mix a touch. Still a very easy to drink brew."
"worth a try but not one I'm going to pick up a six pack of any time soon"
"D: I can't get past the sour cherries. It is an interesting brew, but I wouldn't want another."
"Drinkability is a hard one on this, it's an interesting combination of flavors not one I would have thought went well together but it worked for me. I sipped my way through the glass and enjoyed it .I wouldn't want one every night but once an a while would work I would label it a must try at least one to pass judgment on yourself"
"Bottle code on back of 7777 indicating a bottling date of Jan 2, 2007. The smell has a bit of sourness to it and when you get into the taste its slightly roasty but has a sour cherry syrup presence there the entire time. I actually like that quite a bit. I didn't find it overpowering but a nice compliment."
"D = This is an enjoyable beer but I cannot imagine drinking too many of them too often. Very tart and a little strong on the tongue. Definitely worth a try if you haven't had it though. To get the full flavor of the stout ()as opposed to just tart cherry) should not drink too cold."
"Not bad. I don't think this is something I'd drink with any regularity. It's a good beer, though, and if you are looking for a fruit flavored stout I would imagine this is one of the better ones you'd find."
"Poured a opaque black with a thin mocha colored head that left a thin ring with heavy lacing. Smelled of roasted coffee and a hint of chocolate but was overpowered by the tart cherry. Tasted mostly of tart sour cherries with a slight roasted taste that really comes out in the finish and aftertaste. Hard to describe this as a stout. The mouthfeel doesn't feel like a stout but it is still creamy and smooth. The drinkability is a little low because of the tartness of the cherries. Still a good offering from Bell's as expected."
"D,notes: I wouldn't call this drinkable - too tart for sessionability. That being said an interesting and unique take on a stout."
"drinkability - At first I was like ahhh this is good, then half way I was like...am I done yet? The cherry taste was too much for me."
"Pour is black with small tan head. Smell is soy sauce and tart unsweetened cherry juice. I was making chinese food for dinner so I brought out the Kikkoman to do a side by side smelling, and it was verified. Taste is unsweetened sour cherry mostly. Not getting a lot of roastiness, except for in a slight soy sauce way. Not pleasant, and I really wanted to like this as it was one of the first beers I put on my want list after joining the site. Absolutely could not finish it."
"If a stout is brewed with cherry juice, does that necessarily qualify it more as a fruit beer than a stout? That's crazy. This is simply one kick-ass stout that happens to have some cherry accents. People look at the Style listed and their prejudices take over. Anyone who steers away from fruit beers on principle is going to miss out on a great beer."
"This stout is dark as night with a head that quickly fades. The aroma of subtle fruit and coffee, and a bit of alcohol and smoke come off this black liquid. There is a juicy tart cherry flavor that dominates the profile of chocolate and bitterness. The flavors could be more balanced, as my palate becomes a bit confused and the warm alcohol astringency is more than I care for in this flavor pairing."
"Feel was nice, creamy and frothy. It comes off a little sweet, but is certainly worth trying."
"-Pours a very dark brown with no head. Smell is cherries and some port. Very smooth and delicious. Hardly any oxidation that I could detect. This is a very good reminder on why we age some beers. This is the perfect example."
"I enjoyed this brew and would drink it again. I could enjoy maybe two at one session."
"D- not bad the cherry juice stickyness hurts it again but still solid"
"****1st beer I've ever had to dump out before finishing!"
"M&D: Very heavy mouthfeel from the malts. The carbonation is extremely light, to the point that it only exists as single points exploding on the tongue. Drinkability is very good but this is very heavy so I'm not sure how many I would put down in a sitting. Smooth. Nice."
"Bell's Cherry Stout pours an almost black color with a thin tan head that hints at pink. The aroma is very stout like, coffee seems most obvious but there is a hint of fruit too. There is quite a thick mouthfeel. The flavor has your typical coffee and chocolate like flavors, but there is definitely a tart cherry flavor too. I like it, but I couldn't drink much of it. Worth a try if you like fruit in your beer."
"D - I'm very glad I tried this, unlike many other cherry brews, this tastes real and natural. It really tastes like cherries, and not artificial cherry syrup. A must try I believe. Reco here."
"Oily, thick mouthfeel. Definitely full-bodied. It took me a good 45 minutes or so to actually finish this beer, and I only did because I eventually forced myself to... it was very tempting to dump it out. Awful aftertaste. I'm not against cherry-flavored beers, but I can safely say it doesn't work well in a stout. I definitely wouldn't recommend this one."
"Good, but you definitely have to be in the mood."
"D: Nope."
"Pours a pitch black with 1 finger of creamy tan head. Good retention and soft, full lacing. Smells of roasted malt, cherries, and some slight alcohol in the nose as it warms. Tart cherry taste up front followed by dark chocolate, bitter coffee, and a smoke finish. Medium in body, smooth and creamy, and with a nice blending medley of sour and bitter. A really good stout, especially around Valentines Day if you like chocolate covered cherries."
"In my mind, I was expecting a dessert beer, but this might go better with mild cheeses. The cherry in it is subtle, so you might miss it with a mouth full of sweets."
"Poured into a pint glass pours a motor oil black with a fluffy head that doesn't hang around long and leaves minimal lace on the glass. Smell is awesome with roasted malt and barley dancing in my nostrils simply great smell stuff. Taste is a bit sour from the cherries which is nicely balanced, the sourness is balanced with the roasted malt and barley that is in there, this is a very yummy beer and one I highly suggest, I detect no alcohol in this as well. Simply awesome stuff from a awesome brewery."
"D-An excellent full bodied chocolatey stout with the addition of tartness of sour cherries. Very nicely done."
"Pours a completely pitch black with copious amounts of dirty brown head. Aroma is really nice, a blend of cocoa nibs, roasted coffee, tart cherries, and burnt toast. On the palate, the incredibly rich, toasted malts, almost to the point of being burnt, blend well with the tartness and slight sweetness of the cherries. This is a really rich stout, and one that the berries make up only half, or even less of the flavor complexity. It reminds me of a 80% cacao chocolate bar and a cherry pie all thrown in a blender. It finishes with this smooth creaminess. Such a delicious stout, I'm surprised it is not one of Bell's highest ranked beers."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a nice creamy tan head that possesses great retention and lacing qualities. The aroma is dark roasted malts, coffee and the cherries in the aroma intensify as the beer warms up. The taste is your typical dark and rich Bell's stout with a sourness caused by the cherries. At times, the sourness can be overpowering. Overall, this is a pretty decent stout that is definitely worth a try, but the added cherry flavors are not for everyone."
"Better than Kalamazoo and Java in my opinion but not their cream stout, worth a try, this was the first fruity stout I can remember tasting, recommended if you have access to it, pleasant surprise being that this was the one I thought I would like the least out of the Bell's stouts I tasted with my buddy Phil tonight"
"D_I have to say this is wonderfully constructed. I have had a few other cherry stouts that didn't do it for me but this is a home run."
"Taste starts out with cherries, then stout, finishing tart with cherries. As she warmed, the taste became more palatable."
"The flavor is intersting, borders on good. Dark chocolate & a roasted malt backbone combine with a sweet, tarty, aspirin-esque dark cherry note. Mouthfeel detects a medium body that's low in carbonation with a bittersweet finish of chocolate and coffee. This isn't something I'd ever flat out buy (luckily, I got my bottle as a gift), but it was an interesting try, and definately not terrible by any stretch of the imagination."
"A novel stout. pretty good, but I would only buy it periodically if I had it available... Nothing is really wrong, but the cherry on this one really doesn't fit."
"12 oz bottle. Pours black with nearly no head, whats there is tan. Aroma of coffee, cherries and alcohol. Initial flavor is sweet cherries, followed by tartness that continues long after the beer is off the palate. Cherry throughout, no other flavors really show up. Light to medium body, no carbonation, no lacing. Not very drinkable and wouldn't get it again. Luckily there are more Bells selections in my fridge tonight."
"Pours pitch black and thick as can be. Very minimal tan head. Even without it, it still looks good. Nose is slightly syrup like with a roasted edge to it. Flavor is thick with a firm roasted edge to it. Minor cherry tones really. Seems to kick hardest on the back side, and does so rather quickly and then leaves. Feel is smooth with a nice carbonation. This is a pretty good stout. Nothing that will blow the mind, but still pretty nice all the same."
"Definitely this isn't a beer that I need to stock up on. A different beer but I think I need not try it again."
"I consider myself a fan of tart beers, even sour when it comes to lambics, but this is the first time Ive had that taste in a stout, and I didnt enjoy it. It doesnt mean its not a complex beer, because it is, just means that it may not be for everybody. Ill definitely try some of Bells other offerings as I have heard good things."
"I love this beer and will pick up more of it the future"
"So should you try it? Yeah, I mean, it's a 8.5% cherry stout. One bottle won't kill you and will be good for amusement when you tire of your normal fare. But I won't seek it out again."
"Overall- To syrupy to sweet. I could barely finish the pint."
"A very nice beer that I will have again. The tartness can be a bit much at times though."
"I didn't expect the surge of tart when I first tasted this drink but it didn't detour me from finishing the glass, though it made it a little tough at times. I look forward to finishing the 6 pack!"
"D - Not impressed."
"This is currently on tap at Tyler's Taproom in Durham, along with three other stouts from Bell's. They're certainly making an impact in this area; six of Tyler's taps are now from Bell's. It was served in a very fetching Bell's tulip glass. Near-black in color, this brew featured a dark-tan head with good retention. Smells of dark-roasted malts and sour cherry dominate the aroma. The flavor is really heavy on tart cherry, while most of the malts and hops lurk in the background. It's difficult to get a read on the stout characteristics here, as so much of the flavor is consumed in cherry notes. It's interesting, that's for sure. Some espresso notes peek through, which somehow clash with the cherry flavor. I'm not sure if I like this or not. It's certainly drinkable, but it may be just a little too tart for my taste. Having said that, it's more interesting than many fruit/vegetable beers I've tried, especially in the full-bodied texture and high alcohol. Therefore, it receives higher marks than others in that style."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours an opaque, deep dark almost black brown color. There was just a hint of a beige head on it. The aroma is good, but not overpowering. Chocolate and cherries up front, with some roastiness and coffee backing it up. The taste is very similar to the aroma. Just a touch of sweetness. Nicely balance by the hops. A nice stout."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable experience but one is enough in a setting. I will grab one of these again next fall but probably not until then. (3.5)"
"For a brief moment, the flavor, with that initial jab of stately earthiness, made me think I had a winner, but then that tart cherry pucker made me rethink my stance, but quick. Cherry is fine, but this is like coffee cherry soda, and that doesn't work for me. It's not irredeemable, but the confusion pairs with a ballsy ABV to make it a last resort choice, when the only remaining options are watery macros. I wanted to like it. But then, I want to like spinach too, and that's not happening either."
"Overall this was a nice beer to try, but it would not frequent my fridge due to its sweetness."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, slightly filling, nice kick. This beer didnt exactly get a ringing endorsement form a fellow BA that I talked to before I traded for it but, I wasnt as bad as he made it out to be. However, this really isnt a beer that I would want to drink more than one of."
"Sour cherry is a much stronger player in the taste, which can be quite overpowering, especially intially. The texture is luxuriously thick and silky, which also results in a satisfying, melty, lactose covered aftertaste. There's a lot a flavor here, which is a plus, but I get the idea this one could stand some altering or ageing or something to reach its full potential."
"Overall I cannot believe I had not tried this one sooner. This was a really great stout and something I would like to get more of. Perfect for after dinner or a cold night it just had a great deal of presence to it. I would have to recommend this to any fan of both fruit and dark beers; this is the best of both worlds here."
"This one is a good concept that just doesn't come through. The cherries seem to come out the wrong way. Not recommended."
"Bell's is the king of stouts, IMO, but this one needs some tweaking."
"This beer pours like motor oil, <goose bumps>. Dark frothy head that diminishes to a fine layer. Smell is sweet and roasted. The taste is... not what I expected. Initial taste shocks the taste buds and confuses them too.Very sweet with some sourness wrapped in a dark roasted base. Gets the salivation glands going. Very unique beer but not in a bad way, be open-minded and you will enjoy this one."
"Thanks to kryptic for the trade."
"Drinkability - Really didn't know what to make out of a cherry stout but I'm glad I have the rest of the six-pack waiting for me. I'll be curious to sample these after a few months, perhaps a year to see how the profile changes with age. This is a good find and worth a sample."
"Like I said, this beer is really unique and is open to criticism or praise. It doesn't fit any protypes for beer than I can thick of."
"D- Overall I give Bell's props for this unique beer. It it just too tart and overbearing. It is unique and worth a try, who knows, maybe you'll love it."
"Another damn fine stout from Bell's. I have yet to drink one of their stouts that hasn't impressed me. This one is very unique and the tartness works perfectly with the standard stout flavors. Wish I would have picked up more than a sixer."
"Creamy and thick, but still relatively low gravity. Smooth and juicy. Very little warmth for a decently high ABV. This seems to be a 'love it' or 'hate it' type of selection. I, for one, think it's very good."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very smooth on the palate, like velvet. The body is full, and carbonation is relatively low, appropriate for this brew, and it goes down very well. This is definitely a dessert beer. Be prepared to be sipping on it for a while. This is one I'll definitely buy again."
"Drinkability: An interesting style to be sure, but not for me. I thought that the combination of the Cherries and Coffee flavors was unique, but I think that the high carbonation and tartness of this beer limit its drinkability."
"as for drinkability, one was enough. it was too tart to be smooth, and in my opinion there was not enough roasted malt to counterbalance the tart cherry flavor."
"I'd weakly recommend this beer. Bells has a sterling reputation in the craft beer scene, but I'm guessing it is not because of this beer."
"Pours a dark brown color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy tannish head, no sticky lacing follows. The nose is big on malt/caramel, slight cherry hint, some roastyness going on as well. The taste is big on caramel/malts, nice tangy/bitterness of the cherries, and some roastyness. Medium body. Very drinkable, I really like this one very tasty indeed."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer, but not one that I would want to line up several of. If it maintained its chocolatey flavors it would gain points here, but the overwhelming tartness becomes too much."
"Pours a very opaque black with a deep tan head that diminished to a ring. Aroma was roasted barley, dark bitter chocolate and burnt espresso. The taste is a wonderful cherry sweetness overpowering the roasted barley and other usual stout flavors that still linger in the background and finish. The beer is on the low side medium bodied and the cherry sweetness does a wonderful job of masking the alcohol content. This is a wonderful unique variation on one of my favorite styles."
"Pours black with a red tinged beige head that fades to a ring. Nose is slightly chocolatey and has a tinge of cherry on the end. A slight roastiness underlies it all. The taste is a somewhat strange amalgamation of roastiness and sour cherry. One minute I love it and the next it clashes terribly. It isn't exactly integrated, and the flavor yo-yos a bit. There is also a dutched chocolate flavor throughout as well as a creaminess that wars a bit with the cherry sourness. Interesting, but not Bell's best. Something about this does draw me back though."
"Overall, I'm glad I tried this, but I don't think I would seek it out in the future."
"Pours a deep oily black with a tan brown head. I like to smell the aroma as I pour into the glass, and this smelled fantastic - fresh roasted coffee and cocoa. Game over. The cherry flavor dominated any stout flavor and lent an unpleasant sourness to the beer that came close to mimicking an infection. The mouth feel was very hard to discern with the sour cherry gripping my tongue, and the finish was a sad affair as once again the cherry flavor/ sourness just pushed it all around. I would not drink this again, and I believe I will not finish this bottle. Great aroma though."
"T:"
"dark with a little dark tan head that has poor retention and leaves little lace. smells pretty good. like cherries, roasted malt and a hint of chocolate. i also pick up a little hop character as it warms. taste loses just a little for not having a real fresh picked chunky cherry taste. Nonetheless, it tastes nice, like cherries and roasted malt with a faint faint faint hop taste. Full bodied, but not incredibly full bodied. I gave it a 4 for drinkability because i remember having one for breakfast once and loving it. In the past two days, I've had bell's java, double cream and expedition stouts. all of them are phenominal. this one is good too, but it's hard to give it high marks while the memory of the others are fresh in my mind. good beer. i imagine this might be the stout for people who love cherries as much as i love coffee and chocolate... and hops."
"D: I really like this beer, but would probably not want to have more than 2 in a session. After that I think the cherry flavor would get to be a bit much. Until that point though it's quite tasty."
"This cherry stout was just what it said it was...but not something I really loved. More and more I'm realizing that fruity beers just aren't my thing."
"This is a very nice fruit beer. It's no where near sweet and cloying like many commercial fruit beers I've had in the past. The cherry flavor is very tart and tasty."
"Pours a very opaque, deep black, no light penetrates, thick brown head forms, settles down to a thin layer/ring, lace spots, not bad. Smell is sweet cherries, caramel, chocolatey roast, tobacco/smoke, touch of alcohol, pretty neat although the cherry is a bit sweet. Taste is very sweet, smokey malt, toffee, chocolate, cherry, roast, tobacco, good play between the flavours, very sticky, doesn't taste 8.5%. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, sticky mouthfeel, easy to drink, not bad! Thanks Alexa!"
"D- This beer has a nice big cherry smell but it is a bit lighter in cherry flavor. The malt notes are a bit on the sweet side but that blends well with the tart cherries. I didn’t taste the black malt and black grain notes typical of stouts, instead there were more chocolate notes."
"Drinkability: If you like this sort of thing.... it's great.... very pronounced fruit taste... which I like. The only detraction is the carbonation level (on the high side).... Just swirl the glass more....and problem corrected!"
"Pours a stout color, dark brown black color with a slight creamy tan head that fades away on top of this one. Aroma is laced with the cherry scent, as well as some cocoa and a hint of a malt from a stout. The taste is bitter cherries followed by a creamy cocoa and dark malt flavors. Nothing like a heavy stout but a little subtle creaminess followed by the cherries, definitely a surprise for a ""Fruit beer"". The mouth feeling is reminiscent of a stout, and certainly not a fruit beer. A surprise for my drink the other night."
"D - ABV is totally hidden. A nice mix of tart cherries and roasty stout. A well done offering."
"Pretty drinkable, especially for cherry lovers. It's surprisingly just a little drying, which helps. The sour cherry taste might turn some people off, though."
"Pours a black color with no lacing and a light brown/amber head. Nose is straightforward, although mild: cherries. Flavor's a little more interesting, although not too. Lots of cherries, along with a good hint of chocolate. Some light roasted malt, mocha flavor as well. Fairly strong sourness as well, although that could just come from the fruit. Overall, as with most good fruit beers, this one serves as a tasty diversion, but not one I'd be drinking too many of."
"Drinkability: Persistently mediocre. Not bad, but not good either."
"If you want a great stout that is reminiscent of its class grab a Kalamazoo or an Expedition. If you want to go outside the boundaries and walk on the WILD SIDE, reach for the Cherry Stout. It's Unique, It's Different, Its another great brew by Bell's."
"It poured coca-cola black into a tulip glass with absoloutely no head. The aroma was that of coffee and cherries. The mouthfeel was crisp and full-bodied with a medium level of carbonation. The taste started off good with chocolate and cherries but by the end, it was so tart on the back of the tongue, it was all I could do to finish."
"Drinkability: Beer is very drinkable. Not for everyday consumption."
"Pours an opaque black with a dark tan one finger head that dies down to a thin lacing a while after pour and remains throughout. Stickiness is very spotty. Smell wasn't very ""Cherry""-like. Big roasted malt on the nose. Maybe a tiny hint of cherries, but much much weaker than I had anticipated. Taste was pretty weak too. Starts with a mild hop tingle followed by a huge toasted nutty malt flavor with hints of espresso. Maybe a tiny bit of cherry tartness in the aftertaste, but hardly. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a bit too much carbonation for the style, leaves the tongue tingling well after tasting. Pretty disappointed in this one from Bell's, I expected more in the Cherry department from this beer. Bell's makes some amazing Stouts, but this definitely isn't one of them."
"At Beer Bistro's US fest. Pours a dark colour with a little pink lacing on glass. Appropriate and full-mouthed carbonation. More cherry cola than anything else, on the sweet side. Chocolate secondary. A novelty stout.I am sure that they have improved the recipe over time."
"For a stout, I would have preferred a bit more body. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this, a style I rarely see."
"Drinkability: decent, a little to fruity for my tastes"
"D: This beer is a stout, dammit! The big abv belies that, I'd drink another bottle from another batch just to see if the stout element comes through a little stronger."
"Peculiar, different, at times very good, but there is something a little off here that I cannot exactly pinpoint. Still worthwhile."
"Pretty nice offering from Bell's but not their best stout."
"D - A great fruit accented stout, would go well with either chocolate or cherry desserts. With all the coffee-like roastiness would make a decent choice for a breakfast beer. I would definitely try it again."
"Overall, an interesting combination and a good use of real cherry flavor, but I won't be buying it again."
"This beer poured a deep dark brown with red highlights under 1/2"" frothy tan head. The smell had hints of cherry, roasted malt, and espresso. The taste has a little chocolate then the sour cherry takes over with a hint of roasted malt. The sourness is a bit too much, almost like a sour ale, I wasn't expecting it in this beer. I would like a bit more of the malt. It has a medium light body with a fairly dry finish."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a 1/2"" brownish/red color head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a rich, chocolate malt scent along with a tart cherry aroma. It's almost coffee smelling with a cherry liquor added. The taste is average. It has a very bold cherry flavor that sticks out beyond the chocolate malts. It seems a little over the top, but I like the effort. The malts mix well with the cherries, but there needs to be a bit more malt. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking stout despite it's flaws. I homebrew a recipe much like this one."
"Beautiful red body with a gorgeous red head.Cherry nose with a carmel smell also.I dont know about the taste,it has a cherry taste first then a dark roasted taste there after.The mouthful is slick and turns sweet after it warms.I dont really like this much,its interesting but nothing I could drink often.I do like fruity beers but this dont appeal to me much."
"Served in a Bell's tulip, chiled but not cold. Cocoa-brown in color and totally opaque when held up to direct sunlight. Topped by a one-fingered medium tan head (with hints of auburn/rust) and with good lacing evident; lacing and head stuck around quite a while. The nose is truly extraordinary, offering something for everyone. There's the expressive malt character (from the bready/yeasty to the toasty and roasted) with slight espresso notes, as well as the fruit aspect (a semi-lactic sour cherry tang) to consider here, and if anything the hops are subdued on the nose. Either way, the nose alone is worth the experience of ordering this one from the tap line up. There's a bright cherry tang on the first sip, but it is quickly subsumed by the interplay of rich malt. Complex . . . the herbaceous cherry notes return at the finish and spar with the toasty malt. The cherry really lingers here, in the way that hop bitterness typically lingers, and is very expressive in the aromatic element as well. In the past I've found this beer to 'open up' and become more flavorful after a year or more in the bottle, but not so here, this is drinking like a two year old (and well-kept) bottle! As it warms the creamy mouthfeel and medium-full body help to underscore the notes of bitter chocalate and espresso, which play out midway through the palate. Biscuity malt notes combine with light cocoa (bitter chocolate) notes, and give the body a pleasantly grainy texture, especialy as it warms. Carbonation is moderate throughout - this never feels downright 'heavy', even though it is a fairly big beer. For that matter the alcohol is never intrusive, and is gently warming. It should be noted that the ever-present cherry is of the fruity-dry quality rather than the fruity-sweet; this ain't no girly fruit beer! There's a light sweetness to the malt and a very agreeable bitterness, too. This is a marvelous rendition of a flavored stout, and with great balance being a big plus in the crafting of such a substantial brew. Outstanding."
"D- alcohol is almost totally masked, which is a plus because of the content. cherries not overly tart but a little strong, making the beer a little too sweet for more than a couple in one sitting. good buy tho."
"Even without much of a balance between the stout flavors & the sour cherry taste, I still really dug this. It would maybe work better with less of a sour taste but I still found it to be highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: The extreme complexity of this beer unfortunately hinders the drinkability. One at a time is probably all that most could handle."
"I do have to limit the drinkability because it is a bit sweet to drink a bunch of them."
"This one just didn't strike the right balance of flavors for me. Individually, it sounded like a good idea, but putting them together just didn't work for me."
" There is a battle between the tartness of the cherry juice and the sweetness of the malts. This is like a chocolate covered cherry, with half of the chocolate being sweet, the other half is dark and bitter. Mouthfeel is thick, the bubbles are small. I will probably buy this again, but one is enough for now."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, it pours a dark brown with dark ruby notes througout the body. The head is fizzy, lite, and a tannish color w/ also ruby tones. Fizzles out to a slight edge layer on the sides. Lots of sour cherries on the nose along with a big robust dark-roast coffee & chocolate aroma. I also get a bit of almond in there as well. Very roasty, fruity, and lots of chocolate basically; yummy! Tart cherries highlight the sip mostly, but a dash of alcohol kills off some of that leaving a nice shot of roasty chocolate flavors. The carbonation is mediocre, while it fizzes out, the alcohol comes to visit, and it helps dry out the finish. Overall, a delicious brew in my opninion that a few of my friends and I enjoyed together during the Super Bowl. A great buy!"
"Drinkability: I would like this beer from time to time, but to me a little bit too sour cherry taste but still another quality beer from Bell's"
"Looks like a dark stout with slight red tones on the edges. Smells of cherry tartness and roasted malt. The flavor is a wallop and the cherries are right up front offering tartness with the cherry flavor with out being cough syrup by avoiding the sweetness. The roasted stout comes through in the finish and provides and nice ending to the beer that might be overpowering without it. The mouthfeel is good but this is something to be enjoyed singlely."
"D - Too bad about this one...I bought it for my wife, and she did say that it is helping her adjust to stouts...which is a good thing, so I guess it served its purpose. I don't believe I'll be purchasing another of these - it's not bad, but if I want a fruit beer, I'll go for a lighter wheat selection."
"12 oz. bottle, brewed with cherry juice - batch 7674 (packaged October 12, 2006). It pours an almost impenetrable black that reflects like an obsidian mirror, and is topped with a thin, orange/brown head that reduces to a collar and leaves light lacing. It has a luscious, almost intoxicating aroma that consists of tart cherries, roasted malts, and green/piney hops. Not too complex, yet divine. The flavor is mouth-puckeringly tart with big sour cherry overtones that mask the other flavors, which consist of coffee/roasted malts, chocolate?, raspberry, and a mild bitterness. A downside is that the tartness of the cherries makes it hard to savor the flavors and forces an almost immediate swallow. The body is medium with medium carbonation and finish, and is fairly dry due to the cherries. It is reminiscent of the ""chocolate truffle"" (Legend Imperial Stout + Lindeman's Framboise) I tried at a beer bar in Ghent, but overall it is too tart for a stout. The amount of cherries is sufficient for the aroma, but it's an overload on the palate. Perhaps a better addition would be some kind of sweeter fruit like blackberry or strawberry. However, glad to try this unique offering, especially because of its wonderful bouquet."
"Drinkability: Since I just purchased one bottle, I'm happy with it. One thing is, as with most good big stouts I suppose, the alcohol isn't very present at all, and with the 8.5% I'm surprised. Probably wouldn't want to drink more than one in a sitting, but I really liked this, especially for the fruit and stout combo, which I imagine doesn't sit well with a lot of folks trying concoctions from many breweries--this formerly skeptical guy included."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is thick and dark with a slight red hue and a huge bubbly brownish-red head. Smell is primarily of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and only very slightly of cherries. Taste is initially reminiscent of cherry juice, followed by a toasted malty finish. Alcohol is well covered. Mouthfeel is viscous yet light in body with little carbonation. This is a good sampling beer but I don't think I could drink a whole six pack in one sitting."
"Pours a fairly viscous, oily black with a creamy brown head. Sweet aroma with a touch of fruitiness. There are some heavy roasty notes and strong bitter burnt coffee flavors in the palate, along with a surprisingly refreshing tart cherry flavor, but all of that is somewhat masked by an intense sweetness. In fact, I would really have to say this brew reminds me of many of the sweet/milk/cream stouts that Ive tried; its got that same slightly sour sweetness to it. Not bad, the tart cherry and sweet and sour flavors make this moderately thick stout pleasantly drinkable. Recommended."
"Not a bad offering. Very different. Nothing spectacular but not an A lister."
"Poured from the bottle into a Belgian beer snifter. It's a deep dark black color. Very nice and rich-looking, with a thin burnt-orange head which dissipated faster than expected. Little to no lace left on the glass. The aroma is nice and pleasant. Very mild, but that's not a bad thing. A nice malty fragrance with notes of cherry floating up and catching my scent in the back of the nose. Quite enjoyable, and unlike any other stout (or beer) that I've had before. The flavor is, as predicted, dotted with cherries along the way. A nice, smooth, malted stout with a quality fruit impression seems to me like it would be hard to pull off, but Bell's does so with ease here. The mouthfeel is solid and I'd call this a most drinkable beer. I'm pretty sure that I'm not always in the mood for cherry stouts, but this is definitely where I'm going when I am. A most pleasant way to start off my New Year's eve celebration, I'd say. Well done."
"In appearance, pretty much like any stout. Came to the table with a thick head that looked almost nitro. A strong boquet of roasted malt and cherries. Flavor is wonderful - sort of a Dr. Frankenstein-like admixture of a strong stout with New Glarus' Belgian red. The tart cherries act as a perfect balance to sweet malt. The mouthfeel is thicker than a typical draft stout, thinner than an imperial stout. Drinkability was surprisingly good. I see it as a dessert beer, but it is not too sweet to drink with strongly flavored food."
"Into a Guiness glass, pours pitch black, nice half inch tan head that recedes kind of quick, ok splotchy lacing, and if I'm not deceiving myself, just the slightest red with tan around the ring of head thats left. Aroma is full of cherry of course, but done pretty well, thanks in large part to the roasty dark malts with some coffee and sweetness. As for the taste, if fails as all other cherry whatevers have failed... i just can't get past the cherry taste, no matter how authentic. But for the style, it pulls it off pretty well. Its pretty sweet, and not jsut due to the cherry, but there is good bittering and in all its a well rounded beer, quite polished. Mouth is also pretty damn good, medium mouth and good carbonation, pretty smooth. In all, I won't drink another cause I just don't like cherry-themed beers, but its a good one either way."
"Drinkability is ok, the sourness is a little too much and coupled with the high ABV, its tough to want more than one. A decent and unique sipper, but nowhere near my favorite Bell's beer."
"Drinkability: The acidity of the cherries seems to accumulate, which really limits one's enjoyment of the beer."
"Beer was a pretty dark color with a reddish hue, thin brown head. Smell was faint of cherry and vanilla, actally smelled oretty good. Whew, taste was just too strange for me. A kinda sour cherry taste with the stout taste getting way lost in the mix. i had to pour it out after drinking about half. Will not purchase again."
"I really like a lot of the other Bell's beers and I will likely try this again just to make sure this wasn't a fluke of some sort."
"I am a big Bell's fan (love Two-Hearted), but the Cherry Stout is not what I was expecting or hoping for."
"Pours that thick black with streaks of brown. All opaque, no light allowed to pass. Medium tan head seems to crawl up the sides of my glass. Leaving a little lacing here and there. The aroma is a very subdued roast with a tartness not characteristic of most stouts I've had. Must be the cherries. Hints of licorice from the puckery smelling cherries. The taste is a little tart for taste. Doesn't mix well with the light roast. I was hoping for a better balance between the malts, hops, and cherries. Instead all three clash to leave an odd cloying. Almost like vinegar in acidity. Viney even."
"Bottle courtesy of Tpaliga: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium foamy head with low retention and no lacing. Aroma of roasted malt and coffee is quite dominant and interesting with some cherry notes also noticeable. Taste is a weird mix between roasted malt and cherry, which I dont seem to agree with. I really dont like the mix between the sweet cherries and roasted malt. Body is lighter then expected but still about average for the style."
"D - I like it, but I couldn't drink a lot of it."
"Drinkability: All in all, a good beer. However, it certainly does not taste like a full bodied stout with cherry flavors, but rather a cherry fruit beer that is on the dark side. I could see the tartness of the cherries getting old after awhile."
"Not bad for a fruit brew, not my favorite style but well made."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. This was my second fruit stout and I liked it better than the first one I had (Weyerbacher's Raspberry Imperial, although it's been a while since I last had it). Good use of the cherry juice in this one, it complements the stout characteristics well. Recommended."
"A medium mouthfeel,very fizzy,a bit thin for a stout. I was excited to try this beer,now i'm dissapointed. Always liked Bell's beer,this is not one of my favorites."
"D: Time will tell if this beer gets on my nerves after the bottle is gone, but I don't think it will. An enjoyable beer."
"Not my favorite to drink but is unique I guess with the fruit added. Maybe try again after some time."
"The drinkability is not so good, There are other brews that I would rather drink. MK"
"The pour into my La Moneuse glass raises a one finger dark tan head that quickly falls, but leaves some thick and somewhat sticky lacing. The body is a truly opaque black. The nose has a distinct sweet and sour cherry note, backed by a solid coffee roast scent. The taste is very roasted, with strong coffee flavors. There also seems to be a oak character, along with a funkiness I normally associate with lambics. This must be the tenth bottle I've had from my case, and for some reason it's finally hitting me as a truly great beer, with surprising complexity. The mouth is pretty heavy, enough to slow me down, but I like it. Carbonation is minimal. I could (and have) drink a lot of these..."
"Another winner from Bell's. It is a refreshing change of pace to drink a ""fruit"" beer, where the fruit plays harmony, instead of taking center stage. Very enjoyable, and highly recommended. I feel that this could be one of my new ""hot weather stouts"". I can't even describe how happy I am that Bell's is back in VA."
"The overall feel is like drinking a cherry picking warehouse's mop water. Bonus points though for the cool novelty and nice balance of bitter, sweet and sour."
"A bit strong and bold, but this one from Bell's delivers as advertised. Not the greatest mouthfeel, and drinkability is only slightly above average. That said, I'd readily try this one again if it was available."
"This beer pours jet black with a thin brown/red head that doesn't measure up to much and diminishes quickly to a tiny ring. The aroma is subtle with hints of roasty notes of burnt coffee and chocolate. The flavor comes on with a nice punch of tart cherry that finished dry with the punch of burnt espresso. Perhaps just a bit more ""burnt"" in flavor than I would have liked. Notes of cola and spice come through in the middle. A slow sip reveals that this is more complex than I had initially thought. The cherry flavor is intense and tart and more importantly, natural. Thank goodness it doesn't ring of an extract flavor. Mouthfeel is nice... I think the cherry seems to diminish perception of the heft of the beer. This beer is surprisingly quite drinkable, though the heavy heavy burnt notes might keep me from hitting this too hard. Definitely an interesting beer with a little room for improvement."
"D: Overall, a very interesting beer - can't say I've had a cherry stout before, and I think the combination works. While the tartness is just a little beyond easy sipping for me, I still consider this another strong offering from Bell's."
"D - A very easy drinking stout. I dont even know if I would classifly it as a stout, maybe a fusion beer."
"Aquired this beer from a trade (thanks BigErn). Served slightly below room temperature. Poured vigorously into a pint glass , where about one finger of tanish , white , frothy head formed and left some thick lace on the glass. Poured a deep brown that appeared black in the glass. Smelled faintly of chocolate , some cherries, and small amounts of coffee. Not too much going on in the nose. Tasted of cherries (seemed more present here than in the smell), sweet tart candy, and some somewhat hidden java notes ,with little carbonation and a very dry finish. The 8 percent alcohol content was completly hidden by the tart cherries .A little thin in the mouth, and a bit too sweet and tart in my opinion."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin, coffee colored head. The aroma is of chocolate, roasted malts, and toast along with the cherries. Also noticing a bit of a leather aroma? The taste is just like chocolate covered cherries with a little tobacco flavor added in. Full mouthfeel with low carbonation. This is a pretty nice fruit stout."
"There are two distinct forces working here: sour and smoke. Miraculously they each perform their solo duties on the ends-- smoke first, sour sour cherry last-- and in the middle they converge for what can only be described as an orgasm of tart interspecies lust. I'm not sure if the cherry tang is so sour on its own or if it's because it follows the chocofee smoke and thus only seems twice its veracious nature. But it is SOUR. Overbearing sour and yet I really like it a lot. Mostly because it tastes like nothing else but also because it is a change-up from the normal stout goodness with a BIG surprise burped in."
"D: Approachable & digestible, but the strong flavour (and alcohol) inhibits the sessionability."
"Batch 7220. Pours quite black with no highlights at all. There seemed to be quite a bit of carbonation in this. Thick tan foamy head disappears very quickly. Roasty aroma, maybe a bit of chocolate, combines with sour cherries. The flavor seems just like the nose would lead to believe. A bit of roasty malt, maybe just a hint of chocolate, and sour cherries. At first, the sourness was too much, however as I went on, I began to like the combination. This is unlike anything I have had before. A bit thin, however very interesting. I think this is worth a try, as it is quite a unique beer."
"This was not a bad beer, just not as interesting as I had hoped. My expectations were shot down in every aspect of this beer, and that's too bad."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't drink too many of these. It was one of the first fruity stouts I have tried. Nice on a cold summer night but nothing I would drink to quench my thirst in the hot summer sun."
"Mouthfeel was thick, full, and creamy. Drinkability lost a bit from the overt tartness of the brew, however, worth a few."
"After watching the documentary American Beer, I've been wanting to check out what Bell's has to offer. This baby does not disappoint! Pours so black, it doesn't appear to even thin out around the edges. This beer even smells heavy and coats your mouth with a sweetness off malt and cherry. Roasted flavor at the end finishes the simple elegance that is this beer. You can get a touch of the alcohol too, just to remind you that what you are drinking is actuall ya beer. For some reason, it seems like this isn't even really a stout, but something else entirely. I have a feeling I am going to like some of the other stout's I picked up from Bell's and from what I've had so far, I recommend you check some out too!"
"Drinkability: It was a good beer offering from Bell's, but it wasn't that good, unless you really like chocolate covered cherries. If you do, than this is your beer!"
"Dnot bad, not as much sour cherry as I thought there would be, Id have it again, but its a sipper for sure"
"pours out a completely impenetrable black with crimson hues. thin tight tan head appears with a hard pour....sticks a bit and leaves some lace. chocolate covered cherry aroma. pretty nice. tart cherry flavour is melded together with a pretty subdued stoutness that lets the cherry flavour shine. tart, sweet, and sour from either the cherry juice or the yeast...it's a nice match nonetheless. there is an alcohol note in the background...it's very masked for a high ABV brew. mouthfeel is extremely smooth and juicy. the body seems a bit on the light side for a stout of this stature although it seems a bit filling in the belly. drinkability is surprisingly refreshing....again, i was expecting a sweet stout of greater magnitude than this but am pleasantly surprised by the overall refreshing and tasty notes this provided after a hot day in the sun. it's still a stout to be reckoned with...and i think i'm going to lay down a few bottles to see how it does in six months."
"It is hard to know if some lactose has been added as it closely resembles the tartness of cherries. May be a lambic like nature from wild yeast introduced from the cherries. Easy to hold in the mouth with good balance and dextrinous mouthfeel. A classic must try. I can't believe I am just getting around to this one the new crop of cherries will be ready in about a month."
"Pours dark black with a khaki brown head. Some roasted malt and coffee aroma mix with a tart cherry aroma and also a rich sugary sweet smell. The sweetness does not present itself in the taste, rather a tart sour cherry and milk taste dominates. Also a hint of the roastiness in the taste Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a puckery acidicness from the tartness wiht a dry finish."
"Flavor was a wallop of dark cocoa and sout cherries. Very nice and different I thought. Hints of caramel around the edges too. Really sweet but the sorness gave this beer a nice balance. Heavy bastard that really clung to the tongue. Very drinkable but more of a dessert beer like a port wine."
"Not a classic, but not a bad Bell's Stout."
"I am a sucker for jet black beers that have a bit of deep ruby around the edges. The head was suprising absent from this beer, but it didn't take away from it. The smell was a good description of what was to come, sweet maltiness offset by tart cherry. The taste was very much so like eating a chocolate covered cherry, sweet chocolate malt, some coffee and other dark malts, along with a tart but fresh cherry flavor. The lack of carbonation and the tart character took a bit away from the mouthfeel. This is definitely not a session beer, but one or two go down well. To get the maximum enjoyment out of this beer it would have to be cosumed with a dessert, but don't be fooled, it is an awsome brew."
"The Bell's Cherry Stout pours dark brown, with some red tones as well. Not much of a head with this beer either. It smells like cherries, with a bit of roasted coffee, chocolate and malt. The smell is pretty mild, I expected it to be stronger. Luckily the flavor is stronger, but it's mainly bitter cherries that I can taste at first. There's a sweet cherry and coffee aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pretty thin, slick and watery. I guess it's an 8% ABV beer, but you really can't tell from the taste. For the most part it's easy to drink. I wasn't too impressed after my first couple drinks, but as the beer got warmer it got better, with more of the taste coming through. Not a great beer, but it's still a good one. I'd drink it again."
"Cheers!"
"As I found with Bell's Cherry Ale, it seems that the Cherry is a dangerous fruit to use in a beer. It is entirely capable of overpowering all other tastes with its sweet, mouth puckering tartness. Beware brewers of this dangerous fruit!"
"The body is a medium flavor and a lighter carbonation which is acceptable. Overall the tart is such a strong presence that is masks some of the stout flavor. Though unique I would agree that it is more of a fruity beer then stout."
"A unique offering from Bell's. Pours out like any other Stout; dark, thick, black, lower carbonation. No lace. Aromas are medium bodied, and fill the nose with cherries, roasted malt, and wood elements. Taste was not enjoyable IMO; sour cherry and dark fruit flavors assault the tongue, with roasted malts taking the backseat and hints of herbs and clove in the wings. Mouthfeel is typical for the stout style, perhaps a bit light. Drinkability is not great. Even for someone who dug this beer, I can't see drinking more than one every once in a while. Not for me."
"Cheers."
"Looks like a stout but nothing special. some red color coming through the darkness. little head retention, probably due to the acid in the cherries. good lacing. no cherry odor that i can pick out here...light coffee odor and some burnt qualities too. very tasty beer...initital taste is very malty and coffee like. then you get a sweet chocolate flavor, followed by the cherry making an appearance....tart and lip smacking. i like it. nice and thick, coffee and cherry hang out on your tongue. good drinkability although the cherry might get old."
"This beer might make a good session beer. I would be a little concerned with the 8%ABV. Also, it is a little aggressively flavored. It is a great beer though, and I thank MABZ for semding it."
"Has a nice cherry smell with some yeast noticeable. Pours a deep brown-black body under a soda fizz that results in no head. Sweet, deep cherry continues in the taste, plus chocolate roast that alternates between barely there and chocolate-covered cherry. Despite being bottle-conditioned, its fizzy like a cherry sodabut that fits well with its flavor profile. Further down, sweetness is replaced by a dry red wine component, ending with a flare of wine dregs. Too bad I didnt notice their description or the ABV on the label, else Id have tried to cellar this a while."
"cheers..."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost pitch black, with a large, tan, fizzy, rapidly diminishing head. Very little lacing. The smell is of dark roasted malts and cherries. Chocolate, molasses and cola. That taste is mostly more of the same malts and sweet cherries, that turns tart toward the finish. It has a medium-full body, lightly syrupy texture and moderate-lively carbonation. Im not much of a fan of fruit beers so Im giving this higher marks than I originally had. Compared to the other fruit beers Ive had, this one isnt so bad. Though I wont be coming back for seconds."
"Great fruit beer without tasting like a usual fruity sweetness overload."
"I may not drink this one all evening, but it is one I'd love to end most evenings with...another solid offering from Bells."
"The tart cherries linger on the lips long after the bitter roast subsides, ending this odd adventure of a beer like a fantastic end sequence on a decent film."
"This brew pours an opaque black color with no head to speak of. The aroma is of roasted malt with cherries in the back gorund. The taste has a lot more cherry in it than the aroma suggests. There is a base of roasted malt, but I would like this brew more if the malt showed through more clearly. The mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonation, and an overall smoothness. This brew is pretty good, but Bell's make so many great beers that I would choose before this one."
"Body is just medium, and could use some more beef. Soft carbonation lends to a smooth, creamy texture that finishes with an undesirable chalky dryness. I didn't realize it was 8 % till' I did this review. ABV well concealed."
"An out of place effort for a stout. Could be better with tweaking. Not my cup of tea as is."
"This is obviously not a beer I would want to sit around and drink all night. Hell, I may not even finish this whole 12 oz. Consider this beer fodder for guests."
"Another good beer from Bells. The tartness can be somewhat overpowering but was balanced well the sweetness and roasted coffee flavor. Keep up the good work bells."
"Smells stouty, can't pick up the cherries in the aroma. The cherries come through in the flavor though. Not too strong, just a hint of cherries. Mostly this tastes like a classic stout. A little light in body, but pretty good."
"Drinkability: This is an ok beer. It did not meet the sink but I will not be buying this one any time soon. Maybe if the beer is given time to cellar it will be ready to drink by this summer."
"beer is very drinkable but i most enjoy on a cold night."
"Taste; the tart cherries really stand out on the initial sips. As it warmed up the chocolate malts and coffee flavors start to come out, along with a some hoppy bitterness. It's a little hard to get used to the tartness, especially in a stout, but it deifinitely gets better as it gets warmer. I only noticed the alcohol as a slight warming, not at all in the taste. Mouthfeel was a bit thin and watery for a stout, especially with the low carbonation."
"The only factor that could hurt the drinkability is the abv, which is totally masked and can sneak up on you."
"Very smooth body and texture leaning towards creamy. Dark malts are a definite and coffee tastes are there. Warming with a slight sweetness in the finish. Reminds me of a piece of chocolate cake or chocolate covered cherries. A bit sweet but still a pleasing beer. Maybe better after it has warmed a bit. Not the most drinkable beer but still worth a try."
"Whoever first reviewed this on BA was spot on in categorizing this as a 'fruit beer' rather than a stout. Not bad overall, but in general I'll stick to Bell's other, great beers."
"nothing too complex and something that could probably be mixed at home with two other commercially available products. however, bell's thought to do it in one bottle, and they get points for that. im sure this beer has its enemies, but this runs right up my alley. kudos."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer has a nearly black color topped with a thick layer of dark brown foam. The aroma is chocolate, roasted barley, and cherries. Roasted malt flavor with some tangy tartness. Cherry flavor comes through in the finish, but it's a creamy sour flavor that I don't really enjoy. Mouthfeel is too thin. Not very good drinkability. The stout flavor is pretty good, but I don't like the fruitiness."
"slight score change, previously 3.5, 4, 3.5, 3.5, 4"
"-UF"
"this is certainly worth trying, as is any stout that Bell's unleashes on the market. I dont know what I would do with a 6 pack of these though, glad i just got a single."
"Plops thickly and richly into the glass. Has all of the lacing and legging that you look for in a strong stout. Tart and sour aromas from the fruit flavors. Coffee and chocolatey as well. Tastes devinely sweet and tart. Like a chocolate covered cherry and coffee. The hop bitterness / flavors and the cherry sourness makes a bit much salty and metalic. Get some apple and oak flavors out of this. Full rich body makes me look for a fork and a knife. Creamy texture slides down easily. She's a sipper, but well worth the effort."
"Pour is a thing of beauty...pitch black with ruby highlights and a gorgeous coffee colored head. I love a dark headed beer. Smell, interestingly enough, is of cherry flavored yogurt. A little sour, with some hops and alcohol notes. Taste is quite unique - smoked wood, bittersweet cherry juice, with alcoholic vapors. It's pretty sweet and a little syrupy, but I don't mind, I like a thick beer. Many might think it's a little cloying, but I enjoyed this fruit-themed stout from Bell's, a brewery yet to disappoint me. Have some balls and give this one a try."
"Very dark, black, with faint brownish red highlights. Meager ring of head, chocolatey brown with a slight reddish quality. Strong roasted aroma, chocolatey malt, light alcohol, and cherries, smells almost like black forest cake. But there's also a bit of acrid burnt character that's less pleasant. Slightly acidic all the way through with some fruity sweetness. Malty base with lighter roasted and chocolate than in the aroma. Finishes dry from malt and fruit, with lingering cherry and very mild alcohol. Low carbonation, medium body. Fairly tasty, but more maltiness with less astringency would help balance this one out quite a bit."
"This is a nice beer. Easy drinking and tasty."
"The nose throws major sweet cherry tones that seem to mute the stout tones. Some cream comes through, but chocolate and coffee standards are seemingly quelled. Not completely eclipsed, but kept in check like a battered wife. Actually, if I had blindly sniffed this brew, I may have ventured a guess that the fruit was something other than cherry. The stout scents distort the cherry. Okay, the two aromas produce some weird effects. I feel as though I am contradicting myself here. I say it smells like cherry and that it does not reek of stout and then I say it smells like neither or maybe it does. (Taste) Drink the damn thing and try to understand where I am coming from. This sucker flips the script. I need my meds. So do I. Shut up. No, you shut up! The body is thin for a stout...or so it seems because of the sweet cherry that I think might be in here. But it isn't a stout. Yes it is! There is no cherry. Bull roar! I cannot drink this again, for I will have an episode. No more. Too much. I am sticking to the traditionals. Who needs fruity brew anyhow. The flavour is the same as the smell. Confusing. Interchange them as far as this document is concerned. Cherry stouts are not to be trusted."
"Pours a dark garnet with a reddish hue I reckon is contributed by the cherry. Little head, but what is there persists as a reddish tinged lace of tan bubbles. Aroma of roasted malts competes with the sweet cherry smell. This beer is all about the cherry. It's the first thing you taste and the last thing you taste. The stout flavor is in there, and it's good but it has a hard time peaking out from behind the cherry. The cherry adds a cloyingly sweet aftertaste that actually leaves a puckering ""after-feel"" in my mouth. I heard good things about this particular beer and I have to say I'm a little dissappointed. Back off on the cherry and I think they'd have a winner."
"There is nothing subtle about the cherry flavor in this beer. Not like I was expecting. I was hoping for a better blend of the cherry flavor and the stout characteristics. Somethiing rounder and fuller would have been nice."
"Full bodied, almost like an oatmeal stout, the alcohol warmth is nice at the end. This is definitely not a summer cooler or session beer but could make an excellent desert or after dinner drink."
"Reddish brown head, low retention, medium carbonation. Dark color body, a nice aroma of malt, chocolate, and cherry tingle the senses. Some what harsh translation between the chocolate and the cherry flavors. Semi sweet chocolate gets overwhelmed by the highly sweet cherry. Moderate mouthfeel, lending itself to a drinkable fruity stout."
"Kind of a stout/framboise hybrid. Interesting and tasty. The closest comparison I can think of is Magic Hat's Feast Of Fools or one of those fancy chocolates with the cherry inside. I think my bottle may have been a bit old, I'd like to try this again when I know it's fresh."
"Overall the stout qualities are very good; full-bodied & roasty - rich & creamy. Add tart Michigan cherry juice and that's where you lose me. Hey, you goota give 'em credit for doing something different. I wonder if this stout will grow on me (?)."
"Pours opaque black with a thin tan head which doesn't stick around long. Very interesting aroma. Thick coffee and roasted grain, with some chocolate. The sweet cherries are also present in the nose. Taste full of roated flavor and chocolate, with plenty of cherries as well. Very much like eating chocolate cherry cake. Strange experience indeed! Although the cherry flavor is always present, it does not overpower the classic stout taste. Finish is sweet cherries mixed with bittersweet chocolate and some fruit acid. Chewy, almost oily mouthfeel - enjoyable, but not highly quaffable. A vinous character is derived from the fruit, especially noted in the acidic finish and the warming alchol that is perceived rather than tasted. A surprigingly good fruit stout, I had no idea what to expect. Definitely not a brew to start the evening with, or a session beer. Although it was good, it was like dessert, meaning the limit is one (maybe two) a night."
"Opaque, dark brown with cherry highlights. Thick, creamy, brown head. Looks great. Smells of musty, sour cherries with a mild chocolate backbone. The sour aroma overwhelms the nostrils. Taste is an overpowering dose of sour cherries. Some sweetened dark chocolate in the finish; just barely bitter. Definitely lacking in the expected flavors of a stout to balance out the sour cherry flavors. Not bad but not that great either, 'specially from the makers of Two Hearted Ale and Expedition Stout. I expected better. Wouldn't buy it againmy time and taste buds are too precious."
"Poured rather quickly from the bottle to the glass and no head. Poured very flately. The appearance is extremely dark, almost black. Highly dissapointed with this beer especially with the high hopes I had for it. I was expecting a nice stout taste accented with cherries and this could not have been farther from that. Very bland initial taste followed by a very tart aftertaste. Any cherry taste was non existant, save perhaps for the slightly medcinal aftertaste."
"Inky, dark brown body with a large, lacy, dark-cocoa-brown head with rosy-red accents. Very nice. The nose is intriguing and marvelous. I love it. Sweet and sour cherries cut through a dark, roasty, peaty malt. Big, unusual, and in your face too. Taste starts off with sourish, slightly-sweet cherries. They stay throughout, but are bolstered by a solid, roasty, chocolatey malt base. Some peat in there as well, along with notes of Bell's delicious yeast. Finish is long and like cherry-liquer drenched dark chocolate cake. Full-bodied, thick, with a nic, bottle-conditioned feel. A great dessert beer, although not for everyday quaffing."
"The beer pours a dark black with a significant tan head. Smells of cherry with a hint of coffee. The taste of sour cherries overwhelms all other flavors of the beer; only savoring it hints at any maltiness. While a tasty brew, I would not be drawn to it next time I am looking for a stout, as all the flavors of a true stout are not present. Would be excellent if ordered in lieu of, say, cherry pie at the end of a meal."
"This beer here is completly black, some sediment floating about, almost no light shines through the body. A darker brown head tops it off. Chocolaty scent with cherry as well. The taste is chocolate malts, some hop bitterness. Rushing behind this is a blast of cherry. Smooth creamy mouth. Excellent."
"Black as night with a small gingerbread ring of head. Smell is very tart cherry with lots of coffee. A lot of cherry flavor that isn't at all like a maraschino or candy flavor. Taste is tart and sour, which takes the flavor in an interesting direction. Stout flavors follow the initial cherry tartness, and end the beer in a nice coffee and roasted malt flavor. Mouthfeel could be a little thicker, but not that bad. Excellent dessert beer, not sessionable, but someting to be savored, especially with the $13 a 6 pack price tage. A beer like none other, I am glad that this brewery takes a chance on something like this."
"By flickering candlelight, this beer looked very dark and nearly black, with tinges of ruby around the edges. Topped with a soft creamy tan head. Beautiful aroma of chocolates and tangy tart cherries. dark roasted grains and caramel. The taste is very tangy and very rich. Goes down velvety smooth. Nice full roasty malt body with a tangy, lip-smacking finish. Not being a big fan of fruity stouts, I must say, this beer was pretty awesome."
"The bottle says that the chocolate and cherry dance on the tongue. It felt more like an all-out brawl to me. Sour cherry and chocolate espresso fight each other for dominance. There is absolutely no harmony between the two flavors. Making matters worse, the sourness of the cherry leaves behind a slightly rubbery taste. I had to force this one down."
" Drinkability is great if you love sour cherries otherwise don't see having this again for any reason. Thanks to merlin48 for this sample, and strange experience."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, however I actually think this could use a bit more body...a bit more thickness. Overall, it's just a damn tasty brew and one that I would be more than happy to have a few of. Kudos to Bell's and I look forward to trying more of their stouts."
"Kind of anxious to try this beer. An aggressive pour yielded a midnight black body with a quickly disapating 3 finger foam head. Cherries are definately present in the nose along with a nice roastiness. Taste was a little more tart than I was expecting. A whole lot of sour cherry flavor is capped off by a hint of chocolate and coffee. Very drinkable stout. The level of alcohol is nowhere noticable. Very good dessert beer."
"This beer pours a nice black color with a small head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is chocolate and cherries. The flavor is huge sour cherries, moving to a small blast of chocolate, finishing with another blast of sour cherry. The feel is moderate to thick. Drinkability suffers from the huge sour cherry flavor that gets in the way of the stout flavors. I would like to see more chocolate and coffee coming through."
"784"
"From a bottle (Thanks again Zac!) this pored a deep brown to black with ruby highlights. No head or lace. The aroma has roast malt and also carries some cherry hints. The cherry masks chocolate aromas. This is true of the taste. More roast malt subtle here, along with a cherry tartness and a mild hop finish. Caramel from the malt accents the sweetness of the cherry. Great silky mouth feel. Very drinkable."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Overall, this is not a great brew. I wouldn't buy again, and I'm glad I only had this one (rather expensive, at $2.50) bottle, instead of three more kicking around my cellar that I don't care to drink."
"12 oz chilled bottle hard-poured, but preserving the sediment in the bottle, December 2004. Pours thick and black with only a tiny dark brown head. Absolutely pitch black...no light penetrates. Smells more of coffee and scorched caramel than cherries, but cherry is present. Immediate taste is coffee and roast grains followed quickly by a sour and cherry flavor. My first taste was more of a marchiano cherry (the preserved cherries put into mixed drinks) rather than sweet eating cherry, but a sweeter smoother cherry was present in later tastes. I also get some watermelon. The end is rough roast grain and an unpleasant sour from the cherry. It's an interesting combination, not too unlike the funk in many belgians, but one I quickly tire of. Thick mouthfeel which should be important for a stout like this, but this actually delays the acidic sting of carbonation to mix with the cherry tart and roast grains to mix too many unpleasant characteristics at one. I'm glad I tried it, but won't likely try another."
"On draught at Winking Lizard. Despite remembering how tart this beer's bottled version is, I couldn't resist trying it on tap. Pours a dark brown (almost black) color with a compact light tan head and thin lacing. Cherry aroma is not as pronounced as I was expecting, despite the beer fortunately not being served too cold. Medium-bodied with strong tart cherry flavor up front. Light chocolate and coffee tones present, but barely. As with the bottled, I would enjoy this more if it were balanced better. The finish is fruity and smooth. I am glad I got to try the draught version, but this won't be high on my list to try again any time soon."
"The mouthfeel is fine if a bit thin. I dont think I can rate the drinkablity as very high as this would be a once in awhile beer for me. Still, I did enjoy this beer and I will add this to my stash of beer for non BAs to try."
"This one poured a very dark black with a nice tan head that fell quickly and left some lacing on the glass. The smell was of cherries, chocolate, and coffee. The taste was amazing. Sour cherries and chocolate with a touch of coffee. The mouthfeel was thick and smooth, as I have come to expect from Bell's. This is an excellent dessert beer, but I could not put down more than two at a time."
"This pours a dark black with a dark tan head that sits about about a 1/4"". It's a great looking beer. It smells of cherries and has a light chocolate aroma mixed in there. It has a chocolate flavor more so at first and then the cherry flavor follows shortly. Pretty good. The cherry is not overwhelming, it is a good amount. The mouthfeel is good. Medium. decent carbonation. I would definately recommend this beer. I didn't think I would like it. I've had a bad impression of cherry beers aside from lambics. Give it a whirl."
"The taste of this is phenomenal. The cherries jump out at you and hit you hard with a lip-smacking sweet-tart flavor. But instead of losing control, the roasted chocolate and coffee flavors quickly balance out the sweetness with a roasty bitterness. The finish is rather nice and dry for such an up-front sweet beer, and the mouthfeel is always thick and full without ever being syrupy. It honestly took me a few sips to really warm up to this, but after I did, I wanted another bottle. I need to find this and stock it in my cellar. Definitely a ""dessert"" beer, although I could see most folks not wanting more than one. I could make it a decent session stout on its own. Fantastic balance of fruit and beer. Lip-smackingly delicious."
"Drinkability and overall: an interesting sipper. No way this is a session for me. Could have done a better job with marrying the fruit and the beer. Way under-carbonated. Pretty good. I'd recommend it if you are a stout lover looking for something different."
"Reminiscent of minimally sweetened quality chocolate truffles alongside fresh bursting blackberries under a dollop of whipped heavy cream. Fudge, dense and layered, cut with tart fruit and chicory, a love triangle fit for formal endings or late night campfire staring."
"One is enough the second would get cloying. I'll occasionally have one."
"Drinkability is ok. This is not really for me, but I will give them credit for making a decent fruity beer."
"i don't know what happened with this one. i have had this the past couple years and always liked it to some degree, but this year's (winter 2004/2005) just came out a few days ago, and it is just not as i remember at all. i really don't even like it. perhaps it's a bad batch, or a bad year, i'm not sure. If i could rate this beer from memory, i would say that is used to be around a 3.85 or so."
"Highly enjoyable stout. Cherry flavors are well in place and sticks to the stout atmosphere. I went in expecting a fair offering, but I am very impressed. A fine dessert in itself, but could easily be paried with any rich dessert."
"Tha' beer gods be happy lad, ye lave tah' see anathar dey, dranch, and be happy, while ye still can!"
"Poured dark brown to black with a small tan head that didnt last. Aroma chocolate covered cherries, malt, plums, syrupy,. Flavor sour cherries, red wine, alcohol, medicine citrus, vinegar. Undecided about this one, I thought this might be a door after dinner beer but the more I drank it the more I changed my mind, too syrupy."
"Not my idea of a good fruit beer. The cherries give the beer to much sweetness and tartness. Notes of chocolate, cherries, dark fruits, sourness and roasted malts. Not very good. Rereview, after several sample recently of this brew, I really like it. It's a gem."
"Drinkability - a peculiar blend of flavors that combine for an unfamiliar taste. I like my stouts dark, roasty and coffee-like, not sour like a kriek. Not for me."
"I picked up this 12 oz bottle in Dearborn, MI and brought it back to CA to share with a friend. The beer pours a dark brown with an amber tint and very little head. The smell is one of the best I've smelled on a beer. It is a cherry and cinnamon combination that is well balanced and clean. Not overpowering but not too faint. The flavor is tart and sweet with cherry, prune, raisin, and dark malt flavors. The ending flavor is the best part. It blends with the alcohol warmth and gives a warm nutmeg flavor. I didn't like this beer the first few sips, but it got much better as it warmed up and my palate got adjusted to it."
"Poured a pitch black color with no carbonation really visible.If it wasnt for the ""pftt"" when I opened it Id think it was flat. Nice aroma-somewhat chocolatey with a trace of the cherries. The cherries dominate the flavor-very wine like and vinuous. A touch of roasted malt but the flavor is really dominated by the fruit. OK body-needs a tad more meat in it if you ask me. Dont know how many of these I could enjoy in one sitting. The idea is there but could use some refining for sure."
"Pours a deep brown, nearly black color. Not much head despite a vigorous pour. A thin, low brown head appears momentarily only to run away very quickly. Aroma has a typical stout smell of rich malts, cocoa, and molasses, but also an understated cherry smell. Not strong at all. Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery. Flavor is an interesting (odd?) mixture of things you'd expect from an imperial stout like intense and slightly bitter flavors, but the cherry tart and sweetness stomps all over the tongue and scares them away. Also has some tendencies toward currant and cranberry. Almost tastes like someone put cherry soda in my stout."
"My first Bells here finally having picked some up driving through Philly I was excited to finally try one of their brews. This poured out black with some red highlights and now head at all. The pour was not light either, just a few bubbles surfaced and no lace to had. Chocolate covered cherries are what I would say this smelled like. A fairly strong and simple nose to this. Cherry cough syrup anyone? This tastes like tart thick cherry juice that you might find in Robitussin. Way too tart and cherry like really taking away from any of the stout characteristics. Hmm there was a slight coffee after taste but even that isnt enough to help this brew. Medium and slick was the body on this. I dont think I will be trying this again anytime soon. Too bad I picked up 2 bottles, anyone want one?"
"The mouthfeel was smooth and slightly syrupy, and the tart cherry tones lasted long on the tongue after swallowing. One of these is enough in a sitting."
"12oz bottle sent from BrooklyBoy...thanks Ed. The pour revealed a black liquid that shuns light passing through my porter glass. 1finger pinkish-mocha tight cap that fades to ring....mildly carbonated. Nice subtle aromas of musty cocoa and sour cherries. The start is large with mucho roasted malts then the sour cherry takes up where normally stout bitter hops would be...interesting effect the sourness (instead of bitterness) lends an effect that almost makes this drink seem salty. Big burnt toast malt body, thick..then a long finish where the sour cherry mingles with the toasted malts to give a salty, smokey, sour finish...a real roller coaster ride. If this is 8%AVB its not detectable in the taste with all the sharp flavors pounding the tongue...you feel it later as a mild warming....a very unique stout..hops virtually undetectable and supplanted by sour cherry and sharp smokey tastes. Very unique."
"Very dark, almost black, with ruby highlights. Thick coffee colored head left thin sheets of lace. Aroma of cherries, dark chocolate, and coffee. Starts of with a nice roasted flavor, coffee and chocolate. Then the cherries come in. Maybe I am beginning to realize I am not the biggest cherry fan. I like black cherries. I like chocolate cover cherries (not the liquid center ones). I do not like the cherry flavor in this stout. Without the cherry, this is a great stout. And you get a taste of what it would be without cherries as the beer first enters your mouth. Lighter in body then expected and smooth. Not terrible, but not for me."
"Pours a muddied deep brown color with a tan head. Roasty malts, sour cherry, and chocolatey aromas. A bit medicinal on the palate, being a meld of tastes ranging from perfumy, sour cherry flavors to dark and roasty flavors. I like the sourness from the Michigan cherries used. Decent carbonation, a little spritzy. I'd have it again, only one at a time."
"Drinkability: I waited 9 months before buying this. Lacks character and purpose. Just like Weyerbacher's Rasberry IS, I find myself preferring the straight up stout to the fruit flavored one. Not horrible, but it seems tough to mix the two flavors and get it right."
"Very dark, thick pour with no head to speak of. Scents of cherry and maybe slightly of coffee, but nice and not too overpowering. Nice sour cherry taste that fades to coffee. Little bit of a toffee flavoring that lingers. Nice stout body, nice smooth mouthfeel, not too thick and just the right amount of carbination. After a few more sips the coffee flavor seems to become more pronounced. Those who do not like the sour beers may be get a thrill, but being a fan of stouts, sours, and well, anything slightly different... I find this quite nice. Not a session beer by far, but a nice one to throw in the mix every once in a while."
"Beer is good. Happy (mixed fruit) beering."
"Cherries and chocolate malt up front, cherry flavor becomes sourer and overpowers the other flavors until they all fade in the finish. Body is middle of the road, not much to the mouthfeel, a bit of fizzy carbonation, kind of like a thick soda. Overall the cherry flavor seems pretty natural, but its a little overbearing. An ok flavored stout, I like the Weyerbacher a little better though."
"Thanks to AKSmoked Porter for this bottle,pours a oily looking black with no head or no carbonation looked like a oil slick no trace of head here at all.Nice aroma though of tart cherries and bitter chocolate,big tart cherry flavor hits right away with some baking spices notes, with a taste of earthiness in the finish.Felt like a oil slick in the mouth as well Iam not sure what that feels like but this is it,a little cloying in sweet/sour dept as well.Probably the worst offering I have had from Bells but it was nice to try."
"enjoy this one, had trouble drinking it all."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed little more than a thin foamy film on top of the dark, dark brown opaque brew. Lacing was excellent for such a non-headed beer. Aroma just as you would expect, cherry and dark malts. The name of the beer indicates the brewer's priorities here: cherry first, stout next. The taste is all about the cherries up front, and you hardly get a chance to enjoy any of the obvious dark malt/stout flavors before everything's down the hatch. Not even a heavy malt aftertaste or anything. In my mind, the cherry could be backed off a bit and the grains cranked up a notch, and things would work better for the mouthfeel, which at this point is sour with a smoothing stout slide, but none of the stout flavors that you would expect anywhere in sight. Drinkability suffers some for the same reasons. An interesting brew, but I feel one with a bit of a misleading name."
"Deep black hue. Opaque. The brunette head reached a weak foamy cap before rapidly fading to a bubbly collar. There was no subsequent lacing. I am impressed with the depth of the color, the head, not so much. The nose has lovely roasted malts that produce aromas of coffee and chocolate. Cherry aromas are weak, would I have even known this was a cherry stout in a blind sniff test? Probably not but the smells are inviting. Hello cherries! Yep, I tasted them on the palate. The refreshing tartness of the cherries is found up front and they try to make there way to the middle but the rush of roasted malts takes over. It is the tale of two flavors. They work great as individuals but the harmony of the two tastes combined is quite noteworthy. The sweetness of the fruit is minimal and melts gracefully with the chocolate and coffee. Surprisingly the cherries reestablish the dominant position in the aftertaste. It is very tart and very refreshing. I couldnt taste the high alcohol content, it completely bypassed my tongue, but I did feel the heat in my stomach. The mouthfeel is both good and bad, I like the fullness and the low carbonation but the dry chalkiness is unpleasant. I must admit the tart cherry flavor got a little tiresome towards the end of my glass. As a whole this is a good stout, I cant see myself ever drinking more than one of these at a time. It is a change of pace beer or something to pair with dessert. It is worthy trying. I got my opportunity thanks to prAna."
"The taste, which my wife describes as cough syrup, pleases me. Its a mix of a creamy stout and a tootsie pop. The slight sour cherry flavor doesn't offend like a sweet flavor would, and compliments the toasted, malt body well. I find the beer to be very drinkable and hope to try another on tap some time."
"It is opaque back with no head and little carbonation. The aroma has a fruity tartness and some roasted malts in the nose. The cherry flavor is up front and then some mocha flavor hits. It is creamy and full bodied. A good dessert stout. I just wish that it was a little better carbonated."
"Determined to enjoy this beer @ all costs I let a couple warm for an hour or so in the hopes that more tastes would come from this brew. Unfortunately it did nothing to change my perception. I think Bell's needs to refine this brew because I think it could be something special if it was done right."
"Pours an opaque, dark brown with a medium sized brown head that retains well and leaves sheets of lacing. Aroma is interesting for a stout, with lots of chocolate but no coffee notes. Tart cherries are easily picked up in the nose. Mouthfeel seems light bodied from minimal carbonation, and there is tart acidity from the cherries. Still, an overall smooth mouthfeel. The roasted malts and coffee come on strong in the taste, as well as a medium chocolate presence. The tartness of the cherries seems out of place here, and something seems to be missing in the middle. It seems watered down at times. Finishes with a dry, roasted maltiness that is typical of a stout. Chocolate and Cherries offer a lot of promise for an excellent stout, but Bell's just hasn't got it right here, yet. Perhaps, this could use more toasted malts for a better balance. Not a bad stout, but there's a lot of room for improvement."
"Overall, I think a good stout lies underneath, but it melds with the cherry juice to form only a decent to solid fruit beer."
"Drinkability: Wasn't sure of this combo going in, but I enjoyed this one wuite a bit. Good balance of toasty malt and tart cherries. Another great offering from Bell's. Try this one when you can."
"Drinkability: This beer, while certainly a ""big"" beer, goes down surprisingly easy. Nicely done, and I would recommend this one."
"Mouthfeel is good but not great on this, some thickness, but not as much as I'd like in a stout. Drinkability is decent at first, but is definitely a liability toward the end."
"Thanks again to CRJMellor for this beaut!"
"If you like a sour cherries this is the beer for you! However, this isn't the beer for me. This is certainly something to try if you wonder how beer could be overpoweringly fruity and not sweet."
"Thanks for feloniousmonk for the sample and to xlperro for arranging the holiday goodness."
"Served from a 12 oz bottle, courtesy of Truthbrew froma recent trade. Pours out a deep dark brown color with just traces of dark tan foam swirling about the top of the glass. Aroma is a tantalizing blend of chocolate and coffee with subtle notes of cherry tartness. first taste was mostly malty and coffeeish at first, then the tang of tart cherries comes rushing in to fill out the flavor profile along with some hints of chocolate malt. The cherry flavor develops and becomes more apparent as you drink more, tastes very authentically cherryish, reminiscent of the Traverse City Cherry Festival. Body is more medium than full. Alcohol becomes a bit apparent in the finish but isn't too noticeable. A delicious stout from Bells, I'll have to find some more of this one..."
"Pours thick and black with no head. Aroma is all sour cherry. Taste is all sour cherry. Hey, I thought this was a stout not a lambic! Some very faint roasted malt flavors poke through as it warms, but it's too little, too late. If I'm drinking a stout, I want dark chocolate and roasted malts not lip puckering cherry. Not a bad beer by any means but not really much of a stout."
"Well, Bell's certainly isn't perfect. The cherry tartness doesn't mix well with the bitter roasted malt taste, and in fact overwhelms the beer. An interesting experiment, although a failed one, and I'm not likely to have another one of these."
"Pours very black in color with a thick tan head that. Aroma dominated by chocolate and roasted coffee with a subtle cherry underlying note. Very full-bodied in the mouth.The roasted malt really dominates the front and the cherry flavor kind smoothes the back end. Alcohol level is hidden pretty well with balanced flavors. I've yet to meet a fruit stout that I liked but this one grabbed my attention for some reason, really drinkable beer."
"A very interesting beer, and one I'm quite proud to have tried. Another big thanks goes out to the monk for this one!"
"Decent brownish head. Cherry/sweet malt smell. Cherry lactic flavor with a touch of dry coffee. A little overbearing with the sour cherry. Also a little light in the body as well... Quite carbonated and sparkely... It is unique.. it in my mind has an identity crisis."
"It appears as though Bell's could learn a thing or two from my mom. I'm not a brewer, but perhaps the answer is less sour cherry juice, whole cherries instead of juice, or maybe some percentage of sweet cherries. I really wanted to like Cherry Stout and feel that with a few tweaks here and there, it could be good."
"I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Interesting change-up from the typical stout taste. I think either you're a fan of the tartness that the cherries provide or you're not. For me this added another dimension as to what a stout could be. Very nicely done."
"Appearance: Deep dark pretty much opaque brew with a thin tan head, lacing is thin and pretty sparse. Aroma: Dark roasts produce mild dark chocolate and black coffee robust tones with an air of nuttiness and tart cherries blended in there. Is reminiscient of Amaretto with that almond cherry blend found in that. Tastes: Sharp acidic tartness in the forefront, blended by dark bitter roasts not very complex a bit one dimensional with tart cherries I don't think I am a fan of this one just doesn't do it for me. Mouthfeel: Rather thin figuring the appearance of a dark liquid pouring into my glass weighing in at 8% would be packing some chewy textures and full body right, well that's not the case here a medium to light bodied brew leaves me rather unimpressed. Drinkability: Just not my kind of stout lacks extreme body and contains entirely too much tart cherry juice, not a fan don't like it."
"Drinkability: Not that drinkable because of the alcohol content and the richness of the flavors. A very good dessert beer to have with some chocolate dessert or cherry dessert."
"Overall, this is a middle-of-the-road fruit beer. The sour aspect of the cherry juice added with the bitterness imparted by the hops and dark malt overwhelm the sweeter nature of the beer, leaving a tartness that is kind of hard to take in very large doses. Ill stay with others from Bells."
"It poured a very dark brown with not a whole lot of lasting head. The body was okay, but nothing great. The smell was a bit sour and just seemed ""off"" to me. Now to the taste...I have actually tried this one once before, but for some reason, I thought I would give it another go. My memory was that the taste was a real shocker and nothing like what I was hoping for, so I thought maybe with a different frame of mind, I would like it better, but alas, no such luck. For some reason, I just kept tasting what I would say was fermented prune juice and I honestly have not tried fermenting prune juice but imagine this is kind of what it would taste like. I must admit, I did not even get 1/2 way through this one. This may just be one that goes on the books as ""to odd for even a gueuze lover"". Keep in mind, while reading this review, I generally appreciate some of the ""odder"" funkier brews, but just not this time."
"Thanks for plucking my Cherry with this one Al  the last of the Bells but what a great Journey!"
"Everything I'd expect from Bell's. I've never been one to drink fruit beers and I don't think I'll start now, but I appreciate the Bell's effort to use cherries as an additive and, as always, put beer first."
"Into the Chalice goes this ebony beauty, the head baronial in size, creamy in its texture and the color a dark chocolate brown, as it dematerializes a glutinous and clinging sheet of lace is form to caress the glass. The nose is like a cherry chocolate coke that was a favorite of mine in the long distant past, sweet malt, coffee, and quite pleasing to the eyes and nose, start is cherry sweet with lots of malt, the top rich and plentiful as it clings to the palate. Finish is spirited in its acidity, the hops pleasantly spicy and the bittersweet chocolate aftertaste lingers on and on, another great beer from a great brewery, how lucky you Midwesterners are to have this readily available, and my thanks to tavernjef for his supplying me with this bottle."
"Dark black color. Small head. Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate and molasses. Full bodied. Roasted malts are chocolate and coffee. The cherry flavor is tart and sour and very definitely there, but it adds to the beers flavor while it still retains all the stout-like qualities. Flavors are chocolate, coffee and sour cherries. Smooth taste. Very nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, with a lingering sour cherry flavor. Amazing."
"8% ABV?! I had no idea, it's quite well hidden in here. This brew pours like Pepsi in every characteristic. Same color, and the fizzy head builds then dies even faster. Highly carbonated. Yeasty sediment floats around and some sticks to the bottom of the glass. Roasty malts, dark chocolate, and a tart cherry aroma come through in the nose. My lips puckered upon my first sip of this, the cherry flavor was more tart and powerful than I expected. Flavor has some very chocolatey malt notes...could probably pass for a chocolate cherry stout. The mouthfeel reflects the appearance, with some bubbly, fizzy characteristics. Feels a tad thin for a stout as well. After my first sip, I rather enjoyed the chocolate/cherry flavor. And like I said, the alcohol is well hidden, though after finishing the glass I do feel somewhat warmed. An interesting brew; nice flavor and smell, but could use some work towards becoming a true stout."
"It pours a dark red color with a nice off-white head and some lacing on the glass. The aroma is very sweet and malty with strong hints of cherries. The taste is odd, but interesting. It is quite sweet and it has a nice malty character. Slight sour from the cherries, but the cherries add a nice flavor. Interesting beer here."
"This one is a definite sipper...it gets better as it warms and takes on a lambic sourness. If you've ever wondered what a Gueze Stout would taste like, try this:) A very interesting and enjoyable brew from the stout masters at Kzoo."
"Poured an oily pitch black. Aroma is odd - cherry cough drop? Mouthfeel is thin and oily. Flavor is a whirlpool - dark roasted malt, sweet/tart bing cherry with some cherry pit bitterness. Some other fruity notes that are almost like a Belgian dark. Sharp bitter finish at the back of the tongue. I really pondered on this beer, sort of a love/hate relationship. The flavors were interesting, yet, at the same time, abrasive. It took me the whole bottle to finally decide if I liked the beer or not. My conclusion was that I did not, but the exercise was worth trying."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black color with 3 fingers of dark tan head. There is very little lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of cherries and roasted malt. A very unique aroma. The taste is a mix of tart cherries and sweet malt. There is a little bit of spice on the tongue also. There is cherry NyQuil/burnt malt aftertaste, a little weird. The mouthfeel is nice and strong, but this isn't a very drinkable stout, just average. It sure beats cough syrup at least!"
"Thanks to feloniousmonk."
"Before I even pour this brew, I find myself predisposed to not like it it. The idea of a Cherry Stout fills me with trepidations. But, I bravely pour on. The aroma of this beer does remind me of cherries. It pours a delicious looking very dark head of fine bubbles that slowly recedes. Its body is an opaque black as night black. The initial taste is as nauseating as I expected. I don't think I'll be able to finish it, but I drink on. My second taste is not as bad as the first. Still, I would rather have something else."
"Very pronounced flavors come in order. First there's the sweet maltiness of a regular stotu, then comes the extreme tartiness of the cherry followed last by a little bit of a bitter/sour finish. Each flavor works well alone but does not blend too well. Seemed to be less enjoyable the more I drank of them."
"This very dark beer pours with a thin, dark tan head that borders on brown as it wells up from the liquid. Most of the head clings to the edges of the glass, forming a thin collar. The aroma is coffee and cherry with a slight bitterness. I can pick up faint cherry notes as the glass sits on the desk in front of me. The taste is a little odd. The cherry is very evident, and then some decent roasted notes come in. Fairly bitter on the finish, with a slight sour cherry kick. Sweetness plays in and out during each sip. Earthy hops are also intermingled in. It is rather complex, but it doesn't seem like the flavors blend well. Coffee notes become more pronounced as you consume the glass. I was hoping for some nice chocolate notes to go with the cherry, but none is to be found. The mouthfeel is solid, but the carbonation is a bit light, leaning towards flat. Drinkability is OK, but it's really not all that enjoyable. It gets slightly better at room temp, but not by much. Interesting, maybe, but only due to the initial novelty. A good beer to buy a single of, for sure."
"Originally rated on 27 November 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. Trying a 2yr old bottle (thx hopsrus). What world of difference. Age this stuff!! nice tart cherry chocolate nose. Slightly tart flavor. Poured flat. INITIAL Rating:Dark brown, w/ a very tart cherry flavor. I didn't enjoy this one"
"-F"
"Pours black with a light brown, creamy head. The aroma is roasty, chocolatey, and coffee-like, with just a hint of sweet cherry. The flavor is sweet, roasty, and coffee-like. It is very light in the cherry aroma and flavor. It has a bit of sourness form the yeast that is used. It is a full-bodied beer with a dry roasty, bitter finish. Not too bad."
"$15 a six pack! This better be some kick ass S#%T! It pours opaque and the tan head is large at first and quickly subsides. The aroma is full of roastiness and cherries. Yeah there's the tartness! I wouldn't say it's even close to a good kriek lambic tartness, but it's definitely strong. It provided a nice goose-bump sensation a few times. Before the straight up cherry tartness kicks in, a solid foundation of roasty stout character leaves its presence known. What an odd stout. I didn't know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. It's weird getting tartness out of a stout but I really like it. I wouldn't mind if it had a stronger chocolate flavor so it could taste like chocolate covered cherries, YUM! It's close enough for me to really suggest that you try this beer."
"Cherry aroma in back of a dark roast malt. Surprisinly light on the cherry, sweetens some in time. Black with a medium head that quicly thins to a stable brown layer. Flavors are a pretty good mix of roast malt and cherry, neither overpowering. Tartness in the middle with a bit of sourness that's not unpleasant, but not overly satisfying either. Medium mouthfeel with some chewiness to it. Rather flat, but maybe even a little too flat for me. Balanced well, but the cherry taste was too much of a sour presence, which I found distracting."
"Re-reviewed 9/9/04 - Color is a beautiful deep brown color with a deep red tone when put up to the light nearly black otherwise with a small tannish dark top of thickened froth that sits awhile then fades to leave some sticky spots of lace. The cherry smell is there in a deep sweet, nearly sour tone, but not over powering like a cider or lambic and has a nice heavy roasted malt aroma with some chocolate and molasses taking over in the background. Tastes tangy, quite so that the cherry is a bit much, not as balanced as it used to be, or at least from what I remember from the first time I had it. Just right for a cherry lover though, a deep sweet cherry tanged bite really pops and grabs the palate. Roasted malt with some chocolate and molasses tones are hidden way underneath the cherry. Good feel thats smooth and milky clean with a largely set cherry sour bittering kick. Not as easy to drink as I remember. Still good but now that my tastes have changed the tang of the cherry seems over the top now for me."
"A very dark beer with just a tinge of reddish brown around the edges. I too tried a vigorous pour and saw negligible head. The tart cherry flavor makes this burnt stout uncommonly bitter. Little carbonation makes it smooth. It is hard to drink this beer for what it is and not compare it to Sam Adam's Cherry Wheat or Stoney Creek's Vanilla Porter, two of my favorite beers."
"Dark black color. Small head. Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate and molasses. Full bodied. Roasted malts are chocolate and coffee. The cherry flavor is tart and sour and very definitely there, and definitely adds to the flavor while retaining the stout-like qualities. Flavors are chocolate, coffee and sour cherries. Smooth taste. Very nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, with a lingering sour cherry flavor. I do not particularly like fruit in my beer but... this is done very well. Amazing."
"This was an extremely sad experience for me, as Bell's Cherry Stout has long been a favorite, and an excellent cellaring beer. The toned down flavors, and missing carbonation do not bode well for its future, but I will cellar the other bottles I purchased at the same time in hopes that they improve with age - certainly not getting much worse. Hopefully, when I open the others, I will be editing my review in the future to be more positive."
"Black and opaque. This would absorb a spot light. Brown head quickly and audibly fizzles down in a lambic like fashion into a meager ring around the glass. Bittersweet combination of burnt roasted barley and bright cherry sweetness dominates the aroma, with caramelized sweetness and milky chocolate secondary. Akin to a kriek / dry stout hybrid aromawise. Flavorwise, cherry is slightly unripe in nature, yielding a mild tartness that is the predominant counterpoint to both residual and dark caramel malt sweetness, due to the light hop bitterness. Undertone of disparate, non malt derived lactose sweetness adds depth and aids in the creamy, dextrinous mouthfeel. Clean roasted barley bitterness emerges late only to be offset by a resurgence of fruit laced sweetness. Finishes with an candyish extension of the malt profile-- not unlike chewing on an M & M, cherry Skittle and chocolate covered coffee bean simultaneously. Bell's Cherry Stout is certainly an eclectic and flavorful brew. It's complex enough to warrant a 22 ounce portion to give the palate more time to adjust and decipher. The pseudolambic tartness almost integrates perfectly. Big thanks to Feloniousmonk for the bottle, but the 12 ounce was a tease!"
"Cherry stout! What'll they think up next in Kalamazoo? Banana stout? Fig stout? Dragonfruit stout? Bring it on, Bell's!"
"After a vigorous pour there is not much head, and whatever head there is quickly dissipates then leaves a small ring around the glass... then that quickly dies. On the nose the aroma consists of hints of caramel malt and cherries. On the palate more malt & cherries which almost produces a red wine type flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth/silky. Not bad"
"A vigorous pour only produced a small 1/2 inch head that quickly faded to a thin collar and then nothing at all. Pours a black as coal syrup like with slight red highlights and a reddish tan head. Aroma of sour cherries and a surprising smoky scent. Taste of sour cherry, roasted malt, and other dark fruits. Nice carbonation in the mouthfeel, as well as a tart finish. Good drinkability for me, a pleasant surprise. Great dessert beer!"
"This beer poured a very dark amber, almost black color and formed a dark bubbly tan head that subsided quickly and left little lace. An aroma of of malt and dark cherries. A flavor of malt and dark cherry. A bit of sourness is present in the finish, no doubt inpacted by the cherry. As far as stouts go it is servicable, but not one of my favorites, even of the November Stouts."
"Clear (presumably) black pour with no head aside from a sparse ring around the edge. Strong nose is dominated by the scent of roasted malt. Cherry notes can be detected, though I'm not sure I would know they were there if this weren't a cherry stout. Any doubt regarding the cherries is erased by the first sip, which begins with a rush of sour cherry flavor that only partly gives way eventually to the roasted tones that dominate this beer's nose. I'm a big fan of both cherries and stouts, but the former is too dominant in this brew. A pretty good mouthfeel and decent drinkability, though the cherry flavor sticks around long than I would like."
"This stout pours a rich black with red highlights and a tan head that also has red highlights. The head pours very frothy but dissipates quickly to a thin ring. The aroma is dried cherries with undertones of alcohol. The taste starts with a bite of sour cherry with medicine flavors and a stinging to the roof of your mouth.The finish is black malt bitterness with hints of coffee and chicory. The aftertaste is very dry with competing flavors of black malt, medicine, and sour cherry. The mouthfeel is that of a rich and silky stout. IMHO this stout taste too artificial. If whole cherries had been added to the secondary or if it was aged for a few months with real cherries then it might be a much better product. This stout has the potential to be a great stout. To bad they cheaped out and used artificial tasting cherry juice. Or could it be that this is what sour cherries really taste like? If so; then I don't need them in my stout."
"Dark brown cloudy color, small and thin brown head. Chocolate roastey malty cherry aroma. Sour cherry and coffee flavors,alot of sweetness in this one, a little thiner than I expected, I don't really care for fruity beers but this one is allright."
"My fourth different stout from Bell's that I can't normally get. So far, I haven't been blown away, but it is good to see a brewer express his creativity."
"Reddish black with no head at all... even after an aggressive pour. Aroma is subdued and pleasant. Cherries and coffee, with a bit of sugary sweetness. Flavor is quite the opposite... it goes a bit over the top with cherry tartness, with a touch of sweetness and some roasted bitterness. Body is a bit too thin and metallic. This is not a bad beer, but is definately not something I'd drink unless I'm in the mood for something different."
"The pour is pitch black with a red-tinted, fizzy head that subsides after about 45 seconds. Nose is big on cherries and sweet malt. The taste is similar, bordering on sour cherries, coffee, sweet malt and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is very carbonated, perhaps overly so for the style. Very prickly on the tongue. Drinkability is better than average. Not suggested if not in the mood for a sour, acidic brew. This stout reminded me of a kriek lambic with a black body. Not Bell's best stout, but it's interesting nonetheless."
"This is the most expensive six-pack I have indulged in since my recent Belgian adventure.  The stout pours with a deep dark color and reddish tan head that evaporates almost immediately.  The aroma of oak and sour cherry and a hint of dark malt is differnt and intriguing. The cherry character of the brew is obvious lending a densely sour fruitiness to the flavor.  This fruit is ideal for a special stout.  The sourness compliments the dark malts and heavy body very well.  I am going to cellar this and see how it is in a few months."
"Dark black, but light does seep through the edges. Nice creamy dark tan head that looks like it could hang around awhile, but doesn't as it retreats to the edges of the glass. Aroma is rich dark roasted malts, very small burnt hints, but no cherry. Aroma is rich dark roast malts, with some chocolate, and more of the faint hint of burnt malt. Flavor is surprisingly tart, more because I wasn't expecting it to be so than it's actual acidity. It's hard to pick up a distinct cherry flavor (other than the tartness) as it gets buried under the malt, but it blends into a subtle characer to the flavor."
"Thick black pour, speckly dark head that diminishes as big carbonation breaks (like asphalt).  Cherry and coffee aromas, like a flavored java.  Very cherry flavor, not at all sweetened, so tending toward the sour.  The well-roasted malts burst through as the flavor diminishes in the back.  The upfront taste is not for me, I couldn't recommend it to someone with similar tastes.  The coffee tones are impressive, nice body, but not for me."
"This beer IS black.  A big brown head literally fizzles (you can hear it) down to nothing in 10 seconds flat.  Sour cherry and sweet malt on the nose.  The beer has a bit too much carbonation.  On the tongue, I get sweet cherry, alcohol and some burnt malts.  Pretty nice, but I would probably put it on one of the bottom rungs of the Bell's Stouts Ladder (10 in all).  At times, this tastes similar to cherry pie.  Then the alcohol seems to barge in."
"Bell's is one of my favorite breweries, if not my favorite.  Having said that, not all beers are to my liking from any one brewery.  The dark appearance is wonderful, but the cherry taste seems to overpower the stout.  Sweet and tangy.  Sweet Stout lovers will like this one.  I'll take the regular Bell's Stout thank you."
"A must try, if only for its uniqueness."
"Overall, a good stout.  Tart cherry flavor is fairly strong.  A bit 'lighter' body than I usually prefer in stouts, but not so much as to be a detriment to the beer overall."
