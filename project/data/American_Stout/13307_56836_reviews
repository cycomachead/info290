"Smooth oatmeal stout with light coffee hints"
""
"Despite this being related to a Stout, it got as much IPA in it, and I love both sides, because they add up so well together. The long aftertaste rounds it all up, as it is defined by a hoppy bitterness, which goes along with a strong malt backbone, which, again, stand in perfect balance to each other."
"The coffee used seems to be quite funky, with a hint of barnyard coming through"
"Teku glass. Bottle. Pitch black with moch-like, densed head. Medium head retention. Very good lacing. Rich aroma of roasted malts - mainly coffee combined with medium to high hops aroma (resin, light grapefruit, pine), some dried fruits in the background. Taste is great. Medium to high hop bitterness. Solid malt and oat flavour. Little coffee acidity. Medium body, medium carbonation,  creamy/oily texture, semi-dry. Semi-bitter, semi-dry, coffee finish. Great."

"This was my first try at Mikkeller and I'm so glad that I know how good they can be.  Probably the best black IPA I've had although it's more like a stout.  But really great stuff."

"Top-notch beer, don't let this one slide by if you enjoy beer brewed with coffee."
"Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast is amazing and one of my favorites, but this beer shows that you can't just add hops to anything to make it better. The coffee and hops compete with each other too much and destroy each other to create another hoppy stout mostly indistinguishable from the  others. It looks nice at least. I really like hops, but there are other beers better suited to showcase hop flavors than this."
"Says ""Black India Pals Ale brewed with coffee"" on bottle. It is. Ipa with lots of coffee."

"The beauty of these really dark beers is that when I employ an aggro pour, the pseudo-cascade is extremely visible. I sat back in awe and watched it settle into two fingers of very dense, deep-tan/light-brown head with good retention. Color was an Opaque Black (SRM = 44) and it looked like the depths of outer space in my glass. Nose was both dark-roasted coffee and fresh mint, possibly spearmint or perhaps peppermint. Very nice! Mouthfeel was slightly full, just a step above medium. The taste was what I want from this Cascadian/Dark/Black IPA style - mint, chocolate and coffee! I was actually getting the hops, which is not usually the case. I was really reminded of a York Peppermint Patty, especially since I was getting the sensation. Finish was semi-dry and very pleasant. I could drink a few of these before reaching for a regular AIPA."

"O - A very enjoyable beer. It is big and has bold flavors, but it has comparatively more balance than many American stouts."
"Very good."

"thick and wholesome. roasty and toasted malt, barley and coffee. nice tannish head. more coffee-ish than espresso-ish. beautiful creamy tan head. super dark brown body. the tannins and bitter residual from the coffee come with the very slight hops. very coffee-bitter at the end...."

"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque in the glass with a thin head dissipating to light patches and a thin ring around the glass, slight lacing. Aroma of sweet dark toasted malt, light coffee, hints of chocolate and mint. Flavor folllows aroma, with toasted malt, rich quality coffee, cocoa, milk chocolate, light grassy hops, very nicely integrated. Medium body with light creaminess. An excellent, very well balanced coffee stout with a rich, creamy oatmeal stout body supplemented with good quality coffee and cocoa flavors. Smooth and very tasty."

"O: I've been losing interest in stouts, admitted, so I decided to pick this one up on a whim to give it a whirl. This brew has successfully reminded me of why I loved stouts in the first place. Lots of roasted coffee flavors that are perfectly balanced with some dark chocolate notes and a delicate hint of hops. This brew definitely satisfied and makes for a perfect treat in the early afternoon or late at night."

",this is good beer but one that I've never really had on my own, mikkel hop breakfast is something I've always wanted to try but at the same time its rosti its hot the intended peppers shine through. Nice hot peppery stout. Aftertaste is peppery, spicy, roasted, red green and yellow peppers,Habanero, awesome."

"Wonderful hoppy and dark malt scents that err on the sweet side. The palate mimics the nose closely, with a nice kiss of char and huge bite of bitterness. Would gladly have this hop forward offering again."
""
"Interesting hybrid beer. A cross between a black IPA and a flavored oatmeal stout. Tons of complexity. The aftertaste threw me off a little but did not ruin the experience. Definitely a unique beer but I personally prefer beer geek breakfast."
""

"Bottle snagged from Tipples. Pours pitch black into my tulip with a big fluffy mocha head. Aroma if lemony hops, chocolatey roast that somehow seem to work nicely together. The flavor follows with an initial burst of bitter lemon hop flavor, then fades into big roasty chocolate, and then leaves a strangely lemon chocolate combo on the palate, but more lemon than chocolate. Velvety and smooth mouthfeel, medium carbonation. This is very unique and the only other stout I have had with this level of hops is Darkness, but the flavor profile is totally different. Glad to try it, it is tasty, but I don't know that I would want this on a regular basis. Kind of like someone poured lemon pinesol in my FIS."
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, dark chocolate, herbal hop, and slight rubber aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, coffee, and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a fairly intense presence from both the roasty and hop flavors."

"O- Hop heads and coffee lovers unite. Right there with Stone on their coffee ipa. Really enjoy the unique aspect of this one."
"Listed as a black IPA on the label. Marketing or just poking fun at the grey area here? New beer geek style label with french pressed hops. Pours a very very dark brown, near black in the glass, two fingers thick dark brown, ultra dense, thought it would last forever but in reality only 5 minutes head. Sheet of delicate lace down half the glass. Smell: ultra earthy coffee, pine, very woody, cardamom. Taste: pine, espresso, molasses, toasted brown bread, dark chocolate, pine + espresso in the finish. This is very good."

"O - If you really want that hoppy stout with a strong coffee flavor, get this; don't think twice, get it. If you prefer your stouts smooth with some vanilla, chocolate, and spice, well this is still worth a try. Great brew from a great brewer."
"500 ml bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but was released recently. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, grapefruit, orange zest, pine, floral, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Awesome aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted malt, coffee, and hop notes; with big strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, grapefruit, orange zest, pine, floral, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of roasted/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, citrus, pine, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome balance and complexity of roasted malt, coffee, and hop flavors; with a great hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic hoppy coffee stout. All around great balance and complexity of roasted malt, coffee, and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering"

"A pleasant surprise. I thought this was a second bottle of Beer Geek Brunch that I had brought back from Stein's in New Orleans last year. Pulled the bottle and was pleasantly surprised to see my mistake. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It is like a Baltic breakfast stout. Hoppy, sweet and delicious. Need to make more mistakes like this. Only thing I would change, would be to add just a little more body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - My favorite that I've had from the breakfast lineup. Very drinkable but like usual, Mikkeller is just so expensive."
""
"Have had better dark beers, this one tastes quite heavy but not quite a full enough flavour to compensate for the weighty bitterness. Just a bit ashy and astringent. Not an everyday beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Visually really really appealing, pitch black body flowing huge tan head frothing above the sides of my chalice, fine even lacing as it slowly fades. Aroma has dark chocolate bitterness and hint of pine and citrus tone hops in the background with a somewhat creamed coffee in the middle. Bitterness unwavering bitterness green hops assault the palate with a pelletized hop concentration black malts (mainly black patent bring out the charcoal and roasted malt bitterness) so there's a bit of a tag team combo hitting me hard right now. I really couldn't tell you they used oatmeal, but dark bitter coffee, dark malts, and hops are screaming hello!!! Mouthfeel never gets past any one of the waves of bitterness it coats all dimensions of the palate, medium bodied even solid carbonation no issues there just the lacquer known has beer hop breakfast is left behind coating the entire palate with a lingering unbalanced bitterness. Overall I wish the gypsy brewer had a stroke of finesse in his paint brush, maybe due to the country where the brewing scene is breaking out like a punk rock movement do most of these guys feel the need to brew this way. Believe me I like extreme beer I just like well balanced big beers."
""
""
""
"O- I enjoy Beer Geek Breakfast more, but this is still a solid beer. Hoppiness makes it almost taste like a black IPA."
""
""
"O: This is good stuff, just not really what I was expecting given the Stout style description. I suppose the word ""Hop"" in the name should've been a give away, but still. . . think of this as an American Black Ale and you'll be pleased."
""
""
""
" Pours up amazing foamy dark tan head. Great lacing. The head made it thru the whole journey. Aroma is very hoppy, some malts creeping thru. Nice aroma. Now the taste. It's too much. You've got big bold malts battling heavy hops. I don't ever eat chocolate with ketchup. It's too crazy in this bottle! It's not bad but it's not good. Full bodied. Heavy crispy carbo. Meh. Just an experiment I suppose"
""
"Overall - A nice imperial stout with an extra dimension from the hops. It's not uber complex but there are some nice layers here that make it interesting. I won't go out of my way to search this out but I will pick it up again if I see it for a decent price."
""
""
""
"O-definitely an awesome stout. Has a high quality flavor to it, something you expect from a high profile stout."

"Beer Hop Breakfast is a fascinating beer, that even after an entire bottle I still don't feel that I have fully explored the beer, nor decided about its character. It's certainly a complex beer that has some bully-ish overtones. Though it's taste is brash, it seems to work somehow."
"O - While the bitterness from the hops seemed a bit overwhelming at first, the flavors really start to blend and work together as the beer goes along. A stout hopped like a pale ale is certainly an interesting experience. While I wouldn't drink this beer regularly, I definitely appreciate the experience and I think Mikkeller did a great job with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Nice hoppy stout. Great overall balance."
""
""
""
"Interesting combination of flavors. The citrus juxtaposes the roast malt and coffee, which are complemented well by the bitter, resiny hops. But it's too bitter for my liking."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dull black with almost no head. The nose is bitter with a faint roastiness. Tasting presents a bit of alcohol with a lot more burnt roastiness and much more of the juicy, piney hops, which announce themselves startlingly on my unsuspecting palate. The mouthfeel is heavy, but not thick/chewy like a ris, with a saturating bitterness. It's a good beer with a bitterness at the caliber of a fresh oak aged yeti."
""
"yup, i think this tops the beer geek breakfast for me, what an awesome brew this is! big thanks to my lovely girlfriend for hooking this up as an xmas present for me. the pour is real dark, pushing black, no light through at all. big frothy four fingers of white lace on top, settling some, but not going totally away. the nose and taste are both coffee first, rich and black, fresh brewed, but its not as intense as mikkellers other coffee stouts. its tempered here by a lot of oats and some malt sweetness, and hops! the hops are low key, bitter but not oily or pungent too much, just a nice complement to the bitterness of the coffee and a knife through the sugary malts. heavy roast, delicious. finish is long and complex, evolving. feel makes it though, so much smoothness in texture from the oats, no coffee acidity at all, i have no idea how he does it, but this beer is extraordinary. full body, just enough carbonation. i would honestly be more than happy to drink this beer for breakfast anytime. it has everything you need. couldnt feel the caffeine in this one like i could in some of his others, but nevermind that. this is outstanding, more than outstanding. one of his best, and thats saying a lot from me."
""
"O: This is an enjoyable beer (as are most of the Mikkeller Breakfast beers, in my opinion) with a nice complexity of flavor and a pleasant hop bite. The alcohol is well hidden and I would be happy to have another one of these."
"Overall: Enjoyable beverage, comparable to Founder's Double Chocolate Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Once again, Mikkeller has failed once again. This brew was not worth the $10 tag. Dissapointment."
"Thin dark tan head on a jet black body and nice tan lacing. Absolutely great coffee aroma, earthy hops, fire wood and campfire with hints of cocoa. Flavor is very good as well with more excellent espresso and coffee roast, toasted malts, earthy hops, hint of dark chocolate. Medium body and light to medium body for the style. Great coffee flavor, near perfect coffee, roasted malt and hop balance. Only thing to make this one better would be a more complex hop profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: tried cause I love the breakfast variations I've tried in the past, fully expecting this to be a mediocre experiment. Not so much. Quite good."
""
"O - Definitely a stout made in heaven! Well crafted and with very complex aromas and flavors. Seek it out now!"
"Ordered a goblet for $8 at Top Hops in LES, NYC, and it made for a perfect fall beer. There was a deep, roasted malt character complemented by a sharp, citrus hop bite. The citrus hops didn't get much of a chance to stand out from the richly mocha barley, but they did blend in wonderfully for a long, lingering pine and cocoa finish. I like that the ABV isn't over the top, yet it's still a fantastic sipping beer. Get yourself a glass and let the dry cocoa, coffee bean, and American hops roll around on your tongue."
""
""
"A high recommendation that I will seek out again as I really liked this crazy combo of strong hops blended with coffee and chocolate malts. There was a ton of sediment in the last sip, and it washed over my tongue like a bitter stout poured through a burnt wood funnel, complete with chunks that closed the door on a great beer experience."
"Overall, this is a great beer, but at $10.40 for a half liter, it should be killer."
""
""
""
""
"Reisinous hops, roasty-Cascadian IPA all the way. Well-balanced and great flavor. Another winner from Mikkeller. A bit pricey but certainly worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"O-My introduction to mikkeller and I will certainly be trying the remaining brews I can get my hands on."
""
""
"16.9 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch and a half frothy tan head that stayed around a while. There's also a lot of lacing left on the glass. It smells like roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, piney hops, burnt/charred malt, and some light citrusy hops. I think the taste is just like the aroma. It's roasty, hoppy, bitter and sweet all at the same time. It's a very tasty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and easy to drink with good carbonation. I'm liking this beer a lot, and I plan on picking up another bottle soon! $9.99 a bottle."
""
""
"Overall a very nice hoppy stout that tastes really good. I can't find much to complain about, but there's nothig that makes it a really memorable beer - just a good solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black in color with a tall tan head. Citrus peel, floral, and perfume. Hints of chocolate, lots of roasted malt, some ash, and a bit of char. Maybe a little bit of alcohol. Flavor is quite ashy, heavy on the roast, and a fair amount of bitterness. Some dark chocolate, piney hops, and a hint of citrus peel."
""
""
""
"Beer hop breakfast indeed. Very good."
""
"A deep complex soup. Much hops. And much more."
"this is a nice one time experience - with that said i wouldn't want to drink it again. a bit off tasting with the amount of hops they used."
""
""
""
""
"Do I like it? Maybe. Do I love it? Not really. But, keep at it, Mikkeller, you've more hits than misses, and your misses are interesting enough. (But, perhaps not exactly worth the price.)"
""
""
"A very impressive beer, and one that has reminded me why I like Mikkeller so much."
"A delicious stout with an amped up hop profile. Deep complexities and tons of flavor. Impressive blend of bitterness from all of the roast and hops."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a true pint, the beer is an extremely dark auburn-brown to almost black coloring with a tall, frothy, dense, chocolate milk colored head that quickly recedes into a thin, filmy coating. Aromas are roasty, with a heavy mocha and slight hoppy balance. Smells heavy and delicious. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a dark coffee backbone that almost has a charcoal character to it. Resiny hops highlights throughout, with an unbalance that strangely works with the style. The body is slightly thinner than I was expecting for the style, and even after I poured it, but it works. The aftertaste has a slight smoke and roast, but surprisingly more hoppy than anything. Wet, resiny, bitter hops at the end of the palate make it feel like you just drank a heavy DIPA. The finish is rich, slick, and with a slight roasty linger. Good, solid brew."
"O - Glad I tried this, and it is pretty tasty. The intense hop bitterness almost moves this into black ale territory. A bit of added sweetness would bump this up a notch for me, but still a good brew."
""
""
"Overall this is a fantastic beer and has almost nothing at all to do with hops. Just a fantastic oatmeal stout."
""
""
"Final Thoughts - at $11 a pop and a 7.5 abv, this is expensive, but awesome, awesome beer"
""
"D: Enjoying the pronounced hop and malt profiles that compliment each other very well. Incredibly bitter and dry characteristics that I wish I could magically sprinkle into any beer when I want. Impressed."
""
"O= This is an odd combo. It works if you expect it but I cannot see myself drinking more than this bottle. A weird mix for sure. Check it out and see if you like it. Who knows it could be the next big thing. Mikkeller always like to push the envelope and this is one of those. Tasty once and maybe sketchy twice."
""
""
"Overall this has been the best beer that I have had from Mikkeller. Their beers are usually done well but not well enough to justify the price they charge. However this one was worth the price and I'd buy it again."
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with fairly aggressive carbonation that makes this a bit prickly on the palate. A fairly high alcohol content in an oatmeal stout would suggest a thicker beer with a smoother carbonation. This is not particularly smooth at all: the carbonation level makes you sip it rather quickly. Finish is mostly dry with a bit of stickiness around the edges of the mouth."
"This isn't as robust or full bodied as I would have hoped, but it is smooth and flavorful. It's worth checking out."
""
""
""
"O/D - Quite a good hoppy stout. Richness makes it clearly a stout and not a black IPA. Really drinkable. Nails it pretty good."
""
""
""
"O: Not my cup of brew. I can see how someone really into stouts would love this beer, but it's just not for me. I expected more hops, less stout and coffee."
"A quality stout, though it falls just short of superb. The hop flavour doesn't really come across - subtle hints that are smothered by an excess of coffee. The mouthfeel also seems a tad thin. However, the coffee/malt character are without deficiency. All in all, a beer that strives for greatness and is found wanting. Which isn't to say that it's bad - grab one if you can stomach the price."
""
""
"Could use more carbonation to create a creamier mouthfeel."
"Overall this is a very interesting beer that combines the stout and ipa styles which are my two favorites into one bottle. Definitely not for all beer geeks but it was tasty and very interesting for me. For $10.99 i would not seek this out again as this is not quite a world class brew."
"Thick two finger head of super dark brown, surface filled with larger bubbles which contributes to a steady dissolve, you can watch it disappear, the lacing has moderate strength but not so much density. The liquid is fully black, however, you see some tiny bubbles rising inside and the outer rims and surface take on a yellow hue, looks sturdy. The nose offers palpable coffee roast along with powdered chocolate and cocoa, big burst of pink grapefruit and pine betrays the hops presence, in some ways the green herbal nature becomes dominant, minor notes of plum or cherry fruit, doesn’t come across as sweet as expected. Medium-bodied, what’s there feels heavy on the tongue, here the roast more pronounced and bitter, coffee grounds, dark chocolate, mocha, tar, tobacco resin with toasted bread more than softer yeast accents. The pine, grapefruit and leaf to grass hops bust right up the middle, minimal sweetness found on the tongue too. The carbonation is subtly refreshing more than a definite presence. No real fruit presence, the finish becomes more astringent to bitter. Tastes clearly like a fusion of two different beers. More curious than pleasurable."
"Probably my least favourite of the Beer Geek series so far."
"O: Disappointing. Not a bad oatmeal stout but doesn't live up to the price or hype."
"Overall - not a bad tasting brew, but it is quite a shock at first. But interesting to think about."
"O - This is a very nice coffee stout. Yet another really good brew from Mikkeller."
""
"O - Overall, this beer is tough for me to review. It walks a line between two styles. Not quite as hop heavy as I'd like for a black IPA, and not nearly as creamy chewy as I'd want for a stout. That being said, this is still another solid offering from Mikkeller."
"Overall a nice assault by Mikkeller."
"Update: Definitely notice the coffee more throughout and there is a strong yeast flavor, it's maybe covered up by the other strong flavors."
""
""
""
"O: Incredible beer that every beer lover should try."
""
""
""
""
"Just to the light of mid bodied, nearly creamy. Drinks pretty easy, but there is a warming for only 7.5%. Wasn't sure what to expect with this, it is different but pretty good."
""
"This was a good experience, but the balance just didn't work out for me. I may age the bottle (or trade it) to get the edge off."
""
"works better than I thought it would on paper. didn't think adding coffee to a black ipa or more technically adding hops to a coffee/oatmeal stout would work well, but this does. I would like to see this done a bit more. The hops were definitely more present in the aroma, and the taste falls off a bit from there in overall intensity."
""
"Overall: This is one of the tastiest ABAs I have come across; have a very hard time seeing how it fits into the Beer Geek Breakfast series, however"
""
""
"O: Great in some dimensions, lacking in others. If you like a hoppy stout, this beer is for you."
"A hoppy stout, but a good one."
"Despite the mouthfeel not matching up with the nose and taste this is an excellent beer. It definitely has the most assertive hop character is any stout I have every had and it does so without being too bitter and without encroaching on the other characteristics. Very well done."
""
""
"O: Never had something like this with the amount of hops in a stout, something different, probably couldn't drink two in a row"
""
""
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy...yet the bitters of the hops and coffee are very overpowering. Nothing wrong with that on many levels but just not a preferred lingering mouthfeel that I enjoy."
""
"The order goes like this: Beer Geek Brunch > Beer Geek Breakfast > Beer Hop Breakfast. That isn’t to say Hop Breakfast is bad. The aroma’s great, and it’s so highly hopped that I confused it at times with a Black IPA. The citrusy hops just never meld with the coffee in a way that agrees with my palate."
"Beer Hop Breakfast is a very dark black color with a thickish look. The dark brown mocha colored foam up top has great retention with minor sticks. a slick coats the glass when sipping. Smell is very hoppy, pine is very in charge with earthy tones and coffe grinds. Roasted malt plays a part as well. Tasting this, Beer Hop Breakfast delivers, hops and coffee. Some flaked oats (oatmeal) with roasted malt and a somewhat astringent bitter taste towards the end. Like most Mikkeller beers, Im not a big fan of this one. Feel is a nice healthy medium and probably bigger than that. Fair carb with a piney, lasting aftertaste that kills things (at least for me). Mikkeller is hit or miss with me, and this one was not a hit. I could not even finish my glass."
"O: I generally do not care for hoppy stouts, but I find this one to be very interesting. This is really a near excellent American-style stout. Very much worth picking up."
""
"O: I wasn't very impressed, certainly liked the Beer Geek better. I didn't like that there wasnt any coffee coming though. If you told me it was a Black IPA versus a 'Imperial Stout with Coffee and Hops' I'd certainly believe you. Interesting, but not the best I've had."
"O: A very interesting variation on Beer Geek Breakfast. The hops dominate like no other, but I think that was the point. I do wish it was a bit thicker in body because I think it would work better. However, Beer Geek is pretty thin, too. Nice work by Mikkeller, and certainly worth a try, but I probably don't need to have this one again for a while."
""
""
""
"A lot of hop, some stout. This could almost pass for a black IPA. I'm still not a huge fan of Mikkeller's stouts, but I appreciate the Beer Geek Series thus far. For how hoppy this beer is, I imagined more body and more dark flavors. Especially with the rise of black ales and IPAs it's really important to distinguish between styles. This beer almost comes in a gray area between the two."
"O - From the smell, I was expecting something more like a black IPA on steriods, but what I got was an average stout, with a descent hop finish."
"Lots of coffee and a strong piney, grassy hop flavor. Malty with moderate sweetness and dark chocolate. Not that thick which makes this pretty easy to drink. Just the right amount of bitterness and doesn't clash with the roasty flavor of the beer making it astringent. It drinks like a black IPA. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Let the battle begin, the roasted malts wrestle with the piney, resinous hops for control over the tongue. Very interesting alternative to the style. Full-bodied and delicious, I didn't expect to want this beer again."
"O: Wow, very interesting beer. The pine and resin is incredible, even mixed into a pretty strong stout. This level of hoppiness in an IPA would probably melt my teeth. It's not bad at all, in fact it's quite good. Just be prepared for the onslaught that you can't possibly expect."
""
""
""
""
"O - Interesting beer. The name 'Beer Hop Breakfast' does not lie. Very hoppy. The GF thought it was too hoppy/bitter and she loves a hoppy IPA. The hop bitterness was balanced with a nice coffee/smokey/spicy malt backbone. This beer is definitely worth a try."
"Poured into an impy nonic pitch black,no light showing thru this,a fluffy mocha colored crown atop that left broken chunks of lace behind as it setteled slowly into a frothy mass.Big hop resin mixed molasses sweetness just awesome,this is truly a hybrid of stout and ABA.Chocolate malts and tobacco flavors mixed with a healthy shot of pine resin on the palate,some molasses-like sweetness comes into play but doesn't intrued on the resiny hops.I have the hop burps wich makes me like this beer even more,a great example of the style,one of the best I have had."
""
""

"Overall, I really enjoyed this unique beer. There were a lot of elements present that I would expect from an oatmeal stout, but lots of hoppy IPA character as well, and it was all blended very smoothly together. Definitely will seek this one out again."
"O - an awesome beer from.one of my favorite brewers!!! Love the choice of hops used in this one.... I really love the way the favors intermingle."

"O: If I close my eyes, I'm drinking a 3F Black Sun but with bigger oat stout flavor. This beer melds hop and oat/malt/coffee while still showcasing the hops up front and letting the classic oat stout shine through on the end. Mikkeller, imo, is either an out of the park dinger or a monumental bust for which I feel I have paid too much, usually the former rather than the latter. This one knocks it out of the park."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma and the taste. If you closed your eyes you may be tricked into thinking this is a straight IPA, but when you open your eyes up and dig deeper you discover a vast depth to the malt profile. The hops, too, are bright and bold, and mix nicely with the equally as stark grain bill. The smokiness puts this brew over the top, and helps make this a standup example of the style."

"O - Extremely enjoyable. For such a big beer it is very approachable and easy to drink. Booze is subtle, and bitterness is balanced. superb."
"Taste, again, more like Beer Geek Breakfast, this is a very minor and subtle variation frankly, but that's not all bad since the base beer is quite good. Same beer, more hops. That's really about it. Loads of chocolate malt, coffee, ashy bitterness."
"Pours a dark brown/black color with a deep tan mocha head. Rings and patches of lace go down the glass. Aromas of coffee, herbal hops, roasted malts and chocolate. In the taste, decadant malt body, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, all savory flavors. Hop bitterness is substantial and coarse, piney, leafy, and resinous. Oatmeal lends to the smoothness of this beer, and its creamyness. Overall, the Beer Hop Breakfast is a delicious oatmeal stout with plenty of hops, as advertised. Complex and easy to drink, I'd suggest giving it a try."
"O: Quite enjoyable but I like the original better. I’m a hop head, but when I want a stout I don’t necessarily want it to be hoppy, but that’s just personal taste. This perfectly matches what the brewer was trying to accomplish though (a hopped up stout), so I say this beer is a win."

"O - Hop head and coffee fans might love it, I feel its lacking in body and complexity. I expect more from Mikkeller, but Mikkel is still my favorite brewer. Lastly, I could smell this all day!"

"Gotta say, I like Beer Geek Breakfast more, but this one isnt bad by any means."
"Bottle 500 ml. Color back with small brown head. Aroma hop and only hop at first after some time you can smell some espresso. Taste coffee but so much coffee that dominates everything else, some hop, light chocolate. Strange beer a little unbalanced but i like it."
"This is my first Mikkeller and it was simply fantastic in all aspects."
"Cheers..."
"Dr: Very drinkable for the high ABV and for the style. The price is high but it's well worth it for the quality."
"pour was a nice dark brown, nearly black in color with a nice head of off white, tan color on top that really just showed how nicely this one was put together. a wonderful aroma of thick coffee and crisp piney hops then came up and cleared the air, really making its presence known. huge aroma with warming bringing caramel and brown sugar to the front and smooth lightly bitter coffee balancing it out. nice smooth hop presence with a rich malty back bone that was beyond smooth. really just wonderfully done."
"O: Probably my favorite beer that I have experienced so far. Everything about this was wonderful from start to finish and it is such a disappointment to see that beautiful tan residue on the glass where an outstanding beer once was. If you see this beer anywhere for any price BUY IT! You will not be let down!"
"M - Medium body, light carbonation."
"Pours near black with a long-lasting deep tan head. Strong lacing and a heavy roast and chocolate character in the nose. Good dosing of pine and faint earth. Heavy pine, especially as it warms. Good balance between the pine and roast in the flavor. Medium body with a dry, resinous finish. Fairly bitter, mostly from the hops. Really quite tasty."
"The beer is dark brown, with a thin beige cap. The appearance bears an uncanny resemblance to the other Beer Geek stouts. Surprisingly good aroma, exceeding my expectations. Terrific blend of hops and dark roast. This taste much more like an American black ale (black IPA) than a stout. Really well balanced and full of flavor. A wonderful marriage of roast and hops. I highly recommend this beer."
"mouthfeel - weak body. great carbonation. oatmeal stouts need to be thicker than this and creamier. neither one is there whatsoever."
"O - My hats off to Mikkeller on this one. Stout/IPA rolled into one. The best of both worlds. Starts out like a creamy oatmeal stout and finishes with that bitter, dry IPA finish. Well done."
"This is one of the more interesting stouts I've had. It has all of the better qualities of a stout with the exception of the overly bitter aftertaste, and adds to that a hoppy undertone. It may have an effect on the hops, but aging this might improve it some."
"I like the interplay of hops and stout in the flavor, loads of roasted dark malts in the front and a decidedly citrusy hops flavor in the rear. No negative bitterness, and not really sweet either (making this much tastier than Darkness or Nightstalker). The carbonation is on the low side, which I like just fine. Very nice, a great addition to the line-up."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Medium bodied with extremely fine carbonation. Very smooth drinking, comes close to creamy. Probably the best aspect of the beer. Overall, a good stout by Mikkeller. One of the better ones I've had."
"O - a fantastic incorporation of hops in a big heavy stout, well worth a try and maybe even a second purchase"
"Pours jet black with a chocolate brown head. In the aroma, a sweet roast and pine hops. In the taste, pine hops and a small sweet and roasty oatmeal. A hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mothfeel, with a dryer small hop and small roast in the aftertaste. Big hops and small oatmeal and roast notes. It doesn't feel like a stout, but it is tasty!"
"O - I would certainly buy it again and recommend it to others. Not sold on it's breakfast beer quality since I'm use to Founders Breakfast stout for that, though with the huge addition of hops you could sub out your morning orange juice I suppose."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a creamy smooth texture yet oily and clingy as well. It boasts a modest amount of carbonation. It is decently drinkable but very oily and overly bitter from the combination of hops and roasted grain. I throughly enjoy stouts but really dislike when they are over hopped like this. No matter how much I try to like them, I just cant get into it. If american black ales are your thing, this is a must try but for $14 a 500ml bottle, they can keep it in my opinion."
"O: The flavor on this beer is really quite something. The way that the hops is assimilated into the chocolate dessert is special. However, I think that's the most special thing about this beer. It's so much better than the mouthfeel, which doesn't connote creaminess in the same way the flavor pulls butter out of the hop resins. I think that is a really hard thing to overcome in beer, as it requires a less dry mouth-feel. The gap in the longevity of mouth-feel, which allows the alcohol to creep in over the flavor to contaminate the subtle theme of buttery chocolate creaminess. Eventually the hops takeover to reclaim the flavor in favor of coffees. However, that temporary hole in the transition of flavor is a bit irritating, and generally disrupted a pleasantly surprising flavor experience. Otherwise, this is really something to try."
"O: One thing I will say immediately about this beer as it's best to enjoy it and try it at varying temperatures, as it really does change an unusual amount as it warms up. This is an excellent single oatmeal stout with some unusual characteristics and a lot of well developed parts. Sadly, though, no eurekas in this like you might hope for from the occassional mikkeller stroke of genius. There are probably cheaper oatmeal stout alternatives on a similar level available to an american craft brew drinker. Also, while this is good, I think it's not quite as strong as mikkellers other breakfast/brunch offerings. If you're curious and have the extra cash, nothing wrong with picking this up, but this is not a 'must' for anyone interested in mikkeller or a good oatmeal stout."
"O: This is a really well put together Stout with just enough hop character to balance out the rich thick malt flavors. One of my favorite Mikkeller offerings."
"Poured reddish black color with an average frothy brown head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Solid roasted coffee and chocolate malt and earthy hop aroma. Medium to full body with a dry smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy roasted balanced coffee and chocolate flavor with a heavy chocolate bittersweet finish of long duration. This is a standout beer."
"Man, the hops really mingle nicely with this coffee stout. Would classify well as a Black IPA. Yet another tasty offering in the Beer Geek series and I’m glad to have had the chance to try (even if it was overpriced, even for a Mikkeller offering)."
"Beer geek breakfast is still the best of the series."
"Poured into stone RIS glass, pours a nice dark black with a large one finger head. I enjoyed the smell on this one, classic smell of the base beer with a small but noticeable herbal hop characteristic at the end. The taste was a little disappointing to me as the hop flavor strong notes of coffee and chocolate were there but, the hop characteristic did not come through that much, slight citrus Finnish, bitter aftertaste was really all that I picked up as far as the hops go.With the smell I thought a lot more would come through in the taste. The was a medium to full body beer, still has the creamy tongue feel that the rest of the series has, nice bitter tingle left at the end. Not bad overall, mostly carried because of the base beer, not a bad twist but I am a huge fan of hoppy stouts and while still a good beer, didn't live up to what I was hoping for"
"O- Love Mikkeller, helps that we're getting more of this stuff distributed up here. A nice twist on an already good beer."
"Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and just really creamy. Alcohol isn't a factor at all. If I can find it I will buy it again."
"Huge notes of pine fill the air, along with roasted notes, slight coffee and chocolate. Poured black, with a big 3 finger mocha head, dissipated to a spongy film, leaving sticky, spongy lacing all the way down. The big pine notes are lot more balanced in the taste. Though bold, they meld nicely with big chocolate and coffee notes. The coffee bitterness blends well with the hop bitterness. The feel is nice and creamy, solid medium bodied, even a tad chewy. Nice bit of substance for the style. Overall, I’m in love. I adore hoppy stouts, and this is a shining example. Kudos Mikkel."
"O: usually i don't mind the smell of simcoe, it is the taste that annoys the crap out of me. here, it has been used well all around. wow i'm in love with this beer. a perma-want. whatever coffee they've used lent itself brilliantly and really tied things together. overall, this seemed like just an ok stout, but then it was nicely hopped, and superbly coffee'd. idk what kind, but i'd love to try a brew of the beans - they seemed kona quality."
"o - I feel like this is what Nighstalker should have been, but couldn't do. I didn't feel like Nightstalker worked and I didn't really enjoy that one, whereas this one was a pretty good hoppy stout. I prefer the normal Beer Geek Breakfast to this, but it was still good and fun to try. Would have it again."
"Be in the mood for an IPA when you open this or you may not like your first impression. Very interesting brew. Be sure to let it warm a tad for max enjoyment."
"Another nice installment from Mikkeller in the beer geek series with some fresh green hops adding some complexity to things. I still like the original better though..."
"This one has certainly earned the name ""Beer Hop Breakfast"". The hops are very intense here, if only the breakfast qualities were pushed more."
"OVERALL: An excellent brew. I wasn’t sure what to expect of this one, but it certainly worked out great. The coffee was very present, but it didn’t overwhelm the brew. The malt base still played a roll and the hops were the star of the show, especially after the swallow. One I would recommend to anyone who’s looking for a stout with a little something going on. Thanks Doopie!"
"O- I think this is what Mikkeller was going for with Koppi. Has the coffee characteristics, along with the IPA characteristics. If anything, I'd like more stout flavor. But it's a damn solid brew from Mikkeller, as usual"
"An excellent, dark and thick, rich black chocolate color with a medium tan head that fades fast but leaves pretty sea foam lace. The smell is of dark chocolate, coffee, and a touch of citrus and pine. The taste is complex, full, rich and full of robust coffee, roasted malt, and dark chocolate. Notes of caramel, nuts, and citrus/pine making an appearance. I'm not sure how well the citrus flavors melt together with the roasted flavors. Not that well balanced for a stout in my opinion. A bit on the bitter side and chalky on the mouthfeel. Could use more sweet caramel notes and a creamier mouthfeel. Excellent beer overall, but had holes for critique."
"I was surprised and pleased to find this bottle of Beer Hop Breakfast. I hadn’t heard of it before. It’s a nice addition to their lineup. I’m a fan of hoppy stouts. The hop presence is very strong. The coffee/espresso/burnt flavors are as well. All in all, this is a very intense flavored beer. I’m enjoying it, and have no reservation recommending it."
"D - really liked this one front to back. great dessert beer and might be even better for breakfast. only downside is the pricetag ($11.99). as far as coffee stouts go, this can hold up to the best of them."
"I like this a lot. It would wake me up a lot faster than the other Beer Geek beers if I actually drank it for breakfast, but there is no way I'd have beer this complex that early in the day. Great variation on an already great beer series."
"O: delicious, and definitely improves as it warms. I don't like hoppy beers, but this is great. Another awesome brew from Mikkeller!"
"O: Very interesting cornucopia of flavors that put an all-out assault on the senses. As I got used to the beer, I found it more drinkable. Disguise any alcohol very well."
"It is a mouthful. It's alright, medium-bodied, a lot to like or dislike, but there certainly is a lot of flavor. Cool experiment. I'd maybe tone down the bitterness a bit more. Not sure what else I'd do. Fun and beastly."
"O - This is an awesome, hoppy stout. Probably my favorite offering so far from Mikkeller."
"Second bottle thanks to Jon. Big hops like a Black IPA but not Cascadian."
"Pours a completely opaque pitch black. Light brown head with some big bubbles around the edges. Nose starts with some big hop notes, pine and pineapple at the forefront. Coffee and espresso make themselves visible closer to the end of the sensation. A general creaminess/sweetness as well. Taste is all espresso and hops with great interplay between the two, each sip alternates between these flavours and works wonders. Great full bodied feel to it. Glad I got the chance to share this."
"Truly a strange creation here. I'm very glad I tried it, but I can't imagine I'll ever buy this again."
"This beer is deceptive all around. I thought it smelled well balance between the coffee and the hops. Turns out their is a lot of hop flavor that really competes with the coffee. The beer didn't form a big head yet there was a decent amount of carbonation. Then its dark and the overall mouth feel is medium bodied. Tricky Tricky Mikkeller! Overall this is a really good brew. I loved every sip. While this is not my favorite beer geek but still better than most other coffee beers out there. Pick one up and feel free to drink it anytime; kind of like how breakfast can be eaten at any time."
"O – The medium body and hop character are more akin to some of the black IPAs floating around than a hop-stout, but in that regard I’d rate it as one of the best black IPA’s I’ve ever had. Overall a well executed play on the style."
"I'd say grab all four in the line if you can. Having them together is a treat. The way each of these beers distinguish themselves is remarkable, and each has a unique offering. Personally I'd put the beer hop breakfast second in the lineup, just short of the brunch weasel."
"O - A definite winner from Mikkeller with a great flavoured offering. I would certainly drink this stuff for breakfast, it IS the most important meal of the day!"
"D- an interesting stout. Not had an American version yet and this was enjoyable. Not overly hopped with roasted malts notes working well with a subtle coffee hint."
"Overall - Interesting style/flavor profile. Nice to try once but definitely prefer the regular Beer Geek Breakfast."
"Another good breakfast stout from Mikkeller. Nice coffee flavor but too bitter for me to love this beer."
"O- I enjoyed this beer thoroughly and plan on on going to buy another"
"Now this is a great Mikkeller beer. As good or better than Beer Geek Breakfast."
"i would buy this one again and again"
"stick to the regular Beer Geek Breakfast if you have never tried Mr Mikkeller's stout before."
"What we have here, is a failure to, um, well, a failure to differentiate between a silky oatmeal coffee stout and the American IPA-ization of such. Bully for me - I likes 'em both just fine."
"Bottle poured into Matilda glass. Pours thick black with small mocha head that fades to a collar. Very nice lacing. Smell is average, lots of slightly stale coffee, some noble hops, a touch of roasted malts. Taste is a lot better then the smell but nothing special. Coffee, bakers chocolate, hop bitterness that carries no other hop characteristics, some earthy hops and roasted malts as it warms. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side and to active of a carbonation. Not as silky as I would expect from an oatmeal stout. Overall a decent beer, but not worth the hefty price tag, but I suppose it delivers what it advertises - hoppy coffee stout."
"Overall: I'm not in love with this beer. The roast and the hops seem to be fighting for my attention. I prefer the less hoppy versions of the Mikkeller breakfast stout."
"overall - hoppy stout and porters are the new ""it"" beers - that said there are many other breweries doing better interpretations"
"O: The beer is interesting in that it somewhat tastes like a hybrid between a stout and an IPA, although the stout properties are much more prevalent."
"o - Overall, this is the weakest in the beer breakfast series in my opinion. I was really hoping for a hoppy stout a la Darkness, but instead the hops serve mostly to bitter and dry out an otherwise nice stout. Looks amazing, but a bit of a let down from there. You are way better off going for a beer geek breakfast or a beer geek brunch weasel. I am, however, excited to see more of these beers showing up on shelves and I will continue to try as many as I can."
"This is a killer example of the style at hand. The hops weren't as strong as I thought (going by the title, which I thought meant a ton of hops) but it did not take away from the overall taste. I highly recommend this as a replacement for your morning cup 'o joe!"
"Not overly complex, but it still works for me. This time around the contrast of what's going on is poetic in how beautifully it all works together, this is a fantastic hoppy stout, that not only does justice to the style, but is an exemplar of how to do it properly."
"This is really good, it's thick it's hoppy as hell. Really great pour an color. The aroma smells of big time hops, chocolate, malts and some burnt aromas too. The beer is silky smooth and oily. The aftertaste is of oats and toast. This beer reminds me of a really strong Black IPA. I highly enjoy the combination of hops and imperial stout."
"D: An interesting beer, though it might not please everyone who likes a classic stout. Still, it's very drinkable."
"D- this one is just as the bottle promises: a very hoppy stout. it loses some of the smoothness that comes with being an oatmeal stout, but its still an enjoyable beer. not sure that i could have any more than one, 500ml is perfect."
"an interesting mix of a big stout with a hop bomb, this ones worth looking for try it if you get the chance"
"O: A killer hoppy stout. The batch that just hit Chicago is super fresh and I'm thinking I just might go back to buy another."
"M - Nice, well rounded."
"This is friggin awesome if you like big, American-style Imperial Stouts packed with bitter hops. Really well done!"
"drinkability is great. good balance between the bitterness and alcohol, but with just buckets of hop character on top. great depth to the hop character. wow, odd to find a stout that is such an ode to the hop, but it is damn good stuff."
"D: An interesting beer. Value for money isn't great, and sessionability is low due to the bitterness. As a stout man, I would have it again, though, so that's worth something."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with red highlights and a tan head. The aroma is great. I get a lot of caramel and roasted malt with some pine and citrus hops. The flavor is roasted/burnt malt, coffee and chocolate, but I also get a lot of bitter pine and orange notes. The alcohol is completely hidden. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice hoppy stout."
"This brew pours a dark cola hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a coffee laced two finger frothy head and some sporadic lacing,the aromas are fruity hops mixed with dark coccoa and coffee,it has a rather lucious mouthfeel which is well carbonated and coats the mouth with flavours of coffee,dark coccoa,mocha and finishes with a fruity,hoppy kick and for me i love this brew its definately an interesting combination but Mikkeller pulls it off well as i like my Oatmeal stouts and really hoppy brews so this is a beautiful combination of both and i highly recommend and obviously i will revisit this brew as much as possible absolutely love it."
"I like the original beer geek breakfast but the bitterness from the coffee doesn't play well with the hops. It just gets overwhelming. Had problems finishing 1/2 bottle."
"Smells fantastic IMO, cedary, floral, and some grapefruity hoppiness over some chocolatey maltiness. Bits of roastedness pop through the aroma and then down to some resiny hops. Lovely stuff. Taste follows along the same lines, but the hops and chocolate tones don't come together as well as in the aroma. Interesting interplay, but the roasted qualities get lost a little. Still nice stuff. Medium to thinner MF (about the same as a regular Beergeek Breakfast) with some softer carbonation. A sipping brew, but not due to the weight. Interesting brew that could almost as easily be classified as a Black IPA in some ways (at least when fresh)."
