Aroma is dark chocolate, coco,  roasted malt, toffee & a hint of roasted nuts. Taste is Tootsie Roll & bittersweet chocolate, roast, pepper & a little char or smoke. Finishes dry with a kick of peppery spice. Aftertaste is dry & drawing, lightly bitter coco, toffee & roast nuts with a hint of char. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, creamy but prickly, a little chewy, dry & drawing.","mothmanscott","Mar 02, 2015"

Aroma is sweet malt, caramel and coffee, not really chocolatey like many of these chocolate stouts are. Flavor is mild and semi-sweet, much like a good, easy drinking brewpub American style stout. Mild hop bitterness, with sweetness relying on roasted grains for balance. Mouthfeel is smooth and on light side for style. Overall, a stout that I really like, although it looks rather limp and the smell is not strong and chocolaty as I would prefer.","EagleTalon","Oct 21, 2013"

3.91,13.7,3.75,4,4,3.25,4,"Fort Collins Chocolate Stout pours a midnight black hue, with only a thin ring of tan foam sitting on top. The aroma is fantastic, giving of scents of coffee, creamy milk chocolate, a slight smokiness, and a hint of citrus esters as well. The flavor is pretty nice , with a fair balance of the creamy chocolate and coffee, and the aforementioned smoked and hoppy characteristics. Not overly complex but that's perfectly alright. Very soft feel and a thin finish unfortunately. Overall though, it's pretty flavorful for a low ABV Stout.","Neorebel","Aug 21, 2013"

While the appearance was very dark and heavy, the mouth feel was smooth and light. I could definitely smell and taste the chocolate (heavy). But it was pretty carbonated for a chocolate stout. I would recommend this to someone who is trying to break into the chocolate stout world as it probably would be a brew that isn't too heavy for the newbie.","Roland45s","Jul 03, 2013"

This beer was called a Chocolate Stout, but I don't think there was enough chocolate presence to make this stick out from just a regular American Stout. This beer went down smooth but the flavor didn't really hold my interest so I don't think I would want another one. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it looked pretty proper for an American Stout. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of chocolate taste and the watery mouthfeel, if those were fixed this beer wouldn't be half bad. I wouldn't buy this beer again and wouldn't recommend it, their are much better Chocolate Stouts to be found. This beer really didn't do it for me and it didn't make for a good first impression for this brewery, I would like to have a couple more beers from them before I fully form an opinion on this brewery, but after having this beer I won't be in a hurry to try their other beers, hopefully they are better then this one, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Feb 21, 2012"

The lacing was thick and sticky and I was licking my moustache like the flavor saver it had become. The taste was of liquid dark chocolate, no sweet nonsense here. Man, this was cacao being ladled out by one of Montazuma's girls and I was lapping it up like it was going out of style! Finish left me spent and sleepy. Hey, who's going to clean up that mess?!?

Tastes of burnt chocolate, roasted malt bitterness, and maybe a touch of oatmeal. Definitely a lot of chalky semi-sweet chocolate in here. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly dry, very sessionable. This really does remind me more of an oatmeal stout, with a nice sort of hearty creaminess in the body. A good beer in my opinion for those times when you just want to try something new.

Foamy, broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and slight cocoa powder/chocolate aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, burnt coffee, and a subdued bitter chocolate flavor. For being a chocolate stout, there is much more of a coffee flavor in this one. A lower level of carbonation makes for a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good stout but like I said, this is very light on the chocolate with more emphasis on coffee smells and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 20, 2011"

I don't like a lot of sweetness is my chocolate stouts and this is about right for my taste, maybe a little under sweet for some. Mouthfeel was too thin and watery for me.

The smell was chocolate-y with some ground coffee notes. Taste wasn't as robust as I had hoped.

The nose is cocoa, coffee, and roasted malts, with a subtle hint of hoppy pine in a background corner. The taste generally follows very closely, but the cocoa is a bit chalkier on the tongue and definitely more bitter, and there's a lack of expected sweetness, leaving a very dry taste instead.

The taste starts out slightly sweet with caramel and semi-sweet chocolate and transitions to the roasty, slightly acrid and mildly bitter finish.

There's a nice malt base here, but it seems weak and somewhat watered down for a stout. Mouthfeel is thin as well, and overly carbonated for the style. Not nearly as "velvety smooth" as the label indicates. Low ABV makes it easy to have more than one.

The smell is of roasted malts, with perhaps a hint of chocolate aroma. The taste is simple yet flavorful. As with the smell, there is a somewhat roasted chocolate sweetness upfront with slight bittering for balance. A nice dry finish. For an American stout, and a break from the higher A.B.V .stouts out there, this is certainly worthy of giving a go taste. Enjoy!!!","BadBadger","Feb 16, 2008"

Mouth was , well, it formed on the top of the mouth and went down as such with a bitter aftertaste not from the flavor. The sweetness made this seem like swallowing a candy more than a beer. Taste was about Saranac average. Like I've had this stout combo many times, usually in the cheaper types and this was that again. The Chocolate was artifical and sweet and the rounding from the hops did little to help. There was a hole in the finish, leaving sweet and bitter to do battle. There are better Chocolate stouts out there that do the style with more balance and less candy. Okay at best if you like really sweet beers.","Ricochet","Jan 27, 2008"

This brew poured from the bottle to a very dark brown color, hedging on black with a smallish lighter tan head. The retention was pretty good though and left some nice lacing at the upper sections of the glass. The aromas are pretty good, with some roasted and chocolate scents coming to mind from the start. I say that it is pretty good as I would have expected a little more robustness but all being said it is not making me turn away. The taste is also pretty solid, chocolate and roasted malt flavors seem to be the dominant flavors but in a way that it seems light. The feel of the brew is quite smooth as no flavors come across as being harsh.

The taste is a simple, yet pronounced combination of roasted malt and dark chocolate flavor. Nothing too complex about the taste, and not as chocolately as expected judging from the name, but still a tasty stout. The mouthfeel was very impressive IMO. Extremely smooth mouthfeel for a stout. Light bitterness allowing for a clean easy swallow. This is a highly drinkable and very sessionable stout. Full flavor and low abv. make for an ideal session stout. Overall, not a bad stout.

It goes downhill from here, as after first sip I can only think of the wierd smokiness that is totally out of place. I did initially sense a bit of chocolate, coffee and roasted malts, but it's completely gone with subsequent sips due to the overwhelming smokiness. This would work well for a smoked stout or even porter. Mouthfeel is medium to thinner bodied with a carbonation level that might be slightly higher than it needs to be. The smoky flavor does not entirely turn me off to this beer, but it seems horribly out-of-place when the label says that what I'm consuming is supposed to be a chocolate stout.

All too often the chocolate is overdone in these kinds of beers, making a big splash at the outset, but then hurting drinkability in the end. That's not the case here. This is more of a stout infused with chocolate, as the stout character remains completely intact, hops and all. The chocolate just gives it a little bit of extra character across the middle, and a bump of sweet chocolate at the swallow. It lingers pleasantly in the finish, and then fades fairly quickly, leaving behind a mild, roasty bitterness. It's very nicely done! Very well balanced.

Intensity is haulted once the beer is tasted but the malt flavor is still very complex and well balanced. Roasted and chocolate malts combine with a nice dry, cocoa feel and a touch of burnt dark fruits on the finish. Fairly good, but not great.","Crosling","Mar 15, 2006"
3.73,8.4,4.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Dark chocolatey black with a dense, soft cushiony head of cocoa brown. Nice retention. Nose is full of rich, sweet chocolate. Chocolate milk and even some bitter dark chocolate are there. Roasted, peaty malts as well. Roasted and toasted flavors up front. Soon turns chocolate milk sweet with a solid roasted bitterness background. Finish is more reminiscent of dark chocolate. Medium-bodied stout with perhaps a bit too much carbonation. Solid, but not great.","alexgash","Mar 13, 2006"

It has a nice roasted, chocolate, and crystal malt scent that is sweet as well as dry and earthy. The taste is decent. It has an earthy chocolate and roasted malt flavor that goes down easy, but finishes slightly sweet and dry in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good brew, but not their best for sure. I think Rogue has the market for this style. I definately prefer sweet to dry and earthy.","WesWes","Beers"

3.64,5.8,3,4,4,3,3,"Re-reviewed 2/11/12-Newly available to our area. $16.99 for a mixed 12pack sampler. Calling a beer a chocolate stout when it contains no chocolate is called a cheap marketing gimmick. I stand by my original review. This is a flimsy stout, more of a porter. It's a bit too acidic and minerally, herbal hops, flimsy body, burnt finish. I have to add, now that it is available in our area, I'm not inclined to buy it again. There are much better porters (and stouts, for that matter) for the same price-point, and it doesn't taste at all like Bells Porter or what it used to be. Hrmmm.","Mitchster","Nov 29, 2005"

Roasted malt flavor, but I don't detect any chocolate. More smokiness. Slightly astringent. Some hops in the finish. Medium mouthfeel. Decent drinkability. I was hoping there would be more chocolate in the flavor, but this is a decent beer anyway. The smokiness sort of works.","beveragecaptain","Nov 12, 2005"

3.76,9.3,3,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a standard stout black with a disappointing total lack of head, a few tan wisps of foam are all there is to see here. Smell is actually quite nice - rich chocolate and coffee malt aromas with an underlying hop presence. Taste is another let down after the promising nose - some bitter burnt coffee, and a substantial hop bite. Quite a bit hoppier than I would have guessed, and hoppier than I like in a stout, let alone a chocolate stout. Mouthfeel is enjoyably carbonated and smooth. This is by no means a bad stout, but disappointing as chocolate stout. Worth a try if you like a hoppier stout though, just not sweet or matly enough for my tastes.","Golden2wenty1","Mar 28, 2005"
3.96,15.1,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"First sip reveals a very silky smooth body with fine gentle carbonation. Flavor is deep chocolate sweetness and some roasted malt on the finish.

Not quite as thick as I would expect though.","sulldaddy","Mar 23, 2005"

Initial taste is sweet, but finishes with a semi-sweet chocolate that is interesting. Just enough hops to keep this stout from being cloyingly chocolaty. Finish is nicely dry, leaving a whole wheat bread aftertaste. Carbonation is gentle, just right. Body is slightly thick, but goes down easy. A good comparison would be with the standard: Youngs Double Chocolate Stout  with which Ft. Collins offering compares favorably.","palliko","Nov 24, 2004"

Nice fruit compote aroma, like a dried fruit wreath; dried pit fruits with the stems and pits and all. Holy shit, tastes like cocoa straight up. A dry hop vapor fills the mouth; dads burnt biscuits. The carbonation turns the malt from any fruitiness to melted bakers chocolate. A caramelized fruit quickly burns up in a smokey malt fire cloud, poof its gone.","gbontrag","0"
