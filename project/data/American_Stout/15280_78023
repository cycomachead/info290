5,35.9,5,5,5,5,5,"My personal favorite from Atwater.  Very silky smooth feel because of the low carbonation.  Sweet dark chocolate aromas make the mouth water!  Great taste from start to finish.  Your typical sweet, not bitter, dark chocolate taste turns almost into a root beer-ish middle, and finishes smooth with more cocoa tastes.  Wonderful beer from a wonderful town.","dthrift3","Apr 01, 2015"

I like the subtle bubble, almost like soda, but not too much carbonation so it's still smooth and not airy. The aroma of dark chocolate is stronger than the flavor (unfortunately), and the after taste is a bit bitter, which takes away from upcoming sips, so the first swallow is the best. I would enjoy this beer as a snack or dessert rather than with a meal because it is so delicious on its own merit. It's bright enough that you can drink several and not get tired or overwhelmed by its sweetness. Atwater Brewery can claim a degree of pride despite the low reputation of Detroit. My only other suggestion is a slightly higher alcoholic content. If you're looking to enjoy such a wealth of flavor and texture, you might as well get a buzz while you're at it. :)","MECove","Jan 22, 2014"

There's a slight malt character, with a the barest hint of the chocolate that was so "decadent" in the smell, and after that... nothing. It literally tastes like a watered down version of itself, or what I expected based on the intoxicating smell. Just bland, slightly sour, not decadent in the slightest. The mouth feel is similarly poor, just thin and weakly carbonated with no body. It really feels like drinking a Killian's or Bud that had slight chocolate flavor added. As it warms, instead of the flavor opening up, it just gets bland and kind of gross. I'd drink this over something like PBR but what's the point? If not for the delicious aroma, this beer would be a total waste of money. When you consider that a four pack of this costs the same as Founders Breakfast Stout or some of the excellent New Holland High Gravity Series (here in Michigan at least) there is absolutely no reason to buy this.","krustster","Nov 18, 2013"

3.74,1.6,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,3.5,"Dark cola hue nearly black with ruby highlights, thin tan head texture seems a bit flimsy for a big chocolate stout. Aroma is sick with chocolate syrup, perfume laden caramelized sugars, with a hint of roasted coffee. It could induce diabetes just by smelling it, but seriously the perceived sweetness on the nose if off the charts think Hershey syrup. Flavor how does that sweetness the nose derives to the senses play out on the palate? Actually somewhat balanced think dry cocoa powder in a very much bitter dark roasted base stout, enough creamy bitterness with a bit of lactose and coffee roasts pleasantly blends the flavor into something much more enjoyable than the initial aromatics. Expansive creamy dark chocolate fades away to let the lactose milk sugars take stride, leaving a bit of an interesting creamy texture to the medium to full bodied stout. Carbonation level is natural and smooth on the palate finishes pretty clean with minimal acrid notes of acidity from the dark notes. Overall a complex stout that I was thinking was going to be a train wreck, ended up being pretty much a win in my book. Only 2.50 for a single definitely worth the experience but in truth I'm glad I didn't invest any more, it doesn't seem to be the type of beer that I would drink in number.","WVbeergeek","Sep 13, 2013"

While the liquid is pure black it doesn’t seem “impenetrably dense” for effect’s sake, thin aura of yellow around the rims, there you can see a blip of carbonation. The nose is extremely creamy, maple syrup, molten milk chocolate, caramel, coffee ice cream, malted milk balls, light cherry fruit, not overtly sugary nor is it lacking posture, simply a one trick pony. It’s light to medium-bodied in the mouth and drier than expected based on the nose, tighter punch to the carbonation too. The chocolate, cocoa, coffee, malt flavors are all there, however, they lack resonance and depth. More grains and oats and a dried to blanched nuttiness as well. Here there’s some herbal hoppy kick. Any fruit gets cloaked by the roast, minor cherry, plum at best. Tacky character, dries onto your tongue. Plenty of retronasal cocoa powder.

3.3,-10.3,4,4,3,2,3.5,"I got a cap of a finger of dense, deep-tan head with good retention from my pour. Color was a deep, dark-brown allowing zero light penetration. Nose smelled like a liquid chocolate bar. I have to admit that I have been underwhelmed by some previous Atwater offerings, but this was showing real promise. Mouthfeel was thin, especially for a stout, but the taste was very chocolaty, although not what I would have expected from dark chocolate. Were they referring to the color? Hmmm. It was quite sweet, but still very chocolaty. Finish remained very sweet and this would be a dessert beer for me. Not bad, but not great, either.","woodychandler","Dec 10, 2012"

Aroma was a very rich milk chocolate, slightly over sweet. Taste was a sweet chocolate up front before shifting to a slightly smokey flavor with a bit of bitterness. Felt ok in the mouth. A bit of chew, slightly thick, coated well, but no carbonation at all. Overall not bad, but a few notches short of what it could be.","mountdew1","Oct 04, 2012"

3.1,-15.8,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Overall I thought this was an ok and an average example of a Chocolate Stout, it was going in the right direction when it came to the aroma but when it came to the taste is felt like a watered down version of the aroma and that was a bit of let down. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down pretty smooth, but the flavors would wear on me quickly so I think one would be enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it was nice and dominated by chocolate syrup, the appearance was also wasn't that bad. What I liked least about this beer is how watery it tasted and felt, this beer would be much better if the body was much thicker. I don't think I would buy this beer often, I would much rather have their Vanilla Java Porter, but it is worth trying once to see where you stand with it. All in all I thought this beer had a flavor that's pretty similar to Vanilla Java Porter, but the aroma was dominated by chocolate syrup, it was ok, but it's nothing I feel the need to drink again anytime soon. This was a decent attempt by Atwater but when it came to flavor and mouthfeel it fell short, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Aug 28, 2012"

3.7,0.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled January 2012. Pours slightly hazy dark brown color with a small 1 finger light tan head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, vanilla, cream, and a touch of herbal hops. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, caramel, toffee, biscuit, and herbal hops. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of roasted malt, caramel, toffee, vanilla, chocolate, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Not as much chocolate in the taste as I was hoping, but there is a good flavor balance. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish present. Overall this is a nice, pleasant, and enjoyable brew from Atwater. Very smooth and drinkable as well.","superspak","Mar 21, 2012"
