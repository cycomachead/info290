Its almost like a chocolate liqueur but much better. Coffee and dark chocolate malt are at the forefront. As the collective entity moves rearward the bitterness from the roasted malt is nicely complemented by subtle hops presence. Deep, rich and very tasty.","BeardedBoffin","Mar 21, 2014"

I don't drink coffee anymore, but this beer has the perfect mixture of coffee flavor and beer qualities. They didn't over-do the ""coffee-ness"" like so many other brewers do when making a coffee beer. I enjoy almost all NG beers, especially their fruit beers.

Flavor is lots of coffee and roasty smokey goodness. Really easy drinking and relatively high carbonation. Dry finish and a bit of bite at the end. Good stuff. A stout you could drink all day, but not sure I would put it in the ""Sweet Stout"" category like it is here. Closer to a porter than to ""sweet.""","BMMillsy","Oct 12, 2013"

Sometimes you get a coffee stout that seems to consist of diner coffee, in this case the coffee is distinguishable and yet smooth with no harsh bitterness, pleasant. Body left a bit to be desired and the nose was a little understated. I recommend drinking this beer as absolutely fresh as possible.

The flavor is a bit of a disappointment after the nice smell - it's pretty one dimensional with coffee and not much else backing it up. Beer isn't overly roasty or sweet and doesn't have much of the chocolate that I got in the nose. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for the style with nice carbonation. Overall, this is an okay coffee stout that is far from bad, but isn't really all that spectacular either. It's simple and very coffee-forward.","starrdogg","Nov 25, 2012"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, coffee, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, cream, and coffee. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Nothing on this one really stood out to me if I'm honest.

The pour is a dark brown color with a rather thin tan colored head. The nose offers up a decent stout aroma with notes of sweet caramel and roasted malts with a slight acidity. Picks up some coffee. There’s some nice roast and nutty qualities to the flavor with the same caramel sweetness. The body is the usual medium (maybe a touch on the thin side) with a moderate level of carbonation. Surprisingly easy to drink but not my style.","CuriousMonk","Apr 18, 2011"

My first new glarus good for what it is but not overly impressed.","Trilogy31","Apr 15, 2011"

Taste is a well rounded dark roast coffee flavour, creamy on the palate. Nove dark malts compliment the cocoa and java notes. A full bodied stout that uses a strong coffee profile for an expected taste profile. One of the better and decent coffee infused stouts ice had.","heebes","Apr 13, 2011"

This one was barely chilled, probably around 55F. Drink this beer on the warm side if you want to taste the coffee. If you can't stand drinking your beer that warm, then you might as well buy something else since you won't taste the coffee anyway.

The smell is the best part of this beer with sweet/burnt sugar and coffee overtones that are so appealing. The taste was more of the same, however for a beer that is less than 6%, I found it a bit harsh on the palate. It seemed a little off balance between the coffee and the malts. I was expecting it to be silky smooth and it was not. I did enjoy this beer, however I would probably lean towards some other coffee stouts especially since this one is not easily accessible for me.","mcgwire756","Feb 12, 2011"

THe taste was good but not a ton of flavor. I would expect more. The mouthfeel hit me as a little light with tons of carbonation. Almost the mouthfeel of a lager or ale. The drinkability of this one is high. I have come to realize I rate the drinkibility on if I can drink a bunch of it, and with this beer I can but I kinda dont want that in my stouts.

It poured black and had a coffee and chocolate smell and taste. I remember that it took me a while to get it down, so I wasn't loving it. It was more bitter than sweet.

The nose comprises soft coffee, roasted malts, and mild chocolate. The taste is mostly a showcase of roasted malts, but then an upsurge of light-ish coffee comes in, bringing with it a touch of vanilla. The finish, though, comes off as slightly stale-tasting.

You can tell that it's beer, but it smells more like a cup of fresh strong coffee or espresso. Strong dark coffe taste at first obviously, but some robust bitter and malty beer flavors mix with the coffee. You don't forget you are drinking beer. After you swallow though, the strong espresso flavor is what stays behind.A lot of coffee beers taste they brewed the beer first and then just mixed it with coffee. This one seemed to take the natural bitter chocolate and coffe flavors of a stout and enhance them with a fresh coffee flavor. Very smooth and fresh tasting beer.

The lacing on this holds tight to the side of the glass. It doesn't slide down. Appearance wise, it is what it is. It's pretty dark, but when held to a light just a little bit gets through. There's a definite coffee and chocolate scent to this. The first sip I took, the only thing I could think is how if there was such a thing as beer flavored hot chocolate, this is what it would taste like. And that, my friends, is a good thing. A great coffee aftertaste kicks in. It's not like strong black coffee, but more like one of those mochas that people pay too much for. Great mouthfeel to it and for a stout this has a pretty high drinkability. I think part of that is because of the great flavor and part of it is due to the relatively low ABV. A great dessert beer. Wish I had another in the fridge.","billyzoom666","Dec 28, 2009"

The smell has some burnt, overroasted coffee, mixed in with just a hint of chocolate and sugar. It has a note of graininess, too, like coffee poured into cereal. I like the coffee smell in this beer, it's a bit surprising and interesting, but not overpowering. The taste comes in with some graininess, a bit of some bittersweet chocolate, then it finishes with a nice coffee flavor delivered on a burst of carbonation. There's a nice caramelly flavor in there, but the coffe starts out a bit subtle, then slowly takes over everything. Nice, though I think it could be a bit sweeter. The body is pretty good - it's not an imperial coffee stout, so I didn't expect it to be too heavy. The carbonation is a little sharp, but it makes the coffe a bit more pronounced. This is an interesting and drinkable beer. I enjoyed my time with it, and it will certainly do if you want a coffee stout. This is worth a shot.","taylorhamrick","Oct 08, 2009"

It reminds me of burnt christmas cookies. Not as highly coffee'd up as I expected the nose to be. The flavor is coffee roast malt and a hint of chocolate. Almost no hop bitterness to be found.

The beer is dark brown with a little auburn at the edges when you put it up to the light. Light tan foam, about 1/2 finger thick with some decent lacing. The dominant aroma is coffee bean but not aggressive like Breakfast Stout (natural benchmark). I can smell some faint chocolate too. The taste is more complicated, but fairly good. Definitely some sweetness from the malts and atouch of bitterness (from coffee?), but the aftertaste has some smoke which wasn't expected. I think the smoke is what makes the beer work for me.

Nice roast character in the back of the tongue. Mild fruit upfront, a mild hop flavor and very little percieved bitterness. The hints of coffee come in the form of burnt sugars and powdered cocoa.

Up front get big roasted/burnt malt flavor with a slight coffee hint, roasted bitterness through the finish. I've had coffee stouts with a much more prominent coffee flavor and this definitely reminds me of their first coffee stout they made, I heard they had changed the recipe, but it tastes similar to me.

Finishes with a mild amount of bitterness on a medium bodied frame. This is a refreshing, very drinkable lighter style of coffee stout. It really showed its best on the warmer side.

Taste at first is a sweet nut like flavor with a hint of caramel. The coffee flavor emerges in the middle, but it's very weak. Aftertaste is a bit of a burnt brown sugar flavor with some roasted barley. Mouthfeel is somewhat light with a fair amount of carbonation.

I get a wonderful mixture of coffee, espresso, chocolate, and roasted malts. I also detect a sweet aroma that appears like vanilla to me. The taste is less than expected compared to the aroma. Coffee taste is good in this one but it seems a bit one-dimensional. Carbonation is good, the mouthfeel is a bit lacking, but I would rate it slightly above average.

Deep black-brown pour, with a silky soap of aged ivory. Flavor is in vein with the aroma, finding a mellow roasted intensity and a lot of sweet char, bourbon oak, barbeque and a nip of dark chocolate. Intergrated and smooth. Somewhat evaporative. Palate dissipates quickly. A rush of flavor quickly becomes a salted oak bite, with a long dry coffee grains smack. Nipped with a little chocolate mint brush. Could use some more density and staying power perhaps, but the palate is crisp and drinkable for the style. Northern Brewer really becomes signature in the smack further down the beer. Nice.","CharlesDarwin","Jul 21, 2007"

4.12,5.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A welcome coffee aroma greets you in the nose of New Glarus' Coffee Stout. Beyond that it's nutty, a touch chocolatey, and roasty with malt. It doesn't really carry over so well in the flavor though. The coffee is there, and it is nicely balanced with the rest of the stout so that it doesn't dominate, or worse, fade away after the first two sips, but it's not quite as rich as one might hope for, and there's a bit of dark malt acidity that can be a bit much at times. The nuttiness is lost, and there are no real noticeable caramel undertones; but some yeasty fruitiness slips in, and it reminds me of a good cup of African Tanzania with some notes of black currant and citrus. Some leafy and grassy hops are present in the background as well, which is appropriate, and the bitterness is right on track with a very firm, but not solid or brash attack as there's so much dark malt acidity and roastiness going on that it's not needed. It finishes really nicely though, and not really acidic or particularly bitter, with a note of sweet dark sugar at the front of the tongue, and a bit of toasted nutiness over soft spent coffee-grounds at the back.

4.42,13.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"12 oz bottle. The beer pours a very deep brown color with a finger of tan head over top. There are nice amber to ruby highlights at the edges and there is a nice cascade of bubbles boiling up to the top. The aroma on this one is unmistakably coffee with a backing of nice roasted malt character that adds a nice edge to it. I really like the aroma on this one. The flavor is definitely on with the nose. It brings coffee and roast immediately, but then moves to a nice chocolate sweetness, finishing with a nice blend of the two as a mocha. Tasty tasty brew. Mouthfeel is on the lighter end of medium with a moderate carbonation. It is not as full as I would like it to be, but it definitely retains drinkability due to the smaller body. This is a beer I can't seem to keep in my glass. It delivers on what it promises in being a coffee stout. I'm a big fan of the lower abv as well, as this keeps me able to session it. This one wins in my book.","kmpitz2","Mar 14, 2007"

3.8,-2.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Many thanks to flyingbison for sending me this ""extra"" in our recent trade. Crazy foam surge results in a somewhat haphazard pour. Once I finally get it all into a nonic, this stout (which from what I understand contains no actual coffee) is a deep, murky chocolate brown with an airy froth, dusty-khaki in color. Soft cocoa notes and an even-keeled dark roasted grain sourness make up most of the aroma. There is a faint nutty coffee scent, too, but it closely resembles the grain aroma and thereby tends to get lost. The taste is solid for a stout. We've got the pleasant controlled sweetness of chocolate and toasted grains, along with a slightly mineral and acidic earthiness. There also is a sturdy bitterness for the first 50-60% of the sip that is indeed reminiscent of coffee, but it lacks the dark and oily roasted character of beers that have really had coffee added. So, coffee is just a name here. Nothing wrong with that. The ""coffee"" flavor is more akin to roasted chicory; more vegetal and earthy-grainy. Grain husk aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel overall, and medium-bodied. A good, sessionable American stout that is unfortunately named.","orfeu","Feb 22, 2007"

2.14,-45.1,2,3,2,1,2,"Darkish brown with a bubbly but short lasting brown head that dissipates to nothing in a less than a minute. Thin looking. Aroma of iron, stale weak coffee, oats and malt. Front is a blast of stale coffee, middle has some weak roasted malts that seem a bit off, finish is metallic and down right nasty. Light bodied and watery. If this had been released in July as some sort of Summertime stout, that would have been one thing but now? When its 35 below (It really was yesterday) I dont want to be drinking a watery stout, especially one that tastes somewhat nasty.","DaPeculierDane","Feb 06, 2007"

2.86,-26.7,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"I was a bit upset with this beer. Compared to other New Glarus brews this one is a dissapointment. It pours dark brown with a good 1/2"" tan head that fades fast, and so does the rest of the experience. Only small hints of coffee were detectable in both the taste and smell, and for a stout it was awfully thin in the mouth. The one redeaming quility was how easily it went down. I will give it this though, it tasted more like coffee than the dark brown water I got at the local filling station the next morning.","zodiacv1","Aug 20, 2004"

3.65,-6.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very dark amber body with a well-laced tan head. Smells nice and stouty: sugary coffee malts, chocolate, and not too strong.

Pretty mild for a stout. Creamy, yet slightly watery body. Not too bad overall.","alexgash","Jan 27, 2004"
2.86,-26.7,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Hmmm, smells like cold coffee, tastes like cold coffee, but is a bit thinner than cold coffee. On the bright side it has alcohol in it. Ok, that may be a bit harsh. It does taste like coffee, so they did a good job of that. Roasted malt and a bit of sweetness make it a fair beer. Could use a bit more head, and alot more mouthfeel.","Sixpack595","Dec 16, 2003"

Its a bit flat and thin, could be bolder and heavier in both flavor and body. Don't get me wrong, its still a very drinkable stout, a touch above most.

3.2,-17.9,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Deep, dark brown hue black in spots with definite red influences. The head never developed much, soapy at best with similar retention, no lace either. Coffee nose, roasty but not assertive. Straightforward taste, roasted coffee bitterness (maybe some hops too) leads but an oatmeal-like sweetness balances the beer properly. The mouthfeel is thin; the carbonation is high which impedes the ease of consumption I found it too prickly. The finish is abrupt, while not exactly clean, it does lack a bit. Even as the beer warms the flavors never emerge as youd like... more hops arrive but the coffee fades. While this is not a bad beer I need not drink this one again.

4.07,4.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall not a bad stout. Full bodied flavor is pretty straight forward for a coffee stout. Coffee flavor is achieved from the roasted malt, but it does state on the label that it is a ""Stout brewed with coffee"".","Winter","Apr 02, 2003"

3.75,-3.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Acquired via trade. I have heard good things about New Glarus so I was looking forward to getting this. Not the best Stout I have had but not too shabby. I ended up drinking this warmer than most Stouts and it was noticeably better as it warmed. Dark brown with almost no head. Decent roasted coffee aroma and flavor. A little overcarbonated and thin for my tastes but I still liked it.","Dogbrick","Dec 09, 2002"
3.78,-3.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"New Glarus Coffee Stout: In the traditional twelve ounce bottle, with the plain paper label, with a blurb about the beer on the side. Not too much head, but what there is a light tan, with some stickiness. The color is pure black, with not even the slightest bit of light penetrating the brew. The aroma is a light, sweet coffee with a hint of molasses. The taste is very nice, with a very dominant malt flavor. Despite the name, this beer is not dominated by a coffee/ espresso taste, but rather those flavors simply serve to round out, and give some bite to the roasted malts. Very nice, smooth and easy to sip. A great cold weather brew.","jackndan","Dec 06, 2002"
3.9,0,4,4,4,3,4,"The label is confusing on this one. It states ""the deep coffee flavors are created naturally during the brewing process by dark roasted malts."" Then later it notes ""stout brewed with coffee."" So is it or isn't it? Anyway, I'll refer to this as a steady drinking stout because of its thinness, otherwise it's pretty enjoyable. Poured with a big full biege head that stayed fairly well, and had a dark brown color with red hints. Aroma was roasted malt with coffee tones. Not particulary complex but enjoyable taste of roasted malt with coffee. ABV seems pretty low as I had two with no noticable effects.","garymuchow","Nov 30, 2002"

Can't nail it down though.  The off flavor is not present on the tongue.  Very creamy and velvet-like mouthfeel. Taste is good.  Coffee is ever so slight.  Get more of roasty bitterness. Good coffee stout, but not great.","Bighuge","Apr 05, 2002"
3.82,-2.1,4,4.5,3.5,3,4,"Just as the name suggests...decent about of coffee flavor. Balanced fairly well with a sturdy hop presence. Pours a nice black body with quickly disappearing tan head. Relatively creamy, however, there is a somewhat hard-to-describe thinness, which does not serve the beer well, though it does add to its overall drinkabiliy. Stouts are not normally great session beers, this one may be an exception. But there are certainly better stouts out there. Make sure this beer is nice and warm before drinking, the malts really make themselves known as the beer nears room temp. Overall, a decent selection, and widely available in the late winter/early spring here in Wisconsin.","cokes","Feb 18, 2002"
