review_text
"DATE TASTED: April 4, 2015... GLASSWARE: Brew at the Zoo pint... OCCASION: the Easter vigil is upon us--and my Lenten sacrifice is over... APPEARANCE: dark brown, thick and rocky head; thins but stands moderately still as the pour finishes; dark black body... AROMA: some rum fragrances early; peaty and sweet, with some woody notes; some chocolate and milk as well... PALATE: soft and smooth, with some lactic qualities--holds a reasonable aftertaste but doesn’t intrude; medium-bodied and subtly creamy... TASTE: a nice blend of lactic chocolate and darker, malty flavors; drinkably agreeable without being thin; good balance of alcohol and flavor; the woody hints are just that--a pleasant brew for the early spring months rife with wind and rain; just a touch of vanilla makes this end with a peaceful atmosphere .....OVERALL: I first drank this years ago from a holiday sampler, but in seeking its standalone, I find it a worthy first beer after a long Lenten journey; an all-around balanced stout with enough nuance to stand out..."

"The flavor is a letdown after the smell. It has some interesting notes, but it's kind of flavorless overall. The peaty smoke works well, but the vanilla is very faint. Not much else here, just a little chocolate milk. The body is pretty watery."
"The flavor has a very nice vanilla bean component with a very faint oak barrel component and a moderate level of dark roasted malts.  The vanilla is more obvious in the nose and but builds in the flavor with repeated sipping, eventually becoming a tiny bit too strong.   Lightly sweet sweet-bitter balance."

"Will drink this one again I am sure...."
""
""
"This is about as perfect as it gets as winter comes to a close."
""
"I usually do not drink stout, but this one I like, the hint of vanilla very drinkable."
""
"Pours an almost clear intense brown so deep as to appear black expressing a ruby tint when held to the light. More when I find out. The pour produces almost 3 fingers of moderately lasting, tightly bubbled, foamy, mocha head that leaves a streaky speckling of lace. Aroma is dark malt, roast, smoke, dark semisweet chocolate, woody vanilla & undertones of figs, prunes, tobacco & thin floral hop tones. Taste is wood, vanilla, dark semisweet chocolate, roasted (burnt) malt & smoke followed by toffee, figs & faint coffee. Finishes much like the rest of the sip but rapidly develops more intense bitterness, smoke & burnt notes in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with medium carbonation, creamy, chewy & wet with a tiny spice prickle in the finish."

"Overall: A very enjoyable stout...Wish the beer of the month club had sent more of this one !"

"Very nice, great dark flavor, good mouth, slightly sweet afterwards"
""
""
"Overall:  I really, liked this stout.  Love the massive malt presence, blended beautifully with vanilla and brown sugar.  I’m certainly getting some more of this."
""

"O: An easy drinking American stout, initially surprised by how light the body was, by the end I found it rather enjoyable.  Good Flavor profile, no need for food to accompany this beer."

"Lots of vanilla on this stout. It's a great morning beer, not too dark on the roasted malt, not too thick, just right. Short lived tan head just a quarter inch tall. The nose presents smoked malt in small proportion and quite a bit more hops than is common in the style. Vanilla is the predominant flavor, but the malt complexity is awesome and layered. Oak presence is light and sweet, I'm guessing a pretty quick aging process. The body is a bit thin for a stout, and for the richness of flavors. It seems watered down to me, but the flavors are awesome. My first beer from old dominion is a hit."

" The flavor of malt is dominant with a yeast flavor trailing at first with noticeable vanilla and some sweetness with a mild caramel malt flavor and subtle roasted barley core with more vanilla adding to the base with yeast adding to the complexity as it warms. There is perhaps a little raisin and light spice in the finish with low alcohol flavor. Overall this is a very good stout -pretty well integrated vanilla makes me think it is used to augment the 'oak barrel' as the name implies but smooth flavor and easy to quaff at the 6% strength"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Overall it's missing some things that I would expect from a stout (smell is mild and the mouthfeel is weak), and yet it's got a quite good flavor profile and appearance. So overall, very good in some aspects and weak in others making it an above average stout in my opinion. Not sure I would want another one in an evening, but I think with food like steak or even dessert a second glass would be welcoming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly complex beer, with a nice tart and char balance. It's not overly roasted, and the toasted oak complements well."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: All in all a very good stout that I'd recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"In high hopes for this beer died as soon as I poured it. The head was almost non-existent, had almost no aroma, and tasted very gland in general. Got better as it warmed up, but not at all the beer that it surely would like to be. I didn't detect even the slightest hint of the vanilla beans that were mentioned, and that was possibly the most interesting part of the description."

"O/D - Fairly drinkable. Not sure where the smoke or barrel are, but it wasn't too bad. Scored lower because it lacks what it advertises."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, like I said before it is one of my favorites, and it's always easy to find here in Virginia so I pick it up pretty often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a classic beer to me, one of the beers that got me into craft, and I still enjoy it to this day. the oak presence is really nice, and not dominating. Very earthy in flavor, but overall an outstanding beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I got this as an extra in a trade. I'm not much of a stout drinker, but this one was tasty. Super smooth and easy to drink. There is a wonderful oakiness which I know was intended and just a slight hint of vanilla over the roasted malt body. I am impressed...this beer may have just opened a new door for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"F: Densely packed flavor as in a RIS, without the ABV. Perfect everyday, slightly sweet stout, with good balancing hops, bitter, and smokey finish. Must try."
"Appearence is decent. Smell is lacking. It kills me that they can claim ""oak barrel stout"" when it is just aged on oak chips - not in actual barrels. Taste follows the nose - almost like a weak stout with a hint of vanilla. This seems way overrated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely one of the better stouts I've had. Lots of rich, complex flavors with smooth drinking qualities. A definite recommendation."

"What a truly excellent beer. Pours a dark black with a foamy, 1-2"" tan head. I can't recall ever having a beer that leaves as much lacing along the glass as this one. The smell is strong with vanilla beans, chocolate, malt, roasted barley -- excellent. The predominant aspect of the taste is definitely the vanilla beans -- a perfect amount of carbonation makes this very easy to drink. Had this with some hamburger sliders w/ onions and pickles and it was a great match. Highly recommend."

"M&O: softly effervescent, not terribly smooth though, the body comes rather light against the flavour profile which again is not quite robust, either. Interestingly, without specifying the alc. strength on the bottle, my impression is that it goes just around 6.0-6.5%abv. Not bad, but not the most complex I’ve had, either."

"O - Great beer, definitely recommend giving this a try"

"The body is full and smooth but the crispness is held firm by a carbonation that's a little too high for a stout."

"Overall, the most enjoyable thing about this beer was its robustness of flavor. This remained true, even though they kept the body and the feel so light and easily flowing. While the flavor was there, in its meaty, peaty smokiness, the aroma fell a bit flat. We missed a lot of those heavy, oaky butters that you’ve come to expect in any oaked/barreled beer these days. That said, this guy does its style a bit of justice, as pleasant “single” stouts are becoming scarce. This beer will hit the spot if you’re in the mood for cleanly executed simplicity, but it likely will not become your new favorite. As always, as this is a new brewery to us, we remain excited to see what else Dominion has got in their arsenal."

"Overall, this is OK. You would expect more flavor from a barrel stout, but the flavors it does have are nicely placed."

"This review is for the Dominion Oak Barrel Stout in a 12oz bottle and served in a tall glass. This beer is a nice dark brown/black... you can't see through it. What I got from this beer was a bunch of oak, vanilla, chocolate, and coffee bean in that order. If you are into those sort of notes, you will probably like this sort of beer. I'm figuring out that this isn't my style of beer. Not a big fan of beers like this. I figured I'd give this a try. Again, you might really like it if you are into these sort of flavors."

"All in all, an okay stout. Nothing to write home about, but goes down easy. It's possible I didn't let it warm up enough, since the last third was the most enjoyable. Another one is in the beer fridge, so if it's significantly different, I'll re-review. My first beer from this brewery."

"M: Medium bodied, not quite what I was expecting. Very smooth though. I was worried I wasn't going to enjoy this as much since we're in the dog days of summer, but it's actually pretty refreshing for a stout."
""
"A very dark color with a thin light brown color head. I have had a more frothy head before, so I am wondering if there is carbonation issues or if time in the bottle effected this. Non-the-less, the Aroma is clearly vanilla and chocolate with a light roasted smell. The taste brings out a light oak flavor with the vanilla and chocolate dominating. Very smooth feel. The vanilla is quite an enjoyable change up for a stout. A thoroughly enjoyable beer that I will certainly have again."

"So apparently this beer used smoked and peated malts? I got pretty much no hint of smoke or meatiness here, unless you count the touch of oak throughout, but I'm sure that can be attributed to fermenting with oak chips. Overall, a basic and timid stout; kind of boring and uneventful, and while it's not ""bad"" by any means, it wasn't really enjoyable or tasty or different enough for me to seek out again."
"This one pours dark, dark, brown with shallow, frothy head that isn't going anywhere. Aroma is vanilla and roasted chocolate - taste to match. Smooth, thick mouth-feel. Overall, a very enjoyable beer that I would seek out again. Don't hesitate to give this one a try."
"Overall: the drinkablity is very high on this beer. Pretty good buy I feel for around 2 bucks, defiantly enjoyed it and it was worth the try."
""
""
""
""
""
"I wasn't impressed with the first few sips, but some air and time turned things around. It's not a showstopper, but damn if it isn't tasty. Nice overall complexity without trying to be too much. That touch of smoke in the back is awesome."
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid stout. Might have to look for more of this next time through Delaware."
"Overall- A pretty nice drinking stout. Good roasted malt flavors with a nice sweet chocolate and vanilla and some oakiness."
"B"
"Overall, I was expecting quite a bit more out of this. It taste very much like a run of the mill American stout. Really no oak or smoke whatsoever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So my take on this is that the vanilla and sweetness has somewhat run away with the show. It is a pretty tasty vanilla stout, but that seems to dominate and obscure further complexity. Some interesting stuff going on behind that, but I feel the potential is left somewhat unfulfilled, an interesting experience nonetheless. 3.5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Decent beer. I felt like it was missing a lot. It claims to be oak barrel aged and then they say they use oak chips. I couldn't find either of those in this beer. The vanilla stands out nicely though. Crisp clean lighter styled stout."
"O - Overall I think this beer looks better than it tastes which not optimal in my opinion when being forced to choose one over the other. The aroma helps the overall experience but doesn't follow through to the mouth. I would say it's worth a shot, but I don't think I would go back for a second one with so many great options available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not even going to go through the usual list. Sorry, but this beer is not worth buying. Stay away. Bourbon barrel beer...this is not. Stout...this is not. Watery charred crap it is. If you think this is world-class or excellent or even good, stick with your Coors Light. Wow! Only redeeming quality is some silkiness. Look at my other stout reviews. This is not one to sit back and enjoy. Almost...a drain pour!"
"D - Not nearly as good as it sounded. The body is far too thin to carry the oak and vanilla and it just comes across as a mediocre American stout."
"Overall: not very dynamic and pretty watered down. I would like more oak too which actually comes through in the aroma more than the flavor which is odd in my experience."
"It's good, but not quite great. I think for something boasting oak aging, I want more of that flavor."
""
"Taste-Dark roasted malts, subtle oakey spiciness and vanilla notes. Roasty and flavorfull. A nice all-around stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is dark brown with a thin beige head. The aroma brings chocolate, roast, milk chocolate or chocolate milk. Really smooth and creamy. Perhaps a touch of oak if any at all. Vanilla and cream soda like flavors. Fairly sweet. A decent beer, but one is plenty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, This is a tasty, well-priced stout that accomplished it's goal. Perhaps slightly short of sessionable. I'd have again."
""
""
""
"The alcohol was quite low in this for a Stout. I didn't notice at all during my session and even after I polished off the contents of my pint glass, I still couldn't feel or taste it at all. While this wasn't a bad beer, there are so many other American Stouts and Stouts in general that are better than this was. For a beginner, this would be a decent choice. For anyone else, this will probably be a slight disappointment in a field crowded with heavyweights in more than one sense of the word."
""
"Re-review 2/12/13-$11.59/6'er in Brighton. Now 6.1% , brewed with smoked and peated malts, ""dry-hopped"" with vanilla beans and oak chips and hopped with Willamette & Cascade per the website. Pours out to a clear, apparently filtered dark black, forming a modest dark brown head with average retention and good lacing. moderate carbonation, ~2.5 carbs. The nose is predominately burnt sugar, lots of black patent, a touch of smoke and potent vanilla. No hop character in the nose. The mouthfeel still feels thin to be, medium bodied but thin with a dry finish. Burnt sugar, ash, coal water, vanilla, no real oak flavor, finishing dry with smoke in the aftertaste. No real complexity, with a mild herbal bitterness."
"O- If you see this in the store pick it up and try it you won't be disappointed. The oak and vanilla dry hopping give this beer a unique taste that is not too overwhelming and doesn't take over your palate."
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent Stout, but nothing that blows me away. It has typical characteristics of a traditional Stout, but not much else going for it. Worth trying and not a bad beer, but nothing great either."
"Everything about this beer is misleading...why it's called a stout when it drinks like an alcoholic soda; why they call it an ""oak barrel"" stout at that, when there's barley any stout flavor to begin with, and there certainly ain't any oak in this thing. Half-way through my second one and I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do with the rest of these things. Not bad enough to drain pour, but not something I really wanna drink, either."

"poured a deep brown/black with 1/4"" of tan head which dissipated quickly. smells of vanilla, oak, chocolate, and toasted grains. nutty in flavor with a hint of caramel, a subtle smokiness.. i don't taste any chocolate, coffee or the regular stout flavors. more really just wood flavors and pecans. medium body, low carbonation, watered down for the style. even for just being a stout it feels watered down. this isn't a terrible beer, but it seems like very little aging was done to this in barrels, and it seems like maybe they should've worked on their stout profile before bothering putting it in a barrel."
""
"Truly amazing ale."
""
""
"Bottled on: 10/31/12"
"The aftertaste is mild and not too sweet. A very drinkable stout with character."
""
""
""
""
""
" and how smooth it is. A very interesting brew. One of my favorite stouts."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty nice. Unique malt profile mingling with a touch of vanilla is nice. I didnt pick up much noticeable oak. The slightly thin body detracted overall, but a very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer has become a staple with me and my friends. Where I live, it is widely available and probably one of the best beers I know I will be able to find at most places. It seems everyone who I have try this beer loves it."
""
""
""
"O: This is one of those hidden gems I regret not purchasing sooner. Hell, it's available in some GAS STATIONS in VA. A great session stout - think Guinness infused with vanilla, oak tannins, and steroids."
""
"Got this as an extra from a generous BA. Pours a very dark brown-black color with a medium, tan head that diminishes quickly. Scent is quite oaky. More than expected. Some lovely vanilla aromas with chocolate...milk chocolate to be exact. Some nutty notes as well. Taste is vanilla at first. A GOOD amount of vanilla...which is never a bad thing in my book. Some oak flavors with chocolate and malt. Slightly bitter finish with more sweet vanilla. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied...especially for a stout. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer is very interesting. Quite sessionable for a stout with so much flavor. Lacking in the mouthfeel...but also in the ABV...so it goes hand in hand. Great stout for those wanting one they can drink more and more of without getting drunk, while also having some flavorful nectar to sip on."
""
""
""
"This poured out as a nice deep black color with a light brown head on top. The head was bubbly looking with a thin retention and a scattered lack on the glass. The smell of the beer is really nice, it's got a big roasted aroma upfront with a sweet natural vanilla aroma in there as well. The taste has a bitter roasted flavor with the sweet vanilla throughout. The mouthfeel of the beer has a carbonation that is a little too sharp for the style. Overall this beer was really good, I would drink this one again for sure."
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/31/2012. Pours a fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big caramel, milk chocolate, vanilla, toffee, roasted malt, oak, toast, light coffee, and light smoke. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak, smoke, roasted malt, toast, toffee, and light smoked ham. Slight roasty bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, oak, toast, toffee, and smoke on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and robustness; very pronounced but balanced oak flavor; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. It feels a touch on the thin side, but it’s not detrimental. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oak aged stout. Nice amount of robust flavors for a 6% beer with a nice balanced smoke complexity; and extremely smooth to drink as expected. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"NOTE: Live review."
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this offering from Old Dominion. The complexities keep it interesting and they provide a unique take on a stout. Love the balanced flavor profile but was hoping for a bit more of a body. Good drinking though."
""
"Wonderful nose, but the bulk of it is nothing too special."
"O: Overall a nice level of complexity, rich deep stout, sweet dark fruit and chocolate gives this a big beer flavor in a little bottle. Smooth drinking and highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent beer overall. Somewhat complex and satisfying taste. Very nice to have a reasonably complex and rich stout for a reasonable price. I also find it refreshing to have a rich and rewarding stout that isn't overly alcoholic. I would very much like to see more rich stouts in the 5 to 6.5% ABV range. This is probably my favorite American stout. I especially love that it is session friendly. I just wish the finish wasn't quite so dry."
""
""
"O - Found this one to be really pleasant and easy drinking with a lot of complexities. Like how Dominion has a date on the back of their bottle. Really nice light stout that I could definitely session. Worth a try if you like a light complex stout. Cheers!"

"An oily ink black body sits beneath a small, less than one-finger brown cap. The head rose and fell quickly, leaving no lace behind whatsoever. The nose is fairly tame. Mild roast and vanilla beans with some american oak tannins cutting through. Dark fruits and some cocoa powder rounding out the aroma. The flavor profile mimics the nose. Tame, mild roast that never really approaches bold or robust. Vanilla bean sweetness peeks out in the finish, accompanied by dry, toasted oak. On the lighter side of medium, watery in spots. The oak and vanilla beans are the real bright spots here, but this guy just lacks some body."
""
"Overall, I find it quite enjoyable. It is a good dry stout, but rounded and expanded by the oak barrel vanilla."
""
""
"O- I like the smokiness of this one, but the flavors and aromas are a bit subdued. The mouthfeel is also lighter than a traditional stout, worth trying though."
"Woody flavored and pitch black. I would call this a typical stout which does everything right but it is too good to be labeled ""typical"". The mouth and nose follow a main trail of malt dark chocolate. Side paths lead to a coffee flavor. Noticeably in the back ground there is a woody flavor? The result of the Oak barrel? I do not know but wouldn't be surprised if it were. The finish is smooth not crisp or dry at all."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very oak and vanilla focused beer. It is also a very sweet beer. It is a good solid stout. The vanilla and the sweetness combine to give this beer a cola-like flavor."

"Overall this is a very good stout that I was very surprised with. For the price (about $10 per 6), it's tough to beat. It's not an overpowering stout, but it's definitely one that I'll have again and recommend to fellow beer drinkers."

"This is not an imperial stout and while it has pretty big flavors the body is medium and the carbonation is definitely on the high side. There's just a little bit of stickiness but the overall feel is almost prickly. As I work my way through the glass it seems to get thinner and a bit watery in terms of the intensity of the flavors rather than the other way around. Doesn't really ever open up and winds up not being particularly complex. Still, a tasty brew for vanilla fans and an inexpensive buy to boot."
""
""
"O: The taste and nose were solid, but nothing special. The only detractor was the thin body and prickly carb, but for 6.10% you really can't expect a thick body."
""
""
""
"O-giving this a 5 because it's got to be the best stout I've had for this price. It has a decent complexity to it seen in some of te higher end aged stouts. It's missing a lot of robustness and serious flavor, but hey that doesn't bother me knowing how cheap I got this. "
""
""
"Drink and overall: Hey, pretty solid. I have to say. I like what they have done with this thin(ner) bodied stout. The addition of oak chips and vanilla gave it some real depth, but it wasn't too heavy, or cloying and I could definitely enjoy a few of these in one sitting. Cheers to Dominion, I will seek out more of your brews!"

"O: The beer has a very good flavor and is quite enjoyable. This is a good sipping beer and I am glad that I got the chance to try it. Pretty easy to drink."

"O - I bought this bottle at a wegmans, and I'm not sure if anyone else had quality problems with the bottles they bought from there but I wouldn't recommend it."
""
"Dark brown-black pour, opaque, with a small cap of tan head that receded completely after a few minutes. The recipe boasts peated malts and vanilla bean, but I didn't really get either of these items in the aroma or taste. On the nose, a pretty standard stout, dark roasty malts, some milky sweetness, and a vegetal woody quality. About the same on the palate, dark malts, sweet and roasty, oak, earthy hops in the distance, maybe a vague hint of vanilla somewhere in there. Medium mouthfeel, pretty smooth and fairly drinkable. Not what I'd call a go-to or anything. Might be better if the smoke and/or vanilla actually came out from hiding, but overall it's still a solid stout."
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, vanilla bean, and slight cocoa. Taste is the same with a woody aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with only a slightly crisp and thin bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor stout with some mediocre aromas and flavors and a bad mouthfeel."
"Really surprised by this one. I love regional beers I have never tried that rock, this one does. You'll love it."
""
""
"It pours a deep black and is thick as hell. Two fingers of brownish head and quickly dissipates to a thing later that remains. Smells - oak, caramel, vanilla, coffee - smells amazing. The taste matches the smell - a nice and complex flavor profile from start to finish. Creamy malt profile up front balanced with a bitter finish. This is a well crafted stout and that is very complex. You need to try this."

"Overall a good stout, needs a little more body, however, I enjoyed it a lot more as it warmed."
"O: good beer overall, especially with the complexity over time. It changes even more as it warms. For $10 per 6 pack, you can't miss on this."
""
"Overall: Solid Ba Imperial Stout that is almost on the borders of being a brown ale with the nuttiness and salty peanut notes in the nose/taste of the brew."
""
"Slightly oxidized but tasty none the less. Loved the vanilla aspect of this one, pleasant surprise. Thanks mikeyv35."
""

"O. Singularly underwhelming in almost every way. This beer is thin, mostly flavorless, and is way too watery for a robust stout aged with vanilla and oak chips. I wasn't expecting much from Dominion, but I've definitely had better. Woof."
""
"Label says dry hopped with vanilla but all I taste is smokey beer that is as dark as a Guiness. It has a boring label that's cream in color with a brown botlle. If you are into a smokey sharp stout this is a great beer for you. This is smokey whiskey and water."
""

"Overall a very enjoyable stout. I would love to have this one again."
"Overall, disappointing. More porter than stout."

"The oak and vanilla defiantly come through and are nicely balanced in a very solid beer but I'd like stronger aromas in the nose, more body and better head retention."

"Bottles 1/23/12. Poured into chalice. Deep brown; almost black. Deep tan thin head. Gone quickly, but this rim remains. Smell is very mild...roasted malts with a hint of vanilla. Taste is of roasted malts and vanilla. A bit of oakey/wood hits the palate with a sweet milky taste. The more it warms up, the more vanilla comes out in the flavor. A bit bitter finish, but works well with the sweet vanilla. Overall, a really great stout, and as a fan of vanilla brews, this is as vanilla as I ever had."
""
"Overall a good stout, but just not getting the 'oak' that I Was expecting!"
""
"I suggest playing The Black Crowes w/ Jimmy Page LOUDLY while consuming this."
""
"O - The aroma and flavors are not very powerful, but it isn't bad. I didn't know anything about this beer or brewery but I wasn't overwhelmed. The price was right, though, so I would rate the value as strong."
""

""
"O: Overall, a real good beer.  One of the better single stouts I have had.  Decent complexity in the palate profile, and a great nose. I wish the bourbon characters were more prominent, but still well done, and worth a try especially as a flavorful, sessionable alternative to a big RIS.  "
""
""
""
"Incredibly complex with more flavors than I can name including touches of smoke and creamy vanilla as well as coffee. The layers of flavor are immense and all compliment each other amazingly. An impressive brew."
"Wonder if the oak really improved this one."

"Sweet malted aroma with hint of vanilla. Pours deep ruby/brown with a full dark beige head. The head lingers and then laces the glass all the way down to the end. Taste is mildly hopped and lightly sweet from the vanilla. Pleasing to the tounge and palate!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Meh."
""
"Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is a delicious sipper that begs to be gulped. The body is full and thick, gliding over the tongue like milk without becoming overly coating or sticky. The carbonation is dialed in just right as it does not present itself much (allowing the flavors to really pop) while really assisting in the swallow."
"D: The drink ability is in the balance of this beer, it goes down more like a porter and has a solid mix of flavors. Very worthy stout!!"
""
""
""
"From notes .On tap. Black/brown pour, tan head with small amounts sticking to the glass. Barrel dominates the aromas with some roast malt and cocoa. Taste is a good blend of all of these. Vanilla oak blended with some chocolate and roast malt. Finish with a twinge of coffee and vanilla. A little thinner than one would like for a stout. Nothing mindblowing, but very good for a ""regular"" stout."
""
"Oak Barrel Stout pours a black color, with a small dark tan head. There are chocolate, and vanilla odors, with a hint of coffee. The taste is nice and full. Good blend of chocolate and vanilla, with hints of coffee, on a smokey malty, slightly bitter backbone. The flavors aren't overpowering, and blend nicely. Nice creamy consistency, great taste, easy to drink. Overall a fantastic stout, complex flavors, but put together perfectly."

""
"O: This beer looks great and is so smooth, but the nose and taste are just above average in my opinion. Maybe I'm just not a fan of the vanilla. Still, good overall."
"A little thin for the style - which was disappointing to me. Overall it was a very complex and satisfying stout."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is an excellent beer, and one that I would drink again. It goes down very smooth, and it would be pretty easy to knock back several."
"O- One of the more dynamic tasting regular ""stouts"" I've had. The vanilla and oak definitely add another dimension, but this brew is a little weak overall."
""
""
"This is easily one of the most drinkable stouts I've ever had, yet it is very complex and delicious. I usually like imperial stouts over regular, but this one is so good that I think I will try to have this in my fridge more often. Definitely pick it up if you see it."
""
"Pours a brown/black with a tin head that dissipates quickly. While it indicates it is brewed with vanilla this taste is very faint. This is a very smooth and enjoyable stout that I wouldn't mind having again. I didn't notice much carbonation but there was noticeable lacing on the glass. As I said before, there was a slight hint of the vanilla, coffee notes, and a creamy texture to this one."

"An opaque black-brown brew with a fair light brown cover and good lacing. I can smell a mild citrus licorice idea here. There’s a bit of cocoa/charcoal to make for a pleasant but subdued enticement. The taste buds pick up on tart charcoal and tasteful chocolate with a touch of orange/citrus bite. The body is medium-ish but it is a bit aqueous. I get a slightly resinous malt finish that also suggests some earthy juniper brightness. Carbonation is tiny, spritzy stuff that flows smoothly and makes for a very decent stout that could prove pretty sessionable. Recommended."
"O- I love this beer... until I felt how thin it is. If this was a touch on the chewier side this would be a world class stout."
"Overall, this beer empties very well. It's an interesting balance between a lighter bodied beer and a strong flavor. Highly recommended. Don't let the lack of head and light color throw you off."
"O- What a great beer. I am still developing a taste for stouts but this one is great. High marks for complex flavor and smells. Pick one up."
"Pours a dark brown, close to black w/ a one finger chocolate head. Decent lacing on my snifter. Nose is that of vanilla, coffee, barley, chocolate- with the vanilla and coffee really coming out front. Very smooth though- not bitter. Taste is a little on the thin side for me. It just lacks that oomph that the best stouts have. It's tasty, just not quite put together how I'd like. Feel is the same- too thin for the style, and a little on the fizzy side. This is probably the weak point of this beer. Overall, a good beer, but not something I'll probably seek out again. Still, it's worth trying if you've never had it. Cheers."
"O-pleasant beer. Would have again."
"Not a terrible beer but kind of strange for the style and over all not super impressive. Worth the under $2 though."
"Pours a one finger light brown head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Baked chocolate nose and flavor is slight oak and baked chocolate that goes to a burnt chocolate finish. $4.50 for a 12oz bottle at Skyland Resort Luray, VA."
" on the balancing sweetness, I would have liked it even more."
"Overall I would recommend this one. Bottled 02-17-11 and was amazingly smooth. Tasted as if it had some age on it. Complex and smoooth."
"*Oh, and for the record, moving DOMINION BREWING out of Virginia (the OLD DOMINION state), should require you to change the f-cking name."
"O: Its certainly not the best oak aged and infused beer I've had, but its a solid enough American stout with some extra flair thrown in it. The 6.1% ABV makes it a nice choice to pair with a chocolate or raspberry dessert (or both!). Or even a couple AS dessert itself."
"D: great complexity between the wood and vanilla. just nice to have some other flavors worked into your standard roast, chocolate, sweet stout flavors. very enjoyable and unique american stout."
"O: a great stout, some beautiful notes and a great mouthfeel. This is an awesome stout and it will be making a reappearance in the fridge."
"Worthy"
"Thanks Robo for the opportunity. "
"O: Not a good stout; at least this bottle wasn't. Barely a mediocre beer. I finished it, but I wouldn't have really cared if it disappeared. Drinkable, but why would you? Mouthfeel and a general weakness of character ruins any chance at more than a passable brew. Absolutely not recommended, though you could do much worse...I won't be having another."
"O: It's good, for what it is. I'd like to try one with a bit more vanilla on it (I think that's a special kind of this one, right?). Very enjoyable beer."
"Overall: Not necessarily what I was expecting to get, but a good beer that I would buy again nonetheless."
"At the Old Dominion Brewery located in Terminal A of Dulles and the second beer I am trying is the Oak Barrel Stout. The color poured deep dark rich amber with ecru colored head. The aroma is roasty with good malt balance. The flavor of this beer is complex the peat and vanilla are very apparent. There definitely smokey undertones….and flashes of anise/black licorice. The body is decent….right on the borderline of being too watery for me. The mouthfeel is good…..for me it would be tough to have more than two or three at a sitting."
"A lot of tasty notes going on, but seem kind of superficial & ZAP-POW. Still pretty enjoyable, really didn't even pick up on the barrel character, fun no less."
"O - Very good American stout overall. Could become my go to local stout. Highly recommend."
" it was truly amazing,,,the color smell teste.was just awsome..i do suggest if u get this beer in the bottle let it rest b4 drinking...i found this to be better but thats just me...enjoy"
"Really solid stout, quite ideal flavor profile at its ABV."
"Overall: Recommended. If you're looking for an inexpensive but tasty alternative to Guinness, try a Dominion."
"Into a snifter it pours a deep opaque black with a 2 finger khaki head that leaves a thin film for the remainder of the beer. Loose lacing dribbles down the glass. Smell is notes of coffee, raisins, and bittersweet dark chocolate. Taste is very smooth with an even balance of roasted malts that are not too overpowering. Very easy to drink. Very refreshing having an oak barrel stout that is not through the roof with a high ABV. Wonderful take on the classic stout style. Taste the oak a little bit, a tad more would be nice. Great brew though."
"O - A very balanced stout with tons of flavor and complexity. This one is awesome."
"This beer had a beautiful appearance for a stout. Nice fluffy head. Smell and taste were very smooth yet flavorful. Overall for a stout (not an imperial stout) this one was balanced and not watery or weak like so many others. A well made stout worth sampling."
"Many thanks to Mdaschaf for this extra in our recent trade. Actually the second time to try it, but the first time to review it. Poured into my DFH snifter- pours a pitch black color, with tan head that fills the top of the glass, then recedes, leaving nice tan lacing on my glass. Smell- brown sugar, molasses. Taste- brown sugar first, thick carbonation, brown sugar, oak vanilla on the end. Kick ass! So much going on here. Zero alcohol detected here at all (its not a big ABV beer, but this is pure flavor with no heat). Mouthfeel- nice rich carbonation, smooth medium bodied stout. Drinkability- I'm intensely jealous I can't get this beer in Texas. I could easily see this being in my fridge at all times."
"12oz bottle poured into snifter on 04/18/2011. Bottled on 03/10/10. Black body with a thick and creamy tan head. Good retention and decent lacing. My nose picks up bitter chocolate, roasted malts, a touch of vanilla, and coffee. The taste is the same but add in some caramel, brown sugar, and something boozy? Low ABV for that but it seems to be there. Full bodied, low carbonation, and a slightly dry finish. Good beer and my first from Dominion. If this is any indication of what they offer then I will be back ASAP."
"Overall: This is a fine beer that I would gladly try again but do not see myself buying again unless something more interesting is not available."
"Due to the fact that this was given to me by a Beer-Of-The-Month subscriber, I consider myself lucky to try a beer of such limitation. Not much to say about this other than how amazing easy it is to drink. Its one of those beers you tell your buddies, ""Cmon' just try it."" Its perfect for new and experienced drinkers alike. Definitely make a trade or pick some up if your in the area. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"A pretty nice stout overall but a little heavy on the Vanilla which masks the rich malts utilized here. Nice bitterness though. I brewed a Vanilla Bourbon Porter using a tincture in the dry hop that tasted quite similar."
"Fuller medium body, high carbonation, a bit dry and tingly on the tongue, which I usually don't prefer for this style. This drinks okay, the alcohol is a bit lower which was nice, but not really what I'm looking for from an oak aged vanilla bean stout."
"O: A very smooth and drinkable stout. I had one, but could have had 3 or 4."
"Overall - A average beer at best. To mild and bland for my liking. Too easy to drink for what style it is. Maybe a good starter for a stout drinker but Not worthy after you've had a kbs or old rasputin."
"Another of over 150+ different brews that has arrived at my doorstep via BOTMC, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a combination of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts, almost a roasted malted milk ball smell. This is a new one for my olfactories and is quite pleasing. This brew pours to a motor oil color and consistency with a tan, yet transitioning from darker to light, head consisting of multi-sized bubbles ranging from medium to small with a pillow top. Head laces as it recedes. On the taste the mouthfeel quickly stands out as highly viscous and silky. The taste then starts with a milky roasted flavor, that slowly ascends to a sweeter chocolate and vanilla, then transitions to a smoky bitterness that still remains sweet in the background. The finish stays bittersweet throughout. This is a delicious brew, I highly recommend."
"D- Very high, especially for the style. Nothing comes on too strong but all the flavors are there on the taste buds and it feels nice in the mouth. Would have been nice to see a little more bitterness or roast character but the vanilla and sweetness are welcome too."
"Drinks pretty good. Not bad at all."
"O - Well, this isn't a bad American stout, but there's not really much barrel flavor here despite the name. There is some oak-like vanilla, but it's pretty subtle. The brewing is fair enough, but just doesn't deliver the barrel expectations very well."
"Overall though this is kind of surprising this is not what I expected for this style, I was thinking more of big roast and chocolate/coffee/licorice sort of for this style. But it's basically rauchbier light to me and a good one to boot."
"O - Very easy drinking and a very good tasting stout. I'm not a stout lover and will definitely seek this out again. 4"
"O - Really surprisingly good. Didn't expect to love it like this, but for the style and ABV the taste is phenomenal. A lot of flavor packed into a little package."
"The label says that it was bottled on 01/17/2011 and it was reviewed on 03/18/2011 but the beer didn't seem up to par, to me anyway. I haven't had a known fresh sample of it so I'm not sure that it was stale but my experience doesn't really follow along with the others."
"I had this from a bottle poured in to a Samuel Adams glass. This stout was black as night with a beautiful tan head that reduces to a nice thin lace on top. This has smell of a robust coffee. The first sip is of coffee with a hints of vanilla at the end. Overall this is a really flavorful stout. This stout is smooth drinking, definitely on of my favorites. Very tasty!"
"Dominion Oak Barrel Stout has a black colour and a 5 mm tan head that lasts awhile and maintains good lacing. The smell is all chocolate and and woodiness. The taste is quite hoppy to begin with but the roasty charcoal and woodiness take over quickly. The finish is slightly bitter with some charcoal. This beer has a good foamy texture. Overall, a decent oak-aged stout... although not especially interesting."
"As they would say in chicago: ""you can put it on the boaaard! YES!"""
"Overall: Not used to lower alcohol Oak-aged Stouts - I like it. Proves that a brewer can be innovative with overdoing the abv or IBUs."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Totally black in color. Poured with an ample beige head that reduced to a wispy cap and light sticky lacings. Sweet vanilla and dark roasted malt aromas. Vanilla, chocolate, and roasted malt flavors in the beginning that transition to coffee flavors and a bitter hoppy ending. Vanilla, coffee and hop flavors combine at the end to leave a black licorice-like taste in the back of the throat and nose. Very easy to drink."
"D- A solid stout bolstered by a delicious vanilla character. I could definitely have a couple of these without a problem."
"The appearance is pretty darn black for a just a regular old stout. The aromatics are pretty bland. There is some oak woodsiness in the background but there is no malt characteristics in the aroma at all. The flavor is actually really damn good. There is a lot of vanilla in the flavor, some of it from oak, some of it from added vanilla. The barrel is palatable and you can taste the dank oak. The roasted malt flavor is pretty weak but it does exist in the background. The mouthfeel is really creamy and it was really really nice. This was really really tasty. As far as drinkability it was really nice, but there was something still generic about it overall. Still a pleasant surprise from a random stout."
"D= very drinkable, possible session if you're in the darker-beer mood with a slight vanilla twist. Would be fantastic with dark rich chocolate desserts. Might be an interesting twist with a swiss-mushroom-burger. Definitely not fish or steak."
"Drinkability was good. I enjoyed it, and if I were in the mood to session stouts, this would be a candidate."
"I enjoyed sipping on this, and finished the six pack over the course of the week. Being basically as stout with some oak notes, it sure as hell is a lot tastier than a Guinness Draught, and I would order this at a bar given the option."
"ill be reaching for something else though"
"This beer is very different from all of the other stouts I've tried ... in a not so good way. The flavors are very lively, perhaps because of the soda-like effervescence continuously arising to the top. But those flavors are not well balanced. I feel like this beer was an experiment in brewing and marketing an oak aged beer."
"Pours a near black color with a small tan film on top. Very little lacing. Smell is very subdued. Some roasted malts and a little chocolate and coffee. Chocolate malt, although mild, is the most dominate flavor in the palate, followed by lactose sweetness and a kiss of oak from the oak chips that were added. The oak character is nice because it is subtle and doesn't hide the other flavors like some stouts that are actually aged in barrels. The thing is, there isn't alot of other flavors. The vanilla beans get lost completely and there is no prominent hop flavors. Also, the roasted malt and coffee in the nose, doesn't really show up. Yet, the chocolate and oak are enough to make it work. Medium bodied with low carbonation. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and rolls around nicely. Overall, an approachable and enjoyable stout that, due to it's mild flavor profle, is quite drinkable."
"12 oz bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Bottling date edged off the side of the label. 0/17/? Beige head rests on a black body. Slick, clear lacing slides quickly down the glass. Aroma is dominated by coffee and malty sweetness. Taste is moderately sweet with coffee notes and roasted malt. I don't exactly pick up on the vanilla but it may be responsible for some of the residual sweetness, taste is more like a milk stout. Exceptionally easy to drink and delicious. My only complaint is naming a beer aged on oak chips ""oak barrel stout"". Just a touch misleading."
"D-- A sipper due the amount of oak in this. Still very drinkable and can have multiple bottles in a sitting. If not in the mood for a monster stout this is a very good alternative. A lot of flavor and character and perfect carbonation for this level of beer. Might need a touch more vanilla but otherwise very good beer."
"D: By no means complex , still not bad if your looking for a easy drinker. Good price point for what you get i think. Not my favorite but wouldnt turn one down if offered, i left wanting a little more."
"Pours a slightly thick, very dark brown with a thick, creamy light tan head. aroma isn't huge but is quite nice with scents of roasted nuts. cofee, a bit of charred wood, and a chocolate malt ball note. flavor is solid, but nothing special. smoked wood and roasted coffee up front with the slightest hint of oak and vanilla coming in late with a lingering coffee finish. palate is a bit light for a stout and felt slightly thin with a bit too much carbonation. overall, a decent stout that with a little more style could be quite delicious."
"Overall - Full flavored, full bodied, yet easy to drink. What a great take on the style. Has everything you ask for in the style."
"Poured aggressively, only a brief 1-finger head, reduces to almost nothing, almost no lacing, caramel head and black in color. Aroma of smoked malt, no oak and vanilla as stated on the bottle....although I haven't gotten to tasting yet. More aroma of chocolate and dark malts. Taste of a little smoke, chocolate, roasted malts, no oak, and only slight vanilla when breathing out while tasting. Even at 5.2% ABV, the alcohol is noticeable....aaand that sucks. I would only recommend this beer as a dark beer option for a get-together or party or something. Otherwise, I would not seek out this beer."
"The pour doesnt look too dark. It gathers pretty black though. The head is small but nice while it lasts. A couple rings of lacing are left behind. The smell is nice, but kinda toned down. Its pretty damn woody with a sweet kick of vanilla and brown sugar. The flavor falls kinda flat. Its missing a big velvety richness. Theres just a thin vanilla taste with an oaky finish with a Dr. Pepper flavor somewhere in between. The body is extremely too thin. It really ruins any chances this beer has at being smooth and creamy. The body isnt even enough to give the sharp carbonation something to struggle through. It has a very prickly feeling. A very dry finish is very abrupt. In all this beer is pretty drinkable. I wont have a problem finishing it, especially at this 5.2% ABV. It just leaves me wanting much more."
"I really liked the taste of this beer with the vanilla, dark chocolate and coffee in the front, the roasted malt dominating the middle and the bittersweet aftertaste in the back. Nicely balanced, a very drinkable stout. Good job Dominion brewery."
"D- Very easy to drink beer. Nothing overwhelming but solid. Everything is balanced although would want a little more flavor out of an oak aged stout. Still with the lower ABV, would be great to have a sixer of this on a snowy night."
"d- nice, this isn't the most complex or mind blowing stout out there but it's very drinkable and does down easily, i'd drink this again!"
"Drinkability is high as it has a low ABV and is a nice sipper. Good for a night you want to sip a few but not get drunk."
"D- Very tasty, but heavy and thick. Nothing overpowering and no alcohol presence. Heavy enough to be a sipper though."
"D-Very nice. Lacking a bit in depth perhaps but very tasty."
"Taste, nice, mild, the slightest amount of vanilla. Very light bourbon presence. Same with the oak. This is a nice example of making a full bodied, wood aged stout, without having it be of such abv that will wreck you. A twist of leather for ya. Hints of chocolate. Hints of everything, nothing is massive, but it still is full of flavor. A very drinkable stout at a good price, $3 a single."
"D-I have drank a couple of these at different times and I can't imagine drinking more than one in a sitting. The weird flavor cuts into its drinkability."
"This is a medium bodied beer, with pleasant carbonation, and quite drinkable."
"I could probably drink a bunch of these. "
"Pours a black with a pretty big tan head that leaves pretty good lacing. The nose is of roasted malt, sweet vanilla, and coffee. The taste is strong of vanilla, with a healthy dose of coffee and some roasted malt. Its a little to sweet for me, and not one of the best stouts ive had, but an alright beer and definitely worth trying. Nice creamy mouthfeel but not extremely drinkable."
"This is a very drinkable stout, a very nice session one at that."
"Black with dark brown highlights and a dense, brown head with great retention and lacing. The nose is solid. Prominently roasty with a blend of heavily kilned and mildly charred malts, the added vanilla bean character is noticeable and quite enjoyable. Oak isn't particularly noticeable on the nose, which is surprising given that this was aged on chips rather than barrels. Bitter chocolate and coffee appears as this beer warms up. The palate is just as good as the nose with a very enjoyable level of roasted malt lending a blend of coffee, a little char and the base grain itself. Sweetness is low, apart from the moderate vanilla character that appears mid-palate, there's not much by way of sweetness here. Medium-light in body with soft carbonation, this feels pretty smooth on the palate. The finish is long and bitter with plenty of roasted grain and a little char present. Very good, especially at $4/20oz pour. I'll revisit this for sure."
"This is very drinkable brew. For a stout I was amazed. The flavor is strong, but not overbearing, its a hearty brew, but still goes down easy. I could surely have a few of these in a session and enjoy every drop. The price seems to be pretty good as well. Once again, I am super impressed with Dominion."
"MF/D- Silky smooth on the tongue with its share of carbonation. Drinkability is amazing. Low ABV at 5.2% and great flavors for the style. It's by far the best of this style that I've ever had."
"If you're looking for a hit-you-over-the-head stout, this isn't for you. The bitterness is balanced with sweetness, the vanilla complements the coffee, and the overall taste does not demolish the palate."
"Very drinkable in my opinion."
"Pours dark brown with a light brown head. Nose brings some lift notes of dark fruit and hints of vanilla. A bit of oak. Taste is malty with a light oak touch. Decent feel with some tannins. Pretty good but a bit plain for what it is."
"Good beer to relax in the evening after a long day. I don't think I would want to drink more than 2 in evening."
"I had this on tap at the Nuclear Free Beer Festival. The aroma and even the taste brought early childhood memories back. There was a store on M St in Georgetown called the Georgetown Coffee and Tea Shop, that is what it reminded me of. I would go in there every Sunday after church and I always loved the smell. It was nice and balanced and finished like a good espresso."
"[EDIT] Recently got to try one of the early vintages of this brew. It was very solid. What's produces nowadays...ehhh...not so much."
"Drinkability is excellent given the alcohol. A standout brew, quite frankly I wish they distributed here."
"Before my friend finally picked up the keg to send it back, I poured another hit of this stuff into a growler. As a matter of fact, I poured it into my old Old Dominion Brewing Company growler from a very fine Brewpub that is no longer in existence...sad."
"D - Man where have you guys been all my life? I have been kicking around equally as cheap stouts and exposed to some that taste as good for double the price but I have no idea how they can just throw this at you with a 10.99 a sixer price tag! WILL be picking more up and WILL be having a few a sitting. In my opinion I fully agree with the bros ""A" rating or greater all the way!"
"D: drinkable, well-made but doesn't have any outwardly incredible tastes that would have me wanting to drink more than two in one sitting"
"Great beer!"
"An excellent stout. Pick this one up if you see it..."
"D - pretty easy drinking stout. Not nearly as much flavor as I was expecting. While there are notes of vanilla and oak it seems to really just mellow the beer out more. It could certainly use a little more flavor. Still a beer worth trying and I wouldn't have a problem ordering one if I was out somewhere. That being said I don't see myself seeking this one out in the future."
"D: Not the worst stout but nothing I'd trample folk to get."
"Drinkability: This is a great stout, and probably my favorite stout overall. Definitely worth it, and this is very drinkable and sessionable."
"M/D: Medium bodied with little carbonation. A really drinkable stout, loving the fact that it is 5.2%. This is a beer I am definitely going to be getting again."
"D - Good drinkability for an oak-aged stout, smooth, clean and quite tasty. And in the case of this beer, the lighter mouthfeel helps it score a little higher in the drinkability department."
"D: For a dark, tasty stout, this is very drinkable. This, of course, comes at a cost of flavor. A decent, but mild rendition."
"D: A very drinkable and complex stout. Maybe it's the small distribution from Old Dominion but this is a beer that I would expect more people to be talking about, it's among the best stouts I've ever tasted. It's an easy beer to enjoy any time of the year."
"Pours dark opaque with a mild head. Disipated quickly and left only mild lacing. Perfectly carbonated. Its a stout that is well balanced enough to get even non beer drinkers to enjoy."
"Good, tasty, but I wish it had more bunch. The taste is great but I want more of it. Still a good stout and worth trying; more affordable than other stouts."
"D: Easy to drink, certainly worthy of a taste. A low abv."
"I'd drink this one again, but not going out of my way to acquire more."
"Drinkability: Probably wouldn't search this one out again. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad, it was just ok. At a low abv, I can see it being a sessionable beer, but I personally wouldn't bother."
"I see some other reviewers are knocking this beer for showing restraint in some aspects. I feel like I should oppose..."
"d- for the style, great. i prefer double/russian imperials, but i would certainly drink a number of these if they were in WI. Super solid extra, thanks Tom!"
"MF/D: slightly more carbonated than the average stout that begins with an explosion of bubbles thats gone as quickly as its felt. however, ends very smooth down the throat."
"Pours a jet black color, not much had to it. Faint hop aroma to it, with a hint of nuttiness. Taste is full bodied, nice and thick stout, very tasty and smooth. Definitely has a distinctly different taste than other stouts, due to the oak and vanilla infusions. very good beer, low in ABV, tasty, and smooth.. a great session beer and wish they had it up here in CT."
"d - A nice stout. I thought it looked and smelle amazing, and had a nice taste too. If it had a more sweet chocolate taste as opposed to the bitterness it would have been perfect. Would try again."
"This is one of the first beers I grabbed when I moved out here to Virginia. Memories. It pours a straight black-brown topped by a finger of quickly-dissipating light ecru micro-foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, molasses, maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla, and I think there's a pinch of cinnamon in there as well. The taste consists mostly of roasted malts, cocoa powder, vanilla, and brown sugar. The sweetness is curtailed, but so is the roastiness, for that matter. Everything is a bit dry and subdued. Not much oak character in there either. This all isn't to say that it tastes bad, just not nearly as good as it potentially could. The body is a solid medium, with a lackadaisical carbonation and a stiff, though smooth, feel. Overall, not at all the best oak-influenced stout, but a nice affordable alternative."
"D - I thought this had more alcohol in it than it did, but it's pretty low. It is averagely drinkable considering the abv and weight."
"Overall, this is a big miss. The first sip is nice vanilla but after that its all downhill. The vanilla disappear and you get a powder feel."
"This isn't too strong and the taste doesn't lean too much towards one thing, so I could easily drink 6 of these in an evening."
"Pours a dark brown color that when held to the light displays some deep ruby colors and suggests a clarity to this brew if it wasn't so dark. The head initially formed with a finger of tanned bubbles that receeds to a very thin cap and sticks in patches of lace about the glass. Aroma includes some favorable scents of dark grain suggesting chocolate and coffee along with the sweet scent of vanilla pushing straight through the back making itself easily noticeable. Further investigation of the nose reveals some hop character and a bit of the woodsy oak notes. The flavor of this brew follows along with what the aroma indicated. Dark roasty grain flavor upfront with a touch of hops. The dark grain flavor includes chocolate and coffee character along with a strong vanilla flavor and a finish that has a noticeable amount of alcohol and an interesting mixture of burnt grain/vanilla sweetness and an oaky/woody dryness that urges you to continue to sip this brew. As it warms, the base grainy flavor seems quite fresh and is enjoyable. The flavor it leaves in the mouth is reminescent of walking through a grain mill. This is a taste I usually only get at the local brewpub, enjoyable to say the least coming from a bottle. Medium to full bodied with a modest level of carbonation. The inclusion of the vanilla bean could be tamed a little more to make it more subtle but all together it works. Pretty decent brew, would have no problem enjoying a few of these."
"Great smooth mouthfeel and a nice light to medium body. Again, an easy to drink stout with a great taste."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of coffee and malts. Taste is also of coffee and malts, some notes of vanilla. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a good quality brew."
"Drinkability: Really a superior stout. I'm not usually that big of a stout fan but this one might make me a believer. Definitely worth a try."
"D - The aroma wasn't all there for me, but otherwise, a very tasty, drinkable stout."
"F: Finishes lighter with more lingering malt and chocolate. Mostly creamy chocolate, cocoa nibs, chocolate milk, etc. A little roasty earthy bitterness. Touch of sweetness lingering still, doesn't dry much. A very nice drinkable stout, I'm surprised at the rating. I think most Americans are jaded by the super heavy RISes and DIPAs, etc. and they seem to overlook the really nice drinkable tasty stouts."
"D: Easy Drinking and I could probably take down quite a few in a sitting. Maybe it is the thin mouthfeel, or the somewhat lower alcohol, but I could see doing a couple in a sitting. Overall I think it is a Par beer. It feeds the Barrel aged stout craving, but it doesn't eliminate it."
"Pours out a dark brew with a dar tan 2 finger head,no light comes thru this glass. Smells like stout, nice rich coffee aroma. Nice sweet stout with coffee notes that dominate the finish. Mouthfeel is ok. Drinkability is good, finished the beer rather quickly, wish i had a second!"
"Drinkability: I would personally only have one or two of these at a time because of the robustness, but at the same it swallows easily and its perfect for a cool autumn or cold winter day."
"D - This is unique, and I'm glad to have tried it. Once is probably good enough. Sometimes I really crave vanilla though, and this would be a good fit if it were available locally."
"D- Easy to drink for a stout. It is much better to drink slowly and enjoy. I would only drink 2 at the very most at once."
"My pour created a finger of thick, foamy, deep-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep, dark brown with cola highlights at the edges. Nose had a bourbon-like vanilla quality. Mouthfeel was medium with a definite oakiness in the mouth. Finish had an interesting admixture of smoke, charcoal, oak and vanilla. While it was interesting, I probably would not want to drink more than a couple at a time. I think that the oak was too prevalent and I would have rather the vanilla come to the forefront."
"This is a good beer. Nice character, and no overwhelming wood notes that similar beers may feature. Offers a nice balance of flavors without abusing the palate. This is just a clean beer."
"A classy stout, definitely a worthy beer."
"Pours black with a late developing off white thick head. The aroma is a little malty but thin. The flavor is roasted with cinnamon and oak, with a liquorish burn. The finish is spicy and oaky, but thin. Deep caramel with some cream. The mouthfeel is creamy but tapers off too quickly."
"not my favorite stout....but i like the bourbon notes. it's full-bodied, complex, not creamy smooth like Guinness, but it's up there in my top 5 or so."
"Overall: Overall, a very good dark beer. Nice rich flavor with strong notes of vanilla and roasted malts. If you like a good american stout, then you should definitly try this beer."
"Aggressive pour gets you about a finger's worth of brown head, loose, semi-dilute foam gone lickety-split, gauzy sheets of lacing slowly slide down the glass. Onyx black liquid, nary a trace of color to be found. Vanilla certainly there in the nose, fudge-like, milk chocolate, coffee ice cream, minor touch of grains and baking dough, lacks the second tier of scents to display full expressivity. Medium-bodied, comes across as too dry and fluffy to make a direct impression, the carbonation gives it a soft and feathered texture. The dryness highlights the coffee bean to espresso and darkens the chocolate flavors, nuttier and higher overall roast. The vanilla more powdered here but maintains a strong presence. No true calling card offered by the hops. Never fully soaks into the tongue, however, lingers as a whole. Wonder where the beef is here."
"This has to be one of the worst beers I have had. Usually I can choke it down. I usually can say each beer I have had I can drink but could just improove or is just bland. This beer just needs a complete overhaul. It does not appear that I have a bad bottle so I feel this is a fair review. It does not taste infected."
"Dr. Wish I had another one handy. Very good."
"A: A solid two fingers of head off a hard pour, head is craggy and drops to leave a few scattered spots of lace on the side of the glass, ebony in color, only the faintest hint of light passes through at the edge of the glass - 4.50, S: Strong chocolate and espresso, also a faint sour cherry aroma and ash - 4.00, T: Burnt marshmallow skin, slight vanilla, touch of oak on the tail end of the beer, weak mocha coffee - 3.50, M: Extremely smooth and silky but also a little thin - 4.00, D: A good beer but nothing outstanding, could use some bolstering in the body - 3.50"
"Flavor at first was a little too carbonated for my liking with stouts...although that seemed to fade out within a few minutes. Beer also needed to loose it's chill. At fridge temp, too much is lost(afterall...we're talking about a serving from a restartant where every beer is usually served ice-cold!) So I sat and let the beer warm up a bit. Mouthfeel is very smooth, yet medium body with lots of vanilla bean notes. Can taste the wood in the back end of the flavor, which characteristically ends slightly bitter...which is desired in most sweeter stouts. Overall, not a great stout, but definitely good and worth a try!"
"D - Could drink a few of these very quickly. Great for winter."
"A very nice balance of sweetness with the vanilla bean quite distinctive, but finished with a very slight astringency that kept the beer from being too sweet and added to the drinkability. Mouthfeel was a bit of a letdown- on the thin side and made the beer seem less substantial. A good after dinner beer."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. Jet black in color with a 2 finger white head that does not stick around long. Vanilla and oak are the dominat scents. The taste follows the nose, the finish is dry and crisp. The beer is too light in body, otherwise a pretty good stout."
"D - pass."
"D: Pretty good for what is basically a budweiser beer."
"Overall a very good beer. Goes down nicely and the flavors do not get tired. I would certainly get this again."
"I would call this one of the top American Stouts that I've had. Very easy drinking with vanilla and oak to make it stand out from the crowd. Glad I had the chance to have this and I would welcome it again at any time."
"I thought this beer was smooth drinking yet still quite complex. Feel was creamy but not too thick or overpowering. It's good to find a full-bodied, complex and balanced beer without being loaded down with alcohol content."
"D - It's not a terrible beer. I'm also trying to factor age in with this. Bland though and unexciting. It washes down fine. Nothing to write home about either way."
"Overall I was really impressed by this beer as it contained a great amount of flavor while keeping the abv. extremely low. This is perfect sessionable American Stout. Recommended."
"D: Highly drinkable and this is the first beer I've had that I can say I really taste the claimed vanilla beans. Body is nice but not overwhelming and flavors work well together to create a very enjoyable experience."
"Cheers!"
"I say this because the stout I would mostly drink (until recently) is Ginness so I'm not as used to traditionally carbonated stouts."
"M&D- kinda silky, kinda smooth, but there is some hops in this fresh bottle making it entirely smooth. Medium bodied, lightly carbed, good taste. I would not mind having a six pack of this lying around from time to time. There are a few flavors here but they are all kinda light making for a easy drink with some character."
"Drinkability: Meh. Nothing special - nice smell, but the flavors are weak and I really prefer something much more robust in my stouts."
"Very laid-back, unassuming stout, but overall, pretty enjoyable."
"Pours black in the body with cinnamon head on top. Vanilla extract, vanilla beans, cream, some faint wheat characteristics in the nose. Taste of vanilla extract and cereal. Smooth, light body, slight sourness in the aftertaste. Enjoyable but not the greatest representation of the style. More like a little brother to the big American stouts that I love."
"Revisited this beer thanks to a generous throw in. Had to move this down from a 3.7 to a 3.5. Can't really pick up much oak other than the smoothing effect and a touch of vanilla. Extremely bland and lacking any character. Well brewed, with no off flavors, but completely undistinguished. Less flavor than a good dunkel or schwartz. Not bad, but definitely a training wheels stout."
"d - this is a great craft beer to keep around for the holidays. this beer emits balance but progressive craft flavors in a well crafted way. this is an extremely drinkable brew for craft aficionados and newbees alike. highly recommended."
"Drinkability: I was impressed by this beer. It managed to combine oak, chocolate, and vanilla in a near perfectly balanced drink. For something that's fairly low on alcohol, this is a fairly full-flavored beer. I would definitely seek this one out again."
"D - This was my first oak aged stout and I was really happy with it...the oak didn't stand out too much...I loved the chocolate malts and vanilla beans...I like that it was oak aged and not around 10%...being lighter in body helps with the drinkability as well"
"M/D - Medium bodied and very creamy feel. Easy drinking and very pleasant. Roastiness leaves a light bitterness behind."
"Flavor is pleasant. The roast and oak both create a nice dry taste. This is an easy to drink stout with nice roast & oak flavors, a bit of dark plum-y fruits and just enough hop bitterness to provide some balance. This isn't one of those assertive American stouts. It drinks more like a British or Irish stout with the additional complexity of the oak. The only flaw, given this style, is that the mouthfeel is a tad thin for me. A bit more dextrinous character would be nice. Otherwise, very nice & easy to drink."
"Easy drinker, nice stout with a twist, not too heavy. This is definitely worth seeking out."
"D: A mild stout, oak aged, and under 5.5%? Hard to believe. This one isn't a barrel aged behemoth, rather it is a complex stout that packs a lot of punch into a small package."
"D - This is one of the few stouts I could probably drink all night because of its incredible rich and smooth taste. One of the better stouts I've had - highly recommended."
"D - Very smooth and enjoyable. Very drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable considering the oak and bourbon are the prevalent flavors and the low abv for a barrel aged stout."
"D - Low alchohol and not so overbearing bitterness lend to a somewhat sessionable brew. But I wouldn't recommend overindulging. The sugar content lends to quite the hangover the next day. All in all a great little (formerly) local stout. On-tap that is."
"D - Respectable... Not great... Not bad... A very pedestrian stout... The low ABV of 5.2% and the attractive sticker price are positives, but not enough to make this anything other than a marginal stout... Overall this suffers from a lack a assertiveness and complexity..."
"It's a touch too roasty and charred for my tastes. I also think that the body could use a touch more 'oomph'. Still, it's drinkable, despite my minor, personal, quibbles."
"As an update to my on-tap review - this beer really suffers in the bottle. Aromas are crushed and flat, flavor is simply better than average. Nothing spectacular in the bottle. I was very disappointed when I bought some of this. Drink it on tap - the bottle doesn't do it justice."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a small tan head. Smells are big on the vanilla element, with a strong coffee roastiness. Taste is big on burnt wood and vanilla, with a chocolate truffle bittersweetness that is delectable. Body is too thin for my taste but overall this one tasty beer."
"Drinkability: While there are other stouts I prefer this is a pleasant enough stout to have again sometime and I certainly could see spending an evening with good friends, good conversation, and a few of these."
"D: On a cold autumn day, nothing warms up better than a good stout. Went through two bottles in a night and that was just the right amount."
"12 oz. bottle served in a tumbler glass. Pours a completely opaque black with about a finger of frothy light brown head that diminishes to a line around the top of the beer. Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, a hint of vanilla and wood. Flavor is what makes this one, roasted malts, vanilla, chocolate, and bitterness from the oak aging. Mouthfeel is on the higher side of medium, creamy, with a bitter finish that sticks around for a while. Good beer, lots of good flavors, very drinkable."
"Smells like roast, a lot like a porter. Beer is smooth to drink. Sweetish on the front end and finishes with some roast / bitterness from the grains. No hop bitterness or aroma at all. Cookie cutter stout. Not disagreeable."
"Deep dark black in color with nice khaki head, fades quickly but good lacing. Smell is of chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar and oak. Faint hints of coffee. Taste is more pronounced with vanilla extract, sweet brown sugar, oak and dark chocolate with coffee hints trailing. Silky smooth with a little aftertaste. Very good stout, but the vanilla begins to take over and can appear to be artificial."
"Easily drinkable and for sure a new handy beverage to have around the house."
"Drinkability - Relatively easy drinking stout."
"D: A nice, sessionable stout that offers a little more to keep things interesting."
"Had it on tap at Dulles airport in DC at the Old Dominion pub next to gate B14. Pours beautifully with a nice head. Slight sweetness with hints of vanilla and even a little chocolate. It is not overly bitter which makes it very easy to drink. It may be a little to sweet for some, but I am a big fan."
"All of that being said, this is still a respectable stout. The deep, dark brown color lets you know that some heavily roasted malts are in this selection. The aroma presents this dark malt sweetness with a hint of vanilla. The vanilla flavor is even more pronounced in the taste, seeming almost overly sweet and almost artificial at times. It is lightly carbonated and has an overall smooth mouthfeel. Despite my acknowledged bias, I have to admit that this is a decent stout that would be a nice (albeit unspectacular) addition to any beer-drinking session if only for the interesting balance of bittersweet dark malts and added vanilla and oak flavors."
"Notes: It is a nice and reliable stout. But neither the oak nor the vanilla beans are present in a very memorable manner. They are there subtly adding a hint to a bit of a thin stout for my linking."
"D: Nice to sip and admire the woody notes."
"Bought a 6 pack of this in Outer Banks, NC. Big vanilla/oak aromoa hits the nose right off the bat. This stout doesn't mess around. Coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, & chocolate make appearances in the taste. Quite complex & accessible. Mouthfeel is a touch watery, but other than that - this is a very tasty brew. Recommended."
"For some reason, I've always wanted to try this beer and after I've tried this beer on tap, I know why. It was an easy drinking Stout that wasn't all that heavy with bourbon and oak. If I saw this in a bottle shop, I'd probably buy one or two bottles."
"This might be my favorite stout now. The addition of vanilla and the oak add something special which I think would improve many stouts."
"The body is more on par with moderate. Finishes a bit dry, would like some more depth at the end. Carbonation is light but that is ok. Overall a great nose but the taste falls off. Would like more complexity that would linger into the finish. The lactic and esters are off setting, but the wood notes are really nice."
"I liked this beer but out of the bottle (most likely very fresh), this is a fantastic stout. If the brewpub was still around I would most likely order this every time it was available. It looks like the beers haven't gone downhill after being shifted to a new brewing location. Recommended."
"Overall not a great stout as it left me wanting more. After having a Founders Breakfast 2 days ago, this one just doesn't measure up. Sad."
"D - Pretty complex stout with a dominant roasty character, plenty of oak/woody notes, and some other subtle intricacies, resulting in a flavorful brew overall."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability, however it can fill you up fast"
"Not among the best stouts I've had and a bit disappointing for an oak aged vanilla stout."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint-glass an almost opaque black with some ruby highlights when held to light. The aroma is a slight amount of oak and roasted malts. The taste is a nice smooth oaked roasted malts with hints of cocoa and fresh ground coffee. The beer is quite light and smooth with decent carbonation, the lightness making the oakiness all that more noticeable. This is certainly an enjoyable beer."
"F (for FAILED)(note: I'm not prone to grade inflation, as in: ""This beer really sucked, it was thin, watery, with no character. A minus)"
"found this beer again hard to find in williamsport frist time i i had this i picking oak chips out of my mouth made me happy. pours a very black color i just love this color. taste a very nice bourbon oak and vanilla not much coffe taste its a good tasting beertonight i give a it a big drinkability tonight it just smells great i want to drink more of this beer"
"Pours near black with tints of cherry wood and a thin tan head. Nose has roasty malts, vanilla, oak, chocolate and coffee. Taste a bit mellow compared to the aroma. Dark malts with subtle vanilla and cocoa. Body is a bit thin and somewhat under carbonated."
"A solid, if not great, brew. Definitely not as good as it is on tap."
"Poured a jet black with a dirty tan head. Nose is full of roasted malt, coffee, and a hint of oak. Taste is full of cocoa, roasted malt, and molasses.Mouthfeel was nice and heavy, heavier than the bottle version and more complex. The bottle did not do this brew justice."
"Pours a pretty thin dark brown. Thin head quickly roils up to about a half inch, and quickly receeds. No cool lacing or anything like that. Smells like burnt bourbon, like a huge bourbon aged IS. It doesn't taste it at all, though. Faint oaking comes through, but it isn't overly roasty, and just a bit sweet. A bit of vanilla, maybe some coffee. A little light on flavor, and very light overall. That is the biggest flaw. It lacks gravitas, and it needs a lot more carbonation. It feels dead, like the lunar surface. Needs more carbonation to liven things up, right now it tastes almost flat. Very drinkable, though. This beer is a bit underwhelming, but it was worth the try."
"This is very light and drinkable for a stout. Mouthfeel is fairly well carbonated. Not too out of the ordinary or exciting but definitely a solid beer worth trying."
"This is a very tasty stout. Very drinkable, I am very pleased with this brew. It has a unique flavor and is very drinkable. Very much case worthy, to be enjoyed throughout the night."
"D- meh, not that impressed with this one. its nice to see what the effect of barrel aging has on a smaller beer, but i dont think ill be bending over backwards to try this ever again."
"Served on tap at the Arena Bar and Grill. Arrived in a nonic pint glass, this stout appears a deep dark brown color with about two fingers of creamy, lingering tan foam. Not much lacing to speak of here. The aroma and flavor are of rich roasted grains, both milk and bittersweet chocolate, oak chips, vanilla, mildly sour tannins, and a touch of dark fruit. Wonderfully smooth drinking and creamy with medium carbonation. A really nice and flavorful lower alcohol stout."
"I don't really pick up much at first, but after my palate adjusts, I taste roasted chocolate malts, some caramel sweetness, and a kiss of oak on the back of the palate. Earthy hops chime in for a quick ""hello", but not much else lingers in the aftertaste. Body is a bit over-carbonated and zesty for a stout (more porter-like in its mouthfeel) with a crisp medium body that borders on creamy. Overall, I found this to be a decent stout, but it doesn't quite live up to its ""barrel-aged"" stature."
"Unspectacular yet it has a few things to offer. Not the best of the many oak-aged stouts out there, but worth a shot. I think the label promises too much..."
"Very dark brown, almost black, with a medium-sized, khaki, frothy head with moderate retention. Smells of deep roasted malts. Chocolate, vanilla peat, wood and some light dark fruits. Taste-wise, wow the peat you right up front! Thick malts with vanilla and bitter chocolate. The hops are very subdued, just a little bit of bitterness on the finish, a bit lacking on the balance that the label brags about. It has a full body, lightly-syrupy-turning lightly-dry texture, and low carbonation. Interesting, but the smokey peat aroma and flavor are overdone and distracting."
"D: Fairly drinkable because of the light body. I think a better feel would make me like it even more, however."
"D :: The flavors are balanced and I could definitely enjoy a few of these. Again, a little thinner than I would like, but still good overall."
"This is a nice, low alcohol, easy to understand stout. While nothing exciting, it's still a pleasant, easy to enjoy stout. My guess is the airport is probably not the best place to enjoy this beer."
"M/D - Silky smooth. Thin on the palate. Little to no carbonation. The thinness makes this brew easy to drink but constrains complexity."
"Drinkability: I could easily session this. It has several complex flavors to it"
"D: This is a pretty darn accessible barrel brew. The flavors aren't over the top. I could use a little more body in this but it it enjoyable."
"I don't understand how this can get an A-. I'm wondering if I got a bad bottle somehow, too much CO2, overattenuated? I have a six pack, if I try again and it's different I'll update."
"D - Well-balanced, highly-drinkable stout. The vanilla adds a nice subtle complexity without being overpowering. Great roasted malt profile balanced with a the proper level of bitterness. I look forward to the enjoying the rest rest of the beer."
"This is a really tasty stout. I knocked it for a lack of head and watery feel, but the taste definitely makes up for it."
"Bottled on 11/07/09.I have sampled this beer a few times in the past,this is the first bottle I have had to myself.Poured into a bulb glass a deep dark but not opaque cola color with a minimal light mocha colored head atop.Aromas of vanilla/oak and dark coffee stand out most with just a hint of molasses as well.A little thin and prickly in the mouthfeel department but not overly annoying.Flavors are dominated by vanilla and heavy roast up front with a drying earthy,woodiness that comes thru in a long finish.Its a year and a half old but I dont think it matters much,a decent flavorful stout."
"D: Very drinkable. I could put a couple 2-3 of these away pretty easily. Not the best stout I've ever had, and not the worst. Not too shabby."
"-RR"
"A Valentine's Day treat from my wife, brought back from Virginia Beach. 12oz. bottle served in my DFH snifter. Bottled on 10/09/2008 indicated on the label. Poured one shade shy of black with a loose, khaki-colored head that quickly dissipates into a skim with a band of foam around the edges. Nose indicates vanilla, lactic acid and butterscotch. Taste consistent with nose, but very muted. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery with a light background carbonation and a slight acidity. Not bad, but somewhat lackluster."
"I had high hopes for Oak Barrel Stout, but am ultimately disappointed. It's definitely not a bad beer, but it has some glaring flaws. The carbonation is the biggest. The lack of any standout in flavor is the second. Overall, it's above average, but would need some work to reach the next level. It's worth a try, but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"D: Very drinkable, well not very drinkable, but maybe 2 of these to truly understand its complex flavors."
"Overall: The beer come across to me as plain but in another sense the beer is rather simple. The mouth feel is a medium body, not chewy, and a bit creamy. The finish is slightly bitter and dry, the beer lingers for a moment on the palate. The beer is good, but not great it needs more character and body."
"D: Would make an excellent session stout, though just a bit high on the ABV."
"Comes out of the tap a deep opaque sable with a fine-bubbled tan head. Strong aroma is smoky and coffee-ish, and slightly chocolaty. Rich flavor is like a good mocha and has a yeasty undertone, along with nutty and molasses hints. Texture is smooth and a little tingly."
"Would have this again, a very nice stout though slightly undistinguished."
"D- Not very drinkable in my opinion. Too much oak and a thinner than expected mouthfeel makes for a brew which, after one, is more than enough for me."
"The aroma is almost prototypical for the style. It has coffee, chocolate, burnt malt, and a hint of vanilla. The appearance is dark brown with a larger than average head for a stout. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is a tad thin but OK. Overall it's a decent stout."
"3/3/4/2/9 (2.1/5)"
"Overall, this is a great brew and thus far, a highlight in my beer journey, however limited that may be."
""
"Pours an opaque dark brown, almost black in color with a monster, loosely knit brown head leaving some soapy sticking on the glass. Monster head? Barrel aged? Oh wait a minute, only oak chips were used... There is a much larger citrusy hop profile in the nose that i had expected, faint notes of caramel malt and roasted chocolate. Light in body, hardly any chew going on, simple roasted chocolate malts and some hints at roasted coffee beans. The carbonation is insane, the way over-the-top carbonation hurts its body and mouth-feel. Subtle notes of vanilla, sweet wet wood and lemony sourness on the finish. This one was a disappointment. Maybe put the beer in a barrel next time?"
"Poured a perfect shade of black with a frothy, sleek one-finger head that was tan and then slowly died and left a ring around the glass. A light malt smell of roasted malts and sweet malts like caramel mixed with cocoa and coffee (and yes, oak). Medium-to-full bodied, really, REALLY, sweet and smooth creaminess. The beer is balanced with hints of dryness and although it goes down somewhat silky, it has a moderately dry backbone. Roasted, toffee, caramel, and chocolate malts all make their way in the taste. I could have this anytime."
"This one was a real treat. Part of my Dominion ""Rack Pack"" from TDL in ""the Burg."" Beautiful black(ish) color in the glass with a slight bit of foamy head (tan to gray). Roasted malt in the nose with a hint of (unless it's just because I read it on the label) vanilla. Taste is at first smoky malt, then sweet (though not too much so) roasted malt, with a bit of hops bitterness--just enough--warmed with a bit of that bourbon flavor from the oak barrels. A real treasure trove of mixed flavors that all work beautifully together. That's two-for-two from my pack. All keepers. I'm glad I have a couple more of each."
"Drinks better than average, albeit smokiness precludes extreme drinkability."
"Overall - Pretty decent stout."
"was slightly sweet, reminded me of a milk stout, but it was very tasty the oak and vanilla flavors were strong and it worked very well together to give a very drinkable complex stout that wasnt a sipper"
"This beer is awesome. Im pleased to see somebody making a bourbon stout that isnt 10%, kick you in the face-ful of flavor. Very well balanced, would love to have another of these guys."
"it pours up a black color with a dark cream colored head. the nose is slight metallic malts, slight vanilla bean. the taste is toasted malts, vanilla bean, slight oak, medium body, low carbo. Eh *shoulder shrug* a decent brew...."
"Overall: unique experience I was happy to have"
"M A little bit over carbonated for the style, but the creaminess sits well on the palate."
"Mouthfeel is quite nice; thick and almost creamy. What I would really expect from a stout. A very nice beer overall."
"D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is very light and this beer is creamier than most. I could see having a few of these over the course of an evening with no problems. If I had access to this beer I might even have it in my fridge from time to time. The vanilla in the aroma threw me off at first because it was so strong but after a few sips the vanilla is hard to even pick out. Glad I got the chance to try this one."
"Drinkability for me on this one is tarnished by the thin mouthfeel, I'd not want more than one of these as there isn't enough in it to make it more than a starter effort."
"Pours a very dark brown in color with a nice inch of foamy head sitting atop. Smell is very roasty. Plenty of coffee and vanilla from the oak barrel in the flavor. Very creamy and smooth on the palate. A very easy, good drinking beer. It's a shame what's going on with the brewery, but this will always be a good beer in my memories."
"Creamy mouthfeel. This was a real taste bud pleaser. Glad I picked up a sixer of this as I will be enjoying this all week."
"bottling date of 080808"
"D - Good. A great beer. Could have several but it's nice just to savor it."
"D: Very nice and easy to drink, I would buy again...."
"pours a thin dark reedish black and 3 fingers of head rose to the top of this one, the flavors are bitter chocklat and lightly roasted coffiee, then a smokey flavor takes over in the middle. the end is a bunch of hops and some strong vanilla that is in purfict ballance with the mild oak flavor that is the last sutle flavor you are left with after swallowing. this is a beer that i would drink tons of if i could get my hands on this one, i will savor every one of these that i am lucky to have in my posetion"
"The mouth is extremely silky, but thins out a bit in the end. It is easy to session. I'm glad I had a chance to try this one. Well done!"
"Neat interpretation of an American Stout. Might be a little light bodied balance wise, could use a bit more overall."
"Pours Very Black (like coke)and rich with a nice dark head. The smell and taste of oak is very noticeable. The beer has a very earthy smell and taste. It is a great beer for the price. May be my favorite beer in this category. It is a great bridge beer between lighter beers and hard core stouts. I hope AB INC's marketing takes this beer to more markets to show it's true potential."
"D- Really easy to drink"
"D - A very good stout; tastes like it'd pair well with a good steak. I can definately see myself drinking a couple in a session."
"Very dark, near-black brown color under a solid brown head. Bold, sweet malty aroma...brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate, and cake-batter. Semi-sweet chocolate chip and vanilla flavors. Yummy. Not the most complex stout in the world and actually kind of thin in the middle...but there are some tasty flavors in there. It's kind of confusing. Slightly watery, but flavorful. Medium bodied, goes down easy enough. I'll get it again, but I feel like with a couple tweaks, it could be great."
"D: An above-average stout that blends sweet flavors with an appropriately dry finish that hits the American/sweet stout style pretty well."
"D: Fairly easy to drink considering the complexity at work. This one has a lot of character, and is one of the more interesting beers I've had in a while."
"This is a great American stout, and the solid mouthfeel and flavor make it one to be enjoyed slowly. Hmm, this is very good with vanilla ice cream!"
"Drinkability very Drinkable for a stout, Icould drink 4 or 5."
"My review may have sounded a little harsh but this is a solid beer. I just expected a little more. I would have loved to see more of the vanilla and any oak. I did enjoy the glass though. Thanks again Bill!"
"Drinkability: A really solid stout, and locally brewed as well. A good go-to beer, refreshing and inexpensive - recommended."
"10/8/2004. Black color with a relatively thick tan head and a little staying power for lacing. Strong coffee and malty aroma. Coffee flavor with roasted malts and a definite woody oak taste. Nicely balanced and a well-rounded stout. Definitely easy drinking too for the style. Solid."
"d - woohoo virginia. I picked this up randomly at the grocery store which made me think it wasn't going to be that great. I'm glad I was wrong. This beer is a little too complex for me to pick everything out, but it tastes so well rounded and delicious. This beer seems to be backwards from what I usually experience as it was kind if astringent/bitter at first and finished sweet. The bourbon barrel process gives it the taste of a much higher alcohol beer. Very interesting. I will definitely get this one again."
"Got lucky enough to get stuck at BWI airport in Baltimore and went to Ram's Head. Tried the Copperhead first and liked it. Next I tried this wonderful stout. Extremely smooth and very flavorful. Of course the malts were just right. Each drink left that leveled effect that the commercials are telling about. I hope to get stuck at BWI again soon."
"Overall a unique, balanced and somewhat complex brew, though not too complex to keep someone familiar with stouts from downing more than one, though the smokiness may hold some back from swilling another."
"M/D: Full bodied, very smooth. Extremely drinkable. 5.2% but has all the makings of a big beer with out any of them overshadowing the beer. Really a good brew."
"This robust black stout sports a great tan-colored head that has very good retention, and leaves a nice lacing. This is also a rather complex stout, with a coffee nose evolving into a chocolate malt flavor on the palate. The mouthfeel is moderately thick, though many stouts this flavorful are a bit heavier in the mouth. This one is lightened even more by a carbonation level that is a bit higher than most stouts, but makes the drink refreshing. Combined with this, the subtle hop bitterness in the finish gives it a crisp finale."
"The oak, the vanilla, and the roast malt are all in perfect proportion. The brewers have struck a harmony between the creaminess and the roast, the bitter and the sweet. Dominion's Oak Barrel Stout is a beverage that is all those things at once, and that is something of a marvel. A delicious, delicious flavoured marvel. The brewers have listed this on the label as their ""little treasure"". Indeed it is, and I owe a big thanks to IDatetheFormula for sending me this gem!"
"M/D: Low carbonation and it was rich, creamy and smooth, so it was highly drinkable. Overall, if I could find this beer in Atlanta, it would probably become a stable in my fridge. Excellent beer. Highly recommend."
"Overall - very drinkable, especially for stout lovers. Not extreme, not super hoppy, not over-the-top, but an enjoyable brew - I'd have another if made available again."
"D: Drinks very easy for a stout, nice complex flavor. Would serve this with a dessert."
"The beer poured an ink-black with a thick, tan head into a pint glass. The aroma was of roasted barley/burnt toast, with a hint of hops. The taste was a big roasted barley and burnt toast combination, slightly astringent, with black patent malt and hop bitterness at the finish. Excellent lacing down the sides of the glass, with low carbonation. I really enjoyed this stout, and most of the other Old Dominion offerings as well."
"D - Really not your typical stout but I really like it. If the mouthfeel were heavier this might become too sweet and dessert like. Not the malty flavors of normal stouts but it works. This isn't a beer I think I would typically like but every one I have gets better and better."
"D- Rather drinkable, an old friend I hadn't had in a few years."
"Dominion is a solid beer that manages to integrate barrel-aging pretty well."
"D. Very drinkable, excellent for sessions."
"An interesting stout, worthwhile."
"M + D: Quite nice... the bourbon flavours didn't stand out like I might have thought, but it's still there. Carbonation sizzle over the tongue was kept to a minimum, and suited the brew... quite smooth, silky, and amazingly refreshing, though I still wouldn't drink the style as any sort of thirst quencher! A very nice release from Old Dominion - though I find it very unusual that this isn't available here in Charlottesville! It MIGHT be worth the drive to Richmond."
"This one was a little too thin for me. I've not had it fresh, but it was a little underwhelming with a year on it. Not bad by any means, but not what I was expecting from this one."
"Smells outstanding poured directly from the bottle. Slightly sweet and quite toasted. The head disappears quite quickly leaving a dark pleasing baking chocolate color beer. This great start is somewhat let down once you get the beer into your mouth however. The prominent toasty oakiness in the smell is very subtle in the flavor which is lighter than many beers in this style and flees the pallet quite abruptly. The negligable mouthfeel and aftertaste makes this beer easy to drink which I guess is a plus. It's not bad but I won't be recommending it to anyone who is looking for an oak aged stout."
"Overall- Haven't had 1 of these in a few years and finally got around to reviewing. Solid and easily drinkable. Still as good as I remembered."
"An inch and a half of thick creamy foam head is a milk chocolate brown that fades to just a skim as I finish this sentence. Body is a usuall suspect jet oil black. Nose is very big with luscious roasty and carmalized malt tones jumping at the senses. Yeasty rich alchol notes also tingle within the nose. On first sip you get a mix of sour and glazing bitter richness which is all up front. There is a carmalized malt feel that draws out nicely on the palate. Brief vanilla notes are found if you search. The soured feel does calm down a bit with warmth but is consistant throughout then more noticeable again on the finish and mouthfeel. The carmalized malt shows itself again a bit on the finish. Don't really get any oak in this one. Kind of a let down fot the style."
"Overall a very solid beer-would buy again."
"A lot of people love this beer. To me (and others agreed), it tasted like half Guinness and half whiskey. The Guinness taste is, of course, because it's a stout. And the whiskey flavor is due to the oak barrel. This is great for those who enjoy whiskey, but I simply don't enjoy that flavor. So this beer just isn't for me."
"Had the privilege of sampling this beverage at happy hour in DC. Poured a deep brown with red edges and formed a light beige head. Mild lacing. The nose was chocolate, toffee, coffee, vanilla, toasted malt, and light hops and oak. The flavor was primarily light cafe mocha, and the finish was a mixture of hops and toasty malt that sat very well. Mouthfeel was a tad lighter than I would have liked, but this stout's lighter body and modest carbonation made it a very smooth drink that I could enjoy for an extended period."
"Another homerun from dsigmon ... Brock thanks again ... exceptional and very generous extra."
"Black with a beige head that quickly recedes to a a ring around the glass. Smell gives me quite a bit of roast and some cherries. Upon further agitation of the glass, I got a little bit of a malted milk ball aroma; really don't think I picked out vanilla. Taste is a bit roasty at the beginning, but then I get a much more creamy taste that comes through. Again, I don't know that I would have specifically picked out vanilla if I didn't know it was used. Medium carbonation and body is a little less than medium. Thanks to dsigmon for the sample!"
"Overall, I expected more. The head completely dissapeared 1/2 way through and the flatness prevailed. I didn't sense any of the vanilla in the taste either which I would've liked. I would drink this again but not back to back. I'll pair one bottle with food next time."
"D - Pretty good, very tasty and balanced, I could actually do several of these. Impressive, and definitely worth a try."
"Pours very dark with a darker tannish head. Nose is a touch of wood and not a whole lot else going with it. The first hit of flavor gave cause for concern. But then it ended up being not so bad. However, the flavor profile is a bit acidic and citric in nature that makes it kind of leaning towards an not so loved realm. It isn't bad, but there is just this edge that I personally don't like. And the feel is a bit thin on the liquid. Carbonation is kind of low too. It is nice to drink, but I don't really see how an oak barrel has really done anything for this beer."
"The beer poured a rich dark amber with a tan head. The aroma was of coffee and malt. The taste carried this straight over and was ver y rich coffee and malt. The feel was medium and dry. I found this to be a real nice bitter stout, they did a good job with the hops so that the bitterness seemed to be strictly from the coffee malt."
"Pours almost pitch black except for some reddish around the edges when the light hits. A small thin head of cocoa colored suds quickly dissipates into a thin ring. The aromas of ground coffee and vanilla mix well. Taste of toasted malt and a touch of vanilla with some hop bitterness in the background. Finishes dry. A surprisingly thin body and fairly low ABV for this style. Which also makes this a good session beer."
"Medium bodied, a little thinner than expected. Very smooth. Easy drinking stout and just complex enough. Not the best stout out there, but pretty solid. A nice and interesting session stout."
"d - good sipper."
"This beer pours out of the bottle like motor oil.Minimal head and carbonation.Pleasant aroma of burnt oak chips and a wisp of vanilla.Taste is also pleasant with the same oak chips and vanilla.This is something I would buy again but I doubt I could drink more than 3 at one sitting."
"D = It's hard for me to rate this too much above average. I did enjoy it, but not sure I will rush out to buy it again. If you were in the mood for a lighter tasting stout, this would serve fine."
"D: Likable stout with a few weaknesses, most of which (I'm guessing) are due to age. I have another of these to try, however it's just a couple months younger. I like the vanilla and oak and I like the direction this beer is going; it makes for a drinkable stout with a nice, dessert-like twist. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is light and a bit thin. Very drinkable, and possibly the most drinkable oaked beer I've ever come across. I enjoyed it. Get some Old Dominion Oak Stout on a cold night and it'll see ya through."
"D - I love stouts but this is really nice for a change of pace. The vanilla flavor is nice, but I really enjoyed the oak taste, they really compliment each other well. I could drink this beer all night long."
"Classic dark black body. It could have used a little more head. The smell is wicked powerful. There is a ton of vanilla and a light malt presence. IMO the vanilla is too strong. It should complement the aroma, not dominate it. The flavor about half as strong as the aroma but the dominant flavor is sour. There are some dark malt flavors and an acidic aftertaste. The flavor is pretty thin and the mouthfeel is medium light. I was pretty excited about this beer initially but it is a bit of a let down."
"This beer is very drinkable as is. To me it would be even greater if it were smoother and more full."
"This beer is not much like Guinness because it lacks the strong burnt coffee and salty components of Guinness, which may be a plus or a minus depending on how much you like the Irish icon. Oak Barrel is a good stout, pleasant and inoffensive. I would enjoy it again, though it does not rank among the leading American stouts in my opinion."
"The taste has all sorts of flavours going on. Lots of vanilla and bourbon and wood with helpings of chocolate, roasted malt, a slight citrus bitterness in the background and it finishes witha nice hot cocoa bitter bite but..it's smooth as all hell and it doesn't hurt that it's only 5.2%abv; it makes it sessionable as hell. lol Man, is this son of a gun drinkable and velvety smooth. Great fullish mouthfeel and it's lightly carbonated. I like this one a lot!! Lots of flavour, easy to drink, smooth, this has it all going on. I'd get this one again, no problem."
"Overall: An excellent brew, top notch. The ABV's only 5.2%, which would make this a great session beer for a cold winter's night. Highly recommended, if you see this around grab it immediately."
"Pours pure black with a couple fingers of quickly fading head. Smells of oaky vanilla, roasted coffee beans and some chocolate. Tastes bigger on coffee then I thought it would. Vanilla and oak make a presence but no bourbon, which I actually like. Finishes a little sweet and bitter like bakers chocolate. Medium in the mouth and outstanding drikability."
"It poured a dark handsome shade of black. It had a slight malty aroma nothing over powering. Its a dark beer but not too heavy, and what sets it apart for me is that vanilla mouth feel and after taste. The drinkabilty is through the roof. If this were any higher in abv it could be really dangerous... damn I could use another!"
"Very nice beer when you want a stout with a little extra something. It pours with a nice, foamy head. It has a nice dark appearance. It has a wonderful smell, a strong coffee scent with definite hints of vanilla. Goes down nice and has an excellent additional 'oaky' flavor. You can definitely tell the beer has had some contact with bourbon oak barrels. While it's not my favorite, it's definitely a distinct stout with a great taste."
"Drinkability: This is a nice stout that is a bit unique in the flavor profile. With alcohol level at 5% ABV this is a nice session stout for me."
"Thanks to nacir69 for this one!"
"Pours dark brown with a tan head of about 1/2 a finger (disappointing head), smells of coffee with a nice woodsy aftertaste. Tastes like sweetened coffee, alcohol completely undetectable in the flavor. Leaves the mouth feeling dry, clean, and refreshed. Not too thick, but not watery - just about right in texture. Has a distinct bitterness that is strong, but in a very pleasant way - probably offset by the sweetness. Much easier to drink than most stouts, partly because the mouthfeel isn't as coating and the fact that it is not as heavy. Goes down smooth."
"Pours a solid black color with a tan head. Aromas of subtle oak and vanilla are in the air. In the taste, chocolate and somewhat like mocha. An aftertaste that is a bit dry and leaves a coffee presence in the mouth. A lighter body than most stouts. A nice flavorful stout, I enjoyed the coffee/mocha/ vanilla flavor for dessert."
"Pretty drinkable, but could be more complex and rely on the oak less."
"Hmm, I hope I didn't get a bad bottle. I'll look for it again and give it another try."
"Despite it's weight this beer is delicious enough to have a few."
"Alright I had some high hopes for this one, but it did not really pan out as I had hoped. Pour was uneventful, thick black oil like, with no real head. Decent lacing throughout. Smell was very full, lots of oak, and bourbon aromas, and the vanilla is unmistakable, in fact pretty much over powering. First impression was not pleasant, it was vanilla overload for me, nad what the vanilla didn't kill the oak took care of later. Not enough carbonation left it feeling utterly flat and uneventful. Really had a rough time getting all of this down as the vanilla and oak were just overdone and killing it for me. Overall nah, I am good. I normally like oak aged beers, but this was overdone for sure and just not that pleasant"
"Mouthfeel is bit on the thin side for a stout, but the drinkability is pretty darn good."
"Since this brewery seems to be affiliated with A-B now (didn't know until I came to review it) maybe I can find it again easily... would love a case of this for the Fall/Winter."
"Thanks JNN4V!"
"This is just a solid across the board brew. It hits you with good flavour and is a nice easy drinking beer. Having a barrel aged brew that does not smack you in the head with a strong bourbon presence was a nice touch as well, and one I'd like to see more of from other breweries, as it provides for a bit more complexity without being overpowering and still remaining fairly straightforward. Good stuff overall."
"Overall, this selection left a bit to be desired. Smooth and a slightly creamy but bit light and mild for my taste in stouts. A solid beer."
"D - Good for a Stout, Very Mild, but flavorful"
"Gifted to me by shivtim, who liked this so much on tap that he brought me a bottle back from D.C. Pours very dark brown with a thin little head which is more of a thin little ring of bubbles than anything. Kind of unexciting-looking, esp. considering the name. Odor is strongly of chocolate with hints of vanilla and bourbon. Also some toasty notes. The vanilla odor worries me and for the first time i notice that this is aged with vanilla beans. Taste is heavy on the vanilla up front, with a transition to a toasty roated malt and chocolate. Alcohol is present in a slumbering bourbon quality and the vanilla is a beany ice-cream vanilla rather than a a fake ""vanilla flavoring"" one. Still, like a lot of vanilla-tinged beers, its very freaking distracting and i wish it wasn't there so i could just concentrate on the ""bourbon"" and ""stout"" parts of the beer. Also a little watery for the style, but well balanced. Not my favorite beer in the world, but im sure its better on tap. Thanks Paul."
"Served up on tap, came cascading. Beautiful. It's deep ruby brown, with a giant foamy tan head that settles into place. The nose is sweet toasted malts and creamy coffee. Taste is smoky malts with hints of earthy fruits and sweet white vanilla frosting on the end. Mouthfeel is good and full. Drinkability is up there. Great brew."
"This is one of my favorites, and actually one that I enjoy drinking in the warmer months when my thrist for stouts typically declines. Much more complex and balanced than some of the highly hyped imperial stouts, and certainly sessionable. Seek this one out."
"D: Very complex for a smaller stout. Very well balanced and highly drinkable. Recommended."
"I was not a big fan of this beer. The vanilla sweetness up front lingered and dominated the flavor too much. It's a nice attempt at a relatively low ABV beer with alot of taste..."
"Poured out a near black with a thin tan head that dissipated into nothing. The nose offered strong malt notes accompanied by light smoke, bbq, hickory, and mollasses. The taste had some nice malt, smoke, mollasses, and maple syrup flavors, but everything fell a bit short. Has a very light body and clean finish, more reminiscent of a porter than a stout and not satisfying at all. Granted, this is a beer you can drink a lot of without getting sick, something most aoked beers can't claim, but at the end of the day it starts off with promise and then falls flat."
"D: Highly sessionable stout.I enjoyed this very much.Kinda reminds me of a beer that I had in Ireland,...Beamish."
"A lot of complexity goes into each different flavor aspect, and truly rounds together for an outstanding Stout experience."
"D- this is a very drinkable stout with a great character"
"Good beverage. Not really a standout for me."
"A pretty flavorful vanilla stout."
"It is drinkable but would not be my choice."
"D - I can do a bunch of these. The flavors meld together well and one doesn't overpower the other. The lighter ABV allows you to have a few. Could use a bit more oak flavor but I'd still go for this one again."
"Recommended"
"Poured a mostly opaque black with some brown showing aroune the edges. No head and no lacing. The smell is mostly lightly scented with vanilla and a touch of grain. The flavor is very smooth and light with some light roastiness and detectable vanilla, but not a lot more going on. Very, very smooth mouthfeel- you could just suck this down like a glass of milk. Not the most interesting stout in the world, but refreshing for the style."
"Call it an odd experiment, but every once in a while something wierd like this actually pays off."
"Mouthfeel was surprisingly thin for the style. You could do much worse, but I had such high expectations for this being a stout and having had oak chips and vanilla beans ""marinating"" in it. I'll definitely drink the other five, but I won't be rushing out to spen another $7,99 on another six."
"D - Even though the mouthfeel is pretty awful, somehow this beer remains drinkable. As long as you are drinking it, the gumminess doesn't bother you or the slightly drying aspect. The flavor itself is complex and devoid of sweetness. I really enjoyed this one. I might have it again."
"Cheers"
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice fizzy tan head, nice little oil spills and lacing follow. The nose is of slightly roasted sweet malts, lots of vanilla, and some coffee/caramel. The taste is sweet, vanilla, and a nice touch of coffee/caramel. This stout is quite different to me than other's I've had so far, sweeter, and more vanilla in there. Medium body. Very drinkable, highly recommended."
"At 5.2%, this one's a quaffer. Not as good as I was hoping with a chocolate desert. Would be nice to be able to get something like this for happy hour."
"One of the more impressive stouts I've had in a while which admittedly isn't many. I don't really get a lot of of the oak character but it's tasty all gimmicks aside."
"drinkability: good"
"Thanks for the chance MuenchenerKindl."
"To preface this accordingly, I must say that I'm a fan of the Old Dominion brews. I live in Washington, DC and visit the brewery once every 2-3 months for sixtels and pony kegs. Their beers are good, not great, and the customer service at their brewpup is subpar (most of the waitstaff is clueless, and the bartenders appear to be idiots), but I like what they do, so I keep going back. The Oak Barrel Stout pours a deep rich reddish black with a thin head. Not much foam or lace to speak of. But the aroma is what captures you. Strong vanilla scent, with some chocolate, some caramel, and a woody overtone. The taste is just as nice, with the vanilla present again, as well as some bitter coffee, and a hint of citrus in the finish, which is unusual for a stout of this nature, but present nonetheless. Mouthfeel is a bit weak. Overall, I like the Oak Barrel, mostly because it presents a formidable opponent to some lesser stouts out there. The problem is that you can't find it everywhere. So you're stuck drinking inferior stouts until Old Dominion can get distribution wider-spread."
"A very creamy mouthfeel, like drinking a nitrogenated beer.Light and airee feeling,goes down nice and easy, just not a beer I would want to drink all night long. A beer that's worth a try."
"Bigger would be better!"
"(I have had this beer several times in the bottle and on tap and never know what to expect - sometimes great and sometimes disappointing. This was a great bottle - bottled 7/19/2006.)"
"The pour into my Fuller's nonic raises a very thin, dark tan glass ring over a not-quite-opaque black beer. Lacing is minimal. Nothing impressive here. The nose is where the fun begins: definite oak, vanilla, and chocolate coming through. Not very intense, but lovely. The taste is fairly dry throughout, but has a very strong caramel/vanilla presence, which is more potent than the traditional stout flavors, which hide in the background. It has a lingering aftertaste that is essentially the same - no complaints! This beer has quite the thick consistency, with a lot of carbonation for a stout. I guess that helps to lighten it up a little. I will definitely reach for this beer the next time I can get some!"
"A nice drinking stout. That 5.2 goes down like nothing."
"Dark, oily, black at the core, dark brown edges. Small, light khaki head. Definite oak, oak chips, vanilla, roasted malt, sweet chocolate, creme brulee, caramel, and bourbon. Nice, complex aroma. Taste is similar, but a bit muted. Roasted malt bitterness up front. Oaky, peaty, earthy malt sweetness changes to vanilla and chocolate sweetness. Moderate body (a bit light for the style perhaps) with plenty of carbonation. I like."
"worth seeking out for stout fans, and a great session beer for the winter!"
"Overall, this is an enjoyable brew. I however, was expecting a bit more of a filling beer. Not to say it wasn't good but not quite what I was expecting."
"One for the ages, I am blown away."
"D: Very tasty, very easy-to-drink, slightly filling, this is a good beer to sit and relax with."
"Received in a recent trade from BA nriech, bottled on July 19 2006. Pours a deeply dark chocolate brown, almost black, with a rather thin light mocha head. Roasty black malt aromas mix with a faint vanilla sweetness. Some coffee undertones and a bit of earthy hops appear as well, but overall the nose is surprisingly restrained, since this is served at just about cellar temperature and no colder. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing. Meaning: It's not overpoweringly vanilla-scented, but I'm not all that excited by the nose either. Okay, the taste helps me decide: the nose is good. Regarding the flavor, the vanilla sweetness and the roasted malt characteristics mentioned above really come forward in the taste, but not too forcefully in either respect. They are quite well balanced, in fact. A dry oakiness is also present in the taste, lingering for a while afterwards, lending a vinous aspect to the finish. Slight carbonation, a bit slippery in the mouthfeel, leaning towards a velvet smoothness. Medium body. Not the dryest stout in the world. I like mine to be pretty heavy on the roasty side of things, and the vanilla beans prevent that from really taking over in this beer. But it's got a very compelling flavor profile nevertheless. I'd like to try this on tap someday as I get the feeling it might be a little more exciting that way. Easily sessionable, as long as you don't mind a slight, persistent vanilla flavor in stouts."
"D - goes down very easy."
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink."
"D: One of the only stouts I could describe as light and refreshing. You could easily drink this in summer--in fact, better than in winter. Not so much stout, as slightly husky."
"This beer pours a dark black with hints of red lace with a smallish tan head that disspates to just some whisps of foam with a decent amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The smell is roasted malts with hints of vanilla and wood. The taste is up front with the roasted and black malts. Again the vanilla and wood make a lingering presence here. The mouthfeel is rather thin but not bad on carbonation. Overall a good stout, but not one I was so thrilled with I'd like to get over and over again."
"Overall: A delicious brew that exhibits a complex flavor profile. Nicely done carbonation. If the appearance were a little better this one would be tops. The flavor is top notch nonetheless. Definately worth a try and at the ABV, a few can be had."
"The beer poured a very dark brown with a finger of tan, soda like head. The nose was dark malts and strong vanilla tones. A very nice aroma on this beer. The flavor of a distinct, mellow dark maltiness to start that mellowed into a vanilla and then lightly oaky flavor after the swallow. It's a medium bodied beer, but incredibly drinkable, and a stout that I wish were available here in Jacksonville."
"Overall: Thanks go out to HimerMan for this great beer. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to try this beer. Thanks also for a great trade."
"Poured to a typical stout opaque-black, with thick tan head that lingers and then leaves good lacing. I couldnt detect much aroma, but the flavor was a tasty mix of vanilla with a hint of malty chocolate. Finish was very smooth, yet not too sweet. I generally dont consider stouts for session beers, but could actually see drinking several of these over a few hours. A darn good beer."
"Pours a nearly opaque black/brown with just a hint of light penetrating the edges. Thin head of small brown bubbles. Aroma is mostly coffee. Just a hint Bourbon and vanilla. Taste is dominated by vanilla, maybe just a bit too much. I dont get any coffee in the taste, just vanilla with hints of dark chocolate and just a dash of bourbon. The dash of Bourbon is perfect in my opinion. Not overdone, just an accent. Creamy texture. Aftertaste long and mild. Burnt grains and a touch of bitterness. Impressive. This is one case where the bottled version wins out. I have had this on draft before and I dont recall it being as complex and creamy. Grade A stout. One I will keep in rotation in the coming months."
"Cheers."
"This is truly a great one."
"I love all stouts. Most have a coffee like finish as a result of the roasted malts, but this is an exceptionally smooth beer. It is one of my favorites. My only regret is that I live 1200 miles away from the source!"
"Cheers!"
"Very drinkable brew that I'd highly recommend."
"D: Not bad but the flavors seemed a little fake. Its very obvious that this isn't aged in bourbon barrels but oak chips and vanilla beans are used. Certainly drinkable but not stellar."
"This was interesting, to say the least. The beer really picked up the wood flavors, almost to the point of overkill. Again, it isn't a bad beer by any means. But it's not something I'd want to order over and over, either. Good for what it is, and worth at least a shot."
"I had this brew from a nitro-tap, wile traveling in Arlington,VA. Its an incredibly black liquid with a unremarkable nitro-induced head. The aroma is of highly roasted barley mingled with a subtler smoke quality. Theres also a bit of chocolate, wood, and malt in the smell. Id expected the aromas to be a little more intense, but their somewhat faint. The taste has an initial modest sweetness, but quickly dries out in the mid-taste. Nice bitterness in the finish. The medium fullness and very smooth (nitrogen) body make this very drinkable. All in all, this ones not bad."
"this is an interesting treat of a stout."
"Not much head when I poured it, what was there quickly turned to caramel lace over a typical dark stout-black brew. No matter, the beer held a strong aroma throughout the drink. At room temperature, it is fantastic. Forget the black forest cake, this beer is dessert in itself."
"While not especially assertive, at least initially, it is still a very enjoyable, classy stout. The smokiness is kept tame but capable, and that's a pleasing touch in my mind. As it rounds out, the flavor is full and crisp in its way. The manageable ABV and rather refreshing nature make this nicely drinkable, with multiple indulgences virtually guaranteed. I'm glad I got the chance to try, and now I'm looking forward to my next opportunity."
"For a stout, incredibly drinkable. Not too thick, and the flavour is so incredibly enjoyable I always find myself reaching for another. Lower the carbonation levels and this would easily be a 5 for me. All in all a fantastic beer."
"Beautiful roasted, burnt aroma and black as night with slight browning around the edges when held up to light. Glides down your throat like soft silk, temping you with flavors of vanilla oak and dark malt. This beer is sweet like dark chocolate and complex enough to sit and savor, but not overly so. Good stuff Old Dominion!"
"A coffee component comes into play in the taste. Like a latte, heavy cream, choclate covered cherry, good wood integration, and a finish of at least 45 seconds. Drinkable as hell if not a tad to sweet."
"I felt this was an ok blended stout. Not the best and certainly not the worst."
"This a very light and easy beer for the style with a just a fantastic smoke/oak blend."
"One of my favorite beers. Appearance? Like most Dry Stouts, but then the aromas of vanilla and rum, the creamy mouthfeel (nitro) and flavors of dry roast layered with vanilla, and that rummy sweet bourbon note befuddle my brain, and I become silent; secretly hating everyone else in the room that doesn't have one in front of them. The bottled and keg version for sale outside the brewery is purely criminal - no good."
"The taste was much of the same, with a great complexity and balance between sweet and bitter tastes, chocolate and sweet cream. The motufeel was very good as well, a sweetness and creamy smoothness balanced by alcohol and mild bitterness. Wonderful and wonderfully drinkable too. Hats off to Old Dominion."
"oh sorry... As I was saying this beer is +++ with no real - It's drinkable and I like it. MK"
"This stout had a dark brown color with a very small head that dissipated quickly. It had a medium malt aroma with the slightest hint of vanilla in it. The taste was well-balanced with a medium body (for a stout) and a medium hop bitterness that wasn't too strong but seemed just right. The mouthfeel was medium/thick with medium/low carbonation. I felt that for a stout, this was a very drinkable beer and it went down easy. I would gladly have another and I feel this was an all-around good beer. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability & Notes: Although the bourbon aftertaste makes you think it have a higher abv level, it doesn't. No more or less drinkable than most stouts I've had. And yet it is a great light stout. The bourbon and vanilla are at a perfect level (not at all overwhelming, but supplement the other stout flavours well). Great smell with some unique linguiring flavours."
"Interesting brew in that it has the complex mix of flavors of a ""big"" beer... but isnt. Pours with a syrupy smell of vanilla and a bit of maple. When in the glass, theres a brown spongy head over a ruby to black body. Taste is of a dry stout, but well mellowed with a trace of smoke and coffee. Vanilla is in just the right proportion to be a ""part"" of the beer instead of making it a ""flavored"" beer, if you get my meaning. Very light oakiness helps smooth out the brew, too."
"12 oz., bottled on 2/9/06 - fermented with vanilla beans and oak chips. I served this one in a chalice. It pours black with dark brown tinges on the edges and a thin espresso head of medium bubbles, leaving some spots of lace. It smells very roasted, with tobacco juice, chocolate, lots of floral/spicy, almost citric hops, and a big vanilla profile that mixes well into the bouquet. There are flavors of oak and vanilla right away with chocolate, roasted malts, tobacco, charred wood?, and some dark fruit notes. Delicious. It has a medium to thick body that leaves a long finish and drinks very easily. A damn fine stout."
"Overall a very drinkable Stout with some interesting flavors that make this a worthwhile try."
"Mouthfeel is substantial, silky, and fairly thick. Drinkability is good."
"Dark brown color, with a small tan head. Rich malt aroma, with hints of fudge, coffee and chocolate (brownies), light aromatic hops, hints of vanilla and a light hint of oak. Pretty subtle and gentle overall, with a roasted coffee, vanilla bean, chocolate, hops and a light hint of toasted oak. Not as good as I was expecting."
"not sure if this bottle is touched or what, but this is not a complex or exceptional on the taste end."
"This is a beer that I could have just sat and smelled and smelled and smelled. It poured a beautiful black chocolate with a thin white, not tan, head. Taking a whiff of the beer was like waking up after camping to the smell of rain-soaked charred oak campfire logs--it was a subdued smokey-oaky scent. It was heavenly. In comparison, the flavor and mouthfeel were thin and a bit of a let-down. I could taste the classic stout malts that resemble the acidic bitterness in coffee, but there was not much more there. Nevertheless, the aroma kept me coming back for more."
"Very creamy and overall a great beer. I had this as part of the Beer of the month a while back and then again at Eulogy in Philadelphia PA. Pours nice and smells great. I have not been able to find any in NJ or PA to pick up a case. The vanilla finish is great."
"I was surprised to see this on the menu at Summits in Sandy Springs. Personally, I really love the oak/bourbon style of stouts. The aroma was very oaky, but not overpowering. Thhis was very easy to drink; very creamy with minimal carbonation. I hope that I can find some of this in a bottle. I could drink a lot of these on a cold winter day."
"Appeared an opaque, viscous black color with a soft, tan colored head that didn't remain but left behind some nice lacing. Aromas of wood, alcohol, vanilla, and roasted sugar seemed to come out very nicely. The taste was just an explosion of sweetness with a roasted/smoky character upfront and a honey & vanilla finish. The flavors of this beer on-tap are much more prominent and aggressive than in the bottled verison which is much much more subtle and gentle. The dominating flavors work very well together and generate a lingering sweetness that feels more like root beer or an ice cream float than a stout. I felt my tongue coated after every sip with an almost bready/chewy texture. So rich and so smooth I could have this all day, though eventually the sweetness might rot my teeth."
"Music: Luomo - Tessio (Moonbootica Radio Edit)"
"Not bad, but not great. Just different."
"Pleasant and tasty stout with a very moderate alcohol level. As close to a session beer as stouts ever really get."
"Very dark brown with a short, medium tan head. Quickly reduced to a ring and left a bit of spotty lace behind. Lots of malt and chocolate covered cherries in the aroma. Mild roast and vanilla. Same malt character in the flavour, but with chocolate in front. Slightly acidic with muted cherry and weak vanilla. There's a bit of woodiness in the finish. Soft carbonation and silky texture with some lingering dryness. Medium bodied. Solid beer, but I think I was expecting more from the advertised vanilla and oak. Thanks northyorksammy!"
"D- This beer has a nice character with a good quality stout that is enhanced by the wood and vanilla. They are not to strong and not to soft. Very nice beer."
"Mouthfeel is a tad thin, but the carbonation is where I enjoy it and it is easily consumed with a fairly low abv (for me)...would love to try this one on cask, as the oak age flavors are nice but would really shine as a real ale IMO."
"Overall, it was hard to score this stout because the middle scores imply ""average," which this wasn't. But the rummy oak flavor kind of clobbered everything else, and I couldn't really give it many more points on that account."
"Again, I ask you... what is NOT to be chipper about?!"
"A delicious brew that I will drink again. It could even be a session brew."
"I did not like this beer."
"This is my favorite stout, and is very drinkable and complex. A work of art."
"Rich and full bodied, this beer is delicious and at only 5% is very sessionable and complex. The drink by dat is April 2004. Disregard that, this beer is very cellarable. Excellent beverage."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out nearly black with a small head. Stale hop aroma along with just a little bit of roasted malt. After the boring aroma, I was surprised how tasty this beer is. Starts of malty and woody. Slightly astringent. Vanilla flavor comes in near the finish, and there is a little sweetness. The flavor is very subtle for an oak aged beer. Mouthfeel is a little too light. Decent drinkability. Not as good as I was hoping, but still pretty tasty."
"D - This beer surpassed it's expectations in my view ... this is truly one of the better stouts I've tried. The vanilla and oak characteristics are dominant, almost to the point of forgetting that this is a beer. This could be a dessert in itself. I like this one and would order it again for sure."
"First sip was coffee, chocolate and malt balls! A nice tongue coater, and more oak and vanilla come out as you get closer to the bottom of the glass."
"This is beer is incredible. From the thick dark coloring to the sweet oak vanilla malt aroma, to the oak infested chocolate vanilla coffee taste. When I tried this beer for the first time it found it's way around to about 10 of my friends and we finished off the bars entire supply of it in one night. Has a lot of drinkability if you like stouts. This beer is definately a keeper."
"A hearty thanks to Px2GrafX for surprising me with this brew."
"Pours black with a somewhat thin tan head. Aroma of vanilla, oak, and bourbon. Flavor is roasty and sweet, with a dry nutty finish. A bit of sour acidity creeps in and balances nicely with the other flavors. A nice chocolate and spruce bitterness mix in the finish as well. Complex flavor, but not over the top in any respect. Just a nice, well crafted stout."
"A good attempt at bringing an affordable version of their brewpub only classic to a wider audience. It's not as good as the original version, but not bad either. Not bad at all."
"Pours a molasses color. No head or lace. Smell is smokey burnt wood and malt--exceptional. The taste is a little dry but its quite pleasant. It is also sweet upfront and finishes with a rich leatherry wood-like character. Maybe I can tell the Fall is coming because this beer seems to fit real well right now where it might not be as desireable in the middle of July. The mouthfeel is amazing--just like silk in your mouth. A little too much to have more than a couple of these but this beer is excellent. I like it a lot."
"Well I tried this beer again and I must say it has changed a bit since the first time I had it. I am not sure if it is a new batch or just some left-overs, but it is definately better than my first review stated. The aroma has really come along and there is a woody vanilla to the roasty stout. The taste was much much more even and even a little milk stout-ish, a nice roasty flavor that gives way to a oaky (read slight tannin) and vanilla flavor with a bit of lactic sweetness. The body is well rounded but a little gelatin like, slick almost in the finish of the beer. Overall a good breakfest for what is going to be a trying day."
"Readily available throughout Richmond. Usually on-tap at Capital Ale. Goes for about $7 to $8 per six-pack."
"We had just finished out at a scrappy county crab feast, and stopped off in Little Italy on the way home for a light dessert. The vanilla and chocolate accents of the stout went perfectly with canollis and tira misu. A light drinking, but full bodied, stout that would be worth several."
"poured a deep brown color with off-white head. Smell is of chocolate, caramel, coffee, and toasted malt (very nice mixture). Taste starts off hoppy, but the coffee and toasted malt begin to come through. Fishi is dry, bitter, and truly enjoyable. An excellent Stout."
"Pitch black with a bit of residual lace, not a lot of carbonation. Aroma is nice and rather complex; notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, tree bark, and a lot of vanilla. Sweet initially, with black coffee notes leading to a rich maltiness and a mildly bitter finish. The notes of bourbon are ever so slight, but are noticeable. I'd have given this a little more time to sit in those wooden barrels. Mouthfeel is excellent, smooth with not too many bubbles, just a little carbonation. Nice. The low ABV and the smoothness of this one make it an easy drinker. Not top of the line, but a very worthy stout in my opinion, and one I'd certainly go for again."
"overall: not my favorite stout, but a great change of pace. super complex with a different flavor taking charge with every sip. definitely pick one up if you're lookin' for a flavored stout."
"Drinkability: The vanilla is used tactfully. However, that flavor sticks at the end and becomes a little too sweet."
"Solid beer to relax w/. Non some ""oh my god"" beer, but, pleasent, solid, and enjoyable"
"First pint glass pours with a frothy 1/2"" mocha head, which lasted faded pretty quick down to an uneven layer of bubbles, but laced beautifully. Opaque dark brown/black brew, with roasty dark grains and vanilla barrel filling the nose. Taste starts with sweet chocolatey coffee, mellows with vanilla notes, and closes with a slight vinous character. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very nice. Always a pleasure to have the chance to revisit this brew."
"However, this is an excellent beer, and a solid example of my favorite style."
"Tastes of smoky chocolate. Underpinnings of coffee. Vanilla. That's about it, it sticks to a few basic flavors and blends them well. Mouth is creamy without much aftertaste. Pretty drinkable if not overly complex."
"Drinkability - Not as good as the Oak Aged Yeti, but it is at least reminescent of it. A very good beer at the least."
"I found this beer to be a bit more one dimensional than I was anticipating. Pleasing American take on the Stout style, but could have used a bit more thickness of body."
"It is a little thinner than I generally like a stout to be but the flavor makes up for it."
"Very smooth and oak adds value to taste, however another stout with a variation among many good stouts available. Medium mouthfeel, worthy to drink on its own without food. Toast, coffee, well carbonated, toasty,and vanilla but is it real vanilla? Sweet cocoa aftertaste. Second tasting a couple of weeks alter."
"This is a mellow, balanced stout. I like this beer, but it didn't wow me. It is a good session stout."
"Yeah, this hits the spot all the way. Goes down smooth as hot chocolate. I could probably chill with a few bottles by a roaring fire and discuss the merits of 1700 colonialism, puff a pipe, and be quite at peace with the world. Thanks to blitz134 for hooking me up with this awesome surprise!"
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a roasted, black patent, and chocolate malt scent with some vanilla and oak aroma. The taste is great. It has a smooth and creamy black patent and chocoalte malt flavor. It is rich with malts and dry on the finish with a sweet vanilla aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great stout. It has excellent flavor and aroma; a good drinker."
"Overall, a decent brew, and definitely different than most other stouts. Worth a shot. This one seems like a love it or hate it, I fall in between but think it is a good shot. Its just a little too sweet for me"
"I would not recommend this beer."
"Drinkability and Notes  Good stout, certainly enjoyable and drinkable. This would be a good stout for people who are not stout fans, its easy to drink and really tasty. That being said it is not as deep and rich as many of the top tier American Stouts."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a very nice stout. Just about as complex as a beer can get at 5.2% alcohol. The drinkability isn't too high simply complex it's such a complex taste. One or two and your taste buds would be wasted. Thanks (again) to NeroFiddled for this wonderful brew."
"The taste is pretty smooth, with a nice balance of sweetness, roasted malt, vanilla, and a earthy flavor. It's a nice flavor, but I feel it's somewhat hamstrung by a very thin mouthfeel that doesn't really let it run as well as it could. It's a little too watery and not quite aggressive enough to really do this one justice. Not bad, but certainly not perfect."
"This brew is black as night. Poured a good 3 inch head that dissapated quickly. Nose is of a slight hint of coffee and vanilla. Taste is a wonderful blend of coffee and chocolate. The finish is a nice dry vanilla hop. Mouthfeel is fairly chewy and smooth. Drinkability is very good, this brew is recommended!"
"A very fine beer. One that I look forward to drinking again and again."
"On draught at St. James Tavern. This beer is a deep dark brown/black with a ruby halo and a thick beige head. Thick lacing as well. Great aroma of roasted coffee/mocha, chocolate and malt. Creamy body with a nice amount of coffee, vanilla and chocolate malt in the flavor, a tad more enjoyable than the bottled version. The finish is velvety smooth and has a smokey character along with some hops. Overall this is a pretty good Stout, easy to drink and very tasty."
"This is an excellent stout. It was more vanilla and less oak than I was expecting. But the flavor profile is really quite complex. There seemed to be nuances in the taste that I couldn't quite place. I look forward to trying this again."
"Poured a nice dark color with thick creamy browish head that lasted to the very end. The smell was of vanilla, roasted malts, and some caramel. The taste was supurb. A wonderfuld blending of vanilla and woody flavors from the oak fade into a nice malty balance near the end. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy, just the way I like 'em! I would have to say that this is very drinkable. I enjoyed several that night. Very good beer."
"Delightful stout I must say."
"Pours a deep black color, but with very little head which quickly fades. If you love vanilla, as I do, the smell is absolutely amazing. Taste is very fizzy upfront, a little too much carbonation. After the fizz passes, the taste is very of vanilla and some roasted malts. In the aftertaste, you can really taste the oak chips along with some lingering vanilla. Mouthfeel is pretty thin, but even so, this beer is incredibly tasty and drinkable for fans of vanilla."
" Drinkability is ok again not bad just much better options are out there unless you happen to love vanilla and carbonation then this might be your beer. Thanks to merlin48 for this sample and the many others he has provided."
"Late addition: Got a great head with the third bottle and it was starting to grow on me too."
"Bottoms Up!!!"
"all in all a very nice stout."
"Pours very black with a creamy light brown head. The smell is quite strong, although I can't detect much over the vanilla. As the beer warms, the aroma becomes more complex. Toffee and chocolate are there, as well as roasted malt. Up front, the taste is slightly burnt, then quickly transistions to roasted malt. Towards the end, the vanilla comes through, smoothing the taste and adding a unique sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. The finish is bitter chocolately, roasted grains, and a slight smokiness that imparts a dry quality. The bourbon alcohol presence becomes apparent as the beer warms further, but it is well hidden. The taste is quite complex due to the blend of malts used - a very interesting brew. I really want to try this one on-tap."
"deep dark brown with a light brown head that fades quickly. strong maltiness to the aroma with hints of vanilla, toffee and coffee. smokey woody aromas come out as it warms. strong vanilla/toffee/buttery flavor, mild coffee too strengthening as it warms. oak flavor is present, but most pronounced in the aftertaste. sort of light feeling body for the style, with an average level of carbonation. a good stout but not a great stout. seems almost a little porter like."
"Drinkable? I say ""oh hell yes!"" This was well crafted and would make for a great session beer!"
"Many thanks Pisskynights!"
"I really would prefer having this one on tap since I was underwhelmed by the bottled product."
"Served by circa.1750's bar maid at Shield's Tavern Williamsburg, Va. brewed in nearby Hampton Roads Va St. George Brewery. Very very dark color its head quickly becomming a light brown halo at edge of glass with a little matrix of lace. Complex aroma of roasted malts vanilla, chocolate and oaky Bourbon barrel. Tasted malt and burned barley (coffee?) A Bitter oak tannin finish that my son disliked but I found interesting. Some of this strong finish was off set by its heavy mouth feel. Nice body. At 5% ABV it would take several pints to turn you into a ""Gigglenna"" You will have a great time with this Stout."
"This beer is just damn smoot, like velvet and like candy. Really drinkable, really delicious, sadly not my favourite stout-type though ;("
"Truly one of Dominion's best beers. A little hard to come by, but can still be found if you look hard enough (lets hope they start shipping out of state soon!). The color is a deep rich dark brown, hinting at the full bodied nature of this beer. The aroma is subtle, and the head unfortunately minimal, but the taste is a work of art. Dominion's Oak Barrel Stout has a truly complex and thick taste, combining the taste of malt with hints of vanilla, coffee and chocolate overlayed with the complexity of oak. A true pleasure to drink, quite possibly one of the best stouts out there. My only complaint is the mouthfeel, as it is a bit thick and tends to linger a bit longer than I prefer. If you ever see this, buy it and treat yourself to a very enjoyable evening."
"Taste is much like the aroma, with creamy vanilla and chocolate. Some toasted walnuts are noted, and there are coffee notes but little bitterness. I don't pick up any notes of bourbon, and there are only some mild notes of dark fruits such as figs and raisins. Still, this is one of the tastiest American stouts I've sampled. Insanely drinkable at 5.2%. Highly recommended."
"Overall this is a decent and interesting beer, not without its interesting flavor nuances. This beer doesn't ask too much of the habitual stout drinker, but it does do a nice job of showing flexibility within the style."
"Purchase a cup of regular coffee, pour a bit of sugar and add ice. This is the best way to describe the taste, smell, and appreance of Oak Barrel Stout. This is not an insult. The hints of vanilla and chocolate add to this surprisingly good stout, that was not as heavy or difficult to drink as others of this style. Enjoyed with a slice of cheesecake and was a great combination. Received three bottles in a Beer of the Month club."
"My sample was super-fresh and delicious. A *very* nice and unique stout style that would become a favorite session beer for me if it were distributed here."
"Pours black with just a ring of light brown for the head. Leaves scattered lacing. The aroma is oaky, malty, and bourbony. I get hints of vanilla as well. Very nice aroma. The flavor is malty and chocolatey with the oaky, bourbon flavors coming out in the back. It has a smooth creaminess throughout. This is a top notch brew shared by StuBob."
"I enjoyed the opportunity to sample something different. Low alcohol and thinness make this an almost easy drinking stout."
"From draft, its near perfect. It has extreme vanilla on the first nose. Inhaling deeper you get a very woody scent straight from the oak barrels it came from. It's so deep brown its near black. Caramely(maybe not a real word) head. Rich in color as in smell. Taste is like pure heaven. It is a real vanilla stout with bourbon hanging on everytaste bud with out killing the vanilla. The vanilla despite its strength, is not over powering as well. Leaving a very smooth stout. So enjoyable you can have it for breakfast of dessert. This is a beer you must seek while in Virginia. You might not be a stout person but it is something you will remember always. That's how important this stout is to me. I remember when Jason and Todd both privileged to have it on draft, had their first taste. It was like watching a kid try something sweet for the first time in their life. It truly is an amazing beer. It is one of the first beers that made me understand why beer is so great. Between that and Arrogant Bastard."
"Thanks to meathookjones for a very good beer!"
"Highly recommended."
"I asked friends in No. Va. to get a six of this for me back in April. Finally got my hands on it in November, so it was already nicely aged. Poured a drak murky burgundy under a purplish beige 1.5 finger head that settles fairly slowly, leaving nice lace rings. There's a good roasty nose with vanilla and chocolate notes. The mouth is quite prickly, yet syrupy thick. We've got marvellously smooth nut and chocolate flavors, with sweet caramel. The ever so slight hops presence breaks through the malt only late in the finish. Slightly dry aftertaste, but the lasting impression is mostly sweet. Recommend this as a very nice nightcap."
"Totally different animal than on nitro-tap. Out of the bottle it pours with a small tan head. Far less creamy and smooth than the draft product. I feel as if it is almost a bit overcarbonated. Vanilla is less pronounced but it is still there. More bittersweet chocolate is present. Maybe a little espresso. Not what I expected after having it on draft many times but still a very enjoyable beer."
"After being poured, the color was a very dark brown, with very little tan foam and no lace. The smell was of roasted malts and a hint of spice. The flavor was dominated by roasted malts with a hint of bourbon on the palate. The finish was dry, but, also had a cream feel in the mouth to make this stout well balanced. As the bottle said, ""Our little treasure!"". The only set back is that it was a little to bitter."
"This was given to me by a fellow BA. Pours a very dark brown color with a very small tan head that doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is very strong of vanilla and roasted malts and some alcohol. Very interesting. The flavor is of floral hops and slight vanilla with some coffee and chocolate. The body is slightly more thin than I expected it to be. Slightly oily, but enjoyable."
"This beer came to me in traditional pint glass, on the warm side; color was pitch black in the center and became more brown/black towards the edges and cocoa brown on the very edge, no light passed through. There was light to barley any carbonation noticeable. The head that was formed was creamy, thick and sticky but fell fairly fast to a light skim and a ring on the edges, the color was a medium cocoa powder brown, with some highlights and dark points across the surface. There was some sticky lace throughout the glass, more prominent in the beginning then towards the end. Typical stout characteristics. The aromas that came from the glass were of caramels, vanilla bean, some cocoa powder oak wood, toffee, some dark malts, a light coffee at times, and bourbon notes throughout, vanilla and bourbon seemed to become alittle more pronounced as it warmed and near the last sip. The tastes were more complex then the aromas. Tastes of roasted malts, and oak were the first flavors that hit my buds along with a slight bitter coffee, then some sweet malts, vanilla bean, caramel, toffee, chocolates, more oak wood, and warming notes of bourbon dominated the rest of the taste, and ended more with a pronounced bourbon flavor and the other flavors seemed step to the rear, especially as it warmed. Aftertaste was on the roasted malt, alcohol side but not real lasting. Body was on the full side especially as it warmed. Decently complex seemed to became more complex as it sat. A good beer and nice and warming. One of the better beers that is being done with oak barrels, barrel aging, etc. I have this beer in 12oz. bottle and look forward to comparing it with the nitro version."
"Tasted: 10/28/04"
"Dominion's Oak Barrel Stout delivers the standard stout appearance with some fairly good head retention but only minor lacing. The nose is stout-like as would be expected, and the vanilla and oak do lend a subtle note to it. I also like the fact that it's not a bourbon-barrel stout - not that they're not great, but this is different. And that's where it really shines. The vanilla clearly comes through in the flavor, but it's not overly done, and more woody notes appear in the finish. Very nicely balanced, and interesting. Certainly worth trying."
"Dominion Oak Barrel Stout is very good beer. The vanilla makes it stand out from the crowd, even if the other advertised flavors don't really materialize. I could drink a lot of this."
"Still a very tasty beer, but after 12 ounces, I don't want any more."
"I like this beer and want more. soon."
"Overall, a pretty decent stout."
"Mouthfeel is medium, probably could use more body for the style. Smooth, sweet but not cloying. Would be a perfect dessert beer, maybe over ice cream. Thanks to meathookjones for the sample."
"Jet black in color. Smallish head that hardly left any lacing on the glass. The aroma is really perfect here with sweet roasty and rich notes. Spicy vanilla, earthy, woody and oaky. Bitter vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg and even cookie dough are all detectable in this beer. The taste is rich and roasty, very creamy and mellow, bready and very flavorful. Wonderfully complex that finishes bitter and dark. The body in this one seems just a tad watery, but overall, everything comes together nicely. A very nice and unique stout."
"The beer pours jet black with a 3 finger latte colored head that sticks around well after the pour. The nose is just full of different smells. I get less of the chocolate and coffee tones that I am used to in a stout, and more vanilla and bourbon tones. As the beer warms, more of the malty goodness comes through in the form of a mocha aroma. The flavor is fairly good, but a little weaker that I would like. There is mostly coffee and vanilla coming through this one, with hints of the oak staying in the background and more prevalent after swallowing the beer. Still a good offering. The beer falters a bit in the mouthfeel. Its just not thick enough and there is more carbonation that I like to see. This is a highly drinkable stout. Its not overly filling and could easily be a session beer in the cold of winter with a hearty stew or thick soup."
"DOBS pours an opaque black with no light shining through whatsoever. the pour i got had no head either. i suspect the bartender was at fault. a coffee roastiness quickly appears, in aroma and tasting. but then the chocolate kicks in. the beer actually tastes like someone has squirted hershey's chocolate syrup in it; reminded me of young's double chocolate stout. i enjoyed this, but my tastebuds would get a warped idea of what beer tastes like if i drank DOBS too much. at only 5.2% however, anyone who was very fond of the beer could put a few down without falling off their bar stool."
"Black, every shade of black, in other words it is dark. There was no light penetration at any point. The head color was brunette and about a half finger in height. Head retention was fair; it faded a little too quickly to a fizzy cap that thinned out from there. There wasnt much subsequent lacing, just a few spots of foam that tried in vein to cling to the glass. Still, this is a very good-looking beer. The first whiff of the nose was all vanilla; I was quite taken aback! It was a little much for me. However, the second sniff allowed for some roasty qualities to penetrate. At the back were a suggestion of wood and some hints of chocolate-milk with espresso. The potency isnt that great but it is plenty strong enough to get the point across. I like the bouquet, after the first smell it became very well rounded. Lovely actually, inviting. The palate is every bit as pleasant as the nose lead on, and that is all I can ask for. The roasty qualities are the focal point, as expected for a stout. Flavors included coffee beans, fresh espresso with a dash of milk and a side of dark chocolate. Tasty. The vanilla is at home in the middle and lingers to the finish were it is teamed up with a distant note of wood. By the aftertaste the roast has reestablished itself. The astringency works perfectly with a sharp hops bite. This is a very good stout, the layers of flavors is a real treat. I love the fact the abv is just above 5%, Id be happy to session with this any day. The palate has no flaws but no one striking aspect that really elevates this beer. Dont misunderstand this statement, as this is a kick-ass stout. Medium/medium-light in body, the carbonation is rather lively which kind of tricks my tongue into thinking this is a bigger beer than it is. I do think a maltier backbone would really help this beer as the mouthfeel, while pleasant, is a bit thin. I found this stout to be very drinkable and very likable. If I ever see this beer again I will by at least a six-pack. This beer is a treat to drink. Thanks meathookjones for the 12-ounces of yummy beer!"
"All in all, Dominion Oak Barrel Stout was a pleasant brew that was easily quaffable. Thanks to EyeChartBrew for providing me with the gift."
"Thanks to AleOha for the sample, much appreciated."
"Thanks for the effort anyway marc77."
"Pours the deepest brown color you can get with some ruby highlights. Short-lived tan colored head. Dark roasted grains, coffee, cocoa and vanilla, maybe some tobacco and cream soda notes, too. Some vinous and woody characteristics in the aroma, but mostly confectioner-like aromas. Tastes rather thin for a stout. Rich vanilla accents throughout the whole experience, with weak black patent and chocolate malt tastes backed with a little bit of hops (Challenger?). Medium to low carbonation. The flavors do meld nicely, but if I were king of the world, I'd boost the grain bill up a notch and balance out the aggressiveness of the vanilla a little better. I've sampled a nitrogenated version before at a brew festival before and liked a bit better if I recall."
"Overall: A good but not great beer. Carbonation is a little overpowering but defintely try this interesting twist on the American stout."
"Overall, I would say that I would definitely have this one again. When next I am in Virginia, I shall seek it out. This is truely unique."
"This is simply the best Stout I have ever put in my mouth! The head was nice and thick, and lasted the whole drink. The color was a beautiful dark black, just the way I like's 'em. The smell was awesome! It had abunch of things going on at once. First had a smell of butterscotch, then was vanilla, then malty with a tinge of alcohol. The taste was similar, but was more on the butterscotch/vanilla malt taste, with a slight hint of the hops. The drinkability on this one is way over a 5. It's a dark and heavy beer, but at the same time, it's not too filling, so you can put back quite a few of them."

"Drinkability: This is good. The beer is immensely drinkable, and the taste is so smooth it's like swallowing a silk hankerchief. The light mouthfeel make this an ideal session stout and the ABV is low enough to put them away easily. If this were as available as Guinness, I'd make the switch for my new fallback stout. AS a beer it's not earth shattering, but it is good."
"I really liked this beer a lot. It is dark dark with a tan head, looks like a stout should look. It smelled strong to me, with a variety of aromas in there, coffee, chocolate, alcohol, a bit of vanilla too. Tasted great, lots of roasty vanilla-coffee flavour and a bit of a lactic presence, which isn't my favorite taste but it works in the right blend, and this is quite a good blend, so it works. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side but with all the flavour it doesn't take too much away. Drinkability is good, but because it smells so alcoholic I think it might get to me after a while. All in all a great beer and one I'd definitely have again!"
"Almost opaque black hue with a light brown film that lasts. Intense aroma where vanilla comes strong marrying the spongy oak. Chocolate pillows, a few cream cups, a coffee sipper and a toffee eater sitting by a smoky campfire. Well blended and rich flavors to say the least. Palate is a bit less interesting, but still delicate, smooth and satisfying, which is no surprise from Dominion. Medium body and carbonation enhance the high drinkability. Wood flavors complement the big sweet chocolate while the light hoppy acidity takes care of the could-be-overpowering vanilla by leading us into a dry finish. Great stout, cheers Larry!"
"Very nice tasting. One to sit back and think about while drinking. Yummy! Highly enjoyable stout!"

"Still good but this just came back to the Pittsburgh market, with a new label and new brewing location in Delaware. From what I can tell recipe has changed and AB owns the Old Dominion breweing company even though it had been a Virginia staple during my formative beer years. Pours a pitch black with a nice full volcanic eruption mocha tan head forming thick and dwindling slow with fine lace. Nose is a bit dull, but I can detect dark chocolate with hints of sourdough bread and a touch of vanilla oak chip accent. Flavor wise it's creamy dark chocolate, hints of oak chips and vanilla bean flavors. Subdued flavors much less roasted malt than when I first tried this beer in the early 2000s. Their sampler used to be hands down one of the best that came to the Burgh, the Dominion Ale had layers of complexity and the Dominion Lager was the best export style I had ever tasted aka Dortmunder. Topped off with the Oak Barrel and Dominion Pale Ale. A bit thinner than it used to be but at least it's got a some balls with even carbonation going on. Enough about memory lane this beer is promising I hope to see a sampler if the lager is as tastless as it was in VA beach last summer no thanks. Either way you cut it this brewery is no longer at the orginial locatoin where the epic brewfest used to take place each year, sad really. I'm glad this beer is still drinkable, but it's just not the same formula/method they were brewing before. This used to be on Nitro draft int the Burgh and it was epic, I'm sad they haven't continued that tradition."
"A nice stout to be had for its ageing and storage are not like others of this style, and it shows. The pour is a dark ruby color that floats a smaller than expected light tan head. Lace was thin if at all. The aroma was complex and threw me off abit with hints of bourbon, oak, toffee and vanilla malt. The taste carried thoughs same qualities along with mild sweet chocolate and hop. With all this going on I found the body abit thin, not chewy. Aids the drinkability. The finish is dry as from bakers chocolate. A nice stout with alot going on, abit thin, but a good one for all year round."
"Dark cola-brown black body with an easy-forming light tan head that fades quickly. Smells like a chocolate milkshake with chocolate malt and vanilla. The oak lurks just underneath in the aroma, but comes out more in the flavor. Theres a very slight coffee in the back of the chocolate. Sweet. A little thin."
"Beer is good. Happy barrel beering."
"Aroma is light chocolate and some hints of sweet brown sugar and vanilla. First sip reveals a fairly thick beer with very mild carbonation. Flavro is mostly roasted malt hits mixed with mild sweet vanilla and some biting coffee on the finish. No real hint of alcohol or oak that I can detect. A very tasty beer that I am glad I finally procured. Some piney hop notes actually show up on a burp or two. Nice one!"
"Bottles (I've had it) just don't do justice to this beer. i could rate it as one of the all time best darks...It is a reason for not attempting a dark homebrew unless I get myself a nitro tap. it is worth the trip...400+ miles from here."
"This beer poured almost black, letting little of the dark ruby red show through. It formed a light tan, medium sized head that left little lace, but followed the glass if moved. An aroma of malt, milk chocolate and coffee. The flavor was of malt, chocolate and coffee. The finish was fairly light for the style and was bitter and astrigent. A good beer that seems hurt some by the finish."
"From the bottle pours a black liquid with ruby highlights. Nice tan foamy head that stays around for a while. Nice lace on the glass at the end. Smells roasty, along with vanilla, and slighlty smoky. Tastes very much like the smell, some roasted flavor, along with coffee, a hint of vanilla, and smoke. Nice hop bitterness. This was full-bodied with appropriate carbonation. Overall, I enjoy the bottle more than the nitro-tap. Some of the subtle flavors are present in the bottle, rather than being masked by the nitro. Very nice stout."
"Pours a very dark opaque black with brown head. (I'm talking black to the point where my mag-lite couldn't be seen through it except for a tint of ruby) Has decent head retention. Smell is sweet, mostly roast and vanilla. Taste is well-balanced with the vanilla coming to the forefront. Also has a cocoa-ish taste to it. Extremely smooth to drink. I have to say this is one of the few stouts I think I could sit down and just drink gallons of. I drove 2 hours to the store where I picked this up and I must say the trip was not wasted. A must try. One day I hope to try it on tap."
"Taste is of roasted malt with a vanilla sweetness and a gentle hop finish. Low to medium bodied, but with a smooth creamy mouthfeel and gentle alcohol warming. This is a very tasty stout. Maybe a little sweet to drink in a session, but thats not really the intention of this great brew."
"Very nicely done. Hopefully this will become available in upstate NY sometime soon. Big big thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for the bottle."
"This one pours a nice opaque black in the glass with nice a tan/brown head that has good retention. A perfect picture of a stout. The cocoa and coffee smells stand out the most in the aroma. Hints of vanilla and smokiness come through as well. The taste has a number of things going on with it mainly the roasted malts and chocolate followed by vanilla and espresso. This is a very tasty and ridiculously drinkable stout indeed. The mouthfeel is creamy and a bit thin, but this definatly lends to its drinkability. This is one beer I will keep a sixer of in the beer fridge as often as possible."
"This masterpiece pours nearly black with a tan bubbly head that lasts the entire pint. All kinds of subtle scents to pick up - deep earthy cocoa, roasted malt, honey, oak, & of course - vanilla. This stout tastes ridiculously good. Perfect blend of rich & fantastic chocolate malts with millions of complexities from delicate vanilla to roasted oak with hints of bourbon & subtle tobacco in between. This brew is full-bodied with a silky smooth milk-like feel. The finish is earthy with a perfect touch of bourbon. Simply spectacular."
"Enjoyed this brew at Mahars last evening. This beer poured to a deep black color with a nice chunky tan head that had excellent retention and left lacing through out, a fantastic looking brew! The aromas are of vanilla, with chocolate, oak and roasted highlights. The taste has a number of things going on, a little hop up front followed by an excellent mix of vanilla, cocoa and espresso, simply a fantastic tasting brew! One knock against it, it could be thicker but actually makes it a brew that can be had during any season! I must say that I was unsure of this brew when I got it, but man I glad that I did! This is a brew that I am going to look for in the future! Try this brew, I think you will be happy!"
"It is black with some slight ruby tinges around the edges and a good sized tan head. Vanilla is prominent in the aroma and there is also some woody notes and roasted barley. The taste starts off with roasted, toasted malts and then gives way to some vanilla and oak. The body is smooth but finishes up somewhat dry and lingers with a coffee aftertaste."
"Thanks to Manekineko for getting it out here!"
"An opaque black colour with an ample head of tan/brown foam. The aromas are all over the place and quite complex. Lactic sweetness, oak, alcohol, cream, vanilla, smoke, and more. The taste is not as complex as the aroma, but it is quite complex in its own right. I taste oak, vanilla, deep roasted malts, subtle earthy hops, and more. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, and the drinkability is very good as well."
"Overall, an interesting, good stout."
"Newly distributed in bottles this specialty stout is a satisfying and very drinkable stout. Though a bit thin on feel it is uniquely positioned between a thick bodied Imperial style and the lighter versions that show dark but lack thickness in the body. I found this to be a bit like a Storm King ""Lite"" with similar hoppy notes and a stronger sense of acohol than most stouts. The smell and taste of vanilla did not register with me. I liked the modest head that formed and the light lacing effect."
"Head is sticky as hell leaving lace all over. Smells the same as before. Coffee flavor is more dry then bitter, otherwise super creamy chocolate malt, maybe a hint of whiskey/tobacco."
"Poured a very fizzy darkness with only a slight bit of light 'round the edges. The head was short-lived, tan in color, and crackled and fizzed like a pot o' witches' brew. Aromas are tough to detect. I'd expected a more pronounced vanilla aroma, but such was not the case. There is some caramel sweetness, backed up by a smoky/coffee aroma. Flavor is less impressive than the draft version. Don't get me wrong, though. Still a tasty stout, there's a chocolate-coffee front, followed by some earthy bitterness, and ends with a smoky, vanilla-laced goodness. Mouthfeel is very thin for a stout. Not much body to this at all. Way too much carbonation. Drinkable, but nothing that blew me away. Sadly disappointed by this one."
"Thanks to ManekiNeko for the many samples!"
"Very nicely balanced brew and rich with an amazing character normally associated with stronger beers."
"This is a very exciting brew that leaves me wanting more."
"Deep dark ruby color-not quite totally opaque.good sized tan head tha receedes to about 1/8"".Roasted aroma-slight hints of vanilla.Big flavor of chocolate.Roasted malts.The vanilla is very slight-almost an after taste.I dont get any oak.There is a slight ""whiskey"" flavor in the backround.Nice smooth mouthfeel-goes down very easy.A great beer overall-could consume this all night.My only complaint about this and other beers of this type like the Sam Chocolate Bock is I find I am biased to look for what I see on the label in the way of flavors.Well worth seeking out and trying however."
"Comments  A big, huge thanks to skyhand for not only putting together the BA tasting night but also for supplying this gem."
"Overall, quite drinkable and very interesting."

"From the 12oz bottle, courtesy of TinusTime's efforts at his store. Poured out pretty much straight black, with some slight ruby highlights. A large tan head sits atop my brew. Vanilla in the aroma, along with roasted coffee and floral hops. Incredibly smooth taste. This beer is full of taste, yet nearly floats across the tongue. Vanilla is definitely there, roasted malts, slight fruity overtones, cream, and a decent hop bitterness to finish things off. This is pretty much a vanilla version of the Dominion Stout, which is good in itself. Mouthfeel is perfect, like a light fluff across your mouth. Great brew, well balanced...with nothing overboard, so don't expect it. Just an excellent stout."
"Drinkability is excellent. The dry finish and average alcohol content make for an quaffable, but nice to savor, brew."
"quite a unique and complex stout, this one impressed me. my first beer from old dominion, i'll be seeking others out for sure."
"So this is NOT the same beer as draught version. The kegs are full of this stout that has been aged in bourbon bottles; the bottles are the brew ""dry hopped"" with vanilla beans and toasted oak chips. A decent attempt at approximating barrel aging in a quicker and cheaper way, but its clearly not the same. Regardless, this is a fine stout, much better than most normal stouts and surprisingly big and dynamic, tasting to me somewhat like Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. So its a great beer but I can only imagine how much better is the draught product."
"Edit Addendum: I let another bottle sit out for a while and assume room temperature, so I could bring out the aromatics. One of these buggers served at 55-65F has a metallic tang to the aroma that isn't noticable when the beer is chilled. And there is a pronounced nutty aftertaste present in the room-temperature beer."
"This is a very fine beer. While I have difficulty treating it like a pure stout (it tastes more like an imperial stout, and given the aging process it would be better classified as a hybrid), I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try something quite unique."
"Overall - Get this beer. It's truly a testament to stouts."
"On tap poured into a pint glass. It pours a jet black color with two fingers of dark tan foam. There is lots and lots of lace rings left down the sides of the glass. The smell is full of roasted malt, coffee, and a hint of oak. The taste is full of mocha, burnt malt, and molasses. A hint of hops on the finish. The body is a little watery, yet very smooth. The drinkability is fantastic. An awesome stout!"
"Mmmmm. Now this is what a stout is all about. It was dark, malty, slightly hoppy, and pretty filling. The light in Old Dominion's Ashburn, VA, brewpub was fairly dim, but Oak Barrel looked black as night in my glass. I didn't detect the bourbon flavor, just a rich, creamy stout that made my barbecue sandwich quiver in fear, knowing that it didn't have the body and texture to stand up to such a wonderful concoction. Regrettably, since the tab was on my girlfriend's father, I didn't want to order another beer until he did, and he didn't, so I only got one taste of this divine liquid."
"Pours a deep black with just hints of chestnut brown. Nice inch high head that did settle quickly into just a patch of khaki on top. Aromas of Chocolate, butter, vanilla and caramel. Taste was nice very chocolatey. For a moment I thought the bartender had poured me a Rogue Chocolate Stout. Hints of the Bourbon barrell finally seep in at the finish. Drinks smooth as silk with nice light carbonation leaving the tongue feeling clean and not heavy. A very very drinkable stout although I was a bit surprised by the amount of chocolate flavour in the stout."
"gds"
"The bartender said it had a hint of vanilla. It looked like a good beer. Nice color and head. BUT this was an overpowering flavor of vanilla. The tap handle said oak barrel stout, but it should have read vanilla flavored beer. Not good. I guess it would be appealing to women and those who love the vanilla, but when you put a beer to your lips and expect to taste beer and get this...Well lets just say I was not impressed. I wouldn't order this again."
"On tap at J. Brian's Taproom in Fredericksburg."
"As near to a perfect brew as I've had."
"Drinkability: YES, OH MY GOD, YES!!! This was the winner of the ""Which Beer Will Go Home in my Growler?"" contest. I'm thinking that the growler will never see anything but this stuff, too. Might have to pick up a second one..."
"This was the true surprise of the festival, and one I didn't expect to be so good! I hope that I can find this one nearby, because I would certainly purchase it in the future!"
"This brew pours ever so slowly from the tap but when it finally reaches you it is blacker than night with a nice creamy brown head that lightly laces the glass. The oak barrels that this stuff is aged in lend a big vanilla quality to the nose with some more subtle burnt malt and sweeter chocolate characterisitics in the background. The brew opens up on the tongue with strong vanilla flavors before it is highjacked by the strong burnt malt presence and its wonderful bitter qualities. The bitter is then joined by a smoothly sweet chocolate quality that complements and balances the bitterness nicely as it fades out. The chocolate sweetness fades out into a nice smooth vanilla finish that lingers pleasantly on the tongue. This has to be one of the smoothest, silkiest beers that I've ever had, an amazing mouthfeel to accompany the heavyish body of the brew. This is a truly awesome brew that is certainly one of my favorite stouts, if only I lived a little closer to the brewpub."
"A growler obtained 11/27/02. A big creamy head floating on this beautiful black as the nite without any stars in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean (I remember of nites like that from days in the Navy) brew. The aroma is something that it is hard to describe. It has this fragrance of vanilla and bourbon. The smoothness and balance of this brew is remarkable. There is sweet softness of the malt embracing the palate and the slight presence of hops at the finish. It has to be one of the most distinctive, drinkable stouts that I have ever had."
"On tap at the brewpub. Virtually black in hue w/ a thick, dense, creamy beige head that leaves intricate lace. Roasted barley coffee notes, dark caramel and milk chocolate in aroma, w/ a touch of diacetyl butterscotch. Hugely oaky vanilla flavor from the barrel conditioning accompanied by a perfectly smooth chocolate malt, carob and dark crystal malt combination. Superlative balance of rich malt flavors and hop bitterness. It's hearty, full bodied, yet isn't overly rich. Oak Barrel Stout (formerly known as Bourbon Stout) finishes w/ a light sweetness and satisfying lingering roastiness. Absolutely outstanding and truly unique."
"Of all the stouts except Imperial Stouts I like this one best. Creamy and malty full of wonderfull bourbon aromas this stout is not as dry as a typical Irish Stout. The bitterness of BlackPatent malt is subdued and balanced tho' dry not excessive. Best enjoyed on tap."
"One of the more interesting, flavourful and complex stouts that I've had in ages. Just made the top of my stout list!"
