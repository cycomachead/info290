"Smell is the highlight with overwhelming coffee aroma.  Really thin for a stout. Overall...not bad.  Not great"
""
"O – Fantastic coffee beer. I only drink my coffee dark roasted and black, this hits all the right notes, no sweetness, just great notes of bitter coffee and chocolates, just great. Though I can see how some might be put off if they are expecting something sweeter."
"Overall a very good coffee beer."

"Lighter and less boozy than most coffee stouts but that's not always a bad thing. Plenty of flavor here."

"Subdued inital malt with a stronger coffee taste. Bitter (but not egregiously so) aftertaste. Overall mild for a stout, no alcohol taste whatsoever."

"Man I really liked this...  Fantastic coffee, roasted malt and slight chocolate flavor... Until about 3 seconds after I swallowed.  Terrible, I mean terrible, aftertaste!  Ruined everything great it initially, one of the worst stout aftertastes I have experienced.  Almost a rotten moldy flavor.  Sad, I really wanted to like this one and stock up on a good cheap coffee stout."

"O-This definitely gets the job done. It lacks any real charisma, unfortunately. It's a tasty Stout that delivers plenty of java flavor and not much more."

"a great stout, one of those enormous dark beers that just satisfies like no other on an unseasonably cold monday afternoon. dark in color, almost black in fact, but showing some dark chocolate tones around the edges under a rather lazy inch of tan foam. the nose is coffee first, mixed in with some chocolate malt, dark chocolate cake or fudge brownie, and a bold ale yeast. love the combination here. the taste is similar, with plenty of robust coffee flavor but very little acidity or mouthfeel weirdness from it. belgian dark chocolate flavor in the finish, some mild birch or maple syrups sweetness, and a dark roasted barley that is large without being especially bitter. i think the mix of flavors and textures is wonderful, velvety smooth but shockingly full flavored, full bodied yet real easy drinking. a nice mix. i think oakshire has impressed during its brief stead in colorado, and i hope they continue to show up periodically with new stuff, as i think everything they do has been excellent. great use of coffee in a drinkable stout. perfect cold weather brew."

"12oz can that I think I paid $1.59. Dark black, tan head, looks decent. Doesn't smell like much other than some burnt coffee and grounds. Flavor is more burnt coffee, not very much stout, not very appetizing. i wouldn't say this tasted bad but I wouldn't reach for another. I had no problem finishing the beer though."

"Plenty of coffee, both stale and fresh. A bit thin. Does as advertised, but nothing more."

"O - tasty stout with light coffee flavor"
""
"The taste is a nice dose of coffee but there does not seem to be much in the way of caffeine. It is also rather milky and slightly bitter at the end. This is a stout worth having if you get the chance."

"Overall I really enjoy this beer. Much like the other Oakshire beers they have done a great job with this one as well."
"Pours blackwith a bubbly mocha head. Aroma is not nearly as aggressive as I hoped. It's good, don't get me wrong, but I was hoping this would be bolder and not quite as balanced as it turns out to be. Roasted espresso, dark chocolate, and some sweetness from the sugars that come from the oats. A touch more of that espresso shows itself in the flavor, roasted barley, chocolate, and some sugars from the oats. A touch of some char flirts with things throughout, providing a kiss of some bitterness. A creamy, kinda thinner medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice beer. At $5.49 a bomber well worth my money. Something I would definitely buy again."

"O: One has to love how drinkable this is. The lack of creamy softness is easy to overlook for this reason. I wouldn't trade for it; but I would buy it again if I ever caught it in a store."

"I have tried this in the past and I hate coffee but my palette has changed. It pours our black and thin but very dark. The foam was a dark brown color and it disappeared almost instantly. Held up to light nothing gets through. The smell, perhaps this is too cold, is coffee. That is it. Not much else going on here. Not that strong. I wonder how old this bottle is. The flavor is delicious. The coffee is more subtle. This has to have aged for just a bit but long enough for some of the flavors to taper down. Basically you get the coffee, burnt ashy malts, smokiness and a hint of chocolate. For the mouthfeel I was a bit let down. This is thin for an oatmeal stout. It is a low alcoholic stout so I would imagine it to be a bit thin, on the medium side of beer mouthfeel but with that low carbonation the flavors linger and and I like that. Overall this is a good beer. I wonder what its like fresh? This bottle has to be a bit older but I like it and since I live near Oregon, I can get this really cheap. Its worth the price. I'll get it again if I want a dark low end beer."

"O: This is a delicious creamy espresso-forward beer"
""
""
"The palate opens with a nice espresso flavor. Fresh, clean, mildly fruity and moderately roasty, it is expressed in a way I like. The base stout, however, isn't up to the challenge. Mildly roasty, not chocolatey enough and rather thin, the base stout really is disappointing. Drying, roasty, faintly watery and with a nice lingering coffee flavor on the finish, this beer is medium-light in body. Carbonated a little too highly for my liking, the carbonic acid clashes with the excellently expressed coffee acidity. The hoppy bitterness on the finish is a nice touch. Decent stuff, it could use just a touch of sweetness and body to go with the rather excellent coffee flavor."

"Served from a bottle into an imperial pint glass. This beer is really dark - a dark brown to almost black. It has a nice tanish brown head which leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is dominated by coffee and chocolate hints. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with light carbonation. This beer has a lot of flavor with sweet malts and dark coffee. Overall this beer has a lot of flavor and is pretty drinkable. I would recommend trying this beer."
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dirt/earth, and some super roasty espresso and coffee aromas. Taste is much the same along with a cocoa flavor. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells better than it tastes in my opinion."
""
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a small tan head that has deecent retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is lots of coffee, a light nutty note, and a bit of dark chocolate. The initial taste is sweet with lots of coffee, some nuttiness, and dark chocolate. The finish is bitter with coffee. Light body. Medium carbonation."
""
"Pours obsidian and opaque into my CBS snifter, deep brown head form and retains about a cm nicely. Heavy lacing is left behind. Incredibly dark for a non imperial stout. The nose starts with bold roasted coffee paired with a dry roasted barley quality. Notes of dark chocolate come in as well as a tinge of hops to round things out. Taste lacks malty sweetness and stays on the dry roasted malty side of things. Very dry on the finish and not a whole lot of depth to the flavor. Mouthfeel is moderately carbonation with somewhat light body. Lots of espresso here as well as roasted malts, but there is not enough sweetness to balance out these flavors. The results is somewhat ashy and overly dry."
"O- What an amazing coffee forward stout. Definitely lloking forward to having this readily available to me here."
""
""
"Overall nice, creamy chocolate, drinkable, nice roast and coffee without the astringent over roasted briny taste."
""
"Overall- Decent and pretty easy to drink, but I've had better coffee stouts. I won't be searching for this one anytime soon."

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours almost pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with nice retention, that reduces to a nice dense cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, roasted malt, vanilla, cream, biscuit, and light herbal hops. Nice and well balanced stout aromas with good strength. Taste of chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malt, biscuit, caramel, molasses, vanilla, cream, and light herbal. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, biscuit, and herbal hops on the finish for a short bit. Great balance of flavors, with a nice amount of robustness. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol presence is pretty much invisible as expected for 5.8%. Overall this is a damn nice coffee stout. A lot of well balanced flavors; with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. I really have no complaints. Really well done."
""
"O- nice stout with good amount of coffee and just enough hop bitterness to balance this beer out nicely."
"O: Good coffee stout, good oatmeal stout, GOOD STOUT. I have had better but I would certainly buy this again."
""
"Overall. Plenty of coffee, drinks pretty easy. Great with brunch."
""
"overall: this one went down easy"
"Loving what Oakshire is doing and very happy that Boise has access.... please keep us in your loop. :-)"
""
""
"O: Coffee dominates, with roast, chocolate, and hints of dark fruitiness behind. Very little hop character, and while I liked this beer as a showcase for espresso, there are also better coffee beers out there IMO. Still an easy drinker, and recommended."
""
""
""
"A decent option at a decent price, it was good enough to make me pick up another bottle next time im in WA/OR and next time, I'll drink it fresh and see what happens."
"o - pretty good cappucinno stout..."
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a pretty good and quite drinkable coffee beer. I'd definitely have this guy again."
""
"A nice coffee stout, but I’ll admit I’ve been spoiled lately by copious amounts of Wake-n-Bake and Founders Breakfast Stout. This one is a bit different than those however, using a Sweet Stout as a base, making this a bit unique, as those Sweet Stout characteristics definitely come through."
""
""
"Thanks, chumba526, for the opportunity"
""
"T: Roasted malt and day old coffee upfront. Some hints of dark chocolate, licorice and a hint of smoke and charred malt on the finish. I'm digging the flavors but not the mouthfeel. It's way too thin for my taste."
"Thin. Watery. Lingers when I don't want. So disgusting. Nasty flavors and body."
""
""
"I like it a lot. I like coffee a lot so it's a natural that I would like this."
"O - A good espresso stout. Not fantastic but good. I would enjoy another one if I came across it but I wouldn't necessarily seek it out. The mouthfeel was this beer's biggest letdown for me."
"Drinkable but lacks sweetness and body."
""
""
"Really well balanced. Good flavour that comes out and it is balanced enough that you could drink several."
"Overall, this beer is definitely a favorite of mine, and a big favorite of the locals. For a reason."
"O: Pretty good and for a single stout it boasts a lot of flavor"
"Overall: Pretty good for a coffee stout but I tend to lean more towards the bigger, bolder Imperial Coffee Stouts such as Yeti, Speedway, etc. I won't hold that against this beer as they are not the same style. I probably wouldn't search this out again as I enjoyed the Imperial version more. Still good for the style."
"Nothing too fancy, but a a solid, well made coffee stout overall."
"Comes out of the tap a warm, opaque sable just a hair above black with a very fine-bubbled and persistent tan head. Roast coffee aroma has a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Flavor is like a top-of-the-line mocha - quality coffee and chocolate with nutty, smoky and molasses hints. Texture is velvety smooth and nicely fizzy."
"As this beer progressed the carbonation almost disappeared, that became much less of a problem. The flavor improved and the mouthfeel got smoother, but neither of them were all that much better than what they started out at."
"Tried it at Oakshire Brewing! Poured from tap into a pint glass. According to the brewmaster there is one shot of espresso per pint. Aroma was full of coffee and malty subtleties. The pour and appearance was dark and lent to the richness to come. This brew is creamy, sweet, and has a wonderful hop middle that is not to be messed with. This brew is a perfect marriage of coffee and beer aka Oregon greatness!"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is a mix of chocolate and coffee and is very strong. The flavor is more of the same. I get a ton of coffee and chocolate as well as some strong roasted malt notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice coffee stout."
"This beer is incredible. It pours out a deep black color with brown edges and a gnarly brown thick head. The aroma is heavily of chocolate and darkly roasted, thick coffee...awesome! The taste follows the aroma. This beer has so much flavor for only being 5.8%abv! It has a medium body and very rich flavors. I have yet to have a bad beer from this brewery...every beer they make is awesome and this is no exception! Well done!"
"All in all, one of my favorite coffee stouts out there. Not quite the top, but definitely up there and worth seeking out if coffee brews are up your alley."
"O: Pretty good coffee beer. Not overwhelming or knock your socks off good, but solid."
"Maybe my bottle was skunked. Maybe the added coffee thinned it too much. I just found too much barley malts and not enough balance. Live and learn!"
"If you are in the market for an Espresso/Coffee Stout I strongly suggest this beer. The smell doesn't give off a strong coffee/espresso aroma, if anything I get a little bit of hops. The taste is great, good espresso taste which goes down very smooth. I am getting a nice creamy head and average lacing."
"(review based on notes from tasting on Feb 1, 2011)"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and perhaps a little thin for an oatmeal stout. Carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, I really enjoyed the espresso flavors. The flavors were kind of one dimensional in that the espresso overpowered everything, but that seems like the intent. Thankfully the espresso was very nice and was pretty easy to drink this evening."
"I could drink one of these, but not many more. The standout coffee flavor may appeal to coffee freaks, but other than that, it is not much of a session."
"As others have said, drink this for breakfast or on a hot summer day--assuming you really enjoy 22 ounces of cold black coffee! I seriously think you could add cream and sugar to this stuff. With this beer, it's coffee to the max. No balance whatsoever."
"On the dry spectrum of Coffee Stouts, which really lets the espresso come through. A good drink for a coffee beer."
"Drinkability: Great, if you love coffee. The bitterness from the espresso as opposed to hops is a fun and different spin. The stoutness of the beer makes it a sturdy drink. Not sure if I could drink more than one pint because of its unique taste- however I am surely enjoying this one pint!"
"D- Very quaffable!"
"D: I'm not a huge coffee drinker so I'm not inclined to revisit this one. That being said though, I can see what is trying to be accomplished here and for those fans of big, roasty, coffee and coffee beers, this is a must try."
"Bottle. Poured into a CCB tulip glass a dark brown color with a slight tan head that quickly forms a tan collar around the glass. Aroma is that of leather, coffee, hazelnut, and dark chocolate. The nuttiness is stronger in the aroma more than anything. Nice lace left on the glass as I swirl it around. Medium mouthfeel. Espresso indeed! Dark bitter roast coffee dominate the flavor profile in this one. Some leather type notes as well. Bitterness lingers on. Well, it pretty much is what it says it is, strong coffee style stout. Might use a little more malt to balance it out as the bitterness from the roast is pretty strong."
"poured a very dark brown with ruby brown highlights that had a thin bubbly head and left a little lacing sticking to the glass. Very nice espresso coffee aroma dominate the nose with roasty character chocolate malts, vanilla, and slight lacto milky notes. The espresso coffee notes also dominate the taste with milky lacto, vanilla and chocolate accents. The brew was medium to full in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, slight astringent, roasty, and creamy finish. It drank pretty good but was also damn rich in flavor. it is definitely a dessert beer that would go great with chocolate cake or sometime like that."
"D - Lowish on the ABV, highish on flavor. A nicely drinkable little stout...I have to thank my buddy CK for this tasty offering."
" ~ This is a great idea if you're drinking it for breakfast. Any other time of day I think this bomber may be a bit too much."
"Pours a mice dark brown really coming close to being black and nearly opaque. Small mocha head. Nose brings a bit of roasted malt along with some really strong espresso notes. Great coffee character. The taste tones the coffee down a bit, but it's still quite pleasurable. Good feel with nice carbonation. A very fine coffee beer."
"Wow, I was blown away. I had no real expectations, as I'd never even heard of the brewery, but this is an incredible coffee stout for everyday drinking. Highly recommended."
"Sampled this at Savor 2010. Poured black with a beige head, modest retention, and good lacing. HUGE roasted coffee bean nose, with some bittersweet chocolate and cocoa powder hints as well. Copious amounts of flavor in the taste, with roasted malt and coffee dominating, and then mixing with some chocolate midpalate, and finishing on a pronounced dry coffee note. Smooth and on the thicker side, with very little carbonation. This is a great example of a coffee stout."
"D-This is not a bad beer, but when my favorite Obsidian Stout is available in six packs for $8.99 (often much less on sale) there really is no place in my fridge for this beer that is usually about $5 a bomber."
"This is the second Oakshire beer that I have had the chance to try and all I was say is that I wish this brewery were closer to me or vice versa. This is a solid beer and definately one that I would continue to purchase if given the opportunity."
"D-very big flavor and low on alcohol content. nice tastes and straight forward espresso. easy drinking, not heavy and still very tasty."
"Served in a pint glass at Henry's 12th St. Basically, this is a big, tasty espresso stout where the beans stand up and are support by a background of cocoa and roasted barley. No coffee lover should pass this beer up. It's a great example of how to integrate espresso and beer in one heck of a tasty brew."
"drinkability - very drinkable, balanced flavor"
"D-This brew has HUGE flavor for a non-imperial stout. Its a big beer all around. Its nice to see a small beer packed with tons of big beer flavor-but it does seem kinda one dimensional at times. If coffee beers are your thing-then this beer is definitely for you-if not-stay away."
"cheers to james for sending me another great brew..."
"Impression: I may be moving to Oregon soon, somewhere between Bend and Eugene."
"Drinkability: Overall, very good. This was the most straight-forward coffee flavored stouts I've had. Tasty, enjoyable, and reasonable ABV % makes this easy to enjoy. Could be a bit more balanced in flavor, but the point is ""espresso stout"" and it certainly accomplishes that. I'd recommend."
"I enjoyed this beer quite a lot. A good coffee stout that I woulod purchase again if it was avaialble in CA."
"Oakshire Espresso Stout is easy drinking craft beer that should please a lot of java junkies in the Pacific Northwest. That said, why not crank up the barley, boost the ABV to 7.5% and go for greatness?"
"Shows an excellent dark color with an oatmeal hue head that fades quickly to a decent lace. The aromas are prominent with mostly coffee and espresso like notes. The taste is all nutty, coffee, and smoke, good but not very complex. The palate is medium bodied with good grip; finishes pretty balanced and smooth. Overall a great, albeit one dimensional stout. Tastes like an alcoholic iced espresso."
"D- I enjoy stouts and usually find coffee stouts to be a bit overpowering after a while, but this one is much more drinkable. The coffee flavors blend in well with malts and really adds to the beer. This one is best at cellar temp."
"The nose is dominant espresso with notes of dark chocolate and a little toffee. The malt has a strong roasted profile with an earthy quality. The flavor opens with strong coffee notes and roasted malt. Astringency is light and there's a moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is creamy, silky, and full."
"Overall impression: excellent stout, probably my favorite coffee beer I've tried so far."
"This is a very good espresso stout with a thick creamy mouthfeel and good coffee presence in the nose. Good beer for coffee lovers who don't mind the big burnt malt character."
"Nothing wrong here. Just a really nicely made Oatmeal Espresso Stout. Assertive, yet balanced coffee flavors, with the oatmeal adding a smoothness and overall good drinkibility to this. That's 2 for 2 on Oakshire's bottled offerings. I'm looking forward to more of their stuff in the future."
"Gorgeous looking beer..dark,darkest brown with a lovelly tight ,bubbly tan head. Very coffee accented nose..coffee and burnt oat . Again the fl;avour is dominated by the dark french roast style coffee ..followed by some dark raisin fruit and cream..weird. Thinish palate actually more like a porter palate. But overall a good beer."
"This beer looks and smells amazing but is not very well balanced with way too intense of a roasty coffee flavor that overpowers the silky choclate malt notes lying underneath."
"Overall a nice stout with a noticable but not overpowering coffee presence."
"Supposedly, a full shot of organic espresso is brewed into each pint of stout making this an odd choice as one of just four ales Oakshire offers year round. But Overcast succeeds admirably. Anyone looking for an espresso stout should look here."
"Very dark, sweet, thick, coffeeish and chocolatey. For some reason the other reviewers didn't seem to take to this beer but we think it's a fine coffee stout. Well worth seeking out although probably only available in Oregon. We had it at the Atlantis Lounge at Mississippi Pizza--(highly recommended), the Dublin Pub and a coffeehouse in the EcoTrust building in the Pearl."
"D: Unknown ABV but seems in the 6%+/- range. As such it's drinkable enough, worth having again."
"D: flavors in some regards come and go, coffee and more coffee. Don't get me wrong, I love coffee in my beers, but this one lacks overall elements to make it the least bit enjoyable. Body is not chunky enough for me and results in a slightly average experience"
"Drinkability is pretty good, it goes down very easily. Bartender was sure of ABV but thought around 6%, which seems a bit high to me based on how it drank. Even as a coffee lover though, I didn't need more then one of these, a bit too one dimensional and not that exciting."
"On tap at Good Times. Extremely heavy espresso taste and a dark as sin black pour with a solid head. Very refreshing and relaxing, it makes me want to take a nap. (But in a good way!) At this point this brew is probably what I have most often on tap at my favorite bar, hopefully more people will learn about this one soon."
"All in all, a nice little beer that I can see having a pint of, on ocasion. And I'm really not a small beer fan."
