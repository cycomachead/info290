"Unusual.  Coffee flavor overwhelms too much resulting in overly bitter taste."
""
"My least favorite Sierra Nevada beer."
"Coffee is the dominant note as advertised. A bit creamy on the nose, and a nice full mouthfeel. Otherwise a run of the mill stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Mostly excellent but a shade too bitter."
""
""
"O: [4.00] This is a really nice beer all around.  I am a big fan of the style (not a coffee drinker but I love coffee beers).  This one is a hit on the visual appeal, the nose is great, the taste is good and the mouthfeel is also good.  Overall a great beer to grab and enjoy.  The flavor also changes as it warms.  It moves in a more coffee like direction."
""
""
"3.68/5.00"
""
""
""
"O: Like a good strong cup of black coffee in the morning, this one doesn't mess around. Pretty well done."
"overall the aroma is the highlight, better than the taste."
""
""
""
""
"O – Coffee aroma is nice, but the bitterness of this beer is overwhelming.  Out of balance. Would be interesting to try it again a few months later."
""
"An excellent coffee stout, not that's any surprise."
"Rich coffe dry stout very good"
"S: Nice notes of coffee and cocoa L: Pitch Black with a brownish off white head. T: Roasted Coffee, Cocoa,  Raisins,  and all three combined to have a nice balance sweetness with the mild bitterness of the beer. F: Smooth, mild carbonation,  with a dry finish Overall: A good American Stout."
"The flavor profile is quite nice and is intense, slightly complex and somewhat balanced, although coffee dominates.  It begins with a blend of coffee and dark chocolate that slowly allows detection of the chocolate.  The middle has a subtle caramel note under the coffee.  A mild roast/hop bitterness is also present in the middle.  The finish is slightly sweet then fades into a lingering coffee flavor that is somewhat stale."

""
""
"O- A great coffee stout, definitely worth trying.  Perfect For breakfast!"
""
"A rare miss for me from SN."
""
""
"O: Better than I expected. Nice creamy quality complements the semisweet coffee taste."
""
""
"Overall this is a very solid brew.  It would be great if SNBC made this a winter seasonal every year.  Snowpack was a great value this year, glad I picked it up!"
""
""
""
""
"Deep, dark chocolate brown with a great iceberg looking head and thick lacing clinging everywhere. Aroma is of deep roasted coffee with a hint of chocolate and maltiness. Taste hits first with the chocolate and then bitter coffee. There is a pleasurable sweetness to the first taste and then all balances well with the coffee and such. Kinda tastes like a European heavy roasted coffee with cream added, nice !. Mouthfeel is clingy, thick and chewy and the finish is of heavily roasted coffee."
""
"Super bitter.  Black as night. Over the top coffee..."
""
""
""
"Putrid dreck. Feels not smooth, taste yucky. Dumped it."
""
""
"This was a nice surprise."
"Definitely Coffee on the nose and palate.  Not extremely balanced, but a nice, easy drinking stout."
""
"Black as night and no light will penetrate this brew.  I have an inch of light brown tightly packed foam on top.  Nice Brussels lacing.  Aroma of dark roast coffee dominates.  The flavor is initially bitter dark black coffee and then the overwhelming bitter dar coffee flavor kicks into overdrive.  Just shy of Surly Coffee better intense.  The body is creamy,slightly chewy,and dry."
"Great characters of a stout with a awesome roasty coffee flavor"
""
""
"Best part of the SN winter 12 pack."
"Delicious. Huge frothy head that wouldn't leave. Lots of malt in nose, as well as coffee and chocolate. The taste packs the same with give and take in sweetness and bitterness; maybe a touch of prune. I love this and hope it's offered again."
""
"Definitely a great coffee stout. Absolutely delicious."
"The aroma is freaking amazing and it looks gorgeous upon pouring. The flavor is great as well, though it doesn't follow the nose for long and soon loses some of the flavors one would expect from a coffee stout. There's still plenty of roasted malt and bitter hops and the texture is really smooth with some crispness from the carbonation, so it's still quite enjoyable no matter how you slice it."
""
""
"Pours a deep black and with light, barely see through ruby color. Head went away quick and left a normal lace. Had a fresh espresso scent with maybe a hint of a milk stout. Creamy going in, creamy going down with a dry finish and a bit of bitter. There is a fresh coffee/espresso overtone, but the real winner is the balance. Sweet,and again almost a milk stout that has the right bitter.  Raisin notes. Overall, this seems like another standard for the style. Not overdone, but not a weakling."
""
"O: a little harsh;"
""
""
""
""
"Nice dark pour with off white creamy, rocky head and moderate lacing. Nice aroma of espresso, malt, and hints of dark chocolate. Nice flavor of espresso mixed with notes of tobacco. Medium body and creamy with a slightly oily finish, with just a hint of stickiness on the back end. Overall, this is better than the best coffee I've had and I like good coffee."
""
""
"O: Overall very tasty.  Quite a nice beer from a solid brewery.  And while it might not be as wonderful as some of the impy stouts with coffee; for everyday drinking this beer is pretty fantastic."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is an excellent Stout; another winner from Sierra Nevada."
""
"This is no Uncommon Stout.   A hoppy coffee to be sure."
""
"O- A really nice coffee stout.  Great, almost outstanding in my book.  It's definitely good enough that I wish it was a year round offering, although I wonder how viable that would be considering they already offer their standard American stout.  Either way it's a very nice beer and one that you should try and get if you are into the sweet/milk/coffee stouts. (3.91)"

"Overall: a very flavorful coffee stout that has the typical SN hop presence. Great beer."
""
"A promising beer from the initial senses, but a bit of a letdown in the feel hurt my overall enjoyment from the lofty beginning.  Still a good beer to enjoy when your in the mood for a stout."
""
""
""
""
"At the end of the bottle, I could feel a slight warming sensation buy by no means was this a typical Stout. The strength wasn't really here and there weren't notes of licorice, black sambuca, or bitter chocolate as in so many others. The dark chocolate lent a good dessert-like feel to this and this was almost like a cream stout that trended on the richer side. A solid offering form Sierra Nevada that's in line with many of their other beers - not the best example of their given style but a hallmark that's nearly impossible to dislike. Fun stuff!"
"Extremely pleasant. Not overpowering. Silky smooth. Perfect beer for a snowy winter night."
""
"boring, really just nothing special, kinda watery"
"good, but not has intense as I expected."
""
""
"Dark brown with ruby edges. There is some nice roast and - obviously - coffee notes in the nose.  The coffee flavors mesh well with the roasted malts.  The finish is nicely bitter from both the roast and the generous hoppiness."
""
"4.05 | 91 | A-"
""
"Way too thin. Coffee forward on the nose but not enough on the taste. Coffee Narwahl would be baller but this beer is average at best and not one I'll seek out again."
""
"O: If you like coffee in your stouts, Sierra Nevada Coffee Stout is for you. Very pleasant."
""
""
"Overall: A bit too burnt for my taste. Okay overall."
"Smells of coffee, looks of coffee, tastes of coffee. Is this beer?"

"Pours a black color. 1/2 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong coffee, sweet malt, and strong roasted malt. Fits the style of an American Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of coffee, sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of hop, and a hint of yeast. Overall, good but simple blend, good appearance, and simple aroma."
""
""
"A very enjoyable stout."
"Overall: One of the best coffee stouts I've had, and definitely the best beer in the snow pack. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer.  Pours black, nice tan head with nice coffee smell.  Wonderful stout flavor beer, slight cherry crossed with coffee flavor."
""
""
""
""
"This was the sleeper champion of the Snow Pack seasonal sampler. It's called Coffee Stout for a reason, because wow...what a great coffee taste and aroma this one has!  Perfect hop balance...just enough to let you know it's there, but not trying to upstage the main characters."
""
""
"Coffee, coffee, hops, coffee. Nice lacing for a stout, plenty of coffee aroma and sweet roasted malt. Drinks like a coffee black IPA. Nice contrasting flavors of coffee (duh), orange, chocolate, and caramel. Wouldn't mind a bigger body, but there's plenty here that makes me really glad I got the Snowpack."
""
""
""
"Bottled on 11-12-14, nice and fresh from a SNOW PACK.  Poured into a tulip at 55 degrees.  Pours almost completely black, with highlights of black cherry under intense light.  Creamy light khaki colored head about 1.5 inches high, fading to a thin film with nice lacing on the glass.   Smells like light bean coffee with a malty sweet background - it's definitely a hearty stout beer smell. Cold-pressed coffee mouth feel, which feels nice.  It most definitely tastes like a delicious cup of high grade black coffee.  It has medium to high carbonation, but it doesn't overwhelm the flavor.  It's just lightweight enough to not be too filling, but dark and heavy enough to know I'm drinking a stout - mostly due to the pleasant but strong coffee flavor lingering on the palette. If you love coffee and beer, this one hits the mark.  Wish they sold 12 packs of this."

"DATE TASTED: November 21, 2014... GLASSWARE: Samuel Smith pint... OCCASION: Cavs/Wiz:trying this new Cavs thing again... APPEARANCE: relatively creamy, rocky brown head; black-as-midnight body; lacing is darn near Brussels ... AROMA: roasted malty espresso punch! thick, musty and toasty--undoubtedly chocolaty and peaty... PALATE:thick as molasses, yet smooth on the tongue; finish is appreciable...TASTE: a rum-like warmth hits with a luscious coffee bean intensity; secondary notes of cola ... OVERALL: a confident, late-night wake-up of a stout that shakes the tastebuds ever-so-slightly; nice to see Sierra get into the types of micro styles they set in motion decades ago... their winter pack approaches a party must-have with this one..."

"Drinks too easy, they nailed this beer style, a nice lighter alternative to Founders Breakfast Stout"
"Overall: A very tasty stout.  Reminds me of the original year-round SN Stout with coffee flavor added."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is jet black, with a small, slick, bubbly, light tan head. You can spy some carbonation action in the body through the glass.  Aromas of heavily roasted and bitter coffee, with hints of baker's chocolate and cream. Pretty roasty. Flavors are very bitter and roasted forward, all coffee, with hints of char throughout. Wow. This is like chewing on coffee grounds, I would imagine. The body is super dry and smooth, with a heavily roasted and bitter aftertaste. The finish is smooth and dry, with a coffee linger. This is literally the embodiment of a coffee beer."

"Coffee Stout brewed by Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. ,with an ABV of 6.90 %  This brew pours out a dark brown color with a a nice light brown head. It has the look of like coffee.  The smell is rich with coffee and hops. You also pick up on some grain s, malts, and sweetness in the smell.  Now for the taste,it is rich with flavor. There is a lot going on in this brew. You pick up on the coffee and the hops.  Then the aftertaste, is smooth with flavor, and mild sweetness. Coffee Stout is like the best of both worlds coffee and brew.  This brew has a nice balance to it there is nothing over powering in it. The mouthfeel is rich and bold with flavor.  Over all I'm giving this brew a 4.75 out of 5. Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. did a nice job with this one.  One of the better brews I have had in a long time."
" Overall, I'm giving Coffee Stout - Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. a 4.75. As my first ever coffee stout, this feels like I made the right choice picking up these guys' seasonal pack today. If this gets in my area in its own cases, I will undoubtedly buy this beer again."
""
"Got this beer in a winter variety pack and I am very impressed. Poured into a pint glass. Appearance: 2 finger light brown head and spotty lacing. Dark dark brown almost black, like iced coffee. Smell: immediately get hit with coffee, chocolate, hints of malt and caramel, and some piney notes of hops. Tate: coffee and chocolate, like mocha, malt, some dark fruits, and a hint of hops that comes in at the end followed by an aftertaste of coffee. Mouthfeel: medium carbonation, more carbonation than most stouts I have had which are more on the frothy side. Overall: absolutely delicious. Definitely a winter warmer. Just added this one too my list of beers that I get for traditions sake every winter."

"Had this poured into a stout glass, my tenth Sierra Nevada review. The color was a very very dark brown, inviting in the winter. The taste is nice and smooth as you'd like for a stout, not as much coffee flavor as I'd hoped for though. Worth a shot."
""
"O - I would say a slightly above average coffee stout.  I expected more in the aroma, but this could have been due to the onset of a cold.  I was also given a frosted pint glass, which may have been the reason the head stuck to it as I drank, and a bottle that I felt was way too cold for this beer leaving me to want to re-review this another time under better circumstances"

"Overall a damn nice beer.  I hope they make this one a regular item."

"O) A notch below Founders Breakfast Stout, but hey, that's the gold standard for coffee stouts in my book. This beer is mighty tasty, and should be made available in six packs."

"Part of a winter assortment 12'er from SN who never disappoints.  Popping the top I get a smell of sweet fresh brewed coffee.  Pours into my trusty SAPP to a motor oil color with a guiness-like cascading mutlicolor transitioning head.  The head clings and reiains a trasition of colors.  On the taste this brew has a great standout coffee bitter flavor with a slightly sweet malt in the background, transitioning to a drier chaulky bitterness that then lingers through the aftertaste.  This brew is not overly sweet and has outstanding coffee accent.  Another good job by SN who always pleases."
""
""
"Well-balanced, rich coffee stout. The coffee roast is darker than I'd normally drink, but I can't fault the beer for personal taste. I pulled this out of Sierra Nevada's winter variety pack and it was the first of the four styles to disappear. If you like big, heavily roasted beers and coffee, find this."

"12oz bottle from the recent snowpack. Dark black, big tan head. Aroma us delicious coffee and roasted malts. The flavor is even better, thick coffee, stout, creamy and delicious. I wish this was in standalone six packs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really hope they make this one into a seasonal offering all to itself. Its a damn good stout and you cannot beat the price. I honestly don't know how Sierra Nevada keeps doing this. I have recently purchased a few of their high end stouts and because of the size I want to share them, but If this is any indication I have a feeling the Maple or BA Narwhal might be my first 5 review!"

"Pours black, forming a solid, creamy head that settles to sticky, bubbly pools on top.  Aroma has that fresh, deep coffee bean smell that I need in anything calling itself a coffee beer.  Roasted, nutty, fruity beans covered with a dusting of dark cocoa.  Flavor keeps the quality coffee presence alive and ups the dark chocolate a little, adding some cream and sugar to the finish.  The coffee is strong enough to handle whatever sweetness the malts add.  Lingering prune and slight earthy char.  Medium bodied and decently creamy, drying out nicely at the end.  Damn good coffee stout."
"The Verdict: Very good. Nothing outstanding, but a very solid brew with no surprises. Coffee + Beer = Good."

"Jet black  with a tinge of brown around edges in the light. 1/2 finger of tan head. Aromas of roasted coffee  (dark roast), dark malts... smells like morning. Clean (coffee) bitterness, different from hop bitterness, smooth, dark, and balanced. Slightly heavier than the normal SN mouthfèel, nice aftertaste. Just plain outstanding!"

"Pours out dark brown, almost black, with a tan head that stays throughout the end of the glass.  Smells like coffee, straight up.  Flavor is very coffee forwarded with loads of roasted malts to back it up.  Light sweetness - finishes up lightly tart and dry.  Lingering coffee aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is fairly thin and light - not overpowering or overbearing.  A coffee stout for coffee stout lovers."

"o: A solid coffee stout, especially at the low price point.  More coffee flavor than Narragansett Autocrat, not as easy drinking as a result, but then this has significantly higher ABV to cover."

"O: A very nice coffee stout that combines coffee, chocolate, and fruit notes very well. Easy to drink while remaining complex and thick enough to be a sipper. Definitely a great winter brew at a great value in the mix pack"
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, it had pretty much everything that I look for in the style and I enjoyed drinking it.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, dry on the finish, not filling at all and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I could probably drink a few of these and I can't say that for many Coffee Stouts.  What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style it was and the drinkability, i thought they were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the body, i wish it was just a little thicker.  I would buy this beer again and it would be nice to be able to buy this on it's own and I think it makes for a great cold weather beer.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Coffee Stouts, it's for sure worth a try.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it turned out to be a pretty good Coffee Stout and I think it can hold it's own in the style, but Founders Breakfast Stout is till my favorite of the style and it isn't my favorite Sierra Nevada beer, but I do think it's one of the better beers I've had from them.  Good job guys this was a tasty Coffee Stout and I think you guys made a good move putting this in the winter variety pack, keep up the good work."
"Great beer for what it is. Strong coffee nose, coffee forward, coffee aftertaste, mocha colored head with dark coffee color. You can taste sweet malt back there but definitely one for fans of coffee.Coffee stouts seem to be a bit of a fad right now. It puts me in a bit of a paradox: should I be drinking it in the morning or at night? Oh, what the hell, it's all good in this case."
""
""
"Pours out jet black and leaves a small mocha head that dissipates rather fast while leaving beautiful lacing down the glass. Nice and roasty up front with a rich coffee, toffee, earthy, sweetness, and slight dark fruit. When trying it for the first time you get the roasted bitterness like the nose.  Then you pick up the sweet toffee, nuttiness, earthy hops, then in the finish i s some strong lingering coffee.  The body of the beer is medium to light and seems rather slick and dry.  I like my stouts a little fuller bodied then this.  Overall this is a really strong tasting coffee stout, not shying away from the full flavor of coffee here.  Not the best stout but an enjoyable one at that. If you like coffee and stouts look out for Sierra Nevada's snow pack, Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Dark, cola looking, opaque with a fluffy head, nice lacing to the end. Smell is certainly coffee with some cocoa and caramel. Flavor is like a cold cup of espresso, with a bit of the chocolate flavors, as well a some sweet caramel and roasty dark malt. The mouthfeel was thinner than I expected for such a dark stout, but very clean and creamy. Overall, I really like this beer, hope that Sierra Nevada makes this a year-round offering."

"everything else about this brew is close enough to spot on as to be a reference for the style, but the singular aspect that made my evening is the aroma at first whiff . . . beautifully rich, dark, full bodied scent of freshly ground beans. if you don't drink it, you really should at least smell it. nice job, SN."

"Excellent coffee stout. Try this now."
"This tastes like a coffee stout should, like roasted coffee. Not a lot of nuance or complexity just strong roast. There is some chocolate malt and I might have found a bit of caramel but the coffee is huge. My only complaint is that this is a bit too thin for a stout but it doesn't weigh on your stomach."
"M: fairly thick, with medium/low carbonation. how a stout should be."
""
"i didnt get as much coffee out of this as i had hoped for, but thats about my only real critique of an otherwise beautiful beer. i think because their hoppy stuff is so good, that sierra nevada gets overlooked for their dark beer sometimes. not fair, this is really good. obsidian black with a similar shine and over an inch of lasting mocha bubble lace on top. more roast than coffee on the nose, although the coffee is there in the back with a dried fruit character to it. im surprised the body is as light as it is, not to say its light, but that its not thick and heavy like stouts can be. not sure if i dig that or not, but it is immediately noticeable. dark chalky malts meet some caramel sweetness in the middle, its very well rounded in its grain base. the coffee is subtle and its all in the finish, i could stand to see this ramped up just a bit, but i like it as an accent flavor too. the beer tastes rich but feels quite delicate, lending to drinkability. nice cold weather beer, i always like the one off stuff in these mix boxes they do. this is a good one."
""

"O- Man, this is a great coffee stout.  I really hope they keep making this one and it's not exclusive to the Snowpack."

"I (re-)learned my lesson from the previous debacle and began backing off of my heavy-handed pour a little earlier this time. I still created a nice pseudo-cascade which developed into almost precisely three fingers of dense, deep-tan/light-brown head with great retention.  Color was Dark Brown to Very Dark Brown (SRM = > 27, "

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 9/12/2014. Pours nearly opaque very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, caramel, toast, cream, brown sugar, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and lactose notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, caramel, toast, cream, brown sugar, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of roasted/herbal hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and lactose flavors; with a great malt bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and slightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent coffee stout! All around great robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and lactose flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Well balanced. Bitterness and coffee flavor is not overwhelming. Perfect malt sweetness. Overall, a solid coffee stout. I wish they made this in a six pack."
""

"This is a good stout, and a decent coffee stout. I don't think it's anything special. It's well-crafted, consistent, and drinkable."
"O:  A very good beer.  I do actually prefer the regular SN Stout over this one, though,  as it's a little sweeter and creamier"
""
" The taste has bittersweet cocoa flavor with dark burnt brownie crust up front and a kind of roast coffee flavor with sweet malt combination and slight dark sugar and bittterness of hops or dark malt I am not sure which. The flavor is intenslely roasted in the long finish with mild sweetness trading off with mild bitter taste in the mostly dry finish. This is a quality coffee stout with light hop bitterness which adds a nice balance-very drinkable as expected from Sierra Nevada with plenty of coffee flavor yet you still taste the base stout which is great."
""
"Simple coffee stout.  Really nice roasty coffee character followed by a slight sweetness.  Really liking this."
""
""
"O- a straight forward coffee stout that packs plenty of coffee flavor, while remaining very drinkable, well done"
"This is a great beer. I get a very aromatic smell of iced coffee and dark chocolate. The taste, even better. Very nice carbonation on the tongue up front which makes it thirst quenching and wanting more. Then the coffee and the same malts they use in their porter come together to make an amazing iced coffee beer. They should definitely put this in six packs and make it year round. Perfect body not watery at all. The body and mouthfeel of this beer compare with higher alcohol coffee stous or stouts in general. Its great to see a brewery that thrives on hop forward beers absolutely nail a darker beer."

"O:  Excellent coffee beer.  This one makes the snow pack worth the purchase for sure."

"I would get this beer again it's like their world class stout through a Randall filled with coffee beans. Great beer!"
""

"Clean and dry in finish, the stout's full carbonation lifts the sweetness from the palate and promotes an arid coffee-like closure upon the palate. Leaving behind a slight roasty, peppery and tannic bite the aftertaste is awash with cocoa and faint ash."

"Overall - SN nailed this one; a very tasty beer. Do yourself a favor and let it warm up a bit before enjoying - the flavors pop as it starts to warm. With the current popularity of flavored stouts, I have a feeling SN would sell the shit out of this if they released it outside of a variety pack."

"Overall - very nice coffee stout and at a great price, which is par for the course for SN!"

"Taste is bold coffee with plenty of cocoa notes as well, and some trace of dark fruit underneath the palate. Roasty, dark, and full to the brim with flavor, this is a lovely brew for either morning or night!"
""
"Overall: It seems like most coffee beers are either 5% abv beers, which seem watery with all the coffee, or massive Imperial Stouts.  It is great to have something in between."

"4.28/5"
"Bottle. Pours very black with any in, tan head. Light lacing. Aroma is coffee forward with a milky note. Cold brew coffee. Roasty and just a tad bit chocolatey. The flavor clearly coffee-driven but it lacks much bitterness that I usually up equate to genuine coffee flavor. It isn't necessarily a bad thing. Coffee with cream and sugar. Finishes fairly sweet. Medium bodied. Actually very easy to slurp back. Pretty good, especially for a presumed one-off beer in a mix-pack."

"Overall: 3.5-Sierra Nevada never disappoints me and this beer is no exception.  My relatively low score is simply because I do not like the Coffee Stout style.  Who wants to drink a nearly 7% beer in the morning (other than Jim Morrison), or conversely, who wants to have a coffee buzz while drinking beer at night?  Regardless, this came with the sample pack and I tried it out and was not a big fan.  Hope you are."

"Picked up the ""Snow Pack"" largely because of this, and it didn't disappoint. I'd really like this to be a more frequent release in six packs, maybe to replace one of their lackluster seasonal IPAs (all of them other than Celebration)."
""
"Love this, my favorite of the snowpack. It reminds a bit of Breakfast Stout in it's coffee character. This is what I want in a session/non-imperial stout, lots of coffee and chocolate yet very drinkable and relatively light bodied"

"This is a very fine beer. Tons of coffee/espresso, the right amount of roast, a nice chocolate flavor. Very creamy and smooth. A steal at a buck a bottle."

"Overall: A very good take on a coffee stout. Good mix of roasty coffee and chocolate notes with some nice creamy sweetness."

"Overall, freshness is popping drink these coffee stouts while fresh...pure excellence in my glass I'm shocked at the quality of this beer, I will be seeking out another 12 pack."

"Overall - A commendable coffee stout from Sierra. Doesn't quite break the mold and stand out from the pack, but it's rather enjoyable. It's a hard style to screw up, but even harder to make a truly outstanding example, so there's no shame in this one. If you're a coffee stout lover, you'll want to try this one."
