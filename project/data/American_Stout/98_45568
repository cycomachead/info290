Some dark fruits, booze, and maybe another chocolate malt would have taken this up another level and with offerings like the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout still on the shelf, why reach for this? It's only a go if you plan on downing a few at a time to go with your dessert of the moment.","JerzDevl2000","Feb 21, 2015"

It does meet the requirements for the style, but personally I can't drink more than one of these. Somebody left a six pack of this at my house, it's not a beer I would ever seek out and buy. I personally don't understand why somebody would want their beer to taste like chocolate - that's why there's cocoa. I could see it if there was a hint of chocolate, but this one is way over the top with the chocolate. It is what it purports to be and meets the style guidelines but I really don't like it and find it somewhat of a chore to drink.","LarryV","Jan 11, 2015"

Taste of milk chocolate, vanilla bean, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, toast, coffee, and light cream. Slight coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, roasted malt, and coffee on the finish for a good bit. Good flavor balance with a fair amount of robustness; but it feels a little watered down for a stout; zero cloying flavors are present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is ok; feels a bit thin. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good sweet stout. Fairly robust with nice chocolate dessert flavor; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 07, 2013"

4.36,20.1,3.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"Harpoon Chocolate Stout has a black look to it. It's a stout so that's expected. Anywho, the liquid is black and the cap up top is a half inch of dark tannish foam leaving no lace on the glass. The liquid looks dead after a while but some swirls bring it back. This smells straight up like chocolate syrup. It reminds me of a less Diabetic form of Southern Tier Choklat. Basically, it smells like chocolate and some roasted malt, nothing else, a str8 up chocolate stout, no bells or whistles. Taste is chocolate, mixed in with slight grain notes and a roasty finish reminding me of a light porter, even though this remains in the stout category. Body is a step below medium with a light but felt carb. Truthfully, I could drink a lot of this and still like it after a while. The body is at a level where long sips or even chugging is possible, so drinkability is quite high. This was a surprise and a treat at the same time. I see myself drinking more of this in the future willingly. Hey, what do you know, a Harpoon beer that I want to come back to.

It reminds me of stealing those slightly bitter chocolate chips from my mom when she was baking cookies. But I docked on the mouthfeel. It was way lighter than I expected, and just didn't feel like a stout. If it was thicker, this would be one of my favorites. Of course I would get this again, but I can only imagine what it would taste like with that creamy yummy feel...","BWED","Dec 10, 2012"

It pours a rich sable just a snip above black with a very thick and quite persistent tan head. Malty flavor has a strong overtone of chocolate, decadent and not too sweet, hints of coffee and caramel, just a whisper of fruit. Texture, though, is a bit weak - body and fizz are both lacking. However, that is the only weak spot in an otherwise scrumptious brewski. Finish is chocolaty and just a little smoky. Overall, quite satisfying.","Cyberkedi","Nov 17, 2012"

The smell probably set me up for unmet expectations. The beer was a bit lighter in body than I would prefer from a stout.

4.02,10.7,3.5,4,4,4.5,4," Thiis chocolate stout is tasty with plenty of chocolate malt up front, but it is no fudgesicle either. It is a solid base stout with some roasted malt character and there is a nice addition of cocoa giving a slight dessert like character with the general sweetness of the caramel in the malt. The taste is slightly bitter with some light herbal hop flavors in the background but generally this is a malt dominated beer with leaning more to the sweet side than dry which makes the taste seem fuller. I enjoyed this since it is not cloying yet it achieves the goal of incorporating the chocolate into the stout well, I would go for this again if the opportunity were to present itself.","Slatetank","Nov 22, 2011"

4.07,12.1,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is jet black, with an oily brown head that is densely packed, small, tight bubbles that form a half inch layer of foam. Decent lacing when you swirl the brew in the glass. The nose is all milk chocolate, and it smells like freshly melted, hot milk chocolate. Like you broke into the Hershey factory and took a bath in a vat of chocolate. My sweet tooth just creamed itself. Flavors are a bit more blended, with the chocolate front and center, but a good balance of dark roasted coffee to provide some bitterness to counter the sweet. A little burnt/charred character, also. Very well blended flavors keep the beer from being cloying or overly rich. Bravo. The aftertaste is fairly nondescript, with a slight milky flavor to it. The aftertaste is almost like when your mom made your chocolate milk for you, and by no means did she ever use enough syrup. That's the aftertaste, although as a child it was disappointing, it's fairly pleasant here. The finish is surprisingly dry, leaving a fairly clean palate behind to allow the drinker to continue the chocolatey indulgence. Very tasty brew, while still providing a good representation of the style.","GarthDanielson","0"

Had started foamy, but settled down to trace of lacing then just a thin layer that clung well. Aroma switched between bitter chocolate, malt, and lactose sugar. As it rested it shifted to a Hershey's chocolate bar aroma. Flavor was interesting. It definitely had chocolate notes, but wasn't a cohesive flavor. Started off a bit like milk, but then left a watery chocolate flavor in the mouth as it finished. And then if you thought about it, it finished off with a bitter burnt oat flavor. Felt ok in the mouth, a bit acidic, but coated well, needed a tad more carbonation. Overall it was just average. Wasn't an off putting chocolate flavor, but wasn't a strong stout either.

From there it moves into a somewhat chemical-chocolate flavor, that fades to a mellow combination of roasted malt and chocolate. The finish on this beer is really nice, but what leads into it is not all that fantastic. Moutfeel is moderately thick with a pretty weak carbonation. This one would benefit by having some more body to it. The carbonation is where I would expect. Overall, this one is not doing it for me. The harshness of the burnt character and the sweetness of the chocolate don't play well together. Its not the worst chocolate beer I have had, but I wouldn't go for it again.","kmpitz2","Jun 13, 2010"

Plenty of chocolate elements such as cocoa nibs, and bittersweet chocolate. A little smoke as well. Sadly the flavor does not live up to the aroma. The added chocolate is too dominating and not letting the malt play a flavoring role. A little fruit and coffee elements as well. Not overly complex or appealing chocolate flavor.

Its aroma is that of a slightly bittersweet dark chocolate, with a hint of mocha. Its taste is bold, kinda like someone melted a really fine dark chocolate bar, mixed it with some Baileys and then carbonated it all. Its incredible. My initial reaction was surprise for such a bold taste, I had assumed it would be a much more subtle flavor, I was very pleasantly surprised. Its mouthfeel is slightly creamy. I've enjoyed this from both a bottle, and chilled pint glass, both were enjoyable, but I must say I preferred the bottle, the carbonation was heavier in the bottle, and really complements the bold flavor. Its drinkability pretty fine, they go back nice and easy, but then may not be a beer you could or would want to chain drink. It also made on of the greatest dessert beers I've ever enjoyed, It may be the greatest beer for a beerfloat (beer & ice cream, preferably coffee or vanilla) that I've tried.

3.15,-13.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"The beer pours a dark, black color with a very thin tan head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has an over the top chocolate scent that boasts of cocoa and chocolate malts. The taste is average. It has a decent roasted feel with tons of chocolate flavoring added. This one is really horrible. It goes down with lots of prickly carbonation and finishes chalky with a hot cocoa taste. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a medium/full bodied with too much CO2. This is a brew for the scrap heap. I was just starting to like Harpoon's beers again, but this one may have changed my mind.","WesWes","Jan 20, 2009"
3.87,6.6,3.5,4,4,3,4,"The drink is light in body with just enough carbonation and is quite chocolatey without becoming obnoxiously so. At a surprising 6.3% abv, Harpoon's Chocolate Stout is a little potent for sessionability, but quite quaffable nonetheless. A fine offering from the ""Wintry Mix"" sample pack, and one I'd buy again under the right circumstances.","cvstrickland","Jan 17, 2009"
3,-17.4,3,3,3,3,3,"I was really looking forward to this brew and is the primary reason why I picked up the mix pack, though I really do like all of the other brews in it. The brew poured to a almost pitch black color, had some brown like highlights, smallish head that is tan in color and fades quickly. Limited lacing. The aroma, wow, almost like semi-sweet chocolate syrup and some toasted malts. The flavor is all chocolate for me, some roasted malts but it really is just a dry chocolate flavor. For me it was to much, it actually was difficult for me to get through. I would imagine that for some folks this is great, but not a stout that I like.","Stimack","Jan 07, 2009"
1.79,-50.7,3.5,2,1,3,2,"Overall: To be honest I wouldn't go out of my way for this. The chocolate flavor seems like a processed liquid extract and not very pleasant. I feel like I'm taking a sip of some watered down liquor. Not my favorite.","AtlasBrew","Jan 03, 2009"
3.36,-7.4,2.5,4,3.5,2.5,3,"Pours a cola-colored brown, rapidly fading tan head leaves a handful of spots of lace on the glass. Smells like a chocolate glazed Dunkin Donut, or maybe a bowl full of Count Chocula....way wicked chocolatey smell! Taste doesn't really ""bring it"" as far as the fake chocolatey food flavors go, but there's enough choco-goodness to put a smile on my face. Seems a little thin for the style (yes, I know it's not an ""Imperial", and I'm fine with it). This is interesting enough, and certainly worth a try, but nothing I'd really go out of my way for in the future.","corey0212","Jan 02, 2009"
3.05,-16,3,3,3,3.5,3,"D I would not buy a case or even a six of this, but an occasional bottle would be ok. It's not that is bad it's just not the style of beer I would drink on a regular basis.","confer","Dec 28, 2008"
4.47,23.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: Very drinkable beer. I wish this wasn't only available in the winter 12 pack with only 2 bottles per pack. I really enjoyed this one.","erosier","Dec 26, 2008"
4.24,16.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"All in all, an interesting and impressive brew. probably the most chocolaty brew I've tried, short of pouring chocolate syrup into a stout. Almost an overload on the chocolate, but this one pulls it off. Mouthfeel left a bit to be desired, but all in all I'm impressed. If you like chocolate, this is a must try. Not really sessionable, but if I ever have the opportunity to get a few more bottles, there'd be no hesitation.","djeucalyptus","Dec 26, 2008"
2.86,-21.2,2.5,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Drinkability - the beer is not very heavy at all, but not yet a light beer. Really had trouble finishing the bottle. Have had other chocolate stouts that are way better, Rogue and Brooklyn for example.","matt062286","Dec 20, 2008"
3.5,-3.6,4,4,3.5,3,3,"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle with a date marked 03/15/09B-312. The dark baked chocolate aroma penetrates the nose as soon as I pry the bottle cap off. It pours a very dark, almost black tone with a lingering tan head. The taste is very chocolately with a little hops in the background. It is a bit overwhelming but it really isn't too bad but it is not something I would buy regularly.","puboflyons","Beers"
4.02,10.7,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Update 12-2009: I really like the cocoa powder chocolate character of this beer. It is a bit lighter bodied than the typical winter stout, less coffee tasting as well. The milk shake ovaltine description is fitting.","albern","0"
4.19,15.4,4,5,4,3.5,4,"Overall: I'd have liked it to be more full bodied and perhaps higher alcohol, like an imperial stout. Still, though, this is pretty decent stuff. Just keep in mind it's only 6.3% ABV.","FenwaySquid","Dec 18, 2008"
4.29,18.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Had in their winter sample pack. The appearance is jet black with a brown-colored lacing on the sides. Really thin head though. Aromas are really rich in a smoked mocha chocolate flavor. Noticed a hint of toffee, but much more of a dark chocolate. Taste is really great, representative of the aromas. Bittersweet dark chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel helps with a light carbonation to an otherwise creamy drink that is also pretty light comparatively. Overall, a fantastic chocolate stout.","fitzy84","Dec 14, 2008"
3.35,-7.7,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Overall, a highly confusing experience. This beer is decent, but ultimately sells the whole ""chocolate"" thing too eagerly. It should be the sideshow, not the main event. At the end of the day, Stout is the ringleader.","MattCote","Dec 08, 2008"

3.39,-6.6,3.5,4.5,3,3,3,"D'oh! Had such high hopes for this offering from Harpoon. Pours a dark brown as you'd expect in a chocolate, and the aroma is pure chocolate. Like smelling a vat of melted Hershey's. Unbelieveable aroma. Really hoped that the taste would match, but no. Falls very flat. Slight chocolate taste, very light cocoa notes, but if it weren't for the nose I wouldn't be sure this is a chocolate. Maybe Harpoon will refine the taste as it evolves if they keep it as an option, 'cause not there yet. Southern Tier Choklat and Rogue Choc Stout still the best two chocolates by far...","bjoyce12","Dec 05, 2008"

3.68,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 oz. bottle from Harpoon's Wintery seasonal 12 pack. Pours a dark brown with ruby edges. Small tan head and no lacing. Smell is all chocolate. Palate is a bit thin for a stout. However, after drinking it, you feel full. Taste is chocolate. Perhaps with a touch of cherry. Chocolate covered cherries anyone? Not a whole lot of complexity here. Although it,s far from perfect, it was enjoyable. To bad you only get 2 out of the 12 pack.","mcox90","Nov 21, 2008"

3.08,-15.2,4.5,4,2.5,2.5,3,"Pours very dark with mahogany hues shining through when held to the light. Great, frothy, light brown head that retains forever! Smells like Hersheys syrup. So far, so good...then tasting the beer, it goes downhill. There's a certain off-taste right up front that sticks to the palate. Sort of tinny, along with chocolate syrup, and a weird cherry-like flavor. Semi dry finish, light carbonation, pretty thin. It's okay at best. Great looking beer, smells pretty promising, then let down by the actual substance of the brew - the flavor. Close, but no cigar.","Doomcifer","Nov 11, 2008"
1.84,-49.3,3.5,2,1.5,2.5,1.5,"The chocolate in this beer tastes very artificial and does not meld well with the malt. Bottle says there is ""chocolate flavor"" added, whatever the hell that means. I think the metallic taste is from the chocolate flavoring, not very sweet for a chocolate stout. Overall, i wouldn't recommend it.","bum732","Nov 07, 2008"
3.8,4.7,4,4,4,4,3,"12oz bottle from a mixed 12pack from Market Basket. Pours an almost opaque black with few ruby-red highlights and a quarter inch of light tan head. Smells strongly of chocolate malt (not chocolate), reminiscent of espresso beans. Espressso beans dominate the flavor as well with a malty sweetness. Flavor actually reminds me a lot of a less alcoholic Kahlua. Very similar to Kahlua, which doesn't bother me since I really like Kahlua. Medium in body with ample carbonation. Not the most drinkable beer in the world, though it wasn't much work to finish the glass. A unique interesting beer unlike any I've had. Perhaps a more fitting name would be 'Coffee Stout' rather than a chocolate stout, though I understand the name. Glad I tried it, definitely worth a try. I may try cooking with this one too - I think it may add a unique pleasant character to a chocolate pudding or brownies (see Saunders' 'Best of American Beer and Food' to see what I mean). Not a bad beer overall.","MrHurmateeowish","Nov 06, 2008"
2.87,-20.9,3,3.5,3,2.5,2,"Overall I'm glad there's only two of these in the mix pack. I couldn't drink more than that. The flavors were too quirky - just didn't do it for me.","matsputis","Nov 04, 2008"

Sadly, though, even as I poured this the anticipation waned, as what came out looked more like a porter than a stout proper. The chocolate aroma was quite nice, the head very lacking and the taste was a bit medicinal. I went back to my pal Munich Dark thereafter, a bit disappointed.","selecter70","Nov 04, 2008"
4.2,15.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"HUGE chocolate flavor all around. It reminds me of the Ommegang Chocolate Indulgence, but the OCI was more dry. This stuff is a purer/smooth chocolate taste.

It seems rather thin on mouthfeel and it did get off to a good start with the aroma. Taste is in the middle due to the carbonation.
