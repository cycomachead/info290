The brew smells like coffee, roasted malt, and some bittersweet chocolate. The taste is the same as the aroma, it's all coffee, roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, and a nice coffee stout.

Head leaves behind even patterned speckled lacing as it dwindles. Aroma dark chocolate, strong espresso dark nearly burnt malts. Black patent malt with some coffee notes. As it warms I get more creamed coffee notes in the nose, than I did initially out of the fridge. Dry roasted malts it's a one note flavor profile with dark nearly burnt old coffee water, the texture is so watery for a stout and the Luna Coffee mentioned on the label is lacking big time hints of dry roasted coffee but nothing like I've tasted in other coffee beers. Mild green fruity character shows up after a few sips even hints of sourdough bread, really a dry roasted malt fest. One pint bottles is pretty nice, a beer out of Green Bay, the Steelers would have won the superbowl if this beer were against any of the dark offerings from East End in the Burgh. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh with astringent dark roasted malts and coffee beans, leaves an unpleasant bitterness on the palate and for a stout this is a dry stout with coffee that is remarkably thin for being a stout. Carbonation is moderate doesn't add or take anything away from the party, this is my second straight coffee beer and I'm wide awake...guess what the coffee infused amber ale I just had sleighed this big brusing pitch black coffee stout from the North.","WVbeergeek","Mar 07, 2012"

The aroma is bordering on a big bag of coffee grinds, with the slightest hint of dark chocolate hidden in there. Flavors are rich and strong, and heavy in (you guessed it) coffee. Dark roasted and slightly bitter, the coffee profile rides a somewhat creamy and sweet backbone of malt. Flavors are a bit one dimensional. Smooth bodied, but the overt bitterness gives it a somewhat dry feel, as well. Very dynamic on the tongue and in mouth. The head retention is impressive. The aftertaste is a mild version of the taste, with a slowly weening coffee profile. The finish is slightly drying, with a slight linger to the roastiness.

It's not a super charged up stout, but it's got great flavor, although lacking in body. Coffee is the dominant flavor, with bitterness mostly coming from that and the roasted barley, but it's balanced out by a mellow sweetness. All in all, this is tasty, but it's a bit "watery" and could definitely use a little more body.

Appetizing aroma of chocolate, coffee, nuts, and a little earthiness. This beer needs to warm sufficiently in order for the coffee flavor to blend into the beer. Otherwise it seems it is not a well intergrated ingredient. After the warming, the chocolate and coffee really come out and show off. A little earthiness from the hops as well. Bitterness seems to come from the coffee. Coffee aftertaste with just a touch of sweetness in the finish. Moderate body and a little overcarbonated. Otherwise this beer has a very good mouthfeel. A pretty good coffee beer and quite drinkable.","morimech","Sep 02, 2010"

3.47,-4.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"(D)- A no nonsense coffee stout with the flavor you would expect. I could see having a few of these around for Fall.","sweemzander","Aug 21, 2010"
4.15,14,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This was my first beer from Hinterland and I was impressed. This had some rather robust and roasty coffee flavors but stayed well balanced with the sweetness and the nitro-pour and accessible body on this really kicked the drinkibility up a notch. Well done.","Kegatron","Jul 26, 2010"

3.97,9.1,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"D: Overall, this is a very enjoyable coffee stout and it's quite easy to drink. Picked up a little too much roasted bitterness in the taste, especially on teh finish. But I would definitely have this again.","oregonskibum","Jun 09, 2010"
4.07,11.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"D - I wish this had a bit more heft - it's imperative that you drink this at cellar temp or above, because it's nearly lifeless directly from the refrigerator. All in all, a good beer.","trbergman","May 27, 2010"

3.64,0,5,3.5,3,5,4,"I had this on-tap at the Hinterland location on Erie St in Milwaukee. Hinterland doesn't brew at this location, and the Hinterland beer served there is shipped down from Green Bay (as I understand it).","BeerBelcher","Nov 13, 2007"
