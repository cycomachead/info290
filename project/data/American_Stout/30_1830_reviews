"Overall- An OK stout, I was expecting much more from Avery."
"straightforward.  pours with almost no head, very very dark.  hoppy with very little malt flavor.  almost closer to a porter (or black ipa) than a stout.  still, a tasty brew."
""
"O-I wasn't expecting much from this brew. I don't know why, regardless this is an excellent stout. Worth seeking out."
""
"Not bad, but in world with many better - not again for me."
""
""
"The taste brings out a coffee, grainy character with an earthy bitter bite at the end."
""
""
"O:  Solid beer.  Would have again."
""
""
""
""
"Please Avery, adjust your mash temperatures."
""
"O: I usually really enjoy the offerings from Avery, but this one just didn't do it for me -- especially not the flavor."
"Poured from a bottle into a stout glass. Black in color with a quickly dissolving head that leaves lacing on the side.  Smells like roasted black coffee and subtle roasted barley.  Tastes like black coffee with subtle hints of bitter chocolate that works with the coffee taste.  It has a medium body with light carbonation. It is thin for a stout, but not so thin that it is watery,  with a barely noticeable hop flavor as swallowing. This is something that is probably very good on tap, but just good bottled."

"O- Decent stout, the hops used in this is a bit different than typical American stouts, but the roastiness and hops come together for a very tasty if bitter combination."

"Overall:  Damn, this is another great stout!  Seriously bold flavors of roasted malt, beautifully balanced with some sweetness and hops!  Absolutely delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An alright stout, nothing amazing. Would try again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Basic stout good smell but overall nothing makes it outstanding but a decent stout overall worth a try"
""
""
"Overall - This stout has a promising aroma, but that's about it. The taste is a bland mess. Maybe 10 months of shelf life has killed what might be an otherwise great stout, but I'm not getting much of what might have been. Candidate for a re-review, but to be blunt my expectations with a fresher bottle isn't very high."
""
""
"Chocolate malt flavor coming through, but expecting more roasted for a stout."

"Pours a very dark brown that is almost black with ruby highlights. Close to a 1-finger beige head is seen that settles down to a 3mm of so after a bit. Sheets of lacing is seen that sticks to the sides of the glass when sipped. The aroma is of roasted malts with a good amount of cocoa. Pretty much the same is said for the taste with a light hint of coffee, unlike some stouts that have a lot. Just a very slight bitter finish which is probably from the semi-sweet cocoa. Very tasty and goes go easy. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation for this brew style. Overall, I liked this one."

"The taste has a lot of roasted malts and tobacco with a thick char and ash feel."
""
""
""
""
"I think this an underrated beer. It pours very dark brown, almost black, with a nice one-finger beige head that recedes fairly quickly. It smells and tastes like dark chocolate with coffee notes, with a decent hop presence in the background--sort of like a junior imperial stout. This is a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- A very solid stout that I've been wanting to try for a while now.  Drinkable, flavorful and with a bit of a hop kick.  I'm on board."

"A decent stout, but this is the junior varsity compared to Mephistopheles.  If you want a 6-pack of a drinkable stout rather than going for the gusto, then this is a good choice.  But as good as Avery is with their bigger beers, why not gear up for that instead?"
""
""
""
"Poured midnight black into the old snifter. 1 finger of ecru (the wife's word) head, with very small bubbles. She's a looker. This had some nice mild coffee and chocolate aromas, with a nice, faint tobacco note as well. The tobacco note transferred to the taste, and the slight sweetness, nice malty notes, and slight bitterness were good, but not the complete package. Mouthfeel was rather light for the style, but nothing worrisome. I must admit, this is a good stout. I am a bit partial to bigger stouts myself, and this may have clouded my judgment just a little bit. Solid, but maybe more of a tick than a keeper for me."

"Pitch black until disturbed, at which point it goes a little brown. Light tan head. Aroma is coffee and dark bread. Taste is similar with more pronounced coffee and earthy hops. Nice weight"

"Excellent regular stout.  Nice roasty qualities with some malt complexity and a subtle hop presence.  Pleasant but not overwhelming makes for a drinkable experience."
"O: A more than solid stout, definitely recommended if you like stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It’s a decent enough stout."
""
""

"This beer is dark brown / black color. It has a decent foamy head. The aroma is filled with cocoa toasted malts. Not too heavy or too light. This was a pretty good beer. I know thhat I enjoyed this beer. I would like to have it again if I can find it again."

"This pours a dark brown/black color with a decent, foamy head. The aroma is filled with cocoa, coffee, and toasted malts. The flavor is well-balanced and smooth. It’s a stout that isn’t too heavy or too light. Smooth malts and cocoa are very evident. This finishes a with a bit of chalky, malt after taste."

"Very drinkable overall, and with some really great flavours to it. This could be a genuinely superb brew if it were a bit bigger... I say that, and then remember that perhaps the ""bigger"" version of this is something like Avery's Mephistopheles Stout. And, yes, that is a beer throbbing with indescribable power. I guess it's no bad thing to be the smaller, wimpier brother to a beer like that."

"A flavorful beer from Avery, a bit lighter than I look for in an American stout. Interesting flavor profile, but for some reason, this beer just doesn't call my name."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 12/22/2012. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, biscuit, light toffee, light nuttiness, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, biscuit, light toffee, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Moderate roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, biscuit, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt flavors; with a good roast/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and moderately dry/chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice stout. All around good balance and complexity of very roasty, dark, and bready malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - If you like dry, bitter stouts this might be your thing, but overall I was disappointed. Poor mouthfeel, not very well balanced, and in my opinion could use either some sweetness or richness to balance this thing out. I really like Avery, but not their best effort here."
"O: Great beer, especially for the price: $1.50/bottle. Would love to see a larger version of this beer with a little more to chew on. I'd recommend ""Off-Piste-ing"" or maybe ""Piste'd Off""."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark brown at 56 degrees with a small tan creamy head. Aromas of chocolate, coffee and malts abound. Coffee predominates the taste, with a chocolate nuttiness. Decent bitterness. The carbonation tingles the tongue, but the mouth is light for a stout. This is a nice stout, and excellent at this price ($1.40)."
""

"Will review it again after it gets warm"

"Overall, a very good, everyday stout. Not too dry, and it displays a fair amount of dark flavors."

"Avery Brewing Out Of Bounds Stout ---4/5."
""
""
""

""

"Great balance of sweetness and roasty bitterness. The chocolate character is pleasant. There's a bit of harshness that's offputting."
"D: This was a nice stout. Nothing special, but the scent was solid. The taste and body could have been better, and the finish was a little rough. So it wasn't the easiest to drink, but still not a bad brew."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a well executed low abv stout. Lots of flavor for a lighter stout."
""
""
""
"Feel is not particularly substantial but the relative thinness of it does make a good match for the crisper taste. Overall this is easily drinkable and a nice attempt at doing something different, without any real missteps, but at the same time it doesn't really stand out. It's worth trying if you get a good price; if you're more of an IPA person this would probably be a decent gateway to the heavier dark beers."
"Overall: Quite nice. Would definitely drink again."

"O: Nice one here. I'd love to try it a bit fresher so the hops will be more defined. Right now, however, it's solid but unexceptional. I'm on the fence about buying this one again."

"Overall, this is tame, very tasty and easily moves it's way into the starter stouts."

"Not a bad effort yet, nothing about this stout really jumps out and grabs me."
"Pours a dark brown color. 1/2 inch head of a dark tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight alcohol, hint of pine, and a hint of dark citrus. Fits the style of an American Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable bitterness. Tastes of strong roasted malt, sweet malt, slight hops, hint of pine, hint of dark citrus, and slight alcohol. Overall, good appearance, body, aroma is simple, and the blend is dramatically bent towards roasted malt flavors and bitterness."

"o: A surprise that it tastes so much like a porter, apparently a hopped-up stout. Perhaps a bit thin for a porter and definitely for a stout, nevertheless a quality brew and a bargain at the $1.25 it cost me. I'd definitely buy more ...the next time I want porter."

"i was going to hate this beer but the more i drink the better it got great color looks good in a glass says the ypound it with hops but its not a factor here it just has a bitter sweet taste and it a stout so im saying try it you may like it a rosaty good fun beer enjoy"

"The beer is black with a small, broken head. The aroma offers some light roast and chocolate. Super smooth and easy drinking. Man, you've got to love a good cask ale...nothing like it. Light in body with a mild chocolate and roast character working together nicely. Also, a bit of bready malt and a hint of bitterness in the finish. Solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-As I mentioned above, there is a quite a mixture of smells and flavors here. Sometimes that is a good thing, but here the flavors don't seem to layer or integrate with one another, so my palate is left confused. This beer does get credit for good looks and for coaxing flavors out of a 6.3% stout that I would normally expect to find only in an 8 or 9 percent RIS, but the flavors here just didn't hookup."
"Overall in a sea of great stouts, this one is forgettable and lacks anything which really warrents me to come back."
"O: Overall this is a very solid stout that has a a great flavor. It does not shy away from boldness and will not leave one disappointed. Only wish is that it had a slightly thicker consistency with greater head."

"overall, avery has some really decent stuff. having that large A as a standard on their labels help to recognize and remember when you've had their products. while the stout isnt one of my favorite styles, it easily meets the other stouts in its taste and i could probably have another one of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid stout offering but not a crowd pleaser. Nothing stands out to really bring me back to this. Glad I tried it but probably won't revisit."
"O- Definitely a stronger ""medium body"" beer. I liked it but there was nothing there that makes me want to buy more. I like Avery and love Ellie's Brown Ale. For me this a solid but not spectacular stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fine moderate ABV, non-barrel aged, non-soured, everyday stout."
""
"O- this one had plenty of taste for the ABV, but it didn't seem to gel quite right, and the tobacco-like smell was a bit if a turn off."
"O - Good beer, kind of unique in how dry and roasty it is, while still maintaining balance. A perennial favorite for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent American stout with hefty roasted character and a good spike of hoppiness. I wish they let the malt character come through which would take a reduction in roasted malt. Decent but not really a go-to beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Personal Rate: 3.75"

"O: Well-rounded, above-average stout. The nose and mouthfeel stood out to me the most. I like this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Average."
"Final Thoughts: I liked this one. At just under $10 for a six-pack it's a fair deal. It's robust beyond it's 6.3% abv. Expect a big roasty profile and some decent bitterness. Would I drink it again? Yes, especially in the colder months."
""
"Overall a pretty good beer. There are plenty of stouts out there, and this one doesn't really ""stand out"" from the rest, but it might be worth a try. Solid, but nothing spectacular."
""
"Overall, I would drink this beer again.. and again. I wouldn't seek it out in warm weather, but would welcome it alongside a warm chili in the cool of the fall or winter."
"This is a solid beer. It's simple but full flavored. The nose caught me off guard but the big, roasty flavor made up for it. I really enjoyed this one. If I come across it again, I'll buy a few more bottles."
"O - Not super spectacular but a very solid classic American stout. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it again but I wouldn't turn it down."
""
""
""
"This brew poured with a barely there tan head that hung around for the duration of the drinking, but left no lacing on the glass. The body was a deep and dark brown. Due to the color, there was no visible carbonation on the brew. The nose was glorious. It had lots of coffee, roasted malts and chocolate, which is exactly what I expect from a stout. The taste was very much of the same that was apparent in the nose. I got a lot of coffee and roasted malts, not as much chocolate, with a creamy mouthfeel. The brew had very low carbonation and the finish lasted awhile with the roasted malts. It also had medium thickness. This was definitely a great brew and I can’t believe it’s taken me so long to try it. I will definitely have this one again."
""
"A solid stout, both for a summer day or these transitional chilly months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer has it all going on. Full bodied & malty with a roasted coffee and chocolate flavor. Light body for super drinkability. I'd have this any day of the week. A+ Avery!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good little American Stout. I wish this was 1% weaker in ABV for the amount of flavor, but still I'd have no problem knocking back a few pints of this."
""
""
""

"O- Great stout. Im really digging the hop character and bitterness in this one."
"O - Overall this is a great stout and I have plans on drinking more of these in the future."

"Hayward Abbey Rating: 81"
""
""
""
"Overall – This is a pretty good stout. It has a very nice flavor profile as well as a very nice aroma. Only thing holding it back is the lack of an lacing (which really can be pardoned) as well as the somewhat too thin of a body. Overall though it is quite nice."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a deep black, with a thin tan head. Big roasted aromas. Coffee, chocolate. Excellent creamy mouthfeel. Smooth, subtle carbonation. Semi-sweet chocolate, roasted coffee beans, cracker dryness. Really a great beer here. One I would happily enjoy time and again."
""
""

"B"
""
""
""
"Strong, smoky aroma has tones of molasses, coffee and caramel plus a hint of licorice. It pours a deep sable with a fine-bubbled and somewhat fluffy light tan head. Flavor has notes of roast coffee and molasses with subtle tones of caramel and licorice, not as well-rounded as the best stouts I have tried but still worthwhile. Smooth texture has firm body but only average fizz. Overall, a decent stout if not outstanding. Give it a try."
"O: Far from the worst stout I've had but also far from the best."
"O - This was a really good stout... actually closer to a porter than a stout (really what's the difference). The roasty aftertaste was my favorite part."
"Not bad at all."

"Pours an opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and some cocoa powder notes. Taste is of dark roasted malt and some coffee and cocoa flavors. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slight crispness but a somewhat light body. Overall, this is a pretty good stout but it smells better than it tastes in my opinion."
""
""
"Dark brown/black color with big head that is retained throughout. There is heavy lacing, and this beer is beautiful to behold. Aroma is big roasted/smoky malt. Flavor matches with initial malty sweetness, strong smoke flavor, and a dose of hops to finish things off."
"Almost two fingers of dark brown foam, highly dimpled surface, looks like someone just whipped it with an egg beater, decent retention given the large amount of larger bubbles, the lacing is not thick but stays present in wide sticky sheets on the glass sides. The liquid is close to black but you come down deciding it’s really just very dark brown, touch of orange at the glass bottom. Loads of roast to the nose, still it’s the green, herbaceous hoppiness which is most evident, this over coffee, cocoa and malted milk ball accents, pronounced floral side too, the burnt qualities make it difficult to discern much fruit, its general dryness makes an impression just smelling it. Full-bodied, close to heavy but more so just dense for the sake of being dense, nothing gained texturally from it. Here the dryness takes some sting out of the roastiness, palate already deadened some. Dark roast coffee beans, cocoa to pine, dried flowers, earth and tar bring big pucker factor. The carbonation does not distinguish itself, however, doesn’t really seem undercarbonated either. OK, a pinch of cherry to red plum fruit. Could give you a little more to love here but no doubting its strong personality."
"A nicely sessionable stout."
""
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, a big roast and almost a sweet oatmeal like. In the taste, dry roast, with notes of coffee. A smooth and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a dry roast and note of pine hops in the aftertaste. A good flavor and nice hop presence in the end, quite nice."
"A good example of the style that manages to get dark fruit qualities without actually adding fruit (like the North Peak porter with cherries in it)."
""
""
"O-- The big black stout is dry with a big roasted barley gives it nice flavor but is a bit to big for a session beer but still tasty."
""
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this beer a lot. For a widely available basic stout it packs a lot of flavor. Nothing incredible just a good solid brew that I will be glad to order again."

"This is a nice, roasty/coffee tasting stout with some hop bitterness. Pleasing and easy to drink."
""
""
"If you're looking for a lighter stout that is flavorful and not too heavy, this would be a really good choice."
"Overall- Completely average...I only bought a single bottle, but if I would have bought a sixer, I would be upset. A pass for me."
"Pours a dark brown cola color with a one finger dark khaki colored head. The head leaves some rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is of roasted malt and a touch of earthy hops. The taste follows suit with a big roasted malt backbone, there is also a slight earth hop bite. That is really about it. The taste is not overly complex. The mouthfeel is lowly carbonated and a bit thin. Overall this is an average stout the mouthfeel is a little thin and the taste leaves a little lacking."
"Pours dark brown/black with an alrioght head. Smell is a little roasty with some earthiness to it. Taste follows suit with some roasted malt, earthy hops, some fruit, and a mild bitterness. Moutfeel kinda felt closer to what I expect from a porter than a stout, some carbonation and medium bodied at its thickest. Overall, not a huge fan of this. Not bad but not really my thing."
"O: Overall the taste and mouthfeel were better than I expected from the scent. It's a good stout."
"Overall, a nice stout. Nothing surprising or unusual, just a tasty beer. Overall rating reflects the fact that I oscillated between 3.5 and 4 for taste."
""
"Not a bad stout, feels nice and the taste is there but I can't put my finger on what is lacking."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the dry finish, and the robust malt activity throughout. The other flavors, however, were a bit subdued, and we would have liked to see a thicker feel to back up the stronger flavoring. This is a nice beer, but it isn’t ideal, as the flavoring is not rounded out as nicely, and as strongly, as one might hope."

"Another Avery revisiting, this time going even darker. It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of deep ecru foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, light char (really more of a darkly-toasted bread kinda thing), dark chocolate powder, and a pinch of black pepper for good measure. The taste pretty much follows the same pattern, though everything is darker, roastier, toastier, more charred, and, subsequently, bitterer. (Aside: A reviewer before me mentioned something about chicory. ... In retrospect, I think that's indeed something that came through, just surreptitiously, without making itself known very well.) The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a pretty solid stout, but it's a bit too roasty for my tastes, especially in something like this, which, to me, is meant to be more of an everyday stout (if that makes sense...)."

"yum! pours a dead sexy black color into a stout glass with a one and a half inch tan head. smells like dark roasted barley and faint coffee. taste is really roasted and a little smokey, chicory root and licorice notes on the tongue too. great bitter finish smooth smooth smooth. i wouldnt call this a dry irish stout, as its not really dry at all, and the malt profile is much different. mouthfeel is perfect, creamy and expanding, down easy. i could drink a sixer of these no problem. sturdy abv caps it off, great beer from avery! my favorite stout this season"
""
"Surprising find."
""
"Dr: Quite drinkable, but not without its flaws. I'd try it on nitro, but elsewise it isn't captivating enough to invest in again."
"D - Not a bad stout overall. Actually sessionable, but not a great one by any means."
""
""
"I don't know what bounds this beer is supposed to be out of, but it operates well within the bounds of any reasonable stout I've ever had. Despite adjectives on the label such as ""big"" and ""extreme," and despite the ""tons of roasted malts"" and the ""mountains of hops"" used to make this beer, I detected a polite, well-mannered, friendly little stout that was reasonably roasty with an edge of bitter coffee and some dull chocolate on the side. The body was a bit thin, and the finish a tad sweet but overall it wasn't bad. It certainly wasn't up to the threats on the label. Leave the chest thumping to the idiots at Stone."

"O - It is alot like a guinness, but better. Well done!"
"Avery Out of Bounds Stout: I have not tried many Avery products, so this was a good introduction. Stouts tend to be pretty similar in appearance, and this is the case with the Avery’s black body and tan head. The head is ample and lasts for the duration with good lacing. The aroma is more pronounced than other stouts I have tried, with big coffee and molasses notes. These are prominent in the flavor. The Avery starts out with a big coffee taste, then moves to a dryer smoky finish. Overall this stout is a smooth drinking experience. There is a subtle bitter undertone, but it never comes to the surface like some stouts that can be a rough experience. The Out of Bounds Stout was a good find and is high on my list of American style stouts, primarily because big flavor comes thorough but remains a smooth drinking experience."
""
"Overall- Good beer, would most certainly have it again, especially if I wanted a good, down to earth, drinkable stout. Certainly worthwhile while not being over the top crazy. Pick this one up."
""
"1/2 cm tan head off a pretty vigorous pour. Head diminished but laced slightly. Pitch black with only a slight red highlight. Smells super nutty sweet mocha chocolate (like one of those peanut butter cookies with the chocolate kiss on top). Tastes just as good (again one of those cookies comes to mind, but this time washed down with some roasty coffee). Sweetness hangs on almost to the end but at the last minute it quickly turns to the proper dryness for the style. A nice chewy mouthfeel without being overly heavy. I was getting pretty tired of stouts in general because some offering seem a bit watery while others can be chokingly heavy. This perfect body and balance between sweet and dry of this offering has changed my mind."

"Poured on draft into 4 oz. sampler. Pours a jet black with a Guinness like head. Head leaves. Copious amounts of lacing left behind. The nose is very subtle and muted, but roasty. The beer has a very nondescript taste. Some acrid coffee, and an abundance of roasted malt. The mouthfeel is thick with moderate carbonation. Overall, a decent but unspectacular brew."
"Pours a black color, with a nice one finger cocoa head. Nice lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is coffee, chocolate, hops, and malt. Not bad, but a little heavy on the coffee. Taste is OK, but again, heavy on the coffee. Feel is dry, and full bodied. Overall, an slightly better than average Irish Dry Stout. Cheers."
"overall- a good balanced base flavor, sweet, excellent carbonation, hops are present as compliment but don't mess up the rich, sweeter flavor, an above average stout in my opinion"

"The alcohol wasn't discernible in this since the nut flavors were present, but not spicy. In other words, the hazelnut and almond fit in nicely with the profile of this beer. I wouldn't have one of these that often but when it came time for a good example of this style, I wouldn't have to look any further either!"
"Not especially complex, but a unique, dry stout."
""
"Overall: Blows away the competition. No need to ever have the import biggies with this around. This is NOT watered down roasted malt beer. This is great stuff."

"O: It was weird I felt like this beer was better on the colder side, when it warmed it seemed to become less smooth which is usually the opposite case. I was surprised by this beer, I was thinking it was going to be much lighter and less rich but its very strong and powerful for the style."

"Overall, I think this is a beer definitely worth trying. It’s Avery though, they can’t really do much wrong. Such a solid brewery. The fact that it’s not too heavy makes it very drinkable and makes me wish I picked up more than one for my evening."
"O: Good stout, I prefer thicker stouts so this is definitely a favorite for an irish stout for me. Pretty simple, tasty and drinkable."
"Overall, a well done American Stout. AT 6.3% it's very sessionable, and it tastes good along the way. Well done by Avery."
"Overall this ISA great beer. Please put me in the fan category"
"Overall a descent beer that's full of flavor and aroma at just over 6%. I wouldn't say it's a stand out for the style but it's certinly worthy and one I revist at times. It's a good example to switch too when following up from an overly sweet beer."
"Overall, this big dry stout makes for a nice quaff on a cool fall evening. Despite what the name suggests, there's nothing ""out of bounds"" here, just well-integrated flavours and aromas with a little heat from the higher-than-usual ABV. Worth trying."
"This doesn’t have the accoutrements of oatmeal, coffee, barrel aged, or any of that, but it doesn’t need it. A stout done right, this is one to find."
"O: In the end, Out of Bounds Stout is one of Avery's better regular offerings. If you've had Irish dry stouts before, then this one will probably not dazzle you, though it is a solid example of the style."
"Creamy...very, very easy to drink! Only got a sample, but I certainly could have had a full pint of this. Unfortunately when you are sampling 18 or so brews, pints aren't always in order."
"This stout poured out as a deep brown color with a tan colored head on top that bubbled away pretty quickly. The lacing was very light and had minimal retention. The smell of the beer is a little toasted with some chocolate aromas in there too, but they are very faint. The taste of the beer was decent, a little on the light side I thought for a stout but it didn't have a decent dry roasted flavor to it. The mouthfeel wasn'ttoo bad, it's a little watery, but it's supposed to be that way I think. Overall this stout isn't too bad but I've had better."
"Overall, this should be on everyone's short list, at least in Colorado, when a Stout is in order."
"O: This is a solid stout. It is my first of this offering from Avery. While it is not a very quick drinker, it remains pleasant and easy to drink until the end and the thought of having another was strong. It did feel a bit too watery at times for the style. Overall, a very solid stout."
"Excellent beer to have by itself"
"Overall, this is a solid stout, the flavor is good, but it's nothing outstanding for the style. Maybe I just don't like the style, but it's not an alarmingly great beer."
"O- An enjoyable stout. I would get again if not for enjoying at a bonfire on a cool night, at least to give to a fan of darker beers as a somewhat ""sessionable"" stout. The dryness keeps it from getting too cloying. Out of Bounds Stout followed by an Avery IPA, a great 1-2 punch."
"Overall, I would easily recommend this stout to all interested in trying a full flavored brew. Avery hit a home run with Out of Bounds!!!"
"Overall - a very interesting stout with plenty of flavor and hoppiness. Slightly off-balance but its very well made and flavorful. Enjoy!"
"A recommended drink."
"Creamy nice smooth body. A little sweeter than your average Irish Dry. Not a bad beer, but more of a coffee stout than a true irish dry in my opinion which is not a bad thing just not what I was looking for in this beer."
"A nice stout, with the bitterness of a RIS and not an Irish stout. I would definitely try this one again."
"Poured a brown-black, with a small, tannish head. Roasty aroma, dark malts, and coffee notes. Similar taste, as expected: dark malts, roasted coffee, a little cocoa, a little smoke. Left a slightly bitter aftertaste. Heavy-medium body, and quite drinkable."
"O: This was a very true to style Irish dry stout. I thought it was quite good for the style and I liked the subtle sweetness for this guy."
"Roots"
"Stouts recently have taken a back seat to their bigger Imperial brothers, but this one was good enough to rekindle my interest. I wanted another one when I was finished. Good job Avery."
"There's stouts in the imperial section that are deceptively subtle. This is the first normal (non-imperial) stout I've had that does the opposite somehow: this tastes like it's double the strength it says on the bottle. Nice..."
"Overall - Soild and very easy to drink. Better then most american stouts. Really could use more creamy flavor and sweetness, this one is a little to plain, but overall decent to drink and enjoy."
"Mouthfeel: Surprisingly crisp for a stout. Good carbonation and coating. My favorite feature of this beer."
"This is a good beer. One of the best stouts I've had in a long time. Reminds me of Guiness Extra stout, except a tinge sweeter and more winey notes."
"o - Overall a really nice Irish dry stout, reminds me of Guiness in every aspect. Would have it again."
"Overall: Decent stout not something I would seek out but for the right price I would drink it again"
"Out of Bounds Stout is a good overall beer, not as stout as a true stout, but good nonetheless. It’s like the first girlfriend you ever had; could have been better, but it’ll do for now. It’ll do just fine."
"Taste is slow-rolling and complex. I get burnt malts, and an almost woody quality. Some chocolate, but leaning more heavily on the charred side. A very tasty and delicious stout."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Roasted malt and dark chocolate bitterness with a light amount of perhaps milk chocolate sweetness mid palate, some toffee, and finishes decidedly dry and bitter. Well brewed to the style and quite enjoyable. I think I'll have another..."
"O: A very drinkable stout. No flavors jump out and wow you, but it's good for a hot summer day, if ever there was such a stout."
"GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"A decent beer, but not one of my all-time favorites."
"Overall impression: A superior alternative to the 'big 3' of the style."
"Overall: A solid version of a lighter stout."
"From Notes...Tried the Out of Bounds Stout....I love friends that bring over great brews that are difficult to get...Home Brew....I mean you!!! The color was obviously dark with a creamy head. The smell was malty with grain and oatmeal. The was realy quite nice...hints of malt and caramel balanced well with a hints of espresso. The mouthfeel was good, came off the pallete clean. Some bitterness, but a decent tasting stout."
"A solid offering from Avery. Nothing to jump up and down over, but good enough for the girls I go with."
"On tap, pours a dark brown with a mocha head and a fair amount of lace work. Aroma is light, roasted malts and dry cocoa. In the flavor, roasted malt, coffee, aniseed, fennel. A little herbaceous but with a nice firm maltyness. A well balanced stout, full bodied feel and over all it's quite sessionable."
"Overall it was ok, nothing really great. Maybe it was me but it just falls in line with a bunch of other average stouts."
"Very happy overall, I bought it in a mix and match, I can see myself getting a 6 pack of this."
"Overall the perfect stout for anytime of year."
"Overall I am happy to have purchased this. If I trate this one or drink it?.."
"O - This is a pretty good beer, but not amazing. Tastes more like a foreign export stout rather than a irish dry stout."
"Anyway, great beer and available at a great price. I'm glad that a brewery like Avery that does some extreme stuff also makes traditional beer as well."
"O- I will say the roast subdued a little as it sat and got warmer. But this thing was very unbalanced. Obviously a stout should have a roasty character (most likely in the forefront) but this was just too much to handle."
"O - a bold stout, both in its use of more roasted barley and in the ramped up hopping. Well done!."
"I'd love to get another six pack of this guy for the house. It's a go to beer for me. Very pleasant in all aspects and cheap for the quality."
"Although BA classifies this as a Dry Irish Stout, this definitely falls outside of that category-more like an American Stout with the high hop rates. The aroma is great, and the flavor is strong and in your face-I just am not sure that I love the extremely high hop flavors and the fact that they overtake the malt in the finish. Good, but definitely not my favorite. I will say though, that some foods blunt the hop attack a little bit (I'm enjoying it with Rosemary, Chili, Orange, and Maple glazed nuts), which makes for a rather pleasant gustatory experience."
"Servicable for a stout, carbonation and body are decent. Intense dark flavor, that lingers on forever. Hides it alcohol well though."
"D - Good drinkability here. This is definitely one of the better Irish Dry Stouts that I've had. It has a really good flavor to it. I would have no problem drinking a few of these in a sitting. I recommend giving this one a shot."
"D- Off the charts, a well put together ID, I'll put this one in the rotation for the future."
"Drinkability: I like it a lot, a well balanced beer!"
"Very easy drinking. A little more alcohol than the Irish imports, but a better beer."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Quite addictive to drink. The taste is slightly bitter for a stout. The dark fruits become more prominent as you continue to drink. While quite addictive, definitely not my favorite stout. Different in coffee robustness than most other stouts."
"D: This beer goes down effortlessly; I could easily have several of these in one night because it's hardly at all filling. No traces of the alcohol are perceptible."
"Overall a very nice stout. I'd gladly drink again."
"slight hazelnut note... kinda like a Columbus Nut Brown Stout if there were such a thing.... uh oh... time for a mixer:)"
"This is a very drinkable stout that has a great roasty character. Perhaps not terribly sessionable, but if you want a nice roasty stout that you can drink a couple of, this might just be what you are looking for."
"This was all around a solid beer but wasn't mind blowing by any means. Goes down smooth and was an easy drink. If you're a fan of the style, it's a good one to try."
"D - pretty solid stout. Not the most complex beer out there, but what is there is delicious. I would definitely drink it again."
"D: Doesn't do much for me. Its not bad, but its not good either."
"Out of Bounds Stout is going to be very versatile when it comes to food pairings. Try it with your favorite braised or other slow cooked meats. Last night I enjoyed mine with some Osso Bucco and they complimented each other very nicely. Especially this time of year, a great cheese pairing for this Stout would be Hoch Ybrig, a raw cow's milk cheese from the mountains of Switzerland that is washed in a white wine brine. This cheese has a strong, full flavor from the wash that will stand up well to the strength of the Stout. This is also a fondue cheese, and your Out of Bounds would go great with fondue!"
"The malts seem over roasted and the bitterness does not blend well. The flavor reminded me of charcoal water. Kind of harsh but I would drink another one."
"Pours a black hue with a tan head in my beer mug. It has nice retention with very good lacing that clings nicely to the glass. The aroma is a pleasing choclolate and coffee smell that is pleasing to the nose. The taste is chocolate followed by some coffee with a hint of hops and some malts trying to come out, and that is followed by some licorice and raisins. The slight bitter aftertaste is a dark chocolate with some alcohol and as the beer warms can feel the alcohol in my throat when drinking this beer. The mouthfeel is a nice creamy feel that melts on the lips and tongue and the medium body makes it a good drinkable beer. This is overall a good beer just as my ratings in all five categories say it is. A must try for all stout lovers."
"Poured a very dark brown not quite black with a bit of a reddish halo, nice creamy two fingered tan head that left alot of sticky lacing. Aromas were slight at best with a smokey malt up front. On the palate a robusto burnt coffee and bitter sweet chocolate. Full bodied with a fair amount of carbonation to dance gracefully across the taste buds."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Overall well balanced and quite enjoyable. Half way through the experience the 6% alcohol is noticed with a bit of warmth to the back of the throat. This is a decent brew and fairly drinkable that I wouldn't mind sitting down and having a few of."
"Drinkability -is good. Doesn't ruin taste buds. Sessionable."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not sure that I've had this style before, so I can't say whether this is true to style or not. But if it is, this probably isn't my favorite style."
"Overall I think this is a nice surprise for me. Not my everyday or even every week drinker but a strong well rounded beer. I think the mixture of the malts and hops is very well done and smooth with just enough bitter at the end for a little bite. Great beer Avery Brewing!!"
"Moderator can feel free to remove this review if s/he likes after the mis-info is corrected...."
"D - I really like this stout. A straightforward dark tasting stout. It does not have any crazy flavors, just the basics and done very well. Very drinkable all night long."
"Overall: This, along with North Coast's Old #38 Stout, are two of my favorite dry stouts. They are exactly what they SHOULD be."
"A good hearty Irish Stout."
"D- a fine example of the style. i like that this is a stout with plenty of flavor with a somewhat moderate ABV. i feel this one is under appreciated by most."
"D - A very nice dry stout and I liked it and would appreciate it in my glass. Very good beer."
"Drinkability, Pretty good. The basic flavor balance is on the money. The money,in this case,is reasonable. In no way ""hard to finish"" and not boozy. Good wide temp range,making for a nice Year Round."
"Drinkability: The aroma is probably my favorite part of this beer, it really got me excited to taste it. The intensity and profile of the roasted and smokey flavors was a little more than what I normally prefer, but still a good stout overall."
"Wow! What an exceptional example of an Irish Dry Stout. Seems like it would almost be better suited for the American stout style due to the smooth texture and sweet, balanced flavors. Great session beer for stout lovers like myself. Incredibly complex and rich flavors and outstandingly refreshing."
"There is not a whole lot to say about the appearance on this beer. It's dark? It's closer to black instead of a dark brown and there is little to no head. Wow! It makes up for the dull appearance in the nose. A great coffee smell and some bitter chocolate. There is a little bit of an unpleasant burnt grain smell. The bitterness is the first thing I notice. The chocolate and coffee flavors don't show up until the finish. After all the flavor there is some alcohol heat. It is a well balanced stout and easy to drink. It would be a great food stout to enjoy with a big steak or even some bitter chocolates after dinner."
"D: As the beer warmed up, it got a little astringent and quite bitter. Still, a pretty decent stout that I found easy enough to drink."
"Overall, an enjoyable stout. There are few things that really strike me as exceptional, such as the usage of hops, but again nothing is out of place and it all works."
"D- This is a bad tasting beer. I'm sure it has to be a bottle. I drain poured this after I drank about half the pint. I will re-review this one when I get a chance to get another bottle. This one was bad though...very bad."
"I'd like to get a fresh one of these as I bet I'd bump it up a couple of points."
"This is certainly different than the Dry Stout that the Out of Bounds that I've tried in the past was. This one is drinking much more like a bigger American Stout. Intense flavors through and through with the coarse herbal hops almost competing with the roasted barley. It appears Avery really has stepped this beer up. Not a surprise when you know Avery's brewing philosophy."
"I've had a lot of crazy only-in-America inventiveness from other Avery brews, but this one seems like a straight-up imitation of the classic Irish style. (actually, it reminds me of Moylan's Dragoons most of all, which is from California.) which is a good thing."
"I poured into a pint glass to one finger of tan head. This beer is dark brown in color. The aroma is nutty with fresh ground coffee. I also get some chocolate. The taste is primarily coffee. It is not a bitter coffee taste. The mouthfeel is creamy. This beer is a pleasant surprise."
"Upon opening the envelope and seeing it was Avery's dry stout, I definitely think this one made it as a member of the ever-blurring stout/porter borderline (see: Founder's Porter, which is probably more of a stout than this is, and vice-versa). Enjoyable!"
"Too long between reviews, but had a chance to get this on my trip to MN. Poured into a pint glass this brew is a nice chocolate brown color with a thick 2 finger tan head leaving decent lacing as the brew settles. The aroma is thick of chocolate, coffee, caramel, and slight burnt malt. There is a yeast affect to the initial sip followed by a strong coffee and milk chocolate sweetness. This brew is medium body with slight bitterness in the finish for good balance. The warmer the more aroma and flavor you get. Nice stout and I am glad I purchased."
"D - Moderate to high. On a cold night, I could drink 5-6..."
"Taste-Black coffee and semi-sweet baking chocolate. Subtle hop notes. Dry, black coffee finish. Overall, a nice version of the style."
"D- A very tasty stout that is well made and memorable. Worth trying."
"Taste is slightly burnt cocoa with a fair amount of sweetness and roasted bitterness lingering long into the finish with some grassy support from the hops. By the look and smell, I was sure this was the perfect stout, but alas it was not quite meant to be with this one. Still tasty though, as it is a multi-faceted malt forward stout with some definite hoppy complexities added in. I think this brew fits better as an American stout than an Irish Dry. Never gets boring, even as the glass approaches empty status. I would happily purchase a sixer of this at least once a year. Strangely enough, this is one of the few Avery beers that is not available in Tx."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, with hints of red and a creamy tan head. Aromas of coffee, Hershey's chocolate syrup and a little dark brown sugar. Pretty similar on the palate, with a little bit of hops backing up the familiar stout flavors. Another good Avery offering."
"Overall: Overall the beer was very good. If you like a nice stout with a hint of hops, you will really enjoy this one. I'd recommend this beer to any dark beer drinker."
"D - Easy to drink, but not something I'd likely buy more of. I look for more of an experience when drinking my beer. This came and went, and I won't likely look back."
"D - it is tasty but boring. You could easily drink a lot of this, but you would probably opt for something more with more flavor."
"Overall fantastic. I really need to revisit this beer in the form of a six pack."
"D: Very drinkable. Smooth and pleasing. A bit filling."
"Notes: Nice surprise from the small regular bottles of Avery. Maybe nothing remarkable but rather reliable."
"Drinkability: The taste is subtle so palate fatigue is definitely not an issue. This beer is pretty sessionable and I can definitely see myself throwing back a bunch of these."
"Beer poured black with ruby undertones. Tan head was very large on pour, leaving lacing behind. Nose is hints of coffee, mocha, hops. Taste is coffee, mocha, with a nice dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and very smooth. Drinkability is quite good at the abv level and with all the good flavors going on. Nice effort, I am quite impressed!"
"Fantastic price."
"Could definitely throw a few of these back and not get too far ahead of yourself."
"D- Easily drinkable. One of the better Irish Stouts I've had. A solid 4.0 beer."
"D - Easy drinking for a dry stout. ABV is manageable. Flavors do begin to wear after a while as the roasted notes almost turn to ash."
"D - Did I just find my new favorite low abv session stout?"
"Overall Impression: A pretty solid beer all around. I thought it was just a touch too sweet for a Dry Stout, but was still enjoyable."
"D - Drinkable though they could get old. I would probably session with these though. Would buy this again - a great stout."
"The beer is light to medium bodied, well carbonated and the alcohol is not present at all. The finish is nice and dry, and this is a beer that I wouldn't mind having a six pack of, but but I wouldn't finish them all at once, it would linger in the back of the fridge."
"Carbonation is light, with a smooth creamy mouthfeel; this beer goes down easy considering the full body and heavy smoke taste that eventually gives way to nice flavor of malts and some fruits. It's like a very tasty light stout, with a nice dry burnt finish. A nice beer that I would certainly have again."
"D: Not a bad beer overall. I have drank a couple of these at once! I'd probally buy it again."
"Flavor follows the malt profile of the aroma with coffee and a dry char on the finish that offers a flash of dark fruit and then a return to the bitter dryness. Rather thin on the feel for the style, lacking the creaminess I'm accustomed to. Decent drinkability but a bit too burnt in flavor for me."
"D -- Approachable, solid...a good beer, worthy of any drinker to try."
"Not my cup of tea. I've had better stouts and will probably stick with them. Of course I wasn't expecting something chewy like an imperial stout, but I was expecting a little more body and flavor than the one-note flavor I was experiencing here."
"D- This is a great session stout beer, rich but not heavy. Great flavor but not too boozy. I'll call it a winter session stout."
"Medium body, very creamy and smooth. Very, very drinkable Irish Dry Stout. Definitely one of the best I've had."
"D- Quite drinkable; the mouthfeel complements the sweetness of the brew. Overall, a very enjoyable stout."
"D: The bitter dryness makes this one not so easy to put back. One is very drinkable, two becomes a tad too much. Great flavor makes it very drinkable though."
"D: Already on my second, it's a very well balanced stout. Nothing in it is too overpowering, yet it is still very flavorful."
"D - Awesomely drinkable for a stout! The mouthfeel is nice and smooth and the flavor is right on-par. I could go for a 6 pack of this in my fridge!"
"This beer was exactly what I was hoping it would be. The best of great stout aroma and flavor (which i think comes from the stronger stouts) without the high alcohol. A perfect cold weather afternoon or session beer. Great dark color, very roasty aroma and flavor. As good as any imperial I've ever had."
"Very good stout."
"There's no lack in body or feel. The nice full body was creamy and had the right amount of bite from the carbonation. The hops added more by pinching the cheeks, and the finish was long and dry. Drinkability is good, short frequent sips drained it pretty quick."
"A nice solid dry stout."
"O - The bitterness and roast character is big enough to lend a dry finish to a big, chewy stout. A good example of an American Stout, but perhaps this sample is a little old. I would expect a bigger (maybe fresher) malt aroma; the hops are there but indistinguishable. The grain bill is heavy on the roast -- right where it should be. Overall a tasty beer I will buy again."
"very nice stout!"
"Darker and thicker than cola out of the bottle. Thick dark brown in the glass with a one finger dark tan head the dissipates rapidly. Smell is darkly roasted malt. A bit of coffee and cocoa in the taste, but mostly toasted malt--a touch of vanilla in the finish, which is nice. Goes very nicely with an apple tart (or two)."
"The feel of this beer has a nice medium feel and is pretty easy drinking for a stout. there is some nice aftertaste and is still a pleasant beer."
"Bottle courtesy of HogtownHarry. Thanks! Pours dark, dark brown with a frothy head of mocha foam. Nice lace left behind. The nose is or roasty malts and coffee beans, mint, and fresh cut grass with loads of hops and dark chocolate, with hints of vanilla extract. Tastes very green for a stout, with loads of minty hops and freshly brewed black coffee, leading to a woody dark chocolate and vanilla. Finishes quite bitter and creamy ,with aftertastes of dark rum. This looked and tasted like an impy, but is only 5.1%, wow. Excellent. Thanks a lot for this gem Harry!"
"D-pretty full flavored for being so low in alcohol, I could enjoy this beer."
"Not as crisp as I expected but overall pretty tasty. Props on the bottle label."
"Poured this into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. One of the best looking beers of this style I've seen in quite some time. Close to black in color until held up to the light it's clearly a dark brown. It has an insanely frothy head to it with tons of different sized bubbles that is tan in color. This beer produces a hearty amount of lacing. It is around the entire glass and on a funny note there is a portion of it that actually looks like a world map on my glass, I'm sure the bulb portion helps with it, but it is a very good looking beer. The smell is pretty decent, smells to me mostly of semisweet chocolate as opposed to the more common bittersweet chocolate. The smell follows with some coffee and some what smells of a pine dry hop, where the bitterness comes in. The taste is good, but it has an earthy aftertaste that isn't too pleasant. However, the initial taste is good. It starts off with the malts, and they are pretty heavy. Coffee and bittersweet chocolate now. Then it's followed by the hops. So you get the hop teamed up with that previously mentioned earthy taste. I had to ponder for a minute on how I would rate the mouthfeel. I'm generally not a huge fan of the mouthfeel of the Irish Dry stout except for on certain days, however I found this to be better than most I've tried. It seemed much lighter bodied than most Irish Dry stouts, but it still manages to leave that classic dry feeling in your mouth. It's as if they achieved the same results but went a different route. With all that's going on here, it's still a pretty drinkable beer."
"Overall, nothing earth shattering, but a really solid stout at a reasonable price. My first tasting from Avery's offerings!"
"Drink ability is pretty good. Extremely sessionable beer. Pretty light bodied but tons of flavor is packed into it. This is pretty similar to Odells Cutthroat Porter so if you like that one you're gonna love this beer"
"D) A well crafted stout. I'd have another."
"The mouthfeel in this beer and the high hopping had me thinking this was a much ""bigger"" beer than it is, the smell and taste are a shared spotlight between hops and roasted barley, not really an ""irish"" thing to add flavor and aroma hops, is it? this is a good american stout with a very nice mouthfeel. Drinkability is good as well, another good brew from Avery."
"Surprised to see how high I rated this brew in comparison to other BA's. I found this to be a tasty stout with a great drinkability level."
"Pours a very dark black that is almost completely opaque. Little head or lacing. The smell is roasted malt combined with a slight nuttiness and hints of coffee. Taste is similar with a little bit of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is too thin. Not terribly drinkable, as there isn't much complexity and it's a little thin for me."
"A good, solid, traditional stout from a brewery that (I thought) could only produce beer for hopheads. I stand corrected."
"Notes: This is a pretty decent stout if I do say so myself. It's got little patches of rough spots here and there, but it offers enough flavors to keep me interested over the course of a session. I don't know why I doubted the crew at Avery, but I just didn't expect much from this brew. I'm glad to say that I was wrong, and pleasantly surprised to say that I would drink this stout again."
"Pours a pitch black color with a one finger tan head that leaves medium-thick lacing down my pint glass. Looks almost like a better version of Coca-Cola. Smell is faint, get some dark roasted malts, roasty flavors in general and a almost hoppy citrus smell, mostly just roasted malts though, nothing overly great here. Taste is good, tastes again of mostly roasted malts, with a good hop and citrus balance, definitely some oatmel sweetness in here too, a good solid stout taste. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout here, a little watery but still almost medium, a strange citrusy malt taste is left on the tongue from this one, different than any stout I have had. Drinkablity is decent here, not too thick, no alcohol or bad tastes, might get filling after a while though, and I personally would get sick of the aftertaste."
"The beer has a medium body, a bit watered down for a stout, creamy and fairly drinkable, not with standing the dry bitter aftertaste. A good Irish Dry Stout, but certainly not my favorite."
"D- Pretty drinkable. Tasty, although not my favorite stout."
"this was a pretty darn drinkable beer. could have had a few more if we were sticking around."
"Simple flavor, unobtrusive enough to put away a pint without really thinking about it. As a Guinness competitor, competent enough. Not really a shining example of an Irish dry stout, though."
"I practically grew up drinking Guinness Extra, although it's been a while since I had one, so this beer felt somewhat familiar and comfortable. The first taste impression is of the bitter chocolate malts, swirling around the palate there is a slight volatile, yet pleasant, taste like a ripe cheese. The finish is full, bitter and earthy as expected from a dry stout."
"[CU-stouts-6xr; tap]"
"As the name states, this beer indeed a little out of bounds in the dry stout style. Much hoppier than the Irish counterparts. Certainly worth a purchase."
"This has to be one of the better sessionable regular ol' stouts I've ever had. Huge flavor, great mouthfeel, overall terrific. You cant go wrong with this beer. Highly recommend."
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a small light tan head. Aroma of rich roasted malt and some burnt/charred notes. Flavor is also quite roasted and burnt with some bitter chocolate and light nutty notes. A sturdy palate. I enjoyed this in my beer geek infancy about a year ago and I still enjoy it today!"
"drinkability - this is one of my favorite lighter stouts to put away any time of year"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel, but a bit bitter for me as a session brew. A little pricey as well, but overall a really decent brew."
"Very well done example of the style. Not too bitter or roasty but not too sweet either. Dig it!"
"Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into my nonic Imperial pint glass. This stout appears a deep dark nearly black color with about two fingers of dense creamy, lingering foam. Aromas and flavors of rich roasted grains, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, caramel, coffee/mocha, and a touch of smokiness. Medium to moderate body and adequately carbonated for the style. Nice and flavorful and quite drinkable."
"Notes: Nice effort from Avery which in my experience can be hit and miss."
"Pours a deep black with a gorgeous brown head. Smell is roasted malts, caramel, chocolate, bread and coffee. Tastes a little smoky actually, chocolatey and roasty. Mouthfeel is great for a stout this size, definitely not too light. Drinkability it great."
"Pours a satiny black with a little over one finger or deep tan head. Has nice head retention with a thick sheet of lace and a layer left on top. Has a rich aroma filled with roasted coffee beans, roasted malts, caramel malts and dried prunes. Taste is satisfying and robust with extra-dark chocolates, charred wood, pine, dark coffee and subtle hops at the end. Has a medium body, and not as thick as could be, but there's a decent amount of taste to keep it going."
"The real problem with this beer is the price. I could have the Victory Storm King Stout for a few bucks more (DAMN!), or had the still superior by a wide margin Stockyard Oatmeal Stout for about half as much."
"Future outlook: Interesting beer that was surely worth trying, but ultimately didn't fully work for me. I am glad to have tried, but don't see much need to want to try it again."
"the drinkability is good, as i said, pretty dry and as a result refreshing, like many irish stouts. a little more chocolatey though."
"D- A nice stout."
"This beer pours a deep brown, light passes through, ruby highlights to it. The head pours a one finger rocky head, decent retention, leaves sheets of lacing behind on the glass. Nose is a of nice coffee notes, chocolate and of roasted malts. Taste is more predominantly of roasted malts with coffee as a nice mix in though lighter in the taste than it was in the nose. Bitter chocolate and hops finish this beer. Mouthfeel is medium body and slightly chewy, with a sweet/bitter aftertaste. This beer has nice drinkability."
"D: A nice little stout. I rather liked the simplicity off it, as it goes down very easy. I found it to be a very nice session beer to share with friends."
"D - I'd say it's average drinkablity. Nothing really wows you though."
"M/D: The brew is light on the tongue with a decent amount of carbonation and sweetness. The drinkability is smooth, easy and desirable to the stout drinker."
"-Dotson"
"Pours an extremely dark mahogany with tons of cascading action where its big tan head forms at the top. Head is exceptionally frumpy and long lasting. Smells of expresso and coal. Taste is very sweet, surprisingly so. Flavors are big on the burnt toffee, and strong roastiness. Body is not as full as I would like, but this is one heck of a tasty beer."
"Overall, I really liked this beer. It's a very good American stout."
"12 oz bottle @ Hamilton's. Poured black with borwn edges, lots of creamy tan foam, nice lacing, even in the snifter. Roasted, nearly burnt malt nose, Quik-like cocoa powder, coffee and cream. Creamy mouthfeel, but a bit loose at times. Once this one warmed up a bit, the flavor really popped. Milk chocolate with a touch of Baker's, much smoother than expected coffee flavor, with a generous helping of cream. I thought this was a milk stout before coming ont his site. Slightly bitter hop finish with a charcoal/smoke/roast character. Very nice."
"Nose is charred malts, sweet sugar plums, coal, and chocolate cake. Taste is bitter burnt malts, acidic chocolate powder, and lingering smoky malts. Distinct lack of sweetness. Mouthfeel is average."
"D: Good. Tasty and easy to drink."
"The taste is a little disappointing. There is an overpowering charcoal and pitch taste to the beer that subsumes everything else going on. The roasted and nutty notes, the other qualities, including some hop presence is just overpowered. This isn't the most well balanced beer. If you like charcoal, charred roasted grain, pitch and tar, this one will do. As an Irish Dry Stout, I'll go for a Guinness or Murphy's or Beamish anyday over this one. The aftertaste is slightly oily but the burnt wood notes just linger way too long."
"Overall: I found this to be an interesting stout but it could be a little over-hopped (I can't believe I just wrote that) but it's still full of good stout flavor."
"D-A very drinkable brew exhibiting many of the characteristics of the style. Pour me another one."
"D - This was an average stout...it didn't blow my socks off...and I didn't hate it"
"But like I said before, this is a good beer. I just don't think that some breweries think long enough about how the general market might interpret their labels."
"D: A nice stout from Avery, better than middle of the road. I could pick this up again and enjoy a couple pints."
"Solid black pour with a light brown head. Strong roasted malt and coffee aromas. Flavors are also of roasted malt and other grain. A somewhat creamy mouthfeel, peaty, just a faint hint of dark chocolate. Finishes a with a very crips coffee bitterness. Lingers quite a while. Aftertaste makes you believe you literally drank a stiff black coffee. Becomes a bit overly bitter if it warms too much. A good version of the style and very sessionable, just dont let it sit too long."
"below average drinkability."
"Drinkability is really high. This is a very nice Stout. Really tasty, but very light in the ABV, and quite sessionable."
"Taste: Definitely a dry stout. Fairly sharp and piquant. Generous amount of hops, that combined with the roasted grains, leave a distinct bitterness on the palate. Mouth feel is fairly light, but in consideration of the style, not inappropriate. I'm not blown away by this beer, but I also can't find any huge faults with it. A solid example of a dry stout."
"D- a good stout, i'd get it again.. not amazing.. but very good."
"This is beer is well balanced and easy to drink. Very flavorful for a 5 percent'er."
"Recommended for those who like their brews extra roasty, otherwise stay away. This one's not for me."
"Drinkability- One is enough."
"A nice, mellow brew that serves its purpose, not really exceptional but definitely drinkable."
"Not bad I guess. PRetty thick and chewy on the mouthfeel redeems this one from normalcy. Glad to have it but would not seek this one out."
"Pours pretty solid black that lightens up to a slight ruby/purple as my glass gets thinner at the bottom. Good lacing developin on the sides but the tan head disappeared quickly. I poured it and set it down about 2 feet from my face but could still smell it from that distance. Smells very strongly of roasted barley.. more intense than some other Irish stouts and a little more of a raisin character to it and trails chocolate aroma. Actually very nice and I think it's underappreciated in some of the reviews. Just a little more chocolate aroma in there and it would remind me of Rogue's chocolate stout. Taste is a lot thinner than the aroma and wouldn't live up to anyone's expectations if they were looking for something super alcoholic and extreme. Lots of coffee flavors and pretty moderate bitterness with good hop flavor. On top of the roasted malt flavor there is a bit of a fruity sweetness. Kind of standard. I can see why the extreme versions of stouts get higher reviews since I'm having a hard time thinking of what they can do better here. I'd probably like to see more of a creamy/grassy beer where the flavor isn't so obviously just from X amount of roasted barley on top of a base grain. This is what you find in Guiness, IMO. Still, not bad. The coffee flavor is probably the best part of it, but it lacks the complexity needed to be unique and outstanding."
"Overall: A very good stout but not great."
" ~ I'm not sure where to put the Out Of Bounds Stout. I do think its still in play but I'm putting it in as a role player as opposed to a great scorer."
"Slower drinking though not an overly complex flavor, but I'd do it again. Definitely a nice cold weather brew."
"D: ok drinkability."
"Only have one bottle of these to judge from, but it was a good one and I will likely buy this beer again. It is a refreshing change from many of the other stouts I've had lately that have all seemed the same."
"Aroma is sweet and very coffee like. The color is rich dark brown but when poured it has a small head. Flavor is rich with plenty of coffee and chocolate. Bitterness is about right for a stout. But despite having a rich flavor it has a thin palate for a stout. Aftertaste is like toasted bread that is bordering on burnt."
"Medium bodied, smooth and very drinkable. A very nice example of the style."
"Notes from 02/18/05."
"D- Easy drinker here. Nothing over the top. Typical but well done. I would drink a few of these in a sitting."
"Zum wohl!"
"D. Needs a little work. With all the beer on the shelf it may be awhile before I return to this one. The abv and the weak malt made me defer trying to age any."
"Drinkability - Overall, I like this brew, if not for the medicinal smell/taste. I'm wondering if its just my 6-pack, but its very faint, so who knows if its just my tastes or not."
"This overall is a very good beer to me. I went through my first one very quickly and went back for a second. Not watery, not milky, just good beer. Recommended"
"This one is more on the light-to-medium body side. Almost thin, which allows some of the burnt coffee ground flavors to be more apparent (it is what lingers when the sip finishes cleaner -- no coating factors here. Not a filling stout by any means. You can have a few and not be sick of it. Also a good one to mix in line if doing a session -- you can bounce back to this one and not have it be the dominant beer."
"Decent tasty brew, and very drinkable. I think I'll have another."
"2.5	D far too coffee-like for me with too little else going to make me think i'm drinking beer. could see how coffee lovers would enjoy, but it's not for me."
"D: Overall, this is a pretty tasty beer. Not the most outstanding brew I've ever had, but well made and drinkable."
"Don't drink and review."
"Out of the bottle and into my glass this beer produced a billowing, foamy head of brown suds. Nice retention in clumps and it did lace fairly well. Appearance is very deep brown with aromas of rich malts. The flavors were equally dark, coffee, chocolate, mocha and some black licorice. Smooth mouthfeel, light carbonation and easy to drink. Nothing groundbreaking but a good example of the style."
"Feels rich & pleasing in the mouth, & benefits from a unique taste to my untrained palate."
"Maybe a touch too harsh for the optimal balance, but still a damn good stout."
"Very dry, serious, and assertive for a ""plain"" irish stout."
"D - Great beer."
"Very drinkable, I could easily finish a few pints. This stout is clean, smooth, and has a well-varied roast character. Add a little more sweetness from malt, a touch more bitterness and the beer becomes an A/A+."
"D - Drinkable."
"Overall: At the very least this is a great alternative to guiness much richer and more full bodied, but then again that is compared to guiness."
"I need more Avery's after sampling this one. Bring on the Reverend!"
"Does Avery make a bad beer? This is no exception. Creamy head on the top, lacing down the glass. Smells of cocoa and coffee, though not as much as an imperial. Taste is great, chocolatey and very rich for a low alcohol beer. A terrific winter session beer. I will be revisiting this one often."
"Had this beer as an after dinner drink yesterday while at a restaurant. Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours with a fairly large head. Dark black in color, with a slightly brownish white colored head. Smell was good, lots of roasted notes. First sip, though, got me hooked. Slight hint of chocolate intertwined with coffee greeted my taste buds, followed by that roasted dark malty flavor that we all drink stouts for. Mouthfeel was dead on, just enough body to it to give it some substance, but smooth enough to make it an easy drinker. I wish all stouts by American breweries were like this, because Avery nailed it."
"Drinkability- One of the better domestic irish dry's I've had. Heck one of the better any kind of domestic stouts I have had. Very drinkable."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, slightly filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer even though I don't typically go for this style."
"Black down the middle with just a little bit of brown down the sides of the glass. Tan head remains to the bottom with some small lacing. Smells of chocolate and some malty fruitiness. The taste is different. It really has alot of roasted character to it. I would say a hair too much. Alot of coffee roast in it with a small amount of chocolate. Not bad just very roasty. I would drink again."
"Color is close to black with a whispy tan head. A collection of dry roasty malts and some sweet fruit tones. Taste also has a nice dry malt component followed by some richer choclates and coffee. Very faint hop presence does its job. A crisp medium body begs this to be enjoyed with a big greasy burger. A good drinkable stout."
"Very flavorful dry stout. Much more bitter (from burnt barley) than the average dry offering."
"A great bitterness greets the palate on the first sip, dominated by coffee and chocolate, but well-balanced by a nice hoppy presence. Typical for the style, this stout finishes dry with a pronounced, lasting bitter note. The body is on the thicker side of medium, with a good carbonation level and a hint of creaminess. Overall, I was pleased with this stout. It's not an extrordinary beer, but I'll definately be looking forward to my next encounter with Out of Bounds. Avery delivers again."
"Drinkability: Excellent initial roasted taste and dryness. However, after that novelty wears away, it leaves a little too much of a void for the rest of the beer. Still, a nice dry stout whose smell I prefer over the average, and taste will make it stand out in my mind."
"I'm not a huge fan of the charred flavor here. It's kinda like slightly burnt popcorn, still edible but not really enjoyable. If that's your thing though, this is a decent irish dry stout."
"A bit dry, but smooth. Tiny bite on the way down. Does leave a milky film. It's a delicious, balanced brew. Dry, bitter and biscuity. Quote good."
"12 oz bottle. Pours opaque black with limited brown foamy head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma of hops and malt. Initial flavor is dominated by hop bitterness with some sweet malt. Flavor ends with the hops, where they become more floral than straight bitter. Aftertaste is moderately lasting. Limited lacing, light carbonation, medium body, and limited alcohol noted. Drinkability is very high, liked the dry stout style and thought it was impressive for an ""average"" tier beer."
"D: The dryness cuts down on the drinkability quite a bit for me but for what it is it is good. Realizing I just do not like dry stouts."
"d: On the richer side for the style. Very robust charred flavor. A little too charred for my taste, creates a pretty harsh flavor. Not a bad stout, but not one of favorites."
"Mouthfeel is substantial enough, not too heavy, this isn't an imperial stout or anything. Fairly easy to drink, i could have had another right after, but the dark roasted malt character would be hard to take in too large of doses."
"Overall, I'm not a fan of Irish dry stouts, but I enjoyed this one. Something I could actually see myself having several of."
"The best all around colorado style stout you can find.This is the beer that got me hooked me on Avery beers and is I believe a perfect example of what the company inspires. Experimenting with making beer using unconventional ingredients and coming up with a one of a kind original tasting product. Prost!"
"D-this stout is not nearly as drinkable as other more mass produced stout brews,but much more complex and heavy,very solid"
"overall a nice example of a dry stout."
"This may be my favorite stout. I definitely recommend!"
"Mouthfeel was light. Low carbonation. I knew this was a dry stout going into it, but after smelling the beer, I expected more."
"Easy to drink. A good stout and worthy of a try."
"Nice."
"Has a very nice opaque color, with a slight head and a bit of lacing. It has a very slight scent of burnt grains, but nothing very strong. It's one of the weaker smelling stouts I've had. Very nice taste, though, an excellent coffee flavor to go with the burnt grains. It goes down fine, with just a hint of roughness. A good stout."
"12 oz single bottle purchased from Buy Rite on Oak Tree in South Plainfield for about two bucks... picute of a skier with snow on the logo sticker... first time I was able to locate a single of this brew, so I decided to give it a try... perhaps the most impressive facet of this brew was its very attractive dark, jet-black, ebony hue with an incredible five-fingered, frothy, tan, reddish head which exhibited enormous staying power... smell was comlete with roasted malts, dark coffee, and sugars... taste was very powerful, with strong dark espresso, latte, and malt essences... very flavorful, and thick brew which further enhanced Avery's reputation for producing world-class, top-notch brews... this stout was an excellent representation of the style... not overbearing or cloying with a modest 5.1% ABV that was still rich and creamy... supreme chocolate and coffee flavors burst through on this sample... packs quite a punch... really good stuff... Recomended..."
"D - a few pints can be had very easily."
"This beer poured a dark opaque black with a single-finger tan head. The smell is rich chocolately roasty malts. The taste of bittersweet chocolate and a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel was a little thinner than I expected, and is extremely drinkable for a stout. A good example of the style."
"D - Not bad at all. I got my hopes up based on the beautiful head and lace, and was a little disappointed with the forceful sour lactic flavor. I would not hesitate to pick up a six of this if I felt like drinking a nice dry stout, but it's nothing to crap your pants about."
"Poured into a pint glass (Wasatch) a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is roasty/malty, nice touch of toffee/coffee/caramel. The taste is very nice, roasty/malty, with some toffee/coffee/caramel. The finish is dry/slight bitterness. Medium body. Drinkable, I like this one, very tasty, true to style. Thanks Joe."
"Good beer to have one bottle of, but I wouldnt want to drink a six pack of it."
"This isn't a complete disappointment, but I was certainly hoping for more from Avery, whose wares are normally top-shelf. Not this one. Irish Dry Stout is an apt style, but not one with which I'm enamored. This needs more balance in the flavors. Coffee is fine; primarily coffee minimizes the contributions of other elements that can only improve this nice, but not great, beer."
"Very satisfying stout. I love the smell of this one....could smell it for hours. Great version of this style. Another solid offering from Avery."
"Prosit, MK"
"Overall, not spectacular, but not bad. It is what you expect out of a stout, but nothing remarkable."
"Deep black color with a very slight carbonation level. Nice roasted aroma-somewhat chocolatey. Very mild caramel sweetness to the aroma. Good solid roasted flavor. Mellow espresso taste to it. More hopiness then I care for but it doesn't detract from the other flavors. Decent body. Quite enjoyable."
"Pours pretty dark and a little bit of light shows through. Head is dark tan and has some nice staying power while leaving a bit of lace on the way down. Nose is a nice roasted bean thing. Quite nice really. Flavor is extremely robust and full. Great smoky qualities to it. Meaty, hearty. Just thick but smooth. Feel has a good carbonation to it and the liquid is good too. Overall this is a very nice dry stout. My first sip ended up killing half of the pint."
"I'm absolutely loving this beer. Looks black in the glass, but held up to the light, the beer takes on a deep red color. Smell is incredibly dark, roasty, coffee deliciousness. Taste is just bitter enough, with a really smooth chocolatey finish. Carbonation is completely perfect for a stout. Well done, Avery!"
"D- fits style like a glove, fantastic aftertaste, recommended for dry stouts"
"Medium bodied. smooth, and hearty. Not as creamy as it could be. Overall a great stout."
"No dissapointment here though. A nice dark roasted coffee taste right up with a bit of cream running through through it and some hazelnut flavor in there as well. Since this is a dry stout there is a hop thing in the end but the slight bitterness that comes from it is balanced out with the brew's initial flavors. A medium body that set it's apart from that watery backend that Guiness type darks have but not that thick neck/hairy knuckes heaviness that some of the ""extreme stouts"" a lot of mirco's are mixing up. I still haven't immersed myself into a many of Avery's beers yet to make the call that they are one of America's top 5 brewery's yet but everything I've tried by them so far has been something damn good."
"Not bad - could be a bit smoother. One that I liked more as it progressed. A little rough for the style, but decent enough overall."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little thinner than I would prefer, perfect carbonation for a stout. Slightly dry finish. This is an extremely drinkable and pleasurable stout. I wasn't it to be this good actually because I remember being underwhelmed when I first tried it over a year ago."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin in my opinion and lacks some of the creaminess I was hoping for was I initially poured this one. The more I drink this the more I loath the mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little off as well and comes off being too strong. Drinkability is great and this would serve as a delicious sessionable beer."
"Overall- Reminded me of Tröegs- Dead Reckoning <--- although this is a porter. Nice and hoppy and dry up front, creamy in the end. Delicious."
"Poured a dark brown, almost black color with a 1/2 inch, light tan head that dissipated quickly into a thin surface skim with light consistent lacing throughout the tasting. Smell of roasted malt and coffee. Flavor consistent with smell. Lightly carbonated with a slight tingle on the tongue and a somewhat chalky, bitter finish. All and all, not a bad dry stout."
"Pours very dark brown to black leaving a 1 finger brownish tan head that stays around, leaving a good amount of lacing. Smells is roasted malts and coffee. Somebody else mentioned raisins. Now that they pointed that out I can smell a little of it too. Bitter coffee right away with a big roasted taste. Chocolate is there too. A little of that raisin in the aftertaste. Pretty drinkable."
"This beer pours a nearly opaque black color with brownish hues. The head is large, tannish white, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, coffee, and milk chocolate. The taste is of roasted malt with a faint hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent dry stout. I would drink it again, but I would rather have an O'Hara."
"This makes a nice alternative to Guinness, and would make an excellent session stout. If this were to turn up in Spokane for a decent price, I would definitely buy it again."
"this is one of the most drinkable stouts i have tried recently, overly thin yes, but that makes it drinkable as hell, overall a very good beer, it has it flaws, but i will be buying this again."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. It smells like roasted malt, chocolate and some coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also a charcoal/burnt/chalky taste. Finishes with a nice bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium, and leaves a slight coating on the tongue. Drinkability is good, not a bad choice for a session beer IMO. For the style it's pretty decent, I'd buy this again in the future."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer to drink, but it doesn't fit the category very well...I guess that is why they call it ""out of bounds"". It has a decent flavor, but the flavors that are there seem to be out in the open by themselves...so it doesn't really meld all that well. I am a pretty big fan of Avery beers, but this is probably one of my lesser favorite of the line. It is OK, but I will be sticking to a number of other stouts."
"This begins my foray back into stouts from IPAs. Drank one; then I had a ""session"" of the remaining 5. [Note: This is NOT a SESSION brew, I do not care what anyone says or thinks.] Rich chocolate/nut aroma. Spotty sheen of tan head. Even a vigorus pour does not yield a lasting head. Very opaque black, transmitted color is a deep amber with ruby tints. Slick and slightly chalky/resinous palate. Superglue lacing. Stout up front, straight porter in middle and aftertaste. Each phase is plesant. Definitely NOT one-dimentional. Even my emitted noxious gas was plesant tasting. Soft conditioning, made me feel fuller than mouthfeel. Drinkable fast or slow, but if you start slamming you'll soon go to sipping. Almost perfect, except for palate being a little chalky. If you like Guinness, step up to this stout tough guy!"
"Nice deep brown color, with light red highlights, a finger of tan head that dissolves fast. Nose of strong roasted malt, and coffee. Taste is likewise. Roasted malt, coffee, and some brown sugar as well. Body is a little thin, but the carbonation is good. A solid stout but not one to go nuts over."
"Drinkability: I'll only have this one... I don't recommend this...."
"D- a solid stout"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. It goes down easy enough, but I really think one is enough for me. Just a bit too much of a dry, bitter taste (not in a particularly good way). All in all, it's okay. Wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it though."
"D- This is a good, drinkable irish stout. Its much tastier and more drinkable than others I have had from this style. Something that I will revisit in the future. Good for a dreary day."
"This beer poured a black color with a red hue. The head was thick and rocky. The aroma was of malt and coffee, but was faint. The taste was roasted and coffee flavor with the sweetness from the malt noticeable. The mouthfeel is full and slightly oily, leaving a coating on the tongue. The synergy of the flavors and mouthfeel of this brew make it a delight to drink."
"For the style, this beer had quite a bit of flavor. Poured a dark, chocolate milk brown in color with nary a head. Really it was only a slight film. Nose was earthy and malty with ust a slight hint of charcoal. Flavor was very nice. Malty with some burnt chocolate bits. Also, got quite a bit of charcoal and cinder flavor which was quite nice. Medium body that slightly thickened as the beer warmed while sitting on the bar's porch in the summer sun. Would definitely recommend."
"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a light tan head. Aroma is dark and roasty with some coffee and charcoal. The taste is dark roasted malt with a nice dry and lingering bitter finish. Overall, this is a really nice stout that I will certainly be purchasing again. Recommended."
"Notes: A nice, simple straightforward dry stout."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a black coffee color, minimal head and minimal lacing. Smell a little sweet and a little malty but nothing significant that stands out. Taste was weird at first for a Stout, then exciting because it was different but ultimately average. Alcohol definitely present especially for a 5.1 % ABV. Then a roasty malt with a mocha coffee flavor finishing very bitter. Mouthfeel is medium and odd for a stout. Very tannic on the tongue with unusually high carbonation and a lot of lingering bitterness for a ""dry"" stout. Not very drinkable IMO. I'm a huge Avery fan but this is probably the least favorite stout I have tried."
"D- a complexed stout, but the bitter coffee flavors were a little abrasive and it seemed a bit distracting at times."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. This stout poured a deep black color with a huge, rocky tan head that lasted, leaving behind some faint lace. The aroma consisted of a big, roasty chocolate malt note, followed by a bit of coffee. The flavor was made up of dry, roasted malts, with some light coffee and chocolate notes. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied leaving with a dry, slightly bitter finish. Well done. A good sessionable stout."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very dark brown - pretty much black, with a sparkling, frothy brown head. Smell is of roasted malt and there is a surprising amount of hops in the nose. Taste is mostly toasted/slightly burnt malt but is balanced out nicely by a grassy hoppiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light, creamy carbonation. This is a drinkable stout, pretty tasty too."
"D: Quite drinkable."
"A solid dark black color with a fine head. Aroma strikes me as somewhat like ""mash", pre-bourbon, but the taste jumps out to full charcoal. This seems somewhat of a mix of stout and porter, pretty thick and robust but very drinkable. Good stuff."
"Poured into pint glass. Poured a nice dark deep brownish black with a nice thick foamy head. The size of the head disappated, but thickened up on standing, and left lacings as I drank the beer. Smelled very slightly of oatmeal. Didn't pick up much for flavor. Slightly grainy with very small touch of brown sugar. Tasted bitter on the tounge and in the mouth. Very easy to drink, but not very pleasant due to the bitterness/acidity."
"This beer pours an attractive inky black with lots of fluffy white head that fades on the surface of the liquid, but clings aggressively to the glass. Aroma is very lightly sweet and roasted, like coffee with condensed milk in it. Flavor is rather roasty, but occupies an unsatisfying ground that is neither exceptionally dry and roasty (no ""burned pizza crust"") nor sweet like the aroma would indicate. Mouthfeel is not bad, but just a bit watery up front. Not bad, but not great."
"Overall: a pretty good stout. More candy bar-ish than is typical for the style. Not a lot to set it apart from other stouts, but it would be a decent session beer."
"Quite satisfying, full flavored, with huge hops, tempered by roasty chocolate malts...mmm, mmm...I quite like it."
"Out Of Bounds Stout poured an extremely dark brown that almost had me fooled that it was a dark black beer. It tried to pull a fast one, but it didn't work. If you hold it up to the light, you can see a few glimmers of ruby red highlights in the middle of the beer. It had a 1 and a half inch head of tan/mocha foam that had decent retention that left behind some mocha rings along the edge of the beer and some spotty tan lace around the glass. The aroma consisted of roasted coffee beans, roasted malts, cocoa, dark chocolate, and with a slight funky smell of black smoke in the background. The taste was slightly dry with bitter dark chocolate, roasted malts, cocoa powder, roasted coffee beans, and a few dry roasted hops in the background. When the beer really warms up, a slight hint of caramel will emerge in between the dark chocolate and roasted malts. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a slight dry aftertaste of bitter dark chocolate and roasted malts. Avery says this beer is an ""extreme experience."" That's stretching it a bit too far. A nice offering from Avery that has plenty of roasted flavors, but it's no where near extreme. Going down the Widowmaker, now that's extreme! This beer? Not even close. Would I pick this one up again in the future? I might if I'm in the mood for a decent reasonably priced Dry Stout."
"Overall I would say that it is an average beer with above average potential."
"Pours a deep black that obscures all light. A thin tan head quickly rises, no waiting for this stout to foam, but disappears way to quickly. Smells of piney hops and burnt oak with something sweet and malty creeping in from the back. Dry, hoppy taste, and burnt caramel. Mouthfeel a little thin for a stout, not as creamy as it should be. Good brew, but lacks a little something to make it a great."
"This came of as more of an English stout to me, not th best, but a pretty good one. The flavor was mostly coffee with some sweetness from the yeast. It was a big, rich flavor, a bit heavy, but still nice. The aroma also focused on the coffee/roasted grains. Worth a try if you're into stouts."
"Black in color with a small but lasting head of white foam. Moderately aromatic with hints of chocolate, roasted malts and burnt currants. Big roasted malt flavor with notes of chocolate, coffee and plums followed by a substancial citrus twang from the hops. Very hoppy but it works with this very well. Nice mouthfeel. A very good beer."
"The taste is also a bit odd, the smoked malt thing returning, roasted a whole bunch, not very much depth to it. The body is somewhere around medium, the carbonation about right, but still comes off a bit.. well, off. In all, not my favorite selection from Avery, and I do like my stouts, but overall pretty decent."
"The mouthfeel of this is very rich and deep, incredibly creamy and dry. I'll be drinking many more of these, but not tonight..."
"Drinkability is alright. I will finish the beer without any problem, but one is enough. Give it a try."
"D - I think this would be a good stout for non-stout drinkers. It is not too heavy on the palate and the flavor is not overpowering."
"This one puts the ""dry"" in Irish dry stout. Dark as can be on the pour; a bright light coaxes only a bit of crimson at the margins. Capped by a rocky, clingy tan head. Darkly roasted smells dominate the nose--coffee and bittersweet chocolate, though a bit of ripe, dark fruit is present too. The taste is similar, with a bit of sweetness overtaken by heavily roasted malts. Medium-bodied at the start, giving way to a lingering dry finish that invokes downing a spoonful of cocoa powder. Intense but not very nuanced. I am glad to have tried it but won't likely grab it again."
"Maybe a little bitter but still very drinkable"
"Drinkability? I'll have to average it - one bottle can be quite drinakable, however I would rarely want to make this a session, or even have more than one."
"This beer pours a really nice opaque black with a huge 3 finger dark tan head that laces all over the place. The smell is black coffee and a lot of roast malt and black patent with a touch of a wood smokey character as well, maybe a bit too heavy on roasted malt/burnt coffee. The taste is full of bitterness from the dark malts combined with a burnt or iced coffee taste, not something I'm a big fan of. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, definitely still a medium bodied beer but maybe I'm too used to the full body and smoothness of guinness. A decent to good Irish dry stout not a standout by any means but not bad for a change of pace."
"D: I'd probably try this again, though I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for it. A good, not great beer."
"Serviceable balanced stout. Fine for a dry Irish style stout, with some coffee, a tad heavy roast with a spot of smoke, jet black colour, appropriate carbonation, medium mouthfeel, and dryish finish. A bit bitter and acidic in aftertaste, like coffee can be."
"Worth a try."
"A decent overall brew, but I expect more from Avery, which usually serves up a more robust brew, still, it is an Irish Dry so they did hit that mark"
"An OK dry stout. Perhaps a bit one sided with the char and some offness that was unsuiting to the overall experience."
"---"
"M&D - smooth and well balanced, a nice stout, from a nice brewery, well flavored and well balanced, an easy down stout that is easy to enjoy"
"A very flavorful Dry Irish Stout, which is quite a pleasant change of pace to the boring, one-dimensional offerings that are out there in abundance. When you're in the mood for this style, a six pack of Out of Bounds won't disappoint."
"The dryness is nice. Really bites the toungue. But is a bit thin in the back."
"I love Avery, but this falls very short. No real balance, no real character, and finish is almost awful, if you want something more than ""dry""."
"Overall a very nice dry stout. Very sessionable."
"Toasted in honor to those who are in the middle of a massive winter storm. Stouts are best enjoyed during blizzards! Black in color, simple, with a thin crusty light shoe brown head; smokey malts, chocolate and lightly roasted coffee beans are combined in the aroma. Up front, a pleasant smokey-bitterness, dark roasted malts slide across the palate and form a roasty bitterness. Pleasant barley malts and cocoa flavorings come across. Medium bodied; very creamy and dry, there are some leafy hops noted as this beer warms up a bit. Do not serve cold; drink at cellar temp. A darn good dry stout. Give it a try!"
"Pours a black color with a nice beige head and some lacing as well. Aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, licorice, coffee, dark fruit and smoke. Taste is of chocolate, roasted malt, and espresso. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth and has a pleasant carbonation level. Pretty drinkable stout that would make a nice session."
"Poured into a Sammie Smith english pint glass. Pours a very dark opaque, not quite totally black; right on style. Very large and rocky head--very impressive. Very good lacing. Not much of an aroma which surprised me. The taste is really roasty and very nice, with a bit of a hop bite on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is very smooth and full. A really good drinking irish style dry stout. Avery has done another good job here. Avery is quickly becoming one of my fave western brewers."
"D - Very good stout. The roasted malt flavor is very nice."
"Pours with a jet black body and khaki colored, rocky head that sticks tenaciously to my glass. Roasted malts and coffee sweetened with brown raw sugar on the nose. On the tongue, this beer steps up its complexity. It starts out thick and just a bit bitter with hops, before moving on to silky sweet/sour malts typical to the style. The finish is long and bone dry, with roasted malts warming the tongue. This beer is on the thick and substantial side, especially compared to the paragons of the style, but it doesn't compromise drinkability. Overall, this is a very good Irish dry stout, staying pretty true to style while also being identifiably American."
"I found this beer to be a little off. The flavors aren't as balanced as it could be. The unusual woodyness and immense dark grain seem a little harsh. I didn't have any trouble drinking this one. But there is better out there."
"Very drinkable, a very good dry irish, I'm really digging the extra bitterness in it."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beers body is sleightly less than medium bodied. The carbonation is on the low side. I would have liked a bit bigger body to this beer. The beer was fairly easy to drink and has been sessioned at my place on numerous occasions."
"Thanks for the trade HogTownHarry!"
"This one couldn't wait to get out of the bottle and celebrate. So after pouring 85% foam between an Ayinger mug and a Sunset tall glass and refilling with the excess from the bottle it finally came to a mushroom cloud atop the Sunset glass and sl-l-l-l-l-lowly settled. There's still a smoke puff of scud cloud at top and that's fine with me daddy-o. Everything has its purpose and as such this cloud performs its duty. Similar to winter cloud cover does in keeping heat from escaping and the tempertaure from plummeting this buffer zone keeps me from gulping this fucker right down. Exultant dark mark, mucilaginous hops and an indeterminable scintilla of fruit that gives a puissant taste which perorates in idiolallic tongues. Yes, it is OK to look over the precipe, laugh and then consider jumping."
"Bold, bitter, & burnt. That's how I would characterize this beer. Appearance is very dark brown/black; slight tan head stays consistent throughout. Fair amount of lacing. Aroma is crisp, burnt, & malty. First sip and everyone thereafter is bitter & hoppy. Aftertaste is bitter as well. Solid stout, but would be hard to drink more than a few at a time."
"The mouth is light, yet dries out, getting bitter and smoky on the finish. I wish there was some more complexity, more of a progression into the rather harsh finale. It's alright, but not one of my favorites from Avery."
"D: Pretty solid stout. Nothing unexpected, but nothing out of whack. Dry, pleasant on a cold day, and hits the spot. I can see myself eaasily enjoying one or two of these in an evening."
"Very easy to drink, sessionable. Not a complex beer, but a well done beer, very solid."
"Poured a rich, very dark brown with almost no head and a few tan bubbles. Looks much thinner along the edges when I tilt the glass and shows some reddish highlights. Not all that aromatic for a stout, but smells faintly nutty and malty. Very smooth and creamy at first sip, but it doesn't take long for the hops zing to kick in. Prickly on the tongue as I swallow, and finishes very dry with a bit of bitter aftertaste. This is certainly not a boring beer. I'm pretty sure I'm a fan and will definitely revisit."
"Pours a jet black color with brownish white head that has more than 1/4 inches worth of head on it. Leaves lacing as it falls, but has no real lacing itself. The head is thick a fluffy like ice cream. The smell is like an expresso with good roastiness and some cocoa as well. Taste is coffee, like the expresso smell. Mouthfeel is smooth, overall I think it's ok, worth drinking more often."
"Tasty enough but there are better versions of the style. Probably should be reclassified as a Milk Stout."
"Drinkability: I stopped at one, but I only had one. I could get down with a few of these."
"D- For the style, it's better than most. The dry crispness makes it easy to drink with some nuts or cheese."
"the flavor is full, rich, malty, bitter, roasty, spicy, bitter."
"Out of Bounds Stout had a medium body that lacked the feeling I look foward to in a good stout. It wasn't a bad stout it just seemed to be another beer from a brewery that seems to make so-so beer to me. It's a nice style but it had nothing to set it apart from anything."
"This beer was poured slow out of a tap, and it produced a rich, thick head that lasted nearly as long as I had the beer in front of me. I nearly burned my nostrils trying to smell this, The very dark roasted malt smelled smoky, like embers, with coffee and charcoal. It had a lovely mouthfeel, very creamy. If you like malt, this has it in spades, but the flavor was a litttle too overdone for me, like sucking on a burndt down forrest. I had a hard time finishing this one, although it was somewhat of a unique take on a stout. Worth buying a bottle and sharing it with some friends just so you can say; been there, done that."
"I know I'll look for this beer on my next beer restock excursion."
"Pretty easy to drink several. Hopefully the rest of the new Avery beers will fail to disappoint as well, unlike many of the hi-gravity beers of theirs I've had."
"Drinkability: The burnt coffee flavors were abit of a turn-off for me, admittedly a non-coffee drinker. I could imagine it being more drinkable in the winter, but for me I'd much prefer a number of stouts over this one. It's not bad, but it wasn't great."
"Could drink this for quite a while. Definitely sessionable, even though it's quite a monster of a stout. There are plenty of beers I'd rather drink, but I could drink this one for as long as I was out."
"12 ounce bottle. Avery Out of Bounds Stout pours out black with a large, brown head. The aroma is an earthy roastines. Roasted coffee flavor with some nuttiness. Not much hop flavor. There is a restrained sweetness, but the finish is very dry. The mouthfeel is creamy. Good drinkability. If this beer had a stronger maltiness, it would be a perfect dry stout. As is, it's still pretty good."
"Nice drinkability, a fair amount of bitterness which is right on for the style but mouthfeel isn't overly thick and heavy. Sits light on the stomach. Something I could come back to often since the ABV is low but the flavor is still there. A true to style irish dry stout, and beats guiness by a mile."
"Pours about as close to black as you can get. Nice tan head, great retention, and lacing. Smell is of roasted coffee and chocolate, with a hint of sweetness. Body is on the light side. Taste is almost fruity up front, but The finish was a bit bitter for me.Still a good beer,and well worth a try."
"A little too dry to enjoy more than a few, but stout lovers would probably easily session this. Although I prefer the new world porter, Avery comes through again"
"Mouth feel is full bodied and generously carbonated."
"A solid stout to be sure, but it lacked a certain ""wow"" factor to push it over the top."
"The body is black! What color is it around the edges? Black there too! Head is slightly tan/grey, not at all deep brown. And thick and rocky. Smells very strongly of black tea. Oh man! Now that I thought of that, I can't smell anything else. Slightly bready, a little bit of a soda scent. Taste & mouthfeel: Taste is also tea-like, dry and bready, resolving to roasty malt. A slight bitterness persists in an otherwise clean palate. Body is kind of thin, and I'm not sure how I feel about that; thicker would be OK but the lightness keeps it drinkable. Notwithstanding the glacial overpass pictured on the bottle, the tea flavor makes me think this would be a nice summer afternoon beer."
"Verdict: I can't say it's the best Irish stout around, but it's a nice stab at it."
"mouthfeel is full and robust. good stout but not the most drinkable. strong flavor."
"12oz. bottle: There was pretty much no head at all on my sample. The beer pours a very dark brown color. The main component of the nose is chocolate malts, with a fair amount of sweetness in there also. There is also some coffee notes. The taste is a good mix of chocolate malts, with some roastiness and coffee flavors. A bit of the sweetness comes through also. Nice!"
"Drinkability is average for the style."
"Bought a nice big bomber while on vacation. Pours a nice black color with a slight head of off- white to tan. A little hoppy citrus on the nose and some roast coffee aroma as well. Taste is nice- roasty and slightly burnt. Not overwhelming roast sensation, though; actually a little less than I might like. Mouthfeel is fairly crisp and dry. Could be a little thicker. The slightly thinner mouthfeel definitely makes it easy to drink a couple of these guys..."
"For my tastes, I think I would most likely max out at two of these in a sitting. This is a no nonsense, ""pay attention to me"" kind of beer. Hanging out with friends, everyone sharing in the craft beer revolution, this would be a hit. I don't think I could handle a beer like this at the 'average' bar, while being distracted by yuengling drinking friends, who no doubt would be ordering their third or fourth rounds while I was still savoring my first. Save this for those occasions when you can pay this stout the attention it deserves. It will be worth your while."
"This is a rather easy to drink stout. Pours a nice nearly opaque dark color. The head was moderate in size and duration. The smell was non-stimulating, with only faint hints of the malts within. The taste is slightly better than average, being slightly malty with limited hints a fruity flavors. The mouthfeel, which is very smooth, really makes this a highly drinkable brew. While I wouldn't recommend searching this beer out, if you come across it, it is worth giving a go as a mild and highly drinkable stout."
"Overall: Wish there was some more complexity in the taste. Pairs very nice with some smoke oysters."
"Great smell. Like a BBQ just lit with fresh cedar chips. Nice deep black color, but hard to get a head out of it and what little I teased up faded fast. Mmmm quaffable and bitter without being annoyingly over-hopped like a lot of Averys stuff. Damn solid beer that Id LOVE to see on draft somewhere."
"-UF"
"Looks like a porter but a little darker with a good white hat. The beer thins too much on the side. The smell is nice roasted with out too much coffee more chocolate. Tastes good if a little thin, I would like a touch more body, I know it is only 5% and all but... I guess you could session it but not something to seek out."
"cheers..."
"Avery hasn't impressed me so far as I have tried this stout and their IPA but here goes. Poured dark to black with very little head and almost no lacing. Smells strong with coffee most of all and hints of chocolate. Hops are ever present as well. Tastes of strong coffee which doesn't appeal to me as much as some stouts as well as its very bitter and watered down. Isn't even a pleasent feeling drink perhaps due to the watered down nature. Something that I wouldn't drink regularly."
"Is this beer worth drinking? You bet it is. I would probably keep a few of there in my beer fridge if I could find them."
"drinkability: not hard to drink but not good"
"Pours a dark, blackish color with slight ruby highlights. The head is tan, thick, dense, and long-lasting. This is a fine looking brew! The aroma has a pleasing and very intense roast barley smell. Theres a lot of burnt, and heavily roasted malt as wellcoffee, dark chocolate, and a lot of grain. Its exactly as a stout should smell. The flavor follows through and doesnt disappoint. A bit of sweetness is upfront, but its mostly dry and very satisfying. Creamy, mouthfilling, and very thick. Nice. There are no complaints with this brew."
"Drinkability: Well, I suppose. ""But," I'd quickly retort, ""There's a vast world of superior stouts out there to be had."""
"Overall, a so-so stout I'm glad I at least tried but doubt I will be purchasing again."
"overall impression - my number rakings rate this stout a little higher than i lead on in my review, but i just don't have the heart to rate it below a four in any category. nice stout."
"This was very good. Another excellent stout. I'll have more and I could see having a few while watching a flick."
"from the bottle. poured a dark brown to black, with a small tan head, that left a small amount of lacing. aroma bitter sweet chocolate, malts, coffee, brown sugar as it warmed got some hops. flavor that chocolate jumps right out there than a nice balance of malts, brown sugar coffee and got some honey. a very good beer."
"Delicious stout, regardless. Huge flavor, get some however you can find it."
"Pours a dark dark brown/black with a pinky of khaki head. Smells of milk chocolate cocoa powder, cherries, and a slight hop bite. Tastes is strong roasted black coffee up front, with mild bittersweet chocolate and a faint metallic hop bite that I've come to expect from Irish dry stouts. Mouthfeel is certainly thicker than the Guinness and Beamish I've had in the past which was a pleasant surprise. Certainly superior to the two mass-produced imports. Still one of my least favorite styles of stout, but this was an enjoyable rendition. Worth a go."
"Taste: Roasted malts, bitter coffee, and dark chocolate hit the tongue immediately. The initial bitterness then transformed into a hops bitterness on the finish, lingering well into the aftertaste. The sharpness of dark fruit lingered underneath, but didn't contribute much flavor. There were hints of milk and cream in the aftertaste."
"D - Well, if you like a weaker stout with a lower ABV, you'll take a shine to this. Frankly I just thought it was a little weak and needed a bit more to it, I wouldn't be seeking this out again."
"Poured into a standard pint glass, but I wish I was drinking it from a snifter. Ebony with a capichino head. Bouquet of bitter-sweet choclate. Very soft and round in the mouth and it goes down nicely. The taste starts much like how it smells but finishes like good espresso. I only have one from a mixed six but I will be returning for more as soon as the evenings get cooler."
"Go Phillies!"
"poured a deep brown, almost black color with puffy tannish head that fell to a thin long-lasting ring. Smell is nice with chocoalte and coffee predominate. Taste is good with notes of coffee and choclate, but hops are a bit overpowering. Finishes a bit dry for me. Overall a good beer, but not great."
"Finishes dry, as expected, with lingering hops. Have really liked previous Avery offerings but this brew is way, way too hoppy for my idea of a stout, even a dry stout."
"It's another Avery winner. Has the look of an ideal stout--color, head, lacing... Aromas are all sound--Chocolate, coffee, dark fruits. And a bittering quality that only America can provide. Tastes sweet with barley malt, chocolate malt, light cherries, dates, and figs. Bitter flavors rise up from the foreground displaying hops and a bit of a grainy texture in the body. Otherwise creamy, and silky. Finishes a bit astringent (ok, i'm being picky.) but thinned from alcohol sweetness. Lasting chared and bitter flavors."
"Bottle obtained directly from Avery Brewing in Boulder and consumed a couple days later. Pours a one-finger tan head over a dark brown liquid. Held to light it's dark brown with redish tints. Smells roasty, some chocolate, and a hint of toffee. Tastes potent roast. Some chocolate and caramel. There's a hint of rough grassy co-humulone, but hop flavor is minimal. I get some bitter, which I think is hops, but could be bitter from the roast. The aftertaste has a hint of cherry sour. Md body bordering on Md-thick and moderate carbonation. Still a thin layer of head over the top of the liquid and amazing lacing on the inside of the glass."
"Drinkability - pretty good stuff but there are better rounded stouts that appeal more to me."
"Drinkability: This beer would probably be great with a good cigar, but it just doesn't stand up on its own."
"Not a favorite stout, i wouldn't refuse one, but if I had a choice i'd find others."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice earthy black malt scent that is dry and a bit chocolatey. The taste is good also. It has a rich, dry black malt flavor. It goes down smooth and finishes quite earthy. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good stout. It has an intense black flavor; no compromise here."
"Drinkability and Overall: While this is not my favorite style in the world, this is a pretty decent representation. I'm not saying it's worth going out of your way to try this one, but if nothing is else was available, I'd have no problem qauffing this for quite some time."
"Drinkability-I would buy it again. But because it is pretty heavy I would stick to 1-2 a nite (more like 1)."
"Drinkability: A complex though quite hoppy stout, marred by the light mouthfeel and burnt flavors"
"Pours a very deep brownish ruby color, almost black. A sticky tan head is kicked up that smells of roasted barley and coffee. Black malts are up front, with a slightly burnt charcoal flavor. Transitions to rich coffee and chocolate flavors with some delicate roastedness and a hint of nuttiness. Hops are present at the end, showing a little spice and very subtle citrous. Finish is slightly hoppy but mostly roasted, leaving a dryish aftertaste. Really quite the tasty dry stout, much more robust than nitro stouts. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but that's part of the dry stout. That is part of the wicked drinkability. My glass was empty in no time. I would have no problem at all going through a few of these at a time."
"This one pours a dark dark brown (looks black unless held directly to light) with a thich foamy beige head. Smell is delicious---coffee, chocolate, roasted malts. Taste is very interesting---sweet, but with the burnt flavor really coming through strong. Very dry finish with a faint aftertaste of hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin for a stout. Beats Guinness any day, but there's nothing exceptional would make me go out of my way to find this brew."
"Very dark, almost black pour with tan head that unfortunately dissipated fairly quickly. Excellent chocolate malt aroma! Taste was different; dry burnt toast, charcoal  maybe a touch of malty goodness. Strange, but not unpleasant, gritty, almost salty mouthfeel and body. Glad I had two bottles, I was adjusted and enjoying the second much more than the first."
"Has all of the characteristics of a classic stout. I found it to have an almost refreshing taste for a stout. Therefore, I feel the bottle was appropriately labeled with the snow and the guy tearing up a mountain side. With the black color of a snowmans eye balls and the dark tan pour help keep it true to this style of beer. If your looking for a ""reach out and grab you"" stout then you best passing on this beer. In the end, its a stout I would pick up again."
"Smells like engine, looks like oil. Not even a hint of color around the edge. Straight up blackened malts. Makes for a blackened beer. Tiny hop burps. This tastes a little flat. Probably old as it was on sale. Robust - NOT. Dry, chalky and scratchy. Blah. I didn't find it very engaging. My wife and I both got 8 ounces down then set the pints aside and lost interest. She folded laundry, and I put away dishes. Boring."
"I have nothing bad to say about this brew. It's really just a stellar beer overall, and I wish I had picked up more than one bottle of it. Yum."
"Once again, props to Chris (clvand0) for sharing this. 12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep jet black color with one finger of light tan head. There is little lacing. The smell has lots of roasted malt mixed with cocoa powder. A great chocolatey nose. The taste is also fairly chocolatey. It has a good burnt malt background and even a hint of hops are present. The mouthfeel is fairly nice and strong. The drinkability is great for this stout. A nice offering from Avery."
"This beer pours an ever so slightly browned black color with a finger of head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is awesome. Lots of sweet chocolate, very creamy. This smells really nice. The flavor really nice, starting of a sweet chocolate but moving towards a sweet coffee on the finish. I really like it. The feel is a big moderate, with a slight drying finish. Overall, this beer is super good. This is easily a session stout."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black dark ale with a very small head with almost no retention. Aroma consisted mainly of medium roasted malt. I enjoyed the roasted notes very much and appreciated the balance between the roastiness and the bitterness. Also, a found no watery feeling at the end, which is something I despise in some stouts."
"<edit> Looks like this has changed styles to a Dry Stout since my review, but upon revisiting, it stays with the same ratings. Maybe the mouthfeel and drinkability could swing up a bit, but not enough to change my (most likely correct) first impression."
"It pours dark with a nice frothy stout head. There's plenty of lacing and the head lasts. Good malty body with a slight hop finish. This is far from an earthshattering brew, but it is quite nice. This would be a good craft beer to offer to Guinness worshippers. Cheers."
"An all around good brew. Appearance is almost black with and initial creamy light tan head. Decent lacing remains. Smell is of burnt malt and coffee. Taste has nice initial malt nose that lasts to mid-palate. The burnt malt kicks in at the finish, leaving a very nice dry, slightly bitter finish. Very easy on the palate and tongue...very drinkable."
"Drinkability - Despite the watery mouthfeel, I could see myself drinking several of these."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and partly creamy at the start with a super dry finish. The coffee and roasted malt tones last long on the tongue after swallowing. Nicely drinkable, a decent session stout."
"Split a six pack of this with a friend, Im interested to try a dry irish stout *besides* the ubiquitous Guinness. When allowed to warm up a bit and poured into a pint glass the body appears to be solid black, but when held to light its translucence is revealed and a ruby-red shows through. The head is tan, and ample, it retains like a champ and leaves thick sheets of lace down the pint. The nose is rather estery, I can pick up fruit aromas similar to dark berries before the pint even approaches my face. As my nose approaches I pick up powdery cocoa aromas and dark, roasty coffee. This is quite a flavorful dry-stout, the flavors of milk-chocolate and bitter chocolate toy back and forth with each other, faint berry flavors and dark roasted coffee stand firmly together before a bitter earthy hop kick in the finish. Nice and roasty with a medium bitterness throughout. This beer is nice and smooth and gets more so at cellar temp, holy damn what a great session stout. I would recommend anyone try it, and I will not hesitate to grab some more the next time I see it."
"Basically black in hue, there is some ruby highlights around the edges, especially when held to a light. Still, the liquid is basically opaque. The head was over two fingers in height, beige in color. Head retention was very good; it slowly faded to a rocky cap that lasted the entire consumption. This beer looks very typical of a stout, aside from the fact the subsequent lacing looks like tattered wallpaper. Impressive. The nose is malty, kind of smoky, roasty with coffee influences, plus some chocolate and charcoal. Astringent. There is also a faint, slick, milky sweetness at the distant back. This bouquet is stout-like, the potency is fairly sturdy and the smells are articulated clearly. I really like the nose. The hint of smoke elevates the bouquet over many of its brethren. Inviting to say the least. The palate doesnt make the nose out to be a liar. Pleasant roasty flavors, faint smoky qualities, slick chocolate with a milky sweetness that is very minimal. Coffee beans. Licorice. Charred wood. Distant piney hops it seems. I really like this beer; it is very tasty with plenty of flavors in the mix. I mean this is just a stout after all and damn, its good! It is robust in a restrained kind of way. Hey, I used the word restrained in a review for a beer from Avery! Ive come to the conclusion Averys best beer comes in 12-ounce bottles. Moderate abv, I could session with this dandy. Long aftertaste, I really want some sharp cheddar cheese or grilled meat! Medium in body, modest carbonation, the mouthfeel is pleasant, I could ask for a little more body but it is good as is. This stout is damn drinkable. Give me a six-pack! Lovely stuff from start to finish, thus far this is the best tasting and most eloquent beer Ive had from Avery. I purchased a 12-ounce bottle in Brookfield, WI. Recommended. I want more."
"Pours a nice rich black with some crimson color highlights with a huge fluffy almond colored head that sticks nicely to the side of the glass,some roasted malt and nuttiness come thru in the aroma along with a touch of unsweetened chocolate that comes thru more as I drink more.A mellow tasting brew at first but as it warms alot more flavor elements come out some highly roasted malt and some cocoa powder with a lingering dry earthiness in the finish,quite tasty.A smooth creamy-like feel makes this brew very easy to drink,one of the better dry stouts I have had in awhile."
"Poured tar black in color with a light brown head of creamy foam. The aroma has a wonderfully roasted nuttiness with slightly burnt dark grains and toasted breads. Theres also some cocoa/chocolate notes. Beautiful bouquet. The taste is sublime with mellow coffee notes and a perfect roasted bitterness. A chocolate sweetness entices the palate and the beer goes down with a silky smoothness. The body is solid and this finishes clean and leaves me satisfied. Actually, this leaves me wanting more  like a case or two. An excellent stout that I would highly recommend."
"In some ways this tastes very much like Ellies Brown, just with more dark malt character. It is fairly light, nicely drinkable, but the rough dark malt notes that where barely perceptible in Ellies Brown are starting to become dominant here. This is not a bad flavor per se, but it just adds a harshness to this beer that is not really needed."
"Overall - A perfectly drinkable stout. Mildly complex, quite chocolate oriented, reminds me a bit of a cream stout."
"A decent, dry stout, but not outstanding. The malt profile could be more assertive, but it's above average for style."
"Great name and label. The full glass is very inviting, with its deep dark brown color and light brown foamy head. Aroma is malty and chocolatey, and I defintely can pick out some hop smells. Mouthfeel is a little tingly upfront, with a watery finish. Flavor is nearly non-existent on the front of the tongue, and seems like an imperial as it rolls down the sides of the tongue - bitter chocolate and coffee, with a bitter linger. Doesn't seem true to the style, but a tasty beer nonetheless. Thanks Brent."
"Pours a deep black liquid, with some slight ruby highlights around the edges. Small compact tan head, which disappeared too quickly, leaving little to no lace on the glass. Smells of black licorise, maybe a little dark fruit and alcohol. Good roasty flavor. Some bitterness from the roast character, and not much hop bitterness. Finish is dry, slight coffee flavor lingering on the tongue. Medium body, low carbonation. Overall, a nice Irish Stout. Pretty drinkable as well. I would give this a thumbs up."
"Pours with a one-finger brown head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Totally black color. Medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is roasted coffer/chocolate. Starts with a chocolate/coffee flavor and finishes with a nice malt/hop balance. It's an Irish dry stout but it is not as dry as a Guinness. $1.65 for a 12 oz bottle; found at Vintage Cellar, Blacksburg, VA"
"Out Of Bounds Stout doesn't quite trip my trigger. As far as I'm concerned, it's a few fixes away from even being considered among the best domestic versions. Roasting the malt for a shorter time to decrease the harshness/astringency and making the body more full and creamy would be good starting points."
"Final Thought: Pretty solid showing for Avery with this one..."
"Drinkability: Fine beer with excellent nose and taste, but the bite would have me looking for a different stout after one or two"
"Drinkability & Notes: Quite robust for a smaller stout, hefty yet not huge. The long lingering roasted barley flavors really shine."
"Nice black body with mahogany around the edges. The head is dense and sticky and the a nice milky tan color. Good staying power and lacing. BEAUTIFUL aroma. Very strong coffee malt rises up above everything. Just gorgeous smell. The flavor falls flat after that aroma. Its nice a roasty, but a lot thinner than I was expecting. I was expecting a rich, full-flavored stout, but what I get is pretty typical of a better-than-Guinness dry stout flavor."
"What a nice stout! Pours into the glass jet black and has a nice foamy head that retains well. I smell espresso and hints of chocolate...this is going to be a good beer. The taste is definitely ""out of bounds"". Nice and complex...roasted malts, coffee, and a hint of sweetness all lightly brush the palate but none of them are overpowering. This was easy drinking for me. A really enjoyable stout that goes well with some barbequed pork. This is pretty close to what I think of when it comes to classic stout taste. Good work from Avery."
"12 ounce bottle, pours black with a dark tan head, leaving well developed lacing behind. Nose of expresso and chocolate. Nice roasted and black malt character. Some sweetness in the middle. Coffee, chocolate, cocoa, vanilla flavor notes. Medium bodied and nice syrupy, sticky mouthfeel. Long lingering finish. Nice sweet stout."
"12 ounce bottle. Love the label with the fresh powder."
"Nice to drink, loads of flavors and a nose that is top notch. I only wish for a better body and more flow, rather than a mouthful of goodies, seeminly all at once. I'm definately going to do this one again."
"not quite the most sessionable beer but damn good. it'd make a nice breakfast beer."
"The Out of Bounds poured a dark black with a smallish tan head that quickly went to a collar that laced the glass. It has a strong aroma of roasted malts, coffee and lots of semi-sweet chocolate. It is medium bodied and tastes of roasted malts and some chocolate up front with a very bitter, coffee-like, dry finish. Overall, a nice dry stout. The hops are very bold, but not quite over the top."
"This is a nice stout and is drinkable. Would probably sit heavy if I had more than 2 bottles though."
"Pitch black with a rusty head. The foam lasts for a good amount of time and leaves nice lacing. Smells of toasted malts and a mocha aroma. Very inviting amell. Deep roasted/burnt taste with mocha flavors and a rich body. Hints of coffee and a sweet toffee feel. There is a strong lingering chocolate aftertaste with a smooth finish. This is a very drinkable beer by Avery."
"The beer after disembarkation, pours soot black with some deep garnet high light, the head is personable in size, the texture frothy, the color a light chocolate with the lace a fine sealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is toasted grain, sweet malt, hints of caramel and coffee, quite fresh and inviting, start is ambrosial, nice malt profile, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish has big hop spiciness, carbonation piercing, quite dry and bittersweet, a pleasant enough stout."
"This beer pours a dark brown color and has a tan colored head. The aroma is malty with hints of a chocolate or coffee. It has a dark chocolate and coffee flavor, but with some hops tossed in. Very nicely blended and enjoyable. This is another well made beer from Avery Co."

"Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for such a dark and thick beer. Decent drinkability."
"The smell was definately the best part of this brew. It smelled just like coffee. No if, ands, or buts. Too bad the taste wasn't as good. The taste had the potential to be a nice creamy stout, but died out quickly to a not so awesomeness flat taste. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad beer by any means, but there are plenty better out there. If you want a nice milk stout, go with the Mackeson's XXX stout. This one was a little too grainy for me."
"I've becoming more and more of an Avery fan as the years go by. Out of Bounds is pure classic stout. Black like charcoal, mouthfeel like Guinness. Well developed flavors of coffee, bitter chocolate and burnt malt. I didn't find too much sweetness in this one though. Lack-lustre head, but that didn't seem to affect this stout's aroma one bit. A good beer for the winter, by the fire or trekking through the woods."
"Pours black with a nice tan head. Opaque except for some mahogany hues at the bottom of the pint. Tan head eventually flattens to cover the surface of the body. Excellent aroma of roasted malt, dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and chewy. Initial flavors of roasted coffee, mocha and caramel treat the tongue. Hop bitterness kicks emerges in the middle and carries into the long coarse finish. Dry and coating roasted malt finish. A great offering from Avery and a must-try for stout fans."
"Appears after a vigorous pour deep purple ruby almost opaque with a decent sized tan head, leaving scattered patches of lacing. Aroma contains deep roasts which bring out the chocolate and coffee notes but this one has a milk tone to it from the crystallized lactose added to the boil. Taste seems a bit off to me, with a woody offness to me other than that is the cream tone and deep roasts causing the chocolate and mild coffee notes, not too impressed seems dumbed down. Fuller bodied smooth carbonation, decent brew. Drinkability this one lacks an overall crisp flavor the lactose tone seems off in some way making me a little off centered on whether or not I like this one."
"Pours dark brown color, I can hardly see through the glass when held up to a light, small creamy tan head that leaves some lacing in my glass, has a chocolate and coffee aroma. Dark roasted malty chocolate burnt coffee flavor, light to medium body that has a crisp and carbonated mouthfeel, nice bitter and dry finish."
"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and choclately. A medium bodied stout. Malts are roasted, touch of chocolate, slightly sweet. Hops are fairly bold and spicy. They sort of overpower the malts, Still its a very drinkable dry stout. Mouthfeel is a touch thin. Finish is dry and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Out Of Bounds Stout: pours a very deep black, not much light if any can penetrate. A vigorous pour splashed up some tannish head, with fairly long lasting staying power. The aroma is somewhat chocolatey, with a bit of coffee. First sip is somewhat hoppy, with some coffee flavors as well. Very deep into the aftertaste, there is a nice blast of roasted malts. The taste is nice, the mouthfeel is very smooth. Nice balance, and taste, easy to drink, and worth picking up."
"I'll rate this as a dry stout. it has a nice roasty/toasty aroma and flavor with a clean dry finish"
"Pours a deep dark brown hue with a tan head. A very good stout, nice roasted maltiness with chocolate and coffee tones. This is another solid offering from Avery. I am starting to feel like a spokesman for these guys but this one is underrated too. I say buy it and see for your self."
"Pours a liquid pitch black that shows amber around the edges against the light. Aroma and flavor are an impressive coffee with lots a cream and sugar. The roasted malt is deftly handled, with no cardboard or over-roasted notes. Like drinking an iced Starbucks mocha latte. A coffee bitterness finishes very clean at the end, surprisingly so for such a dark beer. Quite sweet, but not cloying, and yet somewhat dry. I was quite impressed by this stout."

"This is kind of the kid brother to The Czar but it is a decent Dry Stout. Pours a dark brown (but not opaque) with a dark red halo. Aroma is strong roasted coffee with a little chocolate in the background. Rich with a big coffee presence, along with a little malt and chocolate. Finish is very dry and toasty with a light hops zing. Well-balanced and easy to drink."
"A black body reveals mahogany highlights at its base. It's initial short but creamy tan head drops readily to just a thin collar, although it does leave some nice lace. The nose is quite bold with sweet cocoa, dark chocolate, a touch of smoke, and a good helping of fresh brewed coffee. Very nice! The body is medium with an exceptionally fine carbonation that tickles the tongue. Although it appears sweet with chocolate and cocoa throughout the first few tastes, the roastiness and underlying bitterness develop on the palate as you progress through the glass. It starts with some nutty, caramelish cocoa; followed by rising notes of fruitiness. As it crosses the palate, dark chocolate emerges but morphs quickly into bittersweet chocolate as the hop bitterness begins to rise. Some underlying leafy hop flavor is sometimes noteable at this point. Roastiness, and even some smoky character, become evident at the swallow; and lead into a long, dry finish that's roasty, chocolatey and bitter with some leafy/floral hop character giving it depth. It's almost a touch woody as it lays in the mouth. Really nicely complex while maintaining a great deal of drinkability in it's body and mouthfeel. Worth trying!"
"This beer poured a very dark amber, almost black color. It formed a medium tan small bubbly head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt and roasted coffee. A flavor of malt and roasted coffee with a touch of burnt bitterness in the finish."
"Pours a nice dark black color, with a huge, chunky, creamy tan colored head, great retention. On the nose the aromas were faint really just whiffs of black coffee. Mouthfeel is creamy and fairly smooth. On the palate the flavors were mild, light malt flavors coffee, hints of caramel, not as sweet as like, bitter roastiness in the finish. Decent brew"
"Clear, dark brown to walnut brew forms a rocky tan head which sits atop medium sized bubbles. The head is clingy and meringue like with good retention and nice lacing. The aroma is very nice... like dark-roast freshly ground coffee, fresh grains, semisweet chocolate, vanilla and chalk. Begins with semisweet coffee, vanilla, cocoa, and chalk followed by a light earthy bitterness and long roasted tones. There is a touch of floral hoppiness in the burnt finish. Thinner mouthfeel than I am used to in a stout, perhaps because it's filtered. Pretty good job they've done here, but it would benefit from being smoother and full-bodied. This brew is good, but it just didn't excite me much, Was a bit too, well, ""Out of Bounds"" for my likings."
"Although this is fairly good, this is probably my least favorite of all the Avery beers."
"Pours black with some deep brown hints on its edges and a nice thick brown head that sinks to a thick fil on top of the brew but coats the glass nicely. Some chocolatey-caramel malt aromas are in here but there is also something that doesn't belong and I can't pick it out. Starts off thin and watery. Goes quickly to a big sweet chocolate taste with some roasted/burnt malt flavors following on the heels of the sweetness. The finish gets a bit metallic and burnt (not in a good way). Brew is, at first a bit thin before picking up to a decent, but still slightly thin, body. Metallic and burnt flavors at the end take some away from this brew. It seems to fall just a bit short of being really good. The flavors are a bit raw without any smooth transition between them. I agree with Cokes, if they just put a little bit of time in then they could make this a fine beer, but it definitely isn't there yet."
"It is a stout that could be tinkered just slightly and made pretty good.  However, I don't currently recommend it."
