review_text
"""Expired"" (but bottle conditioned) almost three months ago, still an excellent beer. In large snifter, couldn't quite get the head to the top (unless I wanted to really overdo things, leaving the beer about only 25% liquid). Opaque dark brown to black. Frothy, lightly-creamed coffee colored head, with bubbles increasing in size as it slowly dissipates. Sticky, fast drying lace. Smells of roasted and sweet malts and chocolate, taste is somewhat similar but favors roastiness and chocolate more than sweetness, especially in the back. Like a medium roast coffee, so tangy/acidic qualities, but with a pinch of hop bitterness and spice. Seems lower than 55 IBUs, which indicates excellent balance. Thick, rich brew with perfect, prickly level of carbonation. A little oily, mostly noticeable on teeth. Warming, but not drying at all on my palate. This stout is right up there with some of the better black ales in my book."

"O: great brew.  I'll be back..."
""
""
""

"O-This is a tasty stout that I should drink more of. The bitterness levels are just right for me.... It looks good, smells good, and tastes good. If I had to knock it, I would say that the mouthfeel is a little thin."
""
""
""
""
""
"No specific scent pulling through. Picking up mostly on burnt coffee bean. Leaves a bitter malty aftertaste that lingers for a few extra seconds.  Meh."
""
""
"Obsidian is the standard I use for stouts. Midnight black tan lacing, complex dark roasted aroma. The taste is absurdly good, with bitter dark roasted malt and dark chocolate sweetness predominant, anise, rum-soaked berries, and a healthy taste of bittering hops that do not bite. It's a bitter brew, not for those expecting Guinness or stouts of that ilk, but the bitter is elegantly balanced by a complex flavor profile. Moderate mouthfeel. Overall one of my all-time favorites in this style and in beers in general."
"Overall: The first time I had this a few months ago I remember thinking it was thin and lacking flavor compared to what I expect from a stout. After seeing the BA rating I figured I must have been missing something, or maybe I got a bad sample. Despite the very inviting presentation and a good balance I still found it to be lacking richness and flavor.  In every other respect it is an excellent stout, and it is very drinkable - I will happily drink more of these.  The Deschutes Black Butte Porter is more exemplary of its style in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Rich, roasty chocolate up front, with some pronounced charred, burnt wood accents. I get a bittersweet, warming finish. A strong, sturdy, and perfectly-executed stout that packs tons of complexity and flavors into every sip. Wonderful and an ideal example. Deschutes are masters of the dark-roast ale, and Obsidian more than proves it."

"Overall - What a kickass stout, and for an insane value to boot ($7.50 a sixer for me). As you can see from my review, I think this beer rocks on all levels, and there just isn't much more to say about it than that."
""
""
""
"O: As everyone below has mentioned, this nails the stout style"
""
""
"Smooth and good! Not too heavy a nice stout!"
""
"One of my favorites, from over twenty years ago.  Finally got to have it again on a ski trip this winter and it didn't disappoint, it was as good as I remembered."
""

"Definitely a world class beer. The way a stout should look and taste."

"This is one great tasting stout. Probably the best stout I've ever had."

"Dark and what a beer should taste like."

"Well balanced, nice and roasty...this is what a stout should taste like"
"Overall - great coffee creamy stout"

"Overall: This a great beer for a cold night. If you are a stout lover this a great beer anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious stout, very balanced flavor, not one note (coffee, chocolate, licorice, roasty malt, etc). like many stouts.  Only the right flavors are in here, and blended in sweet harmony.  Just enjoy this one and be grateful it exists."
""
""
""
""

"Pours pitch black with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention is mild.  Lacing is decent.  The aroma is not overpowering.  Mainly roasted malts and dark chocolate.  There is a mild coffee aroma there as well.   Dark roasted taste with coffee like hop and a smooth chocolate taste.  Very good beer.  Very smooth.  Nice chocolate aftertaste."
"Aggressive pour into pint glass. A: pitch blackt yielding two finger light brown head that leaves thick lacing throughout the full drink. S: bread and dark fruit with hints of caramel and malt. T: dark fruit, chocolate and caramel notes, malt, and hints of bread with an aftertaste of dark fruit and bitter hops. F: smooth, and very milky. O: great beer. I would drink this year round, but definitely accents the winter season."
""
"Poured a deep black color into a 20oz mug. Very good head and lacing. Wonderful and subtle malt flavors. A very nice and drinkable Stout One of the best"

"Holds up well for a stout in a bottle."

"If there's a better stout out there, I haven't had it."

"Had this on tap recently too, and I'd have to rate that experience as very close to perfection."
"Wow, what a wonderful stout, just so damn tasty and rich in flavor!"
"Beautifully dark stout with a smooth taste and feel."
""
""
"O:  I haven't had this in a while and I had forgotten how much I liked it. Very good beer to have on hand and I'm glad I have easy access to it."
"Looks pitch black.  Obsidian is a good name for this.  Nice tan head.  Smells of roasted coffee.  Tastes like smokey roasted coffee.  Nice smooth mouthfeel. Great stout in a 6 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"V - Medium."
"O: Frankly, this is one of the best stouts I’ve ever had. The flavors are bold and perfectly balanced while the beer is not too heavy or boozy. I’ve still never had even a mediocre brew from Deschutes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"my first real stout. still a great beer"
""
""
"Got  a bottle of this at a tiny shop in Honolulu.  While the smell and look were on point, the taste was just too bitter for me.  It left a nasty burned chocolate flavor in my mouth, wasn't a fan of it.  I'd be willing to try it on tap, but for now, it's a no go for me."
"Popping a bottle of Obsidian open, as with most beers, I first notice the head. It is thick but it's the color that's more notable, a kind of really light umber tone, capping the impenetrably black body. It's smooth and I noticed a relatively low amount of carbonation in my glass. The flavor is primarily roasted malts, with the usual notes of coffee and cocoa (more than a straight chocolate). As one reviewer noted, there is a bit of a char to the flavor, especially in the aftertaste. Overall, I can see this as an easy-drinking stout; it almost seems a bit too thin, but I do like its cleanliness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Served at 55-60 F in a tulip"
"Great stout !! More complex char to sweetness IMO. Gets better as it warms up. A great value on a readily available and high quality stout."
""
""
"Pours pitch black with dark brown edges. Thick and foamy light brown head dissipates quickly leaves nice lacing down the glass. Smells sweet roasted malts. Tastes dark roast coffee, mocha and dark roasted/burnt malts in the aftertaste with a little hoppy bitterness. Nice medium body."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  I am not a huge fan of stouts but enjoyed this one when included in a sampler pack, not something I'll seek out by itself but worth trying.  If you like the stout style this is one of the better examples for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid brew.  a friend brought me a six pack while on vacation.  I'd definitely buy another."
"O: A great baseline for stouts, and another great beer from Deschutes. It's not as special as The Abyss or Black Butte, but it's very good."
""
"Overall:  These guys win.  This is a stellar stout."
""
"it's just so smooth and tastes like it should be thicker smells like roasted malts and goes down so smooth, the appearance is spelled out in the name and I love seeing peoples eyes pop when they see it for the first time.  Cant have just one though...."

"Very good stout. Had it on nitro. Very smooth."
""
"Overall this is so far an impressive beer and one that offers an abundance of flavors and complexity along with an ABV (6.4%) that would easily allow having more than one.  It has definitely earned a place on my “have more in the future” list."

"This is an ultra black, thick brew.  Tan head with a decent lace.  Grain and a touch of smoke and coffee in the smell.  Firm bitterness in the taste. Some underlying thick smoothness. Bitter and powerful.  Excellent brew."

"O: Solid bold stout, though I wish it was a skoche less bitter and the chocolate and coffee notes were a bit more dominant. Still a very good brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste - Very strong roasted flavor.  It does have nice coffee flavor as well.  Lastly there is a small hint of chocolate but it was not very strong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this this an easy drinking stout; it goes down smoothly and does not leave a bitter aftertaste.  The lack of bitterness makes this an interesting stout; good if you don't like a bitter stout."
"Poured an opaque black (with slight chocolate hue in the light). Minimal head. Bitter aromas, roasted malt, bitter coffee, some light chocolate, and a hint of molasses. Tasted of coffee, roasted malt... balanced bitterness... tasted bigger than 6%. Medium mouthfeel, perfect for a regular stout (I prefer them a little meatier). Overall outstanding. UPDATE: It is even better on nitro. All of the great flavors, etc with a mouthfeel like chocolate milk. Amazing."

"Overall (4.02) : This is not my favorite Deschutes offering. It is definitely a good smokey stout with heavy char and dark notes. Long after the swallow the taste lies lingering on the palate with roasted coffee and light smoke. It is a worthy offering and should be tried if spotted."
""
""
"This is a great stout. Very bitter, but stays true to style. Well crafted and very enjoyable. Recommended."
"Overall (4.5): I ended up buying the Deschutes variety pack because i have been wanting to try this beer for a while now and have not seen it anywhere else. It did live up to my expectations, but considering my indulgence in RISs, it's not quite robust enough. Speaking of robust, this reminds me a lot of the Smuttynose Robust Porter. Still a great regular stout, and one of my favorites in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel : bitter is very light.. can drink a few  easily"
"Could drink a lot of these with no problem. Very similar to their Black Butte, which seemed a tad less bitter, but both are very good."

"Strong coffee flavor and hints of chocolate. Impressive stout."
""
""
""

"This might be one of the most perfect regular stouts I've ever head.  Smooth, creamy, roasted barley. Just a nice beer!"
""
""
""
"Rating: A-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deschutes makes a fine stout, and you should seek this one out if you like stouts.  I actually think their porter is slightly better, but I enjoy both.  This stout is a touch on the bitter side, but not as much as some, so I can still make it work.  Another success from this brewery."

"The beer pours a foamy brown head that takes a while to dissipate. The beer itself is an opaque and very dark brown color. The beer smell is a sweet dark chocolate with deeply roasted malts and cocoa. The beer taste is surprisingly different from the smell. The beer taste has a much stronger hop presence with a weaker Mexican dark chocolate and cocoa taste. The hop bitterness and chocolate mix rather well. The beer is heavy bodied, creamy, and thick. Overall, a pretty good stout and worth getting."

"Smell: Exceptional. Notes of caramel, malts, and hazelnut. Taste/mouthfeel: Exceptional as well. Roasted malts and espresso with a rich, smooth flavor overall. I prefer this beer chilled; as it warms, it tends to become more bitter. One of my favorite beers so far."
"Overall- definitely a good stout. I had somewhat of spicy/fruity undertone that wasn't my favorite, but it melds really well with the beer."

"Draft nitro into 5 oz sampler. Appearance is impenetrable black, beautiful rising head resembling a cappuccino. Aroma is dark roasted malt, coffee, subtle hops. Flavor is dark roasted malt, coffee, caramel, followed by bitter hops. Mouth feel is medium full, not font or bubbly (the nitro, I guess). Overall this is a really outstanding stout, noticeably richer in flavor than the bottled equivalent I have at home right now. Love it!"

"O - Excellent stout"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: in the debate of Stout vs Porter and contrasts and similarities of each, it appears that Deschutes has made the distinction between the two (their porter being their Black Butte) by making this beer certainly damn roasty and bitter while their porter highlights more of a dynamic cereal/cakey malt foundation and more pronounced chocolaty flavor... this stout, though, is an easy and safe sell to those who haven't had it - fantastic!"

"O: I never found Deschutes to be the most outspoken brewery around, and with beers like this, they don't have to be. Everything Deschutes has to say gets said as you take a sip of their brews, and Obsidian Stout is a perfect example of what Deschutes is all about. There's no gimmicks or arrogance here... just a divine stout from a company who knows how to brew legendary beer."
""
""
""

"This is a little on the weak side for a stout, especially one called Obsidian. Nevertheless, it's unique and drinkable."

"Ranked Obsidian the highest, with Barney Flats second, and SN Stout slightly behind in third."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor: Lots of chocolates sweet and bitter. Hops come as the beer warms. The alcohol wraps itself on the young along with a very smooth mouthfeel."
"Once again, a heavy-handed, aggro pour caused a pseudo-cascade as three-plus fingers of dense, deep-tan head formed with excellent retention and everything went on hold until it settled. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Obsidian, indeed! As the initial head settled, I continued my pour and now it looked like a muffin top protruding from the glass. Will this head ever subside? The nose smelled like Devil's Food cake - rich, chocolaty, slightly smoky, underlain by a coffee-like odor. It smelled like a birthday cake that I had when I was really young, like 5 y/o, chocolate with purple icing. Dig that! I was obsessed with purple when I was really young and my cake played into it. Mouthfeel was big, dense and creamy and the chocolate cake was having espresso as a chaser. Phew. You had better really like those kinds of intense flavors in combination with one another and since I am the king of intensity, it was right up my alley. Beautiful lacing began to form as I drank so I sat back and watched it do its thing while taking a contemplative moment for myself. Finish was exceptionally smooth. I had drank down almost half of it without a second thought. At 6.4% ABV, this would be a great beer to get people interested in the style who may be put off by dark-colored beers."

"12oz bottle with a Best Before date of 08/08/14. Pours a black color with a half inch of brown head. Some lacing. The aroma is chocolatey with some roasted malts, cola, and espresso. The taste is chocolate syrup, roasty malts, earth and espresso. More chocolate and espresso towards the end with a bitter, roasty espresso finish. Slightly thick mouthfeel with a good deal of carbonation. This is an easy drinking stout with lots of chocolate and espresso flavor. Overall, worth seeking out."

"Overall, this is an excellent session stout that beats the pants off of Guinness and comparable offerings. It's flavorful without becoming cloying (albeit not especially complex) and highly drinkable on account of the smooth, airy mouthfeel. I've not tried anything else by Deschutes thus far, but this was a good start."
""
""
""
""
"O: Strong in everything but aroma and taste. Even besides the meek nature of those components, the flavors just didn't stand out to me. A picture of it could be considered fine art, but beyond that, I have a few other favorite milk stouts to which I'll be returning instead."
""
"Poured from bottle into chilled pint glass. Deep, dark color with beautiful, thick, brown head which slowly dissipated to thin band of bubbles. Great retention and lacing. And the nose! Inviting scent of dark roasted chocolate portends something truly special. And yet, on the palate, the taste was startlingly thin and disappointing. I was expecting something much warmer and seductive, but instead found the taste to be bitter, thin, and sadly cheap (like somebody poured Miller Lite in my stout). Not sure I'll finish the six pack. Sniffle, sniffle..."

"Pours deep dark black with 1/4 inch light brown foam. Bubbles remain as it settles. Rich chocolate coffee nose. Taste is a delicious roasted blend of chocolate malt and espresso beans. Touch of sweetness. Fades into a hearty bitter. Smooth, dry, delicious."
""
""
""
"O - a real surprise, from a blind buy. Well made beer."
""

"The Obsidian Stout is quite nice. The beer poured an opaque black with ecru lacing that is leaving some lace. The scent carries roast, coffee and a touch of peat. The taste has caramel, chocolate, roast and coffee. The mouthfeel is medium un body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a great session stout. I will definitely keep this one on the radar screen."

"O> I'm rarely disappointed with beer from Deschutes and this beer is no exception. It is a good stout; very drinkable but also complex. Definitely one of the more hoppy stouts I have tried!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, reuslting in a smooth (2/3), somewhat foamy (1/3) mouthfeel that is suitable for the beer and the style. Ethanol not detectable. Closes dry, with heavy stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."

""
""

"O - Black as coal, Obsidian Stout is a gorgeous looking beer that has simple layers of roasted malt complexity in the aroma, transforming from sweet-ish to bitter in flavor, balanced by a sharp level of hops. Smooth and robust, this dark stout is a hefty beer to sip."

"This was a bottle poured into a stout glass. The appearance is superb! That nice dark ruby color with a mocha head just looks delicious. As far as the smell, it's certainly not bad but you definitely pick up plenty of alcohol, maybe a little coffee something along the lines of an Italian roast. The smell certainly isn't bad but would lead you to believe this beer might be harsh on the palate, but it's not. As far as the mouth-feel just perfect. Nice creamy, no serious carbonation and what is there works well. As far as taste, wow! It's all there, everything you'd expect. The first wave is some NOT so subtle barley, with some NOT so subtle malt but then some subtle dark chocolate and a slight punch of that Italian roast coffee. It all balances amazing with a relatively high alcohol content, so be careful. Just a remarkable Stout with amazing balance and exceptional ""craftsmanship"" or call it whatever you'd like...just very well done!"

"Medium body stout, on the edge of thin. Great color and consistency, definitely let it sit in your mouth for an extra moment.  Very good stout but it's missing that extra touch that would make it great.  You won't regret buying it but not sure if you'd take this one home to mom."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm really pleased with this beer. Hadn't tried it before but I will definitely be getting it again. Deschutes typically nails it but no ""easy A's"" here--the beer speaks for itself. Highly recommended."
""
"Pours a very dark brown hue which leaves a massive dimple laden rocky head lacing absolutely everywhere,the smell is dark roasty malts,barley and rich mocha,the feel is medium bodied and well carbonated with tastes of rich dark chocolate,roasty toasty malts,a herbal earthy hoppiness and finished with a chocolate bittersweetness and overall it's not bad and drinkable but nothing exuberant cheers."

"A deep inky black with just enough transparency to flash brown and red here and there, with some mocha-colored foam and an aroma of roasted barley, dark sugar, and hints of fruit and American hops (pine? But just a wee bit). Go slow with this one, it is intricate yet powerful. A sip reveals deep roasted flavors right out of the gate but there is a surprisingly clean crisp finish ... You expect this to hang there like some massive imperial and certainly the sweetness does accumulate, but there's more going on than just syrupy smoky malt. Strong acidic coffee, molasses, and dark chocolate flavors give this beer a classic stout character while some dark fruit raisin-type notes add complexity. Body is dextrinous and chewy but its easy to forget that this is a BIG beer, considering the crisp finish with aromatic hop echoes and just the right amount of sweet-sour persistence that most certainly pays off. Creamy and smooth, the alcohol lurks in there like a spectre, only the faintest hint of a boozy presence. Superb balance and carbonation level. Once you go Obsidian you may never go back."

"I moved to Portland OR metro area in 2003 and always loved how the pacific NW caters to stout lovers... I have drunk a lot of beer in my life (much of it bad), and though I always liked how the microbrew phenomena coincided with my achieving legal drinking age. Sadly, though, the Atlantic seaboard does not carry many dark beers, hence my equal love for IPAs... Back to the review... I'm not a beer geek, but I love well crafted things in general. Deschutes Brewing has always been great with balancing fine beer with mass production (except maybe for JubelAle) and obsidian stout has been at the top of my list for 10 years running. Equal layers of coffee, chocolate , with a slight tobacco and leathery sweetness (yes, I've tasted leather). The mouthfeel is like real maple syrup consistency with a whipped foam coffee aftertaste. Just bitter enough to remind you that bitter is a masculine taste profile. The beer is hearty like a bowl of chunky soup, without the chunks. It drinks likes meal. If you find this on nitro, get it, as it lightens the beer while adding richness. Second only to Alameda black bear on nitro, but tops on a regularly available beer of any kind. I have loved European beer for far longer, but have a difficult time justifying their cost when craft brewers like Deschutes keep it real! This is the best value of any stout on the market, folks. Enjoy it when you can."
"Overall, this is brilliant. I'm buying a six pack very soon."

"O: One of the best accessible stouts out there. This one has suffered a bit from age but still quite good. Wish Deschutes distributed out here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cappaccino appearance. Poured into the glass like sweet black oil. Leaving a nice looking coffee foam head. Doesnt have that ashtray aftertaste that so many stouts can have. Perfect  initial taste. Follows through with a medium roast flavor. It's a beautiful beer."
""
"Final Thoughts: Not my favorite of the style, but a good Stout for those looking for robust dark malt flavor. Would I drink it again? Sure, nitro-tap would probably be worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This seems like a pedestrian dark beer at first sip, but it grows on you. Extremely drinkable with a lot of fat malty flavors. I'll have to get a six of the bottles. This seems like a flavorful, easy to drink brew to have around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great looking stout. Especially impressive was the nice cap the head was reduced to. Like a cappuccino. Impressive nose with that nice, medium roasted coffee smell. I felt like the body could have been a bit more, well, ""stout."" It was a little too slick and thin for my liking. Though the carbonation was perfect. That aside a great American stout that would go well with most desserts. In my case a cake doughnut."
""
"Never had such an incredible mouthfeel fall so one dimensional. Aroma was muted and taste was off-set with a metallic taste, cold draft to even warmed up. Mehhh. Feels more like a porter or even pretty close to their Black Butte Porter. Sowwy!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Outstanding aroma and flavor having all of the dark malt notes of chocolate, coffee and a a touch of burnt bitterness along with some hops bitterness. It's fairly dry with and smooth. It's pretty evident why the beer has earned so many awards."

"overall just a good american stout. nothing too special, but easy drinking and tasty. bonus points for being lower in ABV but tasting just as good as any of the 10%ers. you wont be disappointed here."

"Overall, a very solid stout. Nothing fancy or exciting here, but everything you'd expect out of a good stout."

"Overall its good, would most definitely get again but not seek it out if I can't get it locally"
""

"Poured to a very nice deep, robust and rich creamy foamy head topping this very good roasted malt and black barley beer giving way to notes of coffee. A definite beer to buy again and enjoy. Very similiar to Guiness Foreign Extra but not quite the bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Summary - Pretty nice stout. I've liked some other stuff from Deschutes, but this is definitely now one of my favorites of theirs. Typically, I will enjoy a stout if it refrains from pounding me with its roasted-ness. This one has just the right amount to be enjoyable."
"O - Was very excited for this one. My first form Deschutes. Nose was huge! Taste a little below that. I would recommend to anyone, especially those who love a less smooth stout. Spot on with the bitterness and hops!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Ok, but the ashtray association was a little disconcerting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As I've alluded to, this is the gold standard of stouts as far as I'm concerned. I'm only out west for the summer, but I already know that I'm gonna grab a few sixers of these babies for when I'm back on the other side of the Mississippi. A spicy, strong entry to the stout canon. Altogether familiar and yet like nothing you've ever had before. A triumph."
""
"O: What a delight! this is a rich and thoughtful beer, worth a taste. Its the kind of stout you could easily make a session of."
""

"Pours out to a creamy beige head and deep ruby black color. Aroma is smoky, roasty, espresso-like with hints of vanilla and earthy hops. Flavor is roasted barley, toasted malts, vanilla esters and a balance of hop flavors and bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium heavy with creamy nitro goodness. Top notch stuff. Must have again. I was about to give up on stouts until Obsidian arrived at the table."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid stout all the way around."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very well balanced beer for the most part. The malt and charred qualities sort of overtook the nuance, but the overall effect is still rather good. Great brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fantastic stout. I am only upset that it took this long for me to figure it out."
"Overall - An excellent stout, though it's not too far off from their Black Butte in terms of flavor. This one's a little darker, but the basic flavor profile is there. A classic example in every sense of the way. If there's one gripe I have, and it's a small one, it's that the sweetness can get a touch cloying when drinking this beer too fast; a virtual catch 22, because this beer is so enjoyable, it's hard not to want to take drink after drink in quick succession."
""
"Well. I did NOT expect this from a non-imperial stout. It basically has the flavor of an imperial stout, sans the high ABV. If there are any lovers of imperial stouts out there who are skeptial of a regular stout's capacity to sufficiently satisfy their selachian and senual cravings for scrumptious stouts... YOU MUST TRY THIS NOW... or I will annihilate you with my aggravating alliterative abilities. The label on the neck of the bottle reads ""Give in to the deep, dark spell as the layers unfold," and ""Like the plot of some eerie mystery you can't put down."" (Haha, I love it.) Anyway, the layers did unfold. I gave in. And I couldn't put it down... because this stout treated me to one HELL of a mind-blowingly pleasant experience."
""
""
""
"O - A complex and tasty stout. Would prefer a little less bitterness, but overall, very enjoyable. Will definitely drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body on this is surprisingly light. This is one better stouts (non Imperial) I have had. The flavor is really spot on and really nice and roasty. The issue for me is the lighter body. I wish it was more creamy and luscious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A excellent, robust stout."
""
"O: not a stout to mess with. Big flavor and a welcome respite during my cross country travel."
""
""
""
""
"I've had a fair number of beers in the overall ""stout"" umbrella, but not many of the standard American variety. I can only imagine this is the standard-bearer for the style, as it's quite tasty."
""
"This packs some pretty bold and complex flavors with a relatively low abv. I don't notice any adverse effects from consuming it ""out of date"". A fine job by Deschutes, I'd happily drink this again sometime."
"Quite possibly one of the best standard stouts on the West Coast... Deschutes pretty much goes to the basics and still creates a fascinating and flavorful product in the process. It's dry, earthy, very much on the barley side, but also has a touch of sweetness, chocolate, and hoppiness that really keeps everything balanced. It does this all without being too heavy. I do enjoy Black Butte more for it's extra hop and more complex malt profile, but this is definitely an excellent beer. I really want to try this on nitro-tap. In a way, a great ode to Irish dry stouts with a West Coast twist!"
""
""
""
"update 7/19 - note to self - when chilled more that usual, picks up a smokiness i hadn't see before . . . but it mostly goes away as it warms and the obsidian comes to life"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a very ""session-able"" stout, something I could keep drinking all day and not get sick of. This was also the first time I've had Deschutes here in PA and I'll keep looking for more."
""
""
"Overall, this has to be one of the best stouts EVER! It's definitely NOT a crossover beer and if you don't like dry and bitter beers you may not like this one, but keep in mind that this is an excellent beer all around and you might be missing out if you think that it may be too bitter for you. You may actually like it! I love it! 5 out of 5!"
""
""
"O - A very impressive, memorable stout. The flavor profile is balanced and is a text book example of what a stout should be. But the mouthfeel - it's incredible."
""
""
""
"Overall - a world class stout."
""
""
"D: a very well-made American stout. lots of dark aroma, however a bit one-note on the flavor end. not that it is a bad flavor so you are not gonna catch a lot flack from me. if you like stouts, definitely check this brew out."

"this is a terrific stout. a rich aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, and toffee. The first flavor is a nice rich coffee combined with unsweetened chocolate followed by a nice slightly yeasted roasted malt taste that stays with you long after you swallow. Rich, smooth, thick mouthfeel. Leaves a velvety feel on the tongue."

"overall an american stout that brings it all to the table. this may be the quintessential example of domestic stout brewing. good stuff here and definitley recommended."
""
"O - This stout has some excellent flavor and a surprising amount of hop in the taste that I was not able to pick up on at first through the smell. For the price its a wonderful stout which may become a regular."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Another beer from Deschutes that has astounded me. I wish I had access to their beers outside of trades. This is an almost perfect stout."
""
""
""
"I like this one. I haven't been in the mood for stouts lately but I've been waiting for this one to make it to my local beer store and had to try it. I would get it again, but probably in the fall or winter. It's a pretty stout stout and would be perfect with some roast beef or even turkey."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Awesome take on the American stout style by Deschutes. This is basically Black Butte on steroids- more flavour, even blacker and did I say more flavour? The flavour from the roast malt, which is what I love about Black Butte, is even more intense here. The hoppiness is also higher as well. I have to say that the other big difference is that Obsidian brings a bigger bitter quotient, as evidenced in the earthy bitterness that I don't notice much of at all in Black Butte. It also leaves a dry finish, whereas Black Butte will quench my thirst if I'm feeling thirsty. I really love this beer and I'm going to grab a sixer or two every time I return to Minnesota. I haven't seen this in Illinois yet, but once it shows up there, I won't return to Wisconsin without it. One of the finest examples of an intense, hoppy American stout that I've had! (4.5)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A really great balanced stout with huge flavors, highly drinkable, great mouthfeel, and like all Deschutes six packs an incredible value."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When looking for a beer that is heavy and will keep you warm, this is one of the best. Dark with sweet hints, but not sickly. The carbonation is well used to make the beer go down a little easier than with an extremely heavy stout. Tasting notes are pretty typical of a stout, but it seems to pour well, and drink better than most."

"O: After going to GABF I had to bring back some beers that aren't found round these here parts.. This was one and boy howdy did I pick a winner. Of the endless amount of stouts around these days its hard to stand out, but this one did it for me. My top pick so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A mild malty aroma jumped from the blackness of this bottle, after it was poured into a glass. In the initial taste, one detects dark chocolate, coffee, and a slight metallic taste. Being a little thinner than I would have expected for a stout, the heavier tastes disappeared with the metallic taste being more apparent. There was a certain degree of milkiness in this stout, but it lacked smoothness. It certainly lacked any measure of sweetness. In a sense, it made me think of instant coffee without the grittiness. A bitter coffee aftertaste finished the experience. In the scope of other stout, I am not sure anything stood out about this one."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinks smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Definitely a great non-imperial stout that I doubt you'd find a much better regular american stout. I tend to taste more metallic flavors in stouts which can make many of them unenjoyably, this one only really had it on the nose. Luckily for me it's always available for $7-9 a six pack. If you enjoy this make sure to check out Black Butte Porter as well."
""
""

"O: Solid, affordable stout. Good for taking a break from big RIS and DIPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid offering from one of my favorite breweries. I would certainly buy another six-pack."
""
""
"Amazing stout, makes me wish we got Deschutes here in New York."
""
""
"O - I am a Deschutes fan so dont think im putting this down, but it isnt good enough to be top 250 in my opinion. What I think it is: A readily available, approachable stout with more care and thought put into it than the Big Irish we have over here..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A real nice beer overall. Subtle yet complex nose and flavor with a body that makes this one pretty drinkable. I'd definitely revisit this one."
"A good beer, a lot of flavor for a non imperial stout, not as sweet and roasty as some but I like stouts that differ from the norm!"
""
""
""
""
"The beer is opaque, dark brown nearing black. The beige head is thick and massive, coating the glass with a thick sheet of lacing as it slowly recedes. The aroma really inviting dark roast, coffee, chocolate. Ooh. I can already see why this is so highly rated. The flavor brings a heavy dose of roast with a splash of coffee. The finish brings a hop bitterness that melds beautifully with the charred roast character. Long lasting aftertaste. A solid beer. If this were in my market, I would keep it around all year."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a tasty, solid brew...but in the end it's kind of forgettable. Nothing particular to make it stand out. Still, if this were available at the local bottle shop, I'd probably buy a six-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- one of the best American stouts that I've had. It has the flavors of a DIPA, with amazing roasted chocolate flavors. It's going to be a sad day when I run out of the 6 of these I traded for."
""
""
""
"O - Perfectly balanced and simple, but right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's just about everything I ever wanted in a stout."

"Overall - A well-crafted and flavourful stout from Deschutes. I really enjoyed the bitterness from the espresso/coffee bean and it makes this brew a real stand-out."
""
"From notes, 7/16/11. This is such a tasty stout. It’s got a big, rich combination of roast, chocolate and coffee, all backed up by some caramel. The body is creamy and smooth. It’s fairly bitter, which helps tone down the malt sweetness. Black body with a mocha head. Bubbles stick all over the glass prettily. It drinks easily, despite all of the flavor. Good stuff. Edit: Tried from a nitro tap. Excellent beer for nitro. Smooth and creamy. Not quite as much flavor, though."

"Yes, this stout has always been one of my favorites from years ago. It's been a while since I've sampled any (there are just too, too many different beer styles and breweries available to me in Colorado Springs - oh, the shame, the shame...), but this latest version still sits well with me. It's well made, nicely balanced, with a quiet yet deep complexity that brings delight with each sip."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, not bad, but not terribly good either. Seems pretty mediocre, and I dont really see why the ratings are so high. Ive had a number of American standard stouts significantly better than this one. Its not bad, but its just slightly above average in my book."
""
""
""

"Pretty disappointed in this beer, given the exceptional ratings. Very coffee-forward, bitter, and acrid, roasty, but lacking in chocolate and malt complexity. Substantial phenols. Pretty harsh. The more it warms, the more I like it, but still expected more. Leave it sit out for a good half hour."
""
""
"M: perhaps some of the creaminess of a stout with the head, but definitely that thicker feeling that I get from other stouts."
""
""
"This beer had that classic familiarity of a Guinness (have had it in Dublin!), but is also it's own unique interpretation of a classic stout. It is incredibly bold and robust, even more so than the aforementioned standard, but it is all woven expertly into this beer. It doesn't feel as heavy going down as most stouts, an extremely endearing quality. Can't imagine a stout that would surpass it!"

"O: Great Example of this style. A lot of flavor for its size (abv) and easy to drink. This is a common beer seen on nitro, which I dislike, since it is drinkable and smooth on its own. In my opinion it does not need the nitro to achieve its smoothness and drinkability since it already is easy to drink and smooth. But regardless of my nitro rant, this is a must have if you are an American Stout fan, which you should be... Deschutes Obsitian, a classic."
"Fits nicely with the milder porter and this stout as two excellent dark beers. I prefer the porter, but this a great beer in its own right."

"O- A decent stout that I enjoyed drinking but nothing that stood out too much. A tad bit too roasty, overcarbonated, and velvety on the feel for my liking. Looked fantastic when pouring. Overall a decent stout that was definitely above average, but there are plenty that I would take over this. I would recommend trying it out especially if you like a lot of roast."
""
"Beautiful chocolate covered espresso beans from start to finish on this one. Actually, its the opposite, it's like a gob of chocolate covered in powdered espresso beans, because you get the espresso first. Lighter body than I expected, and higher carbonation than expected. Overall a very nice beer, and strangely refreshing."
""
"O- one of the best regular stouts I've had. No barrel aging, no vanilla, no extra bells and whistles. Just a superb example of beer that doesn't need to be limited to be great."
""
""

"Regardless of what I say this is a world class brew, just not my personal favorite. This is a black brew of deep strong black flavor that is well balanced. So what goes with this stout. Something strong black bold. James Brown - Live at the Apollo. Please Please Please! This is something that is inherent to black. Something white guys can't do."
""
"Poured this 12 oz stout from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured dark black, produced a huge thick tan head, excellent retention and off the charts lacing left on the glass. The aroma of this stout consists of roasted barley,and milk chocolate. Full bodied, the mouthfeel of this stout is creamy and smooth. Sweet up front, the sweetness moves to roasted barley, coffee and milk chocolate that gives way to a bitter hop finish. This is one of the best Stout's I have tried. This is a must. Great Session beer."
""
"I can't recall the last time I took such small sips and kept each sip in my mouth for so long. I'll be revisiting this beer."

"O: This is just another great beer from Deschutes. I drink their beer all the time and this is for sure one of the tops."
"O: A good stout. A lot of roasted flavor but still very easy drinking. A stout good for winter or summer."
"Taste starts off dark roasted malts along with dark bitter chocolate. I'm getting espresso though out the taste. A little hint of dark fruit. Burnt caramel towards the end of the palate. Roasted, slight dry finish. Medium-heavy bodied, carbonation is moderate."
"This is my new favorite. I work in a grocery store that sells alot of beer and this is the best I've tried. I like to drink it in tandem with a hot cup of strong coffee. I'm giving it a 4 only because there are alot of stouts I haven't experienced. But out of all the generallly available ie grocery store stouts and porters, this is the best. Black Butte porter a close second. Way better than Monkey Face, Pipeline, Guinness black Etc."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: overall, this is my 1st Deschutes offering. I thought it was a nice beer all the way around. I was definitely hoping for more creaminess or a vanilla finish because of such a strong espresso taste, but regardless, this is a nice beer all the way around."
""
"Appears opaque, deep brown/black with generous dark brown head. Nice retention. Aroma features pronounced roasted barley along with dark chocolate, coffee, and mild hop character on the back end. Taste is bold and robust with dry notes of roasted barley, bitter dark chocolate, and a snappy bitter finish. This brew is nicely balanced and intensely roasted. Mouthfeel is moderate with appropriate level of carbonation. This is a nice every day 6 pack brew with tons of flavor."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a Chimay chalice."
""
"O - Highly bitter and a total let down in my books. After sampling the Butte Porter and the Abyss I had very high hopes for this one. It just did not live up to the hype and I would be hard pressed to ever revisit it."
"Pretty good. Served a little cold with a smallish taan head and a bit of lace. Color is an opaque black brown. Aroma is roast, malt, molasses, licorice, bit of honey and dark ripe fruit. Flavor's like nose, muted, fairly dry, toast, carbonic tang, and bitter up front, in fact it's all up front. Body is great, ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, a bit long, and also a bit boozy. Good drinkin' stout."

"This is a nice dark stout that simply puts an end to all light trying to pass through it. Thankfully, the light at the end of the tunnel is near, or should I say the light on top the beer is near (neer). By light I mean head, yes is topped off with a really nice and thick light brown head, just a few shades lighter than brown sugar. It looks and feels light and fluffy and it slowly thins out into a layer of brown bubbles and thick wall of brown lace. The aroma itself isn’t all that impressive to me, I can pick up hints of chocolate, mild coffee, roasted coffee bean followed by that slightly tart coffee aroma. Now for the fun part, relatively light on the mouth feel and it thickens up to about a medium body when it hits the back of your mouth. Bitter overall, it’s sharp on the tip of your tongue but I can’t pick up much flavor until it starts reaching the back of my mouth, only then can I pick up some coffee grinds, mild cocoa, roasted almonds and a slight toffee flavor too. You know what; throw in some orange zest too…"

"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with modest carbonation."

"Overall- Superb stout here. Absolutely fantastic"

"Overall: This is a nice change of pace stout for me. Slightly hoppy and roasted goodness through and through. Low abv makes this easy to drink and that is apparent as my glass is nearing empty and only after about 10 minutes."

"Fantastic Stout. One of the best I’ve had in this style. Lovely cocoa notes with additional complexity underneath. Not too big, so it is relatively easy to drink. A real treat. Hopefully some day Deschutes will start distributing out to these parts and I can get this on the regular."

"O-a delicious stout with great flavor and balance and a great price, a great value"
"O: Pretty good. A bit light-bodied, and the flavor's a bit light as well."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best by date if 9/12/12. This pours a pitch black color with a massive Mocha colored head which has a long retention and leaves a lacing. The smells are of Mocha, dark chocolate, dark roasted malts, some hops, excellent. The feel is medium to thick. The taste is amazing, like a bitter mouthful of good espresso, dark chocolate, nice hop bite, this is the best stout which isn't an irs."

"O-A wonderfully made stout with tons of flavor delivered at a great price. Deschutes has to be in my top 5 breweries in the US, they knock every dark beer they make out of the park."
"Pours dark black with brown head.. smells sweet and chocalatey. Taste chocolatey with a little coffee, a little boozy.Mouthfeel is thick, heavy, with low carbonation. overall its good, but there are a few better stouts out there, this is one of the better american stouts ive had..."
""
""
"Overall - One of the better stouts I've had so far and a must try for any fans of the style. I'd drink a ton of this stuff if it was available to me locally. Probably the best Deschutes beer I've had to date."

"I think I'll step out and say that this is the first time I've had a stout off of a nitro line that was this good. Spicy almost oat tones on this one. Very hearty, yet not overly thick malt tones that make up the backbone of this stout. Very consistent and very well executed. This should be a standard for stouts."

"O: An very good all-around stout that gets better and more layered as it warms up."

"Overall this is well deserving of such a high score. I can't get over how good this stout is. It's very well balanced. Probably my new favorite stout. Perfection."

"Favorite beers (for comparison, after all taste preferences are subjective): Elysian's Daedalus Irish Stout, Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar, Allagash's White Ale, New Belgium's 1554, Full Sail's Wassail, etc. Beers I don't like: IPAs (with few exceptions)"

"Overall, what a stout. Extremely complex and balanced, bringing flavor from many places. The wheat malt was genius, I would have never thought to put that in a stout, but it works beautifully with the charcoal roasted notes. A real winner, I cannot think of a better year-round offering available in my state."

"O- What can I say? Deschutes always treats me right."

"one of the best stouts out, period. pours the thickest creamiest black coffe color with a frothy mocha head an inch and a half tall. milkshake texture. smells rich and roasty, and even a little bitter. flavor is great, some deep espresso notes, but nothing overpowering. again a slight bitterness in the finish. mouthfeel is gold, thick and creamy without being heavy. this is extremely sessionable. everything is in perfect poportion here, i imagine the nitrotap makes this one even better than its bottled version. silky buttery glory on this stout. as good as it gets"
""
"O- perfect. What more can you ask for in a stout? $8 for a six pack of a perfectly balanced and drinkable stout. Not flashy, just consistently good and sessionable."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a thumbs width brown, creamy head. Nice lacing to it. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, and some dark fruit. A pretty damn awesome strong and bitter roasted coffee flavor is the first to introduce itself, this is followed by some bittersweet chocolate and liquorice. Underneath the entire sip is a vanilla like sweetness that I didn't at first detect. A nice, bitter flavor lingers in the aftertaste. A nice, creamy body to this. I slacked on giving this one a try for the longest time and realize that this was a mistake. This is a great stout and worth all the love it receives."

""
"This has to be my favorite stout."
""
""

""

""

"M- medium bodied. One of the best all time stouts. A must try. Completely embodies what a stout should be."
"Opens with rich, roasted malts and bitter-sweet chocolate. Hints of caramel, molasses and burnt toast emerge. Velvety-smooth mouthfeel. French Roast coffee moves to the forefront, followed by suggestions of licorice and oatmeal. All of these rich and roasted complexities are artfully balanced with a touch of hop bitterness. Finishes powder dry. Obsidian Stout is an approachable sipper and the perfect nightcap."
""
"Poured from 12oz glass into pint glass. Opaque black pour along with a dark brown head atop that cakes a bit, laces decently and stays fairly large. Aromas are roasty and creamy, strange, almost sweetened lactose in there. Moving into roast and creamy silky chocolate, coffee, soda bread, and toast. Some caramel, toffee. Rich roast and sweetness. Initial is medium bodied, perhaps a bit fuller as some roasty malts come to the forefront, burnt coffee grounds, some caramel, toffee, dark cocoa and some more burnt roasty grains. Moves into sweet toffee and caramel, to temper the roast. A touch dry finish, moving into lingering roast and silky sweet malts of cocoa, toffee, and milky chocolate. A bit too sweet even though it is fairly balanced and full, just not complex enough for me."
"My first impression of Obsidian was 'baby Abyss'. What a nice looking beer. Great lacing, great head, dark as hell, and tastes amazing. Molasses, some licorice on the finish, and coffee somehow/somewhere. Does this have coffee in it? I don't know but I really get that impression, and I love it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Probably my favorite beer at the moment. I don't think I could pass this up if it was on the menu."
""
"Obsidian Stout can be considered a hidden treasure. At $8 for a six pack, this beer is inexpensive, widely available, and spot on for the style of an American stout. For this review, I was served on nitro-tap from a local bar in San Francisco's North Beach. This beer is a delight start to finish with lasting chocolate and coffee flavors, a creamy, delicate mouthfeel (partly due to the nitro), and overall a balance of alcohol and stouty flavors that leaves little to be desired. While not extremely complex or fancy, this beer is enjoyable on a special level."
""
""
""
"Overall, I think I was expecting more of this one, but delightful enough. Just no.... bang!"
""
"Overall it's an excellent stout. Picked up a Black Butte XXIII with the Obsidian six pack. Really looking forward to it but that one's gonna age for a bit."

"12 ounce bottle, best by 05/27/12. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stayed around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is good and malty, the brew smells like roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and charred/burnt malt. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, with the roasty/charred bitter flavors being the strongest. There's also some light hops noticeable, along with a roasty/ashy bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little creamy and has moderate carbonation. It also goes down easy enough. I think this is a good brew, definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Heavy mouthfeel...chewy. Definitely best saved for the end of a session. Overall a good representation of the style, and quite enjoyable. Recommended."
""
"Cost: $8.99 for a six pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It is okay, but not an every day beer. I would go for one late in the evening after having a few other brews as the thick feel would cause me to sip as opposed to drink it down."
""
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the darkness of the malts, with their smoke and char. They execute this without going overboard and overpowering the palate. Additionally, the appearance and aromas are warmly inviting, while the remaining aspects of the drink hold up nicely to the established expectations from the start."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours an opaque black with tan head and lacing. Aroma is coffee, chocolate, and burnt toffee. Taste is espresso, dark chocolate, and smokey roasted malt with nice hop bite. Creamy mouthfeel with dry finish. An outstanding American Stout, complex and flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O- Highly drinkable. First time having this Deschutes offering, I've been missing out. Thanks ruizjoseph for the long time want!"
""
"The Obsidian had an incredible black color to it. The head was even a dark brown color. The head didn't stick around for long. The scent was a smoky wood blend, with faint touches of smoky floral and a malt roast. The initial taste was very flavorful, and then I was hit by a strong smoky aftertaste. The aftertaste was so strong I could still feel it in my nose afterward. Probably one of my favorite stouts."
"I love this stout..could be my favorite stout I have had."
""
"Deschutes Obsidian Stout: Continuing my sampling of dark beers, and moving from Porters to Stouts, I begin the stout segment with the Deschutes Obsidian Stout. This beer is as black in color as beer can be. The head was nearly brown, nice and fluffy, but did fade away early on. There is a smoky, roast malt aroma, but it is not as strong as I would have expected. Flavor is intense roast malt, smoke and has a bitter rasp on the finish. Big long aftertaste. I can drink Guinness all day, I enjoy a porter now and then, but American Stouts are just a bit too much beer for me. I give the Obsidian a good rating in a style of beer I have yet to grow into."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a fantastic stout that I will seek out again."
"Pours a black color. 3/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, alcohol, sweet malt, slight spice, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of an American Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, coffee, sweet malt, slight dry hop, and slight alcohol. Overall, good appearance, aroma, blend, and body."
""
""
""
""
"O: All in all, this is a decent beer. If the carbonation were toned down some, this would be a great beer. The over-carbonation on this one kind of takes a few points away for me. Try if you like easy drinking stouts."
""
"O: A very satisfying stout, airing towards an imperial. I'll stick to the Green Flash double, but this one comes in at a not too distant second."
"o - overall great stout. classic to style. wish this was local as i'd have it regularly."

"Overall a great example of an American Stout that hasn't gone overboard. Rich and robust for a 6.4% beer. A more sessionable stout @ 6.4%."
"O: Its a very good stout, but it is definitely on the bitter side."
"This is a really great stout. While only 6.4% a.b.v., it has a more in common with an imperial stout than a single in terms of appearance, flavor, and feel. Very full, creamy flavor and feel. Delicious."
"O - A good straight forward American Stout."
"Overall- Very solid Stout. Easy to find and good price point. 4/5"
"Overall: I'd been wanting to try this one for a while, so this was a treat. Nothing bad to say about this brew, and I'll definitely be buying more once Deschutes (hopefully) expands distribution to Indiana over the next year! I recommend you try Obsidian as well."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch tan head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Random dots and streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate chip cookie dough. Taste is of roasted malt, coffee beans, and the chocolate chip cookie dough flavors. A very mild roasty and sweet flavor lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout that is very tasty and easy to drink."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer a lot. A beer that wanted only to be sipped, yet left me thinking about having another."
"Overall it is a good stout, but nothing that I would get excited about finding again. For some reason this comes off as a lighter stout, despite its bitterness and abv. It is worth noting that this is a dangerously drinkable beer at 6.4%"
"This was already an extremely well done American Stout in my eyes to begin with but here on nitro @ the Portland Brewpub, it was just heavenly. The smoothness and richness of the flavors in this glass just did it for me and I wouldn’t hesitate for an instant to try it again this way. What a treat!"
"This is as good as its billing. Flavorful, attractive and drinkable."
"Drinkability – This is a very drinkable beer. My wife drank my entire bottle as I was trying to review it, and I had to pour another for myself. Goes down really easy. I agree with the Bros - I rate this higher than The Abyss."
"pretty damn good stout that I would drink a LOT of if it were available around here. very easy drinking and pretty flavorful."
"O- nice medium percent ABV stout. I wouldnt mind a few more of these"
"For the rest i can say this is a good beer, no more no less. There is a nice coffee like laste and smell and the feel is a bit too thin, more alcohol would boost this one into the A+ league."
"My second from the folks at Deschutes, and there proving to be a worthy brewery in my opinion."
"On the lighter end in body and above average in carbonation. Overall, if this beer could achieve a bit more of a charred character to counteract the grape roastiness, this might be a real gem. As is, it’s a pleasant reminder of good time passed and an enjoyable trip down memory lane."
"O - Damn fine stuff I must say. Ranks up there with the best. Hopefully they start distributing this stuff down my way."
"Given that this beer's sister, Black Butte porter, has the highest ranking of all the beers I've reviewed this far, I had high expectations for this beer. They were met. While obsidian doesn't push the envelope too much and the mouthfeel can't quite match Black Butte, it is one hell of a beer. Despite being over two years old, this stout remained delicious and had substantial head retention and lacing. At around $6.50 for a sixth of this in Oregon, it is the perfect camping beer during my annual northwest roadtrip and the geologist in me can't help but love the name."
"drinkability: superb.... a new fav of mine. a perfect exmaple of an american stout"
"Randall"
"O- Being from Oregon i drank this beer a many times. Now that i got a hold of some years later when i have had the opportunity to try more complex stouts i would say it was a little disappointing. Although still a great beer just not as good as i remember."
"Poured a pitch black with a frothy, chocolate head. The head floated on top of the beer for a very long time. Great lacing left around the sides of the glass. Smell notes of strong espresso, chocolate, and roasted malts. Wow....great coffee taste, Hersey Kiss flavored chocolate, with a backbone of peanut butter. Mouthful is crisp, carbonation is spot on, but the beer seems to be a little on the thin side, but every other aspect of the beer makes up for it. Overall an amazing American Stout. Can't remember who sent this as an extra, but I owe them one! It is a shame we can't purchase Deschutes around here or this would be a staple beer in the fridge."
"Overall, a nice, semi-dry flavorful stout that I would by again."
"A very nice stout from Deschutes here. Not too sweet and not too bitter, very well balanced. A good choice if you're looking for something a little higher octane than Guinness but don't want to go the imperial route."
"O - An excellent stout. Maybe too much hop presence for some, but it worked for me."
"O - The only downside to Obsidian is the slightly overpowering bitterness. Everything else is pretty close to perfect!"
"Yet another reason why I wish Deschutes would extend distribution to the East coast. A solid stout that I would recommend to anyone. I would definitely drink this all the time if it were availble.."
"Overall – A nice stout for sure. Deschutes is just a fantastic brewery and I can’t believe I haven’t reviewed this in the past."
"OVERALL: This is a great beer that has held up really, really well. Still very flavorful with a good feel, and looks wonderful for the style. One I’d love to have fresh. Thanks for doing the legwork on this one guys."
"One of my favorite everyday-type beers."
"Overall this is a very nice beer. However, for a stout, as I said before, it is almost too bitter (for me). I am sure others have and will love it."
"O- Somewhat disappointing. I expected more. It has the potential to be solid but comes up short in my mind. Maybe my expectations were just too high... I really don't think the beer sports the ABV"
"O – This is the best stout that money can buy. At something like $7 for a 6-pack it probably will become one of my go to stouts."
"O: A near perfect everyday stout and a wonderful beer. Can't honestly see improving this one without barrel aging or something of the like."
"I can't remember the last time I picked up an American or Irish Dry Stout, but after this bottle I may have to rectify that. This was a very pleasant surprise, a beer that was totally off of my radar that I'm thinking about days later."
"Overall: Probably one of if not the best readily available stouts on the market. Great flavor great drinkability and is completely enjoyable on all levels"
"Haven't had this since Philly Beer Week. Just as good as I remembered it being. Starts off with a fingers width crown that quickly dissipates while leaving more than enough evidence of it's former presence. Chocolat, toffee nose. Nice smoothe mouthfeel with the usual suspects regarding flavors you'd expect from this type of stout. A fine example of what makes Deschutes a premier stout brewer."
"O- this is an excellent example of the american stout. this is one that i would buy often if it were available to me. something to check out for anyone that loves stouts."
"Overall this is a stout that lives up to the hype - not many details to recall however I would recommend and buy again and again."
"this is an excellent beer. Strong in flavor and aroma. The smokey aroma prepares the drinker for what is to come. The dark head full head and dark color let you know that their is a high level of carbonation. The roasted malts and full body satisfy the drinker requiring a strong beer that will withstand some heavy blue cheeses on a Kobe beef hamburger. Had it at the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival."
"O - Another great offering from Deschutes."
" O: Impressive and very worthy of try. Nice job Deschutes!"
"My favorite year-round release from Deschutes thus far! A very enjoyable stout at a great price!"
"O- a great stout that is very smooth and easy to drink..top notch"
" I am not a big stout drinker. I was at one time, but that faded quickly. I find most stouts to be rather heavy, and this is not one of them. Easy to drink a couple, and not be fighting the stout after taste."
"I wish I would have reviewed this beer the first time I had it. It was at a beer tasting on a nitro tap. All I remember is that it was amazing. This is the first time I have had it in a bottle. It is a top notch stout and exactly what I would expect from one. Great after taste that does not linger to long."
"O: A great stout and very surprising how heavy it felt with such a low ABV."
"Deep brown to black in color. Poured with a frothy, steady, longlasting beige head that leaves huge, thick sheets of lacings on the glass. Mellow chocolate and roasted malt aromas. Velvety smooth, with a delicate feel, but at the same time a bit thick. Sweet chocolate and roasted malt flavors up front and into the middle. Bitter hops begin to show thru in the middle as the raosted malt flavor deepens to a nearly burnt flavor, but never actully gets there. Dark roasted malt flavors, with a hint of coffee through to the finish. Finished semi-dry with roasty, bitter hop aftertaste."
"Serving type: bottle. This is one gem that I fell lucky to find in most stores. Great little 6 pack at a good price."
"O- Despite the lack of aroma in this thing it is definitely better to drink. I'd certainly have this again and perhaps like to try from the bottle to see if the nose is any better."
"i don't get to try stouts that are not imperial very often. this is a pretty good everyday stout. i really liked it, and at 6.4% ABV, it's certainly more feasible to drink a lot of it than say.. bell's expedition stout. the espresso taste went to the core."
"Poured into a pint glass jet black with a small, dense, tan nitro head. Very clean aroma, infused with espresso and roasty malts. Roasty, roasty taste, coffee, dark chocoate, more roastiness, almost burnt, but not quite. Silky and uh, roasty, with a coffee-bitter dry finish. Full body and quite drinkable."
"O: Excellent ""everyday"" stout."
"Overall this is a great example of an american stout. It is flavor full plus it is easy to find in the nw. Possibly deschutes best offering."
"Smell-wise, it's rather standard with hints of chocolate and coffee. It tastes like stouts of similar quality; the thing that sets it apart are the body and creaminess. A definite advantage I had, even here in Colorado, was getting served on nitro (thank you Taps, in Fort Collins)."
"O: A well-done, not over-the-top stout. Doesn't knock your socks off but this is a solid year-round offering. At 6.4% ABV and $6-7 for a six-pack here in Portland it is a heck of a deal. I tell myself to buy this more often because it's a very economical buy while still being consistently well made (and enjoyable, most importantly). I have had this a countless number of times, including nitro-tap."
"Came into this re-review thinking I was overly impressed as this was my first stout period. But... It's just a great beer. Can't say much else."
"O: Wow. I haven't had this in probably four years, and I must say that it is better than I remembered. Overall, a nice refreshing stout. Not extreme in any way, but all around enjoyable. Considering the price, this will once again make its way to my fridge fairly often."
"O- Very drinkable, best stout I've ever had, easily."
"O: Really enjoyed this one. Solid flavors, live the milk chocolate. Easy drinking. Need more Deschutes!"
"This is one awesome brew."
"This has good flavor. It is very smooth without being watery."
"Overall I am craving grilled meats with this beer like crazy and I can just pick the carbon out of my teeth with it too. It just goes to show for me that this brewery hardly ever disappoints me."
"Over the years I have waffled over what I considered Deschutes's greatest strength as a brewer: they make a lot of good pale ales, yet their Black Butte porter is the very archetype of its style, for those that have access to it. The fact that such a brewery can also brew an export stout that is so similar in some ways to the porter, yet make each product stand apart from the other when it counts, is testament to the exceeding mastery possessed over the porter-styles in general (and perhaps an even greater harbinger than is the appeal and popularity of their more limited imperials, such as The Abyss.) In the end, I refuse to be swayed in my opinion one way or the other."
"D: Drinkable for sure, but not one I would choose to have a lot of. But I just bumped it up when I noticed I drank pretty much the whole thing in twenty minutes."
"O - Really enjoyed this stout. Easy to drink, perfect example of an American stout. Would like a 6 of this!"
"CHEERS!!"
"Overll: One of my favorite beers , not as mellow as the average stout type. Brings a certain character and quallity you come to expect from most of the deschutes line"
"Overall, this beer is a good, easily accessible stout. The only problem I had with this beer is I feel the roasted malt flavor overshadowed some other interesting characteristics."
"Overall, a great example of what an American stout can taste lime. A great sessionable stout that I am privleged to try"
"O:"
"This is a fantastic stout that is complex yet drinkable, dark yet not overtaken by roasted flavor. Well done."
"Medium bodied, quite approachable and pleasantly satisfying. Simply one of those beers that is hard to fault - not that I'm trying to fault it, it's just a great beer without being mind-blowing. Which in itself is kind of refreshing."
"It was pretty darn good but just a little to bitter for my liking. But a god one"
"O - Solidly drinkable Stout, right on the edge of Imperial Stout. Nice cherry cordial flavors provide a unique flavor combination. I'd probably get this often if it was available to me."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew that is modestly carbonated and smooth in the feel. It is easy drinking and a fairly solid representation of the style. Nothing flashy or showy about this beer, it is just done to style and it is done well. For more than 6% abv, it is hidden quite well."
"This is just an awesome beer, and I'd say its the perfect example of an American Stout. The fact that it's year-round and affordable is just a massive cherry on top. Living in an area where the Deschutes lineup is sold in every store is awesome."
"Overall this beer is great. Classic stout but a top quality classic stout. Huge dark fruits and roasty characteristics that are in harmony and deliver nice flavors. Mouthfeel is a little weak but the other aspects take up the slack. Great Stout"
"Overall: A brilliant beer. Highly recommended."
"O - great stout. I'd drink it again!"
"I would drink this again, I bought a 6 pack today and I'm anxious to taste this on tap"
"Medium bodied with a blast of dry, bitter burnt malt flavor that lingers throughout into a lingering bone dry finish. Very roasted with a dominating burnt toast/espresso bean presence that overpowers the faint sweetness that lies underneath. Kind of smokey with hints of oatmeal, cocoa and toffee."
"O: For an off the shelf stout this just about as good as it gets around here. Delicious, great roasty taste and nice body. Drinkability is awesome for the 6.4% ABV. This is as flavorful as most imperial stouts, just not as thick. I could easily go through a 6 pack of this if I felt like it. Deschutes really nailed it with this one!"
"On both the nose and the taste buds, rich coffee and molasses are layered on full multigrain biscuit backbone. It's not enough to have ""a lot of flavor;"" a beer must have those flavors in proper proportion. Obsidian delivers on both counts spectacularly."
"Overall this is a good brew that I would like to get more of.It it a great substitute if you don't want that big imperial stout sometimes."
"Pours a nice one finger head, sticks around for a little bit. Good lacing throughout the glass. Smells of rich chocolate malt and roasted malt. Somewhat of a coffee taste as well. Taste is somewhat bitter for a stout, bit by no means too bitter. Mouthfeel is very light for a stout, seems very thin, not a bad thing, just surprising. I do get hints of the coffee I smelled, and of course large quantities of the malts I mentioned. Decent carbonation, more than some stouts I've had. I taste the slightest hint of oats, this is by no means an oatmeal stout, but I get small hints of it. Drinkability is pretty high, only because it tastes pretty darn good! I wouldn't call this a ""world class"" beer, but it is very, very good."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. A solid beer that incorporates a slight char quality nicely, but there's something amiss in the nose that I'm not completely comfortable with. As smell plays a big part in the taste, it detracted a bit from that as well."
"Nice looking stout with a pleasant smell but the taste is big bold coffee without much complexity and ends rather harsh, astringent and dry. Good offering by Deschutes but I'll take the porter when I want something dark."
"Overall I would say this is my favorite beer of all time. With the amount I have had, the availability, the price, the uses (we use these to mellow the pallet between IPA's), and I usually drink them out of the bottle, so taking them to a party or gathering is easy because you don't need a glass. You can't go wrong. Highly recommended!!!"
"Pours opaque deep sable with not much head. Rich, oily aroma has firm coffee and chocolate tones - very inviting. Sweet, coffee-ish flavor has hints of chocolate and licorice and a bit of hops. Smooth, barely fizzy texture still leaves a persistent tingle."
"Very enjoyable stout."
"Drinkability: The chocolate lingers nicely, a well structured beer."
"D: Could drink this all day long, very nice."
"Another good one from Deschutes, only my second offering from them. Looking forward to more!"
"D: I think I might make this part of my regular lineup. It's just outstanding as a stout. I wonder why they've never made (to my knowledge), an imperial of this one."
"Obsidian pours pitch black, with a massive, 3.5 finger foamy cap. The head is a bit light, closer to off white than tan or caramel. Retention is solid, and lacing is above average. There are rings of foam left around the glass from the head's semi-slow descent. There's a heavy general roast presence in the nose, along with some tobacco and a little bit of dark chocolate. The tobacco fades out, and dark chocolate steps up a bit in the front of my palate, a noticeable improvement. The hop bite mid sip is enough to be noticed, but only just, and gives way to a pleasant earthy finish. The mouthfeel is easily the highlight of this beer. Body is absolutely perfect, full and creamy without getting too big for for its britches and approaching imperial level viscosity. At the same time the carbonation is enough to thwart any syrupy sensation and let the hops peek through, while remaining true to the beer's malty nature. Obsidian Stout is a solid beer from Deschutes, but nothing earth shattering."
"Pours a nice very dark brown (almost black) with about ½ finger of coffee-colored head. Smell is minimal, mostly coffee roasted malt. Taste is quite nice, heavy on the coffee, but well-rounded with medium complexity; a nice shot of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is great, appropriately heavy and creamy with a nice light carbonation. Generally a very good, above average stout, but not amazing."
"Overall, not a bad stout, but not much stands out about it either."
"D - At 6.4% I could drink this stuff all night. Perfect for a cold winter afternoon, or for any occasion where you're looking for a full flavoured stout that won't bog you down with complexity."
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, a bit creamy and chewy as it wraps around the tongue. This is a smooth, tasty stout which doesn't skimp in body or flavor even though it's not of the imperial variety, which seems to be a problem for me more often than I'd like. Definitely worth drinking again."
"Notes: Very similar to their Black Butte Porter, but with more pronounced roasted malt tastes and some slight burnt malt acidity. I enjoyed this one much more than the porter. This would be a solid go-to stout for me if it were distributed here."
"D - this is easily sessionable, very rich if flavour and feel, an outstanding stout"
"Notes: Best by 04/21/11. Very tasty stout that is incredibly easy to drink. Has a nice hop kick toward the finish that compliments the bittersweet chocolate and coffee flavors. Overall a joy to drink and a great price."
"d- nice, this is one of the better stouts i've had, lots of flavor, great mouthfeel, worth trying this one!"
"A pretty decent stout, although I would happily take some more robust flavours in there and still drink a few. I may have been tainted by the extremely good imperial stout I had before this, but comparing it with even Sierra Nevada stout for example I enjoyed the latter a lot more."
"D: Drinks quite nicely, and the ABV is fairly reasonable for having a few."
"The CPJ"
"Yeah, this is a nice stout, without being astounding. It's certainly good enough to be worthy of a couple of retries, and is certainly something I'd happily drink as a session brew, if I wanted something dark. I think that's the mark of a good simple stout."
"Although it is a very basic stout it is amazing. Damn I wish Deschutes was a little more available in my area. Such good stuff."
"D- Found this one easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"One of the most drinkable stouts I've had. It has a complex balance and great mouthfeel."
"This beer pours a nice and wonderful darkness topped by a nice thick dark tan foam. The smell is of a malted milkball made of dark chocolate. There are roast notes on the nose that also happen to nicely balance out with the sweet notes that are most prevalent upfront. The taste is quite similar to the nose only I believe the more prevalent flavor in this instance is the roast and the caramel, toffee, malt flavor takes a back to the darkness. The mouthfeel is pretty well balanced for the roast that is involved on this level of a stout. Overall if I rated solely to style this may have gotten all 5s for the simple fact that this beer is how I would make an American stout if I spent the time developing a recipe. This is a really good stout and proves that Deschutes knows what they are doing in that brewery."
"drinkability - only docked points because the beer is so rich, the flavor is unparalleled"
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date; krausened and hence, bottle-conditioned. Pours an impenetrable black, with a half-inch khaki head that retains very well and leaves lots of lacing. In the bouquet, dark malts contribute cocoa, espresso, roast and dark berries, and there is a kiss of hops in the back. Very roasty, almost burnt malts lead into a strong bitter from the piney hops while blackberries and cake batter meld with fruity yeast. Delicate and layered. Medium to full body, dry and chalky, with low carbonation and a long bitter finish. It has quite a strong flavor, but it is nuanced and well-balanced. A wonderful beer that is well-worth seeking out."
"Pours an opaque dark brown color with a tall tan head that leaves some cool lacing. Smells of roasted malts, and chocolate. Taste includes the roasted malt and chocolate notes, but I also picked up sone coffee notes. A slight sweetness at the end of the taste. I didn't really notice the hops in the mix. Mouthfeel is medium/heavy with light carbonation. Overall this beer exemplifies the style. I am not much of a stout guy, so I tried to judge it by style."
"The drinkability is not the best. The taste does not make one want to drink a ton of it. This is a great stout for those desiring a great stout."
"drinkable - yeah, sure, a couple 3 maybe."
"Pours a nice one finger head, sticks around for a little bit. Good lacing throughout the glass. Smells of rich chocolate malt and roasted malt. Somewhat of a coffee taste as well. Taste is somewhat bitter for a stout, bit by no means too bitter. Mouthfeel is very light for a stout, seems very thin, not a bad thing, just surprising. I do get hints of the coffee I smelled, and of course large quantities of the malts I mentioned. Decent carbonation, more than some stouts I've had. I taste the slightest hint of oats, this is by no means an oatmeal stout, but I get small hints of it. Drinkability is pretty high, only because it tastes pretty darn good! I wouldn't call this a ""world class"" beer, but it is very, very good."
"Overall - This is an excellent stout for sure. Somewhat like Black Butte on steroids. A must try for stout fans!"
"D: Fantastic drinkability with no over-powering flavors. Goes down easy, just an all around great beer!"
"Can't dock many points for appearance. Black as the rock that it takes its name from with a frothy tan head that leaves excellent lacing. I get very rich and roasty malts in the nose with a hint of coffee. Taste is dominated by roast malt and chocolate malt, with a very smooth finish. I like to see more chocolate and coffee nuances in my stout, but for what it is, this is a damn fine beer."
"D: Great drinkability. Goes down really smoothly with a creamy finish. I really enjoyed this one."
"Overall, one of the best Non-Imperial stouts I have had. Right up there with East End Blackstrap Stout for my favorite Non-Imperial stout."
"D - This one goes down easy for sure. I can't believe how lucky you Northwest BA's are to be able to find this so easily, even in grocery stores! This would be a staple if it was distributed near me. I would love to drink more of these."
"Fairly thick in body with plenty of prickly carbonation. Very smooth all the way through. Overall, a very well balanced and enjoyable stout that I would love to make a part of my regular rotation. Definitely lives up to the hype of being one of the best stouts out there."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D- Really highly drinkable. I would like to see many more well constructed stouts with lower abvs like this one."
"D: pretty standard stout. I would expect a little more form Deschutes, but there was nothing wrong with it so I really can't complain."
"D - For all the hop and smoky character, this is a surprisingly drinkable beer. A nice change of pace from the creamy milk and oatmeal stouts I've been drinking lately."
"Its Deschutes day at my house today.Poured a jet black with a brilliant light mocha colored crown that nver really settled,great defintion and a nice crown.Aromas of heavy roast and molasses mainly,a bit of earthiness emerges as well.Again heavy roast on the palate with a little rawness,some unsweetened bitter chocolate as well,quite dry.Easy to drink,the earthy finish is the main reason for me,no doubt a heavy roasted, and highly hopped left coast American stout."
"Deschutes is a brewery that impresss me alot! They have such great black beers. Another star amoung the style. I would go to the ends of the earth for this beer and the black butte porter! Must try!"
"As for it's drinkability, well yea I've often told myself I'll have 1 or 2 from a six pack, and find myself with 5 or 6 empty bottles."
"Had this on nitro-tap at the Deschutes brewpub in Portland. Thick tan head on top of an opaque almost black beer. Nice rings of lacing after each sip. Big roasted malt smell, both chocolate and coffee. Incredibly well balanced stout, some roast bitterness and sweetness in the flavour. Creamy mouthfeel, likely from the nitro. Really nice stout."
"D: The beer was okay overall, but I probably won't drink it too much in the future. I sort of felt about it the same way I feel about India Pale Ales: I prefer American Pale Ales or Double IPAs, but IPAs are somewhat annoying to me. APAs are mostly balanced with a slight hop bitterness, and DIPAs are very hoppy and alcoholic. But IPAs are only hoppy, which I don't really like. In a similar way, with dark beers I prefer a sweet/balanced Porter or a big, complex Russian Imperial Stout, but Stouts are often just bitter. I guess I don't like bitterness to be the foremost characteristic of a beer, I like bitterness to only have a supporting role to the flavor profile."
"Pours usual dark colored but with poor head, poor head retention and some lacing. The aroma and taste were roast, malts, chocolate, coffee and had some coconut notes, something that I never got from this beer. In my opinion ""nitro"" hurt this beer's mouthfeel; can't say how or why but seemed thinner than usual and there was no creaminess that I was expecting. Drinkability is ok."
"Black pour with brown edges and a small, dense, tan head. The aroma has notes of rolled oats, with a mild balance of dark fruit, chocolate, coffee, and tobacco. The flavor is similar to the aroma. It's a bit sharp though with notes of dark chocolate and a bitter coffee finish. The body is a bit thin but creamy with lots of carbonation."
"Carbonation is a little too high."
"Bottle courtesy of Black13 - thanks! Poured into NB globe, opaque black with dark brown edges when held up to light. Thin tan head fades to collar. Smell is spicy hops, roasted malt, some coffee and black patent. Taste is a nice balance of bitter bakers chocolate and spicy hops with dark roasted malts in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lively medium carbonation - a bit bubbly even after a vigorous pour. A very drinkable American Stout, but not my favorite. Definitley gets better as it warms."
"Healthy body and carbonation, but goes down very slick compared to most stouts (or maybe I've just been drinking too many Russian Imperials lately). Definitely a full-flavored beer, and like everything else from Deschutes, a very solid brew."
"This is really good. Perhaps not the mindblower most Deschutes stuff is, but for a flavorful, accessible, very drinkable and just damn solid American stout...this one delivers."
"This is a solid Stout, and well worth keeping around."
"Despite the thick feel, this one is pretty easy to drink."
"Overall a very good stout and one of the best looking beers I've seen."
"D: Very good stout. An easy to drink beer packing the roast punch you'd hope for in a stout."
"Poured a very dark brown with brown highlights that had a thin head and left some frothy lacing sticking to the glass. The coffee and chocolate malts dominated the nose with roasty, slight oat grains, and faint lacto notes. The coffee is more potent on the palate with oat grains, chocolate, and roasty accents. It did have coffee bean and vanilla bean notes in the background as well. The brew was full in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, roasty, slight astringent, malty, and creamy silky finish. It drank decent but was really tasty. Can't believe why I would avoid this brew for so long."
"Nice carbonation and very drinkable. Good job Deschutes."
"(D)- A superb stout. Has the flavor to back it up and rival some Russian Imperial Stouts out there. A great drinker and just damn tasty. If this was distributed by me, this would always be in my fridge for those brisk fall/winter days. Perhaps THE best American Stout I have had."
"D - Very enjoyable. I would definitely get this one again if the opportunity arises. However, this is the most filling beer I've had that was under 10%. One of these per evening is plenty, but it's easy to sip on during the night."
"D - This is one helluva highly drinkable stout! I love stouts and this one did not disappoint. One I would recommend to any of my friends that could get their hands on it. Very delicious...thanks CK!"
"D: Enjoyable for the bitter side of stout-land. Well conceived and executed."
"---if you like this you might want to try Henry Weinhard's Dark Lager which is seasonal. It is what Full Sail came out with last year basically. Stouty-taste in a lager. A bit interesting, still tastes like a lager but is a nice change w/ the dark bit of taste. Goes for about $10.47 a 12pk. locally.--"
"Taste of strong coffee, some licorice, and a little bit of bittering hops with some bakers chocolate taste. There is a light to medium body, that seems just right with the sweetness for the style. This is a nice american stout. A tasty brew from Deschutes regular lineup after having their ""other"" beers in bombers. Medium on the high side carbonation that works well and may bring out more hop presence. Well done"
"Smooth light bodied beer with fairly high carbonation is easy to drink but the light body makes it a bit similar to black butte."
"Drinkability is good, very inviting in every sense."
"Overall, a sold drinkable stout."
" ~ This is the kind of stout you enjoy as a desert or a precursor to an evening out. Find some and drink some. This is the real deal."
"D-Tasty stout, and certainly represents the style well. It kind of blends in among the crowd, though, as far as the flavor profile goes."
"D: This was a damn fine stout. Like many craft brew drinkers, I grew up drinking Guinness. Had this been given to me instead, i would have thought Guinness tasted like water. This beer has wonderful flavors and equally beautiful drinkability. The only thing more I could ask from it is maybe just a hint more hop flavor. Otherwise this beer is pretty damn close to perfect."
"D: Solid American Stout definitely wirth drinking. My inexperience may be preventing me from awarding a higher rating..."
"D- pretty good. smooth, creamy, not a hint of 6.4 per cent. could easily have a couple of these."
"The thinness of the body does make this very drinkable and although I panned the mouthfeel I did down this pretty darn quickly, however I was in no rush to open another but found myself wanting something different."
"D- A nice stout, definately worth trying if you like stouts."
"I've never given a beer a 5 before, but I feel this beer deserves it. I buy it frequently and I believe it is one of the most balanced beers out there. I've yet to have another American Stout I'd rather drink."
"Great looking pour, black, and a tan head that hangs out for a little while. Really faint coffee and fruit smell. A little roasted malt in there too. The faint aroma is a bit misleading because the taste proves that this stout is one of the standard setters for American Stouts. Roasted malts up front, a bit coffee-like, a touch of hops, and nice touch of dryness on the back. Smooth. Really like this stout."
"A top notch stout, but I have to knock a few points off due to the strong roast here. I could have two of these, but that would be my cutoff. The roasty malts to take their toll on the palate, but by no means does that hurt the overall beer. One fine, fine brew."
"This is a tasty stout with plenty of flavour and a nice hop character too."
"Overall a straight-on great stout, very true to it's pedigree type, and the slightly higher alcohol content packs more punch than an average lager...just not as memorable as some of the other more flavored varietals--such as Lagunitas cappuccino stout."
"D: Good drinkability. A solid stout."
"D -- A decadent stout that would stand up to any other I can think of. Another textbook example from our friends in Oregon."
"I am really excited to try and pair this beer up with some great beer."
"Beer is medium in body with minimal forward sweetness with nice back palate bitterness from the roasted grain. Drinkability really nice and mouthfeel ok. It's simple, one nite, relatively standard beer but quite decent."
"Cheers..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is under medium bodied, with some fine carbonation. It seems appropriate for the style. Drinkability is very high, this beer just has a nice solid flavor and it's not too heavy. Deschutes hits again."
"Nice extra thrown in on a trade - thanks Destral. Always been a fan of Deschutes when I've had the chance to try, and I'm glad to be sampling this one. Pours nearly black, no light, soft looking head. Nice charred aroma, roasty, subtle hops. Well rounded flavor here - really nice and robust, burned wood taste, malty as hell and nice dark roast to this one, balanced by a nice hop bitterness. Subtle tobacco or leather flavor, nice. Lots going on, but smooth and not muddled, making this a nice drinkable stout for the colder weather. Nothing imperial or extreme about this at all - just a nice flavorful stout."
"Medium bodied with nice carbonation, and a bit of a burnt coffee aftertaste. This is essentially a classic style American Stout. Not quite as smooth and creamy as I would like, but still a very good beer."
"D= This is an all around great brew. I think when I got a stout craving this is my new go to. Cheap and delicious without being too high in alcohol."
"A good beer all around, whether for sipping or sessions."
"D- I found the beer very filling after about 2, regardless its an excellent beer that is hard to stop drinking. Excellent ABV."
"D: Super drinkable and delicious. I like how this beer isn't overly full of coffee or chocolate flavors, but rather perfectly balanced between them. Very creamy. This one is a tad more bitter than most, but delicious none the less."
"This beer pours a black color with brown hues. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly leaving sticky lacing. the aroma is of milk chocolate, with roasted malt and dark toffee. The taste is perhaps the chocolatiest I have ever encountered in a beer. There are some nice secondary roasted malt and toffee notes adding nice complexity. Great flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a silky texture and light, fine carbonation. Overall, this is a great stout that I can see quickly becoming a regular in my rotation."
"D- Good drinking stout. Nothing fancy, but very solid. Had been drinking lighter beers this week so it was a great change up. One of the better stouts I've had."
"D - This one seems a lot bigger than it's 6.4%, and I was shocked that it wasn't 9%+. Knocked down the drinkability on this one for that as one 12 oz. did me just fine. Great beer though that I would love to drink again."
"Pours black and opaque with a thick brown creamy head. Tons or roasty coffee aroma and charcoal. Favor is rich with roasted barley. nice malt backbone but the burnt woody and dry coffee take over. Finishes semi dry and clean. Really drinkable stout, but I can name a handful of others I'd rather drink..."
"Overall, a very good stout. Nothing stuck out as particularly memorable or great about it though. Just a really solid stout overall."
"This is a tasty, though a bit light-bodied stout. The tartness also makes this a bit unusual. Could enjoy a couple of these at 6.4% ABV."
"A low abv stout that is super easy to drink and tasty. An A+ Englishish stout that you could just crush all day. Wasn't expecting much but this is a great one."
"Drinkable roasty smooth stout."
"Cheers..."
"Not the best stout out there but a pretty good one. Above average. I would like the beer to be a bit smoother but it is a damn good stout."
"could drink these all day. exceptional beer."
"Next to last brew for me tonite at my local watering hole; finally getting around to reviewing it. Poured a dark brown/nearly black with a very creamy head that disapated rather quickly. Nose picked up a little roasted malt; nothing else. Taste was great. Chocolatly malty goodness with no bitter after taste. As it warmed, it just got better and better--I even splashed a bit of Lindeman's Framboise into the last three ounces or so to make a GREAT raspberry stout. I don't think this little brother of Abyss gets any respect: I'd do more than a couple in a sitting."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter a very dark opaque black color with a tan head that dissipates quickly. Smell is very coffee like with some bitterness and dark fruits. Taste is coffee malts and bitter. Feels good with a tight crisp carbonation and a definite full body. Overall a very good stout."
"D- Big beer here, at at 6.4%, a little less than sessionable. Quite tasty, this beer deserves a giant mug along side a hearty winter meal to really be just perfect."
"Medium, almost full bodied. Highly drinkable. Yeah. More like this please."
"Glad I bought this, and I will be picking up another 6 pack soon, another winner from Deschutes."
"O: Very good beer, but I would expect nothing less from Deschutes."
"Drinkability: Perhaps one of the most drinkable stouts I've had recently. It was easy to drink three 12-oz bottles at one sitting. Looking forward to more."
"D: This beer, as full bodied as it is, could almost be mistaken for an imperial stout, although it's drinkability shows it's true style. An amazing brew, and an easily drinkable one at that! Props to the folks at Deschutes!"
"Drinkability: This is about as good as a non-Imperial American Stout can get, but I may give the edge to Bell's Kalamazoo. Deschutes really knows how to make roasted beers (this, Black Butte Porter, Black Butte XXI, Hop in the Dark) - I have yet to try Abyss but I assume it will keep this trend alive."
"A moderately stout stout. Not as in-your-face as Old Rasputin; more in line with Guinness, but with more alcohol, so you get a nice mellow buzz. The taste makes you want to come back for more, although if you have been away from stout for a while you have to take a couple sips to get back in the groove. In fact, you better have self control, because you will want to drink it all up. I went driving down route 97 in Oregon a few years ago, and this brew makes me think of the volcanic region south of Bend. I imagine this tastes just like the volcanic rock would taste if you were dumb enough to eat some."
"Cheers for the 'bigger' hop quotient - while it doesn't add a lot in the way of distinct additional flavours, it does keep this whole thing from becoming a big hot chocolate espresso mess. Obsidian is still replete with those characteristics, but with a scrappy balance that goes a long way in making me want another."
"Probably my favorite stout thus far for drinking on a regular basis. Readily available and easy drinking for when I feel like a good stout."
"Deschutes Brewery--Obsidian Stout--Original--2009 12 oz. Bottle. 6.40% ABV--55 IBU's. (4.5 / 5.0) Thin espresso mild lace head. Clear opaque dark obsidian black red edge color. Rich roasted cocoa hop mild fruit front. Crusty dry sweet burnt dark chocolate rich clean roasted malt body. Balanced rich hop spice crisp Stout end. Rich not sweet NW Classic. Sampled 3/7/2010. 6-Pack $6.99."
"Final Notes: A decent American stout. I'll drink it, but I think there are better American stouts out there. If you like the taste of burnt toast, however, this is probably the beer for you."
"Bell's Expedition is the best Big Stout I've found (that's not enhanced by add-ins or barrell) and Obsidian is damn close and just over half the $."
"D: This is a wonderful stout-I could definitely see knocking back a fair few of these in an evening."
"I would love more of it, but I live way out of the Deschutes marketing area."
"The mouthfeel is on the thicker side with a little below average carbonation. Drinkability is excellent. It's a great tasting and very flavorful stout. What really impresses me is just how flavorful it is for being below 7% alcohol. This is better then the majority of imperial stouts out there. Fantastic beer overall and would definitely be a regular purchase if that was possible in this area."
"Overall-an excellent stout, nice flavors and sweetness, actually fairly light for a strong stout. While this may not be the heaviest stout it has all the character to match with the best."
"Drink for a stout its very high, but its not one to have a slammed 6'r in a night."
"D - With the low carbonation, smooth body, and well-hidden alcohol, this is one stout you could drink all night long. I wish the flavor and nose popped a little more, but otherwise it's very delicious."
"A normal pour just about fills half the glass with extremely whipped up and delicate dark tan foam, eventually settles into two fingers' worth of craters and valleys, at this level it shows excellent retention and the stickiness of the lacing is unquestionably intense. Pure black liquid, however, looks entirely unblemished and possessed of a sleek shininess. The nose has a pleasingly subdued roastiness to it, slowly unfolds oatmeal, cherry to black grape fruit scents, German chocolate cake, coconut flakes and mixed nuts, more grains than coffee, caramel elevates through the end, balanced and simply presented. Medium-bodied, same general demeanor here, sticks to representing the category rather than reaching for greater heights. Burnt cocoa powder, dark chocolate, grilled nuts and sweet cherry, blackberry, plum fruit lend familiarity. The carbonation has a slow muscular churn to it, helps to get the hoppiness up into the air, bringing snappiness to the proceedings. Not that rich nor sappy but the flavors continue on for some time after you swallow. If you are looking for a basic stout that isn't too creamy, here it is."
"SkÅL!"
"Drinkability - overall I really enjoyed it. Great lasting flavor, but will let the next one warm up before drinking."
"The color is black with a fizzy but sticky cream-colored head that leaves a tangled web of lacing all the way down the glass that lasts until after the last drop of liquid is gone. The aroma is not very prominent, but there are hints of chocolate and dark caramel sweetness that are discernable. The flavor is a real winner, though, with a big bitter chocolate flavor and a subtle underlying sweetness. The heavily roasted malts are right out in front, but rather than being harsh, the dark roasted malts are quite mellow, allowing the flavor to shine without overpowering with bitterness. A fizzy carbonation makes this one go down easily, but I think I would have preferred a creamier texture. Overall, although this stout does not knock it out of the park in every aspect, the great flavor profile makes this one a great choice."
"incredible, ridiculous mouthfeel, tastes as thick and smooth as any beer i've ever had - probably the strongest point of the beer is the mouthfeel - 5.5 points!"
"My 500th review! [insert loud, slow exhalation/fake crowd cheer here] The beer pours a verrrry slightly translucent deept brown, highlighted in dark garnet, topped by a relatively short-lived finger of light ecru micro-foam. The nose comprises deep chocolate, molasses, caramelized sugar, dark roasted malts, and a vague background sense of roasted marshmallows. The taste focuses on the roastier notes, though the molasses and newcomer and cousin maple syrup lead an attempted and vain coup on behalf of the sweeter notes. A touch of smoke finds its way into the finish. The body verges on a heavy medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth and somewhat thin feel. Overall, a more-than-solid stout, one that I could easily see myself drinking on a regular basis, if possible."
"Taste followed suit but there was a lot more prominent hop flavor on the finish, as well as a bit of tobacco. Definitely a tasty beer"
"Drinkability: Meh, sadly, I could kind of take it or leave it. I really remember this being better when I lived in Oregon, but oh well. I feel the flavors are OK, but deceiving at the same time due to the amazing smells blasting out of the glass -- if only the flavors matched the smells."
"Not the best stout out there, but it's definitely one of the better ones, especially for the price and availability. I have yet to be disappointed with Deschutes brews."
"Medium-heavy body. Soft carbonation. Plush texture. Not the most drinkable beer. The immense roasted character makes it a challenge to drink at times. Astringent flavor is tough to handle at times. I hope to try this again, much closer to the source."
"d - A nice stout. Great chocolate smell and taste, would try again."
"Overall this was a very nice American Stout that is certainly worthy of its praise. Thanks again André! Recommended."
"D- Fairly high, I'd buy it if I had access to it. Not a knockout but no slouch.. another solid Deschutes beer."
"D: Really good. Too bad we can't get this one in Ohio. It would be another stand-by."
"Picked this up on a recent trip to Portland. Not being overly familiar with West Coast breweries, I honestly didn't know that I was in so many tasty samples while there. This one was probably my favorite. Pitch black in appearance. Very smoky, taste. In fact, I really hadn't experienced ""smoke"" in taste/smell until I tried some porters and stouts in Portland. Exceptionally drinkable. Makes me wish I lived in Portland!"
"If you enjoy a good, strong stout beer then it would be a sin for you not to buy a six pack."
"This beer reminds me of the world's largest obsidian flows at Newberry Volcano--just a few miles south of the brewery. ""The Big Obsidian Flow," as they call it, covers more than 700 acres with shiny black obsidian. (Yep, stole that too.) Ok, here's something original: This beer was good. I liked it."
"D: Very nice all around. Nothing too outstanding, but a quaffable, fairly low abv dark brew, which I'm always happy to find."
"D- a very sessionable everyday stout from a solid brewery most well known for it's juggernaut imperial stout"
"Refreshingly light mouthfeel for a stout, especially given the full flavor. Balanced, complex, and very drinkable!"
"Mouthfeel is medium to light for a stout. Carbonation is high. Coffee notes are strong throughout. Booze is low, infact not really noticable at all. This beer should be drank at cellar temp for sure. Fridge temps seriously hurt the flavor on the palate. Overall though, a good stout from Deschutes. I was hoping for more, but not bad at all."
"Drinkability - Great. The rich flavors coupled with the very smooth feel in your mouth makes this a beer that I would drink repeatedly. This beer will be a part of the regular rotation."
"Overall this is a balanced and delicious stout that I wouldn't hesitate to have again next time I have the opportunity. I do wish the booziness was more well hidden."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. A nice balance of flavors, definitely will be picking this up again."
"Stored slightly chilled. Perfect temp. Poured into a tulip glass. Dark chocolate color with a nice brown head that slowly dissolved. Smells of malt. Smokey with hints of chocolate and coffee. Rich taste that went down smooth. Great pairing with chocolate cheesecake."
"Tasty and drinkable, great beer, the smoke and tobacco flavors would probably keep me from ordering more than one."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This is a wonderful American stout. The beer has depth, contrast, and flavor. I am glad I can get this beer."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a jet black with a creamy tannish head that leaves insane amounts of lace on the glass. Smell is roasted/smoked peat moss. Taste is spot on with the smell, a slight hop bitterness toward the finish. I can smell smoked meat, a bit of coffee grounds, with smooth creamy finish. Not to sweet but dead on with the style and one that I truly enjoyed overall this is one fine damn offering of a stout."
"Hands down one of the best stouts on the face of the planet. Pours a deep, dark brown to black coloration with a subtle golden mocha head that leaves little remnant of its presence on the glass. Aroma profile is a rich blend of coffee, dark chocolate, and slight licorice. Taste is beyond comparison. Plenty of dark roasted malt flavor with a definitive hoppy finish to drown the palate in beery ecstasy making the lucky imbiber want to take in more of this delicious nectar. Mouthfeel is one of the best around, not thin but chunky and chewy with lots of texture. Drinkability is surprisingly high. It's not uncommon for me to drink a few of these in a single sitting while enjoying the world go by. Believe it or not, it makes the movie ""Bound"" even better. And in a way, it is the Jennifer Tilly of the beer world. A sumptuous vixen with legs that don't stop and a mind that keeps you questioning the existence of your very being."
"D- Very, very drinkable."
"A solid American stout with classic flavors from a brewery that has yet to disappoint."
"If it werent for the mouthfeel this would be an exceptional beer for sure."
"Overall: Perhaps one of the best (or simply THE best) readily available American Stouts priced at a value. I have seen six-packs for $7.99. For a world class stout, that is hard to match. Another solid offering from one of my favorite breweries."
"Overall another really killer beer from Deschutes. Every beer I've had from them has been at least above average, if not exceptional. This is a great American Stout - not dry but not sweet either. Roasty as hell, pretty bitter, dark as night, quaffable. Very, very good job."
"heavy enough to qualify for export strength."
"D - A recent discovery for me, and one of my new favorite stouts. I could drink these all night, quite an accomplishment given the moderately high ABV of 6.4% -- getting close to Imperial Stout ranges. Highly reccommended."
"D - I have to say, this really is a terrrific stout. Has some complexities and intensities of an imperial but at a standard alcohol level...what more could you ask for - a truly sessionable imperial stout. I do wish the flavors were more multi-dimensional to match the aroma, but it really is hard to complain about this one. Glad I got to try this one...definitely was not on my radar (but will be now...that's why we trade, right?) Excellent stout...highly recommended."
"Overall, an excellent AmStout that I highly recommend. Great coffee and bitter chocolate aroma and flavor. Rotation - not avail here in TX yet (we get several others from them but not this) so shipped to myself. If here, would be an occasional sixer in the stout rotation. [L;stout]"
"(Bottle BB 2/4/10): Pours a dark black color body, average tan head, somewhat lasting. Dark roasty aroma, alcoholy. Some sweetness, coffee. Funky taste, coffee aftertaste. Light body, somewhat watery. Some ash, but not heavy. A bit of wildness too. Not so tasty."
"The Obsidian is thick for sure, but it's a stout with just the right carbonation so I wouldn't have to struggle through the middle or end. Filling, without ending my night or obliterating my palate."
"D - This is a nice stout. It has oatmeal stout-like qualities."
"Another great one from Deschutes. Even their everyday beers are great. Thanks again Tim and thanks Deschutes!"
"Taste follows and adds a bit of a coarse chocolate texture with a hint of cherry and a nice full body. Nicely balanced sweetness is just enough to smooth out the roasted flavors and provide some body without getting in the way. Finish becomes a bit drier as the carbonation lessens, remaining quite drinkable."
"Verdict: Straightforward but never simple, Obsidian Stout is a winner through-and-through. It's rich and full flavored with a great balance of toasted malt, chocolate, and dark coffee--the three hallmarks of a good Stout."
"D - one of, if not my favorite American Stout. bold where it needs to be, and graceful in all the right places. has all the elements of a wonderfully crafted beer. cheers to Deschutes for this one."
"A good almost great session beer. Enjoyable, but not quite as good as I was hoping for. Definitely could enjoy as few but there are better stouts out in my area that I would drink, rather than trade for this again. Thanks Sugit."
"For such a bold, dry taste and nose, the mouthfeel is very light. It manages to go down smooth with a smack of tart bitterness at the end. The alcohol is completely hidden in the flavor, but given the huge flavoring I'd consider this of only average drinkability -- for a stout."
"This one was big and bold in the flavor, with good aggressive hopping. Pretty awesome stout."
"D - Well I wasn't blown away by this beer but I did enjoy every sip of it. I really enjoyed the intoxicating aroma with an unexpected note of charcoal, and the rich/hearty flavor profile! Very drinkable for 6.4% ABV, around 2 pints for me, it doesn't get overly sweet and the alcohol is very well hidden. It's definitely worth seeking out. Cheers!"
"Edit- head is more brown than tan. Big coffee hit in the nose and the hops are very noticeable. Pretty good effervescence. This might have been a fresher bottle than first review. Bump up smell score and taste score. Not a high ABV version, but one of the tastiest stouts to be found."
"This is a long-time favorite of mine and a stout that stacks up well next to many of the Imperial/Double stouts, despite coming in at a relatively low 6.4%. Very nice stout for any time of the year. Deschutes, you are truly great."
"D-this is extremely tasty but the burning seems to take away from it. it is quite powerful for a regular stout and i would seek it out again!"
"This is truly one of the greats, not just in its style but in the beer world - period."
"Drinkability: definitely one of the most drinkable richly-flavored dark beers I've ever had. Its flavor builds on the palate, so there's a cumulative effect at work here, but the flavor is just so smooth and lacking in detriments that I don't mind. A classic."
"Warming and welcoming. Drink this on a cold night."
"this is a good beer to enjoy during the winter months... but i'm in arizona and its sunny and 75 degrees. good nonetheless."
"Taste is very smooth with baker's chocolate maltiness leading the way. A tad roasty and toasty while the hops are more subtle than the nose indicates - still pretty bitter with a nice hop flavor. Very smooth and adequately full mouthfeel. While this is not Deschutes finest offering, it is a damn tasty stout. More please."
"Mouthfeel is very nice, rich, full, thick and creamy. Strong roasted coffee finish with a bit of a bitterness from it but not overwhelming. Carbonation is low, adds to drinkability for the style. Finish is a bit too bitter for me but it's decent."
"That deep taste of chococoffee never fades, it becomes even more drinkable throughout the bottle. While I've had other Deschutes stuff that at times tastes inconsistent, I've had numerous Obsidian Stout's in various forms, and never, ever has any of them been anything short of magnifique!"
"Overall an above average stout."
"A really fantastic beer. Everything is very well balanced with no component totally overwhelming. This is one of those rare American stouts that one can drink a lot of. Truly one of the best."
"Overall a very good stout. I wish this was available in my area."
"D: Nicely blended, very tasty, not very filling. This is one of the better stouts that I have had recently with a reasonable ABV. If they distributed here, it would be one I buy frequently!"
"D - Impressive and satisfying, this stout walks the fine line of subtle and flavorful just beautifully."
"D: Very drinkable, this one was awesome to drink, loved it. World class,all of the aspects of a great stout mixed together in one bottle."
"the finish is warming and a med body that leaves notes of coffee in the nasal. this is a great stout and its even better that it comes in six packs and doesn't cost an arm and a leg, a true standby!"
"This is my first written review. I hope it didn't suck. :)"
"D - Damn skippy - this one is a keeper. I find it more enjoyable with each sip."
"A decent stout. Not as much roasted malt as I thought there was going to be, and there are two different bitter flavors that are at odds with each other (one from the chocolate, and one from the hops). This is worth a try, but not one of there better beers."
"Overall this has to be one of the best values out there; often in the sub-7 dollar range for a sixer. Quality like this at that price is one of life's small pleasures."
"4.0 D: Not bad. Would like to see the burnt flavors supplemented with some malty sweetness though."
"Drinkability: An excellent stout that I could have several of--especially if I could find it around here. Nice and smooth. Sweet but not overly sweet. An excellent first experience with this brewery."
"D: Loved it."
"Burnt and heavy roasted malts. Maybe even some smokey malts. Hints of vanilla and mocha liek sweetness for this dark stout. I could drink a ton of this these deepite the abv. and the heavy palate. This beer is so chock full of flavor, i could drink thsi till I burst."
"D- Really nice hearty coffee/chocolate flavor. I really wish I could get Deschutes out here."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable stout. Rich enough to satisfy without making it too over-bearing. I'll have to try it on nitro sometime."
"Smooth and creamy. Light and utterly drinkable. This could def become my new stout of choice."
"The finish is a clean hop bitterness with some roast and light malt character."
"Pours black with a red tint. A one-fingered head forms but quickly settles to a thin cap. Just a little spotty lacing is left on the glass. The aroma consists of a complex blend of roasted malt, chocolate, leather, and smoke or ash. There is a lot going on with this stout. The flavor is complex as well. Roasted malt gives the base with a burnt bitterness, but there is also bitter chocolate, some dark, dried fruit like prunes, and finishes with an ash, smokey flavor. Overall bitterness is moderate to high. Hard to pick out any sweetness in this one. In fact it makes it a little difficult to drink. Has a hardy body but it is a bit overcarbonated making it seem lighter than it really is. An outstanding stout that packs a lot of different elements in if you like bitter flavors."
"Drinkability- I like it. Great beer for a cold night."
"Pretty good stout but I have seen better ones out there. Overall its something you can try, but nothing fascinating to pick up again."
"I would love to have more of this but I never see it in the midwest."
"This is very drinkable."
"Maybe my favorite ale in Deschutes' very fine year round lineup. A great beer and very affordable in Salem, OR. Often available for $6.99 a sixer on sale. Great value."
"Overall Impression: Very satisfied with the beer, very aromatic for a stout, I could smell the beer before even coming close to the glass. The lingering taste in your mouth after this beer will remind you what a fine chocolate stout you just enjoyed. The most impressive aspect is the balance with the deep roasted malts and hops. The bitterness is hardly noticeable."
" This beer was exciting to drink. It felt like the immage one would have of a kid in a candy store in their mind if they didn't mind thining about kids in candy stores."
"Overall, this is a pretty good stout. Fairly drinkable with a big flavor. I don't think it would be too hard to have another one of these in the night. Give this one a shot, it's pretty good."
"While I don't normally enjoy beers served on Nitro, I would certainly order this one again. I would enjoy reviewing this beer carbonated with CO2 as opposed to Nitro and compare the differences."
"D: I started it thinking how sessionable it was, bit before I even finished, I had to second guess that. I really enjoyed one, but would move on to something else after."
"D) Top notch. A fantastic stout. Well crafted. Another and another and another please."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent stout that I wish was readily available to me in Massachusetts. Unfortunately it isn't so I relished the opportunity to taste this and enjoyed it down until the very last sip."
"very nice nitro version"
"How about serving this one with a mole?"
"This is certainly one of the better standard stouts I've had recently and the Jekyll & Hyde type taste is very unique and well executed."
"Overall impression: A rock solid stout, sessionable yet assertive. Great stuff."
"D - Would not feel guilty drinking a bunch of these. Well done !!"
"Drinkability: A great break from studying for the LSAT, this is truly a stunning stout. Too bad it is entirely unavailable in my area."
"Overall it's a great example of the style. I can only imagaine it would be exceptional all-around if it was served on nitro."
"Future outlook: Obtained in a trade and not available here...the price is apparantly quite reasonable....once you pair that with the superb quality, it makes it a damn shame that it is unavailable here."
"Pours a deep black with a milk chocolatey brown head that quickly fell apart to a light film. Smells like chocolate, malts, piny hops, a bit of java. Tastes deliciously chocolatey, malty, and bitter. Mouthfeel is creamy and full, wonderfully complimenting the taste. Drinkability is absurdly good."
"I would love more of these. There is something in the dry finish though I could use a bit more malt with, but certainly not much of a detractor. This is more than likely the best American Stout out there. So close to being perfect."
"D - Very drinkable, not sessionable really, but it's a good treat and I'd like to use it for a float too."
"And the darkness of Obsidian stout quelled my passions."
"D- Starts out good and enjoyable but by the time I finish I need to wash my mouth out from the after taste"
"Drinkability: At 6.4% ABV, this might be a slightly more sessionable stout. The richness and the complexity of the taste profile challenge you to drink just one. If I had more in the fridge, there would be more going down the hatch tonight. Oh well! All in all, this is one hell of an American Stout."
"D: Smooth, filling, and tasty. Just another day with Deschutes!"
"Overall Impression: A smooth complex stout. It's one more beer I wish I could buy in Kansas City."
"Pours a perfect dirty motor oil black. Thick and chunky this one is. Great foamy tan head on top. Retention is great leaving with it nice lacing rings. Smells of deep dark chocolate, espresso, grape jam, and wine. Nice. Great thick oily mouth on this one. Drinkability is high. Flavors of roasted cocoa, bitter coffee, finishes slightly acrid and burnt. Decent. I like this brew alot. Great stout. Recommend."
"Note: This was not the best bottle of Obsidian I've encountered. It's usually quite a bit more even, like a good cup of coffee; not too sweet or bitter, but complex and full. Maybe it was me, maybe it was the brew. Either way, I have given this a combined rating which may change the next time I buy a bottle or order one out."
"If you like a well made stout grab this one. If you don't like stouts you should still try this because you may be very surprised."
"At this price, who can not like this beer?"
"D: Drinks lighter than it is. A very nice stout that I can drink too much of if I'm not careful. The simple flavor profile was a nice change of pace for me."
"D- I will preface it with this is one of my top styles. It goes without saying not a session beer (for me). I see this beer widely available out here in SD. I need to remember how lucky I am for that. Great, solid stout."
"D- A great American Stout at a low abv which is great in this land of imperials. Not quite a session beer but I would drink a few. The burnt malt may wear thin after some time. Either way this was a treat and I would drink again. Would like to try a freshie to compare."
"Pours a very dark brown, approaching black. Strong, tall brown head look great. Deschutes makes some beautiful looking beers. Smells of roasted grains, chocolate truffles, cut grass. Dark chocolate, roasted to burnt charcoal flavors. green hops, bitterness mixes well with burnt flavor. Not overly complex but doesn't try to be. Just clean and well balances with a nice big bold burnt flavor. Mouthfeel makes the beer great. Chewy and soft and oh so smooth. Brewed with oatmeal? Must be to get this mouthfeel. Drinks very well. a great, easy drinking stout."
"D-A very sessionable stout. This is one stout that you could have a few of over the course of a night."
"Overall, a great beer. Very refreshing aromas, flavors, and mouth feel combine to offer both complexity and variety. It's not transcendent by any means, but it is highly enjoyable, and at an ABV of 6.4% virtually a session beer that invites repeated pourings and indulgences."
"Pitch Black, big frothy dirty head. Looks amazing. Aroma has tons of Roasted malts, hint of sweetness. Creamy, medium to full bodied, balanced, fantastic bittering. Dangerously drinkable, completely blown away by my first Descutes experience."
"I like most everything I have drank from Deschutes so I wasn't worried about this one. It pours Black into the glass with a big frothy head with good lacing as the pint got lower. Smells roasty, milk chocolate, coffee, some vanilla, and a little doughy. Taste faintly of bitter coffee and some chocolate. Full Bodied, creamy. Good beer"
"Another exceptional beer from Deschutes."
"D: This beer alone was worth the 1.5 mile walk to the liquor store from my hotel. As far as American stouts go, this one is near the top."
"D - This beer was a wonderful example of a Stout, lots of flavors and complexity to it, a great beer, to bad Deschutes does not distribute down here"
"Full and creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry and tannic. Thanks to Sparky27 for sharing this one."
"As far as mouthfeel and drinkability go the beer has a moderate amount of carbonation and is not too thick for a stout. It pours thicker than it drinks that is for sure. The alcohol is not very pronounced and it has a complex mix of sweet and bitter flavors that make it very enjoyable."
"D - For the style, very."
"Drinkability: A phenomenal beer, one of the best American stouts I've ever had, and a firm winner from Deschutes. It manages to strike the perfect balance in a lot of places, not too astringent or too sweet or too dry, and has plenty of complexity to go around, all in a reasonably-sessionable package. Highly recommended."
"First sip reveals average body and very mild carbonation. The flavor is sweet cocoa for a second and rolls to some roasted malt as the nose predicted. I dont find any hop presence or hints of ABV either. The beer is very drinkable and smooth and I would definitely enjoy this brew again. A nice version of a good stout. Pick up a bottle or 6 if you see it!"
"D: Despite some 'big' malt attributes I though this was as close to a session stout as you'd want. Actually like the balance; the asringency I couild have done without."
"come to think of it,... im gonna do that right now."
"Drinkability? Have Deschutes distribute to western PA and see how fast I go through their lineup. Very good beer."
"D. I guess you could call this a ""session stout"" as its quite thin and refreshing for such a dark beer. Not bad but not my favorite from these guys. Minus the LINGERING astrigency, it would get a lot better score from me. Seriously, I could still taste it 10 minutes after I finished this glass of beer."
"This is a standout beer."
"This is a pretty damn drinkable stout. Definitely something I could drink quite a few of."
"D - I want this beer to be part of my life."
"D- if i can get through a six pack of it and it is a stout, then it has pretty damn good drinkability."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head. Smells of roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate. Tastes of coffee, roasted malts and chocolate with a nice balance of hops. Mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied. This is very good stout, I would recommend this to anybody."
"Extremely drinkable stout, especially with the ABV not blowing you off your seat."
"Nice work on an American Stout. One of the better ones that I've had the pleasure of drinking."
"Not too big not too small. This beer is really well balanced. I'd gladly drink a bunch of these in a night."
"Drinkability- Very easy dinking yet a substantial beer. Outstanding overall."
"I could only have one of these in a sitting but that is because it only takes one to be satisfied."
"This is my favorite general drinking stout. A rich blackness. A crisp roasted barley aroma. Full bodied without being overly sweet. I've always loved the sharp bite from the roasted malts and hop bitterness and how they balance the chocolatey malt. The ethanol is perhaps overly apparent with this beer, but I think that's a defect that adds a little charm. Keeps it from being boring. Same goes for the uncharacteristic aggressive hopping. This is a flavor profile I seek to emulate in my homebrewed stouts"
"(3.7/5)"
"Picked up a six pack for $6.99 at Albertson's in Magnolia WA. Had a few while watching the Seahawks game before Xmas. Poured into a pint glass. Dark black color, like obsidian (to borrow from the name). Brownish white head. Decent lacing. Smelled like roasted barley, and the alcohol was a bit noticeable too. Taste was way above average. Dark, roasted coffee and chocolate flavors abound in this brew. A bit dry in the finish, and like I said, after a few, the alcohol is present. A textbook example of a great stout from an excellent American brewer."
"taste is much better, hoppy for an american stout, huge malt flavor as well, dark viscous, truely the best non imperial stout i have ever had, i look forward to having this in the bottle form."
"Drinkability is dangerously high. If you like American stouts, this is one of the best, period. The fact they they can maintain such a luscious mouthfeel in the bottle is a true testament to their skill. A masterpiece."
"Side note, their bottles have some nice ornamentation."
"Pours jet black with a decent tan head. Nice lacing. Aroma is thick with coffee and malt. The flavor is very smooth, the bitter coffee and chocolate is balanced nicely with the roastiness of the malt. Avoids the soy-sauce bite. Good hop bitterness as well. A very good stout."
"A solid stout, especially creamy and full bodied. Nothing really stands out for me, but its still a damn good offering non the less."
"Overall impression: I have always loved this stout, but I must admit looking at this with a critical eye there ARE better stouts out there. It's aggressive though and despite the abv of 6.4%, it has an almost Imperial stout quality and the bitterness characteristic of a West Coast brew. Locally this is reasonably priced and the lower abv allows it to be an excellent session stout."
"Some friends whose palates I admire (AKBelgianBeast, for example) just don't like this one, for whatever reason. I do. It is not a Speedway or Abyss or Berzerker, by any stretch, but it is a great, blue collar stout in my book. Even way out in rural Alaska, 90 miles by sea from the distributor in Juneau, I can get a sixer for as little as $7 sometimes. $8.50 this time."
"D - This is a absolute drinker for sure. Great flavor, buttery smooth and superb balance."
"Notes: Another delicious offering from Deschutes Brewery. A rich, creamy, flavorful stout that tastes great and is incredibly smooth. Easy to drink and a pleasure at that. This is one that I have made a regular in my beer diet. A truly delicious American-style stout that I thoroughly enjoy(and quite often at that)."
"D: gotta love it! great brew and easy drinker. Nice flavors throughout"
"D: This is a very flavorful stout. Quite drinkable."
"D: Again, it is a nice departure from the strong smoke and bitter coffee flavors of a lot of stouts and is quite drinkable for a stout."
"d. definitely drinkable, and I thoroughly enjoyed the bottle. This one has a bit of uniqueness that separates it from the generic stout, but that also makes it a bit strong in flavor to drink a ton of - it begins to wear at the tastebuds in a good way... the sweet, sour, roasted, and burnt flavors are incredible but take a turn away from sessionability in my mind. Definitely worth trying if you have the chance, if nothing else than do see what a stout has the ability to be. This one nears an Imperial Stout in the best ways."
"Pours a deep opaque black with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is an abundance of roasted black malts with espresso and cocoa notes. The taste is a nice abundance of fresh espresso, cocoa and a plethora of roasted malts. The beer is crisp and light with decent carbonation, very smooth drinking. This is certainly an enjoyable stout, one that I would love to see here on the east coast."
"Pours a midnight black, with some faint brownish highlights, foamy mocha colored head fading very slowly, with just a few spots of lacing left in the glass. Lots of milk chocolate in the nose, faint coffee, and nice burnt/charred edges. Taste follows right along, just the perfect amount of sweetness, nothing overly bitter. Creamy mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation. This is just plain delicious, and drinkability is completely off the map. Extremely impressive stout."
"Good beer. I'd drink it again, happily."
"I'm sorry, Deschutes, I really tried. It's me, not you."
"Taste- Mouth feel is full crisp from the carbonation. Dark malts produce a sweet creamy, roasted coffee taste and bitterness (burnt coffee flavor) with the combination of hops. There is a slight alcohol taste mixed in here also. This beer has become a current favorite of mine and I highly recommend this bier to friends and fellow members and bier drinkers."
"Pours dark brown with three fingers of chocolaty,chunky head that leaves some massive Swiss cheese lacing as is drops at a snails pace. The nose is caramely with some light roasted coffee aromas. This Stout is rich and full of bitter chocolates and burnt coffee,some good hoppy bitterness on the tail. The body is full and just rite for my liking,this is a bit dry,and could use a touch more creaminess,but overall is a great stout with lots of character to spare. Very quaffable and a great example of the style."
"Pours a solid black with a thin tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a roasty chocolaty affair with some dried fruit and a touch of hop aroma for good measure. Taste follows the smell, but lingers with a bit of ash in the finish. Full body, creamy texture, ample carbonation. If not for the ash in the finish I'd love this beer. As is its still good, just not spectacular."
"Despite the darkness and abv this is easily a session beer and a regular purchase of mine, just took forever to get around to reviewing it."
"Obsidian pours a dark brown almost black color, only a small slice of a ruby red highlight peaks through at the bottom of the glass. It sports a small tan head that dissipates rather quickly. Its got a big nose of roasted chocolate malt, and semi sweet coffee beans. This beer is a roasted master piece, an awesome caliber of malt quality shines through right away followed by hints of caramel and coffee. A great, balancing, hop character on the finish and a bready yeast character. Its got a smooth medium body, slightly sticky and excellent drinkability. Awesome beer, wish i could get it here in NJ!"
"Drinkability: A very drinkable stout. So smooth and silky that you immediately crave another."
"Bottle courtesy of secret santa: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a huge medium brown foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of dry coffee with some roasted malt and black chocolate is very enticing. Taste is also a well balance mix between some black chocolate, dry coffee and roasted malt. Body is full with a perfect creamy texture and good carbonation. I very much enjoyed this beer from a brewery that I am starting to learn about."
"In the mouth it's medium-full, not super-chewy but great for style with enough carbonation to keep things in line. Great American stout, I'm sad I've not had it until now."
"D - Pretty good stout honestly. I prefer less dark bitter coffee, but I know that's exactly what a lot of stout lovers are looking for so I can't fault it for that."
"Thanks Daniela for bringing this back from Portland. Poured oh-so black and beautiful. A lovely looking stout. Bit of hop aroma, roasty aromas for sure. Milky and semisweet flavors, yum. It had a wet almost to porter-ish mouthfeel. High drinkability, only the MF throwing me off a bit. I'd love to have this on draft."
"Another great brew from a, so far, impressive brewery! Thanks again, Bill!"
"Good, but not exceptional."
"overall a drinkable beer. Dark, but not overpowering or overly filling. Something I have drunk before and will drink again."
"D-Man! ""Only"" 6.4% with all of that flavour, it's made year round and ""easily"" accessable! Fine work by the folk at DeSchutes, this is a world class beer. IMHO, this may be one of the best ""everyday"" drinking stouts around."
"Amazing Flavor out of this stout, making it my new go to for stouts, happy to have access out here in hawaii...highly recommend."
"D: Minus being overly hopped, the beer is fairly drinkable. It wouldn't be my first choice as far as American stouts go, but it is still a very drinkable beer. 3.5"
"Drinkability: Very smooth. We were expecting something a little more challenging. We don't have any beef with this stout, however we can't see any reasons to seek it out again."
"As fas as American standard stouts go, this is my favorite."
"D - excellent."
"The flavor is a plethora of dark, rich coffee and chocolate, which coat the palate with a milk-like sweetness before giving way to a dark chocolate and spicy, organic hop bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is uber-creamy, velvety, thick-bodied, and oh so drinkable, but tends to get a little thinner as the nitrogen wears down. All in all, an excellent beer, and one I'm glad I got to try not only straight from the horse's mouth, but on Nitro-tap, too."
"This is Deschutes best ""staple"" beer in my opinion. It pours a nice dark blackish color and has a thick brown head. The nose has roasted malts, dark fruits, coffee and chocolate balanced by bitter floral hops. The taste is also very roasty and sweet with a nice bitterness. Full body goes down well."
"D - This is a tasty, but not overpowering, stout. I'd like to drink another one, but I know that would make me want to drink a third, and then... :-)"
"D: It's a stout through and through. It is easy to drink. I've shared this with friends and I hope to do so again."
"Tasted great with all the coffee-chocolate flavors necessary and at 6.4% this beer is very sessionable.. Excellent beer and I hope anyone who likes stouts gets to try this..."
"D - Pretty good. Worth a try. Worth having again. A decent stout, but far from the best."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours just a shade or two away from being completely pitch black with a nice tan head that provides some solid lacing. The aroma is dark and roasty with a good dose of coffee and chocolate. The taste is very well crafted with dark roasted malts with a good amount of roasted bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation. The drinkability of this stout is off the charts, I would love to be able to throw down a few more of these in one sitting. Overall, Obsidian Stout is a pretty damn tasty stout that is highly recommended."
"D - Good brew, easy to drink and a decent ABV that allows you to have several without going too out of control. Lighter aspect is welcome for a good stout to have on a hot day like today."
"Not as well balanced as the Cadillac Mountain Stout but still delicious."
"Drinkability - not one to hoard, but I like it."
"D- Good flavor, but could use a powerboost. This is almost a session stout- the right flavors with not a lot of alcohol and fairly drinkable- granted it's a little high in alcohol for that, but hopefully that gives you a good idea of how the beer tastes."
"Obsidian Stout's a very impressive beer. In my opinion, it'd be a little better if the roasted malts were toned down and the body were thickened a bit. But, it's packed with flavor and really is an enjoyable beer. It's been a treat. Thanks again, Adam."
"Taste is strongly roasted but also has some woody burnt aspect, all malt taste with some coffee-ness, assertive carbonation, smoothness is a bit rough but decent."
"Decent stout very drinkable looking forward to the Abyss"
"Nitro tap at Papago, in Scottsdale, AZ. Appearance is a dark brown with an inch of tan head, leaving a thick lacing on the glass. Smells mildly of chocolate, coffee, and roasted nuts, and tastes a it smells, except for the fact that the flavors are mild compared to what I taste out of the bottle. The bartender told me it might have been put on the nitro-tap by mistake, but he wasn't sure. At any rate, it's got a silky creamy smooth mouthfeel and very drinkable, but the flavors are a notch less than I'm used to from this beer."
"Overall a really nice, sessionable stout. Clean, with strong flavors, well-rounded, everything a stout should be."
"D: Great big beer taste without the drunken lawn mover ride to the store to get more! Seriously great beer. On nitro tap this would be sublime."
"Overall not too bad of a brew."
"D- Pleased to be traveling through Deschutes distribution-land. Would be drinking this A LOT if it were available at home."
"D: As I said before the drinkability is not affected by the heaviness and it goes down really well. The taste and smell leaves you wanting more which can be very dangerous at the bar. I really enjoyed this one and looking forward to our next meeting."
"D Good, but the mouthfeel is nothing special. Also the alcohol presence is slightly alarming in a 6.4 beer."
"Delicate aroma of roasted malts and chocolate, opening to a smooth taste of roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. It is very nice, well balanced, but lacks some ""edge""."
"I'm sure this will go excellently with the fudge walnut brownie that I have sitting beside it. A very nice beer from Deschutes that I'm happy to have tried!"
"A malty, toasty stout, this one poured black as midnight in the glass with a two-finger chocolate head. The aroma wasn't quite there, much more subtle than I was expecting. This is also more of a dry stout, tasting of dark roasted coffee more than anything else. Perfect hop balance, and finishes pretty quick. This one lacks some of the hints of fruit I generally prefer in stouts, but not going to hold that against Deschutes. This is a nice beer."
"The taste leaves little to the imagination though. Like the nose, it gives the impression of an impy stout, a big beefy flavor but without the massive body, abv, etc, as if it were a super drinkable tongue lasher. There is plenty of roasted, toasted, deliciously whoppin malts, a very nice bitter hop counterpoint and some fruit, a bit of full roast coffee. Very, very nice. The mouth is full but not overwhelming, nice and smooth and easy to drink, its just a fantastic stout, kind of the little brother of their Abyss, but no underachiever itself."
"D - overall a good stout but not one that really left me wanting another one. have to say I was a bit disappointed by this one and just thought it would have been a bit better. Plus, something in the aftertaste makes me not really want to have another one either and I think it maybe that the hops seems to linger and leave a bit of an odd feeling in the mouth."
"The taste was rich, complex and satisfying. It left a nice bitterness in finish. It was a sweet malty in the front. You gotta love the work they are doing in Bend and this is another example."
"Pours a deep dark chocolate with nice initial head and great lacing. Smell is a ricjh blend of coffee, burnt malt and hops. Taste follows a similar pattern with the balance of malt and hops doing quite well. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth, rich and chewy. Easy on the drinkability scale...smooth yet with a light dry finish."
"One of my favorite local brews."
"Many thanks to Dnichols for this fine brew! Poured from bottle into a tulip glass. Beautiful dark black with touches of light around the edges. Huge tan foamy head that left tons of lacing. wonderful roasted coffee and slight smoke smell. I have to take a while to enjoy the look of this beer before drinking. Taste if full and tremendous. Hints of chocolate and/or coffee. I really cant tell as they blend together and make for a really satisfying full flavored stout. This is not thin or crisp. It does a slight bitter finish which makes it easy to drink, I feel. This may be the perfect beer to drink by the fire on a cold night!"
"Very robust. Drinks bigger than you would think - after being on a Imperial Stout kick, I figured a stout at 6.4% would be a session beer. Not quite the case. Alcohol gets warming and more noticeable midway through. High roasted character and astringency takes a notch or two away from the drinkability. Nice solid stout."
"Streams out of the bottle an even pitch blackness settling into my Maudite glass. Builds a two finger deep chocolate brown head that hosts fuzzy bubbles that leave lace as they disapate. Nose consists of smokey malt and soured toffee sense. Maybe even some dark fruit sweetness. Dark alchol soaked cherries wraped in coco grace the tongue on first sip. A clean biscuit like richness fills the mouth joined by dark malt and slight spiceyness. An slmost phenol like sweetness develops on the back of the tonguw as this one warms a bit. Mouthfeel is a soft mix of richness and dark bitter. This stout is not to big to really enjoy drinking."
"Drinkability: Nothing objectionable here.... good solid American Stout. I never thought that I'd say THIS: But this beer could use just a touch more carbonation."
"Overall an excellent beer that I would definitely buy again. Deschutes Brewery has several good beers and this is my favorite so far. Try their Black Butte Porter as well"
"Another highly anticipated brew from Geoff aka SurlyDuff, thanks man. Appearance, this one absolutely absorbs all light it fades to black as soon as the stream of carbonation bubbles rise to the top to form a huge moccha tan textured head like whipped cream it rises a good inch above the rim of my glass, awesome appearance. As the head dwindles even fine lacing is left evenly behind in an annular ring like pattern. Aroma is full of dark creamy yet mildly acidic coffee roasts, dark chocolate strong herbal hop leaf approach as well. Awesome creamy robust roasted malt layers with a fine herbal hop aroma. Flavors blend poetically, a beautiful clash of cream caramel and mild toffee liqueur with brash dark roasted malts bringing burnt toast, chocolate, and robust espresso to the mix. Mouthfeel is medium bodied doesn't way you down at all drinks like a light beer easy moderate carbonation yet a bitter dry roasty finish makes it all so good velvety smooth on the palate. Drinkability is amazing the most flavorful session beer I've come across this one brings out Imperial stout like flavors with out crushing your skull beautiful beer I plan to get some more. Whether friends or liquid solutions.com thanks Matt Maples."
"D: great tasty stout with great hop bite finish. only thing I could ask for is to be a little thicker on the mouth feel."
"Black oily pour with a fluffy tan head. Rich roasty and chocolate smell mostly, with a touch of hops. As one rater noted, it was nice and roasty without any burnt smells (or tastes). Taste was beautiful on first sip. Creamy, chocolately, perfectly bittersweet roasty goodness with a nice amount of hop bitterness. Perfectly light to medium carbonation, and an solid slightly thick mouthfeel and flavor. Goes down easily and smooth, and leaves me wanting more. Definitely a great stout, and worth going out of the way for."
"I expected more from this beer because of the reviews and all of the talk, but it really didn't do much for me. I honestly expected a lot more, but it really didn't do much for me."
"I really like this beer! On sale at $5.99 a six-pack it is really a bargain in this age of $6 to $15 bombers. Very drinkable (I'm on my 3rd of the evening). Very well balanced without any one flavor dominating the taste. One of my regulars!"
"I like this beer a lot. The milkiness of it is awesome. I could easily make a session out of this."
"Drinkablity: A solid stout, very enjoyable."
"100th review - Served in a standard pint glass (thanks msubulldog25). Poured an opaque black; zero light penetration. Luscious coffee-colored three-fingered head with excellent retention that left behind concentric bands of thick sticky lacing during the tasting. Scent out of the bottle was coffee and malt (in glass was much more diffuse). Taste similar to nose with roasted coffee flavors much more pronounced; slightly burnt/astringent aftertaste lingers at the finish. Mildly effervescent and full-bodied mouthfeel (not as chewy as an RIS, but you definitely know it's there). Very drinkable and would be a regular if it was locally available."
"I find this is a very versatile stout that goes well with food or holds its own alone. Here in Oregon it is ridiculously affordable and easy to find. All that together makes this one of the most drinkable brews around. Keep it up, Deschutes!"
" This is a wondeful Stout, the moderate ABV makes this very drinkable, but the quality is very high and very clean. If you like stout's you're going to want another."
"d: Highly drinkable. Very good stout. More hop bitterness than most, tons of malt, good stuff."
"D. while not a session beer, it's fantastic for a one or two a nighter. all in all a very good try"
"A nice beer. I have been hitting the stouts pretty hard lately and this was no slouch."
"This is one hell of a stout. I've been impressed with every Deschutes offering I've had and I wish I could get my hands on them more easily. Awesome brew that I'd stock my fridge with if I could."
"Within months of the best by date. The blue packaging currently depicted is out of date. An opaque darkness in the glass, but you can see through the pour. I nice fluffy tan head that fades to sticky lacing patterns. The smell is similar to the last bunch of Stouts that I've sampled in that the aroma through the head is different than the surface smell. An agitated whiff reveals a creamy alcohol, like a barrel aged treated product, dark chocolate and caramel that is altogether creamy. Closer to the surface exposes a roasted malt and coffee notes. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is medium, but the rich full flavors take you to a heavier place. The flavor is special. A creamy, milky semisweet lightly roasted malt with subtle chocolate and a perfect little grainy coffee and alcohol flavor that lingers really nicely. This is an easy drinker. I'm surprised how much of the 6.4% ABV that you sense in the nose and taste but it's all a pleasure! Highly recommended. Shout out to drumrboy22 for the opportunity."
"The body is good with more of a mid than full feel. Even with the astringent bite there is a sweetness that stays even after tasting. A nice stout found in liquor store, but not sure if naturally occurring or not."
"M/D: Full bodied and wow, what a smooth, full body. Carbonation does nothing but lend to a smooth, creamy, velvety body. Drinkability is top notch. It's just so damn smooth and easy drinking. By far the best of the style I've ever tasted."
"I can drink several of these in a sitting, definitely sessionable for a 6+% beer."
"drinkability this beer is smooth, and tasty. unlike some other thick and sweet beers it is easy to drink a few of these at a time which is usually good."
"M/D: Carbonation is great, body is rich enough to support the big flavors. Easy to have several in a sitting."
"Big flavor of strong coffee and unsweetened chocolate, a good roasted malt, and a sightly bitter hop presence. The mouthfeel and body are both fine. This is a fine Stout, Deschutes Brewery are to be commended for taking on such a challenge."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Chimay Chalice. Poured a dark black with light mahogany tones around the edges when held up to the light. Had a thin mocha head that vanished quickly. Taste is roasted malts, dark chocolate, and creamy coffee. There is a slight astringent taste at the finish. Mouthfeel is more medium bodied then full with just a little carbonation. One of the better stouts on the market."
"Thanks for the trade on this Dan!"
"Overall- This stuff is good!! 1 of the best stouts I can recall!!"
"A fantastic stout that fits my preferences nicely. It really tastes like dessert with it's cookie sweetness. Thankfully it's not overly sweet and there's just enough bitterness and malt heft to round it all out. I used to think I preferred especially roasted tasting stouts, but this has shown me I can really enjoy maltier ones too. It's a nicely done stout, and one I wish was readily available."
"Two finger mocha head. Aroma of chocolate and coffee. Taste is well balanced. Smooth. Creamy...very nice mouthfeel. If this was local to me I could see making it a go to beer. Good stout."
"Deep black in color. Quite the nice cocoa head on top. Ok aroma-not much there. Some roasted malt-somewhat metallic. Heavy roasted flavor. Mild espresso tinge to it. Soft, cocoa taste. Very clean in the finish. Good solid body. Very, very drinkable and enjoyable. I could see this being a regular for me if I could get it all the time."
"All in all, a great brew."
"Pours a pitch black color with a tan head that settles fairly quickly. Aroma is highly roasted, heavy notes of coffee and touches of cocoa. Flavor is chock full of roasted malt goodness, along with lots of unsweetened chocolate type flavor. Mouthfeel is very smooth, some carbonation is noted on the finish, but nothing to write home about."
"This drinks good."
"No doubt, this is my favorite ""locally available"" American stout.. and it is exactly what I expect out of Deschutes and other PNW breweries... bigger is sometimes better..."
"Pours such a black as night color with plenty of bubbling two inch tall head. The once bubbly head fades away and leaves plenty of lacing clinging to the side of my snifter. Smell is doughy and dried fruit with chocolate notes. Smell is not quite black licorice but more of a slight anise smell. This one started out strong but there was not a lot of flavor here. Some chocolate, coffee but it is all muted. Mouthfeeling is way too carbonated and makes this one not very drinkable. I had such high hopes for this beer coming from the makers of The Abyss."
"I agree with the akbelgianbeast, extremely overrated. it starts off with hints of epoxy, maybe some asphalt, the middle and finish have the taste and texture of some low-end cheap hairspray, and that nasty array of not so nice flavors lingers for far too long, this brew is definitely the shame of the DeSchutes line-up. bahh!"
"I cannot beleive this ranks in the 90's. An irishmen would ponder suicide if he drank this beer. It pours black and promising, the nose is standard for an american stout. The first sip has notes of black tar. Followed by a sweet sort of hairspray middle rounding out in a monarch vodka flavor. To me this beer is extremely overrated. If its your thing, then more power to you, but if you like true irish dry stout or american oatmeal stout then this beer is not for you. Give this beer to someone you hate for christmas. Or be nicer and give them some natty ice."
"Roasted dark malt and a nice hoppy bitterness mixed with dark bittersweet chocolate on the tongue. Creamy and smooth. Very drinkable. Reminds me of an oatmeal stout in terms of drinkability and mouthfeel. Not overly thick, but it does stand up the 20 degrees outside that we're sitting through. Finishes dry and nicely bitter. The hops definitely comes out more at the end of the beer. Nicely done."
"D: Extremely drinkable. Holy hell this could be my go-to stout if they sold it in Boston. It's an excellent brew!"
"Heard so much about this I finally had to try. Poured into chalice, nice and dark, all but black, with nice two finger light brown head, good lacing. Smell is of toasted grains with a slightly burnt touch, coffee, and dark chocolate. Taste is pretty much the same. Very nice blend of dark chocolate, coffee, toasted grain, some dark malts. Very complex yet suprisingly smooth. One thing I did like is that the mouthfeel wasnt too heavy. Some stouts its like drinking motor oil, this was a little lighter and easier to drink. While it doesnt stand out as an amazing beer, it is a very good one."
"Mouthfeel is medium, a little thin for me. Easy to drink. A very solid stout."
"I used to drink this all of the time out of the bottle, and I thought it was prety decent. Much better on nitro-tap, and normally I prefer regular taps over nitro but this beer really benefits from the extra creaminess imparted. Pours black with a huge creamy head and phenomenal lacing. The smell has a verylight aroma of cream and some relatively light roastiness. The flavors of light roastines, huge creaminess, lingering licorice bitterness, and touch of malty sweetness are very well integrated and balanced. Delicious. Super creamy, easy-drinking mouthfeel, somewhat light but easy going. I always thought this beer was a little overrated, having it this way changed my mind."
"Thanks Younger35 for another fine Deschutes brew."
"Overall: Probably the best made standard American Stout on the market. Insane drinkability for the style. Always a pleasure to have. Highly recommended."
"D: Could do one or two at a sitting I am classifying this as a great nightcap drink to be savored rather than an all out session."
"D: Exceptional drinkability. An easy drinking and incredibly smooth beer to go along with all the big and great stout flavors."
"d: I really wish Deschutes' beers were available in my area. This was damn tasty and I hope to have another one day."
"D - A good stout that I could drink all night."
"I first encountered Deschutes beers in Washington DC in 2001 when I stopped at the Brickskellar and at Chevy Chase Wine and Liquors. Chevy Chase charged $14.99 for a six pack of Deschutes beer. Unfortunately, I've not seen this beer in DC since 2001. I've had to depend on a schoolteacher friend bringing some of this beer back from the western US when he vacations there."
"Pours a pitch black color with a tan head that settles fairly quickly. Aroma is highly roasted, heavy notes of coffee and touches of cocoa. Flavor is chock full of roasted malt goodness, along with lots of unsweetened chocolate type flavor. Mouthfeel is very smooth, some carbonation is noted on the finish, but nothing to write home about. Fans of ""stouts"" could easily make this a go to beer. Out here it's available everywhere, and even on nitro in select places. I'm honestly surprised i've not reviewed it up till now, as i've probably had it at least a dozen times."
"I picked up a 6-pack in Vegas as it's not currently distributed to OH. The beer is completely opaque black, with a thin but resilient tan foam. The aroma has plenty of good things going on, dark roasted malt with toasty bread and a hint of cacao. The taste is slightly sweet initially, a little bitter or burnt flavor at the backend. The roasted malts come through big time. All in all a very good stout, one I could easily recommend to anyone."
"I bought this at Liquor Mart in Boulder, CO during a visit to attend the GABF."
"D: If every stout tasted this good I would become a real fan. I love coffee and semi-sweet chocolate and this brew has those flavors in spades. It may be a bit to rich and filling for long sessions but I would like to try."
"Overall, another great beer from Dechutes. I haven't had a beer of theirs I disliked yet."
"I well made beer that i'm lucky to have tried as it's not available in my area."
"I'll be looking for this again on my trips out west. It would certainly be great to have on hand on occasion."
"I believe this is only my second beer from Deschutes (the other being Black Butte Porter) and I wouldn't hesitate in buying either one of them again. Both very good examples in their respective styles."
"Pours pitch black with an impressive mocha colored head which displays excellent retention and leaves webs of sticky lacing in its wake. The aroma is of roasted malts. Chocolate and coffee mingle with overpowered hops. Don't know how else to describe it, but there's a crayon-like aroma in there as well. Taste is lightly sweet at first and then turns deeply bitter. Especially in the back. The bitterness of the coffee flavor and hops combine to create an overall bitterness that hits you from all angles. There's also an earthy wood-like flavor in there. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Abrasiveness builds on the tongue as you dig deeper into the glass. This has been a longtime standby that I will continue to revisit as long as the fine folks at Deschutes keep sending it through the bottling line. A classic."
"Good body, and carbonation. Well balanced. Love the darker fruit flavors in this one, versus the typical coffee or espresso flavors. Nicely done."
"Easier to drink than it should be, this is a really nice stout."
"Thanks to elricorico for the bottle. A great beer which I hope to get more of soon!"
"D: A great American stout, I could drink this all day, one of Deschutes best beers, better than their porter, which is also pretty good, an American classic."
"Had this again and it was not near as good as I remembered it, must have been because I drank a few beers before I tasted this one the first time"
"Considering it can be had for 8.99 a sixpack all over the place, really underappreciated."
"Likely the greatest (American) stout I have ever had. Poured up absolutely black with a bit of a rocky sand coloured head. This is precisley how a stout should look, IMO. Smell was phenomenal. This is the perfect stout smell, to me anyway. Coffee beans, unsweetened baker's chocolate, a bit of a lactic sourness, some smoke, the smell of dried cereals, and perhaps most importantly, it is bereft of any hops at all. At the very least, it is bereft of any cascade, cenntenial, or any other really piney/citrusy hops, anyway. This is a truly great stout. Taste starts out a bit sweet, and then turns dry toward the finish. Flavour profiles include coffee grounds, a bit of caramel, bitter chocolate, and a tiny touch of smoke. Mouthfeel is very solid and heavy. This, to me, is exactly what a good stout should be. Absolutely amazing!"
"D - This is damn good..as far as stouts go I would put this close to the top of the class..for the fan of stouts this is a must"
"Do I have a bad bottle or just not like this beer? It smelled a bit like molasses, and while there was a decent bitterness in the aftertaste, the overall flavor is nothing to brag about. Roasted coffee-like (but not really coffee flavored) grains with a bit of cocoa. I was expecting something exciting like a Shakespeare Stout, but didn't get any depth like that."
"Smooth, creamy, fuller bodied beer. More carbonation than I expected, but it works. Very easy drinking stout. More than one bottle wouldn't be a problem...and that's rare for me and stouts. Hopefully I can get more of this someday."
"Pours an opaque black with a giant chocolate milk head that stays awhile and laces all over. This looks like a big bad stout. Smells of roated barley, caramel, expresso, fruits and some chocolate notes. Tastes silky smooth starting out with some sweet malt with a bitter bite and finishes with cocoa, roasted coffee, nuts and some hops. Feels creamy and smooth in the mouth with little carbonation feel. Alcohol is not detected at all in this. This is an awesome stout that is perfect for sessioning and a must try Oregon delight."
"A very solid stout- pours as black liquid with a very nice tan head. Aromas were cool and clean- very attractive to the stout lover. Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, flowed like liquid silk. There is no unpleasantlness whatsoever, this is an incredibly balanced brew. semi-sweet chocolate malts, slight mocha flavors and earthy, slightly resinous hops round out the sweetness which is minimal and perfectly paired to the style. One of the better american stouts available, as most tend to be extreme in one sense or another, this one knows what is best and sticks to it."
"Drinkability- This is such a terrific stout that I wish I drank more often. It is readily available to me yet I dont enjoy it as often as I should. Such balance and flavors. Its in the same realm as a Imperial Stout with a touch less alcohol which really helps in its drinkability. Awesome!!"
"Tastes amazing: roasted goodness; black coffee with a slight char; very dark chocolate; a little nut. Exceptional mouthfeel -- big body, nice carbonation, dry cocoa finish -- and for a 6+ ABV, this is very sessionable for those who don't mind bitterness. Another feather in the cap of Deschutes, and, in my opinion, one of America's greatest stouts."
"One of the great northwestern stouts. It is entirely black with a silky smooth body and a lush fragrance of coffee and roasted grains. The taste is bold and reliable and finishes with a touch of chocolate. I've never had a bad bottle and it's even better on tap. It pours out with a thick beige head and leaves lots of lace on the glass. Every sip delivers big flavor. I wish every stout was this good."
"Its deep black and has a light tan head that leaves a alot of lace. The aromas are a blend of chocolate, coffee roast, and some deep grain. There are no hop aromas to be found. which is good, and very easy to take. The taste is a perfect balance of the aforementioned aromas but it blends into a sweeter flavor. The chocolate dominates the other two, but it is balanced with the roasty bitterness. There is a real sweet finish, almost a caramel flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth, and doesnt dry out too bad in the end. This is one of the best American Stouts Ive ever had"
"Remined me almost of a dark lager. Like the 3 Dechutes beers i've have all were very drinkable,every day drinkable. Would always keep some in the fridge if avalible locally. Not extreme beers very solid and all well done."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, forming a 1/2"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head is down to a layer of film pretty quick, with ample sticky dark lace. Aroma is dark malts, with touches of hops. Taste meets the nose's indications, and more. Starts with dark grains, some bitterish coffee notes, and then closes pleasantly bitter. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very goodm and I am glad I finally was able to check this one out."
"Pours a complete black letting no light shine through. Full two finger khaki colored head that quickly dies down. Stickiness is insanely good, all over the glass. Smell is a bit dull, not really what I expected. Mild barley and malt with a tiny bit of alcohol. Some toasted nut seems to tingle the nose as well. Taste is a pretty bold flavor of dark coffee and some roasted caramel malt as well. There's a nice hop bite on the tongue that balances this one out quite well. Very strong enjoyable aftertaste of espresso with a hint of caramel. Mouthfeel is very full bodied with a surprisingly good amount of carbonation for this style. Deschutes does an amazing job with this complex brew, represents this style very well. Pick it up if you get the chance."
"This is a very drinkable beer. At 6.4% ABV, maybe a bit too drinkable , if you know what I mean."
"D- It is pretty good. I wouldn't go crazy over it but it is a easy drinking stout."
"i am so happy Deschutes has made the choice to distribute to PA, not only is it great to have beer that brought me to the craft movement, but it is still is of the same quality as when I first enjoyed it almott two decades ago."
"Overall, this beer seemed to be a bit of a disappointment. While many may be attracted to its deep, roasted flavors, I found the bitterness to be too much to handle."
"It pours thick from the bottle into a pint glass with a beautiful contrast of black and tan. There's plenty of roasted barely in this beer, one that's very bitter from the burnt flavors. Pretty drinkable. I had this after eating some greasy pizza, and my palate welcomed the rush of roasted bitterness."
"D - Excellent. One of my favorite Stouts"
"A great straightforward stout, though I slightly prefer Black Butte Porter."
"HmmDamn itIm a convert. Forget what I said about this brews mediocrity. As it warms it just gets better and better. Forget about it. This is great stuffand oh so drinkable. Very well done and deserving of praise. Now, Im off to see a head shrink about my manic beer reviewing tendencies"
"9/1/07: Got another bottle from younger35 and it's just as tasty as the first!"
"D- The bitterness is not distinctly hops and not roasted malt but a blend of the two which is interesting. Nice rich malt flavors make this a full flavored stout."
"Mouthfeel is as smooth as can be with roasted nuts, figs, plums, and mocha standing out along the palate. It reminds me a little of an Irish car bomb minus the Jamison."
"Served at cellar temperature in a snifter. Poured a thick, oily, pitch black. About one and a half fingers of tan slightly coffee brown, pillowy head formed. Had great retention. Slowly faded into a gob of sticky lace in the glass. Had a awesome nose to it. Nice roasted malts, thick chocolate aromas, fresh roasted coffee beans, and maybe a hint of vanilla. Taste was equally as pleasing. Nice roasty, toasty notes. Bitter coffee, bitter chocolate, nice malty flavors, and a small hint of black licorice. Slight alcohol noted in the mouth. Very smooth. Slightly thin in the mouth with a wonderfully full flavor to it. Maybe a little too carbonated for my liking but still damn good. Definitely very drinkable. Would love to get more of this."
"Pours a very opaque black, red edges, thin tan head, settles to a nice ring, lace spots on the glass, looks like a stout. Smell is sweet, toffee and chocolate, some dark fruits, licorice, bit of spice, very malty, the fruitiness adds a different touch. Taste is sweet, chocolate and licorice through the middle, some roast, cherries, toffee, bit of a weak finish but nice flavours in the beginning. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, nice smooth stout. Very drinkable. Thanks Russ!"
"D: This is one of the best stouts I've had. A perfect example of the style."
"Taste is chocolate up front, slightly dry bitter finish, burnt malty notes. Feels thick and slick. Pretty good if dark and bitter are what you want in a stout."
"Thanks, todd1, for the experience"
" Poured out of a bottle into a Chimay chalice. Dark, dark brown, almost black, close to opaque. A thin, swirling head, with little retention on the ring around the edge of the glass. Smell was a little weak for me, perhaps I had a bit of an oncoming cold, but nothing spectacular here. Taste is most excellent. Dark malts, coffee, chocolate, everything you would expect from a stout of this caliber. Mouthfeel is smooth, but dry, very easy going down. If it weren't for the 6-something% abv on this, I could drink this all day. Very drinkable stout and one of my favorites. I think Deschutes gets a bad rap around here because the Mirror Pond and Black Butte are the only widely availabe selections from them and they are a bit weak in all categories. But this is an excellent beer."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark black with a decent tan head. The smell was roasty but subdued. The taste was also standard stout to me: roasty, no hops, good , dark, smooth.this was a nice beer but I don;t think it should be in the top 100."
"D: The ale is easy to drink, with strong roasted dark flavors that never destroy the taste buds."
"Very dark, faint chestnut edges with a fluffy, dark tan head. Plenty of lacing and good head retention. Nice aroma! A mix of roast, cocoa powder, milk chocolate, biscuity malt and a hint of licorice. The flavour's top notch as well. Along with the solid roastiness, there's a lot of anise throughout. Notes of bittersweet chocolate and light fruit round things out. Moderate to low bitterness. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation and a silky texture. Great stout with a nice balance of flavours. Definitely a winner."
"Pours black with red flecks. Big fluffy tan head leaves medium lacing. Aroma promises strong malts: chocolate, meat, pepper, and a relatively noticeable alcohol presence  not especially strong or pleasant smelling. Medium body and a creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is dark roasted malts, very meaty; molasses, walnut, pork loin, and charcoal, with an undertone of acidic grassiness thrown in. A touch of soft-candy sweetness in the finish. Aftertaste is mostly neutral with a hint of bitterness and acidity."
"drinkability is good. well balanced. this is a damn tasty stout that i'd love to have available locally."
"D - For a Stout, it's crazy drinkable. Somehow I don't find Stouts filling, but it's also compliments to Deschutes for making a great, drinkable beer. If I had this on tap at a bar, I would have ordered a second round right from the first sip. The flavors never leave and never tone down. Such an awesome beer on every level. When you find this beer, don't mix it in a six-pack, buy a whole six-pack of it. Biggie goes well with a Stout. Man, I just wrote a short story."
"Opinion: This is a really tasty beer, and I would consider it to be one of the best American Stouts that I have had to date. I like that there is some real depth to the malt so that you don't have a watery beer with hops and roast and that is it. This beer is balanced with all of the components independently noticeable."
"D - Overall this was awesome, the perfect desset beer as a good stout should always be. I found no hint at all of any alcohol, nothing but great aromas and flavors. Very robust, full of complex suprises in flavor and taste. An all around great brew. Definatly lived up to its reputation."
"from babydoc, for my bombing"
"Served in my delirium tremens tulip. Pours a very dark brown with a nice quarter inch head. Nice lacing and froth remains. Smell is roasted malts and cocoa bean. Taste is of bittering coffee bean. The mouthfeel is carbonated and medium in feel. A decent stout from an above average brewery. A good session beer that I would like to have on hand at all times."
"O: One of my favorite stouts of all time; I highly recommend this beer. I first had this beer at the brewery on a family vacation up to Sunriver, Oregon. The brewery's in Bend, an easy 15 minute drive. I buy at least one 6-pack of this a month now that we've finally got a Bevmo near our home. I wish the ABV were lower, because I love to drink this stuff."
"This was part of the I'm Bored Tonight Stout-Off, up against Rogue's Imperial Stout and Bell's Expedition Stout. Pours a deep black with hints of red when swirled. A thin bubbly, tan head forms and then recedes fairly quickly, but leaves a nice bit of lacing behind. The smell is mainly of chocolate, but a dark cocoa kind of chocolate and some whiff of alcohol to it - a roasty, but not smoky, smell. It has a bubbly mouthfeel and goes down nice and easy with a nice roasty-coffee aftertaste. Up front, I don't taste any bitterness and most of the taste is in the aftertaste. Good stuff!"
"D: Overall, this is a damn nice stout. Get some."
"Overall: An amazing, smooth, drinkable stout, an excellent example of the style. Truly one of the best stouts I've had."
"Pours a big giant head that falls, but doesn't break apart and leave. The lacing is strong and the color is black and doesn't let any light through at all. The smell is sooo roasty and coffee. Yeah I get expresso goodness out of the flavor. The flavor is a nice coffee flavor with some dark malts, I like it a lot. The mouthfeel is very nice, very smooth, medium bodied beer. Overall it's nice and drinkable, something to be had on more than one accasion."
"M&D - rather drinkable for such an overwhelming beer, great up front tastes, Deschutes is not kidding around with this brew, they smack you with flavor, a great brew"
"Damn good stout worth drinking if for only the smell. But there are other fish in the sea I'd buy before this stout."
"D: An incredibely drinkable and satisfying stout without the insane alcohol content. Complex for a smaller stout. If not for the difficulty of locating this beer in my region I would make this a regular in my refrigerator."
"Cheers."
"Simply put, my favorite beer. Period. I seriously erred in only bringing back a case. I can't wait until it is available in Kansas - according to the local liquor store web site, they expect shipment in 2008! That will be a great day."
"Very good stout, not on the level of Cadillac Mtn., but excellent nonetheless. I could drink this all night and not get bored."
"App. - 4.0, Smell - 3.5, Taste - 4.0, Mouthfeel - 3.5, Drinkability - 4.5"
"Drinkability: This beer is really good on nitro in my opnion, the creamy mouthfeel softens up a really tasty but harsh brew, it makes it easier to drink and delicious. Looks like Guinness and a lot of flavor."
"This one is so Black though. I like a nice malty blackness and this one serves me right."
"Overall, this beer surprised me, I was not looking for such a complicated and masterful brew, One of the best stouts I've had in a while."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Imperial pint glass. Appears a very dark brown, opaque, with two fingers of deep tan head which leaves a nice lacing from start to finish. Smells of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and dried fruit. Taste is of roasted nuts, hops, unsweetened cocoa, dark malts. Medium bodied and complex. Very nice . I'll have another..."
"This is about as good as a stout can be without being taken to the Imperial level."
"Drinkability: Overall definitey deserving of its high rating, and one of the finest examples of the style I've ever tried. The ABV sneaks up on you a bit, as I found myself going through a six-pack fairly quickly before slowing myself down."
"One of the highlights of a truly generous BA Secret Santa 2006 package, this bottle came to me courtesy of b0ldfacelies -- many thanks for the opportunity. Beautiful raised hop vine design between the neck and the body of a very tastefully designed and informative label. Best by date of August 19 2006, so it's a bit old, but at 6.4% abv, I'm sure this has held up well. Poured into a nonic this stout sports an impenetrable brown-black, burnished and burnt chocolate body with deep russet and burgundy highlights and a sizeable and luxuriously dense, crater-pocked beige head. The nose is dark fruits at first, with dried cherry essence, Black Mission Fig juice, and stewed prunes coming through most strongly. Subsequent sniffs yield aromas of dark-roasted grain and caramel toffee. Then a mocha-coffee scent emerges as it warms. Interesting smell for a non-Imperialized stout! The first sip of this stout screams perfection. Without a doubt. Chewy, surprisingly viscous body with an amazing nearly-burnt roasted quality to the grain flavors that never becomes too bitter because of a lucious black cherry nectar and toffee-chocolate truffle taste that emerges at the finish, which ends in a powerfully bittersweet medicinal flourish. Much heavier on the palate than most representatives of the style. I'd usually find this distracting, but with the utterly fascinating flavor profile of this beer, I can't help but consider the heavier-than-usual weight to be a simple reassertion of the overall force of this masterful stout. I want more."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is loaded with roasted flavors. The beer has a low carbonated medium body. This is a dam fine beer and I would definately have it again."
"Merry Christmas to me. A great brew!"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling for a stout, this is one of those beers that can be both a good sipper and a good pounder."
"Bitter coffee, a hint of chocolate, a splash of citrus trying to make itself heard, more chocolate, like a milkshake...and so damned creamy and smooth. As I said, marvelous."
"Thanks to flexabull for this!"
"A rich and creamy brew, the charcoal toast intermixed well with the previous mentioned aspects. Body was dry and gritty, just an all-round good quaffing brew"
"D: A session stout at it's finest even with the slightly higher abv. Smooth and silky, this brew has what it takes."
"The drinkability is very good, I will drink what I have sparingly and seek out more. A huge double thanks to Fartingdog for a great trade. Prosit MK"
"Very drinkable treat. Easily great session fare on a fall or winters eve. Even light bodied enough for year round enjoyment. Would also be a great stout to introduce rookie stout drinkers to. Would gladly drink again, but unfortunately not available in my neck of the woods."
"Session worthy stout. I've had this on nitro before, and that is a real treat!"
"Mouthfeel is good, little thin, good body, but less than optimal. Drinkability is very good, so smooooth. Its not only an excellent example of American Stout, but just a damn tasty beer. I'm going to start calling my liver ""the place Deschutes beers go to die""."
"This is a fine stout and quite easy to consume. If I could, I would make this a staple beer in my fridge."
"D: Just a terrific stout...I'm fortunate to live in Oregon where I can get this one anytime. It's been a while since I've had this, I'd forgotten how delicious Obsidian is. Highly reccommended."
"- Great Winter Beer; good with stew or steak."
"Palate started out kind of thin, but it was too cold, got better as it warmed. awesome"
"A great stout from Deschutes."
"Overall: I like this beer. I will probably buy it more often."
"12 ounce bottle."
"I thought this rather tasty and a great representation of the style."
"The taste is good. It's smooth as glass, thanks to the cask-conditioning. Just like obsidian, this stout is one slick, black treat."
"Hands down, one of the best, if not the best, stout I've had...this is up there with the Imperial Stouts in my mind. After a agonizingly slow pour, with the last drizzles of the 12oz bottle oozing out like oil, it left a jet black color with a dense, 2.5 finger tan head. Beautiful. Aroma is very complex with blends of sweetness, alcohol notes, roasted maltiness, coffee, chocolate, a very pleasing mixture. The taste is just as complex as the aroma, but bordering on perfection. First impression is a biting tingling on the tongue with a slight bitterness that fades into a robust earthy toasted malt with splashes of coffee, chocolate and a finishing mild bitterness. And afterall that you have an aftertaste of roasted nuttiness. As it warms it gets even more complex....excellent. Mouthfeel is good, creamy, and complete. I successfully sessioned this at a bbq recently and would recommend to anyone who likes stouts that this is about as easy drinking as it gets :)"
"From a 12oz bottle. A deep opaque black with a bubbly thin head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is of roasted and black malts, and maybe cascade hops?, somewhat musty/sour. Taste is of heavy rostiness and coffee. Not too viscous, but has nice body. Carbonation is about medium. The flavor definitely carries this one with strong coffee character along with a fairly mild bitterness."
"D - Very drinkable. An very tasty stout from Deschutes, highly recommended."
"On Nitro... Nice buubbly nitro head that slowly joins the black goodness below. Very gentle smell that does not beat you over the head with over strong scents, but ones that entice you to find what lurks witthin the glass before you. The nitro gives a smoothness that unveeils the flavors before you with chocolate, burnt caramel and a softly balanced bitterness in its aftertaste. Having this on Nitro is a real treat for any stout lover. It takes an amazing stout and just brings it up to that...holy jeez I cant even believe how good this is level. Great in the bottle...un-believable on Nitro."
"Building on this theme, Mouthfeel is pleasantly viscous yet quaffable. Awesome drinkability - two bottles (or pints) are almost a given with this beer. My favorite everday stout and quite a bargain at just over a buck a bottle."
"Superb drinkability. Low alcohol and lots of flavor. Mouthfeel isn't over the top so this one goes down a bit too easily. Definately one of the best standard stouts I've had to date. A must try to see how a stout should be made."
"Pitch black in color, with an amazingly frothy, mocha colored head, about 3/4 of an inch in height. Decent retention, leaving a good amount of delicate lacing. Mostly smells of dark chocolate, espresso, hints of dark fruits and some sort of musty smell. Tastes pretty much the same as it smells. Quite delicious! A good balance of hops and malts, finishes clean. Very creamy and smooth, and not too heavy. This is a pretty awesome beer. Super easy too drink and very refreshing. A great example of an American stout. I hope I can trade for more of this. Seek this one out!!!!"
"roasted and chocolaty malts in the flavor with a bitter, smoky, lingering finish. medium body with a medium-high carbonation; seems like it should have a bit more weight to it. flavors are passable but stiffly bitter finish hurts the drinkability."
"Good stuff."
"This is a well made beer, and I can see why it's rated highly, but I can't get past the lactose flavor. I prefer more roastiness from my stouts."
"I can see why this is near the top of it's class."
"D- The burnt malt bitterness may be a bit hard to take sometimes, but if you can handle it, this is a lovely beer. The afterthoughts are just as good as the aftertaste."
"Its all here flavorwise. Roasted malts rule the roost, with the subsequent coffee, chocolate and licorice coming through periodically. Mildly bitter in a dark chocolate sort of way. Very delicious and chewy. Came off slightly heavy bodied. However, for some reason, it went down way too fast--happy I was given two bottles to enjoy. I see now why this one gets rated so highly."
"Good drinkability, but is a bit too sweet for have more than a few IMO."
"This is one hell of an impressive brew."
"Bottom line: One of my favourite American Stouts out there. I highly recommend it!"
"Drinkability: this is the example of a liquid meal. Very flavorful and these can be quaffed for a while. This beer should be had by everyone."
"Drinkability: Very good, well above average. I only wish that this beer was available here."
"One thing for sure: Next time you're at your favorite venue, demand the obsidian be put on nitro!"
"This was really a GOOD stout. Poured jet black with thin tan head and okay lacing. Aroma was that of chocolate mixed with dark fruit..grapes, plums, cherries. Taste was very much chocolate malt. As beer warmed, alcohol became more noticeable about mid-glass, but perfectly blended with the flavor. Very good, long, smooth finish. This has to be my favorite stout to date....just sorry I cant readily obtain in GA"
"D: Although I was dissapointed (I think it tastes better w/o the nitro) it still was a great beer and I orderered another as soon as I was finished with the first. The Next time I go to the store I'l pick up a sixpack and review this again."
"Notes: Well it hit my palate just right. For the price???? WOW!! How can this be priced similar to their small beer offerings. Deschutes is amazing in that they have good beers and at times in the excellent to outstanding range, yet they maintain a low price by craft brew standards."
"I have yet to see this beer offered in Chicago, but will not hesitate to order a case from my local retailer if they can fulfill a special order."
"Great drinkability."
"Really smooth drinking stout here that just gets better the more that you drink it. This beer strikes a nice balance between interesting and mild to drink just about perfectly."
"My bottle looks different than the one in the picture, but it's definitely Deschutes Obsidian Stout. So here we go. Pours a deep opaque black, just faint hints of ruby around the edges. Thin light-ish brown head. Smells deeply toasty and sweet, just a hint of the charcoal bite. Mmm! Incredibly rich chocholate espresso flavor; roasty and vinous with a fizzy bitterness that balances the slight sweetness perfectly. I never know quite what to say about drinkability with American stouts; I haven't met an American session stout yet. But I'd love to sit around and drink this all night if it wouldn't fill me up after just a couple."
"D: Not an overly complex beer, but still has a very nice flavor."
"Slàinte!"
"Drinkability is high. If you want a stout this would surely please you in every way you could hope for. I get the feeling someone worked very hard on this recipe because ever aspect of this beer strives for greatness, and pleases on nearly every level. Another fantastic job by Deschutes."
"Thanks Clvand0."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with plenty of carbonation. For a stout this is pretty darn drinkable."
"Creamy mouthfeel, tasty, great nightcap, dessert material. Actually a few of these would be a nice meal in itself. This brewery has yet to dis-appoint, another top notch selection from Deschutes."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability? I don't think that is a fair question for either this style or this particular beer. It is satisfying in itself...in the single glassful. I'm drinking this while eating a brownie and believe me, one could want for nothing else. The perfect ending to a wonderful meal."
"Pours a dark brown to black as it settles into the glass. I understand the ""obsidian"" part of this one; wow! A 2cm frothy, tan head w/ ruby hues settles nicely atop of the body. Very sticky to the glass. Aroma is mainly of mocha and cocoa. I also find some slight fruit (rasberry) and even some roasty malt in there. I get a rasberry chocolate icecream aroma mainly. Maybe even some grains (oats). Very brilliant! Sipping it, I first notice the creaminess of it really. Full body with a slight tingly carbonation on the tip of my tongue, but the smooth body takes over quickly. At first I can taste the rasberries along with a big roasty malt. Some mocha coffee comes through as well, and the end is balanced out nicely by bitterness of the hops, which are just slightly grassy or a bit of pine. Long lasting aftertaste of mocha coffee and hops. Very nice! The ending is creamy, and is a great winter brew IMO. I could drink this a whole lot! Very nice!!!"
"Drinkability is good nice coffee flavors and nice lingering hop flavors. Thanks to BCG BIF and babydoc for this bottle."
"Final thoughts - you might like this one right away, you might not - I wasn't sure, until I got a few pints in, but as it turns out, it's as great a stout as any. A very roasty stout."
"D: Overall, obsidian is a very tasty stout, very drinkable."
"The smell is dominated by roasted malts. The taste brings more roasted malt up front with a touch of smoke flavor. Hops come through in the finish and leave a long taste of bitterness. The mouthfeel is pretty full, while drinkability is great for the alcohol content."
"Flavor is thick and mighty. Medium roast coffee wuickly followed with some dark chocolate. Carbonation kind of sparkles on the tongue. Slight hop-piney bitterness towards the end. Even reminds me just a bit of spearmint candy for some reason. Lots of burnt and toasted malts in hte flavor. Even a bit dry in the finish. Really nice slow sipping beer that I struggled to sip slowly."
"NOTE: The label has apparently been redesigned since the BA picture was posted. It might be worthy of an update? I think I like the new packaging better."
"Drinkability: This would be in my regular rotation if it were available. A nice example of the style."
"Drinkable, it is. This beer has grown on me greatly. The first half of my glass just failed to wow me. The second half impresses me. I have to take this beer as a whole though. Some movies start slow but have a hell of a finish this Stout falls into that category. It leaves me on a positive note but the first impression cant escape my memories either. All in all, this is clearly a well-brewed beer. I like it. I purchased a couple bottles from Liquid Solutions. I am happy I finally got to try this stalwart of BA Top 100 beers. Worth a try."
"As it pours the head takes time to develop. It expands into only a small crust on top, the color of the foam being a very reddish brown/tan. It then dissipates pretty quickly also. The beer color is very dark black, not much light penetrates. The smell is amazingly smoky and burnt, with maybe a hint of chocolate. Taste is more smokiness, reminiscent of a campfire. Burnt coffee flavors are present also before the right amount of bitterness shines through at the finish. For a stout, it's not real thick, the carbonation is low but adequate. Suprisingly drinkable beer, maybe because its not too strong or chewy like some in its class."
"Pours a dark brown color with a tall tan head that has nice retention and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. Just how a stout should look. The aroma is comprised of lots of chocolate notes with small hints of roasted malts and plenty of malty goodness. Promising. The flavor follows suit with the aroma. Lots of chocolate malty flavors along with some roasted notes. This beer is extremely smooth and creamy. Very very tasty beer. Nothing is offensive and everything blends well."
"This is an extremely well balanced stout. It looks good too. Pours almost back with a medium brown head that lasted to the end, leaving a touch of lacing on the side of my pint glass on the way down. Smell is mostly of dark chocolate but is rather delicate, almost too slight, but still very nice. The taste starts with strong coca notes but seamlessly transitions through toasty malts to an excellent dry hop finish. The mouthfeel is very round, smooth, and chewy. The carbonation level is just right. This stout is very complex but not at all difficult to drink. None of the flavors are overpowering and with a very velvety mouthfeel the first pint begs a second."
"Pours a deep brown to black color with a sparse coating of light tan head over top. Nose is nice and chocolatey sweet with a background of ashy roasted malt. Good balance between sweetness and roast in this one. Flavor is nice as well. Mostly chocolate in the start, with the roasty and light hoppy bitter on the finish giving a light coffee note to it. Bitter doesn't hang on too long, but stays around just long enough. Feel is velvety smooth and creamy but nice and thick with a minimal carbonation. This is an incredible stout. The beer is in very good harmony with itself. Flavor and aroma meld very well. I don't remember what I said about this before, but I am a big fan of what I just drank."
"Thanks Deshcutes and especially to Big Love for sending this my way!"
"The taste is sharp, with a burnt acidity to it up front. This is balanced by a soft creamy mouthfeel that starts in the middle and carries through almost to the end. The finish is dominated by roasted notes quite similar to the finish of an espresso; acidity and roasted / burnt notes. For all of the roast character it is quite smooth, it is lack that burnt-husk astringency that can be found in some stouts. Having said that, the roasted acidity here is a bit too much; there needs to be a bit more something (sweet malt would do it) to balance it out. Perhaps a bit of age would do the trick as well; I have a feeling this might mellow out over 6 months or so."
"Nice smooth mouthfeel help make this a real belter of a brew. This is a serious stout that I would reserve for a special occasion."
"Wow. Very, very nice. Intense and long-lasting aroma and flavour in a beautifully smooth and aesthetically beautiful beer. I recently read an article (Times of London I think) about Deus and the ""new"" upmarket beer segment, comparing high end beer to champagne. A wine expert, tasting Deus, said it was a great beer, but still ""short," leading him to say that he couldn't see paying champagne prices for beer -- a taste that ""disappears immediately."" I can say without hesitation that the aforementioned ""wine expert"" has never tried Obsidian Stout. You should. And it won't set you back as much as a bottle of champagne, either."
"D - Great, easy drinking beer."
"Very well constructed, and pleasantly drinkable. Excellent for style, and no hint of the higher abv was noticed. Many thanks to waldowin for including this gem in our trade."
"Good easy drinking stout"
"oh snaps. looks very nice, tight packed head on a deep black body. smells roasty, slightly smokey. little coffee, little alcohol. oh boy. taste? slightly sweet with a respectable hop hit. roasty and chocolaty. the slightest touch of black licorice, maybe its just me. alcohol pop on the swallow. silky smooth and delicious. insanely drinkable for being so powerful abv wise. awesome stuff."
"Overall: What a gift for a dear friend from Oregon to bring me. I really must get out to the Northwest to pick up some more of this at some point."
"Sweet buttermilk and chocolate are present in the nose, but not a burst of complexity there. Thankfully the flavor picks up all that the aroma is lacking. Begins with a sweet licorice thang goin on, melting into tangy butterscotch and dry bakers chocolate. Somewhat smoky in the finish with a lasting, partially acidic bitterness. Carbonation is mild yet fills the mouth with delightful smoothness. Delicious and extremely drinkable. Big ups to waldowin for the hookup."
"Quite easy to throw back a couple of these, but it was filling due to it's texture, so wouldn't have any more beyond that...either way, a definite winner."
"Overall, this is a very well done stout. The only detractor from drinkability is the abv, which at 6.4% is a bit high for a standard (i.e. non-Imperial) stout. Despite this, Deschutes has come up with an outstanding beer that I wish I could obtain easily."
"Almost black pour, not quite opaque, dense creamy tan head. Mostly sweet aroma (oatmeal stout like)with a decent roasty grip. Condensed molasses, coffee, soy sauce, vegetal oil and licorice notes. Very smooth palate, creamy, velvety texture is enhanced by the low carbonation. Slightly buttery tones. Well hopped in the finish with a bitterness that enlaces the coating roastiness. Above average thanks to an engaging mouthfeel, looks and almost feel like a nitro conditioned stout though the flavor is not influenced."
"Drinkability & Notes  Easy to drink, because of the great flavor and perfect mouthfeel. In my experience this is one of the better American single stouts out there, I really wish this was available here on the East Coast."
"Overall, for a stout, this is very drinkable. Not a beer to be pounding all night, but to be slowly drank and enjoyed. I will definitely go out and get some of this to try at home. Wonderful."
"From a bottle that conveniently fell off the truck at the WBF last weekend in Durham. Pours a deep, dark, almost pitch black, with an inch or so of creamy dark tan head on top. Big aroma of rich roasted malt, espresso, prunes, a touch of phenol, and a faint whiff of brown sugar. Palate is lightly sweet up front, with the huge yet mellow maltiness and flavor of very dark chocolate taking over as it passes the tip of the tongue. Slightly roasty on the finish, with notes of dark fruit and just the slightest bit of hop bitterness at the end. Smooth, creamy body is like velvet. Slow-drinking, but immensely enjoyable. Reminds me of why Deschutes is one of my favorite breweries in the world."
"A nice, ballsy stout. Not rich and warm, but bold, brash, and cutting."
"Drinkability: I scored this a 3.5 only because I cant keep drinking stout after stout. Yet I would consider it above average across all beers."
"Chocolately mocha powder aroma. Coffee dark. Smooth, although some cookie crumbs and coconut strings mouthfeel in there. Well roasted, bittersweet and neither leaning to coffee nor chocolate. Very nicely carbonated. A very good stout but I think somewhat overated. A drop behind the Bell's stouts."
"overall: not a bad stout. i have to thank waldowin for this brew in a trade. like i said before, this would make a decent session stout, but the mouthcoating resin may become anoying after a while. not overly complex, and i've had better, but you could do much worse. a recommended good try."
"Drinkability- A very easy drinking stout. If you like your stouts dark, grab one of these."
" A very tasty stout here."
"It is real nice that at least in the PNW that beer can bought at any grocery store for a good price for a six pack. I compare this to St Ambroise Oatmeal Stout as a high quality stout that is available easily. The beer had all the roasty notes coupled with chocolate esters but I had one small quible and that is the slightly abupt bitter finish. Other than that this is a great stout that provides great value."
"This is a very well rounded stout. Somewhat sweet, somewhat bitter... aftertaste sticks around and has some bite to it without being overly bitter. Just about everything you could ask for in a stout except the disappearance of the head. Another excellent brew from Deschutes."
"A fantastic stout. Recommended without a meal, as the chocolate and coffee flavors tend to be more dessert-oriented and aren't the best at complimenting food. A great after dinner beer."
"Pours about as close to black as possible with a reddish-tan head. The mouthfeel is chewy and the carbonation level is noticeable, nice and not too high. The flavors are remarkably complex- roasted malts, coffee and chocolate followed by a bitter hoppy finish. Obsidian is a top-notch stout."
"This is a very drinkable stout and I'm surprised to see the ABV so high (BA reports 6.70%, Deschutes website says 6.40%) This tastes like one of those pleasant 4%-5% stouts; there's no hint at all that it's hiding a higher than normal alcohol kick. Perhaps that's the source of the 'hint of sweetness' but whatever the case, it's quite a tasty brew."
"This brew pours black as night with no allowance for light to pass thru. Pour finishes with a nice creamy three finger head. Nose is chocolaty coffee that keeps getting better the longer it warms. Taste is this wonderful blend of roasted chocolate coffee that finishes with a creamy dry hop. This brew has this perfect creamy mouthfeel leaving just the right amount of dryness in the end. Wow, what a great beer! Overall drinkability is almost exceptional. I view this as an Light Imperial Stout which makes it possible to enjoy several at one session without having to worry about being overcome by an exceptionally high ABV."
"Drinkability and Overall: While it does have some distinct porter characters, this is still one of the more enjoyable brews I've had. The west coast really proved themselves with this solid and delicious beer. This is really killer stuff here."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a towering tan head that slowly fades. The aroma is great. It has a rich, dry black malt scent with a roasted element that is very aromatic. The taste is good. It has a very earthy black malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes smooth and rich. It is a bit dry and creamy. This is a very flavorful stout. It is uncompromising with the use of black malts; very nice. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good stout. It has excellent black malt flavor and a smooth finish; a good drinker."
"Don't pass this one up if you see it on cask, even if you did not care for it that much out of the bottle. It's worth it!"
"A very drinkable, balanced beer. Definately recommended."
"Pours - you guessed it - black as obsidian, with a taupe colored reasonably tight head that lasts to the bottom of the glass. Strong roasted aroma very characteristic of a stout - kind of like an original Guinness, but somehow even more so. There's a pleasant sharpness in the flavor, yet it's irresistably smooth... you'd never know there was 6+% ABV in this beer. Bitter chocolate, espresso flavors are very strong - why, oh why can't Starbucks make a shot that tastes this good? Mouthfeel is almost oily, but in a good way... not too carbonated, not too flat feeling. This one goes down just as smoooth as you could want - there aren't enough o's in ""smooth"" to describe it!"
"More full than a guinness but not overdone, I could drink this all night. I'm so glad it's readily available in my area."
"Dark cherry wood with light red edges and a nice cap of light tan/khaki foam. The head lasts for a long time and leaves interesting lacing patterns on my chalice. This is a nice looking brew. The aroma is all roasted malts, chocolate, slightly vinous, almost sour, and quite intense. The taste is a lovely blend of the afforementioned roasted black malts, coffee, dark chocolate, herbal hops, and more. Aftertaste is long, lingering, and full of bitter chocolate, and roasty malt notes. Mouthfeel is thick and coating. Almost too much, if you ask me. Drinkability is quite nice, despite this brews notes faults. A heavily roasted stout that borders on the imperial side of things. An interesting American interperatation that I would love to try again."
"Surprisingly drinkable for a richly flavoured beer - a characteristic among other beers from the fine brewers at Deschutes."
"Drinkability is top notch, 'nuff said."
"This is a very easy beer to hoist. Its refinement and genteel balance make it an ideal candidate to serve to friends among us who otherwise claim to be repelled by those more brazen and thunderous stouts whose taste profiles shun restraint. Obsidian is never so overpowering as to be offensive, while still every bit a world class pour. It remains one of the best overall non-specialty stouts in the west."
"The dry bitterness is rounded out by a creamy mouthfeel."
"Obsidian Stout is a classic. Amazing appearance, flavor to spare, malt and hops enough for all-comers and a body big enough to suit me; no easy task. I do believe this is Deschutes best beer."
"Black, black and black. Definitely smooth in character, although its mouthfeel is similar to an imperial stout. And yet there's no real alcohol burn, either. Incredibly roasty body under one of the darkest brown heads I've seen in a beer. Probably just one will do ya."
"This is a great stout. Pours a crude black with ruby hints, the off white mocha head is delicious to the eye and mind, coating will lace the glass. The smell is of strong roasted coffee notes, a sweetness of milk and cookies pleases the taste. Milk chocolate froth head really melts the mouth, the coffee taste is light but noticable, very rich and smooth. This is good and for about 5.99 a six pack this is probably the best stout, and you can find it at the local Safeway, awesome."
"Pours a deep dark brownish black which no light can be seen through. A nice thick creamy offwhite head appears and leaves a nice lace around the entire glass. Aromas are dominated by roasted malts, with a little chocolate and burnt aromas also present. There is also a slight nutty character and some sweet molasses in the air as well. Initially this beer has a very robust malt profile. The roasted flavors just scream out at you initially with nice chocolate, smokey, and sweet coffee like flavors. There is a nice creamy texture to this beer and some oat like flavors make their way into the middle of the taste. This beer is also very thick and almost chewy in the body. Just a delicious feeling on the pallate. This beer finishes bittersweet, with a slight bitterness from the hops but an almost molasses sweetness that fights back and forth to make this beer just incredible. Overall this beer just has it all, great body, great flavor (including a wonderful aftertaste) and is quite drinkable. I must find a way to get my hands on more of this brew!"
"Obsidian is a good description of the color, so black that no light passes thu. Has a little bit of a dark tan head. The aroma is a heady mix of chocolate and coffee with a little licorice in the background. A good solid roasted malt flavor with a bit of chocolate on the tip of your tongue and a rush of coffee along both sides of the tongue. The roasted malt makes it self at home at the back of your throat on the finish."
"Taste is rich and chewy and very much roasted malt and a bit of semi-sweet chocolate flavor. Not much hop flavor but the malts aren't too heavy either. Smooth finish with bitter coffee aftertaste, goes down really easy though, especially good on a cold windy day. Somewhat one-dimensional, but a great dimension I wish I could visit more often."
"One of my favorites that I finally tracked down in Reno. Pours velvety black with a glint of reddish-amber light at the bottom of the glass. A handsome, two-finger cocao brown head that leaves smudges of lace graces the top. The aroma features big toasted barley notes with the underlying Deschutes-level dose of Cascade hops. Chocolate, chicory and toasted rye also come to mind. The taste is something to behold and it makes this one of the finest tasting stouts around. Big chocolate flavors lay the foundation, with a sweet, almost fruity middle before a pretty dry, bitter and toasty finish. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, but not so much so that it precludes warm-weather drinking. Drinkability is fantastic. They don't come much better than this."
"It pours an opaque black with a light brown head. There is a lot of roasted character in the aroma (coffee and chocolate) and virtually no hops. The body is full and smooth with some sweet cream and coffee and slight chocolate. Burnt malt in the finish with a slight grassy/hay hop taste. It is a good drinking stout, but there is nothing that jumps out at me."
"Bottom Line: A fantastic brew. I don't think I have had an Imerial stout, to date, but if I would, I would think this stout would compare rather favorably. I would think this could be considered a big stout. One of my favorites, hands down."
"Thanks to alexgash for this one. Pours a you guessed it obsidian black/very dark brown with a dark head that you could eat with a spoon. Smell is raisin, rum, cocoa, and some hops. Full bodied mouthfeel. Taste is dominated by thick malts with a distinct and prominent mineral flavor, makes me think of river water. Lingering bitter chocolate and roasted flavor finish off this high quality stout."
"Thanks to xlperro for the bottle!"
"this is very fruity for a stout. I'm not real big on fruit flavors, but if you are, you will like this."
"Medium to full bodied with a rich, creamy semi-oily mouthfeel and just the right amount of carbonation. Awesome drinkability for such a big, flavorful Stout."
"This beer pours out black like the devil's heart with a frothy tan head. Smell is of chocolate and caramel malty goodness. Taste is hearty with a dry coffeelike roasted malt taste underpinned with a bit of sweetness from crystal malt. Hop character takes back burner but in balance and typical for the style. Neverending dry roasted malt aftertaste. Silky mouthfeel but not too heavy in body. Good alcohol content but presence is masked. This beer is very drinkable but still puts hair on your balls."
"Not a bad stout!"
"A small, dark tan, dense head sits on a dark, opaque, black beer. Bright light shows a little red. Nose is roasty coffee... a little sourish. The front is smoky, roasty, coffee, toffee and a bit of chocolate. Nice. The thick, strong, chocolatey middle is buttery and a little fruity with temperature. Bitter, chocolate, tangy finish. This is a very good, high quality, tasty, strong stout. Very well balanced. Excellent."
"This has been a great week. After never coming across Deschutes, I've had a chance to try Black Butte Porter, IPA, and Obsidian in the course of a few days. This is my favorite of the three I've tried so far. Just the faintest trace of light shows through the inky darkness. The head is a tan monster that sticks to the side of the glass and leaves little islets over the top of the beer. Roasted malt, coffee, and just a trace of nut swirl around nicely. A nice hop bitterness kicks in at the end to make things even more interesting. Drinkability? It could be dangerous at this abv."
"This is probably my favorite NW stout. Though I've been drinking Black Butte for years, I've been gravitating more towards the other fine Deschutes beers lately. They are definitely doing something right down there in Bend."
"Bituminous Stout might be more appropriate."
"The carbonation is a little high on this one. The head is nice an large, but a little airy because of the heavy carbonation. It settles into something a little more dense later on. Nice black and when you get to the bottom of the glass, you notice its base is a nice ruby. Heavy on the caramel, a little roasty, but not really a big flavor for a stout. The body could benefit from a slightly lower level of carbonation."
"Pours like 40 weight -- a beautiful thick, dark brown, with a small but creamy brown head to match. Smelled like malted coffee, but not as strong as I expected (or would have liked). Thick mouthfeel that actually felt 'heavier' than other beers to me -- like my tongue was getting a workout just bearing the weight and pushing it back into my throat. Rich roasted flavor with hints of hickory. Very enjoyable for a dessert beer or treat, and taste-wise I could drink a few, but I think I'd either get full or a tired tongue before I drank too many."
"Deschutes has some new labels on their bottles. White label with colorful scenic artwork and best-buy date. A pitch black beer with decent head that dwindles but does not disappear, good lacing. Aroma of roastiness and somewhat fruity yeast. An impressive stout, not quite an impy but darn close. Lots of flavor here, with big roasted barley qualities with light herbal bitterness that disappears as the beer gets warmer. Mouthfeel smooth and milky. Not the easiest beer to drink, maybe because of alcohol and not a very dry finish. Deschutes are always good, and consistent if maybe a little predictable, but usually excellent taste and reliability are more than enough."
"It pours a nice rich black coffee color with a firm tannish head and some sticky, webby lace. A smoky toasty malt aroma blends with a pungent hoppy smell. The medium malt body is fairly sweet with flavors of coffee and dark chocolate. Plenty of Northwest-style Hoppy bitterness cuts through the sweetness. The head Stays On!"
"Before I knew it, that pint was gone. Silky smooth, finely balanced between chocolatey sweetness and coffee bitterness, Obsidian Stout is so very easy to drink. Glad I purchased a six-pack as this brew has surpassed Kalamazoo Stout as my favorite stout."
"Pours a dark chocolate brown but in the glass is inpenetrable obsidian. No head, just a scattering of foamyness hear and there. Aromas of dry cocoa and dark chocolate eminates from my Duvel tulip. I taste complex notes of high quality dark chocolate, although it is fleeting. I'd like it to hang around a bit longer. Well balanced with moderate hoppiness. Not as dimensional as the imperial stouts that I have been favoring as of late, but this isn't imperial. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying. It is a very good regular stout. Very drinkable."
"Pours deep balck with small dark a head. Nice chunky lace on the side of the galss. Aroma is chocolate, espresso and drak fruit (raisin ?) Flavor is weet chocolate, mild hop bitterness and a creamy latte taste on the back end. Very nice beer, almost would classify it a sweet stout."
"A nice and big stout from the Pacific Northwest. Very black in color with brown head. Roast malt and coffee aromas pours out of the glass, slightly smokey and slightly sweet...very nice. The flavors lean heavily on the roast malt/coffee side with enough sweet malt and nuttiness to balance. It is medium bodied with some chocolate and licorice in a nice dry finish. Highly recommended for the serious stout lovers."
"Wow, this could be my new favorite Stout. Complex, tasty, and a limited supply in this area make me want to savor this beer. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability: A decent stout, but nothing all the special IMO. My least favorite offering from this brewery."
"This reminded me a lot of Shakespeare Stout, and it's almost as good. Extremely dark brown body (not quite ""obsidian"" black), with a light brown head. Smell is rich raisiny malts, chocolate rum ice cream, and alcohol. Taste starts with peat-soaked roasted malts, a touch of sweetness, balanced nicely with some hops. Finish is chocolate bitter with lingering burnt fruit. Another big and chewy stout."
"Update  This was one of my earlier reviews on the site. Now having been a member for over a year and having tasted over 1,000 beers (over 100 stouts alone) I thought I would revisit this fella in 2004. Ill be damned, this is one good stout. I stand by my initial rating. This is one of the best stout buys on the planet."
"This is a highly accessible stout. If you appreciate a well-crafted brew, try it...regardless of your care for stouts."
"Dark Black color, medium creamy head. Nice pour. Deeply roasted malts, slightly hoppy. Full flavored and full bodied stout. Very smooth taste, pronounced chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"*As my sample warmed, the flavor changed quite a bit. It was much sweeter and that overt bitterness stepped back a few paces. While I initially rated the beer at 3.2, I have now adjusted the score to reflect my opinion. Much better if you drink it at 55 F or above. Would love to try it on tap or cask!"
"Overall, this is one of the better stouts out there. An enjoyable beer. Give this one a try if you can."
"If I lived in Oregon, this would get a lot of business from me!"
"OG=1.065"
"The most beauteous thing in the world isStout setting in its Chalice, that magnificent ebony color crowned by a thick head all chocolate brown, frothy and the left over lace a nice sealing sheet upon the glass. Nose has the delightful aroma of toasted grains, Starbucks coffee and bittersweet chocolate, sweet and inviting, as is the malt-laden start with the top thick and chewy. Finish has a spicy hop bite, moderately acidic, bittersweet chocolate dry and a real treat to the palate and a top notch Stout in my book."
"Good drinkability if its cold outside a massive brew..very good stuff."
"A very fine beer. Dramatically superior to the bottled version."
"Pouring this stout was so dark brown that it could almost pass as black. Not a lot of foam but nice lace on the glass. The smell was of a sweet malty chocolate, with a hint of fruit. The taste was a bitter/sweet choclate with a grainy malt flavor, with just a touch of smoke. After drinking this stout, the after taste stays on the palate with a bitter/sweet sensation on the tongue. The after taste just stays on and on and on! What a pleasant surprise!"
"Nice black color and a foamy tan head that left real nice lace. This stout had a nice roasted smoky taste.  Good solid stout that can become a regular in one's repotoire.  I enjoyed this with some lamb sausage, ground beef, baked potato and some sourdough bread.  Great for a cold evening."
"I was given one these once in college and it was my introduction to the world of quality stouts. It's still one of my favorites. A great beer from one of the country's best breweries."
"What a treat this one is!!!  Man I love good stouts!!!  This has is jet black in color with the smallest of lace around the edges...a nice burnt roast malt on the nose along with some soft java notes...a sweet creamy texture in the mouth...full bodied...great roasted malt flavor with a sweet finish...hops are unnoticable...very easy drinking stout with some character....one of the better ones available.."
"The bottle says this beer is as black as the volcanic obsidian rock for which it is named.  I don't see it as quite that dark as some rays of light do indeed get through this brew.  (Bring on the spectrophotometer!)  It IS very close to black however.  It has a nice creamy brown head that laces the glass very nicely as I drink.  Very nice coffee and mocha on the nose.  This beer tastes wonderful.  Beautiful coffee bean and chocolate tones present.  A nice subdued bitterness coming from the roasted malt.  Smooth and velvety.  This is truly a great stout."
"Dark Brown w/ thin brown head.  Burnt coffee aromas present.  Solid hop bitterness with burnt malt and coffee undertones.  Sweet start with a bitter/sweet finish.  Originally, I was thinking an overall score of about 3.5, but as I tasted more it grew on me."
"This is teh first American stout I ever had.  It has a great thick body, higer alcohol content, nice creamy head and great roasted flavor from the heavy dark malts.  This one'll keep you warm at night."
"Notes: This a big stout ... coming a little close to knocking on the Imperial Stout's door yet still a pleasing stout to the less traveled stout drinker. Perhaps one one of the best stouts brewed in the US. The work of a schooled brewer. Alc. by Vol. 6.75%."
