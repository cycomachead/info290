3.87,-3,4.25,4,3.75,3.5,4,"Overall, while this was a pleasant offering, we found it to be a bit inconsistent.  To start things off, the aroma was fantastic.  Very complex, malt forward, and balanced by enough sweetness.  The taste, however, left us somewhat perplexed.  Again, it just felt inconsistent in what it was trying to do.  You would start with some syrupy sweet notes, then dive into some deep and boozy chemical things, and then finish off with a unique bitterness.  The next sip would be entirely different.  The mouthfeel lent to a thinned flavor and, with such a curious showing of rummy booziness, made for a thought provoking display, to put it nicely.  Intense critique and criticism aside, those moments of chocolatey and vanilla sweetness created a more full-flavored experience, saving the beer rather substantially.","TheBrewo","Jan 27, 2015"

Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, roast, graham cracker, dark bread, light coffee, vanilla, light cream, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with well balanced dark/roasted malt, graham cracker, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roast, graham cracker, light coffee, dark bread, vanilla, light cream, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roast, graham cracker, dark bread, light coffee, vanilla, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of dark/roasted malt, graham cracker, and spice flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good spiced stout. All around well balanced dark/roast malt, graham cracker, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 22, 2014"

Thin milk chocolate colored head, nice lacing. Aroma is dark roasted malt, rich toffee, and chocolate, w some vanilla also. Flavor is dark, rick, smokey, with dark-roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate, and mildly stated hops. Mouthfeel is medium thin. Overall this is a unique and outstanding stout--a real treat!","Dsimenson","May 13, 2014"

I recently saw a fellow BA stocking his shopping cart with 6 of these so I had to give it a try. I really do love the smell. One of the best ever. Although, it's very polarizing because the taste and mouthfeel really let's down for me. I'd say a very solid stout, just for the smell. Interesting. I'd probably buy again. It's only 6.5%, which is probably the issue.","Alron","Mar 19, 2014"
