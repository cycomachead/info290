4.1,-0.5,,,,,,"Overall pretty good, it has a great nose, the taste had some good aspects but dropped off on the cocoa and fudge while increasing the roasty slightly acrid burnt notes and big on bitterness. It had some great characters and was tasty in general, but the lack of carbonation made this feel like it was a lot bigger and syrupier than it actually was. A bit more carbonation would have made the mouth pop a bit more and the flavors come out more, and I think it would have bumped up quite a bit. 4","jlindros","Beers"

Overall a very good beer nice big nose and a big bold flavor. One of the smoother and more balanced coffee beers you will run into.","goblue3509","Apr 23, 2011"
4.27,3.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O: I like this beer more than I thought I would based off the aroma, since it is over the top coffee grinds. For anyone that likes coffee beer, this one is for them. The low abv makes this extremely drinkable. Also had this infused with oak chips and vanilla, which IMO, made it even better. It cut some of the coffee and drew out more of the chocolate and vanilla.","mdaschaf","Feb 18, 2011"
4.03,-2.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: This is how you do a low ABV stout. Really complex, rich and extremely drinkable. I throughly enjoyed this one. A growler fill may be in my future. Thumbs up - yet another winner from Evo.","Rhettroactive","Jan 29, 2011"
3.75,-9,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This is a very nice local coffee stout (much better than Flying Dogs recent take IMO) but the carbonation issues remind me of the lesser batches of Planet Bean and make the flavor one dimensional.","yourefragile","Nov 10, 2010"
4.14,0.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"D - Thin mouth with less than 8% ABV make this extremely drinkable. With big, chewy stouts at 10-12% ABV, you have one or two, and you're full. This is what I think the definition of a session stout should be. Compared to others in the class, it's very good, but not the top of the heap.","BeerThursdays","Aug 28, 2010"
4.59,11.4,4,5,4.5,3.5,5,"The taste isn't quite as strong and pungent as the nose, and this is perhaps due to the mouthfeel, which is a bit thin. It doesn't quite have the big, creamy body that I would expect from the wondrous nose. While the feel is a bit thin, the drinkability on this is sky high. Beautiful coffee notes and a not overwhelming amount of coffee.","Thorpe429","Mar 12, 2010"
4.37,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"D: An intense coffee flavor makes this a very good drink. I'll share a pint or so with ksak but that's it. The rest is mine.","akorsak","Mar 11, 2010"
4.58,11.2,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"D/M_ deff. a session beer but is smooth and velvety on the tongue and is not overly carbonated.","jmfc8237","Beers"
4.35,5.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer poured incredibly black and syrupy into a pint glass. The head was tan and thick, with toffee, chocolate, and burnt toast aromas - very nice. A wonderfully smooth, low carbonation mouthfeel (viscous), with burnt toast, black malt, and toffee flavors dominating. A lingering burnt toast aftertaste, with malt sweetness and a bit of hop bitterness. A fantastic stout.","pershan","0"
4.8,16.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"D - An exceptional American Stout, not Imperial or Double IMO, but plenty of flavor from the coffee, so no mistaking that. The stout is easy to drink even for 6.8% - it deserves a 5 for sheer quality of brew and flavor of the coffee, the cold drip method was utilized per brewery rep-it has given the beer such balanced coffee taste.","Slatetank","Sep 03, 2009"
4.64,12.6,4,5,5,4,4,"Haven't had a beer from them that I didn't enjoy yet, and the Rise Up Stout continues that trend. If you have a chance to get this beer, I very, very strongly recommend it.","DeriusE","Sep 03, 2009"
4.65,12.9,4,4,5,4.5,5,"Very, very dark in color but some minor ruby highlights near the edges of the glass when held to the light. Nice looking tan head on top. Good aroma-mild coffee/espresso notes with a decent roasted aroma. Almost has more of a dark chocolate scent to me then a lot of coffee. Flavor is in a word-KILLER. Perfectly balanced roasted and coffee flavors simply meld together. Nice, lingering mocha flavor. Slightest hint of chocolate. Roasted graininess also comes thru. Retains enough ""stout"" flavor that it isn't overshadowed by the coffee. Great body. Just a great, great beer and an even better stout. Easily could become a new favorite-wait I think it is!","lackenhauser","Beers"
4.62,12.1,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Awesome! I love when both a great brewery and coffee company get together and make a Coffee Stout Baby of extreme awesomeness like this. This was just THICK with java, roast, sweetness, and the drinkibility was top notch. Be on the look out for this very soon in 12 oz bottles in the MD/DE markets. I pray that this remains as good as it is on draft.","Kegatron","0"
