"Poured from a fresh growler into pint glass, pitch black color, a finger of mocha head that disappears quickly. Moderate carbonation, medium body. Not as thick as I thought it would be, more oily and smooth. Not a bad thing, though. Aroma is vanilla and sweet caramel, with hints of roast coffee. Taste is the opposite, roast coffee and dark chocolate forward, with sweetness underneath as a smooth balance, not too bitter. The coffee has a definite roasted note, not burnt. Beautiful balance, one of the smoothest stouts I've had."

"Great aroma, great taste, definitely a nice dessert beer or winter warmer. Not as creamy or heavy as expected, which may or may not be a good thing to some."
""

"What else to expect from Kuhnhenn? I'm not normally HUGE on stouts/porters, but this pretty much blew my mind. Bold flavor, awesome aroma, easy drinking... what a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Smells and tastes quite nice until that roasted bitterness takes over."

"O- Great beer. I may be biased because I'm partial to Kuhnhenn beers, and I'm also partial to coffee stouts, but this was just an awesome, well-blended, flavorful stout."

"Best nose of any beer I've ever had, and the taste doesn't disappoint either. Not too much coffee, not too much vanilla, not too sweet and it actually still tastes like beer unlike the Southern Tier Creme Brulee. If I was left with only one beer I could drink for the rest of my life it would be this one."

"Cost: $28 for a 64 oz growler."
""

""

"O-A decent creme brulee stout, but not quite as flavorful or comparable in body to others (ie Southern Tier)"
""
""
"M- Light to medium bodied. More porter than stout."
""
""
""
""
"Drink- This one was worthy the hype that I put in my head. It was creamy, smooth, rich, lush and full of that vanilla, caramel chocolate note. I might finish a growler in one night and I am okay with that."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a decent beer, but not sure it's worth going out of your way to try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not too sweet but really tasty. The coffee is smooth and complimented well by the other flavors. I would have this again."
"Would love to try this again sometime. Thanks again!"

"Not about destroying your mouth, but what is there is really well pit together."
"Overall - It was pretty tasty. It did however almost become unbearably sweet by the end. One 10 oz pour was plenty for me."
"O: I think the burnt sugar made this less enjoyable."
"D - This is very hard to drink. The smell is not good and the flavor is just awful. I had to choke down my glass of this, and barely made it through. I would recommend steering clear of this one."
"Overall: This was very good, although it became a little bit sweet as the glass progressed."
"Overall, a tasty beer. Wish it tasted as good as it looks and smells."
"Growler. Poured into a tulip glass a dark, forboding black color with a thick tan head. Very, VERY coffee and vanilla in the nose, one of the most decadent aromas outside of Southern Tier Iâ€™ve had in a long time. Medium mouthfeel. The java coffee flavor domintes the start to this but after a second a nice sweet vanilla note joins the flavors and pairs nicely with the coffee. Slightly roasty and dry finish. Some chocolate notes as well. Overall, pretty good."
"D - A great flavoured sweet stout. They managed to perfectly balance the bitter and the sweet in this one."
"Pours a moderate brown color with quite a bit of haze. Single-finger off-white head with a bit of lacing as it goes down. The nose is quite nice with a lot of cream and vanilla plus a good deal of coffee. Some roasted malt lingering in the background. The flavor is a bit too cloying as the vanilla and cream start to take over a bit. Still, nice flavors lingering in the background and I like the addition of the coffee, which makes this much, much more drinkable than Southern Tier's Creme Brulee. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy and the sweetness works here. I like this version better than the Imperial."
"terrific brewed coffee aroma, and very nice appearance. The rest of the experience is average. There is vanilla, some woodiness, but surprisingly sour. A fresh newly bottled beer, thanks to Tim (IPFreely) for sharing. Much better in the imperial version."
"Drinkability: Moderate at best despite the amazing flavors that I've been raving about throughout this whole review; the weight starts to sit a little heavy after a bit and the sweetness would become a bit much after a while, so while it's awesome here in a snifter, I don't think I'd want it too much as it could get to the point where it actually turns the stomach."
"Well, I appreciate the chance to try this from a generous trader, but I must sadly admit it is one of the worst tasting beers I have ever had."
"D-Wonderful! At ""only"" 5.8% this brew has all of the flavour you could want. Simply outstanding!"
"Very nice head and dark almost black. Smelled like coffee and candy. Tasted like something you could sink your teeth into. The carmelized sugar gave it this great desert taste with a knockout coffee flavor to it. The mouthfeel was very smooth. I would drink this day after day after day. My brother doesn't drink anything thats not candy and I think that he would even jump for this beer. This is what I call a desert beer."
"Overall, Ashley's has had Southern Tier's Creme Brulee Stout on tap for the last couple of weeks and let me tell you, I dented that keg quite nicely. But the Kuhnhenn version blows the ST out of the water IMO. I like the ST because of it's high ABV but the Kuhnhenn just tastes that much better. A lot of coffee and a lot of cocoa. Not as rich as ST. Sorry Southern Tier, Kuhnhenn beats you out here!"
"Pitch black with a billowing, fluffy head. Smell is coffee beans with very strong hints of vanilla and chocolate. The taste is like washing down a spoonful of brownie batter with a cup of a fresh gourmet coffee. Full bodied and extremely inviting and drinkable, this is one that I will have to seek out again and re-review the proper way."
"Note: At the Michigan Craft Brewers Guild Summer Fest, Kuhnhenn poured this in slushee form, in their 'Brain Freeze' edition beers. Still, very good."
"Smell and taste are semisweet dark chocolate.. fairly bitter for being such a strong chocolate flavored beer. Virtually no alcohol presence and extremely drinkable. Not much in terms of hops or heavy malt flavor.. but a lot of dark rich chocolate."
"Pours a very dark brown in color. A nice, tan colored head forms and sits on top of the beer. Smell is creme, vanilla and some roasted coffee and chocolate. Taste is a wonderful balance of vanilla creme, chocolate and roasted espresso. This beer is everything that I was wanting. Much different than the Southern Tier version. This beer is much more approachable and drinkable. Very creamy and smooth on the mouthfeel. Contrary to what I was expecting, I could actually see myself drinking a few glasses of this before tiring of it. Thought I would get tired of the flavors, but it's just so damn enjoyable and good. Very good beer."
"Overall, a solid beer and unlike many I have ever tasted. Really unique flavors and complex on many levels. Thanks again Russ for hooking me up with this beer."
"Kuhnhenn's Creme Brulee pours jet black with a thin head that doesn't hang around for long, or leave anything in it's wake. That's fine, 'cos the beer is the bomb on the nose - excellent, this is what Southern Tier should have done. Brilliant vanilla, butterscotch and chocolate, but to keep things from getting cloying, there's some coffee and a gorgeous roasted character, both of which (along with the chocolate), lend a balancing bitterness to the beer. On the palate, this beer opens up with the same flavors - moderate vanilla, some butterscotch, caramel, chocolate and coffee. The roasted bitterness provides the necessary backbone for this beer. The m/f is great too - medium-light in body with soft carbonation and a great sweet/bitter finish. I drank about 20oz and could have gone for more!"
"D-This is a great beer overall and definitely Trumps Southern Tier's offering. Wonderful, sweet, rich, and creamy. It almost becomes cloying after 1/2 a growler but it takes much much longer than ST's offering to reach this point (about 3 oz). great beer overall and I am looking forward to trying more from this brewery."
"A great desert beer if I lived in the area I would defiantly use this brew to close out a great dinner with friends. This brew is very unique; I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a little sweetness in their brews."
"Thanks to the ugly duckling for making me this way. :P"
"Pours an almost complete black with a monster three finger brownish chunky head that takes a while to subside to a thin layer which lasts throughout. A fair amount of stick clings to the sides of the glass here and there. Smell is just sublime. Vanilla, toffee, egg nog, caramel, and bittersweet chocolate. A good amount of smokey malts and coffee beans as well. Just a delight to stick your nose down into. Taste starts off with a big explosion of sugary coffee with lactose and butterscotch. Midway some slightly burnt toast flavors and dark chocolate emerge on the tongue. The finish is nutty and sweet with a toffee glazed almond taste. Body is somewhat thin but still creamy and soft. Carbonation is light in the mouth but enjoyable. Another one of those ""I want to take this to work"" beers. I can't find a touch of alcohol anywhere making this way too easy to put down. This is a zillion times better than Southern Tier's Creme Brulee because it's actually drinkable, why they have the same B+ score is beyond me. Excellent beer for sure, kudos to Kuhnhenn."
"Drinkability: Ridiculous! Can a beer be too drinkable? No, but this one is close."
"mouthfeel is sweet, roasty, bitter and light bodied, loads of flavor - excellent!"
"Notes from 11/22/05"
"D- It's a nice sipper that I'd really like to try again."
"I had the first glass out of the Firkin at the BA gathering at HopCat in Grand Rapids 2 months ago. It was amazing!! It was Black with a very dirty brown head with a light milky hint. The Smell was very rich and well balanced, a very good foreshadowing of the flavor. There was not a lot of mouth feel witch I thought fit this very flavorful beer. The mocha and cream flavors were very well balanced not overpowering. Very drinkable beer that would go well after a big Italian dinner, or maybe in the morning to help nurse a hangover. Over all excellent beer!!"
"D: Highly drinkable. Even with the relatively complex flavor structure, the beer is in many ways still refreshing."
"D. Pretty high, if you like sweet coffee. This would be good for breakfast, methinks..."
"Balance! Well done. I'm also impressed with how well the sweetness was kept at bay."
"Is this beer...? Really? Or is is dessert? While I would have like to have seen the coffee character shine a little more beneath all that sweetness, I can't really argue that this is one hugely tasty and quaffable concoction."
"Poured into a pint glass, very dark black, thick tan head forms, tons of lacing on the glass, very good retention, nice ring. Smell is awesome, insanely rich, mocha, chocolate, toffee, coffee grinds, bread, nice malts, caramelized, great. Taste is similar, rich coffee roast, chocolate, toffee, actually tastes like creme brulee, caramelized sugars, and a cup of coffee, amazing. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation, very smooth and drinkable, a fantastic stout."
"D: Tasty and definitely a unique beer. The lower alcohol is great and I'll finish nearly the entire growler tonight."
"D: I could drink this all day. Literally. Simply amazing."
"D- Doesn't get any better than this."
"Poured a deep black with a touch of deep reddish/brown hues, thin coffee tan head had little retention and left some lacing. Smells like dessert, lots of vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, coffee, and cream, definitely sweet. Tastes of sweet maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla, and cappuccino with a roasted coffee bitter finish. Medium body, smooth and creamy, really sweet and vanilla-y with a subtle bitterness in the finish. Easy to drink, low in alcohol making it really sessionable if you like sweet coffee flavored beers. This could be a nice dessert beer or a good way to start off the day."
"Growler generously shared by tyee, thanks!"
"The bottom line: I love coffee, and I love beer. I think most of the coffee brews that are put out end up unbalanced in some way, or unsatisfying. Kuhnhenn have put together my ideal java brew here. Strong coffee, but balanced. A unique sweet vanilla finish. Really great stuff."
"I'd definitely order it again."
"D: I really enjoyed this as an after dinner drink but this certainly isn't something I'd drink everyday or more than one of at a time. The flavors are very strong, not in a bad way, but they still hinder the drink ability of this. I've had better stouts but I would definitely have this again if I ever find it again."
"d: Very enjoyable"
"D: Why don't I live in Michigan? A definite good beer that I'd like to try on draft or in the bottle."
"OMG! Absolutely delicious. Probably the best stout that I have tasted. A well balanced beer with tons of malt and a subtle sweetness. It smells sweeter than it tastes. If you get the chance stop by the brew pub and try a glass or two. Can I say heaven in a bottle?"
"The appearance was pretty good, nearly opaque brown color with a wet-looking but none too clingy-to-glass head. The aroma was very sweet, vanilla and cocoa and maybe a touch of smoke. The flavor was intensely sweet, almost tasted like a syrup was added to the beer or something. Decent enough mouthfeel, but the bitingly sweet taste was too much for me."
"Enjoyed at the brewpub. This beer was almost completely black, with just a faint chestnut tint at the edge of the glass. The dark tan head left some chunky lacing and the foam showed good retention. The aroma was overwhelmingly vanilla, with a fair bit of roast (almost coffee) and milk chocolate as well. Mild bitterness, definitely balanced towards sweetness, this brew is malty. Full of chocolate and roasty notes, there's still a lot of vanilla in here. Full bodied, low carbonation, and silky smooth. This stuff is good, but really intense. I imagine it would go great with a lot of desserts."
"shouldn't this be a double stout?"
"This was beer #4 of 4 last night & the most disappointing of the four. Last summer at the World Beer Expo, this was the hit of the festival for me, but since I only had a taste, I didn't want to review it until I had an entire glass. I must have had it built up so much in my head that this was bound disappoint. Brought to me in a pint glass out of a nitro pour. The appearance is nice - thin, tan head over deep mahogany, dark brown. Smells like vanilla cake/frosting/cake batter, burnt sugar, & roasted malt. Aside from the malt, it smells like a creme brule. Taste is vanilla sweetness up front followed by some bitter espresso & malt, but then there's a bizarre sour flavor that hits like cheap coffee - very odd. The mouthfeel was very watery, this needs to be creamier. With all of this taken into consideration, this is not very drinkable. It was actually difficult to finish. Hopefully it was just a bad batch...Not recommended."
"Drinkability: I am wowed by the flavor here; much less cloying than Southern Tier yet still a bit sweet to drink in quantity"
"12 ounce bottle, March 2006 on the label. Many thanks to hoppdeup!"
"I've enjoyed this beer at the quiet bar on Saturday afternoon. Despite the fact that I am not a stout drinker, I enjoyed this beer and will be glad to have another pint given the opportunity."
"Taste? Maybe I got a bad bottle. This is the antithesis of smooth and tastes like a cold cup of coffee. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and not very smooth. A drainpour for me."
"Very dark in color. Not a lot of head to speak of. Fantastic aroma-chocolatey and vanilla mix-just a great blend of smells-truely dessert in a glass. Great roasted flavor with a full though mellow coffee flavor behind it all. Pefect blend of the coffee and chocolate notes with a creamy vanilla mix in there. Great body-somewhat thin for all that flavor. A fantastic beer overall. Incredible stuff."
"Methinks I shall."
"D: Enticing, but not very sessionable."
"Took that one at the Mondial 2006. A nice dark black body with a dark brown thin head who disappear quickly. It really smells like a cola soft drink with a hint of peppermint (strange...) and some roasted coffee. Flavor of sour berries, black tea and chocolate mint. I didn't really liked it... In fact, I think that one was infected but maybe that was the REAL taste of it !? For sure, I wont try it again for a while."
"It was a very drinkable beer. While I wouldn't want to do sessions of it, I'd have no problem having a pint or two in a sitting. Definitely a must try."
"The worst stout I've ever encountered. I'd like to try it fresh, since this bottle was a year old."
"Another great brew from Kuhnhenn's, I can't wait for my next trip to Michigan..."
"I could sit and smell this one all day, but it's all I can do to finish the bottle."
"This is a February 2005 bottle almost 10 months later and judging from the reviews it is way past its prime. Too bad because it looked great - dark with solid black coffee with sugar sweetness. The taste was like a beer cocktail combining a coffee stout with a sour lambic. Some may like this blend but sad to say that I had to dump it. It didn't make me gag but the taste and smell do not work together. Thanks to mjohn27603 for throwing this in a recent trade."
"I think this is the definitive review on this beer. My friend brought me some fresh from the brewery on a visit out east (Delaware) in August 2005. AMAZING! The coffee, chocolate, burnt caramel (creme brulee) flavors were there in the aroma as well as the taste, and the beer was awesome! I set 3 aside to see what age would do...the results were not good. The beer took on a vinous, sour taste after 2 months and by 4 months it was undrinkable (poured 2 bottles out, after sampling). Definitely, this beer is to be consumed as soon as posible and should not be put down for future consideration...unless you mean to put it down by shooting it...like Old Yell'r (sob....sob...). I can't speak to the rest of their beers durability cuz they didn't survive the weekend they arrived at my house. They brew very good beers, just don't wait to drink them."
"Drinkability...the aroma alone is worth cracking one open but don't get the taste buds overly excited."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" light brown head above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades slowly to a continuous film of small bubbles, with nice lacing. Aroma is coffee, with a slight sour fruity tinge to it. Uh oh. Taste is actually reasonably well balanced between coffee and fruity (cherry?) tartness, sort a light lambic thing going on. Mouthfeel is average, maybe a bit above, with smoothness overcoming the sourness a bit, and drinkability is okay. Just have trouble believing this brew is supposed to be like this. And I would think a stout would last in good storage for longer than the prescribed 4 months. Oh well."
"This brew was VERY drinkable, however. I could go for a six-pack every now and again, were it available around here."
"The Creme Brulee Java Stout looks and smells pretty typical for the style, thick and black, brown head, a day-old coffee grounds smell, but the taste is, literally, the worst I have ever encountered in a beer. There are undertones of flavors mirroring the smell, but the only thing you're going to notice is the sourness--it's like a goddamn warhead, only it never wears off. I could only manage a few sips. I really wanted to like this, but even if you took away the pucker, it'd only be an average coffee stout; with it, however, it is undrinkable."
"Drinkability and Notes Â– An unexpectedly bad beer that I could not finish. Hopefully I will get another at some point so that I can see if this sourness is as prevalent in a fresh sample. While this was my only bottle of Kuhnhenn, I did visit the brewpub and enjoyed it thoroughly."
"Sweet, some bitterness comes through in the form of roast coffee, and then it goes sweet again. Plenty of milk chocolate and a bit of vanilla. Medium full bodied, very gentle carbonation. Too damn sweet."
"Fairly drinkable. There is so much coffee you could probably substitute this at a nice session with friends."
"I'll need to get another bottle or more to determine the infected theory. Still seemed OK to me in a way but the weird sour tone conjured up a bad vibe on this one. Sorry Tim, I think I'll need some more..."
"Rather light in the mouth but it could be a decent session brew."
"It pours a black color with a small ring of head over top. The nose is really nice. Almost like an iced french vanilla coffee milkshake. It smells really damn good. The flavor is not good. Its almost sour. None of the great full flavor of chocolate and coffee I expect. Bleh. Not right. The feel is light and lacking the creamy thickness that I want. This beer is like that hot girl I dated in high school that told me she wouldn't put out till marriage. It teases me with a voluptuous and complex aroma only to leave me blue-balled with the flavor, feel and drinkability. I just don't dig it."
"Pours a very dark color with a small head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is divine. Tons of chocolate, mocha, buttery, coffee, diacetyl, marshmallows. Smells like really good French vanilla coffee. The flavor is a huge let down. Has a strong sour thing going on that I don't care for. There is a slight coffee and chocolate flavor, but the sour is really in the majority of the flavor profile. Body is moderate at best. Drinkability isn't very good. The flavor is such a huge let-down from the aroma."
"other: no aftertaste save a slight generic kahlua leftover. raspberry eisbock, somewhat overhyped but great. this beer is a total failure in all respects, and similar reviews show i didn't have a bad bottle. i just won't be accepting of a beer this off with an average score. i hope my 4th dementia bottle is better and worth what i gave up in the trade."
"Same as above, but I have found, drank straight from the bottle, the flavor is much more intense and enjoyable. Taste went from 2.5 to 3.5. Just my findings. Cheers!"
"The mouthfeel is extremely thick and chewy, definitely a sipping beer. Because the beer is so overwhelming I don't think I could have more than one in a sitting. This is a unique brew, but one that I have to be in the right mood for."
"Overall I find it amazing that these flavors can even exist in a beer, let alone in such a way that is well balanced and easy to drink. Drinkability only suffers from my point of view because this is a desert beer and I personally can't drink more than one of these in a sitting."
"Well done K Bro's."
"Pours out to a nearly opaque very dark brown, forming a small tan head despite a vigorous pour. Poor retention and absent lacing. Carbonation is mild. The aroma is predominated by black coffee, a ton of vanilla, caramelized and burnt sugar, and deeply roasted grains. Very nice aroma. Medium thin body and stinging mouthfeel. Hrmmm. The taste is odd. It's sour, and I think I better gobble this up before it gets any more sour, as it's barely tolerable now. Perhaps it's just a bad bottle. Not sweet at all, and not stoutish at all, this reminds me of the Reaper Ale with the wierd sourness. I'll have to revisit this, as this must be a bad batch (see Jetsbeer review, which was also Feb 2005). For now, I'll call it as I see it."
"It's nearly black, without much head. It smells like chocolate milk, perhaps with subtle smoke and coffee notes. It tastes like chocolate milk, but with a bit of a tangy, white-winey snap at the end. There is also a fine-textured effervescence. Not bad at all."
"Aroma is of coffee with some sweetness. Had on nitro tap. Taste is great. It seems like I am drinking custard. The carmelized sugar is definitely present without being overwhelming. This might taste good with some orange flavor too. I've never quite drank anything like this before. Quite a unique combination. The stout works beautifully with the coffee and carmelized sugars. Sweetness with roasted notes. It takes you on an interesting taste journey through the glass. Have when fresh. A repeat visit some weeks later would cause me lower my ratings by 0.5. I think this is one of the most solid efforts by Kuhnhenn. Very smooth mouthfeel. I also tried the bottled version and it didn't have the mouthfeel or the carmelized sugars in great presence."
"This is why we BAs try new beers. CrÃ¨me Brulee pours virtually black, with just ever so subtle highlights of deep mahogany around the edges. It's topped by a toffee colored head. The aroma is reminiscent of sweet hot chocolate, with vanilla and caramel notes mixed in with the coffee and chocolate. The flavor is absolutely mind blowing. Heavy cream, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel, molasses, and then the hints of hops and roasted malt. The aftertaste is cocoa sweetness with a touch of hop bitterness. Caramel and dark chocolate lingers on the tail end. The flavor draws out for a good while, and you could really stretch a pint of this beer. Very easy to sit and savor, but just as easy to have more than a couple. The mouthfeel is just ultra creamy, silky, sexy. I considered skipping my flight for this beer, but thankfully they provided me with a couple bottles for the trip home. This is that beer that falls into the top 1% of beers you drink. I feel enriched having had the opportunity to experience it. I will pine for a return trip to the Motor City and Kuhnhenn."
"Thanks again Clark! This Kuhnhenn stout sure does resemble the acclaimed Founders Breakfast stout. It is very dark brown and proposes a nice off-white ring. Its aroma is an overwhelming espresso medley, not even beany, this wins big points considering the vanilla undertones. I rarely encounter them without this usually unpleasant beany aspect. Strong chocolate complexities make this a total dessert brew. Strongly carbonated body, medium in size. It has pleasant sweet and tart vanilla essence notes that match the chocolate in an overall sweet flavour profile that doesnÂ’t quite match the aroma, but this remains a surprisingly good stout."
"Split a bottle of this lovely beer the other night, I was quite excited about having something called Creme Brulee Java Stout. Sounds like heaven in a bottle! It wasn't quite that, but still good. The beer was very dark brown, reddish up to the light, with a light brown fat head that settles down to a thin layer which lasts throughout the glass. The aroma kind of got to me. It took me a few sniffs before I was OK with it. I thought it smelled like sweet sweet coffee with the slightest creaminess, some sourness, and covered in dust from some attic. Really, I got a weird musty smell mixed in with the roasty desserty goodness. Tasted better than it smelled, thankfully. There is a highly acidic flavour which helps to balance out the sweetness and roastiness of the beer, so no one taste is overpowering. I got a dry, almosty fruity (grapey?) aftertaste. Not bad. Mouthfeel was good and creamy, not too thick though. Drinkability for me is not the best- I would maybe have this again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get ahold of a bottle. Mainly because the sour musty smell kept punching me in the face, and not in a real good way. The taste made up for that a bit, but didn't cancel it out. I was glad for the opportunity to taste it though!!"
"Dark black with red ruby edges. Head is tan coloured in nature and billowy. The aroma screams of strong dark roasted colombian coffee beans, roasted malts also come into play. There is also a slight hint of vanilla in the background. The taste is all roasted coffee. Bitter and acidic. There is also a sweetness in the background and hints of vanilla bean, sugar, and perhaps even the creme brulee that this brew is named after. The mouthfeel is light, considering all of the flavor that is packed into this gem. It's also acidic and a little lactic on the tongue. One can certainly tell that a double/imperial version of this brew beefed up to about 10%abv with a thick-ass mouthfeel would be legendary. Hopefully the brothers Kuhnhenn take note! Drinkability is good as well, but not perfect. The mouthfeel and acidic sweetness of this could get annoying after a while. But if I had a six pack in front of me, it would probably be gone by the end of the night. Another majestic creation from this brewery that sits amongst my personal favorites. Thanks to walleye for the sample!"
"SlÃ inte!"
"Not an adult beer. I'm not sure how much of this is natural and how much is petroleum-based flavoring agent."
"from the tap at the brewery.pored black brown a nice size tan head. aroma hazelnut caramel,dark cherries, Irish cream. flavor same as above. wow this is a greak java even though this is differant than bells java it is far better I just hope they keep brewing this."
"After having the blueberry that these guys make, this was the coffee with my pancakes. Wow, what a great dessert beer. I love the look of the dark beers, and this one doesn't dissapoint. Nice chocolate mix with toffee creme head. After all the beers I sampled at the World Beer Festival yesterday, this was the most unique. The combination of flavors and smells was off the planet. Vanilla, coffee, caramel, creme, malty, thick and yummy!!! Sweet, but not sickly sweet. I would love to have this with creme brule'. Wow, what a beer!"
"What a great chance to try some of the different brews from this place yesterday at the World Beer Fest,this poured a deep dark brown with an almond colored head awesome aromas of caramel and dark roast coffee this hit the nose and woke me up.Taste couldnt get any better like eating vanilla/caramel ice with a hint of coffee.The mouthfeel was amazing like biting into a marshmellow cant think of a better dessert beer I have ever had thats for sure.next time I go home I might have to take a trip down to Warren for this place."
"One of the most unique and impressively creative beers I've ever tried."
