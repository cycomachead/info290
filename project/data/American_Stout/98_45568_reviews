"Chocolaty but a bit chalky too.  Malt forward but not my favorite.  A bit bitter"
""
"Sweet dark chocolate aroma. Black body with a light brown head that quickly thins. Dark unsweetened chocolate taste that I can't identify. Roasted malt is more present than the chocolate in the taste. Mildly bitter."
"A Stout as a session beer? That's nearly what this was as it felt weak and I couldn't taste or detect the alcohol when I finally made my way through this. Some dark fruits, booze, and maybe another chocolate malt would have taken this up another level and with offerings like the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout still on the shelf, why reach for this? It's only a go if you plan on downing a few at a time to go with your dessert of the moment."

"Worst chocolate stout I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
"First sip is a rush of fake chocolate sweetness, with a thin body.  This is not a nice, malty, sweet flavor... rather more like Starbucks coffee syrup. I really dislike this beer, and this is the third time I've tried it before reviewing it."
""
""
""
""
"Not too sweet, not too bitter. For a stout it has a little too much carbonation for my liking. Overall a very drinkable beer"
""
""
"Pours dark chocolate color with little to no head. Nose is heavy in chocolate, cocoa like. Taste pretty much follows suit. It does meet the requirements for the style, but personally I can't drink more than one of these. Somebody left a six pack of this at my house, it's not a beer I would ever seek out and buy. I personally don't understand why somebody would want their beer to taste like chocolate - that's why there's cocoa. I could see it if there was a hint of chocolate, but this one is way over the top with the chocolate. It is what it purports to be and meets the style guidelines but I really don't like it and find it somewhat of a chore to drink."
""
"I was surprised at how good of a job harpoon did with this chocolate stout.  Hate to say, but I expected mediocrity, and at $1.49 a bottle from total wine, how would you not?  Pours thick, dark brown to black. Med to heavy body, coating the mouth with each sip. Nice chocolate taste, not too overwhelming, my only issue is an odd lingering aftertaste.  Well done though, harpoon!"
"All in all, this beer is pretty much what it sets out to be and is a really great dessert beer."
"I drink a lot of beer. This is my very favorite chocolate stout!"
""
"This sentence exists because I have to rationalize my opinion."
""
"It was a very good beer. I had it as part of a mixer sixer and want to try it again."
"Not much chocolate flavor, poor mouthfeel."

"Extremely dark color. Nice lace from smaller head. Rich cocoa flavor tapering off to a malt finish. Good find since its a limited time brew."
"Great chocolate full body flavor."
""
""
"Edit- after reading other reviews, I will agree with those who would say this beer tastes better the warmer it gets;"
"O –I wanted to ding this as a light weight when I drank it cold, but letting it warm made it very enjoyable, and original, a neat mix of a lot of chocolate and caramel coffee with a dry roast stout base."

"Overall – A decent chocolate brew that was surprisingly dry in light of its aroma. Nothing too exceptional, but a nice try and a decent choice (in light of its price) for a darker and more drinkable chocolate stout."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent chocolate stout. There's a lot of chocolate and coffee stouts out there and this one doesn't distinguish itself as a must-drink, but it's a solid dessert beer option."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is, appropriately, chocolate above all else. I get the milk chocolate goodness all over, with a brief finish of bittersweet completing the journey. This one definitely delivers what it promises, and is as superb a ""chocolate stout"" as I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This was a pretty damn good beer but definitely not the best chocolate stout out there. Still impressed with the smoothness and drink ability."
""
"I also had a stout (Heart Of Darkness) from Magic Hat Brewing Company in the same session and I enjoyed the Harpoon more."
""
""
"Medium bodied. A little too light for my taste."
""

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours pitch black with a small light brown head. Smells of chocolate, caramel, and slight coffee and toffee. Tastes of chocolate, vanilla, slight coffee, but a tad watery. Beer is carbonated correctly, light bodied, drinkable but heavy enough for the winter season. Overall, a pretty good beer."
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Decent foamy head, with some nice beer ring lacing. Nose is chocolaty with some roasted malt. Roasted malt, and hefty amounts of chocolate. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"Definitely a chocolate stout, no doubt about that. Don't expect much complexity with this one.. if you're looking for chocolate beer, drink this."

"Overall - Almost more like chocolate syrup than a rich chocolate flavor. This is above average but certainly nothing special. If you like Hershey syrup in 1% milk or Yoo-hoo this is the alcoholic version of that. Take it or leave it but it's taste enough to be above average."
""
"O - Stouts aren't usually my thing, but this is a good mid-level offering. It certainly lives up to it's name. Not grossly sweet like some stouts, and the flavor is actually pretty decent. For what it is, I'd recommend it."

"dark dark dark with an eggshell foam on top. this beer will make the whole room smell like a chocolate factory. it definitely tastes like chocolate - dark unsweetened 80% cacao chocolate. smooth on the tongue. an absolute delight. hadn't seen it around in a year or two. glad to see it back. I probably wouldn't have more than one in a night but will keep a few in the fridge to keep those upcoming wintertime blues away."
"Overall: Harpoon is from my home city so i try to forget my bias, but this is a great version of a chocolate or American Stout. They got it right mostly."

"I really like this stout. The chocolate smell is one of the most pronounced of any beer claiming ""chocolate"" in the title. The drink greets with chocolate near the front of the tongue, but in the back of the mouth there is the roasted coffee beans aspect. It turns bitter as it goes down. I will get this again next Christmas."
""

""
""
"O - Pass on this one"
"O- simplistic stout, yet very drinkable. Pretty one dimensional but makes a good dessert beer that isn't too heavy. Reminds me of a poor mans Sam Smith Chocolate Stout."
"notes: decent, tasty, easy drinking, great aroma. This beer would benefit from a bigger mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this beer achieves its goal. Its a light stout with a very chocolate forward profile, no booze to make it appealing to more than beer connoisseurs and its perfect as a dessert substitute. People have been too harsh on this. Ratings would be higher if people just considered what it set out to do. But...what can you expect of people"
"Taste-Herbal hop note, cocoa powder, dry finish. Flavors are not quite in harmony as they seem to exist seperately without complementing each other. Interesting but unbalanced."
""
""
"Overall: ""Less is more", pretty much defines this beer. The chocolate hint and roasted malt presence make it very easy to enjoy and a perfect brew for a cold night with some type of chocolate dessert. It gets creamier and the chocolate flavor is more pronounced as it warms, so let it sit at room temperature for a bit the enjoy it better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent stout."
"Bud Light mixed with NESQUICK. Also on the bottle stating ""Ale with """"NATURAL"""" chocolate flavor. Anything that says natural is not quite natural. Limited Edition... thank christ. It's a good thing this beer was free because if I would have spent money on it i would spit it in the closes face near me."

"This is a really lovely beer, I especially love that chocolatey aroma that hits you immediately upon cracking the cap off. One thing that makes Harpoon beers so great is the intersection of great beer and not too expensive. There are definitely better chocolate stouts but they tend to cost more, and for a local Bostonian, ya gotta love a good Harpoon. They need to start serving Harpoon Chocolate Stout at the party at the end of the Brewery to Brewery 148 mile bicycle ride!"
""
"As I mentioned above, this kind of tastes like a watered-down chocolate liqueur with some overly sweet Tootsie Roll extract syrup. It's not the worst beer I've ever tasted (far from it), and it's not the worst thing I've ever tasted from Harpoon (I'm looking at you, Golden Wizard), but it's remarkably not good."
""
""
""
"O - I think the amount of chocolate was just right, but a little short on maltiness in the taste and mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"Nice sweet chocolate flavors start this out. Vanilla sweetness fights its way in and this finishes with a slight dry note. Graham crackers, toffee bars, and more chocolate. This is sweet, for sure, but it's not overbearing in any way. I wouldn't mind having this in my fridge. Another hit for Harpoon."
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 3/15/2013. Pours clear almost pitch black color with a 1 finger fairly dense mocha head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big milk chocolate, chocolate syrup, toffee, vanilla bean, light roasted malt, caramel, and light coffee. Very nice aromas with big chocolate notes and nice balance. Taste of milk chocolate, vanilla bean, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, toast, coffee, and light cream. Slight coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, roasted malt, and coffee on the finish for a good bit. Good flavor balance with a fair amount of robustness; but it feels a little watered down for a stout; zero cloying flavors are present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is ok; feels a bit thin. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good sweet stout. Fairly robust with nice chocolate dessert flavor; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"On tap at Sticks and Stones.Poured ink black into a standard pint glass with a thin almost non existent head atop.Aromas were all fudge with some underlying roast,a dessert beer no doubt.Big sweetness from the fudge-like chocolate flavors on the palate,some underlying vanilla but the chocolate is the major player here.There is just enough roast and dryness to keep it from being overly cloying.Take this beer for what it is,it's a sweet chocolate stout and it's true to form."
"I poured this exception beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was black and poured a rich full head that was also very dark. WOW!, the smell was supreme chocolate with a hazel nut smell. The taste was terrific, nutty, chocolate warmth that is the best beer I have tasted this winter. I would certainly buy again. Yummy!"

"I don't care what the critics say but this is a extremely nice stout. The chocolate is a bit overwhelming but I like that in a stout. The mouthfeel lingers and is pleasant, from a stout lover I give this two thumbs up. It is not overwhelmed with high alcohol volume so it is a great fast sipper and has wonderful flavors."
""
"This beer lacks flavors and any real body that one must associate with this style. Had a very weak finish with low carbonation and no real aftertaste. Overall not a good experience. Just to make sure this was not a skunked bottle I had another before I wrote this review and had the same experience."

"Harpoon Chocolate Stout has a black look to it. It's a stout so that's expected. Anywho, the liquid is black and the cap up top is a half inch of dark tannish foam leaving no lace on the glass. The liquid looks dead after a while but some swirls bring it back. This smells straight up like chocolate syrup. It reminds me of a less Diabetic form of Southern Tier Choklat. Basically, it smells like chocolate and some roasted malt, nothing else, a str8 up chocolate stout, no bells or whistles. Taste is chocolate, mixed in with slight grain notes and a roasty finish reminding me of a light porter, even though this remains in the stout category. Body is a step below medium with a light but felt carb. Truthfully, I could drink a lot of this and still like it after a while. The body is at a level where long sips or even chugging is possible, so drinkability is quite high. This was a surprise and a treat at the same time. I see myself drinking more of this in the future willingly. Hey, what do you know, a Harpoon beer that I want to come back to. I actually prefer this over Choklat as I can drink more than 4oz's of it."
""
"O- This is one of the most flavorful chocolate stouts I have had, and I really like it because it isn't too sweet. It reminds me of stealing those slightly bitter chocolate chips from my mom when she was baking cookies. But I docked on the mouthfeel. It was way lighter than I expected, and just didn't feel like a stout. If it was thicker, this would be one of my favorites. Of course I would get this again, but I can only imagine what it would taste like with that creamy yummy feel..."
""
"This is a delicious chocolate stout that is not too heavy, nor overpowering in it's flavors. I generally prefer the intensity of some other heavier, more bitter, dark chocolate, and coffee stouts, but still liked this rich brew. Easily drinkable, and enjoyable. A bottle, or few, would make a nice end of the evening treat."

"if you are a chocoholic, this is your beer. probably the most chocolatey of any beer ive ever tasted. its impressively chocolately! wow. the pour is dense and black, a lot like hersheys syrup in both color and viscosity, small tan head fades fast. the nose is not as sweet as it should be for how much chocolate is the in the flavor, but you know its coming from one whiff. so rich and decadent, like dessert. the flavor is sweet milk chocolate all the way through, like a candy bar really, but not offensively sugary at all, its very palatable, i love the dark roasted malts with the gourmet chocolate flavor. its a really awesome holiday beer, it blows people away everytime i share this with anyone, the chocolate is just so intense. huge body, sticky thick, with mellow carbonation but it doesnt feel heavy. this is the highlight of the harpoon winter pack, and a very very unique and special beer. a solid A in my book."
""
"O - If the beer tasted as good as it smelled, I probably would have rated it around a 4..."
""
""
""
"Overall: I really did enjoy this beer, though I wish it lived up to that awesome smell. A nice piece in the winter sampler I got."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just don't be fooled - this is not as chocolatey as you are expecting, my fellow chocoholics! A good winter beer nonetheless."
""
"Strong aroma is seriously decadent, mainly sweet chocolate with hints of - is that cherry? - as well as caramel and roast coffee. It pours a rich sable just a snip above black with a very thick and quite persistent tan head. Malty flavor has a strong overtone of chocolate, decadent and not too sweet, hints of coffee and caramel, just a whisper of fruit. Texture, though, is a bit weak - body and fizz are both lacking. However, that is the only weak spot in an otherwise scrumptious brewski. Finish is chocolaty and just a little smoky. Overall, quite satisfying."
"O: Solid. If you like sweeter stouts you will not enjoy this one as it is mostly darker and bitter chocolate flavors."
"what is about this beer how could you screw up a chocalate stout as someone said it it a dessert stout wtf what that wreid taste in there . really you blew this with a funky taste that taste like a after dinner mint , how can you mess this up but you did sad"
""
""
"O: A very tasty chocolate stout that delivers the chocolate without being overly sweet and cloying. Not sure why this is rated so low... not the best stout, but it is what it's advertised to be"
"I had this in a bottle. The pour was very good. Super dark with a little bit of head. The smell was perfect. Absolutely rich in chocolate. The taste was less than expected. I smelled the bottle first and then the beer itself and was absolutely thrilled with how chocolatey it was. The beer itself left something to be desired with the flavor. The smell probably set me up for unmet expectations. The beer was a bit lighter in body than I would prefer from a stout. It went down somewhat smooth but it was certainly a bit more fluffy that I prefer. Overall I'm happy enough to drink out the 6er but I'll probably try something else next time."
""
""
"This is a very nice chocolate stout here. A good drinking stout that doesnt feel to sweet or dessert like. Very nice."
""
"O-good beer if you really dig chocolate. Isn't real complex but I didn't mind it. Probably have it again"
"Overall: While not anticipating unrivaled greatness, I had fully assumed I was jumping into a downright solid brew. Instead, I kind of didn't like it."

"O: A very simple brew. A bit of chocolate and a bit of vanilla and we're done. No real roasted malt flavor, it's mostly chocolate malt it seems."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. It was rich, sweet, and had just about everything a chocolate stout should have. In the flavoring, however, we wished that it came on a bit sweeter, as the chocolate seemed subdued and not thoroughly integrated by the end of the glass. Otherwise, this was an easy drinking, and rather tasty stout."

"Overall the beer beer looked good, great aroma and then the taste was totally dominated by chocolate. I know it is a chocolate stout, however, it was a little too one dimensional to me."
""
"Overall-the consistency of this beer was off-putting to me and so I recommend other versions of this style. Has some other things going for it if you can get past the mouthfeel, I couldn’t."
"O- Not bad. Will have again. Nothing but chocolate and malt."
"Rather smooth but ya better like/love chocolate!"
""
""
"Worth a try for sure."
""
""
"Kind of a less creamy version of Youngs, put it on nitro tap it would probably be about the same."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Reminds me a bit of Young's Double Chocolate stout. Certainly not the most complex beer, and a little artificial tasting with all the milk chocolate, but I wouldn't turn down another one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Other than the thin mouthfeel, this is a solid chocolate stout. Probably has the strongest chocolate flavor of all the chocolate stouts I've tried. I liked the Rogue better though."
""
"All told, this is a good beer. Don't be off-put by the aroma because the chocolate definitely gives way to the other flavors in a balanced fashion. Good little beer, glad I got to try it."
""
"O..It is a coin toss between average and above average; I went with the latter since it's hard to say no to a beer. I doubt I will go out of my way for this one next winter, but won't say no if offered a pint."
"Overall: Eh. It's got some interesting flavor and might be worth one try, but it doesn't really extend beyond that. Flavors lack depth and complexity."
"Pours a dark brown, with a dark tan mocha cream head. Aroma is alittle off putting, something may be slightly off. In the taste, chocolate syrup, mild roasted qualities, but mainly chocolate syrup. Medium to full bodied ale, creamy and smooth. Overall, a bit one dimensional but not a bad beer here from Harpoon. Lots of chocolate flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not too shabby for a stout. Had this up in Windsor last month for the first time and thought it was good on draft. I would still drink it again, but probably off draft next time around. Still delicious."
"Taste is exactly as described...chocolate. Roasted malts, with vanilla and milky cream. It is super smooth and easily drank. Very tastey, light, and full of flavor without being too sweet or candy-like. Very good brew and an amazing liquid desert to any meal. Go grab a few, as this is one brew even the non-beer drinker would like to try."
""
""
"Poured a 1/2"" mocha head which disappeared quickly. Dark clear raw umber brown colored body. Smell is heavy on the dark chocolate and has some malt. Taste follows the smell with rich dark chocolate and only a subtle amount of toasted malt. Body is far lighter than I'd expect, maybe the lights chocolate stout I've ever had. It's a decent desert beer, not heavy at all, but also not the most oppulent of its class."
""
"Smells fantastic but fails to deliver in the taste and feel. Enjoyable enough."
""
""
""
"O: I found this to be a really good stout. Even better fresh at the brewery and would make for a good sessioner around the holidays."
""
""
""
""
"O-A decent beer, the dark chocolate was a fresh take on the chocolate beers I've had so far."
"In any case, Harpoon Chocolate Stout is decent and probably more suited to a session beer than other Chocolate Stouts. But it's not quite the real thing!"
"I had a very similar experience to in the bottle with the the growler version of this beer. I actually thought this was smoother than I remember coming from a growler. Probably most likely due to a lower carbonation, but also likely to be because it was fresher and refridgerated its entire life. The chocolate flavors also seemed to be more preserved than I remember them."
""
"D- This is a good beer that I would be happy to have again, in fact I'm gonna have another one right now, but in the end I'd give it up to try something new in a heartbeat."
"Pours jet black with a light brown head. In the aroma, sweet cocoa. In the taste, roasted malts and a big sweet cocoa flavor all the way through. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry, roasty chocolate like aftertaste. A really nice stout with some sweet cocoa in it, not too shabby."
""
"Overall it's definitely something I would consider again. I believe this is by far the best beer I ever had from this brewery. Get a six pack or case if you can!"
"O: A very good stout that's satisfying and easy to drink. I don't know if I'd buy the Harpoon winter pack just for this, but I do know that I'd have no trouble getting six-packs of this stuff. Nice work, Harpoon."
"O: Good. I like my stouts kind of dessert-like, and this one pulls it off."
""
"O - A decent chocolate stout, but a little too candied for me. Wanted a bit more bitterness to balance and give some structure/backbone to the brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this, I could see myself having this again. It doesn't really deliver as a knockout, but for a good drinkable regular stout in a six-pack, the aroma alone might be enough to sell it."
""
"Overall it was pretty good, not at the world class level but a good take on the style."
""
" Thiis chocolate stout is tasty with plenty of chocolate malt up front, but it is no fudgesicle either. It is a solid base stout with some roasted malt character and there is a nice addition of cocoa giving a slight dessert like character with the general sweetness of the caramel in the malt. The taste is slightly bitter with some light herbal hop flavors in the background but generally this is a malt dominated beer with leaning more to the sweet side than dry which makes the taste seem fuller. I enjoyed this since it is not cloying yet it achieves the goal of incorporating the chocolate into the stout well, I would go for this again if the opportunity were to present itself."
"Edit/addendum - This beer is extremely filling. After two of them I feel like I've ate a three course meal."
""
""
"EDIT: Got a growler while in Boston later that week. Remember it being better on-tap, nonetheless, it was a good choice again."
""
""
"O - A decent chocolate stout, excellent aroma, but a bit lacking on the flavor. A heavier chocolate flavor instead of coffee would benefit this beer."
"not a bad beer. pretty good by harpoon standards. i will revisit this again, but it definitely isn't my favorite sweet stout."
""
""
""
"o'verall, diggin it, might gotta swoop another now that i've imbibed. solid."
"Sample provided by alex at the Dutch. Deep brown color, nice silky tan head, good retention. Semi sweet chocolate arouses thr nose. Thr taste is like drinking cold ""hot chocolate."" sweet and muted, glad the chocolate is not over the top. I could not see me drinking more than one of these, but rather tasty none the less."
""
""

"A candy bar in a pint glass that surprisingly works. Maybe not a stout that I could have more than one in a sitting, but unique, flavorful, and balanced."
"O: I just cant get ever how much like chocolate milk this tastes. Its not that it taste bad, but very weird."
"O: Harpoon's chocolate stout is another example of slick marketing and the look and feel being the best part of a beer. Led to believe it would be a warming, chocolaty holiday treat, its actually a thin, watery and oddly bitter let down. Look elsewhere to satisfy your sweet tooth this season."
"O - A big, chewy stout with surprising drinkability, and a fantastic grain character. On the sweeter side of the style, but not to any determent imho."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is jet black, with an oily brown head that is densely packed, small, tight bubbles that form a half inch layer of foam. Decent lacing when you swirl the brew in the glass. The nose is all milk chocolate, and it smells like freshly melted, hot milk chocolate. Like you broke into the Hershey factory and took a bath in a vat of chocolate. My sweet tooth just creamed itself. Flavors are a bit more blended, with the chocolate front and center, but a good balance of dark roasted coffee to provide some bitterness to counter the sweet. A little burnt/charred character, also. Very well blended flavors keep the beer from being cloying or overly rich. Bravo. The aftertaste is fairly nondescript, with a slight milky flavor to it. The aftertaste is almost like when your mom made your chocolate milk for you, and by no means did she ever use enough syrup. That's the aftertaste, although as a child it was disappointing, it's fairly pleasant here. The finish is surprisingly dry, leaving a fairly clean palate behind to allow the drinker to continue the chocolatey indulgence. Very tasty brew, while still providing a good representation of the style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very fark opaque brown with a mocha brown 2 finger head. Had started foamy, but settled down to trace of lacing then just a thin layer that clung well. Aroma switched between bitter chocolate, malt, and lactose sugar. As it rested it shifted to a Hershey's chocolate bar aroma. Flavor was interesting. It definitely had chocolate notes, but wasn't a cohesive flavor. Started off a bit like milk, but then left a watery chocolate flavor in the mouth as it finished. And then if you thought about it, it finished off with a bitter burnt oat flavor. Felt ok in the mouth, a bit acidic, but coated well, needed a tad more carbonation. Overall it was just average. Wasn't an off putting chocolate flavor, but wasn't a strong stout either. Kind of ended up being wishy washy."
"O- Very good, dead on to what their intentions were."
"Overall, this is a good chocolate stout, though perhaps slightly too heavy on the milk chocolate flavoring, as the beverage does tend to come across sweet--like a big shot of chocolate syrup into a slightly-too-small cup of coffee. Still, the flavors are good, and the beer goes down easily."
"One of the better choclate beers I've had recently. Would love to try a fresher one for comparison purposes"
"y nice robust caramel smell mixed with aromas of coffee and hints of roasted nuts and a touch of chocolate., great frothy and fluffy mouthfeel and just all around benefit to the palate. Lots of caramel flavors and again a bit of a smoked hint at the back. Small flavors of roasted nuits, chocolate and hints at black coffee. Very nice, but the mouthfeel was absolutly pefect. Light, balanced, a drinkers stout."
"This is a drinkable chocolate stout, but it's difficult to look past the flavors of cheap cocoa. Reminds me of an inferior Rogue Chocolate Stout. Goes well with dark chocolate candy."
"O - One of the most chocolate flavored beers I've tried. I appreciated the brewer's boldness but this brew may have gone too far with the cocoa for some. I found the level fine but was disappointed with the particular quality of the chocolate flavor and the fact that the flavors did not gel as well as one might hope. Should work well as a dessert beer."
"Mouth is ok, a little thin- maybe even a lot thin- but its not the biggest problem here. This beer is just kinda gross all around. The worst chocolate stout I've had by far and extremely disappointing. Drain pour."
"M/D: On the lighter side of medium. Pretty easy drinking with a nice chocolate flavor as advertised. The aftertaste isn't great, but I didn't really expect this beer to be amazing."
"D: It's hard to achieve high drinkability and super chocolatiness. I'm usually one and done with these even though I do enjoy them. This one's no exception, but the one is quite drinkable."
"D-I could have a couple at a sitting, but no more, very good, but very heavy...overall a really good chocolate stout in my book. Great for winter."
"-Very drinkable, and could definitely see myself drinking more than one in a sitting. Could start with it, and wake up the next morning and start asking wondering..."
"mouthfeel is the worst aspect of this beer IMO. on the thin and watery side. somewhat chalky. OK drinkability."
"an easy drinker, but 2 would be more than enough. overall a simple beer, the chocolate is there, but nothing blowing me away. ive had better chocolate stouts, but ive always had worse."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty good, fairly solid Chocolate Stout. Worth a try if it's available in your area. Not the best I've had, but far from the worst beer either. I was more than happy to try this. As I've stated before, I love Stouts and Porters and this one would pair well with those ""chilly"" evenings. It's not overly heavy or filling."
"Overall, it has a solid taste and definitely makes those cold Northeast nights much better. If you're looking for a nice casual seasonal from a local brewery, why not give this a try?"
"Cheers!!"
"Harpoon never stops producing excellent beers, this beer is no exception."
"I don't know why this isn't under vegetable fruit beer, unless thee is no real chocolate in here. Still, as far as flavored beers go not too bad."
"D- I love and live for stouts... this is not one of them... It's like Manhatten coffee soda meets really shitty beer... so disapointed!"
"Low carbonation"
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a dark, dark brown with a foamy 1 finger tan head that quickly dissipates into a thick collar. Fairly active carbonation...I can see quite a few bubbles breaking on the surface, can't see a thing through the almost pitch blackness of the glass. There is a deep, rich aroma of both chocolate and coffee!Smells like something you would order from your favorite coffee place. 1st sip brings a mild taste of roasted malt, dark unsweetened chocolate, and black coffee. The taste is much less intense than the aroma, which is a bit of a disappointment. Mouthfeel is bright and has a nice sparkle to it from the carbonation. Drinkability is good, but not exactly off the charts. I could sip on one or two on a cold January night. Overall, a good, but not quite great beer. I wouldn't turn it down, but if the flavor matched the aroma, this would be something quite special."
"D - Pretty good, the two in the variety pack were a good choice. If one was offered to me I would have again for sure."
"Harpoon does well by me!"
"D: Very happy to have tried this one. A nice, light easy drinking stout. I assume the ABV was a bit higher than what's listed here, but either way I didn't notice it at all. There was a nice warming feeling I got from the chili though. Doubt I'll see this again, but would order if I do"
"Pours a near black with a one-finger light brown head. Quickly disappears and no lacing as well. Nice aroma. A lot of chocolate. A big chocolate syrup aroma is the most overpowering. Taste follows, but much milder. Same artificial chocolate flavor, some roasted chocolate and a little bit of dark fruit hops to finish it out. Smooth and not dry."
"Pours a a near black color but lets a bit of light through its murky edges, almost no head. Scent is an odd, but pleasing mix of bitter chocolate and artificial powdered chocolate drink and not much else. Taste brings the muddledness described in scnet... oddly artificial yet bitter and lacking much sweetness, some aggressive non choclatey anb bitter roast note. Beer is fuller side of medium bodied, certain sips felt light while other chalky and even some silky smooth, almost like a drink that needed to be shaken or stirred first. Had hopes for this beer, but oddly thrown together."
"Taste is smooth bitter chocolate, very little sweetness and a nice hop bite and roasted malt on the finish. Pretty nice little surprise here from Harpoon, very drinkable and body is silky smooth. A light chalky fruitiness shows some yeast character as it warms. Pretty good beer. I have a feeling I will have to buy another sixer of this if I want to have any for 2011."
"D- A solid American stout. I like the chocolate flavors. It could be a bit richer and thicker, but the flavor is nice and fits well into the winter mix pack."
"D - It's pretty drinkable. Tastes good, goes down pretty easily. Nothing to complain about really."
"D/M: strong carbonation tingle, very smooth across the pallet, slight dark chocolate taste lingers on the pallet"
"D- A good beer for sitting around with friends at a christmas party. (this was exactly what I did) Makes you feel a little warmer, but not so much that you want to drift off to sleep."
"Drinkability: A good, sweet, dessert beer that is not cloying. Easy to drink and enjoyable- this could be a good gateway stout for beginners or a nice beer to have after dinner at a Christmas party."
"D: Pretty straight forward, but full flavored, a solid winter seasonal."
"The mouthfeel is quite thin but is on par with every other Harpoon seasonal/flavored porter and stout I have had and also expected because of the low ABV, which leads me to drinkability, which is obviously extremely high for the quality flavor and sessionability."
"D- Very drinkable as a stout. Not for desert only. The flavor is rather light"
"This was a fairly unexpected bottle when I found it at Fresh Market. I don't really know why, it just was. Deal with it. it pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of wan ecru foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, light roasted malts, and a touch of oatmeal. The taste's chocolate more closely resembles dark baking chocolate than the aforementioned syrup, which allows the roasted malts and coffee to shine through, mild bitterness and all. The body is a strong medium, with a light carbonation and a nearly chewy feel. Overall, a pleasantly surprising bit o' tasty darkness."
"This was a happy surprise while visiting the local gas station/best beer selection spot in town. I was first struck by the smell, all chocolate, like the Hershey's frisbee I had when I was a kid (that's a good thing). It poured nicely, but a little less head than I expected. The first taste was all chocolate and very smooth. After a few sips, I realized that although it has a full chocolate taste, it is not very sweet. I think this is why I love it so much. It's easy to drink several without feeling like your teeth are going to rot out by the time you are done. Another solid effort by Harpoon Brewing."
"A very chocolate oriented stout that is smooth and drinkable, just not sure how many I would want to have in one sitting."
"D) A delicious stout. I'd definitely drink another."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Best by 02/15/11 indicated on the bottle. Pours one shade shy of black with a fizzy, half inch mocha-colored head. Head eventually disperses into a band around the edges of the glass. No lacing on this one. Strong cocoa character in the nose, as well as lactose and artificial sweetener. Unfortunately, the artificial sweetener character is a little too overpowering. Taste consistent with nose; however, the cocoa character is somewhat chalky. Also, the flavor profile is somewhat more watered down than the nose would suggest. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light), with a lively carbonation. Not really loving this one. Flavor and mouthfeel are are a bit off. It was a lot of work to get through one pint."
"D/M: The flavor lacks a strong body. The beer is uncomfortably light and doesnt have much of a presence."
"d: Chocolate bomb, too one dimensional to have more than one of for me."
"Drinkability- good brew. But I can only handle one."
"D-This is a very delicious stout, and I could drink a number of these easily, but the bitter chocolate becomes a bit much after a while."
"Definitely the best Harpoon brew I have tried, and an amazing stout by itself."
"Drinkability: I wasn't sure if I was going to like this at first. It seemed too one-dimensional, but it definitely grew on me."
"Even mouthfeel, fairly full but tending toward slick, finishes dry. Tasty beer for the season, prtty drinkable."
"Very dark with ruby edges and a short tan cap that quickly faded to a thin collar. A bit of sticky, spotty lacing. The aroma was heavy on chocolate, lighter on roast, not much else. Smelled decent enough though and you wouldn't mistake it for something other than a chocolate stout. Bitterness was a little high and had a bit of spruce character that overpowered the sweetness up front. As it faded, the same roasty and chocolatey notes from the aroma came to the fore. Brown sugar and vanilla lingered. Fair texture, a bit of dryness from the dark malts, medium bodied with average carbonation. I enjoyed it, but would imagine they'd get cloying after a couple."
"D- As stated above, if you are a fan of lighter (and sweeter) stouts I definitely recommend this beer. Having a few will not leave you feeling rotund."
"D- This was a very drinkable beer which I enjoyed surprisingly a lot. Harpoon seems to make these beers which in turn needs to be in six packs here in Indiana if they already are."
"From the start, I'll say one thing about this beer--it's totally one dimensional. The second thing? I didn't care. Pours a very nice deep dark brown color with a slight mocha head. The nose is just a straight onslaught of chocolate notes. A bit of dark chocolate as well as some Hershey's syrup. The taste is more chocolate with just the tiniest hint of roast, but, who knows, maybe that's just coming from the chocolate as well. Nice somewhat full feel with good carbonation. Really nice and tasty."
" I recommend this beer and rate it high."
"Got an e-mail from my local package store about this one now available in limited supply so I unfortunately assumed it must be good if it's in limited supply, right? Not. I'm a big fan of this style but this one misses the mark. The nose smells of burnt chocolate, licorice or something. Alcohol also in the aroma but not once you taste it. I want to like it but just can't. Must be the fake chocolate or licorice I can't get by. Not a drain pour but I'm forcing the last five."
"Notes: I really enjoyed this beer and wished I could get more than what was in the mixed sample pack."
"D: Overall, surprisingly likable. The mouthfeel's not quite what I'd like, and the sour tinge could be better, but this is one of the better chocolate stouts I've tried."
"Pours an opaque brown with thin tan head. Smell is mostly of chocolate, with little bit of roasted malt. Taste has chocolate upfront, but not as much of the roasted flavour I'd expect. Very little bitterness. Very thin mouthfeel, not creamy like most stouts. This does taste nice and there are no off flavours, but it just isn't anything special."
"D: This is a decent offering from Harpoon. I think that if the body was improved, the overall taste would improve."
"Dark brown with ruby highlights and a thin coffee colored head that leaves thin lace behind. Dark chocolate, cocoa and light roasted coffee make up the aroma. Semisweet chocolate and coffee flavors with a tad too much hop bittering for the style. This beer tastes more like a Hersheys chocolate syrup than roasty chocolate malt to me. Light bodied and heavily carbonated, which feels weird for the style. This beer is not for me."
"Pours a flat black color with no head. There are a few islands of bubbles over top, but other than that and the ring of white around the edge of the top there is nothing in terms of head. I'd like a little more head and a little more life in this beer. The aroma is strong on the chocolate. There is a bit of roasted malt behind it, but the chocolate dominates. The flavor is less appealing than the aroma. It starts with a strong burnt malt flavor, like the mash may have been scortched the ashyness is so strong. From there it moves into a somewhat chemical-chocolate flavor, that fades to a mellow combination of roasted malt and chocolate. The finish on this beer is really nice, but what leads into it is not all that fantastic. Moutfeel is moderately thick with a pretty weak carbonation. This one would benefit by having some more body to it. The carbonation is where I would expect. Overall, this one is not doing it for me. The harshness of the burnt character and the sweetness of the chocolate don't play well together. Its not the worst chocolate beer I have had, but I wouldn't go for it again."
"D - Very drinkable. Good flavor and smooth body."
"A really enjoyable beer that is very drinkable. Really tasty brew and one I feel would be a great desert beer to end the night with, or one that would go well with cheeses. Recommend trying this while it's around."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, while there might be better beers in the style this is still a very solid beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"Mouthfeel is a little on the this side and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is OK at best. I liked the aroma it had but the finish really ruined the flavor for me. The chocolate just really didn't meld together with the beer for me."
"Pours very dark with a small tan head that quickly settles to a thin cap. Just a little lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is the best thing about this stout. Plenty of chocolate elements such as cocoa nibs, and bittersweet chocolate. A little smoke as well. Sadly the flavor does not live up to the aroma. The added chocolate is too dominating and not letting the malt play a flavoring role. A little fruit and coffee elements as well. Not overly complex or appealing chocolate flavor. Feels a little thin for a stout. Carbonation is nicely suited. Just an ok chocolate stout. Could definately use more malt and that would help the flavor and body immensely."
"Opaque dark brown with a medium head. Nose is very chocolaty, with molasses a hint of coffee, grapes and cherry. Flavour is again chocolate with a fruity edge. Big, but quickly disappearing bitterness in the back and a bit of tartness up front. Quite dry and a bit spicy. Moderate body with a hard carbonation, Could be a bit softer and slicker I think. Not terribly drinkable but some interesting flavours. Mouthfeel needs work."
"Serving Type: 12oz Bottle Vessel Type: Pint Glass Price:NA"
"This beer is unique. Its black as night with a caramel cream tint to its mostly white head. It smells memorizing, absolutely fantastic. Its aroma is that of a slightly bittersweet dark chocolate, with a hint of mocha. Its taste is bold, kinda like someone melted a really fine dark chocolate bar, mixed it with some Baileys and then carbonated it all. Its incredible. My initial reaction was surprise for such a bold taste, I had assumed it would be a much more subtle flavor, I was very pleasantly surprised. Its mouthfeel is slightly creamy. I've enjoyed this from both a bottle, and chilled pint glass, both were enjoyable, but I must say I preferred the bottle, the carbonation was heavier in the bottle, and really complements the bold flavor. Its drinkability pretty fine, they go back nice and easy, but then may not be a beer you could or would want to chain drink. It also made on of the greatest dessert beers I've ever enjoyed, It may be the greatest beer for a beerfloat (beer & ice cream, preferably coffee or vanilla) that I've tried. Overall I really enjoyed this beer, a lot more then i expected."
"D - This would be great with a chocolately dessert, thinking dark chocolate with some kind of fruit - raspberries, strawberries, cherries...would go great. By itself I think this is a one in a sitting type of beer. Quite enjoyable, but in moderation, but with dessert this can't be beat."
"I helped a friend out moving and he bought me some Harpoon. I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours opaque black with a fizzy white head, no lacing. Bittersweet chocolate rules the nose with a back drop of freshly ground coffee. The flavor of bakers chocolate runs through the beer. It is slightly more bitter than the nose indicates, not overwhelmingly so. IMO this is a bit thin for a stout, the carbonation is moderate. A decent beer that gets caught between a hearty stout and a desert beer."
"Dark brown, almost black color. Tan head laced nicely. Roasty, roasty, roasty on the nose. Rich, dark chocolate too. Somewhat sweet smelling. My wife smelt soy sauce. Not so sure about that one. A very rich, chocolate flavor (expected!). Flavors of coffee, cream, also a hop bite in there. The dark chocolate/coffee flavor stays there throughout the brew. A crisp, not too heavy of a mouthfeel. I found this pretty easy to consume. I'd drink another if I had one. It came from my buddies 12 pack sampler."
"Harpoon Chocolate Stout is probably best viewed as an Irish dry stout with much more hoppiness than is typical for that style. It's interesting and was fun to drink, but I have little or no need to do so again."
"D- I'm having trouble finishing this one, so I don't think much of it's drinkability."
"D- This is a great desserty style beer, awesome for after dinner or a cold snowy night. Just about anytime a mug of hot chocolate sounds good, this will one-up it."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a very deep dark brown with just the faintest of light shinning through with a tan creamy head that slowly goes into a ring with OK lacing. Nice chocolated and roasted malt aroma. Chocolate is the primary flavor here but not too sweet and not too bitter. Silky in the mouth and goes down easy. Not a bad stout."
"D-this is certainly one of the better chocolate stouts out there. No fake flavor. No detectable hop flavor so it might loose points for not being ""beer"" enough. great beer for the chocoholics."
"Drinkability: Another go to stout for my lineup. I would let it warm slightly and sit out to lose some carbonation but its a great stout and example of the style."
"This chocolate stout had a rich flavor, but was slightly too chocolatey. The mouthfeel was creamy, but because it was too sweet it is a beer that I would only drink on rare occasion. The smell was of strong chocolate/coffee. I would recommend this beer to someone who does not like the taste of hops."
"Amazing nose, but the flavor and feel of it just doesn't add up. A little more body and hops would make this pretty epic."
"Pours dark brown to black with a brown head. The aroma is milk chocolate and some roasted malts. The flavor is chocolate with something resembling chocolate milk in there as well. The flavor is pretty good, but the very end of the flavor as well as the aftertaste have something going on I didn't really like, though I am not sure how to describe it. The mouthfeel is creamy and the carbonation is medium to high."
"This beer fills you up, not one to drink too many of."
"This brew has an amazing nose, but the flavor and feel of it just doesn't add up. A little more body and hops would make this pretty epic."
"Pitch black beer with a rich foamy head.Aroma is and taste are chocolate malts and sweet cream.Smooth and delicious you could make a pretty damn good chocolate float out of one of these.Light years better than their winter warmer.It says only limited edition so I would recommend you try one before they are gone."
"-2 cool points."
"Drinkable as a treat, not an 'all nighter' by any stretch."
"Medium bodied, and a good amount of prickly carbonation keeps the sweetness from lingering. This was a nice treat, but I couldn't session this. Time to grab something bitter."
"I see this beer as the perfect dessert, whether it be with a meal or your last beer. I would take this beer over any cake or brownie any day! Great stout, harpoon definitely knew what they were doing with this one. I reccomend it"
"drinkable for sure, but not a session brew. nice for one during the winter months or at a party. switch to the Winter Warmer after this. or better yet, something lighter to move on to the next heavy winter ale."
"D: I wouldn't be able to handle more than one of these in a sitting."
"This is a good stout, it's not groundbreaking but it is very solid. If you see the Harpoon Wintry Mix, pick it up knowing you're getting a nice sampling of some good beer in a range of different styles."
"Pours a very dark brown color with less than a finger of tanned head. Doesn't have much retension outside of a thin lace on top of the beer. Nose is a mixture of sweet milk chocolate in the front and blends to coffee in the finish but mostly dominated by the sweet chocolate aroma. Taste is chocolately upfront with a little burnt grain bitterness in the finish, taste blends from chocolate to coffee just like the aroma. Moderate to high amount of carb and thin bodied. Very drinkable and would have it again."
"Poured into a Guinness glass: black/brown, with two fingers of beige head with great lacing and surprisingly evident carbonation. The smell was not surprisingly dominated by chocolate, and nothing but chocolate...cocoa powder and bittersweet dark chocolate. The taste confirmed this, with a smooth finish, and VERY dry afterwards. More carbonated than expected, but a little thin for the style. Certainly would benefit from a thicker mouthfeel, and possibly some more roasted maltiness."
"Overall, I'm really happy that Harpoon decided to release this outside of the winter mix pack. I feel like the flavor has improved from last years batch and that this should become a regular for Harpoon. I think if the carbonation were to be toned down a bit and the ABV bumped up a little, this could be an exceptional beer. As it is, it is damn tasty. Go pick some up."
"Pours almost black with a thick tan head. Excellent retention and lots of laceing.Aroma is is of roasted malts and chocolate with hints of coffee. Body is a bit on the thin side with some carbonation. Taste is of malted chocolate.Milky with a roasted finish. Really good!"
"Overall- i'm not a huge stout fan but this one i give a thumbs up in my book. if you can grab this one i say give it a shot. or at least grab a single. it's weird being a huge hop fan with the ipa's then shoot over to the malt side."
"I was told at the Connecticut package store where I found this that it was hard to come by and I have to say it was the first I had seen it. I had high hopes. It pours a thick black brew with a modest light chocolate brown head and great lacing. The aroma is full of dark chocolate with a hint of peanut malt. Very likeable. The flavor seems to perfectly mimic the aroma with a subtle smoke and light pine hops that provides a dry finish. It's quite thin as some stouts might go but it's pretty solid medium bodied with a very smooth feel and beautifully carbonated with very fine bubblage. It's plenty drinkable. Just a bit thinner than I would like for this kind of stout. The flavor is good and it is refreshing and goes down pretty easy. Certainly worth a try."
"A dark brown with a light brown head. A deep rich chocolate nose with caramel sweetness flowing through. Same for the taste with a light lactic sourness. Did I mention the chocolate? Dry somewhat grainy finish. Firm bitterness in the finish. Feel is dry and somewhat crisp. Very drinkable. This goes down like a nice dry Irish stout."
"Drinkability: Overall this beer is pretty good and for my first Harpoon beer, I've got high expectations for the rest of the stable. Had this one in the winter time and it's just what the doctor ordered. Kept the tummy warm and the smiles bright!"
"D: A couple maybe. Strong chocolate presence might become tiring after that, for my taste anyway."
"A solid offering from Harpoon."
"D - extremely drinkable"
"A very easy drinking stout. Nice flavor, but the aroma is outstanding. I'm very happy they released it six packs. I look for this one again next year."
"*- Overall I expected more from the Harppon Chocolate Stout then I got. Too woody-burnt tasting, and not enough chocolate taste for me to take the name ""Chocolate"" Stout seriously. And please Harpoon, cut back on the malty burn out of the beer!"
"This beer poured out dark brown with a finger of brownish head, which took a minute or two to disappear. It smells like burnt chocolate to me. The taste was of old cheap chocolate, like one of the bars you buy from students gone bad. It was watery in my mouth though the taste kept most of my thoughts away from thinking about this. The drinkability was that I chose to finish one and then try a second one , which I proceeded to pour down the drain after one sip. I usually like harpoon, but this one will never be tried again."
"Drinkability: if you are in the mood for a chocolate stout this will suffice. Easy to drink, a few can be enjoyed in a session."
"Overall I have to say that the first half of my glass went down quickly then the flavors began to wear on me. It tastes slightly as though the chocolate was piped in as an adjunct though it's still solidly drinkable. Worth a shot if you like chocolate however it lacks the body of some other intensely chocolate beers (think Choklat) to make it very good."
"If you want a chocolate stout that is properly chocolaty this may be a great seasonal for you. A quarter way through this beer I was really uncertain. But as I pressed on I found it to be a nice dessert beer. This is something that is not for everyone, especially those who do not like chocolate. It needs a bit of work, but I can see this to be a nice beer to sit around the fireplace with."
"I went down easy, but just not for the reason that it was delicious. Easy to drink because you seem to be searching for flavor, so you get bigger gulps in. Once again, another big letdown from these brewers. Mediocre at best."
"Beer served into a Mad Elf snifter. An angry pour gave me a healthy dose of light tan frothy head. This stout is dark as night sitting in the glass. Aromas of cocoa powder, dark caramel, and bread pudding wafting off the top of this - all sweets and nothing in the way of hops. Flavor includes milk chocolate cocoa, charred malt, burnt toast, and a bit of dark soy sauce in the finish. This has a smooth medium feel to it. I think this suffers a bit in drinkability due to its kind of wierd savory acrid finish. A pretty good seasonal stout."
"Not a bad american stout but I'd prefer it without the 'chocolate flavoring'"
"D: High, but I'm partial to stouts."
"It hits full-bodied with a creamy texture. This is a nice choice for a chocolatey dessert brew that is not too overpowering."
"Solid stout. Very drinkable. Tasty chocolately mixture, not too much to drown the taste. Nice malt blend. I liked this much more than I was expecting."
"With a richer body, this would be a very nice stout."
"A nice beer that needs some work but could be great."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"D- Fairly easy drinking, I would have another."
"Overall- Much tastier than I was expecting. A good solid stout."
"M&D - thinner than i expected, not quite as thin as a irish dry stout, but not think, chewy or syrupy, makes for great sessioning, spot on and quality flavors make this a nice 6pack for a xmas party this year, well done Harpoon, makes this a yearly release"
"Drinkability: Not the best chocolate stout I've had. A little watery and just too much chocolate. I like a hint of chocolate not a Hershey bar in my beer."
"Pours a solid dark brown with the faintest of ruby highlights and a 3 finger mocha head that dissipates but never really leaves. Tons of lace impales itself on the glass. I could smell chocolate as soon as I popped the cap on this one. Fresh ground coffee, milk chocolate, chocolate syrup, and some brown sugar and toffee round out the nose. Taste is mostly chocolate syrup, and seems artificial. Brown sugar toffee and butter round out the taste. Leaves a lingering bitter chocolate taste in the finish. Creamy mouthfeel, medium body, light carbonation. I liked this one a bit. I could see myself drinking a few of these, but the artificial chocolate twang is definitely a turn off."
"So much promise, but beyond looks and some good aromatics this beer just is not a keeper."
"This beer does have the right body. If you hold your nose it's like drinking a Young's. Sadly, it tastes like a straight up ale with cheap chocolate syrup added. Not only that, but the bad taste lingers. And lingers. And lingers. Like the creepy dude who was with the dude that your roommate just went to the bathroom to make out with. Seriously not recommended."
"Pitch black hue for the body with a nice full thick mocha tan head, nice even lacing between sips. Aroma dark malts herbal hops with a touch of cocoa powder. Flavor is sickengly straight forward with cocoa powder additions, I feel like I took a spoonful of Hershey's cocoa powder. Creamy milk finish with that cocoa dominance no real hop tones. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sturdy carbonation level no overdone. Drinkability is solid a bit too dessert for my likings but if cocoa powder is your thing this beer gives it up."
"D-not something I would like to drink often, it smelled pretty nice; but it +'s end there."
"D: Overall not a bad beer and worth trying one. However there are definitely better stouts out there."
"Poured a great dark brown/black color with some decent initial head and a bit of nice lacing. Very deep chocolate scent (cocoa powder), and a nice sweet malty aroma. Nice chocolate flavor, although tasted more powder than syrup, but that's fine; Nice deep malt, but the chocolate covered up too much of the stout attributes (burnt grain, coffee, etc) for it to be a truly exceptional stout. Goes down very smoothly, thick and creamy, no hint of alcohol. Nice holiday beer."
"Thin on the feel."
"Picked up as a part of the Harpoon winter sampler. Dark opaque black with small tan head that fades quickly, no lacing really to speak of. Strong dark chocolate and molasses notes in the aroma, smells very pleasant. Taste follows the nose--big dark chocolate notes, molasses, and some roasted malt... lingering aftertaste. Feel is a bit thin and over-carbonated. Drinks well--tastes good, although simple and thin."
"Very enjoyable beer.... Very sweet and yummy... a very nice chocolate stout... Just wish the mouthfeel was a little more creamy with a little less carbonation. All that being said, I would love to find more of it."
"D - I will finish tihs one."
"Good dark appearance with a tan head. Smell is dominated by what seems like hershey's syrup. Same with the taste. I'm not getting much else out of this beer, no hops, malt, or anything but chocolate milk. Definitely not a complex beer. It isn't bad by any means and it was an enjoyable drink but it didn't appeal to my beer tastes. Give this to someone that isn't a beer lover, this might impress them."
"Reminded me of this:http://mix.fresqui.com/files/images/Land_of_Chocolate.JPG"
"*Pairs well with a Kit Kat bar!"
"D: Good flavor, light enough not to be a meal, limited release = drink as many as you can while you can."
"D: I have to admit that I was a little surprised by this beer. In some ways it didn't fit my expectations for a chocolate stout, but in others it was dead on. Overall, it seems the more times I try this beer the better I like it. I would welcome another pint."
"M/D - very smooth chocolaty beverage with nice carbonation that makes it a tasty treat. My only complaint is that its almost too sweet for me to want more than one."
"12 ounce bottle, with ""best by"" dating etched onto the neck of the bottle of 03-15-09. Pours with little head developing above. A load of dark chocolate fudge brownies awakens the nostrils. More chocolate, fudge, chocolate syrup, chocolate bars, and then some more chocolate notes on the palate. I don't think they skimped on the chocolate on this one. None too subtle, not one I would go for again real soon. Likely would go well with a, you guessed it, chocolate dessert of some sort."
"Got a couple of bottles in the winter 12 pack a while ago, and stashed these in the beer cellar. Cracked them open last night. Poured into pint glasses. Dark black color. Large fluffy head, almost looked like root beer suds. Smelled a lot like stale baker's chocolate. Taste? What a disappointment. Did the brewer's even try this before releasing it? Have they ever tried another brewery's version of a chocolate stout? Apparently not. I am not saying they should mimic other brands, but at least they'd see how inferior it ended up and maybe tweek the recipe. Tasted like processed Hershey's syrup. No body at all, thin and watery. Only the second time ever I considered a drain pour. But the first time I told myself that I would never buy this particular Harpoon beer again."
"The beer pours a dark, black color with a very thin tan head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has an over the top chocolate scent that boasts of cocoa and chocolate malts. The taste is average. It has a decent roasted feel with tons of chocolate flavoring added. This one is really horrible. It goes down with lots of prickly carbonation and finishes chalky with a hot cocoa taste. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a medium/full bodied with too much CO2. This is a brew for the scrap heap. I was just starting to like Harpoon's beers again, but this one may have changed my mind."
"The drink is light in body with just enough carbonation and is quite chocolatey without becoming obnoxiously so. At a surprising 6.3% abv, Harpoon's Chocolate Stout is a little potent for sessionability, but quite quaffable nonetheless. A fine offering from the ""Wintry Mix"" sample pack, and one I'd buy again under the right circumstances."
"I was really looking forward to this brew and is the primary reason why I picked up the mix pack, though I really do like all of the other brews in it. The brew poured to a almost pitch black color, had some brown like highlights, smallish head that is tan in color and fades quickly. Limited lacing. The aroma, wow, almost like semi-sweet chocolate syrup and some toasted malts. The flavor is all chocolate for me, some roasted malts but it really is just a dry chocolate flavor. For me it was to much, it actually was difficult for me to get through. I would imagine that for some folks this is great, but not a stout that I like."
"Overall: To be honest I wouldn't go out of my way for this. The chocolate flavor seems like a processed liquid extract and not very pleasant. I feel like I'm taking a sip of some watered down liquor. Not my favorite."
"Pours a cola-colored brown, rapidly fading tan head leaves a handful of spots of lace on the glass. Smells like a chocolate glazed Dunkin Donut, or maybe a bowl full of Count Chocula....way wicked chocolatey smell! Taste doesn't really ""bring it"" as far as the fake chocolatey food flavors go, but there's enough choco-goodness to put a smile on my face. Seems a little thin for the style (yes, I know it's not an ""Imperial", and I'm fine with it). This is interesting enough, and certainly worth a try, but nothing I'd really go out of my way for in the future."
"D I would not buy a case or even a six of this, but an occasional bottle would be ok. It's not that is bad it's just not the style of beer I would drink on a regular basis."
"D: Very drinkable beer. I wish this wasn't only available in the winter 12 pack with only 2 bottles per pack. I really enjoyed this one."
"All in all, an interesting and impressive brew. probably the most chocolaty brew I've tried, short of pouring chocolate syrup into a stout. Almost an overload on the chocolate, but this one pulls it off. Mouthfeel left a bit to be desired, but all in all I'm impressed. If you like chocolate, this is a must try. Not really sessionable, but if I ever have the opportunity to get a few more bottles, there'd be no hesitation."
"Drinkability - the beer is not very heavy at all, but not yet a light beer. Really had trouble finishing the bottle. Have had other chocolate stouts that are way better, Rogue and Brooklyn for example."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle with a date marked 03/15/09B-312. The dark baked chocolate aroma penetrates the nose as soon as I pry the bottle cap off. It pours a very dark, almost black tone with a lingering tan head. The taste is very chocolately with a little hops in the background. It is a bit overwhelming but it really isn't too bad but it is not something I would buy regularly."
"Update 12-2009: I really like the cocoa powder chocolate character of this beer. It is a bit lighter bodied than the typical winter stout, less coffee tasting as well. The milk shake ovaltine description is fitting."
"Overall: I'd have liked it to be more full bodied and perhaps higher alcohol, like an imperial stout. Still, though, this is pretty decent stuff. Just keep in mind it's only 6.3% ABV."
"Had in their winter sample pack. The appearance is jet black with a brown-colored lacing on the sides. Really thin head though. Aromas are really rich in a smoked mocha chocolate flavor. Noticed a hint of toffee, but much more of a dark chocolate. Taste is really great, representative of the aromas. Bittersweet dark chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel helps with a light carbonation to an otherwise creamy drink that is also pretty light comparatively. Overall, a fantastic chocolate stout."
"Overall, a highly confusing experience. This beer is decent, but ultimately sells the whole ""chocolate"" thing too eagerly. It should be the sideshow, not the main event. At the end of the day, Stout is the ringleader."
"3.4/5"
"D'oh! Had such high hopes for this offering from Harpoon. Pours a dark brown as you'd expect in a chocolate, and the aroma is pure chocolate. Like smelling a vat of melted Hershey's. Unbelieveable aroma. Really hoped that the taste would match, but no. Falls very flat. Slight chocolate taste, very light cocoa notes, but if it weren't for the nose I wouldn't be sure this is a chocolate. Maybe Harpoon will refine the taste as it evolves if they keep it as an option, 'cause not there yet. Southern Tier Choklat and Rogue Choc Stout still the best two chocolates by far..."
"My first real experience with a beer that was chocolate flavored. I was quite happy to say that I enjoyed it very much."
"The mouthfeel is quite carbonated and makes it tough to drink, although not a bad beer I won't search it out again."
"Keep the brain trust working on making the 100bbl series reputable again."
"12 oz. bottle from Harpoon's Wintery seasonal 12 pack. Pours a dark brown with ruby edges. Small tan head and no lacing. Smell is all chocolate. Palate is a bit thin for a stout. However, after drinking it, you feel full. Taste is chocolate. Perhaps with a touch of cherry. Chocolate covered cherries anyone? Not a whole lot of complexity here. Although it,s far from perfect, it was enjoyable. To bad you only get 2 out of the 12 pack."
"The pour is great, the smell is striking and the taste is somewhere between a smore and zinc lozenge. Happy Holidays!"
"Pours very dark with mahogany hues shining through when held to the light. Great, frothy, light brown head that retains forever! Smells like Hersheys syrup. So far, so good...then tasting the beer, it goes downhill. There's a certain off-taste right up front that sticks to the palate. Sort of tinny, along with chocolate syrup, and a weird cherry-like flavor. Semi dry finish, light carbonation, pretty thin. It's okay at best. Great looking beer, smells pretty promising, then let down by the actual substance of the brew - the flavor. Close, but no cigar."
"The chocolate in this beer tastes very artificial and does not meld well with the malt. Bottle says there is ""chocolate flavor"" added, whatever the hell that means. I think the metallic taste is from the chocolate flavoring, not very sweet for a chocolate stout. Overall, i wouldn't recommend it."
"12oz bottle from a mixed 12pack from Market Basket. Pours an almost opaque black with few ruby-red highlights and a quarter inch of light tan head. Smells strongly of chocolate malt (not chocolate), reminiscent of espresso beans. Espressso beans dominate the flavor as well with a malty sweetness. Flavor actually reminds me a lot of a less alcoholic Kahlua. Very similar to Kahlua, which doesn't bother me since I really like Kahlua. Medium in body with ample carbonation. Not the most drinkable beer in the world, though it wasn't much work to finish the glass. A unique interesting beer unlike any I've had. Perhaps a more fitting name would be 'Coffee Stout' rather than a chocolate stout, though I understand the name. Glad I tried it, definitely worth a try. I may try cooking with this one too - I think it may add a unique pleasant character to a chocolate pudding or brownies (see Saunders' 'Best of American Beer and Food' to see what I mean). Not a bad beer overall."
"Overall I'm glad there's only two of these in the mix pack. I couldn't drink more than that. The flavors were too quirky - just didn't do it for me."
"I have to say that I was very excited to notice this chocolate stout in the Harpoon Christmas 12-pack & grabbed it right away off the shelf at the ever-better Johnny's Foodmaster next door. Sadly, though, even as I poured this the anticipation waned, as what came out looked more like a porter than a stout proper. The chocolate aroma was quite nice, the head very lacking and the taste was a bit medicinal. I went back to my pal Munich Dark thereafter, a bit disappointed."
"HUGE chocolate flavor all around. It reminds me of the Ommegang Chocolate Indulgence, but the OCI was more dry. This stuff is a purer/smooth chocolate taste. Would love to buy year-round. In fact, I already emailed Harpoon asking if it was available in kegs. I know it's not, but hopefully they get the message."
" I was very dissapointed in this brew, it comes in a rather exciting twelve pack, but alas, it was my least favorite."
"D: It was a bit thin and one dimensional making it a fair but unimpressive brew. It's light enough to drink several but why would you when there are so many other better brews in this style."
"The carbonation makes it feel like a soft drink, the chocolate flavor seems a bit unnatural, and there isn't enough substance beyond that. Won't buy again."
"Not a bad attempt at a chocolate stout. I have heard that this is a very limited brew and I can kind of see why that is. It seems rather thin on mouthfeel and it did get off to a good start with the aroma. Taste is in the middle due to the carbonation. It's worth a try but I wouldn't recommend buying an entire 12 pack just to get it unless you happen to like Harpoon's other brews as well."
