" O: Big flavor especially for the abv."
""
""
""
"Fair.  A slight dryness. Odd taste for a stout that I dint find complimentary for a stout....likely the chicory."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting, yet unbalanced. Tastes like the name suggests."
""
"Great flavor, one of my favorites."
""
""
"Wish they still sold this in bottles. It's likely a great candidate for 750ml bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with an off white head that trails the glass. The smell is full of smoke and coffee. The taste was very smokey with all of the great chicory coffee coming through on the end to make this a very tasty beer. I also liked that it was low alcohol which allowed me to enjoy several."
"Tasted like a dirty ashtray"

"Not a bad beer, but you really need to like chicory.  The coffee notes and smell is nice.  A bit too much chicory favor for this guy."

"O: If you like coffee-infused beers, this one is a stand-out. The chicory reminds me of a Community Coffee New Orleans blend. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"03/28/12 An astringent, dry finish. A bit of a surprise. It appears the bitter of the hops has been replaced with the astringency of the chicory. I know chicory is used in New Orleans as a flavor enhancer for coffee & DH brags of it in their blurb, but it was not particularly coffee-ish."

"The flavor does not disappoint, with ample amounts of coffee as advertised, more roast, and a somewhat spicy, bittersweet chocolate finish. It is surprisingly full flavored for such a low ABV beer! I cannot differentiate between the Chicory and coffee flavors personally. Overall, the only weakness is a somewhat thin mouthfeel, which is a small gripe for such a great beer. I purchase this one without hesitation anytime I see it on the shelf!"

"O: Patience is rewarded. On a cold tap pour there are a lot of bitter coffee notes. As it warms all of the notes are in harmony and it is delicious!"
""
""
""
"This stout pours a near black color with a small off white head that leaves a nice amount of lacing. The nose is packed with bitter roasted coffee and bitter dark cacao. The mouth is smooth and surprisingly light. I actually wish it had a little bit more body. The flavor follows the nose with an abundance of bitter coffee and chocolate as well as burnt dried fruit and a little sweet malt to balance the bitter. This is a very well crafted stout and quite easy to drink. I look forward to enjoying it again down the road."

"Overall: What can be said about this that hasn't been already? It's a tasty, complex stout that was on the shelves long before most of the popular dark beers that saturate the market contemporarily. Worth your money."
""
""
""
"Taste is as aroma but with more noticeable chicory coffee element (but still very light), singed prunes, slightly winy, slightly on sweet side but mostly balanced, firm, but a bit two-dimensional. Light herbaceous peppery bitterness."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours pitch black with a tiny brown head. Smells of chocolate and candy, like toffee or caramel. Tastes of coffee with slight taste of caramel and chocolate. Beer is medium body good carbonation good finish. Overall, a very good beer."

"Head is a little thin. Very very minimal lacing. The color is much too light and the mouth feel is too thin. The carbonation is a little overpowering. I get chocolate in the taste but the coffee is very shy to non existent, though I do like my coffee presence to punch you in the face. Well balanced for the most part and smooth. The smell leaves much to be desired. Overall an okay stout that's easy to drink and a good introductory stout to those who don't drink them."

"This beer is like that stop at Arby's when you're on the way up to the lake: mediocre, functional, unexciting, but serves it purpose. Nothing interesting here. Right down the double-yellow line of average."
""
""
"O: Overall while it seems to be a good stout and all the parts come together to play a decent concert, it is not something that I will rush back to all that soon."

"This is as close to a cup of black coffee as you can get in a stout without being labelled ""imperial", ""double"" or ""Russian imperial"". My go-to morning stout without the high ABV of the aforementioned styles."

"O: Overall this was a fairly unoriginal, that doesn't mean there is anything wrong with it, but this being my first Dogfish head brew, I was hoping it would blow me away but it didn't. Regardless, it's still good so thus I recommend it."

"Overall- It was nice to to get the bitter and mellow flavours from this stout . The smell is sweet but the taste is more bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good stout, but not one that particularly knocks my socks off on any front. I expected more from a stout billed as containing chicory and Mexican coffee, so while it was very drinkable and tasty, there are others I would pick up first."

"O: Well, this is a bit of a departure for Dogfish Head in my experience. I usually really enjoy or really dislike their beers. This one - nothing real special, but nothing particularly offensive. Just forgettable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This stout has an interesting flavor profile from the chicory. Other than that it is nice and smooth but pretty bland overall. A bit bitter. Not a go-to stout by any stretch for me but try it out. I respect dogfish head enough to say that"
""
""
""
""
"Overall/Comments: This was a very complex and unique offering that seemed to get some low scores on BA but I thought was very good overall. A different take on the coffee stout. This is classified as an American Stout at 5.2% ABV. Consumed 2/26/13."
""
"Used to love this stout. Now that I've had better, and seen more of what else is out there, returning to it is disappointing. It's just too thin and lacking the robust flavor that other stouts do so well. It is smooth and drinkable, but compared to what else is available, meh."

"overall: A decent offering from Dogfish Head, nothing I will go out of my way to seek out, but a decently well balanced coffee stout thats quite different from anything else."
"Pours a beautiful dark cola colour with a tan head, more bubbly and poppy than a Guiness-type cover. I don't get a strong scent of anything, except a pretty standard stout coming through. Tastes dark, partly bitter, more beery than I expected. Lingers a while. Sits in the mouth and gets stronger. Only flavor note I can pick up is a little coffee. Not bad, not amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The finish with this is root, earthy soil bitterness. It’s extremely herbal of chicory. Not for those not used to herbal remedies or that kind of Eastern/alternative medicinal flavor. The beer is actually really complex for a low ABV stout."

"Lots of chocolate in the taste as well. I'm really surprised at the level of chocolate in this, I've had RIS's with less. Small hints of bitter roasted coffee but mainly just chocolate. You also get some teases of rasian, but nothing fully develops. The taste doesn't linger long, it actually goes away quickly. Mouthfeel is very crisp and carbonated, also very thin and light bodied. This isn't bad and for the right price could be very attractive."
""
""
"O- I'd recommend it to someone looking for a novelty stout. It's better on tap, so I'll be having one of those again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"If you're looking for a good coffee stout, this is a good choice and is certainly one of the better beers I've experienced with coffee themes."

"O - While a unique experience with that oddly authentic smoky quality, there's just not quite enough here for me to get very excited about. Then again I don't have much appreciation for coffee so some of this beer's finer points may be lost on me. May be very well paired with certain foods. Not bad, just not quite as good as I'd hoped- especially from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not earth shattering or with the taste bud ""wow"" factor of some of DFH's other beers, but a very nice pint that I would recommend to any stout drinker."
""
""

"O-Overall this is a very solid stout. Flavorful and drinkable."

"Dark, and less red than most stouts. Very little head out of a bottle with almost no retention. Smells wonderful; huge aroma of roasted chicory and coffee beans, malt and vanilla and faint smokey-ness. Flavor is hugely coffee, very reminiscent of cappuccino with some hints of cinnamon and chicory. The downside is that the flavor seems to end abruptly leaving behind a smokey, roasted aftertaste. Slightly sweet, mildly earthy, underwhelming malt and hops. The aftertaste really starts to bother me after a while. Medium bodied, light carbonation. Feels to light for a stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- This is a really nice beer. My first thought upon trying it was ""why don't all stouts have chicory?"" it's that good. While the thinness of the mouth leaves some to be desired, I wouldn't change a thing about the flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this one missed the mark for me"
""
""
"A big miss from Dogfish Head. I love the brewery, but will never drink this beer."
""
"Interesting, but a tad strange."
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Stone Brewery pint glass. Pours a deep brown, almost black color with a nice thick 1.5 finger, tan head. Head has almost a soda like consistency to it with good lacing. Right away you can smell the coffee roast and chicory. I'd say this beer smells better than it tastes even. The taste is a bit underwhelming. I was expecting something that could possibly top DFH's India Brown Ale, but sadly, I don't think this does. It lacks the creaminess and richness that I've come to love about the IBA. It's very dry in contrast. Like I said, this just doesn't have the smooth, creamy feel of the IBA either. And at almost 10 bucks for a 4 pack as opposed to a 6 pack, this beer just doesn't seem worth the extra cash. It was good to try this, but I think I'll stick to the IBA instead."

"The beer pours out a deep roasted chestnut brown adorned with an ivory head. As you raise the glass to the light, notice the grade B maple hues at the edges. Rare trails of foam line the glass. This beer speaks colors to me. I smell caramel blended with malted grains with a bit of toffee sprinkled on top. The lightest trace of pecans trailed behind the roasted barley, toast, cocoa, and fresh coffee and joined the sweetness from before. As you sip, the same order of subtleties come out, with the sweetness lingering a few seconds after the finish, until the mild bitterness of burnt toast and coffee emerge and let a dryer feel take over. The carbonation is refreshing, yet smooth upon the medium bodied liquid. Overall, a very nicely drinkable, yet tasteful beer."
""
""
""
"those who do not care for the stuff, like me, obviously should stay away and go to more familiar territory. Its not the beer you, Especially if your not a fan of VERY Astringent flavors."
""
"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, late 2012 bottle release. Pours crystal clear nearly pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, roasted malt, light caramel, toast, light wood, light char, floral, and slight licorice. Fantastic aromas with great balance, strength, and complexity of roasted flavors with the added coffee and spices. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, light caramel, light wood, light char, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, light caramel, light wood, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of roasted flavors, with only a light amount of added spices noted in the taste. Zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice stout! Very nice balance and robustness of roasted flavors; extremely smooth to drink. The aromas kind of made the taste a letdown, but this was still very enjoyable."
"O: I'm not the biggest fan of stout's, but I find this one rather enjoyable. If i'm in the mood for a strong coffee tasting stout in the winter, i'll give this one another go."

"O/D-Pretty solid, the 'chicory' label has made me avoid this beer for years. Its actually pretty decent. I thought chicory was spicy for some reason. A four pack of this is too pricey and does not deliver any 'bang for your buck'."
"O: This is an... interesting beer. Like all Dogfish Head brews, this is quality and certainly above-average. That said, it's not one I plan on drinking regularly. It feels sort of like an experiment (which isn't a bad thing) -- a good quality beer trying something different. It works, sort of, it's just such a different type of flavor in the end that I don't think I would be turning to it a lot. But, it is nice overall, and worth giving a try."
"O - I do like this, above average I would call it. It has a nice taste, and it is quite drinkable. Lacking in terms of mouthfeel and maybe lacking some complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a very dark brown color with a semi-roasted malt scent. There is a heavy roasted sweetness in the flavor mixed with hints of chicory and licorice. Overall this is a well-made beer with a complex blend of ingredients. It ends finishing with a little bit of a chalky after-taste."

"This beer pours up a beautiful and black with a fluffy one finger tan head. Retention is good and there is a surprising amount of lacing. The nose is mostly coffee with maybe a fresh undertone that I can't quite identify. Taste is overall kind of dry with coffee being the biggest component but also some cola and maybe toffee. Mouthfeel is thin for a stout. Nothing here spectacular, but solid nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Its a good stout. The guy at the beer counter said ""Finally someone brave enough to try the chicory stout"" Definately not as big a beer as I thought it would be. I'd drink it again"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good but not too noteworthy stout. Enjoyable and refreshing - really liked the way the flavors changed slightly throughout drinking. Chicory Stout makes for a good session stout - only problem is it only comes in 4-packs, which may or may not lead to you drinking the whole pack in one sitting. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is far from a drain pour or anything, but it definitely feels thinned in some ways. As a near sessionable coffee beer, it works pretty decently, although knowing the wonders DFH can do for body, this could be far more syrupy and wholesome than it is. While the coffee characteristics are pretty spot-on, the rest fizzles out, in the end."
"If everything about DFH Chicory Stout were as good as the aroma, this would be a winner. Look elsewhere for your coffee-forward stout needs."
""
""
"Not sure why I never tried this beer back in my Dogfish Head phase but I sure am glad I only bought a single. Dark black color with a coffee colored head, not a bone-white head as the label indicated. Aroma is dry stout, coffee, hint of dark chocolate, kinda nice. Flavor has a nice coffee note but then it segues into this weird peppery thing which I guess is the chicory? Either way I don;t like it and I sure would have been sad had I bought more than one."
"Overall - Solid flavor, but the body kills it. It's a beer I'd probably give another go, if not for the high price point."
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the more underrated offerings from DFH. It doesn't measure up to a FBS or other imperial coffee stouts, but this is still a solid and highly sessionable stout. I wish Dogfish would put this in 6 packs and make it available year round."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dogfish head does many things right but this isn't one of them. Short on smell, appearance and most importantly taste. By no means is this a bad beer, but in the rehlem of coffee stouts it's unimpressive. Bottom line, it's a fizzy weak coffee stout that just doesn't bring anything unique or different that we usually get from Dogfish Head. Won't be egar to get this again with so many other top notch coffee stouts out there."
""
""
"Overall- A tasty lighter coffee stout. I think the best way to describe the flavor is the term earthy, but don't mistake that for a ""heavy-ness"" or ""richness"". This one is dry and light on the palette and with the lower ABV even somewhat session-able."
""
""
""
"Overall: Obviously not a session beer, it was worth trying. It's not one of my favorites though."
""
""
"Overall not bad, it might be better on nitro."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Color me unimpressed with this effort. Unbalanced with some flavored that didn't seem to mesh well. This one was not for me."
"Very easy to drink and has some nice flavors, but a little too much carbonation and not enough coffee or body keeps this from being great."
""
""
""
"Too bad it’s a seasonal, I could drink this year round."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent stout. Will try again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, solid. At $2.39 a bottle, it's pretty reasonably priced. I can get why this isn't a super high rated stout (probably because of the lack of sweetness and syrupy texture?), but for the style, I give this one a 4 for taste. My taste buds like it, and I'm not generally a stout kind of guy."
""
""
"O: An excellent American Stout. I was apprehensive about the chicory, as this isn't something I recall ever having before. Now that I have, I feel comfortable recommending it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- great to try, won't be up everyone's ally but its a nice change from RIS, coffee stouts, etc, its just a little unique. Off centered I suppose (too far?). I wish it was a little thicker but I like it."
""
""
""
""
"Nice coffee flavors, after all. That, and the accent of chicory, plus some spicy and almost peat smoky undertones makes for a decent session beer from Dogfish Head. Approved."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall a session stout with decent attributes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep black with an inch of tan head. Coffee is pronounced on the nose and palate thanks to the chicory. It's slightly different from the average coffee notes in a typical stout - a little spicier. It's an easy drinker for those who like the dark beers. Not incredible, but solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A unique take on a style that can be pretty homogeneous. I expect no less from Dogfish Head. It is a light, dry Irish stout in style, but it offers HUGE flavor for such a low ABV brew. Highly recommended for all coffee lovers who want a refreshing, session-able beer."
""
""
"O- Nice stout to drink on any evening. Not overpoweringly strong on flavor or alcohol."
""
""
""
""
"O - Nothing to go rushing to the store over, and not worth $10/4-pack, although this is a fairly solid beer that I would not neglect had it been casually lounging in my fridge."
""
"Overall, not bad, not great."
""
""
""
""
"well i thought i wrote a review of this but i cant find it and it would be wrong what a wonderful beer great color great pour but what a great after taste in my mouth what ever mood i was in before shame on me a very nice r ich dark smoothed beer with mexican coffe so sit back and drink and enjoy"
""
"Pours an extremely dark brown, almost black. Cream colored two and half finger fluffy head. Above average retention, little to no lacing. The nose is a combination of dark roasted grain, coffee, light chicory, and the slightest hint of anise. Opens with with breadiness, roasted grain, joined by slightly bitter coffee, chicory, and finishes with astringent black licorice. Slick average mouthfeel. Interesting beer, but seems a bit disjointed. Not a bad beer, but not one that I would seek out on a regular basis."
""
"Eh, this one is okay. It was good at first, but I kind of started to grow tired of it. It wasn't offering anything more as it went on, and it kind of got one-dimensional and boring. Nice hop profile, but actually kind of weak on the malt robustness I was expecting."

"I liked this but it's not balanced enough to place in the regular rotation. Hefty, bitter and supremely drinkable. I didn't mind the dominance of coffee (I like java-based stouts), but there's little accompaniment -- mostly single note repetition instead of an orchestration of flavors."
"O - Finally got to try this thanks to a buddy who shared a bottle. I'd prefer this guy with a bit heavier feel, but easily a rich tasting beer."

"Certainly one of the best beers brewed by Dogfish Head. Unique and definitely worth sampling."
""
""
"Pours dark brown/black with creamy mocha head. Heavy cocoa smell with espresso and roasted grain. A bit of hazelnut. Flavor follows with up front chocolate and coffee. Finishes with an interesting chile-like pepper burn and a lingering nutty aftertaste. Complex flavors all around. Medium mouthfeel. Seems like more of a thick brown ale than a stout, but I like it."

"Overall- It's a nice average stout. Nothing over the top and it succeeds in delivering what it's name entails. One of Dogfish Head's more subtle brews, and is great as being a session stout. However its middle of the road and I would look at other stouts before choosing this one again."
"O - Unique stout, which I must say I absolutely love. Highly recommended."
"O: I get that this is a very taste-specific beer - and I want to respect that - but I really liked it, so my ratings may be higher than the average - it all has to do with chicory, which is like radicchio and endive - bitter, woody, herbal, and earthy - and coffee-like, but not coffee-tasting - similar, but different. Try a coffee brewed with chicory, and if you like that, and beer, you will love this. Otherwise, it's probably hit or miss."

"Excellent brew for what this is - a sessionable stout. Appearance is black - held up to light, nothing shows through. Healthy and creamy head that lingers - nice cream color. Some lacing on the glass. Aroma is coffee and a faint smokiness. Flavor is heavy on malts - some chocolate is present, and the coffee re-appears. Mouthfeel is nice with finer carbonation. Excellent brew when stacked against other ""mild"" stouts."

"I'm not sure what the brewer was trying to accomplish with this beer. I always thought chicory was a substitute for coffee. Why mess with it when the real thing works just fine? At any rate, I didn't enjoy this beer at all, but it won't stop me from trying other DFH beers. I still have a lot of respect for this brewer. This beer simply isn't for me."

"O: This is a solid beer overall. Nothing grand about it, but it does it's job as a nice stout. Could drink a couple of these in one sitting. Coincidentally, that's what I'm doing right now!"
"First off, NO truth in advertising here! My pour created just over two fingers of dense, mocha-brown head with decent retention. Color was a deep, dark brown with ZERO light penetration and cola highlights only at the edges. Nose smelled of coffee, not strong like I usually brew, but coffee all the same. Mouthfeel was medium and the bitterness normally associated with coffee was, indeed, smoothed out by the chicory. It was like non-bitter coffee and I was conflicted since I like bitter, black coffee, but this took on a vanilla aspect in the mouth. Finish was smooth, coffee-like, tasty. One would be plenty for me, however."

"Not a bad beer. It’s pretty easy to drink. The chicory makes for an unusual taste and feel, but it’s never obnoxious. Just above middle of the road for this drink."
"O: This is a nice, well balanced American Stout. It has a great roasted malt flavor with a very nice dark chocolate and coffee aftertaste. It's a bit on the thin side, but I'm impressed."

"Terrific stout! A dark brown pour with a medium sized tan head. Heavy lacing on the glass. Smell is coffee, chocolate and a bit of smokiness. Flavor of chocolate malt, some coffee. Very creamy taste, somewhat of a mexican coffee flavor. I'm really into this brew; give me more!"
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is an ok beer. I think the woody notes are coming from the chicory but I think the basic stout aspects were overlooked in favor or this addition. Solidly average."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a black body with no head on it. The smell is of roasted malts with a hint of coffee and some chocolate notes. The taste has is of roasted malt and dark chocolate up front with some sweetness on the back of the tongue. As it warms up i get a little coffee hint. The mouth feel is really good, not to heavy but i think just right for a stout. Overall this is a good beer."

"Flavorful brew that has an interesting mix of the herbal and sweet, flavor profile is exactly as advertised. Colored like a stout but drinks lighter like a brown ale. One of DFHs better seasonal beers."

"O - A tasty drinkable stout, but nothing really jumps out at me as unique as other DFH beers do."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A beautiful black pour with 1"" tan head, great amounts of lacing. Smells of coffee, dark chocolate, tobacco, roasted grains. Tastes milky sweet, hints of chocolate, black coffee. Medium bodied with a nice rich creamy texture, lightly carbonated. A perfect example of a stout by a company who's always trying out of the ordinary recipes, this is very traditional tasting."

"this really is like the perfect stout. incredible flavor. great balance. great complexity. and best of all its sessionable. its not an imperial which is always a surprise coming from dogfish head, but a happy surprise. great great beer."

""
""
"Review from 2/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a very dark brown amber with a light tan head and a few speckles of lacing. Nice roasted malt and slight smoke aroma. Roasted malt, coffee and sweet malts to start melding into a sweeter malt with roasty elements, somewhat dry finish, but well integrated and nice flavor progression. This is a nicely made low ABV stout. Will try again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not bad but also for a stout I think it is lacking a bit. Decent beer but due to the low alcohol and body not sure why they sell this one in a four pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a delicious and drinkable stout, only loses points for the lack of head."
""
""
""
""
"I really wanted to like this beer, but I was highly disappointed unfortunately. The beer started off with a dark, dark black molasses like pour. The aroma was of burnt wood, maybe hickory or something? The beer poured with alot of head and lace, and the taste is kind of bitter. Leaves an unsavory aftertaste, and is low in alcohol percentage for a stout. I expected more from Dogfish head, but out of a dozen or so bres, this was the first and hopefully last that disappoints."
"O - An above average beer for sure, but not in my top 3 favorites from this brewer. It seems benign from a brewer who puts out so many other complex concoctions. I'm not opposed to having it again, just wouldn't go out of my way to find it. A good solid, but average stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Not to enamored with this one, it was just okay."
""
"O: Excellent for such a low abv Stout. Rich, creamy and full of sweet chocolate and coffee flavors. Dogfish Head should Imperialize this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Smell seems to promise more in terms of taste, but still nice and light for a stout at 5.2% abv and nice coffee notes"
"O - A good stout that really emphasizes the coffee. I think it lacks some flavor, although, admittedly I usually drink more full flavored imperial stouts. I picked this one up in a mix-a-six and I think Wegmans was having a hard time getting rid of it. It is a pretty good, easy drinking, stout that I probably wouldn't get a four pack of, but makes for a decent single."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good stout. It doesn't blow me away, but it is a solid offering. DFH continues to keep it real."
"The only problem is the price for a 5% 4 pack. This beer proabbly would've scored higher if it werent for that."
"O-not great, would not buy it again. Not what I was expecting from a dogfish beer"

"Sam, i know a thing or two about coffee. Ask me first next time."

"On tap at moejoes in Plainfield. Dark brown with a creamy finger length head. Aroma is coffee, chicory, and barley. Taste is the same. Very well balanced with a mild hop kick. Creamy mouthfeel. Great beer. I've had this in bottles in many occasions over the years and it's even better on draft."
"Overall this is a unique beer. The chicory adds a different flavor compared to other stouts and makes for a nice brew."
""
"O: Probably not one of DFH most notable brews, but a darn good one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Chicory Stout may seem simple and straight forward, but it’s a pretty tasty beer. For a smaller American Stout, it delivers quite a bit of flavor. That’s mostly due to the strong coffee presence, but I’m a big fan of that. Yeah, it could maybe use a stronger nose and a little more body, but it’s good stuff as it is. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
"The coffee and chicory are a nice touch that distinguish it from other stouts. Enjoyable."
""
"O: decent beer, and thanks to a friend for giving me one. I wouldn't drop $10 on a 4-pack, though. There are too many good stouts at that price point for this unless you're a fan of cherry."
"Really pleasantly surprised by this one. Pours a dark brown/black with a fingers width of off white head, which dissipates at a moderate rate and leaves some lacing. Smell is big coffee and roasted flavors, with big chicory, along with a smokey aroma. Flavor follows the nose, and is surprisingly strong on the palate, the coffee and chicory are wonderful, with roasted malts on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but not terrible for a regular stout. Overall, a really nice beer, with a real big flavor profile for a single stout. Well done."
""
""
""
"It started out with such a nice aroma that I was expecting so much more in the taste. Certainly not worth buying again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – The stout had some fairly nice flavor, smell, and appearance, but its quite light body took what could have been a really nice moderate abv leveled stout to something of a bit lesser quality. Not bad, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a big fan of chicory in general but that being said everything else about this beer id good. Medium thickness with a creamy head that is fairly impressive for this style of beer. Mild all around except for the chicory of coarse, I think this beer is more for the select group of stout fans, that also love chicory."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark root beer color with a fine -- but quickly fading -- tan head. Subdued aroma with mild sweet chocolate notes and a slight metallic accent. Taste is on the sweet side, mainly dark chocolate with slight coffee and slight roasted malt. I don’t know what chicory wood tastes like but I only get a minor woodiness. As per usual with DFH, the body is hefty and sweet while the finish is astringent. Pretty decent beer though."
""
""
""
""
"Conclusion: This is an interesting beer that runs outside of the usual grain, which I salute and admire. The coffee and chicory are noticeable but not overpowering. My only complaint is that the label doesn't state that this beer contains St. John's Wort, which can interact seriously (and even fatally in rare circumstances) with certain pharmaceuticals; namely SSRIs, MAOIs, and other antidepressants that change serotonin levels."
"Overall a straight forward tasting Stout that has everything a great Stout should and more. Definitely a benefit to the style…"
"Overall - This one isn't bad. If it wasn't for the imbalanced taste to it, I'd probably give it higher marks overall. But its a safe drink, and something you should eat food with to compliment it."
""
""
""
""
"O - I have a love/hate relationship with Dogfish. Most beers I love, others I find completely undrinkable. This unique stout falls somewhere in the middle. A 12-oz bottle is just enough, and in a four pack, that's about as much as I'd care to have on hand. Overall, pretty satisfying beer for the winter and unique brew that I'd gladly try again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours near black. Tan head adorns, bits of spongy lace. Aroma is coffee and roast. Fairly one dimensional. The taste is pretty much the same. Slight bitter coffee, roast and not much sweetness...a little bit of chocolate, but not much. The feel was creamy, with a solid upper medium body. In the end, it's a middle of the road stout. The chicory isn't as tasty as straight up coffee. Glad to try it though."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: It feels a bit thin but that just makes for an easy drinking beer that goes down rather smooth for stout with coffee in it."
"Review from notes. This is from my 1st bottle tasting after 1st enjoying on tap @ FatHeads. Pours a rich, dark cola color with a little head of tan bubbles into dimpled mug. Smells of the mexican coffee listed as well as dark cocoa and malt. A good full bodied flavor in the mouthfeel up front with the coffee and cocoa mixing with the chicory for a wonderful roasty finish that's spicy but fades fairly cleanly. IMO very well done offering from the normally IPA heavy DFH. I will seek this out again. Good stuff, good stout."

"Overall-- a sold stout from a solid brewery. It has enough going on that I'll enjoy it from time to time, but I won't eagerly await it's release."
"Though I enjoy the lighter body and mild bitterness compared to other stouts, the prominent sharpness combined with a tendency towards wateryness ultimately leave me feeling that this beer is weak. An ok stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: It’s an interesting brew. This review was done based on my second Chicory Stout of the day, so it’s clearly drinkable/repeatable. And I wouldn’t mind having another, but I don’t “love” it. The herbal/earthy qualities of this, combined with the coffee, make it interesting, but I don’t think I’d want to buy this by the keg."
""
""
""
""
""
"Black in color. Poured with thick beige foam that slowly reduced leaving wet lacings on the glass. Dark roasted and dark chocolate malt aromas with hints of burnt malt and coffee. Earthy chicory and coffee flavors intensify as this warms. Medium bodied with smooth, lazy, tight carbonation. Dark roasted malt and coffee flavors up front along with dark chocolate. Bitter hops roll thru the middle along with a bit of astringency. Bitter hop, coffee and burnt malt flavors at the finish that linger for a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Lacks the umph of some of the better stouts. The taste, smell, and mouthfeel all leave you wanting just a little something more. This does not necessarily mean it has to be bigger, just a little more of something."
"Aromas of roasted coffee and dark sugars amid a swath of earthiness. Smells like it'll be pretty sugary and sweet. Huh, it actually isn't too sweet. Pretty dry and bitter, in fact. There's coffee bitterness and an earthy/medicinal bitterness that I reckon is attributable to the chicory. Roasted and tangy overtones. It does get a bit sweeter as it warms, though. The body is perhaps on the light side, but it has a nimble feel. Carbonation is high, but after a while it calms down and this becomes much more of a pleasant sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
"O --- Very good beer. While others seem to strive more sweetness and an after dinner style this one works well with dinner. I will definitely try it with a good BBQ soon."
""
""
"O: A pretty solid stout and a really easy drinker. At 5.2% this one isn't breaking the ABV bank and is one to keep in the fridge as an everyday brew."
""
""
""
"Poured into a a 15oz stout glass from a 12oz bottle. Very nice super dark brown, almost black it color. Hardly any head at all, maybe about a 1/8"" if lucky. Lacing was not there either. Had with shelled nuts and went OK together. Not sure what the temp was when it came out of the fridge, but took me about 35 minutes to polish it off and tasted better near the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is dark roast. Coffee and walnut. It is really good. Balance is good. Very smooth beer which is highly drinkable. Granted, alcohol level is pretty low for the style."
""
""
"DOA"
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad for a lighter 'session' stout, but considering it's a 4-pack priced the same as Old Rasputin (maybe a bit more expensive, actually), it's hard for me to revisit this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a solid dark brown that lets a smidgen of light through with a creamy off white head that persists admirably. Smells of roast chocolate and caramel mostly. Slight earthy spicy edge is light but there. The taste leans a bit more to that spicy earthy edge than the aroma did. There's definitely a roasty, coffee, caramel malt flavor here but its countered by some flavors that I'm having trouble describing. Herbal earthy almost minty flavors that no doubt come from the cornucopia of odd ingredients in the brew. Medium body and level of carbonation with a full creamy smooth mouthfeel. I kind of enjoyed this, but its not something I think I would drink very often, I find it a little weird tasting."
""
""
"Overall (4): I like this beer a lot, especially at its low ABV (particularly for DFH)."
"O - A very good beer. I'm not exactly sure what chicory tastes like since I've never sampled it but nothing stood out of place. I also didn't get any of the Mexican coffee flavor unless it contributed to what I perceived as a normal roast flavor from the roasted barley in all stouts. Definitely a beer worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice roasty stout. Definitely something I'll drink again."
"O: this is a great session beer from dogfish. The aroma is slightly better than the taste but overall its wonderful. Really nicely designed beer."
"This is a very good example of a coffee stout. I recommend picking up a four pack of this very well made beer."
"Deep and lovely color"
""
""
"O - not impressed was hoping for more coffee flavor. its very light"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O- Solid stout. Lower on the abv, but still full flavored. Good stout if you plan on drinking a few."
""
""
"Verdict: Solid stout from Dogfish, the coffee flavors are definitely enjoyable, but it is a bit of a one trick poney, and not very noteworthy at that. A good stout for someone who is looking to get into darker beer for the first time."
""
""
""
"O: Different from any other stout I've had, which is probably exactly what DFH was going for. A solid beer overall, and I'd be curious to pair this with some food."
""
"O: very good beer, different flavor with the chicory but I am a big fan of ingenuity and creativity. So major props to Dogfish head for always making tasty and original beers."
""
"This is a somewhat plain, uninteresting stout. Drinkable, but unexciting."
""
"an easy drinker, if you don't mind the bite of the chicory -"
""
""
""
"Overall- after all the hype I had heard over this beer I was very disappointed in it. It's a very light stout and doesn't take a lot of flavor from the chickory. Overall it's easy to drink but I was expecting a lot more from this beer"
"O - I'm not a huge stout person, but I enjoy this beer and will have again in the future."
""
""
"Overall, a unique approach and pretty good stuff. Definitely drinkable, not best in class or best of brewery by any stretch. But I'd drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"O- Nothing special. Appearance killed it for me, and too watery."
""
""
""
""
""
"The aromas on this brew are the primary things going for it. The flavor is a far cry from the smells and the mouthfeel is thin and watery. I would drink again, but not likely to go out of my way for it."
""
"M - Medium bodied with good carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty average coffee stout. Not bad at all, but nothing to get all that excited about either. Fairly simple and easy to drink. Probably should've let it warm up a bit, as I think I might've served it too cold. will re-review again in the future. cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O: This one missed the mark for me as a stout. As a beer it seemed pretty average. It really had the characteristics of a burned porter to me. I would give it another go if put in a pinch but wont seek it out."
"M-thin to medium body with a nice carbonation."
"Overall: A great beer that would be even better had its great flavors not been so muted by a certain watery character throughout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad stout, in smell and flavor. A bit lacking in appearance and mouthfeel. Glad I tried it, but probably not one I would seek out. Still, worth a try."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is coffee and roasted malts. Taste is mild coffee up front, roasted malts, some mild notes of chocolate. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: The head was disappointing, but this beer smells and tastes great. Overall, I liked this more than the Sierra Nevada Stout."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but not out of this world good either. I don't know if I'd go too far out of my way to get this one again, but I'm not a huge fan of the style."
""
"Looks really nice. Quick dissipating head. Deep mahogany when held to the light. Smells toasty and burnt. It smells very nice. (I have only had probably 12 different stouts) It tastes much different than it smells. It is a bit thinner than I expected. Tastes of roasted barley and dark black coffee. It is more bitter than I expected also, and I think that has to do with the chicory. I enjoyed this brew, and I'm glad I have 3 more. It is worth trying as all the DFH seasonals are."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very pleasant and satisfying coffee stout."
"O: An adequate American stout, but by no means a stand-out. I'm still puzzling over how something could smell so nice, yet fail to wow on the palate. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"O - Solid brew, I'd get it again. Paired well with beef stew."
"O - Not a bad beer overall, but not one I'd jump at picking up again. Wished it delivered more on the flavors that the bottle advertises."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - a light non-overpowering stout. Seems like a good beer to drink while sitting around a campfire on a cool night. Will try again in a similar situation."
""
""
""
""
"This is a tasty stout. Easy to drink, I don't about the alcohol content but its slightly noticeable - it doesn't hurt the beet though."
""
""
"D: Quite good. A stout that I would enjoy again."
"Not exactly sure about this stout. Coming from Dogfish Head I had really high expectations, maybe too high. It was like darkness in a glass. It had a roasted coffee and bitter chocolate taste. I think the coffee and chocolate overpowered any chicory taste. I may have been there but I couldn't find it."
""
""
"I really cannot say enough about the cocoa. Good and drinkable as I've had it on tap and out of the bottle but not great."
""
"1.5 finger tan head with some lacing. Very dark black with a litlle light getting through. Aroma is excellent with a liight chicory aroma on a chocolate/cocoa background. Just the right degree of spicey chicory flavor on a mellow standard stout background. The body is much lighter than expected. Light to moderate carbonation. This beer is very drinkable with just the right amount of spicy pepper flavoring for my tastes. Excellent"
"Light texture in the mouthfeel as expected from a low abv brew but not detracting in any way. Overall this is an solid beer that is tasty and very drinkable."

"O: Overall the beer is pretty good. The chicory and chocolate make the beer fairly bitter but it's an interesting concept for a stout."
"Taste is sweeter than the nose, some licorice notes, but overall it's the coffee and chocolate. Nicely done!"
""
""
""
"pretty basic stout, the fact that mexican coffee and chicory was used to brew this does not stand out. im glad this was purchased as a single."
""
""
"Pours dark brown, almost but not quite black. Very strong aroma of cocoa, little else. Toasted flavor hits very strong at first, mellows, and finishes with the chocolate I was smelling. I describe the mouthfeel as full and round. Overall, a very solid stout, very drinkable. Simple, straightforward and very good."
"O - Okay I guess. It's not terrible. Definitely not worth the $12/six pack. At that price, I won't be purchasing this one again."
""
"O: a good stout, has some nice flavors, nothing amazing though"
""

"O: Dogfish Head's worst beer that I have tried. I am a huge fan of DFH from their beer to their story, but this beer was almost undrinkable. This beer lacks the structural texture of a stout, completely lacks any sort of pleasant complexity, and tastes like burnt leaves. Such a disappointment for a beer that has been a long standing seasonal from on of my favorite breweries, and one i've been looking forward to for a long time. Sorry Sam Calagione, but you gotta do better than this."
"A touch of sourness, like old coffee with some charred brown sugar. A touch of butter. Interesting but not so drinkable. I haven't tried this for years. Maybe it's the time of year, I want a little more body and richness to go with all the bitter burnt flavors."
"There are some interesting things going on with the wood and coffee but it just seems to be lacking. DFH has also changed the format from 6 packs to 4 packs. I'm thinking I will pass on this next winter."
""
""
""
""
"DFH Chicory stout is just an average forgettable stout which didn't really achieve much. Especially disappointed because of the highly priced 4 packs."
""
""
""
"O - Probably my favorite stout to date. It is extremely smooth and drinkable. What makes is So great though is that it gives you the great chocolaty and coffee flavor that many stouts have, but it is hopped and spiced well enough that in the finish is wipes your pallet clean and keeps you drinking. Certainly a future repurchase."
"All and all decent. In the world of big stouts and big ipa's this doesn't really stand a chance but for a decent low alcohol stout this is a goody."
"No doubt that the alcohol is an afterthought here as I could have downed an entire four-pack in a sitting. Whether I would want to is another story. Yes, this is a Stout but with so many others our there, why bother with this one? I'd rather go for a Black IPA and get the best of more than one world! This is only a go for die-hard Dogfish Head fans."

"opaque black with color, with thin cream colored head. aroma is slightly smokey, peppery. taste is quite roasty, with some flavors similar to root beer soda. almost savory. medium body and carbonation."
""
""
"Pint glass, smooth pour of pitch black with creamy off white almost caramel head that retains moderately. Intense coffee bean with burnt malt and faint chocolate scent. Pretty explosive on the tongue with bright toasted notes and chicory. Coffee in the palate and lingering for a few seconds on the tongue, as well as a residence of sweetness that will probably remain until I divert to water. This isn't bad but the upfront flavor isn't the best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An okay beer and coffee stout but nothing to write home about. I'll probably only buy a four pack since I can't seem to find any other stouts that are available."
""
"O: Was expecting something a little more bold in the coffee and roast profile. Very earthy and textured though, which was still moderately enjoyable. I thought this could be a bit smoother and honed in a little better. Kind of seemed ""unfinished"" to me."
""
""
"o: a decent coffee beer, no more no less. could use more carbonation and i feel it lacks complexity. it's like drinkin a cold cup of coffee."
"Notes - Strangely I never wrote a review for this beer fresh so I suspect I wasn't a huge fan of it. That and seeing as I had enough left over to age. Overall pretty close to a really good stout."
""
""
"Overall: I found this to be a fairly enjoyable stout. Maybe the recipe was altered or I just had a pour from a good keg, but I really did not get any of the off sour flavors that so many other people mentioned."
"O: This beer doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. The tastes are there but the vehicle to deliver them isn't, quite."
""
""
"D - Great combo of stout flavors and chicory; I really liked the use of Mexican coffee beans, it gives the beer a slightly muted and soft nose and taste; good stuff and worth trying if you're a stout lover"
"Overall, as always dogfish head has come through with this Chicory Stout. The coffee flavor Is enhanced with the subtle smokey, roasted flavor."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a slick almost pitch black, with a 2 inch tan head that settles into a film of bubbles, nice amount of lace. Smell is coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, and some biscuit. Taste is all about the coffee and chocolate, fairly bold for its lower abv. Body is what you expect out of a regular stout, nice carbonation, not dry, and easy to drink. This is a nice stout and very sessionable."
""
""
""
"D/O: This stout is drinkable in an apologetic fashion, with dark flavors kept tightly under control and palatable. Acidity is fairly harsh, which makes it not particularly desirable in its style-defined role. When taken with savory food its flavor profile will prove complementary, while acidity and carbonation will serve to cleanse the palate. Considering its very ordinary abv, this beer deserves an upward tick on account of drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a perfect sessionable stout for the winter. At only 5.2%, you could easily put down the 4-pack (is there any reason they took away the sixers?) on a cold night"
"Overall: This was a very good all around stout. Has a great body and balance. Definitely looking forward to drinking another. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is pretty tasty. It's a nice coffee forward drinkable stout. I might like more of this."
"O - A worthy coffee stout, but ultimately falls a little short for me. Where I wanted a lingering coffee/chocolate taste, I got bitter dextrin. Where I wanted a big chewy ""bite", I got thinness. There are better stouts out there for the price, so I'm not 100% sure I'd rush out to buy this again."
""
""
""
"Overall – The chicory provides this beer with an interesting taste. It's not a beer that I'd want a whole lot of, but the the taste is different enough that it warrants trying at least once."
""
""
""
"Overall a solid beer, but nothing that really impressed me, it fell a bit short of my expectations, just didnt quite have enough flavor for me. If your looking for a lighter bodied, easy drinking stout this is great. I wouldnt say Dogfish missed on this, but definitely not one of there best pieces of work."
""
""
""
""
"Pours into a glass like dark coffee. Smell of coffee, whiskey like smoky hints, and some roasted malt(I guess chicory?). The tastes packs a bit more kick then I was expecting. Very acidic tasting, slightly dry finish, despite having a vaguely creamy feel while in the mouth. The taste is a bit like coffee, mixed with some raisin, and roasted and toasted grain. I like the taste, and most things about the beer, but I do feel it's a bit on the thin side... the carbonation also kind of makes it feel more biting then I was anticipating for a stout. All in all, I like this beer, but I don't think it's one I will be getting as a staple. Also, as far as seasonal winter beers go, there are a bunch of others I feel like are more satisfying in this capacity. This is worth trying if you haven't tried it yet though."
""
"Actually a pretty good overall stout. Not sure what chickory should taste like but the coffee is apparent in the smell and tase and welcoming Pours a deep thick brown onto my chalice. Head is somewhat khaki with no lacing. The maltiness and joe are apparent in both smell and taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and overall a sessionable stout but not necessarily my go to stout."
"A flavorful stout that could hold it's own against the many a bigger stout."
""
"It pours a dark, dark brown with a lot of foam. I pick up the aroma of chocolaty cocoa nibs and some roast. Maybe a touch of coffee—which I didn’t realize was from actual coffee. This is a full-flavored brew—it has a lactic bite, with an edge and a sharp finish. If I knew what chicory was I could probably identify those notes too."
"Overall, I wasn't unhappy to pay for a $6.99 growler of it, it's a slightly different take on a typical stout and not a bad winter drinker."
"O-average at best but still enjoyable, prob would order at a restaurant or try again but would never purchase a four pack"
""
""
"O- Excellent stout, I'm assuming it didn't wow me because I didn't know what to expect from chicory. What's nice is it is something that didn't stand out and become offensive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours jet black with a thick mocha that sticks around and sports some nice lacing. Aroma of milk chocolate and coffee, smells wonderful. Taste follows the nose but without the pop. Muted coffee and chocolate, I mean it's tasty just not wow. Mouthfeel Is a bit thin. Good, regular drinking stout."

"O - A very nice standard American stout. Has the robustness I like in a stout. Plus a little smokiness. Will drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a really nice smooth roasty/smokey brew, pretty refreshing given the color/style"
""
""
"Overall: More was anticipated from this beer and it's fairly light for a stout. It's a bit light for my liking. I'll be interested in holding on to a bottle or two to see how it changes over time."
""
"O - I was expecting a lot more from DFH on this one, but it wasn't terrible and I don't like coffee at all. If coffee's your thing, you could easily down a six of this. As for myself, I bought two and I love DFH, but I may give the second one away."
""
"a nice twist on a really excellent stout. this beer pours very dark like a heavy coffee with a thin light head. smells like root vegetables and coffee, with an overwhelming roasted aroma. taste like an english style stout, but with espresso notes in the finish. mouthfeel is great, smooth and thin in the mouth, but definitely at least medium bodied. low carbonation as well. it is a very expensive four pack, but a great beer to share with family and friends at holiday time. definitely more of a winter stout for me"
""

""

"Overall I thought this was a pretty damn good American Stout. It had a pretty good flavor, there was some nice complexity and even though I couldn't find the difference between chicory and coffee it was still a nice flavor that worked well with this beer and it helped balance out the heavily roasted malts. I find this beer to have pretty good drinkability. if I had another one I would drink it, I could probably drink two or three of these in a sitting without a problem, which is pretty good for an American Stout. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, there wasn't anything that I felt was out of place or that could be improved on. What I liked least about this beer was that it comes in four packs, this has six pack beer written all over it, but at least Dogfish Head didn't put it in a 750ml bottle, that would suck. I will for sure be picking up a four pack of this before they are all gone, it makes for a good tasting and easy drinking American Stout. I recommend this if your a fan of American Stouts or coffee flavored beers, this will hit the spot. Dogfish Head did a great job with this beer, I just assumed this would be a big beer so I was surprised to this was only 5.2%, but it still had big beer flavors. The more beers I try from Dogfish Head the more they impress me, their crew really knows what they are doing when it comes to making good tasting and unique beers."
"O- Pretty good stout but I would have to says that it does not rank as high as others I have tried. Don't get me wrong, it's a great drinking beer. But I feel it could be better."
""
""
""
"I understand there has been some concern about the new 4-pack modality of distribution. My bottle shop informed me that the overall case price is the exact same as last year, and thus the 4-pack was prorated. If stores are charging the same amount, it's not an edict from the brewery--it's the shop or the distributor."
""
""
""
"M - Some decent carbonation for a stout. Smoky, roasty, medium-bodied. Very easy and enjoyable to drink. It has a fantastic lingering taste and feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As with many dogfish beer's this was worth a try. There are other more widely available examples of the style which I'd prefer."
""
""
""
"Dr: Very drinkable and pleasant, but the mouthfeel is off. It's of pretty good quality, but dogfish head might a lesson on how stouts are done. The price could be better as well."
""
""
""
"Taste and mouthfeel are a little disappointing considering the powerful and intriguing nose. The coffee bean tastes dominates here (as a coffee lover, I don't mind at all), but it's a bit too astringent for my liking. There is a nice wood-smoked flavor (I'm guessing that's what they were trying to do with the chicory), but it comes out with too much of a charcoal effect. The pros: it is quite a drinkable stout (a ""session"" stout?) that has average carbonation and a quick finish. A solid, but not outstanding beer."
""
""
""
""
"Into a DFH pint glass pours a deep dark black with a tan head that hangs out to at least a minimum. A sweet dark chocolate, vanilla cream, roasted nut malt nose. A robust yet crisp roasted malt body accented by a consistent nutty coffee, lightly sour and creamy taste on the palate. Mild echoing smokey note in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Kind of thin for a stout. Very drinkable though."
""
""
"Medium-thin bodied for a stout, with good carbonation and a fairly short, snappy finish. Very drinkable, nice to have something on the lower ABV side for a change. Had this one in the late afternoon with a light snack and could still drive my car afterwards. Others I drank with this found it to be sort of middle of the road and forgettable but I quite enjoyed it. Not to beat a dead horse but it’s lovely to have an easy drinking stout that’s not an over-the-top booze monster once in a while."
"(GAVE IT 2nd Chance and glad I did, delicious)"
"Nearly jet black, one finger of tan head, light lace. Smell is full of coffee, roasted malt, bittersweet notes, fairly big hop profile behind all the coffee and roast leaving some pine and citrus. Taste is roasted with lots of coffee, molasses, chocolatey points, light sourness comes and goes, mild hop bite. High carbonation, creamy with some thin points. Quite a nice stout, nothing outstanding but something worth revisiting again."
""
""
""
""
"I recommend giving it a shot, but it will be a while before I revisit this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"yummy beer, some real interesting tastes to it. the carbonation is a bit odd to me but overall it's not bad at all."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good stout. Right up there with Obsidian and Bells Double Cream. Give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is definitely a nice change-up from the heavier more intensely flavored stouts I've been drinking, but the chicory and coffee is really prominent. Definitely something someone who dislikes coffee won't like."
"Overall, a cool idea, but there isn't much flavor."
""
""
""
"O: Not my favourite Dogfish Head, nor anywhere near my favourite stout, but still an above average beer. I'd have another, if not anytime soon. Interesting and idiosyncratic. Tentatively recommended?"
""
"This is a nice twist on a coffee stout. I like how the wood and earthy qualities have a dominant factor. It reminds me of camping. I really liked this one."
"I liked the idea behind this beer, but overall I think it lacked something. The coffee tones were a nice touch, as you might expect in your stout. The drawback, however, was in the harshness. Even served at around 60 degrees the alcohol bit into the cheeks and overwhelmed the hints of what could have been. I still like the beer, and wouldn't mind trying it again some day, but there are some stronger competitors out there. Another detail I might mention is the smell. Unique, I'll grant it that, but still abrasive, and like the taste, only hinting at the great idea the spawned the beast. Middle of the pack for Dogfish head, from whom I've come to expect both the best and the worst."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really didn't enjoy that much. There is a funky taste in this one that I didn't love."
"O: The flavors on this beer are light and very satisfying while still being somewhat complex and interesting. The low ABV make it a good beer to enjoy a few and the creamy mouthfeel almost make it seem like a coffee milkshake. Not a bad brew."
""
""
""
"O - I'm very glad I only bought a single of this brew... Disappointing at $3/12oz. There's no hop, whatsoever. No bitterness, and overly sweet. Not recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Over all this is a pretty nice beer, it would lend its self very nicely to an out door sporting event in the colder months."
""
""
"O - While I can't say I notice a remarkable difference with the roasted chicory and organic Mexican coffee, I can say that this is a very nice Stout. To me the carbonation level was a bit too high and at times just made the beer seem more Porter like. Other than that, it didn't wow me but it's pretty good and I would probably buy it again sometime in the future. Cheers!"
"Straightforward but done very well. The low ABV and not-so-sweet taste make this brew an easy-drinking go-to stout."
""
"O - Overall this was a good enough stout, just not really DFH tier though. Nice trying it, but you can find better American Stouts out there."
"Pours out nigh-black until held closely to a light source...than it gets some dark brown highlights around the edges. Single finger of tan colored head dissipates into a thin fizzy membrane on the surface of the brew in about two minutes. Very nice bubbly carbonation in spite of this, however, and a lovely silky medium thick body. Aroma is strong with chicory licorice at first, but this element fades out gradually over time compared to the other aspects as the brew warms up. As it warms, It develops much more of a roasted element alongside a strange coconut / bitter spiced chocolate candy odor. I taste some nice roasted chocolate at first which resolves into a black coffee which is significantly milder in harshness than the black coffee notes I typically get from stouts, perhaps it is the chicory acting as a tempering agent? There is definitely a herbal / earthen hopping accent, and the oddball coconut aroma is missing from the flavor... strange yet satisfying. Very full of flavor for the low ABV. I like it. Comes across as almost a sort of holiday spiced stout."
""
""
""
"O - I have had quite a few coffee stouts, this is definitely one of the better ones. Extremely well balanced overall, very smooth, good flavor combinations. Gimme another."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very average offering for an American Stout. There are some good qualities here and I think the woodiness adds an interesting layer of dimension. But overall, this is just an okay beer from one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - i really enjoy this beer and it's quickly becoming one of my go to seasonal stouts. alcohol content is low enough to have a few in a night no problem. stands out amongst coffee stouts due to the somewhat unusual ingredients (st john's wort and licorice anyone?). will definitely be picking up more of this."
""
"Another solid choice from DFH"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"o- not a bad brew at all. I'll tell you this....add a bunch more coffee and this would be even better! Good brew at any rate"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Slight chocolate sweetness upfront followed by chicory, roasted malt and espresso. Light mouthfeel but the flavor held really well. Full bodied, smooth and really delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a decent easy drinker with nice flavors."
""
""
"O: Pretty nice. Not DFH's best stout, but I like the smoky/chicory woodiness. Pretty nice."

""
""
""
""

"Chicory Stout pours black with a half-inch light tan head which breaks up leaving a black face that's frosted with tan throughout my pour. There is a nice ring with some great looking lacing. Smell is some roasted dark malts up front, sweet milk chocolate, and faint coffee. This first hits similar to a sweet milk stout with the coffee flavor notes subtle and sneaky. It's great that this is not overdone. Pretty smooth all around with a light aftertaste. Much lighter than I expected. No alcohol noticeable and carbonation is on the lower end. It's a classy brew for sure. A complex coffee blend in a stout that you could session it up with; yeah I said it. Dogfish Head getting the holiday season started with a solid banger."
""
""
"Overall: A great beer from DFH and one of my new favorites. Definitely give it a try."
"Beer is nice, medium in body, good malt sweetness, the backend of the beer is nice, not ashy or too bitter, finishes without being too dry, a nice little stout, very fun. I won't have a problem drinking the other 3 I bought today."

"Overall, this bastard of a brew is unique and DFH really differentiates themselves against other stouts with this here beer (great, off-the-wall flavor combination of highly ""un-traditional"" ingredients) . This is the last seasonal DFH that I've tried and I've had all but 2-3 of them that they will brew this year. As with everything they do, I think they almost created their own style here."
"O - A decent stout, but not something I would go back to. The over roastedness isn't a flavor I find appealing."
"D: This drinks quite nicely, very session able."
"O: If you like coffee and chicory, you'll probably like this. I'm not the biggest a fan of either."
"Overall: I truly like the what Dogfish Head brought to the table with Chicory Stout....only issue it might carry with it is probably wanting to keep drinking more because it leaves your mouth and nose so quickly."
"Overall: A very decent American stout from DFH. I'm glad I got this and would love to try it on tap. Good for parties or get-togethers when you want a lower ABV brew with plenty of flavour."
"Pours black with a beautiful creamy mocha-colored head that settles to a thick, soapy haze. Nice aromas of dark roasted malt, coffee, cocoa, and some sweet cream. Taste follows the nose nicely, mostly getting coffee and chocolate in a lovely mocha way. Hops still have a bit of a presence, surprising since the bottle is older. Really well balanced and drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately creamy, with a medium-full body and medium-low carbonation. Overall a great every-day Stout!"
"This beer pours out as a nice dark black color, the head is thick and tan in color. The lacing is pretty nice on this brew and the retention is also nice. The smell of the beer has a light spiciness to it mixed with a chocolaty roasted malt aroma. The taste of the beer is semi-sweet upfront with a nice herbal roasted aftertaste with just a hint of some kind of spice in there too. The mouthfeel of this beer has a good thickness to it as well as a good carbonation. Overall this brew is nicely done. Pretty good stuff."
"Deep black into the tulip glass with foamy, khaki head. Smells of dark fruits, maple syrup, coffee, and roasted malt. The chicory is also noticeable, but blends very well with the other fruity scents. Taste is milder than expected. Roasted chicory and malt, faint date and raisin, and a touch of coffee in the rear. Mouth is rather thin for a stout, being cut by the carbonation. Really reminds me more of a milder porter than a stout, but not bad by any means."
"O-Decent, but not outstanding effort. I could live without the sour note."
"O- pretty great as most dogfish are, nice stout which was a surprise from dogfish"
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is a very dark brown color, with nut brown highlights and a thin, bubbly head. Slight coffee aroma with a very dark sweetness to it. The beer initially has a sharp licorice sweet flavor all over the tongue, with a slight smokiness underlying it all. Very smooth and creamy in mouth. The aftertaste is sweet, with a cherry-like character, and a sweet, semi-lingering finish. Great body to help balance the unique and interesting flavors."
"A nice beer. It's not crazy, overly exciting or particularly full-flavoured, but it's pleasant and easy to drink. A nice, moderate ABV stout."
"Overall, the beer is good fare, but not quite up to Dogfish Head's usual quality; here, the beer seems out-of-balance with itself, devoting too much attention to the fancy added flavors, to the unfortunate detriment of regular stout flavors. With as much coffee and chicory as is present here, I would have expected at least half again the malt backing."
"Pours a dark brown color with head. Smells of coffee, malts and smoky wood. Heavy beer, tastes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, an earthy wood or bark tinge and some hops and malts. It finishes dry with little sweetness, almost bitter. It’s complex and well-made, but perhaps a bit too dry for my tastes."
"I've always thought of the Chicory Stout as a weaker stout, but given some age, it rounds out pretty nice. If you've got some, age it a year, check in, and see how much better it is then."
"You know, I don't hate it but it is certainly not a great beer. Straight up down the road. It may be a little closer to an American Porter for me. It has such an ashen taste and aroma that the stout classification throws me off a little bit--and the burning grains don't meld with the lighter body. Drinkable? Yep? Delectable? Nope."
"It has an above average mouthfeel that ends in a dry feint of sugary malt. I do enjoy drinking this - usually after several of DFH's more hoppy offerings. A real dependable brew to say the least."
"As I sip this beer it seems to be all over the place, one time it tastes great, the next it seems a little funny. i will certainly have to try it again."
"A smooth and balanced stout with plenty of character. This one's a winner."
"O - This wasn't my favorite beer fresh, and I don't think 8 months of age has really done anything for this beer. I'm a huge dogfish head fan, but I think this is my least favorite offering. Not sure if I'll be tempted to pick any up next winter when its bumped down to the four packs. Still a decent stout with an interesting twist that is worth a try."
"O; I think this is a very drinkable beer which is nice to find in a stout, but the flavors do suffer due to this."
"D - Smooth and creamy."
"O: A great coffee stout. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Certainly an off center beer, but not anything at all to get excited about. Dogfish head is an odd brewery who makes some great beers and some just plain bad ones. This one is just pretty average. If you don’t like some of the fruity flavors or the coffee hints this one is a strongly recommended pass. If you’re into those things, you might give it a shot, but anyone on a budget there are so many better beers."
"Poured a black opaque color looks like used motor oil as it rolls from the bottle to the glass. A thick beige/caramel head, about two inches high, forms on top. The head then dissolves away slowly to a thin layer on top. Chocolate and coffee fragrances strike the nose at first scent, followed by a sugar syrup scent and ending with a twang of licorice. The malt comes out at the front of each taste with the expected chocolate and coffee flavors. Then the flavor just seems to fade away, a slight touch of burnt bitterness, but nothing comes forward to stand out. The feel is a big disappointment, it starts across the palate like a heavy water and it thins out very quickly. This beer started out great, beautiful color and thick look. A solid and fragrant aroma, then it all went to hell. The flavors were there but it never brought any strength with and faded way too quickly. The feel left me in a WTF mode for some time. This was a big let down of a beer, from a brewer that I usually enjoy beers from."
"Poured opaque black with a tan head. Roasted malts and over-roasted coffee to the nose. Malty and roasted coffee beans / chicory to the tongue, with some semi-sweet chocolate notes. Medium mouthfeel for a stout with some carbonation. Pretty drinkable, but not too memorable. Maybe just too big on the roast, and not quite as smooth as I prefer for the style."
"O - Nice coffee stout that is a wee bit different."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being low. Overall it's a very good beer, one of my favorite Dogfish seasonals. It somehow manages to be smooth and relatively easy drinking even with all the roasty, bitter flavors. A very solid beer overall."
"D/O: Very crisp and bubbly for a stout, good weight and fabulously interesting flavor."
"This beer is amazing!"
"D: great tasting stout. just enough of roast/coffee/sweetness to all worth nicely in the nose/palate. the creamy body helps all this facets as well."
"Overall. A solid stout. Nice nutty flavor gives it some character."
"I enjoy most of dogfish heads products. There brown ale is my favorite beer they make. The stout at hand has an excellent distinct smell to it, almost like like a spice / wood . The taste resembling the same. From experience I can say chicory stout goe's well with steak witch can't be beat."
"Thing is... I like it. A lot. But I don't think it's a perfect beer. If you like stouts and chicory go for it; but be aware the texture and body remind me more of a porter."
"O: Good stout. Nothing too amazing however. Probably would only drink 1 of these at a time."
"O: Not bad, but not my favorite. A little thin and the coffee/chicory combination isn't my favorite. I can see how some people might really like it, but its not really for me."
"O: An interesting stout from DFH. Did not know what to expect of this one, but I enjoyed it. I would try this again."
"Drinks well. It's a nice beer that has its applications to be sure. I like that so much flavor can be gleaned from such a low ABV beer. Easy drinking and ""big"" all at once."
"Not sure what I was expecting, but what I got was a pretty average stout with a novel flavor that works offset by some off flavors that don't."
"Overall: Pretty good beer overall. Neither my favorite Dogfish Head offering, nor my favorite stout by any means. That said, it's still worth a try."
"O: Let the beer warm and still got a very one dimensional beer with weak flavors"
"Very good, another solid brew from the great DGFH. Not the best stout probably, but a good,shining example."
"D - This is an evenly brewed stout, easy on the palate, good mix of flavors going on, seems to me this would be a good one to give to someone who was venturing into the stout arena."
"While I was not exactly a fan of the finish on this beer, it did make me want to keep taking another sip."
"Nonetheless, the less intense elements added to the drinkability and I would certainly buy again. Typically I would drink one stout and be good. This is a stout I could drink two and enjoy."
"Poured dark with a dark tan two-finger head...smell was sweet with cocoa and coffee and molasses...taste was at first astringent in a black coffee sort of way. Sweet like walnuts, bur overriding flavor is coffee. bitter like readskin peanuts. Medium texture and body. Medium carbonation. Oily and slippery....smooth finish was with lingering bitterness...an excellent beer. Refreshing and bracing."
"D: Drinkable stout. Tasty and ABV is only 5.2@."
"D - Drinkable, but not a standout. Will I have it again? Sure, but only because I have the rest of the 6 pack."
"I contend that this is more porter like than stout, but it has good roasty flavors and goes down easily. Dogfish knows their way around roast."
"On tap last night at 51 Lincoln in Newton. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark brown color with a frothy white head. Lacing all over the glass. Smell was musty, smoky, and reminded me of roasted chestnuts. Flavor was dark and smooth. Bitter chocolate, bark, coffee and molasses were some of the great flavor that struck me. Mouthfeel was on the thin side for a stout, but it didn't hinder the drinkability. Quite quaffable, with a manageable abv. Paired nicely with a dozen oysters and a cheese plate - a delicious dinner."
"The taste follows the nose. My immediate thought is that there is basically no sweetness to this beer at all. The taste is mostly bitter, and slightly sour. It reminds me a little of coffee, without tasting strongly of coffee, although it is in there. This is not heavy, and somewhat carbonated, and it seems to be highly drinkable."
"Drinkability- Easy to drink, albeit thin. I found it somewhat one dimensional and disappointing. Needs something else."
"Enjoyed this at One for the Road near Pittsburgh. Pitch black in color with a light tan head. The head didn't last long but I am one of those who thinks the head is purely for show so I wont hold that against it. This is an easy drinker for a stout and, based on appearance, the overall effect is unexpected. Even folks who dont typically like stout can enjoy this one. Nice silky mouthfeel with prominent tastes of coffee, slightly nutty, and slightly sweet."
"Had a few pints of Espresso Randalled Chicory at the Fairfax Alehouse today. Color is pitch black with a light brown head, doesn't stick around long and leaves minimal lacing. Aromas are nice on this one, coffee coffee coffee. Subtle roasted grain and chocolate notes waft beneath the espresso rush. Taste is superb, rich and roasty, lots of coffee but still maintains balance. I've always loved Chicory for the clean bitter finish and big malty front. Solid randall night at DFH."
"This is another Dogfish Head beer that is interesting, but I don't love. To be fair, I assumed I was about to encounter a stout brewed with chicory, which I got. What I didn't expect was a stout brewed with whatever could be found a round the brewer's kitchen, which I also got."
"D - Good overall American Stout but not anything too exciting. I would easily drink this again."
"D: smooth as heck and easy to down.. one of my new favourite stouts!"
"Given the low ABV, I could enjoy a few of these when I'm in the mood for more than one stout."
"Overall, a pretty fair brew that's worth a shot if you see it."
"D: Excellent - tasty but light in alcohol, so it goes down easily."
"The smell of roasted malts and chicory scoffee was evident in this pleasant aroma. The taste was of roasted malts, roasted chicory coffee, semi sweet baking chocolate, with a hint of brown sugar. Very complex and well balanced. The warmer it got, the more the complex flavor changed, not as bitter. Well crafted stout."
"Pours a dark brown with a touch of brownish head. Burnt caramel and coffee come through on the nose. The taste is more of the same with a pleasant bitter finish. The mouthfeel is light, almost like an Irish dry stout style. A fairly drinkable beer, as long as it's not too warm out."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"D - This is a pretty easy drinker that I think would go well with a steak or roasted meat dish. I can also imagine washing down a big bite of meatloaf with this one."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours thick, dark brown and nearly black, with a thin tan head that fades quickly. Aroma is very roasty, fresh-brewed coffee, vanilla, cocoa, and brown sugar. Flavor is smoky and roasty with notes of earthiness and bark. Fairly thin, somewhat lively carbonation; this could be a bit thicker."
"O- Overall, I love this beer. Very creamy and rich. Has a nice complexity with a smoothness and easy drinking fashion that makes this beer outstanding. I wish Dogfish produced this year round because I would certainly purchase it throughout the year."
"Overall, not a great stout, but still enjoyable."
"Poured into a pint glass this beer looks like black coffee with a 1/2"" tan head that disappears quickly. Smelled like coffee and toffee up front, then catching mild alcoholic and smokey scents some dark chocolate and toffee as well. Also tasted like black coffee, with acidic, bitter chocolate tones and some smokey aftertaste. It had a medium body with decent carbonation. Fairly drinkable but as I am not a coffee drinker I would probably not consume the entire 6 pack in one night or anything. Overall it was very underwhelming. A bit of a disappointment from dfh for me."
"D- Very drinkable, and a nice effort at being RIS like while having a fairly light ABV. All in all it didn't blow me away, but it had several of the aspects that I look for in a stout. The mouthfeel could have been thicker and the flavor a bit richer, but that's about it. Very good considering how light the ABV is."
"Body is pretty fluid, reminds me a lot of Rogue's Shakespeare stout. Nice brew, but I'd like it better if the body and taste were emboldened a bit."
"Overall this is actually a DFH beer I can get behind. I usually font care for DFH but try their products when a new one comes my way. I'll probably get this one again."
"Overall not bad. I wouldn't say it's bad in anyway. Just not flawless (whos is!)"
"Overall, just didn't enjoy this one very much. It's not bad but there isn't much aroma or flavor to it. Better than a BMC but not by much. Love DFH but this one is a miss for me. Not avail in TX so shipped back from Indy trip. Rotation - one is enough [N;N]"
"Very good beer. I could probably only drink one in a session."
"M - Thin bodied, creamy yet a little watery."
"The mouthfeel feels just a bit too watery for the style, and the carbonation feels a little high. It never meshes quite right with the bitterness of the brew. However, it is very drinkable for having such bold flavors. A great beer from Dogfish, and one that I'll surely get a sixer of next season. Something to look forward to."
"d: it's very drinkable due to the low abv and lighter mouthfeel."
"D - i have a soft spot for coffee stouts and this is a nice take, the flavour mix is rich, and goes down smooth, worth indulging in again"
"D - Drinkability is moderate. Smell and taste are both a tad on the mild side, while the mouthfeel just feels a bit thin. Especially given this is a winter seasonal, I would think DFH would put out a chewier stout, but I could see this beer being an easy drinker in the summer."
"D - This is a good session stout. There are no areas where I can knock it but it could be more memorable. Just a little bit above average."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a massively dark brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, spices, coffee, and chocolate. The flavor was of roasted malt, spices, subtle coffee, and spicy chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. It was a little on the light side for the mouthfeel than I like my stouts, but still not terrible. This was a pretty unique stout with the spicy chocolate aspect to it. This one is worth trying at least once to get your opinion on it."
"Pours a pitch black with a medium off-white/tan had that diminishes quickly. Scent is chocolatey and a bit roasty. I get some mellow coffee aromas with a hint of vanilla and earthiness. Taste is very earthy at first, then follows with bitter chocolate and some light coffee flavors. Finishes with a bit of vanilla and oats. Mouthfeel is very light and fluffy...a bit watery, but not too watery. The fluffiness of this stout makes up for it. Awesome mouthfeel. Drinkability is high, as it is a stout you could definitely session."
"D: Good quality stout with very smooth and warm flavors, though a little less than what I expect from Dogfish head, they normally have more deep flavors at play. Still a good stout though."
"Would recomend this beer."
"Pours a deep dark black into my DFH signature glass with about an inch of tan head that fades into about a quarter inch. Smells like freshly brewed pot of coffee, awesome. As it warms some chocolate comes through as well. Taste is mostly a nice rich coffee flavor. Some cocoa and vanilla in there as well. Finishes nicely, a little dry with some roastiness lingering on the palate after each sip. Mouthfeel is a little thin for the style and really the only area this beer doesn't excel in. Very drinkable, especially with breakfast on the weekend."
"If I knew exactly what chicory tasted like I might understand it more, but either way this is a winner."
"As I'm sure you can tell I really enjoyed drinking this beer. This is right now neck and neck with Dogfish heads other beer called Miles Davis Bitches Brew. My local beer store here in San Diego is selling a six pack for $12.99 and I suggest if you see one of these you pick it up."
"I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this is my favorite thus far. Other than Dragon's Milk, that is, which would have to be considered a hybrid of the style."
"Sort of sad, the taste didn't match the smell as I had hoped it would."
"Into a pint glass, pours a very dark brown (nearly black) with 1 finger of creamy tan head - just a few traces of lacing left behind. Great nose on this stout - lots of coffee & chicory, roasted malts, and chocolate are the prominent aromas. Not quite as rich as the smell would lead you to believe, but a nice roast and smokiness to the flavor, especially in the finish. Medium bodied, and lighter in carbonation. Some nice things going on in this lower ABV stout from DFH."
"D - A good beer but the mouthfeel really stops it for me. No alcohol to speak of which could make this beer easy to drink a few of a night."
"This brew pours a dark cola colour with decent carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head and sporadic lacing but not much at all,the smell is very strong and has aromas of tobacco,dark coffee,oak and burnt wood,the mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and nicely carbonated and i find the most of the aromas come through on taste aswell with hints tobacco,dark coffee,mocha,oak,roasted biscuts and finishes like a nice strong cappicino with that hint of distinctive bitterness that really rounds it out and definately a drop that i would revisit its really tasty and would be even tastier on a cold winters night instead of a hot day like today."
"Overall - a very very tasty session beer that reminds me of a warm christmas night"
"Drinkability- Being a huge Guinness fan throughout college, DogFish Head nailed this stout and will be looking to take a 6-pack home for people who can't enjoy DogFish Head in Missouri. I would recommend this stout and is without a doubt on my top 20 list of stouts I have had. Would only drink one or two of these stouts in a day."
"D - Overall a tasty stout, but I found it a bit too sour/bitter for my liking. Worth a try for sure and easily drinkable, but I've had better. Nonetheless, a decent offering from Dogfish and I'm glad I was able to take it for a test drive."
"This stout pours black with a moderate tan head and subtle garnet glow when held to a light. The aroma is highly malty -- roast coffee predominately with subtle chocolate and bittersweet malt. The flavor is very much like the nose, highly roasty and coffee flavor upfront. The beer finishes just a bit dry and bittersweet. The body is medium-full with moderate carbonation. Overall a very flavorful coffee stout that also boasts some very high drinkability."
"D - Very easy for a stout quite drinkable"
"Libation: If you were to describe this beer to some prior to sampling, it might impress, unfortunately this doesn't carry into the actual taste."
"Drinkability - Not terribly complex, but interesting enough to have once or twice with a group of friends."
"D/M: strong carbonation tingle, slightly thick on the pallet, drinks deep and with great malt flavors"
"Overall, not bad. I have had a fair number of stouts, imperial and otherwise, and this one falls right in the middle. Not enough going on to really make me want more. If it were in front of me, though, I wouldn't refuse it."
"Overall; Nice look not as fantastic a taste. It was half its size it would be worth trying I am not a huge fan though"
"Drink- Doesn't drink like a stout and I am sure this could be a good gateway stout for people to start with. Not a bad beer, just expected more."
"D-Pretty average stout, overall pretty well rounded, would definitely try again"
"D_ Delicious and drinks very easy."
"Came to me with no head at MacGregors Penfield. Body was dark brown, almost black. Aroma is malty and stout-like with ncie hints of wood, chocolate and coffee. Taste is supa rich. Theres lotsa vanilla, oak, mint, caramel and chicory with the slightest smokiness. This is sugary sweet without being cloying. Feel is super smooth. Surprisingly drinkable with all this flavor goin on."
"A nice well rounded brew in my opinion, worthy of many more."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with a one finger khaki colored head which gives way to rings of lace. The aroma is of a roasted malt backbone with a big whiff of coffee in the middle balanced out with some earthy hops. The flavor has a coffee backbone with hints of dark chocolate. Citrus flavors come through in the middle to the end to round out and balance the brew. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall its a very drinkable beer, it has a nice big aroma and a well balanced flavor to make you want more. The beer is smooth as well."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation that pops in the mouth. Lots of flavor packed into this well balanced brew and it is quite drinkable but a little watery. It is much more coffee flavored this time around than I remember when I had it before out of a bottle. No complaints here, I'll have another."
"This is a unique stout, as it is rare to find any quite this floral, yet roasted with coffee and generous malt all at the same time. This is a treat."
"D- Very easy to drink. Very nice balance of flavors."
"Chicory stout pours very dark, almost black with some ruby notes around the edges. It has a half inch just creamy off white head that dissipates to a light covering and leaves a bit of lacing down the sides of the glass. The nose is great, with notes of roasted barley, chocolate malt, and a little bit of coffee. The taste is good, but not great, with the same coffee and chocolate and roasty flavors. Has some creaminess as well which is very nice. The beer is medium bodied, but is a bit light on carbonation."
"This one isn't really for me. It isn't bad, but the flavours just don't hit the spot for me. Interesting, but interesting only carries a beer so far."
"d - A good stout but a little disappointing. I thought the taste was a big step down from the nose and was just average; nothing about it really jumped out at me. Not bad and would give another shot, but not the best."
"Pours brown-black. Nice pillowy tan head with good retention. Smell is pretty, with a sweet, spicy nose on a great malty stout base. Taste is blander than the smell. I've had chicory before, and you can definitely detect the dry ""rootiness"" of it. No hops to speak of. Finish is quick, this beer almost cleans the palette.. Very unique, I hesitate to say very good, though. A different & positive beer experience."
"D- Very interesting and smooth! Very easy to drink"
"Overall this wasn't a special beer but was very drinkable and well done for the style. Worth a shot."
"Dogfish Head Chicory Stout is a solid, tawny black ale with a dense khaki head that thins to a film and leaves excellent lacing. It has a strong, roasty, herbal aroma with notes of coffee and chicory. It's pretty full bodied. It's a little metallic at first and then very chewy at the finish. It has chocolate and coffee ice cream flavors, perhaps a note of strawberry. It's well balanced. The bitterness isn't blatant, but it sustains the finish. It's creamy with a hint of lactose. It's a solid stout that's found a niche."
"This was a stout poured from a bottle into a glass. Not much head when pour. Served chilled, but does not need to be that cold. Really Dark brew. The smell has a strong coffee scent, possibly espresso. This beer is so dark it is black. Also a tad bit vanilly, with roasted malts. Average alcohol content. Roasted flavor. Slightly hoppy feel."
"D - Just missed this one last season, so I've been waiting a year to try it. I'm not disappointed. It is quite tasty and very drinkable. Tastes just right for a cold, windy night."
"To me this comes across as a stout that doesn't manage to pull it together in any way that makes it stand out from any other mediocre stout on the market. The extra ingredients don't really offer anything positive or noteworthy beyond what the base already provides (and falls short) either. Sounds like a great recipe concept, but lacks cohesion and body to follow it through."
"Since I was in the dark beer mood, I decided to have the Chicory Stout from Dogfish at the same location as my last review --but it wasn't listed above. Really, really good. Perfect weather for it now. I might just be becoming a dark beer fan now. For most of the categories, I will leave it to others to get into the weeds with. But, I can say I really liked this beer. I actually thought it might be higher in alcohol than the listed here on beeradvocate but I liked it a lot!!"
"Overall very good at least to my palate, my wife said it was a bit bitter but not too bitter. I t was very tasty to me though just short of excellent. Nice head, nice color, nice aroma. A nice bright spice almost licorice sort of note on the top of the usual stout/dark beer type of taste is what I tasted - I tend to not review with ""tastes of"" in my reviews since that is very subjective to me - I almost never taste many of the things tasters claim to taste - IMHO it is either a nice tasty brew or not - in this case, Tasty!"
"This is really only a few steps up from A Yuengling Porter... and almost a staircase more expensive!"
"On tap @ UPick6 in Erie PA. Pours black with ruby hues. Aroma of chocolate and Burnt Coffee. Flavor of chocolate, some Burnt coffee, also hints of smoke. Mouth feel is medium body with medium carbonation. Overall, not bad. The Burnt taste was a little too much by the end of the glass. I was expecting something a little better from Dogfish head though."
"I just recently learned that chicory has been used as a cheap substitute for coffee beans for a good chunk of American history. Which seems appropriate here, as the coffee really stands out, over what I have to assume is the earthy, woody character from the chicory."
"D: great stout that is easy drinking and ABV extremely reasonable still allowing for great flavor."
"This is an excellent beer, I've just found another reliable go-to stout for any number of drinking occasions. Winner."
"Great beer to have after dessert"
"By no means a bad beer, but a bit underwhelming. Complexity is there, but the flavors don't mesh perfectly."
"Well done!"
"Overall- while it won't knock your socks off with a high ABV all the flavors are well balanced and unique. It is a highly enjoyable beer that would be a perfect complement to a Sunday of football."
"i love how drinkable this beer is for a stout. i have to say when i fist thought about coffee and beer together i kinda flinched. this beer however, is very smokey with a chocolaty, coffee finish. really great for a dark beer. its a good winter beer."
"It's occurred to me that I don't know what chicory is, I'm guessing it's the earthy smell I can't place. not a bad beer but for what it costs here in Alberta I doubt I'll be drinking it again"
"Dark reddish-brown, very clear when held to the light. The tan head quickly recedes to a collar. Smells light; roasty with earthy coffee notes, a bit bready. Watery on the palate, dry and very thin. Chalky mouthfeel. Roasty, earthy flavors up front; a bit herbal and minty toward the finish with an odd Alka-seltzer note. This is thoroughly unimpressive."
"DB- Nice stout with a good roast profile and unique flavor from the chicory."
"D: Very drinkable,have not had any dogfish that was not a highly awaited experience.DFH beers are all surprising and well received even if you have already had them they still captivate the mouth and make you notice the flavors."
"D: Regardless of the feel, it was very drinkable; smooth and pleasing. Moderate ABV. I had 3."
"D: To me, DFH is pretty hit or miss. This one isn't quite a miss, but it's not one of their best. Or perhaps this one is just not for me. Do you like chicory? Perhaps you will love it. But a traditional coffee flavored stout this one is not."
"D - Fairly drinkable for the style."
"D-very good, easy to enjoy several of these in a sitting"
"Poured a dark brown, almost black, with a dark brown head. Aroma was very toasty with a hint of coffee and maybe some chocolate. Flavor is similar and you can definitely taste the chicory. Mouthfeel is a little heavy for this strength."
"Taste wise, there was a lot going on, but it just did not seem to mesh into a complete experience for me."
"D - It was good, but I probably can only drink one before I move onto something else."
"Pours black with a tan foamy head. Notes of roasted malts in the nose, coffee and dark chocolate. Chicory aromas come out as it warms. Taste is smooth drinking, mild bitterness and coffee flavour round out the middle, finished dry. Creamy mid-heavy mouthfeel. Great tasting and easy to sip, rather low ABV for DFH which I dont mind. 6 pack should last the season for future cold winter nights."
"Pours black with a two-finger light brown head. Average lacing and retention. Big coffee aroma. Roasted woodsy notes as well. Flavor follows. Nice bitter roasted coffee flavor up front, also a hint of bitter, unsweetened chocolate. Sticky molases before a very good smokey, woodsy profile next. You can definitely taste the chicory. Surprisingly very smooth for the big roasted flavor throughout."
"The mouthfeel is thin for a stout with moderate carbonation. It's an odd sensation to drink a stout that is so thin, but it makes for a highly drinkable and sessionable stout perfect for a winter's night. Chicory Stout proves that a coffee stout doesn't have to be a big, bad ABV bomb to be an enjoyable beer."
"Overall, this is an interesting beer. I have never tried chicory root, but I have to say this beer has a unique taste, most likely because of the chicory. The beer is straight up coffee flavors, so if you don't like those flavors, steer clear. The watery taste is my primary negative and that wimpy head."
"Light and not overly complex, but quite balanced and very drinkable. Wouldn't make a point to seek it out again, but it was definitely worth a try."
"D - This is one stout I could drink several of, which isn't typical. It's very smooth and easy to drink"
"D: This is a good stout, but there are so many great stouts out there, I would not rush to get this again."
"A-3.0 / S- 4.5 / T- 4.0 / M- 3.0 / D-3.5"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its drinkability. It was interestingly light for a stout, which acted to increase the ease of consumption. This unfortunately meant a sacrifice in other departments, namely those of taste and aroma, which were unpleasantly metallic. Additionally, its lightness also acted against it, in that the drinker is left wanting something more substantial."
"Drinkability - Quite nice for the winter months. I'd go find it again."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but due to the high flavor of this beer, I'd probably choose a different stout for a session."
"D-Quite drinkable for a coffee stout. Great for Monday Night Football while it is snowing outside."
"D: Really good."
"A nice, no-frills coffee stout. Easy-drinking and tasty, perfect for winter-time football watching sessions and the like."
"D: Easy drinking stout, not bad at all for <$10 a sixer."
"D: Would drink again, would not drink more than one in an evening"
"Overall, a flavorful and pleasant stout."
"D: Very drinkable given the fact that it isn't as thick and heavy as most stouts. Could easily have more than one."
"Overall, this an excellent winter brew! The chicory and coffee it was brewed with is evident. Its very pleasant to sip on this brew while watching the snow fall outside. This is Dogfish Head's winter beer so I will have to grab some more of this while I still can. Highly recommended."
"Tastes like your usual stout with an added fruity-ish flavor that I'm personally down with. Solid beer, enjoyable mouthfeel and I feel like I could drink several of these if I was more of a stout guy. Love the way it looks, and it definitely has a lot to offer if your a stout guy. But I do wish it was a little more robust than it is. I think with little more character, it'd be a top-notch stout."
"D: It drinks like it has a higher abv and for that I like it. I was honestly expecting more from the flavor. It didn't have a lot of depth or really that strong of a flavor for me."
"Goes down rather easy for me, but just not my cup of tea. Glad I tried it and appreciate the gesture, but I don't think I'll be picking this one up again. Was hoping the chicory flavors were in the foreground on this one, but it quickly slid into the unmemorable, lighter bodied stout category for me."
"Drinkable. tasty but undercarbonated and overall a ""lightweight"" Stout. When it comes to Stout,battleships or sledgehammers...I ain't looking for lightweight. Not as robust as I'd want."
"This beer pours pitch black and oil like. The head is tan with great lacing around the glass. The aroma is coffee, chicory, and chocolate. The taste is of coffee and chocolate, little hops, roasted malts. This medium bodied beer is smooth and dry. Overall not bad but one is enough."
"it took me a few mouth fulls to get any chicory taste its masked by the roasted barley and coffee. it makes itself apparent in the very end. i wish there was more."
"I remember enjoying the Chicory Stout I had last winter more than this, but I still very much enjoy it."
"Drinkability - The drinkability of the beer is not as high as I would like. It's good and a bit different, but the Mexican spice gets to me after a bit. Probably could only have one or two at a time."
"Overall, this is another interesting beer from Dogfish Head, but I doubt I would drink this again."
"D - It is very filling and at times too sweet, drinking more than two would be a struggle. Not one of my favourites from DFH."
"Overall, this is a pretty tasty beer from DFH, albeit a little out there, but that's most of their beers. Good flavor, solid drinkability, and an interesting drink. Give it a shot if you see it."
"Drinkability is very high, could easily drink this one all night."
"Overall a very straightforward and not very complex stout. Drinkability is high and I could definetely session this one."
"D- The first time I've had this in a few years, and it's better than I remembered."
"This beer pours a dark black color with a tan head. The smell reminds me of chocolate and roasted malts along with a hint of hickory smoked bacon. The taste reminds me of a well balanced stout. Plenty of roasted and chocolate malt balanced very well with hops. Has an interesting taste from the chicory. The moutfeel is thick, overall this is a great beer."
"Overall I think this is a great stout and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the stout style."
"D: As I said above, this is in serious contention as my favorite American-brewed stout. Very drinkable, and it's a shame that this is a seasonal release."
"D - I think this beer is very drinkable. It goes down easily and quickly. I could easily drink a 6-pack of these. This is not my favorite stout by any means, but I think it is pretty good."
"Cheers."
"Overall: This is a so so beer. It's more of a light porter then stout. Not much flavor or mouthfeel. Not sure what the point of this beer is. I expected bigger coming from DFH."
"D: it drank really good for the flavor being really rich and roastiness. It did take me back to the cafe con leche days."
"A very drinkable stout and another great offering from DFH. This is a no brainer."
"Not much else to say. Not very bitter at all. It's like drinking coffee but different, so it's a 4.5 for drinkability. Wonderful winter beer!"
"drinkabililty: heavy yet smooth, with more than adequate touches of flavor, it is balanced enough that it could stand a slightly higher abv, but still a quality example of the style all the same."
"drinkability - the mouthfeel kinda kills the experience on this one as does the aftertaste, probably the biggest flaws in the beer, flavor is unique and earthy notes are desirable but not likely to bjcp guidelines"
"Drinkability -- This one didn't really do it for me. Middle of the pack at best, especially if judging this as a coffee stout. Not terrible, but I probably could've done better with my six-pack purchase that evening."
"Appearance is darkness, cant see through it, black as night with a nice creamy brown 3 finger head. Has some light lacing around the glass as the head bubbles away. Smells smokey, chocolatey and coffee (from the chicory?). Got a wiff of earth at the first nosing but cant pick it up again. Licorice. Smell is pleasant with lots of different things to pick up on at each nosing. Tastes chocolaty with slight bitter taste on the back of the toungue. There is a floral or herb taste that makes itself known on every other drink. Rich and flavorful, not as mealy or thick as other stouts, goes down pretty smooth. Mouthfeel leaves a little to be desired but that may just be my taste, i like carbonated brews and shy from porters which is what this reminds me of rather than a stout. Dogfish head lives up to its reputation for providing me something that i have never tasted before and for that i thank you. Not my favorite stout but is definitely unique."
"Nice, full mouthfeel; very smooth with no harshness or much bitterness. Chicory and coffee are great complementary flavors and they work really well in a low-alcohol stout like this."
"I'm enjoying this, but I must confess that I probably wouldn't want to do 2 bottles in a row; the flavor is nice, but it gets to be a bit much."
"Overall a pretty good stout. Nothing earth shattering. I have no idea what chicory tastes like so I can't comment on that."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down very smoothly, making it quite sessionable. I could easily drink a few of these in one sitting and would definitely considering having one with breakfast."
"D-this used to be one of my favorite stouts ever. i'm not sure why that has changed. is the beer different? or have i just exposed myself to much more flavorful stouts since i first had this. its definitely a good go to stout, something i'll get every winter. there are a lot of other better readily available stouts out there. very easy drinking though."
"D- nice unique stout, good blend of the flavors, could have several of these, and I'm not a heavy consumer of stouts."
"Extremely dark, light only shows through on edges. Head ring on glass, head dissapates quickly. Decent tan ring lacing on glass. Good notes of chocolate coffee, roasted maltiness evident in aroma as well. Coffee is really the first note thy jumps out at me. Good ,relatively high ,carbonation. Roasted malt shows in flavor. A little chocolate present. Hop bitteress evident in finish. And some grassy hop in the middle of the drink. A faint hint o alcohol in middle and finish of drink. Finish lightly dry but not astringently dry. Finishes pretty clean. Very drinkable stout."
"Sorry DFH. This was disappointing."
"Pours a very dark reddish brown with creamy one finger tan head, fades to thin layer leaving a few spots of lace. Smell: coffee-ish, wood smoked meatiness, earthy and leafy, vague cocoa. Taste: medium roast, dark chocolate syrup, solid earthy hop component. Light bodied and slick. Enjoyable, but not special. Bottled 11/1/10."
"Notes: Not terrible, but I personally did not care much for this beer. Too herbal and earthy, and bitter in an unpleasant way. It reminded me of drinking some kind of holistic tea. Maybe it's just the chicory that I don't like? At $11 for a six pack, one could do far better."
"All in all there's a lot of room for improvement with this brew, it looks and smells quite appetizing. But when it comes down to flavor and feeling there are a few more steps that need to be climbed. Honestly it just needs to be a tad bit stronger in flavor and thicker in feeling. But, all in all its not a bad brew, just one still in the making."
"D/O- I didn't know what chicory was until I looked it up. And even now I don't know what it is. I'd have to say the drinkability suffers a tad because of the coffee taste to it. Never-the-less a pretty good brew from DFH."
"very very drinkable"
"D: A treat, cafe au lait with a kick. So simple but so good."
"D: DFH beers are always interesting and this one is definitely ""off-centered."" It's a decent stout, but I think I prefer some other widely available offerings. The flavor's just a touch too idiosyncratic for me."
"Very pleasing brew, altogether. Could see this accompanying beef stew, beef pies, or other hearty beef meals."
"D- Very easy drinking stout and the alcohol is low."
"Pours a black color that is brown towards the edges; a beige creamy head that disipates into a sparse cap, some lacing on the glass. The aroma is roasty from malt and coffee, with dark chocolate notes, a touch of wood and some licorice. The taste is of a deep roasted malt, some coffee and chocolate. There is a hint of peat or some wood. The flavor tails off a bit in the end; finishes with a lemony tea like taste. The feel seems fairly light, especially towards the end, for a stout and has prickly carbonation. The beer remains bitter on the palate throughout. A very tasty stout for 5.2abv. It is well appreciated. It is fairly light at times but its quite flavorful."
"This was a good beer, however, its not a roasted coffee beer, if you like southern Chicory coffee, this is your beer."
"D: If you find that you like the chicory, this is a very easy-drinking beer."
"The body is nice and full and the great subtle touch of carb keeps this creamy and enjoyable. Lingering chocolate tries to persist but eventually gets washed out.  Ends in a mild touch of roast and minimal bitterness.  A very drinkable and enjoyable stout.  I'm glad to have finally enjoyed one!"
"I have not had one of these in about two years, and I definitely like it more now than way back when. This is a quality stout that would make a great go to winter beer, and probably would make a pretty badass beer float as well."
"Drinkable, but not exactly cheap or super easy to find in OH. But I could easily down a couple pints with dinner."
"A good stout, but doesn't measure up to the others in the category."
"Overall, this is a decent effort. I don't think its as bad as some of the reviews it has gotten would indicate but I'm still glad I tried it and I would recommend it to others. Worth a try but probably a good idea to avoid a six pack."
"goes down ok. chicory adds a bit of smoothness to what would otherwise be a harsh astringent and bitter coffee stout, but with the plethora of better coffee flavored stouts that have been brewed in recent years, this one pales in comparison."
"D: This is not one of the great American stouts for sure, but I still find myself ordering it from the Brewpub again, and again, and again. I guess that speaks volumes as to its drinkability huh?"
"D: As other reviewers have mentioned, as far as DFH brews go, this is not a particularly memorable one, though is none the less pretty good. Drinkable, yes, memorable, less so."
"D. This was a very drinkable stout that met mixed reviews at the table since people weren't expecting any adjuncts (i guess they didn't realize it was a dogfish head beer). Sam and team have done it again making a unique beer pushing the depth of stout boundaries in a different way than the traditional coffee, oatmeal, and regular spices."
"Overall: This is a nice, low ABV American Stout. Flavors are robust, mouthfeel is creamy, and the drinkability is high. I can see myself getting a case of this to have on hand for brunch or nightcaps throughout the winter. Chicory either complements the hops well, or makes up a nice unique bitterness on its own. For me it doesn't matter, it has a good, not too sweet chocolate flavor with a nice chicory coffee bitterness to balance it out."
"This one grows on you as you drink it and the finish is medium roasted coffee that is pleasant, although the citrus character carries through to the finish. This one may be good and may be enhanced with food."
"D: It's decent; I could have a few of these. But it's not remarkable. Just kind of plain. Nothing offensive, but nothing that stands out either."
"Overall I was disappointed with this release. It tastes watered down and the flavors are not well balanced. Unfortunately the appearance and smell set the bar high, and the taste and mouthfeel fail to deliver. This was a mainstay in the fridge last winter. I doesn't look to be this year..."
"12oz bottle with a Bottle On date of 10/07/10. Pours a deep, dark brown with very little head. Very little lacing. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, and some molasses. This beer has a great coffee taste. Roasted malt and chocolate flavors as well. This is a damn fine stout with a really good coffee taste. The lower ABV makes it a brew you can easily drink a few of."
"I like a lot of DFH beers, but this isn't one of the more impressive ones. Somewhat dull and monotone in its taste, I wouldn't reach for this first."
"D: A very easy drinker. Tasty, but nothing special."
"The taste is an interresting combination of certainly coffee with an uncharacteristic bitter aftertaste. That must be the chicory, which is often used a a coffee substitute. I find the taste interresting, yet not my favorite. The mouthfeel is good and refreshing, drinkability therefore ok. Nice seasonable approach to brew something different."
"D: This is flavorful and enjoyable if you like coffee."
"Drinkability: I found the Chicory Stout interesting at first, but the astringency is strong enough that the complexity of all the flavors don't get a great chance to shine. Still an interesting spin on a Stout."
"Just below medium bodied, the cola tingling carbonation but it's the same consistency of broth. It would be smooth if it wasn't so empty. Desperately needs some thickness, some staunch character. I'm not motivated to reach for another."
"My first DFH disappointment. I purchased Old School today so the world will be right again with DFH."
"D - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit the coffee is a little stronger than I prefer in my stouts but the smoke made up for it worth grabbing a bottle or pint if you see it around"
"Overall, not my favorite but it's pretty good. I don't know what chicory is so I couldn't say what it added to the brew. Worth a try."
"Pours a very dark brown with a slight mocha head that faded fast. The smell was a nice rich malty chocolate/coffee, but the smell was not very strong. The taste started with a smooth malt smoky coffee flavor followed by a sweet chocolate and a coffee finish. The aftertaste has faint honey notes, just the taste not in sweetness. The mouthfeel is heavy, a smooth beer with nice depth of flavor. This is a nice beer, great session beer, not a heavy stout that fills you up, but still has a nice moutfeel to it. Definitely worth a try."
"What a great smell. Smells of chocolate, rich malts, and some coffee with some herb like smells in the background. The taste is just like this. Very nice rich malts on the front end ending sweet chocolate in the middle and the coffee, chicory and hops all mix in together for an earthy finish to complete the beer. Wow, and its only 5.2 percent!? This is incredible. Finally a Dogfish Head beer that I can enjoy a bunch of in one night. (besides the 60 minute) The drinkability of this beer plus the taste make this an A plus beer in my mind. I love the ending herb like taste that mixes in so well with the coffee. Its so well balanced its ridiculous. The body is also pretty damn nice for it being such a low alcohol beer. If you find this get this and appreciate the balance of what I can say is my favorite stout to date."
"Drinkability is good; this is very much a coffee beer."
"D - Well I only know of one shop that has it, maybe two, but would definitely check out the price of a sixer. Still I still wonder what more ABV could do to this beer (nothing crazy like WWS just maybe a bit more. Was overall good."
"Overall a better than average stout that has a good flavor."
"Drinkability is above average. The beer is interesting if not traditional. It's complex but light and goes down easily. It wouldn't be my choice for a session beer, but you certainly could if you wanted to. As far as a Dogfish Head product goes it's not my favorite, but all in all it's not bad."
"I guess I'm just partial to Imperial Stouts. However, the stouts in the 8% ABV range aren't necessarily ""Imperial"" and I prefer them much more than this offering (Bear Republic Stout)."
"Notes: I find this beer to be very interesting and well crafted!!!"
"On tap at the Gaithersburg DFH Alehouse. This beer may have been helped by the fact that I had enjoyed a glass of the Punkin just prior. Gorgeous black with a 1/2 inch dark tan head that sat like a permanent fixture on top of the glass and laced it all the way down. Slightly coffee/chocolate roasted malt flavor in the nose and in initial taste, but the flavor soon expanded into a myriad of different things that raced across the tongue. Everything was there--the coffee, chocolate, licorice, even a hint of hops bitterness but definitely not hoppy. Roasted and rich and extremely drinkable, this one was a keeper. I'm usually not a fan of beers with a lot of extraneous ingredients (esp vanilla in my stout--thank you Dogfish Head). But the little extras in this one really set it apart in a good way. I'm really glad I tried it and will look for it in bottles, though apparently only a Winter seasonal."
"Pours a black color. 3/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, dry hops, slight alcohol, and wood. Fits the style of an American Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, hint of hops, hint of coffee, hint of spice, and a hint of wood. Overall, a good aroma, appearance, body, blend, and complexity."
"The flavor is nice, and this is actually one of the more sessionable stouts I've had to date, but it falls short of greatness. Could definitely polish off a few though."
"Drinkability - very easy to drink for the style. A very good stout for the price and not that hard to come by fresh."
"Dark brown with a creamy tan head that melts slowly and leaves rings of tan lace on the glass. Dark fudge, coffee, anise and a slight herbal note in the aroma. Roasty coffee and cocoa flavors with something else (must be chicory?) slightly earthy tasting. On the leaner side of medium bodied for a stout with smooth carbonation. A decent stout."
"Nothing makes me want to go back to the fridge and grab another bottle, but I did drain the nonic easily. The grittiness on the front of the palate eventually builds up on the lips. However, scoop some coffee ice cream in this and you might be transported to The Big Easy in a beer float. They should have a beer float in the Mardi Gras parade!"
"Drinkability is good, but it's not a chugger and a something I'd rather have inside while the snow is falling outside, but even on a hot summer day it was nice to try this slightly complex stout."
"All in all a more than solid lighter bodied stout that I would definitely drink again."
"D: Very tasty. I don't know if I really notice the chicory, but it's still a damned nice stout."
"D: There are better stouts out there. The coffee, possibly enhanced by the chicory, comes across as being overly harsh and leaves a lingering aftertaste that wasn't really that pleasant."
"Highly recommended."
"Tastes like coffee, but again without the warmth. Pretty standard stout stuff otherwise, dry and very full. Heavy in the mouth, and its like drinking a sandbox. Just lacks that sweet finish, but it definitely is heavy."
"Otherwise a decent stout, nice to drink but nothing really spectacular."
"D- This is going to be a big hit or miss depending on your preferences. I like it. It's worth a shot for sure. One of those beers that you like but aren't surprised if some of your friends don't. I usually like two of these per sitting, but it's astringency and coffe-centricity kind of limit its drinkability."
"Finally getting around to trying this one after passing it up for too long. Pours a nice black color, with a nice bit of mocha-colored foam. A very aromatic beer, with dark roasted malt, mocha cappuccino, cocoa and heavy cream. Kind of light on the palate, more like a porter than a stout, with some roasted malt flavors, a little coffee and some dark chocolate. Nice and creamy; very nice."
"D - A solid stout that I could drink a few of, no problem. Would definitely buy this one again."
"Pint glass pour and I am met with a dark black brew with a nice beige foamy head. Aroma consists of espresso, toffee, dark chocolate, cocoa and roasted malts. Very roasty, toasty taste with a slight black coffee bitter aftertaste. A little too carbonated for this stout. At only 5.2%, multiples are easy and overall this is worthy of more than a single bottle in a session. Overall I have been wanting to try this for awhile and I am happy with the outcome. A nice easy-drinking stout that stays true to the style. Nicely done."
"Tastes good, a nice take on a stout. Worth the try, and worth having around for its roasty chocolate and coffee balance. Not blow your socks off unique, but very tasty and well crafted."
"This is better fresh and better in the winter, but not too much was lost over the 7 months it was sitting."
"D - A very hearty burnt coffee beer. This one I will go after again if I am ever in the mood for such a brew."
"All in all, very enjoyable, but I felt like I needed a breath mint when I finished."
"D - Great stout, love the addition of chicory"
"D-a very smooth beer that is easy to drink but leaves me slightly disappointed"
"Drinkability is decent. At 5.2% ABV and with a thinnish mouthfeel to boot, this is a very lightweight entry into the world of stouts. I could knock back a few of these in a sitting. After sampling such heavies as FBS and Peche Mortel, the Chicory Stout doesn't come close to their caliber, but is by no means a bad beer. Just not a great one."
"D- Overall a very solid American Stout with tons of great dark coffee flavor."
"Recommended if you like your stouts well balanced and creamy. Not available in my area yet or else I'd probably keep it in the rotation."
"F: Finishes with some dryness, but not very dry. A slight lactose feel on the finish too. A nice smokey flavor lingers for a while, leaving that smoked meat and BBQ chicory flavor. Slight bitterness mostly from charred malts and coffee bean flavors. A really nice campfire beer, which I will have to remember next BBQ."
"Mouthfeel is a little more carbonated than what you'd expect from a stout. A little watery, but not unfulfilling."
"Aroma 5, Appearance 2, Taste 7, Palate 2, Overall 13, Score 2.9"
"This was the first craft stout for me four years ago, and tonight was the first attempt to rate it. I'm sorry that I'm attempting this with a year-old bottle, as I feel that is taking away from my original impression of this brew. Either that or the Russian Imperial Stouts I've had this winter have altered my taste buds :-) I recommend this stout as a must try to all stout fans."
"D: Very smooth, very easy drink and a potential session beer even though it is slightly higher than 5% ABV. Good overall stout."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Black with a tan head. No idea where they got ""bone"" from as said on the bottle...whatever. Smells of coffee and chocolate. Tastes like coffee, with a bite of chicory coming in near the end. Very pleasant all around from DFH...I could see myself drinking this on the regular."
"Pours a medium to dark brown color - one of the lightest colored stouts out there - with decent khaki colored head and decent retention. Smell is of nuts, coffee, chicory with faint earthy hops. Taste is slightly sweeter than nose dictated but containts the nice blend of nuts, coffee and chicory found in the scent. Hops are there, earth, wood, as well as a faint anise/licorice like taste. Medium body, slightly high in carbonation, little bitter and earthy aftertaste. Nice stout, good break from the big bold ones most common now."
"Well, I have had this beer many times before and I truly enjoy it. It pours a very dark amber which has a nice red hue when held up to the light. Its got a small but solid creamy caramel head with a pleasant aroma from the roasted chicory and Mexican coffee. The taste is very pleasant with caramel, coffee and chicory tones, it goes down smooth leaving your mouth feeling crisp and awaiting another sip."
"This beer is on the dark end of the spectrum and can only show amber if shown in direct light. The Creamy beige foam sticks around for quite some making this beer look quite delicious. Sweet chocolate and coffee notes linger in the scent. It actually smells a bit like dark coffee here and there. Chocolate malts please my taste buds for most of the time in my mouth vanilla flavors mixed with coffee appear here and there and especially at the end. The hops are almost non existent until the very end where there are just enough to balance this malty beer. Nice carbonation for this style, but it's a bit sticky and very wet. This may work for you, but it is the only negative point for me in a rather drinkable and enjoyable DFH beer."
"D-with a low abv and a heavy body this body is pretty drinkable and rather tasty but has some contradicting characteristics in this department"
"D: One of the easier to drink DFH offerings, and one of their beers I've been more pleased with."
"Opinion: This is a good beer no doubt. I like the malt complexity the whole way through, and the balance in the finish is masterfully crafted. I like stouts and am spoiled by the Imperials in that I almost expect a ""boot to the head"" of flavor, but this beer doesn't disappoint even though it is a fraction of the OG of some Impy stouts. I am not sure how much I would drink this beer regularly, but I would certainly drink it again without hesitation."
"355ml bottle purchased by my girlfriend at Beer World in Largo, FL. Black in colour with an off-white head and speckles of lacing on the snifter. Smell and taste are roasted malt, coffee beans, and bitter chocolate. A fruity ginger root flavour - which I'm guessing is the chicory - gives off a tart maltiness, followed by a burnt and chalky aftertaste. Vinous, red wine aromas develop on the nose. Mouthfeel is lush, medium-bodied, moderate carbonation, pleasant dryness to finish. Likely the maltiest beer I've had from DFH, but different in a good way. Solid session stout. Beware of the caffeine kick though!"
"D: As it is, it's very drinkable. I'd like to see this amped up a lot. More chicory, more coffee, higher abv. As it is, I think it would make a great, although expensive, session beer."
"D: Nice to drink a multidimensional stout without an ABV to knock down a horse."
"Drinkability: It's not a bad beer, but I really wouldn't want multiple glasses of this. One is enough."
"The taste starts with a little bit of roasted malts and coffee like flavors then transitions into a real unique kind of taste that i can only describe it is it reminds me of the way a beer tastes when it's been oak aged but without the wood taste. I mean by that it gets kind of dry in the middle and sucks the rest of the flavors away. It finishes pretty dry in the mouth despite a nice sweetness up front. It's quite unique and still pretty strong after over a year in the bottle. I am getting some age and oxidation of this beer but it isn't over the top at this point but I do not see it getting any better. I'd say 12 months is a good lifespan."
"IMO, less carbonation would have fixed most of my complaints."
"Love beer, live beer, respect beer"
"Overall, this beer seems very well-balanced. I am enjoying the flavors in here...it's a stout, but one that is unique in that there are some herbal notes coming through...but the flavor is enjoyable. It's pretty spritzy on the tongue, well carbonated, allowing the flavor to linger for quite a long time after each sip."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0912-SeanH"
"This brew pours a nice black with some brown around the edges. A rough pour yields a minimal one finger coffee colored head that looks pretty creamy. Aroma is of chocolate milk, roasted malts and smoke. Taste is nice - I really like it. Starts chocolatey, then there's a brief showing of roastiness followed quickly by the chicory smokiness. My only knock on this beer is it's lackluster finish and thin mouthfeel - if it was only a bit creamier it would be superb! Drinkability is high - despite the thin mouthfeel, I enjoy the flavor enough to warrant having a few."
"The thin body and low abv lend to good drinkability and it's not filling (for a stout.)"
"Not my favorite stout, but fairly enjoyable. Some unique flavors come through, in typical DFH fashion."
"An OK beer, but nothing to rave about."
"Drinkability is great. I could take the entire sixpack down with a smile on my face."
"The color stands throat-deep in very dark brown, with even deeper blacks creeping up the legs. On its head is a cap of light ecru that fades fairly quickly, leaving a galaxy of individual suds and accompanying ring. The scent is roasty and toasty with a slight smokiness pulling some strings in the backroom. The taste emphasizes the toast over the roast and perfectly balances a subtle hoppiness and a meek toffee-and-nuts flavor. Beneath it all, the chicory punctures the crust, allowing an herbal lava to ooze out nicely, settling into a tasty archipelago. Though it feels almost heavy on the tongue and coats the mouth well, it is smooth enough to make the experience enjoyable."
"Nothing spectacular but nothing really wrong with it either. It's a standard, but well-made stout that plays with the chicory and sweeter flavors over the bitter coffee base."
"Drinkability: this is a pretty enjoyable stout. Its main flavor profile is good, but it has some baggage (tart, astringent baggage) of which I'm not a huge fan. I haven't had chicory coffee before, so I'm not well-versed in the flavor, but I feel like with a little refinement this beer could be stellar."
"Notes: Very good alternative to FBS if you ask me and a very fine stout in its own right, of course."
"D: The thing is, I liked this beer but there are better stouts out there that I like so I'm not sure if I'd get this again. I'm a big Dogfish fan and always wanted to try this."
"The body was thinner than expected as well. Light creamy feel on the tongue. Smoky roasted flavors at first, some bittering coffee presence in the middle, and a drying earthy finish. This was a pretty good stout. Not my favorite, but decent."
"Big disappointment."
"Finish: A an exceptional combination of flavors!"
"Overall - An enjoyable seasonal that I wish had a little more complexity to the taste, still good though. I plan to try a bottled version at some point."
"Drinkable at 5 percent, and decent mouthfeel. well balanced brew here"
"D: Quite drinkable due to the light mouthfeel and balanced flavors. For a stout this goes down pretty smooth."
"- Overall its a very tasty stout, but a bit watery... not robust enough. A double of this I am sure would be outstanding. I do however like the salty woodiness in the background. A very nice unique change."
"Drinkability: I liked this one quite a bit at first, but got tired of the burnt and bitter coffee flavor, which surprised me because I really like coffee stouts. I won't seek this out."
"D - Good drinkability with nice complex flavors and low ABV."
"Drinkability: Worth trying - but like chicory, I think this one is an acquired taste. Still, I found it a nice post-dinner treat - like having a coffee after dinner. I think the bitterness of this beer would combine well with a desert after a meal."
"drinkability - what hurts this beer is the taste"
"This beer is creamy, medium bodied, and reasonably complex once it settles for a bit. There are some cocoa powder chalky flavors, there is tons of roasted malts, there are also some charcoal slightly harsher flavors. I'm getting the chicory and the chocolate in balance, with some coffee grain in there too. The beer is fairly low ABV, which is probably a good thing for a complex stout, and easy to drink. There are some bittersweet chocolate notes, the cherry-ish chicory flavors are very subtle. The beer is dry in parts, bittersweet in parts, but with some sweeter malts interlaced. I like it, but some folks might not dig the little bit of this - little bit of that quality of this beer."
"Drinkability: very drinkable beer not super heavy could definitely have a few of these"
"Overall I found it to be almost like a dark session-type beer with the right amount of flavor to go down quick."
"Huh. I mean, it's ok. Weird, usually I think DFH goes over-the-top. Here they didn't seem to go far enough. There's nothing wrong with this beer, just nothing particularly right."
"D: Part of me wishes this beer was a bit more robust. The body in particular could use some heft. The flavor is nice, and this is actually one of the more sessionable stouts I've had lately, but it falls short of greatness."
"CHEERS!!"
"Overall, it is worth a try but not a great stout."
"D- Easy drinking stout. Period. Don't look to this brew if you are looking for something out of the ordinary."
"D - not simple, not too complex, just good."
"D: I was hoping this one would warm on my pallet as it warmed in the glass, but it remained very oaky bitter throughout."
"I didn't love this beer, but the flavor was good. I think it would be great if you like your stouts a bit less intense and with a decently low ABV."
"D - Nothing overwhelming but not bad either, I would have again if was looking for the style."
"a good coffee stout, some thing to enjoy from time to time, its an intereasting brew ..cheers"
"Unfortunately I've never had chicory, so I didn't know what to expect, with that being said though, there wasn't an over abundance of it, because I couldn't even taste it. It must be a fairly subtle hint of it. What you get is what you'd expect, lots of coffee and dark chocolate flavors, roasted malt and what not. The aromas are similar as well."
"D-very easy drinking and if the price point was a little lower I could this being a personal staple in the fridge."
"I like this a lot. Plan old easy to drink stouts are harder and harder to find. Simple, but enjoyable. Something I would recommend."
"D: A drinkable beer, but not DFH's best effort."
"Oddly enough I enjoyed mine with a sandwich made of leftover holiday prime rib, followed by a shortbread wafer and it went equally well with both. Go figure."
"D - As a fan of stouts and coffee, this is one I'll definitely be picking up again."
"D- One of these would be enough, although it was enjoyable"
"Overall, I really wasn't a big fan of this beer. It was just over smoked and took away from the coffee and chicory. I probably won't be visiting this one again."
"I think the chicory needs to be dumped up big time here, then I can love it for both what it should be as well as what it is."
"D= I could have a few and maybe more if I got in the mood for it."
"You know what: this is an underrated beer, IMHO. And I usually go the opposite way with dogfishhead brews. Quite drinkable. Mouthfeel too thin, though."
"Thanks to my good friend Jdostal for this generous hookup!"
"Had this beer from the bottle in a pint glass. This Dogfish Head Seasonal had a great taste, but might be a little heavy for some. You could pick up the extra hops, chocolate, and coffee flavors, but unlike some other stouts, no one flavor was overpowering, everything blended perfectly. GREAT stout, would recomend"
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect pint glass. This beer had a huge foamy head dark tan in color that goes away in about 10 minutes. This beer produces very little lacing to the glass, it slowly works it's way down to the liquid on each sip. It's black in color with brown highlights, very dark beer. The smell is good, clearly has a lot going on. Smell of both chocolate and coffee slight hop at the end. It has a good, but very complex flavor. Like the smell, you can taste both the chocolate and the coffee, malts are also very present and this is well hopped stout. It has a smokey finish. The mouthfeel is pretty good, it's the slightest bit too carbonated, but still a pretty good mouthfeel. The drinkability is good. All in all I like this beer, very tasty and complex. This is good, I'd certainly get it again, in the bottle it kind of tastes like the love child between a porter and stout."
"I poured from a 12 ounce botttle into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours pitch black with a medium tan head. It has a pleasant, not over powering coffee aroma to it. The coffee is a nice backbone for the flavor, but the malt bill in this is a bit light, I find my self wanting more body. The beer started off alright, but is is sort of watery. I liked this the first few sips, but the body is too thin for me to really enjoy it."
"Cheers!"
"d- as hearty as it is, it is still very drinkable"
"The flavor profile leads you on a tour of roasted notes, ranging from rich chocolate to bitter coffee beans, right on down to a bit of sour astringency. A little light, with too much carbonation for my liking, but overall I'm finding my chicory experience acceptable out of the growler. Generally easy to drink, despite the uniqueness of the ingredients."
"Overall this is another great product from Dogfish Head and I would expect nothing less. A very good brew and recommended to anyone out there that enjoys a good coffee stout."
"Of the four seasonal beers from Dogfish Head, I think this is probably my second favorite. Its light and sessionable. The flavor is nice, but doesn't compare to say Bells Expedition Stout. Well worth checking out, but far from great."
"D: One that can be enjoyed with a rich meal, or by itself a strong session beer"
"D - This cask offering was really nice especially if you like black licorice...the addition of the licorice paired well with the stout qualities of the beer...happy I had this on cask"
"D - Overall, a tasty and quite drinkable offering from dogfish. While the body is a bit light, the body and ABV do lend a 'sessionable' quality to this stout. Not the most mind blowing stout I've ever tried, but I would purchase it again."
"Well done with the chicory Dogfish Head. I thoroughly enjoyed drinking this beer, and can see myself visiting it again. While it's not a chugger (with the chicory notes, one in a sitting is a plenty), it's definitely one you will want to drink more than once. So go buy a sixer, and skip coffee for your next brunch!"
"Just pleased to have experienced this flavorful beer. Just a wonderful beer."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, very tasty, I'll take another please."
"12oz bottle into an English pint glass (2009). A straight pour reveals a huge tan head floating a top a black beer with light showing through the edges. The aroma is a lot of stout - roasted barley, chocolates, coffee, and a hint of smokiness. The flavor is nice creamy chocolate with coffee in the background and a nice stout sourness lingering in the back. This is capped with a touch of smokiness but it's blended well with the roasted malts, etc. It's a bit watery, though - kinda thin in flavor and body."
"Good beer to share with family and friends around the holiday months."
"i like this beer and it does have a certain dryness and for me pretty strong dark roasted finish that may ot appeal to everyone."
"Overall Impressions: Very nice, smooth drinking stout. Probably would not be nearly as enjoyable if it was ice cold. Good mix and balance of subtle flavors."
"Overall this is disappointing."
"Drinkability: Solid. This was my third or forth time drinking it at Toast, so apparently I like it well enough. It's not the best stout I've had recently, and it's not my favorite Dogfish, but I have no problem ordering it when I'm in the mood."
"From the 12 fl. oz bottle dated 09/30/09-AB. Sampled on December 4, 2009. The pour is a deep dark brown with a tan quarter inch head. But it is also a bit of bubbly carbonation build up on the lower half of the glass. A pleasing smoky and roasty hopped aroma. The mouthfeel is pretty bold and holds its own on the tongue. The taste is smoky like a bonfire. There is a kind of bitter hop ending. This is quite good."
"Roasted intenseness stops it from scoring top marks in mouthfeel or drinkability"
"D- I would love to have another, i should have bought more. A very light stout that's feel nails the style with a DFH twist of flavor. Total opposite from WWS."
"D: This is an outstanding session stout, glad it finally came to CA and glad I bought a sixer of it."
"All in all, I would say that this is a decent beer. Nothing exceptional, but I would definitely not call it bad. I went in thinking it would be a bit heavier and was surprised when it was actually quite light."
"D - Not my fav. Strong boozy notes overwhelm the roasted flavor and I never like the soy sauce notes you get with high alcohol beers like this. I'll stick with Dog Fish IPA's for now...."
"Notes: Nice seasonal offering from DFH. While not extraordinary it is almost a classic, has a nice touch and always nice to find it every year. Particularly nice on tap."
"Overall, another nice offering form DFH. Not their best, but another solid beer in their lineup. I'll probably pick some of these up each year for a lower ABV stout."
"Worth a try? Yes. Especially if chicory is your thing."
"I could gulp this all night."
"This is a very drinkable, tasty coffee stout. Not the best out there, but no slouch either. Lots of flavor at a reasoanble ABV makes it a good session candidate. I enjoyed this very much."
"M/D - Full body accentuates the rich, sweet flavors. Easy to drink but the distinct flavor can get a bit repetitive so I've been keeping these to one a session and moving on to something else."
"Very little roasted malt taste in this stout, pretty sweet. Not a bad beer but not as complex as I would have liked."
"D- a good brew with tons of flavor. though it may sometimes difficult to have a session with 'exotic' beers, this one isn't so far outer space. i could kick it on this one just like any standard stout. extremely flavorful and enjoyable. and i think the st johns wort has me thinking in a positive fashion."
"This beer is one of the most drinkable stouts I've had...very sessionable. Not the greatest stout I've ever had, but still quite good. I'd drink this again."
"A good session stout. Solid stuff, decent price. Reliable, never had an off bottle."
"Taste is sweet and rich, light carbonation and good fruity aftertaste from the chicory. Decent beer to check out but it is pretty tame for DFH though."
"Drinkability: easy drinking stout, not overly impressive but also not intimidating at all. The best alternative to Guiness and a great gateway beer for guiness drinkers"
"Summary: I like the roasted/earthy flavor to this one.. really sets it apart from a lot of other stouts. Will probably drink this one again if I see it at a bar."
"Overall: Prefer my stouts to be thicker and prefer my dogfish to be bolder but for the mood I was in it fit the bill nicely and went down easily."
"overall a very good stout... yum!"
"Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to those seeking a smokey standard stout with a great nose."
"D - A solid example of the American stout. Right up there with Bell's Kalamazoo for a tasty, lower-abv, drinkable stout. A pity it's not available year-round."
"This beer is smooth, it has a great body, and hits my soft spot for a coffee stout. And for $10 a six pack, it would make a welcome appearance to anyone's night. Excellence."
"The appearance is almost black with a quarter inch head that leaves no lacing. The smell is of coffee, roasted malt, very sweet chocolate, and perhaps im getting a little bit of hops in there. The taste starts off with coffee which is followed by the chocolate which is very sweet and is ended by a hop bitterness accompanied by coffee again. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the drinkability is pretty good, especially for a stout."
"M/D: Has a nice medium body, more like a porter. Carbonation is just a bit on the high side. Alcohol is subtle and makes for a highly drinkable beer."
"This is my first taste of the Dogfish Head brews. I was impressed. Hope to try others soon."
"Living in New Orleans for 3 years I'm a huge fan of chicory coffee. I missed this beer last year and was super excited to get the last 6 pack at Downtown Wine and Spirits. Now that I've had it I'm really, really dissapointed. It's not bad but the distinctive chicory bitter I was hoping isn't there. Maybe I built this beer up to be something it wasn't. Maybe it's not you, it's me. What's the deal Dogfish Head? Did you put out a mediocre stout with chicory and Mexican coffee just to prove that you still have it obscure ingredientwise? I just don't know what to think anymore."
"A nice drinkable stout, tastes sort of wintery and festive. Bonus points for keeping the ABV down; this would be nice to knock back in some quantity if it weren't so expensive."
"Chicory Stout finally found its way into California. Six pack for $12. The pour is black and results in one finger of rich tan head. Fair retention and lacing. Smells of roasted barley, dry cocoa, nuttiness, and some coffee bean. Tastes of some roasted malts, coffee. Some tingly bitterness, fairly dry with a biscuity dry finish. Medium to full in body, fairly high in carbonation for the style, weakening the body. Decent beer, some unique flavors, but nothing too complex. I imagine some people would really like this and could do a nice session on it."
"The head crests at close to three fingers of whipped up, dimpled dark brown foam, the bubbles burst in swift unison, too frothy for there to be much lacing. Very dark brown in color, falls just short of black, touch of metallic orange at the outermost edges. Light roast to the coffee bean and dark chocolate notes in the nose, the chicory a little less obvious than expected, multi-grain bread, not much of a fruit presence, not hops for that matter, texturally comes off as dusty. Medium-bodied, same dry, dustiness pervades the mouth, like if some coffee grounds got into your mug. Dark chocolate as if unsweetened. Moderately more chicory-led bitterness here. Carbonation stays the middle course. As in the nose, no real fruit presence, same for spices, citrus. Solid enough but definitely monochrome. The overall dryness detracts from mouthfeel. Could drink a few in a pinch but wouldn't seek this out again."
"i am a big dogfish guy and i liked this but did not love it. smell was good, mouthfeel was good, but it left me wanting a little more. after each sip i was slightly making a face like...i'm not loving this, but it's dogfish so keep going it'll get better. it really didn't deliver. it was just good not great. it was like i was happy getting through the brew, but i wasn't loving each sip. at times it had some medicinal bite that i can't explain but i wasn't in heaven that's for sure. i would drink it at a party or if served to me, but i won't be purchasing this one anytime soon..."
"D: This is very drinkable a delicious. There are lots of flavors, but nothing is overwhelming. Only down side is that it leaves a lingering sweetness in the mouth."
"D: Very delicious and drinkable. I don't know how many of these I would drink in a night, but I could see this being the go to morning beer, if there is such a thing. Great coffee profile and it stands out among others like it."
"This is a very nice tasting stout. I am not a huge coffee person, let alone having it my brews, but this is a nice sessionable brew. Another solid offering from DFH."
"D- I really enjoy stouts. I have been trying more coffee stouts more. I like DFH...so it was bound to be good. I would recommend this if you like stouts, and especially if you like coffee stouts."
"Pours an extremely dark brown to black with a creamy, tan froth with decent lacing and thick bubbles. Yep...there's the burnt Chicory aroma on the nose followed by roasted coffee, oak (but that's the chicory), dark chocolate, molasses, charcoal, & some subtle hop spice. Although the nose is very dark and burnt, it's very aromatic and pretty. This beer tastes just like drinking a cold chicory coffee. Additionally, this brew has a nice, creamy mouthfeel (you can tell by the leaner body that this is a 5.2% abv beer.), long finish, and would be fantastic to have with dessert after a great dinner...very smooth."
"D: a very enjoyable stout overall. Pick it up if coffee stouts are your thing."
"Gimme' some more!"
"This beer was kind of a let done honestly. I expect a bit better from DFH. That being said I was a good stout, with a different taste. It is defiantly drinkable and the 5% ABV leaves you and your buddy with a empty 6r not feeling a thing."
"Overall, great fall/winter session beer. I buy some every year."
"Overall, easy to drink, not over-hopped or overdone like so many of their beers. This is one of my favorites from this brewery."
"Drinkability: I love drinking this stuff on cold nights, it's the perfect session stout with just enough of a good thing to keep me coming back for more. The coffee and chocolate flavors mesh nicely without zero'ing out the rest of the beer. The low ABV makes this beer easy to drink a 6 pack within a couple hours. Thank god for Chicory Stout on these cold New England nights!"
"Drinkability: This is a decent coffee stout. Its highly drinkable and the alcohol content is lower. A decent session coffee stout for sure. I love the funkiness of the herbal astringencies of this beer but it may be something that puts people off. I can't give this beer a great grade, there is no wow factor, but I'd recommend anyone giving this a try."
"Dogfish's Chicory Stout pulls off the coffee and stout combo perfectly. Seriously copious amounts of roasted chocolate malt beer, roasted chicory, and coffee. You certainly taste the good notes of oat to this beer and balanced with a hop undertone. A excellent beer, recommened for porter/stout fans."
"D - Not bad, not great though. Diggin the low abv on a decent stout though. Nice session stout."
"More carbonated than I really feel a stout should have."
"D- Fairly easy to drink for sure."
"D: I'm happy to sit back a session this beer on any given fall or winter evening."
"Pours deep brown with a slight hint of red, dark foamy head that dissipates into a pleasant lacing. Coffee is prevalent in the nose, with a bit of toastiness. Taste is a very good balance of moderately bold flavors, coffee, malts, a bit bitter but well balanced. It's not a session beer, but very satisfying."
"Drinks pretty good, but this is a fairly low powered stout."
"Smell of sweet dark malts, toast, black licorice. Assertive sweet, rich taste; a strong blast of chicory, coffee beans, bone dry, burnt toast, a lot of sweetness and a creamy mouth feel despite being astringent. I found this beer a bit too astringent at times with an off-beat sourness that made it all a bit less palatable. But in terms of the roasted chicory and organic Mexican coffee bean flavours, this beer is pretty up front and in your face, almost overbearing. I'm glad I checked this out, it's an interesting attempt although not in the same league as many other American stouts I've had."
"Overall, an okay beer. Wasn't really my style to begin with but I surely don't regret trying it out."
"D= This was a decent stout, but I thought it could have used a bit more boldness in the flavor profile. Still, it was easy enough to drink and I could have had another if the time was right."
"D- Carbonation ups the drinkability, making this one a decent session beer. Nothing offensive about this beer, just not as flavorful as I would go for in a stout. One of my more enjoyable experiences from DFH, although that's not saying too much."
"Drinkability - I could not see drinking several of these in one evening, or even chasing one with another, but even after drinking the pint I was not full, nor did I have a bloated feeling that I would have expected with the amount of carbonation in the brew. This was definitely a new style for me, and quite removed from what I have experienced to date and while I appreciate its complexities, I believe the carbonation and the level of hops would prevent me from enjoying another Chicory Stout from Dogfish Head."
"Overall: This beer is great. It is everything I expected and more. Trust Dogfish Head to make a winner."
"drinkability: this beer gets alot of shit. its not the best stout but I think very solid. I always appreciate DFH for trying things different. Anyone can make a regular stout."
"very interesting and drinkable. i actually think this is one of DFH's better beers."
"D: A pretty smooth beer but drinkability is decent, slightly better than average."
"(D)- Being at 5.2% abv, I could put these away easy enough. This is a stout for coffee lovers. Its rich, yet light and sweet. If you really hate coffee, this might not be your cup o' tea. But because of how much roasted coffee is in this guy, I would still label it a sipper beer for sure"
"Easily drinkable, and a deal tasty. Not too complex in its flavor profile, though quite interesting in the nose. Most likely easily accessible to those familiar with stouts, particularly the Foreign Export style. Fairly low alcohol content leads to sessionability. Very nice."
"D: Gentle, pleasant, full-flavored stout. I would buy a six-/four-pack but maybe not order another. Good session beer."
"D: very smooth, easy to Chung this one."
"Overall my least favorite DFH beer by far to date. Not horrible just kind of boring, especially compared to many of the other great beers this brewery puts out. I figured a complex stout would be something they could really pull off well but it wasn't so according to this reviewer."
"No much to say, a bit disappointed by this DFH brew. It is still a good beer but it's also fell on the ordinary side of the stout category."
"D - The standard stout from DFH is one of the core beers I remember from the first fest I ever had a DFH beer. I consider this a highly drinkable coffee stout- one of the best D-ability wise. A must try and I can't say I am a big fan of chicory on its own."
"This is a very particular brew and one that has to be determined by the individual palate. I rather liked it, and the only real issues were a little weakness in the hops (though this is, of course, a maltier brew), that mild astringency, and a little excess slickness on the tongue. It's tasty, though."
"D: Good stout to have with the fairly-low abv, but everything doesn't quite fit together. I'd be interested to know what this one would taste like if it had some of the Palo Santo wood vibe to it."
"Drinkability is fantastic. Reasonably sessionable at 5.2% and damn delicious. A cold weather staple."
"Very interesting beer, not the best coffee stout I've had but the Chicory adds and interesting twist!"
"Overall a very nice brew, and I wish I had a second to follow it and continue to tease out the individual components of that smoked wood flavor."
"Pours a nice dark brown color with a bit of initial tan head (although the bottle promised bone white) and the tiniest bit of lacing. Nice scent, mostly coffee, not even a lot of stout/burnt grains. Good taste, a nice hit of burnt grains, followed by coffee flavors, with a nice hit of chicory and bit of hops at the end. Goes down fairly smooth."
"Drinkability: you might be able to knock a few of these back, but I wouldn't. I just don't like this one and that bothers me, because I love stouts, and I love DFH."
"Very drinkable option."
"This beer pours a very dark brown, almost black with a nice little tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smells of coffee, rum, raisins and chicory. Tastes of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and licorice. The body is on the lighter side with medium carbonation. Drinkability is good. I only bought a single but i wouldn't mind having a few more of these in the fridge. Overall a solid offering from Dogfish Head."
"Drinkability: This is an intense enough stout that one an evening is quite enough. I enjoyed it but will not want another for a few days. You also need to let each sip fade before the next or it begins to be too much on the palate. So allow lots of time to finish this one."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with low carbonation."
"Another great beer from Sam and the boys at DFH."
"Overall a good drinkable stout"
"Well, as much as I like some Dogfish Head beers, this is another disappointment for me. This brewery's experimental beers sometimes make me wish that they would take a step back and not go that extra step. The underlying stout seems good, even the underlying coffee stout seems pretty good. The chicory kind of bothers me. It makes the beer mildly cloying. I actually wouldn't expect this low of an abv, but it come across a bit syrupy rather than big and full. This beer is a long way better than Aprihop, in my opinion, but it's not something that I would buy again. It's an okay beer, but there are some much better stouts."
"Maybe it would have been better with dessert, but the beer itself gets a thumbs up here."
"Overall, I'm not a huge fan of this beer. It seems very harsh and gravelly to me."
"Overall you should probably try one of these on tap or a single bottle if you can. It's good enough for me to order again on its next release possibly but I would go for another DFH six pack."
"D - DFH is typically hit or miss... While the hits normally outweigh the misses, this one is a big time miss... The aroma is pleasant, but this brew falls short in all other categories..."
"D- easy enough to finish, but with all the other great american stouts out there i dont think id reach for another anytime soon. maybe the bottle was just old, but i think i remember liking this one better last year."
"poured into a glass. thin tan head disappeared in about a minute. cherry-black color with little light shining through. smells of roasted coffee. roasted coffee and bitter chocolate taste. tasty mouthful with medium acidity. I could drink a max of 6 in a sitting. leaves a good taste in your mouth well after finishing the bottle."
"D - Very strong flavors balanced with bitterness. Decent stout. Could drink it again, but would have too many in one night."
"The mouthfeel is average. The aformentioned carbonation does what you'd expect as you hold the beer with mouth closed. +0.5 for the roasted lip-taste sensation. I like the taste of this beer, and I'm almost giddy it's ""only"" 185 calories. To me, it's another unique and worthwhile effort from Dogfish Head. I mean--Mexican coffee/roasted chicory! Now only if I had an imperial DFH coffee (maybe oatmeal or maple syrup) production to review...."
"Not a bad beer, drinkable. Not unwatchable like Natalie was to the Facts of life, the facts of life."
"Sadly, I expected more from this one. Especially being from Dogfish Head, one of my favorite breweries."
"A good drinking beer, especially on tap. Very flavorful. Well done Sam."
"Drinkability - I could drink a few of these no problem and look forward to my next experience with a dogfish head brew."
"Overall, very drinkable, but doesn't pack quite the punch I was looking for. The wateriness does it in, otherwise a pretty nice beer."
"D: A very pleasant surprise with a sharp nutty and drying finish."
"This was the most interesting stout have had in a while partly because it wasn't very interesting. There was definately no ""thud"" as the pour hit the bottom of the glass. I felt this was a lighter bodied stout, somthing that I am not used to be offered in the winter months. The lack of distinct smell definately allows the flavor to ambush you. The pour left a relatively indiscript dark brown stout in my glass topped with a tanish head. The first sip is fantastic with no unpleasant lingering of flavor on the back of your tongue. The mouth feel is as average as a stout's could be, again allowing the flavor to be the star. This was a terrific beer that I enjoyed over the several days that it remained on tap. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone for drinking or braising!"
"It comes on subtly, with the bitterness increasing as it sits on the tongue. But this bitterness instantly vanishes with the swallow, leaving no unpleasant aftertaste. In other words, it starts out as a porter, but finishes a stout. A bit sweet, a bit bitter. This beer surprised the hell out of me. A definite recommend."
"It was a chilly night and this beer was perfect."
"Drinkability: While this is not a session beer I could easily drink more than one of these. One of the best stouts that I have had in a long time."
"D: Good to be sure, but not amazing. Something I could drink a few of.."
"Jet black and completely opaque but with little effervescence which prevented it from getting a good mouth feel and developing its overall aroma. Flavors are of unrefined coffee with a light hint of semi sweet chocolate finish. It feels like some it is lacking some flavor backbone to carry the distinct forward flavors."
"D - Other than the thin mouthfeel, this is quite drinkable."
"To me, this is almost an anti-Dogfish Head beer. There's nothing over the top about this creation, just a very good coffee stout. What's interesting is that the malts and hops are greatly balanced so that one is really not detectable over the other. Certainly a beer worth having and it's holding up nicely for being a year old. It won't blow you away, but if you're looking for a good session coffee stout to keep the cold weather out, this won't disappoint."
"Overall: A very drinkable, full-flavored stout."
"Drinkability was good.. but the beer just seemed to be lacking something."
"D- A very enjoyable stout for a slightly unique take on the style. Not too crazy, but just enough to be memorable."
"Taste is of rich chocolate, coffee beans, and some spice. Dry finish, leaves some spice on the tongue. Good feel. Smooth drinker. Pretty light for a stout, but still smooth."
"Note: this particular beer was dropped and may have lost some carbonation. I'll review again with a better sample when possible."
"I love what DFH does and admire their breakage from German purity law. I love most of their beers. Just not this one."
"Very good brew."
"This is one of my favorite Dogfish beers. Not the most complex from them, but it is tasty. If you like stouts or coffee, give it a shot."
"12 oz bottle Thanks to Tayner: Aroma is roasted malts and brown sugar. Some sweetness from chocolate and bitterness from coffee. Pours black but not like tar. Head is large at first but dissapates to a smaller lacing. Mouthfeel is slightly thick with an oily finish. Carbonation is non-existant. Flavor is roasted with some coffee notes, broen sugar is not noticable in the flavor. Some sweetness but the robust flavors from the coffee and roasted malts win out. Quite drinkable and enjoyable. I could actually seek this out again."
"Pretty solid, fairly enjoyable. I would have it again."
"D - This is definitely a beer that I could drink a few of. Very tasty and I will most likely pick up another few in the near future."
"D- Not to bad just not one of my favorites. Would drink again just there's better out there."
"Drinkability: Feels like this should be a higher ABV than 5.20. I can't say I'd have more than one of these...and I don't know if I'd buy it again. It does have a uniqueness to it (probably from the chicory) that does help it stand out slightly, but overall it's just another stout to me. Not bad, but not great."
"Nice looking stout. Dark near black color with a brown head. The nose has sweet roasty malts, subtle hops and dark fruits. The taste also is malt strong with a hint of bitter hops. Chocolate and rich coffee as well. Full body drinks well. Another tasty brew from DFH."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style but is close to being a porter, it's a good beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for a mild coffee-flavored beer."
"I could drink a few but wouldn't want to session this one."
"To me, this is a solid seasonal brew. It's not often you find a stout this sessionable that still packs a good amount of flavor and substance in the mouthfeel. That's what keeps me buying it every year."
"This is an excellent stout, almost more of a cream stout with its' manner of sweetness... tastes as though it could have milk sugar in it, along with the coffee. Well done, solid stout. An excellent session beer, especially for cool, breezy mornings or nights by a roaring fire."
"Off the tap at American Flatbread this brew was a nearly opaque, mahogany color with a tan head. The retention as a collar was pretty good and the lacing in a pattern like torn curtains. The aroma was of roasted malt, nuts, wood and light spices. The flavors were a bit odd, the roasted malt seem to being competing with the spices and herbal hops. Again, wood and nuts but neither was distinct. Mildly peppery. The finish was coffee like and as close to a traditional stout as it got. The body was medium/full, the carbonation semi-smooth and the mouthfeel a bit oily. Not their best work."
"D - I really respect DFH, I can't wait to have more than the little sips I was afforded at the NOLA tasting. This is a great, offbeat beer"
"An enjoyable, unconventional stout in some regard. Is perhaps a tad overly reliant on the coffee grounds and bittersweet rootiness of the chicory, but a good flavor and another good beer from DFH."
"D: Wasn't too impressed with this beer. Drinkability is ok, as there is no alcohol burn. Not a terribly large amount of flavor here, and practically no coffee flavor."
"Drinkability: I could have two to three...I will have this again..The flavor is good and the mouthfeel is exceptional."
"Such a letdown, the appearance and smell are amazing, but the taste and feel are unbearable."
"D: ""strange brew, kill what's inside of you."" Maybe don't go that far but the make-up of this brew is strange and I don't think I will ever get this one again. Just a stones throw down the wrong road, for me at least"
"Eric"
"This is a dry and highly bitter stout. Lots of black patent malt. The body is thin for the style. There's an above average amount of carbonation. The aftertaste is brief, but brings more bitter unsweetened chocolate."
"Very drinkable, If I were a coffee drinker I'd definately switch out some Folgers for this."
"M - Very smooth, but a bit lighter than I would expect from a stout."
"Dark brown pour with a rich but short lasting light brown cocoa head. Nice smokiness to the smell, bringing up some Lapsang Sauchong tea aromas. Faint coffee notes - could be stronger. Taste is the same, a bit of rauchbier smokiness with some coffee taste. Nice medium body, not overly rich, but good. Nice low alcohol and nice tastes make this a very pleasing go to session beer. Had this with smoked oysters and crackers and it was spot on. A staple fridge beer to be certain. DFH really hits the mark with flavorful low ABV beer like this one and Festina Peche. Wish they would do more."
"This is a nice coffee stout that doesn't bash you over the head with complexities. The flavor is mild and simple, but it's quite good. If that's the kind of beer you're looking for, then by all means, pick some up. Recommended."
"Overall, an interesting beer. Some off notes keep it from being better. I'd like to see more coffee."
"This one poured a dark black mahogany color with a whispy tan ring left on top and modest lacing. The nose picks up tart coffee raisin with a hint of charcoal and molasses. The first swig gets a relatively sharp acidic wood with cherry hints and a solid smoke background. It has a smooth malt overtone but the tart sharpness is undeniable. Very decent."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: This beer threw me for a loop. Upon smelling the brew I expected a thick, rich and robust beer. However, when I tasted it I received a beer that was both light in flavor and body. The roasted notes some through with a slight, very slight, hint of sweetness. I would suggest this beer for someone who still wants beer with a fantastic aroma yet not a huge robust and thick body. This beer pairs well with chili (eating a bowl as I review) and I could see it going well with a nice slice of cheesecake or pumpkin pie. I would easily buy this beer again especially if I could try it on tap."
"4.0 D: Smooth and very drinkable."
"Overall, this beer is ok. I would not buy it again. However, I would take one if offered. In my opinion, this is the most pedestrian of DFH brews."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle (Bottled on 12/02/08) and served in a pint glass. This stout poured a modestly dark brown that displayed some nice ruby edges when held up to light. A one-finger thick head of creamy, tan foam settled a bit, then lasted throughout the entire glass. Excellent lacing. The aroma consisted of freshly roasted coffee, caramelized sugar, and a light, herbal/mint note. The flavor also showed a nice, evenly roasted coffee note, followed by caramel, a bit of chocolate, a hint of licorice, and a very mild hop bite at the finish to even things out. Mellow and quite tasty! The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had moderate carbonation. This stout incorporated each flavor evenly, without the coffee overpowering the subtle sweetness. A really nice beer."
"Drinkability: Um, not sure what to say here. This doesn't taste bad, just strong and biting. Akin to drinking straight sour mix from the bar mixers. It is good, but strong, and not something you could drink a lot of. Interesting though, as much of DFH's offerings."
"Recommend: Other dogfish before else."
"D: This guy is pretty damn drinkable with it's lower ABV. The butt of the beer doesn't make me giddy to take the next sip, I probably should just smell this beer instead of drinking it?"
"D: It is drinkable, but I don't think I could do more than one of these in a sitting. My palate would need something else. A very interesting stout."
"On a side note, I'd like to see this as a regular release. Dogfish makes a lot of really ""out there"" stuff that's cool to get a bottle of once in awhile, but that's it. I personally think this would be a great counterpoint to their 60-minute IPA in terms of a ""normal beer"" line. Don't get me wrong, I love dogfish head's crazy stuff, just not 4 or 6 at a time."
"D: Anyone would enjoys stouts or porters would really enjoy this one. Not too heavy so you can't that much, but just heavy enough that it keeps you from going overboard."
" At 5.2, could have a few--Very nice overall,certainly worth a try."
"Pours an inky black body, brown tan head, average and diminishing. Aroma of coffee and semi-bitter chocolate. Heavy dark roasted aroma. Very strong coffee scent. Sweet chocolate taste. More sweet than bittersweet. Medium creamy palate. Some coffee taste. Pretty good."
"very dark and smelled of coffee and malt. The head was one finger and medium dark brown. This beer is smooth and drinks well. There is a roasted flavour which keeps your attention the whole time you have this beer in your mouth. The flavour is hard to pinpoint. There was good lacing on the glass as you consumed this beer. Good beer which I would drink again. Had it in a imperial pint form."
"Tastes of roasted malt and a hint of coffee. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy and chewy, but maybe a bit too carbonated. Not a bad beer, but with the carbonation and a bitterness I don't think this is as drinkable as some other stouts I've had."
"This is the perfect stout as far as mouthfeel and drinkability go. Not too heavy despite the color, medium body and carbonation is perfect. Warming despite the low alcohol content. I could see myself drinking the whole 6er in one night easily. Very good beer here."
"The bottle claims mexican coffee and chicory. The coffee stands out much more than the chicory, although it is there. For a second I thought I was drinking a smoked beer. It pours a tan head that sticks around for a bit, leaving light lacing that is quite sticky. The initial taste is overwhelmingly coffee, almost burnt. Not bad. It feels a bit thinner than I would like, but that is all relative with a beer of this style. I enjoyed it, but would wait a while to buy another 6."
"Pours 100% black, with a big poofy microbubbled head that seems to stick to just about anything. Aroma reminds me of some of my less favorable homebrew stouts. A touch of roasted malt with strong hints of plastic. The body of this beer is the first thing that strikes me. Very very pleasantly smooth with just enough carbonation. A lot of the time I object to this kind of water quality in other beers. I'm always complaining that some breweries don't treat their water correctly for the style but this seems about right for an American Stout but would be way wrong for and IPA or anything. Any chicory in there must be very mellow. I've only had oaked beers before and this is a lot lighter in wood character. It mostly comes out with the roasted malt to bring out some sweetness and round out some of the edges. This also seems radically underhopped for an American stout. Overall, this is a good beer but it's a little too close to my crappy homebrew, which makes me think something is wrong."
"HV"
"Not the most outstanding coffee beers, but it does the job."
"The taste is OK but just no complete."
"Well, it certainly isn't the best offering I've had from DFH but a solid beer none the less. The appearance is the best feature for me.. a dark brown with a tan head, tons of lacing going down the glass. Carbonation is a bit low for me (even for a stout). Almost get a 'stale coffee' sort of vibe from it. But, there are some good roasted type of tastes in there as well to balance it out. Not one of DFH bests but still better than most other stouts."
"The taste consists mostly of an interplay between the roasted chocolate and light hints of black licorice. Somewhat straightforward and simple, but enjoyable. The finish is a bit weak as the flavor just seems to trail off with a metallic tinge. The mouthfeel is less than inspiring coming off slightly thin seeming to exist, but failing to exert any influence upon the beer. Easy drinking stout on this wet and cold December day."
"A touch too carbonated but the body is nice enough. I'm not sure that this really worth more than one of. I will say that it paired excellently with some smokey jalapeno sauce atop some simple, deep-fried tacos."
"You could drink a bunch of these, if you really loved it. I don't, and I probably will never buy this again. It's not that it's bad, but it's average. Which is about the worst thing I can think of to say about a beer."
"D= high because of the consistency."
"Opaque color with a tan vanishing head. Aroma of dark chocolate roast, black coffee, and smoky/peppery notes. Tastes of light sugar cane with malty roast background. Cocoa, chicory, light medicinal notes. A mildly-rich and smooth taste creates a very enjoyable drink for any season. A relatively light body for a stout and lacks the richness that other stouts offer but a pretty good variation. I'm a fan of the smokey traits but it doesn't have the solid body."
"Coffee, java, joe. Thick black body, aroma of light coffee and tad of jalepeno. Chocolate slide with a touch of expresso and a warming set of peppers...a coffee infused with hot chocolate and cayenne pepper? Spice ontop of crisp carbonation, equally balancing for a temperate, exotic treat; and thank god it comes in a sixer and not a four pack...I hate that new trend."
"Not bad, but not the amazing top notch brew I usually hope for from DFH. I'd drink it again, but it's nothing incredibly unique, as there are a good deal of coffee brews out there. Worth a try, but this isn't one I can see myself drinking on a regular basis."
"It's drinkable, but very thin. Overall this is enjoyable, but falls extremely short of the bar set by Dogfish Head's World Wide Stout. Average effort."
"EDIT - Overstated the mouthfeel in initial review. This does lower my score a bit."
"Drinkability is good but, again, being so roasty and bitter, one is enough."
"I hesitated buying a 6 pk and settled for a single at my local Andersons. Now I wish I had more!"
"Drinkability: Pretty high for the style - the co2 makes it go down like pop (that's soda to most of you). Too bad I can't replace my morning coffee with this stuff."
"O - a good stout for coffee lovers like me."
"Future outlook: Not likely to purchase again in the foreseeable future."
"Drinkability: This is a great beer, as I mentioned at the heading of this review. I'm very pleased with it. I've had a ton of luck with the American stouts and feel I've almost been too fortunate with them. I hope my luck continues."
"Notes: It was o.k.,nothing for me to go on and on about. Retool this one and it could be a lot better. It was easy to drink,so worth the try."
"pretty good overall, worth trying if you even remotely like stouts and or coffee"
"On tap. Right off, one has to like chicory and Mexican coffee to enjoy this beer. Pours dark brown, almost black, with no head. Aroma of mostly chocolate, with some coffee, spice, and roasted malt. Strong taste. Slightly smoky, a lot of oatmeal and coffee up front, then the malts and slight hops. The finish is very different. All of a sudden, the beer turns into a chocolate malt and ends dry. This is like no other stout out there."
"I'm a pretty big fan of Dogfish Head. By and large, I think they really hit the mark with their brews. This beer, however, I'm not so sure of. The appearance is good, not quite pure black, but close, with a tan head and good lacing. The aroma is a bit funky though. It's hard to pin point exactly, but it's almost like a blend of dark berries and metal. Usually when you stick your sniffer down into a nice, dark stout, you come out with coffee, chocolate, and roasty aromas. In this one, the fruity, herbal, metallic notes seem to dominate. I don't think I would be opposed to those aromas if they were secondary to the malts, but the fact that they take over leaves me a little dissatisfied. The taste is also a little off. This is a perfect example of a situation where there are multiple flavors, but instead of blending together in harmony, produce a strange, mixed-up cacophony where it is hard to tell just what you are actually tasting. The aftertaste is one of raisins, prunes, and port, which I kind of dig, but then when you take another sip, you lose the mild, semi-sweet dried fruit flavors and go right back into the metallic and almost astringent taste that I'm not a fan of. Now of course this is just my opinion. Some may find this beer very intriguing, (and probably the brewers knew they were going a little off the beaten track adding chicory to the kettle) but I find it a little confusing and not quite my bag. I'm a big believer in a well-rounded, well-balanced, harmonious beer. This one is just a little out of whack for my taste buds. A slight let-down from my usual great experiences with Dogfish Head."
"Taste is of chicory coffee again with a sweet malty finish."
" Reviewing the other reviews, I was worried I may not like this beer, but I found it highly enjoyable. If you like your coffee black and dark-roasted, try this one."
"Pours very dark brown with a small beige head that quickly dissipated into a lacing that lasts. Aroma has hints of chocolate, maltiness, coffee, raisins and other dark berries, smokiness and of course cherry. A mouthfull of roasted coffe up front with hints of dark chocolate and dark fruits. Finishes dry and a little bitter."
"This is a good stout. It has a nice roasty malt flavor. It wasnt too heavy as some stouts can be. It had nice lively carbonation. The chicory flavor was evident. The malt flavor was nice and burnt. The aroma was great, with a jet black color and a bone white head. try it once."
"3.8/5"
"Drinkability- Excellent. At %5.2 you this wont knock your socks off."
"This was just fine, but I've come to expect more from Dogfish Head. Nothing too revolutionary about it."
"A black color with some tanish head. Big coffee in the nose, nothing else comes through just coffee. Taste is just great full of coffee malt not really aggressive rather light and nice. The thickness is good and nice activity. This is a very enjoyable stout, very much worth a try if you ever see it."
"Beer pours a deep deep dark brown, almost black. 1 1/2 inch coffee color head that fades quickly, slight foamy lacing. Scent is strong on coffee, light dark chocolate and malts - taste is truly coffee flavored. Great body, minimal to no aftertaste. This is a nicely balanced stout...though I would dare to say it's more like a porter-stout. If given the chance I will pick it up again!"
"My verdict is that this is a great beer. It is not very stout-like at all though. It tastes like a coffee-porter, same body as well. If you are into porters and dark-roasted coffee, go for it! Dogfish always makes a great brew, so its worth a try."
"Fresh bottling. Dark brown color with a small and quickly diminishing white foam. Not bottle conditioned. Flavor and aroma are very similar, both lacking in elements besides coffee. I know it's a 5% stout, but come on. This beer has so malt depth and no body. Very dry and off balance."
"I poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium Globe. This beer pours a dark mahogany brown with a small inch head that disappeared into just a thin rim around the edges of the glass; leaving no lacing whatsoever. The aroma follows the name. Chicory coffee, straight up front. Reminds me of having a cup on Bourbon Street in New Orleans. Also there is just a bit of molasses and a hint of espresso. The taste is 100% chicory coffee. It's really amazing that the taste is so well represented in a beer. If you like Chicory (and I know quite of few of you don't) try this beer. The mouthfeel is a bit astringent and finishes extremely dry. If you like chicory, which is a acquired flavor to begin with, you will love this beer. If not, chances are, you'll hate it"
"D: It was drinkable, but not in the way that a stout should be. It lacked the richness and filling qualities that make a good stout."
"Not all it's cracked up to be, but still a relatively average stout. The aroma is bitter and has a decent note of roasted malts nothing out of the ordinary. Good initial pour very dark brown with a large head that quickly dwindles and leaves virtually no lacing. Not very full especially for a stout the thinness in the mouthfeel is a real let down. Flavor is relatively standard some strong coffee notes really come through. Other than that this is pretty basic for a stout. Glad I didn't sink $10 into getting the entire sixer."
"D: Not too bad, better on draft than in the bottle."
"Not my favorite from DFH, but not the worst beer out there either. Drinkable, but I have become spoiled by DFH and expect more."
"Pours a blackish color on the pour. No head forms on the pour, only a slight ring develops. Smell is roasted malts and some coffee. Taste is very coffee forward. Very roasted coffee and not too much else stands a chance to make itself known. A pretty decent stout that I'm not sure if it's a regular offering anymore. If so, it's a good regular beer."
"Overall, its interesting for a stout, definitely not just average run of the mill. However, I think the sweetness is a little lost in the bitterness, for many this may be a pro but as far as returnable drinkability is concerned this is a con for me. Very interesting though, again."
"Drinkability: I got this as a single and it's about two years aged. As the flavors are well mixed I'm thinking age has done this well. I could have another as an after dinner drink."
"I like the ""rough"" biting flavor of this brew. Wish I could get it reguarly."
"Overall, fairly drinkable beer. While hitting up others at the pub, this was the one I drank during both visits, and enjoyed equally as a dinner/late night beer as well as starting off a warm afternoon ambling around the beach. A solid, reliable stout."
"Originally reviewed on 8-7-08. I had the pleasure of having this beer again as my first beer of 2010. I am really glad I can get this locally now. A good, flavorful coffee shout that isn't over the top, well balanced, and easy to drink is a good find."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Dark brown/black color with a half-inch light tan head. Smells mostly of chocolate and coffee and a touch of candy. Tastes begins with coffee then some delicate doughy essence and finally a little bitterness. Creamy mouth feel with subtle carbonation. Well-balanced and medium body of flavor. Overall an enjoyable, mild stout."
"Poured a clear brownish black color with 1 finger of foamy tan head. Good retention and nice lines of lacing. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and a touch of citrus hops. Tastes similar to the aroma, roasted malt with a hint of cocoa up front followed by a good amount of coffee flavors. Finishes with some pepper and hops. Medium light in body, smooth with lots of coffee bitterness. Another unique brew from Dogfish Head, very easy to drink, flavorful, and sessionable with its lower ABV for those coffee addicts out there."
"Overall, a pretty solid stout. I might drink it again."
"Smooth with nice carbonation, DFH's Chicory Stout is a nice roasty drink that neither overpowers nor underwhelms."
"One could pass the afternoon loitering with your buddies, and making easy work of several of these bottles. Recommend adding steamed little necks and moist chocolate cake."
"D - I might have a couple of these, but the intense coffee flavor puts me off a little. Would've prefered this brew a little smoother with a little less carbonation."
"I love me a good coffee infused stout. I picked this up for the olde time feel of chicory, it makes me feel like a civil war solder. The look is nice with a medium fluffy head that comes just short of the bone white of the bottle description. The head and look would probably benefit greatly from a nitro tap. The smell is a bit light for the style. A nice strong smell is a hallmark of a good coffee stout. The taste was a harsh roasted flavor with a fruity undertone. The chicory is know for being less smooth than coffee and that comes through in the beer. I have to say that I prefer a nice smooth coffee infused sweet stout ,but this beer is interesting and different."
"Always great to have some DFH. Good stuff indeed."
"Taste is different but not in a bad way. Obviously there is roasted coffee in there along with a nuttiness and bittersweet chocolate. There is also some herbal characteristics in there. There is a slight sourness present. There is a lingering coffee flavor on the palate. A unique and enjoyable stout. Not something I would want all the time, but still good."
"Pours a black color with a little brownish hue when its first poured. A large 2 inch light brown head rests on top and dies down slowly leaving a thin layer on top with plenty of bubbles. Smell is doughy, with a creamy cup of coffee aroma and some sweet malt. Taste is like a creamy cup of coffee, and a punch of a bitterness right at the very end. Creamy mouthfeeling that lingers with the bitter coffee taste."
"This beer seems to have quite a bit of potential, though falls short of a true great. Perhaps a fresher sample would change things."
"Flavor is coffee and roast malt with some mild cocoa flavor in the background. The flavor lingers longe after each swallow. No real hop presence. No hint of the mild ABV. I really enjoy this beer and could drink several of them in a row."
"I love a good stout and this was a good one. Enjoyed this one slightly chilled in my thick Warsteiner mug. Poured a midnight black with a good head. Smells of blck roasted coffee with some chicory and a hint bittersweet chocolate. Tastes of black coffee but was tamed by the bittering hops. Well done Dogfish Head."
"drinkability - Easy drinking beer, enjoyed this. I enjoy anything from Dogfish."
"Not my favorite stout. The first few sips revealed a lot of interesting flavors, but everything just kinda blended together by the time this one was done. And, like I said earlier, if you like some beer with your coffee, this will definitely be your thing, but if not, it will wear on you after a while."
"D: Good drinkability. A big hearty dark roasted treat that may limit multiples but wont disappoint and satisfies to the last sip."
"Highly disappointing effort from Dogfish. It goes down well and doesn't blast the palate so while it could make a good session stout it's just really not worth it. My mouth just doesn't pine for that next sip as it does with beers with more substance. The flavors are diluted outside of the roastiness character in the finish so perhaps this would be a good entry level beer for those foraging into the style, however it is too light for me to want to revisit any time soon."
"This poured opaque black with tan head. It smelled like a typical stout with milk chocolate and earthy malts. It tasted like a standard mix of chocolate and coffee along with soil (maybe chicory?). It was moderately thick with no carbonation, and had a smooth and sweet coffee aftertaste. Overall this was a very good stout, but it wasn't nearly as unique as I was expecting. I'm not sure exactly what chicory is supposed to taste like, but I didn't taste anything unusual in this beer. (It's still tough to be disappointed in a beer that tastes this good.)"
"Drinkability- An excellent american stout, one of the nicer examples of this style."
"drinkability is great. this is an easy drinking brew that has a flavor all its own. wonderful proportioning and solid complexity make this one a notable stout. cheers!"
"Drinkability: I like the chicory in here, but in the end it doesn't really make it that much more interesting than any other well-crafted stout. Fortunately, this is a well-crafted stout itself; a bit too sugary, or rather not hoppy enough. but still perfectly pleasant to sip."
"Overall, this was not bad; however, it was a little underwhelming for me. I expect everything from DFH to really push through and hammer down styles; I was just not so sure this one was really that big of a winner. Definitely worth a try, no doubt, just not as big as I hoped it would be."
"M + D: Not as creamy as I might have thought, but that didn't detract from it in the least. Nice, modest, to keep in line with the other characteristics of it. The shimmer of carbonation adds a nice life to it all. Nicely done, and it ended up exceeding my expectations for it (mind you, I don't really know what those were, to be honest). I will, however, be picking some more up in the near future."
"Probably one of the few DFH beers I could session as the ABV is rather low (for them)."
"Good drinkability. I could put down a 6 of this no problem. I want to bbq with this."
"Pours a nice black from the bottle with a tall and thick tan head that laced the glass very well all the way down. The smell is of nice deeply roasted malts, some caramel, and some coffee aromas. The taste was pretty good - nice roasted malt base which was built on by a nice caramely sweetness and a hint of coffee at the end. The mouthfeel was pretty fresh and pretty smooth. This was a pretty drinkable beer and I would definately get it again."
"Pours black with a short lived brownish head. Smell is coffee, roastiness, chocolate and a smell typical of ""organic"" beers. Taste is roasty, chocolately and coffee like with a bit of a strange, dull and abrupt finish. Perhaps from the chicory? Another interesting beer from DFH, and drinkable, although not a favorite of mine."
"D: A little bit to abrasive to have much drinkability. This is a decent brew, but a little too light and unbalanced to be much more than that."
"Don't drink and review."
"on nitro-tap at the rehoboth beach pub. dark brown/black in color. clear with mahogany highlights when held to the light. nice creamy tan persistent head with lacing all the way down. espresso, molasses, dark dried fruits, and vague spices in the nose. taste starts with sweet dark malts, also nutty and some soft spice, with a softly roasty, drying finish. mouthfeel is light bodied, somewhat thin, and quite creamy. stouts are not my style but i could have had a few of these were it not for the randall."
"Overall, its a solid and very drinkable beer."
"D: Not bad, not amazing, but I'd drink it anytime its around."
"D: A slow drinker and just OK. There are better stouts; it just felt soft."
"Overall... yeah, not a bad stout. The chicory adds some interesting note. But not exceptional. I certainly wouldn't turn one down, though!"
"I think the drinkability is decent, although I would personally grow tired of the abrasive, ""higher than most stouts"" carbonation as well as the persistent coffee flavor. It's a good stout though and has good flavor and balance. If you like darker beers, give it a whirl!"
"Overall--a distinctive flavor, and I appreciate the effort at creativity by the brewer. Worth a try, but there are better American stouts out there, and wouldn't be something I'd go try to have again."
"Another solid offering from Doghead. This brew pours a deep black which shows off no hues. Head is tan and very creamy with some thickness. The brew itself isn't all that thick. Aroma is chocolate and coffee with some molasses. Taste has a roasted character (likely the chicory), a nice chocolate flavor and some coffee beans to lend to the bitterness. Very smooth and drinkable. Not a lot wrong with this brew. Not as good as some of DFH's other brews, but very solid."
"This is a tasty, luxuriant, but flawed stout. Certainly worth trying, and I could see buying it again, but not on my A-list of American stouts."
"Dogfish Head hits on just about everything, but I'd have to call Chicory Stout a miss despite the high marks for Appearance and Mouthfeel. Maybe that's why I haven't come across it until now."
"Has a heck of a head to go with it black body and a smell of what I guess is chicory. The taste is overwhelming of chicory too, blocking out all the other tastes. I can honestly say it wasn't the tase I was expecting and its not a taste I enjoyed personally, I guess I don't like the taste of chicory. The mouthfeel was medium to lite bodied. I couldn't drink more then one, but mostly because of the taste, not the mouthfeel or alcohol content (at 5.2% this isnt one of their heavier beers). I'll be sticking with stouts minus the chicory from now on."
"Good stuff from Dogfish, but I've definitely had better... Still worth a try..."
"D: The excellent taste of this and lighter ABV from typical Dogfish Head brews make this one easy to drink. One could find themselves drinking many of these in one sitting."
"Pours a nice dark black. Rocky and brown head is nice and slowly breaks down to a very nice lace. The aroma is amazing, very different and the chicory is up front. The taste is coffee and has a sweet burn sugar taste, hints of chocolate as well. It's a light bodied stout which is good if you want more then one. The flavors got much more complex and better as it got warmer. I like it -- good stout -- recommended."
"Nice light mouthfeel for a stout. Flavor coats the mouth but the beer isn't syrupy. Very drinkable."
"I really like chicory flavor reminds me of cafe dumond from New Orleans. The mouthfeel is med.body not much to it. The drinkabilty is good to me I like coffee stouts and this one is low alcohol making it easy to drink several in a row!"
"This was a really interesting beer.. full of all kinds of unique flavors. I read the ingredient list as I was drinking it and it contained mexican chocolate, coffee grinds, and St. John's Wort. I could definitely taste the chocolate and the coffee and the bitterness of the St. John's Wort. This is a unique stout that is definitely worth a try."
"This stout was easy to drink but, I don't know, maybe I expected more. It's good-not great."
"D- This is a unique brew that is made with chicory and St. John's Wort, but I would have never known that in a blind tasting. It tastes like a basic American stout, with a little more emphasis on coffee flavor than most and a slight hoppy kick. The ABV, mouthfeel, and cascade hops make this a very enjoyable brew."
"I purchased this from Camp Lejeune liquor store at $7.99 (I think). They had 2 or 3 more 6ers."
"d: Easy drinking. The coffee/chicory combo is interesting, but the end result is nothing special."
"D: This is an easy drinking stout that I would have no problem drinking a few of."
"Poured into a pint glass. Dark in color with a hint of light coming through which revealed a deep red color. Tall frothy dark tan head which slowly dissipates. Smells of coffee and chicory with small amounts of chocolate and licorice. Tasted very strong coffee and the roasted chicory which comes off stronger than coffee itself. Hints of sweet chocolate with the smoky roasted flavor sticking around. Very well carbonated which helps spread the flavor and lets it flow through your mouth smoothly. Great mouthfeel and drinkability. Didn't taste as strong as I had expected but a great one to keep coming back to."
"D - A very drinkable stout..I found that I drained the glass rather quickly"
"Over all I highly recommend this one to any coffee lover."
"d - this stout has a great flavor. As far as price and taste and availability go, this is one of the best stouts I have had. I'm not entirely sure what chicory is or what it tastes like, but I will definitely be revisiting this one. My first dogfish head. Great first impression."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkablity: Very interesting and unique brew. Enjoyable and satisfying."
"Pours clear medium-brown with red edges., Insignificant head and minimal lacing despite a hard pour. The beer smells of dark-roasted coffee and burnt toast with pine needle overtones from the hops. Perhaps a touch of lactic acid at the extremes. Tastes mellow and grainy at first blush. Rounds out in the center, with rough charred coffee bean and chicory notes. Light and highly carbonated body. Rather drinkable, but a bit unlovely and hardly a proper stout."
"Tried this on tap for the first time at the Tap House in MD and they served this a tad too cold (also). Litte head or lacings, but a dark, thicklike black body. The coffee malts really hit the nostrils, and there are little hints of cocoa and nuts. A very smooth coffee-tasting stout for a beer; a tad spicy and warming, but not very complex. I wouldn't mind having a couple here and then. Not bad for what being listed as the winter seasonal."
"Fun! So dark, real nice carbonation, although little head. No typical dry stout bittering at the end at all. Smells like a nice coffee brew, and tastes great. I used to drink chicory coffee, so this was a nice brew to find. You can best taste the chicory tones at the aftertaste. I like this one a lot, probably the best 'java stout' I've had thus far."
" I would consider this beer a good choice for those who like breakfast for dinner(or breakfast for breakfast). Maybe some bacon, side of grits and biscuits and gravy. Really nice."
"D: Very drinkable. Would not make a bad session beer which is weird considering the style and how big the taste is. Very dogfish."
"overall, not a bad coffee stout. I would probably grab a bells product first. give it a try."
"D - Quite drinkable for a coffee stout. Aromas and flavors are much more subtle than, say, Founders Breakfast Stout, resulting in a more accessible brew."
"This is one of the first stouts I've sampled and so I can't really compare this to other varieties. However, I was a bit surprised by how thin this beer tasted based on the color. In a glass this beer is solid black with a little bit of amber when held to the light. The head is thick and grayish tan in color. The scent smells exactly like roasted coffee beans. There are notes of smoke and charcoal as well as a dark chocolate sweetness. The taste is very similar to the aroma. This beer tastes like carbonated espresso with its signature bitter finish. This flavor is not altogether unpleasant but, to me it was not very drinkable. I probably wouldn't drink this one again, but it might work as an post dessert beer to conclude the evening."
"Slides out of the bottle like light olive oil; yields sizable foam from regular pour. White (faintly tan) head like snow atop a ebony mountain; exits in a hurry and leaves no lacing whatsoever. Coal black even in direct light. Nose is coffee w/cream and general roasty-ness. Grains, chocolate, coffee flavors up front. Oily yet somehow crispy mouthfeel. No detectable hop presence; an odd combo of flavors afoot that bewilder and gratify the taste buds. Finishes with faintly acidic, medicinal, black coffee bitterness in an abrupt finish that begs for another sip. Easy drinking. Another wholly unique brew from DFH."
"d- could drink a bunch of these, would love to have this on tap"
"Overall, I enjoyed this brew, but honestly, it's a stout, so how much CAN you really drink at one sitting? It'd make a great session brew to share with friends."
"Drinkability - Ehhh. So-so. It is pretty easy to drink, but this has got to be my least favorite DFH I have tried. It might be easy to drink, but why would you, when there are so many other great stouts out there? If this beer had a bigger body, a bigger flavor, it would be a lot better. I won't turn one down if it was offered to me, but I won't be searching this one out again."
"D: Bitterness from finish isn't as persistent as smoky, coffee flavors are. I enjoy this, not the best coffee stout, but easier to drink than most and unique enough that I enjoy when I want something lighter (in comparison). I think I actually enjoy the aftertaste more than the actual beer itself."
"I'll give DFH a lot of credit for coming up with something unique without doing the whole 20%ABV and 400+IBU thing. This one could be considered a session stout as well. Recommended."
"It pours a deep beautiful black, capped with a cocoa powder colored head. It leaves a nice lacing in the glass. Roast coffee beans in the nose. Flavors of roasted malt, coffee with a tinge of bitter chocolate, also some smoke. Smooth and creamy. Very drinkable. I believe this would be unbelievably good cask draw. Overall another winner from the guys at Dogfish Head."
"Chicory pours an impenetrable black with a nice fluffy head, dissipates fast though. The nose is very coffee and wood filled. the first tastes are clearly of coffee and some earthy woody flavors. There is slight vanilla and a little bit of a smoky flavor in the middle. The finish has a slight hop bite, but could be better. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and slightly overcarbonated (IMO) In the words of the beer nuts guinea pig, ""its tickly"" Quite drinkable, would be a good breakfast stout."
"This is a fantastic tasting stout. It's refreshing to have a Dogfish Head that doesn't try to whack you over the head. Those beers are nice, but it's this type of beer that proves what a brewery is made of. As expected, DFH passes with flying colors. The smoky sweetness mixes perfectly with the bitter coffee bean and subtle hop inflection. Unfortunately the mouth was just a bit too thin and too carbonated for my liking. It improved as the beer warmed, but seemed a tad watery for this type. Still, I could drink this all night. A quality brew from DFH, even if it's not a crazy high ABV."
"Big fan of Dog Fish Head, but this is one of their ""weaker"" products, literally. As good as the World Wide Stout is, this one is just fair at best. This beer has great color, a great smell, but is way too watery and thin for my liking from a stout."
"Yet another winner from Dogfish Head. It pours an opaque sable with a very thick tan head. Aroma is not strong but ""stouty"" - smoky and with a strong coffee undertone. Flavor is smooth, smoky with a good tang and hints of molasses and coffee. Finish is pleasant, coffee-like with just a touch of hop bitterness."
"D: Definitely a drinkable beer. Good roasted taste and aftertaste with a near perfect mouthfeel. Definitely a good example of a stout."
"D = Definitely drinkable but not my favorite of the style or from the brewery. Could definitely have a few of an evening though."
"This is an OK beer, not spectacular and a little below the other offerings from DFH. Still worth a try."
"Have never really found this to be my thing. Have not had it for 5 years or more so decided to try a six pack again. Deep, dark brown color-not quite black. Small cocoa colored head. Moderate aroma of roasted malt and a slight coffee tinge. Somewhat vague flavor-ok roasted taste. A hint of chicory-sort of mocha like. Slightly burnt bite in the finish. Average body-sort of thin for a stout. Pretty average all around for me. Some DFH beers I love-others I just cant get my liver wrapped around. This is the latter."
"Drinkability: The slight twinge of astringency takes away from the drinkability. I would prefer to have more sweetness. This beer is NOT BAD... It's just not GREAT (in my humble opinion)."
"I like it. It definitely fits the bill for a smooth, easy-drinking stout, but could use a little more flavor to put it over the top."
"Pours the standard American stout black with a light brown head -- but not much of one. It rises to about a finger and diminishes in seconds to a ring. Fairly weak aroma -- not as pungent as I'd expect, but some faint dark-roasted coffee notes and not a lot else. Taste is a vapor of coffee/chicory beans wafting from the mouth to the nose with some astringency in the finish that tastes similar to the bottom of a cup of Maxwell House. A little bit of chocolate on the palate as well with a moderately creamy undertaste. Mouthfeel is pretty thin and watery. An easy drinker at 5.2, but really, who wants to? Nothing terrible, but certainly nothing to go out of your way for."
"Taste is charred meat, extremely roasty, chicory, smoky, malty, hop bitterness in the finish to balance everything out. Finishes pretty dry, perhaps a little too carbonated for the style. This would go great with any BBQ dish. Enjoyable."
"Pours almost a jet black color with a light tan, thick head. The aroma is of roasted coffee, malt and chocolate. Tastes very burnt, in a good way of course. Definitely notice the roasted chicory. It has a medium body and a good finish. Nice beer and very drinkable."
"D- What it loses in mouthfeel it makes up for in drinkability, mainly due to the creamy texture and sweetness mentioned above. It's low (for Dogfish) alcohol by volume also makes this a great ""Homework Beer""- a beer I can easily enjoy in moderation while studying or taking care of other responsibilities around the house."
"Nice, different, well done. A stout I will definitely try again"
"The first thing noticed in the flavor is coffee and a roasted malt tinge but with things like St. John's Wort and liquorice root added to the brewing process it's not the usual things expected in a stout's taste. Neither of them stand out in front but, along with the chicory, bring interesting balance between bitter and sweet. This medium bodied brewed finishes dry which is where the cascade hops and chicory really shine through."
"pours very dark brown almost black with a dark tan two finger head with a nice layered lace to the finish. strong sweet aromas of roasted malt and coffee. sweet roasted malt up front turning to burnt coffee and bitter chocolate ending with a chicory after taste.thick smooth mouthfeel and good carbonation that holds and does not fade away. great beer but a little to rich for a session beer for me."
"D - This is one of my favorite stouts. I've also had it on tap and it's even better. If you get a chance to go to the brewery, go and drink all you can."
"Drinkability: It's pretty heavy, so only one at al time for me. Definitely recommended. Will seek this one out again. Nice one DH..."
"Overall- This is a very sweet, creamy, enjoyable stout. However, it is just average to me. I am used to DFH going overboard and pushing the envelope a little more than this. For that reason, it is a little bit of a letdown for me. This brew they made on the conservative side which makes it an average stout to me. Nice offering, but I really wish they would have pushed it a little more."
"D: A run of the mill stout with an interesting twist. I'm not sure about session beer, although 5.2% would allow you to have a few. Would make an amazing hangover brew. I could see it being absolutely perfect with some fried eggs, maple links, and 'garbage plate' hash browns. I should do some ""research"" and find out if this is true :P"
"D: Could drink this all day long really (and by all means why not start every day off with one as you get the coffee/chicory flavor with it too)."
"M: one knock would be an over carbonated but i can live with it"
"I want to drink these all the time I think, but the price might prevent that from happening."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was black as molassess with a thick nice tan head chcolate head. The smell was of roasted coffe or burnt nuts. The taste was thich but just wonderfully balanced between a coffee stout and a hard porter. I really like this beer and will buy again soon I hope."
"The dark brown body was capped by a three finger thick head. The smell was coffee like as expected, since chicory is often used as a filler in coffee. The taste was much different than the smell suggested. There was a roasty bitterness here, but it was quite subdued, and was matched by a chocolate sweetness. Quite light on the palette for the style, and soft in texture. Easy drinking and approachable, but had it been a little stronger, it would have been far more memorable."
"D - an enjoyable stout, but by no means amazing. I'd have another in a session. Might as well give it a shot if you haven't."
"D: Not a horrible stout, but expected more, probably would recommend to someone as a beginner stout, hope to find chicory stout where smell and taste come through a little stronger."
"Served in my Maudite tulip. Bottled on 10/26/2007. Poured with a tan colored head that dissipated into a thin skim with a ring of foam lingering around the perimeter of the glass. Color was a dark, opaque brown, almost black; with red highlights in the light. Presented with a smell of malt and coffee upon opening. Once poured, released a subtle smell of chocolate. Coffee was somewhat masked by an earthy/smoky flavor. Mouthfeel was somewhat watery with a little bit of astringency, although not really due to the alcohol content. Drinkability was average at best - better representations of the style out there."
"This looked interesting--how can they take garbage and make a good garbage stout out of it (chicory is nasty stuff)? They couldn't. The beer was thin and offensive, like when I roast my coffee beans past dark and brew charcoal espresso. None of the good. In fact, it's hard to find the decent stout buried under the additions. At least it isn't vanilla flavored."
"Drinkability- Overall this isnt the best Stout Ive had but it is interesting. Seems that some of the flavors dont meld well together although thats not the worst part. The mouthfeel is way to thin and just horrible for a Stout. Worth a try but dont be expecting a world class Coffee Stout."
"M/D: Good full creamy body. Drinkability is pretty good on this as it is just a solid brew through out. Overall a pretty good stout in my opinion and one that I could sip or pound depending on the occassion."
"This beer poured a dark opaque brown with a creamy two-finger tan head that didn't last too long. It smells a bit like coffee and roasted malts. The taste is definitely very coffee-like, although I'm not sure if that's the chicory or the ""organic Mexican coffee"". There is also a bit of chocolate taste and some roasted maltiness. Either way, it's really quite tasty and I'm surprised there isn't as much hops bite as I expected. It's very drinkable for a stout and the mouthfeel almost feels like a soda. This is a good beer and is definitely a step away from the norm."
"D: This is a great stout, and one of my favorite DFH seasonals. It's tasty and sessionable."
"If you like stouts you will have to agree and find this one a winner."
"Pours a black color with a little brownish hue when its first poured. A large 2 inch light brown head rests on top and dies down slowly leaving a thin layer on top with plenty of bubbles. Smell is doughy, with a creamy cup of coffee aroma and some sweet malt. Taste is like a creamy cup of coffee, and a punch of a bitterness right at the very end. Creamy mouthfeeling that lingers with the bitter coffee taste."
"Pours black tinged with brown and with a nice initial head that fades to a thin cap and ring. Some okay lacing. The smell is dry and roastywith dark roasted coffee and a light herbal bitterness. The taste is similar, but deeper than the aromas. Deep dry roasted notes, herbal and coffee bitterness, and a piney note are all there. Mouthfeel is chewy, but not big nor particularly creamy, instead its very dry. Pretty tasty. The chicory lends a note of nutttiness and the hops are a little more present than in other coffee stouts. Those qqualities combined with the drynesss make this one a little diffferent and probably more suitable as a companion to many savory dishes. Nice."
"Purchased a case to bring on home with me- good stuff. Look forward to enjoying with variety of desserts. Odd at first following the World Wide but a nice match in hitting a variety of stouts."
"This reminds me of a lower alcohol version of Worldwide Stout. Rich and roasty like a stout should be."
"I first purchased this stout on a suggestion from my brother. Purchased in 6 pack bottles. Dark, smoky appearance. Small head which disappeared as the glass emptied. Good aroma and very good flavor. I will buy this beer again when I am able to find it locally."
"Dead black beer, with some lighter brown highlights around the edges. One finger of tan head that dissolves down to a thin tan film. Aromas are nice: lots of roasted malt, light coffee. Not too complex, but tasty. Flavor is strong on coffee malt up front. Very light dried fruit. Light sourness and a mildly bitter aftertaste. Stronger brown sugar flavor shows up as the beer warms. Fairly full body, solid carbonation. Overall, this one's tasty, a solid stout. Another good effort from DH."
"D- Heavy feeling only for exp stomach stout or dark coffee fellow."
"Complex, interesting, drinkable. Nice stout. Maybe nice isn't good enough. Exceptionally good stout (remember, I had it on tap - my palate is alway a bit happier with draft beer),"
"Pours jet black with a tan head. Aromas of a sweet malt and coffee. In the taste, coffee, sweet malt, and the alcohol is present here, I know it isn't that strong, but it is in here. In the mouthfeel, big on the palate, with a sweet coffee aftertaste, and small hop end too. I think the coffee gives the a special something. Thanks to the bartenders at DFH Brewing and Eats, add a shot of DFH vanilla vodka to it, flavors are incredible."
"D- It is a decent stout. I wouldn't go after it but if I happen to run into another bottle I wouldn't mind it."
"The taste is of caramel and roasted malt, some vanilla and woody notes. Further sips give me a bit of chocolate and a wee bit of fruit and sharp bitterness just before the finish and the finish itself is semi sweet. This is a good taster and easy to drink and it has a smooth mouthfeel and the carbo is light. All in all, a solid American Stout that should please most palates."
"D- Quite drinkable. I enjoyed that quite a bit-- more refreshing than the thick,. heavy stouts I'm used to."
"Pretty drinkable and overall an above average stout. For being a DFH brew this is pretty tame (which is not a bad thing) and falls neatly into the style."
"D: This is an excellent beer, very flavorful, would get this again for sure"
"D - Pleasant beer with a lot of flavor. It lacks the thickness that I associate with a really great stout, but that allows it to be more refreshing and easier to drink."
"Drinkability - this is a very good stout, and utterly sessionable."
"Medium body on this one. Slick, almost watery mouthfeel with a slightly astringent prickly carbonated finish. Flavors are a muddled mix between soft spoken baker's chocolate notes, coffee and other toasted malt notes. Flavors are almost an afterthought following the initial bath of bitterness. Drinkability is ok, but mostly because of the minimal mouthfeel. I was expecting more from a DFH product. Certainly not bad, but quite average for a stout."
"D: Pretty good. I could drink a couple, but then I would have to switch to something a little hoppier."
"Served to me in a standard pint glass. It's deep black with a slight tan head that fades away, leaving mild lacing. Nose is malts and chocolate. taste is a bit more complex, with heavy malts but also some black licorice and coffee. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both decent."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, little fizzy tannish head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is smoky, malty, and lots of caramel. The taste is malty, slightly smoked, nice touch of caramel, with a nice bitter/dry finish. Medium body. Drinkable, I like this one, true to style brew."
"Poured black with a small brownish head. It smelled sweet and had a roasted barley and coffee aroma. It has a coffee, licorice and smoky chocolate flavor. This is a really smooth stout. It is well balanced and I could definitely sit down and drink a handful of these."
"Overall, I love DFH brews but, I'll have to pass on this one."
"Cheers."
"Dogfish has some pretty amazing beers. This one goes down just as well as their other ones. Only it does not seem so over the top as many of their beers can be. This one is more down to earth and sets a tone in the stout style. It actually fits the style. Great mouthfeel, roasty aroma and good lacing in my glass. The head is darker than white as the other reviewer noted. Not sure why they say that either. I'm glad I got a case of this. Stout lovers will not be disappointed with this one. Very Drinkable. Recommended."
"Pours a deep black with a dark tan head (I'm not sure why dogfish says the head is ""bone-white"" on the bottle). Smells like roasted meat, malt and maple sugar and a little yeast. Taste is nice and roasted but not bitter at all. Really suprised at how mellow this stout was. Everything was well balanced and the taste is deeply roasted and sweet without any of the acrid taste you sometimes associate with stouts. Has a great mouthfeel; I could drink three in a row no problem. In general, a wonderful beer and surprising stout."
"Poured black with ruby hints and a minimal 1/4"" tan head that quickly dissipates to just a sporadic coating with next to no lacing. Smells of roasty sweet malts and slight bitterness. Tastes nice and matly upfront. Deep roasted malts with some coffee and accompanying bitterness. Finish is somewhat lackluster and lacks the intensity of flavors that I initially experienced. Mouthfeel is ok, body was fairly thin for the style. Drinkability was fairly good. This is a nice easy-drinking stout but the beers weak finish detracts a bit."
"This beer practically oozed out of the bottle  thick black with a small creamy head. The initial aroma is sweet with a hint of smoke. The taste is malty with the coffee flavor quite apparent. The flavors blend well in this and create a smooth taste. The mouthfeel is thick and a bit chewy. This is a really nice stout!"
"Very dark in color, blackish/brown in appearance. Smell is of strong roasted malts very coffee like with a Low hop smell. Medium bitterness, full bodied mouthfeel, with no aftertaste. Smooth going down. A very thin light brown head with very light lacing down the sides of the glass. Very good in overall drinkability. One of the better stouts available, will drink this one again."
"Good drinkability I really enjoyed it. The moderate alcohol level makes it higher than some other stouts but still low enough to drink several in an evening."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Imperial pint glass. Appears a deep dark brown color, letting the faintest beam of light pass through. There is a good inch of dark tan colored head that lingers for a few minutes. No lacing to speak of. Smells of roasted, caramel malts, coffee, dark chocolate, and a wisp of smoke. Tastes of roasted coffee beans, bittersweet cocoa, and a mild raisin note. A notch or two below medium in both body and carbonation."
"A delicious stout, but I'm not really seeing how the chicory benefits it or stands out. It adds a little bit of a coffee/earthy complexity I guess. Pretty interesting and drinkable."
"12oz brown bottle bottled 4-20-2006 purchased ACCIDENTLY as part of a six pack of 60 minute IPA... But I figured I'd take this oportunity to review it instead of returning it as it's being discontinued. Dark brown/black body with slight ruby-red highlights and almost no head to speak of. Smells like toasty malt and coffee. Tastes like burnt malt, chicory, and coffee in pretty much equal parts. Fuller in body. I like it better than I remember, though it reminds me more of a porter than a stout. But I'm not sure I'm so keen on the addition of chicory. Doesn't mesh with the other flavors as well as it could IMO. Good stout, but not the best."
"Poured into a pint glass. The color is dark like black coffee. I hesitate to say pitch black because there is some light shining through when held up to the light. The head is huge, maybe from a poor pour? The head also sticks around for a long time and is sticking all over the side of the glass. Smell is big on coffee, chocolate is there, too, but subdued. Not much to it, actually. Taste is nice and roasty - lots of coffee & chocolate, maybe a little hop bite as well. Mouthfeel is thin/too carbonated - needs more creaminess. This is tasty, but nothing special - I come to expect more from Dogfish. Not bad by any means. Recommended."
"Another winner from DFH...can't believe I've ignored this one for so long."
"D: Probably not one I'll get again. Bland and boring for the 'stout' style with an underwhelming use of coffee bean adjuncts. I only question whether freshness was an issue...reagardless, the one I tried did nothing for me and is not a beer I'd recommend...which is too bad, because DFH is a brewery I respect and typically enjoy what I've had of theirs..."
"Mouthfeel is good and fits this beerstyle. Drinkability is also good."
"Cheers!"
"D: A very drinkable, delicious stout, with few areas to improve upon"
"A decent looking beer when poured into a pint glass. Coffee black with a small tan/brown head that fades very quickly, which laces throughout the drink. Smells of chocolate and nuts. Tastes malty with light chocolate, some nutty taste, lots of malt and some coffee. A nice little stout, a nice little change from my usual London Porter. Easy to drink after dinner."
"Found this to be a pedestrian offering by Dogfish Head. Boring. Poured dark mahogney with nice head. Little taste up front, little in the middle or behind. Slightly silky mouthfeel but this stout has nothing interesting about it and nothing going for it. Boring, never again."
"Thanks for another good DFH brew MuenchenerKindl."
"This is a fine stout by a fine brewer. The Dogfish uses the chicory to perk up this ""stout"" (in my mind it is like a beefed up coffee porter but who cares. It is creamy and rich. Not a beer you would have on a warm day. It is a little heavy for mowing the lawn but makes a nice winter warmer."
"D- This beer is an interesting concept but it is pretty one dimensional in flavor."
"Pulls in tastes from a bunch of different directions. A fun beer."
"Drinkability was moderate. The viscosity made this an easy-drinking beer but the moderately bitter taste and disappointing finish made for a less than ideal drinking experience."
"the mouthfeel is a little spritzy in the beginning, but the flavors kick in. though i would expect richness from a stout, it's not a rich beer. it is, however, definitely a stout and does boast some sweetness"
"Tasty but not terribly distinctive."
"Dark amber cola brown with only slivers of light around the edges. Solid frosting of cocoa brown head looks like it wants to stick around. Fine by me! Nose of dark fruits, tannic and tart vinous notes. Roasted chocolate campfire. Chocolate licorice sweetness. Smells quite good. Roasted bitterness up front. Light coffee, mostly chocolate. Veers towards tart and vinous fruits. Molasses residue with maybe licorice and tobacco in the finish. Overall, a little tarter than I like (think raspberry dark chocolate). Medium-bodied, smooth feel. Better than I remember (it's been a couple years), but not overwhelming or phenomenol."
"Poured a very dark brown, could barely see through it when held up to the light. Light tan head that seemed to disappear quickly. Felt slightly syrupy in the mouth, but not overly thick. First obvious flavor is the coffee, although it was less mild than the smell lead me to expect. Slight taste of chocolate as well. Maybe it was me, but the flavors seemed to get stronger as you get to the bottom of the bottle. I'm not a big stout drinker, but this went down fairly easily, not a bad choice for the coffee lover."
"cheers."
"Despite all complaints, it's a nice beer and very drinkable. I'd happily enjoy it again if I were in the mood for a dry stout or porter, even if I wouldn't make it a fridge regular."
"D-a nice drinker, kinda lowish on the ABV, so I could probably session it"
"drinkable?: nope, not for me. it is to weird tasting."
"Pours deep dark black with a small light tan lace. Aroma is somewhat bready very dark roasted malt, chocolate and fresh brewed coffee. The coffee really dominates the taste as well. Taste starts of with roasted coffee flavors that make way for small subtle wave of sweetness that finishes with an almost out of place bitterness. Mouthfeel lacks in overall depth and body. Overall, this is a decent stout that ultimately lacks in balance and depth. I am glad I tried it, but I won't be rushing out to get more."
"Pours a deep, pitch black with very subtle red hues around the edges. Moderate layer of cashew colored foam rests on top, which eventually settles to nothing more than a ring around the glass. Coffee sweetened with dark fruit in the nose. Taste is a sharp, yet light, coffee and molasses at the start with the earthy chicory coming out in the finish. Some chocolate in there somewhere too. Mouthfeel is odd. Its a bit chunky but smoothes out to an easy drinker. Could easily drink a few of these in one sitting. One of DFHs better offerings, in my opinion."
"Its good, and oddly refreshing, but I would probably opt for over stouts given the chance in the future. Its just too toned down."
"Drinkability: An appealing concept, but this brew just isn't for me, I guess."
"Poured in to a glass. Pours easily with a thin tan head that disppeared quickly. Dark rich amber, almost light coffee color. Smells of a rich roast coffee beans. Mouthfeel average, not too thick for a stout. Flavor - good smooth stout, hint of chicory, then finish with a hint of a roasted strong coffee. Somewhat dry finish. Overall very good though I'm used to huge stouts so when I was ready for the next level of flavor to hit I was somewhat disappointed. Would be perfectly happy having this with a good dessert as it's not overpowering, just right."
"Poured into british pint glass. One inch creamy head developed at the top, but dissipated fairly quickly as I drank. The smell is of coffee & malt. Taste is great with toffee and coffee notes. Went well with a blueberry crisp and vanilla icecream that I had with it. The mouthfeel was great, not too much carbonation and very smoot. Overall this is an excellent stout."
"A very rich brew with lots of flavor. I would think of this more as a desert beer rather than something i'd want to session."
"A great flavoured stout. What I enjoy most about it is that the coffee flavour doesnt dominate the beer like many other coffee flavoured beers. Many of the others Ive found you can only taste the coffee beans, its like a cold coffee rather than beer. This on the other hand, I find, has the coffee contribute to the beer and lend it a nice blended flavour that maintains its beer intergrity. Aroma is a little meak, but overall this beer is excellent. This would be great as a standard stout of choice"
"The mouth is medium-bodied, lighter than I was expecting, nor as complex. It's dry and grainy on the finish. Overall, it was decent, but not as well balanced or as bold as I would have liked."
"I am from New Orleans and chicory is commonly used in our coffee down here. Chicory is a root that when grinded down into powder is added to coffee for its bitterness and preservative qualities. I have always been impressed with Dog Fish Head and when I saw that they had a Chicory Stout I just had to try the beer. I had this one out of a 12oz bottle and it pours near black in color with a light tan colored head. The taste is wonderful and has a coffee/espresso note. I found that this beer improves in flavor and drinkability as it warms up a little. I recommend taking one out of the fridge about 5-10 minutes before drinking so that it is not as cold when served. I was very impressed by this stout and highly recommend it to anyone. The only reason that I rated the drinkability as a 3.5 is that I personally feel that the unique flavor of this beer is captured by drinking only one bottle....one evening I had two of these in a row and I found by the second bottle that the flavor was not as enjoyable.Overall, a very good and unique stout! Cheers!"
"D - I guess this style is like a coffee stout, but there is a nice crispness here and easy drinkability with this one. At 5.2% abv I could definitely see drinking a couple, even though this is not my main session beer style. I like that DFH doesn't have to blow everyone's mind to make a good, solid offering as well."
"I found the texture to be a little lean for a stout. Perhaps this is more characteristic of the American Stout style? The carbonation is just enough for my taste."
"Petes99 recommended this to me I like it a lot and would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy drinking stout, maybe to those who think Guinness is a bit too bitter. Nice stout (not too bitter) with a bit of coffee flavor. Not too heavy, either. I'll certainly buy it again. Nice work, Petes99."
"Pours with a nice frothy tan head; dark brown liquid with an ambient orange glow at the perimeter. A sweet smell of vanilla, caramel, and chocolate balanced out by the hint of floral hops. Taste starts out with a dry bitterness ushered in by dark chocolate, coffee and hops, then moves towards buttery and ends up somewhat medicinal with molasses and a vague sour note in the finish. Carbonation is a bit sharp on the palate. A worthy session beer if nothing else."
"Drinkability: It's a bit heavier than your garden variety pale lager, but still very drinkable as stouts go."
"DA: At 5.2% abv this should be a highly drinkable stout but it is hindered by the sour and bitter dominated flavor."
"I'd be good for a bomber of this at a time. I was fortunate to pick this case up for under $20 as it was 'expired'. I say the age did nothing but warm and mellow the flavors."
"D: Prett decent stout--worth a try if you can get one. Not going to blow you away---pretty solid."
"All and all an excellent stout. Quite flavorful, thick tasting, and refreshing. Worth a try!"
"This beer is likable in the moment but forgettable over the long run. I love a good flavored stout but this one does little for me. Have I become jaded? Would this beer have rocked my world four years ago? I really wonder. Maybe all the praise (well-derived of course) for DFH has skewed my reality of this beer (I dont think so). Like Ive said, this is a good stout but it is nothing Id seek out. Sure, Id drink it again but I can say that about thousands of beers. Average isnt charming. Nevertheless, I need to thank either hoffman or RedHaze for the bottle. Sorry, mates I cant remember who gave it to me. Both you guys rock."
"The unique and powerful flavor of this masterpeice may not appeal to everyone, but for coffee and chocolate lovers like me....this is heaven in a bottle"
"Overall it was a good beer, slightly out of balanced maybe but good. With so many great stouts out there, I doubt I will revisit this often but I'll give it another whirl down the road."
"I found this one fairly disappointing, having enjoyed so many of the other Dogfish Head beers that I've tried. Appearance is jet-black, with a one-finger head that is anything than the ""bone white"" described on the label - definitely more tan in color. Some lacing. Smell was weak at first, but improved as it warmed: roasted coffee, chocolate, and a hint of smoke. Taste is predominantly roasty, little in the way of hop character, with a distinctly smoky character that a friend said reminded him of bacon - not a descriptor you often hear for beer! As for mouthfeel, full body and good carb for style. Drinkability was moderate."
"Not a tremendous brew, not very complex. The flavours get offensive after too long, and leave a ground coffee bean and grassy bitterness in my mouth as a reminder. Although, it answered the question: what does chickory taste like?"
"Drinkability: A sessionable and enjoyable Stout, it would be nice to have this available locally. Thanks to Lrrr for the bottle from These Go to 11 BIF."
"Chicory Stout: ""A rich, dark brew smoothed out with a touch of roasted chicory and organic mexican coffe. The goodness beneath a bone white head."" Chicory is used as a substitute ingredient for coffee. It has been grown since the Middle Ages and contains 'inulin' which is used as a sweetener and can be converted to fructose and glucose."
"I was unsure of what to expect with this one. I can, however, report that I was very pleased, indeed. It poured absolutely black, allowing NO light to pass through. Head was about a finger thick and lasted all of 30 seconds or so. After it faded away, it left sticky, sand coloured lacing stuck to the sides of the glass. Looks wonderful. There's is no question the there is coffee present here. I'm not exactly sure what the chicory is, but there is certainly a faint burnt wood aspect to the smell, as well. I am very pleased so far. Taste starts of with bitter chocolate and coffee beans, and then turns sweeter toward the middle. It then seems to finish rather abruptly with a certain dryness to it, where it deploys the burnt wood flavour in your mouth. A bit light for the style, I thought. Overall, however, quite good."
"A nice drinking stout, always a good choice when in the mood."
"Black with an short off-white head. Smells of roasted grains and a bit of coffee. The taste was initally overpoweringly bitter. I ventured further and got more complexity out of the bitter grains, as well as the coffee/chicory. If you're looking for a dry and bitter stout, look no further. At a glance the stuff just tastes burnt, but it really is wonderfully complex and refreshing. Mouthfeel is a bit dry, and has a bit of a champagn feel. Drinkability is medium/low, despite the average abv, mainly because it's just so robust. Overall, a real nice stout."
"NOT YOUR AVERAGE STOUT. Normally I like my dark beer strong, and this ones not but it doesn't matter. The beer is very dark in color with a white almost mother of pearl head. The beer tingles as it goes down, it has an almost champagne quality! unheard of in a stout as far as I know. It is a bit spicy and has notes of coffee, goes great with a chocolate desert. It is also a very refreshing beer with a medium body, it goes down very easy. This is a dark-horse unconventional stout as far as I'm concerned, try it out!"
"As for the chicory...what the heck does chicory taste like?"
"D: Not bad. The finish wasn't the best at first, but I probably didn't let it bloom enough before drinking. The beer was nice after it warmed a bit, but it's still your basic stout, chicory or no. But it's a cool, rainy day in the northeast, and this did the trick."
"I like chicory in my coffee, and I wanted to like it in my beer, but I'm not impressed. The aroma offered more than the flavor, and the depreciation is notable. And the staccato nature of the flavor makes it a challenge to drink, so it's not a go-to stout by any means. I'd drink it if given one, but I'm not going to buy it again. I don't know if it's the chicory, but this one is just better than mediocre, and I want better than that from DFH."
"Huge, thick body, like a Grade A amber maple syrup."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth, creamy sweet start, bitter finish, while the roasted coffee notes stand out."
"Not a bad beer. I love stouts, but this is not my favorite. Still, its a decent beer, worth trying. I always feel that any DFH brew is worth a try."
"poured bottle into pint. dark coffee color with light colored head that fades quick. aromas of coffee, chocolate, and malts that are pleasent to the nose and well balanced. taste was rich and smooth. creamy texture. could'nt see my self drinking alot of these due to heaviness of stouts. but this one was the first of dogfish head brewery's long list of beers that i have tried and i look forward to trying more."
"D - Good drinkability. Tasty stout."
"Medium to thick body with a touch of slickness. This is a stout that I can drink more than one of...since I don't really enjoy the strong coffee flavors...but two would probably do it for me."
"Pours a dark, roasty brown, like coca cola with a fizzy tan head. Not much retention as the head quickly fizzed away. Looked more like a porter than anything. Lacks body and mouthfeel is dominated by over carbonation. Aroma of roasted malts, coffee and cringing sourness at the end. I didn't particularly enjoy this beer at all. Something is off about this beer in the aftertaste. Not recommended."
"The more I drink this the more perceivable the off flavor that I taste in the finish bothers me. This isn't a terrible beer but could use some improvements."
"Overall a pretty decent stout, I was hoping for more and was slightly dissapointed with it. Worth trying but not a favorite."
"This really is one of the most enjoyable stouts I have tasted in my young beer tasting life."
"Medium body, low carbonation. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Very well balanced. I think this could be sessionable, especially in the winter time. Will definately have this again."
"D - Due to the lightness of this stout, I would say that you can down a few of these. Though I don't know if I would reccomend it. Its a decent beer, but really not what I had in mind for a chicory stout."
"Pours a mostly black, but not opaque color. Head is short lived, cappucino color. Aromas are rather bland for a stout, coffee, roasted malts, a little bit of chocolate and ripe fruits. Flavors of coffee and roasted malts, lacking the complexity I expected from DFH. A fairly dry finish, some bitterness from malts but nothing from hops come across in terms of flavor. My biggest problem is the carbonation level which I found to be way too high. This really gave it too much of a bite, lightened the body too much and just ruined the beer. Drinkability is fine for a stout, though halfway through I was bored and would not need to try in the future."
"The color at first appears jet black, yet somehow you can sense that it is just very deep mahogony (even though holding it up to a light produces onlly the faintest hints around the corners). Head is foamy, mocha colored and and quickly backs down to a thin sheet with a nice thick rim. The smell is quite nice, with heavy chocolate notes and rasins, mixed in with the burnt malt and the slightest bit of hops. The taste reflected the smell somewhat, though it seemed much flatter and a bit too thin. There was no prevailing flavor on the front, and the back seemed a bit alcoholic, though it wasn't enough to consider it offensive. The aftertaste opened up a bit, with some tangy yet bitter malts seeming to come through in the vapors. A pretty run of the mill taste. The mouthfeel was very nice, with tons of pleasant bubbles up front and a beautifully thick and warm feeling on the back of the tongue. Definitely worth drinking, though not the best of stouts"
"Lightly roasted coffee and chocolate on the flavor, but again a lot milder than other stouts. This one aims more for balance and drinkability than over the top flavor, which is always a nice change. A good stout, and a very drinkable one."
"Pours the darkest of browns. Thin tan head, with decent lace. Aroma is of dark chocolate,roasted coffee,and malt. Very nice. Body is medium,with some carbonation. Taste is of smooth rich coffee.It's on the light side,but quite good. Evenly balanced.and very refreshing for a stout. Another winner from Dogfish Head!"
"Body seems a bit thin and overall lackluster. I was expecting much more from this. A little disappointing."
"Pours a velvety black with some brown ink highlights. A light, creamy brown head emerges but doesn't last long amidst this coal colored liquid. The aroma makes me think of ""special"" brownies. But not your pothead friends ""special"" brownies. Like a brewers special brownies, with a whiff of espresso. The taste gives more definetion to the aromas. A bitter baker's chocolate brownies mixed with herbal, strong hops and a shot of Starbucks liquer."
"This beer poured a very dark black with not much head or lacing. The smell was roasted malt, coffee, and slightly chocolate. Taste was same as smell with a good smooth mouthfeel. Of the Dogfish beers, this was what a I expected: a top-notch beer. I was a bit worried about the chickory, because I tend to not like coffee with chickory, but it worked well in this beer."
"A nice all around beer and unique for the style. Recommended, as I would any Dogfish beer."
"Pours a black color with nice white head retention. Right up front are aromas of iced coffee, caramel, espresso...very satisfying. The coffee flavors come through in the taste as well with a slight hint of milk chocolate. Starts off very nice and flavorful, yet still seems to sort of fall on its face towards the end, with not much lingering taste to accompany how it starts. On of the high points about this beer is that even a non-stout lover could probably sip this and enjoy its light to medium body. Not bad by any means, a very user friendly stout that is nice for a quiet afternoon. Worth a try for sure."
"Bottled on 03/16/06. Dark chestnut with a thick, manilla head. Aromas of medium-roast coffee with slight chicory chocolate notes, nothing overly-impressive. Chicory is much more noticeable in the taste, with a malty chocolate sweetness struggling to cover over a dark-roasted bitter finish. Missing the slight earthy hop presence I love in American stouts. Medium body, slightly carbonated mouthfeel, initially chalky but soon rounds out to a mellow smoothness. Easy enough to drink, a good, but certainly less-than-great stout."
"An OK brew..not one of their better ones."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. The body is a deep deep brown, almost black color with a medium thickness tan head with very good lacing on the glass. The aroma has some definite and pleasing notes of coffee and cocoa. The taste was led by the coffee notes and also a sweet chocolate balance. The roasted malt backbone was also pleasing and had a touch of hops to round things out well. As the body is kinda big, this makes for a good after dinner drink."
"Deep, reddened black with a thin, creamy beige head. Sweet, dark coffee aroma - smooth. Chocolate malts, burnt coffee, hops, finishes with a little sourness. Astringency is somewhat disruptive. Nice and creamy in the mouth though its thinner than it should be. Still, a good stout."
"Bottom line: a good stout from the boys from Delaware, but not a revelation or anything."
"Drinkability- Nice for after dinner, not a session beer for me."
"This is a perfectly enjoyable beer, but leaves one wanting more taste in the drink, rather than a general mild stout/coffee background of burnt notes."
"Not crazy about a stout this carbonated and it leaves it somewhat thin. The lower alcohol makes it a drinkable type of stout if you can get past the carbo."
"Overall, I have had better examples of stouts. This is not a bad example, but not my favorite either. I will probably have this again on occassion and I would reccommend that other try it, especially those that think stouts are ""too dark, thick and heavy""."
"Did not impress me at all. Not bad from DFH but I wouldn't get this again."
"Taste; chocolate and coffee flavors come out right away, followed by sweet malts and some nutty flavors. There's hardly any hop bitterness to this at all. I'd have to say this is a failry mellow, but still enjoyable stout. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but that probably helps with the drinkability."
"Drinks okay, but I expect for from this brewery & for $9 a sixer. Not reccomended at this price"
"I enjoyed this stout very much. A nice rich flavor that wasn't overpowered by a high ABV."
"Overall a very drinkable stout and recommended."
"It pours a very dark brown, with about an inch tan head. It smells like roasted coffee with a hint of oatmeal. I don't really know what Chicory smells like, but I think it's similar to coffee. After an initial coffee bitterness, it tastes like chocolate and roasted malt, with a slightly sweet aftertaste. It has a light/medium mouthfeel, with a small amount of carbonation. It has a good mixture of bitter and sweet to it, and it's enjoyable to drink. I'd recommend it to others to drink, it's a pretty good stout."
"This is an ok stout, but I think I prefer mine a little sweeter and more complex. Its certainly different and a good try for coffee lovers."
"Very smooth and drinkable for a stout."
"It pours nearly a black (if not black, then very dark brown) and aroma is that of a burnt/roasted coffee with malt. It goes down much lighter than I expected, but the taste is refreshing...definitely mocha. I think I am used to the higher ABV from other DFH brews. The Chicory Stout is refreshing, and while it's not in my top 10 American Stouts, I'd pick one up again."
"Dogfish Head Chicory Stout pours an almost jet black with only the slightest hint of ruby at the edges and has a tan head. Coffee like aromas emit from the glass. Taste is also very coffee like (I've never had chicory before, but I am aware that it was used as a substitute for coffee). Aftertaste is a little funky for a second or two, but not enough to bother me. I like this beer, I generally like coffee like flavors in stouts. Well worth trying."
"Enjoy this one - Cheers."
"D - Chicory stout isn't amazing, but it is enjoyable. A light refreshing stout. Easy to drink and enjoy. I have had it before and likely will have it again."
"Very Dark. Rather dark head that started big, but dwindled away. Little lace on the way down. Flavor was a touch thin, but was still drinkable. Different flavors; smokey, somewhat nutty, a little coffee maybe.. a strange sourness that may explain the thinness. Glad i tried, but will not be on my list of regulars."
"A must try. MK"
"Drinkability: Decent but not very interesting; the sour finish detracts from what otherwise is rather enjoyable"
"D - A unique stout. A beer I would definitely try again but just a little too much smoke and carbonation for my liking."
"Like many other DFH brews, this is reverent to the style but also unique and full of character."
"D - very tasty, but the bitterness lowers the drinkability"
"Fairly well carbonated with a medium to full body and a sticky finish is not unpleasant but it brings the drinkability down some. Overall, not really a very impressive beer. The flavor that is there is nice and very well balanced, but it needs more all around to become anything I would seek out."
"Overall, it's not bad - more above average than average or below, but they could have made improved it by making it a little less complex, less watery and a little more focus on the chicory/coffee taste."
"Reviewing from a bottle but also had one on tap at the brewery less than a week ago. Pours a deep black with some ruby highlights. Head is a big dissapointment, nothing to speak of. To really be a top shelf stout i think a beer has to have a big thick foamy head. Smell of rich roasted coffee. Taste follows suit with some background notes of nuts. Nice mild bitter aftertaste. Nothing special to note about mouthfeel but maybe not as creamy as i would like. I nice drinkable stout that i would return to. It's not storm king but it's worth a try."
"Body is good, with a decent body and somewhat active on tongue. But in the aftertaste there is this bitter funk that settles in the back of the mouth that kind of just ruins everything. So, I'll bring this home and share/trade it with people who want stuff from far off lands, and not have to do this again."
"Tastes include coffee, molasses and hints of licorice. I need to remember to keep more of this brew around."
"Drinkability: It is definitely a beer to enjoy."
"D- differently one of those brews that you must take your time on. Take to big of a sip of this one, and you'll have to pause for a breather. Tastes unique, not something that i'll keep in stock in the fridge, but maybe something i'll desire again one day. Unique enough to recommend any stout lover to try."
"Thin red brown body with a short lived, carbonated head. Aroma is almost all coffee with just a pinch of nuttiness and smoke. Flavor has no distinguishing chicory, however, tons of roasted coffee and some vanilla and banana notes are present. Dry but unbalanced. Too thin and not very exciting."
"This is rather middle-of-the-road in terms of body, though for a mid-level brew the flavors have a nice length and subtlety to them as well. The smoothness makes for easy drinking too. This is one of my favorite DH brews--highly recommended."
"A medium mouthfeel with a good deal of carbonation on the entrance, and a thin almost watery finish."
"Interesting stout from DFH. Pours near-black with a decent head that dissipates quickly. Nose is chicory-intensive, with roasted malts and rising dough backing it up. Flavor is pretty tight on the tongue, and opens up a bit upon swallowing to a coffeeish taste with a semi-creamy mouthfeel. Like most DFH beers, this one is interesting but not necessarily all that drinkable. It's more intellectual than it is inviting. I'm almost done with this six-pack, and when I am I doubt I'll be buying this again... but I'm thankful for the learning experience."
"Not really that appealing or drinkable. A bit disappointing from DFH."
"Overall: A very good stout; recommended."
"Jet black in color with a beige colored half inch head. This beer smells thick with hints of coffee, nutty, and a slight bourbon smell. A definate taste of coffee. Very smooth and no aftertaste. Suprisingly light for a stout. Didn't seem too big on carbonation. A highly drinkable beer. Wow, I'm impressed with my first taste of Dogfish Head. I look forward to many more."
"Served on-tap at Sunset Bar & Grill on March 13. Poured a dark midnight brown. Slight white head. Nose was of fresh brewed medium roast coffee and cocao powder. Flavor was all blended. Macho coffee tones with a bit of cream. Lots of roasted barley and even a bit of oat-iness. Very full body, really streches out the taste buds. Slight bitterness from the roastiness."
"Mouthfeel/drikability: This is fairly well carbonated for a stout. That makes it very drinkable for me, it just feels lighter. Medium bodied for a stout and does not hit the stomach too heavy I love this beer it is excellent!"
"Overall not bad, and I might buy it again if I saw it, but definitely not something you'd want to drink too frequently."
"This beer is more the color of a porter. It has a tan colored head. The smell is herbal and slightly of alcohol. The taste is roasted roots. I can taste the similarity in this to the chicory found in salads. It comes through well in this beer. The mouthfeel is fair. The roast flavor lingers in the aftertaste. I could drink these again. This beer reminds me more of a porter. Another good offering from Dogfish Head."
"Tangy-bright mouthfeel, medium-full body."
"This was a mildly exciting beer. It was a black color with a coffee-colored head. The odor was all dark chocolate and coffee. It tasted like black coffee with a little chocolate and hops in the background. It was smooth and rich, but I think I expected more from it."
"This beer pours a dark brown almost opaque with deep red highlights and a decent sized tan head that doesn't lace but leaves a little film the whole way down the glass. The smell is mostly a mix of dark chocolate and coffee roasted malts. The taste is primarily dark chocolate and coffee along with some faint hop bitterness but unfortunately this is a little weak on the flavor. There is a good thickness and carbonation. Overall it is a drinkable beer. This is a good stout but a little mild and not very challenging on the palate."
"Drinkability: very very good, well worth a nightcap drink. best stout this year easily."
"Dry and warming, this is a solid if unexceptional winter stout."
"Poured opaque black with a 1 inch head of ""bone white"" color. Smell is light and creamy , with fresh roasted coffee , slight chicory , bit of herb, and slight chocolate. Taste is of the organic coffee ,some dark chocolate , bit of roasted maltyness , and just a tad bit of hop bitterness from the fuggle and cascade. Mouthfeel is smooth with very light carbonation, slight dryness and a light tart-wheat aftertaste. I find it to be very quaffable. I also like that they include a bit of oats in their grist list."
"finish is long and dry"
"Verdict- It's certainly one of the more interesting stouts I've had. The sharply herbal flavor in the finish isn't usual for the style; it's a little much, but I like that they're thinking out of the box with this stout."
"Overzealously carbonated and too thin for the rushing hop-oils and rubbery biting coffee roast tastes. Maybe good for iced coffee fans? The first let down i've ever had from DFH, but still much better than most breweries which is either a really huge complement to DFH (intended) or a major diss to most breweries (also true)."
"Notes: Once again DFH makes a beer very different from other beers in the style. However I think this one falls a little short after being very promising on the eyes and the nose."
"Another good effort from DFH, I still prefer their IPAs to the specialty brews."
"Excellent beer craftsmanship, as expected, from Dogfish Head. I'm not usually a fan of chicory or coffee, but this beer is unexpectedly yummy."
"Drinkability: not too strong, with a nice mellow aftertaste: I could take at least a couple of these."
"This beer poured a dark amber color with a thin creamy head. The aroma was malty with some light coffee scent. The flavor was of medium bitterness, smooth, creamy, yeasty like fresh dark bread, mild coffee flavor and a variety of spices. I found this to be a very drinkable stout."
"Drinkability: One is enough. This is not an offensive brew, but I like my beer to tast like beer, or stout to taste like stout. If I want coffee, I will go to Tim Horton's."
"12 ounce bottle. Dogfish Head Chicory Stout pours out a nearly black color with a large tan head, which fades to a thin layer of foam after a couple minutes. The aroma is mainly chocolate and coffee. Sweet coffee flavor, but missing the roastiness that I expected, which leaves this beer a little too sweet. The finish is brief and unmemorable. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, and the carbonation is too low. Just an ok stout, but worth trying at least once."
"I've heard great things about Dogfish Head, but this is a big disappointment."
"This pours out dark black with a nice lightly tanned head. It never pours tall or strong, but it lingers and keeps the small halo of bubbles around the edges of the glass I have come to love. It smells a sweet stout with a strong, bitter chocolate like aroma. It has a different taste than I expect. Not really deep in complexity. There is a strong chocolate aftertaste. The flavor at the beginning is different. I have never had any chicory before. It isn't earthy really. Maybe it is a little woodsy tasting, sort of a coffee bitterness. Not the most exciting stout I've ever had but it is decent. It has a mouthfeel that is just a bit too watery and light for what I would expect. It is a fine beer that I wouldn't feel bad trying again, but it just doesn't have anything that makes it special."
"Taste is a little sour, with subtle notes of mocha. Not terrible, but i've had better. Extensive carbonation make the mouthfeel of this brew a little difficult, but not unbearable. It's drinkable, This is not a horrible beer but it's not something I'd go out of my way to get again though."
"Body is barely medium, not as hearty as I recall it being. Overactive carbonation gives it a fluffy mouthfeel."
"Has a bite with some malt and hops evident, but it does battle with the chicory/coffee flavor. The coffee was very prominent and, not being a coffee drinker, was an interesting experience for me. I liked it though. Definitely a good stout. I could drink this beer again."
"Cheers!"
"Dense black in color, this beer pours with a nice tan head, certainly darker than the ""bone white"" listed on the bottle, but if that's the biggest problem here, I think we'll be just fine. The smell is roasty with notes of coffee, chocolate (extremely subued and something else I can't identify, perhaps the chicory? The taste is also interesting and similar to the smell... coffee, chocolate, roasty notes and perhaps chicory? The mouthfeel is a bit heavy, though not chewy or syrupy... seems about right to me. Drinkability? I'd have another, and perhaps another... this six-pack won't last for too long."
"Though its not the most outstanding stout out there, it is one of the smoothest. Makes a great session beer and, while there really isnt that much hop presence, the bitterness of the various burnt flavors nicely balances out the sweet malt and grain flavors. Recommended."
"Overall, this a decent session stout; I imagine that it pairs very well with chocolate- and coffee-flavored deserts. Worth checking out."
"I appreciate the uniqueness, but I dont know how often I'd buy this. Definately something to try at least once. Should go nice with a heavy meal."
"Pours opaque black, with mahogany highlights. A dense, light brown head will hold a one finger head and leave some sticky lacing. Roasted barley and chocolate malt nose, with baker's chocolate hiding in the background. The taste is very sweet, coffee and chocolate, with a strong roasted character and an almost smoky flavor as it warms. Very little hop influence, but the malt bitterness will balance the flavor.The aftertaste is bittersweet coffee, which will become residual in the finish. However, the full body is made crisp by a high carbonation and the mouthfeel is thick but crisp. Robust flavor, but easy drinkability."
"Drinkability - Good drinkability with this one. It's not a big heavy stout with a ton of cloying sweetness, it's lightness and crispness make for very easy drinking."
"Not bad at all. The only thing I can see wrong is the lie of the ""bone white"" head."
"Drinkability: This is a very easy going, laid back stout from a brewery generaly producing beers that I would classify as anything *but* easy going and laid back. Goes down well, a solid stout, but nothing special about it and lacking a bit of ""meat."""
"Verdict? Drinkable but not memorable."
"All in all I really enjoyed this beer and feel it is very drinkable. I certainly will work this brew into my regular beer rotation."
"Taste: Bitter right off the bat, with a slight creaminess blended in. Chocolate and coffee jump out at me. Kinda like a Guinness on steroids. Mouthfeel is light, buttery. At only 5.2% ABV it's not gonna reappear in my fridge anytime soon, but worth a try if you like stouts that arent too heavy and go down easy."
"Looked a bit like a coca-cola but a big-bubbled beige head. Smell is mainly coffee with some toasty malt. Taste is a full coffee and dark malt flavor. Mouthfeel was thin, just a little watery for the style. Easy to drink. I think it makes a nice simple digestif. Try it with ice cream."
"This beer is very drinkable, I don't think that it is something to be quickly drained, but it isn't something that needs to be sipped either. This is a beer that I would definitely buy again."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The intial flavours are good. As the beer warms up the astringencies become closer to unbearable. I will finish drinking the bottle I am drinking but I will not be drinking anymore of these."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium head with great retention. Aroma of roasted and smoke malt is clearly dominant with a nice touch of coffee. Taste is also dominated by the smokiness and seems to leave little place for the coffee. Body is a bit thin and carbonation is low. Not bad but definitely not for me."
"They body is closer to moderate than full. Some minor astingency notes. Carbonation is light but ok. Overall some noticeable off note but nothing overally offensive. Would like to see a bit more chicory as well."
"This bottle was taken from dirtylou's stash while he slept on my couch."
"D - This is a beer to be enjoyed all night long, now that it is fall."
"Pours a very opaque dark brown, with some red visible at the edges, big tan head forms and goes, lots of lace. Smell is sweet and malty, with a strange roasted grain aroma (maybe from chicory) and a shot of coffee. Taste is coffee/chocolate up front, a sweet and sour middle, roasty bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation and very smooth. Different and not half bad."
"Strong taste, leaning toward bitter. I love strong coffee, but this ended with more of a cough-syrupy than good coffee aftertaste. Look and feel and smell are its better characteristics, taste is where it's lacking. Not fully developed, a little on the thin side. Not bad but not balanced, the Dogfish India Brown Ale is a better choice."
"As it enters the mouth you get the coffee feel but it is thinner than expected. The chicory notes are nice but I was hoping for something a little more developed. Finishes with a slight sweetness and a slight bitter, sour mouthfeel that resembles coffee. Not bad but lacks balance and that final touch."
"cheers..."
"Smells of light roasted grains with a cola-like blend of sweetness and raspy accent. Coffee is light as is the rest of the herb garden in this beer. Taste is stout-light but commendable enough with lots of medium-roast coffee and vegetal dryness in the finish. Body is thin and without character, a definite mark down on any type of stout but it fits with the easy-drinking stylings of the brew."
"This is definitely a unique brew. An odd one, but unique none the less."
"My second offering by DFH. Thanks to my sister for this sample. Pours black, but not pitch black, with a large brown head. I had to carefully pour this, as the head kept getting larger and larger and sliding down the outside of the glass. After ten minutes, the head disipates down to about a 1/4 inch of dense foam. Oddly, no lacing. With such a thick head, I expected lace. Smells of breads, roasted malts, bitter chocolate, chicory, and coffee. Something else is in the scent as well. Not quite sure what, but it reminds me of... Barbeque? On first taste, my tongue recognises what my nose did not. Charcoal. After that, oh, so that's what it was moment, my tongue also tasted coffee, bitter chocolates, chicory sticks, roasted malts and bread. There is a difference between the taste of malt and bread in this beer. The malt is more grainy, while the bread has a chewy feel to it. The aftertase is a bit oily. Buttery, perhaps? I did not taste any diacetyl. It also seems sticky. Uneccessarily sticky. Still, though, a good beer. Goes great with a nice smoky cheese(again, thanks to my sister)"
"This is a very dry finishing and acidic stout but wonderfully drinkable with a moderate body...great with greasy foods like roast chicken or Turkey."
"Im trying to find a time when this beer would be appropriate. Hmmm. Im rather disappointed that I bought a six-pack. Unless you have preexistent penchant for chicory, Id give this one a miss."
"Also has the flavour of overbrewed coffee. The kind that's been sitting on the burner for an hour or so. It's got that same bitter, metallic, burned tang to it, along with a sour black licorice flavour. While I like the look and smell of this beer (heavy dark fruit, coffee, herbs, alcohol) it's just too off-base for me tastewise. Yup, just too astringent, as a previous reviewer put forward."
"Very dark brown, faint reddish highlights. The light brown foam reduced quickly, but left some lacing on the glass. Coffee aroma is quite pronounced, earthy hops and a little wood & smoke. Moderate bitterness, with coffee starting things off. Sweet flavour with a bit of acidity, sour fruit and licorice starts at the midpoint. Dry, roasted finish that melds with the other flavours, but the astringency gets to be a little too strong after a while. A bit slick with a fairly light body. Moderate carbonation. Good drinkability especially if coffee stouts are your thing, but the astringency was a little too strong for me by the end."
"A flawed stout at best. The sourness really detracts from the taste. Its pretty overwhelming. This beer needs way more balance."
"All in all, though, a reasonably good attempt at a coffee stout... it just seems like something could be added. I expected a bit more from a company like DFH.... but I guess no one's perfect =P"
"Certainly unique... but still isn't my cup of tea (or depression-era coffee?)."
"Great dark look,but the head was a little smaller than other stouts.Great taste that changes as the liquid moves over your tongue.A smokey taste with a hint of coffee.I like this stout,it has the right spices that make it just a little sweet.This may be a good stout for people to try who don't like dark beer."
"This beer is definitely different. Interesting match of flavors, with the bitter dark coffee and sweet chocolate. My mouth doesn't know if it's coming or going, which makes for a new beer experience. It's not one I would seek out again, but it's OK."
"12 oz bottle provided by mattcrill, ala BIF16. Thanks for the opportunity! Pours a one-finger light brown head over a very dark brown liquid. Smells chocolate with some roast and a hint of smoke. Tastes roasty coffee, chocolate, smokey and chocolate. Dry rioasty finish with some grassy hops. Md-thick mouthfeel and md-light carbonation. Not emmensly challenging, but enjoyable and flavorful."
"looked forward to this for some time. got a bottle at the frog inbetween bands at a record store down the street. poured a dark deep brown, not black like id figured. alright head, tan and tight. smelled pretty good, chocolate, coffee...a bit weak though. first thing i noticed was that it was a bit thin for what id expected. def. some typical stout characteristics (def. coffee) but it seemed a little sour. ""off"". boring is the best way to put it i guess. i dont really have much to say as its a pretty uneventful drink. i could have a few but i could also have one. ok at best."
"Definitely not a bad stout, but just kind of bland. Nice-looking, but it kind of borders on boring and thin after that."
"The comparisons to a brown ale are not out of line, though I would still consider this a stout, for what it's worth."
"Overall an excellent beer, but not enough kick for a stout."
"Highly drinkable, although I don't think this would make a great session beer. This is more of a dessert beer in line with Rogue Chocolate Stout and the like..."
"A decent beer although the flavors seem to be not well blended. I think I wouldn't go out of my way to buy this one again due to the price to taste ratio."
"Enjoybale flavors and balanced well. I was actually expected something a litte more bitter, but everything seemed to be well in check the way it was. This stout provides the dark roasted full flavor of its imperial and double cousins yet with just above 5 percent ABV. This lends a tad to its drinkability as well."
"Drinkable as a mild dark ale, but that's about. The idea of a chicory stout sounds cool, but the reality is that this needs to grow a pair in order to take it's place as a decent stout."
"This stout pours as a decent stout should, with a deep, dark, body and a light tan thin head, and little carbonation. The aroma is very pleasant, a nice combination of cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, and sugary molasses. However, I found the flavor to be a bit weak, and the bitterness (and dryness) a bit too strong, a bit out of balance. The basic flavor profile is pretty good, however, but this does hit it's drinkability. Nice beer, but not what I was hoping for from Dogfish."
"This isn't my favourite stout, but it's still a very approachable and drinkable offering."
"Drinkability: I could easily make a session out of this. Nothing to make you go ""wow"" but a classic example. Probably a good cross-over beer for all the Guinness drinkers out there. This is well done but not overpowering at all. Strongly recommended."
"Absolutely a fantastic stout in all aspects. Dogfish is now two for two in my book and I will be excited when the 90 and 120 minute make there way to North Carolina soon. Dark as chocolate syrup with a taste to match. Better as it wamrs to almost room temperature. One of the best stouts i've tried in a long time."
"purchased as part of sampler case. Poured a deep brown, almost black color with tannish head. Smell is chocolate, coffee, and toasted malts. Taste is nice and toasty, chocolaty, with some bitterness. Finishes dry and bitter in the moth. A most enjoyable beer."
"Black body, with a coffee brown frothy head. Smells yeasty, bready. this is a light flavored stout, refreshing in a way. if you want the chicory to be detectable then you cant go hard on the roasted, toasted malt, hops, or high alcohol. So all these flavors are ballanced vey well so that rather than the typical hop flavor at the end, there is a light chicory flavor. Mouthfeel is light, smooth and watery, the most refreshing and thirst quenching stout i have had. drinkability is high do to it's smooth body and great ballanced packaged in a lighter flavored stout. but dont forget the sweet chicory surprize on the finish."
"An easy drinking stout, though not as bold as expected from Dogfish Head. Smells of sweet cocoa, coffee, roastedness, and a touch of molassas, dates, and figs. The head and the body are both thin and a little too relenting. But the flavors are melded nicely. Sweet roasted malts with bold coffee and cocoa flavors round out nicely. Hops and roasted grain combine for fair bitterness. A creamy mouthfeel aided by lactic acids make this beer slide right down. Slight grape or plumb flavors chase the carbonated finish. Aftertaste is a slight lingering dryiness that retained slight bitterness. It's a pretty good beer that isn't over the top."
"Well - this is one odd beverage. I tried it once before before writing this review. I was going to slam it bad because it was just horrible. Same 6-pack - but the first time it was way too cold - refrigerator temprature. It was akrid, steeley, thin, sharp and unpleasent. This time, since it was warmed up to maybe 55-60 degrees, it really turned itself around. I now recommend giving this a try - but drink it nice and warm!"
"-UF"
"This is an interesting stout - remarkably drinkable. This would be a wonderful beer of which to have several. Not particularly overpowering, it does hold a tasty bitterness which makes the beer continuously engaging. This would go very well with some grilled food."
"The taste. Basic stout. Not too full in body, but heftier than a typical ale or lager. Stout enough to be stout. Baked characters. Faint cream tones. Nothing out of the typical. Good. Nothing that propels this brew into greatness however. Wet finish without notice of hop dry effect. Drinkable. Not awe inspiring or memorable though."
"Has a black body, a little light shows through when poured. Light tan head that didn't stick around much. Tons of roasted barley aroma, slightly sweet, coffee, smoky but not burnt. Flavor was really smoky, light citrusy sweetness. Quite a dry finish, and a light to medium body. A good beer, but really tastes much more like a porter than a stout. As a porter I may of rated it higher, but against its style I had to dock it some."
"Mouthfeel is pleasing with good body and a vibrant carbonation that propels each sip. An enjoyably different stout that I wouldn't mind enjoying on occassion. Fairly easy drinking. I'd say this one is worth your time."
"Pours a very deep black with just a faint red hue when held up to the light and a finger of beige head that quickly reduces to a cap that stays around for the rest of the beer. Very nice chocolatey capuccino aroma. Taste is roasty and coffeish upfront with some molasses and chocolate notes a faint hop note blending in with the roasted bitterness and an astringent finish which becomes a little unpleasant towards the end of the beer. Medium bodied, maybe a little on the thin side. An OK stout, nothing really exceptional."
"I like this beer and wish I could get it more often."
"This is a black beer that poured a 3 finger head that dissapated quickly. Nose is a hint of coffee and malts. Taste has a presence of chocolate at the beginning with a nice coffee hop finish-nice! Mouthfeel is a little thin for the style. Overall drinkability is very good- I would recommend this."
"Notes: Its a stout, body is thin, and the acrid and dryness is too strong. Overall this wasn't as good as I hoped it would be."
"From this 12oz bottles pours a dark stout, very nearly opaque black with a sticky light brown head. Smell is a little weaker than I'm used to with DFH beers, but some coffee and sweet chocolate come through the malt. Coffee and semisweet chocolate flavors are big, as well as roasted grain. Some smoky woodiness is there as well. Mouthfeel is thinner than I would have expected. Flavor is full and big, but somewhat unbalanced. The flavors simply do not flow well. They seem to go back and forth a bit. A decent beer, not bad by coffee stout standards, but still uninspiring."
"This beer pours a dark brown with an off-white head. The head doesn't stick around very long, it disappears leaving a small ring with minimal lacing. The smell is of coffee and chocolate, quite good. The taste is great. There a flavors of dark roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, & a bitterness from the hop addition. It has a good mouthfeel, moderate carbonation brings out a lot of the chocolate/coffee flavors. This is a very drinkable beer. I'm so glad that stores around my neighborhood are carrying Dogfish Head brews now because I couldn't get them for a long time. I've found all of them to be very good so far except for the pale ale. I would definately recommend the Chicory Stout."
"Thanks to acoatley for sharing this superb beer."
"notes: ahted this the first time i tryed it. needed a 6th to finish off the mix pack and went iwth it cuase i ahdnt ahd it in awhile. much better then i remember. i had heard it was gettign retired and was happy, hoping a better stout or porter would take it's palce, now i think i wouldn't mind t sticking around."
"Thanks to acoatley for sharing the bottle!"
"Tap. Pours jet black with a thin tan head. Aromas of roasted malt, light coffee, hops, and leather, altogether a fairly complex bouquet of aromas that is quite inviting. Mild, somewhat watery flavor of leather, sweat, and hops with oat and hop undertones. Light and watery palate, yet medium to full bodied."
"Drinkability- Would definitely have this one again. Kinda like drinking a carbonated iced coffee. Thanks for the sample guys!"
"Finishes dry, but drinkable nonetheless. Gets more complex as it warms..."
"Drinkablity is good for me on this one. I am going to enjoy many of these."
"Overall a dissapointing offering from DFH. Nothing about this beer seemed to mesh. There really isn't a feature to this stout that stood out. I guess it would be a good for beginners who are curious to the style. As for me, I won't be looking this one up any time soon. I do hope this was an off batch."
"This is actually a really good interpretation of a stout. It is on the light side, which is perfectly fine, but the extra, unusual ingredients really play a profound role that picks up the complexity of this beer without really being noticeable in and of themselves."
"Pours out of the bottle with a 2 finger tan colored head and is a somewhat opaque black color. The smell ifs of chicory and roasted barley mostly. This is a fairly simple stout, you get flavors of coffee, some smoked chicory but not as much as i was expecting due to the namesake. Finishes up with a bitter, but sweet and matly aftertaste. Descent but nothing extraordinary, more of a fallback beer really"
"A two finger dark tan foamy head resulted from a pouring of a 12 oz. bottle of this very dark brown, or black beer. A foam film fremained on top while sampling this beer. At first I struggled with definite aromas coming from this beer, but soon discovered the main one, coffee with notes of dark chocolate. Coffee followed through in the taste makeup as well as burnt malt. There was also a bitter chicory edge to this beer. This was a smooth beer, but I felt it lacked depth and was light in the mouth with too much carbonation as well. Otherwise, a pretty good beer."
"I bought six, drank two and I think I'll cellar the rest. I'll bet that sourness will relax a bit."
"Get Back! You really have to be in the right mood for this unique stout. Don't get me wrong I love stout. All kinds. But this one caught me off guard and when I get to try a new stout I want to like it. Chewy, bitter, and high alcohol all gave this one a real ""off"" taste and bad aftertaste. I've had coffee stouts before and really liked them as I'm a coffee nut as well, but maybe it was the chicory as well. Yuck, I'll pass on this one in in the future."
"Drinkability is decent, I could have another bottle."
"Good Lord !! An easy pour produced a MASSIVE foamy head on top of coal black frosty. Very nice malt, hop and lite coffee flavor (what the hell is chicory?). Good carbonation made for a nice tangy finish after the smooth, mellow start. Only had one, wish I had more of them, as it was very tasty and enjoyable."
"taste of coffee, chicory, chocolate and some citrus. Poured dark, but it did not pour a very good head, the head was gone within a few minutes. Very drinkable however, the bottle did not have to live a long life in it's glass. Not one of the greatest beers I've had before, but it was definitely good. A tad thin I would say for a stout."
"A nice session stout that incorporates chicory. Nothing to get overly excited about, but certainly worth trying."
"Drinkability and Overall: Based on reviews I've read, I was afriad this would not be my beer. But I really like it. Strong, robust, and full of enough flavor and complexity to keep me drinking. This is not a beer for everyone. Don't let the chicory in the name scare you, I can barely even taste it. Dogfish Head continues to push the limit with their beers, and this one kick ass."
"Not for everybody. I found it unique and full of flavour. Smooth though medium bodied. Stout aroma, but unique with the ingredients, somewhere between a coffee and a tea. Moderate roast, licorice, chocolate malts, and aggressive carbonated finish. You have to like stouts. Had again late in year and sourness really came through which didn't work this time around."
"The guy at the store told me someone returned this six-pack because it was bad, so he gave me a bottle to see if I thought so too. Bottled May/04. Pours black with red peeking through and a 1 finger tan head. There is rust on the bottle where the crimped part of the cap was touching the glass. Some coffee and chocolate aromas with a little bit of hops. Almost no taste. Carbonation and hops with malt coming through as it warms. Feels average. Tastes like a macro version of a stout (and this is Dogfish Head we're talkin' about here). Definitely a bad bottle - I've had this before and remember it tasting much better. I'll have to re-review sometime."
"Reflection: I usually expect more from Dogfish Head but this beer is pretty average."
"poured black with a off white head.aroma bitter sweet choc. black licorice,malts, caramel, molasses, light smoke, coffee, hops. flavor, black licorice,bitter sweet chocolate caramel, molasses, coffee,hops with malts and cherries thrown in. could drink a few of these another good one one from DFH."
"Pours a dark brown that borders on black. The head, while initially thick and light-brown, with rock-like crags and large bubbles, soon declines into nothingness. For most of the experience, there is no sign of a head. The aroma is of roasted barley, baking chocolate, and coffee, with a little chicory. Actually, to a small degree, it resembles a chicory flavored coffee. The taste is dry and bitter, grainy, and a little slick-oiliness. Roasted, almost charred flavor pushes into the hind-taste, with a generous hop bitterness. Its good, but overall, its something of a middle-of-the road stout."
"Not impressed with this stout. Label boasts of coffee flavor, and it's there, but nothing different from just about any other stout I've had. Appearance was disappointing, with little to no head, ok color - not jet black but very dark brown. Smell actually pretty good, but again, nothing unique here. Taste...eh... again, not bad, just not exceptionally good. Mouthfeel quite thin and watery for a stout. This isn't a bad beer, but Guinness is better and cheaper, so that's probably what I'll be purchasing in the future."
"I'm not sure what happened here, but this is not good beer by any measure. DHCB is hit-or-miss with me and Chicory Stout is an unqualified miss. Maybe the brewers simply need to add triple the amount of St. John's Wort so that disappointment isn't so acute in those who buy and drink this beer."
"Mouthfeel was pretty good and chewy, but as for drinkability, I don't think the flavor was pronounced enough for me to want to down a second one in one sitting. Just not enough overall flavor."
"Notes: An interesting thing to try. This is not my favorite stout, and I did not even find it altogether appealing. The creativity and craft is what I love about Dogfish, not their perfection. Very interesting beers come from Dogfish, this is one of them. I praise them for that."
"Drinkability: It's an ok coffee stout. Nothing spectacular and the mouthfeel is really bizarre and not at all what you'd expect for the style. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"This is an ok beer. If it weren't for the carbination this would be even better, but the drinkabilty is affected by the carbination."
"Your average stout until the finish which has some nice coffee notes and latent choclate sweetness. On tap this is marvelous. In bottles it is very solid. If you can get it it trumps guiness and mackeson as a very ""go to"" stout when out at the bars in NJ. Not very heavy in the stomach, reminds me of most brew pub stouts except slightly heavier (but not as much so as 'super' stouts). The chicory is apparent on the extreme end of aftertaste.. a nice addition. A well balanced beer worth trying."
"An average stout."
"The head is a cramy, somewhat dark beige head that dissapears quickly. Certainly not the ""bone white head"" that the label describes. The appearance is almost black with some dark red hues. The beer is practically opaque. It smells like strong coffee with some hops, smoke and chicory present. The taste is a littel tart. Cafe du Monde in New Orleans make a coffee with chicory that tastes a lot like this. The mouthful isn't as full as most stouts but the aftertaste is pretty strong. Coffee, smokey chicory, some odd bitterness and a bite of anise linger for a good long while. The fact that this is not as thick as most stouts makes it pretty drinkable."
"An interesting offering from DFH that doesn't really do it for me. Too boring re: flavor for me to go back to. A slightly above average stout. Pleasant yet nothing to write home about."
"The aroma is nutty with coffee smells in the background. The taste is very good. Carbonated slightly, with a nutty taste that is coffee like and pleasantly bitter. The aftertaste is much like the bottom of a cup of coffee. Very good stout."
"This beer pours a very deep brown. Not as black as I would want for a stout. The nose is a bit of coffee and roasted malts. The flavor is a bit thin. There is a nice mocha infusion in there, with coffee overtones, but it is still a bit thin. The mouthfeel is better than the flavor. Its nice and thick. I could drink a few of these bad boys. Another good beer from the Dogfish head company."
"Have one for dessert."
"Mouthfeel is medium, there is some minor character in the form of carbonation, but it's not viscuous, and just a shade above average. Drinkability is similar, decent, but nothing to write home about."
"If I ever get a male black lab I'll name him Stout, and think of this version."
"Pours out very dark brown. As put by the extremely cute bartender, ""That's one of the darkest beers I've ever seen."" And she couldn't have been any more right. Aroma consists of burnt and smoked malts. The hops were almost not present at all, this is a very malty beer. The taste was just overwhelming. It is not a terrible taste, but it is extremely smoky. The best way I can describe it is my uncle makes these smoked baby back ribs, and they're really good, but you can only eat a few before the smoky taste gets to you. I will not be having this beer again, but I'm glad I tried it. It was a struggle getting thru one of these."
"Dogfish in Michigan - a good thing! Pours a dark reddish brown in color into the glass. A chocolate brown head develops. Aroma is of coffee, cocoa, and rhubarb. The first sip reveals a very sweet taste that seems like there is a milk added. Another sip reveals a roasted coffee taste. It sometimes tastes like a brown ale. OK. I'm glad someone tried it. A decent but not outstanding stout."
"Poured a nice Tan head which made me laugh as it says right on the bottle ""...beneath a bone white head."" Anyway for a stout a tan head is acceptable though I thought the brown hints of this brew made it a little unappealing visually even though it was very black and completely opaque. The aroma reminded me of dirty wood with a slight roasted grain finish. Not very pleasant but not indicative of any fault in the beer so I gave it a 2.5. The taste was very smooth and there was a very nice finish to this beer. That woodyness is present in the beginning but only as a background to the upcoming blend of light sweet malt and a very smooth, clean roasted malt flavor. This beer has a lighter body than I like in a Stout and the carbonation detracts from the flavors making the carbonic bite take away a lot of the in the initial rush of flavor. This beer is one that is worth trying but not one worth mentioning to anyone unless you are trying to dissuade him or her from brewing with chicory. The chicory taste is like a woody, dirty coffee flavor that is only semi-pleasant as I appreciate the attempt that the brewer made and I also appreciate the diversity on the shelves this ale presents."
"Absolutely nothing offensive, but without the power of the best beers from Dogfish Head, it seems to drift toward blandness."
"Drinkability: Meh."
"This beer poured black with a tan head. When the glass is held against light a slight dark cherry color could be detected where the light was able to show through a little. The smell was of dark cocoa and espresso. The taste was good. Mostly a cocoa coffee flavor. Seemed slighly sweet until the hops kicked in rounding the flavor out. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Very easy drinking stoudt beer."
"P.S. I got a sixer of this with a friend who doesnt drink much beer, and he loved it, so if this can help introduce newbies into the world of craft beer, then it cant be all that bad!"
"Tastes like it smells, almost like a jelly belly jelly bean toasted marshmellow mixed with a cappucino. I can't taste the roasted chocory that the bottle promises, but the organic Mexican coffee is apparent; an excellent stout though a little overpriced"
"Super smooth and creamy with excellent carbonation. An easy drinking stout with great taste; dry, sweet and everything in between."
"Nice rich cocoa vanilla aroma. Deep black colored beer with a cherry hue. Light brown colored head poured thick, but faded rather quickly to a film leaving no sign of lace. Bitter cocoa flavor, a bit of vanilla and a little nutty/woody. Body is solid, smooth, and easy to drink."
"Final Thought: About what I expected, a very good lighter stout that will periodically be in my rotation of singles pickups, very refreshing!"
"This pours a dark brown/black color that is lets almost no light through and has a collar of bubbles as a head substitute. Smells of roasted coffee with malt sweetness stick out and a slight hop scent as well. There are notes of chocolate as well stirring about. The taste is of roasted coffee and chocolate with a slight bitterness to it. A bit of smokiness and spice, possibly the chicory can be detected as well. Mouthfeel is good on this one as it is creamy and silky and it goes down east as well. A good stout from DFH with a slightly different flavor than most."
"Wyll-"
"Film of bubbles passes as head on this dark brown/black brew. Aroma is of dark malts mainly, with a tidbit of hops making an appearance. Taste follows along the same lines, with coffee and chocolate malts dominant. A bit of bitterness due to the heavy dark malt bill in the recipe, but that's about all I can complain about in the mouthfeel. Same trait of the brew affects the drinkability, but overall an enjoyable quaff."
"Beer is good. Happy dark coffee beering."
"12 ounce bottle, pours dark and chocolate, dark tan head, leaving nice lacing. Mocha in the nose, chocolate, coffee and sweet malt flavor notes. NIce smooth silky mouthfeel, medium bodied. This stout is on the sweet side, with some nice roasted malt notes iwith a long smooth finish. More quality brew from DFH"
"A solid stout overall, with a nice roasted chocolate/coffee finish to it. A tad on the sweet side, with a bit of smokiness added in. What was interesting about this beer is that I bought a 6er and drank five of them within about 2 weeks, and I was not overly impressed. The flavors seemed muted and the ending was a little bitter. I just now drank the 6th (about 3 months after the originals) and it seems like a different beer. The flavors are bolder, maltier and sweeter. Perhaps let a few mellow and see if you have the same results. Still not in my top 5 stouts, but quite good."
"Not as robust as I like in a stout, but what was truly intriguing was the waft of roast chocolate ; almost smokey like. Perhaps a tad too sweet for my palate, but certainly worth the nostril adventure. Sat really boldly (for a short time) but the head quickly dissipated.Overall an enjoyable experience."
"Overall a good beer. I would drink this one as a single bottle now and again, but I seriously doubt that I could drink more than a few of these."
"This is a bizarre stout. It's not very good, but not entirely bad either. The sourness and metals are odd, but unique. The thin body and diacetyl are off-putting. Despite these wierd short-comings, it tends to grow on me. Closer to a porter than a stout."
"Not bad, but the coffee causes it to be a little too acidic for my taste."
"DRINKABILITY: Fair for a coffee stout ... I wouldn't go too far out of my way to obtain it, but I also wouldn't hide to avoid it either."
"An OK beer, but not what I usually expect from a stout."
"I don't think I'll be drinking anymore of this anytime soon."
" Overall, a slightly above average stout, but the DFH Worldwide Stout is far better in all respects."
"It would also go well as a precursor to a more fuller bodied stout, just to get the taste buds flowing."
"Taste is bitter and smoky. Dry. Coffee flavors evident and a nice bittersweet aftertaste. A bit thin fo rmy tastes but still a tasty stout. A bit more body and it would be great. Easy to drink. OK but nothing outstanding."
"12oz Bottle packaged in Dec. 03 Poured a deep mahogany with a tinge of ruby red at the edges and a thick fluffy head that settled down to a dense layer of froth. Coffee and sugar dominate the aroma with roasted malt and a faint presence of hops. Body seemed a bit thin on first sip but turns out to be quite rounded and satisfying. Very smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. This is a stout I can enjoy! Slightly dry and full of flavor that is a good roasted malt and coffee treat. A pleasant surprise and a damn fine stout."
"ng"
"Chicory stout but I don't taste any chicory. A little misleading, that's all. Poured out a lighter shade of black with very little head, but some lacing was around the glass. Smell was mostly coffee with some underlying of espresso. Taste was ok I guess. It tries to combine the coffee, chocolate, espresso, hops and malts all together and it goes all over the place. Not to mention the roasted aftertaste that seems like it's going to stay with you for a while only to go away very quickly. It was quite smooth and creamy, I'll give it that, but as a stout goes, it's only ok."
"This beer poured a dark brown color with a very small dark tan head. The lack of carbonation surprised and upset me. But I move on. The smell was between coffee and espresso with slight chocolate tones to it. Not bad. The taste was a bit off in my mind though. Roasted coffee is upfront but the roasted mouthfeel leaves abruptly. Much more chocolate than I would expect. Hops provide a nice counter balance of bitterness to the sweet flavor but no real flavor in themselves. A creamy coffee taste comes back in the finish along with some bittersweet chocolate. My problem with this beer was the fact that all of the flavor that I mentioned had an astringency to them. This was esp. true relating to the coffee. It almost seemed like the batch might have been infected with something. I don't know, this could've been really good but something went wrong and threw a nasty astrigent flavor in with all the other flavors. I have a few more in my fridge, maybe I will see if they were all like this."
"For me this brew has a very nice overall flavor to it! Definite flavors of coffee and malt up front that goes together nicely. Also can pick out the slight chocolate flavors within this brew. Thought I would experience move of a chicory coffee taste to it, almost like having a nice cup of coffee while sitting outside Café Du Monde in Orleans, but it was not! I feel that the brew could be a little heavier based on the style but over all I think it was a good beer. Based on it being a thinner with a nice flavor I think this could be a pretty nice session brew!"
"Light to medium body, smooth, doesn't feel like a stout at all, more like a cola. A bit of a biting astringency to it. Good beer, not a good stout."
"Dogfish Head Chicory Stout was an opaque brown with a good coffee colored head. The lace was also good. The aroma was both coffeeish and metallic. The taste had elements of chocolate and coffee (Mexican coffee according to the label), some sweetness, and a decent hop bite. This was a smooth beer, not as chewy as I anticipated and with little of the toasted taste I was expecting. It wasn't as heavy as many other stouts.The finish was dry and a little bittersweet. No doubt a decent dessert beer. The dated bottle was a good feature."
"I still think this is a nice brew, but I guess I expected more from DFH on this one."
"Poured into the glass very dark, had a surprisingly big head,slighly malty sweet aroma,slightly sweet malty taste with a sharp smokey punctuation of what I assumed to be chicory, really somewhat bitter.Its nice, different perhaps a little to bitter for me."
"Has a nice dark cola color and a good head. The aroma was malty, with a slight chocolate note. As for its mouthfeel, it was far thinner than I'd expected, which might make it more suitable for session drinking than an average stout. Very malty, almost smoky taste with slight black coffee undertones. Quite a delight to drink."
"A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut."
"The beer as it sets in my chalice a pitch-black with the head modest in size and the texture semi-creamy and the color a nice light chocolate color as it ever so slowly dissipates, the lace forms a concealing veil to hide the glass from view. Nose has a nice bittersweet chocolate sweetness, roasted grains quite evident and the crisp freshness I find so appealing in this sub-style of beer, light coffee tones as the beer warms to the glass and the home. Front begins sweet and malt laden, the top is middling in feel with the finish acidulous, hops are benign and pleasant to the palate, aftertaste desert dry, and a lingering semi-sweetness remains long after the swallow is gone, a good drinking beer."
"Finish seems empty, as if the brewers forgot a key ingredient. The rest of this sixer will be headed for a Frankenstein laboratory of black-and-tans with some various hoppy ales, in an attempt to balance the one-dimensional oxidized flavor."
"The beer pours a black color with a light brown head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has the scent of roasted barley and chocolate malts. The taste is of rich chocolate and roasted malts. It has a bit of woody flavor to it which only enhances the taste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good stout. It's full of flavor and is still highly drinkable to the ocassional stout drinker."
"A dark black beer with a dark head poured into my glass. The aroma was of coffee and hints of chicory. Nothing overpowering but a noticeable. The flavor is a match for the aroma. Big hints of coffee, malt and that hint of chicory twisted together to form an interesting brew.Well I think it is the chicory. Chicory is a substitute for coffee and there is a ""twist"" in the coffee flavor of this stout. A light feeling in the mouth and a good level of enjoyment and drink ability. Overall and nice brew."
"""A dark beer made with a touch of roasted chicory, organic Mexican coffee, St. John's Wort, and licorice root. Brewed with whole leaf Cascade and Fuggles hops, the grains include pale, wheat, roasted, and oatmeal. We buy the coffee used in our Chicory Stout from the Oby Lee Roastery in Lewes, the only one in Delaware. We are proud to let you know the Chicory Stout won 2 gold medals at Chicago's Real Ale Festival in 1998! 5.2% ABV, 22 IBU available year round in bottles and draft."""
"It should be noted that, while it was sampled/reviewed in Dec. 2003, this has been in my cellar since Spring 2003, so it's been aging for at least 7 months. Maybe that's why I didn't get any of the harshness or disparate flavors noted by other reviewers. So, drink one now, and save one for later;see what you think!"
"Dark dark brown beer with a tan head that vanishes quickly.Smell of roasted malt with slight coffee in background nothing jumps ou and really grabs you. Taste is smooth roasted malt with a slightly bitter coffee bite. Mouthfeel is light too light for a stout really. Not a bad beer just not a geat one."
"Very deep brown color with ruby highlights. Head is minimal and disappears quickly with virtually no lacing. A pleasant smell with roasted--not burnt--malts, coffee, and a hint of spice that I can't pin down. A nicely balanced nose, which is reflected in the taste as well. As the color and nose hint at, the taste is not particularly thick or bold, but it is pleasant and balanced. A moderate sweetness at the start with typically roasty stout notes entering shortly after. Mouthfeel is too watery, which makes this a drinkable but uninspiring offering."
"Drinkability  This one went down nicely and helped cool my mouth in between salsa tastings."
"Cheers!"
"Sampled 9/30/03"
"I don't know what to say about this one.... I was hoping or maybe wishing for a little more overall, but still an enjoyable brew just the same. Dark brown pour and decent one finger tan head that soon disappeared. Great smell of roasted malt, hops, chocolate, all things dark. Taste was slightly bitter, slightly acidic, mostly roasted and definite hints of chocolate and coffee. Not bad, but nothing really to make me shout ""wow"". Decent mouthfeel with a nice carbonation level. A nice offering, but there are much better stouts out there, to be sure."
"Taste: Fizzy at first and watery thereafter. Slight metallic sourness, reminiscent of cold coffee. Definite earthiness and coffee notes in the middle. More slight acid at the end, with a slight drawing of the mouth by the not-so-flavorful hops. Pretty disappointed here."
"Drinkability: Okay.. but many better to try and re-try."
"Drinkability: It's not bad and worth trying if you can get it easily, but I wouldn't trade for it or anything. I was underwhelmed by this one, but then again, I did just recently have Bell's Java Stout. I suspect the coffee used in this was not as darkly roasted as the Sumatran used in Bell's."
"Drinkability: Quickly becoming one of my favorite stouts. Another great DFH beer."
""
"Zum wohl!"
"a much more subtle stout than i expected. pours a deep, near black colour with a grand off white head which takes decent time to dissolve, leaving a mild stickiness on the glass. smells weer quite mellow, with a bit of roastiness accompanying bread, coffee and chocolate. the taste was a bit more aggresisve than the smell, but nicely balanced between the coffee and chocolate. there's a sweet kick at the finish as well.. this is quite a dry brew that was very smooth and easy drinking."
"For a supposedly premium product, I was extremely dissappointed with this offering. The appearance was slightly above average, head was just ok and appearance was a bit lighter than I like. Taste was a bit like lemonade...puckery with just a hint of smoke. Mouthfeel was more like a Mike's hard lemonade than a stout."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a medium size light tan head (not white like the label states), that mostly diminishes, leaving good lacing. Aroma is mostly of roasted coffee, some bitter chocolate, maybe some chicory in there as well, as well as a bit of hoppiness - a fairly subtle nose overall. Flavor is a bit sweet, somewhat bitter, some smokiness poking through, and a mild hoppiness sneaking in also. Medium in body, mild in the carbonation."
"False advertising, dammit! The bottle says ""bone white head."" The head was none to white or cream-colored, though I suppose it was certainly lighter than the heads on most stouts. Coffee beans have a ""next grovery aisle over"" subtleness to them -- not very pronounced. Light but creamy mouthfeel is not entirely impressive -- rather, the brew is a bit thin with a medium-ish body that could stand a little more meat. Very drinkable, however. Easy sippin. The flavor is pretty straightforward -- some coffee-ish hints. Initial finish lends the feel of chewing on wood chips. Brief spike of intense roasted bitter aftertaste fades pretty quickly."
"The feel is OK, but a bit watery. Not bad, mind you, just a bit watery. Very nice drinkability, as I could enjoy this for hours of slow sipping."
"Overall it's just a really nice and unique stout. I'm not really crazy about it, but it captures the essence of chicory and roasted barley perfectly. So for what it is. A+"
"All that wonderful flavor crammed into a 5.2abv package, quite an accomplishment getting that done without the beer coming across as thin or one-dimensional. Stouts are certainly on my short list of favorite styles, but not usually a highly drinkable session thing. This one leans that way, too, but has enough character without too much alcohol to earn a good rating."
"a dark and nearly opaque body that, held up to the light a little, is dark red, clear (not cloudy) and bubbly-sustaining the head nicely. the head is not exactly ""bone white' as advertised but is more the color of my lung tissue...tan and amber hints, creamy looking. the head stays and leaves what i'll call 25-35% lace in the glass. i'm not sure if i should leave or take points for not being 'bone white', don't think i will, just be advised. sweet scents hit the air upon opening and seems like milk chocolate, malted milk balls, dark coffee and some caramel. but the flavors contain a whoa amount of coffee making me wonder if i'm going to get a caffiene buzz from this one. if they could brew this with tobacco and eggs in it i'd drink it for breakfast. (yuk yuk yuk). it starts like a caf`e `a lait and dries in the finishes up with a roasty hopped espresso delight. a little cocoa (middle) and molasses (post flavor) hinting about. a bubbly mouthfeel that has a creaminess in the start but crispens up (crispening?) all in all i could drink a few of these but the beer could use a little more balance ti seems to leave too much on the palate for my liking."
"Notes: Good beer. Very well named beer! This is a great beer for people who want strong flavor in their brews."
"Eclipse black color. Small head. Aroma is coffee. A medium bodied stout. Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. Boy, oh boy, is there coffee in this one. Chicory and Mexican coffee blend with the malts for a very interesting, intense coffee flavor. Hops are slightly bitter and a touch on the grapefruity side. Well balanced. The coffee flavor predominates, but i's not very overpowering. A nice beer. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"I'm a big fan of chicory coffee, so I have a feeling I am gonna like this one - plus it is my first taste of Dogfish Head. Poured a jet black, didn't look like a too, too heavy of a body. Topped of with a head that reminded me most like when warm soda is poured into a glass - very bubbly and brown, but low retention. The aroma is a nice chicory, burnt coffee aroma, plenty of malty goodness. The taste is really good, and the flavors coat your mouth well. The taste was a full of chocolate and sharp smelling coffee, with a hint of earthy smoke. Very well done, I look forward to trying some more from this brewery."
"Drinkability is average-it tasted good just not the way i thought it should. But for the price I paid, I will not pick up any of these unless they go on sale..."
"Decent, but flavor isnt complex or balanced seems a little off in some aspects. Could be a little richer, but still just slightly above average."
"Pitch black hue, some carbonation and no head, contrary to the label talk no bone white head. Deep coffee beans, chocolate and licorise on the nose, very pleasant. Surprisingly thin up front, coffee flavors subdued, oily, slick charcoal to be noted in the body. Borderline medium bodied. Confusing, seems a bit out of balance, was expecting more rich and deep flavors."
"Ok, my bottle said that the beer would have a bone-white head. Either they're stupid or it was a joke because this head is a nicely foamy medium tan. The body is a nicely opaque black. The aroma is a nice blend of coffee, black chocolate, licorice, charcoal and something that may or may not be chicory. Not really strong nose. The flavor is surprisingly reserved and balance. I'm used to Dogfish Head stuff being over the top, but this is actually reserved, but just a little more flavorful than the typical stout. The body is surprising thin considering the color. I'm not always a Dogfish fan since I'm not always impressed with over the top for over the top's sake, but this is a tasty beer."
"This brew poured all but no head. What head it had was made up of medium sized brown bubbles. It had a strong malt aroma and an opaque black brown body. It was smooth initially with a very thick mouth feel and a slight bitterness in its coffee malt finish. This is a very delectable brew. One I would very much like to have again."
"Though the beer itself doesn't seem to truly backup the intriguing flavorful promises that the label offered to entice me to buy this 6 pack, it's an enjoyable, somewhat sweet, moderately rubust, stout, which I can see myself trying again in the future."
"Roasty coffee nose .. and opaque black in color.. if you like the smell of coffee and the taste of roasted malts then this is your beer. Alcohol is low and the flavor is strong with licorice tones and roasted coffee flavor.. A beer that can be enjoyed year round due to its subtle alcohol and flavors.."
"As advertised, Chicory Stout features a ""bone white"" head that sits atop a dark brown liquid that displays ruby edges when held to light. Its head is thick, creamy, and retains itself incredibly well. The nose is varied, with notes of roasted coffee, chocolate, some hazelnut and tobacco. Taste is diverse, as well. Big notes of roasted coffee beans, chocolate, macadamia nuts, and spicy hops are evident. The overall flavor is a battle between sweet and robust, with the sweetness of the chicory and malt reigning champion over the roasty coffee flavor as the beer warms a bit. The finish is long and complex as would be expected. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side for a stout. This is a unique brew, as I've come to expect from Dogfish Head. Although I don't think I could drink more than one in a single sitting, this stout is a very nice effort overall. Would make a fine dessert beer."
"The beer pours very dark, with a nice light brown head. Chocolate and coffee evident in the aroma. The chocolate and coffee are also both very evident to the taste. There is a very good maly roastiness also. The chicory leaves a subtle, but pleasing taste to the stout (a good mellowing agent). These guys are good!"
"Very drinkable. This is an enjoyable stout. Not a fabulous stout. But, an enjoyable stout."
"Originally sampled on 18 September 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. This is a light bodied, dry, slightly bitter stout. It's nicely balanced. It's better than average, but not great. It is dark brown, almost lack in color w/ a slight coffee nose."
"-F"
"This was fantastic. Nose was very faintly smokey and lightly roasty, with a touch of chocolate and licorice and coffee. Tremendously well balanced beer, on the dry side of the scale, and an irresistably soft texture, the flavour teases rather than kicking you in the face. Chocolate, subtle roasty coffee bitterness, light smoke. Really fantastic. I could could drink a lot of these in one session, beautiful."
"This particular Stout had very little head, if any, to it. There was not much lacing with this brew at all on the sides of my glass. It had a nice coffee aroma. The body of this Stout was brown. There was bitterness noted with this brew. All in all, not a bad brew."
"I had this one in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep black with 2 fingers of tan head. There is almost no lacing on the glass. The smell is mostly of roasted coffee. It is a nice aroma. The taste is fairly strong of coffee and a bit of chocolate. There are a few hops present, but this is mostly a malty brew. The mouthfeel is heavy and strong. The drinkability for this stout is good too at only 5.2%."
"When poured into the glass the color was black with some red highlights on the edges. The head was a creamy tan color that did not last long and formed a small skim over the top and a tan ring around the edge. The lace that was left behind was patchy in places and non-existent in others. The aromas that came from the glass were of dark malts, some sweet malts, dark fruit (faint), coffee, chicory and a hint of burnt chocolate. The aromas seemed to be more complex as it warmed. Better. The taste was very similar to the aromas. Tastes of dark and sweet malts, creamy chocolate, roasted coffee, chicory, dark fruits (as it warmed), roasted nuts and hints of alcohol. And also like the aroma the flavors seemed to get more complex as the temperature rose. When served cold it is not too bad a little rough, but when allowed to warm up, all the flavors blended together to produce a really good flavor over your tongue. I will be honest, when served fresh from the tap it is a better drink. But the bottle version is still good."
"Pours a promising nearly opaque with a brown creamy head. The aroma primarily consists of chocolate malt and creamed coffee. Mouthfeel is way to thin for a stout. Taste consists of roasted malt with coffee undertones. Bittersweet throughout and lacks smoothness. Finish is very dry. Flavors seem to be balanced between themselves, but they don't really make a lasting impression. Taste just seems to fall apart on the palate. Oddness in the overall flavor also, don't know if that's the chickory. Over-rated in my book."
"Poured a near pitch black color with huge oof-white head I had to wait a few minutes to drink it so the head could go down,smell was of deep roasted coffee and bitter chocolate.Taste was coffeeish and roasty with some earthiness lingering in there as well.A nice complex stout but a little watery.It is slightly different then the bottle I had a few months ago not quite as chocolaty,not sure if this was an older bottle or a different recipe."
"This beer pours a very dark brown color with a medium off-white creamy head and moderate lacing on the glass. The aroma is of coffee and maybe a hint of chocolate and possibly some roasted malt. The taste was not to my liking because I am not a fan of coffee. But this is a good beer and a very solid stout. If you like coffee and you like stouts, this beer will probably please you - but because of my dislike for coffee, I have to give it just a moderate grade."
"It's completely opaque with a pretty small head. The aroma is pleasant and consists of sweet roasted malt and burnt coffee. I don't know what chicory tastes like, but I didn't find any flavors that stuck out as something I have never tasted. I simply taste a solid stout with emphasis on coffee. The finish is great with an awesome clean bitter coffee flavor."
"Another ""is it a stout or is it a porter?"" Once again the lines blur and the drinker is left to his opinion. Yes, it poured dark with great chocolate bubbles. Yes, it had the the coffee taste, and a slight ""chicory"" taste. But it also had the sweetness of a porter. Whatever this beer is, it is very enjoyable."
"Acquired in the Philly Gathering Beer Exchange."
"The taste is a solid stout flavor with a nice touch of mocha. It seems to be somewhat one dimensional in flavor though, and there's not much hop noticable. The dryness in my mouth is wonderful. The stout really primes you for another drink. Too bad winter's nearly over."
"Black in color. No lace. Aromas of coffee eminate greatly. Tastes of coffee also are great. Wish I could flavor the roasted chicory a bit more. Not a bad beer, in my opinion. Went well with a steak but I couldn't imagine drinking this thing without some sort of grilled meat product."
"Drinkability: Bitterness and lack of any smoothness really penalize the drinkability scores. A little to harsh for me. Worth it's $0.99 price tag."
"Not too bad, but not what I was really expecting. I think that this tastes a lot like Guinness off tap(which I really dig). There is definately a heavy coffee smell to it, very aromattic. The color was a dark, rich black color that let no light through it. The head didn't last long at all. The mouthfeel was somewhat unimpressive. Don't get me wrong, it was a good feeling, but nothing really stood out to me. I would buy it again and let it sit for a little bit next time, to see how it goes."
"Drinkability: a decent stout, easier to put away a few of these because of the comparatively light body"
"Yes sir, I like it. I like it a lot It pours a dark, midnight black color. Upon the initial pour, a huge rocky head presented itself, then over a period of about 5 minutes, it faded away leaving a 1/4-inch cap and several thick, sticky rings on the glass. The nose is full of coffee and chocolate aromas with undertones of toasted malt, no hops are detected. There is also a nice smokey aroma that seems to push its way through. The first flavor that hits my tongue is a slight bitterness of hops, ahh...there they are. The next thing I tasted was a perfect blend of rich coffee and bittersweet chocolate, all the while still maintaining that same smokey quality thats in the aroma. There was a bit of a dry finish on this beer, but it wasn't too bad. This is a very smooth and well-balanced beer. I will definitely purchase this one again."
"Uhhh..I have never seen a beer or poured a beer with this amount of carbonation.As Soon as I (slowly)poured it into the glass its like it exploded and rose all the way to the top almost overflowing.I'd say I have at least a good three inch head just sitting here.The color is black with a brownish chunky ice cream looking head.After a good five minutes I've finally got the whole bottle into my glass.I dont really taste or smell any coffee as the label states there is.Aroma is kind of weak.A very sweet aroma with hints of raisins,molasses,and chocolate that are hard to make out.An extremely crisp mouthfeel that leaves a very dry finish.Ok now I taste a bit of coffee.A little taste of hops with a touch of bitterness that lingers.Not a real distinct flavor that presents itself.A sweet taste that touches of raisins,molasses,and coffee.A different type of stout that overall Good to Very good."
"Tasted: 03/04/03"
"Not as good in the bottle as on tap. Pours black with a tan head. This head is in no way ""bone white!"" Coffee... yuck! A bit too much coffee and complexity going on throughout this brew. If Dogfish tweeked it a bit, this could become a classic. I guess I'd like this beer more if I liked coffee."
"I'd rather lick the outside of a WWS bottle."
"Chicory Stous is a deep, dense brown color, but doesn't produce much head. The smell is mouthwatering, however, the flavor fails to convey the expected heaviness and live up to the initial promise. Somewhat uneven and one-dimensional, with an aftertaste like a persistent ringing in your ear."
"Overall a pleasant stout that is very drinkable. I only wish it had more chicory bitterness and flavor so as to stand out from other medium body coffee stouts."
"This is a stout? I wasn't to impressed with it other then its appearance and smell - this was an average stout. But since its a DogfishHead I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Color was very dark brown and had a solid froth of light tan hues. Smell was nice, little smokey, some hop presence, cocoa, and grainy wild rice maybe. Taste was a little watery and not solid enough for a stout for me. It has some smokey grain, coffee thing going on, nice hints, but not enough for an eyebrow raise. Felt a bit creamy and finished a tad lighter then I was expecting. Some bitterness from the hops and a hint of smoked grain or cocoa lingers. Its just below a good stout in my book. Could be bolder and thicker. Actually wouldn't serve bad for a summer stout."
"Good stout, not great or anything special. The label boasts a bone white head which, in reality, doesnt exist."
"I'm getting hints of the chicory. I can detect the hops underneath all that smokiness. I once primed a homebrew stout batch with chicory coffee (Cafe du Monde) and it actually came out pretty close to this. I'm getting an alcohol presence on the nose. Deep, rich and unique. Not an everyday beer for me, but I like it."
"Mmmm... coffee, mmmmm.... beer, mmmmmm coffee and beer. Pours a ver dark amber practically black color, with a decent tan head. The lace is definitely forming in rings to my glass here, pretty good head retention for something with whole Mexican coffee beans. I heard it's really hard to pull off, the aroma here is primarily in your face eye opener of coffee beans, a whiff of chocolate tones, dark roasts, and a very light hop aroma is hidden in there. The taste is primarily a sharp bitterness of harsh roasted malt and hops with the softer flavors taking the back seat coffee, cream, and chicory. It's not what I was expecting from a brewery capable of WWS. Two different worlds I know, but even the body is too light here, I am just not digging this one. It is not very drinkable for well balanced flavor or catching a nice buzz. The aroma is the best thing this beer's got going for it."
"This beer poured a very dark amber, almost black color. It formed a foamy, light tan head that left circular lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation was present. It had an aroma of malt, coffee and chocolate. The flavor was of malt, chocolate and bitter coffee. Or else that was the chicory. Not a bad beer but not one of the best ones. I know people who love it, but I think there are others that do this style better."
"(Packaged in date=2)-- Appearance: Pours a dark black color and the head is creamy, sticky, dense rocky, and is cardboard in color. On the nose the aroma of chicory and coffee, dark toasted bread, dark chocolates, hints of charcoal, and roasted grains. On the palate the flavors consisted of sweet coffee, malt sweetness, dark chocolate, little hop bitterness, slight charcoal flavor, a little buttery toffee and toasted dark bread. I enjoyed this stout... unquestionably distinctive and unique brew."
"This beer pours a dark, dark brown, almost black. Not much head, fading to a 1/4 inch collar, but a little sticky lace on the glass. It seems chocolate and coffee preside on the nose, as well as roasted malt. Then the first sip confirms the chocolate, coffee, roasted malt and something that seems to be a little spicey, a little tart. I don't know if it's Chicory as I have never tasted it, but there's something different there. A little short and dry on the mouthfeel and finish, one or two is enough for me. Good Stout but missing something in the end."
"Pours deep brown... almost balck, but just a hint of light passes. Has a finger thick cream colored head that is very persistent and leaves a touch of lace on the glass. Aroma is quite appealing... coffee, roast malt, and an aroma that I can only guess is chicory... kind of reminds me of sasparilla. The flavor leaves a bit to be desired... roast malt is present, but not very prominent... then some molasses followed by a slightly sour flavor, and the finish gave the impression that i was sucking on a wood chip. It is smooth and creamy, but quite dry and a little on the thin side. This is an interesting effort, but it falls a little short in my opinion."
"It is good and drinkable just isn't all it could be."
"the appearance was a little disappointing. i was thinking, ok, stout, super dark and thick. it had almost no head when advertised to have a bone white head, . i would say it was more tan. it was also a dark brown with amber highlights when backlit. the aroma was of malt, bitter coffee stench, earthy and i wanna say tree bark. the taste was close to the aroma with more wood attributes. it was like sipping something brewed on a wood burning stove or BBQ. it had touches of maple as was almost no hop. pretty thin mouthfeel for a stout with a dry, not impressively sweet malt finish. nothing great, but with the thinness of this stout, unlike most stouts, i could drink many of them at at sitting."
"-Oelergud"
"Chocolate, and so much more, like vanilla, bananas, nuts, coffee, loads of dark, but sweet, flavors. One solid stout! Very mellow, beautiful, and tasty as they come! An utterly unique invention!"
"The Chicory Stout poured a solid, near-black color, with hints of dark brown when studied in the light. A generous head formed, and settled to a consistent 1/4-inch thick layer. This nice appearance was complemented well by a very interesting aroma. Roasted coffee-like characteristics and strong malt presence were detected, along with a deep candy or licorice scent...not knowing what chicory actually smells like, I'm guessing this was it. The strong smell actually set me up for a little bit of a disappointment. Heavy, dark maltiness came through in the taste, along with the licorice or chicory detected earlier. But the end result was a somewhat weak stout. A decent taste, but a little dry, and very little hop presence. The mouthfeel was definitely a little too light for my taste in a stout, too. While the addition of chicory made this stout interesting, I prefer a heavier, more traditionally flavored brew for the style. Worth trying, but not sure if stocking up would be ideal."
"A ton of sweet malts in this brew. Color is very dark brown and head is small and tan. Appearance could easily be mistaken for coca cola. The carbonation is very light and body is full. No discernable hopiness to this brew but like I said before there are a ton of sweet malts. It also has almost a candy aftertaste that left me with a 'Jagermeister-like-aftertaste', but only to a much lesser extent. Good, but nothing to rant and rave about here"
"This stout poured from a 12 oz amber bottle to give a dark brown, translucent beer with thick, rich, tan foam that stayed forever. The aroma was very interesting. There was a faint smell of sweet malt and something candy-like, perhaps chicory. The taste was strong with the flavors of bitter coffee and chicory dominating, but also a faint licorice taste, as well as some small amount of hops. The flavor was dry.. The mouthfeel was a bit thin and airy, with moderate carbonation, and a lingering bitter aftertaste. The drinkability was good for this light-bodied ""stout""."
"I was looking forward to this beer after trying Dogfish Head's World Wide Stout and Brown ale. It poured black with a very thin, wispy head. The aroma was dominated by roasted malt and hints of coffee. So far so good. Once in the mouth, however, I was immediately let down by the watery body. The flavors are all suggestive of a hearty brew -- a sweet toffee-like malt up front, followed by roasted malt flavors and a mild, slightly woody taste (from the chicory, I assume). Hop bitterness in the finish is very mild. Grainy and woody bitterness lingers on in a fairly pleasant aftertaste. Drinkable, but not memorable."
"I don't really care for this one."
"This deep brown, almost black beer pours with a thin, tan head that recedes to nothing in short order. The aroma is somewhat hoppy, with roasted coffee notes. The first taste is big on the coffee, with some roasted malt behind it. Subsequent sips reveal more malty sweetness, while the coffee notes subside a bit. There is also some nice hop bitterness to balance out all the strong roastiness from the chicory and the malt. The body is rather light, reminding me more of a lager than a stout. The finish leaves nothing on the tongue, while the aftertaste has a touch of hops and some lingering coffee notes. This is an interesting beer that drinks rather easily. Perhaps a bit more maltiness would balance this beer a little better. A decent beer, worth enjoying when you're in the mood for something different."
"this beer has a wonderful arrangement of dark malts with a great roastiness throughout. it has nice coffee and chocolate flavors that dominate, but there is a lot of sweetness to it also. it is very rich and creamy smooth, just a great stout to drink."
"Its not one that I would buy again though, for the price, there are much better Stouts out there for my liking."
"Mouthfeel is quite smooth and stout-like. Coffee, dark chocolate and dark fruits are the dominant flavors here. A tad thin for a stout, and it could use some more hop flavor, although there is some present. Nothing stellar, but certainly an above average stout."
"Cask-conditioned; primed with maple syrup, and with honey rum oak chips (from their distillery) added to the cask. Hazy mahogany in color with very little head. Limited aroma. The body is thin and the carbonation is low, but it's quite smooth in the mouth. The flavor offers a soft maltiness with a mild maple syrup note. It's very dry and lightly astringent. The rum character is quite clear. One of the more interesting characteristics is a mild roastiness that almost appears smoky in the finish as it combines with the alcohol notes of the rum. A totally different beer from the bottled version. Absolutely unique. A nice experiment but it just doesn't seem to hit the mark. Still, it's probably worth trying if you come across a cask of it as it is so remarkably different."
"Drinkability: O.k. for what it is. I wouldn't go out of my way for one of these, but at the same time, I wouldn't pass on it if one was placed in front of me. It just doesn't hold my attention...there are far better stouts out there."
"An ok beer, but there are better stouts to be had, this was a bit of a disappointment after having tried the Dogfish Immort Ale."
"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. I still have not had the WWS yet but this seemed like a good lead-in. Poured a dark brown color with little head and lacing. Roasted coffee flavor with a dry finish. Not as good as the other beers I have tried from Dogfish Head but not a bad Stout."
"Very dark, deep brown almost black ink in appearance. Strong coffee aroma. A strong chicory presence throughout. Reminded me of the chicory coffee sold throughout New Orleans. Roasted coffee/chicory flavor with highlights of bark/woodsy tones. Light body, poured with a very thin head. Overall a nice stout. More along the lines of a coffee porter"
"Clear but very dark color, a little ruby at the bottom.  Respectable head of 1/2 inch of tan with some brown streaks.  Aroma of malted milk.  OK body and mouthfeel, just a speck of coffee flavor overlaying a dark caramel tone.  I was surprised at the lack of dark roasted coffee and other bolder flavors.  This beer is pleasant, drinkable -- but ultimately disappointing in its lack of depth and flavor."
"This stout has a nice thick lasting head and deep brown color which, interestingly, is revealed ad bright red color when held up to a light.  The aroma of this one is hard to place.  There is a malty dark deep malty waft and what my brother described  as ""a spice that belongs on red meat"".  This one has a good amount of bitterness for the style.  Definitely different, but not something I would try again from a bottle."
"Stout? More like a mocha porter. The addition of coffee made this too thin to be a stout. This beer tastes pretty good but got a low review from me due to the adjuncts used. I hate it when brewers add coffee or chocolate to get a desired flavor. These flavors can be acheived by the types and amount of malts used (like SN Porter or Rogue Shakespear Stout). Also, I don't want my beer to be drugged with caffiene!!! At least the description on the bottle stated that it had coffee added unlike some other beers."
"Bottle claims ""bone white head," but actually it's quite tan and short-lived. Interesting stout, with some great coffee flavors and some dark bitter chocolate. I think it could stand a bit more of a sugary flavor. The beer is quite bitter, initially from hops but then a lingering, rooty finish that I'm not wild about. Very thin body, it grips the tongue but lets go too quickly. Some very good flavors, esp. coffee, but eventually the beer veers off to a greasy, dirty taste that I can't recommend."
"Smell of roasted malt and hints of coffee.  Black/opeque color with a moca colored head.  Sweet roasted malt flavor with hop bitterness.  Slight acidity/sourness with a vague coffee finish.  This one is very complex.. and you will enjoy it more and more the deeper into the glass you go... and yes even when you have your second...."
"116"
"Cheers to frank4sail for the sample."
"Pours a deep dark black/brown with only the faintest bit of light getting through in the corners and a nice creamy head that sinks but never disappears completely and a nice clinging lace.  The smell is of roasted malt, coffee, and some chocolate.  Taste is slightly bitter from the chocolate, coffee and roasted flavors.  The mouthfeel is slightly creamy and very smooth and it is a very drinkable stout.  This beer reminded me almost of a cross between SA Cream Stout and Redhook Double Black.  Since I really like both of these that is definitely a very good thing.  I really liked this stout, about the only improvement I could think of was to thicken the flavor some and make it a little creamier."
"Pours near opaque in color with a creamy brown head with little retention.  Aroma is a little on the sweet side for a stout.  I get licorice and coffee on the nose.  A nice lace is formed while drinking this beer.  Creamy texture.  Pretty interesting taste.  Different than most stouts I've tried.  While it is bitter, it doesn't seem like a roasted malt bitter so much, but rather, some exotic coffee bean bitterness.  I also get some licorice on the buds.  This stout has a little fire.  I like it, don't love it."
"Notes: An ok coffee stout, some flavours just don’t seem to mesh well together. Astringencies get in the way and become a nuisance to drink."
"The bottle touts flavors of coffee and chicory with a bone white head.  Poured a beautiful black, with a tan head.  I got no coffee in the flavor at all.  I've had chicory coffee, but I don't know that I would recognize it in a beer.  Fairly thin for the style, but was exceptionally smooth and easy to drink.  Hard to pigeon-hole.  Not dry or smoky like an Irish stout, not particularly sweet or creamy like an English, certainly not dense like an imperial, and not hyper-hopped like many American interpretations.  This is simply one of those beers that is so enticing that, before you know it, you are looking at the bottom of an empty glass.  When I finished the first I was eagerly anticipating the second.  I don't find a lot of stouts with that kind of drinkability."
"Thin and uninspiring. Contained none of the characteristics typically found in a stout. This is more like a light bodied porter."
