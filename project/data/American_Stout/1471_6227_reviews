"Blueberries add a nice subtle touch to the aroma and taste of this stout. Feel is nice as well. Enjoyable . . . Try it."

"Overeall: This is definitely a different take on a stout. Its decently good. I enjoy that its not a blueberry bomb and that the stout flavors can meld with it. There is some sort of subtle off flavor i get however, perhaps from the artificial flavoring. I also get a sense of lactose on the finish that is odd to me becuase i dont think its a milk stout. For me the aftertaste is the biggest negative to this beer. All in all worth checking out as a fun beer, but its a one and done for me."

"Overall: A very good twist on a Stout. The blueberries add a nice fruity kick without making things overly sweet. Solid chocolate malt notes."
"I endorse this beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Smell was great!  A bit thin for my liking."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice sipper for a cold day, that reminds of summer but is thoroughly imbued with the essence of winter"

"Meh not my type of beer, but that doesn't mean it's not a 10/10 for someone else"
""
""
"A very tasty stout, but don't be intimidated by the addition of blueberry. The fruit adds very mild undertones, not at all overpowering."
""
"The blueberries gives the look a darkish purple, kinda sexy, ha. The smell is not over powering, mild one can say. It is kind of sweet for stout, but not all that bad. It feels light on the tongue, however, it is very easy to swallow. Overall, this is one of those stouts that you can get sexy with your woman with. Not too boozy, yet not too overpowering either. Would I buy it again, yes."
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into stout glass. Very dark brownand opaque. Half finger of tan head that settles to a ring. Aroma is roasty with clear but not overpowering blueberry. Also, there is dark roast coffee and a little alcohol. Taste is initially roast coffee and dark cocoa bitterness with blueberry and chocolate sweetness. Medium-full body, creamy and a bit oily in texture, low carbonation, lingering berry sweetness on the finish."
"Overall, this is a solid stout with a twist, for those times when you’re in the mood for something a little different.  It didn’t knock my socks off, but I have no real complaints, either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good stout, but I wouldn't call it a blueberry stout. Skip it if you are looking for something that has blueberry flavor. I didn't expect this thing to taste like Kool-aid or anything...but some blueberry flavor would have been nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Just not good.  Really weird."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very deep opaque black with just a skin of head.  Nose is dominated by smoke and roast but the berry is clearly present.  Flavor is dry and smokey with a bit of berry sweetness balancing.  Palate was exceptionly clean even all these big flavors."
""
""
""
"Its was good, but the blueberry taste was real fake"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this beer last night and when I first opened the beer the blueberry smell was strong. Not a bad beer but I was thinking the blueberry taste should have been a little stronger.."
""
""
""
""
"It isn't bad, enjoy the blueberry, but this combo could be better. Nice try Dark Horse."
""
"I don't have a great analysis here. I just didn't enjoy the flavor of the beer."
""
""
""
"thin, artificial blueberry flavor and generally not very good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty descent ""fruit"" stout. It lacks for lacing and is really thin which is a shame; however, it smells like a proper stout with dark chocolate, oak, char, and malt with a hint of blueberries. Taste is similar with the blueberries amping up the dark fruit on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent thick brown head. Nice sweet smell. Good stout texture. Not quite as thick as I like my stout but damn good. Would definitely consider buying this to share with friends who like something different to try! Not what I'd buy a case of to knock back at home by myself. But still a great beer. For me it's a winter beer. Not a hot hard day at work beer."

"I'm actually enjoying one right now... I love the smell and color... definitely blueberry... nice change from all the raspberry beer's... a BA version would be probably really good..."

"Overall, I was intrigued by the idea of a blueberry stout, and I'm glad I tried it. Probably won't go after it again, though. Sorry, Dark Horse; but Plead the 5th is so much better :)"
""
""
""
"It's nice that the addition of blueberries is subtle, feels natural and helps the ""dark fruit"" characteristic of the beer, without messing with the great ""stout"" notes of this beer."
""
""
"It's blueberry. It's a stout. I wish the blueberry weren't so dominant, but were more of an accent to a nice stout. Not something I'd drink regularly."

"O: Not quite as delicious as Shipyard's Smashed Blueberry, this flavorful stout does have an ample blueberry component, an appealing aroma, and nicely balanced flavors."
""
""
""
""
"It pours a purplish black if you hold it up to the light right. Blueberry and dark chocolate aromas make for a sweet start. However, a roasted, teetering on bitter aftertaste aids the drinkability. There is a dry, cocoa powder flavor that makes it sessionable despite its ABV. Combined with the juicy sweet blueberry aromas at the beginning, it just makes you want to sip and wish you had a porch swing."

"A really nice, light tasting, stout. Mild amounts of blueberry flavors. Mild alcohol presence. Medium amount of sweetness. But so well balanced that it just drinks so well. To me, not as full bodied as it claims, but that's ok. It's nice to have a light, fruity stout that goes down smoothly. My second beer (regular Pt5 was the first) from this brewery. And I'm not disappointed so far. Very nice."
""
"Looks thin, but has rather low ABV for a stout so that is understandable. Has a good smell - nice roasty notes, with some light chocolate and lots blueberry. Taste has less blueberry than the nose but it still very present and makes for a solid brew. Fairly well balanced but needs a little more body IMO."
"An amazing stout, Dark Horse continues to impress me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Terrifically enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good take on a classic style, might be worth a new look when the season warms up. Think summer bbq at night or bonfire on the beach!"
""
""
"Snifter. As a brewer I understand the complexity of fruit incorporation to any type of beer, let alone the incorporation of blue berries into a stout. Total blueberry and coffee roast, along with a subtle sweetness from a light? lactose addition. Medium body, with a nice chocolaty roast finish. Carbs fill the gap...Nice job guys!! Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my new favorites from Dark Horse. It's not often you see a fruit infused stout turn out to be as tasty as this one is. Again, the blueberry is there to accent this beer -- not turn it into fruit juice. If I had any complaint, it'd be that I'd like it to be a bit more bold on the flavor. More blueberry and more roasty depth. This stuff tastes great as it is, but uhm... maybe an Imperial version, Dark Horse? Just a thought. Definitely try this one out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall my only complaint is not much complexity, though overall this is very tasty. I'd love to bake this into a dessert with blueberries"

"O- Though I like Shipyard's Smashed Blueberry just a tad better, this is a very well done blueberry stout with balanced flavors, a soft mouthfeel and enticing aroma."
""
""
""
"O: Always try a beer twice. I was unhappy with the amount of blueberry on my first try - I guess I was expecting a fruit beer. This is a stout with a blueberry aroma and maybe some flavor in that first sip of head. I will be picking up another 4 pk if I see one still on the shelves."
"On draft at Global Brew. Huge aroma of blueberry muffins, jet black with minimal head. Surprisingly not as much blueberry when tasted. Flavors of chocolate, roasted malt with subtle blueberry. Not thick or syrupy, rather smooth mouthfeel with a nice finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would definitely recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great fruit stout, the blueberry goes great with the with dark grains. Will definitely look for this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a terrific stout. Unique with the addition of blueberries."
"This may be the best fruit stout I've had. It manages to mix disparate concepts, fruit sweetness and stout roast. The blueberry comes out more bready as a muffin but that seems to work with the overall stout properties."
""
""
"My scores are probably a bit lower then they should be simply because I don't care all that much for blueberries. That said, the fact that my scores are as high as they are is indicative of the quality of this beer. The sweet, roasty, and tart flavors defy logic and actually come together to make a pleasant beer."
""
""
""
"So what I'm trying to say is it's light on the blueberries but I'll be ok. Boo-Boo says hi."
"This beer is wonderful. I find myself lost in the beer isle of my local liquor store. I see this 4 pack and it calls out to me. (I always wait for one to do that to me) Ive had this beer again and again, over the years. Ill agree with some other posts I have seen, as the head does not have very good retention, but when it is there is has a nice red color. This beer is pitch black and oily. It has the most wonderful aroma of blueberries and smokey malts. Dark Horse makes a fantastic stout, Ive had them all, but this one is my favorite. If there wasnt blueberries in it and it was just a little thicker, this would be a perfect regular stout. The alcohol is well hidden, but there is the slightest bite, which I figure comes from the fruit. While the taste is definitely not what you would expect, and I only say that because you would think Blueberry would be most prominent, which it is not, the rest of the smell meets taste in perfect symmetry. The mouth feel is watery for a stout of this ABV, but it is almost chewy, which I like. This is art in my opinion, and its relatively cheap, in my opinion, for a beer of this quality. Id love to have this on tap. I recommend!"
""
""
"O: I'll take a blueberry stout over a generic blueberry APA any day. The flavor is just much more suitable to a thick, dark beer and this one is pleasant and distinctive, and is a nice alternative to spiced winter ales. Alcohol and antioxidants? Sure!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Tres Blueberry is just delicious. It would be a very good stout without the addition of blueberry. But by adding it they've created a ridiculously smooth bodied stout without really even needing a thicker texture. This stout gets its blueberry notes across but takes nothing away from the stout experience itself. Maybe one of the better examples of pulling a bold stout off.'most overdue the fruit. This has a slap of fruit while still delivering a true American Stout. This is a true classic."
""
""
"Very great smelling beer, showcases the blueberries quite well. Somewhat the same for the flavour, though it could be executed a little bit better. I'm not going to complain that much just because this beer smells so damn good. As far as I know there aren't a lot of blueberry stouts out there, so this one is at least unique and interesting. I still prefer One Oatmeal to this, but this one I'll certainly buy again."

"A very enjoyable stout that perfectly integrates enjoyable blueberry flavors. An excellent and unique stout that is well worth trying."
""
""
"D: This was a very nice blueberry stout. The scent and taste were simple but delicious. The body was weak, but the finish was smooth so it was easy to drink. Very nice brew."

"Wow. A dark stout labelled as a blueberry with an actual honest-to-goodness blueberry taste. DH really pulled off a feat with this issue. Tough to combine a good stout taste with a blueberry flavor without one drowning the other but the balance is remarkable here. Drink it if you like a stout or drink it if you like blueberry but if you like both then this is a must-have."
""

""
""
""

"O- my first blueberry stout, and one that I would try again. Loved the aroma and the blueberry worked nicely with the chocolaty malt"
"O: A very good beer, I usually don't like fruit beers, but with one just works. It probably helps that they know how to make a good stout and then figured out how to complement it with a nice fruit addition. Definitely recommended for any stout lover, you might not love it, but it is worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- was pleasantly surprised by this brew. Let me start off by saying the smell was phenomenal... I thought it was going to be overly sweet and it wasn't. In fact its a great definition of a stout minus the bleberries. Now I've never had a blueberry stout so nothing to base it off of... but definitely in the top 3 blueberry (alone, any style) smell I've encountered. Personally, I've had better stouts (base beer) wise but this as well is definitelyup there.. its no bumb... I just think the folks over at Dark Horse blended together a perfectly balanced stout.. nothings overdone for me me and all the flavors come out and stay for the perfect amounts of time... Definitely Recommend"

"O – This stout is delicious. It would be great without the blueberries, but the fruit just serves as a great complement to the sweet chocolate and bitter coffee. Because of that, it’s a nearly perfectly executed fruit beer – the base beer is great but the fruit improves it. On top of all that, it is insanely drinkable. Great beer from Dark Horse. Thanks a ton, Jared!"

"Great range of flavor. Blueberry, chocolate, cream, licorice... I'd love to see more brewers take a stab at this concept."
""
""
"This is an interesting attempt to meld fruit with stout, but in the end both the blueberry flavor and the roasted bitterness are too muted to make for a true masterpiece."
""
""
"Crests near a finger of very dark brown foam, mix of bubble sizes, no dimpling just evaporation due to the surface, thin streaks of lacing but these do stick decently. The liquid is a full brownish black with some particulate visible, more than any bubbles, maybe some faint orange tint around the rims. The aromas do evoke ripe unpicked blueberries rather than juicy juice, good bit of roast to the cocoa, dark chocolate scents, vanilla, toffee and some heavy cream, not getting much other fruit or citrus, likely cloaked by the blueberries, has nice purity and thankfully is not really all that aggressive. Medium-bodied, light carbonation but this doesn’t seem to effect the freshness and the light fluffiness allows it to soak in but not get clingy. The blueberry flavor displays restraint and lends as much sour kick as sweetness, if you are looking for blueberry syrup you will be disappointed. Sneaks in some softer coffee notes alongside the chocolate, mocha, at the same time the roast is stronger than in the nose. Not much flavor hop-wise but texturally they may help stiffen it up some. About as “sessionable” as these type of beers get and not gimmicky."
""
"Beer is medium in body, with mildly effervescent carbonation that is never harshly fizzy. This leads to a lightly foamy and smooth mouthfeel with adequate weight. Ethanol cannot be felt on the palate or in nostrils. Closes semi-dry, with moderate lingering stickiness on the palate."
""
"Low B"
"O - A good blueberry stout, just not sure I'd go for more. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is thick and rich. There's a good carbonation that isn't too high but gives it some creaminess, along with just enough crispness to make for an even feel that doesn't bite too much for a stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Maybe I just got a bad one, but there was almost no flavor in this beer. It was just ash tray and some blueberry. With a rounder malt profile this would have been a far better experience."

"I love me a dark beer, and I think we can all agree that it’s hard to find a stout or porter with a particular fruit in its name. This beer covered all the main components of a spectacular stout and one up’d it by adding a perfect amount of blueberry to it. Smells of blueberries. Pours completely black. Tastes of chocolate, coffee and blueberries. Has a fairly pleasant mouth feel. Overall this beer was all that I wanted and was expecting... There are countless amounts of fruit wheat beers, but how many fruit stouts do you have? This beer could replace coffee and pie for dessert."
"O: Enjoyable and great spin on an imperial stout."
""
""
"Beautiful dark stout with foamy brown head. Berry Beers are not typically my favorite but the Blueberry taste is not sugary or overwhelming. Coffee and caramel taste pairs perfectly with the blueberry. There is a strong Chocolate aftertaste but not too bitter. Very nice beer for anytime of the year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O Hey, I don't like false advertising and Dark Horse wasn't lying with the name. Lot's of blueberry in the smell and taste, even a little in the color. It actually works really well. Blueberry, coffee, chocolate: Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown-opaque with a creamy mocha brown head. Ok retention and no lasting lace. Aroma is dark and roasty with the light sweetness of blueberries. A surprisingly pleasing combination that goes really well together. Taste is chocolately and malty, kind of lactose-esque, with blueberry weaved in throughout. It adds a lot to the smoothness and the suck-down-ability. I'm not trying to drink this fast but I definitely seem to be. Mouthfeel is smooth, slick, soft, and blankety. Stout appropriate. Overall I think this is a nice change of pace. I was a little weary of the blueberry at first but it works really well with this style."
""
""
""
""
"Pours an inky, solid black, brimming with off-white foam. Some lacing is present as well. Taking in the aroma, I could tell that this brew would exceed my expectations. Fruit flavored beers have always been very hit or miss with me. The smells I picked up were those of luscious desserts and bakery treats. Natural blueberry muffin, pie crust, cappuccino, dark roasted malts. The flavor of the blueberry was front and center, but there was an unexpected and pleasant smoked character as well. Slightly bready, it coats the mouth nicely with a moderate chewiness and a crisp finish. Don't hesitate to pick this up, even for those wary of fruit beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours black, three finger coffee head that dissipates quickly. you can smell the blueberries immediately on the pour. nose is pretty much all blueberries - and kinda artificial blueberries, at that. taste isn’t gimmicky though. probably the crispiest stout i've ever had; lots o' carbonation that seems to fit. balance of malts against the sweet blueberry is right on. its unlike any stout that i've had & i have to admit - i like it."
""
""
""
"O- This was a very pleasant surprise. The blueberry flavor and aromas are very juicy and pie-like, and fits nicely with the chocolate and roast. Very tasty stuff."
""
"Overall, a very interesting and different fruit infused stout. I like the blueberry flavors more than cherry that usually comes in stout. Not sure if I'd get this again, but a very interesting and solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a pure stout, but it works well as a stout/fruit beer hybrid. The blueberry does a good job of blending in with the base, never fully overpowering things. I'd gladly drink this one again."
""
"O: Overall the beer is very well balanced between the flavors from the malts and the blueberry. I thought this was pretty interesting but not sure I would have another in a single session."
"O: The beer has a nice balance between fruity and stout flavors. It is very easy to drink for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, opaque, black-ish color with a thin, filmy, brown head that clings around the glass. Aromas of blueberry tart and sweet, with a heavy dose of roasted coffee in the backbone. Flavors are rich and creamy, with a mocha backbone giving rise to a subtle sweet blueberry ribbon of sweetness. The fruit imparts a blueberry muffin character to the brew, and there are roasty highlights throughout. Very robust, on a smooth, full body. Roasty and fruity aftertaste, with a balancing bitterness. Clean, slightly dry finish. Very good."

"Serving Type- 12oz bottle poured into an over-sized wine glass. Thanks for reading."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours opaque black with a thick one finger brown head that sticks. The nose reminds me of Blueberry Morning breakfast cereal. A sweetened dehydrated blueberry aroma flits above the surface, but underneath is an almost nutty bran muffin and hint of dark chocolate. The flavor is not quite as integrated as the nose. It starts off with an artificial blueberry flavor with a tinge of sweetener that somewhat sloppily transitions into a moderate roasty finish by way of a kick of tartness and astringency on the mid-palate."
"Overall- Blueberry is one of my favorite flavors and I think it really worked in this one. I look forward to picking up a couple of these up every winter!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, I finally found it. Not that I was looking really hard, but it was a nice surprise. Thumbs up to Dark Horse brewers for mixing blueberries with stout so well. Very pleasant drink, mellow and lulling. Also have to add that at the end those 7.5% abv start to get through."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I have mixed blueberry lagers and stouts before but this beer takes the cake. Blueberry is not artificial, nor overpowering in the taste. A great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Everything about this beer intrigued me from the start, the simple label, the blueberry in a stout, the Dark Horse branding. I had to give it a try. The beer had plenty of surprises and the only disappoint, if any, was that the blueberry was a little underwhelming. However, still turned out to be a very good beer, and one that I would most certainly pick up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Typical stout appearance. Near black opaque body with a thick beige head. The aroma brings the blueberries right away. Blueberry, chocolate, roast. Smells very inviting. The flavor offers more roast and chocolate initially, with blueberries coming in mid palate. Quite tasty. Medium bodied with a bit of sweetness, but not nearly as much as I was expecting. Dry finish. I would definitely have this again."
""
""
"Time to buy a couple 4 packs!"
""
""
""
"O: i love blueberries so this was a must buy. and i personally thought it was rather enjoyable. i was wondering how much blueberries would actually be noticed, but as this brew warms up, the blueberries really start to come forward."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkable and overall pretty tasty. Nice fruit addition without being too gimmicky or played out. Blueberry might be a little too much as this one approaches warmer temps, though. Although I still don't know how I feel about fruity stouts - this one may make a believer out of certain skeptics."
"O - I enjoy fruit notes in stouts and this one is no exception. I always pick up a 4 pack each year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was expecting a lot out of this one but it underwhelmed and am i glad i bought a single rather than a four pack, or even two for that matter."
""
""
"Overall: I love blueberries so I had to give this one a shot. What I can say about this is that it is very interesting. A great beer? No. A solid, not typical offering? Yes."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Wasn’t sure about this one but worth a try. Pours pitch black with a brown one finger head. Really gorgeous pour. Aroma not helping me want to drink this. I can tell it is a mix of blueberry and chocolate, but really, it kind of smells like vomit (by kind of, I mean it literally smells like last night’s dinner coming back for an encore). Just weird. Luckily, the flvaor starts out okay. Not much blueberry going on to start, but the flavor is very roasty with hints of chocolate. Definite bitterness--not expected at this level from a sweet stout--and there are definitely hops here. Slight tinge of blueberry. Roasty smokey aftertaste with some cocoa. As I get through it a bit more the blueberry really starts coming out on the finish, and then all the way through. This just ends up becoming an all blueberry beer. Sweeter and sweeter as I go. Ultimately a drainpour. I just can’t deal with this one. Admittedly, I am not a huge blueberry fan anyway. Higher carbonation for a stout, which keeps it a bit lighter than It actually is on the palate. Overall I guess they hit what they were going for. But need to work on that truly effed up aroma pI would think even for those who are blueberry fans. Certainly different and interestingly complex, but not for me. It was worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is an excellent stout. Has the usual characteristics an average stout but the blueberries and hoppy finish just make this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall I bought this due to all the fans and heard it was one of the best of the series. Not sure if the bottle sludge matters or not but possibly it does, who knows. Interesting but flawed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black color with a moderate tan head that recedes to a creamy topping. Blueberry is definitely apparent in the aroma, blending with some roasted malt and dark chocolate. Berries take it down a notch in the mouth as the flavor opens with more of a dark, charred maltiness, bittersweet chocolate, and a hint of roasted coffee - almost like a dry stout - before the blueberry enters and permeates all the nooks and crannies with lightly tart juicy sweetness. Medium bodied with some texture and a slightly dry finish. Perhaps not quite as impressive as the first two ""holiday stout"" series beers for me, but still a satisfying and intriguing brew that I'm sure I'll try again."
""
"Very good stout. Would definitely recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nice beer, balanced well, and fun to drink. Blueberry works well , not overly sweet or overpowering. Has the right amount of tart, sour and sweetness to enjoy. A nice winter offereing and a great addition of the blueberry to a american stout. Will enjoy annually."

"Overall, it is pleasing, but not perfect. It certainly is an upper tier blueberry stout."
""
""
""
""
"An indefinite linger of roast and fruit extend well into the next sip, but resists the malty textures that would accompany it. Tres is a fantastic stout that's been dress rehearsed in blueberry dress clothes."

"O - I expected more blueberry but I think my brother had aged this a bit. Would like to try a fresh one, might try at Brewpub to see if the aging diminished the fruit."
""

""

"I expected more from my initial impressions, but this one didn't stick to my tongue long enough to taste all that delicious blueberry I was smelling. A little coffee on the back. This might be a better stout for a warm day. It didn't hit the spot tonight."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark opaque brown, that seemed to have a very slight bluish purple tinge to it. Had a 1 finger mocha brown head that was all little bubbles. over time it flattened out, and became a bit creamer with just a bit of hold on the sides of the glass. Aroma had an initial hint of blueberry, but shifted to a more of a roasted dark chocolate smell. A bit of fruity reminded hiding in the back. Flavor was more a mild chocolate that shifted to a definite blueberry pie filling. A bit of blueberry lingered afterwards. Coated nicely in mouth, a bit of cling to the sides, with a nice chew. Overall exactly as it should be. Well balanced stout, with a flavor profile that hit the name dead on."

"Overall. I didn't like the blueberry and floral tastes I was getting in this one. Didn't go very well with the base beer for me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice addition to the numerical order of Dark Horse stouts. Got to go find me some Fore next. Such an enjoyable stout and the blueberry really didn't kill the beer and let all the other characteristics stand out."
""
""
"D/O: An enjoyable, unique, *niche* beer, but the Blueberry is out of balance and makes this not terribly drinkable for me. Fun on an occassion, but not something I'd want by the keg."
""
""
""
"Pours a used motor oil black with a tiny khaki head. Smells of roasted malts with a hint of blueberry. Tastes like blueberry pancakes with maple syrup and coffee. Mouthfeel is pretty thick and chewy for a low abv stout and carbonation is on the low side as it should be. Overall I was very surprised by this brew, didn't think I would like it much but it turned out to be awesome"
"My pour resulted in two-plus fingers of thick deep-brown head with good retention. Color was a stygian, dense dark brown that allowed for ZERO light penetration. Nose was, indeed, tres blueberry! Redolent with blueberries, in fact. How can you go wrong with blueberries? They are full of antioxidants and I like to pop a handful in my mouth and bite down for an explosion of blueberries. That is what this tasted like, along with a slight coffee-like bitterness. Wow! Mouthfeel was medium and if it could have been just a little creamier, I would have been heaven-sent. Finish lingered with the taste of blueberry and I was thankful that I followed someone else's suggestion."
"O: This is a very unique beer for me. I never had a blueberry stout, much less heard of one. It matches all the characteristics of a stout with blueberry added. Some will like it, some wont. For me, it gets a solid thumb up for innovation and quality!"
"M&D - smooth for its flavor punch, yet with chewy elements, and surprisingly drinklable. This amazing beer has quite a layered flavor that demands some attention. If you're not paying attention while you sip this brew, you will after that first sip."

"Nothing really extraordinary here (though the blueberry component is a nice touch), but for a relatively low alcohol stout, this beer is pretty nice."

"O- a nice combination. Paired it with a Ben and Jerry's yogurt too. Good stuff."

"A nice specialty stout, and fairly well done, but I see no need to revisit a blueberry stout."
""

"An interesting beer to be sure and I now know why the reviews are so mixed. You either like a strong roast presence or you don't. I usually do, but the interpretation of burnt toast doesn't really do it for me."
""

""
"O) I wasn't sure what to expect with the blueberry factor, but this was really very good. I would gladly recommend this beer."
"O - This one sounded interesting, so I picked it up as a single during a trip to Indiana. This is certainly not your typical blueberry beer. More flavorful and complex than just a stout with blueberry added. A little bit on the sweeter side, but I enjoyed it."
"Drank on 4/6/2012."
""
""
"Exactly what a fruit beer should be: a good base beer with a real, non-extract tasting, fruit flavor. While I question pairing a stout with blueberry I can't question the execution."
""
""
""
""
"Oh the taste. Thick malt flavor, roasted malt, and leather come to mind. The blueberries area very nice addition to what be a nice thick stout. Drinkable."

"Overall: Incredible beer. Such a unique offering and there's nothing to not like here. Dark Horse continues to outperform."
""
""
""
"O - The scent is good in the blueberry department, but really a pretty average (or just above) stout all around."
"O: A good beer overall that smells great, but unfortunately the taste doesn't live up to the aroma. I'd like more complexity from the roasted malts and a stronger blueberry presence."
""
""
"Thanks (Matt) Capones!!!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Drank this beer a few different time and did not like it. I revisited this beer and I am glad that I did. Its really an outstanding stout. I think that I will be revisiting One, Two, and Four. As i have drank them, but never reviewed them. I am really impressed by this beer. Solid, solid stout! They used blueberries perfectly in this dark beer!"
"This is, first and foremost, a stout. The blueberry is definitely a spice in this beer; I think it enhances the flavor pleasantly. There's a subtle sweetness to this beer. Yet, it is not sweet enough to be a sweet stout, nor can it be described as a dry stout. It's like a blend. The finish and aftertaste has the blueberry show up one last time."
"Tastes very berries and chocolate. Smooth and sweet, but almost to a fault. Seems almost too sweet for my tastes, but this is still inarguably a fine blueberry stout, melding the berry tones with a traditional smooth stout."
"O: Blueberry comes on a bit strong, but I actually didn't mind that as much. The beer underneath is still allowed to come through. The lack of body is really what took this one down a notch or two for me. Poor head retention too. It would probably be nice in a pie crust."

"Served in a nonic, a rich obsidian black with a half-inch of creamy mocha head that domed precariously over the rim of the glass; moderate retention and lacing. Aroma heavy with dark roasty malts, and a distinctive scent of fresh-baked blueberry muffins. I know how hard it is to successfully meld fruit with the dark malts of a rich stout and get a satisfying result, but I think Dark Horse really nailed it with this one. Very roasty on the tongue, lots of dark malts, notes of coffee and dark chocolate, and an ubiquitous presence of fresh blueberries. Well, it delivered what it promised. Good balance, heavier-medium body, nice flavor, and quite drinkable overall. Again, I want more. Can't imagine it'd be quite as good if not fresh though."
""
"Received in trade from barak316, thanks for the opportunity. A vigorous pour produces jet black body with tight tan head that looks like poetry in a glass. It smells like blueberry muffins as soon as I pop the cap. Roasty herbal earthy aromas as well as some berries upon closer sniffing. Taste is herbal and earthy up front to the point of being annoying. That slowly fades into a burnt sugar roasted kind of thing. Long lingering caramel roasty sweetness with a touch of heat in the finish. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation, and a rough sticky mouthfeel. This kind of grew on me as I drank it, but its not one of my favorites. This for me was very similar to the two with the addition of blueberry flavoring?"
""
""
"Overall, a great stout from Dark Horse. Sweet and bitter, with great roasted taste."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled this year(new label). Pours pitch black color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, blueberry, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, and a bit of smokiness. Fantastic aromas, smells very much like fresh blueberries. Very authentic. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, blueberry, coffee, caramel, toast, and light herbal hops. Fair amount of coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, blueberry, coffee, roasted malt, and caramel on the finish for a good bit. Great balance of flavors; very nice showcase of the blueberry and roasted chocolate notes. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice highly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden at 7%, with only a slight warming after the finish present. Overall this is a highly excellent stout. Probably the best I have had with fruit in it. Great balance and big robust flavors; with very smooth drinking for the alcohol level."

"Overall I like blueberry stouts, the roasted malt works well with the blueberry sweetness. The smell on this one is very good and the taste just about matches it. Another fine beer from Dark Horse."
""
"Overall an excellent blend of sweet stout and blueberries."
"A fun beer, but not one that I can have more than 2 of in one sitting. Was hoping for more of the sweetness in the aromas to carry thru into the flavor."
""
""
"I'm not a huge fan of the blueberry stout option, but this one stands tall among the ones that I've had. Could've used something. A hoppy character. Higher malt bitterness level. More roastiness. More of a fresh fruit character. Still a quality offering from Dark Horse."
"Overall - I drank this for dessert with some 85% dark chocolate and let me tell you...HEAVENLY, the beer itself is unfreakingbelievably delicious if you like fruity, sweet beers. I usually dont but this one is so well crafted!"
"Overall, this stout came from the ""have to try this once"" category to the ""need to get some more"" category. I tried this out of morbid curiosity, yet I'm loving what they've done with the brew. I'm pretty convinced that dark horse could make just about anything tasteful now."
""
""
"Pours a three finger brown head that vanishes leaving no lace. Black color, no highlights, ton of yeast left in bottle. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Blueberry nose and flavor is roasted coffee and blueberry. $2.95 for a 12 oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
"O: A pretty good sweet stout overall."
"O- I really enjoyed this beer, wish I had more to share with more friends"
""
"I've been drinking my way through Dark Horse's ""numbered"" stouts. This one is definitely the best so far. The blueberry works really well with the dark roasted malts - so well that I'm surprised more brewers don't do this. An excellent beer, IMO."
""
"Overall this is not as amazing as I remember in the bottle when I first sampled last year. This is much more roasted and smokey than I remember and I prefer the lighter coffee and chocolate from the bottled version than this thick roasted acrid example."

""
"Overall: A nice fruit addition on a decent stout. The flavors play well together and give it an interesting appeal. Fruit gets a little much toward the end of the bottle."
"Overall - Good stuff. A flavor I wouldn't expect to go well. The stout tames a dominant blueberry flavor nicely and I don't feel like I'm drinking a fruit beer. I could use a couple more of these."
""
""

"Well considering this was an extra sent to me 2x I'm assuming a lot of people feel the same way about this beer. It's a tremendous fruit-stout hybrid and is definitely worth trying/sharing."
"O: Well done. Not overly blueberry at all. It really works well in this stout. Pretty good drinkability too. ABV is pretty well hidden."
""
"Taste-Dark roasted malt, coffee,subtle yet substantial bluberry that provides a nice counterpoint to the roasted malt. Very well balanced. Great depth and character. Smooth. ABV not evident. Great stout!"
""
""
"All in all though, I dug Tres Blueberry. It's always a pleasure to imbibe Dark Horse's stouty concoctions, this being no exception. Recommended."
"black with a coffee-and-cream colored head that crackles while it shrinks to a collar. nose is blueberry at first whiff, but after a couple passes, it definitely is multi-dimensional. layers of coffee, roast, chocolate, blueberry pancake and a touch of smoke reveal themselves, as well as a hint of proper old-school style vinous-ness that seems to be amp'ed up by the berry flavor a bit, and the taste reveals even more layers. on the palate, it's almost like the blueberry is meant to be there. all the proper stout flavors are at play, and they all seem to be elevated by the blueberry as well as the blueberry being elevated by them. this is surprisingly delicious. full body with a good tingle from carbonation. berry throughout while chocolate, a little smoke and coffee sing in the finish. hint of warmth at the back end also. one of the best uses of fruit in a stout that i have experienced."

"I've had a couple blueberry stouts before, and I didn't enjoy them. I figured if I didn't enjoy a blueberry stout from Dark Horse, who can make one I'd enjoy? If you've had a blueberry stout before and enjoyed it, then I'd definitely recommend this one. You can't really ask for much more, I just don't appreciate the flavors."
"Overall, a very good beer and an interesting stout. The blueberry is definitely there but not overpowering, it's just right. Along with the blueberry is a very good stout. Slightly high as far as alcohol goes but the flavors are really very good and balanced."
""
"Very drinkable"
""
"Overall, a very nice beer that delivers nice blueberry flavor without being overwhelming. By far one of the better blueberry infused beers out there IMHO. Fixing the mouthfeel would go a long ways on this one. A beer I look forward to every year during DarkHorse's five stout winter release."

"It's a relatively smooth beer, with a great finish. I personally think the smell is great, but would prefer even more fruit taste. I'm glad I tried this, and would have it again."

"O: Interesting, very unique and it changed a lot depending on the temperature of the beer. A lot going on but it wasn’t all balanced. Still good but not Dark Horse’s most impressive beer. B/B+ beer."
"Overall, it's a smelling blueberry cigar dipped in a big roasty malty stout. Absolutley love this even if it doesn't taste like blueberry. Fantastic!"
"Beer pours a nearly pitch black with a big fluffy tan head and some minor lacing. It's one of the most substantial heads I've seen on a stout, but that's maybe because I'm used to drinking high ABV stouts. Smell is fantastic, smells like blueberry muffins and roasty stoutness combined together, and it seems like there's something somewhat spicy lingering there as well. Taste isn't quite as impressive as the flavor, but it's still quite nice. Blueberries and roast are the primary flavors, neither overwhelms and they're pretty balanced, but I almost wish that there was more blueberry here. There's also some breadiness in there and some interesting spice that doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the flavors. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for the style. Overall, this is an interesting beer that almost is great, but falls a little bit short."

"this beer starts out like every other stout. dark brown/black body, half inch of brown head that quickly settles to a little skim on top. smell is where this starts to set its self apart from the others. at first there is a strong blueberry smell with a burnt coffee and smokey over cooked bacon. the all of these smels together remind me of the cheap gas station breakfast where a pancake is wrapped around other garbage. while i have never ate that stuff from the gas station i imagine it would taste like this, and that is not good. dont know that i would recommend this to anyone."

"By far my favorite of the series so far. Even if your'e not a fan of fruit in beer I think you would enjoy this one. The blueberry is definitely there, but in a subtle and unexpected way."

"A bit to much roast and burnt toast for my liking. I am not a huge fan of fruity stouts, but I would like some more sweetness/fruit flavors to balance out the acrid burnt stout."
"Even though I did like it very much it could be even better with less aggressive carbonation, and a more oily liquid, in my opinion at least."

"This pours out as a deep black color with a brown colored head on top. The head has a good retention to it and the lacing is a little sticky too. The smell of the beer is not really all that great. It's too acidic I think, it makes the beer smell a little like puke. There is a hint of blueberry on the nose but not enough. The taste of the beer is quite nice, plenty of blueberry flavors with some heavy roasted malts in there too. The mouthfeel was pretty heavy and creamy. Overall it was a good brew but the smell just turns me off a little."

"Hoping to work my way through all five of these stouts this year. For some reason, I decided to start here, with number three. Go figure. It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of darkly sienna foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate, dank blueberries, and some molasses thrown in for good measure. The taste brings in more of the same, but the conflict between the dark chocolate/bitter roasted malts and the blueberries is apparent from the get-go. It ends up coming off as too bitter, too pithy (sort of) for me. The body is lightly hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a nearly chewy feel. Overall, a pretty good beer, but the flavors involved just don't seem to mesh entirely well. I can drink it, just not very easily and without complete enjoyment. Close, though..."

"Big thanks goes out to my boy aasher for this one! Third in the series and third on the day! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic (right before it was murdered by my friend). Poured pitch black with a half finger light brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and blueberries. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, blueberries, and subtle dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Blueberry stout you say? Hmmm, might as well since I have the rest of the series to get through today... Doesn't smell too bad, but you can definitely tell this thing has blueberries in it without a doubt. The flavor is more of the same. Typical American Stout based brew with a touch of blueberry that comes throughout the sip and after swallowing. Still not sure how I personally feel about fruit infused stouts, but this one is at least a good start."
"My all time favorite fruit beer! This is 2 things, a very well composed fruit beer and an excellent stout both separately. You can disect both flavors in your mouth very easily. This is the best example of a hint of fruit I have ever had in a beer. You get a very roasty smoky deliscious stout up front with the perfect small amount of blueberry in the back."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a thick, dark brown color with a sticky mocha tan head that slowly settles. Some lace left as the head calms. Dark chocolate notes with an almost pepper like hint as well. For only 7% is smells a touch boozy as well. Light blueberry flavor in the beginning that is quickly dominated by a growing leather and roast flavor. A couple of sips of this pretty much told me exactly what kind a beer this was. Lingering roast with a slight alcohol burn. meh. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Nice look but the aroma and smell leave a lot to be desired."
"O: A good stout being they went out on a limb with the blueberries. It's a little off at first but grows on you. The roasty finish is awesome."
"From the beginning, the aroma harkens back to the childhood cereal with the blue ghost known as ""Boo Berry"". The malts in the aroma combines with the scents of blueberry make for an interesting combination. The appearance shows a dark murky brown, with little head after the pour. No forced carbonation in the mouthfeel. The creaminess of the lactose reinforces the cereal theme nicely. The sweet malt flavors really stand out in the initial taste. This is no macro-brew stout! The sweetness and the blueberry hints make an easy drink. The blueberry is not overpowering in the taste. If the fruit were more potent, one might forget he/she was drinking beer. The sweet malt fades to the back of the tongue, ending the pleasant experience."
"Overall – Kind of disappointed with this beer. I will have to pick up another four pack when they release it this winter, and can only hope I do not have the same experience. I did not even finish my glass."
"O-Excellent. I'd gladly have this one again."
"Overall, this is a great beer that I didn't think would be pulled off. Everything works together in near perfect harmony to achieve everything I would ever want in a blueberry stout. Not an everyday drinker, but a nice treat for sure."
"A tasty brew from a quality brewery!"
"O - All of the flavors and aromas in this beer go well together. The amount of carbonation in this beer make it feel lighter than most heavy stouts do."
"This is the last of the stout series for me and this one pours just like the rest, pitch black with a bubbly mocha head that dissipates to a ring. There is little lacing but lots of bubbles rising to the middle throughout. Aroma is surprising for a stout, it smells like a blueberry cobbler with some coffee and chocolate malts thrown in. The taste isn’t quite as nice as the aroma but still good with the dark roasted malts and bittersweet chocolates dominating. The blueberries are present but not overwhelming, making for a nice, balanced flavor. The mouth feel is medium bodied with tons of carbonation, Odd for a Stout. This is right up there with Plead the 5th in the series. Great beer and the best sessionable stout I’ve tasted in a while. I shared this 1, but I will buy more."
"O: Actually, really not bad. I think it does a lot to capture blueberry character and maintains it throughout smell and taste. I'm not sure it takes it to a level of deliciousness that really makes it worth reaching for, though. Would like to try this again on tap."
"O: I've noticed that the blueberry comes out a long stronger as the beer warms up, but never in an obtrusive way. I was quite surprised how well the blueberry works within the framework of coffee, chocolate, and roasted grains. Soft on the palate and easy to drink, it's a stout I probably wouldn't even turn down in the heat of July."
"I think this is a impressive beer. It has some flavors that normally would be the end of a stout to me, but rounds them out with a lot of interesting angles to the taste. It really keeps you sipping to continue to get all those subtle hints. On a nice side note, when you burp, it tastes like blueberry pancakes! I can't wait to share this beer with a few friends."
"D/O- In celebration for purchasing my third (ha) car. Enjoyed this one, especially how it felt in my mouth, although the blueberry aspect was lacking it seemed. Thanks MammothBrew!"
"Poured into a goblet. The beer appears as a deep mocha brown bordering black held up to the light with a nice coffee head. Smell on this one was great. Blueberry was very pronounced for me up front with some roast coffee in the background. In the smell I felt like I was sitting down to some blueberry pancakes with a cup of coffee at the ready. Taste did not deliver quite the overwhelming blueberry flavor that I picked up on it the aroma, but it was still present. Some standard roast malt and chocolate was present as well. Not the thickest stout by any means but a nice medium profile in mouthfeel which almost seemed more appropriate since its a fruit stout. Overall I really enjoyed this beer and could see picking up a four pack each year on its release to have something different available."
"O - I love Dark Horse but this beer is less than I was hoping for. A decent stout, but lacking as a fruit stout IMHO."
"3/2/2011"
" This stout has a moderate malt sweetness on entry with mild bitter tinge and sweet element of blueberry -the blueberry tastes like natural fruit, not extract with elements of spice from the hops and gentle bitter tinges. The caramel and dark malt flavors form a solid base for the blueberry to be supported by with mild toastiness and semi-dry flavor as it finishes. I really enjoyed this and think it has just enough blueberry without going overboard and losing sight of the base stout. I am a fan of blueberry so I could probably enjoy it in any style as long as it is done well. I think Dark Horse did a great job of combining the two flavors."
"As an American Stout lover, this is one of the best. Perfect dark head on this one with the rolling bubbles that suggest perfect carbonation. Dark as hell. The nose is beautiful with a touch of fresh blueberries, not some sweetened blueberry flavoring. And that is the key for this beer. It has a subtle flavor of blueberry that backs off with age. It is not overshadowing the important qualities and characters of a dry stout. I highly recommend this one for all beer lovers. I would love to find this guy on tap as well, especially nitro."
"O - Pretty good fruit stout, the first I've ever had for sure. Even if you think it's odd, it's definitely worth a shot."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy."
"I'm very glad I got to try this beer. It's definitely my favorite from this series so far."
"O - WOW. What a unique brew! This one is like no other I've ever had. Hands down one of the more amazing fruit brews I've ever had. I would love to have more of this brew come my way in the future! Thank you AndyAvalanche for an awesome ship."
"I never would have thought to put blueberries in a stout, but Dark Horse did a great job with this brew, truly unique."
"O - By far the best use of blueberry I've had in a beer to date. I really hate smoke, but I think in this case the smoke and heavy roast helps the beer from being too sweet."
"O - I usually opt out to beers infused with fruits that aren't lambics or what have you but this was an exceptional treat. Never would have thought that the malt base would do so well with the blueberries. Really a treat in a glass, I wish I had some muffins to accompany this beer."
"O - Very impressed with this beer. Great job of creating a beer with a huge blueberry aroma without an overwhelming blueberry taste. Skeptical at first, but would certainly buy this beer again."
"All in all a top notch American Stout and it shows what American brewers can do with non-traditional ingredients. A winner."
"Blueberries on the nose, allthough my wife swears she smells only black licorice, and tastes only black licorice. Taste is all blueberry up front (to me), coffee after i've swallowed. The after taste is better for me then the in my mouth taste. The taste transition from blueberry to coffee is pretty cool though. Very different. much sweeter than i like from a stout. Something that any stout lover should try at least once based purely upon the peculiararity of it, allthough once was enough for me."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is high. Overall it was a pretty nice beer, the blueberries really worked well for it. I especially liked how they interacted with the bitter, roasty flavors. Definitely an interesting and tasty beer overall and one of the better fruit stouts I've had."
"Up for review is a bottle of Tres from Dark Horse. Enjoyed at room temp in a pint glass. Pours a nice black with an espresso head. A sweet, milky stout with some artificial blueberry. Body drinks well, lacks complexity. Not bad, but nothing great either."
"This is drinkable, but the blueberry flavor seems a bit artificial. It's not a complex stout, but if you like blueberry muffins, you'll like this one."
"Pours a thick opaque black with a nice 2 inch dark khaki head that fades to a small cap. Thick frothy lace that drips back down into the beer on the drink down. Smells exactly like chocolate covered blueberries. Awesome. Taste is pure bittersweet dark chocolate covered dried blueberries. A very complex balance between the roasted and chocolate flavors and the blueberry. An almost perfect level of carbonation leaves this beer feeling very crisp yet smooth and creamy. Overall, this is a shockingly exceptional beer. I was expecting this to be way different with a fake tasting fruit flavor. This is a beer I could drink all night long without getting tired of it, especially at the 4.5% ABV it has. I am super glad I have 2 more bottles of this in my cellar to enjoy at a later time."
"O - I love almost everything about this beer. It looks great. It smells great and is creamy and thick. The taste could use a tweaking to make this a phenomenal beer."
"Overall I found this to be a very interesting and enjoyable stout. I really did not think that a blueberry stout would be something that would interest me that much, but this beer turned out to be well made and has some very nice flavors. This is not something I would drink all the time, but I definitely recommend you pick up some and try it for yourself."
"I bought this beer a couple of times over a year ago and would love to find it again. It's a nice combination of a very dry and bitter stout with the perceived (aromatic) sweetness of blueberries making for a phenomenal balance. I usually prefer a hefty stout with twice the alcohol, but this was just as satisfying. I'm glad to see it get good ratings, since the blueberry thing might pigeonhole it with some people as somewhat of a novelty. And I didn't even think of myself as much of a blueberry fan before trying it."
"O - This is a nice sweet treat. Certainly unique and fairly well crafted. This is a beer that I'd pick up from time to time if I saw it. It would be nice to keep on hand."
"This beer pours a color of pitch black night, no hint of anything but black. Not much head to speak of, maybe a tight layer at the rim. Not overtly carbonated, but that was ok because the mouthfeel wasn't terrible viscous. Thought it could have used some more carbonation and heavier mouthfeel. The nose is wonderful blueberry. Not much more than that with a hint of caramel maltiness. Not as much blueberry on the taste, kind of not loving the flavor as much as the nose. The malty roasty flavors I like in a stout aren't really prevalent. Overall good beer, glad I tried it, wouldn't seek it out."
"O: a relatively light, well-refined stout that matches well with pastries of all forms. Dare I suggest one for breakfast?"
" I wish the flavor had followed through from the aroma — I could use more berries. Decent, but not as good as it could be."
"I'm midway through my backwards through the Dark Horse stout series and I'm a big fan of each one I've had so far. They've definitely been in the same family, but more like cousins than brothers. A great series from a brewery I haven't been wild about until now."
"Overall: a good stout to revert to every now and again...not much of a session stout though....cheers!"
"O: I was a bit disappointed with this beer. I thought there was some real potential in adding a hint of blueberries to a stout, but in the end the fruit was a bit to dominant for me."
"Overall I really liked this beer and it tasted just as good as it did a year ago. This beer had some complexity to it and had great balance between roasty stout flavors and freshly picked blueberry's. I thought the combination of blueberry's worked really well with this beer, it really makes it stick out from all the other stouts on the market, one whiff of this and you know it's not your average stout. I am going to have to go back to the store and grab another four pack before this beer disappears till next year. If you like your stouts with a twist and are looking for a fruit stout done right look no further this one is on point. I find a lot of fruit infused stouts don't turn out that good and taste artificial, well this one doesn't, Dark Horse hit the nail on the head with this brew. This is my favorite beer from the their stout series, don't pass this one up."
"Pours a dark thick color with a finger or so of thick, dark foam that lingers. The blueberries come through best on the nose on top of the large roasted scent of the barley. Only a hint of blueberry comes through in the flavor profile, but it is there, especially lingering at the end between sips. The main flavor is of a robust, roasted stout. The mouthfeel is pleasantly thick for the style. Overall, this is a pretty darn tasty drink, and the low ABV lends itself to being a good session beer."
"O: I am pretty impressed with this. I really like the way the blueberries play with the chocolate and roast. And at only 4.5%, I could have a few of em. Reccomended. Skal."
"O- Started off well but I was expecting more blueberry. Pretty standard stout but I was surprised how much flavor they packed in for such a small abv."
"O: A nice take on a blueberry beer. This one shows a lot of promise at the beginning and middle but starts to fall apart a bit towards the end. Finish is too sweet and leaves a filmy, powdery feel right at the end. Nice and definitely worth seeking out but could also use a little work."
"Pours a pitch black with a medium brown head. Very nice looking beer. Scent is very unique! Strong blueberries up front, followed by chocolate and coffee. Taste is a lot more delicious than I was expecting. Great blueberry flavor followed by coffee and dark fruits...then some chocolate and roasted flavors. Finishes with more blueberry. There is strong sweetness throughout. So much flavor for such a low ABV beer. Mouthfeel is pretty standard for a stout. Not to thin, and not overly thick like an imperial stout. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a beer that I could not compare to anything else I've ever had. Extremely genuine and delicious!"
"Mouthfeel is fairly thin for the style. Carbonation is on the high side making for a fizzy/odd mouthfeel. I'm in the minority here but I thought this was an awful beer. I normally don't slam a beer like this but it tastes like blueberry soda mixed with bad coffee."
"M and D - Sits thicker on the palate than expected, again calls to mind a much bigger beer than it actually is. Creamy, full mouthfeel, finishes dry and with a hint of sweetness. A pleasure to drink, I'll definitely be looking for this again."
"This brew, and the others in the line, are good, but so burnt tasting. It is difficult for me to pick out other traits when the roast character is so prevalent. However, at 4.5% this one could easily be an Imperial Stout, except that it doesn't have a big alcohol character, which helps to balance the big roast, by not having more than one extreme characteristic."
"For only being 4.5% ABV, the Tres drinks like a much bigger stout. Not necessarily that there are overwhelming hints of alcohol, but something seems too over the top big for such a small beer. I would revisit for sure, but not something I could sit and drink for more than one pint."
"I have mixed feelings on this beer. I was enjoying it with the exception of the carbonation so I tried to swirl it down which didn't seem to help much. A good swirl brought forth some off, almost stale aromas and the flavors seemed in disarray, too. I'm taking it with a grain of salt as I otherwise enjoyed this beer; I've simply never encountered this before."
"The aroma is particularly good on this stout; there is a lot of fresh blueberry aroma, along with nutty, chocolaty, and yeasty aromas to compliment. The beer pours with a very deep black color and a head that stays around the rim of the glass leaving a swirl on top of the beer. From the smell I expected this to be very fruity, which in it's own right it is, however not in an alcipop sort of way. The initial flavors are of a very strong and bitter stout. Flavors that hit the tongue right off the bat are a little overwhelming but very nice to pick through. The blueberry introduces the beer at the tip of the tongue while strong flavors of wood and dark roasted coffee take over. The back of the tongue gets a deep almost burnt malt flavor which dances well with the hop bitterness. The flavors are so intense that it reminds me of an imperial stout! The palate is almost bizarre as the beer slides across your tongue but is somewhat harsh going down. Overall this is absolutley worth a try (or even a case)"
"D - Tres smells, tastes and feels like a much bigger stout, but without the alcohol heat. While I didn't get much blueberry, this was a fine stout regardless."
"(bottle courtesy of jcnd9803). Pours black with 2 finger chocolate head. Lots of fine carbonation bubbles. Aroma has dark chocolate, blueberry, roasted coffee. Taste is sweet-and maybe a little sour-with ripe blueberries intertwined with a roasted bitterness. Medium bodied with a creamy texture. Slightly bitter finish. A nice beer, but wish the blueberry was a bit stronger. Still, I like this this quite a bit."
"D - Very drinkable. Not sure what I was expecting here but this is a solid stout. Glad to get a chance to try it and certainly would have more."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and full. The mouth pucker is weird but not a killer. Finish is drier than usual for the style because of the fruity character, but that's ok. The beer is drinkable as well, although not as drinkable as other stouts out there due to the blueberry effect on the mouthfeel. Abv is not noticeable, and finish is good though it could be better. Great fruit stout, as there aren't many that can pull something like this off."
"Half pint at Black Swan Brew Pub, Plainfield, Indiana. Poured a very nice deep brown, near black, but with no head and very little lacing. Nice stout aroma, with decent roasted grains, along with a huge blueberry scent; mingles together nicely. Decent flavor, but the blueberries almost completely overwell the stout; you do get a bit of nice roasted grains, but mostly it's berry. Goes down fine, nothing grand, nothing bad. Wish it has slightly less blueberry, since this was a blueberry stout, and not a stout blueberry."
"This is the last of the stout series I had yet to try. I thought Too Cream Stout was good, but this is phenomenal! Jet black, orange-tan head. Robust, roasted coffee and dark chocolate with a whisp of fresh blueberries. Flavor is brief blueberry that explodes into roasted coffee, patent malt, toffee. Brief end of blueberry/fruitiness and finishes deep roast, malt bitterness. Carbonation that bounces flavor off the taste buds. This is not a fruit beer! However, the blueberry lends a complexity and finish like no other. Absolute mastery! If you haven't tried the stout line from Dark Horse - go out and try them! But save this one for last! Stout that is extremely and dangerously drinkable."
"Thanks to hurfer for the extra. Poured from 12oz bottle (no date stamp) into snifter glass. Pours a silky black with a creamy, dark brown head and a tight ring of lace. Aroma is wonderfully unique with huge notes of fresh blueberries backed by roasted malts, dark chocolate, earth, and a bit of peat with hints of coffee and cinnamon oatmeal. Flavor is great as well, never tasted anything like it really. Tastes like blueberry spiked coffee with notes of dark chocolate, roast, and dry barley with a hint of ash. Palate is medium bodied with solid carbonation and a dry, blueberry/coffee finish. Overall, one of the most unique fruity stouts I've tasted!"
"D-Easily drinkable, I highly recommend this beer if you ever have the chance to try it."
"This is the first fruit-stout I've had, and it is better than I expected. It is heavy enough to only want one, but I'd be happy to have another."
"Drinkability: Impressive. Not a big fan of fruits in my beer, but this one works very well."
"A great beer. So happy to receive this as an extra and will be looking for more."
"Medium mouthfeel and a good carbonation level. Drinkable yes"
"HV"
"Drinkability: I really liked this beer other than the after taste. I don't think I'd have more because of it."
"I was quite impressed by this beer. Wasn't gimimicky, just plain good. Surprised by the amount of flavor in a stout comparable to Guinness in terms of alcohol content. Great beer."
"Overall a real nice stout that is really different, but really good. The low alcohol allows you to just sit back and enjoy it with no worries. This is an excellent stout that I will definitely drink more of. Well done Dark Horse."
"D: Very good. Nice combination of flavors and absolutely delicious!"
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, a bit creamy and sticky on the tongue. I was surprised to find out the ABV on this beer after I had it, especially since the body was still full enough to hold the beer together. I was expecting the blueberries to wreck the flavor, but the chocolate and malt played nicely with this."
"It pours black with dark brown edges. Thick and creamy head of decent height. The color of this topper is unique as it is brown- but has this interesting blue tint to it. The promised blueberry is present in the nose but blended well with notes of bitter chocolate, roasted malt, and a dab of caramel. This definitely has all the flavor of a good American stout. The bitter chocolate and roasted malt is in there, mixed with a shot of coffee and a dab of blueberry. The blueberry takes a backseat in this stout which is nice. I'm not sure of the IBUs but there is a moderate hop presence but hardly noticeable. Medium/full body and the medium carbonation play perfectly in the mouth. Very, very tasty and low ABVs make this very, very drinkable. Seek this out while its available- I am getting more immediately."
"Drinkability is moderate as I can't see a lot of faults with this beer but also no stand out characteristics other then smell."
"I could drink this all night, don't get me wrong. But it definitely wasn't near the top of my favorites."
"Pours jet black with a chocolate brown head. In the aroma, hints of sweet blueberry and roasty sweet oatmeal. In the taste, sweet roasty oatmeal, with just a hint of blueberry. A small hop bite, and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry sweet oatmeal in the aftertaste. Small blueberry notes, but more oatmeal stout like, but quite nice."
"D= Drinkability I rated higher because decent price,Low ABV and the Taste is really good."
"D: I'd classify this a well-done gimmicky type beer. It's something you want to try and enjoy once, but not something I'd want more than once in a while. Strange, but when thinking of a food pairing, I keep thinking this beer would work great for breakfast with a plate of blueberry pancakes."
"Pours a black color with huge dark chocolate head that holds for quite a while. It looks as appealing as any beer I've seen. The smell is strongly of roasted malt, with slight hint of chocolate and blueberries. The taste is fruity, but not of blueberry. The ""stout"" in this beer still shines through more than anything else but it's unlike any other tried. Moderate bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy from the rich head that is still persisting. Drinkability is good. This is a solid stout and a unique beer. It's not one I'd pound all night long but good work by Dark Horse here."
"SjG"
"I ""plead the fifth"""
"D: A nice dessert treat, but I don't think I could drink this all night."
"Drinkability -- Surprisingly good. The blueberry character is really fresh and natural. Actually, I really like this, possibly more than One and Too. I don't know if I would drink this regularly, but this is one of the best fruit-flavored stouts I've ever had."
"Overall I like how Dark Horse worked the blueberry into this one."
"This is one crazy tasting beer. I think there is a time and a place for this one, I wouldn't want to drink it all the time, but I think it is a very successful combination of one my favorite fruits with beer. The blueberries are surprising, despite the smell. The bitter flavor offsets the sweet and sour blueberries wonderfully. This beer is full and heavy in the mouth, with moderate carbonation. I really think this one is delicious. I did not expect to like this beer as much as I do."
"D: Fairly drinkable but the sweetness of the blueberry drops the drinkability a little."
"D: A mostly hit or miss beer across its individual categories, the blueberry intensity here (without a great flavor to back it up) was just too much for this one to go down easily at all."
"D - Was impressed by how creamy and roasty this beer was but really expected more fruit flavor. Still if your looking for a ""flavored"" stout this one is perfect. Harsh yet mildly sweet with subdued fruit flavor. Awesome."
"Drinkability: Never would have guessed that blueberry and a stout would go so well together. Just fantastic."
"Very drinkable and delicious to say the least."
"Drinkability is great! I honestly went into this thing thinking that it would be tasty enough, as I have really liked the few Darkhorse brews, but this far exceeded my expectations. It's a great brew! I sure hope my buddy up in OH sends another bottle or two next time *wink wink*"
"A very enjoyable stout. The flavor is the highlight of the beer with the blueberry mixed in quite nicely."
"d - Overall this is a really nice stout. I loved the nose and really thought the blueberries came through in it. I think the bitter chocolate and coffee muted the blueberries in the taste a bit, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. Would certainly have again."
"D: At 4.5% this is one of the best drinking and looking at that low of a threshold. Very well done."
"Well done, Dark Horse."
"Verdict - Despite being slightly watered down, it is a perfect mixture of blueberry taste. It was different from any other dark fruit stout or porter I've had before. Definitely worth checking out."
"D: As stated above, I didn't feel compelled to write until this evening. Has a light viscosity, no cloying, no syrupy/sugary sweetness. Drinks well, finishes better. Blueberry as stated, very prevalent, but in an encouraging manner. Certainly going to give this another run, Well done Dark Horse. I loved the Too Cream. This was better. Congrats."
"Poured into a pint glass. This is a thick opaque black; creamy with half an inch or so of head. Smells like what you'd expect a chocolate covered blueberry to smell like. Taste combines semisweet dark chocolate with light blueberry. Mouthfeel is light and well-carbonated. There's almost no alcohol presence here making for excellent drinkability. I like this.. very well done."
"At Smokin' Joe's this beer was amazing, dark roasted malts bring out that dark chocolate/slight coffee hint. As the nose opens up you realize there's a nice earthy blueberry character taking hold, low alcohol minimalizes interference from other flavors. Overall you take the first sip and you realize dark roasted malts/creaminess/blueberry all at once almost overwhelming but excessently awesome version of a fruit stout. I will grab a four pack when available in OH, but this version on tap at Smokin' Joe's was my beer of the night. Mouthfeel was creamy alcohol was smooth or non-existent on the palate, excellent version of a great beer. Drinkability overall was Class A, the type of beer I want to experience again and again from today's craft brewing industry...you can just tell this beer is labor intensive."
"Overall- Absolutely incredible beer, the blueberry is fresh and natural. Almost too drinakble. Fairly simple when you really think about it, but this is one of my highest rated beers, there is nothing I can really knock it for (except for the lame label)!"
"Blueberry Stout.. What!!. For a long time I passed this beer over for other ventures. My bad it seems, for this is a really good brew. Blueberries (not overpowering), chocolate (maybe). I don't know, but I do like this beer. A new go to for me, well done dark horse."
"This pours a medium bodied black with a one finger, creamy dark khaki head. It looks like it should. The aromas are of light blueberry, bitter chocolate, and light malty sweetness. You definitely pick up the blueberry first but it isn't overpowering by any means. The flavors too are blueberry upfront followed by both sweet and bitter chocolates and a mild coffee roast. The blueberry presents itself well here as well. This beer drinks very, very smoothly and is overly drinkable. The flavors and aromas are presented quite well and get the blueberry across in a light and appealing manner. This is one of Dark Horse's better offerings and worth a try."
"D- definately drinkable beer. I don't know about wanting to drink this all night but a few of these to enjoy is a ok to.me."
"Would definitely drink this again."
"Not bad at all. Am I buying again? No. Did that, drank that, tossed the bottle."
"D - A bit too dry to be very drinkable, and I wish there was more blueberry flavor in it, but it's still good to drink."
"Drink is good, no real heavy, overpowering, or off flavors. The blueberry flavor and especially aroma is a little heavier than desired, but doesn't really effect drinkability. Def sessionable when it comes to booze and smoothness."
"Drinkability If I had a case..."
"D - I like that this is a low-ABV high-flavor beer and really wish DH would make this a year round brew (that would probably make it less special in the lineup though)."
"Drinkability: Wow I really like this beer. The blueberry really goes well with the roastiness of the stout. The blueberry tastes natural and not syrupy--yet the beeriness is still there. Could have several. New favorite from the brewery."
"M/D - Bittery aftertaste. Nice carbonation. Leaves a touch of a tingle, but a dry aftertaste. Glad I got a taste."
"Interesting idea, just not executed very good. Pass."
"D - Wow, just wow. I need to get some more of this. Infact, I'd love to keep this in the fridge and have it year round. There is great stout qualities here with some really tasty real, natural blueberry aromas and flavors. Definately need more of this!"
"D- its an okay stout, i feel like the blueberry should have been more pronounced, its not bad for a stout but i feel like if you call it a blueberry stout you should be able to taste some blueberry"
"T. Get some chocolate, than some coffee, followed by some blueberries and a little hint of hops and some roasted malts.. The blueberries balance nicely with the chocolate and coffee to give this beer a nice pleasant taste. The mouthfeel is a creamy feel that ends on the dry side after the last drop is swallowed, and with a 4.5% alcohol and not being too filling makes this a nice six pack to take to a party."
"DB- Alright flavor after a very nice aroma. The fruit flavor feels more artificial in the taste, it doesn't blend very great with the huge stout flavors present."
"Drinkability is good here, as the flavors are mild enough and clean enough to please. This brew could pass as a dessert brew, although it could stand for a bump in ABV to beef it up."
"drinks surprisingly well. I was going to pass on this one as most fruity dark beers have been not for me, but I'm glad I gave it a shot. would revisit. would probably go well with certain culinary dishes as well. will keep that in mind."
"A one of a kind beer that is well done. Maybe sessionable, but the roast may prevent it a bit. Dark Horse is becoming one of my favorite breweries with beers like this one."
"D: Love this. Could drink many more."
"I absolutely love blueberries, however, this just didn't agree with me. I haven't had another blueberry stout to compare this to, so maybe the flavor I'm picking up on is simply a product of combining roasted malt, hops, and tobacco, and is rather typical. I really wish I had liked this more, but it's just not for me."
"The blueberry flavor is clearly there, not ridiculous like drinking some weird acai-blueberry crap at your health club. This beer is balanced giving you enough roasted malt and blueberry to make you think of blueberry pie. And for us Michiganders, blueberry pie at Christmas, made from berries from the falls harvest is... well there I go romanticizing beer again. Just drink one!"
"yet not a bad one for when you have a bit of a cold, i guess. the charcoal can cut through just about anything."
"Overall - Quite an interesting combination of blueberry and stout. I wasn't sure what to expect but was happily surprised. Not sure how old this bottle is, but it's held up well. I found this beer was better colder, and became harder to drink as it warmed. Regardless, worth a shot."
"The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is roasted malt with a touch of blueberries. There is not as much fruit in the aroma as I expected. The flavor is different, as the fruit is much more apparent. I get a lot of blueberry character as well as some roasted malt and a touch of smoke. The beer has a slight medicinal tastes, but it works OK in this beer. There is a strong, lingering blueberry aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - high hopes after a strong start falls just a bit short. might work well as a dessert or even breakfast beer, split with a friend."
"Dark Horse's Tres taken as a regular American stout is really good, add in the blueberry aroma/flavors and you got something special. Easy drinking as far as stouts go, not much alcohol but a ton of flavor."
"Great mouthfeel. Easy drinking and not too heavy. The best non Russian or Imperial stout I've had in a long time."
"An excellent stout though with some weird carbonation and a fair level of sweetness I don't know if I could have this one all night."
"Pretty good stout that really showcases the blueberries. Well worth a try for something unique."
"D: Pretty good stout but not one I would want to drink very often. Blueberry works well with the roasted character of this beer, but it's not that noticeable and doesn't really add enough to this beer to make me want to choose it over a number of other stouts."
"Bonus points for drinkability for low abv while maintaining flavor and great mouthfeel."
"The flavors are all very bold. I couldn't see myself sessioning this beer but I would definitely enjoy the two or three that I'd have before I was done."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. I'd buy a lot more if I could."
"Beer is medium bodied and mildly fruity / sweet in the palate. Not sure what to think about it. It is really quite bitter. I am not really enjoying this beer and I'm glad I split it at this point. Not a repeat. Didn't taste like blueberries or smell like them. What a wreck."
"D - This is the second bluberry stout I've tasted and this version blew the other one out of the water...it was like putting dark chocolate on your blueberry pie"
"D: No problem to have quite a few of these!"
"D-I was expecting a blueberry explosion and didn't get it but nonetheless a good beer overall and worth getting again."
"D - Not too heavy a stout, and it shouldnt be at only 4.5%."
"Thanks very much to grownfool for including this as an extra in our recent trade. Pours nearly black with a 2 inch tan head. As advertised, smells like dark roasted malt, blueberries, and a dash of cocoa. Quite nice for a stout consumed on a summer day. The flavor is in accord - charred malts, blueberries, and cocoa. Never had a blueberry stout before, but this definitely works. Blueberries aren't so strong as to push this into a nasty fruit beer mess, nor so subtle that you barely notice them. Nor is this beer excessively sweet. Body is medium with lots of carbonation. If this really is only 4.5%, it's surprising, as I would guess it's more like 6.5-7%. Overall, quite a tasty beverage that I'd try again if I lived within distribution range."
"I expected more blueberry taste but it did well as a subtle note adding to all the chocolate deliciousness. Overall awesome."
"D: One of those different/interesting beers that actually was quite good. I look forward to having another one of these."
"D-One of the best beers I've had in a while, and one of my new favorites. I miss American beer."
"Full bodied with a nice creamy texture that adds fullness and complexity. Verydry and roasty with hits of bittersweet dark chocolate, coffee bean and burnt toast hut this is balanced out by subtle dry spic and swee dark fruit. The bluberry presence is evident but not verly sweet balancing outthe roasted malt notes very well. Slight alcohol warmth onthe finish. Pretty drinkable for how heavy it is."
"Black. Nothing comes through when holding to the light. Rich tan head forms on a pour but it dissaptes to nothing quickly. Yep, there are blueberries in there! Fruity boo berry cereal aroma wafts from the glass. It's not a bad aroma at all, just different for a beer. If this beer were a standard stout it would be an amazing one. With the blueberries it makes it interesting and a nice change from the ordinary. Nice rich velvety stout, a bit on the sweet side, a touch of roasted coffee and cocoa. Blueberry is not overwhelming, just a nice touch. Mouthfeel is full and rich."
"D: Pretty decent and certainly easy to drink at 4.5%. I'm glad this wasn't an overly sweet beer, but I was expecting more blueberry flavor. Happy to try, would drink it again"
"I let some of the beer warm up quite a bit while distracted with other activities and most of the blueberry flavor left, which might explain the reactions of several recent reviews. Take note: this should be poured around 40 when the blueberry smell and flavor is more evident."
"Pours a very nicely carbonated opaque black, topped with an appropriate amount of mocha colored foam. Roasted malt, chocolate, and as it warms fresh blueberries. The blueberries are very nicely integrated into the flavors of bitter dark chocolate and espresso. Another nice one from Dark Horse."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and thick and this drinks pretty easily. If this weren't labeled with the word ""blueberry"" it would score pretty highly. As it is though, as drinkable as it is, it is only worthy of a B."
"Dry taste, but without bitterness or hopping usually. The roast from the malt has a little too much contribution though. Once you get accustomed to it, it approaches a smooth mouthfeel. Not a thick sludge stout by any means. A great palate cleanser relatively speaking (as long as you aren't drinking other fruit beers I guess). Minimal coffee feel. Not overly sweet like bad fruit beers. Still tastes like beer."
"Dark Horse Brewing Company has a nice thing going with the Stout Series. I really like every one of them. I was least excited to try Tres, but it's good. It has a nice solid flavor and works in every respect. I do think a little more body and fewer bubbles would help, but otherwise it works. If you haven't had a chance to check out the series, do so. It's impressive."
"Overall, I thought it was an unexpectedly nice brew. Was not expecting to like this one as much as I did. The blueberry balances the flavors within this brew better than I imagined. For those who don't like an all out stout, and enjoy fruity beers, this could be a huge hit with you. That said, I love the heartiest of stouts and this brew still appeals to me. Definitely a unique stout worth trying."
"Thanks to Steve for the bottle and a great drive-by trade!"
"Thanks again Jon, for this awesome beer. Now I've gotta go get more!"
"D- I already know exactly what dessert I would pair this with. I think I could only be able to handle this guy in small portions. Extremely complex, pallet shocking and delicious, a great buy!"
"D- killer drink here for sure I haven't had anything like this and at first I wasn't sure what to think but hell if this ain't great."
"D - Goes down easy, which isn't common with many fruit-flavoured beers. This was a pleasant surprise that I would buy again."
"D: another great stout from Dark Horse. They (One, Too, Tres, Fore, Plead the 5th) are all in the same realm as far as the malt profile is concerned, this one takes the sweetness to a much different level which I believe is successful."
"A very smoth drinkable stout. The blue berry comes through in the aeoma and a vey nic hint on the tounge. We bought this beer at our favorite beer store in big rapids. Grunst Brothers. Its also the second time we bought it and will be at the top of our list agian."
"Very tasty brew makes it very drinkable."
"D - I'm very glad I picked this up. Dark Horse is showing me lately that they know what they are doing with stouts. I've had Tres and Too...now I look forward to trying the other two stouts in this series. Highly recommended!"
"I am impressed with this stout. It is slightly lighter in body and alcohol than most stouts I have had, but enjoyable still. My aversion to fruit flavored beers is gone, at least in this stout that is."
"D: Nice and refreshing for summer, not light enough to be a hot summer day beer but certainly a nice spring night beer. Smooth and clean tasting beer. Carbonation is a bit low."
"Blueberries can be quite potent in beer but I was pleased to find that they were handled pretty favorable in this Stout, especially in the taste, where they didn't come off as artificial tasting at all and were well integrated with the rest of the flavors. Just a bit too heavy feeling to be totally sessionable but this was overall pretty nice."
"Pretty good overall. Not awesome, but good. Drinkability is high. 4.5%? Damn dogg! This is a real session beer."
"Hmmm, carbonation is a tad high...and just slight coffee flavors. A late blueberry hits in the aftertaste. This is at fridge temp. As it warms it gets a lot better and the flavor really improves. More blueberry and mild coffee flavors reside...with a medium to light body, still high carbonation. A very interesting, and tasty stout!"
"Maybe its all of the IPA drinking I have been doing lately but this beer was. not as easy for me to drink as some stouts I have had. It has the heavy, almost chewiness of imperial stouts without the ABV. Just by the magnitude of this beer, I would have expected it to have twice the ABV that it does. This could be a full meal!"
"D- Very drinkable stout that fuses roastedness and fruit as well. Dark Horse just seems to not do wrong with anything they do."
"Drinkability was good as well. I think this is a winner - Dark Horse walks the line without falling into fruit hell. Nice beer, fellas!"
"D - Very easy to drink! I'd recommend this to anyone."
"Drinkability: a strong, moderately complex stout. The blueberry flavor provides a nice change of pace from the traditional variety. The bitter aftertaste will slow me down a little bit, but this is a good stout to rotate into the mix."
"D: The stout tastes bigger than it is. Full and filling, this beer would be perfect on a cold winter night."
"Overall this isn't a bad beer, though kind of disappointing as I thought it would be a little stronger."
"Overall a great, complex, fruit based stout. It is unique to be sure but delicious nonetheless. Not sure if I could drink more than two- perfect for a desert beer. Pick this up if you see it."
"D - Highly drinkable due to ease of taste and low alcohol. Doesn't taste much like beer, think you could give this to anyone, even BMC drinkers and they'd be able to enjoy it pretty easily. Not sure if blueberry is the right direction to head with a stout, think it might work better in a wild ale. A good attempt, solid beer, but it would be great if someone could do a novelty stout like this and make something really kickass."
"Mouthfeel is thin and the beer is a bit too carbonated for a stout. Not bad to sip but needs the right food"
"Overall: The mouth feel is astringent, bitter, and dry. The body of the beer is medium with a medium full finish. This is an odd beer combo but somehow works fairly well. The blueberry stand out and the stout is hidden a little bit. I would have like to seen it be equal."
"single from the Foodery, NL, Philadelphia"
"Pours black with big rocky brown head. Sticks around for a while, but eventually fades. Smell is decent, two-dimensional. Blueberries, and roast coffee. Not terrible, but not melded at all. Taste is along the same lines. Good blueberry notes, on top of a decent stout. Typical roasted flavors with some chocolate. MF is very smooth and oily. I like the carbonation level. Decently drinkable, not something I would want to make a night out of."
"D - Darkhorse has a top notch winner on their hands here... The addition of blueberries makes the a truly unique offering... Wonderfully executed in all facets with many memorable characteristics... If that's not enough, the 4.5% ABV makes this exceedingly quaffable... I wasn't really sure what to expect as my past experience with fruit infused stouts hasn't been positive, but this a top notch offering in every respect... Have I mentioned, I'm really impressed..."
"Excellent beer."
"The taste is dark roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate, and the blueberries are present, but not as strong as I thought they might be. Medium bodied, and average carbonation. A nice easy to drink Stout, which I would buy again."
"Very interesting experience. I have had other fruited stouts and enjoyed them as much as I enjoy this one. The blueberry was an interesting choice and I think it goes well."
"D: Good, but at the end of the day, the blueberry is lost. I will say it was nice that the blueberry was not overdone and the blueberry does work well with this beer, but it is also on the light side, leading to a better than average, but not overly unique stout."
"At 4.5%, this is actually a pretty muscular stout. While you don't feel much alcohol, the big roasty flavors probably limit this to 2 glasses or so - once again proving that ""big beers"" don't necessarily have to be high in ABV. A good idea, and very well executed."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a stiff black malt earthiness as well a touch of chocolate malt sweetness. The blueberry aroma is fresh and damn enticing. There is a nice roasted character here. The taste is decent. It's bone dry with lots of roasted black malts present. It goes down easy with a bit of prickly carbonation. The blueberry flavoring seems artificial; most likely extract, which is disappointing. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is an interesting beer that I believe needs some minute tinkering. It's a good drinker that I wouldn't shy away from buying in the future."
"Pours a rich, dark, near black with a minimal khaki colored head, minimal retention and ok lacing. Smell is of earth, ash, roasted nuts, cocoa powder and blueberry. Dark roasted malts are at the forefront with a earthy, ashy quality to them. The blueberry comes through and does not over power, akin to a blueberry pancake. Hints of cocoa powder and a slight bittering at the end. Body is medium, semi creamy with maybe a touch too much carbonation. Very nice beer where the fruit flavor is neither over or underpowered in relation to the other ingredients, would have prefered a little more body and creamyness to compliment the flavors."
"Overall, a good fruit stout. I would have preferred more fruit character, but the roasted notes are well-balanced."
"Overall- Better than I was expecting. Blueberries are represented perfectly!"
"Notes: I like stouts and I like fruit beers (know I'm in the minority for the latter), so I'm very pleased to announce that Dark Horse has adeptly combined both styles to produce something delicious and unique! However, Tres Blueberry is definitely a stout first and foremost, as any flavored stout should be. It's a stout's stout, which just so happens to taste like blueberrys. Tres Bien!"
"I'd say this beer goes beyond being just a good stout with fruit added but one of the best standard stouts I've had full stop. This is the first beer from Dark Horse I've sampled and color me impressed. I will definitely be picking up more of their beers."
"I got this from Dunt in a BIF. I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It is jet black in color and pours very thick. The head is about 2 fingers and tan in color, minimal lacing. The aroma is slight roasted coffee with blueberry muffins. The flavor is roasted coffee with nice amounts of sweet chocolate. It has enough hops for balnce. The blueberries are there as a background. It finished with a lingering sweetness. It is medium in body and highly carbonated. This beer really worked for me. Very well balanced and enjoyable, I could session with this."
"Thanks again to Prototypic for a great trade and great extras."
"Taste: Blueberry isn't as central in the taste as it was in the smell. Dark chocolate flavor and decent bitterness. Definitely a sipper of a beer to be savored."
"This beer is interesting to say the least and chalk full of flavour. At 4.5% ABV it's would make a great session stout, the fruitiness lending a refreshing quality. I look forward to trying more beers from these guys soon."
"92/100"
"D - Tres surprised me in a lot of ways. It has more body and flavor that I expected from its meager ABV but doesn't have the drinkability that I would have expected. The blueberries aren't overdone, but combined with the peppery notes it doesn't do much for drinkability."
"M/D- Excellent. This is a damn good beer and possibly the most unique one I've ever had."
"Overall, a very interesting and well integrated stout. I liked the addition of blueberry and look forward to trying more of the stouts in the series. Recommended."
"If this beer were available to me all of the time, I would have it by the case. It has as good a feel as most Impy stouts that I've had, it's damn near as flavorful, and it's only 4.5% abv. I want more, a lot more!"
"A really really interesting and complex beer. A great installment to a really great series."
"Thanks to ericwo for sending me this one. Poured out deep black with a creamy two finger head. Smells lightly of roasted malts, chocolate, blueberries and some spiciness I can't put my finger on. Taste is blueberries up front, stout in the middle, then a combination of the two in the finish. It's a nice balance that blends really well. The blueberries aren't too intense or overwhelming and lend nicely to the roasty, chocolaty flavors of the stout. Like a homemade blueberry muffin. Medium to full body, smooth and creamy this one is an easy drinker. Excellent for dessert. I really enjoyed this one but couldn't really see drinking more than one or two of these."
"I liked this very much, I'm leary on blueberry beers because I find the taste to be a lot like morning cereals, but Dark Horse really impressed me with this offering. I would not drink more than one in a sitting even with the low ABV, but I see myself getting this again in the future."
"D: This beer has been done right. Subtle flavors from the fruit, while the style is still portrayed he way it should be. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkable, but, in all fairness, not my favorite style."
"The blueberry stout pours deep black with an extremely deep tan color frothy head that quickly fizzles away. Not much lacing on the glass. Aromas are malted stout smell at the base with a sweet fruity kick that takes over as the beer warms up. I hate to be original, but there is a lot of blueberry in the nose. The quaff also has lots of blueberry in it with a nice crisp bitter finish. I really am enjoying the taste of this beer, something new to me but the sweetness is very well balanced with the malty and bitter notes from this style. Mouthfeel is fairly think. Drinkability is good, not great. For what it is, it is very good tasting just blueberry stout is not something I would want to drink regularly. Overall good beer from Dark Horse."
"Very tasty overall"
"This is medium to fully body. A slight creamy edge. Good carbonation. Very drinkable, especially for the fruit addition. Very nice."
"Drinkable and sessionable. There is so much going on though that you cant help but stop and ponder over the tasty black liquid you are drinking. Thanks to chonyr for bringing this north, its damn good stuff and something i would highly recommend to fans of blueberries and stouts."
"I like dark beers, and this is a fantastic one."
"D- Being on the lower alcohol end of the spectrum for an American Stout make this one pretty drinkable. A good fruit flavored stout."
"M/D - good flavor, medium bodied, good carbonation, i would definitely seek this one out again"
"The mouth on this was stellar. A thick creamy wash over the entire palate. This was almost downright chewable. Flavors of chocolate, roasted nuts, some espresso, and the slightest hints of blueberry. I appreciate the fact that this doesn't smack of cheap fruit concentrates. Wow. I was really impressed with this beer. I daresay I guzzled this one. I wish I had more..."
"D: Good stout"
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate/toffee, slight blueberry. The taste is sweet, malty, very nice touch of chocolate/toffee, picking up more of the blueberry now. Medium body, got some heat for a 4.5 ABV brew, lol Drinkable, very tasty brew, always wanted to try this one. Thanks Bill."
"Opaque black, no highlights or light passing through with a steady thick tan/mocha head that has great retention but very little lacing. Looks like an amazing stout. Rich, complex aroma of a roasted malt, smoke, dark chocolate, a little coffee, etc. Finishes with slightly sweet note of blueberry, not quite as strong as I hoped for, but again smells like a great stout. Creamy medium thick body with minimal carbonation. Flavor begins and ends with mild blueberry sweetness and body has great balanced flavored with strong roasted malt flavor with chocolate, smoke and other dark flavors like the nose. Easily one of my favorite easy drinking beers. I would actually prefer a little more fruit flavor, but otherwise no complaints."
"Pours black and thick, blueberry somewhat natural aroma, and oily roast aroma. ABove avrage mouthfeel, almost no head, certainly no lace. A decent dry stout, assisted by some blueberries. Chocolate is bittersweet. Decent balance and good flavour for only 4.5% abv. Little carbonation. Thanks Jon."
"D - another quality stout from Dark Horse. I really enjoyed this one. The blueberry flavor provides good break from your typical stout flavors. I'll have to buy more of this next time I am in Illinois."
"Drinkability is off the charts. You can sip on this delcious beer all night. There's nothing off putting. And at 4.5% this beer will do you no harm - enjoy!"
"There is plenty of blueberry and grape jelly in the taste, and it is blended harmoniously with bitter chocolate, toffee, roasted chestnuts, and vanilla. This beer is dangerously sessionable and highly drinkable. I had this with a chocolate cake and it paired incredibly. Such a great dessert beer if you like blueberries, and I do!"
"One of my favorite fruit stouts."
"D - highly drinkable. I finished the goblet fast. Delicious."
"EDIT: After warming up, a lot more of that delicious blueberry flavor came out. As a fan of sours and stouts, this is truly a great beer."
"The beer pours amazingly dark, just like the other two to this point. The head on this one comes out fighting. I mean well over an inch, pushing 2. But the bubbles are loose and rush very quickly, pushing the dark liquid up on top of them. Really interesting to see, but if you look away for just a second, the head is gone. The smell, without question, immediately reminds me of blueberry muffins. I mean it's very bready, a bit grainy, filled with overripe, caramelized blueberries. Maybe a day-old blueberry muffin, one that's a little cold. Very good. The smell, if you look for it has a nice roastiness, a bit of dark chocolate, some light coffee smells, some burnt bits. It says it's a blueberry stout, and when you smell it, you can tell. The taste keeps on where the smell ends. There a great burst of ripe blueberry in each taste, but almost no tartness like young blueberries. There's an incredible breadiness, sweet an cakey, but efinitely not too sweet. You get a bit of burnt bread, a tiny bit of chocolate, that's the extent of roastiness. The body on this is nice, not too heavy and full, not like the others, (but I suppose that it's tough when the ABV is so much less), but the carbonation definitely does not have the same burst. as the others. Pretty normal, with a bit of a slickness from the fruit. The drinkability on this is pretty good. I mean, it's not going to hamper further drinking too much, as some flavored beers tend to do, and the ABV isn't too high. But the fruitiness would keep me from coming back to this often."
"I've had the privilege of trying Tres Blueberry Stout on many occasions now and each time I come back to it I am more impressed and gratified. The way that Dark Horse has managed to integrate the tart, tannic, wild and dark berry flavour of the fruit into this classically rich base of chocolate, coffee and roasted malts is nothing short of mouthwatering (not to say downright heavenly if paired with the right dessert). Highly recommended."
"D - Smooth and tasty. This is the most dessert worthy beer I've had in a long time. Doesn't need anything to accompany it, although I imagine it would go extremely well with chocolate cake. Very drinkable - smooth and easy. Have to get more of these..."
"At 4.5% this is a ridiculously delicious beer that won't kill you in the drinking. It also means it has a lighter body than many other stouts and makes it feel lighter and a little less luxurious. That said, the flavor holds it up. It's quite drinkable though the blueberry limits what you can pair it with, more a dessert beer but normally I look for something a little heavier in that category. Nonetheless, delicious all around. Great beer, thanks Viggo!"
"Poured unto my st sebastiaan tuplip. Thanks brian2345 for the extra. Pours black with thin brown head on the edges. Smells of roasted malt, light chocolate, mild fruit, some cinnamon, nothing special. Tastes the same with roasted malt dominating and light fruit. Mouthfeel is very carbonated that finishes with just a slight bittterness. One is good enough for me. Way to much carbonation."
"Roast is much more pronounced in the flavor, with a burnt coffee core that holds up notes of chocolate and toasted caramel. The blueberry is all but an afterthought--a vinous tart note that's overridden by a snappy, almost impeding carbonation level. The body is as thin as you'd expect for a 4.5% stout, with a smooth finish that leaves some sticky residuals as if it were a much bigger Imperial Stout. Still, the low ABV adds to the drinkability, as does the fact that this is a very tasty beer from a solid Michigan brewery."
"The taste was overwhelmingly of blueberry with a sweetness that seemed true to the fruit itself. Some mocha chocolate notes, a slightly understated coffee presence, more sweet than bitter and quite delicious. The real bitterness, although understated, came at the finish with a touch of nutty astringency that lasted quite long. There was a slightly creamy texture and it was a bit thin in body for a stout. I could drink several of these in a sitting, an abundance of natural berry fruit set in a dark malt backdrop,very nicely done by Dark Horse Brewing Company, another winning recipe well worth the $1.99 I paid for it at Merchants in Dearborn; too bad I didn't pick up six more of these!"
"Drinks really easy, would be winner with or without the blueberries"
"Good stuff, glad to have tried it."
"Drinkability: Since I love blueberries I had high hopes for this beer and I was not disappointed. I really like this beer, the flavors just work. This is arguably the nicest fruit beer I've had and I could easily sip it all night. I'm already looking forward to my next one even before this one is finished."
"Bottle. Pours black with a small light tan head. Aroma of blueberry muffins. Also sort of smells like glue...Flavor is lightly roasted with the sweet blueberry/glue. Interesting stout but the blueberry flavor is a bit odd to me. I'll have to try this again..."
"RBSG09 bottle at the grand tasting. Almost black in color with some brown highlights. Tan head leaves a little lacing. Smells like fresh Maine blueberries with a whisper of cocoa. Flavor is darkest chocolate with tart blueberries and a roasted finish. Interesting taste, I like the subtlety. Nice medium body, dry on the palate."
"Drinkability: Thin, low abv, easy session stout."
"Drinkability? I have to say that I'm very happy that this is only 4.5%...it makes the drinkability of this Stout so much easier to call. I could drink a lot of this and not get bored at all. Well done Dark Horse!!"
"T--A very nice session stout, it is hard to pack much flavor into a 4.5% beer though so it doesn't peak my interest too much"
"They need to market this in Maine it would sell great"
"Overall, I didn't like this beer as much as I thought I would. It was way too smokey. I would have rather had more blueberries instead of the smoke. I will not being having this again."
"Mouthfeel is a bit crisp for my tastes, to the point that the initial bite distracts from the taste. A bit of swirling improves things; nice full body."
"This beer drinks very easily, could easily have a bunch of these in a night."
"I am only recently exploring stouts (in the last couple of months) and this is not one of my top 3 or 4, it is certainly the most unique I've had. Very identifiable flavors, super unique, and highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of bitters or stouts."
"D- A unique stout. The blueberry flavors are just enough to be enjoyable without being overbearing. I was shocked to see that this was 4.5% ABV. Thoroughly enjoyable and I would love to see some more flavorful stouts like this at this kind of ABV."
"D - I would serve this beer after a meal for desert! It's almost like having an after dinner treat."
"D: Very easy to drink, likable flavors, lovable feel and aroma. Glad to have tried this, I'd certainly have another one."
"D= awesome. I really love this beer. Its something unique and fun. Ill be seeking more of this out often. Keeps you thinking and is so low in abv you can have a few to study the subtle nuances of such a great beer."
"Tastes the same without being overly sweet. I find this absolutely delectable albeit one glass of this is more than enough."
"I wish I had more of this one, instead of just the one bottle. DH should really think about making this a regular release."
"12 oz. A nice black/brown pour with a surprisingly dark brown head. Head disappates fairly quickly. Aroma of some coffee and chocolate covered blueberry. I didn't think the blueberry was too strong in the aroma or flavor, but others thought it was a bit much in the aroma. Flavor is a good stout roast malt, coffee and chocolate. Blueberry is sprinkled in and definetely has an interesting effect, more in the finish. The blueberry is what makes this not quite as good as the too cream stout. Still stands on its own merits however. An excellent unique brew. All the Dark Horse stouts are a must try."
"Excellent stout from Dark Horse. Most peoples favorite of the Holiday Stout Series, though I'm also a fan of Too. Pick this up if you haven't tried it."
"drinkability is great. a wonderfully rich fruit infused dark brew, which is few and far between. the blueberries impart a subtle sweetness that when combined with the malts produces a brilliant profile. cheers!"
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours black with about an inch and a half frothy brown head. Head retention is good, lacing is OK. The aroma is very nice, it smells like roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and blueberries. None of the aromas overpower the other, which is good. The taste is the same as the aroma, the roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and blueberry flavors all mesh well together and none are overpowering. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich, creamy and coating and is well carbonated. Drinkability is pretty good, and at only 4.5% ABV it's also quite sessionable. This is a very good fruit stout, and I would definitely buy this again the next time I see it."
"What I cracked with my breakfast!"
"I'm a big fan, I think I'll have to see if I can hunt up another four pack around Madison..."
"I really dug this beer. My only other forray into a blueberry beer is the one made by Marin Brewing and that one has never been one of my favorites."
"im not sure i would chase down this beer again but i am very glad i was given the chance to try it. kinda makes me want to play with fruit stouts."
"http://www.youtube.com/user/TheGrandOleHopry1"
"D - An interesting & worthwhile combination between roasted malt and tart blueberry that is worth a try, but its not something I would crave nor purchase often. Kudos to Dark Horse for taking the risk, however."
"Sensational drinkability. I love low-gravity stouts and could session with this all night. I'm picturing an orgasmic cask-conditioned pint of this as I write. Thanks imstillthegman and cheers!"
"Viscous dark brown, almost black, small dark tan head, decent lacing. Love these thick pouring stouts! Aroma is a nice mix of chocolate, coffee and blueberry. Very nice. Like a blueberry muffin and a cup of coffee for breakfast. Taste is nice and roasty, a tart blueberry fruit flavor comes out on the finish mixed with dry baker's chocolate. Semi-sweet at first, dry on the finish. Nice, thick and creamy mouthfeel, appropriately low carbonation. This is a very nice stout. Not quite as good as the Too Milk Stout, but impressive and another great stout from Dark Horse!"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a dark brown with reddish highlights when held up to the light. Very little head, just a slight dusting of dark beige fluffiness and leaving around no lacing. The aroma is like a fruity fudge pop. Dark fudge, cream, and blueberries all come out in the nose. The flavor follows suit almost to a tee. Milk chocolate fudge, cream, and blueberry juice. The blueberries in the flavor remind me more of an artificial blueberry then the actual fruit. The mouthfeel is a bit dry. I thought there might be oatmeal in the mash but the creaminess dies in the finish. Dryness is all I get from the tip of the tongue. This is a good beer, I wish the creaminess would come out a bit more and the blueberry was a bit more real."
"Medium body with mellow carbonation lend some smoothness to the mouth, yet there is a bit of prickliness here and there. Overall very easy to drink with a very intriging flavor. A stout of it's own."
"This was my first Dark Horse brew and i will definetly be looking for more."
"4oz sample - shared the bottle with 2 others. Pours black like the others in the series. No transparency. Nice creamy brown head, which leaves minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas are obvious sweet blueberries, roasted malts, and chocolate. Mouth-feel is creamy and smooth. Flavors are milk chocolate, espresso, and finishes fairly boldly with roasted malts and fresh, ripe blueberries that are not overbearing in flavor - this was something I was concerned with prior to drinking it. They were actually quite pleasant. I liked this unique stout and it was worth the try, given it was in a series of 5, but wouldn't try it again."
"I find that often times a lot of 'interesting' or creative beers offering different takes on a style (or a wildly different take) don't really work (see my Aprihop, 120 min or Autumn Maple reviews). I like to try for curiosity sake, but I don't often love the beer. The Tres, however, is FANTASTIC. The blueberry makes the beer interesting, complex and tasty. I enjoyed this all the way through. A noteworthy beer and now one I need to figure out how to get my hands on with regularity. Damn, fair to say I am blown away."
"This is a rich beer but not a big ABV beer. Still, it is a sipper and one I would not want more than two of at a time. Never the less this is one of the better flavored stouts I have had."
"this is one good stout, not overpowering in any way. i only picked up one and plan on grabbing a few more. super low ABV means drink up!"
"D - I find this to be very drinkable. Great flavor and only 4.5 ABV. If I was the type to drink one beer all night I could do this one easily."
"D: Fair, I would not order another or a six pack."
"Drinkability: Chalk this one up as a happy surprise. I can definitely see myself buying this again."
"It's kind of gimmicky but still a pretty solid brew. Not something where I'd want to have more than one serving."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. Appears a dark brown, almost black color with a hearty finger of rich dark tan foam. Really nice to look at. Smells reminds me of chocolate covered dried blueberries. Kind of like the ones Harry & David sells/used to sell. Notes of molasses and raisins are also evident. Tastes of rich roasted grains, caramel, mocha, and real blueberries. Nothing artificial or fake about the smell and taste of the blueberries. Medium (maybe a touch thin) in body with medium carbonation. Out of the handful of blueberry stouts that I've tried, this is no doubt the best by a huge margin."
"D: very easy to drink, can't pick up alcohol and the flavor tastes nice."
"A creamy warm roasted malt is the base of it's flavor. Dark coffee and chocolate abounds til the blueberry envelopes them in a stately but not overstated manner. The finish is a nice balance of all the flavors that leave enough time to savior but not staying around too long."
"Thanks Dark Horse. Keep up the great, fantastic, work. INCREDIBLE!!!"
"WOW! That is something. Not an overwhelming blueberry taste. This is a thick, strong brew, with great coffee, chocolate, and just the slightest blueberry hint in the after taste. Nothing of what I expected it to be, better! I could get a little sick of the aftertaste if drinking more than one or two, but if like today when I am just having an after dinner drink, this is fantastic!"
"Excellent, well-rounded, and unique stout."
"overall an enjoyable, unique beer (in that I've never had a blueverry stout before...plenty of blueberry beers and stouts, but never together). This easily surpasses a ""black and blue"" combination of guinness and wachusett blueberry (the local favorite). Drinkability could really be higher all things considered, but its an all around pleasant beer - and hopefully one I will drink again. Thanks to weirdbeer for hooking this up in our trade."
"this brew pours up black with a nice brown head. nice lacing. the nose is blueberries, chocolate malts, sweet and roasty malts too. I taste big toasty malts combating with intense blueberry acids creating this crazy battle in my mouth! good but weird in a way. slight hop bittering in the finish. full bodied, med to low carbo. decent. Not Dark Horse's best work but very interesting enough. Hats off...."
"this pours a dark midnight blue/black color with very little head but a great looking amber/ black ring and lacing til the finish..very nice..the smell is blueberry and cocoa first followed by toasted malts and hop smells it tells you this is going to be a different/good stout..the taste is not of strong blueberry just a hint (great) with toasted biscuit ,coffee malt chocolate and cream tastes ..yum! the mouth feel fills the tongue nose and stomach with a superb flavor..this is a very good stout ( easy drinking and low ABV for the style) for me and a great offering from dark horse..BTW 2 of my new favorite breweries are from michigan ... founders and now dark horse..oh and lets not forget BELLS"
"A: Poured like oil, only the slightest hint of light passes through at the edge, definite undertones of blue, nice cream though thin layer of head - 4.75, S: An intense aroma like that of an imperial stout with very obvious blueberries, enticing signs of espresso and molasses mixed what appears to some generous hops - 4.50, T: Quite a clash of flavors large as a result of the blueberries which play a dominant role, concentrated molasses, bitter hops on the tail - 4.25, M: Slight hints of graininess, some creaminess as well - 4.50, D: My second brew from Dark Horse, and like the first this beer excels, an extreme beer packed with flavor and well suited as an after dinner drink - 4.25"
"D: Quite drinkable. I was a little bit skeptical of this one and wasn't quite willing to go after the 4-pack, but was lucky enough to see a single of this. This will definitely be a yearly purchase."
"D: Good, but not something that I would really buy over anything else. There is not enough blueberry in it to make me want it more than a blueberry ale, and the stout is on par with many others available.. Good, worth the try.. but I won't be getting a sixer."
"had it after a year of cellaring. at first doughier. makes way for a wonderful body. blueberry is still there but at first masked by the yeastiness. once it opened up... quite better. earthier... a thicker wall of stout oozing down the side of the pint glass. wonderful job."
"D: The blueberry is here but it seems a bit artificial, what I really like though are the roasty and sweet flavors, I think if you took the blueberry out this would be one hell of an Irish dry stout. The problem of course being this beer is a blueberry stout and it doesn't execute as well as it does in other places."
"D-Quite high. Although I was nervous for a blueberry brew, I am quite pleased. Smooth and blanced fruit flavor add to, instead of overwhelms, the big stout flavor."
"drinkability: i would probably purchase this again. i couldn't drink more than one in a sitting, though. this is a very unique brew. at the very least worth a try"
"D- its nice to see a stout have an interesting taste and be this low in alcohol. this is something i could have several of in an evening. i was a little worried about the idea of a blueberry infused stout, but it came out really well. winter is definitely the best time of year for dark horse."
"Pours a nice pitch black body with an espresso colored head that's not too big and finishes down nice and lacy. Smells like blueberry and malt. Smell not to overpowering, just right actually. On first taste, I could not help but notice how smooth it went down, about the smoothest stout I have ever had on first taste to be honest. On a second taste the blueberry really comes out and as the beer warms, it becomes more pronounced. Probably the best session stout I have ever had. Nice and smooth feel, tastes great, and is highly drinkable. 1st rate stout."
"What an incredible pour into my Sam Adams Sensory Glass. Delicious smell of blueberries. The appearance was remarkable as it looked like blueberry pancake mix poured onto a hot griddle -- with big glob-like bubbles popping all over a two inch purplish head. So it goes without saying, perfect 5s for both appearance and taste. Taste started out with a tinge of blueberries with a burnt stout overtone. Very tasty. Thick taste. Sticks to your teeth. You have to use your tongue to clean off your teeth, it's that thick. Scrumptious good. Mouthful is exceptional and thus the drinkability is very high, too. I'm sorry I only picked up a 4 pack at The Liquor Stop in Highland, IN. This is one of my new favorites. Great Job, Dark Horse !"
"thursday noon 2009 the 2/19.. day off after inventory, time for a treat .. pours a dark brown black, with a pretty head, medium built.. awesome smell, hints of blueberry and other treats .. taste lives up to the wonderful aroma .. blueberry can work so well in beers if done right, this falls in to the the nail and the hammer hitting section, right on! .. i would use a magic lamp wish to try this on draft .."
"Tres was my first fruit stout but will for sure not be my last. Dark Horse has come up with a great combination of flavors that come together nicely. I'd would definitely recommend this beer to my stout drinking friends."
"A good stout and my notes would be more positive if I went into it with the realization that it was based on a 4.5% American stout (ratings adjusted accordingly)."
"Overall: I was not the least bit disappointed in this beer. Has a definite natural blueberry character that mixes with the dark malts beautifully. Very drinkable, but think this beer would benefit from being on cask. Great beer, looking forward to the other three. Another great offering from Dark Horse."
"Thick and rich, tasty treat all the way around. MAN! Would be nice to know the abv - I'm guessing 7-8%, it packs some ass by the end of the bottle, but no hint all though out."
" ~ Unfortunately, the taste of brew is essential for drinkablility in my opinion. Therefore I gonna leave this brew at average. But because of the unique qualities this brew has I will recommend my pals give one a sip."
"Splendid stuff."
"Pretty tasty, but as with most Blueberry beers, the Blueberry is way subdued. The base beer is substantial and enjoyable on it's own."
"mouthfeel is sweet, bitter, roasty, drinks nicely and is a good take on a fruity stout"
"I am normally not a big fan of blueberries (in general) but this beer is very good. I was expecting an fruitier beer; instead the stout style came through nicely."
"D - A tad harsh in my opinion but overall pretty good. Nice session stout and the fruit helps it stand out as well."
"Overall: An interesting beer. The aroma is very misleading, but I think that's a good thing as I wouldn't want a beer to taste like a blueberry muffin. That being said, I think a little more malt sweetness would bring out a little raspberry flavor which would be sufficiently balanced by the roast malts."
"This beer pours jet black with a 3 fingered brown head with some lacing. I was suprised to see a 4.5% beer with such a dark head, and I was excited to taste. This beer has a very large nose, with tons of blueberry and some carmel notes, basically it smells like a blueberry pie/tart. The taste as well is very well composed with a nice amount of blueberries and a nice dark malt base, I would imagine this beer has a much higher % of dark malts compared to other American stouts. The mouthfeel seems a little oily and the carbonation level seems nice. A highly drinkable brew, I will be sure to pick up a few more on my next trip to Michigan."
"The blueberry nose on this one should be envied by every other blueberry stout attempt out there. Not the first time I have been lucky in CT to have this, first review of it though (thanks noreaster). Quite honestly this is an easy drinking stout with a blueberry kick, like a swift jab in the face of blueberry with chocolate goodness to boot. This beer manages to pair a decent stout with an amazing blueberry enhancement. Worth a try I promise."
"BuckeyeSox provided the bottle, and while I've previously passed over this in stores in MI, I will start buying it on future trips. This is very good."
"Drinkability- Darn tasty Stout that is a really cool change of pace. The blueberry isn't something you find every day in a Stout and it's more than interesting. Dark Horse has the Stout thing down (except for the mouthfeel, they need to beef that up) and this is another winner in my book!"
"D: My glass is disappearing fast and this is one drinkable beer. Glad I have another!"
"Poured into a pint glass, opaque black with a graham cracker colored head that retained well. Smells of chocolate, coffee, blueberry and a bit of spice. Taste is predominately that of chocolate and roasted coffee, the blueberry having faded a bit (this is from last year's batch) but still noticable. The fruit gives a touch of sweetness. The feel is a bit creamy and sticky coating the roof my mouth and back of my throat slightly. A delicious stout with a moderate ABV makes this one a beer I could enjoy regularly and in succession."
"Drinkability: This is s creative treat and I wish I had tasted it a week ago as I was at a Dogfish Head beer dinner in Richmond and the couple sitting next to me was trying to think of a good blueberry beer. I had no answer then but I do, now. I only wish it were not quite so sweet."
"A little messy around the edges, and maybe the blueberry doesn't mingle as well as I'd hoped, but ultimately this is delightful enough. And burp it up--the blueberry comes back to haunt!"
"Note for 1/20/08 tasting: As I drink this fresh from this year's batch I can't help but notice that the blueberry flavor is less than when I had it with several months age on it last year."
"This is the last of the stout series for me and this one pours just like the rest, pitch black with a bubbly mocha head that dissipates to a ring. There is little lacing but lots of bubbles rising to the middle throughout. Aroma is surprising for a stout as it smells like a blueberry cobbler with some coffee and chocolate malts thrown in. Fascinating smell. The taste isn't quite as nice as the aroma but still good with the dark roasted malts and bittersweet chocolates dominating. The blueberries are present but not overwhelming, making for a nice, balanced flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with tons of carbonation and leaves the palate tingling. This is right up there with Plead the 5th in the series and this one may win for originality. Great beer."
"Overall, an interesting beer. Not particulary sessionable, but good in small quantities. Nicely done. I certainly liked this one more than I was expecting...and the more I drank the more interesting it became."
"D - Excellent and adventuresome offering from what is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries! There is nothing else like this on the market (to my knowledge). Good, good stuff! Not a session beer though."
"Overall I enjoyed this brew. It would be a good dessert beer. I think I might have to get some of it for the colder months."
"Thanks to brewandbbq for the chance to enjoy this one."
"I've sampled this from the bottle quite a few times and enjoyed every single bottle. This is my first experience on tap and it's damn tasty. Blueberry stout is a beer I would love to see more of. The flavors seem to go together perfectly and Dark Horse did a great job putting this one together."
"The idea of a blueberry stout lowered my expectations, but overall it was great. Who would have thought? What a nice dessert beer. Even without tasting much alcohol, I would have guessed it was at least 7% based on the thickness and rich flavor. The fact that it is only 4.5% is amazing. I would like to have more of this now, and I would recommend it to all..."
"I'd buy a six pack of this brew!"
"Pours midnight black with a great mocha-colored head that settles into a good ring around the glass with some decent lacing. Smells like a blueberry stout, how about that. Blueberry smell up front, some dark and roasty malt notes, maybe a touch of bitter chocolate. The blueberry taste is just right, kind of gets you on the back and sides of the tongue, slight burnt taste through the middle, and a pretty noticeable hop presence. Nice rounded mouthfeel, carbonation is lively, but it keeps things from becoming too syrupy-sweet. Never had anything like this, and certainly a tasty brew!"
"If Willy Wonka brewed beer, this is one he would approve of."
"D-Really nice. Not as sweet as one would think as the chocolate/espresso components really mellow out the blueberry sweetness. A very nicely done fruited stout."
"Notes: Funny story... I had, what I thought was a bottle of this in my cellar. After I managed to find some more the other day, I cleaned out my cellar only to discover I had a bottle of Dark Horse Too, and absolutely none of this. It was a brew I was looking forward to trying, and I'd have been VERY dissapointed to discover that I didn't have any!"
"Thanks to Sprinke for the extra."
"I had high hopes for this beer going in. Pours an opaque black with nice head. Big time blueberry in the nose. Tastes definitely blueberry with a nice American Stout hiding underneath. Very balanced and not too bitter. Hint of smoke and roasted malt comes through. Overall I think it was a great base stout that they just added the blueberry to somehow. Nice full mouthfeel and very drinkable. Highly enjoyed."
"Thanks to iceicebaby for the chance to try this one. Served in a nonic. Poured an opaque brown with ruby red highlights expressed during the pour and with each tilt of the glass. Half-inch mocha-colored head dissipated within seconds into a thin oily slick. Zero lacing present during the tasting. Scent of blueberry syrup dominates with just a subtle suggestion of chocolate in the background. Blueberry flavoring is significantly masked by a strong malt presence, in addition to a well-balanced chocolate and coffee character. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Starts off slightly viscous at the front, but a light carbonation balances it out at the finish. Drinkability is outstanding. This brew went down easy and left me wanting for more. Excellent offering from Dark Horse."
"Pours an inky black with almost no head, burnt orange and tan where it exists though, very little lacing. Smells of fresh blueberries, chocolate, and a touch of cappuccino. Tastes of a blueberry explosion up front followed by a smooth chocolate middle and a mellow coffee finish. Medium to medium full in body, low in carbonation, and very smooth and creamy with a nice unique blueberry twist that is very easy to detect but not detracting of the other flavors. A very different and tasty stout, very dessert-like, as if you dipped a blueberry in some chocolate fondue and chased it with a sip of cappuccino."
"Very creamy and delicious. I'm impressed."
"Pours very dark and thick with a thin beige head. A nice roasted aroma with blueberries standing out. Blueberry touches the tongue, but does not dominate the overall flavor. Finishes with some coffee characteristics. A medium-bodied stout that is surprisingly good for a fruit-flavored beer."
"D: This is an awesome brew because its so unique yet appetizing. Blueberry stout. Awesome. Had this on tap at Hop Devil in NYC and was even better. However, the bottle does not disappoint. Could take down a few of these in a sitting. Love it."
"Not certain I'd run out to get more, but definitely interesting to try, very unique."
"Tasted on 4/5/08. Beer level seemed too low in the bottle (almost all the way down to the shoulder of the longneck bottle), but the beer didn't seem to suffer at all."
"Surprisingly, I think I could drink more than one of these, maybe. Maybe not. I'm impressed with the Dark Horse beers I've had to date & will be seeking out more of them."
"This beer pours motor oil black color. The head is one inch in height, blueish-tan (unlit now I had never known blueish-tan was a color) in color, and recedes very quickly into almost no lacing. The aroma is of fresh blueberries with underlying roasted malt, and graham cracker. The taste is of roasted malt, dark chocolate, blueberries, and has a graham cracker and vanilla finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very good beer. I like how the blueberry is perfectly balanced into the stout. I would certainly drink this again."
"Thanks to autumnaldave for this bonus bottle. This pours practically black, with a very dark tan head that dissipates quickly. Smells of blueberry, molasses, and surprisingly alcohol. Tiny bit of chocolate coming through as it warms. Diving in, there's clearly a solid dry stout flavor profile here - roasty coffee, chocolate, slight nuttiness and faint oak bitterness, but the blueberry sweetness is just derailing it for me. It just dosen't mesh. Liking the dry finish but it clashes a bit with the lingering, increasingly cloying fruit. Bitterness leaves off with a strange herbal twang. Very thin mouthfeel, heavily carbonated - same sort of seltzer-like quality I noted in Double Crooked Tree. Could use a bit more body, maybe an oatmeal version, and maybe dialing back the bitter/dryness. Novel effort, but I'd much rather drink the (clearly quite good) plain old stout here that's been dressed up."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer pours and looks like motor oil with a thin, creamy looking, mocha colored head. The nose has a nice wiff of blueberries on first smell and a deeper examination reveals subtle chocolate and coffee notes. Taste is nice, an intro to sweet blueberry followed by the finish of a dry stout, coffee being prevalent. The mouthfeel is viscous and very lightly carbonated. Drinkability is a little lacking in my opinion, interesting brew but not one I could session."
"A very nicely crafted beer. Well balanced and not overly sweet. I would like to track down some more beers from Dark Horse."
"Generally, I/we like it. I'm not a stout fan like my wife, but this is a better crafted option."
"All in all, I was expecting more from this one."
"D: This is a VERY drinkable stout. The blueberry aroma and flavor keeps it from being too overpowering as a big stout. I could easily put a few of these babys away in one sitting. Delicious! Do you like blueberry muffins dipped in stout? I do."
"Overall, I thought this was excellent and was easily my favorite among all of the ones that I had before. I would love to try this one on tap, as I am sure it would be outstanding. If you can get this it is a must try. One of the best, and most unique stouts I have had in quite some time."
"Pours dark, oily black with a medium sized nice and dark brown head. Smell definitely has some blueberry as well as some rich chocolately, slightly sweet, creamy roastiness. Taste is dark roasty and blueberries as advertised. Very drinkable, and chocolately. Much like dark chocolate covered dried blueberries. Really nice. Slightly sweet, but not overly so. This is a fantastic stout and my favorite Dark Horse beer so far."
"Wish I had more of this."
"Overall not a bad beer. A departure from the norm and good for a change of pace. It's not something I'd buy regularly but its rotation and rarity make it impossible to do so as it is."
"As this tasting was on tap I will add an addendum to this review once I get to the bottle that is currently in my fridge."
"Drinkability: It's actually pretty nice. The flavors contrast and complement each other quite well."
"D - Not a bad beer. The first I have had from Dark Horse and it did not disapoint. Can't wait to find more of these awesome beers."
"While I am not a fruit beer nut I do enjoy a well crafted one, Dark Horse gets it right here with a great balance of sweet to roast and enough blueberry to go around with out being overkill."
"In sum, this is worth trying. Not just for the novelty, but for the true unique effort to pull off this beer. I'd put this near the bottom of DH's stout series. Above the Oatmeal which tastes sour and off, but under the fabulous smoked and cream stouts."
"mouthfeel is creamy, and chewy. Very nice for a dry stout. Blueberry isn't sweet at all, this is just a very well done beer."
"A very interesting stout. Blueberry complements the hearty stout character. Unusual and very interesting flavor. Pick this one up if you get the chance."
"Easy to drink and enjoyable, a unique and tasty fruit stout combination."
" I wish I knew what tha ABV% was, since this didn't have the characteristics of an Imperial Stout or even something closer to Guinness. No matter - I'm glad I tried this and I like the pairing of blueberry with a style such as this. One could call this a ""dark horse"" of sorts, but I don't think that's the case if somewhere in my neck of the woods serves this!"
"So dark that you can't see through the pour. Yields better than a full finger foamy dark tan head that fades fairly quickly, leaving spotty lacing patterns. Hey, guess what it smells like... no seriously... it starts out with a distinct celebration of blueberries then settles out to a low-roasted chocolate stout that sells its edge to the berry. Blueberry's aren't naturally very fragrant. This bottle has a residue on the lip that picks up berry-roast combo as a muffin-like aroma. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is smooth, rich and tingles nicely in a medium body. The flavor is really nice too. A solid stout character that trades what might have been a modestly roasted chocolate flavor with that of the healthy blueberry. The berry taste isn't a big blast, but it lingers long enough to be considered well. Its really a cinch to drink. A little warming on the way down, but otherwise well integrated. This one scores maximum points for imagination!! Besides the New Glarus products, this Dark Horse is one of the first Fruit/Vegetable beers that i wouldn't hesitate to stick in my grocery cart. Thanks BigDaddyWil for the opportunity."
"I could drink a couple of these at once, if i was having dessert or something, but after that it would be too much. Very nice though, would welcome these any time in my house. not sure what the abv is but it is warming going down as well... if i had to guess id go in the 7-8% range."
"Tasting this beer is where its at. The real flavors come out. I tasted strong chocolate and coffee...but to me, these tastes didn't blend well with the blueberry. Slighty carbonated at the end with a fruity aftertaste that mixes with java. It has a thick mouthfeel that envelopes your tastebuds. I would drink this again but i'd be inclined to try something new before ordering this again."
"Thanks to hoppymeal and seaoflament for an extra each of this."
"Pours to perfect beauty with a inky black body hosting a coco powder colored head at two fingers with decent retention. Nose is a welcome mix of opening the bread box to blueberry muffins and zesty spicey malt. This beer comes into the mouth shockingly smooth like a chocolate covered blue berry. malty dark chocolate richness is created by the burnt malt. The blueberries add a slight sweet sour feel happens on the mouthfeel. a dark chocolate bon bon effect is all over the palate also. Overall they did a great job integratin the blueberries without making it seperate. Wonderfully drinkable, solid beer."
"d -- very good beer back to back drinking could come too easily"
"Edit 04/08: Just drank 2 of these from the latest release, and it holds up well after a year."
"This beer is inky black with what i swear is a little bit of purple foam on top. The aroma is of tons of blueberries covered in dark chocolate covered with ground espresso beans. I think that is pretty much how the beer tastes as well. This beer is everything a stout should be; very dark, with a heavy roasted malt character, and an acrid bitterness with the added and welcome addition sweet/aromatic blueberries. The only real flaw I see in this beer is its dissapointing lack of a thick creamy head. Otherwise if blueberry stout is what you're lookin for, it's right here."
"D: This wasnt one of my favorites from this brewery. I could see how some like it but it didnt suit me."
"Drinkability is ok, not really into blueberries but this is not bad. Worth a try certainly. Want to thank merlin48 for this one."
"Pours a complete old motor oil black with a dark brown one finger head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Stickiness is here and there, a bit spotty. Smell is dark chocolate covered blueberries with a hint of fresh roasted coffee. Some woody vanilla notes tingle the nose as well with bit of caramel malt. Taste starts off with a tiny bit of fresh blueberries which is quickly dominated by the big french roast coffee flavor. A bit of an oaky wood taste towards the end with some grassy hop flavors as well. I was hoping for just a bit more blueberry sweetness on the tongue with this one, but still a decent taste overall. Mouthfeel is a creamy medium body with a mild carbonation bite. Very enjoyable beer over all, I wish more breweries would experiment fruit stouts."
"Tres Blueberry Stout carries this combination off very well with a perfect blending of chocolates and blueberries. Nothing fights...everything harmonizes."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a pitch black color stout with a small deep brown color head. Aroma of strong blueberry is well mix with some medium roasted malt notes. Taste is a mix between fresh and sweet blueberry and some roasted malt with a light bitter finish. I am not usually fond of fruit in stout but I thought this mix worked very well and the balance between fruit, sweetness and bitterness from the malt was well achieved. Body was quite full with some light carbonation."
"I will search more of this one out. It was not fresh, hopefully a fresh batch will have a bit more blueberry taste."
"I only wish i could buy this in Chicago."
"I feared the ""blueberry stout"" would be just a gimmick, but it paid off quite nicely."
"I'm a huge fan of Dark Horse's Holiday Stout Series. It's too bad that I only have one more to go. Tres Blueberry Stout is a delicious marriage of fruit and roasted barley. If you're lucky enough to see this stuff on the shelves, don't hesitate. Tres is tres magnifique."
"Sometimes, fancy shit like this works out. This is a sometime."
"Overall impression: One of the best ""fruit"" stouts I've had. I love the background blueberry notes with the stout profile shining strong. All other brewers should take notes on this one. Strongly recommended."
"Very fine looking beer. Black body. Thick crop of deep brown froth to cap it off. Lacing is quite nice...bountiful. Nice aroma. Plump, sweet blueberries contrast with the gritty and roasty black malts of this stout. This beer is about 80% stout, 20% fruit...which is good. It works. The main gist of the of the flavor is deep, dark roasted malts with a nice burnt edge to it. And the sugar coated blueberries give a ghostly presence in the background. The creamy mouthfeel lends to a very drinkable stout. This is good."
"Beautiful smooth creamy black pour with a medium sized dark tan crown. Very tiny bubbles, moderate head retention. Aroma is a huge blast of blueberry filling / syrup, nothing more. Flavorful taste of chocolate blueberry blended nicely with some roastyness towards the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is pretty good. A very delicious dessert beer, good to enjoy slowly, but may not want more than one in a row."
"Pours a very opaque black, dark edges, almost purple, they must have used a shitload of blueberries in this. Almost not head, bit of brown lacing sticks to the glass and rings the edges of the beer. Smell is nice, blueberries to the max, nice roasty chocolate, some spice, very rich, fresh baked goods! Taste is nice roast, some chocolate, burnt flavour, blueberries, prunes, quite nice, little bit weaker than the aroma but still quite something, a good fruit beer. Mouthfeel is thick, very full bodied, low carbonation, bit weak in the flavour, dry finish. Thanks for sharing Jan!"
"D: Well.. I dont know if this may have been a tad off or what. Either way, the bottle that I have is not too great IMO. Not a drain-pour but a definite ""No thanks.."" in the future."
"Overall, if there were points for originality and creativity, this beer would get a 5. One of the more memorable beers I've tried, and good choice for something different."
"Full bodied and very drinkable, this is a finely crafted stout with a nice fruit addition."
"Inky, oily black body with a small, but persistent, cocoa brown head. Where's the blue? Just kidding. Intriguing nose of crushed blueberries, flowers, espresso, roasted malt, and dark chocolate. Very unique aroma created by the floral blueberry aroma and the roasted coffee/malt. And it's good! Taste starts out nice and roasty. Rich, roasted coffee and bitter dark chocolate work nicely together. Hints of floral fruitiness soon become stronger with noticeable blueberry essence mid-palate. Strong coffee bitterness, baking chocolate, and slight roasted grain astringency in the finish. Slightly warming. Medium-bodied (could be a bit fuller IMO) with a dry, slightly metallic finish. Darkhorse pulled this one off nicely. I was leary at first, but I might just have to buy more of this now!"
"It was a dark black color, completely opaque. Head was nude-pantyhose tan, with a hint of blue in some of the larger bubbles. Aroma was toasted malt and blueberries. Taste is a decent amount of ""burned pizza crust"" (which I dig) with an appropriate amount of blueberry flavor. I wouldn't think fruitiness and toastiness would play well together, yet they do. Mouthfeel is quite dry and good. Definitely recommended."
"12 oz bottle pours a jet black body with a small light brown head that scatters some small wisps of lace. Bold aroma boasts blueberry puree and milk chocolate. Nice! Body is medium with moderate carbonation. Taste has subdued roasty malt notes of light coffee and chocolate kissed by a fresh blueberry puree. Very interesting, but it works quite well. The blueberry flavor is subtle and integrates very well into the stout's roasty character. An excellent fruit stout."
"Glad I tried it."
"Dark Horse's Tres Blueberry Stout is an interesting see-saw of a beer, hitting you upfront with a sweetish and somewhat tart blueberry flavor and aroma (there's less in the aroma than the flavor), and then turning spot-on-a-dime and hammering home dark, rich malts with a solid bitterness and roasted character. The fruitiness helps to cut through it and keep it refreshing, or at least interesting, while the blunt darkness of the end-side offers it great depth. Some grassy, leafy hops flutter here and there in the finish, and there's an edge of black coffee ""acrid"" character (but it's not acidic as many beers this dark can be) and dark bittersweet chocolate, but very little blueberry. Odd!!! It's an unusual combination that works, and although I've seen this done with raspberry and cherry, I think that the blueberry might be a better (or at least more distinct) choice because it stands out so readily. And of course we're talking about extract here, but it really makes no difference. It does the job, and it's done nicely. In fact, you couldn't do it with real blueberries, they just wouldn't cut it. They'd ferment through and leave too little behind (and more of a fruit-pulp character than any recognizable blueberry). As for drinkablility however, I'm not sure the playfulness and teeter-totter gentility of this beer could keep up beyond one serving. It's very well done and interesting, but I think I'd have to move on after one or two of these. Certainly worth trying however!"
"Another fine brew from the folks at Dark Horse."
"D- There is not much depth or complexity to this beer and the odd flavor of blueberries taste more like an off flavor that a compliment to the stout."
"It poured a opauqe, dark color with a brown/violet head that disappeared quickly. I could smell the blueberries as it was being handed to me. What a treat. The taste was of chocolate, blueberries, vanilla and roasted malts. The mouthfeel was smooth, thick and slightly carbonated. I found it very easy to drink and a wonderful fruit stout. I would recommend seaking this out. I have also tried the bottled version and it is very similar."
"D- Sweet wins over bitter for this stout, making it a very drinkable beer."
"very nice in the mouth; i really enjoy the subtle but persistant carbonation. almost by definition, i don't think you'd drink more than one or two of these at a time, but this is a very creative beer, and easy to enjoy."
"I'm very new to Dark Horse Brewing Co., but thanks to my friend Dan from Michigan, I'm getting the opportunity to sample some of these wondrous brews. Seek them out!"
"Many thanks to patyoda for sending me this delicious and unique beer."
"I had looked forward to sampling this the most out of the Dark Horse stout series. It did not disappoint. Pours black with a short lived brown tan head that fizzled to nothing. I guess I expected that beautiful head to last a little longer. Anyway, the aroma consists of chocolate and fresh blueberry skins. The taste has a lush blueberry taste to it blended with a rich stout flavor. The blueberry is fresh and real... not at all like a concentrate or syrup. It reminded me of the Jersey blueberries we pick in summer while visiting my wife's grandma in Indiana. The blueberry taste is definitely featured here in the stout and is done without comprising the stout characteristics of the beer. Powdery dry finish to wrap things up. Very unique and if you're a fan of blueberries this is a ""must-try""."
"the flavor is very rich and malty, solid and roasty, good carmelized malt with a solid blueberry flavor but not iver powering. very balanced beer."
" Pours an opaque brown/black with a thin dark brown head. Looks nice. Not very many bubbles. Smells very good, fresh blueberries and roasted malts, nice and smoky. Taste is very aggressive and acidic, heavy on malts and acrid blueberry. Way too tart, not sweet at all. Mouthfeel and drinkability are average."
"D: Like Kidadam says below, I could easily finish off a six pack of these. It is that good. Great balance between the bitter chocolate, smooth oats, and slightly tart blueberries. I was afraid that this might taste cloying and phony. One sip was all it took to allay my fears. This is a superb fruit stout!"
"D - A very nice brew. The blueberry is a great compliment to the stout and not too sweet. I have had several on tap lately and remember them being better than this bottle. I can't wait to try this one on tap again."
"D - Fantastic. I would love to have this again. I would guess that it is about 6-7% abv. Only a little strong for sessioning. This is a stout first and a fruit beer second. The blueberry aspects are subtle and give a unique twist on what would otherwise be only a damn good stout."
"This year's Tres just arrived in South Bend so i thought i'd give it a go. Poured super dark and great-looking. Dark brown head, tremendous lacing make this look like a super good beer. Blueberry is really big on the nose and underneath is a bitter burnt grain odor that i expect from nice bitter stouts. do they meld well? kind of. i can smell the blueberry from three feet away, which is interesting. Taste is pretty interesting too...and it has 3 stages. First its just a blast of heavy blueberry juice, then you get the burnt roasted malt of the stout and then the finish is a nice blend of the two. The blueberry falls more into the background as i drink more and its more of just a good stout. Full, nicely put together beer. Not a great drinkin', swiggin' beer but its made well and interesting to drink. I might even buy it again (although im much more likely to buy the other 3 stouts from DH is i see them soon)."
"Unfortunately the beer is downhill from smell. Simple roasted malt with a heavy dose of blueberries. Black currant, dark chocolate, and some herbal qualities. The problem is this beer lacks depth. Super thin mouthfeel for a stout. Finish is not that greatly palatable. Worth a try but not many after that."
"T: Yuck. It definitely smelled like blueberries more than it tasted. In fact, it almost had a vegetable taste to it that I didn't find pleasant at all. Thankfully the roasted malt takes charge, but still not enough to mask the unpleasantness of it."
"Pours black with a muddy red head, bottle-conditioned. Blueberry aroma is nice, the sweet malts contribute to make it like a blueberry cobbler. There is also some roastiness and a cola-like sweetness. The blueberry flavor is taken over pretty quickly by the roasted and smoky malts in the flavor, although as it rolls on the tongue there is a little blueberry cobbler and blueberry cola flavors. The beer finishes with a tanginess from the malts and a slightly dry bitterness. Good stout, I really enjoyed the blueberry aroma, but the blend of stout and blueberry flavors didn't do as much for me."
"Dextrinous thick mouthfeel with medium carbonation. An enjoyable beer, but a bit dry. Happy to try one bottle, but glad I don't have a 6er."
"overall, despite the complexity, very mild and drinkable. if anything, the base stout is smooth with a subtle roast factor and the berry complicates things. is dark horse the new kuhnhenn, but with better QC? looks like it. this beer is outstanding and should be heralded as such. a real achievement in brewing."
"12 oz bottle. 9 oz sample. Pours a deep dark black color with a half finger of brown head that falls to just a full coat over top. No light comes through the brew, and no carbonation is apparent. No doubt about this one being a stout. Nose tells me that its a blueberry stout. Initial aromas are full blueberry, almost like a fresh squezed berry, hanging over a malty chocolate base, with a hint of coffee hanging on the end. Its interesting to take a deep inhale and see how it progressed from blueberry to stout over the course of a few seconds. For what it is supposedto be, I have to say the aroma really carries the flag. Flavor definately portrays both characteristics. Taking air over the beer as its in my mouth brings moderate notes of blueberry that hang over a nice base of chocolate, coffee and roast. Swallowing the beer blends the blueberry nicely with the chocolate, and mocha notes. On the finish, the roasted character really comes through, leaving a very mild bitter, but not something I would attribute to hops, but to the blueberry and coffee. I enjoy this one even thought I don't like blueberry all that much. I think it works well in the stout. Feel is nice and thick, with a very light carbonation. I definately have to say, I am surprised by this one. I obtained it because of the novelty of having a blueberry stout, but I am more than pleased with how enjoyable this one has been. Blueberry and stout are a great combination. Who would have thought?"
"Pours pitch black, but when held up to the light the color of blueberries is evident - how cool! Smells like blueberries, coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malt. The blueberry smell is nice, but not overwhelming. Tastes like blueberry coffee with a bit of dark cocoa mixed in - enjoyable, but primarily a dessert or end of the evening beer for me. Little carbonation and slightly creamy mouthfeel - not very pleasant, a light thin for my liking. This is a nice attempt - blueberries and coffee/chocolate come together nicely here."
"Black beer (I couldn't even find real highlights) with a dense, dark brown head. Decent retention and lacing as well. It smelled like a combination of blueberry pancakes and roast/coffee - like breakfast. The blueberries came through in the flavour as well, along with some chocolate character and a bitter roast in the finish. Moderate bitterness overall. The body and carbonation were on the light side of medium and produced a slightly creamy texture. There was a little dryness as well. I was surprised at how well the blueberry flavour came through, particularly with all the dark malts. Different and tasty!"
"drinkability: pretty drinkable"
"Black as night. Moderately aromatic, with notes of blueberry pancakes, coffee, anise and chocolate. Taste is odd, revealing more than twice its potency in flavor. A subtle blueberry flavor is present but it distracts from other flavors more than contributing a flavor. Notes of anise, ginger, strong coffee grounds and a hint of blueberry."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is very creamy. The beer has a medium body. This is just one fantastic gem of a stout. The beer is very well balanced between sweet maltyness and hoppyness."
"Mmmm aroma is a crusty baked blueberry pie served right next to a steaming cup of quality roasted coffee. Deep black color in the body with a very dark brown pinky thin, creamy head. Fore is roasty with chooclate and coffee notes..slightly bitter then the bluberries kick in toward the middle. Lots of bitter dark chocolate, cocoa and coffee flavors collide with the blueberry notes in the finish. This is a damn tasty beer and it is not lost in the blueberry notes...its still very much a stout first."
"Drinkability is good based simply on what this is. A blueberry stout. If this had a profoundly delicious taste, it would be the ultimate in dangerous. The drinkability would be off the hook. This beer made me skeptical from the jump, but as I started to ponder the possibilities it led me to hope. Ultimately this brew was very disappointing. So much potential."
"Dry finish."
"I love stouts and blueberries, so I had to give this one a try. Very dark black in color, with a thin tan colored head that didn't last long. The best part of this brew is the smell. Lots of blueberries with hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste is pretty much the same with the blueberries taking a backseat to the coffee and chocolate flavours. A medium-heavy bodied mouthfeel, not much carbonation. I would recommend this stout to anybody, its worth a try, but not a session brew."
" Orange chocolate flavored stout would tastes like."
"A very well crafted crossover between a stout and a fruit beer. Poured out to an onyx black color with a nice 1 inch brown foamy head. Medium low level of carbonation, and many rings of lace are some of the characteristics that make this brew very stout like. Aroma is sweet and earthy, with a powerful natural blueberry aroma, almost like blueberry pancake syrup. Taste is very very unique; flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt and blueberry are all very present, and seem to work out ok. I give this brew a 4 for taste in the sense that the flavors are there, but they don't mesh all that well. Mouthfeel is again very stout like, heavy and dense. Drinkability is fair; i'd have this every once in awhile, but not all that often. Worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is slightly thin compared to the robust flavor. Drinkability is good for a nice roasty stout."
"I'll take a pass on this one."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, fully bodied, along with the blueberry sweetness lingering."
"Has a full stouty mouthfeel, however, this isn't something I would buy again."
"Nice crisp body cuts through the richness of the malt and keeps the beer on its toes. Very nice bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. The restraint of the fruitiness, and the level of integration make this an easy one to down. Great job!"
"Good for the novelty factor, but probably won't pick this one up again."
"Weird labels, great beer...that's Dark Horse."
"This was an attractively alluring stout to behold, a yummy treat that was the perfect dessert beer for after dinner. Yum! Thanks trbeer!"
"Pretty beer. Pitch black with a dark tan head that doesnt fade immediately, but doesnt last. The bluebeery aroma is nice and is the first thing you notice. Under that is a bit of hop and chocolate. The malts take dominance in the flavor with chocolate laying down the foundation of the flavor with toast and a little char filling in the cracks. The blueberry is there in the flavor, but not so strongly."
"Thanks to trbeer for the bottle. A good beer to have one of, but maybe I'm just not a fan of blueberry and hence don't care for the flavor much. Still, maybe have a single one again in the future."
"It was good. Interesting. I had my little PBR 8-oz or whatever glass of this during a movie, so it had a chance to sit and warm and change a bit. It was a dark stout brown color with a small tan head. It smelled like blueberry muffins and coffee, nice and roasty/toasty. It tasted similar, not too much blueberry though, more of the roasted malt and coffee flavour. I've seen blueberry muffin coffee at 7-eleven but was always afraid to try it. I think it may be similar to this beer. The blueberry taste did shine through a bit more as time went on, but I think I would've liked more berries in there. Mouthfeel was ok, maybe a little watery and thin for a stout, so drinkability suffers a bit. I'd try it again but I'm not upset that i don't have another bottle right here and now. Overall a decent beer with an interesting flavour."
"Opaque black with tan edges. Aromas of blueberry cake, chocolate, and a hint of hoppy caramel. Taste is roasty, toasty, and sweet. The blueberry presence is minimal, but it is noticed more as the brew warms. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery, but the drinkability remains nice."
"Drinkability is decent but one is enough."
"I've never heard of a blueberry stout until I saw this one at my local beer store. It poured very dark, almost pitch black but not quite, with a weak dark head. There were some signs of oxidation which was this beer's main problem. But it was so unique and tasty. I didn't even have to smell the beer, the blueberries came out and smacked my nose with a strong-ass scent. The actual taste had a lot of roastiness. It actually was so roasty that it was smoky. Blueberry was still prevalent. It reminded of toast with blueberry jam on it. Tarty finish. I need more Dark Horse products."
"Quite amazing stuff. It would earn a perfect score if it gained some sort of cohesion or balance. Perhaps a lighter touch with the roasties would help."
"Quite the little beer here from Dark Horse. Neat B&W label. Dark brown/black in color with a deep tan, porter-like head. Definite blueberry aroma but mixed with a deep roasted aroma. Roasted flavor hits the tongue first and mellows to a nice chocolate-blueberry flavor. Pretty easy to drink. I'd certainly have this a few more times. It'd pair nicely with a chocolate cake if you're sick of your standard chocolate cake beer, whatever that might be."
"Much thanks to trbeer for this brew. I have been waiting to try this one for awhile. Pours black with a small tan head that seems to last. Malt, fruit, blueberry and grain are what I smell. The taste is malt, smoke, blueberry and coffee. Very good but not great. The aftertaste is very much coffee and chocolate. I would love to try this on tap some place."
"You'd think that Dark Horse BC pays 4th graders to create their labels in sweat-shops. What appears to be a Mobius strip and either: 1) a rabbit turd, 2) a red blood cell, or 3) a tomato, adorn this label. You'd think they would put a blueberry on the...oh wait. Nevermind. This beer looked a little oily when I was pouring, so I thought I'd try to give it a little head with a vigorous pour and ended up with some of it on my countertop. Oily, absolutely ebony-black with a quickly thinning dark-brown head resembling espresso crema. No lace at all. Nada. The aroma is rich with dark-roasted grains, dark coffee, a sweet little tang of blueberries, subtle hops and a wisp of alcohol. Mouthfeel is moderately smooth, thick and oily, with a medium-strong body. Taste starts with lots of dark-roasted malts, followed by dark coffee and chocolate, a metallic note, a dry whisky character, and then giving way to an unpleasant alcohol bite, which thankfully only last a short instance before the nice finish with a pronounced nutty, coffee-bean character. The blueberries are only evident in aroma and one is never cognizant of their presence otherwise. The alcohol becomes evident as the brew warms, taking on an isopropyl character and giving me an odd sensation. Again, dunno what the ABV is, but it gives me a wierd little buzz. These guys seem to have a way with stouts:) Enjoy."
