Waiting for the head to settle allowed the stout to warm a bit. Do not drink this ice cold; the warmer it gets, the more pronounced the burnt chocolate /espresso becomes, and all all without being to bitter on the way down. A double cream mouthfeel indeed. The easiest drinking stout I can remember, with a tiny bit of bitterness on the finish. Usually I like a stout as a sipper, or something to have with a big, full meal. This one is refreshing, I want more than one, and can see myself going through a couple on a hot summer day. Highly recommended.","Tripel_Threat","Jan 06, 2015"

Created a decent one finger of a khaki colored head. Overall a pretty good looking beer in the glass. Fairly underwhelming nose on this one. Some chocolate, mild coffee, and as the title says, maybe a little bit of cream or maltiness. Taste kind of follows suit here with chocolate and perhaps some very subtle dark fruits coming through. Fairly thin mouth for a stout. Decent overall but nothing I'll be seeking out again.","ryanmextorf","Dec 23, 2014"

For something comparable, I would still choose Left Hand Nitro Milk stout over this, but then this isn't really a milk stout, its a cream stout. I don't believe they use the lactose, which is probably a good thing. Its good, worth seeking out and the price is about where it should be.","humuloner22","Oct 20, 2014"

Tasted malty, a bit sweet (do I detect lactose sugars?), some roasty flavors, altogether rather light. Mouthfeel was a bit light and watery, clean aftertaste. Well-made, but I am a fan of bigger, badder stouts... good for the style.","Mikus","Oct 16, 2014"
3.83,-3.3,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a deep black with a creamy medium tan head. The head burns off in short order leaving some nice small lacing. The aroma is pretty roasty, despite the taste notes, with hints of coffee and cocoa. The taste doesn't have much burnt malt until the finish, with some upfront notes of cocoa. The body is a little thinner and there is a heft bite to it on the finish. Good but not my favorite.","delta490","Oct 16, 2014"

3.69,-6.8,4,3.75,3.75,3,3.75,"Final Word: A solid, drinkable, no frills stout. All of the flavors are very pleasant and balanced, but nothing here really surprises or innovates. This is the kind of stout you can rely on when you need something comfortable and drinkable, but will disappoint if you are looking for something to take you out of the ordinary. This is a double edged sword, as there is definitely something to be said for really nailing a rich stout, but it lacks that special something that could make it a favorite or make it stand out in your memory. Grab it when you want something very drinkable and smooth, or when you want to make a meal pairing, as its straightforward profile makes it perfect for that purpose!","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 21, 2014"

The roasted malt characteristics stand out, with some fleeting hints of smoke and dark fruit. Just enough sweetness to balance out the earthiness and hop bitterness.

Dark roasty malts in the nose, milk chocolate and lightly roasted coffee. Smooth sugary sweetness in the taste, cocoa, light roasty bitterness for balance, and a slight mineral element in there as well. Medium body, slick mouthfeel, but perhaps not quite as luscious as the name would imply. I'd bet this would be great on nitro, but I say that about many stouts.

It is very smooth with a great Burnt coffee Finish. The smell is great, very Malty with vanilla and coffee and hints of chocolate. I like the texture but I love stouts. Stouts are my favorite type of beer and I feel that they should have a creamy texture. This beer could be a bit more creamy. It's a bit watery like Guinness but not too bad. I'm a stout man so I could easily session this beer but for someone who doesn't drink stouts this is not a session beer. I feel that I would drink this after a steak dinner or with a hamburger. Great stout better than the reviews on here had me thinking it would taste.","smptenor","Nov 09, 2013"

4.17,5.3,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, mahogany highlighted, blackish-brown coloring with a creamy, fluffy, smooth, tall, light tan head that slowly settles into a filmy surface coat, leaving an impressive lacing along the glass. Aromas of cream first and foremost, with a subtle bittersweet mocha character in the backbone. Hints of vanilla and smoke, as well. Flavors are cream forward, with a rich and sweet blend, cut through with the bitterness of dark roast coffee, hints of baker's chocolate, and highlights of smoke. Very short lived sweetness, but it flashes back just as strong with every sip, only to be the Trojan horse for the bittersweet and smoky blend on the palate. Solid and balanced. Dry, light bodied, despite the robust flavors, but the beer is able to maintain a smooth feeling throughout. The bitter lingers through to the aftertaste, with a coffee theme, but there are also lingering hints of the creamy sweetness that started it all. Slick transition into a dry finish, with a bittersweet linger. Very easy to drink, both in body and ABV, and very flavorful. Solid beer.","GarthDanielson","Oct 21, 2013"

Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, toffee, light roast, cream, light vanilla, floral, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes with some light hops; and good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, light roast, cream, light vanilla, dark bread, and floral/roasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, cream, dark bread, and light roast on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of dark/roasted malt flavors; with no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Overall this is a very nice sweet stout. All around good balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 18, 2013"

The aroma begins things nicely, giving smoothness, heartiness, and functional sourness, much like an English porter. As we move to the taste, however, we get a beautiful blend of rich and roasty malts, sweetness, evenness, cleanliness, and inclusive darkness. The feel, too, is gloriously soft and smooth, glugging back with ease, and providing the drinker with pleasing closure at the end of each sip. This is an excellent beer, with robust and devilish flavoring, and something we will now look forward to each winter.","TheBrewo","Aug 03, 2013"

Beer came out jet black but ran smooth down the glass, not overly viscous, I was a little surprised at the very little head that emerged. Smell; strong roasted malt and slightly sweet not much else yet. I Let the beer sit for about five minutes and some notes of coffee began to emerge. First sip very smooth roasted malt obviously comes through, the coffee i smelt earlier makes a strong entrance without overpowering. Second sip begins to reveal subtle flavor of burnt sugar and the creaminess of the beer becomes more noticeble. With a name like double cream stout i honestly wasn't sure what to expect of what to compare it to, but great beer overall.","jkeefe1800","May 24, 2013"

When it's all said and done, though, the cream sweetness is just a tad too much for me to call this beer great. I don't think I could drink more than 2 of these before I'd have to throw in the towel. Hard to believe this is dairy free, which amazes me.","TheSixthRing","May 05, 2013"

I found this one to be a bit more burnt and bitter than I would expect from a cream stout. I was truly disappointed in it.

At 6.1% ABV, it would make for a nice after-dinner drink before or with rich vanilla custard or chocolate torte topped with raspberries.

4.11,3.8,5,4,4,4.5,4,"Bell's Double Cream Stout pours jet black, with a voluminous four fingers of caramel colored foam left sitting atop the beer. The head retention is fantastic, and lacing is left behind in a thick, weblike pattern. An absolutely gorgeous beer. The nose is fairly coffee heavy, but rather than the usual heavily roasted, black aroma, this smells like coffee with a bit of milk and sugar added. The flavor brings more of the same, though I'd say it has a little bit more roasty intensity than was found in the nose. The body is wonderfully creamy and smooth for a stout that's not imperialized in any way. It's paired with a nice, subtle carbonation that gives the beer a little life without taking away from the fact that this is a 100% malt driven beer. Bell's Double Cream Stout is one of the best regular stouts I've had, and a beer I'd buy regularly if Bell's was sold in NJ.","axeman9182","Mar 08, 2012"

Pours a light-bodied very dark brown/black. tan head, some lacing, very little head. Smell- raisins, vanilla, bready, brown sugar. Taste- molasses, deep rich caramel, definitely some raisins and vanilla, brown sugar, some mocha chocolate notes on the end with some nice roasty bitterness. This beer is much more complex and enjoyable than I expected. The play between the creamy texture and the borderline quad brown sugar and dark fruit flavors are enjoyable. This is a great beer in my book, that I would try again.","lnashsig","Mar 04, 2012"

Sweetness is understated and mouthfeel is unremarkable, compared to other examples of the style--although it does possess some noted unctuous angles in the smell and flavor. Strained ""milk"" descriptors aside, it is dark and flavorful and does not stray into ""strong"" territory, which makes it balanced and drinkable.","beagle75","Dec 08, 2011"

Mouth-filling flavor has burnt coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and licorice notes with a hint of caramel. Smooth, firm-bodied texture has a fair amount of fizz and leaves a smoky, tingly finish. I had this before on tap, and as good as it is in a bottle, as with most beers it is better from a keg or barrel.","Cyberkedi","Dec 06, 2011"

It smells of creamy chocolates, light roast, light coffee, witha slight bitterness and a slightly sweet and creamy finish. It is very smooth and finishes light. The flavors consist of smooth and creamy milk chocolate with a light and slightly bitter roast. It's excellent. The aftertaste is both light and very appealing. It is exceptionally smooth and drinks perfectly for the style. It's too drinkable and perfect for cold weather. I love this one.","aasher","Oct 25, 2011"

There’s some nice strands of bubbles that sift through the surface of the liquid, but there is little-to-no retention of the head itself. Tiny, scattered patches of bubbles remain as lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee grounds, caramel, and toasted/burned sugar. Some dark fruits come together in the rear. The taste is of dark fruit, molasses, a touch of milk chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and a hoard of cane sugar. The sugar carries over into the mouth, where is leaves a very sticky, resinous finish to the seemingly thinner beer. Overall, a decent stout, but it seems to have an overpowering sugar sensation that is not quite balanced with the rest of the flavors.","eclipse54","Oct 23, 2011"

3.8,-4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Appearance is dark, very dark. Poured from a bottle there's almost no head, and later a thin rapidly sinking lacing. Smells of vanilla, nutmeg, raisin, molasses, fruit, red licorice, black licorice. Taste is bold with spicy raisin and coffee up front. Quickly gives a blast of cocoa and roasted malt. The licorice notes aren't far behind. Extremely creamy mouthfeel, very light prickly carbonation. A bit too syrupy and sugary for me, but I suppose that's the idea of a double cream stout. Still, I wish there was something to counterbalance the sweetness and gummy residue. Taste is complex and very interesting. For fans of the style this is not to be missed.","MNJR","Oct 18, 2011"

4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Another highlight of the 2011 Brass Hat Brewing Brew Fest in Watertown, CT last weekend, this Bell's beauty shows an opaque brown-black with a thin but solid light brown head. Lacing follows suit and coats nicely. The aroma leads heavily with prominent coffee like a classic ""milky"" regular. Undercurrents of light chocolate and sweet seaweed round it out interestingly. The flavor really nails my remembrances of good old fashioned cream soda with plenty of vanilla and light coffee mixed in, along with a sweet dose of chocolate milk. A bit of a treat, perhaps on the dessert side of the beer world but not terribly so. Although it had a somewhat milky feel, I didn't find it perfectly creamy. It was actually a bit aqueous and a little thinner than I anticipated, medium-light bodied to my tastes, especially after a few imperial stouts! It was fairly drinkable for the style, especially if you have a fondness of soda-like brews and sweet treats. I liked it fine though i probably expected a little more guts from a Bell's brew.","Durge","Sep 19, 2011"

It's much more on the astringent side of things, although I've had worse in that regard. Overall, it's a pretty decent stout.

Finish was incredibly silky smooth, very chocolaty, especially on the extreme finish. I have been on a stout kick the last day or so and this struck me as more of a dessert beer/stout, given its lingering sweetness.

The nose makes for no big hoopla, as does the pour; not the best opening, no, but the flavor makes up for lost ground. Full of bitter cocoa and roasted malt, but with a modestly hoppy finish that accentuates the blackened fade.

Very mild bitterness on the palate quickly fades. This beer has a low almost flat level of carbonation making it thick and chewy in the mouth.

Sweet chocolate aroma is dominant with rich roasted malt and light coffee aromas as well. Thick, creamy feel. A bit more carbonation than I expected, but pleasant nonetheless. Nice balance of chocolate and roasted malt flavors in the beginning with coffee flavors rolling through the middle, leading to a prominent hoppy finish. Hop bitterness lingers a bit. Smooth and tasty with a nice variety of aromas and flavors.","IronLover","Apr 06, 2011"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark black with a finger of tan foamy head. Nose is sweet with cocoa, espresso notes, dark and complex malts, a sense of roasted beans. Taste is full; good coffee flavour mixed with roasted malts. Sweet and bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, creamy yet smooth and dry. A decent stout but not mind blowing or Bells best.","heebes","Apr 04, 2011"

This stout has a Dark rich brownish-black with a gorgeous creamy head pour. Complex notes of malts. I like my stouts to be more robust and less chocolaty.

4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel lives up to the beer's name: creamy, smooth, velvety texture is a great match for the milk chocolate flavors. Drinkability is high due to the smoothness of the beer, lower abv for the style, and softer flavors. I really like the balance this beer has and the fact that it isn't going for a world record in some chocolatey or coffee-like category - this is just a well made stout that doesn't do anything extraordinarily, but doesn't do anything really wrong either.","veinless","Mar 28, 2011"

The taste ups the roast ante a bit and adds a touch of coffee, but, beyond that, everything else from the smell remains constant. The body is a slightly hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and a silky feel. Overall, other than a carbonation a smidgen too active for my tastes here, this is a great milk stout.

Taste is dark chocolate, burnt grains, espresso, table cream, spicy and resiny hops, and some cocoa powder on the cough.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, and slight roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, roasted malt, and cream on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall the flavor on this one was kind of watered-down in my opinion. The aroma on this one isn't overly great either, but decent. Just seemed to be lacking in intensity in both aspects. With that said however, it is worth trying at least once. I could imagine this being mixed with Expedition and being QUITE good. Mouthfeel on this one was kind of thin as well for my taste. While this helps the drinkability of the brew, it also hurts it overall.","thagr81us","Dec 28, 2010"

The creaminess here is more in the body and mouthfeel, and only one of many aspects of the taste. There are some low, dark fruit notes in the background of this one, and the dry finish has a grainy, coffee-like feel. I'm not sure all the elements here add up as ideally as desired, for me, though at least it's interesting. The cola-feel contrasts a little strangely with the buttery cream notes, and the fruit notes a little strangely against the coffee finish. It's a decent enough sipper, not one I'd turn away by any means; but it's not an absolute home run either.

The aroma reveals licorice, sweet milk chocolate, creamy coffee, mild buttery biscuit, and a touch of raisin. Roasty. An interesting fruity tasty up front becoming quickly mildly sweet and creamy like a rich sour cream. The bitterness deepens as the beer warms and breathes on the palate. There is a touch of alcohol but it burns off quickly leaving a dry finish that's loaded with lingering bitterness, dry coffee-like roastiness, and a light touch of mildy tart dark fruitiness. The body is medium. The texture is softly fluffy as the beer seems to expand on the palate. Oily on the finish.

Some slight chocolate and vanilla notes are present. There is also a slightly hoppy note at the end of the sip. Mouthfeel is fairly heavy and appropriate for the style.

In fact, I would say that this is the creamiest mouthfeel I have ever had in a beer. It pours very dark brown going in and looks nearly black in the stout glass. It has a complex taste that finishes just a little bit tart with a definite black patent aftertaste. This bottle has the code 9446 on the back.

This may be because the primary flavor component is sticky, cloying sweetness. This excessive sweetness is accompanied by an odd, cola like note of artificial caramel flavoring and some strange sourness. The only thing I can find to like about it is the pleasant, dark roasted coffee note that is always lingering in the background. I really didn't care for this beer, it is strange, one dimensional, and overly sweet and I definitely won't be drinking it again.","nickfl","Mar 16, 2010"

Perhaps more of a compromise for those who don't like super-dry or super-sweet. This one lands squarely in the middle.

A bit of caramel malt sweetness but the cream seems to be lacking. A lot of coffee with warming that i was not expecting. I dont see why they call this a double. The feel is a bumpy ride and a bit rugged. Not as easy going down as other's in the style, perhaps this would be best off a nitro, hopefully one day i'll find it.

Very refreshing smell with some hints of roasted coffee beans. Taste is similar to the nose with some added taste of coffee and the milk/cream really dominate the quaff. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy while refreshing. Very solid milk stout. Alcohol is masked really well by the complexity and sweetness of the taste. Very sessionable in my opinion.","abrand","Jan 11, 2010"

The taste followed the nose, and it was a real pleasure to drink. Chocolate and roasted barley with a hint of mocha and a hops aftertaste that was far from overpowering but balanced the beer just fine. Moderate carbonation. This is about as drinkable of a beer as I've had, I would be more than happy having a few more.","diybrun","Jan 10, 2010"

4.2,6.1,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Big, aggressive head of dark tan, lots of dense foam yet offers a host of large bubbles as well, excellent retention and strong lacing as well. Onyx black in color, actually black is not a color so more or less colorless. The nose has a dryness to it which controls the sweeter qualities of the dark chocolate, cocoa, licorice accents, the cherry, plum scents show good contour, some scone or flaky dough notes, nothing overtly hoppy but one assumes they contribute to the dryness. Full-bodied, the creamy texture relieves much of the weight as well as a good bit of bitterness. Still, the dark chocolate, coffee bean, cocoa powder has some bitterness. Licorice, orange peel, tea leaves, nuts drift in and out. Lower level of cherry, apricot, apple fruit, subtle. The carbonation is itself smooth but has a relentless power to it, adds to a sense of movement. Very consistent, balanced presentation.","farrago","Jan 04, 2010"

OK, so it's not a traditional milk stout due to the roast and lack of super sweet lactose in the flavor, but this is a DAMN good and it's towards the top of the ABV range, so I'm sure the roast is necessary to avoid this tasting too hot.

Mouthfeel is, again, smooth, but lacks the body for me to consider it exactly ""creamy."" Very quaffable, and were it not for the alcohol content would be a great session beer.

Definitely not the whiff of lactose sweetness I expected. Tastes of roasted barley and coffee with a nice accompanying malt sweetness that hits me with coconut and prunes. Finish is roasty to a spicy degree with a rich cookie dough ending with a hint of flora. Great blend of roast and sweet malts with dark fruits and coconuts. Medium to full body with a silky, almost chewy presence. Medium carbonation. Really far above average when it comes to sweet stouts. A treat. Damn you Bell's for making one of the better milk stouts I have had and I can't even think about buying your beers in California.

Opaque black. Smells good but its very subtle. Admittedly the beer is a little cooler than it ought to be so this may be part of the problem. Taste initially suffers for the same reason, but as it warms up the flavor profile expands nicely. Nice roasted flavors that meld with a slight sweetness reminds me of burnt marshmallow. The mouthfeel is velvety and thick. Overall this is a really nice ""sweet"" stout. I put the sweet in quotations because it definitely does not play this side up as much as some of its peers. Its a stout first with just enough sweetness to balance out the bitterness nicely, leaving a very full character taste. I would definitely buy this beer again.","Godot","Nov 14, 2009"

4.07,2.8,5,3,4.5,4.5,4,"When the server brought this to me there was easily two fingers worth of head on this beer. The head was a dark caramel color that stayed around for two minutes or so before subsiding. Then after the head subsided it left a prolific amount of lacing on the glass. For the pure aesthetics of appearance, this easily earned a five, just wow. It looks just like a stout should and the head was prevalent and pleasing to look at. The smell was faint, it was there but subtle. I was able to make out hints of vanilla and coffee notes. The taste was really something else. My first impression was that it was a bit watery, but as I continued to drink and as it continued to warm, Bell's Special Double Cream Stout became something truly wonderful. The cream was definitely present, but not overpowering, there was some roasted malts and I think I picked up hazelnut, not sure if that's in there but it had that impression on my tongue. The coffee notes and vanilla balanced so well together that it created a truly unique taste and mouthfeel, that I've at least never had before - it was like drinking a licorice yogurt. For real. The mouthfeel was thick enough and the balance of the ingredients created a yogurt like texture. This became more prevalent as it continued to warm, but I was enamored. I ordered another beer before I finished this one and I didn't want to stop drinking the Special Double Cream Stout! Pick this up, buy it on tap, whatever, just try this beer.","FernMaster","Oct 31, 2009"

3.79,-4.3,4.5,3,4,4,4,"The taste starts out with a nice chewy blend of coffeee and sweetish malts. It stays subdued & true through the middle until the finish, where enough malty complexity opens up to resemble a breaded, smoked, candied culinary treat. Sweet tobacco and cocoa show up as well at the top of my mouth. Only a hint of lactic sweetness towards the very end, which turns quickly (I love when a beer changes direction on a dime) into a surprisingly bold, bitter hop finish. The medium body finds its way into all crevices and deposits the leaf-like bitterness of the hops. Did I say unexpected? I thought sweet stouts favor round malted milkiness instead of sharp flavors, and at first I am ready to deduct points... But then again...the chewy and well-carbonated mouthfeel helps keep extremely tight reigns on the beer, and combined with the smoky dryness, this is a restrained affair. The first several sips, I was not a big fan. Now the glass is empty and I wish I had another to give this a fresh look... That is a compliment. Again I am allured.","Philabeerphia","Oct 21, 2009"

Initial flavor is very much cream, almost like chocolate milk. As the beer warms a little, the 10 malts advertised begin to give a more complex flavor profile in addition to the traditional cream stout flavor. Low hop flavor doesn't get in the way of all the malts. Very drinkable beer. While the complex malt profile teases the tongue, it still in some ways is just another cream stout, just a more expensive cream stout.

There are several key aromas that I detect. Chocolate, coffee, burnt plums, molasses, brown sugar, and roasted malt. An excellent combination. Nice creamy lactic texture and low carbonation. Not too heavy, either. But not too easy to drink. Sweet coffee and roasted malt is the most prodominant flavor feature in my opinion. A small bit of chocolate as well. But the taste seems weaker than the smell, if that makes sense. After sniffing the beer I expected a stronger flavor with more bite. It's pretty mild, but good. I feel some alcohol warmth also. Good beer.","berserker256","May 21, 2009"

Thanks to the fam for briniging this beer back from Pennsylvania for me. Pour is a cool black, with about half a finger of tanned heading. Sweet lactose comes through in the aroma (as expected), along with some cream, chocolate and coffee. More of the same comes through in the smell. A roasty edge balances out the sweetness as well. Despite the ABV, body doesn't feel too big, more medium if you ask me. A few of these in a night would be no problem with some dessert. Overall a fine beer from the Bells line. Not their best stout, but definitely one of them. It reminds me of Left Hand's version a bit. Pair this with some tuffles and see how they work together. Cheers","jamie2dope","May 14, 2009"

Lots going on and it's all working. Big roasty notes, molasses, aforementioned coffee and a nice milk-chocolateyness. Almost like a cup of coco, but with out being too sweet.

A fair amount of carbonization, as well. The creamy, sweet smell is strong, and quite delicious. That cream comes through hard in the flavor as well, it tastes like part beer, and part cream soda.

Some pretty good chocolate come out, and very slight dark fruit hints, mainly rasphberry. As noticeable in the smell, tons of bourbon. Not too much, but slightly overpowering to the other flavors. There's a slight roughness to the flavor, which I'm assuming is coming from the caramel malts. This is a good beer, I'm interested to see if it will smooth out with time.","CoolJosh","Jan 08, 2009"

Mouthfeel is pretty good, about what it should be for an amped up milk stout. Drinkability is very good here, as there is little heat, and it goes down quite smooth. Overall a solid brew, a good stout, as most are from Bell's. This isnt one im going to write home about or put up some annoying ""OMG blah blah blah beer is soo goood!!!!""

There is a very nice ring left around the edges, still having that mocha color. I'm surprised by the lack of malt smell. Instead I'm greeted with a recognizable lactose smell, probably common in milk stouts! Go figure! There are plenty of chocolate and coffee notes as well. The taste to this is actually just the reverse of the smell. Immediately I am punched in the face by a barrage of coffee, dark chocolate, and burnt malt flavors. It tastes pretty similar to what I drank for breakfast, only much much colder. I've had a few milk stouts before and I'm expecting a lactose taste, but it never seems to shine through as prominently as I expect. Once I let it warm up I can pick up on more of a milky taste, but it's very subtle. With each sip this beer gets silkier and silkier. This is absolutely delicious! I've drank about half of the bottle and I can start to fell some of the effects of the 7.5%. I'm definitely picking this up as soon as I can!","DontCallMeSurly","May 14, 2008"

The aroma is smooth compared to their regular stout. There is a spiciness that I can't place that comes through in the nose. The taste is smooth! There is an oatmeal stout feel, but the body is a great blend of malts, roasted toffee, and roasted malts. I would say that this resembles an oatmeal stout, but that is probably what they were intending. The body is decent, but there is a slight heaviness. I would drink this all night if it were cheaper or I was making more money.","phishgator","May 13, 2008"

This is perhaps my favorite beer from Bell's. Coffee, Chocolate and molasses are all over this one. This beer makes the mouth salivate. Great sweetness with matching bitters.

I didn't get any coffee flavor on tongue, but a bit of vanilla did come to life as the beer warmed more. The mouthfeel on this is smooth and creamy and coats nicely with the alcohol very well hidden. Drinkability is also high due to the low carbination and silky smooth mouthfeel and not overly high alcohol ABV. I could easily make this a session stout.","TheodorHerzl","Dec 10, 2007"

Taste is basically the same, but the sweet cream comes out in the finish of the beer to leave a sweet tang in the back of your throat.

For that matter, I may not know of any other breweries doing this many different stouts period. If the label is right, and this is really 6.1%, then this becomes a quality session stout, perfect for the fall and winter months.

3.95,-0.3,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"12 oz. bottle, brewed with 10 different malts; batch 7733 - packaged on 11/21/07. It pours with a black body, light carbonation, and a finger of lightly-yellowed, tan head that retains a 3/4"" collar and a thin blanket of foam throughout, depositing bits of lace here and there. The bouquet is quite aromatic, yet subtle, revealing notes of chocolate, espresso, dark fruits, and hints of green hops. At times it gives the impression of Chambord-flavored milk chocolate and blackberry coffee - gotta love the smell of Bell's stouts. On the palate, there's espresso, dark chocolate, roasted/burnt malts, black/blueberries, and a latent creaminess. The body starts light, but quickly becomes heavier, with medium carbonation and a lactic smoothness that evens things out. Overall, another quality stout from Bell's, but I have a sneaking suspicion that if they made a straight-up cream stout, the result would be even better than this brew.","mmmbeer","Aug 03, 2007"

Sweet caramel taste up front, smooth creamy chocolate milk taste to follow, then some roasted nut flavoring finishes it up, very complex.

There are hints of chocolate in the nose, but that doesn't come through in the taste. This feels thick/creamy on the tongue, I am surprised there is not more of a head given the mouthfeel. There is no hint of the actual alcohol level, this could be a 4% beer. I could drink this by the barrel, but I think the alcohol would catch up pretty quick.

Upon tasting, you can tell that it's a double cream stout - with all the bitter chocolate/coffee flavors comes a milky, sugary aspect, so it tastes a bit like coffee loaded up with cream.

Taste is also very enjoyable with nice chocolate and coffee flavors, combined with more dark fruitiness, and ending with a mild bitterness that beckons for another taste.

4.3,8.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A good stout slows down time. A great stout slows down time immeasurably so that you sit and stare mindfully off into the void for a long minute after the first gulp and take in what it has to offer. Kinda like watching a Regina Spektor video through your taste buds. After that it's sipping time and for me eating time so that I don't become tipsy or nod off for ten minutes and drown in the tub. Yeah, so there is lots of toastiness in this one along with the other general stout traits but for a citrusy bite in the dregs.

The aroma is a bit underwhelming -- some roasted malts poke their way through the sweet/sour malts, but it doesn't add up to terribly much. I will say that it smells inviting, though, just the way a sweet stout should. The taste is considerably more complex. A sweet caramel flavor starts things off, followed by a slightly sour taste common in stouts with lactose added. The finish is sweet and sticky. Throughout, this stout glides over the tongue with grace in spite of its only-medium body. This beer is finely tuned and tasty -- an excellent version of a milk stout.","geexploitation","May 07, 2006"

A lot of different sweet flavors, coffee, carmel, chocolate, etc., but not really any roasted flavor, all in all a very sweet stout. I also really liked the floral hop flavor in the after taste as well. This is a quite heavy beer though which definitly affects the drinkability.

Lactose sweetness in the aroma, chocolatey and malty, light alcohol and moderate roasted character. Full body with low carbonation. Silky smooth texture, a bit milky. Balance is on the malty side, lactose, low roasted flavour but the roast barley contributes to dryness at the finish. Low bitterness and just a bit of milk chocolate. Very light alcohol warmth. Pretty good stout overall, quite enjoyable.","DrJay","Jul 21, 2005"

3.65,-7.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Jet black in colour with a small off white head. The aroma is dominated by sweet chocolate (think chocolate chips), with more subtle notes of espresso, roasted malt, and a fruit element that I cant quite identify (perhaps plum?). Upon drinking, the chocolate becomes a little less sweet, and takes on more of a powedered cocoa flavor. Theres also a bit of a yeasty note with a bit of leafy hop bitterness at the end. The sweetness is a little less than I expected, but well within stylistic guidelines. I had hoped for a bit more body too, but again, its not as if its thin. I tend to want sweet stouts to completely bowl me over with sweetness and thick mouthfeel. I found this one to be a bit on the tame side, but still a quality beer.","fisherman34","Jun 30, 2005"

Alcohol is there behind everything if you look. Roastiness is very subdued. The taste is very similar. Creamy (per the name) slickness dominates in the mouthfeel. Could use a tiny bit more carbonation in my opinion. Taste is extremely milky and chocolaty all the way until you swallow, then the roastiness comes through in the finish. It is accompanied by a very lactic character as well, which eventually wins over the roasted malt with its sourness. This is a little unpleasant. With a little more roasted character, this could have been a real winner. It's no Kalamazoo Stout though.","PatYoda","Jun 17, 2005"

The aroma is very creamy, like whole milk and sugar, with chocolate and coffee undertones and a cloying sweetness. The taste is very interesting and sort of goes all over the place. You get hints of cocoa, coffee, whole milk, molasses and a mild roasted bitterness. Probably one of the best milk stout's i've had, the alcohol is hidden well and the mouthfeel is extremely creamy and incredibly smooth. This isnt really a beer you could call a session beer, but it's not hard to drink by any means.

Better score for appearance this time around, as the head revealed some some rusty orange hues in addition to the garnet tints noted in my earlier experience. Aroma score gets bumped up a notch for complexities I missed in my first review. Some smokiness and vanilla notes add to the multiple malt notes to be found in this interesting stout. Mouthfeel, as well, is worthy of an update. Velvety smooth on the palate, and quite exquisite. Ten different malts are used in this one, according to the label, and the adventurous complexity is well worth revisiting. Very tasty, and a very nice stout to sip and savor. One of Bell's better offerings, for sure, and that's quite a compliment.","merlin48","Apr 28, 2005"

Smells quite sweet, like coffee with lots of creamer. Chocolate malts make their presence known on the second whiff. Tastes very sweet, roasty, but not too sweet; as I've disliked this with the other milk stouts. It could be all the roasted malts, or even a background hoppiness that helps keep the sweetness under control. Mouthfeel is my only gripe; it's a little thinner than I want for a beer of this stature. However, since the beer isn't cloyingly sweet and I find I enjoy its balance of bittersweetness, it regains in this area.","Star80","Apr 24, 2005"

Just the slightest red tint near the bottom of the glass, although light does not pass through the main body of the beer. Sticky lacing and good head retention. Aroma of chocolate and coffee with cream in it, a malty mix with some good roastiness. Very full and well rounded taste. Bell's claims to use 10 different malts, and although I can't pick them all out, the blending is apparent. Sweet chocolate mixed with slightly bitter coffee blends well with a slight cream taste, with a roasted flavor throughout. A little sweet fruit is apparent near the beginning, and the faintest of citrous hops makes a showing near the finish. Finish is sweet and creamy with a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is big and smooth. Bell's is very good at stouts, and this is no exception. This was the beer that got me into craft beer, and its a pleasure to have it again after quite awhile.","BeerFink","Apr 19, 2005"

The body is somewhat thick but in more of a dairy sense than an oily sense. Quite sweet and dairy like. I can't really perceive any carbonation on my tongue. This is not a repulsive brew by any stretch of the imagination, but I would most likely not try this again. This style seems to lack the things I love about stouts. The milk factor seems to really dull things out. Namely the bitterness and roasted feeling of stout brews. Bell's has much finer drinks available in my opinion.","SupaCelt","Feb 23, 2005"

Not much of a scent to note, but odors of coffee and dark chocolate were present. Label states that smoothness is from the 10 different malts used in the brewing process, and I will give them that, this brew is smooth. Overtones of chocolate, malt, sweetness are prevailant, with a touch of a mellow bitterness aftertaste. Very creamy mouthfeel, but I must admit that this brew was far too heavy for my taste. It made me feel like I had a friggin' brick in my stomach. Maybe good with a steak or burger, but overall, was too rich for me.

Roasted notes swell along with oak, and a creamy, lacto sweetness. Finish is dry, acidic, coffee and bitter, with smoky, roasted sweetness hanging around. Very nice. Full-bodied, creamy feel.

The taste is deep roasted, chocolaty malt. A little bit of figs and perhaps ribbon candy shows on the finish. This has a little more alcohol in the flavor profile than I expected. It doesnt hurt the beer, just cuts through some of the malt. The hops dont really show (thats not a complaint. It works in this beer). The velvety mouth feel I expected after having a few of the other Bell beers. I often cant drink many stouts, but this is a very drinkable beer. Great beer.

No bitterness detected and the alcohol just manages to show itself towards the end of the glass, when the beer finally warms up a bit. Its well hidden otherwise. A beautifully rich and potent beer.","pezoids","Feb 14, 2004"
4.18,5.6,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a dark, nearly black liquid, with a wonderful dark tan creamy frothy head. The head on this beer alone was one of the most appealing I have ever seen. This beer smells of dark roasted coffee beans, nearly burnt. The taste is somewhat sweet with a hint of almost burnt coffee. This is very smooth and creamy. This is a pretty drinkable beer. I feel fortunate to have been able to have this on draft, as I know the bottles can be somewhat expensive, and well, we know the track record for Bell's bottles. If you are a stout lover, this is certainly worth a try.","Bierguy5","Feb 08, 2004"
4.08,3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall, this is an interesting second take on Kazoo Stout. It basically takes a very solid year around, and then polishes it up a little, trading the heavier roasted edge of the standard for a creamier, smoother flavour. I like them both.","CortexBomb","Feb 06, 2004"

3.73,-5.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"As I opened this beer, my wife said, ""Oooohh! Pretty label!"" Even with a rather agressive pour, this beer poured very flat but did manage to build about a half inch of frothy head. This has been pretty typical of the beer I've tried from Bell. This beer is dark, no light was getting through. The head was tan and faded fast but hung around the edge like wall flowers. The nose was very subtle with chocolate malt tones. The taste was a little thin, not what I was expecting. The flavor was mild as well but then again, a lot of stouts don't really explode with flavor. This beer is very mellow and demands that you take your time with it. It finishes nice with a bit of a mocha flavor and more chocolate. I probably would've rated this beer a bit higher if it were a bit more active from the pour and I'd like to taste it a little more chewy.","BCMan","Feb 03, 2004"
3.85,-2.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Light, flash-in-the-pan phead the fades to a ring of foam around the edges but stirs up easily with a small swirl. Chocolate and char on the nose. The flavor has an odd dry powdery flavor (can't quite describe it actually), that seems to intertwine itself with the chocolate malt flavors to give the impression of a mouthfull of cocoa powder. A bit milky in the flavor. I really imagined a stout called Double Cream to be a bit thicker, but it's not exactly thin. Definitely improves as it warms.","aracauna","Jan 31, 2004"

An inch high head slowly recedes, but leaves darker brown caps of foam rising out of a few spots. When held to the light, reddish-brown particles are seen suspended. Aroma of cocoa and faint hops, perhaps a hint of raisin. Rich flavor of sweet cocoa, bitter chocolate, tart cherry, piney hops, raisin and espresso. Some molasses, but not an overly roasted malt character. Chalky residual feel around the mouth, with some definite tingling from the combination of hops and bitter chocolate and coffee. Has almost an imperial feel to it.","far333","Jan 27, 2004"

The flavor is not as intense as I thought it would be. It is sweet at the start with some chocolate and caramel flavors leading the way. Roasty notes come in a bit later to finish you off before a nice dry aftertaste filled with toasty flavor. The mouthfeel is pretty good, creamy, but I am not sure if this one is supposed to have more carbonation. It is pretty good, but this one will be edited if I have a better sample.","ElGuapo","Jan 20, 2004"

The flavors here run the gamut of malts: chocolate, espresso, rye bread, and a bit of toast, with a pleasant taste of buttered rum.

The butter seems to dominate the aroma. The butter component is in the taste as well. This beer is creamy in consistency. It has definite roast character as well, though befitting a cream stout, it is a soft roast flavor. The stout is fairly thick bodied, with notes of coffee and chocolate. The butter flavor seems to dissipate with time, though I could just be getting used to it. I am not sure if the butter character is supposed to be here (my guess is that it is not), but it is no so strong that it horribly detracts from this beer. It even helps to boost the perceived fullness of this beer. Though in the end this beer would be much better without the butter component.","Gueuzedude","Dec 16, 2003"

Lots of malt in the smell, mainly chocolate/coffee mix and some vanilla. The taste was not what I expected but it was still good. Not really sweet at all. Bittersweet chocolate was there. The main flavor seemed to be coffee. Tart fruit was also apparent. It seemed like there was a solid hop presence also. The body was a little on the thin side, but all in all a good beer.","granger10","Oct 31, 2003"

There seems to be a good deal of Crystal (caramel) malt in this brew and yet it doesn't go the way of brown ales (raisiny and, in my opinion, quite poor). It even picks up a good amount of esters either from the yeast or the hops.

It has a very strong toasty, chocolate-laced coffee flavor to it. I find it to be sweeter than Kalamazoo Stout and it has a lingering mouthfeel. I suspect Bell's sells more Kzoo Stout, but this one is far more enjoyable due to the rich flavor and the molasses-like mounthfeel.","Sudmissle","Sep 11, 2003"

4.5,13.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Virtually black beer pours with a perfect 2-finger dark tan head that fills my pint glass. After 5 minutes, the head has actually crowned above the top of the glass and begins to take on a rocky appearance. A small amount of sediment can be seen floating in the beer. Dark particles can be seen in the foam at this point. The aroma of sweet roasted malt is noticeable from two feet away. Up close, the sweetness is much stronger, with nice raisin and chocolate notes. With a small amount of trepidation, I contemplate taking a sip. This beer has been so wonderful to experience thus far that I'm afraid to tarnish the experience (considering K'zoo's recent quality issues). The taste is much more mellow than I expected! Sweet fruity notes up front are accented by a light cherry flavor, but quickly lead to a stronger chocolate and roasted malt taste. There is ample bitterness in the finish to offset the sweetness, and then coffee and dark, bitter chocolate sweep in for the lingering aftertaste. No graininess, no earthy overtones, no tartness (all the things I've come to fear in a Bell's beer). The mouthfeel is creamy, but not overly thick. The active carbonation maintains a thick head for the entire glass, but it doesn't force itself upon the tongue. The drinkability is phenomenal, as this goes down almost as easily as a Guinness draught with about twice the alcohol and a very enjoyable sensory experience. Looks good, smells good, tastes good, feels good, drinks good. This is one of the better beers from K'zoo.","aaronh","Jul 29, 2003"

The taste hits hard with roasted coffee and caramel, then the sweeter malts come out toward the finish. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, almost chewy in the mouth.

Creamy, sweet, malt flavor and a nutty flavor builds at the back of the mouth. Coffee flavors intensify with each sip as well. It feels a little syrupy at the end, which would not make this a beer you could drink a lot of. It's a dark black beer with a tan head, the thick head lasts throughout.

The aroma is surprisingly complex with notes of sweet milk chocolate, creamy coffee, light cocoa, mild buttery biscuits, dark baker's chocolate and the very ""burnt"" roastiness of rich and oily coffee beans. Quite inviting, and engaging as well! The body is medium/full with a fine carbonation that foams up in the mouth giving it an even fuller mouthfeel. The flavor is equally impressive and just as complex as the aroma with notes of dark fruit (and apples) and sweet chocolate up-front, even sweeter creamy cocoa and caramel as it warms, a rising solid bitterness and deep roastiness as it enters the swallow with a touch of alcohol, followed by a dry finish that's loaded with lingering bitterness, dry coffee-like roastiness, and a light touch of mildy tart dark fruitiness.

4.18,5.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. This is an excellent Stout, which I understand is par for the course with Bell's. I can't wait to try the entire line! Pours black as night with a thin bone-white head and good lacing. Great smooth creamy flavor that I could enjoy all night.","Dogbrick","Dec 02, 2002"
3.97,0.3,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Black and opaque... with a decent tan head. Aroma of roasted barley, coffee, chocolate, and some dried fruit. Flavor is somewhat astringent, with coffee and chocolate flavors... some sweetness, and dried fruit flavors. Medium to full body, with low to medium carbonation. Very smooth as it warms. Another well done stout from Kalamazoo.","zerk","Nov 28, 2002"
4.42,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Uniform, one fingered persistent dark tan head covers a virtually black brew. Trace hazy deep ruby when held to light. Sweet milk chocolate hits the nose at first, then is ensued by notes of buttery malt and deep caramel. Understated roasted barley adds a hint of coffee sharpness, but the aroma is sweet, mellow and inviting all around. A combination of roasted grain and hop bitterness in flavor immediately yields to a rounded, mild lactose sweetness and chocolate malt, which in turn is ceded by dark caramelized malt sweetness. Hints of tart fruity esters from Bell's yeast strain are subdued by the rich overall malt profile, but emerge as a pleasant mid palate undertone. Moderately bodied, w/ a firm, dextrinous mouthfeel conducive for excellent drinkability. Finishes w/ fading sweetness which allows the dark fruity tartness to linger pleasantly on the palate. Double Cream Stout is a delicious, unique and deceivingly smooth stout. Subtle, yet rich.","marc77","Nov 20, 2002"

4.32,9.1,4.5,5,4,4.5,4,"This beer is ink black.  A thin brown head recedes to an edging rather quickly.  Nice belgian lacing.  Huge mix of toffee, vanilla bean, coffee, mocha and dark fruits on the nose.  The taste is a combination of bittersweet chocolate (slight), lactic sourness, alcohol and dark plum and cherry like fruits.  Nice combination.  Body is about medium-full.  Just another in the long line of outstanding stouts from K-zoo.  I can't believe I didn't review this one already.","Bighuge","Oct 16, 2002"
3.88,-2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Thick pour but a good head for a Kalamazoo Stout. One quarter inch of compact suds.  Completely black with zero light transmission.  Deep vinagery and cherry-like aromas.  Powerful flavor for a Milk Stout, coffee, slight chocolate, and slighty fruity one/two punch that brightens to the aftertaste.  Bitterness is slighly mellowed by some vanilla.  A little astringency keeps things interesting.  We have a pretty big beer here for style.  Was looking for a little more delicacy, but then, Kalamazoo is not known for that.  ""Chocolate milk"" yeasties on the bottom of the glass.  Nice, but pretty similar to other Bell's Stouts.","ADR","Oct 15, 2002"
4.35,9.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Normally, I am not a sweet beer person.  This however, is very good.  It combines the roasted malt/coffee taste with a sweetness that seems to blend in so well.  If there is a brewery that makes a better lineup of stouts than Bell's, I've yet to see it.  Some may have better individual stouts, but the whole line they offer (11 stouts) are very, very good.","proc","Jul 02, 2002"
