3.95,5.6,4.75,4,3.75,4,4,"Poured a rich, deep dark black body with brown highlights when held to light and one finger of thick, fluffy tan head. Overall impression of appearance is of a fantastic stout. Very nice. Scents of dark chocolate, smokey strong roasted malt upfront, medium-light black coffee up front and a light sweetness and a light fruity aroma. Overall impression of aroma is of a fantastic dry stout, very roast malt-forward and quite nice. Flavor begins lightly dry with strong notes of smokey roast malt, lighter amounts of fruity flavors reminiscent of raspberries, flavors of rich dark chocolate and strong black coffee also apparent, there is a light sweetness present as well. Middle opens up further dry roasted malt and smokey flavors along with bittersweet chocolate and black coffee. Finish is dry with notes of smokey malt, black coffee and bitter cocoa, with a smokey, ashy note. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of roasted malt, smoke, and dark chocolate, with a hint of coffee, the way I make it. Overall impression of flavor is of a very nice dry stout. Deep, dark, roasty and bitter, well worth trying. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with medium carbonation and a drying, roasty feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice stout, true to form, light yet full enough, very nice. Overall this is a fantastic dry stout. If you like a good stout, that is true to style, dry and full try this one, it's a good one.","Auraan","Mar 21, 2015"

This was a very tasty well balanced stout - not overly chocolately or a coffee overload, just a well carbonated malty stout.  I liked this a lot.

3.98,6.4,4.25,3.75,4,4.25,4,"On tap. Pours black, especially to my eyes in a dark setting. Creamy, tight, lasting head. Random lacing. Smell is pretty potent. The good old blend of roast and chocolate. Smell is dry and I don't think it will be too sweet. Flavor is a good ol' American Stout. Some black coffee and baker's chocolate. Dry as I expected it to be. I really enjoyed the simplicity. Boom! Stout to the face. A good non-imperial Stout to boot. Creamy feel. Fuller than the ABV would suggest. A good pint. I like being able to slurp a Stout that isn't 15% nowadays.","VelvetExtract","Feb 21, 2015"

3.9,4.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Got in a trade with swingracex. 22 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, oats, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, oats, and light earthy hops; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, oats, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, oats, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, oats, and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oatmeal stout. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, oats, and light earthy hop flovors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 16, 2014"

The liquid is fully black, skips brown and goes straight to orange for a thin stripe at the glass bottom. The nose is noticeably dry and somewhat sour as well, oats, grains, breads, sour milk mixed in with dark chocolate, cocoa and coffee grinds, more herbaceous than nutty, the fruit is muted but what’s there is sweeter than the rest of the scents, nectarine, peach, melon, the roast outlasts all else. Medium-bodied, if flatfooted, picks a spot and just sits there. The carbonation is too weak to add liveliness. Same emphasis on coffee, cocoa, mocha with heavy roast leading to dry mouth feel. Here orange citrus sweetens the pot some, even as the apple, peach, white grape fruit struggles to find a place, not the usual darker fruit profile. The nuttiness comes through more, the bready, yeasty notes less so. Keeps its weight throughout and never gets undesirably bitter. Leaves you wishing there was more breadth of flavor as well as sweetness, drinkable but not remarkable.","farrago","0"

I don't toss that term around, but this was pretty awful in that cherry, beginning vinegar way that suggests such. Alpine makes some amazing beer and this, in the state it reached me in the bottle, is not in that stratosphere. Major let down. Mouthfeel was thin, starting to get a bit watery.

Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a definite roasty/charcoal flavor on the tongue. Color was a deep, dark brown with ruby highlights. Going back to the taste, I was reminded of a Hershey's Milk Chocolate bar that I purchased in c. 1970 for .10, my first allowance. My mother was with me and it remains one of my earliest memories. Seldom does a beer evoke such vivid reminiscences, but this one certainly did.

4.16,11.2,4.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Overall, a really good stout that for me falls a mostly into American stout but with strong hints of milk stout and a little bit of oatmeal stout. Had this at the brewery during my trip and it was just a little better on-tap. I still prefer the Pure Hoppiness and Duet from them but this is great change of pace and a quality stout. Rotation: not avail in TX - shipped to myself. Worth getting a couple shipped per year. On-tap when out West.","TexIndy","Jul 27, 2009"
4.24,13.4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Beer poured dark brown with a decent tan head. Nose is quite nice, heavy on coffee and roasted malts. Taste is a nice blend of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and smooth from the oatmeal. Overall drinkability is good. This is a wonderful stout, full of character that I could enjoy all day.","arizcards","May 29, 2009"
4.08,9.1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"I found the flavors in this one to be very subtle and mild. Not really in a bad way, just a more toned down stout than I'm used to. A slight chocolaty, roasted quality. Didn't get much coffee taste. Light bitterness at the beginning that quickly mellows out into chocolate malts. Has a nice clean finish. I'm not a huge fan of stouts, but I'd probably get this one again.","Trappissed","May 19, 2009"

3.31,-11.5,5,4,3,2.5,3,"Pours beautiful as a stout should with a fuzzy active milk chocolate colored three finger head. It quickly settles to just a half inch. Body sets in the glass like a big black opal. Nose is zesty and sweet with malty spice smoke. An initial sweet and sour battle dances on the tongue. Noticeable bitter sweet feel reminds me of bakers chocolate. This tart bitter feel bounces off each other and completely dominates the palate. As for as an American stout goes this one lacks the soft rich balance I expect from this style. Mouthfeel stays with that same sour bitter with a bit of thickness. As I do some research I relize that I may have gotten a bad bottle based on other reviews I have looked at. As far as this one goes its drinkability is just OK.","SPLITGRIN","Mar 15, 2008"

3.04,-18.7,4,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours black with a light tan head. Smell is milky, roasted malt and metal at first. Body is a bit too thin, but not too bad. Decent roasty flavor with a hint of chocolate.

This from a few inches away this beer smells of high roastiness. But when you get your nose into it a ton of caramel and a little chocolate come out. The taste is like a sweet caramel liquid.

4.39,17.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a complete black with not a single bit of light coming through with a dark tan one finger head with large bubbles that quickly dies down to just about nothing. Stickiness is hardly there, disappointing in a sense...but looks can be deceiving! Smell is a great combination of roasted barley, dark chocolate malt, and french roast coffee. Sweet caramel malt is definitely there too, love this one on the nose. Tatste starts off with a fresh roasted coffee flavor soon followed by a quick hop bite. Midway through is a perfect caramel sweetness. This one ends with a big roasted barley flavor that lasts and lasts on the tongue. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light bodied with some graininess and a fair amount of carbonation. Great drinkability for this one due to the light body and complete absence of alcohol in the nose and on the tongue. Great brew overall, definitely get a hold of this one if you have the chance. Alpine continues to produce great brews.","BeerTruth","Aug 15, 2007"

Head showed amazing staying power, and the aroma was strongly of coffee and chocolate grains. Following along those lines, the taste was as well of the roasted malts.

4.38,17.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Nearly black yet deceivingly dark as dark brown can get. Medium loosely frothy broken chocolate brown colored crown that remains constant for a good measure; lace in minimal spots. Aroma is packed with solid roasted malt with some nice espresso and dark chocolate notes creeping through. Not fully potent or strong really but very nice to let simmer and wiff. Taste is well rounded with a smooth chocolate front thats favorably dark and lush with a creamy lingering into the middle where espresso flavors really meld in incredibly nicely. Oh, so close to burnt roasted espresso-like flavors and the bittering is subdued enough for full enjoyment. Quite nice to behold. Hence the finish, where it gets a bit of everything mixing and changing with a sweetened roast filled espresso dryness that has a chocolate twinge of bitterness to top it off. Feel is smooth and close to full with a good amount of give in each sip and is a bit sweet in areas with an espresso and chocolatey drying coming through from midway all the way to its remarkable little finish. Nice lingering capabilities with the bittering and espresso. This reminds me alot of the Bell's Java Stout, just not as over the top as the Bell's but right up there just the same. Big thanks to the Big Dog for sending me a refilled and capped bottle (from a growler I'm assuming).","tavernjef","Beers"
