3.9,2.1,4,4,3.75,4,4,"a great stout, one of those enormous dark beers that just satisfies like no other on an unseasonably cold monday afternoon. dark in color, almost black in fact, but showing some dark chocolate tones around the edges under a rather lazy inch of tan foam. the nose is coffee first, mixed in with some chocolate malt, dark chocolate cake or fudge brownie, and a bold ale yeast. love the combination here. the taste is similar, with plenty of robust coffee flavor but very little acidity or mouthfeel weirdness from it. belgian dark chocolate flavor in the finish, some mild birch or maple syrups sweetness, and a dark roasted barley that is large without being especially bitter. i think the mix of flavors and textures is wonderful, velvety smooth but shockingly full flavored, full bodied yet real easy drinking. a nice mix. i think oakshire has impressed during its brief stead in colorado, and i hope they continue to show up periodically with new stuff, as i think everything they do has been excellent. great use of coffee in a drinkable stout. perfect cold weather brew.","StonedTrippin","May 12, 2014"

It's good, don't get me wrong, but I was hoping this would be bolder and not quite as balanced as it turns out to be. Roasted espresso, dark chocolate, and some sweetness from the sugars that come from the oats. A touch more of that espresso shows itself in the flavor, roasted barley, chocolate, and some sugars from the oats. A touch of some char flirts with things throughout, providing a kiss of some bitterness. A creamy, kinda thinner medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice beer. At $5.49 a bomber well worth my money. Something I would definitely buy again.","denver10","Oct 26, 2013"

3.83,0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I have tried this in the past and I hate coffee but my palette has changed. It pours our black and thin but very dark. The foam was a dark brown color and it disappeared almost instantly. Held up to light nothing gets through. The smell, perhaps this is too cold, is coffee. That is it. Not much else going on here. Not that strong. I wonder how old this bottle is. The flavor is delicious. The coffee is more subtle. This has to have aged for just a bit but long enough for some of the flavors to taper down. Basically you get the coffee, burnt ashy malts, smokiness and a hint of chocolate. For the mouthfeel I was a bit let down. This is thin for an oatmeal stout. It is a low alcoholic stout so I would imagine it to be a bit thin, on the medium side of beer mouthfeel but with that low carbonation the flavors linger and and I like that. Overall this is a good beer. I wonder what its like fresh? This bottle has to be a bit older but I like it and since I live near Oregon, I can get this really cheap. Its worth the price. I'll get it again if I want a dark low end beer.","Vancoubeer","Dec 03, 2012"

The base stout, however, isn't up to the challenge. Mildly roasty, not chocolatey enough and rather thin, the base stout really is disappointing. Drying, roasty, faintly watery and with a nice lingering coffee flavor on the finish, this beer is medium-light in body. Carbonated a little too highly for my liking, the carbonic acid clashes with the excellently expressed coffee acidity. The hoppy bitterness on the finish is a nice touch. Decent stuff, it could use just a touch of sweetness and body to go with the rather excellent coffee flavor.","DefenCorps","Sep 15, 2012"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, dirt/earth, and some super roasty espresso and coffee aromas. Taste is much the same along with a cocoa flavor. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel.

The nose starts with bold roasted coffee paired with a dry roasted barley quality. Notes of dark chocolate come in as well as a tinge of hops to round things out. Taste lacks malty sweetness and stays on the dry roasted malty side of things. Very dry on the finish and not a whole lot of depth to the flavor. Mouthfeel is moderately carbonation with somewhat light body. Lots of espresso here as well as roasted malts, but there is not enough sweetness to balance out these flavors. The results is somewhat ashy and overly dry.","homebrew311","Aug 13, 2012"

Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, roasted malt, vanilla, cream, biscuit, and light herbal hops. Nice and well balanced stout aromas with good strength. Taste of chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malt, biscuit, caramel, molasses, vanilla, cream, and light herbal. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, biscuit, and herbal hops on the finish for a short bit. Great balance of flavors, with a nice amount of robustness. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol presence is pretty much invisible as expected for 5.8%. Overall this is a damn nice coffee stout. A lot of well balanced flavors; with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel.
