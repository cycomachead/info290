"Very rich coffee and spicy rye flavor, deep roast, creamy body in a relatively low ABV package. Totally satisfying, not the least bit thin or watery. Would work nicely with a light barrel treatment ... or as a hearty breakfast beer."

"Dry, burnt toast flavor up front. Good bittering hop balance. Not much dark chocolate or coffee but this is still very flavorful. Reminds me of nearly burnt toast. Rather full busy for the style but the bubbles balance it out well."

"The beer is black with an inch of beige cap. The aroma brings big dark roast, chocolate, light spice, a touch of hops. The flavor offers a big roasted malt and chocolate bill with hints of coffee and smoke. Rye character emerges mid to late palate and really adds a nice touch. Medium to full bodied and smooth. A delicious beer. I'd have this again."

"Baume has always been a highly enjoyable beer in my eyes and one I pick up multiple times each year. There's great depth, especially with the spicy rye, and a bold hopping. Good looks, great flavors, and high drinkability wraps up this 7% stout. Here's to Half Acre!"

"Overall - Just doesn't do it for me. Barely a stout."

"O Very enjoyable. Rye beers are so unique and this is a good example. The flavors, mostly roasted coffee and rye, mesh well. The aroma hinted at a little more than was there in the flavor. Powerful aftertaste. I like a good dry bitter stout (though this comes close to a Scotch ale) every now and then. Glad I had it."

"Overall this beer is pretty sessionable in my opinion. It clocks in at only 6.5% (stated on the bottle) so a bomber is easy to finish up myself. I like the flavors but I love smell!"
""
"O: This is so nearly a good beer. Nailed the appearance, scent, even mouthfeel but the generic bitterness held it back. Next time I want a beer like this, I'll be reaching for Wookey Jack."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, rye, and cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with rye and cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells better than it tastes in my opinion."

"O- a nicely done rye stout (if you don't like the flavor it scent if rye, why drink a rye stout after all?). I would have like a bit more layering of flavors, but overall a very solid beer."

"Verdict: A nice easy stout from Half Acre, it's not in your face, but it doesn't hide anything either, very sessionable and enjoyable as a nightcap. After having this and Hearths Ablaze, I am really beginning to enjoy their lighter American Stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid effort."
"Overall: I like the flavors, but it could use some more rye. Wish it was thicker, too. I would have this again."
""
""
"O: Very different, a light, dry stout with a different take. Not as complex as it could be, but certainly off the beaten path. Probably not a beer I'd frequent but definitely enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty nice stout that hits some unusual notes with the rye and more prominent hops than you’d expect. Not the usual fare and a nice change-up from that. Definitely worth a flyer."
""
""
"O: Pretty enjoyable stout - the rye and hops are a bit bracing, even after the aging, but I think it works with the beer."
""
""
"A superior stout from Chicago trip of 5 months back. Well features rye spicy characteristic, hops not overpowering and lending some citrus to the chocolate flavour , some ageing probably helping there. Very creamy thick, lasting head, thick chocolate. A nice drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Super spicy. For what it is it’s awesome, but you gotta love rye. Thanks again jbck109."
""
"O - A nice stout, but not something I could drink a lot of. The rye and hops are just a bit too much for me (even though I love both), and I think I'd rather have a porter or brown then go back to this when I'm in the mood for something dark. Decent."
""
""
""
"(D)- A nice stout for sure. Balanced and easy drinking. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: decent stout. not on the same level as Big Hugs in my opinion but that is an imperial stout of course. rye adds a nice accent, not dominant in any way. Not sure I'd seek this out again but glad I had a chance to try it."
""
""
""
"O: I liked the flavors the rye incorporated. It didn't dominate the chocolate flavors of the stout and it really balanced everything out."
"O: This a fine American Stout. As far as regular non whatever barrel aged stouts go, this is one of the better stouts I've had."
"O- Never had anyhting like this. That being said I would like to try more rye chocolate stouts"
""
""
""
"This is a really smooth but complex brew, probably the best I have had from this brewery."
""
""
""
"Cost: $7.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
"O- Very good regular stout. Like the citrus hop aroma and taste. Will buy this one yearly."
"This is a quality stout. Well balanced and while not extremely complex, it hits the notes really well and is really enjoyable"

"Digging the dark malt flavors combined with a peppery/rye bread spice. Firm bitterness helps balance the brew while lending a drinkability that keeps me back for another sip. The type of beer I'd love to have easier access to and another impressive offering from a brewery that keeps churning out winners."

"Edit: It did cross my path. 2012 version, a few months old, out of the bottle: Much more rye heavy. Awesome bittersweet cocoa roastiness throughout. Similar to Everett by HF (I know... strange comparison) in it's lingering, delicious aftertaste. A great improvement over last year for me."

"Overall I really enjoyed my first Half Acre offering. I don't believe this was brewed or designed to blow my socks off or to be the next great ""want", but what it was, was really really good. Thanks to injuredreserve for this extra."
"Overall: Very impressed by this brew; while it has strongly contrasting flavors, it packs a wallop of flavor at a fairly reasonable ABV"
"4/26/2011"
"D - Nicely balanced and very easy drinking for 7%. Very tasty."
"Smooth and tasty beer that is borderline sessionable just because of the abv.%. Glad I bought this beer and would reccomend it to any stout aficionado."
"o - Overall a nice stout. Roasted characteristics dominate, but the rye isn't lost in the nose or taste. Would like to try again sometime."
"O- ""Dry-hopped rye stout?"" I said(!) ""Sign me up!"" I came to this beer with no hyped-up expectations; only curiosity and a love of each individual component that Half Acre brought together in this beer. The flavors just didn't work together for me, unfortunately. Perhaps I'll try it again down the road."
"Drinkability: Normally, I’m not a huge fan of dry-hopped stouts, but something about the spiciness of the rye helps offset the bitterness of the hops and makes for a very pleasing balance in this beer. And, at 7%, this beer is a sipper, but it’s not a nurser, and I like it."
"o - overall a good beer, but in the land of stouts, this one is not special...except in the way that it is porter-like."
"M. Perfect full body, everything I want in a stout. Alcohol is well hid."
"Notes: An all together delightful stout. When I was in Chicago, a guy at the beer store I went to talked me out of getting this bottle. I agree with his assessment that it is in no way extreme, but I think he undersold it's merits and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a solid, non-extreme stout!"
"M: Smooth, almost creamy and thin at the same time though."
"This pours an opaque brown with a dry looking two finger sandy head that leaves good lace. On the nose there is a great combination of chocolate malt and spicy rye with toasted grain underneath. In the mouth there is the combination of roasted malts with slightly bitter coffee-like notes mixing with the rye. It seems simple when you spell it out but it's a really great taste and an especially great aroma. This would probably be a good beer without the rye but the spiciness adds quite a bit of interest for me. The finish is long with the chocolate and espresso aromas fading away leaving a nice spicy rye to hang out for a spell. Overall I like this beer a good deal, and it has me wondering why rye stouts aren't as common as, say, oatmeal stouts. This is definitely a beer I'll be looking for again and a style I'll keep my eye out for. Half Acre has a really great and unique stout on their hands here, and I hope it becomes a regular in their lineup."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. Pours rich and dark out of the bottle to little head, settling on a nice caramel lace. The smokey aroma blends nicely with a hint of coffee. This stout drinks very smooth and is balanced across the palate. Cellar if you like, but definitely drink now."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with spot on carbonation. You are left with a continuous stickiness following each gulp/sip because of the higher IBU level. Overall I really enjoyed this beer, which is saying a lot because I usually hate dark malty beers which are highly hopped. This rye stout is quite interesting and worth a try if you can find it, definitely recommended for the unique and quality flavors that this brew offers."
"3.5 D: Not bad and I love the rye flavor, but the rest of the beer is a bit lacking. I'm not a big fan of stouts with noticeable hop components either."
"Overall, this is a great stout. Nothing much to improve on; with some aging, this might be winner."
"overall - a crazy drinkable dry stout - drinking this made me think of other stouts that are as good that are made year round since this is a one time wonder - glad i got to sip on this one"
"Overall: Was it hopped? - Yes. Was there a rye aspect? - Yes. Was it stout? - Yep. This was a beer worth trying. To me the rye took a supportive role. The stout aspect took center stage while the hops acted like the rug that tied everything together."
"O - Surpringly, this is a pretty solid beer, not sure I would seek it out, but it's not bad drinking."
"Overall: A very subtly delicious offering from Half-Acre. This beer is part English RIS, part rye beer and all delicious. Like they suggest on their site, ""Specialty Brew. Get it when you see it."""
"So now I know basically where hydrometers and whatnot come from. Thanks, Half Acre. This bit of edutainment pours a thick dark black-brown topped by finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises chocolate, roasted malts, cedar, pine, greens, and flowers. The taste holds notes of dark chocolate, light red grapes, black pepper, roasted malts, generic wood (kind of a pressed fiberboard character), greens, and the white part of an orange peel. The body is a hefty-feeling medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a nice stout, but I don't think the hops, rye, and roast contingents really get along all that well. Interestingly, though, this stuff goes down pretty easily."
"This beer pours a nice decent blackness topped by an off white foam that fades to lacing only. The smell is nice. I get aromatics of herbal hops and dark roast coffee. The espresso aroma smells almost of smoked coffee beans, it's rather nice. The flavor is a smoked woodsy malt flavor. There is a touch of grapefruit from the hops. Most of the flavor is drown out by the coffee with I know to be located in this beer. There is an acidic nature that comes along with the coffee that's a tad off-putting. The mouthfeel was pretty decent for an average stout. There is just something off about how all of the flavors work together and with the acidity. It's a pretty darn good beer, but I feel there is room for improvement."
"Pairing Notes: This brew was acquired for the intention of a nice little beer dinner with the lady. Only one course and a dessert, we didn't go crazy. For dinner I made a Jambalaya with Zataran's Jambalaya mix and some quality Polish Kielbasa. The semi-spicy character of the seasonings along the smoked sausage brought out much of the roasted gran in the beer. Again, this resulted in chocolate and coffee flavors, the rye being mostly absorbed (Note: the beer was initially reviewed before eating any food for a pure beer flavor judgment). I highly suggest pairing this beer with a fairly spicy food - Mexican, Cajun, BBQ, etc., but not too spicy, just enough to play with. The dessert was the real prize match, though. I picked up two slices of Sour Cherry Pie from Erwin Cafe (on Halstead), along with what appeared to be homemade vanilla ice cream. The ice cream didn't wow me, but the cherry pie, world class on its own, made the beer taste just like a great Italian espresso. Pair this brew with fruit desserts, maybe a fruit tart or your own favorite cherry pie, and be in for delicious treat."
"Decent enough stout but the mint/menthol thing is a bit weird. Slightly ashy and acrid with a mild grainy character from the Rye."
"D: Goes down relatively easy, tasty, somewhat filling, mild kick, and an interesting take on the style. At time the rye character was a bit much, but the roastiness and chocolate help this beer out."
"Overall, this is one of the roastiest beers I've ever had. If there's no coffee in here, I'd be incredibly impressed with the flavor they packed in. However, the bitterness is almost overpowering and takes it slightly out of balance. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy this beer, but I'm afraid there's just something just a tad off about it and my rating has to reflect that."
"Notes: While this really doesn't have any impact on the beer, I really enjoy the label design."
"Served from a 22 oz bottle. Pours a deep, ruby black, with a moderate head that settles down to a light cocoa colored 3'4 inch layer of foam. Aroma is dominated by roasted coffee notes, but these are a bit restrained, and not as overpowering as found in other examples of the style. Coffee also predominates in taste, but there is also the subtlest evidence of some flowery/herbal presence in the background, which I find unusual for a stout, but welcome nonetheless. Mouthfeel is extremely well rounded, and not at all cloying or heavy. Overall, a very interesting take on the style, and in fact, it probably ranks among my favorite stouts."
"D: This is a nice and different stout. It's a dry stout/milk/brown/rye. Worth giving it a try. The 7% ABV is well hidden."
"D-A really easy drinking and solid stout. The ""handsomely hopped"" billing didn't really come through for me, nor did the rye, but nevertheless a very delicious beer."
"Drinkability: I liked the rye addition, but the flavor just did not blow me away. It seems like this falls in the zone of stouts that are not full enough to rock my world but not quite small enough to be easy drinkers."
"Pours black, hints to dark chestnut brown at the edges. Billowing tan head; lofty, creamy and dense. Smells of mild cold coffee and chocolate with a touch of caramel sweetness. Thick and heavy in many respects. Rye and big dark/milk chocolate are here first, with some bitter coffee and roastiness. Coffee-like bitterness, dry and lengthy finish. Good full mouthfeel, chewy and really drinkable for it's density. Quite nice overall."
"drinkability: strong"
"lower carbonation, creamy head, smooth. easy to work through the big bottle quickly"
"D - This is a pretty nice stout. So far I've really liked from Half Acre."
"Drinkability- Not bad but a little too hoppy for the style. You don't really expect this kind of bitterness in a stout. The rye might be a bit more enjoyable as well if the hops were toned down ever so slightly. Still though, this is very drinkable and I'm digging it. Thank much Joseph!"
"F: Finishes still pretty bitter, but not quite overwhelming, just on the cusp of it. The bitterness seems to come more from the earthy charred malts still, but some from earthy spicy hops. Again the rye comes through, with a spicy quality and definite rye taste, but it's mostly buried in the stout flavors and bitterness. Speaking of which, more stout flavors. Creamy and rich, with dark malts, roasty malts, a little coffee still. Tasty and smooth, perhaps just a little too bitter. I'm also just starting to get a briny and minerality taste, probably from all the roasted malts and perhaps even the rye."
"Great looking black beer with a creamy khaki colored head. The aroma has a slight rye spice, smoke, and chalky bitter chocolate. Warm and inviting. Also, a trace of hoppy pine. The taste is roasty chocolate, hints of rye, with a smoky finish. Heavy medium to full bodied, a very satisfying brew."
"D: A good beer. Complex enough to be interesting, but simple enough to be an easy drinker."
"D: I enjoyed this beer. Very roasty. The smell wasnt great, but the relatively low ABV makes this a drinkable stout. If you like rye flavors in beer, this is a must try!"
"D - The bitterness and burnt, earthy, flavors get a little tiring, as does the carbonation. Otherwise the pleasant texture, low ABV, and aroma make this fairly appropriate for sessions."
"Mouthfeel is a little above medium bodied and carbonation is moderate to low. Drinkability is very good, I love rye flavors in beer and this showcased that excellently. I loved the way the rye blended so nicely with the chocolate and roasted stout flavors. Anyone that likes rye should drink this beer."
"D - This is not a session for me."
"Pours black with a plentiful, bubbly head. Aroma is spicy with rye, estery yeast notes, lightly malty. Tastes estery like Belgian yeast, prickly hops, ashy, full bitterness. Finish has bitter chocolate and cookie. Feels prickly and overcarbonated, body seems light. I seem to be in the minority here, but I didn't care for this experience much."
"an absolute treat and a reminder of why beers are brewed. they are to be fun to make and fun to drink, to share with friends. i will remember the rye and the hops with the next stout i brew. thank you half acre, and thank you, joe"
"D: It's been a while since I've had a stout and I like what I'm getting out of this one. An good sipper, interesting flavor profiles and goes down easily. Sad to see the end of this bottle."
"D: This was a really interesting beer, nothing else I've had is really similar. I love trying beers that fit that description, but many times they aren't all that great. This one was not in that category, however."
"D:another solid offering in the line up of Half Acre beers. I enjoyed this one much more than the Big Hugs as I found the flavors to be bolder and more complex. Too bad this is such a limited release."
"Drinkability: Can't imagine having more than one of these, though the 22oz bomber will disappear no problem."
"D: A good American stout, but I wish there were more rye smells/flavors present for a beer labeled as a ""rye stout."" Between Half Acre's two stouts, I prefer the bolder Big Hugs Imperial Stout over this one."
"Driknkability: Thin mouthfeel and low abv makes this one fairly drinkable for the style. But the flavor profile is lackluster."
"not bad, not great. Got this bottle a few months ago at Sam's in Chicago. Poured with a medium head and a little lace. Color is very dark mahoganey. Aroma is roasty, malty, dark ripe fruit, hoppy. flavor's about the same. Bit of a boozy finish. Noting special. Body's ok, decent carbonation. finishi is ok too."
"D: Very nice. Our first experience with anything brewed in their brand new brewwery."
"Medium body, light carbonation. Filling. Good one, but not something to buy a six pack of."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation."
"Drinkability - The bitter finish and the slick/thick mouthfeel consipre with the alcohol in the top/middle of the range for stouts makes this less than sessionable. Not a bad brew by any means, rather tasty in fact, and local, the brewery being about three blocks from my house. But this is not as thirst-quenching/inducing as some drier stouts."
"D- This beer has a nice big rye flavor but the stout itself is pretty soft and subtle. The finish is a bit tangy with a pretty large bitterness."
"D: Between the lighter mouthfeel and interesting finish, I could easily see myself putting down a couple of pints of this in an evening."
"Smell and taste have the chocolate malts and spiciness from the rye here. Hints of coffee and cocoa, very satisfying. A quaffer for sure, the rye gives it a nice drinkability, medium body, well done at this abv, and I will continue to seek out this brewers beers."
"D; above average"
"Pours a very dark brown, nearly black in color. There's a khaki colored head of about an inch on top of the beer. Smell is roasted malts and an abundance of piney hops. Contrary to the masses, I particularly don't like my stouts to be this hoppy, but for what it is, it's enjoyable. Very smooth and easy drinking. There's a very high amount of bitterness in the mouthfeel. This is a very well done beer, without any flaws that I can see. Just a bit overly hopped for my personal tastes. Well done and the beer is gone in the blink of an eye. The rest of the beer becomes more balanced once it starts to warm up a bit. Solid offering."
"Dry bready pumpernickel and bakers chocolate, spicy with hops or rye elements. Lots of roastiness. If you like dark unsweetened chocolate, the 90% cacao stuff, this stout is definitely one for you. The hops linger in the dry aftertaste, adding a leafy element to the residual chocolate and roast. The body is medium, just short of full, which is an asset. A bomber is the perfect size to get acquainted with this Rye Stout, and definitely not while double-fisting with another beer, duh. Definitely impressed by this, glad to see Half Acre flexing their creative muscles...make this year round guys!!"
"I had this on tap at Sheffield's in lakeview. I really would be doing this beer a disadvantage to truly rate it because I had a FFF brian brau in the other hand. It was a very good stout and would enjoy another. It was extremely untypical with it's hoppy characteristics. Because of my aforementioned opposing beer I will refrain from calling it too simple."
