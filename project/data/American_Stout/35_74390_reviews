"O: This is a decent stout. Big coffee flavor but for me a little too big, It lacks something, perhaps a complexity that other stouts have. It's definitely a beer that I would have no problem sitting back with on a cold winter night."

"Overall: Great take on a coffee type stout, one of the better stouts I have had lately."

"Overall: Comes off as a very average stout that is really lacking in the coffee department."

"Coffee, malt, slight caramel notes"

"Atmosphere is good. Dark hue, nice foamy head, pretty heavy lacing. Nose is roasted malt and espresso with woody and sweet tones. Pungent roasted components make up the flavor base with some bitter and sweet notes. Well-balanced. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"A great coffee beer with an upfront yet not overpowering coffee character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall was surprised by the watery consistency of this brew. Although the coffee is not overdone it is a bit out of balance with the consistency. Drinkable and may be a good introduction to the style but I will not have another."
""
""
"Single finger head on a dark body with little light passing through which produces a reddish hue. Standard roasted malt and hint of coffee aroma you would expect, nothing great or special. Flavor is much better with sweet milk chocolate throughout. The coffee and roasted malts add a lot of flavor without being too bitter. Excellent lacing with medium to thick body and light to moderate carbonation. Very drinkable beer. I like coffee heavy beers but there is enough coffee to satisfy coffee lovers but not too much to turn off those who aren't coffee fans."

"D - Very drinkable. Good coffee stout. Nice balance of roasted coffee flavors with a stout base."
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a perfect pint glass. It has a jet black body with a small tan head that lays down quickly to a nice lace. The smell is of roasted malt and some coffee notes. The taste does have coffee on the front of the tonuge, also has a roasted malt taste on the back of the tongue. The mouth feel is nice and smooth with a little bit of a coffee after taste on the tongue. Overall i enjoyed this beer but one is enough for me."
""
"Pours jet black with a tan head. In the aroma, dry roast coffee. In the taste, dry coffee, with notes of roast and lactose. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry coffee and small sweet lactose in the aftertaste. A nice coffee balance with a nice roasty malt."
""
"Nothing worth seeking out, a very average coffee stout. 3.5"
""
""
""
""
"Let some pork tenderloin have a bath in a marinade with this as a base. Then enjoy with another glass"
""
"From a 12 oz bottle into a duvel tulip. Pours a very dark brown, almost black with a finger length tan head that shrinks to nothing and leaves decent lacing. Aroma is espresso, chocolate, toasted barley, and very faint pine. Taste is good black coffee, bitter chocolate, cream, and some astrigency. Thin mouthfeel. Decent coffee stout."
""
""
""
"A says 'Cookoo for Cocoa Puffs'. In a good way. Which is odd because she doesn't care for chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
"I could not pick up any roasted malt, patent, chocolate malt, or anything..just coffee coffee coffee"
""
""
"(D)- A nice little brew for a brisk night outside. Solid for the style."
"O - all night drinker..."
""
"3.7/5.00"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark black with some foam at onset to a small layer. Strong espresso and coffee bean smell. Really roasted coffee taste and a strong coffee finish. Smooth chocolate malt in between. More coffee than beer. Bitter finish. Nice new stout. Like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final thought - below %6 abv and nothing amazing, this one is kept for the Christmas season"

"Pours dark chestnut bordering on ebony. A decent sized mocha head was achieved with a vigorous pour and left appreciable lacing. The aroma is primarily coffee with perhaps a hint of chocolate. The flavor matches the smell, though I find it to be very one-dimensional. The coffee flavor is closer to your generic cup of joe as opposed to any fancy artisinal brew. This lends an ascerbic element to the coffee that I don't particularly enjoy, yet appears all too common in coffee themed beers. This wouldn't be too much of a problem if there were stronger supporting flavors to shoulder the load, but unfortunately bitter black coffee is the only prominent taste. Maybe if you look hard you can find some milk chocolate in there, and a meager dose of hops, but on the whole there is a surprising lack of substance for the style. This isn't a terrible brew in that it is technically drinkable, but there's not much to relish in a thin, bitter, one-dimensional stout."

"Overall a decent coffee beer. No overwhelmingly strong flavors, but fairly well balenced. Wish it was sweeter and had a more solid beer base."
""
""
""
""
""
"Brew is good and sessionable and has some different things going on other than what you would you would expect from a straight up coffee stout. Good solid brew, wish it was a bit more chewy and thick though. Good though."
""
"O: I like this beer quite a bit, it is nice to have a solid stout with the coffee addition vs. a RIS with coffee (I like those also). This makes me want to brew a sweet stout with coffee, something I would not have thought of before having this beer. I would not reach for this all the time, but I have enjoyed the couple out of the mixed pack. I would definitely pick up a sixer next fall/winter."
""
""
""
"M - Solid medium body with moderate carbonation."
""
""
"This coffee stout does not disappoint if you're craving a brew that tastes like coffee. Pours a dark black with a 1/2 inch foamy tan head, leaving a good amount of lacing along the glass. The smell is bitter, chocolatey, sweet; the taste is also bitter, with hints of molasses, caramel, chocolate, and roasted coffee. Towards the end, the flavors dissipate a bit and you're left with basically just the bitterness. Although most like to pair a coffee or oatmeal stout with dessert, I'm more along the lines of pairing these types of stouts (and imperial stouts) with a good burger. I'd have this one again if I was eating a burger, or maybe as an after-dinner brew, but it's definitely a novelty beer imo as opposed to a truly great stout."

"An intense coffee experience that I would classify as an after dinner / dessert beer. Probably wont agree with everyone but I thought it was very enjoyable."
""
"had this around the holiday season and it was a decent sipping beer... it tasted and finished really good... i wana try it on tap and see if there is a difference then the bottle... i enjoy most of Sam Adams beer this one i'll enjoy again im sure...!!"
"O: Another nice offering in the Sam Adams Winter pack. There are richer and more flavorful coffee stouts out there and I wouldn't be thrilled or disappointed if this was around next year. Nice change of space, but nothing special."
""
""
"O- the flavor can't live up to the nose, but it is still a tasty coffee stout. Bottle says the finish has notes of dark fruit too, that would have been nice, oh well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty decent but not great stout, but enjoyable enough and worth having. Not going to win any awards, but I wouldn't turn it down in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Incredibly drinkable but this one is a little one dimensional; the coffee dominates the stage front and center without much to back it up."
""
""
""
""
"Taste follows suit, maybe a touch sweeter than expected. Moderate quality coffee, more drip than press or espresso, healthy dose of cream and sugar, dry cocoa powder and a touch of dark fruit. Not overly complex, but easy drinking. Medium bodied, a touch thin for the style, would have liked a little more heft or coating. A nice approachable coffee stout for the masses."
""
""
""
"Overall this is actually a pretty tasty cofee stout. I remember the 1st time I tried it was back during the tasters choice in 08 or 09. This lost out to the Blackberry Wheat, I don't know why, I think this is a much better beer. It's an excellent addition to the Winter Classic pack in my opinion."
"O- pretty much what I expected from a Sam Adams stout: drinkable, but not otherworldly"
"O: Drinkable if you like black coffee – which is OK in moderation. Make sure to serve this at the proper temp."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good choice for anyone with a different outlook on what they want from their beer. Definately an A plus for any stout fan. One of the best stouts I've had the pleasure to try. This is a definite must try during the holiday season."
"O - Pretty typical for a Sam Adams, nothing too ambitious (not necessarily a bad thing) but unique in its own right. Wish it would have had a bigger body and more alcohol, but overall not bad."
""
""
"Pours out a dark brown so deep in color it passes for black until you hold it up to the light. Tan colored head with some decent retention but only mediocre lacing levels. Nice bitter chocolate presence but the real show stealer is the amazingly fresh coffee flavor and aroma that upstages everything. Texture is perhaps a wee bit thinner than it ought to be for such bold and aggressive flavoring, but the carbonation is alright. Memorable for having an extremely fresh and delicious coffee flavor emphasis that outshines the weaker roasted malts in the background."
"It's very strong and tasty and would go great with some eggs and bacon after a long night of drinking."
""
"Overall a solid coffee stout, one that could be overlooked if one only looks at imperials, but should be appreciated on its own level."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer showed a lot of promise, but didn't fully deliver. Still, it is a very good stout, and for coffee stouts, it's one of the best I've had. The acidity that the coffee brings isn't the most pleasant addition to the beer, but the flavor is nice, the body is good, and the look is magnificent."
""
"Appearance pours a very dark brown having a easily dissipating head leaving nil lace. Smell of roasted malt/coffee, chocolate and creamer. Taste of the coffee, maybe more of chocolate covered coffee beans, roasted malt with light caramel and dark fruits. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. It has a nice flavor of coffee thats enjoyable for coffee lovers that has a little alchohol involved."
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown/black color with a mild light brown head. Scent is mostly of robust malts and cocoa. Not too much of a coffee scent. Taste is rather mild for a stout. Starts off with a bold cocoa/coffee flavor but finishes rather clean with not much of an after taste. Rather smooth and filling making for a great sipping stout."
""
""
""
"Poured a dark black color with a one finger caramel colored head which disappeared quickly. Smell of dark coffee roasted malts and a kiss of vanilla. Medium carbonation which fizzles in the palate. The body is a bit thin for this style of beer. Tastes of strong coffee grains and light chocolates. Sweet and bitter which balances out okay.. but leaves the palate feeling a bit slimey. Overall this is not bad.. but it is not great. Probably wont buy again."
"Drinkability - one of the best Sam Adams one-offs I've had. Worth it's one carton in my opinion."
"O: A drinkable brew that is smooth has light mellow flavor and some balance. It does not knock socks off, but it is drinkable."
""
"An opaque brown-black colored stout with a decent light tan head that clears to more of filmy ring with good signs of lacing. The nose picks up a firm coffee scent, somewhat Kaluha I think. Cocoa as well. The flavor says lots more coffee, bitter grounds and a touch of charcoal softened by mild chocolate wash. I pick up the usual bit of prune darkness with peppery edges. Body is medium-plus with a smooth but somewhat chalky feel. Carbonation is quite modest but adequate, making for an overall good coffee beer."
""
"Sammy A has done it again! SOB this is a good beer. The Black & Brew pours a nearly opaque deep rich amber with ecru head that is lacing. The smell is espresso with hints of semi sweet choclate. The taste is like a mochacinno delight...espresso with chocolate...I luv when a brewer hits his mark. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a taste beer....that really hit the mark."
"Overall: One of the best Samuel Adams I've had. Well balanced and reminded me a little of FBS. Good work Mr. Adams. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty good, a coffee forward stout that looks and smells really good and taste so so. A good addition to the Holiday sampler."
""
"O - This is a solid coffee-dominated brew from Sam Adams. I thought the taste was pretty good, but the aroma and mouthfeel is what stands out for me. This beer is definitely a worthy addition to the Winter Classics variety pack and one that I would enjoy having again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-it's ok, but I really don't think I'd search it out again..."
""
""
"Overall: A nice change of pace, im just starting to learn to enjoy a stout now and then, a decent attempt by Sam Adams at a coffee stout."
""
"The beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied with brisk enough carbonation that this feels pleasurable, yet still smooth and mildly creamy on the palate. The finish is dry, though a bit too sticky and sweet around the periphery."
""
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and very creamy. This is one of my top 3-5 SA beers of all time. I was really pleased with this one. I suspect this would be a great ""coffee gateway"" beer as the coffee isnt in your face but more subdued and milder. A great beer indeed!"
""
""
""
"Great looking black pour with a large off-white head. Good roasty coffee and malt notes on the nose, with a touch of chocolate. The taste is also quite good, with a fairly complex journey of the bitter coffee and roast notes coming through first, then some of the sweeter chocolate malts come through with a bit of a creamy taste as well. The mouthfeel is fairly creamy and has a satisfying amount of body, and the drinkabilty is very good. Overall, a great coffee stout. Too bad that the odds are pretty high that it's a one-off."
"O - Black and Brew is a solid coffee stout. A great addition to the Winter mix pack, the Black and Brew is quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O: I like this and would get it again, but I really like stouts and I like coffee so its right up my alley."
""
"Overall this is a very nice beer and a must-try for coffee fans."
""
""
"Overall, a very good stout. Not too light, not too heavy. The coffee aspect isn't overbearing. Well-balanced and tasty..."
""
"O: Reminds me of an iced coffee for some reason. Nice stout but nothing overpowering. Worth a try."
"Pours a dark black with brownish edges and a creamy mocha head that settles to a nice cap, leaving lots of spotty lacing. Sweet and rich aromas of coffee beans, chocolate, cream and sugar. Really coffee-forward, but not insanely intense. Taste is spot-on with the nose, sweet flavors of chocolate and cream with a pleasantly bitter fresh-ground coffee character. Nicely balanced, and quite drinkable for a coffee Stout. Smooth and creamy, with a medium-thin body and good carbonation. Overall a solid coffee Stout, that is insanely drinkable."
""
""
"Could be decent as a dessert beer I guess If you wanted a dessert beer with a very low abv (but who does?)"
""
"O: not a bad brew, just too smokey in the middle for what i had expected and hoped for, still drinkable and decent"
"Overall, I like this one, almost a lot. This is the first Sam Adams I've had where I think they've got most of it right. Most of their other offerings have just been ok, but this one gets a lot right."
"This was a respectable coffee stout. I have definitely had better, but I would definitely have this one again. This is probably one of Boston Beer's better additions to their catalog."
""
""
""
""
"O - Definitely a roasty coffee blast, a little sweetness and dark fruit balance it out nicely. Not over the top as the smell might suggest. Overall not too shabby, a very welcome addition to the winter classics mix (which has always been my favors Sam Adams variety)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is more coffee flavor than a stout with coffee taste. I prefer the latter. But all in all an enjoyable and highly drinkable beer and a fun addition to this years package."
""
""
""
"There's just enough of a hop balance to compliment this brew's other attributes and it is definitely boozy enough to make it a very satisfying treat at the end of the day."
""
"I'm a sucker for coffee stouts, and this is no exception. A real easy drinker. Pours dark with a moderate head. It's not outstanding in any regard, with your typical malty front and bitter coffee finish, but its overall just a nice brew. Won't turn this one down if offered, but there are better coffee stouts out there."
"I don't think I've had a tastier coffee flavored beer. It's a little rich and sweet for quaffing, but a nice nip. From the 13 oz bottle."
""
""
""
"O: very good beer! the abv is relatively low which aids in making this a highly drinkable beer. Probably one of the better Sam Adams beers i've tasted."
""
""
"Overall- This coffee stout has great flavors and really surprised me! The mouth feel is a little lacking, but other than that, this is a very solid coffee stout."
""
""
""
"Overal im happy and impressed with this beer, I dont understand the low reviews by some, its a very good coffee stout"
"d ; think of this as a desert beer. not bad at all but not for guzzling"
""
"This one had the complexities but some of the flavors were just not to my liking."
""
"M: Good coffee that trails off into caramel and mild roast. Decent and the coffee kick-off, as I've stated above, is worth it."
""
""
""
"3.5/3.5/3/3/3"
""
"Nice taste, dry, roasty, plenty of coffee, no astringent bitterness, creamy without feeling like there was a lactose addition or other type of adjunct thrown in. Really tastes artisan in the sense that it is craftfully done in a simple and minimalistic way. Chocolate malt, roasted two row, coffee press and done and easy to drink. Very enjoyable when you're getting it for $1 a bottle."
"Had a bottle tonight at a friend's house. Poured into a standard pint glass. Light black color, with a nice sized white head. Smell had a nice aroma of rich coffee. Taste was fairly good for a new Sam Adams attempt at a style. You could really taste the flavors of the coffee, which complimented well the flavors of chocolate from the roasted dark malt. My only knock on this beer was the mouthfeel. I felt it was a bit too bitter and astringent. Not a bad beer after all. Definitely a decent offering in their winter mix pack."
""
""
""
"A very good coffee infussed Stout that rejects the temptation to forge into Imperial Stout catagories and remains lighter and more drinkable."
""
""
"Cheers!!"
"D: Not bad but not very balanced. Chocolate and espresso roast are ok but bitterness may be a bit too much to be completely enjoyable. I like the addition to the winter pack, but it's one of my least favorite included."
""
"Enjoyable and I drank the second bottle as my ""next"" out of the holiday pack."
""
"Pours almost jet black with a few ruby hints. There is less than a finger worth of tan head with no retention. The nose is complex - coffee, chocolate and caramel are all present. The upfront flavor is that of a relatively light and toasty stout.This offering lacks the roasted bite that I really look for in a stout, but it makes up for that detriment with a good combination of flavors - some roast, some sweet notes as well. As this beer warms, the bitterness in the finish becomes more noticeable. Not exceptional, but very good."
"O: A good stout, not a great one. To me it comes off as a slightly watered down version, like they were afraid to really commit to a dark, bitter, heavy beer. It's pretty good, for what it is."
"O: Liked it more than I expected I would. Typically not a fan of coffee beers, but this one was ok."
"This is a desert beer, and a good pairing would be a mocha swirl cheesecake."
""
"Tried this as part of the Sam Adams winter mixed 12 pack. A solid addition, definitely an improvement over the god awful Cranberry Lambic. While the overall flavors are a bit subdue and it's a bit boring in it's overall taste, it's a nice all-around beer that makes for a nice drinker. The coffee taste is definitely present but not overly strong by any means, a good session beer and good mix up compared to the rest of the pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another very good coffee stout; these seem to have gone from rarities to nearly commonplace (e.g., Kona) in a short time."
"Sweetened black coffee up front. Slight burnt caramel. A little hint of dark fruit. Dry finish. Body is Medium, yet pretty creamy."
"While the taste is not as good as the smell, it is still a pretty tasty offering from the BBC. Coffee is still big, but gets a bit acrid and too roasty...does not have enough malt heft and sweetness behind it to back it up. That all leads to a fairly thin mouthfeel and a bitter finish, but not really from the hops. The coffee is fresh tasting though, and the beer still goes down smooth despite the heavy roast. While I probably wouldnt buy a stand-alone sixer of Black & Brew, I think this is a fine addition to the Winter Mixed Pack and would like to see it included again sometime."
""
"O - This is a solid offering. The aroma and flavor are not overpowering but are very noticeable. I probably enjoy the mouthfeel the most. I could very easily down a six pack of this and be left feeling satisfied."
""
""
""
"Taste-Roasted dark malt, roasted coffee, chocolate. Smooth, creamy, nice coffee flavor, well-balnced throughout."
""
""
""
"O - I can say for the first time that the Fezziwig's were not my favorite pair in the Sam's Holiday pack. This guy stole the show and I really hope they bring it back next year. If you enjoy coffee stouts this is worht getting."
"Really enjoy the smoothness of this one though...so drinkable. A pretty darn good stout effort by Sam Adams. Would probably buy this one in a sixer to share as it's pretty drinkable."
"O: Color me impressed with this Boston Beer Company brew. It has a nice look, great flavor, and a great mouthfeel. This is a solid brew."
""
""
""
"Overall – Not a bad-tasting brew at all, especially if you’re one who likes coffee or chocolate-covered expresso beans, but otherwise not very interesting."
""
""
"Easy drinking stout but not the heartiest stout out there. Would of liked more body and stout flavor."
""
""
"I’ve had beers where it simply tastes like coffee watered down or added as an afterthought. This is not one of those beers. This one is balanced and tasty."
""
""
""
"I find that many of the beers made by Sam Adams have very similar characteristics but the Black & Brew Coffee Stout seemed to distinguish itself from the rest. This may not be one of the most exciting coffee stouts on the market but it is definitely worth a try."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a nonic glass. Served cool. Pours an ink black body and a nice dark tan head. Smells like old coffee (agree with Alstrom). Some chocolate. Creamy, some bite at the end and a little boozy. full and dry on the palate. Overall I kind of like this beer despite not having a refined coffee flavor. I would drink this again and think this is a very nice winter breakfast beer."
""
"Poured a very nice dark brown (near black) with some very nice initial head and a bit of lacing as it went down. Nice scent, some good roasted grains and a very nice coffee hit in the nose. Good flavors, well balanced with roasted grains, bitter-sweet coffee flavors, the tiniest hints of chocolate, and a nice coffee and slightly earthy bitter finish. Went down well, this is a good coffee stout."
"I surprising didn’t mind this beer considering that I don’t drink coffee. I’ve never had a beer so similar."
"This is not a bad little coffee stout. I like it better than many I've tried> I'd get this again if no Founders Breakfast Stout was available"
""
"Overall a brew that starts out a little mild and weak, but finishes with a nice strong robust smoky coffee flavor."
"Overall this is a decent beer. Thought I might like it a little more than I did, but that happens. Glad I got a chance to try it. Above average would be a good descriptor."
""
"overall a very solid beer and a nice complement to the seasonal mixed pack. like most sam adams brews it's not going to blow your mind but it holds its own."
""
""
"O: Its a nice tasting beer in the mixed winter pack. Better than the Cranberry Lambic and slightly better than the winter lager , but not as drinkable. Everything else in the mixer is better IMHO."
"O. I'm happy to see Sam Adams continuing to experiment with their seasonal cases and putting in interesting styles. That being said, this drinks like a light, introductory coffee stout/porter. I love the idea of giving this to a person just getting into craft as it is a good intro to the style, but for the initiated who have sampled the likes of FBS and Wake 'n Bake, this brew will do nothing for you."
""
"D: Again, nothing offensive but this isn't great especially considering the competition in the style."
"O: A decent beer to have with friends that are just getting a taste for good beer. Definitely many better coffee stout options."
"Taste of milk chocolate initially and somewhat thin in body in the middle. Improves with a bit of agitation however and yields a light fruity character at that time along with some brown sugar notes. Offers a generally pleasant roast character, becoming a bit dry in the end.."
""
""
"Like most Samuel Adams brews, this one comes really close to be a home run, but falls just short in some way. A welcome, if unexceptionable, addition to one my favorite winter mixes."
""
"Final Thought: It's another solid Sam Adams beer, and a nice complement to the BBC/SA Holiday pack which now boasts three dark beers of the six."
"The feel of this beer is big but not too big. There is a rich flavor and a bit of a dark heavy coffee flavor but the body holds some of the heaviness but lets is slowly slip a away giving a nice drinkable feel."
""
"Easy cream on the mouth with a slight burnt toast finish. Overall ok, better than I thought. The creamy cousin if not more so than Cream Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a slightly less than average coffee stout. The flavors and aroma don't shout out like they should. Still haven't found anything better than Boston Lager from Sam."
""
""
""
"One of BB's better brews and a welcome addition to the Winter Classics pack."
"Overall, this is really good coffee stout. It's not too sweet, it definitely tastes like coffee, and it's very easy to drink."
"The flavor is big up front with dark chocolate and coffee dominating the scene. The malt flavor tastes a little milky like a latte. It finishes a little thin and astringent detracting from the overall flavor. A good stout with some good, big flavors, but one that falls a little short of great."
""
""
""
""
"Overall though still enjoyable to drink, and quite easy and with a very good coffee presence."
"I was really let down by this one. The look and smell were very nice but actually drinking this beer wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped."
""
"It's an A- brew for me and a great Samuel Adams brew both by the style description and personal preferance."
""
""
""
"Overall impression: A coffee beer. More coffee and less beer but it's well crafted. Would like to see more American Stout character but the coffee flavor is well done and works with the style. A definite upgrade to the winter sampler pack."

"Overall: A very solid stout from Sam Adams. Nicely roasty and robust."
""
"Beer is medium in body, mildly bitter at the end with some mild chocolate malt and some coffee. Beer is fine for a little coffee stout and I'd have it again but it's not special in anyway. Medium bodied, mildly sweet stout with coffee."
""
"Great smooth mouthfeel, creamy and almost soothing. How do they do that? Great substance to this beer. An extremely quaff-able stout!!"
""
"Tastes like it smells--it's hard to come up with a neat way to describe something so un-neat. Starts off with raw, nicely rough barley that's more like a porter than a stout. This mellows out into sweeter malt near the middle and then ending on bitter coffee. The body's nice and thick, and the balance is wonderful."
""
""
""
"Crisp, lots of carbonation, too much carbonation to be honest. This still doesn't stop it from being full bodied and nigh creamy. That makes it halfway delightful to feel. Interesting beer, not worth buying the winter classics pack just to try this."
""
""
"D/O: A fairly drinkable coffee stout; tasty, but not as much coffee aroma and flavor as I’d like."
""
"O: An above average coffee stout, and a pleasant addition to the Sam Adams winter sampler pack, my favorite of their seasonal sampler mixes."
"Overall - This is a very enjoyable brew and a nice addition to the holiday 12-pack."
"A refreshing additon to the Sam Adams winter seasonal pack. This has been a solid seasonal pack and the black and brew on a nice compliment to this years variety."
"This was a very good beer. I recommend this, but then... you can only get it in the variety pack."
""
""
"D: Overall it was a very drinkable stout and I really enjoyed the mix of the flavors and feel on this one."
"Pours night black, with two fingers of nice tan/off-brown head that lasts quite a while. Initial aroma is of strong black coffee, roasty and warm, with some chocolate malt in the back. Mouthfeel is adequate, coating but not thick. Tastes like a cold glass of coffee, backed by chocolate (from the malt, I assume). Low levels of a nondescript hop bitterness, with some coffee bite shoring it up. The overall picture is kind of weak. It meets its requirements, but there's something missing... All things considered, it's average, and I'll drink the second in the mix pack if the wife doesn't... She'll have plenty of time to get around to it, though, since I'm not in a rush to refill the glass..."
"O: Slightly above average coffee stout. I haven't had any other coffee stouts before, so I would try this again."
""
""
"This poured out as a deep black color with a brown creamy looking head on top. The lacing is minimal, the rentention is decent. The smell of the beer has a really nice coffee aroma with some malt in there too. The taste of the beer was full of creamy coffee flavors with a healthy amount of sweet dark malts. The finish has a good bitterness. The mouthfeel of the beer is a little thin, could have been a little thicker. Overall this beer was still pretty good and I would enjoy having this one again."
""
""
"O: Possibly the thinnest stout i've ever had and not too flavorful, but still decent. The flavor it does have is enjoyable."
""
"overall: a pretty good coffee stout. got this in the winter 12 mix pack. that is a great seasonal pack that i will buy every year, and this one is good but not the best in the pack"
""
"Overall I thought it was nicely balanced all around and a good addition to their yearly winter multi-pack. Nothing too exciting or memorable but quite drinkable and much better than past Winter Pack beer... Cranberry lambic."
"Coffee and beer...two of my favorite things. I especially love strong, black coffee, so I assumed that this would be great. It's color is absolutely pitch-black, with a thin chocolate colored head. The aroma is less intense than I expected. Although it has some coffee scents (roasted beans) and some chocolate and grain character, it seems one-dimensional. It's a muted, unassuming smell. It doesn't exactly wake you up. The taste is a bit more redeeming...bitter, highly roasted, nearly burnt flavors. It's a bit astringent, but it is also flavorful. The intense deep roast is good, but could use some balance. The body is less full and rich than expected, and isn't helped with the astringent character. Overall, this is an okay brew, but not stellar."
"Overall: for me this was an average coffee stout but I can't say it wasn't enjoyable. As part of the Winter pack, I prefer this style on a cold night."
""
""
""
"O: honestly, if you photoshopped a label and stuck ""Coffee Brown Ale"" on this beer, I very well might have rated it better. To call it a stout really surprised me, and frankly, it disappointed me. Its worth a try if you bought the winterpack it comes with, but don't expect it to replace your favorite stouts"
"O - Not bad, not great. I nice middle of the road stout, If there is supposed to be a lot of coffee in here, I don't taste it, which is fine with me."
""
""
"O: The beer is easy to drink but isn’t very flavorful."
""
"Aroma of raisin and light cocoa, some coffee notes, some sharp espresso and some faint hops. Rich flavor of coffee and cocoa upfront, moving quickly to floral hops, good balance of flavors. Good offsetting bitterness, but not too harsh. Even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, smooth and creamy, I wouldn't mind it being a bit more viscous."
""
""
""
""
"O-its ok. again, im not really a coffee guy. people who enjoy coffee will definately enjoy it IMO"
""
"overall - a decent dessert beer"
"O- Overall a decent stout. It's probably my favorite from the mix pack next to the chocolate bock. Hopefully they make this a six pack, it's pretty good. It would sell I'm sure of it."
"O: I tend to be a defender of the Boston Beer Company's efforts, but this one does not do a thing for me. The best part of it is the smell. If the body were a bit thicker and the carbonation less forceful, I might be inclined to give this beer a better review."
"Overall not bad, a bit too milky and creamy, almost like it has nitro but not quite, decent coffee and milk chocolate, light and drinkable."
""
""
"Overall: I actually quite enjoy this beer and I am glad Sam Adams switched out the stupid white ale in place of this"
"O - Felt this was a nice solid brew, not spectacular but I'd drink it again. Good flavor profile and drinkability."
""
"Overall: Other readers don't seem to think this ranks well among stouts, but I think the flavor is great. I highly recommend it."
"Pretty good, Coffee is there but subtle for the most part."
"O- It doesn't have the mellow notes of higher quality stouts but I like how it smells. The taste is good but it is deadened by that burnt coffee after taste. It's an ok beer but I can't say that I am drawn back to this one."
""
""
""
"Overall: a great dessert beer. Sip and enjoy with a little Hershey's kiss on the side."
""
"O - Yet again this is another beer from the BBC that is a good gateway beer for the style its not overly done or exciting but its an overall good beer worth picking up the mix pack for this beer and the other winter brews in it"
""
""
"i am an irreverent beer snob!"
""
""
""
"I usually shy away from coffee beers, because they rarely do much for me. However, two of my fave SA beers only show up in their ""Winter Classics"" mixer, so I bit the bullet. I came away pleasantly surprised."
"The body is light with lots of carbonation. This one is drinkable, but it's underwhelming. Weak flavors with that are just a bit off. Clearly not the star of the variety pack."
""
""
""
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy, and that flavor is really nice. I could easily have a few of these in a night. The thing I liked about this beer was that I think it is the first coffee stout i have had that wasn't an imperial stout. Usually they are big and boozy, but I like the approach of this beer. It kind of shows a different side of what a coffee stout can be. Overall, I think this is a nice beer and an interesting take on the style. I definitely think this one is worth checking out. I would buy it again if it came in 6-packs."
"Pours out a black color with a nice frothy, tan head. The smell, like a lot of SA Brews, is kind of underwhelming. There are some detectable coffee notes, along with dark chocolate and liqourice aromas. The flavor is nice and bold with big coffee and chocolate malts battling it out for the predominate flavor. It ends with a nice smokey finish. To be honest, this brew reminds me a bit of Guinness and I don't typically make that comparison. It is just has certain pleasant smokey flavor that is nice to find in a Stout once in a while. The hops provide some bitterness but not a lot in the nose unfortunately. What I really like is how well the coffee blends with the dark malts. I was afraid that I would get a stale coffee taste from the brew and I don't get that at all. The coffee bolsters the chocolate malts in a way like eating a nice piece of quality dark chocolate with a fresh cup of joe. Mouthfeel was smooth. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this beer and it actually justified buying the variety pack."
"Overall, this is an impressive new (at least to me) offering from the Boston Beer Company, and an excellent addition to the already-great holiday 12 pack."
""
""
""
"O-this is a pretty good stout. Im not much of a coffee person but I do somehow enjoy some coffee stouts and this one is pretty good."
""
"Final Notes: Not really a fan. About the only thing really great about this beer is the look. There are better stouts to be had, and in my opinion this is Sam Adams' worst attempt at a stout. I'll drink it to get rid of the mixed pack, but I wouldn't buy a sixer of it."
""
"Overall, not a bad coffee beer from Sam Adams."
""
""
""
""
"It does have a fullness of body, also per label, and the carbonation is medium; as a result, it's a very creamy mouthfeel. Yes. I like again and I'm glad there's more of this in the box. Well done."
"O: not bad overall, it does ok in most categories but only truly excels in one, which is the appearance. Definitely worth revisiting though."
""
"Dr: A drinkable beer that is in need of some work, but nonetheless a good one. This approach might work better as a porter rather than a stout. I'd try it on draught, but overall it really isn't special. Pricing is average."
""
""
"Drinkability is very good. I am not a really big coffee guy, but this beer is really good. It has nice coffee notes without being overpowering. One of the most balanced and drinkable coffee stouts I have ever had and would recommend anyone to try this brew."
""
"O - Great solid effort by Koch. It is very delicious and drinkable and has some well crafted flavors that play well with each other."
""
"Overall: I don't like it very much. Its not bad or off, but not pleasing."
""
"An okay drink. It has a robust coffee profile, but it was not balanced with the rest of the stout. Smelled and looked great though."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is a bit thinner than FBS and WnB, but in all fairness to SA's, this is a Stout, not an Imperial Stout. This is really pretty well done, and I enjoyed it quite a bit."
""
""
""
""
"O - If you don't like coffee, don't bother drinking this one, on the flip side if you like coffee I would recommend this one, I'm debating starting my morning with a cup of this to save time brewing a pot of coffee"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are very good. I wasn’t sure what to expect with this one, but overall it was pretty good."
""
"Overall a tasty beer, but there are better coffee stouts out there."
"Very drinkable. Its a heavy bodied beer, coats the mouth superbly as its very sticky. It's a yummy beer that kept me happy throughout."
"O - Another winner from the winter pack. I am a sucker for a coffee stout, and while this isnt the top, it is still a solid representation for a low price."
"O - This is a nice coffee stout. A good effort from Sam Adams."
""
"Overall - I was certainly impressed by Sam Adams on this one. It's not the best stout you'll ever have, and there are better coffee stouts out there, but this is a solid brew. Love if they would put this in a sixer."
""
"The only thing that I wish were improved was the body. Yes, it's nice and smooth, but it could be thicker."
"Though I'm not a fan of coffee, I do like how it smells, and the coffee element here tastes like how it smells... so I'm good with that. For a stout, this is very light-bodied. Plus, the vast bulk of the flavor is in the aftertaste. Kinda odd, and not very interesting."
"I probably would not have this beer ever again."
"O: One of the best coffee brews I've ever had, and one of Sam's finest offerings. I'm a huge fan. A must try for any coffee brew lover. This would be the perfect pregame/morning beer."
""
"Pours a nice pitch black color, with a nice brown head. Laces well, with good head retention. Aroma is mild coffee grounds, with some toasted malts and hints of dry cocoa powder. The coffee kicks a bit more in the taste, and is accompanied by a nice subtle cocoa note and pleasant toasted malts. It's got a nice full body and creaminess to it, and finishes a little dry. Overall, I think I've enjoyed this the most out of the mixed 12 this year. I'd drink this year round...I'm talking to you Koch."
"Overall: an ok beer, but I was hoping for a bit more here. Still pretty solid."
""
"O: I won't call it mind-blowingly amazing, but I will call it a very good, borderline great session stout that would make a great alternative to Guinness Draught. The only thing holding it back is its slightly suspect mouthfeel...oh who cares, it's still a must try. Are you listening, Boston Beer Company? GIVE US A SIX PACK OF THIS STUFF NOW KTHX."
""
""
"O- I was really looking forward to this when I heard about it... but now I just wish I could forget about it. Maybe I'll use the other bottle when I make my 24hr coffee rubbed pork shoulder. I sure ain't gonna drink it!"
"O-A nice beer, good to see SA make a stout as well. Worth a try, to bad I think it is limited to the Winter Mix."
""
""
"O: A good coffee stout. One that I will definitely revisit because it's an extremely easy drinker and very full of flavor."
"O: OK. Too thin in feel and too one-dimensional in taste. Could use a much bigger malt backbone."
"I am pleasantly surprised by this beer. For me it is possibly in the realm of a session-able stout."
"Overall, the initial flavors present in a single sip of this beer are excellent, the coffee flavors being strongly present, and joined by decent stout flavors soon after. But the beer does fade in its potency fairly quickly on the tongue, and I found myself wanting the espresso profile to last for much longer over the course of a mouthful. As well, many of the stout flavors seem to be light, as if a medium-grade stout had been amped up with heavy aging. The mouthfeel is also strangely watery for the potency of these initial flavors, creating a distracting contrast. Still, the beer does deliver delicious coffee flavors, and is quite drinkable. Worth a try."
""
"Pours a deep dark brown with an active but quick-settling tan head. Aroma of freshly brewed coffee with cream. A bit of vanilla/caramel too. This one is very well-made- really good coffee flavors that are sweet and robust, not too bitter and a really nice mild roasty flavor. Nothing is overpowering or out of line, a simple tasty beer. Moderately heavy mouthfeel for the ABV, nice finish. All-around good stuff."
"Overall a pretty badass Coffee Stout. It is an extremely solid example of the style, that fits very well as a winter seasonal."
""
"O: Just average. I was really hoping this would be better. It has a good base, but there are some off flavors that I didn't care for."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent beer in this variety pack. I wouldn't buy a six pack of it, but two of them are fine."
""
""
""
"My only gripe is mouthfeel. Its actually too carbonated for this type of brew. I bet it would be superb on cask. Very good offering by sam."
""
""
""
""
"IF YOU LIKE COFFEE SEEK THIS OUT."
""
""
""
"O: thinking Sam Adams did what they wanted to do with this one, chocolate and coffee, as for me, yeah, I'd have it again"
""
"It's not a bad beer at all, nice addition to the winter sampler pack."
""
""
""
""
"Feels medium in body with a refreshing almost dark chocolate ice cream kind of flavor and feel. Not a bad coffee beer imho."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I should say that this is the best Sam Adams offering I have had to date. It is a whole lot more on the Porter side than Stout, but a great beer for the newbies that buy the Winter sampler pack. If they like this they may venture out and try other crafted stouts. That is a good thing for all of us."
""
""
"The taste is a little different then the aroma. The carbonation starts the flavors off filling the mouth and subsiding quickly. The initial flavor is sweet malt. It turns to stout with roasted flavors the coffee and roasted malt meld to form a roasted finish almost hints of smoke. This would be a good brew to make burgers will"
"O Not a bad beer here, if you want coffee this is it. A little bit one dimensional but definitely a welcoming addition to the winter mix pack"
"I like this fairly well for a lighter coffee stout. Drink it on the warmer side."
""
""
""
""
"O- I like it. It's two-noted which I appreciate and I really like coffee."
""
""
""
"O: I like this beer; however, it could do with some simple recipe revisions that would make it stellar."
""
"Bottle. Pours a deep black with a dense medium to thick tan head. Loads of roast, deep coffee, very roasty. Soft vanilla sugar note, caramel. Medium bodied, roast, coffee, chocolate flavors. Sour finish with a touch of hop bitterness to balance the experience. Tastes more like an Irish dry stout. The beer is drinkable, but you should drink it slow to savor the flavor profile. Some might say the beer is ""unfocused."" It tasted like a porter at first before morphing into a stout and then a black lager. But I think the progression of flavors in intriguing. Not a single-dimensional brew. But do all the dimensions converge? Not sure it works for everyone."
""
""
""
"Overall - Good, easy to drink, and a must for coffee fans just starting out with stouts. If russian stouts or double americans are too much, this is a good brew to try. Its a little watery but theres enough going on to enjoy, and the lower alcohol makes it easy to enjoy a few at a time."
""
""
""
"Overall: I thought it was nicely balanced all around and a good addition to their yearly winter multi-pack (I hate to break it to ya, Cranberry Lambic, but...)."
""
"Overall - I really do like this beer, actually very good for the price. If you like this beer and want a real treat, get a 4-pak of FBS."
""
""
"A black pour with a 2-finger tan head, leaving a thick ring and dense lacing. Nose is coffee- old and oily coffee at that- pretty one dimensional with some hints of roasted malt and maybe some dark-fruit esters. Palate's mouthfeel is pretty decent- nice weight with a roasty sweetness and moderate bitterness, but has an odd twang and again with the one-dimensional coffee vibe. Overall, I sought out the 2011 Sam Adams Winter Classics pack because I read a thread here saying how good it was. Guess it was the limited availability that people were hyped about cuz the Porter and Winter Lager are the only ones worth a damn."
"O - not a beer I'd buy on it's own but a welcome addition to the seasonal mix pack."
""
"O: Not bad at all though I expected a fresh coffee flavor rather than a cooked grounds character. There is a slight bite on the palate. One bottle is enough and I am ready to move on to something else."
""
""
""
"O: a decent stout, nothing to write home about"
""
""
""
"Overall- I was a little apprehensive about this beer, but I really like it. My wife tried it and loves it and she hates dark beers. I wished Sam Adams sold this in 6-packs."
""
"I may buy again."
"O: Different Strokes for different folks I would say about this one. If you are a hard-core coffee-a-holic and like lots of bitter coffee notes digging into your palate, you may not care for this one. But, if you're like me and like for the coffee to be candy-ized, you'll probably dig it! I think this in one of the best brews that Sam Adams makes."
""
"Because of this mildness, it is inherently easy to drink, but somewhat unsatisfying. There is no outstanding characteristic. I will probably have more of the holiday samplers this season, but I wish the lambic were still there. That and I would buy a twelve of Old Fezziwig."
"Overall I don't go crazy for coffee stouts. If there's a coffee flavor that's usually a good sign, but mixing coffee and stout does not a good beer make. This beer's average, I've had better and I've had worse."
"Overall, a very solid coffee stout that falls in line with expectations. It doesn't have that wow factor, but is still quite pleasant to drink."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty damn good Coffee Stout and a good American Stout. I find that most coffee stouts tend to be bigger and more on the imperial side of the spectrum so I liked the fact that Sam Adams chose to use an American Stout as the base of this beer, there are enough Imperial Coffee Stouts, it nice to have one that is a little lighter with better drinkability. This beer has really good drinkability, some of those coffee stouts are so rich and robust that you really can't have more then one, but with this beer I feel like I could have two or three without being overwhelmed by the flavor. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor and the look, this beer looked damn good and the flavor had just enough roast and coffee flavor to it. The only thing I would change would be to make it just a little thicker, but other then that it is pretty spot on. I will for sure be getting the Holiday pack again, with beers like this, chocolate bock, and holiday porter make this the most solid Holiday pack around, I only wish that they would put this in six packs. I recommend this beer to anyone that is a fan of coffee flavors in their beer, this beer should do the trick. I really like this beer, I like to refer to this beer as Breakfast Stout Light, the flavors are pretty similar ir is just in a lighter and more drinkable beer. This is one solid coffee stout and this beer fits in nicely in their holiday pack, good job Sam Adams, I going to miss this beer when the season is over."
""
""
"O- It's ok, but I expect more out of coffee stouts, especially one made by a brewery I usually like so much."
"O - not a bad addition to the Sam Adams winter pack, but I'm not sure I would buy a sixer of it. The flavor and mouthfeel are a little thin for my taste."
""
""
"Aroma is of coffee, toasted malt, dark fruit and hints of caramel. The body is medium and creamy. Flavors are toasted, roasted malt, coffee and dark fruit. The finish is medium, bittersweet. On a light side, but tasty, easy drinking brew."
""
"Pours black in color with a one finger head that leaves great lacing. Aroma of chocolate malts and coffee. Taste follows the nose but the coffee is off, tastes like cheap coffee, follows with sweet chocolate. Mouth feel is a bit thin but that makes it easier to drink. Not too bad but not fantastic"
"O - If you like Sam's stouts then you will love this. Perfect for after a meal."
""
"Smooth, mellow feel, a bit like a milk stout. Dark chocolate, roast malt aftertaste, light coffee notes. Some tobacco leaf and banana sweetness. Fairly light bodied but smooth and flavorful. Mild coffee bitterness, dry finish. Overall it's pretty good, not especially bold but plenty of coffee and mellow roastiness, perfect for fall weather."
"I wasn't expecting to be impressed, and it may not be outstanding, but this is as good a coffee stout as you might ask for, apart from the very best. If this came in four-packs, I'd buy one."
""
"O - I was quite surprised with this beer from Sam Adams...I feel they did a very nice job making a coffee stout...this is a very welcomed addition to the Winter Collection"
""
"The body is medium with a nice, creamy feel. It's not heavily carbonated but maybe a hint much for a stout."
"A good effort overall, pretty complex for a coffee stout with some unique notes to it and not overrun by the coffee. The texture is its biggest let down, but still quite good."
""
"D- I enjoyed this coffee stout more than most that a try; a nice surprise."
""
""
"Overall: An extremely nice coffee stout, and one that I'd surely have again. Although I think it'd be better named ""Chocolate Coffee Stout"" rather than just ""Coffee Stout."""
"O= definitely a nice contribution by the Sam people. I'm seeing that I'm far up on the ratings compared to most others but I'm not comparing this to other stouts-- it seems in its own and very intentional style of a decent schwarzbier infused with Sumatran coffee. I tend to think it's mis-categorized as an ""American Stout"" and that it might be better described as a Coffee Schwarzbier."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pretty solid black with not much light entering, has a big tan soapy head that laces the glass. The nose is dominated by roasted malts and coffee. The taste follows with coffee and toasted malts, burnt brown sugar, and caramel. Has a pretty smooth and creamy mouthfeel with good carbonation. It's a good beer that I could easily drink more of."
"O: This, along with the Rauchbier from the Harvest Pack, are fantastic beers. SA really hit the mark here. Would like a bit more coffee, but I am a coffee lover so there's never too much coffee in anything. Quite surprised that this is a SA beer; wish it were available in a 6 pack."
""
""
"This is a good, but not great stout. If you like coffee and/or are just getting into stouts, this would be a nice introduction to the style. Sam Adams makes solid beers for the most part, and this one is no different."
""
""
""
"O: This is a really good coffee stout. Not up there with Peche Mortel, but the balance is fantastic and makes for an easy drinking beer. A great addition to the winter mix pack."
"O: A nicely balanced Stout. Very easy drinking with a good amount of coffee flavors including some rich espresso. There's also some subtle chocolate aromas and a good deal of roastiness. Excellent for a lower ABV Stout. I'm very surprised with this Sam Adam's offering."
"This beer pours a black color with brown hues around the edges. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a solid quarter inch cap of light tan foam. The aroma is of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. The taste has more roasted malt and less coffee and chocolate than the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice coffee stout that I would certainly drink again."
"Dark brown and nearly opaque with faint reddish highlights. A short brown cap of fine bubbles appeared during the pour, lingered for quite some time, and left some sticky, streaky lacing on the glass. Roasty aroma, coffee, malted milk, mild molasses, caramel, and chocolate. Moderate bitterness with a little bit of malt sweetness, roast, nutty, coffee grounds, caramel and chocolate notes were very faint compared to the aroma. Slight cherry or currant flavour in the finish. Decent texture, medium bodied with moderate carbonation, mild astringency from the dark grains. Overall, a solid and drinkable coffee stout."
"Overall I would get a sixer of this very tasty. It was one of the main reason for getting the winter 12pk and I'm happy I got to try it."
"O - Hmm, I like it but it's kinda sorta an intro to the Stout style brew to me. I really like the flavor profile but I would have liked more of a roasted character, especially on the finish when it just sorta goes flat and leaves you wanting more. I'd drink it again but I wouldn't buy it again. Definitely worth a try though. Cheers!"
"black colored body, 3 finger mocha head. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, mocha, grape, apple, raisin and cherry. Taste is tart and bright initially then falls into a coffee, chocolate flavor. Slightest bit of bitterness. Kinda twangy.. Body is light-medium surprisingly, it's very session-able. Decent easy-drinking stout, a step up from Guinness."
"I'll pass, overall, but someone who likes the genre better won't mind."
"Overall, a pretty good beer and, again, I like that Sam Adams is moving into other styles to round out its selections. I'd like Black and Brew to be a bit bolder, and the mouthfeel to be livelier. Worthy, and part of a terrific sampler pack."
"I am impressed. Can't wait to try the other seasonal offerings from this pack!"
"O - There's an artificiality in the flavors. It's a coffee stout, and as such hits the mark. Otherwiseit's uneventful. Fun to drink, but a kitsch marketing ploy not fit for competiting with the finest stouts. It's flavorful enough to exceed most beers, but I just can't get into it."
"Overall: Not my favorite coffee beer. Not very complex. The coffee is overpowering and very astringent. The chocolate is very subdued. Tastes like cold diner coffee in a bottle."
"Not something I'd search out, but certainly good enough to drink as part of the Winter Classics 12 pack."
"Very dark brown color with a dense tan head on top. Nice amount of pleasant coffee beans in the aroma and a trailing dark chocolaty sweetness. Roasty, creamy coffee flavor...obviously quite malty with a pinch of fruit in the finish. Straightforward, but satisfying. Creamy, oily medium body. I'm a sucker for coffee stouts and this suits me just fine."
"Pours pitch black with a large, light-tan head that goes down quickly. Scent is light coffee with some chocolate and roasted malt. Taste is a lovely balanced coffee flavor with sweet vanilla and raw sugar. Finishes with sweet, roasted malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is an awesome offering from Sam Adams that I wish was in sixers."
"O: This is a great addition to the Holiday Sampler. Good riddance Cranberry Lambic. Make way for Black & Brew -- terrible name but good beer."
"O: solid offering from sam adams"
"Not bad at all though I expected a fresh coffee flavor rather than a cooked used grounds character. There is a lingering bite that the palate just can't shake. One bottle is enough and I am ready to move on to something else."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Overall not a bad offering, it started off enjoyable and started to fall apart but towards the end of the glass when it got warmer I started to enjoy it more. This is worth checking out. The alcohol is well integrated for nearly 6%."
"I was hoping for a little more pop with this one and it just sort of fell short. When I first heard this was going to be a part of the collection, I was excited to get to try it and I feel a little let down by this... I'm not ripping the beer but I just feel like it could have been a lot better..."
"Overall it's a very nice coffee beer, especially for a mass produced and widely spread beer. It really isn't quite a stout though IMO. It should be called a coffee porter due to how thin it is. But it's a great addition to the best mixed seasonal pack on the market."
"o - pretty damn good, but i'm a sucker for coffee stouts. i really wish sam adams would sell this in 6 packs so i could drink it all the time."
"O: Great drinkable American Stout. My favorite in the winter pack, really happy to see it new this year!"
"This is some good stuff. I am really impressed. Lots of flavor, well blended and highly drinkable. Well done."
"overall, the only drawback i can come up with is the misplaced, slightly cloying sweetness. the java notes are not heavy handed which could be perceived as a plus. i would definitley buy this by the six or twelve pack if it were available. highly recommended."
" Poured this into my duvel tulip, nice head retention and a nice coffee stout smell to it. Taste was nice, not a RIS by any means, just a nice lite coffee stout, the espresso really came through to me. My real only gripe with this one was that it just felt very thin on the pallete, it needed some more body on it. I believe this is the first year for this one, so all in all a nice coffee brew to enjoy after work while the temp is starting to dip a bit!"
"Easily, this is one of the better coffee stouts I have ever had. It's not the easiest style to work with oftentimes. Oftentimes coffee and malt flavors can become disjointed and awkward. This isn't the case with the Black and Brew. The appearance is a nice black with pleasant but fleeting tan head. It smells like coffee, but not just coffee, but with added cream and perhaps a little chocolate too. It's creamy, which is great. It's got a good, sticky mouthfeel that lingers for quite a while (the taste does too). Overall, I'd say this would be the celebrated beer out of the Sam Adams Winter assortment, but that's just me. Cheers."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light-medium bodied with moderate, fine carbonation. Pretty smooth drinking, but would be nice if it had a bit more body. Overall, a nice easy drinking coffee stout. It's no FBS or Central Waters Coffee Stout in terms of quality, but nice. Would love to be able to pick this up year round. Perfect for cold winter nights."
"O: A nice American stout with the added complexity and allure of Sumatra coffee. At 5.8% ABV, Black & Brew is poised as a nice replacement for your after dinner coffee or morning accompaniment for the more brazen. I'd really like to see this stout added to Sam's line-up as a sixer next winter."
"This is an excellent beer. Its like if they added coffee to their already delicious cream stout. Samuel Adams is expert at mixing their malts for a delicious sweet full bodied beer. Their stouts and darker beers are always excellent as well. This one being no exception. This is actually my first coffee beer and while I know theres probably stronger tasting ones out there this one is really a perfect combination of coffee and beer. Not too much coffee where its weird to drink but not too little where you dont taste it. Excellent offering from Samuel Adams."
"Gotta admit, I was pretty excited to try this when I heard of its inclusion in this year's winter variety pack. It pours a brown-tinged obsidian topped by a finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, mild chocolate, and a subtle twinge of coffee. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger coffee contingent, one that comes across nice and smooth, rather than overly bitter or roasted too darkly. Very nice. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a surprisingly very tasty and easy-going coffee stout. 'Nuff said. Get some!"
"This is a real nice effort by Boston Beer. It's a lighter but very drinkable stout with an unusual mix of flavor notes. Not sure if they need to tinker with that Winter Sampler much more."
"Overall I liked it and am glad I have one more but consider me spoiled since I would rather have a Breakfast stout. Nice beer overall."
"Overall: A better-than-average outing by Sam Adams. A great addition to the already great winter mixed pack."
"O: got it in the Sam Adams winter pack. Good buy, great selection in the pack. This is a good stout, but for a coffee infused stout it's just decent."
"This beer is nothing like any beer I have had before, especially at the affordability of a Sam Adams variety pack, which can often be found on sale at a Total Wine or local grocery store. Sam Adams may have taken a while to put out a coffee beer, but it was well worth the wait. I highly recommend trying this beer, especially if you like coffee beers. They did a great job of getting the coffee flavor in the beer, which I have had trouble finding previously (though I think this is two in a row that I have liked)."
"O: I have to say, out of all the Samuel Adam's brew's I've had throughout the years, this is by far one of the best. This takes the exceptional cream stout taste and adds a certain edge to it, thats the only way I can explain it."
"A pretty darn good coffee stout, I usually lean towards stout that lean to the chocolate side of things but this beer is quite well done and I'd have no problem drinking these all winter."
"Talk about being taken by surprise and having a really well made coffee stout by Sam Adams. It's beers like this that rejuvenate my appreciation for the Boston Beer Company and remind me they still brew their beers as a craft. Not all are winners, but when they have the portfolio to brew essentially every style, that's amazing while tasting great too."
"Even though I'd rather drink a different kind of stout, I can appreciate this beer. It certainly won't prevent me from buying another variety pack in my attempt to procure more of the Holiday Porter and Old Fezziwig."
"Mouthfeel smooth and creamy with a medium-body feel. Overall, Black and Brew is an impressive addition to the Sam Adams lineup. Seems to get the coffee vs. stout balance just right."
"I like this coffee stout. Easily one of my favorites from Samuel Adams. I want a 12 pack because I'd replace my morning coffee with this."
"I really enjoy this beer. I am a fan of coffee stouts and while the mouthfeel might be a tad bit thin here, the abv is lower than most other coffee stouts so it's to be expected. I will definitely be drinking a lot of these this winter."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of this years newly-released winter mixed-pack. Pours a virtually opaque black body with nearly an inch of khaki-colored head. Roasty espresso dominates the aroma with hints of dark chocolate. Espresso blasts the palate with dark chocolate, caramel, just the slightest hint of date. Medium to full in body with moderate carbonation. A solid coffee stout. Nothing more, nothing less."
"Wow, not bad at all, Samuel Adams. Definitely a holiday feel to this brew too."
"O - A very nice beer. It becomes more appreciable as it warms and you get near the bottom of the glass. Well done."
"This is a solid, easy drinking, delicious stout. Nicely done SA."
"Very nice robust caramel smell mixed with aromas of coffee and hints of roasted nuts and a touch of chocolate. Overall not bad. First impression was really just the perfect carbonation, great frothy and fluffy mouthfeel and just all around benefit to the palate. Lots of caramel flavors and again a bit of a smoked hint at the bac"
"It has an average head size coming in at about 2 inches and had a 33.5 degree temperature in the bottle. The head is foamy and medium brown and has excellent lacing. The body is even darker than the vanilla stout I had a couple days ago I put it up to the light I couldn't see through it at all. It has a coffee aroma and a coffee taste with hints of caramel and chocolate. It has a moderate flavor and an average finish length that hits the middle of the tongue."
"Coffee flavor is much more intense than the nose. A good, dark roast. A mild astringency comes off as a quenching acidity. The body is very smooth and creamy, but a tad thin. The body and the 5.8% ABV make this a very (in my book, anyway) sessionable beer, something you don't often see in a good coffee stout. A pity there's only two per case."
"Overall: This beer is the entire reason I choce to buy the Holiday pack. I hope they telease it sometime in a six pack. This beer is great. One of the best I have ever had from BBC."
"Smooth, bold and delicious. Nothing complex here, but super nice balance of roasted, sweet, and bitterness levels. Very nice."
"Pours an expected black color with a large pillowy mocha cream head. Aroma of fresh ground coffee beans and a touch of confectioner’s chocolate. In the taste, a well balanced mix of espresso, roasted malts, cocoa and milk chocolate. Even balance with a nice bitterness from hop and coffee. Drying and roasty, with notes of malted milk balls and chocolate covered coffee bean. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite smooth with adequate carbonation. Overall, though a little late to the party, Boston Beer Co. has brewed a fine coffee beer. Very nice."
"O: I bought the 24 pack just to try this beer. I couldnt wait to try it and it didnt disappoint. I just cant get over the smell. Its just so good."
"Pours a dark chocolate brown with a burnt tan head that disappears quickly. Little to no lacing is left on the class. Has a sweet hop-like chocolaty aroma. Mouth feel is smooth. Tastes sweet at the beginning with a sour aftertaste. The coffee is a little hard to detect until the very end. Great tasting beer to try once or twice."
"Poured dark brown with short, deep tan head. Head does not last , very little lacing of the glass. Aroma is chocolaty. Taste is a bit too sweet, the coffee flavour overpowers any other ingredient! Luckily, it's a decent coffee in the beer! A bit sour in the aftertaste. Worth trying once!"
"Coffee beers aren't really my cup of tea, but this one isn't too bad. Wouldn't buy it if it wasn't in the winter variety pack, though."
"O: nice surprise in the winter SA 12 pack... this is a drinkable and well balanced coffee stout...wouldn't mind seeing this packaged by itself as 6 packs or 12 packs."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a large tan head. The aroma is very heavy on the coffee with some chocolate mixed in. The coffee smells like straight black coffee with no sissy sugar or cream added. The flavor is also very heavy on the coffee. There are also some roasted malt and chocolate notes, as well as a little bit of cream. The beer is a little thinner in body than I expected and the carbonation is medium to high. A very nice coffee stout and one that I hope goes into regular production."
"O/D-Overall, one of the best Sam Adams beers I have had. Way better than expected. Really hits the coffee flavor well. This needs to be at very least a seasonal six pack. I really liked it."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip. Pours an amazing beautiful black with a two and a half inch sticky mocha head, lot's of lacing. Very impressed with the retention. Smell is expresso, chocolate, and roasted malt. Taste is all of that with coffee & chocolate to start, with some roasted malts and hints of smoke and vanilla in the finish. Mouthfeel is great, especially considerin the reasonable abv. Heavy for it's size with plenty of carbonation. A great addition to the winter mix pack, might be the stand out now. Nothing I don't want to drink in this 12 any more, nice work ."
"O: Definitely a winner in the line up of Samuel Adams' seasonal 12 pack. I thought that this was a remarkably well blended coffee stout that plain and simple got it right, not frills attached. I would buy a sixer of this were it available"
"This pours a solid flat black, with a generous topping of tan foam. There’s a sharp, delicious aroma of dark chocolates and dark-roasted coffee that comes through. The coffee definitely dominates the flavor. It’s as if I dumped my favorite French roast into a stout recipe. (Stout or porter, I’m not going to enter that debate right now.) This is smartly balanced, with a lingering coffee finish that coats the palate. All around solid brew."
"M/O-has a real nice body, impressive lacing, down side of this beer is your taste buds get fatigue rather quickly. One is good enough for me in one setting. after that I'm looking for somthing else. Somthing new is always nice. I know alot of us buy the mix pack for the old fezzy wig alone. Nothing wrong with that though! Anyways it's a good beer not great."
"Now if I can just keep my wife from finding the other bottle."
"O - Pretty damned good beer, and I must say I am surprised. I think this is a fine coffee stout."
"Nice addition to the winter pack."
"O: A definite winner from BBC. Fits the season perfectly and isn't so extreme that it will push non-craft drinkers away. Haven't particularly enjoyed some of their new ""seasonal"" beers (their saison and kolsch in the summer pack tasted too similar and were just decent overall), but this one is a nice exception"
"2011 Sam Adams holiday samplers offers up this new brew from Jim Koch and company. Appears pitch black no light makes it through when held toward the light. Deep thick mocha tan head forms a dense foam cap with speckled even coated lacing left on the sides of my glass. Aroma is great pure ice brewed coffe roasts, with creamy sweet lactose sugar notes and a caramelized malt presence really makes for a pleasant smell. Creamy dark chocolate/roasted coffee accents works wonderfully together, semi acidic nautre about it from the coffee roasts. Robust coffee flavor in each sip really a well rounded sipping stout, easy to drink but intense with layers of flavor. Caramelized creamy malt sugars and robust Sumatran coffee even has layers of vine ripened fruitiness. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied never thick or hard to bear on the palate, quite the oppposite with velvet texture and smooth carbonation. Overall an excellent source of mainstream coffee beer the way it should be brewed every time, one that highlights the nature of how awesome both coffee and beer can be. Especially as in the symbiotic relationship that Black and Brew provides, just try this one this holiday season."
"A nice stout. Not big but it is flavorful. A good keeper for Sam Adams."
"A new winner from Sam Adams, this was smooth, tasty and very enjoyable. This brew hid the 5.8% ABV very well, and at first it seemed like a gimmick beer until I got the cap off and then inhaled that wonderful coffee aroma. This beer was a very pleasant surprise and a beer I definitely recommend checking out."
"Overall a great beer for a cool day... solid all the way around! I've been increasingly impressed with what BBC is doing with what is pretty much mass-produced beer."
"I was highly impressed by this beer especially after having there Chocolate Bock, which was terrible in my opinion. This beer had a very creamy head along with a very creamy taste. The roasted malt characteristics were on point as well as the smooth finish. It could have had a little more hop taste(coming from someone who isn't high on hops) but overall i still give this beer an 8.5 out of 10"
"O: I REALLY like this new offering. Most coffee stouts I have had are higher ABV beers. This is perfect. Balance is the key. Nothing overpowers and this is highly drinkable. A great alternative to the imperial stouts with coffee. A great beer IMHO. I'll certainly stock up on this if it goes to sixers!"
"Overall - I must say i bought the 12 pack winter variety just to try this beer and i am really glad i did, i was really kind of surprised at the quality of this one. Very coffee forward but does not dismiss the great qualities of a stout, chocolates and roasted malts. Very nice, i am impressed!"
"O-i'm fairly impressed with this stout. Its one of the most full flavored American stouts that i've had. it shows how good and fairly intense flavor can come from a lower ABV. it does seems to lose some of its luster as the drink goes on."
"O: Definitely a nice winter-type drink. There's a lot more coffee character than any stout I've ever had before. It's not really a bad thing at all...it's just...strange. I guess you don't how much it tastes like coffee unless you try it. If you're not a fan of coffee, avoid this one; you won't like it. Otherwise, it's a quality, albeit interesting, stout. Definitely worth picking up, especially since it comes packaged with some other great brews."
"M/O: This beer is a good representation of the style. Not too overpowering and not too sweet."
"Overall I found this one to be very drinkable. Normally beers like this are a bit to bitter for my taste, but this one gives me a bit of sweet combined with a nice coffee flavor, minus the bitterness. Definitely worth checking out."
