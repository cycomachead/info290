"+1 to those who regard this as the essence of the American stout. I'm searching for beers that I call ""elemental"", that represent ideals from which other beers are concocted as mixtures/compounds. This just may be the elemental American stout, and it's available at fantastic price for the brilliance that you're getting here. It's a near-perfect balance of smooth, creamy, and bold. I salute Sierra Nevada for the continuing great quality of the older staple beers, even as the marketing arm seems to be convinced that appealing to hop-heads is the way to go. And I'd suggest that marketing this stout as their #3 grocery store beer, after Pale Ale and [seasonal hop-heavy beer], instead of another hop-heavy variety, would be beneficial to sales in the long run."

"Delicious and smooth. Very easy drinking with some hops flavor noticeable."
"M - Medium-low carbonation.  A little thin in the middle.  Full, but clean finish.  Very drinkable."
"This is certainly one of the finest beers."
""
""
""
""
"Look, this beer is awesome. It is in every way an exemplary stout. It's just solid. No frills. Just an all-around excellent stout. Don't assume you've had this unless you have a very precise recollection of drinking it. You may not have had this. And if this is the case, my advice to you is to not let this beauty pass you by. Nice, mild chocolatey and roasty aromas. I pronounce it good."
""
"Very drinkable. Good finish. One I will surely buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Comes across as pretty basic but solid nonetheless."
"Overall: A nicely balanced stout, without any off flavors or quirks (not terribly distinctive either). Mild and not too bitter hops profile. Drinkable, a bit richer and less bitter than the SN Porter. Note that this one was in the bottle for 5 months, which might explain the milder hops."
""
""
" disappointing stout from Sierra Nevada; I've had plenty of much nicer stouts. It isn't unpleasant, simply underwhelming."
""
"This is a solid stout. The dark malt characters are exceptional - roasty and deep. Evolving complexity. I enjoy the malt so much that I wish the hops weren't as heavy in the flavor. For me, it's too much hop flavor for a stout but that malt flavor keeps me drinking. It's definitely a solid pick - it may he the best year-round, available stout in its pleasingly low price point."
""
"Very well made beer by our Chico friends. Not spectacular when you are used to drink (barrel aged) Imperial stouts but nevertheless a good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Doesn't live up to the Brothers' rating for me.  It's good all-around, but nothing special on the nose and a little too hoppy and bitter at the finish for my taste without the richness before.  It's good but I wouldn't choose it over many in the style if given the choice."
"Very tasty stout. Nice blend of flavor. Smooth. Not heavy. Loved it."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 10/9/2014. Pours clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, herbal, pine, light smoke/char, light dark fruit, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted/bready malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, herbal, pine, light smoke/char, light dark fruit, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, pine, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of roast/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent American stout style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"A great example of the quintessential American stout."

"The epitome of an American Stout."

"Overall a great stoud with the roasted barley, chocolate notes and the hop really stands out but does not go too far for a stout.  I likey."
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into a beer mug. Wonderful colour! It was hard for me to smell. Taste, well tastes like roasted grain, nice amount of bitter. Mouthfeel is hearty. A stout well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is a delicious stout!  Great flavors of roasted malt, subtle coffee and smoke, brown sugar-like sweetness and dark chocolate.  Delicious!"
""
"simple stout...yet perfected! creamy head and mouthful. about once or twice a year I love going back to this classic ""STOUT""."
""
""
"Bitter for a stout in my opinion. I drank from the bottle vs glass so that may have contributed."
""
""
""
""
""
"An underrated beer, in my opinion. While purposefully not as strong in malty sweetness or hops as an imperial stout, the mixture of flavors is rather brilliant. Recommended."
""
"O: Very solid straight forward stout."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great example of what a more subdued porter can be. Not everything has to be high ABV or aged in barrels, simplicity can be effective as well."
""
"An awesome beer that highlights everything right with Sierra Nevada. So much flavor and perfect balance. Hard to believe it's a 5.8% ABV beer. For the money, there is not a better American stout."
""
""
""
"V - Medium value, not too expensive, not too cheap either."
""
"Seems about right for their take on a Stout. Very bitter for a stout. Not for me."
""
""
"Pours dark with a nice creamy medium head.  Smells of burnt coffee with a malt background. Tastes of burnt coffee and chocolate with a mild hoppy aftertaste, has some depth.  Little creamy mouthfeel with some carbonation. with a nice finish.  Overall a very nice stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my first stouts, a little watery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent stout but honestly very disappointed. Pretty flavorless and very light aromas makes this beer a let down. Not the worst but will not buy again."
""
""
"I much prefer the Sierra Nevada Porter.  This one was too hoppy for my tastes.  More like a Porter blended with SNPA."
"Killer. Just wish the ABV was a little higher. A 6.5 would be fantastic, but it's still really good. It's a go-to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From what I could gather, the porter and stout have very similar taste profiles. The stout is smoother and creamier, while the porter is more crisp and a tad bit sour."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good, better than a lot of stouts, not so much a liquid Hershey Bar, still sticks to the Sierra Nevada corporate general flavor, which is very good indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Excellent stout, lives up to my expectations.  A great halfway point between the best of British stouts that generally top out at 5% ABV and the mighty imperial US stouts.  Wish this one was available from supermarkets in the UK like SNPA is."
"Looking back, I had to bump up my ratings on this one a bit. A very solid stout that fires on all cylinders and washes down most meals very well. At the time of my first rating I think I was measuring it against my own system which inappropriately ranked it against imperial stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Did a side by side with the Porter. For $1.25, this is a great brew to drink on those cold nights. For FL that means 70 degrees, but hay, that is cold here!"
""
""
"DATE TASTED: November 16, 2014... GLASSWARE: Samuel Smith pint... OCCASION: return from Ben and Teresa's wedding... APPEARANCE: jet black body; impressively thick, creamy brown head tabletops in the glass's center, while high-arching lace adorns the outer glass; good coverage overall ... AROMA: nicely hopped, slightly lactic; some smoky, murky qualities; some plasticine hints late impede the otherwise welcome scents ... PALATE: reasonably smooth, slightly oily; medium-bodied with a palatable late rush of effervescence on and under the tongue....TASTE: a much hoppier stout than its tradition encourages, with some dry hops lending punch to a rather brackish taste; sweet, roasted like coffee and even at the finish, encouraging another sip ... OVERALL: a flavorful West Coast take on the British style; these guys do not do much wrong, and this is another example why..."

"Chocolatey, roasty, dry and a little creamy. Some black coffee bitterness and acidity. Really robust, yet clean flavor profile. Super drinkable and probably more satisfying than any stout at this ABV level."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste begins with sweeter bready malts, along with a subtle coffee bitterness. Fantastic smooth, nearly creamy mouthfeel. The most interessting part is, that both taste directions, sweet malts and bitter coffee are in perfect balance from the beginning till the end, resulting in a creamy, slightly bitter finish. Gentle, fresh crushed coffee beans lead to pleasantly bitter, toasty aftertaste. This beer wins by its outstanding balance, on the other hand, its not too far away from their porter either."

"This is my third of these tonight, and it has been absolutely great. This beer is a gem. If you are looking for a beer that is easy on the alcohol but doesn't compromise on flavor this beer is a great fit. The value is unbeatable as well."

""

""
""
""
"O: 4.32 - Overall a very nice stout! For personal preference, I could use a little less of the hop presence, but it's still a great old school stout."
""
""
""
""
"Price point - $1.89/12 oz single"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: solid beer. Distributed everywhere and taste excellent. I don't know what American stout would beat this."
"O. One of the best stouts I’ve ever had. I didn’t believe the hype at first but yes it is that good. Get some NOW. Taste like a RIS little brother. Light buzz for 5.8%. If you want to drink a beer that taste of an imperial stout but you don’t want to get drunk. This is for you."
""
""
""

"Americans often over-rate their own beer, this is not a case of that. Best I've had so far from Sierra Nevada. Perfectly balanced stout, however not overly ambitious which is the only drawback. Definitely a stellar beer."

"10/30/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Quite smooth & sort of creamy. Very little bitterness. Worth a try but no asterisks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very light stout."
"An interesting and enjoyable combination of the hop character of an American IPA with the fullness and roastiness of a stout. I personally find it very satisfying, as all the best qualities of both styles are balanced and play out their roles admirably."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Considering the bottled on date, this has stood up very well.  There is a great balance between roasted flavor, cocoa, hops, and malt.  The flavor profile hits all these notes and has a nice dry finish with little lingering flavor.  A solid stout."
"O: The slight bitterness that this one had balances out the sweetness. It was very easy to drink and very nice overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It was nice to see this beer relatively fresh. It's a very solid stout."
""
""
""
"O:  Excellent.  4.5/5"
""
"Pleasantly hefty body. Roasted coffee and light chocolate with a bitter and slightly dry finish."
""
""
""
"This is what a stout should be.  Deep black color with a thick, rich long lasting tan head.  Both the smell and taste are a nice combination of coffee and chocolate with the hop bitterness working with the sweetness to provide great balance.  Rich mouthfeel - almost creamy.  This is my benchmark for what an American Stout should be."

"That being said, nothing about this beer is exceptional; it is simply a solid stout for the money."
""
""
"Pours a very deep dark brown in color and is close to being pitch black. Looks great! Has a nice 1+-finger beige thick head. A good amount of lacing is seen with each sip that sticks to the inside of the glass also. Perfect carbonation for a stout. The aroma is of roasted malts for the most part but nothing else. The taste of the roasted malts comes through at first then followed up by a very bitter aftertaste, almost like drinking a strong I.P.A. (India Pale Ale). After a few more sips it didn't get any better. Way to bitter and after a good hour I ended up pouring about half of it out. One of the worst stouts I had drank. To me, the best part of this one was the pour and look in the glass."

""

""
"Pours a clear black. Exceptional head, lacing and retention. Light nose of chocolate, roast and caramel. Almost full bodied, yet creamy. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is very well balanced, but not as complex as the world class stouts. It's a nice blend of chocolate, roast and slightly sweet caramel that flows into a low level bitterness. The finish is smooth leaving you with a nice lingering tingle of cocoa and hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall,  every time I have more of this the more I like it.  In my opinion, this is a solid option for an American Stout and we'll worth it's price."

"o; As fine a budget stout as likely can be found! Good representation of the style. Mild enough to be a good dinner brew and tasty enough to be a pretty good sipper."
""
""
"Overall this is another strong offering from Sierra Nevada and a must try for any stout lover. Here is Chicago, 6ers of these fly off the shelves fast so I'm always happy to pick this up, when I can find it."

"Sierra Nevada doesn't make a bad beer, and it's nice to see this isn't hopped up into a black IPA or some such. a true American malt-bomb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great example of the style. This one is no frills and straight to the point. That point is an awesome roasty characteristic with enough hoppiness to keep things interesting."

"Ranked Obsidian the highest, with Barney Flats second, and SN Stout slightly behind in third."
""
"Final thoughts? Basically, I need to try this one a bit fresher. This is still a very tasty stout, but the flavors on it seem quite subdued -- almost as if this is watered down/a porter. I will definitely need to revisit this when it's either on-tap or in a fresher, not-so-dusty bottle. At this moment, it's just a very solid stout, but not a great one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice stout that is quite flavorful."

"Very dark black beer, with finger of tan head and good lacing that held up throughout. Lots of chocolate in the aroma with a bit of hops. Flavor is typical stout, chocolate, coffee, toffee, etc. Medium body for a stout. Not spectacular, but a solid drinkable stout."
""
""
""
""
"My fifth offering from Sierra Nevada, have to admit I was a little underwhelmed. Light body for a stout, easy burnt raisin flavor, not to heavy on the malt. Super smooth, glides down the back of the throat. Very dark brown flavor. It's good, but really just a pretty prototypical stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a good traditional, no frills stout. Its smooth and very approachable. Although I prefer robust stouts with more malt and dark fruit character, if I were to recommend a stout to someone new to the style, it'd be this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A really drinkable stout and a really fantastic example of the style. If you are unfamiliar with stouts this one would be a great introduction. Also, don't let the 50 IBUs scare you as it really does not taste nearly that bitter to me, and I am not one that usually takes to more bitter beers. Do yourself a favor and give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice stout, impressed with the smoothness of it. Its a stout that I could have a few of without feeling full, but not too thin as to loose some of the creamy texture. Wish it was available at more pubs down under."
""
""
""
""
"One of the earliest craft stouts to be brewed, and a terrific one at that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: tons of flavor for a 6% stout. A classic. As with all Sierra Nevada beers, well crafted. Always a safe choice."
"There is a kind if milk chocolate flavor that is nice and relaxing and easy to drink with a slight bitterness lingering on at the end. Minimalist hops."

"O - American Stout or American Black Ale, it doesn't matter - this is terrific. I had this one once before about 6 years ago in my beer rookie-dom. It's much better than I recall. Happy for the re-taste from one of my favorite brewers."
"Very good American stout by SN. recommended to anyone looking for a good shelf stout, especially at its price point. This is where I'd go if I have a craving for an American-style stout as Deschutes doesn't distribute in Wisconsin (Obsidian Stout)."

"Overall - You would be hard pressed to find smoother, balanced and flavorful American stout. At just under 6% its not a big monster, so you can enjoy a few bottles. World class, and really underated, in part to being very available, and low alcohol I feel many would look past this beauty. If you ahvent had yet, you need to try."

"Overall - an excellent, complex stout at a great price point!"

"O - A style-defining beer, Sierra Nevada's Stout is a classic in every sense of the word. From the bold roasted profile to the smooth chocolate notes, this beer is wonderfully balanced from front to back and, despite it's intimidating nature, is quite easy to drink!"

"This is a well-balanced, great tasting stout. It's got a great mix of chocolate, toffee, smoke, and malt flavors. The malts are perfect and there's a slight lingering hint of hop bitterness. Great body, slightly chewy, a little dry, and mild on carbonation. Overall a solid beer; tough to beat."

"Overall - While I prefer a creamy rich RIS, this stout easily holds it's own with a very nice mouthfeel and bold, complex flavors for a 5.8 ABV stout. Great flavor, nice transition, and very sessionable. A great stout if you want to throw a few back with friends, I recommend this one."

"Overall this is a really good-tasting beer, and the fact that it's not a huge hulking stout of a stout is actually a good thing, because this is a yummy stout that I could sit and have several of. It's not as flavorful or bitter as Old Rasputin, not as big and sweet as Sam Adams Imperial Stout, but I'd rather have three or four of these than even two of those at a sitting. To compare it to something of comparable ABV, it's better than Guinness."

"A good stout/porter for its ABV. Easy drinking and a good introduction beer. It's pretty well done."

"Sierra Nevada Stout - finally getting around to reviewing this classic! It's appearance is archetypal, with a dark shade of brown not unlike oil. Light barely passes through the glass, and over top is a 1/2 inch layer of puffy, tan froth. The aromas coming from the beer are great as well - milk chocolate, sweet bread, and molasses. One sip and the drinker will be in love - the velvety smooth liquid coats the palate nicely and tastes milky, toasty, nutty and decadent for such a low ABV beverage. The brewer's best achievement here is the balance of all the aforementioned elements, though. It finishes with a slightly bitter end, which leaves one to only want more. Buy with confidence - this is no 'run of the mill' stout."

"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass, with a fine light brown head with great retention and lacing. Promising aroma of dark, toasted malt, coffee and chocolate. Flavor of toasted, lightly charred malt, light coffee, chocolate and hints of nuts, finishes moderately bitter with charred coffee notes. Medium bodied with hints of creaminess. A well balanced light stout that hits all the flavor notes I want from a stout. Perhaps a bit thinner on flavor than I expected, perhaps because I've been drinking a lot of imperial stouts. A well made traditional stout as expected from Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: While the flavor is QUITE nice, if I were judging purely on accuracy of style, I would have to deduct a few points in even this area. The lighter, sweeter, taste reminds me of a porter as opposed to a stout. Still, the overall deliciousness makes up for what the drink lacks in aroma...and in the case of at least this bottle, that is saying a lot! I will happily continue my search for a fine-smelling bottle...and even if that effort turns out to be in vain, I will continue to drink this beer. Yes indeed, I will."

"Poured this American Stout from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured an opaque black color, produced a thick tan color, great retention and it left a outstanding amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of roasted malt, dark fruit, and earthy hops. Full bodied, this stout has a foundation of roasted barley, chocolate and caramel. Bitter hops, finishes dry. One of the best stouts I have sampled to date."
"A nicely done stout filled with dark, rich flavors throughout. Complexity: check. Balance: check. More dry than sweet, but should readily appeal to any stout lover."

""
""
""

"Charred malts lead the way in a rather one dimensional taste, albeit a very good taste. Very malty, but slightly coffeed , the char reigns throughout. There is a certain ease and smoothness that makes this stout remarkable."

"O - Highly drinkable, sessionable stout, but not one of my favorites. I might give this one another shot sometime."

"O - overall a nice hoppy stout, almost too much so. Style wise I feel this is more akin to a black ipa. I can only fault it for its name, it is delicous."

"O- This is an amazing stout and probably one of the best I have ever had so far. I love the hop presence in this beer which most stouts do not have. Only complaint was that I didn't have another one of these to drink after I finished it. Cheers!"
"notes: like SN Porter this is a hoppier for the style interpretation which is powerful, complex and tasty. want more soon."

"Sometimes simplicity looks so much better on a label than some sad excuse for a pun or some ridiculously long-winded and adjective-laden description. Sometimes. This stuff pours a dark sienna-brown topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, baking cocoa, light coffee, and a smattering of dark greens. The taste focuses on the roast and a milder version of the greens, with a dash of coffee in there for the sheer fun of it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, though a touch on the thin side, this is a pretty nice stout, one that keeps things as simple as the label presentation."
"O:Solid, not amazing."
""

"Medium - full body and light carbonation. Reasonably smooth with just a bit of hop sharpness to cut the malt and prevent it from being cloying. An extremely good brew."

"Overall: a well-constructed stout, I just wish the incredible nose was followed by similarly incredibly flavours in the mouth. The cost of AU$90 a case makes other, equally good stouts a better option. Not a bad stout at all, just suffers a bit when it comes to the actual flavours. Not bad, just not interesting enough to cover the high price."

"This beer pours up a deep black with a big fluffy two finger caramel-colored head, decent retention, and outstanding lacing. The smell is molasses, toffee, and malt. The taste follows the nose very sweet on the front end with a molasses like sweetness followed by a dry not very bitter finish. Mouthfeel is very pleasing without excessive carbonation. As with just about all other offerings from Sierra Nevada, this one is very solid. There may be better beers in every category, but as a whole is there really a better brewer?"

"I like this, though it’s not as complex as the other stouts I’ve had lately. After a few sips I paired it with Paula Deen’s Not Yo Moma’s Banana Pudding and the combination was excellent. A solid if not polite stout – at one point it reminded me of a porter. A good gateway to the style. Tasty and would buy again."

"NOTE: Live review."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. There was nice and robust smokiness to add to the already rich and deep chocolatey malts. A hop bitterness also permeated each level, adding complexity, balance, and blend. The feel was nicely drying, leaving a pleasant smack and froth to the lip. If anything, the nose was comparably light, but the rest made up for it in this tasty brew."

"either way if you want a standard stout that has more hops than most this is the beer for you, however, Id prefer to just get something from Laginitas or Anchor and have a better stout."

""

""

""
""

"Overall a very enjoyable beer. Wasn't the best stout i have had but it certainly was worth drinking. I have enjoyed pretty much everything sierra nevada puts out. Some day i will have to make the two hour journey north to visit their brewery. If you see this beer in your local store give it a try i think you will be surprised like i was. Cheers."

"O. Overall this is a good example that a beer doesnt have to be 10% + ABV to be good. A simple beer that hits all the right notes can be pretty damn good, and this is a pretty damn good stout."
""
""
"Overall, a really impressive stout. Tons of flavor but not overly heavy and sweet and almost sessionable. Something I should really pick up more often."
""
""
""
"O - Meh. Decent but reminds me more of a moderate porter with some zest and char. Not as good as the Founder Breakfast Stout or Porter. I like my stouts to have a thicker mouthfeel and a bigger and richer malt bill."
""
"This is one of my favorite stouts to date, and I will no doubt be coming back to revisit it."
""
""
"When poured gently this full bodied stout has a half of a finger tawny head resting upon a pure black delicious mass. The smell of this beer is very enticing, malty and coffee. The taste of this beer follows the nose, very rich and satisfying. Unlike other some stouts there is little dark chocolate flavor . This is not to say that the beer is lacking in flavor because it is not at all. The mouth is nice this beer goes down easily."
""
""
""
""
""
"Oft said on this site: ""chewy mouthfeel"" that hangs around for a beautiful hoppy stout aftertaste."
""
"Pours pitch black with a brown head that disappears rather quickly. Slight lacing. Smell is typical stout. Taste is pretty good . I get the chocolate, coffee and dark malts. I'd say nothing remarkable but still a good beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and lasting? The backend dissipates pretty quickly making you want another sip. The taste varies as the beer warms. It's not an Oskar Blue Ten Fidy, but I will buy it again and keep it in my refrigerator."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste was surprising, different than what I expected, but excellent."
""
"O: I would say this is a solid American Stout that I would have again."
""
""
""
"A solidly constructed and robust stout, hits everything by the book and keeps things bitter through and through with a roast malt-forward profile. Very much worth trying out at least once in a lifetime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a superb stout! Pours a blackish color, oddly bubbly around the glass, long-lasting head. Noticeable sediment at the bottom of the glass. Roasted malts are on the nose and the taste, but the hop bitterness does come through to balance the flavor in the usually Sierra Nevada way. Very smooth, very tasty. Well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this was a delicious stout, with a wonderful flavor. I'm convinced that Sierra Nevada may be the best of the best when it come's to well know breweries whom of which produce easy to find beers."

"O- Stouts don't get a whole lot better than this. For me, it could use a tiny bit less bitterness and carbonation. But really I'm just splitting hairs here, this is one fantastic beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and some coffee bean aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, and cocoa nibs. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Drink- A nice small stout, I only got one but this seems like it wouldnt age well. Slightly better above cellar temp as more and more flavor profiles developed. I'd have again."
""
""
""
"A true stout and highly drinkable as well."
""
"O- A perfect stout. It doesn't get much better then this for plain old stouts. Cant believe it took me almost 250 beer reviews wot get here."

""
"The more I try I of sierra nevada the more I am impressed. This beer doesn't break the trend."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a solid, all-around stout from Sierra Nevada that brings a tasty flavor and would be very easy to consume in numbers. If you're looking for a stout with solid amount of both hops and roasty character, look no further as this offering certainly does the job well."

""
""
""
""
"O- I'm not a big Sierra Nevada fan but I got this one in a make your own 6 pack and was pleasantly surprised. It is on the cusp of being too thin and too bitter but it never quite falls over the cliff. I would pick it again in a pick a 6 type situation"
""
""
""
""

"Sierra Nevada Stout is short on flavor but quite harsh. All in all, I found it really difficult to put down. This beer might have been considered respectable back in the day, but times have changed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Powerful! I love this beer; a step up from Sierra Nevada’s Porter, in flavor and body. Of all the stouts I’ve ever had, this one tastes the most…pure. Hard to explain, but it satisfies in an unexpected way: it’s refreshing."
""
""
""
"Overall - A little disappointing. I was hoping for more roasted malt, but the hops battle it out for supremacy rather than taking a backseat like your typical stout. Comes across as a brown/porter hybrid moreso than a stout. Still, the incredible mouthfeel makes up for what it lacks in ideal flavor, and comes out somewhere around great. Drinking at a warmer temp allows the malt character to blossom; too cold, and the hops dominate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty enjoyable and easy to drink, though not exactly a sessionable beer. I like the dark roasted malt flavors and smells are very enjoyable. I would enjoy getting this one another time."
""
"originally reviewed: 11-03-2010"
""
"A very worthy stout, up there with Guinness and Murphy's."
""
"I personally like my stouts less hoppy and smoother but still an interesting take on the style."
""
""
"An enjoyable, fairly classic example of an American stout."
"Pours black with a thumbs width mocha head and decent lacing. Maybe this is an old bottle but aroma and flavor was largely lacking; some roasted barley, cocoa, and maybe a touch of smoke. A crisp, not quite medium bodied to this. Overall, an alright beer. Enjoyable enough to drink but nothing that has me needing to go out of my way to drink it again."
""
""
""
"Overall: Sierra Nevada pulls it off again. A great standard for a style. Drinkable and then some. I'd love to see a coffee-infused version."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you're used to RIS or stouts in general, this one will probably disappoint. On its own merits...meh. Its alright. Its drinkable, nothing imposing, but still comes off as a hybrid of stout and cheap beer. And if thats your kind of beer, power to you. Me, I was really hoping for something richer or at the very least, having a sturdier mouthfeel. Not recommended."
"D/O: This is a lighter stout that looks and feels great, but could use a shot of assertiveness when it comes to the sensory qualities of smell and, to a lesser extent, flavor. As with most of Sierra Nevada's darker offerings, the hops are more attention-getting than one might anticipate. On the other hand, the roasted qualities, which ought to be defining, are mellow and supportive instead. While Deschutes Obsidian Stout is a more balanced all-purpose example of the style, this is still not without its charms."
""
"Overall a really tasty, easy-drinking, low-ABV stout w/ lots going on. Perhaps the best-value stout I've had."
""
"Hard to rank among others of the same style. A simple American Stout with loads of flavor, a bright nose, some intermediate complexity, and sessionability at the strength. Sierra Nevada is all about characterizing their beers on hops, even the malty styles. I'm glad I didn't pass this one up. 4.0"
""
""
""
"From the ubiquitous 12 oz bottle. Another well-made beer from people who know what they're doing."
""
""
""
""
"O- I've had the porter before which I feel is just OK, so I assumed the stout would be the same. I was sorely mistaken. One of the most enjoyable SN beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
"O: a really session-able beer and overall appearance is amazing! taste impeccable, seemingly can hardly be faulted. i want more!"
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours black with a two-finger length tan head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving lacing on the side of the glass. There are strong aromas of dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, and coffee. I can detect some faint hop aroma as well. The taste is of dark roasted barley malt, bitter chocolate, and coffee. It tastes like it smells, but the flavors are full and bold. There is some bitterness in the flavor as well and the hops provide some of that bitterness as well as extra flavor to go with the traditional stout flavors. This is a medium bodied beer with some carbonation. The mouthfeel is creamy and the beer coats the mouth very well. Overall, this is a most excellent stout and one I'd recommend."
""
"Pours a very ominous black, hardly an edge of clarity. Healthy finger of mocha colored head that dissipates to a fine ring, good lacing. Resinous hops cut through the roasted dark malts on the nose, an uncanny balance, like a black IPA. The taste is nice and smokey, like a breath of fresh air after a few blunders recently in the stout category. There's all the appropriate stout characteristics, dialed back to achieve a smooth and approachable balance. Not sure why I've overlooked this one until now. Quite good. All 4's."
""
"Pours black in color with a small tan head that quickly dissipated and leaves good lacing on the glass. Not much carbonation. Aroma is roasted malts, and dark chocolate. Tasted of roasted chocolate malts and coffee with some bitterness. Full mouthfeel, was medium bodied. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - not a bad stout if you like them bitter. i'd like to try this on tap sometime, but we really don't get anything aside from pale ale on tap in nj."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a very good stout, definitely worth the price. Not as much flavor as some of the top notch stouts that I've had, but at less then $12 for a 6-pack, it is very hard to beat. Definitely recommended if you like sweet stouts."
""
""
"Overall – A good affordable session drinking stout. It has a nice taste, a creamy body, and is not overpowering, making it quite easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great offering from Sierra Nevada that really reminds me of their Porter, naturally. Perhaps a bit more full-bodied and bold than the Porter, a great brew for anyone who enjoys roasty. malt forward beers."
""
""
"O: Hopped up without sacrificing balance. Pretty damn delicious."
""
""
""
"O) A good example of classic stout"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - While it won't blow any doors off in terms of complexity, this is a quality, versatile stout that would serve as a very nice transitional beer for newcomers to the category and a nice pint anytime for the rest of us. Like a number of their beers, there isn't one thing that stands out, but the elements all come together so well. You can taste the brewing experience in it. This has become my go-to stout to keep around for when I get the stout jones but don't want to break into my stash of stuff for critical reviewing."
"as good a stout as you can buy in a sixpack as far as im concernced. pours a rich thick dark chocolate color with a fluffly lasting mocha head. smells deeply roasty with a touch of caramel sweetness. flavor is well balanced. a little hoppy bite at the end, but all smoothed out by the dark malts. i dont pick up much coffee or chocolate flavor in this one, just a very organic feeling beer. its smooth like a good oatmeal stout, and has a bit of the flaked oat flavor in there. feel is wonderful, carbonated just enough, with a drinkably full body. i enjoyed the whole 6er and would reach for another if there were any more in the fridge. this is a fantastic stout all around, went really with a big mushroom pasta dish as well. yummmm"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very well-balanced, complex, and flavorful beer that's oh so easy to drink. Nothing really makes me think ""Wow!"" but it does everything very well. I simply prefer more robust and full-bodied stouts to ones that are the more drinkable type. Still, this is a solid and very enjoyable offering from Sierra Nevada. I didn't expect anything less."
""
""

"O: Overall was a good stout with a little more hop bitterness than i anticipated."

"Delicious with some subtle sweet hints, but it still has that full-bodied coffee-and-dark-chocolate taste that makes the stout one of my personal favourites. If you're a fan of the style, this is a must try. I'm surprised I can't find it as easily as Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale or IPA, because if I could, I know I would pick this one up more often, definitely."

"Bottle from Wing Central in the U district. Poured into pint glass. Appearance was that of any other stout, dark/opaque/murky. Small tan head that leaves quickly. Aroma was a lot of coffee, roasted and burnt malts. Taste was a lot of roast flavors and coffee, very slight chocolate if any at all. Palate was powerful, makes its way through the entire mouth. Overall it was decent. Probably a bit inflated rating after drinking IPA’s all day (not a fan of IPA). Very mild for a stout, but not exactly my favorite. There are better stouts out there."
""
""
""
"O: Warm, inviting. A great sipping stout. What a nice surprise. This is one of the better stouts I've tried. Sierra Nevada keeps ringing the bell. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't know that I liked this beer as much as others on this site, but it was fairly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O - I think this beer is well executed with some complexity and robust flavors, it's just not my preference."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a beautiful dark mahogany color with a tan frothy head. Smells like a hop field, and some dark charred malts and more bold citric hops. Ahh, what a lovely smell...the taste, is like a choir of angels beating your ass with vines of Humulus Lupus and then giving you a scalp message in a Swiss chocolate factory. This beer has a nice big grapefuit twang and finished off with rich toasted marshmallow s'mores. If you wanted to dig deeper, you'd discover some bright coffee flavors and complex tobacco leaf. Despite all of these symphonic flavors and aromas this beer is highly drinkable. The only other Stout that comapares to this one is Storm King and pound for pound I'd rather be drinking this one right now. This is one of the best American Stouts you could get your cold dead hands on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not sure what took me so long to try this beer. Sierra Nevada knows how to make a complete stout. This will be one of my ""go to"" stouts when I'm looking for something easy drinking under 6% ABV. Well done Sierra Nevada, well done..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Not a bad stout. Something simple and easy for the everyday stout drinker. I wouldn't put this on any search out list, but I would keep it around home for when non-craft beer fans come by and want something darker."
"O: This beer looks phenomenal. I felt the nose and flavor were dominated by the hops. I prefer the Dogfish Head Chicory Stout, but this is still a really good stout."
"O: Overall, a pretty-damn good beer. Though it lacks the viscosity and pungency of other beers of this style, it's very approachable, affordable, and easy to drink. It definitley doesn't lack in the flavor category either. Glad I picked this one and I would definitely have it again."
""
""
"Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this is a very drinkable stout. The lighter body could cause some to perceive this beer to be ""watery"" but it really allows the flavors to come out without ever becoming thick or sticky. The carbonation is a bit prickly but does not seem to interfere with the flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A fine stout from Sierra Nevada, not overly complex, but really pleasant and approachable. Nice roasty flavors make this a worthy brew."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really great take on a smaller stout. Great blend of dark malts and hops. One of the better bargains out there."
""
"Man I wish this thing tasted like it smelled! A little too balanced for me between the hops and roasted malt flavor which I think ultimately dilutes the potential robustness of the drink. Definitely worth having another though."

"Sierra Nevada Stout: Continuing my tour of the stout world, last night I tried a Sierra Nevada Stout. The Sierra Nevada comes with the standard black body and brown head. The head was ample and lasted until near the end, with a sheet of lacing on one side of the glass. The aroma was mild compared to other stouts, but foretold of what was to come. This stout has a bid flavor, mostly malt and molasses. There is a bit of bitter toward the end, but not overly so. Some stouts have a harsh finish, and that is not the case for the Sierra Nevada. I do not think I could drink two of these, but for one stout this is a robust, flavorful and manageable choice."

"O: I don't quite see the hype here. While it's decent, to be sure, I like my stouts a little less hoppy than this. On the positive side, it's suited pretty well to both winter and summer drinking duty. If you don't like your stouts hoppy, look elsewhere. Otherwise, give it a shot."
"O) This is a very good stout. I enjoyed the hop presence. I've been drinking a lot of Founders Breakfast Stout lately, and it is my favorite, but this was a nice change up. I would highly recommend this brew."

"O - This was an excellent excellent beer. I have been wanting to try it since I got into stouts (and beer) a few months ago (based on BA reviews). A lot of times I've been disappointed with highly rated beers, but not this time!"
""
""
""
""
"A good stout, I don't mind big hops in a stout but I think it brought down the overall flavor and drinkability here."

"damn that's a good stout... it's creamy as hell, smooth. great blend of chocolate, vanilla and coffee flavors. the alcohol provides a nice warmth. That's all I can really say, it's simple but perfect."

"Overall - Pretty great overall beer. I've had it several times in the past but only yesterday did I sit down and really pay attention to the details. A top notch representation of an American Stout."
""
"O: not a big fan. I've really liked most of Sierra Nevada's stuff, but I have to say this didn't hit home for me. I liked innovated brewing, but I felt this beer was too hoppy and not nearly as smooth and thick as it should be."

"Overall, a solid year-round beer from SN. Good stout."
"Overall, this was a solid brew. I can't say that I'd pick it up a lot, however that's only due to the fact that imperial stouts are more my thing. This is a very solid regular porter, and it gives some of the Imperial stouts a run for their money, but it's a tad light to really knock my socks off. Definitely a nice session stout though."

"Picked up a 6-er for $6.99. Tough to beat that."
"medium body. soft carbonation. perhaps a slight creaminess. though no real apparent alcohol."
"O - Not a bad stout. Sierra nevada very rarely makes a bad beer and this one holds up to that."
"An excellent beer that I'd highly recommend."
"O- Just another really, really good beer from the SN main line. Like Pale Ale, Torpedo, Kellerweis and Porter..."
"Quality stout right here."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. After the pour, it's tar black with a hint of brown hue in the light. The head starts out frothy, cream colored and bubbly. The head dissipates to a thin film on top, with more bubbles around the glass. Nice thick sticky lacing. This stout smells good! Dark rich bitter chocolate and burnt malt aroma. The taste is very solid. Bitter chocolate stands out with burnt malts (like the smell), with a dry hopped bitter finish. Mouthfeel is good as it's not watery nor too thick. Overall, this is a solid stout all the way around. Not an every week stout for me because I have other favourites, but this represents the American Stout category well, and I'll revisit this one eventually, which is saying a lot with all the options out there."
"Stout pours black, with the perfect sized tan head. The smell is rich, very malty, a bit of chocolate can be detected. The taste has a great malty earty backbone, with a strong choclate coffee flavors belnding in. Everything blends the perfect amount, and leaves a very bold flavor. The flavor is very strong, and leaves a nice bitterness on the palete, you would proabily not watn to swtich to other beers after this, no watery taste like some other stouts, and no one flavor is sharp on the tounge. Overall this is a fantastic beer, one of the best American stouts out there."
"I got a six pack of this due to having almost every sierra nevada except the stout. From the first smell I knew this was going to be one of the best stouts I have ever had. It had a mix of both chocolate and hops balanced perfectly with a dry biscuity finish. I couldn't stop drinking them, it was that good! Truly one of sierra nevada's best"
"will be drinking this in the future !"
"A persistent dark tan head sits atop the pitch black liquid, leaving a lot of lacing behind as it disappears. Strong scents of coffee, molasses and a bit of dark fruity esters make for a pleasant smell. Roasty malts and coffee dominate the taste, but a touch of earthy hops bitterness in the finish creates a very nice balance. A solid stout all around."
"A great example of the American Stout style, in my opinion."
"Overall- A good tasting, enjoyable stout."
"O- One of the best stouts around."
"O- This is a great beer and one of the most drinkable stouts I have had in a while. It is really well balanced and subtle in both taste and smell, while still being full-flavored and easy to drink."
"Overall: Very flavorful and satisfying stout. I'm glad I picked this up!"
"Dr: Easy to drink but fairly low quality. A poorly executed stout with no clear appreciation for the style. Above average ABV, both in style and beer, and lacking in quality. I'll never have this again - except maybe on draught."
"O - overall, a really great classic example of the style. It seems like a lot of stouts nowadays have some type of gimmick to them. I love those and they are not bad at all but it is nice to just have a straight up example of the style."
"I'm really glad I decided to go with this stout. One of the best tasting, feeling and smelling stouts around. The balance of the robust roasted flavors blend beautifully with the bitterness -- it really makes this a treat for a cool night."
"O: This is a great easy-drinking stout, especially for the fall season and with the weather the way it is right now (cold and rainy). Doesn't pack too much of a punch, especially for a solid American stout, so it's not too hard to session"
"This pour a very dark brown almost black (light does get through) with a nice mocha colored head with decent retention and leaves a nice lacing. The smells are of darker malts, not as roasted malt smell as some other stouts though. The feel is medium, a little thin compared to other stouts. The taste is pretty good though and the highlight, plenty of dark malts a little chocolate and a nice hop type bitterness at the end. Overall another pretty good SN product, I remember after drinking Guiness for so long the revelation I had the first time I tried one of these. While I prefer a RIS over this, I do love this beer as a nice session type stout."
"O: Really enjoyed the hop profile, and it took the beer a couple minutes to warm up to that point where I could really smell and taste the hops. Really good, enjoyable beer."
"O- One of the better American stouts I have had. Very flavorful for a non-imperial stout and an impressive effort."
"o- good stout easy to drink not very heavy you can drink a few and not be full, glad to have tried this one"
"A very good dry stout, well ahead of jokes, especially the Draught, from Guinness brewery."
"O: Likely my favorite SN offering. I'll try again and if still impressed...could become a regular."
"D-Insanely drinkable, and a slightly different spin on the style which I thoroughly enjoy."
"Pours black with brown highlights and a mocha head that sticks around for a bit. Smell is inviting, roasted malt dominates with chocolate and smoky notes. The taste starts with a nice roasted malt, not as sweet as the smell would suggest, the smoky notes come through and it finishes with a bitter malt flavor. The aftertaste has the chocolate and almost coffee notes. The mouthfeel is medium/heavy with bigger carbonation, and nice flavors. The bitter finish calms as you drink, but initially takes away from the mouthfeel, but the flavors are still delicious to make this beer enjoyable. Overall a well done stout with many great flavors."
"Overall: A delicious stout that has exceptional feel. This beer delivers with lots of flavor and keeps me reaching for another. A truly great beer from Sierra Nevada."
"For its quality, style, and general availability, one could barely ask for more. The answer to all that ails the American, nay, global, perception of good, standard beer. One caveat though - one must like robust stouts..."
"O: Great Beer"
"D: No miss-steps here. Sierra Nevada's Stout is a half point from being perfect in every category."
"Overall: this is a very decent stout. It's probably not my favorite, but it is certainly going to become a go-to stout because of its tastiness and availability."
"Good dark chocolate brown colored body with a smooth creamy texture. Nice bouquet. Not overly sweet. Doesn't have a heavy taste, but has a bold nutty chocolaty taste. Nice feel. No bitter after taste. Nice creamy two finger head. Too bad it doesn't make a Black and Tan."
"Overall I think this stout is better than most of the off the shelf stouts that we consumers have to choose from. Problem is this isn't off the shelf for most of the country. Well your problem not mine. A go to if you can."
"O: a phenomenal representation of the style and it is easy to see why this brew is in the top 100 beers of fame here, excellent"
"Morey's Bottom Line: While this is definitely good, it's a little thin for my liking. I've really grown to love some of the thicker full bodied stouts like Founders Imperial, Ten Fidy, Old Raspy, and even Fritz and Ken's."
"Overall: A very good stout. I am more familiar with Sierra Nevada's hoppier offerings, but this was a nice change of pace. Would buy this again."
"O- This is a great stout, creamy, full of flavor, very drinkable, and a very affordable beer. That is a quadruple threat for me. Good job Sierra Nevada! The roastiness and spice is what I will most remember about this beer, lots of it."
"Creamy head and taste. Drier than I expected yet not too hoppy; which makes me happy! The color is the dark murky chocolate you expect from a good stout, but lacks the ""fall effect"" one sees in Guinness for example. Overall a nice drinkable and easy on the palate brew!"
"Enjoy!"
"Reviewed on: 07-26-2011 01:49:05"
"Overall - A superb ""standard"" stout. Almost on par with the Russian Imperials"
"well, as everything SN it is a very well made and drinkable beer. maybe not as robust as some of the local offerings but makes a good comparison and can easily be used as (another) style benchmark."
"Chocolate taste. Caramel comes in to give the dark, sharp cocoa a break and provides sweetness. Seems complex, but really it's just a straight up stout. Take their porter and put more choc. malt and hops in it. That's what it seems like to me. I""m having it in mid-summer. Gonna have it again later in the year. Not the best, but good and damn solid"
"M - This full bodied stout from Sierra Nevada is really a world class brew. I found it to be one of the best stouts I've ever had. Very tasty and fulfilling in all test areas. It's great for the Fall and Winter seasons and is a great beer experience for those who love stouts all the time and even the drinker who just wants a change. Top tier brew from a top tier brewer. Exceptional"
"Overall: Good cheap stout that I could drink everyday"
"Overall this is a nice drinkable example of an American stout. Quite enjoyable."
"Overall. Just a fantastic stout. Could drink a bunch of these ...and the next time I cross the border into the USA, you bet your ass I will!!!"
"O: For the price and availability this is a decent beer, but fails to meet some of my expectations for a stout. For the price and light consistency I'd sooner go for a black ale like 1554 (which I love)."
"O: Very good sessionable stout. For an affordable stout, this is hard to beat."
"O: So as I figured, Sierra Nevada didn't disappoint. A great stout. My favorite is still Obsidian, but this is right up there."
"A very good beer from a great brewery. Sierrra Nevada can do more than hops!!!"
"O - Sierra Nevada Stout is another outstanding offering from this brewery. Overall rating approaches 4.5. Particularly recommended to those seeking a significant, but not intrusive, hop component in their stouts."
"D/O: What's not to love about this beer? I could, and gladly would, drink this all night long. Highly drinkable, and overall very enjoyable. 5.0."
"Overall, this is a good stout. Complexity of flavor and balance meet with good mouthfeel to form a good offering from Sierra Nevada."
"The beer is black with a thick soapy light brown head that clung to the glass. It smells of roasted dark chocolate and molasses. It tastes of bitter coffee and unsweetened dark chocolate with a slight piney bitterness. It's medium bodied and very smooth it also has a great dry/ bitter finish. This stout can hang with the best, I would drink this over most others of the style."
"O: great beer, its sweet and malty with a nice hop presence, perfectly balanced. One of my favorite stouts and I love that it is a year round brew"
"Overall-I've had maybe more Sierra Nevada beers then any other craft brewery, but have never had their Stout. This beer is balanced, refreshing, and extremely drinkable. It's not one dimentional and won't get boring. I could drink a 6 pack by the pool in 100 degree heat, very nice."
"What canI add to the brothers? A very palitable stout. Truly a sessionable brew. I buy this at EVERY oppertunity! I love the mouth feel as well as the taste. The only ""bad"" part of the whole thing is that I tend to drink a 6er at a time! Prosit!!"
"I've had beer as a hobby for only a year, but I have had a decent number of stouts and porters from around the world, and I feel like I'd be hard pressed to find a stout with the tastiness and balance this brew provides."
"Uber-smooth, so drinkable...SN has produced yet another winner here. An affordable, every-day stout to enjoy year-round...a nice, sessionable, easy-drinking stout for those looking for a break from ultra-boozy Imperial Stouts."
"O - Very good stout, I buy this beer every winter, great on a cold night."
"Simply a solid stout. Its a great introduction to stouts. I enjoy it and like to suggest it to people who have never tried stouts before. The best part about it is how widely available it is. Its nice to be able to get a good quality beer like this in almost any grocery store."
"Probably one of the best all around stouts that I've ever had. Readily available at any major grocery store I would highly recommend picking this up and trying it."
"O: This is a decent stout. 4"
"This stout pours out almost solid black with just a hint of light that shines through. The head is pretty decent with a light lacing. The smell of the beer has a good roasted malt aroma going on with some light hops in the back end. The taste of the beer is pretty good also, it's well roasted and has just a touch of burnt toast flavors in it. The mouthfeel is medium and leaves a dry aftertaste in your mouth. Overall it's a good stout, not really my favorite but I'd totally drink it if it were available."
"sierra neveda does it again with this bad boy. they are definitely one of my top 5 favorite breweries. they dont know how to make a bad beer"
"It’s not as explorative or adventurous as a lot of other stouts, but if you’re looking for something more traditional, this should do the trick."
"This beer is excellently balanced and manages to be simultaneously complex and simple. American stouts that are not extreme in any way almost seem hard to find these days. For the record, this works well in a batch of chili."
"This beer was quite a surprise. From the nose I was expecting a very weak stout but it was anything but and has lots to offer. Real interesting beer."
"Really this is quite a very good beer, exceptionally well made and to be honest, one I haven't had for years until I bought a six pack recently after noticing it on the classic beer list here on BA. I'd honestly forgotten how good and satisfying this beer could be. What I particularly like about it is that as far as the experience of drinking it goes, it sort of straddles the line between a dry stout and a cream stout. Nice roasty dryness up front with some clean, bitter, roasty notes, but without the coffee or chocolate notes you often can get with a stout. The backend is very creamy while the tight bitterness still echoes in the background. Dry throughout, but just a haunting hint of sweetness on the finish. Wonderfully satisfying- I'm going to make it a point to addd this back into the rotation."
"O: I was overly impressed with stout – everything from appearance to smell to taste was dead on. Remarkable balance between the malt and the hops."
"Overall – Great quaffable stout. For the price, it can’t be beat."
"Overall this is a great value. At $7.50 per sixer, I 'll drink this again, but I think i'll wait til winter."
"An absolutely delicious American stout. So much flavor, so easy to drink, and low enough in ABV to enjoy more than a few over the course of a night. Phenomenal!"
"Wow, really have to give it up for this one. A beer so flavorful that drinks so easily. That's a winning combo in my book. This is a really great beer and needs to be tried if you haven't already."
"Pours black, with some ruby highlights. The aroma is a bit muted, with mostly coffee and roasted malts coming through, but not very strongly. The taste, however, is very nice, it's a perfectly balanced stout. The coffee and roasted malts are nicely bittered by some nice, very earthy hops. A very dry stout. The finish has a nice touch of smoothness along with a bit of chocolate. The mouthfeel is nice, it's a ride in itself, going from prickly carbonation, to smoothness, to a dry finish. The drinkability is exceptional. Overall, this is just a really good drinking stout available for great prices."
"Medium to full in body, the roast / bitterness in the back just isn't there, I'm worried that this isn't teh stout at all but some black pale ale. Mildly sweet up front the body carries this mild sweetness throughout and then it ends....I'm bored, moving on. Again I'd have this again if I were in a really shitty bar."
"O: This is a really tasty beer. I'm sure I'll have it again at some point in the future."
"Pours like you hope a stout would- dark with a half inch of mocha foam. The head dissipates too quickly and the nose is malty without sweetness and contains faint hops. The taste has lots of roasted malts and finishes dry thanks to a subtle hoppiness that makes this easy to drink. The mouth feel is a fuller body, but not quite the creaminess of a Guinness. A good take on the style with definite character from Sierra Nevada."
"Overall, this is a very good, standard, American stout. Certainly above average, but doesn't stand out much."
"Overall, this is a great stout. At its price, and at only 5.8%, this is easily a repeat brew."
"Worth a go - but you knew that anyway!"
"Notes - For a bitter stout, this is great. Very drinkable and sessionable. Will buy again next time I want to have a ""stout-night"""
"O: Good brew. Well done for the style. Not among my favorites for the style, but good."
"Overall, for $8 a six-pack, this is a great choice, and is easily found in most liquor stores and supermarkets near me. Highly recommended."
"The taste is solid. The roastiness comes across as a drying element, but is fairly clean and doesn't harm the drinkability. It finished wi a bitter chocolate that's fairly pleasing. This beer is just solid, but I can't help but think it's unspectacular. I'd take a sixer of this for 4.50 any day... but I wouldn't go out of my way to make sure I stock it."
"T: This isn't one of those in your face stouts, but it's well done. Lots of roasted malts upfront to the point they almost taste burnt and then some bitter hop flavors towards the finish. Slight hint of coffee grounds as well. Mouthfeel was a bit too light for me but this is insanely drinkable."
"A medium to high body. Some roast from beginning until the end and there is the bitter explosion for a long final nice combination"
"great drinkability, something you can have a bunch of. overall, this is more or less the perfect example of the style. all i could ask for would maybe be a touch more roast."
"M - Only slightly viscous, but very drinkable because of that. Drying, slightly astringent mouthfeel from the black malt/roast barley addition, but that just makes me want to take another sip! ...and another... and another..."
"O: I'm really not sure what to make of this stout. It doesn't fit what I expect from an American stout. I certainly like it, though: the earthy and bitter hops complement nicely, it's incredibly drinkable, and it works much better with food than most other stouts. Maybe I'll think of it as a dark, chocolatey American brown ale."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly full for how fluidly the beer poured. It's not viscous, but it definitely isn't watery either. Carbonation is high and I'd prefer it a bit lower, but it isn't ridiculous or anything. Drinkability is aided by the smooth and easy flowing nature of the beer, but hurt a bit by the buttery aftertaste. I like the taste, just not as one that lingers for a while, leaving itself as a souvenir of the beer. It doesn't measure up to the coffee and chocolate, so I'd rather have those to keep tasting before the next sip. This is a really good stout though, and may be on my shortlist of sixers to buy regularly."
"O- A solid stout. In terms of chocolate character and mouthfeel, it bears a resemblence to a number of your better milk/sweet stouts. A definite recommend."
"O - Solid example of the Style, I'd expect nothing less from SN. I don wish they'd get rid of that obtuse Bottling Code, though."
"O..A very good stout. Easy to drink, nice unique taste (as always from SN) and a beer I would always go back for."
"Taste is delicious -- a well-balanced mix of burnt chocolate malts and a little hops at the finish. Eminently drinkable and session-worthy, this is a definitive representation of a well-done stout."
"In the end, beer doesn't get much more enjoyable than this. Is someone were to ask me which stout they should try first, I would recommend this one without hesitation."
"This is a very balanced stout and dry enough to be sessionable."
"This beer is a headscratcher for me. Sierra Nevada is world class, and I love a lot of what they do. It's rated higher than I'd expect from tasting it, but more importantly it tastes worse than I'd expect from who made it. There's a slim possibility I'll pick up another bottle sometime to rereview on the strength of their other beers, but as is I was very unimpressed."
"RJT"
"overall a good beer, and for $8 a six pack a good go to. A good representation of an american stout."
"O: This is a textbook American stout."
"What a beer! Excellent stuff per usual from Sierra Nevada."
"The mouthfeel is slightly more carbonated than I expected with a mouth coating creaminess. It's not a super heavy stout by any means, which definitely makes it drinkable."
"Drinkability - Not one of my favorite stouts, but for you bitter hop lovers out there that drink the occasional stout, this one is perfect for you."
"pours a black hue with a creamy, thick tan head that manages to last throughout the drink. chocolate syrupy, bitter-sweet roasted malts and vanilla come on a par with a considerable level of Cascade-like hop fragrance. decent level of balance in the glass. a refreshing but also lubricating mouthful of bitter roast malts with a sound touch of sourness is soon overtaken by the fragrant hop+malt swallow, leaving an aromatic finish hinting at cocoa powder, toasted walnuts+almonds, and date-cake laced with raisins. Complex finish, with nutty and root-herbal undertones lingering with a good level of sour fruitiness and chewy bitterness"
"Highly drinkable beer, low abv and medium body make for easy drinking. Tasty."
"a Dark but not jet black like some other stouts of note. Head was quite bubbly. Actually this beer was quite carbonated for a stout. Smelled of roast nuts and maybe a hint of dark chocolate. Taste matched the smell to a T. I liked this allot. I like the fact that they didnt care to think of a name so they named it stout. oh well lots of potential to add a great name to this so it gets more recognition maybe. I liked it will be getting more of it."
"Given the high overall review, I'll assume that I got a bad bottle. I'll have to try again at a later date."
"D- Very drinkable and full flavored. IMO Sierra Nevada has a stranglehold on well priced, easily accessible, highly flavorful brews. Cheers!"
"the CPJ"
"Get some."
"I think people should be careful reviewing this as a stout and not an imperial stout. For its style it is very easy drinking, mellow, smooth, and creamy. Its nice and dark black. The head is a bit thin and fizzy and quickly recedes. Sea foam lacing. The smell is of chocolate and roasted malts. The taste follows with the chocolate, roasted malts, a hint of coffee and a dash of earthy notes. Nicely balanced, medium bodied beer with a nice rounded carbonation, slight creaminess and a lingering of roasted taste. An overall, nicely balanced, easy drinking beer."
"D: Far and away the worst Sierra Nevada I've encountered. Decent, but not recommended. Looking at other reviews, I wonder if I just tried a dud bottle. I'll give it a go some other time and see if my opinion has changed."
"I love the taste of this beer. The roasted flavor is upfront. It is a fresh tasting roasted barley. The carbonation is upfront only on the tongue. It leaves behind a dry roasted flavor on the tongue"
"D- I could sit with a couple of these. Very easy drinking stout with interesting flavors and aromas. I'm verry happy about this one. I love Stouts. I love Sierra Nevada."
"It is drinkable, however I expect a lot larger and more prominent palate out of my Stouts. Just too uncomplicated."
"Overall- A nice serviceable stout, no complaints. Strictly to style probably a solid A beer, but to personal tastes, I just can't score it that high."
"Overall: It's not my favorite style, but this is damn good."
"I find no faults with this beer. Another stellar selection from Sierra Nevada. With the reasonably low alcohol, you can easily drink nothing but this all night long."
"D- Very drinkable for a stout. Bought it as a single, but will definitely be keeping this one in the rotation. This is the perfect ""sitting in front of the fire"" beer."
"Drinkability: Simply drinkable, like others I've tried from Sierra Nevada."
"Drinkability: Easily drinkable -- nice set of scents and flavors with nothing overwhelming to the palate and the body isn't so thick that it's like chewing used motor oil or anything, so it certainly doesn't sit heavy at all; lastly, the ABV is under 6%, so it's more than manageable."
"Picked up a single at Trader Joe's for under $2. Poured into a stemmed glass. Dark brown color with blood red highlights. Great head forms atop the body. Smell was like a fresh cup of coffee. Flavor was very potent, like a double shot of espresso. Very luscious mouthfeel on this beer also. The one negative I have against the beer is the bitterness that comes from the roasted malt. I found it a bit harsh on the palate, where it hurt the beer's overall drinkability. A nice stout though, and priced quite well at your local TJ's."
" Prost - Matt"
"Drinkability is superior mainly due to its lower ABV. The flavor is such that I kept reaching for my glass and to my surprise I finished the bottle in due haste- glad I have more of this in stock!"
"Alcohol is not noticeable and the taste of it invites me to keep drinking more, extremely drinkable, solid overall."
"D - Fairly drinkable, but with this strong a flavor and this much dryness, it lacks a bit."
"A very drinkable Stout, very simple , but complex. Great job, and I definitely will buy it again."
"Aroma of dark roasted malt. Dark brown/black color with ruby hilites when viewed before halogen. Vigorous tan head that quickly vanished. Body is a bit thin. The roasted malt is dark enough, but it has a hint of sour aspect. Creamy it is. The finish is a little of some very dark roasted malt. Quite dry. Arguably a standard for the style, but it lacks bling."
"Black colored beer with a slowly fading creamy head.Aroma is is mainly chocolate malts.Tatse is cocoa,sweet cream and toasted malts.A decent beer with decent flavor.Unfortunately nothing separates this stout from other stouts on the market.I would recommend to try at least once.I most likely would buy again."
"drinkability - while not a mind blowing stout it has great flavor is reasonably priced and is easy drinking at only 5.8%"
"D-Well balanced makes for an easy drinking stout."
"Poured into a etched imperial pint glass. Not quite black, showed some mahogany edges, head is pillowy and lasts forever. Smells more of hops and burnt sugars than anything else. Got some dark fruits in the scent as well. Flavor is really deep and layered of burnt sugars and roasted malt, burned malt even. Could be described as robust. Definitely bitter chocolate/coffee comes in late. Smooth mouthfeel and is really drinkable. Bravo Sierra Nevada."
"Drinkability: Outstanding. I have a new favorite stout in Sierra Nevada Stout. Super smooth without being too thick, and a complex taste. Everything is superbly balanced in this brew. A little bit of chocolate but not too much and not too sweet. The hops and roasted malt balance each other out perfectly. I picked up a sixer figuring this would be a quality stout, and I was impressed. This will be in my year-round rotation from now on."
"Has a nice taste and a light mouthfeel and great aftertaste that leaves you wanting to drink more. This is a great beer, highly recommend."
"D - Very nice introduction to an American take on Stout, definitely would work on its own or as a session beer."
"Poured into a pint. Black with mahogany highlights if you can find them. Thick coffee cream head with decent retention and good lace. Aroma is roastiness and chocolate overlaid with clean hop brightness. Taste follows, a nice blend of roasted and hop characters. Medium body with creamy carbonation."
"D: Overall Sierra Nevada's stout stands as a well crafted example of its style. Roasty, sweet, smooth, but at the same time not overpowering on the palate, I could easily drink multiples without batting an eyelash. Definitely a recommended beer for either a gateway stout or just an all around well rounded (and affordable) staple."
"Probably partial, being a Sierra Nevada fan (IPA)"
"D: Very drinkable and nice and toasty on a cold night."
"Drinkability: Simple, but there is great balance, and the flavors flow smoothly together."
"Yes, this is real good. The bitter/acrid bent puts you at full attention. Reminds me much of a strong, dark, bitter roast coffee. Very American in its stoutiness. Very SN. Very drinkable."
"The feel is sharp initially from the carbonation, it lingers like a phantom through the finish. It is dry from beginning to end. The body is a rung above medium, but not overly syrupy or viscous."
"Can't believe I've been passing on this one all these years. Note to self everything sierra Nevada does is world class."
"Outside of the completely nondescript aroma, this is a very solid stout and one that I would buy again."
"D: I don't go out of my way for stouts, but this one I would have no problem buying again. Good beer."
"D- one and done for me. There are too many other brews out there of this style and not to waste more time on this one."
"Drinkability: An excellent beer. But the flavors and alcohol level are too strong for me to drink a bunch of these."
"D-Very drinkable and overall a very good brew. An accessible stout for all people."
"I drank a 6 pack of these without even realizing it. Almsot too drinkable if there is such a thing."
"Really nicely balanced - truly a great beer."
"Very drinkable stout, will buy again if other substitutes aren't available."
"Drinkability - even with the bold flavors and strong body I could sit around and drink this stout all night. Would complement a grilled sandwich and then provide the perfect topping for a scoop of vanilla ice cream."
"The mouthful is very thick, but not the thickest I've had. This is one of the most drinkable stouts that I've had to date, and it's extremely deserving of a spot in my regular stock. I'd have no problem drinking these one after another on a nightly basis."
"D - This tastes good, looks amazing but nothing really sticks out. It's a good Stout to have once, and is great for it's style, but I probably wont get it again."
"12oz bottle. Pours a basically black color with a big, frothy brown head. Decent lacing. Aromas of roasted malts and light coffee. Taste has a dark chocolate character to it along with roasted malts. Some coffee flavor. Another great beer by Sierra Nevada."
"Mouthfeel is good but not exceptional. I find the carbonation to be a little too fizzy and that co2 acidity takes away from the flavors of the brew. It does have a decent chewiness that I like but not enough to save it from the slip its had. S.N. Stout starts out rocking the house and then quickly slips into mediocrity. Worth a try but there are better ones out there."
"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Darkest of browns with a khaki colored head. Nice lace work going down the glass. Smell is nice and roasty. In the taste, roasted black malt, hint of piney hops. Some nice char flavors going around. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequate carbonation. A solid, spot on for style effort from Sierra Nevada. Impressive."
"D-develops a creamy tanginess that i find undesirable. alcohol, of course, doesn't come in to play which is nice for a stout, but still...i couldn't drink a lot of this."
"I hadn't had this one in ages, but it remains complex and full in flavor. Lower-ABV (by American standards) and smooth, balanced flavor allow for a stout which can be enjoyed in quantity."
"It's a good stout that I'd be proud to have made, but it doesn't knock my socks off. In competition against similarly priced sixers of this style, it's not my first choice. But I'm sure I'll have it again."
"This beer pours out a dark brown with a thick off white head that lingers, looking like a layer of clouds on top of the beer. The smell is of roast barley and a light hoppiness. The taste is sweet on the front of the taste with a slight bitterness at the end due to the combination of the roast barley and hops. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy, very tasty. This is a very drinkable stout, definitely a session beer."
"D: one of the more drinkable stouts that isn't too heavy or to filling. This could be a good cool weather session stout"
"Drinkability: Very nice subtle amount of presumably strong flavors mixed with hints of unexpected pleasantries, may make it a staple amongst the american stout style."
"Pretty good Stout, definitely liked this better than their Porter."
"Not bad by any means but as far as Sierra Nevada is concerned, I'll take the a few of their offerings before this."
"Overall this beer is amazing. Kind of a curve ball for me since the hops were out front and the roasted was in the back but A+. The beer is smooth and tasty; great body as well as a finish worthy of angels. GREAT BEER SIERRA NEVADA BREWING!!!"
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with a thick, tan head. The aroma is bready and toasted malt. Full, smooth body. The flavor is coffee, toasted malt with notes of dark fruit, faint of chocolate and citrus. Finish is long and bitter. It is good, drinkable stout."
"Overall, I give it a ""C:"" there is a ""Chance"" I'll buy this again."
"Drinkablity: Easy to drink. Heavy enough to feel like you are drinking something with substance but light enough to have a few in a row."
"Light tan, 1"" head; thick, medium density. Roasted malt well balanced with a big hoppy biterrness to aroma, would have expected that for Sierra. Sort of a bright aroma for a stout. Medium thickness to mouthfeel with a mild to moderate carbonation. Coffee and roasted malt seem to be the biggest player in flavor again well accompanied with a big hop flavor. Nice dry hop finish, almost has a slight fruitness to finish. Expected and enjoyed the bigger hoppy presence in the beer. Not over done though, well balanced."
"I was a bit afraid this stout would be overwhelmed by the judicious use of hops. But Sierra Nevada has pulled it off beautifully. This is a wonderfully balanced brew. The hop presence adds a lot to this beer, and takes nothing away from it. Think it'll be making a regular appearance in my fridge."
"Bought in 2010 in a case from Shangy's in Emmaus, PA."
"(D)- The ridiculous burnt flavor really puts me off and causes me to not even want to finish this. I am surprised by this one coming from Sierra Nevada."
"Mouthfeel is thinnish for a stout, but not too thin, not sticky...relatively light overall, but pleasant. Very drinkable stout. I like this -- I wish I hadn't taken so long to finally try it."
"Pours an opaque black body with ~1 inch head and some lacing on glass. Head dwindles to light dusting of froth on the body. Smells of smokey molasses, some hoppy notes similar to SN's pale ale with faint whiff of alcolol. Tastes of smokey dark chocolate with hints of coffee. I really like how SN kept their hoppy presence in this beer. Feels smooth, but with nice bubbly carbonation on the tongue. Overall, an EXCELLENT stout with more of a hoppy kick than most."
"After reading about this brew, I decided to try it out. I love stouts and just bitter food/drinks in general (especially DARK chocolate!). This is right up my alley, and it is an exceptional stout that is easy to find. I love this stuff."
"Sierra Nevada Stout is an excellent everyday Stout. Its uber-drinkable, well balanced and pretty affordable. Between this and Obsidian, you can enjoy great Stouts all Winter long without breaking the bank."
"Drinkability is fairly good. The taste balance is a little skewed to the bitter chocolate side, with malts taking a backseat, but that's not a gamebreaker. Could easily have put away a few more. Another solid brew from Sierra Nevada."
"Notes: I used to live off of this beer when I was in college. Literally. I would drink one almost every day for lunch with a reuben sandwich. I ate the same exact meal for about four months straight before I decided to switch it up. Why mess with a good thing? This is a very enjoyable and easy to drink stout. It packs a bit of a hop punch, but that should be expected from Sierra Nevada. Big taste for a low price. In that regard, it's hard to beat. This is a regular in my fridge."
"D: With a reasonable ABV and flavor that is full and delicious while being far from overpowering, this is a very drinkable beer. Ultimately it could be much better with a slightly higher gravity and more viscosity."
"I've learnt in the past couple of weeks that this bottle is a ""grey market"" import to Australia. Worrying as this could be, I think the folks at SN needn't be overly concerned in this case because this beer I'm drinking is damned delicious. I can only imagine how good this would be fresh and, God willing, I'll be re-reviewing this in California some day."
"Good generic tasting stout accompanied by a bold cocoa/sugar flavor. This beer is backed by strong hop character and pours nice with a thick dark head. I personally think the malt character is perfect but could see another tasters dissatisfaction with the roasted malt backbone. Also prefer it served at a lower temperature (approximately 44F) than other stout beers, perhaps because of the low-moderate alcohol content."
"M/D: Medium bodied, but seemed a little thin and very easy to drink. Overall a great example of the style. Glad it is readily available."
"Overall, a decent enough brew, just not quite up to SN's usual high standards. An OK beer, worth trying, but not special."
"This one is a very good plain stout, something that could be a staple of a beer fridge. Alcohol is hidden and the finish is so smooth. I like this one. A lot. Surprised it took me this long to try it."
"Forget the Pale Ale, give me a Sierra Nevada Stout! Poured the medium bodied stout from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip. Very dark brown in color with a tan head. Tastes of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, and the malts and hops give a slight bitterness. Possibly the D-trains favorite Sierra Nevada brew!"
"Poured deep black in color with thick off-white head that reduced to a thick cap. Lots of wet lacings on the glass. Roasted malt aroma with a hints of sweet malt and coffee. Medium bodied with light carbonation and smooth, velvety feel. Rich roasted malt flavor in the beginning that leads to a burst of coffee flavors in the middle and mild bitter hop finish. A light bitter pine aftertaste that slowly fades. I thoroughly enjoyed this stout. Sierra Nevada nefer disappoints. Very drinkable."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Wow, I am really impressed with Sierra Nevada in regards to this beer. I thought they were a one horse show with their hops, but this beer shows that they can do malty too. I'm going to be sure and pick this one up again."
"Overall this is a good stout, defiantly not the best stout i have had but its still a good beer. I would drink this again but i wouldn't seek it out."
"Poured into my snifter glass that accented the head slightly...a beautiful dark beer with a nice 2 finger creamy head that went away after a few minutes. The smell is of chocolate and coffee, and the taste follows the same lines, with sort of a roasted malt flavor in the back of the mouth. Mouthfeel was medium with a good drinkability...one was enough, another one sure would be nice."
"Overall this is one of the quintessential American stouts, it is a very well crafted beer that I drink often. This beer (as most of Sierra Nevada's) is balanced towards being dry."
"Drinkability - Pretty good American Stout. I like the bit of warmth it provides. This beer is well above average. It would be nice during the cold winter months of course. I wouldn't have a bit of trouble trying this one again. Sierra Nevada just knows how to brew a solid product."
"Drinkability: As far as I know, this is the original American Stout. While better have been made in the subsequent years, this is still damn good. Great roasted flavor and very drinkable."
"D - I would say that the drinkability of this beer is good. It goes down smooth, and after each sip I find myself wanting to take another. This stout is a little on the light side for me, but I still very much enjoyed it. I would definitely have this one again. Cheers."
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, roast malt and a light presence of coffee. In the taste, sweet, roasty malt and a hint of coffee dryness. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry roasty coffee aftertaste. A basic, standard, good stout."
"This stout looks like it'll have a permanent home in my fridge."
"Another great offering from Sierra Nevada - wish it were an imperial, but as the song goes, you can't always get what you want. A sure winner here..."
"Definitely a great stout unique in its own way. THe color is black.Low carbonation and head.The taste is hoppy pine, chocolate,slightly burnt malt,but is still easy to drink.It has great flavor combination going on. I could drink this anytime of the year or day. haha. Try it!"
"Nothing amazing, but a good stout worthy of checking out."
"medium-bodied, creamy mouthfeel, carbonation on the low side. a touch watery, but nothing egregious. pretty drinkable, i would welcome another."
"Overall - Another tasty beer from Sierra Nevada, I've been wanting to try this one for a while but it seems somewhat limited in availability around here. Overall, it makes for a great session stout that's worth picking up if you see it."
"Nearly opaque mahogany with a tan head that stays around forever. Wonderful toasty, smoky aroma with earthy hop undertones. A very hoppy stout, the leafy green bitterness hits early, but the midsection of this beer is very roasty. Never sticky or sweet, the malt has a great roasted, fireside flavor while keeping the mouthfeel lean and drinkable. The finish is dominated by hops-- long, bitter and clean. One of the all time greats, a stout that sets the bar for flavor, drinkability, and price."
"D - Fairly easy to drink and very enjoyable. Would definitely recommend it."
"There's not much I can say about this beer other than it's average. Nothing really stood out for me while drinking it. It poured a nice color and had a nice foamy head, the retention was also very high when I swirled it around in my glass to bring out more flavor but the thing is, to me, there is not a lot of flavor. I had higher hopes for this beer but it fell a little short. It wasn't that complex. I also did taste some hops which is not common for stouts so that kind of turned me off a little. Stouts are my favorite kind of beer and I would recommend this one for a beginner just getting into stouts since most stouts can be overpowering with their taste and character but not for a regular stout drinker like myself."
"Pours near black with a good tan head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings some really nice chocolate notes with a bit of roast and slight coffee. The taste is really nice and great for an American Stout not of the imperial variety. Great chocolate, coffee, and roast. Great feel with a very nice body and carbonation levels. Drinks quite well; I wish I had a non-stop supply of this throughout the colder months."
"Very high drinkability, this is an outstanding American Stout; go by a six pack if you are a fan of stouts and especially American Stouts as this is the top of the class."
"Overall, this is one of the best stout's that I've had. Highly reccomended!"
"Beautiful dark dark brown with ruby highlights around the edge. Nice big beautiful creamy head. I love the look of this beer. The aroma was fairly weak to me. Faint dark chocolate and some coffee beans. No booziness or funk, so that's good. The flavor is a very nice blend of dark and amber flavors. Dark chocolate comes through very strong. Not picking up much of that coffee from the smell, but there's a fair amount of caramel malt and toastiness, giving a nice and fairly unique sweet stout taste. Nice and thick, it goes down nicely. A great stout for the price, I recommend it highly"
"D- as sessionable as a stout gets. nice tasty, not over filling, and drinks down quick and easy."
"Tastes full like a savory meal - a bready fullness - then the bitter hops pop in the back of your mouth followed by caramel sweetness towards the front. The sweetness doesn't come through - it mainly tames the bitterness for a delightful mouthfeel and excellent taste. Ends with a nice chocolate coating a little on the bitter side = very nice."
"D - perfection in this category. An ABV % that makes it (almost) sessionable, smooth enough to enjoy all day but with enough robust flavors and body to remind you that you're drinking a real beer. Fantastic brew!"
"This is Stout. Easily the best Stout beer I've had, and easily ranks among my favorite beers of all time. An offering that I'm proud to call American."
"T- Still very hoppy. Some roast anf vinous dark fruits come to try to help, but nothing can be done to over throw the hops."
"Just carbonated enough in the mouth, just enough body, damn well made stout. Most stouts are either imperial sippers or they lack the sipper qualities needed to enjoy and savor a stout. Unless you find stouts refreshing summer beers...well this is just ideal."
"d- really great, a great underrated sierra nevada brew, i would drink this again for sure, thought it would be priced higher than the pale ale, but no - a value at that."
"Notes: A really enjoyable stout. Pretty typical stout flavors that are executed very well and balanced well. The body is very good as well with great creaminess. A very well executed stout, not a world class one, but a very good one. Excellent value for the price, definitely recommend it."
"D- Decent. Not what I expected from thesame company that brought the best damn American Porter. Still, it is a sessionable beer in the dead of winter. Perhaps food pairing would benefit this beer..."
"Been awhile since I had this one. But It's as good as I remembered. Poured into new DFH glass. Black with a frothy tan head, some lasted the whole way through. Rich roasted malt/chocolate aroma. Tasted as it smelled, but with a nice balance of hops.This is a creamy and full-bodied example of this traditional style ale. Very dark and very rich."
"Fairly easy drinking stout; I guess I've spoiled myself on too many imperial stouts and excellent porters, and perhaps am expecting more of this stout than I should. Nonetheless, I'd definitely have this again, and it was easily my best beer of the night."
"Gorgeous 2 finger tan head that lingers. Great carbination with less than average body. Strong aroma of sweet carmel and chocolate. Strong roasted malt taste. Very drinkable as long as your not full. One of my go-to beers if I don't see anything else exciting."
"Drinkability- Definitely a great stout. the hops at the end provide a refreshing feel, while still giving you the wholesome characteristics of a good malty brew. This is one of the stars of the Stout style. Definitely preferred over Guiness Extra Stout. Will be purchasing this more often in the future!"
"Light and drinkable for a stout, due in part to the slightly thin mouthfeel. I found this brew to be a bit on the sweet side, though the balance of roasty malts and a slight hop kick on the finish helped to balance things out."
"The feel of this one is superb, it really took me aback and would be worth trying for that alone, as it is, it happens to taste damn great as well. If only it were a tad cheaper over these parts it would be a colder weather staple."
"It's inviting and simple and probably makes a great gateway drug to the stout world. It surely beats the pants off Guinness by any measure."
"Overall, this is a solid stout with character, flavor, and ""social interaction"". This is my first Sierra Nevada beer and I look forward to trying some others from this company. I give it 8 pints out of 10."
"D-This is not a bad beer, but when my favorite Obsidian Stout is available in six packs for $8.99 (often as low as $5.99 on sale) there really is no place in my fridge for this beer."
"drinkability - smooth drinking, good complexity, rich flavor"
"As far as stouts go, I think this is pretty good on a technical level. Thick, malty, and straight forward. I can't fault it for anything."
"goes down average for me. I went into this thinking that I would love this beer. I kept passing up buying it for years for some strange reason. The odd combination of flavors just does not work for me and the aftertaste is even worse. I guess not every beer is meant for everyone. I would like to try this one again in the future to see if this experience is just an aberration."
"Cheers...."
"Seems to me that this could be a session stout but it's still a sipping beer not because of it's body thickness and alcohol content but because of it's flavor. Another great offereing from Sierra nevada if you ask me."
"D - A few places around here stock sixers at a reasonable price so the only way to get this on the cheap is in a case. Where is the variety case for such a common brew? This one should be included BTW."
"D- Easy of drink and very enjoyable. Could be bigger and bolder, but still a very nice Stout to have around."
"Too much hops, not enough complexity. Somewhat disappointing after their lovely porter."
"Drinkability-Quite drinkable with a rather long finish."
"M/D: Nice thick mouthfeel, but the carbonation makes it go down smooth. I would have no problem drinking a 6er or more of this brew :) 4"
"Drinkability - This is a great solid stout with big American hops. A perfect stout for the summer months when you need to change things up. Roasty and hoppy."
"For the style and price, it's an excellent offering. Anytime I want a stout less than imperial, this would be a fine offering."
"D. I have felt let down by other SN beers I have had in the past but this beer really rekindled my optimism in Sierra Nevada. WHAT a lovely, complex stout. A great session beer to have at hand. Will definitely be getting more of this."
"A superb beer, and actually a little underrated in my opinion. Though I haven't had many of the style, I now see this as the definite American Stout. If the hops are somewhat subdued with age, I think this is probably a positive, because the beer I just drank was beautifully balanced."
"Definitely one all-time favorite stand-bys. Nice rich coffee color with off-white head. The aroma presents nice roasted qualities balanced by hints of caramel and a kiss of earthy hops. Flavors are equally balanced: great roasted malt that never over extends its welcome, hints of chocolate and caramel (especially as the it lingers on the palate), and a nice earthy pine quality that builds in the background from the hops. A very easy drinking stout that is spot on for style and addictive. Highly recommended."
"served on: 2JUL2010"
"D: A very good beer, overall. Probably the best porter I've tried. Quite drinkable with a not-too-heavy feel, which could happen with the strong taste."
"D: Some say sessionable, some say quaffable, I say poundable, like Jennifer Love Hewitt. If that is too brash then I'll just say it is good and I can drink it all day."
"Pours a light black with a light brown, impressive head. Faint roasted aroma. Bittersweet chocolate and roasted notes start the flavor profile. Hops come through to balance out the stout. A hint of citrus hops lead to a semi-bitter taste, but well rounded. Medium carbonation and mouthfeel and a bit of creaminess."
"Appearance is very dark black with a nice light brown head. Smell is lightly roasted, but not burnt. Very strong chocolate smell. Very sweet scent. No hop smell, which is surprising for a Sierra Nevada ale. Taste is delicious! Very strong chocolatey taste with light hops. Nice coffee backbone . Mouthfeel is very delightful, not watery at all (even for someone who has drank a lot of imperial stouts lately). I would say this beer lies between your average watered-down stout and an imperial stout. Amazing drinkability...wish I had a whole sixer of this. Sierra Nevada fails to disappoint once again."
"O: Yum! A buy again; a recommend; a search out."
"12-oz bottle. Dark brown pour. Mild roasty aroma. Rocky tan head. Very roasty flavor. Semi-sweet chocolate flavor blending into coffee bean. Mild hoppiness. Medium body. Good flavor without being too heavy or too sweet. Alcohol taste is well controlled. A good stout from a brewer that continues to impress me with quality beers despite their growing size."
"D - An outstanding stout. Another great Sierra Nevada beer."
"I can think of fewer better stouts in the six-pack, highly circulated varieties"
"D: An awesome example of an American Stout... very tasty, easy to drink... and excellent stout to have around at all times."
"Again completely disappointed. I love their porter, but his was completely over hopped for the style. The reason people drink stouts and porters are for the maltiness of them not the hops. If I wanted and IPA I would have drank one."
"D-- Easy to drink and very enjoyable beer. Can knock back 4-5 in a sitting and be able to function well. A lot of flavor and well balanced. Still I think it is the cone hops that make this stand out with the earthiness and touches of pine and citrus that mellow out the coffee, malts, and chocolate in this."
"D - slightly drinkable"
"I could have 2-3 of these with no problem. The light body and relatively low ABV makes this drinkable yet without sacrificing flavor."
"D - The crisp feel of this beer makes it one of the easiest drinking Stouts Ive had, I could easily quaff 2-3 pints. Very drinkable for the style, and I loved the earthy hop character of this stout. I'd definitely buy this one again. Cheers!"
"Overall, a very nice stout. Something you can drink year round."
"d: Very good but not my favorite from SN."
"A decent stout but lacking something for me. The flavour balance isn't quite there."
"D- If I could find this regularly, I would drink it every day!"
"Enjoy!"
"Bought from nates Liqour. Was fridge cold when bought, has been out of fridge for several hours now and is cool. Upon opening smells from the bottle are dark caramel and a faint hint of hops. Pours dark black with no chance of light coming through and a three finger head that recedes very slowly. Taste is very smooth and light for it's darkness with a bitter chocolate note in the back ground. Mouthfeel is ok and does not seem to stick to the palate. Overall a pretty crisp and easy to drink stout."
"Taste is strong chocolate/coffee, roasted malt, and a subtle hoppiness to it. Excellent balance, I may have had a better stout, but this one is impressive in its diversity and balance. Medium full body, smooth, a just a subtle bit of bitterness on the exit. Overall this a very attainable stout, and worth a shot for any occasion."
"Notes: Yes, indeed, this feels like a notched up version of the Porter and in that context slightly better."
"M/D: Not too bubbly and pretty smooth."
"D: Very good. Not the best stout, but good. I'd buy a sixer and probably order a second. Sierra Nevada strikes again with a solid beer that is more or less true to style."
"D - Very nice, thick and complex flavor and refreshing enough to keep going back for more. I generally prefer my stouts with a greater emphasis on the roasted malt flavor, but this is still great."
"D: It is relatively easy to drink."
"D- Could drink this literally all day. My new favorite stout."
"Drinkability: Great stout. Up there in the favorites category."
"This particular stout is acceptable, but it's not THAT good. I'm a little amazed to see so many ""A"" reviews. It's tolerable, and I'll drink the entire six-pack I bought, but I won't be buying it again. In my opinion, they went a little overboard with the hops. This has been the case with every Sierra Nevada brew I've tried, irrespective of style. I don't think of stouts as being this ""hoppy," so it was not what I expected, to say the least."
"D: Could use another one that's for sure. One just doesn't cut it. The flavor is too hard to get over. It really stays with you for a while."
"Conclusion: A ballsy little stout; pretty tasty."
"The feel is a below medium with a malt slickness going into a small hop bite once this goes down the chimney. Carbonation keeps it together, but is tame as well. This easy going stout makes for super easy drinakability. Im finished my glass and want another. I take my sweet time drinking stouts, but not this one, down the hatch."
"D - while it feels nice, the flavor would keep my hand moving down the shelf."
"beers I've tried. I should have gotten to this much, much sooner."
"Solid all around and balanced in every aspect: a near perfect beer."
"Drinkability: Not hard to drink, and if you like a hoppy darker beer, this is not bad."
"The balance of hop bitterness and malt earthiness is sublime. No one aspect of the beer is too intense, but they all work together to form something wonderfully drinkable."
"Overall, nicely balanced and sessionable, a fine example of the style."
"It is much more drinkable than most serious stouts. I am glad that they haven't messed with it all these years. Great stuff."
"I like it."
"Great stout, for a not imperial."
"d - at 5.8 abv i could have a few of these easily. as such, it is one of my go to beers when i hit the liquor store. a fine stout from sierra nevada."
"D - A very solid, sessionable stout from SN. Although the body comes off a little bit thin, it honestly adds to the drinkability. A well balanced stout that I wouldn't mind picking up again."
"D - Very big flavor with a low abv. One of my go to stouts. Would love to try this one on tap. I never hear much about this stout but it is one of the better ones out there. Sierra nevada has yet to let me down."
"The body is pretty crisp on this one. The creamy full-body that I expect and appreciate for the style is a little lacking. A little too bubbly. Big roasty goodness in this beer. Slight charring flavor, but nothing that leaves a bad aftertaste. The cocoa is present at first giving the beer a nice milky sweetness, but as I continue to sip as the beer warms, the hops become more prominent. Finishes slightly bitter with the hops melding with bitter black coffee. Nice beer. I would get a sixer of this and finish it over a weekend no problem. Recommend."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 3/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, yeast, and slight dark citrus. Fits the style of an American Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, roasted malt, slight sweet malt, slight yeast, and slight dark citrus. Overall, a good blend, body, and aroma."
"D - This was a nice stout...I love how the hops stood out and I would expect that from Sierra Nevada...and easy stout to enjoy"
"Pours a dark mahogany/almost black color with 1 finger of tan head that fades slowly to a ring. Smells of rich, roasted malt, slightly sweet with hints of brown sugar and faint medicinal notes. Taste is classic stout - nice, roasted malt flavor up front and then a really interesting finish. Some bitterness makes itself known and then becomes drying before being left with a mild chalky taste with hints of hop oil. Body is medium and drinkability is great - this is one of the easiest drinking stouts I've had."
"This is a fine stout, not creamy or rich in the mouthfeel, but robust and strong from start to finish."
"I originally bought this beer as a way to ""set my palette"" for bigger stouts. The flavors were hoppier that what is more of the norm for today's stouts but not entirely unpleasant. To date this is probably my least favorite Sierra Nevada beer which came as a surprise to me because I am usually a big fan of theirs. I will not be buying again."
"Drinkability: A decent above average stout that is very drinkable. I could have a couple and be happy."
"Cheers!"
"The flavor is rich and full but the beer is very drinkable."
"D: Perfect. I could have quite a few of these"
"All in all, this was a decent brew. Ok to try once. Whether you are a hop guy or a malt guy, I think both can enjoy this one equally. Nothing special, but easy to obtain and enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"One of my go-to stouts... Pours black, with some mahogany around the edges when the glass is held to light. The head is a light tan / off-white that shows good retention and leaves nice spots of lace. Aroma is dominated by roasted malts, some graininess, maybe a touch of oatmeal and notes of citrus hops. Taste is very similar to aroma: lots of roastiness - but the hops are a little more noticeable upon the signature Sierra finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with fairly high / prickly carbonation. Very drinkable and highly enjoyable!"
"pours a light black with highlight of dark chocolate and a light tan lively 3 finger head. bold chocolate tart smells. just great. dark berries with a light mouthfeel. faint chocolate and coffee on the tongue, but not very stouty. kind of medium bodied. tart sweet finish. it lacks a bit more flavor that i like in stouts but it's still really excellent with the smell being the best part."
"D - Love it."
"poured into snifters because sierra nevada is so classy. shabam! sinfully dark, hiding secrets beneath a brown veil. roasty, toasty, and a touch of bitter chocolate. it was pretty good. until we busted out a leftover piece of chocolate tort. oh mother f. what a beautiful match. an inspiration for the soon to transpire chocolate and beer pairing desert fiasco. doubtful it will outdo the chocolate beer tasting of the year before, but dammit! we will try. a delight."
"This beer goes very well with food or on its own. An everyday stout, pleasant, and easy to drink."
"Cheers!"
"M/D: Full bodied. Nice and a little creamy, good amount of carbonation. Pretty good drinkability. Nicely balanced."
"Deep black appearance, wonderful aroma, blasts of hops, chocolate and coffee to a lesser degree. Amazing hop quality and tempered bitterness to the taste. Equal parts thick stout and ipa. Mouthfeel is good, but there is so much, sometimes a little overwhelming. A great of the greats."
"This is a really a great stout, one of the first west coast stouts I really started to like. It's a classic stout that has the character of an imperial stout with a more drinkable abv. Dark brown color with a very good head, dark as well. Awesome aroma. I wish I could find it on tap."
"D - I like to have this around most of the time because it is a good change from most of the high ABV beers I drink. Very easy to kick a few of these back."
"Taste has that roasted bitterness and a hint of iron to it. Mouthfeel is light, smooth and crisp. Has a finish with some light hoppiness. Really it's a solid everyday stout!"
"Notes: A very good stout."
"D - This one went down all too quickly and is highly sessionable given the low abv. A very quaffable effort from Sierra Nevada."
"D: I consider myself a seasonal drinker and usually leave my stouts for september to march, but I'd take this one with me into the summer. This is absolutely fantastic"
"355ml bottle purchased by my girlfriend at Beer World in Largo, FL. Pours an impermeable black with an off-white head and generous amounts of lace. Smell and taste are light roasted malt, coffee, and burnt grains. Port-like, red wine aromas develop as the beer warms. Herbal, citrusy hops produce a spicy bite on the palate. Chocolatey mouthfeel mid-body with a dry, bitter and somewhat leafy finish. Not as bold as I anticipated. Pretty straightforward, but still a good beer. Hop character reminds me of St. Ambroise Stout, without the oatmeal of course."
"D: Overall, it's a nice traditional stout. I was a bit more impressed by the aroma than the actual flavor, but it's still good nonetheless. And at <6% abv, this brew is a great session option when you're looking for a dark beer to throwback."
"All told, this is a very solid & serviceable stout. It drinks well & sits comfortably without being too heavy. At 5.8% abv there certainly is a case for tossing back a few."
"D - Extremely drinkable stout. I'll definitely be having this again and again and agin."
"D: Ok I suppose. The worst of SN's brews."
"D: love this brew very drinkable could session this one all night, very enjoyable flavors. The balance contributes to this category because, there are no over powering flavors that would cause me to stop drinking these."
"Overall: American style stout, though and through. The citrus/toast/roast thing is spot on for the style, but not my preference in a stout."
"I definitely enjoyed this one...it was something different from SN. Awesome for a snowy night after a day of work/school!"
"Overall impression: Pretty much a textbook stout here. Highly recommended."
"SNS never survive long once they hit my fridge."
"D-this is quite a tasty and smooth stout. it is quite light in body and so easily drinkable! definitely a recommendation for a sessionable type stout."
"Comments: This is not a beverage that I would want every day. Maybe too much of a burnt taste for me."
"Highly recomended, this will become my default stout, flavorful, very good and readily available. Thank you Sierra Nevada!"
"Medium full bodied finish- good carbonation that is super smooth and goes down too easy. One of the best plain stouts imagineable without being anything more than a stout. Full of flavor and drinkability. You cant go wrong with this."
"There are other stouts that are more my liking."
"Overall it's hard to find much wrong with this beer. Like I said before, SN knows how to make solid examples and this is no exception."
"Mouthfeel: A little watery but it has good carbonation which makes up for that."
"It's perhaps a touch strong for my taste, but that's no mark against it. Well-crafted from what I can tell and I'll drink it again, no doubt."
"cheers."
"All told, this is an easy drinking stout that's packed with flavor but maintains a fairly low ABV so you can put back more than one. Very good, but I'm not surprised; I don't think Sierra Nevada is capable of making a bad beer."
"This opaque brown/black beer is full of roasted bitterness that finishes with a lingering silky richness. Just the right amount of hop character. A perfect example of a dry american stout. Try it with a polish sausage with sauer kraut, or maybe another Sierra Nevada Stout."
"Overall, an exceptional example of an American Stout. Sierra Nevada continues to do the basics very very well. Highly Recommended."
"Drinkability: Solid effort. Near perfect drinkability. I would have this slightly warmer next time by about 3 or 4 degrees but its a great year round drinker!"
"This is one of those beers that ive been hanging to try and finally get my wish and got a feeling it wont let me down,it pours a nice jet black colour with nice carbonation that leaves a two finger mocha coloured head with beautiful lacing so far so good,and the aroma is as good as the appearance with an impressive smell of roasted coffee,dark malts and suprisingly enough beautiful floral piney hops,it has a nice full but light body mouthfeel at the finish with tastes of dark roasted expresso,chocolate malts and floral piney hops that really balances out this stout to make it a nice anytime stout whether it be winter or summer i really could drink this stout at anytime of the year and for my palette would put it up there with the best stouts that i have tasted."
"D-Overall, this is a very drinkable stout."
"Dark mahogony/black. Great thick dark tan head. Very fragrant roasted burnt smokey barley. Great tasting stout. Dry, roasted smokey grain with some coffee up front. Some malty creamy sweetness shows up. More of a bitter hop presance than most stouts I've had. That's probably why I like it. Nice robust complex roasted bittersweet flavors, with a nicely placed refreshing bitter hop snap. Very flavorfull. Easier drinking than alot of stouts. Thick and creamy satisfying mouthfeel without going overboard and feeling like a hop flavored milkshake. One of the better stouts I have had. Sierra Nevada is good at everything."
"D: Another great one from Sierra Nevada. These guys just really know how to put a beer together."
"Notes: This is the cornerstone for the American stout. Some may do it better, but this is the beer they are judged by."
"A top choice for an American stout. Nothing fancy or attention-grabbing, just rock solid craftsmanship. Great stuff."
"D= rather nice, sessionable if you like a slightly dry stout."
"D: This is a crisp refreshing American stout. This beer is highly drinkable and delicious, but seemed a little heavy on the hops. Definitely will buy again though."
"Drinkability: A stout this good at 5.8% is one of the biggest tasting session beers around. Delicious, cheap, available."
"D - This is a solid go-to stout. Nothing flashy, but very well constructed. I have purchased this a couple times without reviewing it - I am glad I finally got to put my thoughts down for it. I would definitely recommend this one if you are looking for a long night of drinking..."
"I don't think that I have ever had a SN beer that I haven't enjoyed"
"D- This is a very drinkable stout that I will buy when I just want a well made stout. There is nothing over the top with this stout but it is just balanced and smooth. Good stout for people to try who don't like stouts."
"I love SNPA and most SN stuff and yea I know they are west coasters hop heads but they screwed the pooch with this one IMHO, its funny the Bros said its world class. I remember years ago and it was Not this hoppy a beer in my mind. oh well maybe my mind and taste buds are fooling me in my over 50 mind."
"Pours a thick black color with a small tan head that leavs some lacing. Smells strong of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. The taste is the same, but stronger on the coffee than chocolate. Nce mouthfeel and good drinkability. This is a very good stout and im not suprised at all by this sierra nevada brew. Not the best stout ive had, but its up there."
"This went down almost too easy for a stout. The lower ABV allows for multiples. Well done from the SN crew."
"Let this beer warm up a great deal, and it's one of the best American stouts you'll taste and worthy of drinking year round. What an underrated gem."
"Drinkability is very good on a cold rainy/snowy afternoon. All the ingredients are in balance which makes this beer a great standard american stout to enjoy."
"D: the simplest things can be the most rewarding (especially when done right) and this one does it. Pretty much packed with flavor and drinkability"
"Purchased from Trader Joe's. Pours a black body with a thick tan head. Aroma is of earthy, roasted malts. Full bodied with medium carbonation and a chewy mouthfeel. Flavors are roasted malts, coffee and bitter chocolate. Still one of the best stouts out there."
"dry on the palate but not bad. overall a drinkable stout at 5.8%."
"Drinkability is good; overall a good beer."
"D: It definitely tastes good enough, and for a stout, it goes down very easy."
"That being said, I did enjoy this beer and will definitely buy it again, it's just one that I need to be in the mood for."
"Beautiful pour, great big cocoa colored head. The smell was pretty muted at first, this aroma was unique because it improved as the head disappeared instead of being most pungent while foaming. Milk chocolate in the nose with some roasted coffee beans and vanilla cookie. The taste improves as it warms but is delicious right out of the cooler. It has a big hop character for a stout and a nice creamy mouthfeel. Cocoa nibs, mild booze, graham and roasted malt in the taste."
"Poured it into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. It's almost black in color and dark brown when you hold it up to the light. It has a huge tan head that produces generous amounts of lacing, it sticks all over the glass. The smell is dominated by chocolate. I'd actually say more like chocolate malts, not as strong as a chocolate stout, but the chocolate is still the dominant feature followed by some floral hop aroma. The taste picks up where the smell left off but everything is a bit stronger. Kind of a sweet chocolate malty taste and a dry hop to it. The mouthfeel is good, but it's one of the most carbonated stouts I've ever had, it doesn't take anything away. This is a very drinkable stout, a great beer by a great brewery."
"12 oz. bottle. Nice dark color, strong roast smell. Pours a nice dark color. Tastes like roasted barley and some hops with hints of coffee and dark chocolate. Goes down real smooth, would not have trouble drinking a couple of these in one sitting. Definitely one of the better stouts out there."
"A great everyday stout for when you are looking for something a step up from a porter yet nowhere near 'big beer' status."
"A very solid stout, lots of layers that work well together. My only knock being i would love to have a touch more sweetness in the finish. Other than that, one of the best available stouts out there."
"4/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"D - Not a great stout, but a good one. Especially for the price."
"frankly the metallic quality with this is a bit hard to get by to truly enjoy this beer. I have 3 other opportunities to retry this. hopefully I will be re-reviewing this soon."
"Overall, definitely recommended. I will probably pick up more of these in the future."
"D - give me a few of these on a cold night, and i'd be happy. wish it was more common around here as i'd love to stock up on it for the winter"
"Thanks to my bud, Cdkrenz for hooking me up with this bottle!"
"If someone wanted to try a stout for the first time this is the way I would steer them. It is a standard by which to judge other stouts by."
"I love this beer. Great Stout with both depth and drinkability. Initial impression is a complex and deep flavor, lots of traditional stout notes present but Sierra Nevada is known for Hops and there's some in there. Smell is like a chocolate/coffee in the morning, deep and rich. The taste is smooth as butter for such a complex beer. Mouthfeel is full and strong, thick like a stout should be. drinkability, well, I love Guinness Stout and Extra Stout....and I'd ""session beer"" with this over anything else in the stout family. A winner all around! Try it!"
"Worthy of a try but this has sat in my fridge for a while and I'm glad this is the last of the sixer. It's just not very interesting and the bitterness could be balanced out a bit more."
"This is a superb stout, well balanced and superbly drinkable, and another quality release from Sierra Nevada."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a deep dark chocolate brown, nice and thick pour. A milk chocolate color head that is thick and just sits on top of the brew going nowhere. The aroma is lacking a little. Some notes of slightly burnt malt, a little coffee, and a slight hazelnut is present. The taste makes up for what is missing in the smell. It is bold and has a strong coffee front, some burnt caramel, a slightly bitter finish as well. The balance is great. Nice carbonation makes the flavors pop as they go from front to back and the finish and aftertaste leave you wanting more. This is an excellent stout."
"with a light abv% and a refreshing taste i could drink many."
"Overall, this is my favorite SN brew at the moment. This will warrant another buy on my part in the future."
"p.s. what a great finish...the hops are just so perfectly integrated into this. i hope this never changes."
"SN stout has everything a decent stout needs, and while this selection doesn't really stand out in any way, it is a very solid beer. another great offering from Sierra Nevada."
"Overall, one of the better stouts below 8% ABV I have ever had. Big, balanced flavors make this well worth the price. Highly recommended."
"J"
"Dark milk chocolate brown, with a creamy tan head that has nice retention and leaves some streaks of lacing. Slightly fruity, charred malt, smokey aroma, with mild bitterness. Sweet flavor of roasted malt and barley, very creamy and fluffy on the tongue, with mild carbonation. Finish lingers with more roasted malt and milk chocolate notes. Very nice, complex and balanced stout, not all that different than their porter, but that's not a bad thing."
"Drinkability: Perfect Stout for those chilly Autumn evenings. As well as those chilly mornings."
"M/D - A bit sticky but otherwise easy to drink. Easily sessionable and a great introduction to the style that seems to get overlooked."
"Semi-dry finish with the generous carbonation I've come to expect from Sierra Nevada. A really nice, and often overlooked stout. This would pair excellently with some smokey BBQ or a sharp cheese."
"Pitch black with a thin beige head that laced very well. Roasted malt, coffee, cocoa, and even a little pine/citrus come through in the nose. The flavor is initially dominated by roasted malt, which gives way to some pine and cocoa, and then finishes with cocoa and coffee. Thinner body than expected, but still velvety and greatly satisfying, and very sessionable. Not much carbonation, as expected, given the cask, but man was this stout drinkable."
"Pours a pitch black oil color with a tan half finger head that doesn't fizz out right away but doesn't retain very well either. Leaves great lacing as I drink this one away. Smell is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and pine hops, a pretty strong smell at that, good for a change. Tastes of roasted malts up front with some chocolate and coffee. Pine hops strongly follow and some citrus hops come into play too. Pine hops and dark malts coat the mouth following the swallow. I definitely sense a bit of alcohol in this one, but a pretty good taste nonetheless. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good carbonation bite to it. Pretty creamy beer here. Not too heavy for a stout but I feel like the pine hops and alcohol flavors may take this one over with time. The price is fine and I probably would buy this one as a session stout if I don't find a cheap stout to outdo this one (probably Ipswich Oatmeal Stout)."
"Excellent drinkability. As the Bros have said, this brew would be good morning, noon, and night. Id be so lucky to be able to do such a thing!"
"A drinkable stout to say the least. Very enjoyable."
" This is a very nice, balanced American stout. Hop bitterness is very present but balanced with a nice toasty sweetness. I would take this over many other stouts and would be able to handle one or two more, which gives a fairly high drinkability score in my book."
"D - A very drinkable ale, not my first choice when it comes to stbuts, but well brewed and quaffable."
"D: This is one of my favorite stouts and one of the most drinkable."
"Drinks pretty well, but a little too low powered to be a great drinking stout."
"i could drink a couple of these"
"Drinkability: Balanced and bold flavors but not overpowering; very drinkable"
" ~ This is a good beer. I certainly recommend anyone inexperienced with it (or any other Sierra Nevada brew for that matter) give it a try. It is certainly a good move."
"Tate mirrors the nose well, lots of roasty malt flavors accentuated by a pine sap hoppiness. A few flashes of sweetness here and there, but finishes soft and fairly dry. It's a very drinkable stout where in a world of imperial and double stouts, sometimes this one is just what the doctor ordered."
"This is an easy drinking, tasty stout that's pretty well balanced. Body seems a bit thin. Overall, a decent beer."
"Overall: won't be purchasing again."
"Pours a dark brown with a modest head that quickly fades to a collar. A little coffee aroma. The taste was a bit watery for a stout, more like a porter. I got some coffee and as it warmed up some chocolate too, but mild for a stout. Too thin for a stout, carbonation nothing special either. Drinkability better than most stouts due mostly to the watery, thinness. OK beer, this is just a very tough category."
"Drinkability: What a delightful stout! I loved the tap version I had a few weeks back at the brewery, so I was curious to see if the bottled version was just as good. Well, it is. I'll definitely be buying more of this. Sierra Nevada Stout is a fantastic example of the ""American Stout"" style."
"Flavor is very well-balanced. Big roasted barley character. Surprisingly hoppy for a stout as well, with an almost IPA like bitter aftertaste. A hint of sweet malt and lots of roasted, coffee-like malt balance things out. Mouthfeel is medium. Nicely coats the tongue without overwhelming the palate. This is an excellent stout, and one I'd definitely have again. Another solid one from SN."
"Drinkability is good. A little to heavy for when I am drinking it but definetley a good one on those chilly night's. Easy to have few of these outside on a nice winter's day."
"Drinkability: With this stout being akin to the Guinness Extra Stout I found its drinkability on the low end as this is a sipping brew for a certain group of hopheads that enjoy the bitterness and the lingering bitter after-taste, as for me I found myself just wanting to be done with my glass which is a shame. Rename this as an Extra Stout and I think it would be more fitting of the experience in with this particular offering by Sierra Nevada."
"This beer pours a black with a hint of brown hues. There is a small finger worth of tan lace that dissolves rather quickly. There is little to no cling to speak of and some carbonation presence at the bottom of the glass after the pour. There are notes coffee in the smell but I didn't find anything overpowering. My sniffer might be off tonite because I really did not get any other smells than the coffee tones. The taste is an extension of the coffee that I smelled. There is a malty backbone and a somewhat bitter finish to the beer. Overall a good SN offering but not my favorite beer out of Chico. This is a good stout however I have other choices at my disposal and would probably grab one of those before getting this again. I am slowly making my way through Sierra Nevada and I have yet to have a bad beer from them."
"Drinkability: Really good. It has a great flavor without being overpowering. This is a really enjoyable beer."
"Very nice roasted chocolate and caramel malts. Slightly subdued, but some sweetness rises as the glass nears room temperature. My nose picks up traces of licorice, thought this could be confusion caused by the sweet scent that I was having trouble putting my finger on. The flavor is a reiteration of the scent. The flavors are big and robust, but are a little bit too straight-forward and one dimensional. Still a surprise given the style."
"taste is thick with a lively carbonation, chocolate, touch of coffee, touch of vanilla, and a little caramel, somewhat dry ending, with a slightly bitter aftertaste."
"M/D: The burnt aftertaste becomes a bit grating towards the end. The mouthfeel is smooth, well-carbonated, yet I wish it was a bit more thicker with some more complexity to warrant buying another."
"D - The most drinkable stout in terms of quality and drinkability."
"D - Very, because of the refreshing effects. Very nice."
"looks dark (of course) with see-through amber edges and a nice tan-almost-getting-brown head that leaves minimal lacing. smells of roasted coffee and chocolate, though not really strong enough to be a great smelling beer. hints of coffee and chocolate in the taste as well. roasted malts in the finish, and even hints of hops throughout. a very good [regular] stout that stands up to Deschutes' obsidian (not quite though)."
"These would go down well on a fall day. I wish we could get them in Ontario!"
"Pours a cola-like fluid dark brown with reddish amber where light passes thru. Aroma is some roasted malt, nothing too strong but definitely nice. A slight bitterness is in there. The flavor is also very roasty and sweet with dark malt and only a hint of hops balancing it out. Mouthfeel is quite full-bodied but not as thick as say a full on RIS. The drinkability is very good for a stout. It's probably one of the most-sessionable stouts you'll come across. Great flavor, lower abv, and a nice mouth without being like molasses."
"12 oz bottle pured into a pint glass. Pours black with a small lingering head. Aroma of sweet chocolate. Nicely balanced with good medium feel. Flavors of chocolate with a coffee finish. Overall pretty tasty and drinkable. Nothing spectacular, but still a better than average stout."
"Overall this was a very drinkable and very smooth stout. Extremely solid and I would expect nothing else from them. They have mastered the art of brewing and this is no exception. Would go here again any day."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is a solid, tasty, easy drinking stout. I'm glad I have 5 more in the fridge..."
"The mouthfeel is smooth, with a subtle hop profile on the palate. I would probably enjoy this more if paired with a light, sweeter dessert such as chocolate mousse (as opposed to bittersweet truffles) or with a stronger cheese or good barbecue, but for the foreseeable future I can't see myself enjoying this on its own."
"Great Stout, though."
"One of the most drinkable stouts that I have had, even people who are not fans of stouts could get down with this. Different then a lot of stouts I've had because of the hoppy flavor but I think that is highly innovative."
"12oz bottle. Pours a clear black with red tinges and a substantial, rocky tan head. Smells slightly tangy with dark roasted malts and hints of cocoa and coffee. Tastes quite chocolatey as well; the flavor is all roasty malt with a slightly bitter finish. Medium body with low carbonation. Nicely balanced; an unbeatable stout for the price."
"A nice enough stout, but not one I would go looking for in the future. There are just too many other excellent offerings out there these days."
"D: Low ABV and good tasting; I can't ask for a more drinkable beer."
"The flavor deepens throughout the glass, soft and creamy mouthfeel, easy to drink and enjoy. The firkin did not last long, as expected, but I got to have two and could have had several more."
"Beer poured jet black with a huge tan head that is sustaining quite well. Nose is roasted malts and hints of chocolate and floral hops. Taste starts with a roasted malt dominance with some cocoa powder, finishing strong with a blast of dry hops. Mouthfeel is fairly full and satisfying. Drinkability is good. This is a very hoppy flavorful stout that will be enjoyed again!"
"Lots of grated chocolate and carob on the nose, some light coffee notes and a decent earthy hop backdrop. Taste follows the nose but is a bit too perky on the carbonation at first, cloaking some flavor. As the beer warms to proper temperature and the carbonation settles a bit, the taste is creamier and has a slightly sweet finish. A lingering chocolate close returns after the swallow as well, yielding a good feel. Good drinkability as the beer offers enough flavor to keep thinks interesting, yet is fairly light in body and ABV."
"Notes - The beer had a good mouthfeel too. At 5.8% this is almost a perfect stout."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable - one of the most palatable stouts for beginners - train on this for four months and then drink a KBS or Breakfast - and enjoy. This is a great all around stout - doesn't try to be what it's not - everything is balanced."
"Stout is simply another impressive beer from the fine folks at Sierra Nevada. It's certainly not their best beer, but it's a far cry from their worst. It's all-around very solid for an American Stout. Surprisingly, I believe it'd be a little better with more malt. That aspect is pretty good, but could be improved and would add more body. Seems like an easy improvement. It's still a classic in their arsenal that's worthy of your attention."
"Pours an extremely dark brown/border line black with a nice big off white colored head. The head is big and isn't going anywhere anytime soon it looks like. Leaves good lacing down the glass. The smell is really good, smells of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate. Smells nice. Taste, wow, I was sure this one was going to be pretty good because of the reviews and because it's Sierra Nevada but damn this one is tasty. With a good creamy mouthfeel the taste has coffee and chocolate like the aroma. The roasted malt is apparent and it all blends pretty nicely. I don't think this one is extremely complex or anything but I don't think it really has to be. Very drinkable. A great stout for sure, it's definitely up there."
"12 oz. Dark brown pour, slight cream foam. Roast malt chocolate aromas. Tastes quite similarly, good amount of miniscule carbonation creates a creamy mouthfeel. Good finish, just a bit of coffee bitterness and very drinkable. This might actually be my favorite SN mass beer."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. The Body is very dark, close to black. Great foamy creamy head, close to about 1 and half inches. Aroma smells of roasted malts and british chocolate. This stout taste superb. Tons of roast malt character with a hint of chocolate and I think I taste some caramel grains. Nice inviting warm mouthfeel. The head retention is very nice and leaves good foam rings on the glass. Overall this is very good stout, definitely impressed by Sierra Nevadas attempt at this classic style. I only wish it had a higher ABV."
"I could definitely drink a huge amount of this. If I saw this in a friends fridge, I wouldn't hesitate to pick one up, but I really don't think this is worthy of its high rating on here. Good, but far from great."
"D: Pretty darned good experience and better than I was expecting. Goes down very easy for a stout and doesn't have the heaviness that is expected from the style. The feel could be a bit heavier and the aroma could produce more, but thats nit picking to tell the truth. A solid and simple stout. Enjoyable and sessionable."
"Decants pitch black with a quickly growing large and rolling dark tan head. Retention is phenomenal and demands patience. Thick fingers of lace are left behind. Smells of sweet and dark chocolates and roasted malts. Some hops linger behind. A quick sweetness hits the palate and is quickly followed by dark chocolates and a good hit of hops. Roasted coffee beans and a hint of vanilla exists. A slight creaminess is overtaken by a sharpness going down. Lies big on the palate, but doesn't weigh too much on the stomach. Grand version of a standard porter."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Darkest brown with red highlights. Creamy tan head that leaves great lacing. Aromas of roasted barley, milk chocolate, and citrus. Lots of coffee, toffee, and chocolate in the flavor, with accents of smoke, fruity hops, and a touch of sour mash. Rich and smooth mouthfeel with mousse-like carbonation. A really solid stout."
"D - Low alcohol and very tasty. Endlessly Drinkable."
"A classic!"
"D - Same friends noted superior drinkability. Just a great beer overall."
"M/D- Medium carbonation. Smooth, carbonated and slightly creamy. Easy drinking."
"Its a nice dark stout. Pours a nice tan head that stayed the whole drink. Smells like hops and sweet roasted barley. A very smooth stout. Great mouthfeel and light coffee tastes. Creamy. Really the whole time I was drinking this beer I thought, ""This is what a stout should be if you were explaining a straight up stout to someone."" Nothing way out there and not nasty, just a very nice stout that really shows you that brewing is a finely balanced craft."
"D - one of my favorite stouts and a great sessionable dark beer; great for black and tans when paired with a nice bitter ale"
"A quality beer for sure but may not be your go-to stout if your a Draught/Nitro Stout drinker (like me). Very drinkable but a bit heavy for 6 in a row. YMMV"
"Good drinkability due to the flavor, a bit too hoppy for a stout in my opinion. Not too heavy or palate wrecking. I don't see myself going out and buying more of these anytime soon but the flavor is interesting enough I wouldn't by any means turn it down."
"12 oz bottle poured on Easter Sunday with my meal. Pours a deep dark brown with a nice foam tan head. It smells of roasted malts, and a citrusy hop aroma is in there as well. Smells a bit hoppy for a stout. This was my complaint on the taste as well. It tastes too bitter and hoppy for me. I know SN loves their hops, but I feel they over do the bitterness on a lot of their beers. I wasn't a big fan of it here in this stout. Not bad, but definitely not the best. Mouthfeel is fine. Drinkability? I probably won't buy this again. There are way too many better stouts out there."
"Looking back, it seems like I complain about this beer, even though there is very little to complain about. It's a very solid stout, especially for its price point. Its balanced flavor and subtleties make it a better than average stout for pairing with food, as well. It went great with a bowl of chili on a colder than usual spring evening for me. Price, availability and food compatibility often are big factors for me in beer. Well done, Sierra Nevada!"
"Notes: I have to be honest, I am underwhelmed by this Sierra Nevada offering. It's well put-together, with some good flavor in the front end. But, the back half of this beer is kind of off-putting for me which really hinders the drinkability. In my opinion, it falls way short of reaching the levels of other top-notch American Stouts. Don't get me wrong, it's not horrible by any means, but not great by any means, either."
"Sierra Stout is pitch black with a smallish but long lasing tan head. It smells like roasted coffee beans. It has a pleasantly complex taste. It has roasted coffee, caramel, and some chocolate to it. It has a medium body and just the right amount of carbonation. I am very surprised by this beer. I was not expecting it to be this great! I find it very drinkable."
"Good overall stout, probably a great introductory stout to get people used to the style but its not something I want to come back to after exploring the rest of what the world has to offer. Still, this is fairly widespread distribution and is definitely worth trying for those who have not done so."
"drinkability: probably one of the best regular stouts I have ever had."
"Drinkability- Incredible, such nice sweet tones up front with enormous back hops to add tone a bitter to the sweetness, great stout, very impressed, one to really enjoy and have many more times"
"Overall I would say that Sierra Nevada Stout is a great version of the American Stout style. Its complexity would definitely challenge a Guinness drinker, while its smoothness makes it much more drinkable compared to most American craft beer stouts."
"This is a nice brew that I am surprised I haven't seen in Mississippi. I will make sure to buy this again when I travel out of state."
"D: A very good low alcohol stout, but inferior to the bottled version. Compared to the bottled version it has less fruity flavors but interestingly a more pronounced hop character. Most importantly, its body is way lighter."
"One of the last available Sierra Nevada beers I had yet to try... great beer to save for last too. Pours a nice dark brown, big fluffy head and tons of lacing. Nice roasted smell to it, taste is very well balanced.. malty, yet the hops are present (it's Sierra Nevada, what else do you expect?) nice and creamy mouthfeel that just goes down smooth. Way too easy to drink and another great session beer from an awesome brewery."
"This beer is very drinkable, a very nice take on a stout. I wanted to try it for years and it lived up to the hype. I could get a case of this and drink the night away. Very nice."
"As an aside, this beer is very much similar to the Oatmeal Milk Stout by River Horse (a local micro). Indeed, the similarity is uncanny. Given that the River Horse example is a seasonal/limited edition brew, I'll have to keep the Sierra Nevada in mind when I can't get the Oatmeal Milk."
"Anytime I feel like a Stout, this is where my mind goes."
"Poured from 12oz bottle black with some hints of brown and red when held up to light. One finger tan head, some sticky lacings remaining on the glass. Faint smell of caramel, roast malt, and molasses. Taste of roasted malts, bitter coffee balanced with hops. Medium body, with a long finish. Well balanced, decent brew."
"Drinkability: A little too bitter for me, but it would make a great dessert drink."
"I found this to be a very mild, rather sweet stout. This makes it easy to drink, but not very impressive or memorable. I would much rather have something more full flavored..."
"2"" beige head that has excellent retention. Thick, fresh rings of lace left behind in its wake. Black, with only hints of dark brown down at the edges. Bold roasted malts and a very noticable dose of hops behind it. Roasted malts, coffee with a splash of cream and a good bit of leafy hops in the finish. Tasty. Full bodied with a smooth, round mouthfeel and low carbonation. One hell of a beer from Sierra as usual."
"Seems on the thinner side than the flavor depicts. Makes this extremely drinkable and enjoyable. Once again, one of those beers that makes you ask -- why don't I drink this more often. One of my favorite standard stouts."
"D - I went to Chico recently and I drank a metric shit ton of these. A wonderful beer."
"I like this stout. its nice & malty, but still very well balanced. very drinkable"
"If you want a good brew that resembles the definition of an American stout, this would be it. First of all, it's dark. It's so dark that I had to hold it up to the sunlight to see any translucence at all. The perfectly sized head has a light toffee color to it. The scent of roasted malts comes through easily, as well as a hint of dark chocolate. As far as taste goes, the roasted and chocolate malts are pretty evenly balanced. The one surprise with this beer is the relatively high hoppieness at the finish, but that's not too strange for American stouts, and it explains the large ammount of lacing around the glass. This beer is medium-high bodied, the perfect viscosity for the standard stout, in my opinion. Drinkability is high, and at a relatively low abv, it makes a great session stout. I would recommend this as a good gateway stout for both the inexperienced BMC drinker and for the average hop-head who wants to branch out to the darker brews. The only thing that really stops me from giving this beer more than four in any category (except appearance) is that it just doesn't do anything to jump out of the crowd outside of its perfect color."
"D-A pretty damn decent stout. I like it. Sessionable, but deep enough to enjoy just one, as well."
"D- Not first on my stout list, but I'll have it again."
"Smooth mouthfeel and great aftertaste. This one's a good benchmark for the style."
"A really interesting stout. Lots going on, some hops to add a twist (though not lots of hops ala Bear Republick) and lots of roasted malts. I think they succeed in finding that balance and it makes for an enjoyable drink that, at a reasonable ABV, could be the stout lover's go-to beer for the night."
"D- A beautiful example of the complexity of a good stout. Fantastic appearance with sweet and bitter balance. excellent!"
"D: Very pleasant and warming. I loved the lingering tastes. I look forward to trying some other brews by Sierra Nevada."
"The rather mild ABV and delicious cocoa-stout flavor make this a highly drinkable stout. The Hops add in just the appropriate amount of citric lightness and balance. The rather high carbonation is enjoyable as well. I will add this to my regular Sierra rotation."
"Verdict: Maybe it's because I associate Sierra Nevada mainly with the hoppier styles of beer rather than the malty ones, but I was expecting this to be a solid, but generally unexciting Stout. Boy, was I wrong. This is a chocolaty, complex beer very much worth a look."
"Pours out one shade darker than pitch black with a lot of tan creamy head. Excellent lacing and head retention. Smells are of malts, hints of molasses, and a bitter hoppy edge. Taste is very malty, a bit bitter and roasted. Leaves a burnt aftertaste, Taste is good, but not great. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied, not too heavy on the carbonation. Overall, pretty drinkable and a good beer."
"Overall this is a pretty darn nice stout. I would get this again if i was in the mood for an everyday stout."
"High drinkability...not overly complex but enough flavor and a low enough abv to be a very good all night drinker."
"Overall a great beer and I can't believe it's taken me this long to try it."
"eh, nothing special. not enough malt or other complexities..."
"A very enjoyable stout to say the least, and another winner from Sierra Nevada. Very complex and rich. I'd give the slight edge to their porter (personal preference), but I'd most certainly buy this again."
"A pretty good stout."
"Fantastic beer - can't really ask for much more in a stout. I could drink way too many of these."
"D: A really nice enjoyable stout, really helped segway some non-craft beer drinkers into dabbling outside their usual realm."
"Very rich and smooth. Medium body. Considering how smooth this is, the drinkability is through the roof. I absolutely adore this Stout, and will be drinking it for quite some time. I haven't had a lot of Stout's, but this is as close to perfect as I can imagine. We'll see if my opinion (and rating) changes over time."
"D: One of the classic American Stouts. I'm glad to have had this one."
"M&D: well-balanced but pronounced in taste, this full-bodied and hoppy stout comes delicious and assertive at first and ends deep and elegant in the finish. Given a mild bite from the tiny fizz, the slightly dense texture is lifted up somewhat and results in a very desirable level of ""quaffability"" to me... A sheer delight to sip AND quaff!"
"SN Stout pours a dark brown, almost black with a one finger tan head. The smell is roasted malts with coffee, chocolate, caramel and a slight hint of red wine. The taste is mainly bitter malts, dark chocolate; sort of woody. Mouthfeel is lighter than I expected but smooth. Overall, this is a very drinkable stout. It's a little different from a lot of other stouts I've had -- thinner and more chocolatey."
"Drinkability: Not all too dissimilar from the porter, really, it's just got a dialed up roast component. So, if you dug the porter, you should dig the stout. If you didn't dig the porter, well..."
"As a final note, the stout is very similar to their porter. The look of the stout is a little better and the taste profile is a little more bitter, but it's clear the two are siblings."
"drinkability- great easy drinking stout."
"D - Lots of chocolate that is to much in my opinion. Mostly enjoyable but there are better ones."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, medium-full bodied. Carbonation is in the middle of the road. The hoppy finish is a welcomed, and surprising, aspect of this brew. This is extremely drinkable as I find it to very complex for some reason. The mix of milk chocolate, hops, roasted malts, and dark fruits is really interesting. The only thing lacking in my book is the aroma department. But overall, a very, very good stout. Cheers to Sierra Nevada."
"Unfortunately, it's a little tough to find this beer around here. The majority of beer drinkers around here only drink cheap swill."
"Overall, I'd be hard-pressed to choose another stout over Sierra Nevada's classic. The generous usage of hops in this stout is the magic touch, and makes this one of my favorite brews."
"Dark cola brown as it pours from the bottle; leaves a tan, foamy head. Dark brown in the glass that lets through just a little red highlighting around the edges. The smell is pretty faint--all I detect is roasty malt. The taste is good and true to style (my current favorite style). As the beer warms and the fizz dissipates the mouthfeel seems creamier and the taste richer. As stouts go, this isn't particularly remarkable, but it is a good, solid beer."
"If you think Sierra Nevada Brewing is only known for their pale ale, guess again. Their stout, along with their porter, harvest ale, Celebration Ale, and Bigfoot are all additional reasons to love and drink this brewery's beer, regardless of beer knowledge."
"Drinkability: This beer is a beautiful thing to behold, with amazing lacing. Smell and taste were a little bit of a letdown, though. Especially for such a high quality brewery from which I expect a lot."
"D - However! the lack of viscosity to the brew does lend itself to be very easy to drink, and this is a redeemable quality."
"Poured from bottle to pint glass. Very dark brown almost black in color. Had a big frothy head with good retention and left alot of lacing. Initial aroma of chocolate, roasted malts and coffee. Maybe my nose is going bad but I don't smell any hops like others have. Tastes almost like it smells. Reminds me of chocolate covered coffee beans. Has a semi bitter after taste that goes away quickly. Was a little thin but overall a very drinkable, great tasting beer."
"pours a deep reddish-brown w/ a thick tan head which settles into chunks of bubbles and a ring of lace that coats the sides of my nonic quite well ; smell starts off with a citrusy cascade hop aroma turning a bit more coffee-like and fruity as it warms ; a nice hop bitterness and flavor initially turning to a more roasty and citrus with dark fruit notes, finishes quite hoppy ; a semi-dry creamy mouthfeel, a good co2 level as well ; an awesome brew, very drinkable, i'm surprised i haven't tried this one yet, one of the best stouts i've had..."
"Overall I don't know why we can't get this in GA, but I'll be buying more of it next time I'm in FL. Give this one a shot."
"Ok drinkability."
"The roasted chocolate malt really came through on the first sip of this beer. A great sweet flavor that is better than most stouts that I have had. A slight tinge of bitterness in the aftertaste, reminded me that I was drinking a strong beer. This beer had a heavy flavor to it, but it was slight fairly decent on the palate."
"Good drinkability, but is quite filling."
"This is another great offering from Sierra Nevada. This beats the pants off of most readily available stouts. At its price for a six pack, this is a tremendous value."
"Overall: A thin stout with an astringent mouthfeel. I found this stout very plain and boring on the palate. There was not much balance to this beer. I was hoping for more of a malt backbone to stand up to the hops. It was just and okay beer and nothing special, kinda disappointed."
"Very good taste. Nice blend of malts, caramel and hints of dark chocolate and espresso"
"D: Although this beer is pretty tasty, it's also rather filling. The first one will be drinkable, albiet in small sips, but I don't think I'd drink more than one. While the beer is pretty tasty, I think it's a little to heavy to grab a second from the fridge."
"(rated Feb 28, 2007)"
"I got this stuff because I had tried the Pale Ale and liked it, and the price was right - can't beat $6.99 for a sixer. I will definitely be revisiting this great beer!"
"Brown Ale - Columbus Nut Brown, Sammy Smith's Brown"
"Complex aroma and flavor. Good atmosphere, and taste. A real pleasure to slowly sip down this quaff."
"Notes: I am really impressed. Sierra Nevada is able to create greatness at a wide range of styles."
"Pours from the bottle to a dark black coffee color, with thick tan head that lingers well into the glass and leaves good lacing. Aroma is a very pleasant blend of malty chocolate, caramel, toffee and coffee. Mouthfeel is full, creamy and slightly tingly-sweet, with a taste that follows the nose well. Finish long lasting and a tad bittersweet. A darn good stout."
"Finally, I get to find this in a single. Dark, dark brown pour with a minimal tan head. Roasty, malty, dark chocolate aroma. Creamy mouthfeel with little to no carbonation. Smooth, bittersweet cocoa, toffee, vanilla, and malt up front, with the trademark Sierra Nevada bitter hop bite in the back. Really good beer."
"single from Trader Joe's, Hampton, VA"
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a nice medium creamy tan head. Smell is of toasted malt. Taste is roasted malt up front, coffee and chocolate, with a malty sweet middle, and earthy hops in the finish. Drier tasting than I would have imagined, but still quite nice. Nice bitterness also. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, nice carbonation. I would definitely drink this again, it is a good example of an American stout."
"Pours nearly black with some crisp red highlights at the edges. The cap is a sandy brown with good retention and even better lacing,this looks great. The nose has lots of chocolate upfront with some very subtle coffee notes. Some pretty big hop aromas emerge for a Stout. The flavors are made up of light coffee,caramel,light citrus(orange rind),and tons of dark chocolate. This has an underlying nuttiness that adds a nice spin on standard Stout flavors. This is creamy,but more gritty and textured,a little dry. A very drinkable Stout that all malt lovers can appreciate. SN has incredible consistency,the Stout is no exception."
"3.6/5"
"Not one of my favorites but decent."
"Poured a dark brown with a red tint and a three finger head. This beer has a nice full flavor and body but without the harsh bitterness of other stouts I've tried. Has a very easy finish and is very drinkable. Definitely at the top of my stout list."
"D - This certainly has great flavor, and would be a good drinking beer as it is not too heavy. An overall smoothness with a tiny hop bite in comparison to Guinness. I wanted another when I finished, so that bodes well for more Stout and other Sierra Nevada beers."
"D- This is a very nice stout. It has loads of complexity and character. I will definitely do this one again."
"Pours black with creamy tan head that hangs around. Nice lacing on glass.Aroma is hoppy, roasted coffee and chocolate,maybe some caramel. Taste is much the same, bitter not sweet some dark fruit and floral hops help with the balance,a dry finish.Smooth creamy mouthfeel, very drinkable"
"D - very drinkable! Sierra Nevada wins me over with another one"
"Pours a solid black color with just a hint of dark brown on the edges, two fingers worth of dark tan foam and lovely sheets of lacing down the glass. Aroma has nice chocolate and coffee mix with a bittersweet background. Flavor is right on par with the nose. Chocolate malts is number one, followed by a nice roasted coffee flavor and some light herbal hops bringing up the finish. Very well balanced and flavorful. Creamy mouthfeel and on the lower end of full-bodied with moderate carbonation. At 5.8% alcohol, this one is a great stout to have a few of in one sitting. Very good and quite a treat on this cold night."
"D - 5 is the limit and 5 is what I give it. Excellent. The best overall everyday Stout made. PERIOD!!!"
"From notes. Pours black with brown edges and tan head. Rention is ok with tons of lacing. Smell: dark fruit, roasted and chocolatey malts, seems to be a hint of earthy hops in the background. Taste: leafy earthy hops, lots of roasted malt flavor, drying character about halfway through the sip. Mouthfeel: creamy and full bodied with big time puckering. One of the best examples of the style."
"Pours pretty dark with brown and ruby coming through the edges a lot. The nose and taste are upfront roasted malt. Wonderful, very wonderful. It also has a lot I chocolate appear after you swallow. The flavor continue to develop as it goes on. A slight bit of hops also come through. Spectacular stout to have from a gravity cask."
"The best American Stout I've tried. I'll be using this as a Guinness substitute."
"D: A really easy-to-drink stout that is easy-to-find as well. Another solid SN offering."
"The feel aids the drinkability. Its easy to drink, smooth yet maintains its stout-like charactor."
"Poured from the bottle into my session glass. The beer is dark, but when looked at in proper light has an caramel and orangish hue. The head dissipates very quickly to a light lace around the rim. The nose is sweet and fruity, some nutmeg and spiciness. The taste and mouthfeel are wonderful, first is nice subtle carbonation and hop, and spicy coffee notes, followed by a creamy, but not too heavy sweet honey. This is a wonderfully balance and drinkable stout. I can't believe that it took me this long to try this stout"
"Overall; a really good, solid stout."
"This turned out to be just about the most delicious and interesting stout I've had to date. I've always been a stouts and porters guy, but I think I've just found my new go-to stout, especially at the incredibly reasonable price of $8.50 a 6 pack. Overall completely awesome and worth a try to anyone and everyone."
"D-Very drinkable for a stout. A nice thin stout with a very complex flavor to boot. Session stout if there is such a thing."
"This one far exceeded my expectations, a dry stout with some character. Pours a thick black with an impressive head and nice lacing. Malty aroma, bitter with subtle chocolate and coffee notes. Medium fullness and creamy enough to score well but not great on the palate. Exceptional taste, well rounded flavor strong but not overpowering. Roasted malts, chocolate, and bitter coffee can be detected. Nice strong alcohol content. Good alternative to the other dry stouts commonly found."
"For my tastes definitely a sipping beer. That can be good or bad depending... but for the most part I'm sipping slowly not because I want to relish it, but because a whole mouthful is hard to get down. (That's not as bad as it sounds)"
"D - A very drinkable stout... Not to powerful, but still very much a statement... A truly sessionable stout..."
"D-Supurb I can't belive I waited this long to try it."
"Once it hits your mouth, it gives a good balance, not overwhelmingly malty or hoppy (personally I prefer it to have a bit more of a malt profile, but that's just me.) The malts come through the middle, and the hops are somewhat tempered by a creamy underlying, which I like, finishing as it slides down your throat. Not overwhelming, enjoyably drinkable."
"easy drinking beer just about what I expected from sierra nevada"
"mouth os oily and thick, moderately carbonated and drinks slow. very enjoyable"
"This is one of the first American Stouts I tried and I thought it was great at the time but now it just doesn't seem as great compared to some others."
"Pretty good drinkability. A good beer to have around."
"I bought this bottle at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee."
"D: An excellent beer, and a very well done and sessionble stout. Easily accessible and full flavoured."
"Overall: Standard American stout. I do like the style now and I still think this is a run of the mill version. That being said, it is a beer worth trying if you are new to the brew game."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a dark, opaque brown with a 1.5 inch dense, tan-colored cap. Good head retention with concentric bands of sticky lacing revealed as the brew is quaffed. Nose is chocolate malt and hops. Taste follows nose; hops bitterness is clearly pronounced as well as a charred character. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a mild carbonation burn expressed across the front of the tongue. Decent drinkability on this one, but lingering bitterness compromised the taste and drinkability for me."
"D. The drinkability is terrific. I could consider this a session Stout. A well balance of flavour and mouthfeel. I will be drinking this Stout for years to come. Highly recommended."
"D: Flavor is pretty good overall and this one is smooth and drinkable. What more can you ask for at this price point?"
"D - as far as stouts go, this one is nearing the top of the charts if I were judging."
"Poured the standard rich blackish color you would expect from a stout, and with a hefty head. This brew doesn't punch you in the face with that typical stout bite - it's got some character all its own. There is a certain mild sweetness in my opinion, which sort of sets it apart from other of the same style."
"Had this after the porter and it was slightly better but still not great, I liked the barrel aged version of this a lot more, does not stack up with SN's other brews in my opinion, probably will not drink again, might be worth trying if you are curious"
"Definitely recommended."
"D- great D for such a bold beer, its low abv would make it great to session in the depths of winter."
"D: Very good. Went down very easily."
"A great tasting beer, just not a great stout."
"D - I usually finish with a Stout, but I could pair this with more than dessert."
"i love the look of a good stout - opaque, black, big brown head, nice retention, lots of lacing. smells roasted, coffee beans, rum, some chocolate. Taste has all that and considerable bitterness. Some hop flavor emerges through. Dark chocolate and strong coffee comes to mind. I prefer less hops for the style but it's not bad by any means. Was a little put off at first when I sipped it straight out of the fridge but it gets better as it warms a bit. Medium bodied, some chewiness to the mouthfeel. Medium prickly carbonation. Drinks pretty nicely. I appreciate a non-imperial stout with the robustness of the bigger guys. My only complaint is the extensive hoppy bitterness but if you like that in the style you'll love this beer."
"Pours a wonderful rocky tan colored foamy head. The initial taste is a nice roasted malt that's not over powering. Just right amount of bitterness. Great mouthful, not to gummy and a clean aftertaste. Just right balance for a stout - highly recommended."
"Quite dark brew, with a big and pockmarked light tan head. Perfect-looking stout. The aroma is both aromatic hop leaf and estery alcohol on one hand, and bittersweet chocolate-roast grain and molasses on the other. Well balanced and impressively assertive with the sweet taking the lead. Mouthfeel is full enough to be right on style, everything is right there. Well done."
"HV"
"Drinkability> dang good stuff. I'd gladly have another."
"Notes: This is a good fall back stout to have in your fridge."
"A dark stout poured into a pub glass from a bottle. Great smell, a coffee type aroma. Seemed bitter at first, but after that, very smooth with the back taste of a bold coffee. Light carbonation leads this to be a great beer. I like this better than Guinness personally."
"Cheaper than many beers of the same quality..."
"D - This is a really good stout. One of the best mass produced stouts around."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied but not quite as full as I expect from a stout. Still very good and crisp. A very drinkable American stout."
"D- I could drink this for days and not get bored with it"
"D: yet another solid offering from Sierra Nevada, I swear they do not make a bad beer. This one feels bigger than it is but maybe this is because it is a bit late right now."
"D: This is a highly drinkable stout and fine beer."
"Poured into a pint glass. Dark black with good carbonation. Large foamy tan head, laces the glass well. The light can not see through even on the edges. The aroma is roasted coffee, bitter choclate, expresso beans, and raisins. The taste is all the scents rolled up and put on your tongue. There is a hop bitterness up front and in the finish. There is a slight drying effect from the brew. It sides more towards a sweet stout, IMO. The body is full and rich. A session stout that you could always have in your fridge."
"Yet another excellent beer from one of the best breweries out there in my opinion."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink if you want a regular stout that isn't going to try to knock you over."
"Don't know why I don't see this more often."
"Excellent stout, hardly a sipper, one easy to knock back but well worth savoring. Rich, delicious, and top shelf."
"My buddies brought this one over today, im a big fan of a lot of Sierra Nevada beers but once again the Stout disappoints me. It pours a dark brown, almost black color with a big brown head. Very malty nose with a bit of smoke and charcoal. It tastes pretty much the same way, very malty, smokey with a very dry bitter finish. The after taste is funky and stale tasting. Its mouth feel is its main down point, over carbonated and extra thick and grainy. I'd avoid this one, there are better domestic 'session' stouts out there."
"This is a good stout at a good price, and it's easy to find. Less sessionable than stouts from across Atlantic, but much moreso than a typical American example. Drinking 3-4 in a sitting would be reasonable, and the dryness encourages another sip."
"Taste: Well this has turned into one of my favorite stouts. The alcohol presence is perfect for this style and the hops seem better balanced with the malts than most stouts of this variety. One would expect sierra navada to drop a few more hops than usual."
"smooth, balanced, and easy to drink. nice and creamy, woth a slight bite to the finish. it is on the thicker end of medium bodied."
"Picked up a single to review, and it was not what I remembered, but better! I was very impressed by the strength of the piney hops, not overly bitter but sweet and tangy. I might pick up a sixer to see if this continues."
"Finish was dry and bitter and pleasant."
"D - Very drinkable with a strong roast character and a nice hop backbone. A classic example of the style."
"D & Notes: This is a ""West Coast"" twist on a stout, all the way! However, I really like this brew. It's not my favorite stout, but it is a very interesting interpretation of the style, with plenty of good flavors, and speaking of flavor, SN has proved that indeed, a stout can be both malty delicious but at the same time assertively hopped."
"D: For a stout, this one's fairly drinkable. It's got a lighter body than some other stouts and a relatively smooth flavor. It's not hard to get one down, for sure. With a more complex flavor profile I think it would be easier to enjoy a few of these in a row."
"D- Pretty good stout, I would say highly drinkable. It really isn't classified as any style of stout, but its a nice balance between coffee and chocolate. If you like stouts, I don't see how you could not like this one."
"MF&D - I found it to be fairly thin for a stout. Coats the mouth decently but leaves a very bitter aftertaste. Worth a try."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. This beer poured dark brown almost black with a thick cream foam tan/brown head approx 1 inch. The smell was a toasted malt smell with hints of coffee. Roasted malts all over the taste with hints of esprsso finishing bitter. The beer was thinner than I like my stouts. Still coated the mouth well leaving behind a sticky residue. Overall a good stout. Worth picking up if you see it."
"Thck motor oil feel. Leaves a milky film. Smooth despite its grand thickness. It's very bitter and very good. Harsh for many repeats but a beautiful blast of bitter."
"One of the more falvorful stouts; I'd love to try this against its Irish brethren."
"Note: Afterwards, I felt that the smell greatly outdid the taste. I anticipated far more taste from the rich smell, but if I could ignore the smells, the flavor would have done quite well. It was just a bit hard to judge the taste objectively after getting the initial whiff."
"Pours a jet black color with a tall and thick tan head that laces the glass alot all the way down the glass. The aroma is of very deep roasted malts, some chocolate, caramel, and a little hint of alcohol and yeast and hoppy bitter at the end of the nose. The taste is a big and bold roasted malty taste followed by chocolate, caramel, some coffee, and a very nice hoppy bitter aftertaste with the roasted barley bitternress. The mouthfeel is crisp yet smooth. The drinkability is very good for a stout and I really could drink a few of these."
"Excellent drinkability, delicious... another solid offering from Sierra Nevada."
"D: This is a highly drinkable stout and fine beer. I could drink many of these as it is a very balanced stout, and a delicious beer. This is definitely an after dinner beer though, its heavy, sweet, and quite tasty. Very nicely done!"
"This poured dark brown with a thick tan head. It had a nice mocha and malt scent. The flavor was strong chocolate with little to no bitterness. There was some coffee and malt, but no real hops. It was smooth but a bit thin and flat (no carbonation). Overall it was good and quite drinkable, but nothing great."
"I have ever had. There is a hop twinge, but I thought the malts were the dominant taste in this beer (as they should be). A slightly dry aftertaste finsihed it off, and this is the rare 4.5 drinkability beer for me in that is so smooth and tasty that I could just buy a six-pack and down the whole thing in one sitting."
"mid to full body. low carbonation. nice lace. i like it. i could do a session. will drink again. nice american stout."
"It's a very drinkable stout, and at 5.8% I could have a few at a time."
"Mouthfeel was nice and creamy yet dry to the tongue."
"God, I could drink a six pack of these in six minutes without will power to hold me back. Incredibly drinkable! YUM!"
"d - goes down so easily, the best session stout i've had to date."
"A new favorite of mine, and another stellar offering from a great west coast brewery. Put me back on my stout kick."
"Pours pretty much black with a very healthy off-white head. Rich Coffee and chocolate smell. Very smooth going done. This stout emphasis the best parts of what a stout should be. Good, rich flavor, smooth texture. Very drinkable. Definitely one of my favorites."
"Sierra Nevada Stout pours an opaque black with a nice creamy brown head. The aroma is roasty with some chocolate and just a bit of caramel. This is one delicious stout! Tons of roasted malt, nice hints of coffee and chocolate and just barley astringent. A caramel sweetness comes through perfectly to balance out the dark malts. I can't believe I've never had this beer before. I guess I just always looked past it since it was always there."
"This is a stellar stout. Highly recommended"
"A really really dark stout, has a bitter chocolate/coffee smell. The taste is a bitter rich smokey taste with a smooth finish. The color is dark black with a thick sudsy head of dark tan. The beer feels pleasant on the tongue and I would rate the beer highly drinkable."
"Excellent beer. Pours a dark black with a slight foamy tan head. Good amount of lacing left on the glass as you finish it. The smell is this stout's best characteristic--sweet chocolate, roasted barley, coffee--just beautiful. The taste is also slightly sweet, bitter, and very full-bodied. For a bitter stout, the mouthfeel is good and the drinkability is high. A great stout to drink all night long."
"This beer is interesting to say the least. The look and smell are top notch and the flavor is intriguing. There is a surprising amount of hop flavor and bitterness in the taste, which I liked, but the feel on the palate was a bit over carbonated for me. Overall, I found this to be an enjoyable drinking experience. I would look forward to another."
"D: ABV, flavor and body all make this a very drinkable stout. Definitely worth a try. A new standby for me."
" This would pair well with BBQ, Burgers, or any other grilled red meat. This isn't for the average beer drinker."
"Pours an excellent opaque black with a nice off-white head and good lacing. A nice scent, but a little weak, just a little aroma of malt and a tiny hint of burnt grains. Good taste, a very well done stout with slight coffee undertones with the usual burnt grain flavor, but the taste is not too strong. It has a slightly bitter aftertaste, as well. Goes down fine, just a little rough from what feels like carbonation, but not bad. It's not a great stout, but a good one."
"Camu"
"Pours brown but appears black in the glass. Bountiful foam above the black body. Caramel and black malt aroma, providing caramel, cocoa and coffee hints, along with a huge burst of aromatic cascadeFlavor, though roasty and coffee laden, is suprisingly hop accented, with a citrusy and extremely bitter blend. I prefer decadent malt in stouts, not hop madness."
"D: YES!!! Very drinkable and has moved in as one of my favorite stouts. Highly recommend."
"SN likes to put lots of hops in there darker beers. It worked with the porter, but I do not enjoy it here. I am not a fan of this beer."
"D - Highly drinkable, nice for a session. Satisfied fully with my meal. So far SN has yet to disappoint, recommended."
"T: Very good, I've had this beer before out of the bottle, and it is sort of ho-hum, but on-tap it really shines, very tasty stuff, easily drinkable, I want another one, but I've got to drive home on the 22, and I haven't any money."
"A very good stout that doesn't stick out in any way. Still, a very well crafted beer which i will most likely try again."
"D - Am a bigger fan of imperial stouts, but this one is fairly dirnkable."
"Poured six of these (not in one sitting) into various glasses (none plastic). I'm on the last one, and I must say that while my decreasing appreciation for stout, because of double stouts and RIS--my favorite--I have been very impressed by this beer. Very little sweetness, good complexity, they got the carbonation right. This is really a worthy beer, and because of the relatively low alcohol compared to RIS/2x's, it's a great beer for when you don't want to feel the alcohol. Neither was I blown away."
"Another terriffic offering from SN. Pours dark, it looks black but when held to the light its probably the darkest mahogany you've ever seen. Nice two-finger, rocky, cream-colored head. Great retention and excellent lacing. Smell has almost a chocolate milk kind of sense to it. Muted chocolate and what seems to be a touch of grassy hops or grain. Taste is exceptional. Deep, dark and rich. Hints of chocolate, cocoa, touch of coffee, roasted grain, its got it all. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, leaves a slightly oily feel but not too overpowering. This is a great beer and an excellent stout. The reasonable ABV makes it drinkable and is best enjoyed a little bit warmer."
"Poured a pitch black color with touches of brown at the bottom of the glass. A small caramel colored head forms, but quickly dissolves away. The sweet scent of malt, chocolate, and coffee stirke the nose at first scent. Then it finshes with a grassy, pine fragrance. The taste of chocolate and coffee are strong at the start and dominate the majority of the flavor. Till each taste reaches midaway on the palate, that is when a mild bitterness begins to grow. That bitterness is of mild citrus, but most grass and earthy flavors, lasting till the end. The feel is smooth, slick, like thin oil, that is almost lost on the stong bubbling sensation of carbonation at the end. It still finishes dry and that felling stays on the palate for some time. This is a solid stout, all the wat around to the flavor and aroma, the feel at little less. But, overall this beer is great on a cold winters day."
"Drinkablity: Satisfying, yet simple stout. Very well crafted."
"It is a drinkable, very good stout. It doesn't wow me, but it doesn't dissapoint."
"D: This is a great example of the style. Wish it had a bit less ABV but something I would have more of if presented with the opportunity."
"A nice stout: typical stout flavors with a splash of citrus hops. Not the cure for my broken glass, sadly."
"There is a bit of a hoppy splash at the end with a strong coating of the coffee flavor. The bitterness persists for a while and leaves a smooth aftertaste."
"enjoyable brew"
"British or Scandanavian practice. Tasty."
"Compared to many other stouts that I've sampled, this wasn't the best, although it was certainly worth a try... compared to some other Sierra Nevada brews which were exceptional, this was more on the average side, although a good brew nonetheless... appearance was jet-black, with a modest frothy, tan head that quickly dissipated... Smell was full of cocoa and dark espresso... taste was rich, full of dark, burnt chocolate and the typical stout flavors... more bitter than I hoped and anticipated, so taste wasn't over-the-top... not a bad stab at the style, but not my favorite rendition either... all of Sierra Nevada brews are good, but this one was on the weaker side of the scale... Worth a try if you're a fan of the style, but there are better examples out there..."
"Bottle smell is semi-sweet chocolate with notable hops. Poured into my trusty chalice to a dark black with no light coming through at all. Upon tasting the carbonation seems a little high but the flavors come through with a strong cocoa beginning followed by a smooth bitterness and a bittersweet crisp finish. This is a very delicious brew, another fine selection by Sierra Nevada who never dissapoints."
"Pours very dark brown that lets light through and it has a massive head off a firm pour. Flavor is smooth and malty with no real unusual characteristics. Just nice and consistent and fairly robust to match. Nice liquid feel and the carbonation is a bit low, but good still. Overall a good drink. Smooth and easy and nothing wild or crazy at all. Won't be the most exciting stout you have ever had."
"Another good beer from Sierra Nevada!"
"That was a good one. I like a stout that isn't afraid to show off some hoppiness."
"Could spend a wonderful session with this one."
"D: A knockout. A highly drinkable stout that will leave you wanting more."
"The mouthfeel is slightly over carbonated and thin but has good smoothness."
"Poured a 12 oz beer into a Boulevard Goblet. Poured a nice dark brown with ruby highlights when the light hits it, also had speckels of yeast at the bottom of the glass. Had a large tan head with pretty good retention. Left a slight lacing down the glass. Aroma is sweet chocolate and roasted malts. Taste is dark chocolate with a bit of hops at the tail of the beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, nice and smooth. This is a very drinkable stout."
"D - This is one easy to drink stout smooth and delicious"
"The flavor throws a slight curveball: gone are the sweetened chocolates in the aroma, and instead the chocolate flavors are more like that of bitter, dark chocolate with some roasted malts to it. A smoked, earthy hop bite finishes off the flavor. Mouthfeel achieves perfection: medium body (not too thick or syrupy), carbonation level that's spot on, crisp finish, and a lingering bitter cocoa & hop aftertaste that stretches on for miles. The drinkability is quite high as well, this beer is refreshing as hell for a stout. Not only that, but its complexity and tastiness make for quite a memorable brew that I'll be sure to enjoy again."
"Smooth and highly drinkable. Tasty distinctly west coast stout."
"I bought this because I realized I had not had one in probably six to eight years. Solid black color with a excellent coffee colored head. Smells roasty, chocolate. More chocolate in the flavor and easy to drink. I have yet to find a Sierra Nevada beer that I don't like. Excellent."
"D - I could easily down a six of this. Good drinking stout..enjoyable"
"Overall this is another fine work of art from Sierra Nevada, definitely worth a try"
"D: I had to give this straight 4's, I could drink this anytime with anything and I would be happy. It just doesn't stand out from the other Stouts I have tried. Although, I was impressed with the carbonation, I was expecting a ton of bubbles since it's American in origin. I was happily wrong. A very good Stout."
"The Stout is definitely one of the best that I have had. Sierra does an excellent job of making clean tasting beer with flavor -- the stout is no different."
"d: nice and creamy but a little bit too unbalanced in terms of burnt bitter flavors; still good but not the well-balanced beer I would expect from Sierra Nevada"
"This beer poured a dark opaque brown with a large foamy head that lingered for a while. The smell is reminiscent of pine and roasted malts. The taste is not as strong as I expected, with a sweeter almost chocolate middle that ends with just a little bit of hops bite. There is a satisfyingly thick mouthfeel, with a nice bit of carbonation. I'd consider this beer to be fairly drinkable, but I couldn't imagine knocking too many of them back in one sitting."
"this is one of the first real beers I ever tried. About 15 years ago. I know my palate has matured, but I remembered it tasting much much better. Dark, with a tan head. Pretty lame retention, but nice lace. Smelled ok with a nice piney hop character and roasty malt. Tasted the same as nose. Well blended, not too bitter and very clean. Lighter side of full body and could be much silkier. Carbonation carries it well with a nice warming finish. Very very easy drink. Low abv makes it a great session stout. Props to the pioneers SN."
"It is also widely sold. And living where I do, in a beer wasteland, something being easier to get means a lot."
"After drinking cases and cases of their pale ale over the years, this is my first attempt at the Stout. It was a beautiful opal color with a tiny foam head that dissipates quickly. The smell is a lovely roasted maltiness with a soft alcohol overtone. The taste was smooth and it was a great balance between the roasted malts and a little hops on the finish. It is nice an chewy in the mouth and leaves some good chocolate in the palate. I would consider this a money stout."
"Good balanced beer. Not really your typical stout if that's what you're looking for but a good beer on it's own merits."
"Final Statement: A very good stout, not my favourite, but I would never turn this down."
"One of SN's best offerings."
"D- This is a fairly drinkable stout. The hop presence brings the drinkability down a tad but definitely a solid brew."
"Taste is bitter, split up in a great hop bitterness, which is a bit resinous and earthy, and a malt bitterness of the roasted barley. The dark malts give great coffee, chocolate and liquorice notes. Body is pretty big for it's ABV, but it is always wonderful to have a beer with relative low alcohol and enormous taste. I wonder if there is any flaked barley in this beer, somewhere in the back I get a little oily taste, and body is full."
"I like this beer also,it ranks up there with there porter,as far as dark beers stand.I could drink this day in and day out.I heard this beer was tasty and damn it is tasty.Very tasty"
"Sierra Nevada has done it again. Their American stout is just as fitting to the style as it can be. Sweet, bitter, smooth and satisfying. I can't wait to review their Porter, just to taste the subtle differences."
"A really great stout. It's jet black and lets no light through it at all, and has a tan head that sticks around nicely. The taste is exactly what a stout should taste like. Thick, heavy, creamy, tons and tons of roasted barley, and just enough hops to balance it all out. Great brew from a great brewery; I can't think of an American stout I've enjoyed more."
"After trying this and the porter I'd love to get my hands on some Big Foot & Celebration. Anyone?"
"D - very easy drinking brew, not too heavy and it tastes good."
"D- Drinks well, but I was hoping for a more traditional stout."
"Surprisingly nice! It certainly has a significant hop character to it, as one would expect from Sierra Nevada. But you could certainly do worse, and I just might go back to this sometime in the future. Impressive!"
"D: This is fairly carbonated, so a lot of burping was involved in drinking it. I would say, for a stout, this is very drinkable."
"The taste has some sweet malt initially but more flavours come into play. Roasted malt follows with a very small hot chocolate presence...well, it's not so small after all as it's giving a good bitter kick to this stout about midway through and it dominates the finish very nicely but that sweet malty goodness lasts right through from the start to the finish. Man, it's hitting my taste buds on all cylinders and I'm reallly enjoying sipping on this excellent version of an American Stout and..the lowish abv helps make it a very drinkable brew. As far as I'm concerned, this is a classic American Stout and if you've overlooked this one before, give it a shot and I don't think you'll regret it. Highly recommended!"
"12oz brown screwtop bottle from RSVP in Portland. Completely opaque black body with a half inch of light tan head. Chocolate and coffee malts balance citrus hops in the aroma. Roasted and burnt malts share the flavor with citrussy piney American hops. Roastiness lingers even after the finish. Thick full mouthfeel does not hurt the drinkability. A pretty darn solid stout."
"D- a solid stout, well worth the purchase"
"drinkability - pretty good stout, I'm starting to like Sierra Nevada"
"Pours black with creamy tan head that hangs around. Nice lacing on glass. Nice roasted coffee and chocolate aroma. Taste is much the same, bitter not sweet. Very good. Nice lacing on glass. This is a good beer. Really good mouthfeel, I would recommend this."
"A very nice smooth example of a stout, if a little thin. Very enjoyable."
"I always love a well made session strength stout or porter, and this is another fine example. Reminds me of local favourite Paddock Wood Bete Noire. Excellent."
"Overall, this is the definition of a sessionable stout. Hugely balanced with great flavors, you'll want it in your fridge all the time."
"Even before I get a chance to pour I smell hops from the bottle. As I pour a thin tan colored head settles onto a black oil colored beer. The first sniff from the glass reveals more hops with a burnt malt background. Further investigation reveals hints of chocolate. Tastes exactly as it smells. Roasted malts give away to spicy hops that touch the sides and tip of my tongue. With some effort the chocolate flavor can be found. Its a well carbonated drink that enhances the hop flavours rather than get in the way of what the beer is trying to accomplish. A light mouthfeel and very drinkable stout. I prefer more of a coffee and chocolate emphasis in a stout rather than the aboundance of hops here, but this is often found in my fridge and if I'm looking for chocolate I'll look towards Brooklyn or Young's Breweries."
"Drinkability: very good.... I like it.... I will share it and buy this again."
"Pours black with crimson flecks. Huge, rocky tan head retains very well; medium to thick lacing. Aroma is sudsy and deep with chocolate, toffee sweetness, and light roast. Mouthfeel is tingly and silky; medium body. Flavor is a nice balance of sweet dark caramel, kola, and mocha with roasted barley / grassy sourness and some hop spice in the back. Dark roast coffee in finish. Aftertaste is herbal, bitter, and dry."
"stout is a good name for this beer that it is. pours thick and is almost black in appearance. has a nice thick creamy head that retains well and sticks to the side of the glass.so thick you could almost chew it.nice taste of roasted malts and chocolate.dont start your lite beer drinking freinds out on this one.this is one i will drink again."
"If the rain doesn't stop soon (16 straight days, thank you), you'll see me on the news sitting on my roof finishing what's left of this six pack. Not a bad way to go if you ask me."
"A very enjoyable stout. No dissappointments here."
"Very deep brown, almost black - typical good stout color - with a nice tan head. Aroma is rich and stouty with a strong overtone of burnt coffee. Flavor is rich and very pleasing, has a smoky overtone, hints of coffee and molasses. It feels thick the way a stout should, and is very smooth with minimal bitterness."
"Very full bodied and mouth feel complex and nice tastes all around very drinkable stout with nice hop balance"
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a near jet black color, just ever so mild brown highlights on the edges of the glass. Beautiful two inches of tan foam on top that stays fluffy for nearly a half-hour. Possibly the best looking beer I've ever seen. Nose is strong on roasted malt, some coffee hints and a little chocolate. Taste is likewise delicious; lots of roasted malt, some sweet mocha flavor. Touches of lemon. Mouth is thick and creamy, solid carbonation. This one is really excellent. Feel and look are most amazing. Possibly second only to SN's Celebration Ale, which I love as well. Alcohol might be a touch high, but this one might just be sessionable anyway."
"D- This is a very drinkable and enjoyable stout. I will have it again."
"Drinkability - This brewhaha kicked some major butt and lived up to it's high regard. I'm definetly going to be trying some more great American Stouts (and their porter cousins) which I guess my increasingly defined palate is appreciating as much if not more than their in your face RIS brothers. Finally a note on Sierra Nevada, these guys fricken rule! In the past week I've had Bigfoot and this brew and been blow away by both. Is there a more complete brewery pairing these 2 with classic Pale Ale and Celebration ale? I forsee SN Porter in the near future."
"An exceptional stout given the price and availability. Sierra Nevada scores again. Not incredibly complex, but it doesn't need to be. An easy drinking, kick back and relax stout."
"D- an easy dinking stout that I could have often. Nothing is overpowering here every flavor is balanced."
"Drinkability: I can easily put down 2 or 3 of these with out feeling too full or ready to kill over. This is a good alternative if I don't feel like going for the big brother imperial stouts."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, almost pitch dark. Aroma has hints of roasted malt and chocolate. Taste has hints of coffee/chocolate with a smooth aftertaste that's almost creamy. Just a hint of bitterness but not much else to complain about. Drinkable too."
"D: This is a good example of a complex stout without the high ABV. Tons of flavor and not overpowering in any catagory. Recommended."
"Drinkability...I'd rate this a 10 if I could. Quite easy to drink. I don't know if I was really expecting this good a stout from the brewer I view as the pre-eminent Pale Ale and Barleywine brewer. Guess I'll have to add American Stout to that listing. Does SN do *anything* badly?"
"Very drinkable session stout."
"D- A winner that does not get enough credit in group dominated by the Irish-style stout. Great taste and does not hit you over the head with a high ABV."
"This is a pretty good one."
"D: Highly drinkable, I could see this becoming someones go to sout. A nice alternative for me however as I already have my favorite. All and all a great offering from sierra nevada."
"All in all its a good stout that if you like coffee flavors is an outstanding stout. I have to rate it on my personal tastes along with the style type. I would prefer a stout with less prominent coffee flavors, but this is an extremely well made brew and maybe it was just the coffee that stood out to ME and wouldnt to someone else."
"This is a really clean stout. Sierra Nevada really let's the grains shine here and they do. If you love black barley and chocolate grains, this beer is for you. It's a bit like coffee with a little cocoa, but then there's a lot of flavors that can only be attributed to beer. Overall, I can't think of better clean American stout."
"Drinkability: A really nice flavorful stout; at first, I was not sure what to make of it as the flavor profile is so unusual"
"D - I'm upset I only bought a single, but a 6-pack's coming soon. For having such a full-body, it's crazy drinkable. It's heavy on the flavor but not in the stomach. That head still hasn't receded and it's as creamy as it was from the pour into the pint glass. Sierra Nevada sure knows how to brew consistent and balanced beers. This Stout is exactly the way I love a Stout to be."
"This is an exemplary beer. The rich, roasted dark chocolate flavors, complimented by dark fruits, coffee, and caramel, are offset just right by a sturdy but never overwhelming hop presence. SN really nailed the balance in this beer, keeping it complex and interesting throughout. The mouthfeel is a tiny bit on the thin side, but other than that this beer is magnificent. I've found my new favorite American stout. Highly recommended."
"Awesome drinkability. This is one of those beers that can really encourage a 'newbie' to like good beer. It has real malt flavors, not excessively bitter, and goes down incredibly easily. An overall winner"
"One to try for sure."
"D - The drinkability is very good. This tasted more like a porter than a stout but is still a good session beer."
"A decent stout but nothing out of the ordinary."
"This stout pours a jet black into my glass with a deep tan head, that lasts and lasts. The aroma is moderate-high on roasted malts, there is also medium-low caramel sweetness and a hint of diacetyl. The taste is initially rather roasted, followed by a low amount of caramel sweetness and finally a moderate hop bitterness and low hop flavor dominate the swallow. The after taste is initially the hop bitterness/flavor, but is then replaced by a residual roasted grain taste, which is slightly dry. The beer has medium carbonation, a full body, and is rather smooth. Overall I thought this stout was well done. I enjoy the solid hop bitterness at the finish, along with the simplicity of the beer. There are not competing flavors, mainly roast flavors and hop bitterness/hop flavor at the swallow. I will buy this again and recommend it to others."
"This beer poured a black color with a big cram color head. The smell is sour and slightly sweet. The taste is bitter with notes of coffee and some sweetness. The mouthfeel is very full, but shy of chewy. This is a very nice stout that goes down fairly smooth.I think quite drinkable."
"Needless to say this beer is very good and I highly recommend you try it."
"A very good american stout. Lots of big bold flavours"
"Heavy hops again in the taste although they do give way to decent caramel, coffee, and roasted flavors at the end of the sip. aftertaste is understandably well balanced. Mouthfeel is a little thin for a stout but certainly not lacking as far as the taste or hop presence. This is a really good beer but probably not among my top choices when reaching for a stout as I'll probably go with something thicker and more traditional. Still, tasty, innovative, and very worthwhile."
"D- This is a stout? To me this was very much like a porter. I am not complaining- call it what you want, this would make a great session beer."
"Eric"
"Overall, an interesting beer of the style. Not something I would go out of my way to have again as I prefer less hoppy stouts. But decent for the style."
"This is definitely a very drinkable brew. A good straight up stout for any occasion."
"A surprisingly good stout. The hops meet the coffee and make for an excellent beer. It isn' quite as dark as I prefer but just about thick enough. Luckily, the bizarro grocery store near my house keeps a steady supply of this stuff. This is and the brown ale are my favorites from Sierra Nevada."
"D: A very nice example of American brewing and stout brewing alike I highly recommend it; It is very easy going down."
"Goes down really easy and really delicious. As far as a straight-forward easy-drinkin' stout goes, this is pretty top-notch in my book!"
"This stout gives off the malty aroma, primarily a coffee/biscuity fragrance. It tastes a little like caramel and biscuits mixed together. Not as tart as Guinness Extra Stout. This brew is a little chewy, and finishes a bit dry."
"It's that Sierra Nevada thing, it's good, and I always enjoy their beers, but I often times pass them by and I don't know why. I'll have to remember to pause a little more often by their bottles."
"T/M/D- One of the most hoppy stouts that I have experienced(this was before I drank storm king). Coffee and chocolate create the back bone of this beer. Very roasty and toasty. I would imagine it is very good with spicy foods....Bitter hoppy dark chocolate finish. Moderate carbonation, long lasting finish, and the hops help to lighten the feel of this heavy beer."
"D - Very nice taste to this beer setting it apart from the others."
"A fantastic stout, its cold and snowy in Ohio right now, I couldn't think of another beer I'd rather be drinking right now."
"Alcohol is well-hidden. Easy to drink with a rich, complex body. An American stout with influence from a traditional English stout. This is a wonderful brew."
"This is my idea of what a stout should be! Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a dark brown, almost black, forming a thick 1 inch head, leaving medium lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly roasted malt, with a little coffee. The taste is roasted malt, coffee, and a slight chocolate towards the end. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth. This is a great stout, and an easy one to session. Highly recommended!"
"A nice flavor stout, roasty and clean. Could be a little smoother, which would improve both flavor and mouthfeel."
"Sierra Nevada Stout pours jet black, with the slightest white lacing. Aroma was of powdered cocoa, slight lactate, and a bit of coffee. Taste had lots of bittering chocolate notes, and more of the coffee as well. Mouthfeel was pretty big, definitely one to sip and enjoy slowly. Excellent drinkability on this one, great for a cold day. In my opinion this is one of the classic Stout examples. As with all Sierra Nevada beers, this one holds true against most other Stouts. Really well done."
"drinkability is great. well balanced and very tasty. a great stout."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan frothy head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The beer smells like coffee and chocolate, but the aroma isn't strong. Luckily the taste is much stronger than the aroma of the beer is. It tastes like coffee, roasted malt and some chocolate. The coffee aftertaste is good and bitter. Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, and creamy. Drinkability is good, it's nice, smooth and dry. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, a good choice as a session beer."
"A great sipping stout for those long winter sessions."
"A fair sized head would sprout up just before the end of the pour, level off and stay put. Leaves behind thick lacing. Black body. Subtle and pleasing aroma, gentle coffee and chocolat notes. Immensely rich mouthfeel, the gentle notes of coffee and chocolat in the aroma are intensified quite a bit. Much bolder with a medium roastness and filling body. A very well made stout and like many of the other Sierra Nevada products there is little (where any) room for improvement with this one."
"an absolute classic example of a middle-of-the-road stout! nothing showy here, nothing extreme, and at the same time nothing is missing, nothing tastes sub par. the smell, taste, and mouthfeel are all velvety smooth. roasted barley dominates, with coffee notes and cocoa powder flavors lingering in the mouth, and everything finishing very crisply. the beer goes down very quickly -- nothing brash or challenging. i could drink huge quantities of this, anytime, anywhere!"
"Tasty stout. Not too strong, not light. Just what the doctor ordered today."
"Kind of rough and raw. Not my first choice for a stout."
"Drinkability is good here. While there is a bit much sugary malt, the bitterness seems to quash it and make this a great beer."
"Man, Sierra Nevada just knows what they're doing. Everyone of their beers I've tried is great, and extremely drinkable. This one is an excellent example of a stout. Nice carbonation and nice head, but very smooth. Very good creamy chocolate flavor, and a subtle aftertaste like roasted coffee. Great beer and great value, and you can find it anywhere. This is one of those beers where a six pack just isn't enough."
"A very drinkable American Stout that would make for a good session."
"A very nice American stout. I was expecting a little more because of the reviews, but still it was very good. I will definetley get a six pack of this as it starts to cool down. I reccomened that you go out and try one. I am excited to try the porter. GO RIGHT NOW!"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth, very nice. Drinkability rates high. This is good standby stout, not ""best of show"", but once of the better Americans out there."
"Jet black with a high, thick toast-colored head. Looks like a fine espresso. The aromas at colder temperatures are a bit tight with one dimensional Cascade hops, but as this beer warms up more elements come out: dark chocolates, malted milk and roasted malts. On the tongue, this beer is all about the interplay of fruity Cascade hops and dark-and-dry malts. Bright bitterness grips the tongue first, with the dark malt flavors providing a base for the mid-palate. The hops fade out a bit toward the end, being replaced by chocolate notes, before snapping back on the finish, with is very long and deep, with perfect dryness. This is a substantial beer but doesn't feel all that big to the mouth, in spite of the heavy carbonation. All in all, this is a wonderful beer, a superb example of an American stout, with all the hallmark elements meshing together effortlessly. One of the best in Sierra Nevada's lineup."
"Drinkability - an excellent beer, and very sessionable."
"D - A great easy drinking stout."
"Medium-bodied and very smooth and creamy, though a little of a dry finish. Much more mellow than the RIS's and double stouts I've been drinking lately, a nice change."
"The pour into my Sam Smith pint raises a respectable two finger tan head that leaves sudsy lacing. Retention is excellent - half a finger to the very bottom! The beer's body is not nearly opaque when backlit - it lets through a healthy ruby glow. The nose is heavily roasted and caramelly. Rich, too. Taste is roasty, sweet to start, and heavily hopped, as I guess should be expected. There also seems to be a sizeable portion of smoked malt. The taste picks up some chocolate as it warms. Still, despite the intensity of the flavors, everything fits well together. The mouth is very full, and the carbonation has some kick, too. Overall, a very nice stout that I could drink all day."
"Pours a dark brownish black color with a creamy light tan head. Aroma is filled with dark roasted malt, a bit of chocolate and some bitterness and hops in the background as well. Taste is bitter with an almost burnt roasted maltiness, coffee and a good dose of hops. Overall, this is a really solid stout and another good offering from Sierra Nevada."
"A fine looking stout, and I'm not just saying that because I like SNPA and love SNCA. Deep black body with a rather frothy top to it. The smell is a bit of roasted barley or dry bakers chocolate. The taste is more of the same. The taste isn't overpowering by any strech of the imagination, but it is pleasant. Mouthfeel is smooth and lightly carbonated. Drinkability is above average."
"Drinkability--quite nice, I'm not a big fan of the stouts, but I could make a night of drinking these."
"I would say this brew is pretty drinkable despite it being classified as a heavy beer."
"Drinkability: A nice mix of quality , taste , and afordability makes this a constant winner."
"I'd recommend this stout to anyone."
"Ahh, a nice full bodied beer. Not only is this beer thick on the palate, but it is also creamy. That was my frist impression when I took the first sip of this beer, the creamy head touching my lips and then the beer flowing into my mouth to caress my tongue and oral cavities. This beer is easy to drink, and would make an excellent session beer but for the high abv. It seems as though this beer is appropriate for any season of the year, though I know I will probably never buy any stout in the summer. Definitely good for fall, winter, and early spring though. I will most likely buy this beer again, it is a good standard for stouts, not the best but a definite good buy."
"This is a very easy drinking stout, with its smooth yet complex and balanced flavor. It also has a relatively low %ABV, which almost makes it a good session drink. Fill your fridge with these so you always have a good supply of SN Stout, and so your wife has no place to put the leftovers from her cooking."
"DA: A very easy to drink stout."
"A very good stout, and a very good example of the no-nonsense style of the classic stout. Rich and flavorful, but not overpowering. Recommended for sure."
"pours very dark almost black with half inch brown head. very light smell, taste caramel coffee nut slightly sweet. good hop malt mix not overly carbonated nice medium smooth mouth feel. very enjoyable beer definitely on the buy list. nice beer to have if your having more than a few."
"D - Great as a session beer, doesnt fatigue the palate at all."
"Served in a pint glass, chilled. Poured a nice dark brown , almost black, with a brown half inch head. Nice burnt smokey chocolate aroma. Had a slight taste of chocolate and very slight taste of roasted coffee beans. Was nice and balanced in the mouth with a little bit of a bitter ending. This one's a keeper."
"Dark rich brown color with a tan creamy head that last the whole beer and leaves a nice lacing. Well balanced Coffee and Mocha flavors with a nice lingering bitterness. Creamy, smooth feel with not too much carbination. As for drinkability this is my favorite session beer i could drink it all day long, it always leaves me wanting another."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It doesnt have the ABV that I usually equate with a stout, in fact I think this brew is more of a porter, but its a very nice ale just the same. I would certainly have it again, especially in the winter months."
"D: It's easy to drink, but as stouts go, this was a dud for me. It's not very stout, and I found the porter to be the superior beer of the two. I'll revisit it in a few months, but I won't be counting down the days until I do. I found this to be a really bland beer."
"D - One of the most drinkable dark beers I have ever tasted. I could knock back 6 of these, easily."
"My entire perception of SN has been, to this point, based on (negative) experiences with the flagship pale ale in my earlier drinking days. However, a beer this good isn't an accident & will have me going back to revisit the rest of the Sierra Nevada line."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- y"
"I'm glad this is offered year 'round."
"Overall I really like this, but it seems strange and distracting IMO to have such a hop-forward green flavor in a stout. I could drink another one of these later (I'd really like to try one with a big juicy steak!), but two in a row might be too much black coffee bitterness for me."
"Sierra Nevada Stout pours jet black with oddly enough an off white head (I would expect a tan color). Aroma is bittersweet chocolate. Starts out with some bittersweet chocolate flavors which kind of diminish in favor of a strong hoppy flavor, then the bittersweet chocolate finishes it up. Nice thick mouthfeel. An enjoyable beer that I will have to drink a little more often. Recommended."
"SN Stout is a piece of art. There's not much that could make this beer better, and I could easily consume this as an everyday stout. A fine beer that I highly recommend for the style."
" It's very rich, thick and creamy, quite heavy body compared to ""classic"" Irish dry. Not something I would drink many of at one sitting but quite good drinking."
"Pours dark brown with red highlights. Creamy tan head. Aroma is chocolate and sweet malts. Flavor is roasted malts, hop flavors and hop bitterness. Medium mouthfeel, it was lighter bodoed than I expected. It seems too hoppy for a stout, but what else would you expect from Sierra Nevada. This isn't one of my favorites, but its worth trying."
"Overall it's a really nice stout. My only complaint is that it is a bit too bitter for my tastes (I enjoy the citrusy/hoppy bitterness in pale ales and such, but not this strong when it's in a stout). But if you enjoy stouts, certainly give this a try."
"One of my all-time favorite stouts...often overlooked, it's a shame I don't drink this more often."
"Pours opaque black with a thick light tan rocky head that dissipates slowly. Mild aroma of roasted malt with espresso notes. A light herbal hop presence is also noticable in the nose. Taste is major dark roasted malt with notes of coffee and chocolate. Hops are also present- herbal and citrusy. Very nicely balanced. Full bodied mouthfeel with moderate cabonation. A good and extremely drinkable brew. Very solid stout."
"Black Body hosts a massive 3 inch head as a result of a vigorous pour, leaving a lot of lace as it fades. Very zesty cola like malt feel on the nose is almost nutty. Very smooth and very sweet as it enters the mouth. Almost syrupy, like maltieness. A hint of black liqorce. Finishes realatively cleanly for a stout, not nearly as bitter as many others. Very drinkable. A six pack is in order I do believe."
"This beer is excelelnt overall."
"Pours nearly black in color with a ½ tan head that quickly dissipated. Had good lacing. Smell was of roasted malts, dark chocolate and some hops. Tasted of roasted chocolate malts and coffee with some bitterness. Had a nice mouthfeel, was medium bodied and didnt have too much carbonation. Very drinkable, a great example of an American Stout."
"Pours a effervescent black with tanned leather highlights. Head goes from a two finger head to a thinning foam with each sip. The aroma is muted, bitter coffee malts. Flavor is a sparky roasted mlat and brunt coffe bitterness mixed with bready hop resins."
"Very dark in color but just a hint above being black. Nice, tight tan head. Mellow roasted aroma-somewhat espresso like. Perfect roasted and bitter flavor. The balance between the 2 is great. Nice grainy flavor in there as well. Finishes a bit dry. Very nice full body. Another top notch beer from SN. With this and the porter I could be happy forever."
"Pours black. Thin tan head, with decent retention and a great amount of lace. Aroma is roasted, with a hint of chocolate. Body is medium with a hint of carbonation. Taste is nicely bittered. Almost reminds me of a good pale ale, but yet different, because of the roasted flavor. Good stuff."
"Thanks Len!"
"Drinkability - Interesting flavor, but I don't find these stouts too drinkable. Its worth an occasional try, but its too bitter, and the taste is too flat for my liking. If you want a style to enjoy casually with friends, you should try a Brown Ale or an Oktoberfest.."
"D - another fine brew from SN. Damn, I need to buy this more often."
"Drink ability is hampered only by the bad finish quite possibly the most important part of the beer experience. I have had much better. MK"
"This is one of the better stouts I've had. The clean finish makes this stout a good session beer."
"Another winner from Sierra Nevada!"
"A really nice American stout."
"Pours a midnight black under a thick, rocky oatmeal head that fades to a long-lasting skim. Nose is quite hoppy for a stout, almost minty with a heavy dose of cocoa powder. Taste is bitter roasted malt up front with the minty hops, coffee grounds and cocoa powder. Mouthfeel is creamy but not too rich. This is VERY similar to their porter which was also heavy on the minty hops and cocoa. Just a very well put-together stout. For what it is, it's almost flawless. I'm a sucker for hoppy dark beers. Parallels to Alpha Klaus as well, without the ridiculous overpricing."
"I've enjoyed SNPA and their porter. Their stout is just as good as both their porter and pale ale."
"I haven't had this beer in over a year and now I'm wondering why the hell I haven't. Being in the beer desert that is Iowa for the next few months, I'm sure I'll be drinking quite a bit of this. This is a very complex beer for the relatively low abv. Makes me wish SN would try their hand at an RIS. All around, a very solid beer that is certainly now a regular for me. Right up there with Bigfoot and Celebration in my book."
"Overall, this is an excellent brew, and an excellent stout as well. Very sessionable, very smooth, very tasty. I will certainly buy this again, and probably even again and again. Another top-notch offering from Sierra Nevada. Seriously...those guys are on the ball."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with a sweetness that lingers around caramel and bitter chocolate with a mild piney hop buried in the background."
"Overall, I enjoyed this one, but without the chocolate or coffee, i found it lacking just a bit. Due to the low ABV, it'd make a great sharing brew."
"Still, a very good beer, and one to definately try."
"D- amazing flavors in there, wonderful mouthfeel, i think i found a favorite. I could dream about htis stout. Amazing"
"Very drinkable. A nice down to earth ABV."
"A solid hoppy stout."
"Aged one year: Aroma decreases to mostly just roasted malts, less intense, still slight sour note. Taste is the smoothest, almost all malt comparatively, still the slightest harsh roasted note way at the end where the hops were, so it's a bit more porter-like now, also yeasty in a good way. Mouthfeel is creamy, velvety smooth, perfect weight on the tongue, neither heavy nor watery, hence exceptionally drinkable, I conclude that I prefer it fresh but ages pretty well, and a few months at cellar (even slightly warmer) tempts was exceptional, when the hops tame a bit without disappearing as much as like they have here, but is a tad smoother than totally fresh."
"D - moderate to high, high for those who enjoy a good stout, toherwise it may be too bitter"
"I pretty much knew what I was getting into with this brew: a solid stout with a bit more hop kick than normal. So it goes without saying that it's a proper stout black color. I didn't pour all that well so I can't knock it for head, but when I swirled the glass I got a nice foam out of it which settled to a decent sheet. Smell is a comforting, familiar malt/black malt roastiness, reminds me of Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout without the winey aromas. Great mouthfeel, smooth and medium-bodied with just the right about of carbonation. Taste starts with sweet malts, then turns to black malt/molasses, but just when I should be catching some roasted malt astringency the west coast hops kick it to the curb. That hop bitterness sticks all over my palate for a long time afterward, making me hesitant to take another sip. I must admit I'm a malt fan, not a hop fan. I wouldn't buy this again, but if a hoppy stout is your thing, go for it."
"Opinion: I think that this is a pretty darn good stout. I have gotten a little spoiled by all of the imperial stouts around lately, so I started to compare it to them...that would not be right. This is just an American version of a dry stout and a good one at that. I will be drinking this beer again, I'm sure."
"Body is barely medium, but creamy and slick nontheless with ample carbonation. The big flavor makes you think this is a bigger beer, but actually this is very sessionable stout."
"Cheers!"
"Pours brown but appears black in the glass. Bountiful foam above the black body. Caramel and black malt aroma, providing caramel, cocoa and coffee hints, along with a huge burst of aromatic cascade, which hints of citrus and grapefruit. Flavor, though roasty and coffee laden, is suprisingly hop accented, with a citrusy and extremely bitter blend. I prefer decadent malt in stouts, not hop madness."
"Yep, that's right, I gave this beer 5's across the board, and I don't even have a second thought about it. This is a top tier beer. Other stouts can be as good as this, but I couldn't bring myself to say one is better. I am a big time Sierra Nevada fan, but I live in Minnesota and the only thing I can get on tap is the Pale Ale, I don't understand why more places wouldn't have this beer. Never have I had a stout that used hops so masterfully, they don't mask the roasted malt flavor at all, and they are not citrusy or over bitter. There are just enough to make the beer especially refreshing."
"Overall - An excellent stout.... recommended !!"
"Pours a very deep dark brown, almost black with a tan head leaving trace amounts of lacing around the glass. Roasty aroma's of coffee and toffee, with only a small hoppiness perceived in the aroma. Very nice taste, composed of some dark chocolate and a strong coffee taste, paired with a bitter hop kick and right back to another coffee taste that lingers in the mouth for an extended period of time. Medium bodied with a little above average carbonation, dry in the finish. Really a pretty drinkable beer and more than one can easily be consumed in a sitting. A solid beer that I will most likely keep around often."
"A great brew, not in spite of the fact that nothing stands out about it, but because nothing stands out about it. If you've got a craving for stout this will not disappoint."
"M & D: Mouthfeel and drinkability are both high on this offering from Sierra. Fizzyness makes this a nice smooth and easy drinking beer that tastes great and keep you wanting another. Good one, but I think there are better more complex stouts."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Deep black, with some ruby hues, thin tan film encrusts the surface, mild active carbonation present. Smell is faint, but with minor notes of toasted coffee bean, chocolate, and cherries. Taste is fairly sweet, strong on chocolate and coffee flavors, only mildly toasty. Alcohol not that strong in flavor. The finish is semi-bitter. Nice carbonation, decent thick mouthfeel. I think I started this thing out too cold in temperature, becuase by the time I was done it was going down easy and I was ready for another. A very solid American Stout and one you can find pretty easily which is nice..."
"I'd have no problem sitting down with a sixer of this any free afternoon. It's a tad thin but still very enjoyable."
"Inky black with a thick tan head that persists. Aromas of burnt coffee, toffee, spicy hops and cocoa. Tastes much the same, with a solid hop kick that doesn't overwhelm the chewy, roasty flavors that I love in a good stout. Finishes nice and dry, coffee-like with a great aftertaste of chocolate and hop spice. Thick body with medium carbonation, great drinkability. This stuff is outstanding with real vanilla ice cream."
"Pours out pitch black which only becomes slightly brownish if you hold it directly next to a light. Thick, mocha head holds up quite well. Beautiful stout. The nose is a great mix of chocolate malt, subdued roasted malts, and some earthy hops. I get some dried berries in there as well. Tastes of raisins, chocolate, and dark roast coffee. Just the right amount of astringency from the black malt. Along with the earthy hops, I get some citrus in the flavor that I'm not too keen on. Doesn't detract too much from the experience, but just sort of puts a blemish on it. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for me. This is a pretty decent stout."
"Overall, I was quite impressed by this Stout. I plan on enjoying this one again."
"Sierra Nevada really does things right. This particular beer pours a very dark brown almost black with a great creamy tan head that clings to the glass. Little tiny bubbles climb up the sides of the glass. The aroma is full of chocolate malts mixed with a nice amount of hops. The beer is very creamy and full bodied. This is one mighty fine stout that I will go back to often."
"Pours as black as the abyss with a thin tan head that fades out rather quickly, leaving little to no lacing. Smell isn't very strong, faint touches of coffee beans and malt. Taste is predominately of an espresso quality, finishes with sweet malt. Mouthfeel is full of carbonation, very nice on the palate. Overall, the experience gets better throughout the glass. Quality stout from quality brewery."
"Didn't expect to like this as much as I did, but hey, sometimes it's nice to be surprised. Seemed like a hybrid between a cream stout and some sort of west-coast hop explosion stout. In any case, the mix worked. Lots of hops, bit of coffee, and lots of milky sweetness. Thick, full head. Medium bodied and highly drinkable. All in all, a fine brew."
"*has nothing to do with this brew"
"				~Benjamin Franklin"
"This is a fantastic stout, full of flavor and very well balanced."
"After several session with this beer, it dawns on me that I've been away from this stout for far too long. Though there is not much in this brew to make it stand out from other big, bold, aggressive Stouts except for its quality and purity: it's balance, simplicity, and finess makes it the perfect specimen per style. Bold roasted grain, light hopping, and acidity contributes a strong coffee, roasted nuts, and cocoa flavors with a light charcoal-like quality and Supported by a solid pale malt base for sweetness and complexity. Light yeasty sourness and breadiness create an added layer of complexity right before the finish. Underlying alcohol never adds sweetness, very little heat, and no off flavors. Dry and roasty in the finish. The perfect stout for any time."
"Pours a pitch black color with some brown highlights. Has a large light brown sticky head. The smell is semi-sweet. It has hints of coffee, dark chocolate, and plums. The flavor is pretty much the same. A really smooth full body. Creamy mouthfeel and a dry hoppy aftertaste. I must say this is one of my favorite stouts. It has an awsome balance and perfect drinkability. I am in love!"
"I tried this beer on tap at Summits in Sandy Springs, GA. It pours into a barrel mug a deep brown color with a dark brown colored ¼  head that is steady with some lacing. The smell is of a roasted malty sweetness. The beer has a good bold flavor. It has a creamy robust flavor that tastes of roasted malt, sweet chocolate with a light hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is medium/heavy and full. This is a good solid stout and I would buy more and drink it anytime. I like it more than I do the Sierra Nevada Porter but both are very good beers."
"This brew pours a solid black color. The head is two fingers in height, and off white. It is really weird (in a good way) to see a stout with a head this white, it really gives it character. The aroma is of chocolate and roasted malts. It is very relaxing and calming. The taste of chocolate with some coffee in the finish. Coffee, where the hell did that come from? The aroma certainly didn't hint at it, but I sure do like it. The mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is one of the most unpredictable beers I have ever had. The appearance is odd, the aroma doesn't disclose the taste, and I love it."
"Drinkability- This one if just fine. Tasty, easy to drink and quenching. Sierra Nevada usually doesn't fail."
"This is one of the better offerings from this brewer. A very solid stout. The beer poured pitch black with a thick head. I think this is the first stout I have had with floaters. The smell is more like a good porter. The taste is toasted grain. There is a slight coffee finish. The mouthfeel is very smooth. No bad aftertaste here. I could drink these again and probably will because of it's price and availability."
"Pours dark black in color, with some ruby highlights. A half inch creamy tan head, that dissapates quickly. Some delicate, sticky lacing. The smell is mostly of roasted malts, with some hints of roasted coffee. Heavy roasted malt taste, and ends with a burnt exspresso and some nutty flavors. Well balanced, creamy mouthfeel, with lots of carbonation. Great drinkability, a definite session brew, low abv, not to filling, an all day sipper!!!"
"Pours black with ruby highlights. A massive three finger head is dense and tannish cream in color. Oustanding retention and sticky patches of lacing. Rich malty nose; roasted barley, dark chocolate and coffee aromas are full and strong. The roasted notes provide both a sweet, and a bitter-charred flavor. Coffee becomes very apparent in the middle, and some mild baker's chocolate peeks through. Dry aftertaste, where earthy american hops finally become present and complete the near perfect balance. Medium body, lightly carbonated, and exceedingly smooth. Would make a nice session ale, but could work equally well as a dessert beer."
"Poured nice deep black with creamy off-white head of large and small bubbles. Smell is earthy , deep rich tones of: some caramel , dark malts , bitter bakers chocolate, and leafy hops. Taste is similar , rich and malty-sweet yet balanced with fresh bitter hops. Chocolatey flavor is on the bittersweet side with roast. Very tasty and fresh. Carbonated and creamy mouthfeel. I found this Stout to be very drinkable and a great offering from Sierra Nevada Brewing Co."
"Dark, dark brown -- but not quite black. Some rubied light manages to sneak through. Sturdy tan foam cap about an inch or so. Roasted chocolate malt aroma with lively pine-needle compost hops making their presence known as well. Dark malt flavor. Chocolate oil sweetness broken up by hop bitterness. Roasty choco-coffee malts on the follow-through. Prickly-spicy hop finish. Quite good, quite good. Slick, oily mouthfeel, medium-to-full body. A great, great stout -- full-flavored but easily quaffed. Yet another fine offering from Sierra Nevada."
"This is really how a stout should be done. It really makes me realize how lacking Irish dry stouts like Guinness really are. Another feather in Sierra Nevada's cap as well. Bully!"
"Pours a dark brown with a 1/2"" tan head that has decent retention. Sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Smells like a fruity and floral coffee. Taste is of a black strong coffee, with a hop kick in the middle, and a nice roasted finish. Feels good in the mouth, maybe a bit too carbonated. Very drinkable. Nice tasting Stout that you could session endlessly. Another fine brew from Sierra Nevada and a fine representation of the style."
"Overall- a decent stout but aslighty harsh around the edges. If the alcohol could be masked better and tone down the carbonation this would be excellent."
"Definity not a bad entry into the world of American stout, and a nice platform from which to compare."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is meduim bodied. The carbonation is good. Leaves a pleasing dryness in the aftertaste. A very drinkable beer and one of my favorites."
"This beer was poured into a pint glass and was gone within a matter of minutes. No wonder it's a classic."
"In my last review I said this could be thought of as the default American Stout. Default has too many negative implications. Think of this beer as the standard American Stout against which all others should be judged."
"pours with a creamy head. black, but not quite opaque. towering lacing. odor of coffee and malts. taste is dry, roasted malts, bitterness, molasses. bubbly, reasonably thick mouthfeel. nothing special but decent stout. i'd have this again."
"Pours a densley opaque black with a nice tan head that retains alright. The aroma is nice with a big chocolate and coffee character, as well as some toasted bread and floral and citrusy hops . The flavor also starts of with some dark chocolate, assertive coffee component thats bitter almost to the point of astringency, burnt bread, some floral hops and dark fruits (plum, fig and raisin) and a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is full and chewy with a medium thick body and a bitter, astringent coffee like finish. Seems like a stout for coffee lovers for sure, but i enjoyed it."
"This stout pours a dark black with large head and good lacing. The smell is very strong with hops and barley...it also has a good amount of chocolate and coffee scents as well. Taste is something that is better left to the imagination. I was disappointed in this as I expected it to be a very above average stout. The aftertaste is not pleasent either...overall I could drink this in a pinch but would not prefer it."
"A prodigious tan head forms and eventually recedes, leaving a lacing down the sides of the glass. The beer is black, no light penetration so clarity is obviously not an issue. The aroma is full of wonderful smells. The roasted barley imparts hints of coffee, which are joined by bittersweet chocolate, cocoa, and just a hint of hoppiness in the background. The taste is very similar. The bitter coffee flavor imparted by the roasted barley is the major element, but the chocolate is also there in the background. It finishes with just the faintest bit of hop flavor, making it very unique. Extremely smooth and creamy, this beer should be held up as the standard for the style. Just a fantastic beer that goes down so easily. It's a shame I always forget about it, because it always amazes me when I rediscover it."
"Not the best stout ever, but a drinkable one that deeply satisfies despite some weak points."
"This is not Guiness so go ahead and loose that idea. It is not thick and has much more noticable hop flavor. Smells of chocolate and hops. Very tasty and fresh. Roasted malt and coffee shine though to a nice clean hop finish that is Sierra Nevada's signiture. Very refreshing for a stout almost drinkable in the summer at the beach. Pick it up if you can I highly recomend it."
"I believe this is the first time I've had this beer since about the late 90s. Not much of a stout guy, but this is a very nice brew. I like this way better than the Guiness I had last year. Would recommend."
"Somewhat creamy, with coffee bitters towards the end and chocolate undertones throughout. Some oversweetness in the aftertaste. Mellow. Sharp in the front, with a brief burst of carbonation that ceases immediately. A trifle flat in terms of fullness. Tastes like German malts. Not terribly complex."
"Man that hit the spot. Maybe the best looking SN bottle, /w Celebration up there too. A great medium stout, a fine creation by Sierra Nevada. I wish I could find a 12 pack at Jewel."
"The beer pours opaque black with a nice sized tan frothy head. The head hold and laces well. The smell and taste are mostly caramel and chocolate malts balanced nicely with some hop bitterness. The mouthfell is thick and well carbonated along with some welcome dryness. Overall this is a great stout."
"I want to rave about this beer. I really do because Sierra Nevada is a quality brewer that I respect. I reviewed this on the same day as I reviewed Snake River Zonker stout and the Zonker won hands down."
"I am sure this is an excellent session stout for many beer enthusiasts. It certainly is for me. Delicious."
"This is not an average beer but it is for the style so my review reflects that. When I want a hop attack I will go for a hop devil or something similar. But I like my stouts to be a bit more balanced than this."
"The beer pours a dark brown cola like color, still see through though. It has a nice fair tan head. The smell is pretty good, like a mocha chocolate cake. The taste is okay, there are better stouts out there. It goes straight to the bitter coffee taste that is a little overpowering, with no real strong chocolate that I can see, but finishes surprisingly smooth. The mouthfeel is surprisingly good. The carbonation is doesn't stick to your mouth, it is smooth, it is a little watery though. As for drinkability it is okay for drinking casually but not for chugging. Well as for stouts, and beer and general, I am not going to stop drinking Guinness but I can see myself coming back to this."
"Time-tested, multi-dimesional stout that showcases itself well."
"Notes: This is pretty good, definetly worth trying, though I don't think that it stands out as something special."
"Final Thought: Sierra Nevada is the micro-brewery that set the American standard on the Pale Ale, the Porter and now the Stout... I thank you Chico, CA!"
"Tastes very malty a very roasted taste, mixed with chocolate and a very creamy mouthfeel. This is one fine beverage that was made to be consumed at any occasion. I would highly recommend this to any person that loves a good stout."
"A lot of thought went into this beer, and I can taste it."
"Overall, a great stout. great for when you want to sit back and enjoy a readily available stout that hits the spot."
"Not the most outstanding or surprising stout in the world, but it's extremely solid, and I think that's what SN was really going for with this one. Great beer just to have around the house."
"~What a great beer. Couldn't say that I'd sit down with a keg and drink myself silly with this (not that I would with any stout), but one of two of these, a big ole mug of it, with a big hearty meal... I should do that soon. Yes, very soon."
"This is, without a doubt, another fantastic offering by Sierra Nevada. Had about 8 or 9 different syles of theirs, and one is better than the next! Very nice head pours out into the glass, with fine lacing all the way through. Very malty and chocolatey upfront, with a suprising bitter kick at the end. Interesting combo. Very pleasing on the palate. Very thick and creamy offering and another good one, by Sierra Nevada."
"Drinkability: I don't think I could take more than two of these in one sitting, but that's on par with my definition of a stout. No points off for the filling character."
"This is a favorite stout of mine, which for some reason, pours with more head than other Sierra Nevada offerings. That's okay, because all that foam benefits the appearance of this brew. As the head falls, some nice lacework is stuck to the sides of my pint glass. This stout pours deep black with a wonderful burnt chocolate and minty-citrus hops aroma. Hops are abundant in this stout and taste good mixed with the chocolate and roasted malt flavors. The finish is chocolately and bitter from both roasted grains and hops. Mmm, mmm."
"Good session stout. Solid and highly accessible."
"A delicious, enjoyable stout, one of my favorites from Sierra Nevada. Dense, dark brown with a sticky tan head. Nice aroma of dark chocolate and roasted malt. More roasted malt in the taste, backed up by chocolate sweetness. A surprising clean and light hop bitterness in the finish rounds out the fun. One of those brews I wouldn't mind drinking all night."
"Stouts don't get much more West-Coast than this; it's not necessarily my favorite interpretation of style, but it's hard to really fault, and it's definitely a nice pleasant drink."
"Wow this thing really melts. Chunky but fizzy, carbonated chocolate to start. Then it just melts into an aura of bitter coffee. Finish is soapy and not thick. Aftertaste is shy and well-mannered - doesn't persist like other stouts, which makes this one of the most accessible of the style. Great landmark stout with the drinkability of a Guinness. If I were to buy a keg of any stout this would be the one."
"Full of good malts, everywhere. I could definitely have more, anytime."
"D - This is one well crafted stout that I otherwise would have passed over, since Sierra Nevada has traditionally meant ""Pale Ale"" to me. Very well crafted and a pleasant surprise to boot! Very drinkable thanks to the sweetness being a *perceived* trait rather than an actual cloying one."
"Drinkability/Notes: I had been waiting for my funds to replenish to get a nice stout as the weather cooled down here, I went into the store with a few choices and once I got over that I had only had the IPA from SN before, Im glad I picked this one. Very drinkable, wonderful flavor. Just what I was looking for as fall turns to winter. I had to have another before I even started to write. A good looking, great tasting beer."
"Pours a thick, creamy dark brown body with a frothy tan head. Full of roasty coffee and chocolate malt flavours. Has a smooth and creamy body. This is a rich stout, with a earthy and dry finish. Wonderful american style stout. Could drink this all night long."
"A great stout, especially given the price. Compared to the somewhat overrated standard, Guinness Extra Stout, this has more depth, more flavor, better smell, even better balance of sweet and bitter. Much more drinkable too, far more of a session beer than I found the Guinness to be. Great beer, great stout, great price!"
"D - i can see myself sitting down and enjoying a nice six pack of these"
"Pours out a nice dark brown color. I was a little disappointed with the head of the beer. Smelled just like a good stout is suppose to. The taste was fairly complex. It had hints of coffe and chocolate, but not so much that is ruined the actual beer. This is a beer a guy could drink all night. I was fairly impressed with the selection."
"A nice dark brown color with a big two finger head.A coffee,chocolate, and malt aroma fills your nose.Very nice.The taste is very good.This is a very malty stout,but it has other flavors also.Their are hints of coffee and chocolate,but this is a malt dominating stout.This has a medium mouthfeel and is very drinkable.I will give this a very high mark."
"Another first time style for me. Since I'm a porter fan I thought this would be comparable and I was right. It poured a nearly opague ruby and sported a nice tan head that amost went over the top. Lacing was always presenthad a similar smell to the Baltic porters I've had. Sort of a roasty coffee aroma and taste was more of the same. I noticed this Stout has less viscosity than, say, a Black Boss but might be slightly thicker than Guinness. Finished with a mild bite. Not alot of carbonation. Enjoyable brew."
"Not as interesting (or epic) as Rogue's Shakespeare Stout (to name but one obvious example), but unusually refreshing for a stout. This is eminently drinkable, and avoids the coffee trap so I'm happy to recommend it as a session stout above blander stouts like Guinness."
"Drinkability: So well balanced & very tasty, it is very easy to quaff a few pints without realizing it. A real gem, Sierra Nevada's finest regular brew, IMO."
"Notes: I have to think sierra uses the finest ingredients. The offerings i've tried have all tasted great and well brewed. Don't be shy about paying for this brew as its well worth it. Truly a great stout."
"Dark inky black on the pour, forming a nice creamy tan head which lingered throughout. Nothing really standout in the aroma - mostly that somewhat woody, dark roasted malt smell. Tasted good, but again, nothing stood out to me other than a quality dark stout flavor. A little fizzy in the mouth, more than a creamy feel. Decently easy to drink for a stout, but alas, nothing special enough to make me buy it again."
"Really, one of my favorite beers. Brisk enough for summer, deep enough for winter, why on earth would one not have a six-pack of this in their refrigerator at all times?"
"One interesting note on this one is how dramatically the taste changes and improves as it warms. I know many beers I've tried many that do improve as they warm but I don't know if I've ever had one that really changed and improved so much as it warms. The chocolate taste especially becomes much more pronounced as it warms. ALl in all a delicious beer."
"all in all, excellent!"
"Drinkability: Yet another fine brew from Sierra Nevada. Mostly its a textbook stout, but it has a few quirks that make it just unique enough. A good, solid, very drinkable brew."
"D - A lot of stouts are pretty terrible in this category. They may be absolutely delicious, yet somehow difficult to finish. This one is an exception. It is probably due to it's outstanding creaminess, but I find the bottom of my glass very easily."
"02/08/09 update, I believe the last time I reviewed this they had the twist off tops so I thought this was worthy of another try."
"Poured the usual dark black of a stout with a dark reddish hue when held up to the light. A tan, creamy head formed on top and stayed around for a while. Slight chocolate and coffee aromas. Taste is slighly sweet, but is certainly dominated by coffee flavours. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Definitely a good, easy-drinking stout."
"Roasted grains and coffee flavor. Good chocolate and a bit of molasses."
"I think this is a decent drinkable stout. Not bad."
"Drinkability is good on this solid stout."
"The best thing about this beer is how it maintains its character even after two or three in a row. Note that this beer is meant to be consumed as fresh as possible- after 4 or 5 months it starts to lose a step in the hop department though it still is a heck of a beer."
"Overall, it's just very well balanced, strong, and quite complex in the best way. Very flavorful and doesn't have that stale alcohol taste that alot of stouts have. To me that's a good thing. I definitely recommend this beer as an excellent first stout for anybody that's curious about the style, and a good solid session beer as well. One of my very favorite stouts so far. Clearly a very underrated brew."
"It pours a ruby tinged black with a creamy looking three fingered tan head which has some serious staying power. Smell is dominated by chocolate and coffee aromas with just a slight bit of earthiness creeping around the outsides. Taste is very rich. Coffee dominates the palate when the beer is cold but as it starts to warm, a wonderful chocolate flavor begins to come out in full force. This beer is definitely better as it approaches room temperature. The slight roasty bitterness provide an excellent balance to the chocolatey sweetness. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. This is a highly underated stout and one of my personal favorites. I'm glad I have such easy access to it now."
"Highly recommended for newbies; pros will have a hard time coming up with negatives."
"I always have considered SN mainstream craft when in reality they are pioneers like Anchor. Shame on me. This stout poured deep and dark with a nice retaining and lacing tan head. Aroma was of slightly roasted malts and a good dose of aromatic hops. Good roasted flavor with a bit more hopping than one noramlly see's in a stout. Quite aggressive. Slilky mouthfeel and i found this stout very drinkable, even on the miserable hot evening I choose to drink it on. Very good stout and one I will not ignore in the future."
"Pours a very dark brown; the only light that gets through is a pretty ruby color when the glass is held up to a light. There's not much head, but what is there stays awhile. Smells of burnt coffee. Tastes sweetly malty upfront, which quickly morphs into a burnt coffee taste that echoes the nose. There's also some chocolate here. Mouthfeel is nice, seems thicker than their Porter, to which the Stout is superior. They're similar, but I think the Stout is just a little fuller and more chocolatey. A nice, tasty stout."
"edit: I just realized this is the big 200, and what a great beer to drink for a BA milestone."
"overall: one of my favorite stouts for the money and the availability. excellent complexity especially with food. i've had this with steak and with a chicken and cheese quesadilla (not during this review). very different foods, but both times, the food brought out a variety of different flavors. highly recommended."
"This is a fine example of a stout and is quite consumable. I have had many in the past and will definitely have another some day."
"The beer poured a deep brown with some subtle copper highlights. It was topped by a decent sized tan head that receded after about 3 minutes, but did leave a nice sheet of lace on the side of the glass. The aroma is dominated by roast malt in the form of espresso and a light chocolate. The taste is more subtle than I expected, a bit of bitterness and astringency. It has more of a coffee character and less chocolate than I detected in the nose. The citrusy bitterness from the hops comes across immediately. Very dry, with a mildly slick mouth feel. Decent drinakbility."
"Pours nearly black with a brown rocky head with excellent retention. Yeast ( from bottle conditioning ) remains at the bottom of the bottle. Roasted barley and citrusy Cascade hops dominate the aroma. Taste similar with some dark chocolate. A creamy mouthfeel from a medium body and help from a relatively high carbonation for a stout. Bittersweet-- the dark crystal malt, roasted barley combines with hop bitterness in the dry satisfying finish. A very drinkable stout."
"This is one nicely balanced stout - refreshing, rich, but not overly coffee/bitter. I think this may become a favorite of mine! For those who feel Sierra Nevada is a bit too big to produce a good microbrewed beer, give this a try and rethink your position!"
"Drinkability is very good. This is a mild mannered stout that you could drink all the time. Not my favorite style but I could see buying this again."
"Almost black with the slightest hint of red. Aromas of hops and roasted malts. The flavors are well balanced between the hops and the grainy coffee and chocolate. It also has a really nice caramel undertone to it, which gives it a slightly sweet quality. A straightforward example of what a stout should be."
"D-This has a nice hop flavor but doesnt really have the stout characters under it. It is missing a good malt profile or sweetness that I would expect from a good stout."
"Very, very dark brown, very close to opaque, with ruby/mahogany highlights. Generous, rocky, light brown head with good retention and lacing. Roasted malts, licorice, chocolate, and earthy hops combine very well in the aroma. That all carries over into the flavour, but there's more. Moderate bitterness provides some balance to the malts, roasted barley adds some dryness towards the finish, and milk chocolate is more prominent. Super creamy, almost chewy texture is an absolute joy and melds with the light dryness at the end. Full body with medium/light carbonation. Certainly one of the most enjoyable stouts I've had from the U.S."
"That said, it is a good beer anyway, quite drinkable, but far from a stout style."
"Only complaint is that the mouthfeel was a bit thin for me. Other than that, a nice readily available stout with a great roasty flavor."
"This is one of the more unique stouts I've had. Very different than the creamier if less flavorful Guinness. And I really enjoy it. Generally, I do not find stouts to be the most drinkable beers (Guinness may be the exception)...and this is definitely a sipping beer that improves as it warms. But, as such, it is very drinkable. I think I like it better than the Sierra porter."
"A damn solid stout that would rank pretty high for the style in my book."
"Nice jet black opaque body, with a nice large head, even when poured into a chalice. Smell is very chocolaty, like frosting, with coffee tones also present, and a little acidity. Taste is full and sharp, acidic coffee tones, dark chocolate and pleasantly bitter hops. A beer that demands to be sipped, and will reward you with even more flavor the warmer it gets. A great stout, which I expected from one of the most consistent micro brewers in the world."
"A very solid American Stout that is easily available. Sierra Nevada seems to make the benchmark beers that set the standards for everything else."
"Overall, pretty darn good beer here. I've also noticed it goes excellent with these sunflower seeds I've been munching on."
"This brew became better once it reached 58-60 F. My suggestion...at first pour, let the bottle warm to 58, then pour into room temp glass. Would go great with smoked pulled pork."
"A very solid stout. Pours very dark with no smell at all. The first thing you notice is the burnt flavor, and out of that emerges a chocolaty taste. It is much smoother than many other beers, and its thickness almost coats your throat. There is no aftertaste as well. Overall there is more taste in this that most stouts out there--a welcomed change."
"Drinkability: As good as this is, it isn't the most drinkable stout. Not to say that it isn't drinkable...but stouts like heart of darkness (magic hat) and old heathen (weyerbacher) go down easier."
"The first taste was fabulous. By the second swallow, I am already immune to this brew's powers. Really mysterious. The sweet, chocolate foundation that normally supports the coffee overtones has been replaced by hop bitterness. Seems almost a bit too light in body as well. Almost watered down in fact. ""Trying to be efficient"" comes to mind as a possible motive for the lack of balls manifested by this one. Dilute. This is a sessioner for sure. It doesn't taste bad. It really is quite alright. It just seems like a hybrid style at this point in my research. This is definitely not a one hitter quitter. I think we are meant to dispatch with the entire sixer on this one. Nonetheless, it is close to good. A serial drinkable beer. Okay."
"Started out great, nice blackish pour with smallish tan head. Excellent aroma or roasted barley, malts, chocolate and coffee. Nice chewy first drink, very malty with a dry finish. Only bummer part, was a bit too thin and carbonated. The more I drank, the weaker tasting it became. Still, a good middle of the road stout, but not overly impressive."
"Drinkability: My personal preference is for stouts that are more malty to a balance between malt and hops. I found this one to be a bit strong to the hops side, which I like in a APA or IPA but I don't necessary like in a stout. While many find this good, I don't really go for, just my preference. If you like a hoppier stout then this is your beer, I just couldn't get into it and will have trouble finishing the rest of the six pack."
"A pretty good stout but it is rough around the edges. Would prefer a little less alcohol to show through, a little less astringency, and the hops a little more balanced with the malts."
"*** My 500th review ... With respect to Fritz ***"
"This beer is most definitely a classic, when I first had it back in the early 90s I could not believe how much flavor was packed into this beer. The only complaint may be that this beer is a little too heavy on the roast malts, or at least the American ones, as it is a bit astringent in the finish. This is a minor complaint though, and it just makes you want to take another sip of this beer."
"poured a beautiful dark color, great stout taste with a nice hop taste at the end. I have recently become a fan of stouts and this has to be one the best I've tried. Nice deep coffee flavor with hints of burnt chocolate flavor. Hops add character without overpowering"
"Pours black with no visible highlights. A healthy amount of khaki colored head crops up to top off the pint glass. Some nice sticky lacing is left on the glass as this stout is consumed. Smells of coffee, roasted malt, and alcohol, with a slight bitter chocolate note. Also present is that dry, Guinness-like aroma. The taste is a long on the roasted barley and backed by coffee and chocolate. Some burnt black patent taste, which surrenders to an earthy taste. Hops are present, lending the slightest of citrous finishes. The roasted malt then proceeds to kick the hops' ass and dominate the aftertaste, which is pleasantly long-winded. A nice subtle dryness adds to the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little more than medium, not heavy or oily but slightly creamy. Too bad no bars around here carry this stout - I wouldn't mind downing pint after pint of this."
"A very good dry stout, a bit more bitter than Irish examples but still quite balanced."
"Nice ""american stout"" thats not too sweet and milky, surprisingly malty though. Gets better a little warmer with a bit more round flavour."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: This has Sierra Nevada written all over it. A good medium strength stout, pleasingly bitter, pleasure to look at, nothing wrong with it at all. But I have to say I prefer the Deschutes Obsidian to this one."
"relatively creamy, but with enough carbonation to really get the hop bitterness going. easy to quaff, tho perhaps a bit strong at 5.8% for a session drink. nice and complex, this stout seems very versatile, and is a good mark for what defines a stout."
"One of the best stouts in the world. Such a great, smooth, drinkable beer."
"Dark cherrywood color that poured out with a short lived brown head. Flavors of roasted grain, hops and alcohol, with hints of herbs and coffee. Finished with a touch of bitterness and malt. Far more drinkable than the pale ale, which I am not a big fan of. Worth a try."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black dark stout with medium dark head with pretty good retention. Aroma is a mix between some bitterness and roasted malt. Taste is dominated by the bitterness from the hops and lacks some roastiness. Overall, this is not a bad stout just not too well balanced IMHO."
"First time I've seen Sierra Nevada Stout so I had to pick one up. I've always enjoyed Sierra Nevada beers, so I know I wouldn't be let down this time. Pours a dark coffee color with a thin head that recedes nicely. The aroma is quite pleasant. It has a chocolate and roasted malt smell. It goes down rather smoothely and has a perfect aftertaste that stays on the palate forever. You can definately taste the roasted malts here and has a hint of coffeee flavor with moderate sweetness. I'm not a big fan of stout but this one is up there on my list."
"12 oz., bottle conditioned, with no freshness date. Pours into the Chimay chalice as black as can be with a 1 inch creamy tan head that leaves lots of lacing and rings on the glass. Smells sweet with coffee and bittersweet chocolate in the background. The beer leaves a warming sensation and has a slight alcohol taste. Has a roasted chocolate/coffee flavor with hops that contribute citric/floral flavors and a lasting bitterness (60 IBUs). Tastes well balanced and feels very nice. My favorite offering from Sierra Nevada so far, but I just bought a bottle of 2005 Bigfoot so we'll see."
"12 oz twist off bottle obtained from a local grocery store in Feb 2005. Pours a tan-brown thin layer of head over a very dark liquid that is dark red-mohoganey when held to the light (and is crystal clear). Smells of chocolate with a gentle coffee and that's about it. Tastes gently of roasted grains first, coming stronger in the middle and as the beer passes down the throat. Then, an earthy and unpleasant straw taste arises...perhaps from the hops? This unpleasant taste does have some floral character to it. Whatever it is, I'm not fond of it. A bit of a sour from the roasted grains, but not an overbearing sour like I find in so many other stouts. It's a dry beer, which serves to amplify the characteristics that I haven't enjoyed. Medium mouthfeel with mild carbonation that forms fine bubbles on my tongue. Little lacing inside my glass and the head is just a tiny ring for the last swallow. If I recall, this was just $5 per 6-pack and was not worth it. If you must chose a Sierra Nevade product, I recommend the porter instead."
"This ale pours a completely opaque black in to my tulip glass, with a deep ruby tint when the light reflects from it. The inch-thick tan head dissipates slowly, leaving lace on the sides of the glass and floating on top until the end. The smell is not as strong as some stouts that I am fond of, but smells of cocoa and coffee, with a bit of maple syrup. The yeast is slightly noticable as the ale warms. The taste is of chocolate and coffee, but slightly sweet, and light tasting for a stout, in my opinion. This ale is not very ""stout"" for a stout. Mouthfeel is a bit bland, although it is smooth. It's almost watery, like they added coloring to make it look dark, but underneath it is an average ale. I am not terribly impressed by this offering, but Sierra Nevada rarely impresses me. Drinkable, though, mostly because of the watery lightness."
"The head on this ale is both bubbly and fluffy. A sparse, but intricate lacing clings to the pint glass. The nose is rosty with hints of chocolate and a good waff of American hops. The taste includes chocolate, roasted malts, some nutty characteristics, and a bit grape or raisin. Mouthfeel is quite great. There is a good deal of carbonation but not too much. As you move towards the middle of the beer the hops make themselves known. There is a grape flavor throughout the beer that is probably due to a good dose of caramel malt. All in all, this American Stout is well crafted and very consistent. 2 Thumbs up!"
"A bit of a bland tasting stout. Nothing bad, but nothing that'll have me going back for more. A slightly above average offering from the fellas in Chico."
"This one pours a dark brown color with a small head that doesn't have much retention and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma has a very light coffee and malt character and is dominated by a hoppiness that is mostly citrus. The flavor is much the same. Some coffee tones, but there is an overbearing hop presence that I think is way out of place for the style. Easy to drink and it has a nice mouthfeel, but I like more malts in my stouts."
"from the bottle. poured dark brown with a fuffly tan head, with alot of lacing. aroma roasted malts, bakers chocolate, hops, coffee, dark fruits. flavor, malts, coffee, bitter sweet chocolate, yeast, drark fruits, has a dry chalky mouth feel. a good beer for 6.99 for a 6 er"
"As mentioned above, the mouthfeel is nice and creamy and very smooth overall. If i had any complaint whatsoever about this brew it might be that the body is a tiny, tiny, tiny bit too thin, but its such that I don't even notice it half the time. An excellent, easy drinking stout overall that I unfortunately tend to overlook more often than I should."
"This rounds out the Sierra Nevada lateral tasting. This beer pours a brown color that is very close to black. The small head falls to coat the beer lightly. The nose has some citrus hop with some coffee tones as well. The flavor is nice and roasted, with full on coffee flavor. I like it. The feel is nice and thick. Not syrupy but very coating. I do enjoy this beer. Its easy drinking and something I would probably keep around."
"Pours nearly black with an impressive head and good retention. There is an abundance of caramel and chocolate on the nose, and a well rounded creamy/bitter finish. Taste is just great and bears the mark of a Sierra Nevada brew. Hops battle abundant, rich malts for dominance the whole way through. Mouthfeel...a little thin but nice and persistent...coating action. Drinkability is just fine."
"This is a fine beer and a standard of its style. I think it is just a little too far over the top for me. I recommend it to folks trying to get the feel of the style or trying to figure out the hops/malt mix."
"Overall a solid, no-nonsense honest to goodness stout. Just drink and enjoy - everything else will fall into place. Truly a great stout."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle at slightly-cooler-than room temperature, this beer is a fantastic specimen: Jet black and solid, with a thick, dense tan head. The head is quite long-lived, producing a healthy lace until the end of the glass. Aroma is intense roasted barley malt, with a backdrop of bitter chocolate and dark roast coffee. Its simply a great smell. Taste is rather dry, with the roasted, almost burnt sensation. Its mouthcoating, creamy, and quite heavy. This is exactly what I expect when I see the word Stout. Finishes with a resonating bitterness, and a satisfying dryness. It just sort of makes you want more."
"The taste is very smooth - both in flavor and texture. There are many dark malts at work in here. The body is great for having a drinking session - it is heavy but not creamy, so it won't make you feel bloated (as quickly)."
"This beer starts off well with it's apperance. Body of the beer is pretty much black, with a large, rich caramel colored head. Tons of lacing and very nice head retention. Can smell lots of chocolate and roasted malt, very sweet. Can taste the caramel malt and chocolate, with a pleasent bitter finish. There's a dry, smoky aftertaste that completes the taste nicely. Drinkability is wonderful; it's complex yet not overpowering. I love this beer."
"This beer is not available in my area for some reason and it makes me very sore. Ive had it on tap before, and thought it was great. In fact Im hoping to achieve this particular balance in my home-brewed stout. I dumped this one out into the appropriate Sierra Nevada pint glass. The body is black, with an off-white head that springs up rapidly and hangs around stoically. Although black, ruby-garnet hues can be seen when the beer is compared to light. Lacing leaves thick sheets down the pint glass. The nose is roasty and sweet with malts and esters, leafy pine aromas are sprinkled around the perimeter. The flavor is nice and roasty to the point of being biting, this is a good thing. Mild berry esters up front, blending in with burnt toffee and dark roasted coffee flavors, nice bitterness throughout and a mild piny hop flavors pop up here and there in the finish. Mouthfeel is good, I'd like it a teeny-tiny bit more robust though. A good stout, although my memories of this on tap are a lot better than this one tastes from the bottle."
"Comments - I'm sorry that I waited so long to try this beer. In the mood for a stout? Grab yourself a sixer (or more) of this beer. Sierra Nevada delivers again!"
"I sampled one of these this evening, and was pleasantly surprised. Appearance: Very very dark brown, as close to black as can be without actually being black. Off-white head was long-lasting and thick. Smell worried me a bit - quite metallic. Taste however, was excellent. Nothing particularly unusual or outstanding about it -- just seems like the way a good stout should taste, with plenty of coffee and nutty undertones. Mouthfeel: a bit on the thin side, but overall quite good. Drinkability - Excellent, for a stout. I could easily make this a session beer."
"Compared to the smell the taste didnt stand up to what I thought it should. Nor did that mouthfeel."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours out nearly black with a one inch tan head. The aroma is chocolate and cream with some roastiness. Rich, roasted malt flavor. More chocolate flavor than I remember from previous tastings. The mouthfeel could be a little thicker. High level of carbonation. Good session stout from Sierra Nevada."
"A bit thin for a stout, and it goes down smooth."
"SN Stout pours almost pitch black, head is off-white and creamy. Aroma is of roasted malts and some dark chocolate. The smell isn't quite strong enough. Taste is a nicely balanced mixture of roasted flavor, hops bite, and dark chocolate. More creamy on the palate than I expected and definitely not as filling as I thought it'd be. This is one of the few stouts I've had so far and all I can think is how closely it resembles a porter. I really enjoyed this and now find myself motivated to seek out more stouts."
"A very doable stout. Appearance is typical of the style, very dark brown, but not quote opaque black. Nice light brown head. Smell doesn't really jump out at you, but a hearty malt base makes itself known as does a musty hop smell. Tastes is nice and malty, with hints of chocolate and a dry hoppy backbone with a touch of bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel and certainly very drinkable for the style."
"This is not a very complex stout, just very solid and well constructed. Drinkability is excellent. Another solid offering from Sierra Nevada Brewing. Highly recommended for an American stout."
"Poured out of the bottle dark with a little light showing through.Smells good coffee like. However in the taste department im not impressed. Leaves a bitter taste i cant point out but not desirable.Mouthfeel is thin,,its drinkable but doesnt have much of a place in my fridge."
"Pours a deep almost-black brown with a frothy, pillowy chocolate head. Semlls fabulous. Very deep and complex smelling. Great hints of cocoa and caramel. Tastes follows the smell with a nice, nearly overpowering chocolate flavor. A suprising amount of hops in the finish for a stout, but rounds it off great. Nice and creamy in the mouth. A good beer, but an even better session beer. Given it's ""lower"" potency, but with how thick and heavy it is, this is one I could drink all day. My first attempt at Sierra Nevada, and this one is a keeper."
"I'd probably not suggest this beer to someone because there are just so many better ones."
"Pours black with chocolate milkshake like head, great retention. Smells not too strong at first, but the chocolate and dark roast come out as it warms, really pleasant. Taste balances the hop and the malt really well, nice bitter taste throughout, and long malt finish. Not quite as much body as I would like, but getting close. I forgot how much I liked this beer, hopefully I will remember to make it one of my regulars."
"Note: if all my reviews seem to be coming in about the same, its because I don't bother to review beers I don't really enjoy, and I have a very hard time giving fives to any beer no matter how good. I want to believe something better can always be created."
" A classic stout."
"Pours a dark black red brown tints around edges nice fluffy brwo head that leaves nice lacing. Smells creamy dark roasted malts light coffee exprsso flavors. Taste is nice hardy roasted malt, light coffee flavors light bitterness complemented by small dosage of hops. Overall a nice solid oldfashion American stout nothing extraordinary just plain old creamy goodness. Mouthfeel is good smooth and creamy niceness. Drinkability is good been a while since my last Sierra Stout will not wait as long again."
"Sierra Nevada continues to impress."
"All in all, this is a very solid stout."
"Pours a deep dark black color with a strong carbonation that creates a large fluffy offwhite head. Aromas are very malty and roasty with hints of coffee and a slight slight hop. Flavors start off very robust and roasty, with a slight astringency but a nice tone. There's a bit of smoke present in the brew, but very hidden behind a nice backing bittersweet chocolte, and some coffee flavors. This beer finishes creamy with a slight roast finish and a well pronounced hop character and bitterness. Overall a great example of a stout by the company that got me started into good beer."
"Pours from the stubby brown bottle a beautiful opaque black with a nice 1 inch tan head. Just the way a good stout should look. The smell is of roasted malts and hops. Some caramel and light coffee tones are present. The aroma is wonderful and begs you to indulge. The first sip brings a wonderfully toasted malt flavor along with some coffee notes as well. The hops are definetly there on the palate as well...bringing this stout together in a sublime fashion. It's just a damn fine, tasty american stout...no bones about it. Mouthfeel is great...rich and full bodied. This one will fill yer belly. As far as drinkability...I dunno if I'd have more than a few of these...but I'd say that about the style in general. This is a great beer that I'm sure I'll revisit time and time again. Also, it leaves some very nice lacing patterns on my pint glass as well."
"This beer is black in color with a tan head. There are faint red hues when held to a light. It has a decent head with thick lacing. It has a roasty nose. The taste is roasty with coffee and chocolate notes. This beer has a medium to full body with good carbonation. A great stout that would be a good session beer."
"Overall, this is a nice stout. If not for the off finish (to me at least), this would be a great one."
"Two of the best aspects of this beer is its price and availability. Ive seen it compared to Rogue Shakespeare Stout, sold in this part of the world for $3+ per 22oz bomber. At $6.99 per six pack, which can be found in most major grocery stores year round, Sierra Nevada Stout earns its way into becoming a great micro-brew."
"Taste: Very good. I gave it a 4.0 because it is truly exceptional for a bottled stout. Very hoppy, chocolate was slight and nice rounded flavor."
"Sierra is not a big chewy stout on the scale of Bells, but very tasty and drinkable."
"Big robust and black. Nice tan head topped it off nicely. A slight slick oily residue indicates some retention. As it hit my mouth the taste was a slight overwhelming at first but calmed into the following: Roasted nuts, molassas and a mild hint of chocolate. Although this has a mild aftertaste that has quite a longevity, I don't mind it at all. Great beer."
"Great appearance - really black, with nice big grey head that dies gracefully. Smells of chocolate and coffee, with maybe a few other hints here and there. Taste is dominated by coffee, bittersweet chocolate... I do like a good roasted flavor, but this one seems a little too burnt to me, and I'm not entirely sure the hop presence works as well as it could. Strong coffee aftertaste. Very nice mouthfeel, dry with good carbonation to keep it interesting. Good drinkability, if it had slightly less of a bitter, burnt taste, this could be my perfect session beer."
"Another consistent offering from Sierra Nevada. Solid."
"Drinkability: More! More! More! One of the things I kept marveling at while drinking this was that with every swallow my very next instinct was to want another sip. The spot-on taste and the luxurious mouthfeel managed to be very satisfying without being heavy - an astounding trick for a stout."
"Over all, I was impressed by this beer. I'm probably in the minority, but I've never been a big fan of this brewery's other offerings. With that in mind, I was halfway expecting to dislike this beer. What a pleasant surprise it was to open it up and let that smell hit my nose. This will probably never be one of my favorites, but I will buy it and drink it again."
"Drinkability: This could be one of my all time favorite stouts. I think this would also do well for people who aren't stout fans. A classic to be sure."
"This is one drinkable stout, its not too heavy like many of the ones I have had, but not too thin like others. I would have to say, next time I am in the mood for an american stout, this is the one I will reach for."
"There's an upfront astringency when you first sip it but mellows out into a smooth chocolatey finish. Great beer, very drinkable. This could find a regular rotation in my fridge if I wasn't so intent on constantly trying new beers."
"Pours with a good two-finger tan head atop a nearly black body. Head quickly settles to about a centimeter, where it stays throughout the rest of the glass. Nice sweet, roasted smell, very good to what I expect from a stout. The taste is immediately sweet with a rich middle and ends with a balanced hop bitterness on the back of the tongue. Very rounded mouthfeel, definitely balanced and rich. This is a beer that I could drink pint after pint of. Overall what I expect from Sierra Nevada, good beers made well to style, without much in the way of experimentation."
"This baby poured black as tar and had a very fluffy and thick cream head. Ulitmately the easiest way to describe the taste of this beer is to say it tastes exactly how a sierra nevada stout would taste. There is just some distinguishing flavor about this brewery. It has a very solid nut and burnt chocolate taste and a sharp bite at the end that is so familiar with SN. A wonderful stout with some west coast flare."
"All in all, an above average beer. I would recommend it, but there are better stouts out there."
"Poured a nice brown/ruby/black color, with a nice tan; frothy head. Tastes of coffee, nuts, and cocoa come through, followed by a roasted and subtle burnt flavor. The malts overpower the hop presence, although the hops are still distinctly present. Very balanced, not over-complex...very tasty. This is a good sipping beer, though after 2 or 3 I'd be done!"
"I can really drink this, a very tasty stout."
"poured a very dark maple syrup color, dark tan head, creamy, tiny bubbles and lacing present. Nose of dark, yeasty bread. Roasted malts, sweat caramel, dark chocolate, coffee, cocoa. Mild grainy hops come in late. Tasty stout, quality sipper. Stout lovers rejoice."
"Pours a dark black with a thick (approximately 1.5 fingers), cloudlike, tan to off-white head. A great aroma of chocolate and roast malt greets the nose. Flavors are dominated by malt with some hop presence--the malt tastes very nicely of chocolate and roasted coffee. Smooth, full-bodied and rather delicious, this is a very drinkable beer. For one reason or another I seem to rarely have one of these, and I'm really not sure why, as I really enjoy drinking this very nice stout."
"Overall: This beer is outstanding. Probably the best stout, outside of imperials, I have had the pleasure of trying and I am going to make sure it is always a part of my beer inventory."
"When I first poured the beer my first impressions were that this beer didn't have the stout head I was expecting.The color could have been a little darker. There wasn't any aroma (alot of stouts don't have aroma) The beer tasted great though. Nice roasted barley flavor with maybe a hint of black patent. I liked the hops in here also.It finished very well. It could have been ""thicker"" for my tastes. But overall a good beer."
"A very enjoyable stout, very easy to drink with great malt/hop balance. Awesome."
"Sierra Nevada Stout is another solid effort from this brewery. It really should be labeled as a chocolate stout since it most certainly tastes like one. I'm thrilled that it's available locally."
"This is a well built stout. Appears black with a thin tan head. Toasty malt smell with a raisin like fruitiness. Tastes very dry for a stout with some roasted coffee tastes and a good amout of discernable hop flavor. Overall a medium bodied well balanced taste. Could use a little creamier mouthfeel in my opinion but is probably more drinkable than some others of the style."
"Pours a deep auburn brown -- virtually but not quite opaque in the glass, with a small mustard brown head that slowly thins. The aroma is slightly charcoal, roasted, and malty -- but very subtle and light. The brew is thick and chewy -- coating the palate and the throat, but not syrupy at all. Unfortunately, the taste was lacking for me. Somewhat watery, lightly hinting at caramel, but the taste was a little weak and slightly burnt. Not bad, mind you, but there are many better types of stout. Could be considered easy drinking, but I'd get bored doing it."
"nicely balanced and easy to drink, another fine selection from sierra nevada"
"Typical stout appearance: Very dark, glints of garnet when backlit, topped with tan foam. Roasted malt aroma with a little fruit. Taste is initially hoppy, followed by carmel malt and coffee flavors. A little mild stout bitterness, too. I liked the regular stout flavors paired with the unmistakable taste of west coast hops. Dry finish. Good mouthfeel, medium body. Pretty good drinkability."
"It was more creamy and carbonated that other stouts. That may make it more popular.It has Less coffee more chocolate with fruit flavour, which I enjoyed better than the stouts I had had to this time. Good aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel and good on the palate."
"I really like Sierra Nevada stout-- it's a wonderful beer at a good cost. That said, something seems off about the glass I'm drinking right now. It almost has a sesame oil aftertaste, and I am not a sesame oil fan. Everything else about the beer, from its dark, opaque color and tan head to its smooth drinkability, is wonderful. It has just enough bitterness balanced by the right level of sweetness to make me very, very happy. I'm just glad this isn't the first bottle I've ever had, because the sesame oil flavor is really getting to me. Let's chalk it up to not cleaning my glass thoroughly (or something) and move on with giving this beer the good review it deserves."
"This is a incredible brew, one that I could have a good number of in one sitting and a brew that I think I could have year around, even in the hot summer months."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, nice tan 1/2 inch head formed on a dark mahogany, nearly opaque brew, which lets only the very least amount of light through. Good lace appears on the sides as the beer abandons my glass. Heavy malty aroma, and also a strong hops essence in the nose. Taste is hearty and dominated by the dark malts, coffee and chocolate, which leaves a bitterness on the tongue, almost as if the malt and hops flavors are two different entities with two distinct timings to their flavors. Quite interesting phenomenon in my mind. Very smooth, goes down nice and easy, with the late bitterness detracting just a slight bit."
"A pitch black with a thick brown head that is very fluffy. Strong aroma of roasted malts,coffee, and chocolate. Slight hints of hops. The taste is terrific with a tangy hop sensation and a blend of coffee, chocolate, and bit of caramel. Very rich creamy taste and thick body. A dry aftertaste topped with coffee. Delicious. This is another classic produced by Sierra Nevada."
" The feel is somewhat thick, and emits prickly bubbles as it slides to the rear of my mouth. Very easy drinking and tends to go fast - but is somewhat filling. This is a good beer, but not a special beer."
"A damn fine stout. Very drinkable, and seems bigger than it is at only 5.8% ABV."
"this is some pretty good stuff. i have been wanting to try it as im a fan of stouts...its cold as piss in my house and this goes along well with the cold weather."
"Medium bodied with a full, rich creamy mouthfeel and a good amount of carbonation. Quite filling but great drinkability nonetheless."
"Overall, a good brew, and one that I'll definitely have in the future."
"This is definitely a good stout, but I would choose Sierra Nevada's Porter over this for its sheer drinkability. This one is certainly hoppier, less sweet, and maybe even a bit more ""in your face"" than the porter. A good winter beer."
"A deep black colour with a thick tan, almost brown head. The smell soft with a nice aroma of chocolate. The taste was a smooth and tasted of an easy to get along with chocolate. There were also hints of coffee, but the choclate was much more pronounced. It was very good and easy to drink."
"A damn good session stout. Another solid offering from SN."
"Overall a decent stout, and slightly unique because of the creamy factor."
"Deep brown, bordering a black hue, thick tan head, decent lacing. A nice nose of caramel, roasted malts and some chocolate. Off the cuff, sweet malts, thick and definitely full bodied, to be expected. The sweet, dark roasted malts give way to some delicious licorise and dark coffee bean flavoring, but wait we aren't done yet. The cascade hops that SN has been world famous for, come out in the background. Finishes with a delicate dryness, and very little on the palate, just a craving for more. This should be the definition of a stout - everything to be expected and then some, a perfect session stout, superb!"
"Tastes overall of a very spicy stout. Nice burnt malt bitterness but mellowed with smooth creamy overtones. Spicy and peppery too. Full bodied of course but not much aftertaste. Adds to its smoothness but you wish it would hang around a bit longer on the tongue. Very drinkable and very tasty. An old friend I should visit more often."
"The beer pours a very thick black color with a very thick tan head that lasts. The aroma is good. It is full of black barley and crystal malts; a dark one for sure. The taste is good. It has much of the same. A thick dark feel with lots of dark malts. It seems to be higher in alcohol content than most beers. The mouthfeel is good. It's a full bodied ale that's well carbonated and highly drinkable."
"Pours black with a smooth tan head. Lots of espresso and chocolate notes in the aroma, with noticible hops. Thick substantial mouthful. There can be no mistaking this for anything other than a stout. Taste is more coffee and chocolate, with subtle port notes. Nice hop balance as well. Finishes with a long lasting bitterness. Pleasing and warming on a cold winter night."
"A somewhat deciving stout..it actually seemed to be higher in abv than advertised. Still, an excellent choice. Beautiful dark reddish black color...Rich, full malty smell...hoppy hints. Nice taste..a bit hoppy (which I like). Very nice slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was somewhat dry....but in a nice way. Easy enough to drink, witha real good aftertaste."
"Pours a deep black with a slight reddish hue in the bottem of the glass with a light almond colored head that leaves some decent lacing.Aroma is very roasted and nutty with hints of grassy hop.Taste is nice and nutty with a highly roasted malt flare the hop is very noticable as it gos very nicely in the mix with the nuttiness of this beer.A really balanced stout here not a one sided beer here.A real treat to drink."
"A beautiful brew. This now my favorite session beer. The price and the taste is right. I raise my glass to Sierra Nevada."
"This beer was kind of a dissapointment but it was still better than alot of beers I've had. It poured a great deep brown color with a huge fluffy tan head that gave way to lots of lace down the glass. The smell had lots of roasted malt and coffee scents in it. The taste is what dissapointed me a bit. It tasted a little too ""earthy"" in my opinion. The hops snuck in and the roasted malt flavors were good but there was just some kind of sour flavor that I got from it that was not too pleasing. Although I did notice that there was a hard ring of yeast or something at the bottom of every bottle of the 6 pack that I drank so this batch could have been a little old. I will mostly likley try it again before I pass final judjement on this beer, but as it is now, I like the Sierra Nevada Porter MUCH better than the stout!"
"Top notch stout"
"I'll echo the comments of some others that this brew must be consumed at cellar temperatures to be fully appreciated."
"Way ta go, SN!"
"S. N. continues to impress and shine Seductive dark color with a better head than you see on most stouts.Chocolate malted aroma, smooth dark chocolate taste,slight bitter coffee aftertaste. Right up there near the top, but the best are bolder and denser."
"Highly drinkable. A superb stout. I want another."
"Try it sometime and you will be happy that you did."
"The smell is very malty with a hint of some grape or plum hiding in there too. The taste is spot on. Dark and burnt with a hint of coffee and plum. Maybe a hint of chocolate too. Maybe a hair too hopped at the end, but that's just my hang up. Got to take a little off for the hops. Overall a very nice stout."
"Appearance: Dark, with a very resilient tan head, almost opaque, with a few reddish-brown highlights. Aroma is mostly hops, some roastiness in the background. Taste: very strong hop flavors predominate first few sips, as you have more, malty, nutty, roasty flavors become evident. Also some malt sweetness. Bitterness is quite strong, but mostly due to hops rather than roasted malt, which doesn't see quite right. Mouthfeel: thick, creamy. Drinkability: the battle of roastiness and hopiness seems a little overcluttered, but otherwise quite drinkable."
"s.d."
"O bitter circumstance, why hath I bought but one bottle? Dammit...."
"The stout is deep brown, almost black in color, with a nice head that reminded me of a light colored chocolate mousse. The aroma was a decent balance of roated malt and chocolate. The flavor is big, roasted malts with a coffee and chocolate aftertaste that lingers on the tongue. Bitterness is extremely evident compared to other stouts. Very smooth and has great body. Extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability: You gotta like a bitter stout to drink this beer, if you dont like that this is not for you but if you do like a beer that is bitter in a good way this is a beer you have to try."
"Dark Black color, large tannish foamy head. Aroma is chocoloate and coffee. Roasted malts, some hop bite. A full flavored stout. Medium body. Good balance. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is a touch dry. Aftertaste is roasted malts and slightly bitter."
"I don't know, I just didn't get that much from this beer. Do they need to put cascade in everything they brew? Maybe it's their trademark, I don't know. Looks good, dark with a decent head. Aroma is predominantly cascade and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is ok, but the overall flavor is really lacking in my opinion. Nothing really grabbed me with this one."
"I actually liked this beer quite a bit more than I expected I would. It surprised me. I was told by several people, and had read it on this site, that this was a great beer from a great brewery. However, being in the advertising business, I couldn't get past the ugly lables. Glad I found this as a single, it made it much easier for me to get over my reservations and try it. I also picked up the porter and a few other beers. Very tasty, I would recommend it to anyone."
"Deliciously dark brown body with a medium sized light brown. Smells of roasted coffee and bitter chocolate show themselves despite a huge hop presence. Taste starts of kinda sweet, roasty and stouty, but this is soon flung aside by a surge of SN hops. Too much for this brew, in my opinion. It's still pretty good, but not really a stout."
"Not much of an aroma, definately get some dark malt or roasted barley scent, but not so strong, some hops and some kind of unpleasant yeastyness. Pretty smooth stout, fairly bitter, an herbally, earthy hop flavor that goes well with the sharp dark grain flavors. A nice head that pours pretty big but after a minute or two settles into a very nice, creamy, quaffable cushion. Very drinkable. Really one of my top three everyday beers."
"ng"
"The taste is very good. Borderline porter and considerably sweet full, creamy body with a nice weak carbonation and fruity feel of the alcohol: a well balanced bitterness reflects the fine hops in it. Excellent mouthfeel, making this a great brew worth having many, many times (not on my budget of course)."
"Overall, a pretty good beer, pretty similar to their Porter. Good %ABV makes this a nice session stout."
"Comments  I tasted this alongside the SN porter for comparison purposes. They are both excellent brews. I liked the smooth and creamy texture of this one most and appreciated the depth of the body as well."
"One of the greatest, commerically available stouts you can get. I have been a long time fan of most all SN brews, but this one just takes the cake. Smooth, creamy chocolate roasted smelling head, dense mouthfeel with good carbonation, and a taste of dark chocolate, roasted black patent and a nice hop finish. What a great beer!!"
"Notes: Brilliant. Cheap, available, session stout."
"I believe I had tried this early in my ""beer revolution"", but it was likely overshadowed by bolder versions. Nonetheless, it is a damn good stout. Similar to other micro stouts in taste and body, certainly on the bitter side of balance. Nice chocolate notes, quite drinkable. Certainly not a stout to blow your socks off (certainly not compared to the many super-charged stouts and imperials around these days), but would do fine any time."
"This was a tasty beer but I don't know if it was really a stout. There was a definite Sierra Nevada influence here. It was quite hoppy for a stout. The malts come first showing some coffee and toffee with a little dextrin sweetness but then the hops come on really strong with the taste of plums and some sour notes as well. A good beer but not really true to it's style."
"Praise to Sierra Nevada!"
"Dark brown to black color; light doesn't even get through when held up to a lamp. Light brown frothy head with big bubbles that raise an inch high, and slowly recede, leaving clingy lace. Aroma is of bitter hop, raisin, hints of chocolate and malt, perhaps a little cherry. Rich flavor hits the tongue all at once - burnt malt, coffee, and a bitter chocolate finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Well balanced, very smooth, delicious, and very drinkable for a stout."
"This is not a bad beer. I have enjoyed drinking it. It just doesn't seem like a stout, apart from its appearance."
"It looks like a stout, but doesn't really taste like one. I was expecting a roasted malt/choc aroma, but it ended up being more hoppy. The palate was the same. Slight roasted malt at the start, but it grapefruits out too much (hops), particularly for a stout. I guess it kind of worked, but the ingredients (roasted malt and grapefruity hops) didn't quite blend together. Not really a good example of a stout, but tasty all the same."
"-F"
"A licorice color with an amber hue sits beneath a sturdy beige/tan head. Plenty of sticky and trailing lace to admire. The aromas of bitter chocolate and floral fresh whole hops mingle with light fresh coffee smells and dark roasted barley. A sweet heavy malt houses flavors of chocolate, coffee and caramel. Highly hopped with a complex mix of spicy, and citrus bitterness. Bright, sweet, bitter, lightly smoky, complex and highly drinkable."
"Bountiful lacing. Dark tan head. Dark dark body, with the slightest red tint. Chocolate and acorns. Burnt dark bread toast aroma. Assertive but gentle hops. Coffee flavor surprising considering it was barely detectible in the aroma. Wonderful full mouthfeel. This is wonderful."
"This is a hell of a well balanced brew. It pours out from the signature Sierra Nevada bottle as a bubbly, near black brew with a thick tan head. The head falls but retains a good half-inch the whole way down. Considering some of SN's better beers, I am not at all surprised that the aroma is hoppier than what many stouts are. This is a good thing...me love hops. Dried fruit and dark chocolate are also discernible in the nose. Mouthfeel is nearly perfect, smooth, creamy, and surprisingly not as carbonated as the apperance would lead one to believe. Has a very nice roasted malt backbone to balance the hop bitterness. Bitter chocolatey finish. Among stouts and all beers, this is a truly wonderful, well balanced beer. A rating of kickass is in order."
"It's opaque with a medium sized and thick tan head. Roasted maltiness and crisp hops make up the aroma. This beer is medium bodied and creamy on the palate, very drinkable. A dark Roasted malt character is strong, as well as bittersweet coffee and then the rush of cascade hops through the dry finish.....top notch stout here with just enough bitterness to enjoy, nothing is overkill."
"This brew poured a medium head of brown bubbles and a opaque black body. It has a strong malt aroma that is very pleasant to the nose. The flavor is that of coffee and just a hint of chocolate. It has a good lacing and starts off with a slight bitter sensation that smoothens in its finish. This brew goes down very easily and is very drinkable. It is one of the better stouts on the market."
"This stout poured a large tan head of fine-small bubbles. It left a fair amount of lacing on the sides of my glass. The body was black in color. It had a good coffee aroma to it and a smooth coffee taste as well. All in all, a very fine stout in my opinion."
"This stout poured a deep dark black. It gave way to a tan head. I even had some cascading happening after the pour. The head did give away to a nice size lace for the rest of this stout. The aroma is mixed; deep roasted malt and hints of coffee were present. The taste matched the aroma to a T. It is not very rich but has a lot of flavor. This is a nice medium body stout that is very drinkable! Cheers!"
"A delightful dance takes hold in every sip: the bitter hops do a fancy tap, until lush, dark malt sweeps in and hogs the spotlight, before long the two begin to tango! A rousing and roasty stout, all around!"
"Very good drinking stout well done SN!!"
"This is a solid stout and pretty drinkable and the 5.8% can be sneaky after the first glass."
"I saved this little beauty for review number 200 and I was not disappointed. This is a very complete beer. The appearance is just, very simply, stellar. Deep dark color of black/brown and quite opaque. The head came up easily and lasted throughout. The head was rich looking dark tan and very full and creamy. The lacing was simply outstanding and quite sticky. IMHO the weakest element is the lack of a strong nose. This may be because the delicate balance of malt and hops cancel one another. The taste is certainly beautifully balanced with the hops perfectly blending with the malted barley. Some roast sense and an element of some citurs of the grapefruit variety. Great presentation from the squat brown bottle, nice yellow lables, and the great pour beauty. A numer 200 to remember fondly."
"Drinkability: While it's quite basic and a little generic, this is good stout. I don't think it's special enough to become a regular, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"The beer poured a dark, light absorbing brown. It had a quick to dissipate head but the aroma was very nice. Smokey, Coffee and malt. The taste isn't as aggressive as some stouts, which is better now that its spring, but the soft dry feel really satisfies. My only mistake was trying to wash down pineapple with it."
"A nice dark stout with an almond colored head. There is a definite sweetness to the aroma as well as malts. Chocolate and roasted coffee flavors intertwine with the thick feel of this stout. The hops show up towards the end of each sip, offsetting the sweetness nicely. A good stout."
"Pleasant, but uneventful. Poured the deep dark color we exspect. Had the roasted, sweet taste we also have come to exspect. Something was missing, and I just could not put my finger on it. Was this beer trying to be a porter? It did not seem to have that robust taste I look for in a stout. Overall though, it was a godd tasting beer."
"For a stout, it is very sweet. Coffe taste, with some carmel mixed in for good measure. It doesn't have the ""sierra nevade taste"" (slight dry bitterness) that I have become acustome to. Mildy sweet, not like sacharine, but less then regualr sugar. Something of a smokey, or toasted flavor as well.Very easy drink, very nice overall, another fine sierra nevada"
"Mmmmm Good! This is one great stout. Pours a deep, dark jet-black color with a thick creamy head that has fairly good retention. Theres a heavy coating of lace left on the glass. Aromas are full of dark roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate with mild caramel undertones. The taste is incredibly balanced. The malts are very apparent upon the initial taste, followed by a slight hoppy bitterness, finished off by a mild sweetness...possibly brown sugar? This is a very smooth and easy drinking stout. Its one of my favorite stouts."
"This is a very drinkable stout. I would like to try it on tap, possibly at the brewery, with a pint of each other Chico offering waiting for me, lined up on the bar."
"Pour yielded a tall brown and extremely thick head.The color was an opaque black.Head took forever to reduce so i could take a sip.Left tons of sticky and thick lace.Appearance was exceptional.Aroma's of molasses and sweet chocolate with a hint of hops.A very easy and creamy mouthfeel.Leaves a long lasting bitterness in the back of the throat.Full bodied with a sweet finish.Hints of coffee and smoke flavors.I taste the hops I didnt taste at first now.Overall not bad.A little less bitterness and maybe a higer ABV.Needs a distinct flavor."
"Comments: Very delicious brew. The chocolate and coffee tastes keep fading in and out and trading places with one another. Wonderful burnt and roasted flavor too. The flavors complement one another extremely well. Thank you Keith (stegmakk) for the bottle."
"I would buy this some more...not in the top of my beer purchasing rotation...but up there"
"around but this one has to be a West Coast classic of the style."
"Pours black black black black with a big tan head. Nice bitter malt flavor with a great bitter hop flavor to balance it. A few malts that I find personally offensive have been thrown into the mix (ie chocolate) so I couldn't give it a better rating. Despite that, this is a very drinkable stout and I do enjoy it quite a bit. The aftertaste is nice and just sits there in your mouth as if to say ""have some more."" This is almost Imperial in many ways, but perhaps not quite big enough to earn that label."
"Rich and full bodied. It is creamy and extremely smooth with light carbonation. Chocolate and coffee are dominant in the flavor of this one. It is nice and roasty all the way through. Aftertaste is filled with cappucino. A great stout."
"Came out looking completely black, until held up to the light, which let a slight amber color through. The head is a nice light brown color, very creamy. As for the taste its very rich with a hint of coffee in there.Personally not my favorite sierra nevada but it is a very nice stout."
"Overall, this is a quite good stout."
"Wow cracked open this baby and I was greeted with a barrage of cascades, gotta love the hopped up stouts. She pours almost completely opaque, but it does let some ruby amber shades in around the edges when held up to the light. A moccha colored head full and fluffy, already starting to form a collar of lace down the glass. The cascades come through in the flavor very pronounced with citrus tones, but underneath there somewhere are the cofffe roasts, and full slightly burnt roughness balances perfectly somehow. A smooth creaminess lines my tongue, then out of nowhere my palate is bumrushed with bitterness I love hops that go this well with something they aren't traditionally meant to. Some consider this off balanced, but I consider it an art form that is cutting edge. I find it a complete enjoyment, and the mouthfeel is heavy to medium in body but the creamy sensation makes each sip worthwhile. A great stout that I plan to sample on tap to compare the difference very drinkable if this is what your'e into and believe me I am."
"Nearly black, with ruby highlights forming a firm, whipped-egg consistency, light-tan head with nice head retention, perched atop small to medium-sized bubbles and moderate carbonation. Lacing is just adequate. Aroma is rich with sharply fruity cascade hops, dark coffee, and deeply roasted grains. Mouthfeel is initially medium-soft with a medium-dense body and then a harsh finish. Taste starts out with dark coffee, then gives way to a ton of Cascade flavor hops, a brief, subtle alcoholic note, some more Cascade, and then finishing with a long, dry, and harsh black patent/roasted barley character with mildly astringent, yet potently bitter hops. The hops become more pronounced with subsequent sips, and the malts become a tad sweeter as it warms. Completely out-of-balance with itself...the potential for complementary flavors is high, but instead succumbs to cacophony. Acrid, over-hopped, and over-roasted to be pleasant. Next beer, please."
"This is a heckuva good stout, and it's going down well with some smoked liverwurst and cheese."
"Pours ultra dark and is nearly pure black. It pours with a nice thick very tan head. The nose is a tad bit weak. Very bitter and hoppy taste followed up by strong and sweet malt mingled with hints of smoke followed up by a bitter aftertaste. The aftertaste gives it a bit of an ugh factor on the finish."
"Had a wonderful chance to savor this brew while watching my favorite B-Ball team ""The Lakers"" beat the Pistons. The look is real dark, ruby, having the right hint of that dark coffee look to it.Head was light but perfect for my drinking style. The smell was rich coffee, hints of toffee, mild chocolate, MMM Roasted Malt. The taste is a roasted heaven with dessert choco, coffee, and once again MMMM rosted malty goodness that satisfied my tummy after my big meal. The the mouthfeel was great, this in combination with the drinkablity (having a good ABV) will be a sure contender for my stout loving chugging ways."
"This one poured a general black color with tiny hints of ruby and a thickly creamy lightish tan head which left lacing here and there on my glass. Aroma is of roast malt, some mocha present, but nothing more than you'd expect from a good stout. Carbonation level is fairly moderate, and the palate is generally pleased with the oak aged feel in the mouth. I have yet to find a Sierra Nevada product I dislike."
"A good beer. It's not a ""bowl you over"" type of stout, but it is still very delicious."
"This stout poured a solid black with a half inch cream colored head that lasted through most the brew. The aroma was hard to detect, there was a some roasted malt and not much else. The taste is well balanced with a slightly bitter finish. It's hard for me to pick out any specific flavors. There is nothing overpowering about the taste. The mouthfeel is light to medium with a smooth finish. Not a bad stout."
"Overall, a great brew, and my new ""session Stout""."
"Cheers"
"It has a rich nearly black color and pours a big beige/brown head. A heavy lace is left on the glass. A small amount of yeast may be discovered at the bottom of the glass. Its aroma is rich in roasted malts and dull hops. Flavor is much the same but has more of a 'hoppy' element than its smell reflects. Roasted malts are the strongest flavor but there is elements of dark chocolate as well. This is a relatively bitter stout. It has a nice body--full but not ultra heavy, carbonation seems a little heavy though. But, this is a very drinkable brew none the less. I could easily quaff a sixer of these in an evening."
"Soft Cascades greet the nose as soon as the bottle is opened. It pours an opaque black body topped by a foamy light tan head that holds well and leaves nice lace throughout the glass. As it warms, the nose also reveals some chocolatey and roasty malt. The medium body is enhanced by a very fine carbonation from bottle conditioning that tingles the tongue! The flavor is quite intense; loaded with such deep, sharp roasted character (low pH), citrusy hop flavor, and yeasty fruitiness that it almost seems tart at the first sip. But it's decidedly bittersweet with more dark caramel, chocolate, and bold bitterness appearing as it warms. It's surprisingly complex with the Cascades remaining in the nose and making occasional appearances in the flavor. It finishes quite dry with a lingering chocolate/roast maltiness that fades to reveal rising bitterness and an eventual residual shadow of Cascade hop flavor. Well-balanced and complex. This is clearly an overlooked gem in the Sierra Nevada crown."
"I sampled a few bottles with two being quite hoppy and one not being that way at all. I guess I liked the hoppy version because it was significantly different that traditional stout. But this makes it hard to review, becuase which on am I reviewing? Anyway, a good looking beer, black with a reddisy hue on the fringes. Full biege head. Smooth rich roast and dark malt flavors, sometimes balanced nicely with Am. style hops. Excellent mouthfeel. A very good beer either way."
"This beer is virtually black and pours with a dense, rocky head that is a bit lighter than wet sand. It displays very good retention and leaves a nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is very fruity, with a strong Cascade-type grapefruit hop smell and a touch of malty chocolate. The first sip reveals noticeable hop bittering, followed by some roasted coffee and a touch of chocolate. A bit of grainess is noticeable as well. Later sips reveal more plum/raisin fruits and the accompanying sweetness. The finish is rather clean, and is punctuated by some good hop bitterness. The aftertaste is a bit of coffee, a bit of chocolate, and a touch of citrus. With a creamy mouthfeel and good drinkability, this is a very solid stout. My second favorite Sierra Nevada brew, behind Celebration."
"What can I say. I've been drinking their Pale Ale for years. My daughter told me to try this stuff. All I can say is that I love it. Great tan head which sticks around the whole time. Dark, hoppy, and bitter. The malts kick in with toasty flavor. Now on my regular beer stop list. I always have a case in the fridge. To sum it up, these guys hit one out of the park with this one."
"Whew! I've been putting off drinking this for a long time. Poured jet black with a brown film on the edges and a beautiful tan head. It tasted very hoppy to me, which was no surprise but as I drank more, the malt and hops blended perfectly along with a nice bitter coffee flavor. Mouthfeel was excellent, just the right amount of carbonation. Great stout, great glass of beer!"
"The taste starts slightly sweet with carmels and burnt sugars. Absolutely thick with roasted chewy barley malts with a nice bitter hop bite in the finish. Slightly acidic like a good espresso. There's simply loads of flavor in this beer. A true stout through and through and one of my favorite beers. Those guys up in Chico really can't some to do anything wrong, as far as I'm concerned."
"Oh yes, it has that brooding deep brown to black color I so admire, the head portly, the texture creamy and rich chocolate in color with thick sticky old sheets of lace that virtually plaster themselves to the glass. Nose is toasted grains, caramel, malt, the front is sweetly malt, the top thick and chewy with a pertinent acidic bite the hops masterful in their presence and to seal it off a dry bittersweet aftertaste that lingers on, and to my palate one ""Damn"" decent stout."
"The full, thick head is light brown with some interesting darker spots and edges. And, happily, it sticks around for quite some time. Like all Sierra beers, there is a noticeable (almost spicy) hops presence, both in the nose and on the palate. But the complex roasted malts take center stage, with hints of alcohol, espresso and molasses, and with contrasting elements of sweetness and bitterness at the finish. The mouthfeel is rich and full, but still quite smooth. A unique, well-balanced and challenging stout."
"Damn. I put off trying this one for a long time. After growing up on their pale ale, Sierra Nevada simply wasn't the first name to come to mind when I thought ""stout."" Serves me right for being narrow-minded, I guess. This beer pours jet black in color with a very thin, very dark tan head. The aroma is grainy and rich, with very subtle fruit notes. Very slight alcohol nose as well. And of course, it wouldn't be Sierra Nevada without a noticeable hop boquet. Flavor is rich and roasty. Quite full-bodied, with a great bitterness from the combined hops and burnt malt. Finishes dry with a great bitter aftertaste which hangs around for a while. Quite a few steps up from Guinness in terms of aggressiveness, but the bitterness here is by no means off-putting. Great stout."
"Poured a dark, rich brown color with a tan head that lasted the whole time. Tasted of chocolate roasts & coffee, with a creamy feel to it. This is a VERY GOOD Stout, I've always been a Guinness man, but now I'll be adding SN Stout to the rotation."
"Dark black color, with a creamy tan head. Dark chocolate roasted aroma, medium body, bitter coffee and roasty malt flavor, this stout has a nice hop bite, finishes bitter, not the best stout, but still pretty good."
"Pours a rich dark black color with a thick and creamy tan colored head. Aroma is of roasted malts and grains with notes of burnt coffee. Very full bodied mouth feel with flavors of caramel, toffee, bitter chocolate, and dark fruits with a medium hop bitterness. A great wintertime brew."
"Sierra Nevada Stout:  Wow, was I impressed with this beer, it had a wonderful balance, with a smooth mouthfeel.  The color was a deep cordovan, with a thick tan head that lasted throughout, and coated the glass the whole way down.  Very well balanced with roasted malts dominant, but a fairly aggressive hops bite to keep the malts from going way over the top.  Extremely flavorful beer, with alcohol warmth.  Excellent and interesting beer."
"Pours black with tight head that dissipates rather quickly but laces all the way down the glass.  Nice, stoutish nose to this one with strong roasted and chocolate/coffee scents dominating.  The pour and smell seem to lack the creaminess that I appreciate in a balanced stout, but the taste says otherwise--hoppy crispness and bitterness after the initial roasted smoothness.  Unexpectedly nice mouthfeel and drinkability, particularly for a stout.  Like other Sierra Nevada fare, this beer probably is as good as a ""mainstream"" beer can be.  What it lacks in quirky uniqueness it makes up for in consistency and solid appeal."
"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve ounce bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Nearly pitch black with a beige head which retains exceptionally.  Pleasant aroma of dark fruit, prune to be exact, combined with a nice fresh hoppy aroma.  Roasted grain and hops combine in a coffee and rind-like bitterness on the palate.  Dark chocolate is underneath rounding out the flavor well.  Creamy yet tingly mouthfeel.  Finish is a bit on the dry side.  A good stout with good balance."
"I found this to be an excellent Stout, pours almost black with a thin head. Nice dry roasted/coffee flavor and pleasant aftertaste. I enjoyed this one the entire glass. This is probably my favorite Sierra Nevada offering."
"5 Points, 5 Stars, 5 More please  for its not 1, but a 6-Pack for me next time."
"Black with a creamy tan head that has excellent retention, and generous lace. Grain and fruity aromas with hints of hops and rum. Creamy, full mouthfeel with roasted barley flavor.  A bit hoppy for a stout, but it handles the hops very well, not being overpowered. It has a nice dry finish."
"This is a really good American stout. Very robust and uncommonly hoppy. It has that signature SN cascades hop aroma. It tastes sharp and bitter, yet balanced enough to drink easily. I have some fond memories attached to drining this fine stout. Damn good stuff."
"Black as night with a thin tan creamy head that left excellent lacing.  The aroma was a sweet malt with roasty undertones.  The taste was chocolate, then roasted malt.  As it warms, the roasty malt comes through even more.  The carbonation was big and the flavor was long-lasting.  Not being a stout fan, this is an excellent beer, closer to a porter in flavor profile though."
"Not as sweet as I would have liked a Stout to be, but still worthy of your attention and lots of excellent flavor to keep anyone from boredom."
"As black as the last banana; looks like a Coca-Cola but with a longer-lasting head, which by the way held up admirably under my incessant swirlings while I tried to put a finger on what the fruity smells were. Roasted flavors are up front and hold on throughout. Malt and hops battle to a draw. While this is a nicely balanced stout, I personally find that the intense roasted flavors keep it from being very drinkable."
"A very drinkable stout, as with all Sierra Nevada products I've tasted, it has their characteristic hoppy flavor to it.  A good solid stout.  I would recommend it to anybody who likes stouts."
"Smooth, creamy and full-bodied - not a summer beer but good anyway.  Very dark (not black) with a roasted flavor. Good head that stays and good carbonation."
"A stronger aftertaste that I would prefer, but I'd drink another one."
"Black and nearly opaque brew. Awesome head with thick foamy tan lace decorating the sides of the glass as it's emptied. Dark roasted malt, espresso and dark chocolate notes blend masterfully to produce a near perfect balance. The hops flex a little muscle for a well calculated contribution. Smooth with good drinkability. Well done SN."
"This beer pours a very dark ruby and throws out a great creamy brown head.  Very nice roasted chocolate and burnt malt tones on the nose.  Nice tasting stout here.  Great java tones and mocha.  Nice little bitterness coming from the burnt malt tones.  Smooth mouthfeel and medium body.  Solid effort."
"This beer poured a nice dark color.  It formed a small dark tan head that didnt' hold and didn't leave any lace.  Maybe I had it too cold.  Has an aroma of roasted/burnt? malt and coffee.  The taste had elements of coffee and chocolate.  A medium body to it.  Not as heavy as some of the other stouts I have had.  Nice flavor, but still prefer others to this one."
"Not Impressed - There is something lacking in this brew. Short in finish, with very little flavor of chocolate and plums. Not for me."
"black with a nice tan head which sticks nicely.  roasted malt along with the signature SN hops in the nose tells me i'm in for a real treat.   full bodied in the mouth....taste is of bitter burnt malt which imparts some choco and java notes.  the cascade hops assert themselves but don't overwhelm, proving the stout style can handle those northwest hops.  a hophead stout for sure.  in comparison to rogue shakespeare stout, i'm not sure which is better, but they're very similar.  an excellent brew."
"Pours blacker than black with a great two finger tan head that last all the way down and rings the glace.  Smells of roasted malts, coffee, slight chocolate, and bitter hops dominate.  Taste starts off with some roasted malts which then changes to a coffee flavor with a faint bitterseet chocolate taste in the background.  Great bittering hops make this truly an american stout.  Nicely creamy and extremely drinkable.  This is a great american stout, right up there with Rogue's Shakespeare."
"Hoppy bitter, roasted malt nose with a touch of sweetness.  Untraditional, but great smell.  Black/opeque color with a nice tan head.  Not an imperial, sweet, or classic stout in style but it borrows nicely the good traits from each.  This brew is the stout for the hop lover...  Very drinkable for the stout family."
"Dark, lets a touch of light through.  Cottonly, small-bubbled one inch head.  Aroma a little like plum sauce (that shows up in the taste, see below)...Slightly winey and the deep roasted malts retain a touch of plum as well.  Acidic and dry finish, but flavor fade seems very fast.  There's something strange in the balance to me, too much spicy hop or something (Rogue Shakespeare does it right).  Mouthfeel adequate, but then again, off tastes and quick fade.  Good enough but ordinary in a weird way.  Sierra Nevada Stout joins the Pale Ale in the ""over rated"" category, in my mind."
"Billowing tan head. Wonderful coffee aroma, burnt malty flavor initially. Unlike many stouts this is not smooth or silky, but quite sharp with a distinct West Coast bite. This is due to the familiar Sierra Nevada hops, and this is what gives the beer such great character. Even so, it is remarkably balanced and the slick oily mouthfeel gives way to a wonderful finish. This is a healthy and complex brew; there's a lot is going on here, making each sip a treat, even if the beer is not as compulsively drinkable as some of the most addictive brews."
"Huge tan rocky head, cascading micro-bubbles. Black body with ruby red highlights. Chocolate in the nose. Hint of alcohol in nose, more noticeable to taste. Mouthfeel a touch thinner than many stouts. Hops noticeable, a bite across the tongue.  Solid, but not as spectacular as I remembered."
"and high hop bitterness coalesce well. The flavor is akin to dark chocolate.  The finish is dominated by hop bitterness and a roasted barley dryness.  If this stout had just a bit more body, it would be absolutely superlative.  Anyway, this is an outstanding example of an assertive west coast stout, and is probably the best widely distributed stout available in the U.S.  Just a notch below Willy Shakes.  Cascade hops really can work in a stout!"
"The looks alone will get your mouth watering.  It is a very dark beer with a 3 finger tan head with staying power.  Strong hop aroma with hints of chocolate.  The taste pretty much backs up the looks with roasted coffee and chocolate and strong hop bitterness.  The hop bitterness is borderline overwhelming, but I'm turning into a hop-head, so I like it.  Great brew from S.N!  Cheers!"
"Overall I like this beer, it pours to deep dark black with a nice full tan head, however I thought the head settled rather quickly for a stout. The smell seemed a little stronger and harsher than I anticipated. The first taste however more than made up for that. I found strong burnt malt, coffee taste and really nice strong finish. The feel is about right, maybe a little thinner than I expected, but the taste makes up for that again.This one seemed to start strong but fade toward the bottom of the glass.  Still a winner, it's my 2nd of 6 I'll probably try a different stout when I restock my supply."
"Top of the line stout with wide-reaching appeal. Drinkability is up there with the best of them."
"One of my all time favourite stouts, I could drink this morning, noon or night. Yet it is a perfect lunch time beer to pair up with a hearty corned beef on rye sandwich."
"Head retention is great.  Nice hopped aroma.  Rich roasted flavor with chocolate overtones balanced with hops.  Nice hoppy aftertaste.  A great Stout!"
"Very robust with a big roasted malt character, but finishes fairly dry.  A quality product - glad the ABV is not higher, because one of these is not enough."
"Notes: One of our favourite stouts; a well balanced brew showing both malt and hop complexities without one being the more dominant."
