"Coffee flavor had a bit of a darker, sat in the pot too long taste.  Mouth feel was not too thin but okay.  Overall, decent but I'm not sure if I'm assuming s coffee crime stout should taste the same as founder breakfast stout?  Maybe I'm insure what exactly a coffee cream stout should taste like. Over all okay."
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A nice coffee stout from Short's, perhaps a bit too charred, burnt and roasted for my palate, but certainly enjoyable. A little smoothness and a touch of body at the finish would do this beer wonders."

"Great overall coffee flavor."

"Overall this was an outstanding coffee stout.  It made me question whether this was actually a beer or coffee.  Great balance and full of coffee flavor.  Probably one of the best Short's has to offer."

"An excellent coffee beer from Shorts. Beautiful tan brown with a frothy mocha head. The nose is freshly brewed coffee. Body and mouthfeel satisfying without being overly thick or syrupy. Great breakfast time beer or one for when you are flagging during a session."

"A solid beer overall."
""
""
""
"Overall, the massive coffee aroma is intoxicating and when paired with a creamy chocolate and roasted malt taste, the beer really separates itself. Founders Breakfast Stout sit down, Cup a Joe is the clear Michigan made coffee stout king."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - With Spruce Pilsner, this is an annual highlight in the Short catalog"
"O: This is one of the best coffee stouts around, better than Founder's Breakfast Stout and a respectable second to Terrapin Wake-N-Bake. Incredibly rich coffee aromas and flavor."

"Cheers!"
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/2/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge roasted coffee bean, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, char, toast, cream, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with big coffee presence and great complexity of roasted malt/cream notes; with great strength. Taste of roasted coffee bean, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light char, cream, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, toast, cream, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of coffee, roasted malt, and cream flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome coffee stout! All around great balance and complexity of coffee, roasted malt, and cream flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"It’s a flat coffee black in appearance. Smell’s like today’s dark roast, after sitting out and warming all day. It has a strong, overpowering and harsh coffee flavor. Again, the burnt coffee notes come out. I had a taster and could barley finish this. Don’t think I’m up for a full pint. Short’s beers tend to be a love-it or hate-it kind of thing, but usually I’m in the former camp. Not this time, though."
""
""
"O - Another homerun from Short's. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"O-One of the best beers I have had from Shorts, the bitter roasted malts and coffee are well balanced by the lactose sugars. Really creamy, almost like a mochaccino, some lingering sweetness and coffee flavors. Just a really delicious beer."
"O- I enjoyed this beer being a fan of coffee, but would have had it a little higher if it were a little creamier"
"Finally, a Shorts beer I can cozy up to. A solid OK offering from this brewery, which is a first for me. Pours a dark caramel brown into my Founders snifter with a dark brown head that quickly fades a leaves minimal lacing. I definitely pick up the coffee flavor, maybe a bit of french roast. A slightly bitter coffee taste that only slightly detracts from the drinkability. A solid mouth feel but not chewy enough for my tastes. Overall a solid offering from Shorts. It's about time for a brewery that gets as much praise as they do."
""
""
""

"A little more than your average coffee beer. The espresso really comes through in the nose to start but more of a floral bouquet of coffee. It starts off creamy and coffee and remains until the end. A nice acidity from the coffee is present as well. Super solid and am glad I was able to snag a few bottles."
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty good milk stout with big roasted coffee flavor. Excellent morning beer."
""
"O- One of the best Short's brews I've had, really starting to come around on them lately. A bit of a one note beer and not as complex as FBS but still wonderful. I feel really lucky to be able to get two great coffee stouts so fresh, when the coffee flavor is at it's peak."
""
"O: A must try. If I find this on draft I just might sleep on the floor of the establishment thats serving it..? Maybe not. But it is excellent. And I feel like this beer could be sessioned.. maybe paired with a good book or something of that nature."
""
""
""
""
"Cheesy? Don't care. Just drink it, damn you."
""
""
""
""
"O- Never really found Cup A Joe to be a balanced beer. For a milk stout, it isn't that sweet. For a coffee stout, it's rather bland. Every year I keep hoping they'll tweak it and nail it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I was blown away by how good this beer was. Hits all the high points of a coffee stout. The coffee isn't overpowering while maintaining a bold, charred character. Well done."
""
""
""
""

"Living in Michigan definitely has its perks. Being able to drink Short's on tap is definitely one of them. I would go so far as to say that this is one of the best 7% coffee stouts I have had. However, the bottle I had was absolutely putrid. It was not old but had clearly refermented into an undrinkable mess. Drinking Short's on tap is the only way to go."
""

""

""

"Pour is jet black with virtually no head. Nose is a bit artificial, artificial vanilla, overly sweet malt an sugar, and used coffee grounds. Taste is just as bad, overly sweet, under attenuated malt and coffee mess. Virtually no carb and extremely oily and slick feel."
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice coffee stout, not upper rung, but right on the heels of them"

"The beer pours motor oil black with a razor thin tan head that dissipates. There is very little lacing or head retention. The nose emanates a potent, bitter coffee with a touch of sweetness. The beer drinks like a cup of coffee with a touch of milk, leaving a roasty, slightly bitter aftertaste. There is almost no distinctly hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, oily, sweet and roasty. It definitely a coffee cream stout with a great body and a sweet, effervescent finish. Worth trying and it definitely lives up to my expectations."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very good coffee beer. Pretty straight forward coffee beer but damn good."
""
"Fun one to try, would love to have it again. Thanks Adam!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really nice brew. Coffee is QUITE heavy but is tasty and melds well with the cream stout characteristics. If it weren't so coffee dominant I'd give it even better ratings. Definitely a must-have for the coffee lover, especially if you take yours with cream."
"O - Shorts certainly has a skill for making beers which meet their descriptions. While this beer lacks the flavors and aromas that I would normally associate with a stout, this is spot on like a good cup of coffee with some cream. Phenomenal execution!"

"I've had this on bottle and tap. Certainly better on tap, but amazing either way. I'm a huge fan of stouts and I drink coffee like crazy, so naturally I have an affinity to coffee-stouts. This stout is better than most people give it credit for, so if you see it (and you like coffee), make sure you give it a shot."
"This isn't really doing it for me. Comes off a bit too bitter and somewhat tangy with a flavor ride that doesn't last that long. Or not long enough, imo. Body is nice. Still an okay beer, especially after it warms up a bit. Maybe I've had too many coffee beers until now and I have certain expectations."
"Taste has more roasty coffee, dark chocolate and a light sourness. Medium light body, but perhaps a tad on the watery side. A good creamy coffee beer, but there are some imperfections evident."
"O: Short's is spot on with this offering. What a beer!"
""
"Deep brown and near black in colour, ring of tan head, little to no lace left behind. Smell is roasted with lots of coffee, a bit of chocolate, lightly lactic as well and a little metallic, light alcohol. Taste is creamy with lots of bitter chocolate and black coffee and coffee grinds, roasty and a bit lactic with some smoke in the finish as well. Medium-light carbonation, medium body, decent feel. Taste and feels much better than the way it smells at first, lots of coffee in here, not the best coffee beer I have had but still quite good."

"Thanks Namarsha82!"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is pretty average overall. Really interesting, but just not really anything special."
"Overall I have had a lot of coffee stouts and also milk stouts but this one is one of the better ones. To those with low reviews it must have been a bottle not refrigerated and to those in Michigan I still can not believe you can just buy this off the shelf! Damn good stout!"
""
""
""
"This is so close to being a superb coffee stout, though some slightly off-putting aspects of the flavor and aroma hold it back."
""
""
""
"O: B+ for me on this one. It's a solid coffee stout, but in that arena I don't think you are going to sway me from FBS or W&B."
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter. Pours opaque and oily black with a thin tan head that recedes to a very thin collar of lace. The nose is very freshly roasted and earthy coffee along with some molasses and burnt brown sugar and light nuttiness. The flavor is more acidic than the nose would have suggested, but with all of the same roasted coffee, molasses, and nutty qualities. The body is medium with light carbonation and a very long roasted coffee finish."
""
""
"D: Just a touch too much of a sweet, desert type beer to really grab the next higher score. But it is very close. Looks nice, smells great, tastes good, and it is a tad “more filling” – but oh well. A burly & robust & dark & sweet desert beer. Very nice."
"Overall, this is a really coffee forward brew that has a great nose and taste but the mouthfeel could be a bit thicker for sure."
""
""
"Midnight black and pours like motor oil. Nice tan/cocoa head on top. Great espresso aroma-really stands out in a big way. Heavy roasted malts up front with a very strong coffee flavor. Long, lingering coffee taste, with a decent sweetness as well. Nice mouthfeel-a bit prickly on the tongue. Really a nice coffee beer all in."
"Overall I have heard of this one for quite a while so when it showed up as an extra I was really excited to try it. IMO it doesn't live up to the hype but if you get the chance to pick one up at a reasonable price it's worth the time. Thanks to McNuts for the extra."
""
""
""
"This was an ok beer for me. There isn't much depth to the flavors or aromas. They seem as if they could be a bit bolder and fuller. Definitely not up with the best of the coffee stouts but overall it's a decent one."
"Creamy coffee and chocolate with a touch of lactic acid. A nice coffee cream stout but probably not one that I would attempt to cellar, I could see the lactic notes taking over."
"O - This is my favorite beer from Shorts so far. This beer is a little past its prime, but fresh, it is awesome."
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, but the sourness of it sticks to me like a sore thumb. The nose promises wonderful robust coffee and then the flavor delivers an odd, sour finish that contrasts sharply with the other characters of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This has good drinkability. I could drink a few of these in a sitting. Overall, I thought that this was a really nice and interesting stout. You really get what the name says in this one. There is a ton of coffee presence, as well as some cream. I really enjoyed it and I recommend trying it, unless you dislike coffee flavor in your stouts."
"In the world of coffee stouts, this is a really nice one. It's smooth and creamy and the transitions are well done to the point where this is a beer latte more than just coffee flavored beer. The milk sugar is done excellently, it does more to diversify and enhance the flavor profile rather than to just provide ""sweetness"". Again, this one wins as being much more than tasting like just a stout with coffee."
""
"Drink- This was one of the better coffee stouts that I have had. Nice depth of flavor and good profile. Really packed a coffee punch behind it. Very enjoyable."
""
""
"Appearance is black, opaque, and a slight tan head that lines the glass. Smells of strong coffee and chocolate. It's very roasty, and robust. It has a stronger coffee flavor and smell than the Java Stout, which I was surprised by. Mouthfeel is heavy and smooth. Nicely carbonated. After trying FBS, Java and now Cup a Joe, I like FBS first, Cup A Joe second and Java Stout third. They're all great beers!"
"UPDATE- 2012, This years release doesn't seem as heavy on the milk sugar and cream flavor, it's just about as good, but I think I like the 2011 release slightly more, the score stays the same."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This one is alright I guess, but for a coffee stout, it doesn’t quite live up to expectations. It’s definitely got the cream and lactose areas covered, but for a coffee stout, I expected to taste a bit more of that element throughout the beer. Worth checking out, but like may Short’s beers, not worth going crazy for. Give it a go if you can easily find it."
""
"O - This was good. Something in the latter half of the drink that is off-putting. Can't get over the creamy sweetness there... hmm."
""
"Overall: If you're a coffee drinker, this is a must have! Flavors come out perfect without a harsh after taste."
"Overall: If you like strong coffee you must seek this beer. I'm a huge milk stout fan so this beer is right up my ally. I've had many coffee beers before but this one is unlike all others I've had. This is a coffee bomb. Fantastic beer and can't wait for my next one! Thanks Shorts!"
"O - This one certainly doesn't disappoint. Bold coffee stout that is both tasty and very drinkable. I know it's brand spanking new, but the guys at Short's should seriously start thinking about putting dates on the bottles. Just saying."
""
"O-As delicious and aromatic as this is, I can only drink a few a season. I do enjoy FBS more and can session that (I can) but this is one intense coffee stout. Tasty but not an everyday beer."
""
""
""
"Please sir may I have some more."

"Overall, this beer is pretty fantastic. I have two more bottles; one of which I will have around the holidays, and the other I think I will save for the end of the world (12.21.12, that is)."
"O: Overall I was expecting a lot more from this one The burnt coffee flavor is pretty off putting. All in all not a bad beer but not impressive either. Glad I got to try it either way. 3.5"
"O - Underwhelming brew for sure! I expected a lot more out of this one. But for a coffee stout, it's nice."
"Overall: If nothing else mattered, I would have a stockpile of this beer and start every day with one or two. Lovely stuff here."
"Overall this really missed its mark. It really tastes like the brew is infected. The aroma and the taste are totally different. I like the coffee aromas but the sour taste and mouthfeel really ruins this beer."
"O- This is pretty damn awful!!! Raisin and bitter coffee is not what you wanna wake up too, or say goodnite with!!! I feel like putting a drop or two of coffee creamer in it just to make it drinkable!"
"Thanks to pocwolf for sending this as an extra! Definitely a delicious treat and very drinkable."
"O: I used to think that most of Shorts brews were infected, and I guess most are. However, they did a brewery takeover at Churchkey here in DC last month, I sampled tons of their brews, and I'm now think that the sourness is just part of their taste profile. What do you think?"
"Overall- I am very impressed by this one, this is a nice sweet, milky, sugary stout that is not overly bitter on the coffee but on the contrary it was like I went to McDonalds and bought an iced coffee, it was just so well balanced and perfect on the palate, the smells are not overly complex but this one really shines through in the tastes. A great beer that was picked up at a great price and I would definitely pick this one again once I run out. Congrats Short’s this one is definitely a winner in my books."
"O- Very surprising, not the biggest coffee fan, but this was tasty, very roasty, love the strong coffee taste."
"Not bad, but I'll admit that I take my coffee black. Milk stouts have never been my thing, but this is certainly ranking above most of them."
"Some coffee lovers might like it, but in my opinion, if I want pure and simple coffee, I would have, well, coffee."
"4/3/3/3.5/2.5"
"M - Light to medium body; light carbonation."
"Note: I noticed this one was turning for the worse back in February, so not surprising to see the recent bad reviews. Guess anything with lactose should be consumed fresh."
"Overall very well done by Shorts."
"O: This beer is well made and fits the style. It just didn't offer me anything I loved."
"All in all this is a good brew. If it was around me I would probably pick it up from time to time."
"Hopefully this was an anomaly."
"O: I was really disappointed. Seeing this beer made me excited to try it and it was so disappointing when I had to drain pour it. I'm wondering why it still has an A- average."
"The look and viscosity were good, the whole coffee aspect of this was bad though(i am a coffee geek). Can i assume they added the coffee during the boil for extraction? I don't know, but that's what it tastes like, and it turned out bad."
"Pours a motor oil black with the faintest whisper of a foam head - appears to be a very low level of carbonation. Nose has freshly brewed drip coffee, cinnamon sugar doughnuts, as well as spent coffee grinds and sweet non dairy creamer. Really a nicely put together aroma. Taste is almost sour/bitter coffee, really unpleasant compared to how nice the nose was. Sour red fruits as well but the low level of carbonation really hurts the taste and drinkability."
"No bottled on date prevents me from knowing how old this is. Infection seems likely — but an unusual amount of powdered lactose also seems like a culprit."
"Overall - Certainly tasty and pretty easy to drink, since it's so thin. The lactose and intensity of the coffee are a turn-off, though."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: This one smelled great and for a second tasted really good. I bet if I had this fresh it would be one hell-of-a beer. Too bad this one wasn’t good."
"D - Probably won't even finish the sucker."
"OK, the taste of the beer is straight black olive. I love black olives, but damn….not in beer. There is a strong salty mid-palate flavor that is throwing the whole flavor profile off. That mixed with a strong espresso back-end, brought me back to the day of eating black olives from the can. Nothing like putting the pitted black olives on your fingers so you have olive fingers, and then eating them off! (Hey don’t judge me….I know you did it too!). Overall this is an interested black olive beer!"
"Decent beer that I would have again, but not worth seeking out."
"Overall: A Terrible beer that I would never recommend. Go get the Short's Mystery Stout."
"Pours jet black with a chocolate brown head. In the aroma, dry coffee and a nice roasted malt. In the taste, dry coffee and a sweet lactose or creaminess. Very similar to a cup of coffee. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry coffee and a small sweetness in the aftertaste. Like drinking a cold cup of coffee, a bit sweeter than I prefer in my coffee, but for the beer, it works nicely."
"Business travel means trying local beers, and after having a terrific Humalupalicious the other night, as a coffee enthusiast, stout enthusiast, and coffee stout enthusiast, I was looking forward to the bottle I picked up at Big Ten Party Store in Okemos, MI. Damnitall, this was a letdown. The funky whiff of scorched coffee resin emanating from the bottle was a warning shot. It was smooth in the mouth and had some good stout-y qualities, but my taste buds were battered by overwhelming burnt coffee, left-my-coffeemaker-on-all-day tones. Any other subleties in taste were blown away by the coffee. Cup a Joe was marginally finish-able, but not buyagain-able."
"Pours into a mug a dark black with a dark tan head that was almost non existant untill pour was agitated. Pretty standard looking for the style. Nose is the strongest coffee auroma I've ever gotten from a beer. There's also dark cocoa and a roasted note of a can of coffee beans. Taste is very bold and sweet. Heavy of the coffee flavour, a toasted bean taste that remains bitter and a sweet hint of milky sugar in the finish which ends creamy. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little underwhealming for a stout. Remains creamy throughout. Overall, for me this is an overdone coffee/cream stout, though I suppose that's why it's Imperial. If you like bold coffee notes this is certainly worth checking out; I'll stick with the more subtle coffee beers. Kudos to Shorts for doing an extreme beer - I respect that and remain curious about their other odd beers."
"drinkable - maybe just one or two."
"Scores: Appearance 3/5, Aroma 4/5, Taste 4/5, Mouthfeel 4.5/5, Overall 4.5/5"
"The mouth is overly-carbonated for the style. I like a bit more smoothness and heft. This one was bordering spritzy and thin. Eh. The flavor is where this fell flat. Some coffee is notes, but it is so overpowered by sourness, that I can't even begin to pull out other flavors. Chocolate? Not so much. Sweet cream? Nope. Sour vinegar? Bingo! That's it. ""Beer," meet drain. What a mess this was. I am honestly done with this brewery. There's only a few breweries overall that I will write off. This one made the list."
"After 5 try's, this beer still isn't what I hoped it would be. I could go for more carbonation, less sour/more bitter and a little thicker in body. Don't think I'll ever try this again unless it's on tap. Too many other coffee dominant beers I'd grab over this."
"Overall, not bad, the nose was great, but the acrid rotting coffee grind taste took away a bit. It's a pretty good beer, a slow sipper, but pretty good."
"Received this one in a recent trade (thanks FrankenBrew). Shared this with a couple of friends last Saturday night. Poured a deep, rich black color, with a little light brown head. Huge coffee aromas here, along with cream and dark chocolate. Medium to full bodied, with flavors of freshly pressed espresso, heavy cream, roasted malt and cocoa."
"Drink and overall: Very enjoyable. I will drink more of these. Not overly impressive, but solid none the less."
"The CPJ"
"More coffee comes out in the taste, lots of coffee actually. Lowly carbonated and light sweetness. Not much hop bitterness, but some roasty malt dries out the finish somewhat. Plenty of flavor, but the mouthfeel seems a bit thin. I enjoyed the beer, as I do most all coffee stouts, but this one is far from my favorite."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and smooth on the tongue. Really tasty drinking, and worked out well during brunch. I tried a ton of Short's beers over the weekend and this was definitely a solid one."
"Mouthfeel is good to go and this is a nice, easy, drinker. I could and would drink more of these..."
"Beer is medium to light in body and tastes like iced coffee. It's a little rough on the finish...but the lead off is nice and sweet, heavily bitter on the finish, very heavy. It's all roast and coffee. I enjoyed it but it's quite in your face with the coffee. It's a pretty good beer, grading on a curve with Short's one of their betters."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color, with a thin tan head that disappears quickly, and leaves an oily lace. The smell of this one is pure coffee. Roasted malts and toasted notes are present along with a dab of chocolate and caramel. I find this beer tastes very bitter... too bitter for me to love. Bitter coffee, bitter chocolate, roasted malts, and a touch of cream for an attempt at balance. The body is full and it has medium carbonation. Overall I found this beer too bitter but I feel like the coffee lover will find it amazing."
"D- I was really wanting to try this, and it was a huge letdown. I hear issues like this are common with Short's...a shame, because I've heard good things about this beer"
"D--Great to sample this, I would never actively seek it out again, but certainly worth trying if you can get it!"
"D: Can't taste the 8% at all. The lack of body though brings the drinkability down quite a bit for me"
"The taste is kinda weird. I can taste the usual stout roasted malts and roasted coffee beans. It tastes like strong coffee or used coffee grounds - I don't mean this in a bad way, also a little sweet. It seems a little watery compared to my expectations. There is little to no booze in the flavor. It feels nice and light in my mouth, with a little carbonation, but heavy on the flavor. I find this to be of about average drinkablity, the flavor is a little too odd and sweet to make me want to keep drinking this one."
"Overall this was a decent beer with some enjoyable flavors and I am glad to have tried it, but nothing in particular really stood out for me unfortunately."
"D - Well, it's ok."
"D: this beer feature nice notes from coffee, the milk sugar certainly makes things sweet, perhaps a touch too sweet. This one is worth a try."
"D - If it were socially acceptable, I'd drink this instead of coffee in the morning. The flavors are clean and delicious and I'd like to continue drinking this. Forever."
"As for ABV, there's no way I would have guessed this to be 8. It goes down like nothing. I could easily drink a few of these and get hit fast."
"Shorts- I raise this tulip to you."
"If you don't like coffee in your stout, then you would be best to shy away from this. If you do like that combination, then you should lie, cheat, steal or trade for some of this."
"I've been getting tired of some coffee stouts lately that are one dimensional astringent, burnt coffee assaults and the creme really helps smooth out that sensation in the flavor and balance to this. Still not overly complex, but very enjoyable and a new favorite coffee stout for me. Mouthfeel is very thick and smooth with light carbonation. I'm happy to have found another Short's beer I can get excited about."
"This is very smooth and creamy on the tongue. A pleasure to drink, and very little detectable alcohol. I would have guessed a much lower ABV for this beer."
"Drinkability: This one is quite good. I found that the sweetness was a bit much as I made my way through the beer. I like this but I don't know that I would seek it out again."
"Pours a nice black color, some carbonation, fizzy little tan head, with very minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is very nice, malty, with lot's of chocolate, coffee, and caramel. The taste is nice, sweet, malty, with loads of coffee/chocolate notes, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, I was expecting alot more from this brew with all the hype a year or two ago."
"D-very drinkable. I like this alot"
"Overall: I really like this beer, but you may not think it by the score. It kind of combines liabilities to create a great brew. The coffee flavor doesn't stand out, but that is OK because the sweetness combines well with it to create an almost desert in a bottle."
"Pours nice and dark out of the bottle. No head really to speak of on this one. Doesn't look particularly carbonated. Smells... Coffee... tons of roasted beans. Its like being in a coffee shop that does their own roasting! Tastes great. Usually I don't like coffee stouts because the coffee tastes are burnt (like starbucks) but this is smooth and well roasted. Really a great coffee flavour. A solid mouthfeel and very drinkable as well. Overall, one of Short's best beers!"
"I'm not a fan of people who misuse an ""a" for an ""o'", but hopefully the beer still tastes good. It pours a straight black-brown topped by a finger or so of light tan foam. The nose comprises coffee (and lots of it, son!), light cocoa, roasted malts, and brown sugar. The taste does not feel brave enough to deviate from this plan of attack. Some buttercream finds its way in there as well. In the finish, though, there is a definite feeling of acrid coffee, which VDubb helps me to understand as the aftertaste one would encounter in a bad cup o' coffee. The body is a competent medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a pretty nice stout, but that acrid aftertaste leaves something to be desired."
"This beer pours a deep blackness, there's pretty much no head on this beer though. This beer smell of coffee, surprise I know. This is deep and rich coffee on the nose, I do believe that behind the roast is some vanilla notes. The taste obviously is strong of coffee. There is a background flavor that is sugary and sweet. I must admit the almost too sweet aftertaste is rather off putting when combined with the rest of this beers flavor. It leaves that bad taste in my mouth that happens after drinking a cheap cup of coffee, perhaps some halitosis to go along with it. It's pretty nice for a beer to include such realistic coffee flavor, but overall it's not good coffee, so that's a real problem that I have with this beer."
"Not a bad brew, but the name was perhaps a little misleading in the amount of coffee in the flavor."
"D: i could drink this all night. a very good beer."
"this brew gets top grade for drinkability and mouthfeel also, its just so damn good. highly reccommended. make sure you let it warm up, and take your time enjoying it!"
"m/d-Great beer. Medium to light bodied and kind of watery without being bad. A touch bitter and bready but a really easy drinker. Light and fluffy for a normally dark and thick style. Would love to have this one again anytime."
"D: Would drink another"
"Mouthfeel is medium full with a nice creamy finish. Drinkability is decent for a stout of the ABV and body."
"Well on drink I'd say for an imperial stout it's a bit above average. On the everyday front I'd say this one is for drinking every now and then, or for sampling with friends at a dinner party. It's a fine beer indeed."
"For a stout boasting a lot of flavors, it's not terribly bold, but an easily drinkable and very enjoyable stout."
"A black beer with a tan head that left behind some spots. This smells strongly of coffee with some nice malts and roasted stuff. It tastes that way as well and I really like it. This is one of the better shorts beers. Would drink and recommend again."
"D- This beer was very drinkable to me. I like cold coffee and coffee in just general. The ABV was so well hidden that I never really tasted it at all to be honest. Short's makes a damn good beer that tastes like it says it is. My only complaint like everyone else with Short's is getting better head retention on these beers."
"I'm not a fan of coffee stouts, but this is alright as far as they go. I would say that I prefer Founder KBS to this. The acidity of the coffee really ruins it. If they were able to get a better coffee taste into the beer without so much acidity, it would be much better. The key is to not brew with drip coffee, but a well-pulled espresso, where you get the nuance of the bean without the acidity."
"This beer pours a midnight black with a light khaki head. It smells of bitter chocolate. It has the superb chocolate you would hope for. It wreaks of coffee and chocolate. It is the perfect mix. it tastes wonderful, smells wonderful, feels perfect. This is a quality offering from Shorts."
"Overall, i would heartily recommend this beer to those who love imperial stouts, and a good, full-bodied coffee with cream and sugar. Its definitely got character, robust flavor, and a unique combination of a familiar breakfast beverage paired with an evening one. Plus, the coffee comes from an awesome Michigan company that roasts their own beans on premises."
"I had very high hopes for this one, but the coffee flavor was a bit underwhelming and sweeter than I expected. It is a good beer nonetheless and something I would drink again."
"First sip is absolutely yum. The acidic mix of coffee and darker stout blend together to make something not quite coffee not quite stout all around awesome. Mouthfeel is rich and chewy and quite delicious. This is a great beer."
"This is very drinkable, but not the most intriguing double stout I've had."
"Drinkability- other than the mouthfeel, this brew is very drinkable... but I can't drink a flat beer."
"Bottle pours the color of oil with reasonable head. Wow, looks good. Smell of coffee and roast. Medium mouthfeel. Definitely notice the milk sugar. A bit sweet, but not too much. Taste is lactic coffee - the perfect merger of a milk stout and a coffee stout. This is a really tasty, drinkable beer. One of the best bottled Short's offerings I have had."
"Very good java stout. Can enjoy several in one sitting. The aftertaste is a little too bitter but isn't that strong of a negative. Worth buying again."
"This is a drinkable, pretty original stout that I will have again. My only real critiques are that the body is a little thin and that the lactic sweetness highjacks the coffee and malt boldness. I like my coffee black, though, so that might explain why I disagree with the cream flavor a bit. Really, though, this is another fine offering from Shorts and probably my favorite stout that they make."
"Overall, interesting as hell, but for me more of a novelty. Not a typical imperial stout in any regard, but an accomplishment for sure. Wouldn't seek out more of it, although very glad to have tried it."
"Easy drinker, delicious. Another quality Short's product."
"Notes: This is one of the best imperial stouts that I have ever had in my life. As far as beers containing coffee is concerned this is the best beer I have ever had. A great, great beer. Highly recommend trying this one if you can get your hands on it."
"Overall: Like I mentioned before, I love the consistency. I was expecting a gritty, chewy beer, but this is a little thinner, and very easy to drink (chug). I rarely drink more than two coffee beers in a night, but I think I could take on this whole six pack tonight."
"Pours black black black with brown head. Minimal lacing, and completely opaque. Smell is incredibly strong with dark roast coffee, dark chocolate. Taste is delicious, with bold coffee flavor and dark chocolate bitterness. I do wish they would not have used lactose in this as I think it makes the stout too sweet, and I wish the finish was dryer. There is no hop presence whatsoever. Body is big and think with little carbonation. The more I drink it the more I wish it wasn't so sweet. It's not something I could have much of, and I wish there was a little more bitterness to counteract the sweetness."
"D- This really comes across as a good imperial milk/coffee stout. The alcohol is very well hidden and this is a very tasty well done, tasty brew from shorts."
"Notes: VERY disappointed. not like last years. the color and smell got me hard and then i tasted it. still giving it high points but it defintely deserves a low score merely for the fact of the inconsistancy"
"Drinkability: Great. High. It's very tasty, and the high ABV means a 6-pack would last you a proverbial minute. Very good brew here."
"Not going to be able to take more than 2-3 ounces of this one. Too bad, because the nose, & the initial hit on the tongue, were extremely promising. Down the drain it goes."
"Drinkability: This was my first (hopefully not my last) Short's beer. I really want to get some more of this, as it was one of the best smelling beers I've ever had, and tasted really good as well. Never would have guessed 8%."
"Poured a dark as night black with ruby highlights that had a half finger of brown head and left a little bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aromas was quite pleasent consisting of roasted chocolate malts, toasty grains, slight sweet cream, and for sure some coffee notes. There was also some noticeable booze but was not potent. Upfront on the palate the roasted chocolate malts and coffee really come together quite well with toasty grain accents and slight booze. The only bad thing was that I did detect some slight tart flavor that I believe is a result of the infection this beer been tainted with; what a shame. The brew was medium in body with a relative high amount of carbonation which had a sweet, roasty, slight astringent, and tart finish. It drank good but was dissapointed on the infectious qualities this beer had. This the second shorts beer that has been infected but trully believe it had lots of potential without the sourness; too bad"
" The flavor is good and wierd all wrapped together like a flavored tootsie roll. The dark cherry notes and mild woody flavors from the stout come forward at first and later a tannic tinge of raw astringent coffee beans w/a slight golden raisin and subtle cocoa note. The light toasted tinge of caramel malt softens the fruitiness slightly. I was perplexed but happy with the beer -not like any coffee brew or stout I have had, and no, it did not have a ring in the neck or smell off at all, so I am going to assume it was untainted. This is a quality coffee brew from Shorts- very drinkable."
"This is another clearly infected brew that works better than it actually should. Again, if you are open to the experience then give it a go, but if you are looking for a Coffee Crème Stout then look else-where."
"Pours a ridiculously nice looking mocha brown and then gets darker. Head forms quick. The nose is slightly off. Here is when it goes down the drain...if you know what I mean. Sour. Disasterous. Starts creamy and a millisecond later it is just acidic and sour. Another beer I want to keep drinking in the hope that the flavor will just change, but alas, to the drain we go."
"D- Did not finish, which is rare. I had maybe 4 sips and had to put it down. Would love to try a non-infected bottle, I hear these things happen w/ Shorts. I'll re-review if needed."
"Bottle. Pours an extremely dark brown color with a nice big tan head. The aroma is amazing on this one! Strong notes of coffe, dark chocolate, vanilla, and an almost leathery smell (in a good way). The taste is like drinking a cold dark roast coffee with a shot of espresso. The coffee takes center stage and ends with a slight bitterness followed by an almost milk chocolate flavor. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Good carbonation."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a higher than anticipated level of carbonation. The level of tartness is very out of place for the style and I cannot finish the glass. I really want to get my hands on another one of these incase this particular sample was infected. From the initial aroma and the flavor (looking past the tartness) this could be a fantastic brew. I will seek out another sample and edit this review accordingly."
"d - I thought this was a very good stout. I loved the smell and was very happy to find it wasn't just dominated by coffee; it was very balanced. I wish the taste had been a little sweeter as opposed to bitter, but it was still very enjoyable. Would love to have again."
"Pours a dark black color, with a brown fizzy head that goes away in a second. No shot at lacing. I was exited for a moment a the look, and then it was gone. Smells powerfully ofsweetened coffee, almost as if there's nothing else there. A little chocolate comes through, but there's not a whole lot of complexity to be found. The taste comes up slightly fruity, like plums or a little grape-y, but the roasted coffee is still predominant, with s nice little kick of sweetness to finish - though I'd say the sweetness starts to catch on a bit more as the drink goes on. Not impressive, but not too bad. The body is pretty good. Nice and creamy, a little on the heavy side of medium, with a nice little kick of carbonation. Pretty good. Overall, this is a decent beer. I think it's kind of average though - it's got it's highs and lows, but I don't know if I would come back to it, without some significant improvements."
"D: The alcohol is hidden very well in this beer, but the sourness limits its drinkability a bit in my book. Really glad to have tried this one though, and will never forget its incredible smell."
"D - Take out the sourness from last year's infection, and this one is a grand slam. What an incredible offering from Short's. Easily their best beer by far. This beer is balanced to near perfection - the bitterness of the dark roasts meets the sweetness of the milk sugar and makes everything right with the world. I could drink 3 or 4 bottles of this no problem, and then land flat on my ass. Expedition Stout, KBS, Peche Mortel, Weasel, and just about every other coffee beer other than GI BCBCS can take a seat, because Cup a Joe is in the house!"
"D- Clearly let this one warm up first. Just maybe a bit too sweet and lactose prominant for me from making this one stellar. I'd hit this one up again if it ever comes my way."
"Drinkability: One of the more interesting beers I've had as of late; wonderful smells and flavors and especially pleasing mouthfeel; ABV feels a little high and at 8%, I don't think I would be able to drink too much, especially when it's coupled with the sweetness -- but to have one for dessert or on a cold winter night, this would be absolutely amazing and perfect."
"D: Goes down easily, nicely blended, mildly filling, decent kick, I could absolutely have a few pints of this brew."
"This is a great, easy drinking beer. I would love to have easy access to this one...highly recommended."
"Overall, this is a very good beer with a couple of weaker components. It is strong in ABV which is well hidden and the mouthfeel keeps it from being more drinkable. Either way, very good."
"D - The carbonation really hurts this one for me. Being the second Short's beer I've had recently (the PB&J...which I believe both of these to be bottled about the same time frame) I wonder if their priming yeast changed or their measurement calibration for priming sugar was off when these were bottled. Definitely still enjoyable, and would love to try this again on tap. Fix the carbonation levels and this is a great beer in my opinion."
"Pretty good. I prefer a little more body, but I realize this is not a traditional Imp Stout. Still should be thicker. Glad I had the opportunity to try this."
"Dark, black pour with a big, mocha head, probably the best part of the beer. Smell is more espresso than anything else, taste is similar. Perhaps needs more cream and sugar! I found an offensive, burnt element that is present in far too many coffee beers. Also some toffee, dark roasted bean, chocolate, and lactic malt. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. The acrid bitterness is just a bit too off-putting for me."
"D: Too filling to have many, but I will buy again. I don't know if I would order a second at a bar (minus points for that). Delicious overall."
"Another one from my secret bunny 2010 haul from ROBORB. A 12 ounce bottle poured into my shaker glass. Cup A Joe appears a dark nearly black color with a healthy looking inch or so of dense ecru foam. Nose and flavors consist of deep roasted espresso, mocha, caramel, molasses, a hint of vanilla, and an mild yet unpleasant sourness. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Looks like this one is heading downhill quickly. Possibly the early stages of infection here. Nevertheless, I was still able to finish the glass so all was not lost. But I'd advise you all to drink 'em up ASAP if you have any laying around."
"Drinkability - Hell, I drank the whole thing, and not forefully so. Again, I wish I had a non-infected version but honestly, it wasn't half bad being a little infected. I like the play between the tart and bitter dark coffee roast. Accordingly I am not going to rate this horribly like some (why even rate it that bad when you know it is infected?). Thanks again to kzoobrew!"
"5.0 D: Deee-licious. Really a great brew. Tastes just like it should given what they were going for. Drinks like a 5% brew and, in fact, I was shocked when I saw it was 8%."
"D: I can only presume infection, never would a tart and sourness mixed with coffee ever be intended."
"Bottle courtesy iceicebaby. Pours a pretty black color with a solid fluffy brown head. Huge black roasted coffee nose, ash, cacao. Flavor is similar, old black burnt coffee with an additional tart red fruit note. Substantial roasted malt acidity, and no sign of the ""creme."" Underwhelming. Oily and a little thin."
"D - Once the extra carbonation is knocked out, this is a solid beer. Good coffee flavor - not as intense as Peche Mortel or Bell's Java Stout, but well done. Definitely worth a try."
"D: Highly recommended. I could have a few of these."
"This coffee beer has a miky feel and is smooth. A very tasty and drinkable beer-not always easy for stouts or coffee beers. Great balance."
"Acquired via trade courtesy of Telix. Pours out dark like a cup of black coffee with a big two finger brown head that slowly reduces to a thin brown layer on top of the beer. Haven't even put my nose up to the glass and I can smell it from here. Coffee, and a healthy amount of it. Some milky creamy sweetness to it hidden under the smell of roasted malt and coffee beans. Taste is more of the same, coffee up front with a milky middle and roasted finish. Mouthfeel is okay. It's a little too carbonated for my liking, lots and lots of tiny bubbles across the tongue as I sip. I would prefer a little smoother mouthfeel but it not bad. Alcohol barely present in the taste but drinkability is hurt for me by the carbonation. Overall this is a nice beer though. The blend of coffee and milk stout works well and it tastes like the coffee used is really good on its own. Glad I had a chance to try this one."
"Bottle pours a very dark black with lots of foam forming in the duvel glass. Smell is of dark malt coffee and same with the first sip, but then comes a wave of something like sweetner. The middle of this beer is so god damn sweet, actually too sweet. I've never had a beer taste this sweet before. Its ok, but the flavour is a little weird for my taste. Its like somebody putting too much cream and sugar in your coffee. A little over the top for me."
"All in all, this is a good brew to try at least once. For a stout, it's definitely interesting. Very unique flavors. Anyone that might enjoy dark beers regularly. might like this brew for the unique twist."
"D: The first bottle was a drainpour. The second one was much better. Much more of a cream stout than a coffee stout."
"Beer needs something else."
"D - Entirely drinkable and quite enjoyable. Very smooth, and no bad aftertastes to come back later."
"D: Pretty smooth and easy drinking."
"Nice creamy body, low carbonation makes the beer seem a little sweeter than it really is. Definitely a solid coffee beer - I had no idea it was 8% until I started to enter these notes. Very drinkable considering that, but it's by no means a session beer. Shorts makes some very interesting beers... now if they could only fix those infection problems...."
"D - Siiigh. The run of infected beers from Short's is surely disappointing. This one is by far the least offensive, but it's ridiculous none-the-less. I don't think I'll be finishing this one."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. I have to say that for as much as my home state sucks these days, at least we still put out some great microbrews. This one looks like I like my stouts to look. Pours like motor oil, pitch black, with a generous fluffy dark brown head. Looks like dessert. Smells like bitter coffee, chocolate and creamy vanilla. Taste is chocolate and bitter coffee with a creaminess that I haven't found in many other stouts. There is a slight acidic quality in the taste that I didn't expect from the nose. Feels creamy, fluffy, warming and smooth. Feels comforting, a great nightcapper, warms you up and then puts you to sleep."
"Coffee brown-black with a light effervescent maple brown head with almost no retention. The nose is roasted coffee, baking cocoa, vanilla, alcohol, and a touch of hops. Strong malt backbone over a definite cream sweetness. The taste mirrors the nose nicely. Lots of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and warming alcohol. There is a nice lactose sweetness layered over a dark chocolate and hop bitterness that sticks to the palate with a nice balance. The mouthfeel is a little thin for my taste but not bad. Overall a very good beer, nicely balanced and very drinkable."
"The palate opens with a healthy dose of coffee and grainy bitterness. Plenty of coffee flavor is present. Lactic sweetness mid palate works well with the coffee flavors. The body is a little thinner than I remember from my previous exposure. There's a touch of sourness and acidity on the finish, even this tastes a little infected. Medium in body, medium high in carbonation, this beer could use a little more body. Great stuff."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with good carbonation. Not overly heavy at all, making this one almost too easy to drink. Rich, roasty, coffee and cream goodness in a glass. Overall, a great coffee stout that I'm glad they bottled and would love to have easier access to. Very glad I had a friend grab a sixer for me."
"D and overall impression: I could drink this for breakfast or after dinner, really high marks here. Overall, I seem to be on a bit of a coffee beer kick lately, and this one is one of the best. I wish this were readily available to me, it would be part of my regular rotation. Skal."
"Cheers."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability was pretty decent, the creamy flavors definitely smoothed out the roasty, bitter coffee flavors nicely. It was flavorful, but yet easy drinking and smooth. The coffee was nicely done as well. Much better this time than my other experiences with this beer, it's unfortunate it took 3 tries though."
"(D)- Very rich & bold & very enjoyable. Its actually almost refreshing for a stout. I like the creaminess it imparts along with the big roastedness. Definitely one of Short's best beers I have had thus far."
"The drinkablility is very high."
"Amazing beer all around- get one, highly recommended!"
"Overall impression: Wow...this makes Founder's Breakfast Stout look like brown water. The complexity, richness, balance, and drinkability of this beer make for a wonderful winter treat."
"The beer is more carbonated than expected, but the carbonation helps to keep the beer moving over the tongue. The beer is full bodied, but not too heavy, and incredibly full flavored. The alcohol is completely masked by the great coffee flavors of the beer. This is definitely a winner, something I hope to revisit."
"Drinkability? Given the opportunity I could consume Short's entire supply of Cup a Joe, and crave more."
"Just barely falls short of being my 4th consecutive A+ rating. Yeah, I'm easy."
"As a coffee beer lover, this one certainly hits the spot and if they ramped the carbonation down a little, this would be a world class beer. As it stands, it's just plain great!"
"Overall, a really good coffee stout especially after having several so-so ones lately. This one definitely delivers the coffee aroma and taste. For me, a little more sweet to balance it and it would be perfect. This one is worthy of the hype. Highly recommend. Rotation - MI only release so got thru other sources. If avail here might be a couple singles per season. Got a couple to age now so will try again in several months."
"Overall, I am pretty impressed with this coffee stout. The only part that I didn't enjoy very much was the mouthfeel and the apparent sourness. A nice aroma with a solid taste, but so many peanuts. I dig it though."
"Pours black with a light brown head. The aroma is strong coffee with some light smoke. The flavor is strong coffee with some cream, about what you expect after reading the label. Good bitterness and some roasted malt and chocolate. Medium-thick, semi-creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: After it warms, the flavour profile improves quite a bit--potent iced coffee, roasted malt bitterness, creamy dark chocolate. A bit of alcohol heat comes across as well after it warms, but doesn't detract from it one bit--if anything, it supports the coffee and almost gives it a ""hot Cup A coffee"" type of feel. It doesn't have the intensely fresh ground/oily coffee flavour that Peche Mortel has, but is still a nice coffee beer none-the-less. I look forward to trying out more Short's has to offer. A very rich beer indeed--to be enjoyed with a hearty breakfast or as an after dinner dessert."
"12oz bottle, extra from Wadsey, among other Shorts beers I can't easily get a hold of. The beer is dark brown and opaque, with a thick tan froth that quickly receded to a thin spotty film. The aroma is rich coffee with roasted malts and a lactic sweetness, the lactic acid adding a little something new that I haven't smelled in other coffee stouts. The coffee is the main thing I taste up front, with the creme coming through in a long sweet finish. There might be oatmeal in here too, at least the body seems creamy and coating like an oatmeal stout. Really good, not my favorite coffee stout but a solid stab at the style."
"This one goes down well for an 8% brew, but may be a tad one dimensional to really make me want to keep coming back. In the realm of coffee stouts though, this one is definitely among approaching the top of the heap but it just doesn't quite reach the plateau."
"D: Pretty damn tasty beer. ABV is pretty damn manageable and it's a very interesting beer."
"The pour is beautiful and elegant, perfect. Dark as night with a huge black body and a color that is inpervious to light. A huge two inch head of tan then rises up from the bottom of the glass to reach a height of nearly three inches before settling down to a one inch head that stays on top throughout the rest of the session. Aroma is sweet, rich coffee and milk, tons of sweet sugary notes, it really is as the bottle states, exactly what I make for myself in the morning. Sweet light roasted coffee and creme, mixed with subtle sugar flavors. There is not other beer that nails the coffee flavor better then this. It is simply sublime. Rich body, smooth and subtle carbonation and a slightly dry and bitter finish. There is hardly a beer out there I would rather have at any point then this."
"M & D: I drank this just like a cup of coffee. it left my mouth a little dry urging me to drink more of it to quench my thirst. Im not even a coffee fan in ""real"" life but im thinking of heating this up in the morning and drinking it instead"
"D- Powerful in the nose as well as the taste. I was going to drink another beer after this tonight but it might be hard to cleanse my palate after this beer."
"O: While I love Short's for their interesting offerings, this particular brew has not convinced me that coffee stouts work as the coffee in this case tastes old and stale, just like *week* old coffee does. This is my first experience with the coffee + stout style, I hope others have better offerings. At least this one has lots of flavor, but honestly, I'd rather choke down a flavorless Budweiser than this one."
"Overall, a really good coffee stout, but not the best I've had. Still a definite recommendation to any fan of coffee stouts."
"Big thanks to schro126 for hooking up with this long-sought brew. Pours pitch black with barely any light at the edges, small dark tan head that stuck around a bit in the tulip leaving decent lacing. Coffee and caramel are dominate in the nose while this beer is cold but some nice chocolaty notes start to come out upon warming. Smells sweet and roasty. Flavor is largely espresso coffee. It's a little less balanced than what I was expecting. Coffee dominates followed by a sharp bitterness, lightly sour, some chocolate and roastiness. Wish there was little more lactose character to balance the bitterness of the coffee. Body is also a little thinner than I expected, considering the thick pour, and carbonation is biting. This is a very coffee-forward beer, and it tends to dominate the flavor profile too much. I'm going to give a few of these bottles some time to age and see how they progress. As of right now, it's tasty, but I think the coffee can mellow a bit and allow some more of the chocolate to come out. Thanks again, Nathan!"
"D: easy to drink and very quaffable. It kind of leans towards the sweeter side and might deter some with its stronger profile. I could only see myself drinking a few during the course of a night and maybe one the morning after. This beer is banging and is in my top tier"
"Thanks to all who have traded, bought, and shared wonderful beer with me so far. Here's to the next one fidy."
"D: A very nice addition to the world of stouts. Short's has a very nice blend of coffee and cream here and its a nice treat. Goes well with a chocolate chip cookie."
"I also enjoyed the fact (as a full-time barista) that the coffee used was all FTO. Would definitely consider buying another bottle."
"On the palate there's a surprising amount of creamy sweetness, touches of chocolate and even a bit of toffee. The sweetness is quickly swept away by the biting French roast coffee flavor. The coffee character is intense, bitter, almost acrid, while still remaining thoroughly delicious. Medium-bodied and very effervescent, this is surprisingly quaffable for such a punchy beer. The finish is nothing but lingering coffee grounds. While there isn't much to this beer beyond the coffee and cream, it's beautifully crafted and highly enjoyable."
"A little less sweetness in this beer and it would probably be my favorite coffee-forward stout. Until then, Bell's Java Stout is the best of the lot."
"Overall a near perfect representation of a coffee stout. I'm so happy I was able to secure a bottle of this stuff. I might have to check the other side of the lake for a few more."
"D: This is excellent. Probably the ""simplest"" beer we tried during the tasting, but no less outstanding for it. Stuff like this makes me want to seek out coffee beers, which is especially strange for someone who doesn't enjoy plain java."
"D: I've had several coffee beers and this is easily the best. Great aroma and flavor and a pretty easy drinker too, even at 8% ABV."
"the head was thicker than a usual stout, but quickly dissipated to a thin ring. nice aroma, with a clear roasted coffee smell and some burnt caramel undertones. great explosion of coffee taste, with a little dark chocolate there, too. very smooth, with a hint of chewiness in the background. simply outstanding!"
"Very roarty up front with a slightly viscous medium body. Lots of bittersweet dark chocolate and bitter earth hops. Strong bitter roster espresso bean flavor with chewy chocolate malts, earthy hops, toffee and burnt toast/coffee notes. The roasted flavor is a bit overpowering, taking away from the silky chocolate notes but overall this beer is decently balanced. The strong roaster character makes it slightly less quaffable and a touch harsh but I'm still putting this one down pretty quickly."
"For an IS, the mouthfeel is amazingly light. The coffee flavor comes through, easily dominating the palate. Subtle malty flavors underscore the coffee. Mildly astringent, with a pleasantly bitter (coffee) finish."
"M + D: Nice creaminess to it and it complements the flavours beautifully. It performs very well with the other coffee stouts I've come across. Very well done."
"Would love to try this on tap sometime...in the bottle it is right up there with Founders Breakfast among domestic coffee stouts."
"D: Another reviewer commented about how he liked that this was a relatively ""low"" abv beer. I too, enjoyed that this could almost be considered sessionable (to me). We're barely into winter and I've grown a little weary with all the big (10% and up abv) stouts on the market right now. I took this as a breath of fresh air!"
"This was perfect for a cold snowy day. Highly recommended."
"D: While the flavor is super intense at first and can seem intrusive, after drinking for a bit that settles down and make it a comfortable sipper. I was hoping for a sweeter beer, but this one is dark black and bitter for the most part. It's a good beer, just not what I was holding out hope for."
"If you are a coffee stout person this is one of the best. I just wish there was just a bit more in the complexity department. I think this would be a great morning brew to enjoy with a full breakfast."
"D- The alcohol is not apparent at all in this beer. Very smooth and drinkable. This should be a must try for any coffee or stout lover out there."
"D_ Very drinkable for a coffee stout. To drink just one is hard."
"Drinkability: Solid. The abv% on this one is in that nice in-between place where I actually like my stronger stouts to be - it's flavorful enough that it's a sipper to begin with, and with an abv% this comparably low, a second wouldn't be out of the question (if it weren't such a rare treat to get some in Virginia). The one other thing I'd say about this beer's drinkability is that it's a really authentic beer - complex, sure, flavorful, sure, but it's not in a Jahva or Choklat complex or flavorful way. This one's just well-made, and a good introduction to a brewery that I know excels at these kind of oftentimes intuitive (like here) and oftentimes weird (Bloody Mary beer!?) mashups."
"Drinkability: Definitely one to sip."
"Immediate roasted coffee bitterness up front. Caramel and milk sugar sweetness quickly follows, providing a nice balance. Dark chocolate bitterness and milk chocolate sweetness also show themselves. Some vanilla, and smoky malts too. Coffee bitter finish with lingering caramel-sugar sweetness. Full-bodied with a thick, viscous feel. A little oily as well. The sweetest coffee stout I've ever had, and very well done!"
"D: An excellent stout that is pretty easy drinking and goes down faster. The bitterness can get pretty overwhelming so i would only want to enjoy one in a sitting but otherwise this is one hell of a beer!"
"This beer pours very dark with a tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing. Strong smell of rich dark coffee and chocolate. The coffee taste smacks you in the face. Notes of carmel,chocolate and cream follow. The mouthfeel is lighter than you would expect. I am a huge fan of coffee stouts and I have found the perfect one. Better than I have ever had and I have tried everyone that I can get my greedy little hands on. The only thing that would be better is if Joe would have this on tap year around."
"A fairly dark black pour with a small foamy tan head medium carbonation, nice jagged lacing left behind. Aroma of ground coffee, dark chocolate , caramel , burnt marshmallow and dark roasted barley. Flavor is very nice , ground coffee , chocolats , caramel , and a touch of creme, very roasty and best at room temp, some woody notes with hints of vanilla maybe . Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel . Long slightly sweet roasty finish with hints of alcohol but in a good way, maybe some hints of burbon , very nice and very drinkable without beeing too sweet . Another awesome brew from Shorts , tahnk you Shorts ! ! ! I love you"
"Absolutely delicious beer, one I would pick up again in a heartbeat."
"D: Quite drinkable. Not the best coffee beer that I've had, but definitely a very worthy one."
"Tastes of carbonated coffee with a little cream and sugar on top. Only mild alcohol presence. Thick creamy mouthfeel and excellent drinkability. This is like an alcoholic Starbucks drink."
"Very fresh bottle from Michigan, latest seasonal release. Pours black with tons of foam. Coffee in aroma, in the taste, with lots of creme. The bottle surprised me by saying there was milk lactose. Tastes more bitter than 30 ibu would have you believe.Above average mouthfeel."
"Plenty of roasty coffee upfront with a nice creamy finish. This is an amazing coffee stout! Nice and thick. There's a great balance of sweet and bitter and an overwhelming feeling of wanting to pound this down rather than enjoying the master craft that went into this. Short's continues to kill every beer they make!"
"Probably even better on draft if you can get it."
"D - This is one amazing coffee stout. If you're a coffee lover, then this is the stout for you. Simply excellent...'nuff said."
"Definitely rivals Speedway Stout and KBS for my favorite coffee stout overall. Here's to hoping Short's bottles this again."
"Honestly, this beer was a complete disappointment. It's a complete cloying mess of sugary coffee flavors. I had had a bottle of Founder's Breakfast Stout earlier in the day, and compared to that Cup A Joe seems like it should be named Cup A Joke. The elegantly balanced, nuanced, and complex Founder's beer shows what a coffee stout should be, while Cup A Joe tastes like a homebrewing experiment taken too far."
"Overall a fantastic coffee stout that lives up to its labeling (and hype). Soft, airy and ultra smooth with loads of aforementioned flavors. Great coffee stout for sure."
"All told, this if this was heated up and served to me in a coffee mug in the morning I would think it was a delicious coffee with cream. The alcohol is so faint it's almost unnoticeable. It's not a beer that I could drink in quantity (one snifter was more than enough), but it was delicious."
"Cup a Joe is an excellent imperial stout. Only off note is the relative thinness."
"D: A really great beer from Short's. A nearly perfect balance of sweet and bitter, with a lot of coffee but that doesn't overwhelm with maltiness."
"The problem with this one is not drinking but more stopping. Drankability in phenomenal. Near perfect balance across the board, superb beer."
"A very vigorous pour gets an inch of beautiful milk chocolate brown head that actually has nice retention for a growler pour. Body is like starring into the center of a black opal and getting lost in the darkness. Nose is big on the coffee but it is soft and sweet almost like a piece of coffee cake. Oh so creamy with first sip of this lush beer. Lots of coffee feel but in such a smooth and sweet desert kind of way. This is a lovely coffee stout without being to heavy in the normal stout kind of way, to stereo type the style. Very appealing coffee feel stays on the tongue. This is really a coffee lovers stout. Mouthfeel is a creamy coffee hum. Super nicely drinkable brew, would be great in the morning or late at night."
"I'd drink this every morning before work if I could"
"D= An excellent coffee beer and all that I love about creme stouts rolled into one delicious flavor vehicle. Highly recommended."
"D: Wish I had the growler all to myself. It is one that once I started I could continue until it is all gone. Top two or three coffee stout made. Period!"
"The beer pours a dark black color with very good head retention and lacing. On the nose I get a huge blast of coffee grounds, chocolate vanilla, and maybe a hint of licorice and tar. On the palate this beer is just delicious. The beer offers up a huge, creamy, rich flavor profile of coffee and chocolate, with maybe some cherry vanilla in the finish. The creamy mouthfeel aside, this beer is amazingly drinkable and light on its feet. It's incredible how well disguised the alcohol is, and how outrageously easy to drink it is. Wow. Yummy. This beer is so smooth and easy to drink it's nothing short of amazing. Impressive."
"D-Superb! A mighty fine coffee beer that does not skimp! Rich and flavourful with enough body to support it all."
"D - This is probably the most drinkable coffee stout I've ever encountered. The glass disappeared before I even finished the review. Well I'm sure the ABV and coffee flavor would catch up to me I don't mind all that much. This growler will go fast."
"The beer pours a very dark, motor oil black color with a 1/2 inch brown head. The aroma is of strong coffee and roasted malts. There is a lot of cream in the first sip with coffee following quickly. My only complaint with this beer is that it is a little thin. Regardless, this beer is one of my new favorite coffee stouts!"
"I've thoroughly enjoyed everything I've had the opportunity to drink with the name Short's written on it. Cuppa Joe is no different and one of the better coffee stouts I have ever had. Thanks for the treat Johnathan!"
"Pours a deep and dark opaque black, although some red shows up in the edges, very thick brown head forms, really tight lacing all over the glass, drops in sheets and settles down to a thick layer, great retention. Smell is really nice, lots of coffee, dark roast, toffee, creamy lactic sugary middle, more espresso, chocolate, oatmeal, very rich aroma. Taste is similar, lots of coffee and roast up front, chocolate, toffee, sweet lactic latte middle, touch of alcohol, some dark fruit, more espresso and chocolate in the finish, very rich, nice roasty bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, super smooth and drinkable. Very nice coffee beer, nice and creamy, the roastiness is perfect. Really enjoyed this one."
"A fantastic beer from Shorts. Had on-tap at Hopcat in Grand Rapids. It's deep opaque black, with no light making it through this sucker. Small mocha brown head fades away. On the first smell it's intense roasted coffee grounds and malts, with french vanilla cream. The taste is strong roasty malts, intense coffee, and sweet rich vanilla beans and cream. Lingering coffee with chocolate notes. Very complex and wonderful. Mouthfeel is full and rich, almost creamy yet still carbonated. Drinkability is good. Excellent job on this one!"
"drinkability is great. well balanced. hides its alcohol very well. the sweetness is just a touch high for me, but i like my coffee black, so perhaps someone who likes theirs with a little cream and sugare would find this just right."
"Drinkability- Amazing. If it wasn't for the appearance, I'd easily give this brew a perfect score. I don't think a Coffee Beer/Imperial Stout can improve on this anymore and that's saying something; until 20 min ago, I though Coffee Bender was the greatest brew on earth. Perfect balance of coffee and roasted/chocolate malt. I may be a Short's fan because of their creativity and willingness to try new things but I haven't been blown away by them. Until now. Great beer that I really enjoyed and appreciate the opportunity to try. Thanks Jeff!!"
"Black with a faint red/brown edge and a thin, dark tan cap. Spotty lacing, great head retention. Rich aroma, lots of coffee, roast and toffee, dark chocolate. Solid bitterness, but this didn't get in the way of the sweet malts. Lots of dark, bittersweet, and milk chocolate, roasty with a bit of coffee, toffee sweetness, and a hint of grassy hops. Full bodied with lowish carbonation, very smooth, creamy and luxurious. Quite delicious, great balance and very rich."
"Hopefully this finds it's way to bottles, the sooner the better :D"
"The beer is interesting and good. It's a brew I would have to be in the specific mood for though because it's so close to coffee, and I drink a lot of the real stuff on a daily basis. Easily the closest match to a standard cup of joe that I've encountered in the beer world."
"I've been fortunate to engage my lips with a lot of great coffee beers this year and this one is right up there at the top. This is just INTENSE with coffee character and the magnificently hidden ABV guarantees that you'll get buzzed in more ways than one from this stuff! A fantastic brew from Short's!"
"D - Again another beer that makes me want to relocate to Bellaire. Since I love coffee beers I could really drink this one all day or night."
"Thanks, hoppymeal, for the unexpected treat"
"Thank you, Derek. This stuff is great!"
"Drinkablity - Went down quite smoothly. Wish I had more!"
"This is one excellent beer. It pours a nice dark brown color with a nice brown head that is tall but light. It smells of dark malts and coffee aroma. It tastes even better than it smells! It has a sweet malty taste followed by a strong coffee flavor that is really nice. The bitterness of the coffee is perfect for this beer and it really is refreshing and even a bit rejuvenating. Very nice mouthfeel - very smooth and fresh feeling with the right amount of carbonation. It is a very drinkable beer and I would definately pick this up if I can find it again."
"The mouthfeel is ideal for the style."
"I could taste both the coffee and the cream as two distinct components. This stout has a great creamy complexion without the use of nitro. You can smell the coffee; they must have used some really good beans. Overall, this is a really great beer and my favorite coffee stout ever."
"Breakfast stouts are a new style for me and I love them. This beer is up there with my favorites: Founders Breakfast, Kentucky Breakfast and Terrapin Wake-N-Bake. If you like coffee stouts this is a must have beer."
