Creamy going in, creamy going down with a dry finish and a bit of bitter. There is a fresh coffee/espresso overtone, but the real winner is the balance. Sweet,and again almost a milk stout that has the right bitter.  Raisin notes. Overall, this seems like another standard for the style. Not overdone, but not a weakling.","Ricochet","0"

Pours almost completely black, with highlights of black cherry under intense light.  Creamy light khaki colored head about 1.5 inches high, fading to a thin film with nice lacing on the glass.   Smells like light bean coffee with a malty sweet background - it's definitely a hearty stout beer smell. Cold-pressed coffee mouth feel, which feels nice.  It most definitely tastes like a delicious cup of high grade black coffee.  It has medium to high carbonation, but it doesn't overwhelm the flavor.  It's just lightweight enough to not be too filling, but dark and heavy enough to know I'm drinking a stout - mostly due to the pleasant but strong coffee flavor lingering on the palette. If you love coffee and beer, this one hits the mark.  Wish they sold 12 packs of this.","nizzle8287","Dec 18, 2014"

You can spy some carbonation action in the body through the glass.  Aromas of heavily roasted and bitter coffee, with hints of baker's chocolate and cream. Pretty roasty. Flavors are very bitter and roasted forward, all coffee, with hints of char throughout. Wow. This is like chewing on coffee grounds, I would imagine. The body is super dry and smooth, with a heavily roasted and bitter aftertaste. The finish is smooth and dry, with a coffee linger.

There is a lot going on in this brew. You pick up on the coffee and the hops.  Then the aftertaste, is smooth with flavor, and mild sweetness.

Tate: coffee and chocolate, like mocha, malt, some dark fruits, and a hint of hops that comes in at the end followed by an aftertaste of coffee. Mouthfeel: medium carbonation, more carbonation than most stouts I have had which are more on the frothy side. Overall: absolutely delicious. Definitely a winter warmer.

Pours into my trusty SAPP to a motor oil color with a guiness-like cascading mutlicolor transitioning head.  The head clings and reiains a trasition of colors.  On the taste this brew has a great standout coffee bitter flavor with a slightly sweet malt in the background, transitioning to a drier chaulky bitterness that then lingers through the aftertaste.  This brew is not overly sweet and has outstanding coffee accent.  Another good job by SN who always pleases.","mooseisloose","Nov 28, 2014"

Aroma has that fresh, deep coffee bean smell that I need in anything calling itself a coffee beer.  Roasted, nutty, fruity beans covered with a dusting of dark cocoa.  Flavor keeps the quality coffee presence alive and ups the dark chocolate a little, adding some cream and sugar to the finish.  The coffee is strong enough to handle whatever sweetness the malts add.  Lingering prune and slight earthy char.  Medium bodied and decently creamy, drying out nicely at the end.

3.99,-1.7,4.25,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, it had pretty much everything that I look for in the style and I enjoyed drinking it.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, dry on the finish, not filling at all and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I could probably drink a few of these and I can't say that for many Coffee Stouts.  What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style it was and the drinkability, i thought they were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the body, i wish it was just a little thicker.  I would buy this beer again and it would be nice to be able to buy this on it's own and I think it makes for a great cold weather beer.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Coffee Stouts, it's for sure worth a try.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it turned out to be a pretty good Coffee Stout and I think it can hold it's own in the style, but Founders Breakfast Stout is till my favorite of the style and it isn't my favorite Sierra Nevada beer, but I do think it's one of the better beers I've had from them.  Good job guys this was a tasty Coffee Stout and I think you guys made a good move putting this in the winter variety pack, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Nov 17, 2014"

Nice and roasty up front with a rich coffee, toffee, earthy, sweetness, and slight dark fruit. When trying it for the first time you get the roasted bitterness like the nose.  Then you pick up the sweet toffee, nuttiness, earthy hops, then in the finish i s some strong lingering coffee.  The body of the beer is medium to light and seems rather slick and dry.  I like my stouts a little fuller bodied then this.  Overall this is a really strong tasting coffee stout, not shying away from the full flavor of coffee here.  Not the best stout but an enjoyable one at that. If you like coffee and stouts look out for Sierra Nevada's snow pack, Cheers!","DrinkMoreBigBeers","Nov 17, 2014"

4.1,1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 9/12/2014. Pours nearly opaque very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, caramel, toast, cream, brown sugar, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and lactose notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, caramel, toast, cream, brown sugar, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of roasted/herbal hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and lactose flavors; with a great malt bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and slightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent coffee stout! All around great robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and lactose flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

The flavor is intenslely roasted in the long finish with mild sweetness trading off with mild bitter taste in the mostly dry finish. This is a quality coffee stout with light hop bitterness which adds a nice balance-very drinkable as expected from Sierra Nevada with plenty of coffee flavor yet you still taste the base stout which is great.","Slatetank","Nov 06, 2014"

Very nice carbonation on the tongue up front which makes it thirst quenching and wanting more. Then the coffee and the same malts they use in their porter come together to make an amazing iced coffee beer. They should definitely put this in six packs and make it year round. Perfect body not watery at all. The body and mouthfeel of this beer compare with higher alcohol coffee stous or stouts in general. Its great to see a brewery that thrives on hop forward beers absolutely nail a darker beer.","thebrood1987","Nov 06, 2014"

3.96,-2.5,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall - A commendable coffee stout from Sierra. Doesn't quite break the mold and stand out from the pack, but it's rather enjoyable. It's a hard style to screw up, but even harder to make a truly outstanding example, so there's no shame in this one. If you're a coffee stout lover, you'll want to try this one.","TheSixthRing","Beers"
