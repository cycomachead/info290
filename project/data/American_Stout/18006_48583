Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, rye, and cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with rye and cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells better than it tastes in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","May 03, 2013"

3.9,-1.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability: Normally, I’m not a huge fan of dry-hopped stouts, but something about the spiciness of the rye helps offset the bitterness of the hops and makes for a very pleasing balance in this beer.

4.15,5.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This pours an opaque brown with a dry looking two finger sandy head that leaves good lace. On the nose there is a great combination of chocolate malt and spicy rye with toasted grain underneath. In the mouth there is the combination of roasted malts with slightly bitter coffee-like notes mixing with the rye. It seems simple when you spell it out but it's a really great taste and an especially great aroma. This would probably be a good beer without the rye but the spiciness adds quite a bit of interest for me. The finish is long with the chocolate and espresso aromas fading away leaving a nice spicy rye to hang out for a spell. Overall I like this beer a good deal, and it has me wondering why rye stouts aren't as common as, say, oatmeal stouts. This is definitely a beer I'll be looking for again and a style I'll keep my eye out for. Half Acre has a really great and unique stout on their hands here, and I hope it becomes a regular in their lineup.","EricCioe","Apr 12, 2011"

3.6,-8.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"So now I know basically where hydrometers and whatnot come from. Thanks, Half Acre. This bit of edutainment pours a thick dark black-brown topped by finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises chocolate, roasted malts, cedar, pine, greens, and flowers. The taste holds notes of dark chocolate, light red grapes, black pepper, roasted malts, generic wood (kind of a pressed fiberboard character), greens, and the white part of an orange peel. The body is a hefty-feeling medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a nice stout, but I don't think the hops, rye, and roast contingents really get along all that well. Interestingly, though, this stuff goes down pretty easily.","TMoney2591","Mar 11, 2011"
3.9,-1.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This beer pours a nice decent blackness topped by an off white foam that fades to lacing only. The smell is nice. I get aromatics of herbal hops and dark roast coffee. The espresso aroma smells almost of smoked coffee beans, it's rather nice. The flavor is a smoked woodsy malt flavor. There is a touch of grapefruit from the hops. Most of the flavor is drown out by the coffee with I know to be located in this beer. There is an acidic nature that comes along with the coffee that's a tad off-putting. The mouthfeel was pretty decent for an average stout. There is just something off about how all of the flavors work together and with the acidity. It's a pretty darn good beer, but I feel there is room for improvement.","Vdubb86","Mar 10, 2011"
4.15,5.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pairing Notes: This brew was acquired for the intention of a nice little beer dinner with the lady. Only one course and a dessert, we didn't go crazy. For dinner I made a Jambalaya with Zataran's Jambalaya mix and some quality Polish Kielbasa. The semi-spicy character of the seasonings along the smoked sausage brought out much of the roasted gran in the beer. Again, this resulted in chocolate and coffee flavors, the rye being mostly absorbed (Note: the beer was initially reviewed before eating any food for a pure beer flavor judgment). I highly suggest pairing this beer with a fairly spicy food - Mexican, Cajun, BBQ, etc., but not too spicy, just enough to play with. The dessert was the real prize match, though. I picked up two slices of Sour Cherry Pie from Erwin Cafe (on Halstead), along with what appeared to be homemade vanilla ice cream. The ice cream didn't wow me, but the cherry pie, world class on its own, made the beer taste just like a great Italian espresso. Pair this brew with fruit desserts, maybe a fruit tart or your own favorite cherry pie, and be in for delicious treat.","CMB2012","Mar 09, 2011"
3.91,-1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Decent enough stout but the mint/menthol thing is a bit weird. Slightly ashy and acrid with a mild grainy character from the Rye.","brewandbbq","Mar 02, 2011"
3.68,-6.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D: Goes down relatively easy, tasty, somewhat filling, mild kick, and an interesting take on the style. At time the rye character was a bit much, but the roastiness and chocolate help this beer out.","Jayli","Mar 01, 2011"
3.63,-8.1,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall, this is one of the roastiest beers I've ever had. If there's no coffee in here, I'd be incredibly impressed with the flavor they packed in. However, the bitterness is almost overpowering and takes it slightly out of balance. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy this beer, but I'm afraid there's just something just a tad off about it and my rating has to reflect that.","ChrisPro","Feb 24, 2011"

3.85,-2.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Served from a 22 oz bottle. Pours a deep, ruby black, with a moderate head that settles down to a light cocoa colored 3'4 inch layer of foam. Aroma is dominated by roasted coffee notes, but these are a bit restrained, and not as overpowering as found in other examples of the style. Coffee also predominates in taste, but there is also the subtlest evidence of some flowery/herbal presence in the background, which I find unusual for a stout, but welcome nonetheless. Mouthfeel is extremely well rounded, and not at all cloying or heavy. Overall, a very interesting take on the style, and in fact, it probably ranks among my favorite stouts.","bristol2120","Jan 04, 2011"

3.98,0.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"F: Finishes still pretty bitter, but not quite overwhelming, just on the cusp of it. The bitterness seems to come more from the earthy charred malts still, but some from earthy spicy hops. Again the rye comes through, with a spicy quality and definite rye taste, but it's mostly buried in the stout flavors and bitterness. Speaking of which, more stout flavors. Creamy and rich, with dark malts, roasty malts, a little coffee still. Tasty and smooth, perhaps just a little too bitter. I'm also just starting to get a briny and minerality taste, probably from all the roasted malts and perhaps even the rye.","jlindros","May 14, 2010"

There's a very high amount of bitterness in the mouthfeel. This is a very well done beer, without any flaws that I can see. Just a bit overly hopped for my personal tastes.

The body is medium, just short of full, which is an asset. A bomber is the perfect size to get acquainted with this Rye Stout, and definitely not while double-fisting with another beer, duh.
