"Excellent sweet-bitter balance."

"Deep black, great aroma roasted malt and coffee. Very rich, creamy. Just enough coffee. Overall, a great stout."

"I like this.  Good level of alcohol - at a level that I think works well."
""
""
"Would drink this one again"
"Tons of coffee flavor! Not overly carbonated or overly boozy (both of which are good things). I definitely plan to have this again."
"taste like fresh coffee.  Great stout"
"Taste is of deep coffee grounds, roasted malt, and slight bitter hops.  Super roasty, this is a coffee beer for coffee lovers.  One to try, but for me I have had more balanced beers in the style."
""
"overall: ok stout"
""
""

"Overall:  Not bad.  Nice flavors of malt and coffee with some good sweetness, but just a tad too much of the coffee bitterness for me to really, really like it."
"This is our favorite Coffee Stout. Have tried all I find, but this one always stands out in the palate."

"Pretty nice.  Lots of bitterness and a tad thin, but smells great and tastes less filling.  Good beer."

"Overall pretty good, it has a great nose, the taste had some good aspects but dropped off on the cocoa and fudge while increasing the roasty slightly acrid burnt notes and big on bitterness. It had some great characters and was tasty in general, but the lack of carbonation made this feel like it was a lot bigger and syrupier than it actually was. A bit more carbonation would have made the mouth pop a bit more and the flavors come out more, and I think it would have bumped up quite a bit. 4"

"Beautifully black, thick and creamy tan head. Wonderful aroma of malty sweetness combined with coconut. Surprisingly less coffee than I would have thought noted in the aroma. It present in the flavor though. Starts stouty, fades to sweet notes of roasted coconut, finish with bitter coffee flavor. Could be flatter. Nitro tap would be awesome. I want to taste all of this with no CO2 interference."
""
""
"This is an excellent brew. Coffee is surely there, but very nicely balanced and not overpowering. I would describe it as a FBS less the oatmeal and a toned down on the beans. Roasted, chocolate malts with a very good aroma. A little on the thin/watery side, but very well done. Overall, I would give it a 4. Outstanding."
""
""
"O - Pretty decent, but it feels like the coffee beans were a little ""green"""
""
""
"O: This is really well done and actually my new favorite coffee stout, it beats Bell's Java Stout by a few points in my book, I just wish I could get this in my area!"
""
""
"Really a fantastic coffee stout, that puts the coffee front and center without overwhelming. Awesome brew."
""
""
""
""

"This also has a good Alc content 6.7% not to hi not to low!"

"the beer is opaque, sporting a near black body and a half inch of beige head. The aroma offers roast, coffee, bready malt. Roast and stout character lead the charge, with coffee playing a supporting role. Rich and dark, with a mild hop presence and perhaps a touch of earthiness. Medium bodied. Simple and straightforward. A solid stout and at a decent price. Recommended."
""

"Poured a blackish body with two finger head that died quick and left some lace. A good aroma of roasted and coffee malts along with a bit of sweet chocolate and/or caramel. Beer is medium to heavy bodied, goes down smooth and not really haggard, dry finish, the roasted and coffee malts are noticeable and dominant but there's some sweet chocolate hanging around. Not a bad stout at all but not too complex and just basic which is not a criticism."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is dark brown with a moderate amount of light brown head. Nose has a light roast and heavy coffee bean note. Clean but simple. Taste is a bit more roasted, stronger heavy roast coffee and bitterness towards the back. Faint chocolate and burnt caramel in the finish. Body is medium and creamy with strong carbonation."
""
"Overall- nice amount of coffee, which is appreciated by this habitual coffee drinker. Comes together well, good mouthfeel."
"A good coffee stout. Nice body. Good consistency. Apparently very easy to drink as I blew through it before I got to reviewing it. I guess I have had a lot of coffee stouts at this point, so my standards are high. This is good enough, but not enough to really jar my attention or keep me coming back for more."
""
""
"O- a nice full flavor coffee stout"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Verdict: A decent coffee stout from Evolution. The nose offered some promise, but it was just too roasty and toasted for my palate. The dry finish didn't offer any consolation nor did the weak body, but for someone looking for an out and out coffee stout, this should definitely hit the spot."

"I would still recommend the Lot 6 DIPA from Evo before this, but still a great drink if you can find it."
"Overall, a rather odd experience. A flat beer, which still tasted pretty good. Have another in the fridge, and if it's significvantly different, I'll re-review."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is heavy bodied and smooth with a lot of biting carbonation. Overall, a very good and very delicious coffee stout"
""
""
""

"Bottle: Poured a deep black color stout with a nice large dark brown foamy head with light retention and almost no retention. Aroma of floral coffee notes is quite enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by floral coffee notes with some light black chocolate notes. Body is a bit thin for style and lack some creaminess. Coffee notes are really great but body is a bit too thin for the style."

"Really delicious coffee beer that I call 1/2 BCBCS because I like how it looks, at 1/2 the ABV. Beautiful black, crimson highlights, very nice. Big coffee aroma and taste, while not forgetting its a stout. Finishes dry, more bitter than sweet, fruity, coffee. Overall outstanding, well worthy of its number 1 ranking. And $12 per 4 makes this a best buy."

"O - I can't remember when I got this, only knowing that I picked it up at Capones. I will search this one out again. It is as good as any coffee beer made. Bravo!"
""
"D - Big appearance... Big aroma... Big flavor... Big Mouthfeel... All at a respectable 6.8% ABV... This is one of the better American Stouts out there... I have no complaints and no suggestions for improvement... Highly enjoyable as are many of the recent Evolution brews I've sampled... They are starting to turnout some really solid brews and deserve to be recognized..."

""

""

"Overall this is the way I feel stout should be, very enjoyable from start to finish."
""
""
"Now I need to find this on tap!"
"A very solid coffee stout with some nice hop characteristics to it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A sip of this does it no justice. A whole glass and you'll want more and more. The comparison to Founders Breakfast Stout is close, but this lacks a bit of the depth that FBS's malt flavor has."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of the better beers to come out of Evolution so far, and when I have a hankering for a coffee stout I wouldn't hesitate to pick up a 4-pack."
""
""
""
"On draft at the High Spot in Cambridge. Pours thick and dark with small brown head. Aroma of earthy coffee and some sweet chocolate. Flavor follows with a creamy motuhfeel with prickly carbonation at the front. Sweet chocolate and bitter earth balance well. Medium to heavy mouthfeel. Very nice beer. Surprising from something out of Salisbury."
""
"This is a damn fine coffee stout and it really impressed. This should be included in discussion among the elite in the category. Excellent job, Evolution."
""
""
""
""
"O - Heavy on the dark roast, more so than the majority of the stouts out there."
""
""
""
"O: I've seemingly had a billion coffee stouts recently, but this is the one that could be mentioned in the same breath as the FBS/WnB pantheon and not get embarrassed as a result. It definitely deserves to be the #3 rated American Stout on BA."
""
"O- Big, bold flavors, bordering on an imperial stout with the body and flavor. Huge coffee flavor that jumps out right away. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very quaffable. The coffee notes a strikingly similar to Founders Breakfast Stout."
""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall a solid take on a coffee stout with well hidden alcohol. I love how fresh the coffee character was in this without turning musty and stale. I would drink this again for sure. Thanks again Heath!"
"O: Excellent coffee stout. Great flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A somewhat unbalance stout that left me somewhat disappointed. Dry and bitter finish as well left an ashtray flavor in my mouth. Don't recommend this stout. So many better options out there."
"D: one of the best coffee flavors I have experienced in a brew. super fresh, great on the nose and on the drink. Im sure glad I finally got to try to this one from evolution!"
"I'm a huge fan of this beer. I'll be having more in the future."
""
""
"Overall a real solid coffee stout, certainly the nose seems my favorite, but also better than many others I've had."
""
""
""
"O- A great stout with a ton of coffee. I have had imperial stout that have had less flavor than this. Hard to believe this is a stout under 7% ABV. Very happy I can buy bottles of this now!"
"O - I am thrilled that Evolution has decided to bottle this stuff. With the huge aromas and flavors it is hard not to compare this to some of the best Double Stouts out there. While it may not live up to some of the big boys, it is damn close. At the very least, it is the best American Stout (not double) I have had. Grab this one if you can get it!"
""
""
""
"O- It could be a bit creamier and the metallic taste throws things off but, for a small Maryland brewery barely anyone's heard of, it ain't too shabby."
""
""
""
""
""
"Served in a nonic, a glowing onyx color with a small, creamy, tan head that displayed moderate retention and lacing. Aroma of coffee and cream (presumably this is a milk stout), moderate roastiness. Nice taste that reflects the smell, rich coffee, smooth cream, dark malt sweetness, with a touch of bitterness that came out more as the beer warmed. Body was not quite full, but still rich and overall tasty and drinkable. I'd imagine this would make an amazing nitro beer."
""
"O-it a very drinkable stout. I love soda a lot and the drinkability on this reminds me of soda. Definitely something ill go back to an recommend to others"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was an enjoyable beer to finish off the night with. It would work well as a desert beer with some vanilla cake or even ice cream."
""
""
"By the end you suddenly realize that you should have had two pints pulled because you would just hate yourself if you couldn't enjoy another glass."
""
"Brought home a growler of this from the tap house in Salisbury. A delicious stout that is very sessionable and super smooth. A nice hop character but great additions of malt really add to the taste, along with a great mouthfeel and creaminess on the palette. Too bad it's only available on tap, but definitely near the top of the list on American Stout's I've tried."
""
""
""
"O: A very tasty blend of dark, possibly black patent malts, espresso-like, organic coffee bittersweetness and a sturdy 6.8% ABV to support everything. This was an exceptional American coffee stout stylized with a Caribbean flair."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Medium bodied. Drinks like its less ABV. Couldn't believe it was mid-6%s"
"o - Overall I thought this was a great coffee stout, and probably the best beer I've had so far from Evolution. The nose and body were great, and it was very easy to drink. Would like to have it again."
"This is truly a great stout. Although I stumled upon this, I'd seek this out for sure!"
"Beer is medium in body, nice finish, pretty bitter with the coffee but not overly so, as far as a coffee stout goes, this is definitely one of the better ones out there. Glad I got to try it, the wife loved it too, I'd have it again."

"Very nice robust caramel smell mixed with aromas of coffee and hints of roasted nuts and a touch of chocolate. Overall not bad. First impression was really just the perfect carbonation, great frothy and fluffy mouthfeel and just all around benefit to the palate. Lots of caramel flavors and again a bit of a smoked hint at the back. Small flavors of roasted nuits, chocolate and hints at black coffee. Very nice,"
"This has a good creamy stout feel. I'm not a huge stout fan, but have been recently warming up a bit to them. This one is amazing beer with the coffee smell and once it warms is a real treat to drink."
"This one is all about the coffee. Pours a murky black. Smells like a fresh pot of strongly brewed coffee. The taste is also dominated by the coffee, but not so much that you can't get some hints of other stout qualities in there, chocolate, vanilla, a slight touch of alchohol warmth, etc. Actually found it to be quite sessionable for me, and almost killed the entire growler in one night. The rest i had with my breakfast the next morning. If you like coffee stouts as i do, if you get the chance i would not pass this one up."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and makes for a good accompaniment to breakfast."
"The beers color is a rich dark brown with minimal light visible. The has a soft coffee aroma but is by no means overpowering. Subtle hints of chocolate can also be sensed the the nose. The beers taste is velvety and smooth, light in body with a mild coffee flavor soft finish. The coffee stout is not as robust as others which taste like a double expresso but if you are in the mood for a light body, easy drinking coffee stout this beer is perfect."
"Pours a dark brown almost black cola like color with a two finger khaki color head which gives way to some decent lace. The aroma is of big big coffee along with some dark chocolate, there are aslo hints of vanilla present. The smell is big and bold very inviting. The taste is of big coffee and is balalnced out by dark chocolate. There is also a nice oaky vanilla taste to bring even more balance. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated but slightly watery. Overall a very good beer nice big nose and a big bold flavor. One of the smoother and more balanced coffee beers you will run into."
"O: I like this beer more than I thought I would based off the aroma, since it is over the top coffee grinds. For anyone that likes coffee beer, this one is for them. The low abv makes this extremely drinkable. Also had this infused with oak chips and vanilla, which IMO, made it even better. It cut some of the coffee and drew out more of the chocolate and vanilla."
"O: This is how you do a low ABV stout. Really complex, rich and extremely drinkable. I throughly enjoyed this one. A growler fill may be in my future. Thumbs up - yet another winner from Evo."
"This is a very nice local coffee stout (much better than Flying Dogs recent take IMO) but the carbonation issues remind me of the lesser batches of Planet Bean and make the flavor one dimensional."
"D - Thin mouth with less than 8% ABV make this extremely drinkable. With big, chewy stouts at 10-12% ABV, you have one or two, and you're full. This is what I think the definition of a session stout should be. Compared to others in the class, it's very good, but not the top of the heap."
"The taste isn't quite as strong and pungent as the nose, and this is perhaps due to the mouthfeel, which is a bit thin. It doesn't quite have the big, creamy body that I would expect from the wondrous nose. While the feel is a bit thin, the drinkability on this is sky high. Beautiful coffee notes and a not overwhelming amount of coffee."
"D: An intense coffee flavor makes this a very good drink. I'll share a pint or so with ksak but that's it. The rest is mine."
"D/M_ deff. a session beer but is smooth and velvety on the tongue and is not overly carbonated."
"The beer poured incredibly black and syrupy into a pint glass. The head was tan and thick, with toffee, chocolate, and burnt toast aromas - very nice. A wonderfully smooth, low carbonation mouthfeel (viscous), with burnt toast, black malt, and toffee flavors dominating. A lingering burnt toast aftertaste, with malt sweetness and a bit of hop bitterness. A fantastic stout."
"D - An exceptional American Stout, not Imperial or Double IMO, but plenty of flavor from the coffee, so no mistaking that. The stout is easy to drink even for 6.8% - it deserves a 5 for sheer quality of brew and flavor of the coffee, the cold drip method was utilized per brewery rep-it has given the beer such balanced coffee taste."
"Haven't had a beer from them that I didn't enjoy yet, and the Rise Up Stout continues that trend. If you have a chance to get this beer, I very, very strongly recommend it."
"Very, very dark in color but some minor ruby highlights near the edges of the glass when held to the light. Nice looking tan head on top. Good aroma-mild coffee/espresso notes with a decent roasted aroma. Almost has more of a dark chocolate scent to me then a lot of coffee. Flavor is in a word-KILLER. Perfectly balanced roasted and coffee flavors simply meld together. Nice, lingering mocha flavor. Slightest hint of chocolate. Roasted graininess also comes thru. Retains enough ""stout"" flavor that it isn't overshadowed by the coffee. Great body. Just a great, great beer and an even better stout. Easily could become a new favorite-wait I think it is!"
"Awesome! I love when both a great brewery and coffee company get together and make a Coffee Stout Baby of extreme awesomeness like this. This was just THICK with java, roast, sweetness, and the drinkibility was top notch. Be on the look out for this very soon in 12 oz bottles in the MD/DE markets. I pray that this remains as good as it is on draft."
