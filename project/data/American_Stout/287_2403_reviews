"It's great! It's really smooth and creamy with a malty bite to it."
""
""
""
"I was fairly impressed with this brew"
""
"Just didn't do it for me. I guess I like my stout's more robust with a bit of a thicker taste--I think cream stouts might just not be my thing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent smelling stout. For a lighter alcohol content the flavor is pretty intense. Will revisit again when I want to drink more than just one stout in an evening."
""
""
""
""
"A very average craft cream stout in a world of great ones. It was just ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, good but underwhelming. Nothing stands out, either good or bad. It's not going to replace my Satin Solitude any time soon."
""
""
""
""
"Hard to think of another beer with such a range of strengths and flaws. I'll finish the four-pack I bought, but probably will not re-purchase."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this beer, it's got coffee roasted malts, not sweet, but it smells and taste like it has oats, my only complaint is that there is little to no carbonation. I can see this as a regular in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"not my favorite cream stout"
""
""
""
""
"Not as creamy as I was hoping and probably a bit strong on the alcohol taste, but still a fine beer."
""
""
""
""
"Did not like this at all."
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice full-bodied creamy stout that is smooth as a winter's night is long.  It pours a nice deep dark brown with a tan head that unfortunately doesn't last too long.  The nose is all malt.  It is a very sweet stout but not overly sweet to the point you can't swallow it.  There is a little bit of a burnt aftertaste that provides a nice balance.  Thanks, Bell's, I'll have another."
"(I first drank a bells stout on tap when i was in college in ann arbor in 1985 or 86, that was a ridiculously sweet stout. time flies.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good stout. Creamy mouthfeel and nice taste"
""
""
"O: [4.50] This is such a solid all around beer.  The smell was inviting and the taste was spot on for the style.  Really good flavor throughout.  This is the best stout I have had in quite a while.  The roasted malts balanced with the sweetness of the malts is fantastic."
""
""
"Overall: With all the stouts out there these days, id consider this one decently good. The flavors and aromas arent very robust or complex and nothing to write home about, but its tasty nontheless. The mouthfeel is where this beer shines, as the name implies."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent stout, very smooth mouthfeel, muted flavor up front (might be the cream) but finishes with some roasted malt and medium espresso.  A little bit of a boozey finish."

"Maltier and smoother than the kalamazoo stout, with a milder flavor profile but still a hearty roastiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is a pretty good stout, but not a really good one.  There’s some good roasty flavors balanced with some sweetness, but there’s something missing that is keeping this beer from being great.  Unfortunately I don’t know what that is, I just know that this beer is missing it."
""
""
""
"This beer was pretty ""meh"" for me.  With thousands of stouts to choose from these days it might be easy to pass this one over."
""
""
""
"Slightly less oily, laced brown head. Cold hot cocoa (it's a thing), dusted truffles. Bittersweet cocoa and very smooth."
""
"This beer is Fantastic! I love bells"
"Overall - Delicious and easy drinking. Only detraction is the light mouthfeel that is incongruous with the color, head, and nose."
""
""
""
""
""
"This jet black beauty went right from from the bottle to the trusty tulip with enough of an aggressive pour to produce a full inch of mocha head right to the brim. Waiting for the head to settle allowed the stout to warm a bit. Do not drink this ice cold; the warmer it gets, the more pronounced the burnt chocolate /espresso becomes, and all all without being to bitter on the way down. A double cream mouthfeel indeed. The easiest drinking stout I can remember, with a tiny bit of bitterness on the finish. Usually I like a stout as a sipper, or something to have with a big, full meal. This one is refreshing, I want more than one, and can see myself going through a couple on a hot summer day. Highly recommended."
"Medium sweet, with a little bitterness. Very good."
"Easy drinking. 6.1%. Buy again.  Only tasted out of bottle Bc shared with friend"
""
"Pours close (if not) a pitch black in color with a thin beige head. Sheets of lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of cocoa, dark roasted malts and espresso. Bit more going on with the taste with some caramel and sweet cream in the mix also. Very smooth and goes down easy with no bitter or harsh after taste at all. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. One of the finest for this style of brew."
"Dark, creamy and smooth.  Tastes great.  6.10% makes it a drinkable beer anytime."
""
"O: delicious beer."
"This was by far the highlight of my latest visit to Bells. I sampled it on the paddle initially and went back for a full pint on the nitro pour. It has a great chocolate brown non transparent look with a fabulously thick rich creamy head. With a mild roast,bold taste of coffee and malt that made for a smooth creamy finish. A rich malty feel with a nice bite of grain."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a fan of stouts.   But this one was very enjoyable."
"OVERALL: Okay, but not all that special. A bit burnt and a decent amount of sweet flavors, but this is a little one dimensional and not all that interesting. Besides black note, I hate to say that I haven’t found much to enjoy in Bells’ stout beer. This certainly is nothing worth writing home about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured dark with minimal head, light lacing.  The smell is roasted grains, chocolate and caramel.  Taste follows suit, nice, but unexceptional.  Not too thick, but a very creamy mouthfell, light carbonation.  Bells can sometimes deliver a masterpieces, this is not one of those times.  I'd drink it again, but would not seek it out."
""
"Pours dark. Smell isn't overwhelming. Nice balanced malty flavor. Easy to drink. Gets better as it warms. Well balanced creamy and carbonated. Nice easy stout that is exactly what they are shooting for."
""
""
""
"12 oz glass poured into a snifter. Poured a fairly deep brown/black with some red hue around the edges of the glass. Created a decent one finger of a khaki colored head. Overall a pretty good looking beer in the glass. Fairly underwhelming nose on this one. Some chocolate, mild coffee, and as the title says, maybe a little bit of cream or maltiness. Taste kind of follows suit here with chocolate and perhaps some very subtle dark fruits coming through. Fairly thin mouth for a stout. Decent overall but nothing I'll be seeking out again."
""

"Creamy milky chocolate lactose sugar"
""
""
""

"Value:  I have to admit, I am partial to Bell's beer.  It is priced slighter higher than most beers, but this is balanced by a better quality than other beers.  I like it."

"Overall, this is a bitter, roast-forward stout that comes off as quite sessionable on account of the smooth finish and excellent mouthfeel.  I’m not a fan of everything Bell’s does, but they do seem to have a knack for stouts."

"Had a couple of these at a local restaurant on tap. Definitely a heavy stout for a winter day. Outstanding flavor. Actually prefer this over Guinness. Next to a great burger, forget about it..."

"Bottle from Maltitude. Pours dark black with almost no head. Aroma of roasted malts, vanilla, espresso and chocolate. Tastes very smooth, with flavors of roasted malts, roasted coffee beans, and vanilla. Light carbonation. Sweet and delicious."

"Weighting: Appearance 15%, Smell 15%, Taste 35%, Mouthfeel 15%, Overall 20%"

"O: a well-done roasty stout, easy drinking and hearty - fairly typical flavors and feel for the style - not sure I got as much ""special double cream"" as I would've expected."

"Overall - The body is fantastic, and the low ABV suits it well. The malt could be amplified a bit, especially in terms of aroma."
""
"A decent American stout. Given the ABV isn't as high as what most people reach for in the autumn/winter, you could likely have more than one without running into too much trouble."

"Overall: Not the best stout in the world, but very well made and enjoyable. For something comparable, I would still choose Left Hand Nitro Milk stout over this, but then this isn't really a milk stout, its a cream stout. I don't believe they use the lactose, which is probably a good thing. Its good, worth seeking out and the price is about where it should be."

"This poured a deep, murky black with a minimal head, and small bubbles throughout. Nice lookin'. Aromas of roasty malt, burnt popcorn (in a good way), and coffee hints. Tasted malty, a bit sweet (do I detect lactose sugars?), some roasty flavors, altogether rather light. Mouthfeel was a bit light and watery, clean aftertaste. Well-made, but I am a fan of bigger, badder stouts... good for the style."
"Pours a deep black with a creamy medium tan head. The head burns off in short order leaving some nice small lacing. The aroma is pretty roasty, despite the taste notes, with hints of coffee and cocoa. The taste doesn't have much burnt malt until the finish, with some upfront notes of cocoa. The body is a little thinner and there is a heft bite to it on the finish. Good but not my favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours opaque, black color. minimal carbonation, little foamy head rises and falls fairly quickly. no lacing. this smells of heavy cream, roasted malt. this is a very creamy, sweet milk stout. balanced by abundant roasted malt, this medium-full bodied stout is very sessionable. great example of the style. odd, apparently theres no lactose in this-it tastes just like any milk stout should, i thought it was one of the best examples of the style i've tried-now i don't know what to think."

"beautiful , no see through ebony color. Aroma is of sweet milk, interesting. Taste is smooth malty, milky goodness, well balanced and awesome in taste. This is one of the most creamy stouts I have had and the taste is awesome and the aftertatste is mellow with a hint of coffee and burnet sugar. Nice job, very drinkable in multiples, love it"
""
"Overall: First had this beer last winter. Great to see it back on shelves again! It's just another one of those great go-to stouts for the colder months!"

"Chewy with an extraordinarily creamy body - very fine carbonation."

"On Nitro at Al's. This allowed the beer to a creamier, softer taste as compared to a bottled version. Paired well with a chocolate dessert"

"Pours black with a creamy brown head. Not too keen on the smell, kind of boring, but the flavor really makes up for it. Nice creamy feel at first. Toasty chocolate flavor. Not really any coffeeness to it, which is nice. I like this one."
""
""
"O: A solid stout from Bell's.  Even though my opinion is that this is not their best stout, nor is it my favorite from their lineup, it is still a very pleasant offering that features a nice depth of roasted flavors.  Supremely easy to drink and enjoy."

"Final Word: A solid, drinkable, no frills stout. All of the flavors are very pleasant and balanced, but nothing here really surprises or innovates. This is the kind of stout you can rely on when you need something comfortable and drinkable, but will disappoint if you are looking for something to take you out of the ordinary. This is a double edged sword, as there is definitely something to be said for really nailing a rich stout, but it lacks that special something that could make it a favorite or make it stand out in your memory. Grab it when you want something very drinkable and smooth, or when you want to make a meal pairing, as its straightforward profile makes it perfect for that purpose!"

"an absolutely delicious stout, but i don't get the cream part, there s no sweet finish or body like the milk sugar usually imparts on these beers, but other than that curious absence for its name, its a wonderful beer. rich and dark, huge grain bill i have to imagine, with special dark, carafa, and burnt barley, among chocolate and caramel too. it all combines into a very coffee like aroma, with some good roast to it, no acidity, and an intense dark chocolate element, bakers chocolate, unsweetened even. super dark to look at too, no light coming in, and not much head on it, but some khaki froth when i aggravate it. the flavor is not overly complex, just the dark grains meshing together all the way through. the thing that makes this beer special i think, is its texture, its rich and creamy without being filling, sweet, or too strong to drink a bunch of. not as bitter in the finish as its color should mandate that it is, velvety, and i could make a morning of these for sure, great pre-noon beer if you ask me. thanks to clay station for sharing a bottle this morning."

"Looks dark and beautiful, smells delicious, mouthfeel is so creamy, and it tastes as delicious as it smells. I know its seasonal but I stash a few to enjoy all summer long. The roasted malt characteristics stand out, with some fleeting hints of smoke and dark fruit. Just enough sweetness to balance out the earthiness and hop bitterness. Such a great beer I can't get enough of it."

"O: Decent stout would drink again."
"O- I didn't know what to make of this stout initially because there are so many flavors and sensations going on. But I'd say it's good. Maybe a bit scatterbrained as far as its approach and perhaps unfocused, but still good."
"Dessert has been served in the form of Bell's Special Double Cream Stout. This is one that I'd love to try again."

"Had this last night at the bar, I have not had anything from Bell's that I have disliked so far. This one I truly appreciated, since it is a cream stout that does not contain dairy. Nice smooth mouth feel, delicious chocolate flavor. This stout is pleasing, without being thick and is very easy to drink. I recommend it highly."

"Typical dark brown-black pour you'd expect from a stout, a small creamy tan head sank to a ringlet, holding there and dotting the glass with lace. Dark roasty malts in the nose, milk chocolate and lightly roasted coffee. Smooth sugary sweetness in the taste, cocoa, light roasty bitterness for balance, and a slight mineral element in there as well. Medium body, slick mouthfeel, but perhaps not quite as luscious as the name would imply. I'd bet this would be great on nitro, but I say that about many stouts. Nice beer overall, but I'd reach for an Expedition much quicker than this."
""
"Deeply roasty but lacks maybe a bit of texture in the mouthfeel for me. Solid stout nonetheless and something I would certainly have again."

"I wonder if some of the other reviewers had a serving that was too cold, because this is one of the most flavorful dark beers I have had. Or it was a different beer. It did seem to have more of a kick than the Double Cream stout's advertised 6.1% alcohols."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not overly aggressive. Not very bold. But it tastes good and is very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O - One of my favorite Bell's beers! Very sessionable, in my opinion. I could see some nervous stout wannabe's give this a go and enjoy it. Worth the high price point if you ask me..."

""
""

"Very nice rich, yet sweet Stout... Smooth enough to session on. Also full enough to enjoy only one or two. Very creamy and balanced. Worth seeking out but won't blow you away~"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- This is one rich and creamy stout. It has great balance with the sweetness of the chocolate roasted malt and bitter hop back. Fits like peanut butter and jelly. Good job Bells."

"Overall - A tasty stout, another solid offering from Bell's."
""

""

"Overall a little disappointed due to it being hyped to highly by someone I know with similar beer taste as me. Good but not great."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Jet black in color and I don't see any light getting through this brew. I see a wisp of light brown foam on the top of this beer. I smell rich dark malt,roasted barley, and black licorice. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and is a nice contrast to the bitterness from the roasted barley that fades into a light sweetness at the back of the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am not disappointed by this brew. Great take on the style. I would like a little more from this one though. If this had the fullness of their Kalamazoo Stout then we would be in serious business here."
""
"Overall: A very good stout. I'm more of an ""in your face"" type guy when it comes to stouts, but this is a very pleasant, mild stout that I could have a good day grilling in the cool weather with. My first foray into Bell's isn't a bad one. I'll be checking out their other brews soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Like the name suggests, this beer's main selling point is the creamy texture and mouthfeel that nicely contrasts with the roasted flavors that come from the malts. Not a bad beer."

"Decent body, appropriate carbonation level, sticky/oily/smoothe. I like this beer, and it's perfect for a snowy night in the teens and twenties. Definitely worth picking up, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way."

"Overall. 3.5. In the grand picture, this is a really good beer. But an establishment that can put out Expedition, Black Note, Two Hearted, Hopslam (my #1 overall beer), the Oracle, and then a great second tier; java, Oberon, oarsman, etc. This beer just doesn't hold up to Bell's usual standards. IMO, obviously. They are still a top 5 brewery for me."

"O- high black coffee taste with very little chocolate flavor to it. If you enjoy black coffee this would be a beer you would enjoy."
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this is a pretty decent stout not overly creamy which is what I was expecting."
"Nice head on the pour with a deep dark appearance. It has a great smell with hints of chocolate and coffee. The mouth feel is fantastic. Overall, this is a very nice stout that I'll try again without hesitation. It also paths the way to try other beers produce by Bell Brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my dad's favorite beer, but I can not say that myself. With that said, this beer is excellent. An excellent choice for all stout lovers."
""
"Another solid beer from Bell's . Very dark and creamy. I love a creamy stout with average head and dark color. Too bad i couldn't find this in six pack at the place i work at (Gay's Hops-N-Schnapps, Auburn Indiana). This is a stout i could drink day after day after day as creamy and addicting the flavor is. so smooth"
""
""
""
"This thing was all over the place for me. The aroma was excellent but unfortunately the taste did not follow the nose. The mouth feel was thin and not at all what I would expect from a stout and particularly a ""cream"" stout. This beer had some potential but honestly I was disappointed especially after smelling it."
"This is a great stout! my favorite stout is still the milk stout nitro by left hand brewing company but this is still very good. It is very smooth with a great Burnt coffee Finish. The smell is great, very Malty with vanilla and coffee and hints of chocolate. I like the texture but I love stouts. Stouts are my favorite type of beer and I feel that they should have a creamy texture. This beer could be a bit more creamy. It's a bit watery like Guinness but not too bad. I'm a stout man so I could easily session this beer but for someone who doesn't drink stouts this is not a session beer. I feel that I would drink this after a steak dinner or with a hamburger. Great stout better than the reviews on here had me thinking it would taste."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, mahogany highlighted, blackish-brown coloring with a creamy, fluffy, smooth, tall, light tan head that slowly settles into a filmy surface coat, leaving an impressive lacing along the glass. Aromas of cream first and foremost, with a subtle bittersweet mocha character in the backbone. Hints of vanilla and smoke, as well. Flavors are cream forward, with a rich and sweet blend, cut through with the bitterness of dark roast coffee, hints of baker's chocolate, and highlights of smoke. Very short lived sweetness, but it flashes back just as strong with every sip, only to be the Trojan horse for the bittersweet and smoky blend on the palate. Solid and balanced. Dry, light bodied, despite the robust flavors, but the beer is able to maintain a smooth feeling throughout. The bitter lingers through to the aftertaste, with a coffee theme, but there are also lingering hints of the creamy sweetness that started it all. Slick transition into a dry finish, with a bittersweet linger. Very easy to drink, both in body and ABV, and very flavorful. Solid beer."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 8/29/2013. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, toffee, light roast, cream, light vanilla, floral, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes with some light hops; and good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, light roast, cream, light vanilla, dark bread, and floral/roasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, cream, dark bread, and light roast on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of dark/roasted malt flavors; with no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Overall this is a very nice sweet stout. All around good balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Smoother than their Kalamazoo Stout variant. Medium bodied with a good balance of roast and hops. The finish is quite clean with a pleasant roast/hop lingering aftertaste. If you like ""tame"" stouts, this one fits the bill. If you wish to experience the best, then Founder's Breakfast Stout is my choice."

"O- Thought this was going to be a sweet milk stout by the name but even so a solid stout from a place known for great stouts. I think I will do a 50/50 mix with Expedition and get a taste of a non-BA Black Note."

"Poured into a 16 oz tulip, way passed its prime. Pours a very dark brown, with a light tan head that leaves plenty of lace. Smell is chocolate, biscuit, vanilla, and smoke. Taste is all of that, but not as nice. Body is thin to medium, enough carbonation, a little dry, and strong drinkability. This is o k, but it is several months past its prime."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring. The aroma begins things nicely, giving smoothness, heartiness, and functional sourness, much like an English porter. As we move to the taste, however, we get a beautiful blend of rich and roasty malts, sweetness, evenness, cleanliness, and inclusive darkness. The feel, too, is gloriously soft and smooth, glugging back with ease, and providing the drinker with pleasing closure at the end of each sip. This is an excellent beer, with robust and devilish flavoring, and something we will now look forward to each winter."
"A really smooth and easy drinking Cream Stout."

"Editing my review after having this again. Changing the smell from a 3.5 to a 3.75, the taste from 3.5 to a 4.0, the mouthfeel form a 4.0 to a 4.25, and overall from a 3.5 to a 4.0. I definitely like this beer more than when I initially reviewed it! It's an amazingly drinkable American Stout and tastes and smells better than I remember or my review previously said!"

"The mouthfeel of this beer is awesome. Thick but nothin too crazy, has an overall creamy rich feel to it. Carbonation is there but not overdone. This is a great s beer. You will have a hard time finding an American stout better then this unless you go to the brewery and grab the nitro version."

"First beer I've had the pleasure of enjoying from the guys at Bell's. Poured from a twelve ounce bottle into a tulip glass. Beer came out jet black but ran smooth down the glass, not overly viscous, I was a little surprised at the very little head that emerged. Smell; strong roasted malt and slightly sweet not much else yet. I Let the beer sit for about five minutes and some notes of coffee began to emerge. First sip very smooth roasted malt obviously comes through, the coffee i smelt earlier makes a strong entrance without overpowering. Second sip begins to reveal subtle flavor of burnt sugar and the creaminess of the beer becomes more noticeble. With a name like double cream stout i honestly wasn't sure what to expect of what to compare it to, but great beer overall."

"Overall - You're not getting any surprises with this beer. It hits all the notes you'd expect a 'double cream stout' to hit. When it's all said and done, though, the cream sweetness is just a tad too much for me to call this beer great. I don't think I could drink more than 2 of these before I'd have to throw in the towel. Hard to believe this is dairy free, which amazes me."

"Beer is medium-light in body, with medium-low carbonation. The resulting mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery, not particularly good for this style. Certainly smooth and creamy, but apparently at the expense of richness and fullness. Closes dry, with little residual stickiness across the palate."

"O- As of right now this is considered an ""exceptional"" beer. I think it's a good stout...not a session stout because of it's complex flavors, but probably something i'd buy again just to pick up on the different flavors."

"Extremely easy to drink. Lots of good flavor and only moderate alcohol. All bitterness is kept in check so you don't have to sip, you can chug it. Sad I've only got a six pack."

""
"Overall an ok beer. While it was fun to try, I would prefer more depth and creaminess in a double cream stout. I did appreciate some of the roasted subtleties here, but I doubt I'll be buying this one again."
""
"Overall-this beer is kind of a mixed bag for me, while I love the flavor everything else kinda falls flat. I wouldn't drink this beer regularly, but it is a nice detour from other stouts. ***On a side note I would love to know the ratio Bells mixes this with expedition stout for aging in barrels to make black note.*** 3.75"

""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice stout. Was hoping for more of a creamy or sweet characteristic, but the stout itself was tasty."
""
"Overall this was not a bad beer, not an exceptional example of this type of stout either. Creamy mouthfeel was not as creamy as ""double cream"" would suggest but creamy none the less. I wish I would've been able to try this one fresher as it was a month from Bell's suggested shelf life but I will give it another shot fresh next year."

"O- This is a deadly stout that is very highly drinkable!! Oh boy, if this was available in my area, I would have a new go to for the style! Rich flavors & aromas, superbly smooth and full, without being overbearing on the palate or stomach, I give this one very high marks and highly recommend this one to anyone who appreciates a super high quality stout!"

"I was very excited to try the Double Cream Stout from Bell's. That excitement, unfortunately, faded on my first sip. It pours nicely and looks great, but the first smell was a bit burnt to me and it didn't lend itself well to the taste. I found this one to be a bit more burnt and bitter than I would expect from a cream stout. I was truly disappointed in it. I had extra bottles left over from the sixer I bought so I offered some friends a try and got the same response from them. Unfortunately, this is not one of the beers that will be gracing my home any time soon."

"Overall: Definitely a great Stout. I would gladly try this again."

"From notes, 4/20/11. Black pour with dense, creamy brown foam atop. Aroma is roast, molasses, brown sugar, chocolate and a touch of tangy coffee. Velvety, creamy mouthfeel. Good malt sweetness with more cocoa, coffee and roast notes on the palate. An excellent sweet stout that packs a ton of flavor and a lush feel into a mere 6.1% abv."

"Black body with a creamy brown head, with almost a reddish tinge to it. Light retention and a bit of lace. Nose of sweet and dark chocolate, light roast and some vanilla. Some hazelnut as well. Taste has some roast, creamy/milk chocolate and dark malt character. Some metallic as well. Medium full body and carbonation was a bit high initially. I'm sure this would be delightful on nitro."
""
""
""
""
"O: Maybe I'm just spoiled by all the super flavorful stouts out there, but this just doesn't do it for me. Not bad, but not one I'd buy again."
"Overall - Another winner from Bell's. There is a nice balance of flavours and it tastes like it was made with quality ingredients. Not my favourite style of beer, but something I'm glad I tried."
""
""
""
""
"This was a very tasty stout. I wish I was able to drink more of this one."
"I just the rich aroma's and dark compexity of Bell's Double Cream Stout,it' smooth creamy and sweet taste give this stout a 'A' in my book,the over all essence of the tones blend well with it as it is roasted,the malts that are used play a key role in finishing this wonderful stout on the palate soft!"
""
""
""
"O - Great beer, and tastes like the name. Very creamy, and just enough sweetness"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall –Quite a tasty brew. It’s a “not too overly sweet” and fairly roasty cream stout. Well worth a try."
""
""
"O – This is a good stout. The aroma and flavor aren’t quite as robust as they could be and the mouthfeel is a little short of the wonderful, velvety feel that great stouts have, but this is still a tasty and drinkable beer with all the elements that it should have. It’s not a big stout, but no one ever said it should be. Nice beer from Bell’s."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste/feel: Up front you get that extremely creamy texture which is awesome -- smooth all the way through. The taste is somewhat burnt, which turns me off a good bit, but the bitterness isn't too extreme, and the super roasty malt flavors make it pretty drinkable. Overall, somewhat disappointed with this. The smell was promising, but the taste left a lot to be desired ... it's just sort of bland. Still, it's easy drinking."
"O- very drinkable with a pleasant chocolate linger on the back end. My wife hates beer, specifically stouts, and she actually didn't make her usually disgusted face when she tried this. The underlying roasted character gives it more drinkability and would be a good option for ose who don't quite have the palate for super roasted and smoky stouts."
""
" O : Bell's does make great beer and this no exception . Make a winter choice for sure and share it with friends."
"Overall, an amazing stout for only being 6%. There is a ton of flavor packed into a small package in addition to excellent body. A great winter beer."
""
""
"O: A toast to the roast of this incredibly rich, yet well-balanced and supremely flavorful American Stout! At 6.1% ABV, it would make for a nice after-dinner drink before or with rich vanilla custard or chocolate torte topped with raspberries. It's malts varieties play so well off one another, only adding roasted bitterness to the artfully used hops."
""
""
"O - A really solid stout, and as close as you can get to a coffee stout with actually having coffee added. Big aromas and flavors in a (relatively) small abv package. Really enjoyed it, and will buy again."

"Of all Bell's stouts, this was always my least favorite, but I remember liking it alot more. Besides the mouthfeel, it's not too memorable. Maybe it's not Bell's best work, but it's still a well crafted beer."

"Final Thoughts: I've been anticipating this beer's seasonal release but without incredibly high expectations. In the end it has left me satisfied with making the purchase of a sixer.

"Very solid stout. Malty/Roasty aroma - you definitely get the roasted barley. Thick mouthfeel and very roasty. Excellent on a cold, rainy fall day. This is a winter seasonal beer and should be enjoyed seasonally. Overall, another solid offering form Bell's."
"This is a nicely balanced, complex milk stout. The roasted malts are intense and the coffee flavors add a nice balanced bitterness. There's a nice creaminess and some toffee notes throughout. This is a very enjoyable beer. I'm not sure I would be able to have more than one of these at once, but I will definitely be having it again."

"O - For an out of the bottle cream stout, I thought this was pretty good. On nitro-tap, I think this beer would be a knock out. I would have also liked a little more decisiveness in the flavor...either more chocolate, or more cream. Since it's a cream stout, more cream would be great."

""
"D: This is a really nice drinkable stout that provides lots of rich flavor without the thick heavy and heavy body of an Impy. Has me wishing I picked up a full 6er. With the wetter finish the flavors do seem to drop out a bit quicker than desired but overall nicely done."
""
"I really hope people understand and are not mislead into thinking this is a milk stout or anything similar. It is a plain stout that has a rich and roasty creamy body that is full flavored, not sweet, but not too dry."
"O - This is a fantastic hit from Bells that I have had on a number of occasion but just now am getting around to reviewing, For those who love creamy, full bodied brews, look no further. Robust and contains the balance of some of the best."
""
""
"O-I think this is better than Kalamazoo, should have them side by side in the future. A tad more vanilla and this beer would be a lot better."
""
"O- I was honestly expecting a milk stout until I read the description. This really is a stellar beer though, the peanut taste I was getting was much better than my experience with the Uber Goober lol."
""
"This beer pours a very dark brown with a one finger tan head and heavy, nice lacing to the end. It's aroma is complex leading off with wood with nuts, chocolate and a hint of vanilla. The flavor is a superb blend of wood, coffee, and dark chocolate followed by milk chocolate and anise in the finish. The mouthfeel is full, creamy, and smooth. Bells Special Double Cream Stout is an outstanding brew, well balanced and very complex. Very highly recommended!!"
"O - This is a solid entry at a lower level abv stout. I typically drink imperial stouts, but I figured I'd give this a shot based on what they have on tap where I am. I don't regret my decision, unlike my first beer, Oberon."
"O-this is a pretty good beer. I have recently decided to raise my standards for a 4, and this I think still gets one across the board. Very nice blend of all the malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark black with tiny light brown head. Aroma is very roasty with lots vanilla, lactose, and chocolate. Taste is a nice balance of roasted coffee, toffee and chocolate, solid sweetness from the lactose. Full bodied but not syrupy. Good carbonation to keep the sweetness in check. This one is really good. No wonder they mix this in for some Black Note."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall very disappointed with this beer. The label is deceiving. I wanted sweeter and this was light with subtle roast and lacking the creamy body to support it. I also felt it was over carbonated for the style."
""
""
""
"WOW! That was my initial reaction when I popped this bad boy open. The beer was a beautiful golden shade of caramel. The aroma of the cream and barley is absolutely top notch! The beer poured perfectly, just the right amount of head and lace and the taste was out of this world. This by far is probably the smoothest beer I've ever had. Samuel Adams needs to watch out, because Bell is quickly becoming one of the best American breweries. This beer is just flat out amazing! I don't say this often, but this beer is an absolute must!"
"Nice brew."
"O- I remember this being better last year, but who's to say? After all, taste is subjective. Only paid $3.99 for a six-pack at Total Wine & More since it's technically out of season, so I'm not complaining!"

"O: Not the world changer some find it to be, Bell's Double Cream Stout is still a pretty darn good beer. If you're looking for a lot of flavor in your stout with a lower ABV, look no further."

"Bell's Double Cream Stout pours jet black, with a voluminous four fingers of caramel colored foam left sitting atop the beer. The head retention is fantastic, and lacing is left behind in a thick, weblike pattern. An absolutely gorgeous beer. The nose is fairly coffee heavy, but rather than the usual heavily roasted, black aroma, this smells like coffee with a bit of milk and sugar added. The flavor brings more of the same, though I'd say it has a little bit more roasty intensity than was found in the nose. The body is wonderfully creamy and smooth for a stout that's not imperialized in any way. It's paired with a nice, subtle carbonation that gives the beer a little life without taking away from the fact that this is a 100% malt driven beer. Bell's Double Cream Stout is one of the best regular stouts I've had, and a beer I'd buy regularly if Bell's was sold in NJ."

"Pours a nice dark head and has decent aromas of chocolate and caramel."
""
""
""
"Verdict: Certainly an interesting cream stout, the roasted flavors are definitely very strong and at times overly abrasive. The body is great though, glad to have tried it, but I probably won’t be seen hunting this one down again."

"Many thanks to Kzoobrew for the chance to taste this brew. Poured from bottle into Brooklyn tulip. Pours a light-bodied very dark brown/black. tan head, some lacing, very little head. Smell- raisins, vanilla, bready, brown sugar. Taste- molasses, deep rich caramel, definitely some raisins and vanilla, brown sugar, some mocha chocolate notes on the end with some nice roasty bitterness. This beer is much more complex and enjoyable than I expected. The play between the creamy texture and the borderline quad brown sugar and dark fruit flavors are enjoyable. This is a great beer in my book, that I would try again."

"I am finding that this stout is growing on me, becoming more complex and interesting as it warms. Definitely something to look for next winter, when my tastes turn back to porters and stouts."

"Mouthfeel: This is a very smooth and creamy stout no bitterness and is rather sweet. One of the easiest drinking stouts that I have came across."
"very good lighter stout, nice smooth taste that is malty but has a sweet and lingering malty drier coffee malt that comes through in an okay way. Is this a great stout depends what you think is a good stout or ale. Bell's is a shitty brewery run by bad man I hate to indorse Larry Bell but he did a good job and this is his best stout which isn't saying much."

"O - a very nice stout - probably may have gotten a higher rating had i not just had the java stout an hour ago (woops! and holy crap it's not even 9:30! this is what the life of a brewer is like, i suppose!)"
""
"O: This beer is very rich, smooth, and easy to drink. About what I would expect for a cream stout...well done!"
"O - I love almost all of Bell's beers and especially their stout. Cant wait until All Stouts Day again next year"
"Cheers!"
"Color is nearly pitch black; a moderately-sized dark tan head fades pretty quickly, with not much lacing. Smell is chocolate, with maybe some coffee notes. Roasted malts are prominent in the taste. Some dark chocolate notes in the background, with coffee flavors up front. Not terribly complex, but good. Mouthfeel was good but not as good as the ""double cream"" name might suggest."

"Overall, this was just a very average beer. Decent nose on it, a good stout taste but nothing special. Dont get me started on the mouthfeel.... I would have loved to have the nose and flavor of this beer on a Double Cream Stout body and not such a thin body. Very easy drinking and if I were wanting to have multiple stouts, this would be one to go for. I know I'm hitting this one a little hard, but I'm still very appreciative of this extra. But outside of Hopslam, Bell's continues to underwhelm me."
"Overall: Not a good beer for my second review, should have chose another but I need to jump into the deep end and get busy. I like the beer, though it seemed lacking. The first beer I have had from Bells, looking forward to the next brew from Comstock."
""

"In summary, this is one of the best stouts I have had. The smooth feel and subtle complexities will keep you drinking!"

"Cryptic freshness date. Poured from 12 oz bottle into a snifter. A - Dark with a tan head which quickly recedes, leaving spotty lacing. S - Rich chocolate and coffee notes with a characteristic roasted malt aroma. T - Milk chocolate and roasted malts with a slight acidity. Not overly complex. M - Smooth and creamy, like an oatmeal stout. Not a bad stout, but not the best I've had."

"Overall: Average but nothing spectacular at all. Definitely expect more from Bell's but certainly not a bad beer by any measure."
"Pours a solid black color with a creamy tan head that displays moderate retention and lace. Smells of roast, coffee, milk and dark chocolate, hints of sweet caramel and little to no hop aroma. Taste is sweet creamy and smooth. Whipped milk chocolate mousse with hints of mocha, caramel and roast. Sweet roasty creamy and flavorful. Medium body with a velvety smooth creamy silky mouthfeel and a light to moderate level of carbonation. That is a nice flavorful stout. Its hard to believe there is no lactose in there."

"This is an above average stout. I would certainly drink it again if I came across it, but I don't think I'll go out of my way to track a bottle down."

"I am relatively new to stouts, so I can't fairly compare this to any one in particular - but this was a very nice drink and the flavors/aromas blend very well for me."
""

"D - Pretty good. Better than I had remembered it from the glass. Very excited to half 64oz of it, but my wife tried it and dug it so looks like I'll have help finishing this with the game."
"one of the better american stouts ive come across. very nice roasted flavors and just super drinkable. ill revisist this in the future for sure. nothing extreme or out of the ordinary but they nailed the classic stout flavors just right IMO."
""
""
""
"Part of me wants to say this is pretty average for a stout. Nothing is intense or stands out, but instead this blend of flavors seems to work surprisingly well."
"Overall, very good, would definitely have again. Great flavor profile, good body without being overly strong, an excellent creamy stout."
"Pours black and bubbly in body with light tan head that sticks around. Hefty aroma of butterscotch, cream, light cocoa, and vague hop presence. Tastes of smooth milk chocolate, cream, light butter, cola, roast comes in towards the finish along with a hop bitterness and leaves a faint tobacco finish. Pretty heavy carbonation in the mouthfeel and medium bodied. The flavors are welcomed but the carbonation turns me off. Wish it wasn't as fizzy on the palate and thicker in body."

"I Had another bottle of this on 26 NOV 2012 and it left me with the same impressions. This time the beer actually finished drier than previously, which was a greater disappointment. While this is a wonderful stout, it does not feel creamy."
""
""
"O: A pleasant, well-balanced, highly drinkable stout with good substance."
"Pours a black color with a thin cocoa head. Average lacing on the side of my CBS snifter. The nose is malt, chocolate, coffee. Fairly simple, and a little weak nose. The taste is a bit better. Chocolate, malt, vanilla, and a slight hint of coffee here. Very smooth and creamy in feel, with a somewhat dry finish. Overall, a good brew that I'd have again. Cheers."
""
""
"O: I was shocked how much I liked this beer. It is a fantastic stout. I love the taste as it is a festival of flavors but in a calm and elegant delivery and each one balanced perfectly with the next. Officially one of my absolute favorite beers and if it's on tap, I'm getting it."

"O - Man, this is an amazing stout. This might even be better than the BBC's Bourbon Barrel Stout. The flavor isn't quite as evolved and complex as I remember it, which might just be from this particular bottle (maybe light struck?) or batch. Either way, it's still a great beer. 4.5"

"D/O: This is a respectable export stout whose lactose qualities are, perhaps, the least impressive features. Sweetness is understated and mouthfeel is unremarkable, compared to other examples of the style--although it does possess some noted unctuous angles in the smell and flavor. Strained ""milk"" descriptors aside, it is dark and flavorful and does not stray into ""strong"" territory, which makes it balanced and drinkable."
"The mouthfeel lived up to the expectation of a double cream with lush, silky, viscous, qualities nicely cut by the bittersweet chocolate. I like the 6.1% ABV which gives it that little extra oomph that some milk stouts cry for."
""
"The appearance is dark brown with a short cream colored head. Double Cream Stout has a a smell of toffee, vanilla, dark chocolate, and a burned aspect too. It tastes of roasted malts, more coffee and dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is kinda creamy as the name would lead one to guess. An enjoyable and quaffable stout."
"While I remembered this beer being better than I thought it was today, it remains a very solid beer for its style. It is quite impressive what Bell’s is able to do with malt in a beer that has no special ingredients."
""
""
"Strong aroma is quite smoky with notes of burnt coffee and caramel and a hint of licorice. It pours a luscious opaque sable with a fairly thick and fine-bubbled, if not too persistent, head. Mouth-filling flavor has burnt coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and licorice notes with a hint of caramel. Smooth, firm-bodied texture has a fair amount of fizz and leaves a smoky, tingly finish. I had this before on tap, and as good as it is in a bottle, as with most beers it is better from a keg or barrel."

"Dark brown in appearance with a finger head and no retention. There is a slight roasty smell that would be better if it were more upfront. The malt taste is a bit thin. There is a pleasant coffee finish, but this entire offering lacks the distinct roasted bite that would make it complete."
"O- A great smooth crazy tasting stout, Bells does great things as always."

"Pours very dark brown near black with a thick medium tan head in when using a snifter. Good nose of roasted and sweet malts with a bready essence. The brew leasves a beautiful lacing in the glass.

"O: really enjoy this beer. Creamy, balanced nicely, not overly burdensome and quite tasty. Well done."
"This brew pours up very dark, opaque, with a micro-bubble soft pillowy head of medium size...the smell is strongly of malt and slightly of alcohol. Taste is malty, smoked/roasty on the back end and the mouthfeel is ideal, smooth. Overall, a decent offering, don't know if I can palate the smoked feature any more. Glad I tried it!"
"o: double cream indeed. simply a solid creamy, sweet, coffee flavored stout. quite drinkable. another good one from Bell's."
"O - A solid stout. Provides the profile with a ""double-creaminess"" that makes it go down quite easy without losing the character."
"Overall: Bell's stouts are great choices. Different from Kalamazoo, but just as good."
"O- Worth trying just for the nice mouthfeel. The flavors are only slightly above average, but in it's totality it's a good stout."
"O - If you want a creamy and sweet stout, look no further. I was very impressed with the Double Cream Stout - it does a marvelous job of balancing the sweet flavors with the roasted character of the stout. Fantastic beer!"
"Overall though I really like the nose on this beer and it's the most impresssive thing about it, so I don't seem to mind ramming my shnoze in the glass and having another sip."
"Overall, a very nice stout. I love the creamy flavor, it offsets some of the bitter coffee flavors you get with most stouts yet you don't lose the traditional stout flavor. Not as creamy as I was expecting but a very good stout."
"Overall, a nice, smooth, flavorful stout."
"O: A nice, easy drinking stout with a ton of complex aromas and flavor. To strike the balance of smooth and complex is seemingly not an easy task. This is a really nice brew and I commend Bell's on a job well done."
"cheers"
"Incredible."
"It's got more to it than their kalamazoo stout, but doesn't fill you up like the expedition. A somewhat special stout that won't knock you over."
"O - A good stout, but not one that I would return to too often."
"B - This is a tasty brew, as previously stated nice balance, not too sweet or heavy, great beer to have with a nice stew on a cold winter's evening."
"O - Very nicely done for the nice without the huge alcohol, roasted, barrel flavors."
"A very enjoyable stout from one of my favorite breweries."
"This one pours a milk chocolate brown in color, very smooth and creamy, medium in bodied, with a beige lacing around the glass. It smells of creamy chocolates, light roast, light coffee, witha slight bitterness and a slightly sweet and creamy finish. It is very smooth and finishes light. The flavors consist of smooth and creamy milk chocolate with a light and slightly bitter roast. It's excellent. The aftertaste is both light and very appealing. It is exceptionally smooth and drinks perfectly for the style. It's too drinkable and perfect for cold weather. I love this one."
"overall: a very good light stout. won't fill you up like expedition but has enough flavors to satisfy most stout lovers."
"O: A good stout. A bit strong in flavor and sweetness."
"BOA - race of a thousand camels"
"Pours a dark brown, nearly black body with less than a centimeter of beige head. There’s some nice strands of bubbles that sift through the surface of the liquid, but there is little-to-no retention of the head itself. Tiny, scattered patches of bubbles remain as lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee grounds, caramel, and toasted/burned sugar. Some dark fruits come together in the rear. The taste is of dark fruit, molasses, a touch of milk chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and a hoard of cane sugar. The sugar carries over into the mouth, where is leaves a very sticky, resinous finish to the seemingly thinner beer. Overall, a decent stout, but it seems to have an overpowering sugar sensation that is not quite balanced with the rest of the flavors."
"Notes: This is one of my favorite stouts Bell's has to offer. Full-bodied, and rich in flavor, yet very well-balanced. It has superb drinkability, and pulls off a style of beer that normally calls for other ingredients to give it the flavor and mouthfeel it has."
"Overall, this is a cool beer. Much like a chocolate stout that uses no chocolate, I like that this beer can achieve the aspects of a milk stout without anything added in. A great sitting beer and one that gets better as it warms."
"The taste is great. I love this beer. It's malty and toasty. I'm really feeling some coffee with this beer, far more pronounced than the nose. Slight hints of chocolate and a really wonderful bitterness throughout."
"O- Another solid offering from Bell's. A nice stout that hasn't been imperialized, just a nice brew. Very drinkable, a good stout to intro someone to the style."
"Appearance is dark, very dark. Poured from a bottle there's almost no head, and later a thin rapidly sinking lacing. Smells of vanilla, nutmeg, raisin, molasses, fruit, red licorice, black licorice. Taste is bold with spicy raisin and coffee up front. Quickly gives a blast of cocoa and roasted malt. The licorice notes aren't far behind. Extremely creamy mouthfeel, very light prickly carbonation. A bit too syrupy and sugary for me, but I suppose that's the idea of a double cream stout. Still, I wish there was something to counterbalance the sweetness and gummy residue. Taste is complex and very interesting. For fans of the style this is not to be missed."
"Overall, I've never been truly disappointed by Bell's, and this is no exception. It's a very good beer, though not a great beer."
"O - Not a bad cream stout, but not in elite territory."
"O: Impressive stout, to say the least. They just one-upped a whole lot of stouts in the world."
"O-It's good. I'd drink this many times again."
"Overall: Very tasty and appealing brew. Mouthfeel and taste slightly outshine the other qualities. It's somewhat standard but also of tremendous quality. I'm definitely a fan of Bell's Special Double Cream Stout."
"Overall, a very good beer. One of my favorites in the fall/winter. Low enough in abv to drink several, but tasty. This isn't a study in subtle layers of flavor, but a study of how to make a very tasty non-imperial stout. Another great Bells fall/winter offering...like all of them."
"O- Only great things to say about this. They did a fantastic job playing up the soft sweet flavors a stout can produce. Well keep coming back to this beer!"
"Overall: Smooth, malty, sessionable goodness. Definitely recommend this one. No real flaws. It lives up to be the type of solid milk stout that one would expect from Bell's."
"Overall: nice beer, I enjoyed it but it was not as creamy as I thought it would be, more of a dry stout in my opinion, but good."
"Overall Drinkability - Enjoyable. Some of the soy sauce charater dissipates over time and with each sip, which is great because it's a big flaw otherwise.4"
"Another highlight of the 2011 Brass Hat Brewing Brew Fest in Watertown, CT last weekend, this Bell's beauty shows an opaque brown-black with a thin but solid light brown head. Lacing follows suit and coats nicely. The aroma leads heavily with prominent coffee like a classic ""milky"" regular. Undercurrents of light chocolate and sweet seaweed round it out interestingly. The flavor really nails my remembrances of good old fashioned cream soda with plenty of vanilla and light coffee mixed in, along with a sweet dose of chocolate milk. A bit of a treat, perhaps on the dessert side of the beer world but not terribly so. Although it had a somewhat milky feel, I didn't find it perfectly creamy. It was actually a bit aqueous and a little thinner than I anticipated, medium-light bodied to my tastes, especially after a few imperial stouts! It was fairly drinkable for the style, especially if you have a fondness of soda-like brews and sweet treats. I liked it fine though i probably expected a little more guts from a Bell's brew."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"Pours the blackest of black with a thin head that quickly recedes. Very coffee/chocolate forward nose. Taste heavily leans towards chocolate and burnt malt. A hint of vanilla and cherry in the background. The mouthfeel is the only real ding. I don't get the smooth and creamy here. It's much more on the astringent side of things, although I've had worse in that regard. Overall, it's a pretty decent stout. Not one I'd run around looking for, but I wouldn't shy away from it were it offered to me."
"Mind: A nice stout. Other than a slightly higher than normal creaminess out of a bottle, pretty standard, but well executed."
"Overall: This is a tasty stout, but it isn't quite as creamy as I was hoping. All things considered I am still happy to have five more in my fridge, but I was just expecting something slightly different."
"I give a Schlitz about this stout."
"I really liked this one!"
"Overall: bells doesn't disappoint. Drinkable, flavorful and complex taste."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer much more so than I expected because I have been really displeased with the majority of Bells offerings that I have sampled to date. I had this following Dieu Du Ciel Aphrodisiaque and although it was no where as good, it held it's own in the flavor department. Not a beer I will turn away if offered and I would have it again. Glad I sampled it for sure."
"Overall a very a good stout, nice flavor and enjoyable."
"SkÅL!"
"Overall: While it’s not that complex, and it certainly is dialed back a little from more other stouts on the market, it is extremely drinkable and has some good flavors kicking around in the bottle - another solid job by Bell’s. They had me scared there for a moment on this one."
"O: Tasty. Stouts aren't my favorite style, but I enjoyed this beer quite a bit."
"Not outstanding, but overall a pretty solid stout with complexity."
"O. Overall it is a good beer. I wouldn't have a problem ordering this in a bar. However I wasn't blown away by the flavor. It seemed to be very one sided. The initial cream sweetness holds through, but not as many other flavors come out after. I feel like even with a year under it's belt, this beer might not round out."
"O: Great stout. Very reminiscent of Deschutes' Obsidian Stout. These beers could be brothers. Obsidian gets a slight edge in my book because of the bigger smokiness. Any East Coast lovers of this beer NEED to try Obsidian."
"Pleasant rich dark ale. Quite nice roasted malt flavor. Caramel with a darker overtone. Distinct touch of cocoa. quite creamy in the mouth with a quick pour, but carbonation dissipates. Handsome dark reddish brown in the glass topped with a beige head. Good on drinkability. Only modest bitterness. Faint touch of sourness and a good dose of burnt malt along with the mellower flavors."
"Grateful we have another three bottles to reevaluate this nice cream stout."
"Thanks, Urbancaver, for another great one, and thanks Walows for sharing it with me."
"Overall, I haven't visited this brew in a number of years and I forgot what I was missing. Bell's nails a easy drinking and complex stout."
"Overall, this is a excellent representation of the style and one of the better stouts I have had. I would suggest this to any stout drinker out there who has yet to have the pleasure of enjoying this one."
"The pour created an impressive finger of deep-tan head with excellent retention. Color was obsidian black, allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose had a sweetish smell, like dried dark fruits, underlain by a light smokiness. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with tastes of dark chocolate, dried dark fruits, smoke and charcoal in the mouth. Wow! Finish was incredibly silky smooth, very chocolaty, especially on the extreme finish. I have been on a stout kick the last day or so and this struck me as more of a dessert beer/stout, given its lingering sweetness. This was the third (!) different way that I have had this beer and each time, it was enjoyable. That has to count for something."
"O: A very good stout. Not particularly deep or complex, but great flavors, a real pleasant creaminess, and overall a very enjoyable drink."
"D/O- Packs the flavors in at 6.1%abv. A nice after dinner treat. Thanks MammothBrew!"
"The mouthfeel is full, rich not well carbonated, and creamy."
"From my weekend notes: Roasty, so roasty, with a chocolate-cream heart and a dry soul, this bottle makes for quite the tasty pint. The nose makes for no big hoopla, as does the pour; not the best opening, no, but the flavor makes up for lost ground. Full of bitter cocoa and roasted malt, but with a modestly hoppy finish that accentuates the blackened fade. The feel is bubbly yet with a decadent smoothness that makes this brew disappear much too quickly. Nice stout."
"Pours an opaque black with a huge 3 inch khaki head that fades to a small cap. Nice rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, chocolate caramel, and aromas of dark fruit. Taste is of dark roasted malt and dark fruit with subdued coffee and cocoa flavors on the finish. Very mild bitterness on the palate quickly fades. This beer has a low almost flat level of carbonation making it thick and chewy in the mouth. Overall, this is a pretty good stout that apparently uses 10 different malts. I am glad I got to try this one but I wouldn't get it again most likely."
"D: This is a really good beer, very malty, but it really works with this beer. It has very good flavor and is highly drinkable, if only I could get Bell's in MA."
"This is a very nice one from Bell's; aside from being a very good beer, pick this one up to satisfy a craving for malts or if you want something sweet."
"Dark black with hints of red in the light. Very little head or lacing. The smell is sweet, malty and roasty with hints of dark cocoa, rich chocolate, and roasted coffee with a touch of vanilla. The taste is very smooth with rich chocolate notes, a hint of burnt caramel, roasted coffee tones, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is chewy, creamy, chalky, smooth, silky chocolate velvet. Very tasty and smooth. Awesome beer."
"O~ A very good beer, one I make sure I snag a 6er of at least, each season it rolls out..."
"A real treat. This is a creamy, relatively sweet, chocolatey stout, with enough bitterness to balance, with a vibrant vanilla hint throughout that really makes this a spectacular brew with plenty of depth."
"Overall: A nice ale that could be more full-bodied but still manages to please. Recommended."
"D- Overall, a good light-bodied stout. Something I'd like to try on nitro."
"This brew pours out as a black thick liquid, it's got a creamy brown head. The lacing is pretty decent on this brew. The smell is rich and roasted, has a slight sweetness to it as well. The taste is on the stronger side. It's got a good roasted malt base that carries the beer from start to finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thicker than some of Bell's beers. Overall it's not a bad brew, it's worth revisiting for sure."
"Overall-Nice stout. Nice late night stout right before bed. Refreshing and sweet. Would go great with some chocolate cake. Another winner from Bells"
"Stouts from Bell's and I haven't always gotten along so well, but Double Cream is solid."
"Finish. Just north of ok. If it finished the way it smelled it would be a home run, but instead its a hard hit double that just missed being a triple."
"O: A good beer, would be a touch better if the flavors were a bit bolder, but still very good and lives up to its name of being creamy. A stout that I could drink a few of for sure."
"O: I think I got a bad bottle. Had this on tap before and liked it. This seems just...bad."
"O- A good beer that I would get again if it was available locally for a decent price. Not one I'd seek out though. The drinkablility was good."
"M- Near perfect. Creamy like no other. Goes down with such ease."
"D: Another solid offering from Bell's. Nothing about it is really special, but I wouldn't hesitate to drink it again."
"Because of its sweet character, this beer probably won't appeal to everyone. However, if you're into creamy, chocolaty, easy-drinking stouts you'll feel right at home. Personally, I really enjoyed it and had a difficult time setting the glass down!"
"Drink - Good carbonation."
"D: My friend that gave me this did so because in three + hours he'd only drank 2.5, and I'm not surprised."
"T: The mouthfeel absolutely steals the show here. Incredibly creamy and velvety. Notes of roasted malt, milk chocolate, molasses and cream soda with a slightly bitter finish with a touch of dark roasted coffee. Pretty nicely done."
"D- aside from the extreme richness, this one goes down without effort. the drawback however is that i feel like i just ate a huge wedge of chocolate cake, not that that's a bad thing. aroma and feel win. belly feels good. despite the company's explanation, lactose or no lactose, with a name like double cream stout i would have expected something a bit sweeter."
"O - a very good beer that was very enjoyable to drink."
"Overall impression: A flavorful, dark malt dominated American stout. I'm not sure it would fit the style guidelines for an American Stout due to the lack of hop character but that's probably the best style for this beer. Bell's can make a great stout and this is no different. Easily quaffable and nicely done. Recommended."
"Overall - This is smooth, sweet and easy to drink. Not overly sweet, yet still has some stout kick to it. I get no alcohol in each drink. A nice twist on a stout, i enjoyed mostly cause it wasnt overly sweet. Great beer from a great brewery."
"A strictly black pour with a thin mocha cap. Aromas of caramel, toasted hops, mocha, and coffee are all distincly present and making my mouth water. A very creamy brew with great toasty notes with a lactic finish that lets you know that the cream is ther. The carbonation is nice on the pallet and the full bodied brew is creamy and thick going down the hatch. The bittnerness does get a little harsh after a full pint and is actually a little mroe typical of a chocolate stout. Overall the beer is very drinkabel though maybe only slightly out of bounds with regard to style."
"O: As mentioned in the taste portion, this begs to be drank. On my next trip to Bowling Green, I may pick up an entire 6 pack of this if available."
"Not too bad this one but not a beer which blows you out of your socks."
"O - A pretty darn sweet milk stout. Alot of dark sweetness in this one."
"O: A much roastier, sweeter stout than usual but still excellent. Easy to drink due to smoothness."
"Overall: Definitely some alcohol present in this, despite the moderate level."
"D- 4.5 This is a very tasty stout that isn't all that heavy and has a very good flavor profile. I'm a big fan of coffee and the sweetness that is combined with it in here from the malts works very well and isn't overbearing. For the style I could drink as much of this one as any. This is a solid offering from Bell's."
"This brew is medium/full bodied. Mouthfeel is silky cremy and a bit sticky. It rich and rewarding. Definetly worth a try."
"Full bodied and moderately smooth. Good carbonation level with a surprisingly clean bitter finish. Not quite what I expected, not really a milky or creamy feel, but still good and smooth, very drinkable. All in all a pretty good stout, not quite what I expected, but very good."
"Overall- A very good stout and a shining star in Bell’s offerings, Creamy and easy drinking, this is one that you could drink all night. Personally I liked it and would definitely drink this again."
"Overall a very enjoyable well balanced yet well flavored stout."
"I thought the ""double cream"" stout would be related to the flavor not the mouthfeel, unfortunately not the case. The flavor is interesting but not what I had hoped for, however, the mouthfeel is worth giving it shot."
"This one is designed for drinking all through your session. Delicious. Smooth. Easy."
"M - Creamy is the word. Even the carbonation isn't too biting. My only critique is that it could be a bit thicker, but at 6.1% ABV, it's hard to really achieve that big body typical of Russian Imperials."
"Drink and overall: Honestly, Bell's has some fantastic stout. The list goes on and on, but this one is a personal favorite. Great balance, and awesome texture/flavor profile. Always a treat when I can enjoy one of these guys."
"O - Another nice offering from Bell's. Really nice stout and one that I think could be consumed multiple times in a sitting."
"Overall this is pretty drinkable. A lot of flavor and a very good mouthfeel. Not my favorite stout by any means, but I'll have another."
"O: This is an extremely tasty beer that I feel falls just short of my favorites of the style (Left Hand Milk Stout and Terrapin Moo-Hoo) which is less a knock on this excellent offering by Bells than it is a testament to the quality of those other two brews. Given that Terrapin doesn't distribute this far north, I would easily buy this if Left Hand pulled out of Wisconsin."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Poured completely black with a brief dark beige head that left a wispy cap. A few lazy lacings on the glass with each sip. Sweet chocolate aroma is dominant with rich roasted malt and light coffee aromas as well. Thick, creamy feel. A bit more carbonation than I expected, but pleasant nonetheless. Nice balance of chocolate and roasted malt flavors in the beginning with coffee flavors rolling through the middle, leading to a prominent hoppy finish. Hop bitterness lingers a bit. Smooth and tasty with a nice variety of aromas and flavors."
"Pours a dark black with a finger of tan foamy head. Nose is sweet with cocoa, espresso notes, dark and complex malts, a sense of roasted beans. Taste is full; good coffee flavour mixed with roasted malts. Sweet and bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, creamy yet smooth and dry. A decent stout but not mind blowing or Bells best."
"O - One of my favorite stouts. I have a hard time keeping it in my fridge."
"O A better than good beer. Appearance and smell could be better. taste was very good, which is the most important thing."
"Yummy Yums! The Bro's say Bell's beer taste too oxidized...too bad they do not live 20 miles from the brewery cuz mine is as fresh as the morning dew. This stout has a Dark rich brownish-black with a gorgeous creamy head pour. Complex notes of malts. I like my stouts to be more robust and less chocolaty. This one delivers nice and sweets with a smooth finish. My new favorite stout. Thanks again Michigan for making me smile with great beer."
"A nice stout, but a bit underwhelming. I know everything doesn't have to be big, but with special in the name, I was hoping there would be something of the sort. Still, a nice and very drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel lives up to the beer's name: creamy, smooth, velvety texture is a great match for the milk chocolate flavors. Drinkability is high due to the smoothness of the beer, lower abv for the style, and softer flavors. I really like the balance this beer has and the fact that it isn't going for a world record in some chocolatey or coffee-like category - this is just a well made stout that doesn't do anything extraordinarily, but doesn't do anything really wrong either."
"D: i really enjoyed the mouthfeel on this brew. im assuming oats were used and they definitely add that creaminess that is mentioned in the name."
"Overall: Good flavors, but just a bit too much carbonation level for me. Very creamy and smooth despite the carbonation though, and the sugary sweetness matches the malts just right. For such a dark beer, the flavors are fairly mild. Nothing really overpowering as far as the flavors go, and they fit together nicely."
"easy to drink andvery well balanced !"
"drinkability - full flavored and quite tasty, gorgeous in the glass"
"Drinkable, very much so, would order another."
"Highly regarded and recommended."
"D- THis is a great beer! this has great balance and i would get this beer again anytime!"
"I wouldn't make this a go-to stout"
"The mouthfeel? It's creamy, as said above, also is fairly thick. Delicious. the drinkability is quite good, it does drink like it's a bit higher in ABV though. A great stout, I'm glad I picked up the last single at a local bottle shop. Recommended."
"d: I don't need another. It tastes quite good and the roasted flavor is a big hit with my tastebuds, but the thickness would get to me after a while. One is plenty. I would consider buying again at some point, but I have a few other stouts with this flavor that aren't as heavy and more my type."
"D- A nice drinking beer for a colder night. A little bit higher ABV will keep you warm but also overall limits the beer in terms of pint after pint drinking. A nice stout like usual from Bell's. Always look forward to this one coming out."
"Wow that's dark... Black as a matter of fact. Head is brown stiff and sticky. First smell is yeasty roasty and slight metallic. There's something unpleasant in the smell that I can't place (barnyard, wet leather?) Taste has that same unpleasantness. It got a little better as it burned off during warming. Dispite this distration I do get some nice chocolate with a pretty nice dry finish that not to puckering. Mouthfeel is leaning toward creamy with a body surprisingly lighter than expected but not watery by any means. Still that being said I'll finish this one but probably won't seek it out again. Sorry Bell's."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. I like the fact the roasted malts do not dominate, but it is still a solid stout. It just tastes like a Bell's stout."
"This was pretty darn good, frankly I'm surprised. I'd gladly have this again."
"Drinkability - I've had better, more robust, complex Stouts, but this one is solid enough to be considered a good example. Very easy to drink and worth a shot if you see it. Nothing over complicated. More than anything a no-nonsence, pretty enjoyable Stout."
"The two things that stand our are the its thick mouthfeel and the stunning visual appearance."
"Drinkability - very good brew. The combination of all of the malts makes an interesting taste. Nice and complex."
"D: Quite drinkable do to it's smoothness, not as filling as one might expect from a double cream either."
"D: The sweetness and not quite extraordinary taste keep this from going down too quickly, but I did enjoy this glass."
"Carbonation doesn't seem high but the bubbles make this feel a bit crisp on the tongue. Smooth creamy mouthfeel otherwise but not syrupy or overtly heavy. Nice long finish that is roasty and sweet -- very nice! Excellent brew, great drinking!"
"D: There is almost too much malt to this brew. If that's your thing, then you may love it. To me, this didn't really taste like a stout, it tasted like a more 'brown' style of beer."
"D: Decent ABV coupled with a very interesting taste range and creaminess. I'm not a huge fan of stouts like this but this is a great beer for certain occasions."
"From notes, November 2010. Pours a deep brown, almost black, with minimal head that remains as a bit of foam on the surface. Smell is of roasted malt with a bit of hop bitterness following it. Mouthfeel is very good - smooth, rich, about medium for a stout, with that odd creamy coating feeling that milk stouts often have. Taste is good and well-balanced, with a strong sweet roasted malt flavor up front that's complemented by just the right amount of hops. A very solid stout, though the flavor could be more complex."
"D - yeah. I'll have another."
"Served on-tap at Charlie Hooper's in KC. Nice looking pour, 1/2 inch dark head over midnight black beer. Smell is really faint but mostly of roasted malts. This is a mild, creamy, tasty stout. Malts predominate, not sensing any hops. Not much bitterness or too much roasted flavor. A very good choice as a session beer for a stout."
"Pours a thick opaque pitch black . Thick is an unstatement which I believe hinder this beer a bit. Very cream soda-esque. While the flavors of roast malts, coco, and coffee and hoppy alcohol bite at the finish was nice, the heavy cream is fatiguing and muddled the nuances of this brew a bit. Nevertheless, this a sip & enjoy kinda brew."
"D - A mid-level ABV and the vast array of flavors and feel make this fun to drink. Definitely worth seeking out. The profile gives the most after it warms a bit so sip this one."
"D: It seems Bell's can do no wrong -- I have yet to have any of their beer that is even mediocre. Great beer; recommended."
"Drinkability is just right for this beer, great flavor and mouthfeel."
"D - Definitely could drink a few bottles of this in one session. Drinks very nicely for a stout with that much flavor. I can only imagine what this would be like on tap, especially a nitro tap."
"The CPJ"
"D: Another great brew from Bells, never disappointed with this brewery. Will definitely have another."
"Overall it has a very nice mouthfeel, however at this price point I expect it to be a lot more balanced."
"It is not my favorite beer, and I can recommend many more before this one. However, in no way is it a bad beer with its dark color and hearty stout taste."
"A very dark pour that yields a on finger khaki brown head that recedes very quickly into a thin ring around the edges with minimal lacing. Smell of dark roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is of sweet toasted malts/chocolate and caramel that finishes dry despite how sweet it begins. Each sip is better than the rest as it warms and the carbonation mellows the creamy smoothness this bottle claims begins to come through. I would easily drink a few of these as the booze is low."
"D: close to room temp this really just goes down so easy and i could see a future with a few more. its a nice break from the huge viscous stouts ive been settling in with so far this winter."
"Nov 2011: Forgot I previously reviewed this one. Looking back on my old review I still feel the same. Style is along the lines of beer I favor, but overall it's quite an ordinary brew. There are roasted flavors throughout, and a slight hop bitterness, but fairly blah."
"D- Pretty good beer, takes some time to drink and I dont think I would want more than one, but pretty drinkable for a stout. ABV is lower than I would like for a beer this big though, could use more warmth and a bigger ""punch"" to it."
"I have no idea what took me so long to enter a review for this guy. This era ends now. It pours a sleek obsidian topped by a finger of light sandy ecru foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, light vanilla, light maple syrup, and very light molasses. A mild sweetness hangs above it all, a whisper confirming the style. The taste ups the roast ante a bit and adds a touch of coffee, but, beyond that, everything else from the smell remains constant. The body is a slightly hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and a silky feel. Overall, other than a carbonation a smidgen too active for my tastes here, this is a great milk stout. Get some."
"D- Good drinkability for a heavier stout."
"D: Easy drinker for sure, definitely a well crafted beer. Only managed to drink a quarter of it through this review, but it definitely goes down easily."
"I really like this one and it is a great malty stout."
"The bottle has a batch number proudly stamped on it, no freshness date. Pours a thick oily black color, dark brown one finger head, decent lacing. Dark roasted malt hits the nose first, a bit of chocolate and coffee as well. It has a bitter taste, with roasted malt and a bit of espresso, very creamy as the description says. Good, but a bit thin feeling in the taste. Mouthfeel is extraordinarily creamy and complements the taste. Drinkability is above average, the sweetness brings it down a tad."
"There's not much alcohol flavor to it, and it makes a solid chocolate filled stout leaning fairly heavily towards the dark chocolate side. Very drinkable and quite tasty. Would definitely recommend."
"as soon as I poured this bell's special cream stout, I knew it meant business. tit pours black as pitch with a golden caramel head. The smell is slighter that I would expect. The taste is a robust blackness. It is blackened and chocolaty. It's a good cold evening beer. You don't pound this beer, it pounds you.... With flavor lulz."
"Drink- Very smooth and very drinkable."
"Goes down quite easy. A very good quality beer. Nothing thrilling, but a good stout."
"A very nice beer. Nothing thrilling, but a good beer."
"d: I find this beer enjoyable and drinkable but not at an exceptional level."
"D: Drinkable, but there are better cream stouts out there. Get the feeling this one is rated well because it's Bell's, not because it's great."
"Pours a nice deep, dark brown. A whippy, darkish-tan head clings all over the glass. Smell is very nice. Earthy malts with a bit of mineral. Taste is sweet and milk-chocolatey more than anything. A creme brulee of beer. Ends rather dry with a touch of bitter. Feel is a little creamy, yet pithy at the same time. A little reserved, but it's exactly what this beer set out to do, and it was good to sample. Drinks good, but I like a bit more 'oomph' in a stout."
"o- Overall I think that this beer could definately use something else in the flavor. It is not that this beer is bad, but more like it is ""lacking something""."
"A pleasure to drink - and more than one. Great work!"
"D: I must say for not being much of a fan of Bell's brews I really do love this one! Can I have another?!"
"Tasty brew, but probably better fresh and a bit sweet for my liking. The carbonation is flatish, which hurts the appearance, nose, and palate. A bit watery and thin for the style."
"D: Really good."
"D: this had to be an off batch, but I will review what I purchased. This was extremely disappointing with the dominating sourness. Hopefully this review doesn't get deleted like my review of thomas hardy's. This is just godawful, like drinking vinegar. I hate that this looks decent because it deserves a lower score. I would honestly rather have a bud light right now, but am masochistically punishing myself to finish it in order to have a legit review. I hate myself for opening this beer as my nightcap. The only beer I ever had which was more challenging to finish was the aforementioned thomas hardy's. Each sip is like acid eating away my entire digestive system."
"Drinkable and clean, this one has a lower enough alcohol volume to be one you go back to, and it feels about the same. I dig. It's a stout that's basically like a milk stout, but has a bit of hop character to keep it interesting."
"D: It isn't too strong or thick but it isn't very drinkable. The flavors get a bit annoying like the rest of Bells's stouts. I don't get it."
"The mouthfeel was a little thinner than expected. Moderate carbonation. Not one of my favorite Bell's beers."
"It becomes smoother and roastier as it warms."
"Overall I thought it was a good beer, but I enjoy ""louder"" stouts. This was mild and from what I understand I need to try the Expedition!"
"D: Sweet and creamy. I liked it; I'd say it's worth trying."
"Another good beer from a great brewery."
"Drinkability: Great seasonal beer for drinking once a year. Outside of that, this beer isn't something I'd search out."
"Drinkability is excellent. This is definitely falling into my regular rotation of brews. A must try for Stout fans."
"The ""cream"" comes in the swallow. Surprisingly, there's no sourness that I associate with the style. Coffee (without cream) up front. A very easy to drink stout--smooth. Body and carbonation is accurate."
"Scary how think can easy become a session beer."
"D: Easy drinker and great character, a must try."
"Overall, Bell's SDCS is a good stout for what it is. It's not going to blast your taste buds, but it is sufficiently complex to be enjoyable and could be drank in earnest. I'm glad I got the chance to try this one and I would happily have another."
"Overall- I'm very impressed with this beer. It's tasty and unique and recommend others to try this."
"D-Hard to drink a pint of this unless you like smoky/peppery style beers"
"D. Not nearly as imposing as I thought it would be, which actually lends itself to drinkability. It really is creamy."
"Pretty dark black with a hint of ruby. Ruby/tan head that is about 1"" or so and dissapates quickly leaving small islands with a bit of lacing. Smell is rich in malty overtones. Very sweet smelling. Strong vanilla, chocolate, and toffee flavors among the ""10 malts"" that are used. Smell is excellent for a beer and one of the best points. Taste is definitely creamy and milky along with the aforementioned malts. It's a delectable stout. The finish is some toasted bitter coffee and kind of brings a nice clean finish to the sweet malty beginning. Gets better with every taste. Well brewed and crafted. Medium bodied with light carbonation. I will definitely seek this one out again."
"12oz bottle purchased by my girlfriend at Wolverine Market in Port Huron, MI. Pours a dense black with ruby highlights, one finger of mocha froth, and speckles of lacing on the tulip. Smell is toasty roasted malts, licorice, faint chocolate note, baking sugar, black currants, and floral hops. Taste is dark chocolate, burnt grains, espresso, table cream, spicy and resiny hops, and some cocoa powder on the cough. Mouthfeel is rich, velvety, fuller than medium, silky middle, flash of spice gives way to a chalky, parched palate. Long, bone dry finish. Overall, this is a straight forward yet satisfying stout that nails the style. I could drink a few of these in an evening."
"This is an enjoyable beer to drink and is a stout of which I could knock back a few. I really enjoy its pronounced creaminess, as well as the nutty roasted malts. This is definitely another winner from Bells."
"This beer pours a dark dark black, smell is good but not the best of any stout. Mouthfeel is impressive and you can taste a multitude of flavors in each sip. Overall not the best stout i have had but it is well above average. I really enjoy bells brews in general and this one didn't disappoint."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The pour is jet black, thinish white head, light lacing. The aroma is heavy on burnt coffee, esspresso, chocolate. The coffee and chocolate flavors meld well, it finishes with a slight burnt coffee. The body is medium, well carbonated, and I did not feel like it was exceptionally creamy. A good stout."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer Charlotte served in a standard pint glass a deep opaque black with a nice frothy khaki head that lasts and leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is some mild roasted malts and not much else. The taste is a wonderfully smooth kick of roasted malts with nice subtle cocoa that leaves a wonderful finish. The beer is quite light, crisp and smooth with nice carbonation. This is a great stout, one I've been overlooking for a few years."
"Drinkability - A one and done beer, but decent nonetheless. Not one I'd buy in the future to be honest."
"D-This is not a bad beer, but I am not disappointed this is not available to me in the PNW. My sister-in-law brought this out from Ohio when she visited for Christmas."
"Overall this is one damn good stout, all the typical stout flavors that we know and love are there but they are mixed perfectly with sweet roasted malts and a super creamy mouthfeel that really makes this beer stand out from the mainstream. Bell's broke the mold with this one and I hope they continue to blow my mind with their crazy good brews."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. The flavors are nice and balanced, but as mentioned before, don't pop out at me. It's a solid drink, but nothing I would actively seek out again."
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured pitch black with a half finger tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, and slight roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, roasted malt, and cream on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall the flavor on this one was kind of watered-down in my opinion. The aroma on this one isn't overly great either, but decent. Just seemed to be lacking in intensity in both aspects. With that said however, it is worth trying at least once. I could imagine this being mixed with Expedition and being QUITE good. Mouthfeel on this one was kind of thin as well for my taste. While this helps the drinkability of the brew, it also hurts it overall."
"D- Awesome mouthfeel and complex malts make it great!"
"Thanks to Cdkrenz for this sample in a ""secret santa"" exchange."
"Notes: I really liked this beer, it is a great stout, very complex in flavor and its relatively low ABV makes it very drinkable. I definitely recommend this beer."
"The flavor is very similar, like very soft tissue paper on my bum, it washes down my palate with a silky chocolate and coffee flavor. It finishes very dry, but extremely pleasant. Nothing too big and bold here, just a magnificently crafted stout that is as easy drinking as they come."
"Poured from the bottle oil black with an incredibly thick rocky tan head that took some time to recede and stuck to the side of the glass with lacing. Smell is semi sweet chocolate small amount of coffee and roasted grain. Taste is sweet upfront chocolate and sweet coffee that is followed with a small hop bit and roasted grain finish. Mouthfeel is full thick creamy great body to this beer. For such a full bodied beer, I could always have another. One of my winter time favorites."
"The taste, rich, yet soft, very easy drinking, not big on the roast or chocolate, it keeps a velvet like average chewiness with that dallop of cocoa powder. Not heavy on the sweetness. Doesn't leave much of an aftertaste at all, ends dry for a milk stout or whatnot. A little twang with it. This beer offers a ton of different flavor profiles all under one cap, but none of them are really in your face. One of those stouts that you can use to convert someone to stouts, but isn't overly simplified, complex and enjoyable enough for everyone."
"BIG surprise. I hadn't ever had this before and it was a really good find. Definitely on my awesome list."
"Drinkability -- Brace yourself: Bell's made another well-rounded, quality stout. Hard to believe, I know. All jokes aside, this is a damn fine American Stout: no twist, no gimmicks, just quality crafting."
"Would drink again."
"The flavor is big on the lactose. Creamy sweetness thy almost reminds me of ice cream. There is enough sweet and surly malt to balance the whole thing very nicely. Mouthfeel is fantastically smoky and creamy. Drinkable as well...doesn't feel too heavy or boozy. A dessert stout if you will.   "
"Rich and complex, a dry but creamy stout. Very nice."
"This beer pours a black color with a tan head. The aroma smells of roasted malts, sweet malt, almost like cream or milk, and a little bit of a coffee smell to it as well. The taste is smooth, creamy with a roasted malt character. The mouthfeel is medium thick, and is drinkable."
"D - An easy drinking sweet stout, Bell's has done well with this one. If you like the style (as I do) it's well worth a try."
"Overall impression: Color me confused. The bottled version was crazy sweet, but the tap version is (for the style) not sweet enough. Either this beer is an entirely different animal on tap, or it was mistakenly served under this label, and was in fact a different beer altogether (maybe Kalamazoo?). It's somewhat of a puzzle rating this serving; it's certainly enjoyable, yet fails to fully satisfy the requirements of the style."
"Awesome brew from bells, what more would you expect. I just bottled a milk stout that I think will taste very close to this but less abv and probably more carbonation."
"Looks like a pretty standard coffee stout. Very light chocolate nose over the maltiness. Surprisingly light malt for a stout, mellowed by cream flavors. Full, smooth body with a faint malt stickiness in the finish. Incredibly light and mellow flavor, very easy to drink. Definitely try it out if you can."
"This beer pours a nice deep dark brown topped with over a finger of tan foam. The smell I found to be slightly coffee and mostly malted sugar with a decent amount of vanilla. The taste is pretty decent mix of vanilla and coffee but it wasn't too bold on either. The mouthfeel was pretty good everything seemed to be in order. There was nothing outstanding or spectacular about this beer, but it was pretty solid and enjoyable."
"Overall, I have never been a huge fan of this style, but I could see myself drinking some more of these."
"WIll revisit."
"Taste: Warm, cola-like sweetness up front, followed by a buttery mouthfeel and a drier-than-anticipated finish. The creaminess here is more in the body and mouthfeel, and only one of many aspects of the taste. There are some low, dark fruit notes in the background of this one, and the dry finish has a grainy, coffee-like feel. I'm not sure all the elements here add up as ideally as desired, for me, though at least it's interesting. The cola-feel contrasts a little strangely with the buttery cream notes, and the fruit notes a little strangely against the coffee finish. It's a decent enough sipper, not one I'd turn away by any means; but it's not an absolute home run either. Unlike the Bros., I noticed zero lacing and poor head retention in my glass."
"The feel of the beer is medium bodied and is smooth going down but has a fierce character that can jump out at you at any time."
"Damn good stuff. I dont know why I dont get this stuff more often."
"Fine to sip on a cold night, but not overly rememberable."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A solid stout from a solid brewery. There's no WOW factor with this beer though. It's good, but not outstanding. It's pretty easy drinking as far as stouts go."
"Poured almost opaque black with one finger tan head. Nose of a good stout: malty, chocolatey, coffee. Taste is medium carbonation and sweet malt start, coffeelike bitterness at the back, bittersweet chocolate and smoke in the aftertaste. Leans toward the taste of an imperial stout. Medium heavy mouthfeel. Decent drinkability."
"Drinks easily, and while not cravable, certainly a solid beer."
"Mouth feel as you would expect is very creamy. This is a very nice beer. Drinkability is held back slightly due to sweetness."
"Verdict: Great, well-made stout that makes up for its ubiquitous nature by being damn excellent and tasty."
"Drink well my friends"
"Absolutely opaque black in color. A simple dark tan head holds for several minutes and then drops to a thin surface covering and very nice collar. The aroma reveals licorice, sweet milk chocolate, creamy coffee, mild buttery biscuit, and a touch of raisin. Roasty. An interesting fruity tasty up front becoming quickly mildly sweet and creamy like a rich sour cream. The bitterness deepens as the beer warms and breathes on the palate. There is a touch of alcohol but it burns off quickly leaving a dry finish that's loaded with lingering bitterness, dry coffee-like roastiness, and a light touch of mildy tart dark fruitiness. The body is medium. The texture is softly fluffy as the beer seems to expand on the palate. Oily on the finish. Drinkability is high, because this beer invites you back with the promise of another intriguing sip. One of the best I've had. A very nice stout."
"Drinkability: I really liked this beer not a heap of complexity great mouthfeel, a seasonable cream stout to say the least. My first bells offering and certainly not the last."
"A very nice beer to sip on and savor. The thickness makes it kinda of weird to down one after another."
"D - I am sure I could drink a few of these, just maybe not all in one sitting. A very nice cask offering from Bell's."
"I'd love to say I'm more impressed, but I suppose I'm not. Just seems like another run of the mill stout to me. Not really sweet at all per style, and kind of thin."
"Nice beer."
"D. Very easy drinking. Milk stout is my preferred type of stout next to Imperial. This is really well balanced and easy to put down. I like the chocolate flavors in this."
"D- Highly drinkable stout that could be easily sessionable."
"Overall: A tasty beer. It is a tad overcarbonated, but the flavours are strong and rich. It doesn't hold a candle to Moloko Plus, but it is still an exceptional brew from Bell's."
"This pours black with a nice one finger off-white head that fades with good lacing. On the nose the main note is caramel with some chocolate and raw sugar in the back. On the tongue it's the same idea as the nose, and towards the back there is a good deal of sweetness. In the mouth it's not especially thick but there is the cloying quality that often comes with these sweeter beers. It's plenty drinkable as long as sweet stouts don't turn you off."
"Overall: Overall the beer was very nice. I'm a big fan of the sweet stouts, so I wasnt disappointed when I tried this one. The flavor is complex and goes through phases of sweetness and finishes with a nice bitter flavor. Well done, I'd recommend this to all beer drinkers."
"D- A light body with good taste make this a pretty good choice if I wanted something creamy and roasty. I could definitely knock a couple of these back but would probably pick another stout if it was available. However this would be wonderful with/as dessert so my percentage of ordering it would increase exponentially after a meal."
"Pours a pitch black color with a thick creamy unforgiving tan head with tons of residual lacing. Smells of coffee, and some chocolate and maybe roasted malts. Tastes of tons of coffee with tasty sweetness and roasted malts. Hops round out the flavor and cut some of the sweetness. You can taste some chocolate in there as well. Nice thick and full bodied mouthfeel. Drinkability is really good."
"Overall: Good beer overall. Not my favorite stout but it's worth a try."
"D - I could drink these all night. Tastes great and goes down smooth."
"Exceptional cream stout, well done."
"I'm a fan of sweet stouts, and this is a very good one. I'll certainly get it again."
"I have sampled this many times over the last five or six years,had on tap today the Mellow Mushroom.Poured into a standard pint glass jet black with a creamy one finger mocha colored head,it just looked rich from the tap.Bitter chocolate and cookie dough aromas really stood out with a bit of char thrown in there as well.Flavors are highly roasted and coffee-like upfront with some char again as well,some cookie and molasses sweetness comes in late in a nice finish.A well rounded solid stout,it wont blow you away but its got a nice balanced flavor profile."
"Not bad. This one is a decent stout. I think the cream could come through a little more, but for what it is, this one isn't shabby at all. If they could fix the roast on the finish, I think this one would be a go to for me."
"D: Another solid stout from Bell's, especially for those with a sweet tooth. Would go best with dessert."
"D: If milk stouts are your thing, this is one of the better ones. I still hold FFF ""Moloko"" up on a pedestal in this regard because of its complex ""cinnamon-like"" quality, but this is still a very worthy entry into this fantastic style."
"Pours black with a hint of brown at the edges. The head is a medium brown color and sticks around through most of this beer. Aroma is of dark roated grains, coffee, and a hint of vanilla. The taste is very enjoyable. This is one complex but well integrated beer. It is not sweet at all for a milk stout, but has a creamy mouthfeel that is common for the style. Overall I would say the taste is pretty dry. Flavor of dark roasted grains and coffee. Some slight chocolate and vanilla notes are present. There is also a slightly hoppy note at the end of the sip. Mouthfeel is fairly heavy and appropriate for the style. Bells really knows how to do stouts well and this is another great example."
"Pours a dark dark brown color, with 1 finger of creamy tan head, leaving some slight lacing. Not a whole lot in the smell, some hints of chocolate and roasted malts is about it. The taste is similar to the smell, but there is also some tartness to this stout - maybe some dark fruits? Not exactly what I was expecting, just cant get over the tartness of this sweet stout. This is my 2nd time giving this Bell's offering a chance, and I don't think I would seek it out again unfortunately (definitely prefer their other stouts)"
"Overall - Well balanced, enjoyable sweet stout."
"I am editing my rating on this beer. I still love the flavor of this beer, but I recently purchace a six pack of this beer and found that after a couple of beers that the sweetness of this beer was a little overwhelming. Changing my drinkability from 5 to 4"
"D - The bitter and sweet balance make this a drinkability winner."
"Received as an extra in a recent trade. Pours a jet black color, shot through with ruby highlights, and capped off with a medium brown head. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, vanilla and heavy cream. Flavors of bitter, burnt coffee, dark chocolate and milk. Creamy and full bodied, but not for me."
"Was expecting a little bit more mingling of flavors, but overall a good beer indeed."
"Serving: In bottle. I poured into chilled pint glass. I should have made it colder before drinking...."
"Drinkability: No question this one is double cream-tastic and goes down easy. Three bottles were harmed in the writing of this review."
"D: I think the ABV being lower than some of the big stouts helps it's sustained drinkability. Separate from that, it's not quite what I've come to expect from a cream stout - lacks an overall, uh, creaminess."
"D: I wish I could have one of these every day. Very delicious. We have a hver hot fall season, and this is the perfect stout to make the transistion to the heavier beers."
"D_Good winter session beer."
"Notes: after tasting, enjoyed this with strawberries and dark chocolate truffles for dessert. Perfect pairing in my opinion."
"This is about as tasty as it gets for the style."
"The beer pours a midnight black color with a monstrous light chocolate head that creamy in its consistency and the left over lace a fine satiny sheet to meld with the glass. Rich chocolate malt sweet nose, coffee, roasted grain and just a treasure to sniff, front is ambrosial, full and rich as is the full bodied top. Finish is bittersweet, mildly acidic, bone dry and a real pleasing beer."
"Notes: A nice Sweet Stout with a nice mix of flavors. Just a hint of bitterness keeps the sweetness in check. A little on the thin side, and I probably wouldn't want to drink a number of these in a night, but it was definitely a nice treat."
"D - Quite drinkable, I could easily have 2-3 of these in a sitting. I really love this beer, definitely my favorite milk stout. Oh, and the label is cool, too!"
"This stout is deliciously simple, I really could drink it all night. It is creamy and a touch of sweet balanced by a touch of roast and bitterness."
"Drinks: like confusion. Not creamy enough and a little too tangy, Double Cream Stout isn't one I'll be seeking out again."
"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours black with some brown highlights, and a super creamy, off-white head with excellent lacing. Smells nutty and lightly roasty with some creaminess. Tastes delicious. Creamy and slightly sweet with a fresh cream, citrus hop, and a light roasty flavor and some toasted hazlenut and almonds. Creamy and with some sweetness in the mouth. A very nice beer."
"D - This is one easy-drinking ""double cream"" stout. Full bodied, creamy and rich, yet finishes clean and without a heavy lingering aftertaste."
"M: Very nice smooth finish but bitter taste was a bit overwhelming. The creamy texture is probably the best part of this beer."
"Edit: Tried a bottle of Batch 10151 (aka 01/25/11) on 8/27/11 and there's no acidity at all. Just smooth and creamy. Score for taste and mouthfeel reflect this bottle."
"D: Overall way more bitter than I had hoped. I had high hopes for this one, I need to stop having pre concieved notions about the beers I drink."
"D - If I could find this often, I'd be drinking it often. A good stout that everyone should try. This is my favorite milk/cream stout."
"M - Medium/Heavy body. This feels like milk in your mouth and beckons me to eat it with ice cream. A bowl of vanilla and a pint of this make a great pair. I really enjoy one of these, but I can't see myself drinking more than 1 in a night. Its just a little too sweet for me."
"D - Extremely drinkable. This definitely wouldn't be a session beer, but there's so much going on with it that you just have to constantly go back for more to see what the next sip will bring."
"Welcome to the embodification ( is that even a word? ) of Two-Face. This dark and edgy beer seems to have a dual nature in many ways. The finish is both clean and dirty. The flavors are both bitter and sweet. The nose mirrors its flavors as both bitter and sweet. It is not like these two are one and the same either. It is not bittersweet, but two unique personas. I would drink this beer every night of the week. It has so little of an alcohol punch that I couldn't even note it anywhere minus the very beginning. I loved it."
"bells cream stout poured black with a small tan head. it smelt sweet with choclate. it tasted very sweet and a bit harsh on the palette. it had strong flavors and wasnt the easist to drink. overall different and not bad but not the best. iam sure i would get this one again bells other stouts are much better"
"Pours a deep dark rich black color with a huge huge foamy head that almost went over the glass. Smell is really bitter dark chocolate, sour cherries and a hint of cocoa powder. Taste is way off. i think its infected. really has a bitter, tart, sour cherry flavor goign on. has nothing like a cream stout should have going on. Really this might be infected otherwise its just not good. Mouthfeel is decent, a bit over carbonated for my liking on a stout. Drinkability is average despite the sourness in this beer. I will have to get another sample just to verify if this is what the beer is really like."
"D - The acidity and oxidation make this undrinkable."
"Beer is medium body, the roast is in the aftertaste only. The forward is moderately thin in flavor with some sweetness followed by the burned sugar taste. Its a little tangy too. Interesting, but I'm not super impressed. It tastes fine but I've had better stouts."
"O: Buy again? Definitely. Recommend? Highly. Search out? Yes. Worth the price? For the alcohol and strength of flavor, yes (something like a dollar fifty a bottle)."
"Drinkability: I could drink a lot of these considering the great balance. Another great beer from Bell's, but this falls short of what I have come to expect from a cream stout."
"Black with barely noticeable brown tint. Dense medium sized head. Smells soothingly roasty with light espresso and chocolate. A big and creamy mouthfeel. The beer tastes buttery, smooth, with just the right amount of lactic sweetness balanced by roasted dryness and bitter chocolate, very low hop. The beer is tremendously satisfying, well balanced, and gives me a nourished feeling every time. One of my favorite winter beers."
"Drinkability: This beer isn't necessarily bad, it just lacks a balance between sweetness and roastiness. I will definitely enjoy the sixer I bought and have no problem grabbing one of these if it's available or at a party. However I think I'll stick with the cream stout when looking for a sweet creamy alternative to the big stouts."
"D: Pretty drinkable for the most part."
"D - A below average beer. Disappointing."
"Didn't expect vinegar. I'm pretty disappointed because I was looking forward to this one, and I can't get it in my hometown. Oh well."
"D - Not bad. It's a lighter stout. Definitely different prominent tastes in this stout, not really what I go for."
"D - For being a sweet stout I really enjoyed this one...it was a lot better than their Expedition Stout...the cream never became overly sweet and the malts really lasted throughout...another solid beer from Bell's"
"A nicely drinkable stout, although more suited for colder weather perhaps. If it ever makes it to Tucson I will probably pick up a sixer come winter time..."
"Notes - Good mouthfeel"
"Comments: I am a big fan of Bell's Brewery, and I also really enjoy the milk stout style. Accordingly, it is no surprise that this beer impresses me. As my review indicates, balance is key with this one."
"D: This seems pretty solid, but I'm not well-versed in the milk stout style, so I can't judge it all that well. Certainly I'd revisit this one."
"This beer is one of my favorites. I am from Kalamazoo and this beer has never disappointed. It has a big, creamy, amber-colored head and an even creamier mouthfeel. In fact, I would say that this is the creamiest mouthfeel I have ever had in a beer. It pours very dark brown going in and looks nearly black in the stout glass. It has a complex taste that finishes just a little bit tart with a definite black patent aftertaste. This bottle has the code 9446 on the back. The label has changed from red lettering to tan lettering outlined in black."
"D- very drinkable. The alcohol, which at 6% is high for a non-imperial stout, is not noticeable at all. It tastes like...well, it tastes like that awesomeness you get from a good stout. Its like Guinness, but with a lot more flavor."
"D-I thought this beer was good, but not great. Definitely worth getting again, though, as I think it's the type that grows on you, IMO."
"D: A rare miss by Bell's. With a 6.1% ABV, I'm not sure cellaring would have made any improvements, but I can't help but wonder if I drank this one a little too early."
"Acquired from a PA Store."
"Nice dark black pour, tan/mocha 1 cm head, good retention. Smells like sour milk, coffee, and chocolate. Initially tastes like sour milk. Then I am getting some hop bitterness followed by roasted malts. Tastes mostly like coffee. Has a slick mouthfeel. I might be wrong but I thought this was supposed to sweet?"
"D: A great start but the richness of the malts makes it difficult to drink this for too long. All in all, though, this is a nice offering from Bell's"
"This one really sounded like it would be good. I guess you can't judge a book by it's cover... or, hundreds of good reviews. I don't think there was anything wrong with the beer in the way of spoilage or oxidation, but I don't understand where some people are coming from in their reviews. If I ever come across it again I will have to try it and see."
"no bitterness to note, maltiness is way up front. i should note that the longer this one lived in the glass and the closer it came to room temp, the more enjoyable it became."
"I thought this was smoother and maybe a little more full-bodied on draft. Still, enjoyable and one of the better milk stouts regularly available out there."
"D: As I've said, the taste on this improves the more you drink, which is a great inducement to drink even more."
"Overall, this is an enjoyable beer, but it doesn't knock my socks off. It's definitely worth trying, but there are other milk stouts which I'd rather drink for the $ (Lake Louie & Left Hand come to mind). That's not to say that I wouldn't love to try Black Note...I can see this pairing nicely with the Expedition Stout and bourbon barrel aging would certainly add a lot."
"Obviously it didn't meet my expectations but it was still a good beer. I probably wouldn't spend a night drinking these.."
"Drinkability: If you like the style it fits though maybe at a more intense level and you could have a couple of these easily enough at 6.1% ABV. It seems like something that I would like given it's a stout and sweet but 1 is definitely enough for me. What I liked least was the peculiar tangy sourness in the middle."
"D - This is not very good to me. I am pretty sure this is a fresh bottle given the batch number, but this is like carbonated slightly sour milks with coffee and carbonation. I think I will pass on this in the future."
"D : It's a one glass drink for me. Makes for a good dessert brew, but doesn't draw me in."
"D: A really solid example of the style. Recommended."
"Very drinkable stout. Not too complex and very smooth. Nice touch in not killing it with a high ABV. Great ballance on this one."
"Again, if it wasn't for the metallis bite this one would be a bit better. Still, it's very drinkable and I will definitely buy it again."
"D: Great balance of sweet and smokey with a smooth body. It's an easy drinker, full of flavor without being too big at all. The sweet comes from both the fruit and the milk, balancing the acidity on that end as well. Really pleasant."
"Overall Impression: This is a very mellow sweet stout. I really liked the chocolate finish. It was better previously at the POPE on cask, but that goes without saying. I never actually smelled milk in a beer before, and I've had many Milk/Sweet Stouts over the years. Regardless, I still liked it. This beer really did not come to life until it warmed up, more so than most other fine ales"
"Overall, this is a very interesting brew. Big roasty malts, a smooth body and tangy milkiness. I like sour beers, but I'm not sure if this pairing is really my thing. I think Bell's has done a good job with the style and if I had a fresher bottle maybe I wouldn't notice the lactic sourness as much. All in all though, this is still a tasty beer and one that I'd like to try again."
"Overall it's interesting. I don't know if so much milk is my thing, but I'm glad I tried it."
"I must have had my first bottle of Double Cream Stout a little too cold, but served at cellar temps, this beer is extremely well-done. A wonderful aroma and flavorful taste make this one of the best stouts I've had in a while."
"D - Good stuff, but not as mind boggling as some other Bell's brews (Two Hearted anyone?). I tried this at the good beer spot in town, and it may have been a little to chilled. I'd like to savor this in a snifter at room temp at home and give it another go."
"D - Exceptional. A very well made beer. 5.0"
"D - This is a very odd beer. The aroma is quite subdued, but the flavor is robust (just not in a good way). This may be because the primary flavor component is sticky, cloying sweetness. This excessive sweetness is accompanied by an odd, cola like note of artificial caramel flavoring and some strange sourness. The only thing I can find to like about it is the pleasant, dark roasted coffee note that is always lingering in the background. I really didn't care for this beer, it is strange, one dimensional, and overly sweet and I definitely won't be drinking it again."
"D - This is a pretty solid beer, I couldn't see myself drinking it real fast or drinking too many of these at once but it is working pretty good as my desert beer of the night. Would definitely pick this one up again"
"Overall a good brew. This was my first milk stout and I'm looking forward to trying another."
"Overall this i a very nice stout that tastes as the label states."
"The sweetness makes it very drinkable. Double Cream is not too strong and quite easy to drink. Its been a while since I have had a Double Cream Stout."
"pours a very dark brown with a one finger light tan head. smells strong and robust. very tart yogurt like aromas. the taste is very tart and sour, but i like it. mouthfeel isn't very stouty, but you can actually taste some cream like qualities. very interesting."
"D- Not something to daisy chain together, for sure, but too good not to finish. This is somewhere between a sipper and a dessert beer."
"Terrific."
"Exceedingly easy drink and goes down very fast."
"D - maybe i just dont enjoy this style very much, but this one just doesnt hold up very well for me. the flavors are there but fall off very quickly, succumbing to an unappealing mouthfeel. i was contemplating pouring this for a bit before i decided to suck it up...not an awful beer, just not for me."
"J"
"M/D-a little on the thin side for a stout of this ABV for me, would have liked to have seen a little more here. very drinkable though, i would love to be able to get my hands on this in CT."
"D – This is a very good offering from Bell’s. It’s a shame I so seldom see it, I would drink it more often."
"3.5/4/4/4/4"
"Serving type: on-tap"
"Drinkability: Goes down smooth but sits a bit heavy. I wouldn't want to have more than two bottles."
"Pours a dark chocolaty color with littlel head and minimal lacing. It has a great smell of roasted malts and chocolate. Chocolatey smell that surpasses the taste and drinkability. There is a decent amount of CO2 for a stout, but it does not really stand out as a stout that separates itself from the rest."
"D-very drinkable a perfect balance of bitter like coffee and chocolate notes and the sweetness of lactose a very nice balanced sweet stout that can definately be enjoyed throughout the night"
"drinkability: a solid stout and i would drink again. Seemed sessionable and not too ""Double"" as stated on the label. Very much just like anormal milk stout, very good though"
"I would probably try this again, but stouts are not really my thing. For what it was though, I thought it was a good beer and something I'd recommend to anyone into that style."
"Overall, a decent stout. Carbonation plays in well with the flavors, and helps to balance things out on the palate. A good example of a finely crafted cream stout."
"Another winner from Bell's. Why is this available in Florida but not Colorado?"
"I looked forward to finally trying this one. It wasn't quite as good as I hoped, but it certainly is another respectable offering from Bells."
"Great texture to the beer, creamy and not too heavy. The flavors are exactly what I like in a Milk stout with emphasis on the creaminess and overall sweet character. Just an awesome milk stout, IMO."
"The aroma > flavor in this one for me. If it tasted like it smelled, it would be an easy 4+. As it is, I prefer Bells Kalamazoo stout, which is also cheaper than this Double Cream stout."
"Odd duck. Seems to vary a little in its characteristics. This time, I don't think I'm imagining it and don't know how it could be possible - but it seems to me like the ""cream"" qualities, i.e. the lactose, is spoiled. I pick up some sour milk aroma and flavor. Other than that part the flavor is spot on and ditto aroma. Body is creamy and is, for me, one of my favorite kinds of beer: milk/cream stout. So easy drinking. Don't pick up any alcohol in this at all, so it's a sneaky one. Carbonation is perfect. Head is tan, fine and medium size. Nice lace. I'd give it much better rating except for the sour thing. And, admittadly my sensory apparatus is defective, soooo... I leave it there."
"The brew looked great in the glass. The smell was great. Very full and it draws you in. The flavor is a bit odd. The first mouthful I actually did not like. It was a little like an odd cheese. But after that I really liked it. I wished that I had more than one bottle. I do think that I could drink this for a full evening."
"Drinkability: I have been seeking out rare one ofs much less lately and just grabbing a six pack here and there. it is nice to relax and have some solid, well produced craft beer without breaking the bank or feeling the need to review. Definitely a hit."
"Some hoppy bitterness in flavors and finish. All around pretty average."
"Pours a very dark brown to near black that allows some light to pass. Head is light tan, and the nose has a caramel-cream sweet aroma to it. Roasty flavors are noted up front on the palate as it moves towards some general malt sweetness, some traits from the milk components, and a sweet to somewhat tart finish."
"D - Very easy to drink; it's quite tasty. Definitely worth a shot. I'd love to run across this on draft."
"Pleasant, easy to drink stout with a good full mouthfeel. Nice beer!"
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Black with some brown/red highlights. The head is a wet-sandy color and manages to stick around for a while. Nice roasted malt aroma with a delicate vanilla sweetness. Roasted coffee flavors that's countered by a nice, creamy vanilla flavor. The sweetness is more restrained than some other milk stouts I've had but still very nice. Perhaps more of a compromise for those who don't like super-dry or super-sweet. This one lands squarely in the middle. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but there's still a pleasant carbonated quality that lifts the sweetness of the palate. There may be better milk stouts out there, but this one is pretty drinkable and has great balance to it."
"overall another impressive brew from bells..and another solid bottle from ottovon..."
"O: The perfect pint of Guinness happens to be Bell's Special Double Cream Stout. Drink this one as fresh as possible as this one is already smooth and it's flavors are already on their way out."
"Drinkability? Not a scary abv here to contend with so I say, drink away, as I'm doing. Very easy drinker."
"A 16 ounce draft. Good foamy head mocha in color. Little lacing. Looks black in color with the carbonation making very pretty lines on the glass. Deep mocha smell. The heavy but smooth creamy mouthfeel I was hoping for. Strong malts with a bitter sweet end. Nice aftertaste."
"Overall this is a very drinkable stout, I had 4 of them before I knew it and had to slow down a bit. Could easily have finished off the sixer."
"D- Definitely drinkable. The creaminess of it makes it worth drinking. For sure a recommendation to any fan of stouts."
"D: Just a trial beer for me, I wouldn't get this in a sixer or anything."
"For not being an Imperial Stout, this one holds its own surprisingly well. A nice winter warmer indeed."
"d - Overall I thought it was a pretty good milk stout. At first it tasted strong of coffee to me, but I definitely thought it improved as I drank it and began to taste the cream flavor. I would definitely try this again."
"Dark black color with a 2 finger tan head with large bubbles and decent retention. Smells of dark roasted coffee and sweet malt. The taste is the same. The bitter coffee and the sweet malt balance each other out. there is also some vanilla flavor present. Medium bodied, low carbonation, and has a sweet sticky aftertaste. A nice drinkable beer which I would buy again."
"D: I'm a bit conflicted on this one. I love sweeter, lactic stouts and this definitely fits the bill. The bittersweet aftertaste (tasty as it is) seems a bit oafish, and slightly overstays its welcome. I'd say this beer may be a victim of its own hype. I routinely see this selling for ~$15/sixer; I expected something excellent, but this falls just short of that."
"D: An easy to drink version of a milk stout."
"Very mild flavor, but very sticky and for no reason. The flavor is muted, but still very decent."
"A solid example of the style - one not readily brewed right now on the West coast."
"D: Certainly drinkable--two or three in a row is not out of my range. Light enough to drink three, with enough taste and texture to keep your 'buds entertained."
"enjoyed this one with strawberries and a 70% coco chocolate bar the beer was simply perfect and with these, could have drank all six but ate up all my strawberries and chocolate so decided to save the rest. talk about harmony with food wow! wine cant hang with this combo."
"Pours dark brown to black with a khaki head. The aroma is awesome, smells like a mochaccino along with some roasted malt. The flavor is very creamy with coffee and roasted malts. The aftertaste is dominated by the coffee and you get some good bitterness from that. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Low carbonation."
"Drinkability: Bells is the king of stouts and this is another winner. Wish I bought two sixpacks and wish this was here. Love the combo of toasted and burnt malts. An excellent milk stout to rival left hand."
"ABV is low enough to have a few, but the syrupy richness and the in-your-face chocolate cake flavor may make this a one and done affair."
"Doble cream is a very very dark brown that might as well be called black, it practically is. A nice semi full off white vanilla head stayed a float but did not manage to leave any lace. Smell up front is dark malt and chocolate, warming up some of vanilla creeps in with toasted nuts, further warming reveals coffee beans. The taste is pretty much in the same order. A bit of caramel malt sweetness but the cream seems to be lacking. A lot of coffee with warming that i was not expecting. I dont see why they call this a double. The feel is a bumpy ride and a bit rugged. Not as easy going down as other's in the style, perhaps this would be best off a nitro, hopefully one day i'll find it. Bell's needs to take double out of the name or add double the amount of cream next batch."
"But all is not lost with this specialty Bells stout. Malts are super toasty and dark, practically begging to be followed with a fat chunk of chocolate or maybe a chocolate covered espresso bean. And hey, with such a beautiful malty finish, I think the puny sweetness is a blessing in disguise."
"Pours a deep brown almost black color with a fairly thin tan head that sits that settles atop. You can smell the creamy milk characteristics of this beer. Very refreshing smell with some hints of roasted coffee beans. Taste is similar to the nose with some added taste of coffee and the milk/cream really dominate the quaff. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy while refreshing. Very solid milk stout. Alcohol is masked really well by the complexity and sweetness of the taste. Very sessionable in my opinion."
"Drinkability: I give it a 4 -- very nice flavors that are robust; solid mouthfeel and smell and a moderate ABV, would be very nice for a cool night."
"Poured into a pint glass, black with a 1 finger mocha head that dissolved fairly quickly, leaving a thin lacing. Smelled of chocolate and roasted barley. The taste followed the nose, and it was a real pleasure to drink. Chocolate and roasted barley with a hint of mocha and a hops aftertaste that was far from overpowering but balanced the beer just fine. Moderate carbonation. This is about as drinkable of a beer as I've had, I would be more than happy having a few more."
"It was creamy and silky as it should be with a very low astringency. Very drinkable and overall a good example of the style that isn't over the top creamy and cloying."
"Big, aggressive head of dark tan, lots of dense foam yet offers a host of large bubbles as well, excellent retention and strong lacing as well. Onyx black in color, actually black is not a color so more or less colorless. The nose has a dryness to it which controls the sweeter qualities of the dark chocolate, cocoa, licorice accents, the cherry, plum scents show good contour, some scone or flaky dough notes, nothing overtly hoppy but one assumes they contribute to the dryness. Full-bodied, the creamy texture relieves much of the weight as well as a good bit of bitterness. Still, the dark chocolate, coffee bean, cocoa powder has some bitterness. Licorice, orange peel, tea leaves, nuts drift in and out. Lower level of cherry, apricot, apple fruit, subtle. The carbonation is itself smooth but has a relentless power to it, adds to a sense of movement. Very consistent, balanced presentation."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, though not as big and bold as I was expecting. Looks good and feels good, with a nice combination of flavors that make for an easy sipping stout."
"F: Finishes semi bitter, but not from hops, just a good old fashion bitter earthy starched charred malts. After chewing on it for a while, it goes down the hatch not so easily. It leaves a few layers on the mouth when its gone, leaving the chocolate, roast, and malty flavors to dwell on. Some light syrupy flavors, almost molasses. It's not really dry, but not really sweet either on the finish. Pretty neutral and surprisingly drinkable for the weight."
"D- exelent, can go for many of this gems !"
"D: Great for a milk stout (not really a session style, IMHO)."
"Mouthfeel is thin and clean and light. Drinkable, tasty beer."
"Poured into a DFH snifter, opaque black as with most stouts, very little head and lacing. It has a very pleasant aroma of toffee, caramel, roasted malts, and coffee. It is very light and creamy in the mouth, with the coffee and roasted malts flavors coming to the forefront. It goes down really smooth, with a slight aftertaste of the chocolate. This is the first time I've had this and it is definitely a brew that I will seek out when it comes around again. A great stout to start out the evening, very drinkable and not too overpowering."
"Overall I expected sort of a milk stout but got more of a peppery magic hat ""Howl"" with a smoother body. Would buy again."
"A nice brew, but nothing too interesting. Duck Rabbit remains my favorite milk stout."
"M/D: As stated before, creamy and smooth, especially towards the back of the palate. The consistency is light to medium, with a bit of carbonation (despite the completely flat pour) to add texture. Easy to drink and enjoyable, but this beer is just too sweet for me to drink more than one of...it's a good ""every once in a while"" beer, but not a go-to"
"D - Drinks well."
"Nicely drinkable and unassuming for a stout. One to enjoy on a Sunday afternoon."
"Next review!"
"Jet black, admits no light. medium tan head, disappears quickly, leaves nice lacing. Aroma of cafe au lait with burnt edges. Taste begins with chocolate, then progresses to roasted coffee beans, then finally to burnt espresso. Very nice indeed. Laid down 6 bottles tonight, hopefully I can wait a year."
"Not as heavy as you would think. OK, so it's not a traditional milk stout due to the roast and lack of super sweet lactose in the flavor, but this is a DAMN good and it's towards the top of the ABV range, so I'm sure the roast is necessary to avoid this tasting too hot. A great offering from Bells."
"All in all, this is a good brew if you're looking for something sweeter out of a stout."
"Very smooth on the palate, showing the roasted malt up front but not exactly showcasing it. Turns toward burnt caramel and bitter chocolate in the middle, before rounding out and fading into a long, smooth finish. Mouthfeel is, again, smooth, but lacks the body for me to consider it exactly ""creamy."" Very quaffable, and were it not for the alcohol content would be a great session beer. Indeed, if it were up to me I'd leave a few more fermentable sugars in this brew, thickening the mouthfeel while dropping the ABV. A very good beer, regardless."
"D: This is also distinguishable from your typical milk stout by the fact that it lacks the drinkability the finest examples of the style possess. It's more of a sipper than a gulper. Another enjoyable beer by Bell's, though."
"Side Thoughts- The 2009 batch is better then the 2008 imo. This year's batch is sweeter and is not suffering from that metallic after taste. This is a decent brew, but I find the $15.99 price tag on a sixer to be way too high for the product."
"D: The Milk/Sweet stout is a style that's beginning to grow on me. Generally I am more of an RIS fan, but the sweetness is quite a welcomed change of pace. A great beer, and I'm glad I have another."
"D-this is a solid tasting beer with a great mouthfeel and robust creamy flavors. I could drink this beer quite frequently."
"Not bad. Could have been better, could have been worse."
"Drinkability is good, this is a nice drinking stout that I can have a few of in a sitting."
"A nice beer from Bells here. Good balance and though its a bit strong its still quite good."
"*Special mention must be made about the label. Its stark image of a dark, skinny tree amidst a snowy white background looks like an Agalloch album cover.*"
"D- Honestly, I really like this beer, but I find I have a hard time drinking it as a session beer. I find it to be a really filling beer. Two of these is pretty much the limit for me."
"The taste follows suit, with coffee becoming dominant. The malt balance is awesome; The sweetness and roasty bitterness compliment each other well, with the sweetness in front. Solid hop presence merges with the slight malt bitterness on the finish. The creamy, silky mouthfeel and great balance contribute to the high drinkability score."
"Overall a great milk stout, a style which I am not normally a fan of. I really enjoyed the hell out of this beer, luckily I have one more bottle to enjoy."
"Pours black with a one finger high cappucino colored head. Surprisingly bright fruity smell, I almost get strawberries along with a dry roasted coffee and a bit of vanilla. Definitely not the whiff of lactose sweetness I expected. Tastes of roasted barley and coffee with a nice accompanying malt sweetness that hits me with coconut and prunes. Finish is roasty to a spicy degree with a rich cookie dough ending with a hint of flora. Great blend of roast and sweet malts with dark fruits and coconuts. Medium to full body with a silky, almost chewy presence. Medium carbonation. Really far above average when it comes to sweet stouts. A treat. Damn you Bell's for making one of the better milk stouts I have had and I can't even think about buying your beers in California. Most of the style end up too sweet or too roasty, but this is just right."
"I would definitely go for this beer again. Another great stout by the fine folks at Bell's."
"Church Key/$6/16 oz"
"D= Great. This is one delicious sweet stout that doesn't push the sweetness too much and is quite balance when it comes to sweetness and roast in the taste. Improvements could be the head and the mouthfeel but you can't have everything sometimes. I'll be coming back to this one again. Bell's comes through."
"Really well made year after year. This was my original go to breakfast stout and for that I give it props."
"Poured from a bottle into an imperial pint glass. Very nice tan head that faded fairly quickly to a fine tan lacing round the glass. Pours coffee black. Smells sweet and a hint of roasted malts and coffee. This beer is definitely a well balanced treat. This beer is thick and creamy. Definitely one of the creamier stouts that I have had. It starts off sweet with a very nice roasted finish. If you enjoy stouts, this is a must try."
"Drinkable beer, the sweetness really changes the moutfeel of the beer. Good stuff"
"smooth mouthfeel, great drinkability.really into this beer."
"Drinkability: This beer was rather drinkable, especially due to the finish. The carbonation was not too much to affect the drinkability. There was a certain smoothness that was nice, and the nice light, even though not crisp finish, was rather enjoyable. I liked the big flavor for the smaller abv, I just wish it was a bit cheaper (as I do with quite a few of bell's beers)."
"Pours clear brown with slight red highlights and a clingy, creamy, tan head. The scent of sweet chocolate is subtle on the nose and is echoed in the flavor. Behind the taste of the chocolate there is a background coffee flavor. The body is mild with low levels of carbonation. A semi-tart flavor throughout remains to the finish which fades slow through a subtle yet robust coffee malt flavor. As the flavor fades slowly, it leaves only a hint of alcohol."
"Drinkability: This is a very good beer. My only real complaint is that it is a little filling for me. I could certainly get this again, but could only have one or two in a sitting."
"Highly enjoyable."
"D: This is very rich and complex or a cream stout. Definitely has more character than say Left Hand Milk Stout or FFF Moloko. There is a lot of caramel and toffee aspects which are quite nice. The drinkability is good, but takes a hit due to its intense richness."
"Drinkability: It was very easy to drink. The flavor is mild, and the low carbonation makes it easier to drink quickly. I wasn't getting the complexity a lot of people got out of this one. I think this is one of those beers where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts - not my favorite beer, but solid in its own right."
"Pours thick, with bubbles taking some time to push their way to the top but eventually forming a nice finger tall, tan head that eases its way back to a ring with a few chunky islands of head floating in the middle. Opaque black. Smells good but its very subtle. Admittedly the beer is a little cooler than it ought to be so this may be part of the problem. Taste initially suffers for the same reason, but as it warms up the flavor profile expands nicely. Nice roasted flavors that meld with a slight sweetness reminds me of burnt marshmallow. The mouthfeel is velvety and thick. Overall this is a really nice ""sweet"" stout. I put the sweet in quotations because it definitely does not play this side up as much as some of its peers. Its a stout first with just enough sweetness to balance out the bitterness nicely, leaving a very full character taste. I would definitely buy this beer again."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a thick 2 finger head of tanned foam. Nose is hoppy upfront with the burnt grains filling out the middle an the finish is sweet and chocolate-like. Leaves quite a bit of lacing on the glass. Taste is bitter with a mix of both hops an burnt grain. Bitter chocolate fills the mouth with a very pleasant taste that lingers. Medium feel. Very well balanced with the hops and bitterness keeping the chocolate in check."
"D - According to the bottle, Bell's Special Double Cream is ""brewed with a blend of 10 different malts."" To me, it felt like the brewery was trying to do too much with this beer, and a little restraint would go a long way. It wasn't altogether unenjoyable, but this isn't one that I'd go out of my way to get."
"D: Very highly drinkable. Body is great for its style though it's not as malty as I expected. Kind of like Mackeson XXX stout but not as sweet with a more robust body. Definitely recommended."
"CHEERS!!"
"D - Double Cream is a good stout overall, and I found it to be a bit more bitter than I was anticipating. Tasty, but not overly complex, as I tend to like my stouts."
"Drinkability: It was very easy to drink. The flavor is mild, and the low carbonation makes it easier to drink quickly. I wasn't getting the complexity a lot of people got out of this one. I think this is one of those beers where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts - not my favorite beer, but solid in its own right."
"the combination of dessert-like qualities actually cuts down all-night drinkability however."
"Drinkability: Fantastic English-style stout. Lots of flavor yet very easy to drink. However, I am strangely not compelled to seek it out again, as I would rather have the Kalamazoo Stout."
"D - A very good milk/sweet stout. Had a couple of these during the night but was ready to move on to something else after a bit."
"Definitely intend to purchase again. One of my favorite stouts to date."
"D: Indeed"
"D. This isn't really intended to be a session beer but it definitely goes down easier than, say, Bell's Kalamazoo Stout. This has a silkier, softer finish that, while still a bit thicker on the roastiness than I would like for the style, allows this brew to go down very smoothly."
"O: Awesome beer! I'll be buying more to share with friends and family."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very creamy fee. Carbonation gives a lightly fizzy feel on the tongue in the finish. Very easy drinking."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and would definitely recommend this to someone who seeks a dark malt character supported by a subtle coffee as a lactose come in at the end."
"When the server brought this to me there was easily two fingers worth of head on this beer. The head was a dark caramel color that stayed around for two minutes or so before subsiding. Then after the head subsided it left a prolific amount of lacing on the glass. For the pure aesthetics of appearance, this easily earned a five, just wow. It looks just like a stout should and the head was prevalent and pleasing to look at. The smell was faint, it was there but subtle. I was able to make out hints of vanilla and coffee notes. The taste was really something else. My first impression was that it was a bit watery, but as I continued to drink and as it continued to warm, Bell's Special Double Cream Stout became something truly wonderful. The cream was definitely present, but not overpowering, there was some roasted malts and I think I picked up hazelnut, not sure if that's in there but it had that impression on my tongue. The coffee notes and vanilla balanced so well together that it created a truly unique taste and mouthfeel, that I've at least never had before - it was like drinking a licorice yogurt. For real. The mouthfeel was thick enough and the balance of the ingredients created a yogurt like texture. This became more prevalent as it continued to warm, but I was enamored. I ordered another beer before I finished this one and I didn't want to stop drinking the Special Double Cream Stout! Pick this up, buy it on tap, whatever, just try this beer."
"Taste-Super smooth and creamy, rich, roasted coffee and toasted malts-A rather dry, black coffee finish."
"The taste starts out with a nice chewy blend of coffeee and sweetish malts. It stays subdued & true through the middle until the finish, where enough malty complexity opens up to resemble a breaded, smoked, candied culinary treat. Sweet tobacco and cocoa show up as well at the top of my mouth. Only a hint of lactic sweetness towards the very end, which turns quickly (I love when a beer changes direction on a dime) into a surprisingly bold, bitter hop finish. The medium body finds its way into all crevices and deposits the leaf-like bitterness of the hops. Did I say unexpected? I thought sweet stouts favor round malted milkiness instead of sharp flavors, and at first I am ready to deduct points... But then again...the chewy and well-carbonated mouthfeel helps keep extremely tight reigns on the beer, and combined with the smoky dryness, this is a restrained affair. The first several sips, I was not a big fan. Now the glass is empty and I wish I had another to give this a fresh look... That is a compliment. Again I am allured."
"Pours a deep dark brown with thin yet fluffy khaki head. Smell is brown sugar forward with a nice roasted matl backbone. Taste is very sweet up front... the malts give a chocolate, carmel and molasses taste to the middle and hints of dark fruit, smoke and earth on the back end. Presence of bittering hops noted. Full bodied yet creamy. The heavy body and the super-sweet taste keep this otherwise yummy brew from being top notch."
"Thanks again to EricWo for sending this one. Poured an inky black with a big billowing creamy tan head that left lacing all the way down my glass. This is one good looking beer. The smell is good, roasted malt and hints of chocolate but nothing too overwhelming or overpowering. The taste is sweet, with a taste of roasted malt and a little chocolate that coats your tongue. Very easy to drink with a smooth creamy mouthfeel. Really a well rounded beer. Excellent balance. An excellent example of one of my favorite styles."
"Bell's Special Double Cream is a nice, smooth, unremarkable, and safe stout."
"Poured a dark brown with red highlight when held to a light. Just a thin covering for a head and that faded to almost nothing. The aroma was coffee and sweet. The taste was coffee sweetened with chocolate, but there was just a hint of sour too. The feel was medium/heavy bodied with light carbonation. Drinkability was good. A half step down from 3F Moloko, an enjoyable beer and another solid effort from Bell's."
"Drinkability is good. This is a fairly good example of the style and it goes down pretty easy. Its not my favorite, but I could see having it again sometime."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: Very silky, creamy texture to it. A nice thick and hearty beer that goes down easy."
"D: A fantastic milk stout that is very well balanced and just well done overall. Bell's really seems to have a good handle on Stouts and I'm very excited to get my hands on Java and Expedition. This was a really easy drinking brew, sips very nicely with the milky/ mocha flavor. This goes in the must-try catagory, go get some if you're looking for a solid stout."
"Poured a very dark brown with hints of ruby along the bottom and sides of the glass. Head was light brown in color, but went quite quickly. A few pods of bubbles remained clinging to the top of this chocolate, coffee, and prune smelling brew. I got an almost vanilla extract flavor at the beginning.This was followed by coffee and sweet roasted malts. Also get the prune taste on the back end. I'm not really getting the chocolate many others have referenced. I love the feel of this. I'd have it again. Thanks for the haul buschbeer."
"I poured into a pint glass to a thin film of brown head. It is dark brown/black in color. I smell dark fruit, chocolate, and coffee. Very nice! It tastes very nice as well. I get the coffee right off the bat, but the chocolate and dark fruits come out subtly. I really like this stuff. This might be my favorite Bell's that I have sampled. I still have a lot to try though."
"Overall a little out of my standard range but I enjoyed it. Certainly a good effort from Bell's."
"Appears dark brown/black, almost opaque, with a light-brown head that was almost non-existent following a standard pour. Aroma was mainly chocolate, with noticeable roasted malt, and a hint of alcohol. Very inviting. As might be expected, taste was very sweet upfront with a light chocolate and mild roasted malt flavor. A light a sweet roasty flavor lingered into the aftertaste with a dry finish. Mouthfeel was smooth with little to no carbonation detectable. Body was light to medium. Lighter than I would have liked. This beer was enjoyable, but for me a bit too rich to have several."
"-Bye"
"Pours a pitch black with no head. The smell is all malt sweet roasted grain in the nose slight hint of alcohol. Taste is impressive this is a malt bomb, very thick and to the point. I can taste chocolate, prunes, coffee, sweet bitter honey. This leaves a sweet thick finish on my palate after drinking sip after sip. This truly needs to be sipped to enjoy the strong roasted character. Overall this beer holds a special place, it has so much flavor profile."
"This has quickly become my favorite sweet/milk stout. Great beer that drinks like a desert. Too bad this isn't distributed to Atlanta in bottles yet."
"for this stlye. I enjoyed this beer but would only have one at a time.I look forward to the next one."
"Overall: The mouth feel is silky creamy and velvety. The body of the beer is thick and rich and the finish is medium. This beer is a wonderful stout with a lot of cream flavor packing a punch. The beer isn't sweet at all but, nonetheless, the beer is wonderful."
"Overall: Good full stout, but a bit strong to be true to the style."
"Expected more out of this one. Especially with Bell's on the label. Didn't have the depth I was expecting. Was more tart than I thought a cream stout should be. Color was dark, little lacing left on the glass. Thinner than I thought it should be. Run of the mill stout. Good, but not worth searching all over for."
"I don't know if this is bad six pack or too old or what, but its a BIG disappointment to me. if I not bought it all the way in ORLANDO, I would take the rest back. i see its rank 3rd in milk stouts, i have to try again from somewhere else, but NOT in the same league at Young Double chocolate stout."
"Overall your traditional black color with tan halo around the rim. Leaves a touch of lacing as well. Not much of a nose honestly, maybe a touch of roasty malt and coffee. Taste is a slight dark fruitiness with coffee bitterness and a twinge of creaminess. Overll mouthfeel is light and airy for a stout. Not really all that wild about this. It doesn't seem to have the depth I thought it would. Just seems like another stout to me."
"A standard dark black color with a tan head. Smell is a little on the light side. A touch of bittersweet chocolate in the nose mixed in with a coffee scent. Taste has a little bit of a metallic bite to it. Cream taste definitely leaves it's fingerprint on this one. It combines with the bitter coffee and semi-sweet chocolate very well. A little on the thin side in the feel, and not as robust as it should be. A rare miss for Bell's. It's a little bit of a downer but not horrible."
"Special Double Cream Stout is an unbelievably easy drinker. The light body, and the delicious flavor, make this one go down very easily. Once again, Bell's brews a winner."
"Overall: A tasty and utterly enjoyable milk stout with plenty of chocolate, smoothly creaminess, and general tastiness to please the most discerning fan of the style. Definitely recommended."
"RBSG09 bottle at the grand tasting. Thanks to whoever brought this. Auburn-tinged brown with a fluffy tan head. Aromas of lactose, creamed coffee, milk chocolate. Porter-esque flavor, dark chocolate with little roastiness. Slight metallic note in the finish. Creamy body but nice and light."
"12oz. Poured very near black with a light brown head that was quick to dissipate and left minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas were of chocolate and roasted malts; rather sweet smelling. Tastes were of bold dark chocolate, roasted malts, and a hint of coffee. Finished nicely sweet with some milk chocolate as well. Mouth-feel was velvety smooth and creamy. Another solid brew from Bell's!"
"D: Very good beer and surprisingly easy to drink, given how ""heavy"" it is."
"D - Very drinkable. One tasty beer."
"Pours with a tan head that thins out while leaving a mild lace on the glass. The color is dark opaque almost black. The aroma is reminiscent of cocoa. Initial flavor is very much cream, almost like chocolate milk. As the beer warms a little, the 10 malts advertised begin to give a more complex flavor profile in addition to the traditional cream stout flavor. Low hop flavor doesn't get in the way of all the malts. Very drinkable beer. While the complex malt profile teases the tongue, it still in some ways is just another cream stout, just a more expensive cream stout. Worth a try, but wouldn't want to spend too much on what could be more affordable in other brands."
"The mouthfeel is nice, the beer is more carbonated than expected and the beer is also pretty light and easy to drink for a stout of this magnitude. But the flavor is a bit off, not something that I will have more than one of, this is the first Bell's brew that I haven't liked."
"Drinkability is great as these tend to slide down the throat easily. I really enjoyed each of these Double Cream Stouts."
"Not very drinkable. I used to think this beer's relative rarity around my parts meant it was especially good and exclusive. Now I wonder if it's relative obscurity relates more to its quality."
"Although I loved the aroma of this beer, the taste was a bit too burnt and bitter for my liking. Overall, this was definitely one of the more ""extreme"" versions of a milk stout I have yet to try."
"This is a great beer and one of the best milk stouts I've ever had. I'm lucky I was able to sample this on tap."
"Small fizzy bubbles cascade down the inside of the glass and make the carmel-colored head grow. The beer is perfectly black and allows no light to pass through the body. There are several key aromas that I detect. Chocolate, coffee, burnt plums, molasses, brown sugar, and roasted malt. An excellent combination. Nice creamy lactic texture and low carbonation. Not too heavy, either. But not too easy to drink. Sweet coffee and roasted malt is the most prodominant flavor feature in my opinion. A small bit of chocolate as well. But the taste seems weaker than the smell, if that makes sense. After sniffing the beer I expected a stronger flavor with more bite. It's pretty mild, but good. I feel some alcohol warmth also. Good beer."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. This stout appears a barely translucent dark brown color with two fingers of dense creamy, lingering foam. Aroma and flavors are of richly roasted barley, milk chocolate, mocha, caramel malt, and a touch of vanilla. Smooth and creamy and adequately carbonated. Great stuff."
"Overall this is an easy-drinking Milk Stout that balances that milk and stout portions quite nicely. Worth a shot."
"Notes: Another finely crafted beer from Larry Bell and Co."
"I haven't had s good Milk/Sweet Stout in a while, so this seemed like a fitting choice for tonight. Label says this comes from batch 8842. Thanks to the fam for briniging this beer back from Pennsylvania for me. Pour is a cool black, with about half a finger of tanned heading. Sweet lactose comes through in the aroma (as expected), along with some cream, chocolate and coffee. More of the same comes through in the smell. A roasty edge balances out the sweetness as well. Despite the ABV, body doesn't feel too big, more medium if you ask me. A few of these in a night would be no problem with some dessert. Overall a fine beer from the Bells line. Not their best stout, but definitely one of them. It reminds me of Left Hand's version a bit. Pair this with some tuffles and see how they work together. Cheers"
"I have had this before and noticed a metallic flavor, but this time (this bottle was kept in the fridge the whole time) I couldn't even find it. This beer needs to be drank fairly fresh and kept cool until it is consumed."
"overall - out of the few (6)milk stouts i have had this one is tops so far"
"MF/D: I do not like two things about this beer; the carbonation (which is a little high for my liking in this style), and the dryness, which is BONE DRY. Other than that, pretty drinkable, certainly enjoyable."
"Another great beer from Bell's. I would love to have more access to this beer due to the relatively low abv and the fact that it is not overly heavy."
"Black with dark brown head. Good carbonation. Smells of a typical stout with roastyness and sweet malt. The tasts are of sweet roasted flavor but has a strange tinney hint. Very smooth and not dry like a regular stout. I liked this cream stout and plan on trying some other brands to see what the cream stout is all about."
"""Being sober kicks ass!"" - Steve O"
"Excellent change of pace with this brew. Bells has yet to let me down."
"this is an extremely interesting beer. I am pretty sure this is my first milk stout. ive had other sweet stouts but not that were like this...at least that i could remember. a very nice brew that i would like to try again soon. well played bells"
"D: Very pleasant to drink, but one is quite enough for me."
"Wow, I really loved this beer, and I'm not a particular fan of the milk stout style. A big fluffy beige head tops a very dark brown beer. Very inviting. Sitting around with a couple other people, we did not want to stop sniffing this beer. Rattling off flavors such as the obligatory coffee and chocolate but as diverse as peanut butter, raisins, and even rice milk was thrown out there. Complex in the flavor as well. Lots going on and it's all working. Big roasty notes, molasses, aforementioned coffee and a nice milk-chocolateyness. Almost like a cup of coco, but with out being too sweet. Still maintains a nice finish. Silky and creamy on the palate. Very impressive. Special double indeed."
"Taste is refreshingly sweet and light. Mouthfeel is extraordinarily thick and creamy, and definitely fits the name. There isn't much hop character here and it isn't really that strong in terms of alcohol presence. It is fairly refreshing and a good dessert-type beer."
"D: This is a slow sipper. However, it's not terribly thick and might be nicer once the heavier stout season has passed."
" Now, if it only smelled better..."
"NOTES: I could easily make this a session beer. The beer was medium bodied, very enjoyable, and very rich. But, at 7.5% ABV I think as a session, I'd have to make it a very, very early night."
"D - One of the best milk stouts I've had. Extremely good...I could drink a ton of these if I had them."
"This one was interesting for me. A complex enough beer, but one dominated by one flavor. For me, the nose was entirely dominated with an aroma of bread. Bread cooling after being removed from the oven. Lots of yeast and flour. Not what I was expecting. Taste is sweet, very sweet actually, with flavors of caramel and maple syrup. Good stuff. However, again, the huge yeasty flavor of bread dominated the taste. While not bad, the bread/yeast smell is nice, it really does dominate the entire beer. Just seemed a bit strange to me."
"This is a very enjoyable stout from Bell's."
"Future outlook: Very good beer. The smell made me leery, but the taste and feel were better than expected. I'd be happy to have this again."
"Overall, a good beer. Maybe not the big brother to the K'zoo stout, but more like it's cool cousin. The one who would buy you your first beer, and it would be this one. Maybe. Still, good solid choice for a tasty beverage."
"Like good music, beer requires balance and harmony between its instruments. The use of such a profound malt bill has provided an orchestra of grainy, malty flavours that rotate positions like a game of musical chairs. It's too bad that with this being my last bottle I'm going to be the one left without a seat when the music stops. Thanks BuckeyeNation!"
"Jet black with a nice head that is gone way too quickly. Moderate amount of roasted aroma with a touch of hops. Great roasted flavor. Has a fantastic grainy sort of flavor-against the roasted malt it is really good. Mild, lingering coffee taste to it. Good body, maybe a touch thin. Very enjoyable. Bell's stouts usually are!"
"drank with whiterascal"
"12 oz bottle poured into a normal pint glass. This beer pours dark black with a then espresso colored head. It smells of chocolate, some sort of dark fruit, and dark malts. The taste is very nice. There is a a nice chocolate bitter coffee taste up front that changes to a sweet creamy finish. The carbonation is fine and this beer is top notch. It is a little thin so those that prefer their stouts thick should tread lightly. This is a great beer."
"This is very drinkable. Overall i really like this stout. A lot of good flavors going on here."
"Allow to warm up to 55 degrees or higher after decanting. Much better at a warmer temp."
"P.S. This beer is rated at 6.1% ABV on the bottle, not 7.5% like it states above."
"Mouthfeel is medium with little carbonation. Very creamy and smooth. Overall pretty good."
"I like a lot of bell's stouts and this one is up there, not top 3 but top 5."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, but light, with light but crisp carbonation."
"easy to drink and pleasant. if it wasn't hard for me to come by (ie, a trip out to PA to find it) i can see this being good for me and some friends before, during, and after dinner."
"D- Could definitely have more than one. 7.5% masked nicely, but could bite me in the ass if I had a bunch."
"D - The ABV is a little bit high to be really drinkable, but"
"I enjoy most of the product's by Bell's and this is also very enjoyable."
"Bell's has impressed me a number of times, and this one is immediately one of my favorites. I'm not sure I've ever enjoyed a stout this much. This is a rare find."
"D- This is a good milk stout. Certainly a much better imperial cream stout than creme brulee. Its good-but not as good as sessionable beers of the same character. I still do like this one and will have it again."
"Worth trying, for sure."
"D: High quality. I like this beer a lot and would order another and buy a six pack of it."
"This beer is fairly easy to drink, not too 'coffee-ee' (if that is a word..)"
"Pours pitch black with a thin creamy, tan head into my Belgian tulip glass. Chocolate notes laced with espresso both in the nose and taste. Smoot mouthfeel. Gets more expressive and tastier as it warms. A nice nice effort from Bells. Worth the price."
"Big thanks to psychohops for this one! Pours thick and black with a good amount of mocha brown head. Wafts of chocolate and coffee come from the pour. Sticking my nose in the glass for a quick huff reveals a lot of coffee with some hints of bitter dark chocolate. Taste is also coffee with a smooth, milky chocolate sweetness turning to a light hop bitterness. Great aftertaste and silky smooth mouthfeel. Thicker than most but nothing crazy. Very good beer."
"I would not refuse one of these if offered but I doubt I will seek it out."
"Super creamy mouthfeel. Silky smooth. Great dark chocolate flavor that finishes like a bitter coffee. Great roasted characteristics in this one. This was a very easy stout to drink; and most often with stouts for me it's one-and-done, but not this one. I could drink a few of these for sure. Recommend."
"D- I find it to be very drinkable. I don't think it's too strong and I can see myself having a few at a function."
"That off bitter flavor is the only thing that bothers me, otherwise this would be very drinkable."
"The pour was nice with a rich dark black color, with a small head of tan rising up and over it that settled down gently without much fan fare. Some nice lacing. The aroma was rich vanilla, molasses, sweet sugary notes and a touch of almost licorice like candy. Smooth, mellow carbonation let this one sit down nicely and made it a really nice sipper i have to admit. As it warmed subtle notes of chcolate and roasted malts took over, but always leaving it moderatly sweet, this was a nice little stout. I had no issues polishing this one off, and would have no issue in doing so again. A solid beer all around I would have to say."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice stout and as advertised would go every well with chocolate dessert. I could easily sip my way through a few of these in an evening."
"this stout pours a dark brown/black color with a big head that has a brown coffee ring around the glass.. the smell is delicious ..its coffee, chocolate,,mollasses ,dark currant fruity smells. the taste is the same but so smooth for a stout.. it fills the mouth with a malty/coffee chocolate semi-sweet bitterness that just warms the stomach..its very easy to drink for a stout although i only want 1 at a time..try this one as a first stout experience or keep on the rotation for the wintertime as i do..only available in the winter months... another great stout from BELLS who probably has the most seasonal stouts of any brewer"
"This is much sweeter and fruitier than Bell's Kalamazoo. I prefer the Kalamazoo over this and that shows in drinkability."
"D - Delicious flavor and slightly higher alcohol makes for a very enjoyable beer. I have to say this is among the better cream stouts I have tried. I really wish this was available in my state."
"Overall a good beer and if I saw it on tap somewhere I would get it but I am not going to waste any more trading efforts to seek it out."
"Taste has a slight roastiness and is mostly of sweet milk chocolate. Not much aftertaste with this stout. It has a decent mouthfeel that seems to have a bit more carbonation than average. Highly drinkable beer that I enjoy regularly."
"D- Something about this beer really works for me. I can't stop drinking it. I think it just goes down way too smooth. Too bad it's $10 for a sixer."
"All in all, not a bad brew. It was milder both in aroma and flavor than I'd expected, which makes it ever so drinkable, although it doesn't really fit the bill of you're looking for a strong sweet stout. An excellent brew none-the-less, and if it was available locally, it may be one of my go-to brews."
"This brew is absolutely phenomenal! Pours an oft-tan head with lacing. Smells of chocolate and coffee malts. Tastes the same. Extremely drinkable, almost scary. If priced a little better, I would keep this in the fridge year round. Very smooth and silky on the palate. A nice clean and crisp follow through. Love this one."
"As one who regularly sessions Irish dry stouts. I may have to add this to my session beers. Nothing too overwhelming but with an abundance of flavors on the nose and such an smooth feel I could def find myself putting back a few of these."
"Overall Impressions: Meh, it's okay, but I expect something thicker and creamier from a cream stout. The aroma was very nice, but the flavors don't follow suit and the result is a somewhat bland stout more akin to an Irish stout than a sweet milk stout."
"cant wait to try it on draft"
"D-Decent. Very smooth beer, a nice cream stout. I'll be keeping an eye out for this one as an occasional indulgence."
"This is the second offering I've had from Bell's, and like the first it makes a great impression. I will definitely be seeking out their other offerings."
"I'm adding this last paragraph about two hours after the initial pour. This beer just tastes better and better the longer it sits and warms up. Exceptional brew."
"D: An easy drinking stout that's smooth with a nice balance of malty flavor."
"Pours a very dark brown with a nice beige quarter inch head. Smell is roasted black malts and just a hint of coffee. Huge coffee flavor in the taste. Wasn't expecting that at all. Really dominant. A little cloying in the mouthfeel to be truthful. Very creamy and velvety smooth to drink. Very good, but still can't get over the amount of coffee in the flavor that I'm getting."
"I wanted to like this one so much more. I really think this has the potential to be a remarkable beer, but it's not quite there. Mouthfeel is superb, but it could just use more flavor, although not the grainy bite. With some tweaks this could be simply divine. For now, it's good, not great."
"Taste: Pretty thick and substantial mouthfeel. Roasted coffee upfront. Creamy taste and feel on the swallow. Mild bitterness."
"Aroma was a little off. The usual suspects were here but something wasn't quite right. I found it hard to pick out the tastes and smells on this one. I knew that I really didn't dig the harsh bitterness in this stout and I like hoppy beers. The harshness was more from a burnt wort or burnt grain taste than from hops."
"Thanks to drgonzo3705 for tossing this on a recent trade, I had been wanting to try this once. On name alone I am intrigued. Pours a very thin head, and a jet black, but thin looking brew. Its odd, it doesn't look as much like a stout, as it does an extremely dark ale, just not as dense. A fair amount of carbonization, as well. The creamy, sweet smell is strong, and quite delicious. That cream comes through hard in the flavor as well, it tastes like part beer, and part cream soda. There is a bit too much carbonation for my taste in a stout, and that combined with the sweetness deters me from being able to have much more than one."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: Bell's makes some fantastic beers, but this is not one of them. It's disappointing because their Kalamazoo Stout is such a fantastic beer. Unless you are a big fan of massive oat character stay away from this beer. Instead, save yourself some cash and go pick up a sixer of Bell's Porter or traditional Kalamazoo Stout."
"Drinkability: Overall, highly drinkable beer. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so I can't see myself drinking more than a couple of these beers. This beer would be perfect for dessert."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, however I would rather get a different product for the price. I enjoyed expedition a lot more and hopslam is such a bomb. This is one of bell's more expensive products and I just don't like it enjoy to want to purchase it again. All-in-all, a great beer, just not my favorite."
"D - A rich beer to sip, rich flavors with not a ton of alcohol."
"M/D - not alot of flavor with this one, interesting zest in the finish that wasn't expected. I guess I'd have to try it again to see what a different day would bring."
"OVerall: a highly enjoyable stout from an excellent brewery. Right up there with lancaster's milk stout, but i would still say that lancaster takes the style imho"
"6/4/7/3/14 (3.4/5)"
"This beer has a creaminess that is heavenly. It has a good balance on sweetness mixed with roasted flavors. It is extremely drinkable, partly because the 7.5% abv. is hardly noticeable. This beer would be great alone or with the dessert of your choice."
"D- Not to bad at all just a little to sweet for me. A solid brew that I could drink again."
"D - I really love the Milk Stout, if Bell's puts this much craft in the rest of their beers, I look forward to trying more of them in the future"
"Goes down smooth, easy to say the least. Awesome dessert beer! Well done by Bell's."
"Having said that, this beer has the unfortunate distinction of being of the same style as one of my go-to beers, Mackeson's Triple XXX. While I enjoyed this beer and would recommend it, I would personally just as soon grab a Mack. I try not to let my personal taste interfere with objectivity, but since I'm comparing apples to apples... well there you go."
"D - Not as lactic or milky as other milk stouts."
"Drinkability: it's hard for a beer to have all of the aforementioned qualities and be as easy to drink as a domestic and, alas, this brew fails in this category. I found it hard to have more than 2 of these in a sitting. The sticky residue, harsh taste, and full bodied characteristics allow this beer to be a treat, rather than a go to brew."
"D: An exceptional beer in the drinkability realm. I would be hard pressed to find a smoother stout that could handle itself on an evening of enjoyment quite like this beer. If there is one fault to the beer it is the ""busy"" taste. You get so many tastes and flavors all at once. By the end of the glass you can notice some additional flavors coming forth but its like watching someone in the fog, almost... but not quite."
"Finishes slighty dry and bitter. Nice example for a milk stout."
"In conclusion, I like this one a lot. A little heavy for more than one in a sitting, but this is to be expected from such a robust beer. I will definitely buy this one again, and I would have to say, I think it was better than most of the other Bell's beers I have tried."
"T. The taste is good, its got the complexity of a good stout, but lacks certain flavors that should be there. It doesn't live up to it's name, where's the double cream? Regardless the oat presence is noticeable. Some dryness is provided through both roasted malts and coffee bitterness. Some pretty good chocolate come out, and very slight dark fruit hints, mainly rasphberry. As noticeable in the smell, tons of bourbon. Not too much, but slightly overpowering to the other flavors. There's a slight roughness to the flavor, which I'm assuming is coming from the caramel malts. This is a good beer, I'm interested to see if it will smooth out with time."
"Easily my least favorite Bell's beer so far (I've tried 14 to date). It's not at all bad--I don't think even the worst Bell's beer would be terrible--and it won't be a chore getting through the other 3 remaining from the 6-pack. But I probably won't return. And, yeah, we should review to style, and I believe I am, but this has never been my favorite style, so..."
"This beer is nothing like the expedition stout, and is a nice departure from some of the RIS's I've been drinking of late. A very nice effort from Bell's, to no great surprise."
"Recommended for the super stout lover."
"Pours a nearly impenetrable black with a tall brown head with long retention. The smell is of surprisingly faint but still delicious cocoa powder. Taste is roasty: big on the dark chocolate and coffee elements, more sweet than bitter, all around yummy. Could be considerably heavier but still its weight is sufficient and quite easily sustainable if you want to drink several of these guys in a sitting."
"The body is firmly medium: not to thick and full, but far from thin. Finish is a little fruitier, and probably hoppy - it's a little hard to tell, but I think the hops are contributing that slight amount of complexity-adding fruitiness at each turn. 'Pretty drinkable, if not totally adventurous."
"20 ounce pint glass, served from cask at The Pub, Columbus, OH (Polaris). Pours a dark brown color with about a bit more than an inch off-white/tan head. It almost looked like a nitro-tap Guinness when it was brought to me. Lacing and head retention were both excellent. The aroma was chocolate, coffee, cream and roasted malt. The taste is the same as the aroma, it's good and sweet but also has a nice slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's very creamy and velvety with low/moderate carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, it's very smooth and creamy and extremely easy to drink. I'd drink this all the time if I could, I've had the beer from the bottle before and I like it a lot, but it's just excellent on cask. Recommended."
"D: Due to the sweetness of this beer, it is very difficult to drink more than a beer or two at a time. It should be paired with a hearty meal in order to fully enjoy every aspect of this awesome brew."
"D: 7.5% abv and really sweet limit this to 1-2 beers in a sitting for me. A great beer to drink though!"
"Drinkability: is very high ...great session"
"M/D - Good. Good mouthfeel and carbonation. A session-able stout."
"Black and a small head. There is a slight roasty smell to it, but not much else. The beer has a slight sweetness with a lot of roastiness. There isn't much much flavour in this beer, which is disappointing. The beer is roasty and slightly sweet, but nothing much else. The mouth feel is good, and it's drinkable. I'm quite disappointing with this beer."
"d: Hmmmm... a semi-imperial milk stout? Works for me!"
"D: Well, this is a very drinkable brew. Since it is in the single digits outside right now (as I am in Indy), a few of these is just the right medicine. Kudos to Bell's."
"D: Smooth with a small bite at the start."
"Opaque black, nice head that lasts, decent aroma - hints of chocolate, biscuit and coffee in the nose, ah, chocolate, biscuit and coffee in the mouth... A pleasant hint of drinking chocolate milk!"
"D: This seems like a great session beer."
"While this brew goes down way too easy, why even bother? I had high hopes for this one coming in but will likely not be purchasing it again."
"I would certainly suggest this beer. Bell's continues to impress."
"Pours Oily black No head to speek of,minimul lacing. Nose is very rich with straight forward coffee & chocolate with a bit of roast. Flavor is lightly sweet and malty with the light hops coming through in the end next to a bit of smoke. Not super complex at all, but very straight forward. Drinkable"
"Conclusion: The best Sweet/Cream Stout I've tried yet, and I'm not typically huge on the style. Bell's has a real winner here, this would be an absolutely fantastic dessert beer, this would kill with a nice Yorkshire caramel shortbread."
"D: One of the most drinkable stouts around with its great blend of sweetness and roasty character."
"Very solid and interesting stout. Flavors could be stronger, but well worth trying."
"The beer was cold when I started, but I let it warm up before I finished it. When warmer, there are more complex flavors and other nuances. I would suggest drinking slightly colder than room temperature for maximum enjoyment."
"Overall, a good drinkable cream stout. And not just a stout for stout lovers, but one that would go over well with many beer drinkers, regardless of their favorites. This could definitely work its way into a reserved spot in my fridge. Quality."
"Drinkability- Other than the mouthfeel, I like this brew better out of the bottle. It might have been that the bottle had a little age on it unlike the fresh cask but it seemed to make a world of difference. Still pretty tasty though and glad to have had again."
"Drinkable and delicious from a killer brewery. Maybe my favorite black beer from Bells."
"D: Very drinkable. Like above, the sweetness eases the coffee like bitterness."
"D - Solid brew, but I was slightly disappointed by this one in the bottle, as I found it phenomenal from the tap... Still an enjoyable milk stout that is overly sweet and can be enjoyed sip after sip..."
"D- Very drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Says 6.1 ABV on the bottle, not the 7.5 it says here. Its not a particularly heavy beer, and with the ABV at a reasonable level, you could certainly have many of these, but the beer just doesnt do that much for me. It will probably be my last."
"Pours a dark black color with a thin brown head. Aroma of malty chocolate, roasted coffee and hops. Very smooth, easy drinking stout. Nice balance of creamy chocolate maltiness with a nice touch of bitter hoppiness."
"I wasn't entirely sure how this was going to turn out. I've tried so many milk stouts and was curious about Bell's ""double"" take on the style, being that they like to try doing thier own thing. I was definitely not disappointed by this, and if you come across it ever, I highly reccomend a try."
"D - It is a touch too bitter for my taste but the mouthfeel is so wonderful that I find myself wanting another sip and another!"
"Pours black with a dark tan head. Aroma is of chocolate, caramel, and fresh roasted coffee. Lots of malt here. Nice blend of sweetness up front with some roasted bitterness. A slightly dry and tart finish. Pretty smooth feel with a perfect level of carbonation. A very nice stout, though I enjoy the Kalamazoo Stout more which is available year round."
"good mouthfeel, average drinkability for me."
"D: Stouts at Bells are some of the best and this one does not disappoint."
"D= This is a very drinkable sweet stout. I think I prefered the 2007 version more though, as this year's is much lower in abv."
"Real dark brown pour, cream colored head. Roasty coffee, malt and mocha. Not extreamly ""creamy", but it has the best of milk stout flavor with the edge of a double. More roasty malt and coffee than a normal sweet, but has the chocolate, mocha and slight lactic tones. More hoping than usual creates this balance I would guess. Drinkable and dangerously sessionable with it's slightly lower abv that beers with similar characteristics, ie imperial or double stouts. This is somewhere between a sweet stout and a double, which is what makes it a standout and unique to me. Nothing out there is quite like this one."
"Really very good, not as much as I would have liked in the creaminess department though."
"Notes from 4/16/06"
"Really, the only thing I was disappointed in was the mouthfeel. It's just too prickly and a tad too thin. If Bell's works on that, this could be a real winner of a sweet stout in my book."
"D - This is a very good stout. I didn't know what to expect from the double cream name, but this beer was very enjoyable. As mentioned earlier, it has a nice sweet and burnt balance that makes me want to keep drinking it."
"Overall: yummy"
"This beer pours a thick black oily color with a small off white head that quickly disappears. Smells of dark chocolate and coffee, somewhat similar to Bell's Java. Tastes sweet with roasted malt and bitter coffee flavors. The mouthfeel has medium body and is creamy. Overall a solid offering from Bells. Certainly worth a try."
"Thanks Bell's."
"This is like an art piece by a well-regarded contemporary artist you don't really like... I don't enjoy it, but I appreciate that it has complexity and value to someone else."
"Probably the best stout I've had."
"This beer is absolutely delicious...one of the best beers I have ever had. YUMMY!"
"HV"
"velvety and smooth as hell. easily drinkable. fantastically balanced"
"A very nice milk stout, but I'm not sure I'd want to have more than one or two in a sitting."
"D-Real easy to drink not a huge amount of flavor but a very solid brew"
"I dont think I can review the taste on this fairly off just one bottle. This is going back onto the wants."
"D - enjoyable and interesting. not a main stay and not to strong. the unrecognizable smell is distracting"
"Overall, the ol' Double Cream Stout -- when in season -- is going to be a regular part of my rotation."
"Absolute velvet in my mouth. The chocolate and coffee tones are powerful but still manage to be elegant. A late kick of oats and roasted nuts. A little more carbonation than I need in a milk stout, or any stout for that matter. All together it's pretty close to a symphony and an excellent choice for first stout of the season."
"D: Nice sessionable sweet stout. If this really has 7.5% ABV, then I'm smitten. Not noticeable whatsoever. More like a 5% brew if that. Exceptional stout."
"d - good beer but one will be enough. almost too dry and grainy."
"This can replace a chocolate desert, or compliment it rather than coffee."
"I enjoyed this brew very much I am a big fan of the smooth cream stouts. It's incredibly drinkable for the ABV on this, it could sneak up on you fast with how easy it drinks."
"black and no head even with a hard pour. smells sweet and bready, almost like grahm crackers. some vanilla notes also. it has a light-medium body and is creamy. it is very rich and roasty, especially in the aftertaste. very smooth and drinkable, but in no way weak on flavors. there is a very good balance of sweetness and roastiness."
"This is a solid beer, one that I will keep around in the future."
"D: This beer is pretty damned drinkable for the style. It is incredibly easy to drink. I am down with this beer. It has areas to improve but it is still tasty and drinkable in mass. I like it."
"Drinkability: This was one strange and unique beer, like many of Bell's brews are. Definitely the creamiest, milkiest milk stout I've ever had, and though the alcohol was reasonable, it was almost a little too milky for me. Very interesting though, and at least worth one try."
"D - good work Bell's dudes! This is an enjoyable sweet stout (another review said there's no lactose, so I guess technically it's not a milk stout) which I like quite a bit. Definitely up there with Duck Rabbit Milk Stout (though perhaps a tad less mind blowing), which is a personal fave. Highly recommended if you can get it. Will certainly save one for the coming cold weather"
"My favorite cream stout remains the Samuel Adams Cream Stout, but I can also recommend this one."
"Drinkability: moderate to low - too many competing strong tastes make it hard to get through very quickly."
"A little bit of everything in this one but it is still undoubtedly a cream stout. Very nice and very drinkable."
"Pours almost black with a dark tan head that dissipates very quickly. Roasted aromas dominate with some chocolatey overtones. Taste is roasted, slightly sweet with some chocolate flavors. Thick, creamy and rich mouthfeel - the best part of this beer. Easy drinking beer. I hope I can get my hands on some more of this beer."
"A solid brew. Great to drink with a cigar on a fall night. Not an everyday style, but a good offering. Another choice brew from Bell's"
"Pours a deep black with a nice light tan head that retains ok. Nose is somewhat weak roasted malt, a bit of chocolate. Taste follows with some good roasted malt, some lactose, chocolate, a tiny bit of dark fruits, and some cream. Almost a bit of cherry sweetness. Was imagining more cream on this one. Mouthfeel is pretty good, about what it should be for an amped up milk stout. Drinkability is very good here, as there is little heat, and it goes down quite smooth. Overall a solid brew, a good stout, as most are from Bell's. This isnt one im going to write home about or put up some annoying ""OMG blah blah blah beer is soo goood!!!!"" Bar Talk post on, but all the same, it is a good beer, and i could see myself purchasing this one from time to time if i was a michigan man. good brew."
"Fantastic stout, very easy to consume mass quantities. One of the best tasting stouts I have had."
"D: Still not a huge fan of this style but his beer diverges enough from this style to make it interesting for me. Really like what I have had from Bells. Got this in NJ and wish Bells would be in NY."
"This bottle is quite good, though I seem to remember this beer as being the best milk stout I had ever had. Perhaps it lost a bit in the past few months, and might be noticeably better when very fresh."
"D- very easy to finish a couple of these if i had the chance. i hope this one makes it to chicago later this winter."
"Bells, expand your distribution to California, I beg you."
"Bitter aftertaste and hefty body keep this brew in the ranks of an admirable sipper."
"D - Very drinkable. I enjoyed this one quite a bit, and will certainly reach for it again when I get the opportunity."
"Drinkability- Great beer here. Haven't been disappointed by Bell's yet. Seek out!"
"For not being an actual Milk Stout, it does taste like one. Looking at the Bell's site it says the OG is 1.075, so that would mean it only has about 58-60% apparent attenuation. I guess that would be the source of the residual sweetness in it. Assuming I am correct about that process, I think I like it better than using lactose sugar. Very tasty stuff from Bell's."
"Nice beer to drink despite the 7.5%"
"Eh, not as impressed by this one as most Bell's offerings, but it's still a decent beer."
"A: Jet black at first, but when back lit there is a burgandy hint to it. Minimal head that leaves next to no lace. If I remember correctly anyway. Seemed a bit too wet and not so sticky. I dug it, but need to try this winter to try to re dig it."
"Pours a very dark brown, tan head rises slowly but fades quickly, leaves a small amount of lacing behind. Smell is milk chocolate, some roasted coffee, with a trace of vanilla. Taste is sweet, dry, lots of coffee aftertaste, slightly charred background. Medium-bodied stout, lots of lingering flavors and slight bitterness. This is never going to be my favorite style of stout, but this is certainly drinkable, and plenty tasty."
"D: A very good stout. Easy to drink, and at 6.1% alcohol, would make a nice session beer for the stout lovers."
"I could definitely drink this over and over again. A solid stout all the way."
"My choice so far of the Bell's stouts. Nice beer."
"Drinkability: Very, very drinkable. Nails it on the mouthfeel alone. This is a style that is supposed to be sweet and creamy and I feel that Bells lives up to it."
"This one was surprisingly balanced and very smooth, but also full flavored and mildly complex. Went down very easily. Great session beer."
"M&D: Full body, creamy, next to no carbonation, great mouthfeel. This is one of the more drinkable stouts I have ever had. At only 6.1% ABV I could session this. Once agian Bell's proves it is at the top of the foodchain for craft brewers. Skal."
"So drinkable, was hard to sip this one slowly. Just be sure to let it warm a bit - much richer smell and flavor in the 50's than straight from the fridge."
"Nice after dinner beer to be paired with a chocolate oriented desert of some sort. Or anytime really if you're like me."
"Overall, a decent brew, but not one I will search out."
"D - A very filling brew, and something that probably wouldn't keep me interested past the first bottle. Price is steep as well. Easy to get through this glass, but I'll be glad to move on to something else."
"Drink em' if ya got em'..."
"pour from bottle to snifter. light brown head that laces ok. aroma is of chocolatey roasty malts very delicious notes. very mellow espresso like aftertaste with a creamy finishs. good stout from a good brewer who never dissapoints. could definitely pound a few."
"Smooth and lightly creamy with plenty of carbonation to keep it from being heavy or cloying. Easy to drink."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Moderate alcohol levels and decent flavors make for easy consumption. A nice beer."
"D- These seem easy to put down but be wary because it is a dark beer andit could kick you in the ass later. A nice sixer of these would be recommended in building something. Carpentry beer as i like to call it!"
"D - No real bitter to it, VERY drinkable. I'd call this a session beer."
"This is not the most complex beer, probably not even my fave stout, but something about this beer (reminded me of yoo-hoo or something w/ alcohol)...if it was on tap or something at a local watering hole I'd be sessioning this hours. Just my opinion and personal taste."
"Exceptionally drinkable. Exceptional brew. I do enjoy this one."
"mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, silky and slightly bitter"
"drinkability is good. this is a full bodied and rich stout that is not dry or bitter, while remaining creamy and lightly sweet. cheers!"
"12oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Beer is a nice ruby-brown and leaves a 1 inch mocha colored head which dissipates to a thin layer very quickly. There is a very nice ring left around the edges, still having that mocha color. I'm surprised by the lack of malt smell. Instead I'm greeted with a recognizable lactose smell, probably common in milk stouts! Go figure! There are plenty of chocolate and coffee notes as well. The taste to this is actually just the reverse of the smell. Immediately I am punched in the face by a barrage of coffee, dark chocolate, and burnt malt flavors. It tastes pretty similar to what I drank for breakfast, only much much colder. I've had a few milk stouts before and I'm expecting a lactose taste, but it never seems to shine through as prominently as I expect. Once I let it warm up I can pick up on more of a milky taste, but it's very subtle. With each sip this beer gets silkier and silkier. This is absolutely delicious! I've drank about half of the bottle and I can start to fell some of the effects of the 7.5%. I'm definitely picking this up as soon as I can!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Solid black with only the fringe allowing light through. The head is tan and thick. Tight head that stays for most of the session. The aroma is smooth compared to their regular stout. There is a spiciness that I can't place that comes through in the nose. The taste is smooth! There is an oatmeal stout feel, but the body is a great blend of malts, roasted toffee, and roasted malts. I would say that this resembles an oatmeal stout, but that is probably what they were intending. The body is decent, but there is a slight heaviness. I would drink this all night if it were cheaper or I was making more money."
"D: Very smooth, but almost gets a little sweet after a while. Not cloying and sticky, fortunately. Smooth enough for a couple or more, or until the ABV gets a bit overwhelming."
"overall, wow this is truly a good brew"
"Purchased at the General Store next to the Eccentric Cafe in Kalamazoo, MI. Batch # 8314 printed on the label. Served in a nonic. Poured a deep, opaque brown, almost black, with ruby red highlights around the edges. Half-inch khaki-colored head with good retention and ample sticky lacing throughout the tasting. Scents of malt and cream, but very subdued. Flavors of coffee and chocolate with a malt background and a nice roasted character followed by a pleasant sweet cream finish. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a light carbonation bite. This brew went down very easy, combined with the fact that the alcohol was very well hidden, makes the drinkability quite exceptional for the style."
"Pours almost black with a dark tan head that dissipates rapidly. Roasted aromas dominate with some chocolatey overtones. Taste is roasted, slightly sweet with some chocolate flavors. Thick, creamy and rich mouthfeel - the best part of this beer. Easy drinking beer. Overall, a good brew."
"This is an example of why I prefer Belgian darks instead of various American Stouts, more complexity, more flavors."
"I didn't find it to be too sweet, something I was concerned with. In fact, I know it is supposed to go well with chocolate but I have a different idea. I am serving it with a flat bread pizza, with gorgonzola, pear and figs."
"This was an excellent milk stout. Slightly sweet and creamy. This makes an excellent beer on a cold day like we're having in Minnesota right now. It's nearly May and snowing!"
"M/D - Medium mouthfeel. Good beer. Could have several of these. There are better stouts but this one is good none the less."
"Smell is of milky chocolate and slight coffee notes. Coffee notes are more prominent on palate. Mouth feel is filling, more bubbles than seen, but well balance. Somewhat heavy, but very nice. I'm going to sit and enjoy the rest of this this one"
"A pretty good milk stout. I've got another that I'm going to hold on to for awhile and see how it develops."
"D: The slight bitterness makes you slow down a little as you drink it. However, since it is so balanced with the sweet in mouth flavor it is pretty easy to drink down."
"D: It was a well balanced sweet stout that was not overly sweet and balanced well the hops and hid well the alcohol. This might merit cellering for six months or more to see if it integrates its flavors even more. Nice beer but too rich for more than a single at a time."
"D: Very drinkable, not overwhelming for a stout. I will definately be searcing for some more of these."
"Very nice version of the style."
"This stout pours a brownish black with a one finger tan head into a pint glass. Cream and roasted malts are two of the biggest aromas that I could pick up on. It tasted the same with a hop and coffee after taste. It was rich and thick and very easy to drink!"
"This is a stout you can enjoy for an entire evening. I wish it was available locally in the Pacafic Northwest!"
"T: Very creamy and fluffy body, slightly oxidized. Very malty, toasted and burnt flavors, that begins very sweet and finishes with a slightly more bitter hop taste. There is also a light alcohol burn in the finish. A very nice sweet stout, and full of flavor but a little to thick and hot to be very drinkable."
"I bet this stuff is killer on draft."
"D: Although I have never been a fan of something as thick as a stout to be a session beer, I think I could find myself easily downing a handful of these. A great beer."
"Drinkability- Even with the higher ABV of 7.5% I could session these and drink them all day. In fact, I may end up buying a six pack and use it for my summertime lawnmower beer. Come now, honestly, tell me that you drink light lagers when YOU mow the lawn?"
"This was a pleasure to drink. I'm truly sad I only had one."
"What a delicious brew this is... Just about the right consistency and mouthfeel for a sweet stout, this brew really hit the spot. It looked great, smelt of chocolate and sweet malts and tasted delicious. One of the best sweet stouts I've had. It reminds me of the Sammy Smith Oatmeal Stout except a little thicker and tastier."
"This poured an opaque black with a little dark tan head. It smelled like coffee and heavy cream with a bit of dark chocolate. It tasted like creamy mocha with a hint of bitterness, a very rich flavor but not too strong. It was exceptionally thick with no carbonation and a mild aftertaste. Overall this was one of the best stouts I can remember. I liked it purely for its own merits, not because I expected it to be good based on hype. Truly an excellent beer."

"This is a very drinkable and roasty stout. I was expecting more sweetness or mouthfeel from the name, but it was still great."
"Pours black with a foamy tan head. Very subtle cream and roasty smell on the nose. Nice but too subtle. Some smoke in the nose and taste as it warms only. Fairly creamy body with light notes of coffee with cream or milk, and a roasty maltiness. Pretty smooth overall and easy drinking. Bittersweet creamy roast pretty much sums it up with some Kalamazoo-esque smokiness coming through as it warms. Nice beer."
"Just a tad bit too much of a burnt aroma and flavor for me, keeps it from being a more perfect beer."
"A very easy to drink stout with the alcohol hidden very well. I could certainly enjoy a few more."
"Drinkability: Bell's has really got a handle on the stouts, I'll give'm that. For me, it comes in third after the Expedition and Kalamazoo stouts."
"Poured this nice stout into a pint. Looks good going in and tastes good going down. Obviously dark, not quite pure black, thick but not ""motor oil"" thick in the glass. Slight tan head that quickly retreats to the edge of the glass. Bit o' yeast in the bottom of the bottle that I gladly swirled around and emptied into the glass (gotta have my vitamin B for the day). Aroma better than good. Nice roasted malt aroma, a step back from being ""burnt."" Sweet smelling, milk chocolate, cakey. Flavor is pleasantly mild and slightly tangy. Rich, caramel, milk chocolate, roasty, slight hop tang in the finish. Mouthfeel is very smooth and full bodied."
"D - Pretty darn drinkable. I really like this one and it is making a fine desert!"
"Overall- A unique vanilla/ milky coffee taste makes this enjoyable. A pint or two would be sufficient during dinner."
"This is pretty much a two-dimensional beer: grain and cream. I prefer Sam Adams' cream stout, but I certainly wouldn't turn one of these down. If cream stouts are your mug of beer, you should certainly give this one a taste."
"Very deep opaque brown with a creamy brown head. Aroma is cocoa and sweet with some molasses and cereal in there. Taste is sweet but nicely bitter at the end so its not over the top. Some burnt dark chocolate and sweet coffee there as well. Very tasty. Not quite as thick as I was hoping, but still very good, and the alcohol (7.5?) Is nowhere to be found, so it's quite drinkable. A restrained sweet stout, but still well worth the money."
"D-one of my favorites, incredibly rich and, a treat for the palate."
"Tastes of sweet chocolate malts, bitterness and roasted coffee. Very smooth mouthfeel with a dose of carbonation as well."
"D_An enjoyable experience but nothing mind blowing. Not as good as their Expedition stout."
"There are plenty of stouts in the universe, this one is not too high on my list."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is heavy and full with an abundance of fine carbonation allowing for this brew to go down easy. A very good sample for the class and another great brew from Bell's."
"Bell's Special Double Cream Stout pours an opaque black with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Roasted malt dominates the aroma. The flavor is dominated by roasted malt, it tastes like chocolate and a bit like coffee, caramel comes to mind too. Kick ass beer."
"I could drink this one all night long. I'm looking forward to more of these."
"D - Very rich w/ a nice blend of roasty and smooth. Very quaffable, one of the most drinkable of Bell's beers and a sweet, yet not cloying stout which is very well made."
"A very drinkable stout I like it better than the Expedition stout and I am going to savor every last drop of this one"
"A decent brew, but not great."
"d: High drinkability, good flavor without being overly sweet or filling. One of the better milk stouts out there."
"Taste is mostly malt, very creamy as the name suggests, slight coffee bitterness, some caramel and chocolate undertones as well, slight dark fruit presence. Very complex stout, I believe it when they say there's 10 different malts in it."
"d - it has a good flavor, but I don't think I could drink to many of these. It's almost like a small meal for me. My bottle says 6.1 abv, but this page says 7.5, so I don't know if they changed it recently or not. Either way it wouldn't be a session beer or something I could drink more than 2 of. The only thing for me that made this worth trying was to experience the smooth mouthfeel of this brew."
"A fine stout but not the best from Bell's brewery. If you see this in the store next to the expedition stout, pass it by and grab the expedition."
"Music enjoyed whilst sampling: 3 the Hard Way by the Beastie Boys"
"Pours opaque with a very dark tan head. Malty nose. Nice roasted bean flavor profile with an obvious sweet tone to it. Thick liquid feel. Nice level of carbonation. Overall, I'll say this is a pretty great brew. Hearty with a slight rich edge to it, it's a good enough stout I wouldn't mind trying on-tap."
"Very easy to drink and one of the better examples of the style. One of the better upper Midwest breweries."
"This is a fairly easy beer to drink but the residual sweetness and body make it a heavy beer on the palate. Still another great beer from Bell's."
"Overall, a good beer. Certainly full of malts and not much else, so if that's not what you're looking for, don't bother. But for what this is, it's quite tasty."
"This is a very enjoyable beer. I completely recommend this one to anybody who enjoys a good solid stout. This one should sit at the top of the Sweet Stout category. Recommended."
"D: This is a great stout. Not overly thick and syrupy, and the taste travels well. I will gladly reach for one of these again."
"Poured into a standard pint glass: Pours a dark black with a hint of redness. Medium head with not too long retention and limited lacing. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. Taste was very well balanced and featured notes of everything I smelled and more. Mouthfeel was sweet, buttery, creamy...lactose. I definitely enjoyed it and would love to try it on tap to compare notes and see it there is anything missing from the bottles."
"Pours a light-less dark brown/black with a nice 2 fingers of creamy tan head, good retention and good lacing. Smells of chocolate, roasted coffee, and cream. Tastes of milk chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt with a touch of hops in the finish for a nice balancing blend. Medium in body with a good balance, smooth and creamy. A very easy to drink, flavorful milk stout with a nice sweetness to it."
"Drinkability: I can't see myself having more than a couple of these a night as they are quite rich; however, this is a great brew that I intend to have more of in the future."
"This beer has a mocha and malt aroma. The taste is similar. The flavor profile isn't complex but has a nice slightly sweet chocolate and rich malt taste. Medium body with a creamy feel that finishes slightly dry. Carbonation is well matched to the beer. A very good sweet stout but not one I could drink a lot of, more of a special occasion or dessert beer."
"Drinkability - is good. A real easy drinker. I could enjoy a few of these throughout the night."
"Medium-full body in body. Creamy yet crisp, rich, almost chewy. Easy to drink. Nice balance of roast and sweetness. Excellent - the best Milk/Sweet Stout I've had."
"Drinkability is quite nice. This would be a good choice for grabbing a 6-pack and warming up in the winter with."
"Very tasty stout and not hyper alcoholic either. A tasty beer that I will gladly drink again."
"D- It's a very tasty brew. I could down a lot of these very easily. Maybe one day when I head up to Bell's I will have a night with these."
"D: A delicious, rich stout, not too heavy and packed w/ roasted goodness. The M.F. could use a bit more carbonation and is best suited to a desert or as a desert."
"Not a bad beer at all from Bell's, heard the bourbon barrel version of this is delicious from a friend who lives near the brewery, look forward to trying that someday, highly recommended, we will see in a few weeks if the Expedition Stout and Batch 7000 measures up to this one"
"Poured into a snifter. Pours a pitch black sea into my snifter with a dark tan head that recedes at decent rate. Chocolate of the bat in the nose. Very sweet aroma from the 10 different malts. Also has a very roasted aroma. The double cream stout has an extremely rich flavor. So much flavor with all the malts. This is perhaps my favorite beer from Bell's. Coffee, Chocolate and molasses are all over this one. This beer makes the mouth salivate. Great sweetness with matching bitters. That roasted flavor is lingering for a while. At 6.1% this could become my new session stout if it wasn't so limited. Pick this up, you won't be disappointed."
"Overall- I had it en lieu of dessert. Great beer that was even more enjoyable when served from the cask. I'd love to come across it again in cask form."
"Overall, a nice Stout that is easy to drink and enjoy."
"D: Bitter and strong as it is: it is also refreshing. Chug-a-lug Chug-a-lug makes you want to yell ""yummy ass!!!"""
"D = This is definitely a drinkable beer. I could easily see this being my go to stout for cold Winter evenings."
"Very drinkable, just with the aroma had done more for me. I will certainly be seeking this out again."
"D: low abv, not obtrusive flavor, pleasant, not terribly unique, but still quite enjoyable, a flavorful stout you don't have to fuss over"
"Drinkability: also pretty good. would be tough to have more than 3 of these at one sitting, but would be an excellent dessert beer"
"drinkable?: INDEED! bottoms up!"
"Full bodied and easy to drink. A great beer!"
"12 oz bottle. Pours a thick nearly black color with 2 cm brown head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma is dominated by chocolate, some hints of sweet malt. Flavors of chocolate, cream, and smoky malt. Medium body, significant lacing, no real alcohol detected, and lasting aftertaste. Very tasty and drinkable, almost a pop feel."
"A slight metallic bitterness hurts the drinkability, but not much."
"This beer is a dark brown with reddish edges. It has a nice coffee like aroma. The beer tastes pretty good. Like coffee, but it isn't as full flavored as i'd like to see. My only complaint would be it could feel a lot more creamy. The malt is fairly well balanced by the hop. Not a lot more to say about it."
"Pours a very dark black with little to no head. Smell is of deep roasted malts and bitter chocolate. Bitter chocolate hops presents first. Followed by a silky roastedness which develops more in the aftertaste. Quite nice indeed. Well structured. Aftertaste lingers for a bit, yum. I could enjoy this beauty all night."
"D- Bring it on bartender! I could drink this until I was full. Because I think I would get full before drunk on this beer. Very good over all. Top 10 stouts for me!"
"Taste is light roasted with chocolate and mild coffee hints. Mouthfeel is a little sticky and very smooth and the roast is never sharp. The alcohol is nicely hidden. I am not sure where this double cream comes from, but it was creamy. A nice beer! Thanks to dogfooddog for this beer."
"Notes: An overall good sweet stout that's readily available in most areas, which gives it points in my book."
"D- A nice drinking stout that expresses a bit of alcohol upon warming. I probably wouldn't age this too long, as I think this might have lost a bit of personality in the past year."
"Pours opaque with a very dark tan head. Malty nose. Nice roasted bean flavor profile with an obvious sweet tone to it. Thick liquid feel. Nice level of carbonation. Overall, I'll say this is a pretty good brew. Hearty with a slight rich edge to it, it's a good enough stout I wouldn't mind trying on-tap."
"I liked this beer. Virtually black, it lacked a head but was impressive looking. Not a lot of aroma, just some maltiness. It's very smooth and not sweet at all, which surprised me. The alcohol is completely masked, wouldn't know it was there. Nice and toasty on the finish. Goes down beautifully. Very nice!"
"While I plan on drinking this again, I was expecting a bit more."
"I really like this beer. It is brilliantly crafted and top notch for the style. At 6.1%, I think that I could easily drink a gallon without growing tired of it. Utterly easy to consume with almost nothing negative about it. In fact, if I were forced to find a negative, it would be that I do not currently have another to enjoy. This is worth seeking out."
"No one flavor stands out with this stout...pretty smooth nothing fancy."
"This one was a let down for me."
"Dark licorice brown with half an inch of tan foam. Aroma of toasted malt. Taste was appropriate for the style but was rather unremarkable to my taste, not sweet enough for a sweet stout. Mouthfeel was good and the carbonation was nice. But I probably wont drink this one again, not because it was bad but because they are many others that are better at the same price."
"Appearance- licorice colour with an ebony/reddish hue. Head dissipates quite quickly, however lacing is ok. Nose- more licorice, oatmeal and some roast. Taste- light roasts, milk chocolate and anise. Carbonation was pretty spritzy for the style, otherwise nice mouthfeel. Drinkability is good- I had no idea that this was 7.5%. Good stout on a winter's day."
"Bell's Special Double Cream Stout pours a dense, opaque black with a dark tan head. It has a pleasant smell, moderately strong of roasted malts. The taste offers a wonderful, and more intense dose of malts than can be detected in the smell. Overall this has a great blend between a medium and thick bodied beer that just goes down super smooth; making this one a bit too easy to down."
"D: Tasty and creamy, but filling. Mostly a dessert beer or one for sitting next to the fire on a cold day. Overall pleased. Not astounded, but happy."
"With a name like ""Special Double Cream Stout," a expected some serious cream. I don't know what they ""doubled," but this just came off like a big stout with a little less of a dry, roasted feel. No, it's not bad, there's a dark malt profile that's similar to a mocha coffee, maybe with a touch of cream. Basically it's a good stout, but I don't know if it's special."
"D: Way too sweet. I'm had it on tap several times with the same conclusion."
"Drinkability - this is very, very good ale. Thouroughly delicious and hearty, and quite sessionable."
"In all I like this beer, summed up in sentence one."
"A very drinkable beer, but if I am having a Bell's stout, I would take the Kalamazoo Stout over this one every time."
"D - Good, not my favorite but I could defenitely drink a couple while relaxing."
"This beer is so close to being a five it pains me. The malt bill is incredible. However, the citrusy hoppy profile should be a little bit more piney to compliment the flavors of the malt bill better."
"My favorite stout so far. I would definitely recommend this to cream lovers everywhere!"
"Bell's has yet to disappoint me with a stout and the trend continues here. Just a fantastic smooth drinking sweet stout with an excellent subtle character that's a pleasure to enjoy."
"Overall, pretty solid but nothing outstanding. I would put this in terms of taste as a middle beer one that tries to be a chocolate stout but does not fully make it there and one that is a bit sweeter than some of the other milk stouts that I've had."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a large tan head that features excellent retention and a good amount of lacing around the edges of the glass. The aroma is dark roasted malts, and hints of chocolate and coffee. Wow, the smell is mouthwatering! The taste is much like the aroma, it starts out smooth and roasty with hints of charcoal and finishes with a good amount of bitterness. Overall, this is another fantastic stout in Bell's outstanding lineup. Recommended."
"It pours a black obsidian hue with a brown off color head into the pint glass. Great lacing as the beer progressed all the way to the end of the beer. It has a sweet roasted barley scent with aromas of vanilla, rich chocolate, and a bit of coffee. The taste follows the nose into roasted barley with chocolate and cocoa notes. I didn't get any coffee flavor on tongue, but a bit of vanilla did come to life as the beer warmed more. The mouthfeel on this is smooth and creamy and coats nicely with the alcohol very well hidden. Drinkability is also high due to the low carbination and silky smooth mouthfeel and not overly high alcohol ABV. I could easily make this a session stout."
"Poured into a pint glass a rich and dark black color with a creamy light brown head that leaves a nice amount of lacing along the side of the glass. Smell is of chocolate and a milky creamy aroma. Not very strong but very enjoyable with a slight sweetness. Taste has very little kick just a sweet taste. Was anticipating a hop or strong kick, but did not happen. Mouthfeeling is creamy all the way through."
"Absolutely one of my favorite stouts. Pours a pitch black with a beautiful dark brown muffin cap. This malt lovers paradise overindulges your taste buds with flavors of chocolate, coffee, and a nice roasted malt flavor. Definately a drink to have with a nice cigar, or steak dinner. Mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth, not too thick, but thick enough to get the flavor. This stout is worth every penny and I encourage every stout lover to pick up a six pack this winter, especially since its seasonal!!! enjoy"
"Overall a masterfully crafted sweet stout for certain. Not as robust as the flagship Kalamazoo Stout, but it definitely has more of a subtle presence that can't be denied. This baby is all about silky malty goodness with heaps of roasty chocolate over-under-and in-between tones. I don't drink this stout very often, but when I do its pure bliss."
"4/3.5/4/4/4"
"Huge thanks to kryptic for the trade!"
"Creamy and smooth, lower carbonation makes for a heavier finish. Lingers on the palate well. Simple and sweet but with nice roasty robustness as well. Well crafted and a very good representation of the style."
"This particular offering has turned me into a ""stout"" drinker."
"D - Pretty good, a nice cream stout, but tastes at lot more like a coffee stout."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling for the style, nice kick, good representation of style. This is a good stout that you can drink a few of whereas most stouts you would usually be done with after 1 or 2."
"Drinkability: This is a really good beer. I will be on the look out for this when I see again as it will make an excellent session beer."
"Okay, this is one of the best beers I have had all year long, and not surprisingly, another great Stout from Bell's. Found it at a random restaurant in Gastonia, NC of all places, I think it was $4 a bottle. Very opaque with a nice tan head that took a while to settle. If you like espresson, it's the smell and taste all the way in my opinion. The body even had the grainy qualities of coffee beans. Excellent in so many ways."
"Wow...Great beer. I feel like I should put that upfront. Pours a dark brown, lets just a few rays of light through to alter its color. Has a slight head that leaves a mild lacing around the beer. Aroma is of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and sweet cream. Taste is basically the same, but the sweet cream comes out in the finish of the beer to leave a sweet tang in the back of your throat. This is the first beer Ive rated a beer with a perfect 5 in Mouthfeel. Its amazing. After the first it just wants to make me drink another."
"Opaque black body lets in the faintest of brown hues when held to the light. Small brown head lasts for quite a while, leaving a good amount of lace. Big, sweet roasted malt scent. Taste is dominated by a nice amount of roasted malt, fair amount of hops involved. Medium bodied, fairly wet mouth. Quite a tasty treat."
"M/D: Creamy and thick, really nice mouthfeel and excellent drinkability. I went right through this one without hardly noticing. Out of the 3 Bell's Stouts (Cherry, Java, Double Cream) I think this is the best in terms of drinability, ranking just behind the Java overall."
"Pours a near-black color with some dark amber highlights at the bottom. Large, healthy looking tan head falls to a nice, creamy covering leaving the occasional string of lace on the glass. The aroma is a very chocolaty blend of roasted malts and a burnt-like sweetness. Dark, roasty flavor full of bittersweet chocolate and a creamy sweetness that perfectly compliments the creamy mouthfeel. Medium-plus body with very fine carbonation. Seems like a very ""complete"" sweet stout to me."
"This is another great stout from Bell's. Honestly, I don't know of another brewery that consistently delivers so many stout variations of such high quality. For that matter, I may not know of any other breweries doing this many different stouts period. If the label is right, and this is really 6.1%, then this becomes a quality session stout, perfect for the fall and winter months. I think this would be excellent served with a rich dessert, but it would also go great with oysters on the half-shell too. Would probably be great to cook with as well."
"I've had this before, but not since moving to NC. Bell's is starting to make its way out here more and more and I'm very happy for it. I recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the style or wants a sweet and hearty dessert beer from time to time."
"Pours black with a light brown hue with a chocolate milk head that dies to a thick ring. Laces nicely. Smells of roasted malt with notes of vanilla and coffee. Tasty with dark roasted malt. The coffee shows nicely and vanilla is slightly more than an afterthought. Smooth as silk in the mouth and not as bulky as an impy stout leading it to be very drinkable. A tasty brew."
"This beer is pitch black. There was a nice tan head the dissapeared quickly. a little lacing sticks to the glass. The smell is coffee and roasted grain. Taste is coffee, some chocolate and a bitterroot taste. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth with the abv being hidden well. The drinkabnility is good. This beer has held up just fine for nearly two years. A good brew that I would have again."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The brew is smooth as it goes down, great full body with appropriate levels of carbonation. It is an easy one to drink, perfect for those cool fall, or cold winter days, when you need something with body, or when its incredibly hot outside and you wish to drink something cold and refreshing(that is if you find a cold glass of milk-every now and then-refreshing). This is a beer I'd buy again, as a matter of fact, I'm thinking of buying a case of it."
"Taste presents a sharp, bitter mocha coffee note. It's not quite as sweet as other milk stouts I've had, but a smooth creaminess manifests itself in the mouthfeel and finish. This beer goes down easily and leaves you wanting more. I wish I had bought a six pack instead of a single bottle. Probably will someday. As always, good job Bell's."
"the mouthfeel was good, not as heavy as a RIS, but certainly bigger than a porter and respectable for a sweet stout for sure."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are above average. Very tasty Cream Stout, and another great beer from Bells."
"The mouthfeel is actually not too heavy... I would say medium, but it is very soft and slick in the mouth. Not as much flavor in any direction as I was expecting but very solid nonetheless."
"Flavor is full of mocha and cocoa. Slight hints of coffee and licorice as well. Full mouthfeel that just thickens as it warms too. slihgtly dry but not quite. Aftertaste is full of candies--chcolate, licorice and caramel. Kind of a creamy flavor too."
"This is not the most complex of stouts, but the more I try, the more I appreciate the subtle beauty found here. Easy to drink, and somehow, very refreshing (still a bit too thin in body, but @ 6.1% I won't complain so I can session this when released)."
"Poured into a pint glass at 19C(66F); great stout temperature! Ink black body with peanutbutter coloured head. Smell was big on lactose, chocolate, and burnt coffee. Rich and robust both in smell and in taste. About halfway through the swallow, the lactic sourness is quite easy to detect; a dry roasted cereal with burnt coffee soon follows. Mouthfeel is very average for the style, and to tell the truth, I really wish this were a bit heavier. Overall, however, this is a wonderful stout."
"This is definitely one of the better milk/ sweet stouts that I have had. The flavors were softer yet more distinct than the Kalamazoo. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and if you're a stout fan I suspect you will too. Recommended."
"Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, and YUM!!!"
"dark dark. coffe with cream colored humongous head that has great retention and superb lace. roasty malt, milk chocolate, coffee, and maybe some fruit in the nose. milk chocolate really comes to mind in the taste. it really has that milky sweetness. almost reminds me of super strong coffee with a lot of sugar and cream. not coffeeish like their java stout, but that roasty maly flavor with the sweetness and creaminess brings cafe to mind. very creamy and silky mouthfeel. what a real pleasure."
"Pours a dark opaque brown with a one-finger tan head that leaves billowy lacing as it fades. The aroma is very sweet, slightly milky, with some espresso and chocolate notes. I find the taste to be exceptional with front-end sweetness that thins out slowly to slight sourness and roasted coffe notes. The mouthfeel is very nice -- carbonation accents the brew nicely. A very nice effort from Bell's."
"Dull. Boring. Nice mouthfeel, but really a let down."
"Drinkability: This brew, while delicious, is too heavy to have several of. Very good one beer drink but I couldn't do more than maybe a couple."
"Here's a yummy stout that is black with some dark brown corners. The espresso-esque head formed quickly but faded too soon. The strong aroma is of patent malt and molasses. The flavor is more complex than the aroma. I taste lots of residual sugar to balance out the roasted malts. Some nice alcohol warmth blended in with a creamy mouthfeel make this feel great in my mouth. Overall, it's a good after dinner beer that would go well with a very rich fruit or chocolate dessert or by itself."
"D: Very drinkable, even with a higher abv. I went into the night liking Java Stout more but left favoring Double Cream."
"D: A pretty good Cream Stout all around. Damn, I wish Bell's was closer..."
"Very dark,opaque body with a small brown head.Taste are sweet malt,berry and dark fruits.Roasted malts there also.Nice lacing on my glass.Smells like roasted malts and chocolate with some berry.Creamy mouthful and some awesome hop flavor as well as aroma.Well brewed beer from a well made companey."
"Creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Full bodied with active carbonation. Don't be like me and fear the lacto. ""Double Cream"" means extra creamy here. Very good beer."
"12 oz. bottle, brewed with 10 different malts; batch 7733 - packaged on 11/21/07. It pours with a black body, light carbonation, and a finger of lightly-yellowed, tan head that retains a 3/4"" collar and a thin blanket of foam throughout, depositing bits of lace here and there. The bouquet is quite aromatic, yet subtle, revealing notes of chocolate, espresso, dark fruits, and hints of green hops. At times it gives the impression of Chambord-flavored milk chocolate and blackberry coffee - gotta love the smell of Bell's stouts. On the palate, there's espresso, dark chocolate, roasted/burnt malts, black/blueberries, and a latent creaminess. The body starts light, but quickly becomes heavier, with medium carbonation and a lactic smoothness that evens things out. Overall, another quality stout from Bell's, but I have a sneaking suspicion that if they made a straight-up cream stout, the result would be even better than this brew."
"D - This is another great Bell's product. One of the better milk/sweet stouts that I've had."
"Pours an opaque brown/black, no edges, thick tan head forms, nice lace spots, good retention, pretty ring around the glass. Smell is super malty, very complex, caramel, bread, roast chocolate and coffee, cream, very fragrant, smells kind of like fresh dairy, little bit oaky and vinous, like a chardonnay oak sweetness. Taste is sweet milk chocolate, roasty, caramel sweetness, lactic, creamy, chocolate goodness. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, very smooth, nice flavour, lactic sweetness cloys a bit though. Thanks for picking up Lexx!"
"Pours a complete opaque black with a nice two finger tan head that dies down to a nice lacing that sticks around quite well. Stickiness is spotty, but alright. Smell is heaven, wonderful milk chocolate, creamy caramel, mild espresso, toffee goodness...malt bomb to say the least. Good solid malt taste, just what I expected. Sweet caramel taste up front, smooth creamy chocolate milk taste to follow, then some roasted nut flavoring finishes it up, very complex. Mouthfeel is just about perfect, medium to full bodied with low carbonation, fits this style very well. To me, this falls just short to Kalamazoo Stout, but both are amazing representations of the Milk Stout style. Get your hands on this one for sure."
"The abv is high, but this is a very drinkable beer. You tend to sip stouts anyway and this one would be great for 3 and out the door. I would drink this one again. Would love to try it from a nitro tap!!!"
"Overall: I feel as though i didn't give this beer much respect so far. It really isn't a bad beer. I was expecting a little more in taste, but I am known to like over the top beers. I would drink another if given the chance, but will not actively seek it out. This may be a good gateway beer for those looking to cross the line into craft beer darkness."
"Overall, a very fine sweet stout. The roasted coffee balances well with the sweet notes."
"A relaxing and easy beer."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a 1/2"" tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has an incredibly smooth and creamy scent that boasts of chocolate malts and lactose. It's highly sweet; almost candy like. The taste is good. It has a nice malty bite with a sweet tone to it. It's loaded with chocolate and roasted barley. It goes down easy and finishes dry with a slight warming feel. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine cream stout. It's dry and earthy, but with a nice sweet touch."
"Drinkability: Really quite drinkable. No one flavor is too overpowering; they all mix nicely."
"Well worth it."
"Drinkability.... is good for those who like a nice rich stout.... my relatives didn't like it for the most part.... but then again.... they prefer bud lite!"
"This pours completely black, not a hint of color when held up to a light. It has a thin tan head that disappears quickly, but leaves a small bit of lace. The smell is on the bitter/toasted/roasted side, but there is enough sweetness to balance out the bitter in the mouth. There are hints of chocolate in the nose, but that doesn't come through in the taste. This feels thick/creamy on the tongue, I am surprised there is not more of a head given the mouthfeel. There is no hint of the actual alcohol level, this could be a 4% beer. I could drink this by the barrel, but I think the alcohol would catch up pretty quick. I think this is close to my ideal stout, not too dry or bitter, but with enough bite to balance out the sweeter malts. Highly recommended."
"D: Different than most milk stouts that I have sampled. Very astrigent and drying in a good way. Recommended."
"Yummy!"
"Overall good. I could see having a couple of these on a cold winter night."
"This is a beer that I would definetely NOT drink to get drunk. I coulnd't imagine downing more than three of them without getting full to the point of wanting to lie down. More so than anything, this one (like most cream stouts) is designed to be a treat for the palate."
"The mouth is exceedingly creamy, quite delicate and sweet, but not in a cloying, sugary sense. All the elments work really well together. It's very drinkable, and quite unlike any other stout I have had. Big ups to the Bell's boys."
"Easy to drink - alcohol well-covered. Can't say it's among the best I've had in this style, but a decent brew never-the-less."
"D- With no noticeable alcohol and a good mouthfeel I was surprised how not drawn to this beer I was. There is something missing for me. It is a quality brew, but I wish I could put my finger on what else I wanted in this."
"Good winter brew, drink em up before the summer heat comes on."
"Great feeling as you drink it, very creamy at first, but nothing syrupy that sticks with you after the swallow. Being medium bodied and not incredibly aggressive would make this a highly drinkable beer, sort of high in alcohol content, but you'd never notice, and that could be a problem if you're drinking a few..."
"This beer started off promising but left a weird taste in my mouth. It is thick, creamy with a solid head but has a pretty unnecessary aftertaste. It starts out creamy only to end bitter. Overall, it still isn't that bad of a beer in small quantities but the aftertaste becomes more noticeable the more you get through your bottle."
"Sorry Bell's, not your best."
"It's still a solid brew, but it could be great."
"D: Extremely pleasing to the palate. Complex flavors and aromas and a fantastic creamy texture that makes you come back for more."
"Pours a clean dark brown/black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tannish head, a few islands, but not much lacing at all. The nose is slightly roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. The taste is very nice of roasted malts, and mostly coffee, the finish is slightly dry. Alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body. Very drinkable, I really like this one, my first Double Cream Stout, if you can get your hands on some, do it. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is a very smooth stout. Not quite as creamy as I expected, but it's extremely drinkable. Alcohol is masked very well. Overall, very good beer. Definitely recommended."
"Poured very dark brown with nice dark tan foam. Really nice lacing. Aroma is predominantly chocolate with some roastiness. Taste is very chocolately with mild nuts and coffee. Very little roasted flavor. Not too sweet. Very little alcohol comes through. Nice balance. Mouthfeel is not quite as thick as I expected. Very drinkable as a dessert drink or nightcap."
"Overall, I was surprised. I've always been a fan of the Kalamazoo Stout, but this blows it out of the water. A great beer to just have around."
"D: One of the many great brews from Bell's. Absolutely worth trying. Whenever I'm in Michigan I make sure to pick up atleast one bottle of this."
"On tap at Taphouse on Queensway in Hampton. This is solidly black with a thin tan head. The aroma is whiskey-laced and smoky; the beer has a big stick-to-your-ribs consistency. As I drink I get more bourbon character, dark cherry fruit. Dont get the ""cream"" with this one, but this is an excellent stout. I had a couple. (#2743, 3/10/2007)"
"Mix of coffee and chocolate, sweet in the middle and finished dry, nutty aftertaste. The sourness of the aroma is still there, but blends in well with the other flavors. A bit creamy, makes drinking it a bit easy."
"Come back to IL, please!!"
"more years of cellaring. Too bad I don't have the space."
"This is an enjoyable stout. A bit different than I expected. It's sweet, but not overdone. I liked this one, and would drink another."
"I could go for another."
"D: Very drinkable. Having a few would not be a problem, until sweetness overload and a full belly set in. Alcohol was not evident. A nice way to warm up with some creamy goodness."
"Awesome double cream stout. Smooth and full-bodied. Rich with malty goodness. Nicely done and one of Bell's best!"
"Drinkability is good, the flavor on this isn't overwhelming to the senses, its an easy beer to drink. I'm not sure but I think the sweetness would start to get to me after a couple of these."
"D: A great beer for a cold winter night. I could drink far more of this beer than I honestly need. Probably one of the best stouts that I have ever had."
"Overall: Thanks HimerMan for this beer. Although it is not the best beer I have had from Bell's, it was pretty good. I would and will drink it again."
"Slainte!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer looks a dark brown-amber color on the pour but in the glass it looks black. The beer is accompanied by a dense creme-brown head that leaves large gobs of lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet with chocolate, slightly of coffee and very slightly of alcohol. Taste is similar to the nose but well balanced, very smooth and has a dry finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a creamy carbonation. This beer is pretty drinkable, I don't think I could drink a lot of these in one sitting but it would be good as a night cap."
"This was a good overall stout, the appearance was good, nice dark brown blackish color with a tan/white head. Had a nice sweet roasted smell with a slight hint in alcohol in the nose. I feel it had a nice taste overall, you can taste the sweetness from the cream and also the roasted coffee and chocalate, which a slight bitter coffee at the end. Mouth feel and drinkablility are good...maybe just a little too sweet but i would still bang a few back!!!"
"Overall: Nothing spectacular but a good offering from Bell's."
"One of the best stouts i've had in a while."
"This would be an extremely drinkable beer, except for a slightly astrident aftertaste."
"A very nice stout. Doesnt really seem like a sweet or milk stout since there really isnt much sweetness; mostly bitter chocolate and burnt malts. Light to medium bodied. Could be a bit biggeer, but still is very nice. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. This is a wonderful drinking beer. A six pack could easily go down tonight."
"D: Not bad, but I'll take a Mackeson's over this any day. Worth a try."
"Pours black in color with a small brown creamy head that falls to a halo of creamy foam very quickly. Very little lacing. Smell and taste are chocolate malt with a nice roasted burnt malt background and a finishing bitterness. The bitterness gives it some real bite at the end but also serves to hide the high ABV. Another solid brew from Bell's as expected."
"d: one of the best beers i've ever had, go get some if you can"
"Easy to drink with a lot to offer in the way of aroma and flavor. This may be one of those like-it-or-hate-it beers, and I like it. But then, I like all of Bell's stouts."
"The drinkability is very good. This stout is quite drinkable. I will buy more for sure. Prosit, MK"
"Poured beer into a tumble at 50 degrees. Noticed head not lasting long and what was there was very thin. Smell was burnt grain coffe like. Tast was pleasant and dark roasted coffee with peat taste intervening at the end. I thought it was a nice stout and yes it was creamy tasting even without the head."
"Overall, this is a great balance of sweet and bitter in a stout. The flavors are exploding all over my tastebuds like a fireworks display. It's the softest beer on the palate I've yet to have, like licking a Playmate's buttocks. Creaminess is kinda odd though and reminds me of sour milk. It all works wonderfully though."
"All the classic coffee/bitterness/roast of most stouts worth their salt are muted here by the ""double cream"" aspect (lactose?) of the stout. Alot of body, chocolate, and residual sweetness are what is left over, and frankly that makes a fine beer as ""comfort food."" Much stronger alcohol content compared to classic U.K. versions, and aside from cold nights where one more cozy beer will put me to bed, I would not reach for this beer very often. Since it is 27 degrees out right now, I am enjoying this quite well, and find reassurance in its rich cozy comfort. One will be enough though."
"This is another solid beer from Bell's. At only 7.5%, it just on the edge of being a ""double", and I think it lacks some of the sweetness and body that should be there in a cream stout. According to the name, it's not a great example. But as far as stouts go, I think it's quite tasty. Recommended... I'd buy it again."
"Don't be fooled by the name, this beer is a pretty standard above average stout if that's not an oxy moron. Not to say you shouldn't try it but it's not going to rock your world like I was hoping."
"With a 7.5 % abv this might not be a session beer but it sure would be fun to try to down a 6-pack."
"Cheers!"
"D - As my journey into beerdom continues, I'm falling more in love with Bell's and their collection of stouts. Wonderful winter nightcap!"
"I feel like I am drinking a Mackesons Milk Stout, and that is a good thing. I am going to have to drink these beer back to back to get my bearings because they seem almost the same...which is a good thing! Very smooth, nice and roasty. Chocolate, coffee, and nice cream flavor. VERY easy drinking, a regular in my stout line up."
"D: absolutely solid. I do not need to say anymore."
"WAY TO GO BELLS BREWING"
"conclusion: i generally prefer imperial stouts and things of the more bitter variety, but this is a great beer. I think i like it more than the average person on here, but I can't get enough of it and absolutely crave it when it is out of season. this beer will make your night better. it might not solve your problems, but it will certainly help you forget about them for a while."
"Pours black with a dark tan head. Smell is sweet with some burnt characters, hints of chocolate and coffee. A moderately strong alcohol smell. Taste is similar, yet very weak for a stout. The taste was somewhat underwhelming. The aftertaste is subtle with the burnt flavor showing up most. The mouthfeel was not very smooth and had a good deal of carbonation. I really wanted to enjoy this beer, but didn't find much to rave about. A decent stout, worth checking out especially if you are a fan of bell's."
"Would like to thank BigErn again for this brew. Served slightly chilled in a pint glass. Poured a very deep, dull black with a two-finger creamy tan head. Little head retention , but, left a generous amount of tan lace on my glass. Faint burnt rubber, creamy milk chocolate, and coffee bean nose. Nothing too overwhelming here. Tasted of freshly roasted ingredients , short blasts of espresso, with maybe a touch of alcohol. Very little carbonation. Has a somewhat thick almost milky feeling in the mouth. Didn't think it was anything spectacular , but it was pretty good."
"Drinkability gets high marks as I have just finished the beer and am wishing I had another at my disposal. This is quite a complex beer, perhaps having to do with the ten malts used, that takes a bit of dissecting. Pick one up and drink it slowly."
"The bottle shows the code ""7250", which corresponds to February 14, 2006, according to the Bell's website. It pours out black as midnight, and you can see the viscosity, with about half a finger of light brown head. It smells immediately of dark chocolate, with roasted coffee notes too. Upon tasting, you can tell that it's a double cream stout - with all the bitter chocolate/coffee flavors comes a milky, sugary aspect, so it tastes a bit like coffee loaded up with cream. The taste doesn't punch you out, though, and there's the taste nicely fades away before becoming overbearing. And it is smoo-ooth, with just enough carbonation. Pretty easy to put down, too, making this a good brew."
"Another excellent beer from Bell's that I could drink all night."
"Poured a very deep brown, almost black color with moderate tannish head. Smell is supremely enjoyable, being a nice mixture of choclate, coffee, roasted malt, dark rich fruits, and burnt smokey wood. Taste is also very enjoyable with nice chocolate and coffee flavors, combined with more dark fruitiness, and ending with a mild bitterness that beckons for another taste. So very easy to drink that I was suprised to see the alcohol conent. excellent beer. First class."
"A good stout slows down time. A great stout slows down time immeasurably so that you sit and stare mindfully off into the void for a long minute after the first gulp and take in what it has to offer. Kinda like watching a Regina Spektor video through your taste buds. After that it's sipping time and for me eating time so that I don't become tipsy or nod off for ten minutes and drown in the tub. Yeah, so there is lots of toastiness in this one along with the other general stout traits but for a citrusy bite in the dregs. A nice start to a weekend of sampling Bell's stouts."
"Eric"
"Smooth, creamy mouthfeel, a slightly better than average beer, pretty easy drinking."
"Drinkability: A very good milk stout but not a great one; a couple of demerits on the aroma and sour finish"
"Pretty drinkable, especially for a 7.5% ABV. I'd definitely do it again."
"I LOVE Bell's stouts!"
"DI like it. A solid stout and more would be welcomed"
"D: Awesome tasting, very smooth drinking beer."
"While it's not tops in many ways this is a very drinkable brew and an experience that's well worth repeating (as often as practical) Coming from the same brewery that makes Expedition Stout it's pretty clear that Bell's understands how to make very high quality stouts."
"D"
"A good dessert beer. Very full flavored and interesting."
"Overall it was less than expected from Bell's, it would take a special case the next time I try this one."
"Drinkability: This beer would be best enjoyed on a nice cool autumn day as opposed to the mid-70's we are enjoying in MI today. All and all, worth trying and I would definitely make a point of buying this when I get the chance."
"Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied with creamy, toasty coffee bitterness with some sweet chocolate notes coming through. Mildly carbonated and rich."
"Its very evident that this is a very well crafted beer, but it just isnt a flavor that resonates with me."
"Drinkability: Nice flavor, but might be too heavy to drink a lot of. The cream finish gives way to the more recognizable coffee notes of a stout. I can't help feeling that the heavy body might be more profitably matched with slightly heavier flavors (think Dogfish Head). A good beer, but one that could explode more in the mouth at the price."
"Drinkability: Yet another enjoyable offering from Bell's. If you love different types of roasted flavors, then this would be a must try! Something I could enjoy over and over again!"
"Tastes over-roasted coffee with a touch of cherry sour. Nice malty sweetness with a grassy hop carried on a faint alcohol breeze. Dry finish from the roast and cleansing carbonation, but a persistent dark malt/molasses on the back of the tongue. Warmer beer at the bottom of the glass, now. Has dark chocolate with a supporting toffee/caramel. Nice lactose character coupled to a dark fig. Thick mouthfeel and modest carbonation. Really an enjoyable beer."
"D: Yeah I could see myself drinking this again and again. However, when I had the drink it was a hot and humid day. While it was good I feel I would of enjoyed it more in the winter."
"This is a very drinkable beer."
"I Would recommend this to everyone."
"Mouthfeel - i drank the rye stout this evening as well, i prefer this one of the Rye."
"I'm glad this is on tap here."
"Drinks really easy for its abv. Pretty yummy take on the style"
"Big huge tan head floats on a creamy dark, almost black body. Great lacing after head dissipates. Smell is full of chocolate and roast with a light lactic sourness. Mouthfeel is bittersweet and dry as the Aticama during the rainy season. Coffee and mocha in the flavor along with a touch of cream and scones. Fruit flavors in the finish along with some sourness as it warms. Yummy. Pleasurable and quite drinkable. A bit light in the body."
"Smooth, not quite creamy (but close). Medium body leaning towards full. Decently chewy but not so thick as to be cloying. All in all, a darned good brew."
"Real nice offering from Bell's...easy drinking with this one."
"Overall: Pretty good, other beers I've had of this style are more sessionable where this one is more of a ""special occasion"" beer."
"This is an excellent dessert beer. Is it wrong for me to want to dunk Oreos in it? I look forward to having more of these in the future"
"overall, a very enjoyable sweet stout, can hardly tell the alcohol content is so high, i would recommend this one."
"One of the better stouts I've had, but not as good as the Kalamazoo. I like the hops, but on the other hand it lacks the true-to-form stout qualities. I'd have no problems drinking this again, but it's not my favorite."
"Another Bell's stout for the sampling. This one pours black with lighter brown highlights at the edges and a medium tan head that dissipates to a ring that leaves lace. The aroma is a bit underwhelming -- some roasted malts poke their way through the sweet/sour malts, but it doesn't add up to terribly much. I will say that it smells inviting, though, just the way a sweet stout should. The taste is considerably more complex. A sweet caramel flavor starts things off, followed by a slightly sour taste common in stouts with lactose added. The finish is sweet and sticky. Throughout, this stout glides over the tongue with grace in spite of its only-medium body. This beer is finely tuned and tasty -- an excellent version of a milk stout."
"This beer pours an inky, silky black color with slight brown around the edges. A small, carmel colored head forms, but quickly dissapates to a ring that leaves some lacing. The smell is not very apparent or strong, but it is pleasant none the less, sweet coffee, carmel, and chocolate tones. There are 10 different malts used in this beer so the taste is very complex. A lot of different sweet flavors, coffee, carmel, chocolate, etc., but not really any roasted flavor, all in all a very sweet stout. I also really liked the floral hop flavor in the after taste as well. This is a quite heavy beer though which definitly affects the drinkability. It almost reminded me of a bock with how sweet and deep the flavor was."
"Cheers."
"12 ounce bottle. Bell's Double Cream Stout pours out dark brown with a medium sized head. The aroma is grain with some creamy sweetness. There's some roastiness, but it's not as roasty as I expected. Sweet malty flavor. Sour oakiness. Maybe a bit of chocolate. Bitterness comes in just at the end, but this is mainly a sweet beer. The sour flavor is a little too strong. Medium mouthfeel. Drinkability is pretty good. There are some good flavors in this beer, but some off flavors too."
"dark. not really any head...lots of sticky looking lacing. almost opaque. chocolatey odor, some roasted malt odor too. quite tasty, burnt coffee at first, very toasty tasting. then i get some hops and sweetness, like sweet syrup. that's really what i take away most from this beer, a hoppy syrupy taste that i wasn't expecting at all. when i burp (as i often do), all i taste is tons of hops. mouthfeel was surpizingly thin and made me feel like i was drinking a porter instead of a milk stout (although i guess that's how Mackeson is too). doesn't really strike me as creamy in any way, just a nice coffee hop mix. a nice beer, but probably too expensive for me to drink regularly."
"Black with a thin head that appears light tan in color. Deep aroma highlighting decadent malts (chocolate, coffee, roast) along with a touch of cream for coffee and gingerbread. Rich and chewy malt flavor with notes of chocolate, coffee and brownies. Another very special Bells stout."
"M & D: Nice smooth taste. Slick going down. Not as heavy or coating as I thought it was going to be. Sweet aftertaste is very appealing. Drinkable dessert beer, but I wouldn't have more than 2. Definately a tasty offering from Bell's. Would have again if I can get it."
"Black with tan head. Loads of retention and lacing. This is followed by raw coffee and caramel aromas. Mix of flavors that are expected, some chocolate, bitter coffee, and some light floral hops. The problem was that it came off muddled and not the cream/milk stout flavor or smoothness that I expected. Not bad, just not great."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a nice creamy head with better then average retention. Aroma of subtle chocolate and coffee. Taste is less pronounced then expected with some sweet chocolate malt and a very subtle coffee touch. No bitterness to speak of but a nice creamy well carbonated body. The finish is a bit too watery for my taste. Good but may be a bit overrated in my mind."
"D - highly drinkalbe, easy to pound, but hard to chug, a great stout, even the girlfirend liked it, which has been a theme for Bell's so far, but then again i picked ones she would like."
"Besides the sourness the brew is almost too smooth. Very easy to drink despite the sour tannins. Makes this beer less than perfect."
"D - Hard to believe it is 7.5% alcohol. I never would have believed it, had I not read it here. It seems I could have drunk this all day long."
"Verdict: I can't understate the bulk of this brew. The mouthfeel is as good as it gets. It knocks some points off of drinkability, but I love a good, chewy stout. This one's solid, with reasonable complexity and a pleasingly sweet personality. It's not perfect, but stout lovers should seek it out."
"Drinkability: Exceedingly so. A lot going on, but everything is very compatible. ABV not too overwhelming, but pleasingly warming. Pleasurable experience."
"Pours a very dark copper-brown, almost pitch black, with a medium-sized, tan, pillowy, slowly diminishing head. Some light lacing. The smell is of nice big, woodsy, roasted malts. Chocolate, toffee and saltine cracker? Hey, whatever, it works for me. More dark roasted malts dominating the flavor. Coffee, bitter chocolate and brown sugar along with a slightly sour taste. It has a medium-full body, creamy texture and low carbonation. It was good and a little different. For Bells this is just an average beer, but Bells average beer beats many other brewers best beers. Pretty good."
"Mouthfeel- Very smooth to start but finishes a little and acidic."
"cheers..."
"Not as good as Expedition or Kalamazoo, but still another solid stout from Bell's. You can't go wrong with this one."
"It went astray in the taste department. Yes, it was heavy on the coffee flavors and sweet like a milk stout, but seemed a little thin , with burnt malt flavor seeming to take away from rather than adding too. Still a good stout, but price/taste means I can get better/cheaper. This was 2.50 for 12oz-- Maybe $7 for a 6 would be better."
"I Haven't had too many of this style. Seems to taste like most other stouts but a little creamier. I would revisit this one."
"The mouthfeel is rather thin for a beer of this size. I will keep drinking K-Zoo stout, Expedition, 7000 and quit complaining!"
"Thank you Larry for making it easy for me to be proud of my states beer!"
"Drinkability is okay. This one went down quick, but I imagine after 3 or so the flavor would get a little worn out. Definitly a good beer and one I would reccomend to any craft beer fan. Cheers!"
"Notes: If you like stouts then you'll like this one. Very solid, very drinkable big stout. Splitting a six pack of this on a cold winters day is good for the spirit. Trust me."
"Dark, black body with a thin tan colored head. Semi-thick motor oil consistency, with no lacing whatsoever. Average amount of carbonation. The smell is not strong at all, mostly of dark roasted malts with a hint of chocolate milkshake. Heavy bitter, roasted malt taste. Creamy, slick feel to this brew. Alcohol is hidden very well. This is a great dessert beer, but it leaves me with a heavy feel in the stomach. A decent offering from Bell's, one that I would try again. Recommended."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, batch 7186. Appearance is midnight black with a thin dark brown head that faded away quickly to light tan lacing. Aroma is sweet, chocolaty and malty, smells slightly milky as well. Taste is big, roasty malts well blended between a creamy sweetness and bitter chocolate flavors. Slight hopping present, mostly pine along with some citrus. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied, hides it's 7.5% abv quite nicely, hardly noticeable at all. Carbonation level is moderate, assists in thinning the beer out some, finishes with a slightly bitter aftertaste, refreshing. Easily drinkable, good complex malting, coats-the-throat smooth. Would purchase again."
"This brew pours an opaque black color. The haed is two-fingers in height, and tan in color, but recedes fairly quickly. The aroma is amazing. Chocolate, cream, cookie dough. The taste is great too. It is not huge, but it is flavorful. It is sweet and creamy, but with a nice bitterness that keeps it from being too sweet. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a really good brew."
"Not my favorite beer from Bells. This is a fairly bland stout that isnt necessarily bad, it just isnt very exciting. I expected much more sweetness, but I guess if I wanted that I should have grabed a K-zoo stout (oh, right that was all gone)."
"Thanks to Jennifer, Jason, Hanna and August."
" Taste is pretty mild. Flavor isn't lacking, it is just understated. Mellow roasted malt, hint of sweetness in the middle, and a bitter finish. Thick mouthfeel, with the right amount of CO2. Very drinkable, but not something I would want to drink all night."
"Wow! I hate to raise expectations on a beer based on price, but at $12 for a six pack it's just a natural thing to do. This beer pours the darkest of any I've ever seen. It's very smooth and very creamy, so the name does not disappoint. The coffee and black licorious smell are strong and amazing. Being from Cleveland this beer makes me think one thing, much like Lebron James this beer did not fail to deliver on it's hype!"
"I had been eyeing this for a while during my bi-annual trips to Minnesota and finally decided to splurge $12 for the six pack. I must say, just the name sounds delicious. Anyway, it poured like engine oil, and looks like it too. The head is small, but very cocoa colored. Awesome chocolate, coffee, and black licorice aromas. A tremendously thick and wholesome mouthfeel ensues. Wow! Tastes abound! Big coffee notes while silky smooth chocolatey flavors add definition. And there's just enough of a burnt edge to lend traction. It finishes dry and leaves the impression of just finishing a mocha expresso. There is a touch of sweetness in the back of the throat that just leaves you salivating for more! A showstopper!"
"very enjoyable on a cold night."
"Thanks to my man Hhawk06 for this sample. This beer pours a jet black color that looks very devious in nature yet delicious. It leaves a sudsy tan head that is clinging to my snifter. The smell is hoppy sweet chocolate, roasted nuts, creamed sugar, vanilla and herbal spices throughout. The taste is smooth, it has a bittery hop feel up front followed by a medicinal chocolate herbal taste on the palate finished with some nice malty chocolate creaminess. This is a smooth beer that coats the tongue and tickles it with dark chocolate malts dipped in a creamy milkiness."
"Overall, the prominence of the hops was a nice surprise in this beer. I'm used to cream stouts that are sweeter and more malt-centric, so it's a bit unusual in that sense but a nice drink all the same."
"10.16.13 bottle consumed 12.06.13 during a bell's six-pack roots revisit - 2 of 6 - richly roasted, smooth and creamy, a little coffee in the backend, mildly hopped, a little toffee sweetness, a fantastic stout, pervious scores kept"
"I won't seek it out again."
"The taste starts off a bit watery but the roasted malts come through quickly followed by a splash of chocolate milk and some dry hops. The finish is a little sweet with the chocolate/roasty flavors carrying through to the aftertaste. Full bodies with some residuals. I could have a couple more of these before moving on."
"Truly for the choco-freak or diabetes sufferer. Not a beer for the masses, but an interesting aside nonetheless. I could see non-beer people enjoying this one as a special treat."
"Bell's Special Double Cream Stout poured a deep black that would only allow light through a thin layer. The head poured out a definite brown and very thick but faded somewhat as the beer was drunk. There was adequate lacing on the glass. The smell was complex due to the multiple malts used in this beer; roasted notes and a subtle hint of chocolate dominated it. The taste was complex with the roasted malts dominating. The body of this beer was exceptional, thick, clean, and enjoyable. I would not say this beer is very drinkable as it is quite heavy and has a strong flavor. One or two of these is all I would want in a night."
"very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: Well frankly again, this one is just to dam sickeningly sweet. It has a hell of a full bodied buttery taste but way to sweet. Pass this one up and buy something else."
"I dont think i'd have this one again, unless it was offered to me for free. There's too many other stouts on my horizon to try."
"Drinkability -- If I can find anymore of this I'll be buying it. Very drinkable, but one should probably limit it because this is my first one and I can already feel a hint of a buzz. This brewery really has its stuff together. Absolutely brilliant!"
"Opinion: I really like this beer. I am not normally very big on really roasty beers, but this one is slick enough that it doesn't leave the palate all acidic and feeling like you just sucked on a piece of burnt wood. It is definitely one that I would try again."
"Pours black with a small tan head, little or no lacing. Smell is woody malts, vanilla, and milk chocolate. Taste continues with the woody caramel malts, vanilla and chocolate tones. Mouthfeel is incredibly rich and creamy, they weren't exaggerating about the double cream. So rich that I could maybe drink another, but one is probably enough. A unique and tasty sweet stout here, try it if you can find it."
"Not the first bell's stout i would seek out but a great milk/sweet stout"
"The mouthfeel is great. Very thick and creamy with a gentle and soft carbonation. One of the best American stouts I've yet tried. The ABV and intense roastiness prevent it from being more drinkable, but it is a very good beer. Another quality product from Bell's."
"I have recently acquired a real fondness for sweet stouts. This one is a treat. A basic oil black color and texture. Bittersweet chocolate dominates the nose and flavor. Slight sourness and bitterness helps the sweet malts (lactose). Black malts, roasted malts, and barley malts combine to reveal molassas, caramel, and a slight grain bittering. Creamy and silky, it's like chocolate milk for the beerlover's sour."
"Finally a competitor with Old Rasputin for world's best double cream stout. This beer is fantastic. It's very rich and bittersweet, but not over-the-top. I think most of us could handle a couple of these at once and be fine. There's a lot to experience in this glass, make sure it has your full attention."
"Black, light ruby highlights, with a mocha coloured, thin head. Fair retention and lacing. Lactose sweetness in the aroma, chocolatey and malty, light alcohol and moderate roasted character. Full body with low carbonation. Silky smooth texture, a bit milky. Balance is on the malty side, lactose, low roasted flavour but the roast barley contributes to dryness at the finish. Low bitterness and just a bit of milk chocolate. Very light alcohol warmth. Pretty good stout overall, quite enjoyable."
"pours out like motor oil...thick dark tan head with staying power. thick rings of lace. aroma of those boxed chocolates so popular at valentines day and around x-mas. tastes of intermingled dark and milk chocolate. tart notes of candied cherries. rum cake. molasses. currants, raisins and dates. a whole lot of yeasty goodness. liquid lusciousness in a bottle. voluptuous body, velvety mouthfeel. double creamy indeed. finishes sweet and then roasty dry. highly drinkable for a stout of this magnitude. yummy stuff."
"Jet black in colour with a small off white head. The aroma is dominated by sweet chocolate (think chocolate chips), with more subtle notes of espresso, roasted malt, and a fruit element that I cant quite identify (perhaps plum?). Upon drinking, the chocolate becomes a little less sweet, and takes on more of a powedered cocoa flavor. Theres also a bit of a yeasty note with a bit of leafy hop bitterness at the end. The sweetness is a little less than I expected, but well within stylistic guidelines. I had hoped for a bit more body too, but again, its not as if its thin. I tend to want sweet stouts to completely bowl me over with sweetness and thick mouthfeel. I found this one to be a bit on the tame side, but still a quality beer."
"smelled wthen it's warm - rich aroma of mocha and a mix of sweet sugar and tosted grain, mouthfeeel is a bit on the thin side at first and follows with a dry finish."
"Dark brown pour with minimal head. Smell is very inviting. Smells like a sweet chocolate milkshake with some coffee thrown in for kicks. Alcohol is there behind everything if you look. Roastiness is very subdued. The taste is very similar. Creamy (per the name) slickness dominates in the mouthfeel. Could use a tiny bit more carbonation in my opinion. Taste is extremely milky and chocolaty all the way until you swallow, then the roastiness comes through in the finish. It is accompanied by a very lactic character as well, which eventually wins over the roasted malt with its sourness. This is a little unpleasant. With a little more roasted character, this could have been a real winner. It's no Kalamazoo Stout though."
"If you see this, buy it and give it a try!"
"And for as complex and strong as it is, this is one stout that goes down smooth as silk."
"Pours a jet black color with a large and frothy tan head that leaves nice lacing down the glass, a beautiful stout. The aroma is very creamy, like whole milk and sugar, with chocolate and coffee undertones and a cloying sweetness. The taste is very interesting and sort of goes all over the place. You get hints of cocoa, coffee, whole milk, molasses and a mild roasted bitterness. Probably one of the best milk stout's i've had, the alcohol is hidden well and the mouthfeel is extremely creamy and incredibly smooth. This isnt really a beer you could call a session beer, but it's not hard to drink by any means. This is my first beer from Kalamazoo but it's quite impressive, and thanks to NeroFiddled for the beer."
"black body with a nice tan head.. pours rather thick and murky into a wine glass. scent is heavy on wood and vanilla, nothing too offensive or overpowering. taste mildly reflects the wooden oak aroma and brings out a true roasted nutty flavor along with some fudge notes. tart finish sneaks up on you, more than likely a bit of freshness in a beer that might need a couple months to sit. a decent beer but surprisingly light on the 'sweet and creamy' for style."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, full and creamy. Washes over my tongue like silk and gently slides down the throat. I find it intensly enjoyable. I regret that I only have one bottle of this fine brew. I will be hunting down a sixer as soon as possible. I recommend this one to any fans of the style as it kicks a large amount of ass. Bell's has impressed me yet again."
" Re-reviewed on 4-28-05, and well worth doing so. Better score for appearance this time around, as the head revealed some some rusty orange hues in addition to the garnet tints noted in my earlier experience. Aroma score gets bumped up a notch for complexities I missed in my first review. Some smokiness and vanilla notes add to the multiple malt notes to be found in this interesting stout. Mouthfeel, as well, is worthy of an update. Velvety smooth on the palate, and quite exquisite. Ten different malts are used in this one, according to the label, and the adventurous complexity is well worth revisiting. Very tasty, and a very nice stout to sip and savor. One of Bell's better offerings, for sure, and that's quite a compliment."
"An excellent beer. Very dark, deep roasted flavors for a cream stout, but the correct characteristics were still there. There was a little bit of a numbing effect from the 7.5% abv, but otherwise the alcohol was perfectly hidden. I hope that I can get my hands on more of this stuff."
"Rich and creamy smooth to drink, the body is a little thin, but, again, it doesn't detract that much from a really enjoyable, easy drinking experience. I could drink some more of these, especially in cool weather. Very nice."
"Pours out a black concoction with a two-inch, beige head. Seen from the top for a moment, the glass almost looked like a chocolate milkshake. Nice brown lace. Smells quite sweet, like coffee with lots of creamer. Chocolate malts make their presence known on the second whiff. Tastes very sweet, roasty, but not too sweet; as I've disliked this with the other milk stouts. It could be all the roasted malts, or even a background hoppiness that helps keep the sweetness under control. Mouthfeel is my only gripe; it's a little thinner than I want for a beer of this stature. However, since the beer isn't cloyingly sweet and I find I enjoy its balance of bittersweetness, it regains in this area."
"Pours very black with 2 fingers of foamy brown head. Just the slightest red tint near the bottom of the glass, although light does not pass through the main body of the beer. Sticky lacing and good head retention. Aroma of chocolate and coffee with cream in it, a malty mix with some good roastiness. Very full and well rounded taste. Bell's claims to use 10 different malts, and although I can't pick them all out, the blending is apparent. Sweet chocolate mixed with slightly bitter coffee blends well with a slight cream taste, with a roasted flavor throughout. A little sweet fruit is apparent near the beginning, and the faintest of citrous hops makes a showing near the finish. Finish is sweet and creamy with a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is big and smooth. Bell's is very good at stouts, and this is no exception. This was the beer that got me into craft beer, and its a pleasure to have it again after quite awhile."
"Wow.. pours a deep black color with a tan head that lingers and leaves great lacing. Aroma is slightly musty? Taste is of cream and coffee... wonderfully playing off each other and together. Thick and lush as well. I like this and wish I had more. Note-- This has been cellared for a good 6 months.. YMMV."
"All in all an excellent cream stout. I'll have no problem finishing the 6 pack I bought.."
"A fine stout, I wouldn't mind a bit bigger body, but still plenty good. Another thanks is owed to Feloniousmonk for this."
"overall, really great. i had this beer a year or two ago, and it was not so good. in fact, i thought it was bad. then i heard someone rave about it, and gave it another try. really good stuff, glad i am re-introduced. thank you, bell's. i love you."
"The beer has a fairly complex taste with bits of dark chocolate, black patent malt, and a mild sweetness that's reminiscent of milk and a hint of something else, possibly cherries. Overall, a very good beer. I think this bottle is at least a year old but am not sure as there are no dates on this bottle."
"A ""special"" stout indeed."
"This is milk stout. Some milky taste that stirs up a feeling of coffee and cream. Low hops profile. The body is somewhat thick but in more of a dairy sense than an oily sense. Quite sweet and dairy like. I can't really perceive any carbonation on my tongue. This is not a repulsive brew by any stretch of the imagination, but I would most likely not try this again. This style seems to lack the things I love about stouts. The milk factor seems to really dull things out. Namely the bitterness and roasted feeling of stout brews. Bell's has much finer drinks available in my opinion."
"D- This is a very pleasant yet complex stout. It has a lot of flavor packed in that bottle but no characteristic is over powering. I would like to see a bit more chewiness in the mouthfeel but definitely a leader in this category."
"Pours out to a dark coffee color, with a dark brown foamy head that held it's own and stuck around for quite a while. Not much of a scent to note, but odors of coffee and dark chocolate were present. Label states that smoothness is from the 10 different malts used in the brewing process, and I will give them that, this brew is smooth. Overtones of chocolate, malt, sweetness are prevailant, with a touch of a mellow bitterness aftertaste. Very creamy mouthfeel, but I must admit that this brew was far too heavy for my taste. It made me feel like I had a friggin' brick in my stomach. Maybe good with a steak or burger, but overall, was too rich for me. None the less a decent brew, worthy of a try if you are looking for a good example of a smooth stout."
"This is a great stout. Certainly something that couldn't be had every day, but I would say that once in a while this is a fine treat."
"Overall I am highly impressed."
"Prosit!"
"Not quite as oily, inky dark as Expedition, but plenty dark nonetheless. Capped by a solid, medium-sized, dark khaki head. Bell's stouts always look great to me. Aroma consists of sweetish roasted malt, with a hint of sweet cream, and light metal coffee thermos. Roasty, peaty, and bitter coffee up front. Roasted notes swell along with oak, and a creamy, lacto sweetness. Finish is dry, acidic, coffee and bitter, with smoky, roasted sweetness hanging around. Very nice. Full-bodied, creamy feel. Another absolute winner from Bell's."
"Velvety black gloominess in the pour, with a tan/light brown two finger head that leaves brilliant lacing down the sides of the glass. Impressive appearance. The smell is almost entirely malts with a faint whiff of chocolate. The flavor is sweet and roasted malts, with assorted dark chocolates. Oily and silky-smooth mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. Unquestionably drinkable with the great flavor and mouthfeel."
"This is an adult milk shake. Rich and creamy body loaded with chocolate flavor. This is a favorite December night cap for me."
"785"
"Dark brown color with just a hint of mahogany highlights. Not very much head to speak of. What did exist was a light brown color. Just a touch of lace clung to the side of the glass as I drank the beer. The nose is dominated by roast malt. There was just a touch of chocolate on the nose that came through with the malt. The taste is deep roasted, chocolaty malt. A little bit of figs and perhaps ribbon candy shows on the finish. This has a little more alcohol in the flavor profile than I expected. It doesnt hurt the beer, just cuts through some of the malt. The hops dont really show (thats not a complaint. It works in this beer). The velvety mouth feel I expected after having a few of the other Bell beers. I often cant drink many stouts, but this is a very drinkable beer. Great beer. Clearly one of the best stouts available."
"Bashiba, Bashiba, Bashiba... you always hook me up."
"Drinkability is great on this fantastic beer from bells. A nice heavy stout that still leaves you wanting another."
"Pours viscously out of the bottle, a tarry black brew topped with a light head that looks like chocolate milk. Sweet malt aromas mixed with creamy chocolate, coffe, dates and caramel. Taste is similar but amplified with a definate plum-like characteristic, very creamy, lots of bittersweet chocolate, and toffe. Very rich mouthfeel, oily, perfect carbonation. You definately will want to avoid the last 1/2 inch, very thick and gooey. Can I age this?"
"Consumed with a Greeek chicken salad from Little Daddy's -- a perfect pairing."
"This beer pours a black color with a small head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is great. There is a ton of creamyness in there, almost a marshmellow in hot chocolate smell. I like it. The flavor is really good on this one too. The chocolate is huge, but it is mellowed with a creamy marshmellow flavor that adds a ton to the experience. There is a nice bite on the back of my tonge as well. Woo hoo. Me likey. The feel is nice and thick. Drinkability is good on this as well. Overall this is a damn nice beer."
"I've been waiting for this case for over a month, and it finally came! It pured black with a nice tan head that left a slight lacing in the glass. There was no chance of light getting through this one! The smell was of roasted coffee and chocolate. The taste was smooth creamy to begin, with flavors of coffee and chocolate finishing it out. The mouthfeel was excellent, very creamy. This was a very, VERY drinkable beer. Another great beer from Kalamazoo!"
"pours black, small tan head with a little lacing.aroma, sweet, malts, chocolate, coffee. flavor malt chocolate,hints of toffee taste.Has a nice bitter sweet finish with a nice alcohol taste. just the way I like it. another good beer from bells.a very drink able beer"
"Pours as black as coffee and makes a nice tan head. Aromatics are dense of rich roasted coffee beans and chocolate. Flavor is quite large, with more roasted malt character, coffee and chocolate in the blender making me a mocha surprise. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky on the palate. This is a nice drinkable stout... its really similar to a homebrew porter that I made, so I am stoked!!!"
"Pours out an opaque black with a tall brown head that almost overflowed. The head sticks around for the majority of the brew leaving rings of clumpy lace around the glass. Damn it seems bells really knows how to make their stouts look really damn tasty. Scents of dark chocolate, cream and roasted malt combine to form a very pleasant aroma. Roasted malt starts off the taste before giving way to bittersweet dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The after taste is a creamy roasted lingering one. Body is about medium with a creamy feel to it. Very drinkable and tasty stuff here, this went great with some dark chocolate."
"12 ounce bottle. The sourness had a lactic flavor and may have indicated a sanitation issue. Still a drinkable brew."
"Medium/heavy in body. Creamy smooth start with a long dry and tingling roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate finish. Very nicely drinkable and extremely enjoyable. Too bad the pour didn't look better."
"I like this beer over all, but it is a bit sweet and the sweetness sticks with you for a while. That is the only thing that really turned me off about this beer. I like their Kzoo Stout better."
"Overall I'd have expected more sweetness in the brew, but the body is sufficiently weighty to wrestle the roast that is such a large character in the palate."
"Poured dark, opaque brown with a thick foamy brown head that, unfortunately didn't last too long. Smell was roasted malt with hints of honey and fruit. Taste initially was strong burnt malt.. maybe a bit too burnt... but, more complex flavors then emerged. Slightly sweet, notes of raisins and plums, followed by more earthy and woody flavors. Alcohol flavor emerges as the beer warms. Finish was dry and maybe a little astringent. Full-bodied mouthfeel with a light carbonation. A pretty tasty stout."
"Pours opaquely dark chocolate brown with a short light brown head. Butterscotchy and roasty malt aromas, peaty, earthy and lactic smelling. Some toffee, molasses, coffee and chocolate maltiness is rounded well with a creamy mouthfeel, its texture is luxurious. Further roasted grain flavors linger throughout the drinking experience. The lactic acid is pretty well hidden under the complexity of the malt. 10 different kinds of malts... Wow."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a thick 1/2"" light brown head above a dark, dark brown/black brew. Long-lasting head that laced excellently. Aroma is sweetly of dark malts, perhaps to a fault, with no balancing bitterness seemling present at all. Taste follows the nose, with sweetness dominant, to a fault, and ends up with a tinge of bitterness, but almost too little, too late. Mouthfeel is nowhere near as smooth as one would expect from a cream stout, kind of disappointing, and drinkability is a bit better, but one could certainly find a more desirable lot from Bell's stable."
"A wicked tasty brew, but like most Bell's beers that I've tried it's far too oxidized and kills what would otherwise be an devastatingly delicious twist on the style."
"A Double Creamy Thanks to FM for supplying this one to Long Beach. Very Nice Indeed!"
"Final Thought: Wow, Kalamazoo Brewing Co. may be the best one out there! Great tasty stout!"
"Pours a deep black chocolate brown-black. There is no light coming through this baby. Nice creamy beige-brown head that sits at about 1/4 inch when reduced. Thick lacing. Nice coffee and toffee flavoring. Toasted and roasted. You taste more chocolate as it warms up. The flavor that lingers on is one of mostly coffee. Thick, rich, full bodied, nice and lightly creamy. A very good tasty brew."
"Beer is good. Happy dark beering."
"Nice chocolate malt aroma with a light coffee undertone. Dark walnut colored head pours nice and thick. Head fades slowly to a thick film resting on the deep black beer. Soft, smooth mouthfeel in a solid bodied beer. Chocolate, roasted malt, and cream combine for a nice flavor. It finished mildly bitter, just enough to make you want another sip. Cellar temperature serving highly recommended."
"Probably my favorite Bells thus far. Thanks feloniousmonk!"
"Had again 2.5 years later and in perspective it is very good, but not as overwhelmed as initially."
"Deep brown colored beer, with a big gingerbread colored head, with moderate retention. Smells of coffee, chocolate, cream, and very sweet. taste is deeply saturated with roasted malt, lots of them. Bittersweet chocolate, and agood-sized hops finish. This is a big beer. No sessioning here, this is dessert all the way."
"A strong, bold stout, with a smooth and creamy body. Great carbonation, and a big, full bodied presence. This is no weakling's beer. Good drinking, but I fear the bitterness may catch up with me; good for a stout session."
"Mocha aroma, distinct but not heavy, small head, strong but mellow cream coffee taste, almost like a cappacino, like a fine malted Starbucks concoction, and just as expensive as one. Wonderful brew. One of my favorite new beers and the third Bell's brew I've had in the last month, that I'm very impressed with.."
"Drinkability: Again, just ok. Beers like this let the taste dictate their drinkability. There's nothing wrong with it, maybe a little heavy in the gut afterwards, but it goes down easy and is satisfying. I just think I'd keep myself to one a night, or a year. Try it, at least it's different."
"Very dark black beer with a foamy brown head. As the head faded it left a dark tan lacing all the way down the sides of the glass. It smelled of lots of roasted malt with a hint of chocolate. There was a well balanced roasted malt flavor with slight bitterness. The mouthfeel was light and creamy smooth. A very enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"12 oz bottle, no dating. Black as night, dark tan head, tiny bubble head melts down to a film, lots o' lace. Nose is of sweet fruit, vanilla and burnt malt in background. Lucious mouthfeel, this a sweet nectar of the stout gods. Notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, biscuits and roasted malts. As the bottle advertizes this one boasts a soft roasty finish. More fine stuff from Bells, I wish my wife brought a case of this stuff home instead of a sixer!"
"Thanks to sakaroo for the sample."
"seriously black in color with slight ruby highlights when held to the light. creamy full tan head of foam that subsides for the most part, but still manages to stick around. aromas of roasted oats and a dariy-like sweet cream aroma. interesting. rich and full bodied, lightly carbonated. nice roasted barley in the beginning followed by a big dollop of sweetness. the sweetness is pronounced, but not cloying in any way. finishes with more of a long burnt flavor and just a touch of leafy flavor. i don't have much experience with sweet stouts, but this one seems pretty solid. one was enough for me, however, the sweetness did sort of get to me in the end. worth a shot for sure though."
"Bell's Special Double Cream Stout is another good beer from a very good brewery. It's a step or two down from Expedition Stout in terms of intensity. As a result, it seems more drinkable."
"A truly fine, big beer, whose only ""minus"" would be limited drinkability (well, that and the price: $11.99 per 6). I can't imagine downing more than two or three of these in an evening - but that would be a most pleasant winter evening indeed!"
"Drinkability is okay, it's a great brew but it's heavy, thick and I have a hard time drinking multiple roasted brews like this one."
"Man, I can drink this all day long! Flavorful and rich, but not too heavy. A tremendous stout from a great brewery. Seek this one out."
"No bottling date. My first beer from this brewer. Poured dark as dark as a black cat in a dark room at midnight. Topped with a small tan head. Rich and complex aroma of reminds me of chocolate butter creams. The taste is delightful and very rich. Roasted nuts, bittersweet chocolates and coffee. This beer would match perfectly with a rich chocolate dessert, or raspberry cheesecake. No bitterness detected and the alcohol just manages to show itself towards the end of the glass, when the beer finally warms up a bit. Its well hidden otherwise. A beautifully rich and potent beer."
"Pours a dark, nearly black liquid, with a wonderful dark tan creamy frothy head. The head on this beer alone was one of the most appealing I have ever seen. This beer smells of dark roasted coffee beans, nearly burnt. The taste is somewhat sweet with a hint of almost burnt coffee. This is very smooth and creamy. This is a pretty drinkable beer. I feel fortunate to have been able to have this on draft, as I know the bottles can be somewhat expensive, and well, we know the track record for Bell's bottles. If you are a stout lover, this is certainly worth a try."
"Overall, this is an interesting second take on Kazoo Stout. It basically takes a very solid year around, and then polishes it up a little, trading the heavier roasted edge of the standard for a creamier, smoother flavour. I like them both."
"The carbonation is soft and the body is thick. This is a very tasty stout and I am glad to get a bottle of it. Give it a shot if you see it!"
"As I opened this beer, my wife said, ""Oooohh! Pretty label!"" Even with a rather agressive pour, this beer poured very flat but did manage to build about a half inch of frothy head. This has been pretty typical of the beer I've tried from Bell. This beer is dark, no light was getting through. The head was tan and faded fast but hung around the edge like wall flowers. The nose was very subtle with chocolate malt tones. The taste was a little thin, not what I was expecting. The flavor was mild as well but then again, a lot of stouts don't really explode with flavor. This beer is very mellow and demands that you take your time with it. It finishes nice with a bit of a mocha flavor and more chocolate. I probably would've rated this beer a bit higher if it were a bit more active from the pour and I'd like to taste it a little more chewy."
"Light, flash-in-the-pan phead the fades to a ring of foam around the edges but stirs up easily with a small swirl. Chocolate and char on the nose. The flavor has an odd dry powdery flavor (can't quite describe it actually), that seems to intertwine itself with the chocolate malt flavors to give the impression of a mouthfull of cocoa powder. A bit milky in the flavor. I really imagined a stout called Double Cream to be a bit thicker, but it's not exactly thin. Definitely improves as it warms."
"Anyone figure out that label? Dark chestnut color with a light brown fine-bubbled head. Oily lacing hangs around the inside of the glass. An inch high head slowly recedes, but leaves darker brown caps of foam rising out of a few spots. When held to the light, reddish-brown particles are seen suspended. Aroma of cocoa and faint hops, perhaps a hint of raisin. Rich flavor of sweet cocoa, bitter chocolate, tart cherry, piney hops, raisin and espresso. Some molasses, but not an overly roasted malt character. Chalky residual feel around the mouth, with some definite tingling from the combination of hops and bitter chocolate and coffee. Has almost an imperial feel to it."
"Thanks to JahNoth for the trade."
"It looks deep, dark black; as you'd think a rich stout would. The head was small but lingering. The taste was indeed exceptional (5). This has all the fullness and flavor of the Java stout but is toned down just a bit and isn't overpowered by roasty-coffee flavors. This is what I had hoped the Java stout would have been. Glad I found it. To quote the governator: ""I'll be back""."
" It is creamy smooth, but it doesn't really seem to have carbonation. Maybe this bottle is a bit off, but I will try it again soon. The flavor is not as intense as I thought it would be. It is sweet at the start with some chocolate and caramel flavors leading the way. Roasty notes come in a bit later to finish you off before a nice dry aftertaste filled with toasty flavor. The mouthfeel is pretty good, creamy, but I am not sure if this one is supposed to have more carbonation. It is pretty good, but this one will be edited if I have a better sample."
"This poured dark dark chocolate-y brown with a small, creamy, tan head. It smells good of espresso and slightly burned caramel. The taste is good. It's smooth and full with a sweet coffee taste. The mouthfeel is quite creamy as expected but not too think. This is an easy drinking stout. Another good beer from Bell's!"
"The taste is very nice, needless to say very malty, but very well balanced, and it bears repeating, exceptionally smooth. The flavors here run the gamut of malts: chocolate, espresso, rye bread, and a bit of toast, with a pleasant taste of buttered rum. The hop flavor is subdued, but rises to the task to help clear the palate toward the end. This is really terrific."
"This beer pours a deep brown, almost a black, color. It forms a thick brown head when swirled in my glass. The aroma is of a buttery roast malt. The butter seems to dominate the aroma. The butter component is in the taste as well. This beer is creamy in consistency. It has definite roast character as well, though befitting a cream stout, it is a soft roast flavor. The stout is fairly thick bodied, with notes of coffee and chocolate. The butter flavor seems to dissipate with time, though I could just be getting used to it. I am not sure if the butter character is supposed to be here (my guess is that it is not), but it is no so strong that it horribly detracts from this beer. It even helps to boost the perceived fullness of this beer. Though in the end this beer would be much better without the butter component."
"Sakaroo was kind enough to provide me with this very interesting Bell's offering (my first). When you see him, give him beer! He's a wonderful human being and a true BA!"
"Pours black color with a nice creamy brown head that leaves good lacing in my glass, roasty malty aromas. Taste like bitter sweet chocolate and rich coffee, full bodied with a thick and creamy mouthfeel, finishes with a mild sweetness, alcohol is very well hidden, very drinkable and dangerous, this is a beautiful stout."
"Appearance: Midnight black with caramel brown notes edging through on the edges when held to the light nice full tan head leaves thick collar of lacing continues the same pattern throughout the session. Aroma: An airy sweet cream scent with hints of wood chips slipping through, dark chocolate and coffee notes round out the scent. Taste: Deliciously creamy just awesome mouth full of whipped cream blended with chocolate what a dessert beer, very rich with some bitterness coming through from the dark roasted malts bringing chocolate and coffee to the table maginficant. Mouthfeel: Full bodied cream stout just a big brew when it comes down to it, nice even sturdy carbonation. Drinkability: These would ware on you but it would also blend so well with vanilla ice cream as a topping, awesome well done tip my hat to the brewer's at Bell's great stuff."
"Another solid Bell's offering. A nice mix of sweetness and bitterness that keeps both in the forefront. A good stout, and absolutely one I'd have again."
"Double cream stout is everything the title conjures up. A sweet, dark brown stout. Good head with espresso flavors. As it warms there's a hint of root beer. It's a lot better warm than cold. Great with a meal. Another fine offering from the folks at Bell's!"
"The head on the pour looks like a black and white milk shake. Very thick and airy. Lasting as well.. Black opeque color and look in the pint glass. Roasty bitter cocoa nose with a touch of sweetness in the sinus. A little light upfront on the mouth then the finish has a touch of cream on the tongue. Dry cocoa and black malt intial taste then the finsh is of metalic (tin) sweetness. Wish it tasted how it looks... not bad though..."
"This pours well with a thick cocoa head that stayed nearly the whole glass. Has a sweet/chocolate flavor, almost a mild (dark) flavor of chocolate covered cherries. It's a medium bodied, with a finish of medium roast coffee flavor. I enjoy K-zoos dark beers and their lighter ones are only so-so for me.. It must be the common wateror hops in the recipe they use."
"Pitch black with a tinge of dark caramel at the edges. Head is small and dense. Aroma is of strong black coffee and charred malts. On the dry side and medium bodied but smooth. Flavor is strong bitter coffee. Not as sweet as I'd like. Overall pretty good though"
"Overall, a good stout."
"Overall this, as with most of Bell's, is one that shouldn't be missed. It's a big beer with the drinkability of a session beer. It's a complex beer that I could give to a Bud drinker. It's not going to be a beer that you'll remember as the greatest you ever tasted, it'll be the one that you stock you fridge with in the winter and look forward to in the summer."
"Overall, this was a really well-designed beer whose taste outshines its aroma. Initially, I didnt care too much for the smell but I grew to appreciate it more with each sip and smell. Special Double Cream Stout has a carefully hidden alcohol content that can waylay the unprepared. A delicious, well-crafted stout. Glad I packed one home with me."
"A bit much to handle, great to ponder one, hard to stomach more, the ten different malts used create a multitude smells and flavors. An interesting and a well-made stout."
"Purchased Nov., 2002 at the brewery. Cellared since as experience has taught me I like this one with about a year of age on it."
"Poured a dark black color with almost no head. Carbonation was lackin a bit. Nice ring of lacing though stayed the whole time. Lots of malt in the smell, mainly chocolate/coffee mix and some vanilla. The taste was not what I expected but it was still good. Not really sweet at all. Bittersweet chocolate was there. The main flavor seemed to be coffee. Tart fruit was also apparent. It seemed like there was a solid hop presence also. The body was a little on the thin side, but all in all a good beer."
"Definitely the most bitter tasting sweet stout I can remember. Almost like Shakespeare or other examples of micro-stouts. I thouroughly enjoyed this one, although it was different than what I expected. No Mackeson's or Young's luxury here. Hops are quite evident, but the finish is not overly dry. Nice appearance, smooth mouthfeel. This is an excellent stout."
"The beer pours a midnight black color with a monstrous light chocolate head that creamy in its consistency and the left over lace a fine satiny sheet to meld with the glass. Rich chocolate malt sweet nose, coffee, roasted grain and just a treasure to sniff, front is ambrosial, full and rich as is the full bodied top. Finish is bittersweet, mildly acidic, bone dry and a real pleasing beer."
"Well integrated, this isn't bad at all. There seems to be a good deal of Crystal (caramel) malt in this brew and yet it doesn't go the way of brown ales (raisiny and, in my opinion, quite poor). It even picks up a good amount of esters either from the yeast or the hops. Not much of a sit-back beer, but perhaps a nice one with a meal (went very well with my fettucine and eggplant parmesan) or over a smoke."
"Drinkability: Yes! Yes! Oh, God, Yes! Oh so good.. I want more..."
"The mouthfeel was very good, being both full and creamy with a bit of a dry finish. There was even some hints of strong hopping, ala Storm King, as the brew finished. Very nice, indeed."
"F"
"Bell's probably has one of the greatest catalogs of good stouts of any microbrew in America, and this is my favorite Bell's Stout. It has a very strong toasty, chocolate-laced coffee flavor to it. I find it to be sweeter than Kalamazoo Stout and it has a lingering mouthfeel. I suspect Bell's sells more Kzoo Stout, but this one is far more enjoyable due to the rich flavor and the molasses-like mounthfeel."
"Bittersweet chocolate is big in the flavor. Its like you have to chew your way through the coffee-icecream head to get to the more chocolaty beer. The Bell's yeast character is big in this beer just like all of the other Bell's I have had, and it gets a tad tiring for me to be honest. I never thought I would say this, but I might like this beer better if it were filtered. It would be more drinkable that way. But a great beer nonetheless."
"Taste: This has a lactic (duh, it's a double cream stout) flavor. it's sort of an inbetween stout, not sweet, not dry. it doesn't quite do it for me. This is one of those beers that many will like, but I happen not to."
"Virtually black beer pours with a perfect 2-finger dark tan head that fills my pint glass. After 5 minutes, the head has actually crowned above the top of the glass and begins to take on a rocky appearance. A small amount of sediment can be seen floating in the beer. Dark particles can be seen in the foam at this point. The aroma of sweet roasted malt is noticeable from two feet away. Up close, the sweetness is much stronger, with nice raisin and chocolate notes. With a small amount of trepidation, I contemplate taking a sip. This beer has been so wonderful to experience thus far that I'm afraid to tarnish the experience (considering K'zoo's recent quality issues). The taste is much more mellow than I expected! Sweet fruity notes up front are accented by a light cherry flavor, but quickly lead to a stronger chocolate and roasted malt taste. There is ample bitterness in the finish to offset the sweetness, and then coffee and dark, bitter chocolate sweep in for the lingering aftertaste. No graininess, no earthy overtones, no tartness (all the things I've come to fear in a Bell's beer). The mouthfeel is creamy, but not overly thick. The active carbonation maintains a thick head for the entire glass, but it doesn't force itself upon the tongue. The drinkability is phenomenal, as this goes down almost as easily as a Guinness draught with about twice the alcohol and a very enjoyable sensory experience. Looks good, smells good, tastes good, feels good, drinks good. This is one of the better beers from K'zoo."
"I could actually smell this beer as it sat in the glass two feet away. Quite concentrated in both aroma and flavor. Sort of an imperial version of a sweet stout. Very dense flavor - maple syrup and brown sugar with some lighter chocolate and coffee notes. For all the sweetness, however, it was not at all cloying. Seems to be a style all of its own."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a dark brown, almost black, with 2 fingers of reddish-tan head. There is a fair amount of sticky lace left down the sides of the glass. The smell has a bit of roasted malt and chocolate, fairly sweet smelling. The taste hits hard with roasted coffee and caramel, then the sweeter malts come out toward the finish. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, almost chewy in the mouth. The drinkability is just fair for the 7.5% alcohol. A nice sweet treat!"
"This is a very good beer, but it's just a little sweet and chocolatey for me. Cheers to feloniousmonk!"
"This brew had a very strong coffee and chocolate aroma. It poured with no head and a very dark black opaque body. It actually had a very mild coffee taste with an otherwise OK flavor. There was no after bite which allowed it to go down very smoothly."
"Oh a nice creamy milk chocolate aroma with a hint of caramel. A milk like consistency with a roasted malt back flavor. A chocolate roast flavor dominates. Creamy, sweet, malt flavor and a nutty flavor builds at the back of the mouth. Coffee flavors intensify with each sip as well. It feels a little syrupy at the end, which would not make this a beer you could drink a lot of. It's a dark black beer with a tan head, the thick head lasts throughout. Some yeast residue rests on the top of the head, looks like cinnamon on a cafe mocha. Would make a great dessert beer."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for this one. This beer pours a very dark color with a small head and moderate lacing on the glass. It smells sweet and has a creamy, marshmallow, and chocolate thing going on. The taste was all chocolate and marshmallows. This is definitely deserving of the name stout. Super thick mouthfeel and very smooth. Great brew here."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for this bottle!"
"Pretty darn drinkable, but at 7.5% I don't know how many I could handle before I lose the capacity to enjoy, 3 at most."
"Pours black with a light brown head that leaves excellent lacing when sipped down. The aroma is chocolatey, roasty with coffee notes. The flavor is of burnt roasted malts, coffee, and a burnt roast bitterness. It is a full-bodied beer; very enjoyable."
"Pours very dark with a little tan head. Considering the lack of head, the aroma is very impressive. Chocolate, coffee, and cough syrup. Very interesting. It was better when served very cold. When I resampled at a warmer temp, the flavor got a little too jarring. Tastes as it smells except with a big roasted bitterness finish. I'd drink this again for sure. Very flavorful -- almost too much so because you almost begin to lose any subtleties that might be in there."
"Nose has that trademark Bells scent....sourish, but also some good chocolate mixed into it as well....the best thing about this beer is its body and mouthfeel...very creamy, smooth, and thick....feels like a good stout but the taste is only OK...some nice sweet cocoa...also some fruitiness like cherries probably from the yeast....that tartness is a little out of place in this beer but not unbearable...this is jet black in color and has a nice tan lace on top....has a real tartness on the long finish....a good beer, but the more of their stouts I drink, the more I find that sourness out of place..."
"This is one smooth and yummy stout! Nice black color with dark brown highlights, large tannish head that really faded fast leading to just some small bubbles along the edge. Nice aroma of roasted malt and sweet hops with a chocolate tone and vanilla notes. Super smooth taste of well balanced roasted barley, sweet chocolate and hops, with a hint of vanilla. Well done. It reminded me of a warm chocolate shake with out the thickness. Good medium stout body, sort of heavy but the smoothness really keeps it from getting any heavier. Nice sweet vanilla tang in the mouth at the finish with hints of roasty a chocolate sweetness. Very drinkalbe stout! Ranks up there with Mackeson xxx for one of my tops. Recommendation is high."
"Poured a jet black with a nice amount of head. Aroma was of coffee with a subtle chocolate undertones. Something was seriously off with this beers flavor with some metallicy, sour taste in there. Coffee and chocolate struggled to overcome the off flavor. I would love to try another bottle, but unfortunately it is not really an option."
"Aroma is chocolate with a bit of fruit, quite good really. Pour was muddy black, with very little head (there was almost 3 1/2 inches of head space, could account for fairly low carbonation). Roasted malt leads with bittering hops fading away. Chocolate, just a bit on the sweet side, but not nearly as sweet as I expected."
"NB: Tasted the Kalamazoo, which was thinner, more heavily carbonated, less complex, and less satisfying (but hoppier). I can't see choosing it instead, unless the 1% ABV difference matters. Checked with Bell's, who confirmed that there is NO lactose OR oats; but some flaked barley for a creamy, grainy element."
"Fully dark in color, a deep, deep black, and a sturdy cocoa-y brown head. Aroma is rich and roasty, toasty, but still rather light. Perhaps that's where the cream comes in, I'd guess, though it's on the subtle side. Mouthfeel gets a great initial hop blitz , that mellows soon after., but not before giving off blasts of cherryish sweetness. Slight bitterness continues with every swallow, but is ultimately subsided. All in all, a very tasty, unique stout, soothing and delicious."
"Being a new fan of Kalamazoo stout, I looked forward to this Double Cream Stout. It's very similar in appearance to the Kalamazoo. Double cream means just that, extra creamy. And that's how the mouthfeel is. It's very smooth chocolate, coffee, slight hops, and sweetness. I'm strongly impressed. It has amazing drinkability and a perfect roasty flavor. I was surprised to see that the ABV is 7.5%.....no hint of that whatsoever, just smooth roasty greatness."
"Pours a deep dark brown, with a rich malty backbone which is coupled with a subtle creaminess. An excellent stout in my book. Strong malt yet smooth. Trademark Kalamazoo mouthfeel,body, etc. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys kalamazoo products, or stouts in general."
"L=4.5, A=4.5, T=4.5, MF=4.0, D=4.0"
"This beer poured a very dark, almost black color and formed huge medium tan bubby head much like a Guiness, leaving some nice lace. An aroma of malt, coffee and chocolate. A flavor of malt, coffee and dark chocolate. A slight burnt aspect to the finish. Another November Stout down, only 4 more to go(I think). Hopefully some of these will see longer rotation."
"Big nose of chocolate ice cream drizzled with caramel and espresso beans, a dash of roasted pecans and shaved chocolate. Starts off like one of those iced coffee drinks you get at the mall, but made with a double shot of French roast rather than some puny house blend. Roastiness gathers some steam on a frizzy carbonation, peaks, then slowly tapers off as a smooth malt back and a few traces of hop make an appearance. A nice beer that should probably accompany food, perhaps a bit too stout on its own."
"Absolutely opaque black in color... I couldn't find any highlights even when held directly to the light. A really creamy dark tan head holds quite well but eventually drops to a thin surface covering and very nice collar. The aroma is surprisingly complex with notes of sweet milk chocolate, creamy coffee, light cocoa, mild buttery biscuits, dark baker's chocolate and the very ""burnt"" roastiness of rich and oily coffee beans. Quite inviting, and engaging as well! The body is medium/full with a fine carbonation that foams up in the mouth giving it an even fuller mouthfeel. The flavor is equally impressive and just as complex as the aroma with notes of dark fruit (and apples) and sweet chocolate up-front, even sweeter creamy cocoa and caramel as it warms, a rising solid bitterness and deep roastiness as it enters the swallow with a touch of alcohol, followed by a dry finish that's loaded with lingering bitterness, dry coffee-like roastiness, and a light touch of mildy tart dark fruitiness. Quite rich and exciting! Well worth seeking out."
"A black pour with hints of red at the edges and a thin bronze head. Even when well chilled, this stout has a substantial nose. Initial notes are sweet and creamy then more typified by alcohol dryness and some roasted notes. The taste is quite unique among the stouts I have had. Like the smell, it starts out rather sweet. Roasted grains and some dryness then join the party. This beer's creamy texture gives it a slightly clingy mouthfeel but also adds to its drinkability."
"There is something missing. It's rich and tastey, but possibly lacking complexity. Yet, it is still somehow intriguing and worth trying."
"Dark brown body bordering on black. Clarity is irrelevant. Big and dense tan head with great staying power. Lots of soapy lacing. Aroma has roasted malt, bitter chocolate, subtle fruitiness, and hints of sesame seed oil and metallics. Flavor is rich and full, with some roasted malts, dark and bitter chocolate, sesame seed oil, and toasted malts. Barely a hint of lactose, but more of a well controlled sweetness. Passing suggestion of smoke shows up here and there. The metallic hint in the aroma shows up on the dry and bitter finish. Full bodied, with a creamy and oily mouthfeel. Absolutely stellar stout from the stout king."
"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. This is an excellent Stout, which I understand is par for the course with Bell's. I can't wait to try the entire line! Pours black as night with a thin bone-white head and good lacing. Great smooth creamy flavor that I could enjoy all night."
"Black and opaque... with a decent tan head. Aroma of roasted barley, coffee, chocolate, and some dried fruit. Flavor is somewhat astringent, with coffee and chocolate flavors... some sweetness, and dried fruit flavors. Medium to full body, with low to medium carbonation. Very smooth as it warms. Another well done stout from Kalamazoo."
"Uniform, one fingered persistent dark tan head covers a virtually black brew. Trace hazy deep ruby when held to light. Sweet milk chocolate hits the nose at first, then is ensued by notes of buttery malt and deep caramel. Understated roasted barley adds a hint of coffee sharpness, but the aroma is sweet, mellow and inviting all around. A combination of roasted grain and hop bitterness in flavor immediately yields to a rounded, mild lactose sweetness and chocolate malt, which in turn is ceded by dark caramelized malt sweetness. Hints of tart fruity esters from Bell's yeast strain are subdued by the rich overall malt profile, but emerge as a pleasant mid palate undertone. Moderately bodied, w/ a firm, dextrinous mouthfeel conducive for excellent drinkability. Finishes w/ fading sweetness which allows the dark fruity tartness to linger pleasantly on the palate. Double Cream Stout is a delicious, unique and deceivingly smooth stout. Subtle, yet rich."
"What's up with the label on the bottle?  Embarrassingly bad."
"This beer is ink black.  A thin brown head recedes to an edging rather quickly.  Nice belgian lacing.  Huge mix of toffee, vanilla bean, coffee, mocha and dark fruits on the nose.  The taste is a combination of bittersweet chocolate (slight), lactic sourness, alcohol and dark plum and cherry like fruits.  Nice combination.  Body is about medium-full.  Just another in the long line of outstanding stouts from K-zoo.  I can't believe I didn't review this one already."
"Thick pour but a good head for a Kalamazoo Stout. One quarter inch of compact suds.  Completely black with zero light transmission.  Deep vinagery and cherry-like aromas.  Powerful flavor for a Milk Stout, coffee, slight chocolate, and slighty fruity one/two punch that brightens to the aftertaste.  Bitterness is slighly mellowed by some vanilla.  A little astringency keeps things interesting.  We have a pretty big beer here for style.  Was looking for a little more delicacy, but then, Kalamazoo is not known for that.  ""Chocolate milk"" yeasties on the bottom of the glass.  Nice, but pretty similar to other Bell's Stouts."
"Normally, I am not a sweet beer person.  This however, is very good.  It combines the roasted malt/coffee taste with a sweetness that seems to blend in so well.  If there is a brewery that makes a better lineup of stouts than Bell's, I've yet to see it.  Some may have better individual stouts, but the whole line they offer (11 stouts) are very, very good."
