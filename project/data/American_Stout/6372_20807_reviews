"Very disappointing. Lacked depth. Almost no chocolate flavor."
"This thing is mostly a dud."
""

"Flavor died off in second.  Really disappointed."

"Pours a clear deep brown with bright ruby highlights, producing 1.5  fingers of deep tan, shortlived, frothy head that leaves a thin wash of lacing. Aroma is dark chocolate, coco,  roasted malt, toffee & a hint of roasted nuts. Taste is Tootsie Roll & bittersweet chocolate, roast, pepper & a little char or smoke. Finishes dry with a kick of peppery spice. Aftertaste is dry & drawing, lightly bitter coco, toffee & roast nuts with a hint of char. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, creamy but prickly, a little chewy, dry & drawing."

"Overall:  This is a tasty stout, but due to the lack of chocolate flavor in a “chocolate” stout, it’s a little disappointing.  If this beer had been labeled just a regular stout or oatmeal stout, it would be a really good stout, but as a “chocolate” stout, it’s not that great.  Disappointing."
"It is Very thin, champagne like"

"First beer that I had from Fort Collins and I thought it lacked flavor, the taste was bitter and it was over carbonated"
"Pours dark with a small white head.  Faint chocolate smell.  Has chocolate taste but not that strong.  Somewhat creamy."
"Light but flavorful.  Was expecting a heavier taste and feel."
"Drinks more like a bock than a stout. Not much chocolate to speak of."

"Looks good. Smells hoppy. Tastes Hoppy. Very little sweetness and even less chocolate. While the beer was not too bad, its not what I expect from this style. I wanted a desert beer for turkey day, this doesn't cut it. Fiancee is bringing me Sam Smith's Organic Chocolate Stout n I'll be happy and thankful."

"This brewery does a decent chocolate stout, though it's not at the top of my list.  Tends to be a little more expensive too for some reason.  But it's worth a shot if you find it."

"Meh. No aroma or flavor. Who cares what it looks like and/or feels like when drunk."

"Tastes closer to a black IPA than a chocolate stout.  It'd get a significantly higher rating as a black IPA, IMO."

"The Fort Collins Brewery Chocolate Stout -----3.5/5"
""
""
""

"Body is less than I'd expect for a chocolate stout. Thin, more like a brown ale, lingering mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolate flavored finish."

"Ugh. So not that long ago, I'm pounding Coors Light, Keystone, High Life, whatever. Then, ALL OF THE SUDDEN, the people I drink with decide we can do better and I'm drinking stouts, porters, imperial whatevers, double chocolate somethings, and who knows what. Now, I'm all like, ""this chocolate stout is too thin. Waaa."" Tell you what, if you like beer, but aren't a total snob about it, then this beer will do you fine. But if you obsess about ""mouthfeel"" and ""lacing"" and ""who cares, Doug, let's just get wasted already!""....sorry that one doesn't apply....this beer will disappoint you. Not much body to it, kind of seems like they took a Heineken and threw a couple Hershey's Kisses in the wort. Ok, not a Heinie, that was mean, but you get my drift. Expected better, not thoroughly pissed about it."
"EDIT: It's becoming more watery as I drink it. Time to drop the scores some."
""
""
""
"A decent brew that could use a bit more umph. Still pretty good, just a tad watery. I like the drinkability though"

"So, the local convenience store near my office put in a few taps and started selling growlers. I picked up this brew to give it a try. It is a dark, opaque brown color with a tan head. It smells like a dry beer...some chocolate, but also lots of roast. Nutty and full. The taste is dry with some malt and a creamy mouthfeel. Solid."

"I probably wouldn't recommend this beer. The appearance and flavor weren't interesting and at 5.3% AbV, neither was the buzz."
""
""
""
""
""
"The dryness factors into the feel as well, after an initial smoothness gives way to it. There's a little crispness to it, perhaps just a touch too much, though the smoothness never really dies off."
""
""
""
""
"Pours to a thin tan head that leaves very little lace and ust hangs around as a tiny ring edging the glass. Color is dark brown-black. Aroma is sweet malt, caramel and coffee, not really chocolatey like many of these chocolate stouts are. Flavor is mild and semi-sweet, much like a good, easy drinking brewpub American style stout. Mild hop bitterness, with sweetness relying on roasted grains for balance. Mouthfeel is smooth and on light side for style. Overall, a stout that I really like, although it looks rather limp and the smell is not strong and chocolaty as I would prefer."

"Fort Collins Chocolate Stout pours a midnight black hue, with only a thin ring of tan foam sitting on top. The aroma is fantastic, giving of scents of coffee, creamy milk chocolate, a slight smokiness, and a hint of citrus esters as well. The flavor is pretty nice , with a fair balance of the creamy chocolate and coffee, and the aforementioned smoked and hoppy characteristics. Not overly complex but that's perfectly alright. Very soft feel and a thin finish unfortunately. Overall though, it's pretty flavorful for a low ABV Stout."
""
""
""
""
"Nice dark color. smoky smell and taste. Nice finish. Just the right beer by a fire on a winter day. No complaints, will buy again which is one of my best compliments. I rate this very good. I can barely taste chocolate, smoke flavor is just the right amount."

"Poured into becker pint glass; black/brown with a thick fluffy tan head that leaves tons of lacing and fades about halfway before sticking. Smell is sweet malt, chocolate and a bit of coffee. Taste is smooth malt, semi-sweet chocolate with a hint of coffee. Barely any bitterness at all, very smooth mouthfeel. Not a standout, but a fine stout."
"Pours dark black, tan foam, mostly settles. Light chocolate malt with hints of coffee. Coffee bitter taste. Very bitter. Light carbonation. Chocolate aftertaste. Pretty good stout, not earth shattering. But I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
"The appearance is a dark heavy rich chocolate stout with a frothy 1"" head. Poured smooth into a glass to enjoy. While the appearance was very dark and heavy, the mouth feel was smooth and light. I could definitely smell and taste the chocolate (heavy). But it was pretty carbonated for a chocolate stout. I would recommend this to someone who is trying to break into the chocolate stout world as it probably would be a brew that isn't too heavy for the newbie."

"Overall – A rather nice stout with a good chocolate and roasted malt flavor which still maintains a rather easy drinking character."

"This beer pours up a deep black with ruby highlights a nice one finger caramel colored head, decent retention, and a healthy bit of lacing. Nose is chocolate, roasted nuts, and coffee, very nice. Taset is sweet up front with notes of malt and cola. Finish is chocolate, coffee, caramel, and nuts. Mouthfeel is very pleasant. Loved this one."
""
"The taste is rather uneventful, thin in taste and feel and a touch watery. Roast coffee, dry powdered chocolate and burnt, smoky embers touch the tongue but never really grab you. I feel like there's more to be done here, perhaps an Imperial style to really impress but this is somewhat disappointing."

"Pours a dark brown with a little bit of light passage, short tan head, significant lacing. Nose is heavily roasted with mild waves of coffee and cocoa. Taste has an astringent chocolate bitterness with bits of sweetness scattered in. Overall a dry flavor with plenty of roast. Mouthfeel is thin and highly carbonated."

"This one happens to be available year round in my area and has become a staple in my beer cabinet. Maybe I'm a little biased on it but I certainly think it deserves a higher rating then I see here. I think it is close to excellent for a chocolate stout. Maybe it is downrated a bit since it has a relatively low ABV for a stout and that's OK, just means I can drink more of them before I fall down..."
"Overall: Pretty much the definition of average for me. Not bad at all but nothing mind blowing here. Grab it if you need an easy stout fix"

""
""
"O: ive had this one in the fridge for about 8 months now, given the style i dont think thats too big of a sin but this is not the best beer in the world to say the least, there are many more beers out there of this style that are much easier to get and much more well rounded, appearance was the best part of this brew, the rest was downhill"

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours dark brown with a miniscule tan head that dissipates quickly. There are aromas of dark roasted barley malts, chocolate, coffee, and some hops. The taste follows the nose. There are dark roasted malts, bitter coffee, bitter chocolate, and bitter hops. It has that charred malt characteristic in the flavor. The carbonation helps chase the bitter aftertaste from the mouth. The body is light with plentiful carbonation. The drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a good beer that is worth a try."
"This has a nice aroma and even nicer taste. The hops and chocolate mesh well and also balance it out."
""
""
""
"Overall an ok beer. There isn't a lot of complexity with the flavor and it sits a little light. I'm usually a fan of stouts but this one is a little disappointing."
""
""
""
"o - not bad but nothing to go chase after either. definitely adds another dimension to the style though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from The Wine Seller in A2. Pours dark brown with a small light brown/cream colored head. Smells like chocolate, a little roast, but taste is lacking. Mouthfeel is too light and watered down for the style. Much like chocolate flavored water, not much else going on beyond that to describe here. Fort Collins tends to underwhelm as a whole with some OK and some not, and this one missed in my book."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the richness to the malts. These were, however, hard to find at times. They come strong at the start, and give great flavoring, char and roast, but by the end everything is washed with thinness and water, diluting the original strength. Additionally, the coloring is nice, and the head and bubbles upon swirling produced an attractive beer, but the follow through on the sip and the feel fell a little short for us."
"Overall, it's just an average sort of stout. They don't use actual chocolate, just chocolate malt. It's kind of a rip off to call it a chocolate stout when they only the malts (which is pretty standard for a stout malt bill anyway) and not chocolate...especially when it's pretty weak too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Lighter than some of its counterparts, which is nice because sometimes you might want a chocolate stout without an insane ABV and richness/sweetness. A nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a good beer, but not a great one. No one element stuck out, but still very drinkable."

"Overall, this is a decent chocolate stout, though I prefer their doubled version of it."

"A good drinking beer from a pint glass, this is better for social occasions and would easily mix well with bar food. Check the brewery’s website for their great Chocolate Stout chili recipe."
""
"Overall I wasn't too impressed with this beer and I thought that it was a pretty average American Stout. This beer was called a Chocolate Stout, but I don't think there was enough chocolate presence to make this stick out from just a regular American Stout. This beer went down smooth but the flavor didn't really hold my interest so I don't think I would want another one. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it looked pretty proper for an American Stout. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of chocolate taste and the watery mouthfeel, if those were fixed this beer wouldn't be half bad. I wouldn't buy this beer again and wouldn't recommend it, their are much better Chocolate Stouts to be found. This beer really didn't do it for me and it didn't make for a good first impression for this brewery, I would like to have a couple more beers from them before I fully form an opinion on this brewery, but after having this beer I won't be in a hurry to try their other beers, hopefully they are better then this one, better luck next time guys."

"Acquired this out of curiosity..didnt curiosity kill the cat? Anyway, poured a half finger head with okay reception. Hints of chocolate and roasted malts which gave away the taste quite easily. Yepp, taste it similar to smell but has a suprisingly good but plain finish. Not sure if thats a good or bad thing? The creamy texture sticks to the palate but probably to the ribs as well. Overall this is an okay stout. Not a lip smacker but was worth a try."
"Overall- Disappointing, I was hoping for more with this one. It reminded me of a black lager than a stout. Needs more chocolate to be called chocolate stout."
""
""
""
""
"I had high hopes for this one after the aroma, but the flavor was only so, so and the mouthfeel was a real bummer. Surely not up to par with many of the chocolate stouts that are out there."
""
""
"Feel = medium to full bodied and smooth, not thick or creamy."
""
"Overall I would say this beer is better than average, it is quite drinkable with some subtle enjoyable qualities."
"Reviewed on: 02-13-2011 21:46:09"
"Overall - I'm a bit dissapointed with this one - there are some decent flavors here, but its all watered down. The light mouthfeel and higher carb accentuate this, cleaning the palate of any flavors that may have tried to linger. Better than a macro, but not by very much."
"Mediocre. Sorry FCB. Pains me to say it."
"O - A pleasant chocolate stout."
"Overall a slightly below average beer. Aroma is good but everything else is lacking. Wouldn't recommend"
""
""
""
"O - It's a well balance stout that I'd consider this a session stout. Just a no frills good drink. One that won't fill ya up because it's so heavy but also won't knock you on the ground with a high abv."
"Definitely worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I would drink this stout again.. and again."
"Overall: This is a very drinkable and affordable chocolate stout. Definitely recommended and probably my favorite Fort Collins beer"
""
"Overall, I enjoy this beer. I liked the combination of the sweet chocolatey malts and the roasted malts make for a great overall flavor. Easy to drink and full of flavor."
"opaque dark brown pour with a mocha head getting live and leaving a good trace of lacing, milky chocolatey mocha and cocoa notes hitting the nose with the same on the palate, some malty grain offsetting some full bodied chocolate flavor very well carbonated and solid go-to if you dig stouts...actually enjoy it better than the older brother..2x chocolate"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a decent chocolate stout. an average stout though."
""
""
"Definitely would buy this again. It might be one of my favorite beers from Fort Collins Brewery."
""
""
"O: Overall this is a good example of a straight forward, no frills, chococlate stout. At 5.3% it would make a good session beer if you wanted something dark and sweet."
"Carbonation is high on this guy. It bites the tongue upon sipping and helps the mineral taste make the beginning of the sip less pleasant than it could be. Once the bite from this 1-2 punch passes its a lot more drinkable, but it's too thin."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent chocolate stout. I prefer a stronger one, like the Souther Tier Choklat or Rogue Double Chocolate. Again, there are so many outrageous ones out there that we tend to downplay the simpler ones. This is to the point."
"My bartender buddy, Moe, used to say that I took my coffee like my women - hot & black and the sooner the better. Ah, yes. This beer poured fast and back and gave some serious mocha head before moving on to more important things, like the nose. It smelled like Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate and I was thinking of several special treats that I might like from a chocolate stout. Color was a dense deep-brown, not black, but what actually is solid black other than carbon? Mouthfeel was, indeed, velvety smooth, like Marvin Gaye on the turntable. Let's get it on! The lacing was thick and sticky and I was licking my moustache like the flavor saver it had become. The taste was of liquid dark chocolate, no sweet nonsense here. Man, this was cacao being ladled out by one of Montazuma's girls and I was lapping it up like it was going out of style! Finish left me spent and sleepy. Hey, who's going to clean up that mess?!? The sticky lacing left behind in the glass, I mean. I think that I may be compelled to buy a certain young lady a drink come Sunday. Yo, ya feel me?"

"O. A good brew."
"O: Not a worthy entry into one of my favorite beer styles."
"pours a creamy dark brown color with a subtle tan head. smells bitter like raw unrefined dark chocolate and even some bittering hops (unusual for the style?) taste is more dark malts than chocolate, not sweet in any way. like semisweet chocolate chips in the finish, slightly thin in the body for what i look for in a stout, but one of the better fort collins brews i have tried. very drinkable and has some potentially exciting cullinary applications. worthy of a try if you can get your hands on it, but dont expect a chocolate knockout. this is a sessionable dry type stout with just a touch of the cocoa."
"O: A decent beer that I did enjoy, will be happy to have again, but not anything to write home about."
"O: An enjoyable stout. It's not the best, and it's not the most memorable, but I still really enjoyed it. So I can't complain."
"Poured out into a pint glass and was surprised not to see much of a head considering the style. it also didn't have much of an aroma to it. The aroma i did get was like sticking my nose in a fresh bag of toasted malt. Caramel flavor and a hint of dark chocolate are the flavor notes i get from this one. Hops are well balance and stay in the background to provide just a touch of bitterness. I like this beer and might have to pick it up again very soon."
"Picked up with a pick your own six pack. Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Pours inky black with little head. Notes of roasted malt with little in way of chocolate. A good American stout but not one that I would seek out, there are a lot of other stouts out there that I like better."
"Not a bad stout, but there's nothing to separate this one from the pack. It's simple and pleasing, but hardly profound."
"Pours a really nice dark-chocolate black with brown coming through on the edges. A nice creamy, chunky mocha head dissipates just a little, leaving a layer of creamy froth on top all the way down. Leaves great sticky lacing. Tastes of burnt chocolate, roasted malt bitterness, and maybe a touch of oatmeal. Definitely a lot of chalky semi-sweet chocolate in here. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly dry, very sessionable. This really does remind me more of an oatmeal stout, with a nice sort of hearty creaminess in the body. A good beer in my opinion for those times when you just want to try something new. Nothing groundbreaking here, just a good solid stout."
"Poured into a snifter I am met with a black brew with a nice beige head that dissolves quickly and leaves a ring around the glass. The smell has a lot of chocolate going for it with some leather and cocoa also. The taste is filled with dark chocolate, tobacco and roasted malts. Bitter finish. The added hops really distract from the overall beer and create some harshness when I don't feel it's needed. Overall for the style it's not bad but with the RIS all the craze, this American Stout is just average."
"The mouthfeel is way too thin for what is expected these days in a stout. I must admit, I may be influenced by the vast array of awesome stouts and imperial stouts available today. This one borders on simple, but may appeal to some."
"M - Medium body, light carbonation."
"O- A tasty well crafted brew at a great price point. Recommended."
" Not much of a scent/nose to it, malty if anything. taste is a tad more french roast coffee than chocolate and a touch too bitter."
"O: I was left hoping for some more chocolate in this beer. The roasted malts are too predominant. The watery flavor couple with the aforementioned smell left me a bit disappointed."
"Overall, this is average at best. Just too thin, overly roasted, and kind of bland for a stout. Pass..."
"O-Dissapointing, was expecting a lot from this beer, may have been okay if I wasn't expecting Chocolate from a ""Chocolate Stout."""
"Overall, it was good quality and drinkable. It was also dissapointing for what I expected. I expected some chocolate flavors."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1/2 inch beige head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Foamy, broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and slight cocoa powder/chocolate aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, burnt coffee, and a subdued bitter chocolate flavor. For being a chocolate stout, there is much more of a coffee flavor in this one. A lower level of carbonation makes for a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good stout but like I said, this is very light on the chocolate with more emphasis on coffee smells and flavors."
"Overall, A beer that is ""meh"". Good but not great, and not good enough to warrant a second look or purchase. I feel like this beers grain bill was shorted or cheated and it is flawed in ways a stout typically is'nt. The purpose was a chocolate stout and that is a epic failure."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a very small head. Smell is of chocolate, roasted malts. Taste is good, chocolate,roasted malts, some notes of coffee, very flavorful. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"O- Decent as far as stouts go, well bodied stout, with a good flavor"
"Overall – The beer is okay... nothing exciting but quite drinkable. There are lots of better options to drink within this style however. I don't think I'd buy this one again."
"O: A nice lower alcohol stout, good flavours here, an enjoyable effort."
"It may fall short in comparison, but it’s still pretty good. I’m loving this paper cup, though."
"Overall, not bad but not great stout. Manages to avoid the pitfall of having a weak taste while being a lower abv stout, but this still hurts it in the mouthfeel. It just needs to be thicker. Other than that, the taste is a bit on the papery side. Could have been better. Would like to try to the double version of this to see if that improves the experience."
"D: For a huge fan of roast and coffee, doable, but not as attractive to the general public as a Chocolate Stout should be."
"O - Decent beer with an odd use of smoked malts. Patent malts add a good bit of over the top astringency and acridity but is made up in the beers smoothness. Good beer with a nice robust cigar perhaps."
"Pours black with brown tints, a mocha head that fades fast. The smell is amazing, the chocolate smell mixes with a heavy smoky malt. The smoky malt comes through big up front with the chocolate finishing. The smoke lasts throughout. The mouthfeel is lighter than expected, a light medium. This one could have been thicker to add to the smoothness. The overall beer is enjoyable, good flavors dominate the lack of thickness. Worth checking out."
"Not a beer I feel that I'd look out on a normal basis. Seems thin, and just too burnt and smoky for my tastes. Not much chocolate in this chocolate stout."
"Poured from bottle to a tulip, dark brown color with a one finger tan head that left too soon. The smell is not too bad, dark baking choclate, roasted coffee,malts. Taste was semi sweet dark baking chocolates with coffee notes, a little hop bitterness on the end with some coffee bitterness as well. I don't like a lot of sweetness is my chocolate stouts and this is about right for my taste, maybe a little under sweet for some. Mouthfeel was too thin and watery for me. Overall the appearance and mouthfeel were off for me but the smell and taste were pretty good and that it more important to me. I bought a sixer and will age a few and see."
"This brew pours out as a rich deep brown color that looks to be nearly black. The head is thick and tan at first that fades into a thin ring around the glass. The smell is of burnt toast and chocolate. The taste gives off a roasted bitter chocolate flavor, a slight sweet malt aftertaste. The mouthfeels not as thick as I felt it should be but this was a decent stout overall."
"O - It is alright. I just can't get past the ashy taste."
"Drinkability is good. Worth a try, but also not a stout I would go out of my way to get a hold of."
"Overall - Synergistic qualities of the coffee/chocolate and alcohol mesh into a elegant beer (if that is possible from a stout)"
"Overall a bit underwhelming on the flavor but the drinkability of this beer really makes up for it."
"Taste-Roasted coffee, dark chocolate, nice underlying hop bite stays on to the finish. Smooth, roasty, tasty. A great match for any grilled beef. A must for lovers of flavorfull stouts or robust porters."
"O: It was ok, the aroma and flavors were fine, but the mouthfeel really killed it for me."
"Overall, I like."
"Another average check on the stout list, it contained all the elements of a stout but left me wanting more boldness and body."
"Very good,quite surprised by the hop bite at the end. Would have again."
"Drinkability: Straight forward and the mouthfeel is a little watered down. Decent stuff, but not extraordinary."
"D / O?? (first time I've noticed the change!): Not the most exciting, but good / average. It got the job done, and far more enjoyable than the ""beer garden"" swill."
"D - A great every-day stout, it packs the nice chocolate flavor in while remaining very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel - Well, I had hoped this beer was going to be really good. It wasn't horrible, but it paled in comparison to some other Stouts I've had. It was drinkable and I could have another, but I want something a bit more balanced and robust in my Stouts."
"Drinkability: Very good for a stout. The best flavors and aromas linger nicely but the bitter qualities fade away."
"Got a six pack of this for my wife who loves chocolate. It's a solid beer. I have no complaints. It's not exceptional. You get a bit of dark malt with a bit of dark chocolate with a mediocre aftertaste. It's a beer I can drink with dinner or drink two or three or clear my pallet with a bit. It's light for a stout but I enjoyed it somewhat. I'm not impressed with FCB so far."
"Drinkability - I was expecting more from this beer coming from FCB. A little disappointed and will not be buying another 6-pack of this"
"Not a bad sipper for a cold day, but there are much better representations of the style out there!"
"beer lacks balance to be a beer I could enjoy regularly. if they would perhaps add a little milk chocolate to keep up with the bitterness, it would help. think I'll pass next time. I'm ruined for Rogue's chocolate stout."
"Drinkability -- Wow, this one left me wanting. Burnt and ashy meets sweet and chocolaty. No thanks."
"D: take a guess. wont revisit."
"D: Somewhat smooth beer with a malty backbone. Hints of chocolate appear more so in aroma than taste. Somewhat mild/bland, perhaps a good session stout."
"Drinkability was good. No signs of ABV. Lightly toasty stout."
"It has a decent mouthfeel, coats the mouth nicely. I can drink it, but it's nothing that I would go out of my way to find."
"Thin, bad aftertaste. I'm not a fan. Maybe I just got a bad bottle and if so I'll edit, because I have a few more from this 6-pack to try."
"Definitely won't buy again."
"D: It's drinkable, but not really remarkable (besides the review ;)). I won't buy this again."
"It poured very dark from the bottle to the beer mug. Thin head that quickly disappeared as did any lacing. Smell dominated by molasses, with a hint of dark chocolate. Taste didn't exactly match the smell. Sweet and roasted malts on the front end and dark chocolate on the back end, and it stayed with ya for a bit. Mouthfeel was week and its not complex at all. However, its extremely drinkable and tasted really good. Not the best in class, but easy to drink and enjoyable."
"Poured a very dark brown, almost to the point of being black, with a one fingered fast fading tan head, with alot of sticky lacing. On the nose, aromas of semi sweet chocolate, burnt molasses and toffee. Wasn't overly impressed with taste as burnt molasses ruled, but the chocolate came thru on the finish of this medium bodied brew that had desent carbonation."
"D - It's drinkable, but it's not really something to look forward to. It seems to me that the beer only shines through it's smell."
"Drink- Not too bad a solid effort for a market flooded with stouts."
"Drinkability is okay. Taste is nice, but not very good either way. I probably would not turn this beer down, but I would never go out of my way to get one of these."
"Dr: At this price point, I'd have it again, but other offerings may be better."
"Fort Collins Chocolate Stout 12oz bottle poured into sam smith english pint glass. Pours black with slight ruby highlights on the bottom of the glass. One finger tan head with lots of bubbles after a hard pour. Head dissipated quickly, stuck to the glass. Immediate nose of chocolate, roasted malt a touch of coffee. Gets sweeter as it warms. Very clean and smooth taste. If anything, the flavor is subdued compared to the smell but chocolate is present throughout, especially in the beginning. Hops are also very prominent, very noticeable in the middle and creating a slightly bitter finish. Light to medium body for a stout. Medium to high drinkability."
"Over all this is a great beer. It is a very good Stout. I has all the good characteristics of a good American stout. The only thing that I wasn't really a fan of was the after-smell. Other than that the beer was amazing. GREAT BEER FORT COLLINS BREWING!!!"
"I'm not really inclined to desire another."
"Drinkability - Very good for a stout. I was surprised how fast it went. 4.5/5"
"The next in my Brewer's Lunchbox sample pack. Poured a deep brown to black in the glass, nearly opaque, with a frothy tan head that laced nicely all the way down. Good example of the style. Roasted, slightly smoky malt in the nose. Same flavor present in the first sips, with a subtle hops bitterness to round out the flavor. Some residual smoke flavor--a tad more than you'd normally get in a stout--and it tarnished (for me anyway) what could have been a much better rating. Worth trying, but nothing to write home about."
"D: not bad, and i like the modest abv."
"It's great to have the multitude of choices that make this just an average beer. I love American microbrew culture!"
"D - Easy drinking, if not crazy-exceptional."
"Kind of boring flavor profile for a stout, not a lot of chocolate to speak of. Not a terrible beer though, just not super interesting."
"Dr. One after dinner is good."
"O: Not impressed."
"Really like this version of the style. Nice head at the pour with good tan color. Aroma of dark chocolate malts and roasted oats are in the nose. The nice chocolate malts really make this beer taste good, bit of hops in the end and some roasted notes in the mouth. Overall I would get this brew again, not a bad price and really a good show for this style."
"This beer looks a dark brown with ruby fringes when held to the light with a fast dissolving beige foam head. The smell is of a nice coffee and some brown sugar/molasses sweetness. There is the mocha aroma that does appear with the mixture of the coffee it makes a nice mocha aroma. The flavor is fairly similar, but not as potent on any of the flavors. There is a chocolate backer. For the most part the flavors are weak, but none of them are off-putting. The mouthfeel is extremely watery for a stout, and I blame the thinness of this stout as to the main reason that I don't much care for it. It does drink really nicely, so it has that going for it, It's a good beer, but it's not great."
"This was a great beer, glad to have picked it up. Would definately drink again."
"Very mellow and smooth, surprisingly good."
"(elevenses)"
"At below 6%,you get flavor that works COLD (or warm) and so 3 during a baseball game? Yeah, I can do that."
"The mouth is full. Carbonation level is moderate. Good feel for the style. Decently hopped beer here. I like the subtle bitterness mixed with the semi-sweet dark chocolate and cold coffee flavor. Good beer. I could have a few of these. Wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I liked it."
"Like it OK."
"This one was a dark brown, not quite black in appearance. Had a creamy head with decent lacing in the shaker glass. Mouthfell was a little on the thinner side but the taste was there: chocolate and perhaps some coffee. I've had this one on several occassions in the bottle but I defiintely like it on tap better. Better chocolate stouts out there but this one is tasty enough."
"D - This was a decent chocolate stout...not much coming off the nose but there are some chocolate flavors...try if you get the chance but there are better chocolate stouts out there"
"Drinkability - Sure I could have a couple of these in a night, but not often. I like it as a porter, so I'd advise Ft Collins to keep bottling this one and change the name to Fort Collins Porter. It is an easy drinking ""stout", but not one I'd reccommend if you are primarily a fan of stouts! I would've scored this better as a porter, but that's just me."
"I am a big fan of this style and was overall very pleased with this offering by FCB. Taste and smell is not as chocolatey as others i have tried, but still pleasing to the palate. I was quite surprised by the burst of hops that comes through in this beer. Can't recall another chocolate stout that had a similar aftertaste, but being a hophead I didnt mind. FCB makes some really great brews and this is one that I go back to time and time again."
"A ittle on the thin side but overall an interesting taste that is worthy."
"Be adventurous, and try this one. . . but find some Gouda first."
"D: I guess this is the beer's strongest point. However, it isn't drinkable in that I want to drink more. Just in that it goes down easy."
"Good overall but not a standout. Fairly drinkable and nothing is out of balance."
" ~ This is drinkable brew with some fine qualities. The beer is brewed to style requirements with nothing overwhelming or outragious."
"This is my first beer from this brewery. The beer pours a dark brown color with red highlights and a white head. The aroma is pretty basic with chocolate and toffee. The flavor is chocolate with a lot of earthy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D- if you're looking for a thick rich stout of chocolate and coffee goodness, do not come here. This one is different from anything I've had before...more hoppy. Thin. Blegh. Won't buy again with superior stouts on the market"
"Drinkability was high. It went down smooth with a pleasing taste and aroma and I could easily down 3 or 4 in one sitting."
"Pours a dark brown with tan head. Aroma of dark roast and baking cocoa. Flavor has nice dark roasted grain and semi-sweet cocoa. Mouth feel is medium body with medium-high carbonation. Overall, an enjoyable stout. Picked this up in Oklahoma at a small liquor store."
"D - you could drink this in place of a flavored water, but I would not buy it again."
"Pours black with a quick dissipitating off-white head. Roasted malt with secondary of the chocolate. A little thick looking body. Taste is thinner than that though. Maybe a little too carbonated. Decent hoppy bitterness, with a long finish. Drinkable."
"D - Well I have 3 more and it really is as close as I expected for a Fort C beer to get to chocolate taste. This milder version I enjoyed better because it balanced the coffee and chocolate malts rather than double them to make them unbearable. Very nice brew."
"D: A decent little stout; nothing spectacular but worth drinking a pint or two"
"A year later, I reiterate. A good stout. Roasty and not too heavy."
"All in all, the watered down taste of this brew might gift deductions from BAs out there, but not this one. I do think they probably should have included some type of light labeling, though. I can't see giving this beer an A rating by any means, but it is a solid B. Try it sometime, it is interesting."
"Drinkability: Good overall, could easily drink a few. Leaves me wishing for sweet chocolate, would pair well with a dark chocolate desert."
"This is a good chocolate stout. Not too heavy handed in terms of flavor, but there is enough flavor there to make this a can't miss. A case of this would look real good in my fridge. For now, I will just settle with the 6 pack..."
"This goes down easy and is not all that filling for a chocolate beer, so you can enjoy a few of these at a time. The 5.3% abv is barely noticeable."
"Picked this up at a store that looks tiny from the outside but surprisingly big (and with a good beer selection) on the inside. Enojyed this one slightly chilled in my favorite Warsteiner stein. Poured a thin looking dark chocolate brown color with a mini coffee brown head. The smell was chocolate-y with some ground coffee notes. Taste wasn't as robust as I had hoped. The chocolate quickly faded but had decent flavor and good hop balance with a wet, smooth finish that made it quite quaffable. I just wanted a little thicker stout that this one."
"Pours an opaque black-brown with about a finger of tan head that leaves only the slightest bit of lacing behind. The nose is cocoa, coffee, and roasted malts, with a subtle hint of hoppy pine in a background corner. The taste generally follows very closely, but the cocoa is a bit chalkier on the tongue and definitely more bitter, and there's a lack of expected sweetness, leaving a very dry taste instead. The body is a heavier medium, with limited carbonation and a pretty smooth texture. Overall, a slightly above average brew that stands as fairly highly drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is thin bodied - I prefer my stouts much chewier. But overall it's a decent beer, quite drinkable and I might even consider getting this one again."
"F: A stout like dryness and stout like earthy dark bitterness from the scorched malts. It remains dry throughout but doesn't hit you with more bitterness on the finish. Long lingering chocolate of course, as well as some molasses. Overall a pretty nice beer, a perfect night cap. Tons of chocolate and black patent malt, smoked malt, and strange creamy lactose. Abv feels a little higher than it is, but still a perfect nightcap. Could have used a lot more body and richness."
"D: A decidedly unmemorable stout. Not the worst beer ever, but certainly does not make a positive impression."
"Overall a tasty stout. Not the dessert beer that I was fearing, it's actually quite drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, semi dry, bittersweet, and filling."
"Somewhat dry finish, medium-bodied. Light effervescence. A lingering smoky aftertaste but with insufficient body for a stout. Basically, good smell, presence and taste but thin."
"D - A tasty beer but I think I'd fill up quick if I tried to session with this one. Still very enjoyable. I'll buy more."
"Beer poured jet black with a nice two fingered tan head that is long lasting. Nose is non-descipt other than the malt backbone. Taste is hints of bitter chocolate balanced with a mild bitter hop. Mouthfeel is thinner than hoped, average for the style. Drinkability is good. This is a tasty session beer that is definitely worth a shot."
"D-overall this beer is very drinkable and refrshing the only drawback being that it seems a bit thin overall it is an excellent tasting and very refreshing brew"
"***Note; the Double Chocolate Stout from FCB was quite excellent; more dessert than it's older, more refined sibling. Check it out, too."
"D: It tastes very good, nothing special, but easy to drink."
"Finish is bitter coffee character all around but with a nice bitter finish. There is nothing bad about this stout, there is just nothing really very good about it. Taste simply like a decent beer that had some coffee poured into it. Nothing special."
"An average stout with typical stout aroma and flavor of roasted malts and some chocolate notes. Unfortunately, the aroma and especially flavor were rather subdued compared to other stouts I've had, so I don't see myself really seeking this out again."
"Drinkability: Drinkable and would go well with playing darts and pool at the bar."
"Drinkable. Everything is above average here, but nothing outstanding. Would get more to share with friends!"
"Color is a nice dark brown with a thin dark tan head. The aroma and taste are a mild cocoa/caramel mix with a touch of smoke that comes out as it warms up. It doesn't have the punch of other specimens of this type but is not watered down. A nice mix. It's fairly smooth. I'd go with this one if Young's isn't available"
"Pours a dark, opaque chocolate brown with a fairly thick and somewhat persistent cinnamon tan head. Aroma is rich, smoky, oily and chocolaty with hints of molasses and coffee. Flavor is smoky and chocolaty, slightly sweet, touched with fine roast coffee and molasses. Thick texture is smooth and fizzy, quite lively."
"not really impressed more like a brown ale or porter to me"
"Pours very dark brown but not quite black. A large sand colored head forms and has good retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. More or less average after appearance. Malty aroma of chocolate and coffee. Pleasant but is a bit timid and lacks complexity. The flavor trys not to offend with any big flavors. Malt up front with hints of chocolate and a touch of smoke. Pleasant but I want some big flavor in a stout. The body lacks depth. Feels fairly thin. Nice enough of a beer to drink. Seems Fort Collins Brewing puts out middle of the road beer that will appeal to a wide audience. That is fine but it is also overpriced by a couple dollars a 6-pack in this market and that will prevent me from drinking anymore of their beer."
"I bought this when i was out with the GF hopeing she would find another style besides lambics she loves(girls love chocolate, right?),she thought it was nothing special, so did I. I wont buy this again."
"D: Overall, not a bad stout... Not a killer stout but not a bad stout.... Pretty average... I'd say it improves as it warms...."
"For a beer billing itself as ""Chocolate Stout"" there wasn't much chocolate, or any flavor as far as that goes. In general, disappointing and not recommended."
"For a beer called chocolate stout, I was expecting a little more chocolate flavor in this one. It was mostly coffee flavors instead. A decent stout but a little misleading in the name."
"3.0 D: I tried it. Won't be drinking again."
" D- The chocolate malt flavor is huge with a bit of a sweaty/smoky flavor that is a bit to much. As the beer warms the darker roasted notes cover it a bit but not enough. It is rich in chocolate malt but not much other depth."
"D: pretty drinkable bock. Nice mouthfeel and taste; nothing too filling; decent drinking beer overall."
"In all, a very drinkable stout that brings a lot of flavor to the forefront without being too overpowering alcohol-wise. Very sessionable, and a pretty solid offering from FCB."
"Pours a mediu black with very browniesh highlights. Good, light tan head that recedes to a foam that lasts throughout the whole brew. The aroma is a grainy and powdery chocolate bar. Then the toasted malts add some bread to the aroma, maybe just a touch of creamy coffee for sweetness. The front of the palate is dry, and powdery chocolate. The middle lets the hops bitter that chocolate malt to a more coffe like flavor and acidic mouthfeel. The flavor and savory palate slowly thin from the front to the back of the palate. Becoming more and more watery. Pretty good drinkability, but the chocolate fades to more of an acidic coffee from front to the back of this beers palate."
"D: not gonna get this one again. I think they missed the mark a little."
"Jet black body, slight brown hues show through when held to the light. Nice sized brown head tops it off, and leaves a nice trail behind. Chocolaty malt on the nose, maybe a bit of dark fruit as well. Big chocolate malt flavor. Bit of a bitter hop presence backs it up. Nice full and smooth mouth. Overall a pretty good brew."
"Somewhat drinkable. The ABV isn't too high and it's not particularly filling, but it's just not tasty. You could down a number of these, but I'm not sure why you'd want to. Maybe a hophead would appreciate this more, but it's just not what I'm looking for from a chocolate stout. It's unfortunate the ABV isn't higher - some cellaring might make this brew more enjoyable."
"Drink ability is above average. It is sessionable but kinda bland. A decent beer but dont think I'd buy again considering the tons of other awesome stouts available in Colorado"
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a deep brown color, has a thick pour, and a milk chocolate head that is about 1/2 inch and leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is not that strong. There is roasted malt, some coffee, and a few nutty hints in the nose. The taste is lacking the chocolate in the name, but has a nice roasted malt character and a decent balance of hop in the finish. This is a ok brew, but for it to be called ""chocolate stout"" I think there should be more chocolate prevalent in the taste."
"D - A very balanced brew."
"D - yeah, but not really as a chocolate stout."
"A nice american stout. Not a world beater but certainly drinkable."
"I enjoyed drinking this beer; it went down easily, but if given the choice, I would take the Brooklyn Chocolate Stout, which is more like comfort food in the Fall when it's getting cold and the leaves are dying. This is supposed to be a beer you can snuggle with next to the fireplace while watching Monday night football."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer appears black in the glass but upon closer inspection has slight hues of crimson. The two-finger, tan colored head is thick and frothy. The nose not overwhelming but is all malt; semi-sweet chocolate with burnt barley and roasted coffee are present. The taste follows suit with the roasty malt flavors being nicely balanced with the hops which are only slightly discernable in flavor. The taste starts out slightly sweet with caramel and semi-sweet chocolate and transitions to the roasty, slightly acrid and mildly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with the carbonation being slightly creamy. It could have used a little fuller body and carbonation. Overall, not a bad stout but not memorable either."
"All in all a nice beer but as far as a chocolate stout goes...it leaves a little to be desired. American brewers need to know that balance is key, more than outright lack of flavor, to not offending the palette."
"Overall: a decent chocolate stout and a nice attempt by Fort Collins. ~"
"D - Decent overall. Pretty good flavors with the hop finish balancing things out a bit. A bit too light bodied for a stout and could use more intensity in the flavor. I would probably drink this again, but there are other stouts I'd go for first. I can't deny it's drinkable though."
"This beer pours a nearly opaque black color. The head is a solid inch and a half in height, and recedes slowly into thick, sticky lacing. The aroma is of faint roasted malt with an even faint whiff of chocolate. I'm not at all impressed by this aroma. The taste is more forthcoming, but still quite mild. The is some roasted malt, but I can't detect any chocolate. There is also an unpleasant metalic thing going on in the finish. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a watery texture, and high carbonation for a stout. Overall, I do not believe that this is truly a chocolate stout as I can find no chocolate in it. All I can taste is a regular stout which is poorly done."
"D - not as sweet and creamy and I would expect for a chocolate stout but a great beer with a lot going on."
"All in all, and rather run-of-the-mill Chocolate Stout."
"Pours a nearly black color with redish-brown hue along the edges. Initially has a 1 finger head that quickly dissolves to a tanned lace across the top of the beer. It leaves an interesting amount of lacing on the glass considering the lack of head on the beer. Taste is pleasantly chocolately and has a bitter dry finish. Nose has a bit of dark chocolate in it as well. Has a medium light mouthfeel but is a little too carbinated."
"drinkability is ok - a 5% stout that is light and thin with ok flavors - session stout to me"
"Drinkability: Definitely drinkable with its low abv, yet I think the consistency would catch up to its flavor to make more than 2 in a sitting just too much."
"D~ Overall solid. I'd try it on tap but not again in a bottle at home. Beer geeks should try."
"Mf/D: Slightly over-carbonated for me, light body, long dry malty finish."
"Pours the darkest of browns with a thin tan head. Not much retention and no lacing.Aroma is of dark roasted malts coffee and chocolate. Body is thin with some carbonation. Taste is coffee and dark chocolate. Malty, but an average example of this style at best."
"D- Overall, this is a pretty solid stout that I enjoyed and wouldn't mind having again. Recommended."
"This is a good beer, easy to drink, but not particularly exciting."
"Overall- Light but just enough chocolate to make this easily sessionable."
"All in all, this is a very worthy beer and I will be trying many more stouts in the near future."
"Too me, this seems a cut above most of the stouts I've tried. Yes, its nearly black. Yes, it devlopes a thick, persistant head. The nose is inviting, the mouthfeel pleasing. Best of all, it tastes as good and maybe better than any of dozens of stouts I've tried. Roasty, sweet, and with a bit of a bite."
"Appears a dark roasted malt beast that eats all visible light forms in it's path. Head forms thick light tan mocha hue going on. Layers of lacing are left behind thin and unevenly strung in nature. Aromatics offering up more herbal hops than strong chocolate accents, mild cocoa powder and a touch of roasted coffee accents. Flavor has a nice balanced chocolate stout feel no sugary hershey syrup notes this is a stout that finishes with roasted malt and black patent malt without killing me with chocolate sweetness. Dark chocolate cacao maybe, complex herbal hop finish but watery at times not a beer I'm blown away by but it's damn solid. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate to light carbonation levels going on, it's one of those Amerian stouts that doesn't over do it. Drinkability is solid but I'm sure theres's a litle something missing here, but I do love these beers as a collective from Fort Collins."
"D - The chocolate character is unusually convincing, especially in the finish, but that doesn't necessarily make for a great beer. There is not much going on outside of the chocolate, and while the flavor is nice, the aroma is pretty weak. There is a lot of chocolate here, but not much stout."
"Drinkability: A very average chocolate stout in every way. You can taste the chocolate and malt, but is far from complex. Nothing jumps out unlike other chocolate stouts I have had before. I will not be looking for this again."
"D: Over all decent.. but I am not going to be buying cases..."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. The stout appears a clear deep brown color with about an inch of ecru foam. Nose and flavor are of light milk chocolates, a touch of caramel and vanilla, could use a bit more roastiness, some raisins. A tad thin bodied with adequate carbonation."
"12 oz. Black/brown pour. Just off white head. Roasted malt aromas, some chocolate, some hop presence. Roasted flavors, mild chocolate, could have been more abundant. Maybe too much hops in this one. A little light bodied, but now watery. Clean finishing. Drinkability is obviously pretty high. If you have a choice, get their Double Chocolate Stout instead."
"Fort Collins Brewing Chocolate Stout pours an opaque black with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is some chocolate and some coffee in the aroma. The flavor also is chocolate and coffee with some citrusy hops mixed in. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but otherwise an enjoyable beer."
"Overall this isn't a terrible stout but it's a good distance from a very good one."
"Poured a thick black body with tan head and contained some aromatic notes of roasted and mild chocolate (hints of caramel and vanilla). A dry malt taste balanced w/ swwet chocolate and caramel. Rather nondescript and no real balance from hops at all. A little stick medium-body that goes down w/o a problem. Not a bad beer by any means, but a rather weak stout."
"The feel is watery but ashy at the end. Not smooth, not dry. Overall it's strictly average, and though drinkable, not something I'd find myself craving."
"D= A decent chocolate stout and certainly quite drinkable. The brewers got more right than wrong here for sure."
"D - Has a nice kick to it if you're into that sort of thing. I personally wouldn't drink this again until I further develop my tastebuds. Either way, I could see this as a good ""enjoyment"" beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, although the name implies otherwise, this is a good beer to drink for a while is you want a stout that isn't going to try to overwhelm you with chocolate, maltiness and sweetness."
"Overall - Flavor is great and I enjoy the bitterness. I was a bit disappointed in the aroma, but the flavor and mouthfeel more than make up for it."
"Overall Im not too excited but I could see it being a session beer and having more then one due to its alcohol content. I would recommend to try it at least once."
"Surprising in that it's not straight malt but features some moderate hopping to accessorize the coffee and unsweetened chocolate notes. The texture is a bit thinner than I prefer, which leads to a dry but grainy aftertaste. Not a bad attempt but needs some fine tuning before this breaks into the rotation."
"Wanted a little more chocolate falvor in this, finish was a little too acrid."
"D: It isn't overbearingly sweet, but it is still just a tad too sweet for me to sit down and drink more than one of these. Has a great stout flavor and profile that is amped on chocolate. I'd recommend it, and maybe keep some on hand. Tasty beer. Thanks John!"
"I didn't enjoy drinking, although I did enjoy smelling it. I'm resisting the urge to dismiss it because I'm not observing the strong stout flavors with a nice alcohol bite of an imperial stout. But I think it's definitely possible to brew a quality normal strength stout and still give it character."
"Dark pour, with a tan head. smells sweet, malty, coffee, chocolate. Tastes like espresso, and some chocolate in there also. touch of hops for balance. overall just okay, nothing special about it really. I could drink this again, but I dont see me ever seeking this one out."
"D- This is one of my least favorite styles, but it came in a sampler pack. I suppose as the the style goes this one is easy to drink."
"From notes. On tap at the Blind Tiger in NYC> Black, thin tan head stays for a while, leaves some lacing. SMELLS roasty, chocolate, malty sweet. Pleasant, but faint. TASTES like roasty coffee, bitter chocolate, hop bitterness and sweet maltiness, all balanced and working well together. FEEL the moderate carbonation and fiz, mildly viscous, thin side of medium body, clean finish. DRINKS very easily, and I've just learned it is only 5+ %, so that is understandable."
"Still happy I could give this a whirl."
"Fort Collins Chocolate Stout poured almost black into the glass leaving a small tight head with good lacing. The aroma was of Dove Dark Chocolate. The flavor was chocolaty of course but there was also a strong taste of cola. It was sweet and smooth with a pleasant mouthfeel."
"Moderate carbonation, fairly even mouthfeel, finishes a bit dry. Very drinkable beer."
"D: Easy to drink, but kinda boring. Not too heavy in the stomach."
"Decent stout overall.. pales in comparison to the few other chocolate stouts I've tried (notably Brookyln's). Pours a nice jet black.. very little head and zero lacing. Taste has some subtle chocolate malt, not much for hops, at least for me anyway. I felt the body was a bit on the thin side, which was a minor disappointment. Average drinkability as it's sort of bland and boring... I liked this breweries IPA and Red Ale but this stout doesn't really impress me."
"Don't drink and review."
"A fine drinker, slid right down w/o any lingering off flavors. A nice simple stout here with plenty of chocolate flavor. Well done."
"Not the best chocolate stout but a good representation, very drinkable."
"This beer really surprised me. I wasn't expecting much, but I really enjoyed it. This beer made it official, I am a lover of stouts."
"D - very pleasant and drinikable"
"D - Easy to drink and fairly light for a stout. But I doubt I'll seek this one out again, as there are many better examples of the style out there."
"Overall: An average beer. Cheers!"
"drinkablity-overall decent beer, not too high in alcohol and left me filled"
"Thanks John.. but... this one just didn't do it for me."
"Fort Collins Chocolate Stout isn't a bad stout by any means, but by labelling it a chocolate stout I feel they are doing themselves a disservice as many people who purchase chocolate stouts have certain expectations in mind and this offering is not that."
"Overall: The burnt taste is a little overwhelming. The mouth feel is coating, carbonated and astringent. The finish lingers on the palate a little long. The taste is not as what I have tried in a chocolate stout. The chocolate seems hidden behind the roasted and burnt malt. It is an okay beer. Need to have more chocolate flavor and the burnt character lowered."
"Drinkability: Well, should not have waited this long to revisit Fort Collins. As expected, another solid style offering."
"Not a great beer, I am regretting getting a sixer of this."
"Nice and hoppy, good flavor, light of body. Sessionable, for a stout."
"D - I'm a big fan of coffee stouts and this one didn't disappoint. I've had better but I could see going back to this one."
"It's a shame about this beer, especially considering how much I like their Double Chocolate Stout. I will definitely grab the DCS instead of this every day of the week. Probably won't be having this one again."
"Mike"
"3.2/5"
"Drinkability - Not too bad, I'd like some of the sweeter coffee/chocolate notes perhaps to show up more, as its mostly bitter, but its still not bad at all."
"Pours a dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some toffee/chocolate. The taste is slightly sweet, with toffee/chocolate. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice brew."
"D: Wonderful for a stout. The beer was not filling and went down smooth and easy. I had to pace myself with this one. While I probably wouldn't go for a sixer i'd have a hard time turning down one or two of these."
"O) Not a lot of chocolate in a pretty weak stout. The result is a lack of body and no support for the flavors that are going on. I wish they'd dial this up a few notches."
"Tasted 8/1/08."
"12 oz bottle. Dark brownish black pour with a nice thick coffee head. Aroma of roasted malt and bitter chocolate. Thin mouthfeel but tasty with roasted nuts and chocolate dominating the overall taste. Nice dry but sweet finish. A good beginner stout in that its fairly simple but still enjoyable."
" I don't expect stouts to be session beers, but this nearly fit the bill. If they're motor-oil thick, full of oatmeal, chocolate, or roasted malt, and smoothly bitter in the back, they can be wonderful. This was the first, and hopefully, ""generic stout"" that I've ever had and seeing how this beer has a higher rating then what I'm giving it, I have a feeling that something got lost in translation between the Centennial State and here. For some reason, I still refuse to believe that any stout could be this weak..."
"D: Drinkability was smooth and easy, wont fill you up and light enough to enjoy a few."
"Not bad, but like I said, just not one of the best when the words ""chocolate"" and ""beer"" collide in my mind. I bought this as a single bottle in a mixed 6-pack from the Woodman's in Oak Creek."
"This beer is not very complex and also not too overpowering as some stouts are. Definitely a good American Stout in my opinion."
"D: I liked the bitter chocolate coffee in the nose. Sokid choice for a dessert beer."
"Fort Collins' Chocolate Stout sports a crappy label (different from that pictured above) but pours a good looking beer. Very dark brown, just about black in color with a large, dense but creamy beige head. Bitter bakers chocolate appears in the malt profile. The hops used add to this bitterness while tasting. The chocolate is not as sweet or as prominent as it really should be in a chocolate stout, it comes through on the finish while upfront is mostly just burnt malt with no defining flavor. Charcoal and earthy notes come through just before the finish and a bready yeast feel lingers throughout. The aftertaste is decent and long. Light/medium bodied, with a slightly grainy feel about it, but alas it drinks well. Theres better out there."
"M&D - thinner than expected, almost Irish Dry stout thin, smooth and easy to drink, one of the more sessionable stouts, a most enjoyable beer"
"D- It is definitely not too sweet or rich, but it really lacks in the 'wow' department. I would not seek this one out for sure."
"smell had a chocolate roasted malt smell. nothing exciting, but a decent scent going on. taste was kind of watered down. decent flavor, but left my mouth wanting a little more. mouthfeel was quite nice, smooth taste."
"drinkability - Fine drinking beer, thought it would have more of chocolate flavor"
"Pours a two-fingered brown head that sits on a black body that offers the slightest glimmer of light to peer through... intimidating as a chocolate a stout should be... bright, mellow milky lactic scents pleasantly mingle with chocolate and coffee--engaging... lively, effervescent between the teeth.. the slightest hints of hops rough up the edges of what one would expect to be a smooth drinker... lively at the throat too, with little lingering presence... chocolate, yes--and smoked accents of peat or somthing darker and sweeter through the nostrils... not as ""smooth"" as advertised--but still pleasant and chocolaty... completing the sampler I bought a ways back (in the spring!) I feel compelled to revisit the 12-pack at a later date--it was that enjoyable, and balanced the wheat (1) with the lagers (3) and the ales (2)..."
"D: I wouldn't choose this for a session, myself, but I could go for a glass with some Devil's Food. I spoiled myself by having Rogue and Young's as my first chocolate stouts, but they are, without a doubt, superior."
"Still, very drinkable on a cool weather night - it would pair up well with a piece of German chocolate cake."
"D: Enjoyable. Would have a few during a session."
"This brew poured the typical opaque dark brown. The head looked thin, though. The taste really lacked the stout bite that I like, which truly disappointed. While this lead to a somewhat creamy mouthfeel and maybe greater overall drinkability, it made for a rather weak style. The chocolate presence was noticeable in smell and taste. The chocolate wasn't overpowering, but it was distinctive either..."
"M/D - Full flavored but thin and watery on the feel. Not near as creamy as it looked. Chocolate is a little bitter, but overall a decent chocolate stout."
"D - Makes you want to keep some kind of beer in your mouth, though not necessarily finishing with this."
"A well-flavored stout, but the flavors are just a little off throughout. Not bad but I'd rather try something else rather than having another."
"Pours a deep black with a small tannish head. Aroma is medium sweet with nuts toffee and bitter chocolate. The flavor is sweet throughout with just a hint of bitter at the end. Medium bodied, slick texture. Finishes medium and bitter. This one is a confusing one as it appears to try to be both a sweet and a dry stout."
"I'd drink one again, but it doesn't stand out."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability is good here if I could find this on tap."
"I find it strange that a chocolate stout actually tastes more like coffee than chocolate. This isn't a bad thing (because it's pretty good), but it seems like the balance is a little off. The subtle bitterness nicely compliments the ""bite," but I was really expecting more chocolate flavor. I could definately enjoy this beer with company because it's a ""sipper," but there are other similarly styled beers that I prefer more."
"M,D: The mouthfeel is so light in this one, but as for the drinkability...one for me is enough!"
"Drinkability: Decent drinkability thanks to the lower ABV. Drinkability may be it's strong point. Not a big fan of this brew. Very middle of the road in my opinion."
"For some reason I remember the earlier bottles of this having a stronger chocolate taste. It's possible that this beer loses its freshness quicker than normal. For what I had, this is average. I would recommend Young's Double Chocolate Stout over this as a better example."
"Pours jet black with a dark tan head. In the aroma, a small chocolate and roasty malt. In the taste, a small bitter chocolate malt, yet kind of light in flavor. A bitter, and a light to medium body mouthfeel and a dry, bitter chocolate aftertaste. Kind of thin for a stout and faint flavors and aroma, ok, but could be better."
"Light-bodied and extremely drinkable."
"D: I won't be buying this in the future. I feel bad cause the look and smell are totally misleading"
"I doubt i would but this again, something i may drink if its around"
"it's bitter, doesn't really refresh at all and the flavor doesn't do anything for me"
"Worth a try..."
"Solid choice - glad I tried it. I probably would go to other chocolate stouts if I so desired one in the future."
"A black, brown ale that is opaque. No head after a short period, but what started with fluffy and light tan until it fell away completely. Singular roasty nose that is clean and light, which continues well through the mouth plus a smooth grainy taste in the center (oatmeal??). Sweet initially with a dry finish. Good, solid stout that is smooth becuase it's just a little light in the mouth. Good choice. I'd get it again."
"I found this brew to be very enjoyable and rather drinkable. There is a multitude of richness in the flavor profile without going overboard. It's still relatively balanced but leans toward the sweet by just a bit. Hops clearly seem to be there but do not play an incredibly noticeable part in the taste. Definitely worth checking out and I would have it again anytime."
"Drinkability is ok not what i was expecting for a chocolate stout. More like a smoked porter with chocolate notes. Needs more roasted malt more body. Still not bad in flavor department."
"Overall a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, smooth, not quite a session beer because it's different enough where you need to be in the mood for it. I'd have another, though."
"The head rose nice and tall but didn't stick around long beutiful dark color with a little red around the edges when held up to the light. Delicious malty aroma with a slight hint of burnt barley, gets my mouth watering. Unfortunatly the taste is a slight letdown... A little thin in mouth feel. But strong bitterness from burnt barely and bitter chocolate are well pronounced. Overall an excellent beer and the lightness allows you to drink several in session."
"D: Not the best example of a stout, chocolate or otherwise. Far from a drain pour, but not one I'd actively seek out again."
"Mocha goodness, like a mocha shake almost. The taste is solid, could be more complex but certainly nice. Quite a drinkable stout, could use a dose more of the cocoa, but other than that a solid brew from Fort Collins. Somewhat like a Milk Stout, for the sweetness and the texture, but a little heavier."
"Drinkability: A very quenching stout that is mediocre in its properties. Worth revisiting and quaffing."
"D - I would drink another, but not necessarily search out a sixer of this because of the lacking flavor."
"HV"
"It's an above average beer, but not what I was hoping for. Still, very drinkable."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head above the almost opaque dark brown brew. Thick head falls slowly, with ample lacing. Aroma is malted chocolate. Taste follows along, but a bit more sedate than I expected, with a balancing bitter close. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, only the lightest prickling of carbonation, and drinkability is pretty good. Not all I was hoping for, but still an acceptable brew."
"This was just an average stout overall. No glaring missteps but no glaring triumphs either. Aside from a slightly above average aroma, this one is really middle of the road."
"Pours a nice dark opaque, but with very little head (fizzy, too) and no lacing. Has a nice chocolate stout scent, though, a nice hint of burnt grains with an excellent chocolate overtone. Good taste, predominatly chocolate, but with a slight roasted barley undertone, and a nice chocolate/coffee bitter aftertaste. Goes down fine, although not the smoothest I've ever had. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours thin and dark brown, nearly black. A lackluster one-finger khaki head fades quickly leaving a faint layer of bubbles on the surface, but did exhibit some decent lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is of chocolate, what else? There's also some toasted malt and hints of roasted chestnuts. Sadly, the chocolate flavor isn't as prevalent as I would have hoped. There's a nice malt base here, but it seems weak and somewhat watered down for a stout. Mouthfeel is thin as well, and overly carbonated for the style. Not nearly as ""velvety smooth"" as the label indicates. Low ABV makes it easy to have more than one. Not a bad beer, overall, but one I probably wouldn't reach for with so many other outstanding chocolate stouts out there. Might be a nice beer to pair with a cigar, as it's likely to complement the tobacco without overpowering it and taking over."
"When you advertise yourself as a ""Chocolate Stout", I shouldn't have to sit there for a second and figure out just where exactly the chocolate notes are at in your beer. They still pack some flavor and easy drinkibility into this package but a little more assertiveness and definition of their main flavor would have gone a long way here if you ask me."
"Drinkability: A decent drinker but pales in comparison to others brewed in this style"
"A nice chocolate aroma with some roasted malts. A slightly thinner mouthfeel than what I expected. The chocolate taste is there, but it just doesn't dominate. Also, it doesn't give you that chocolate milk sensation. A good, dry finish. Chocolate Stout doesn't crack my top 10 list of stouts."
"Drinkability: Tasty, relatively low ABV, I could set down to some serious beer drinking with this. Alas, I only bought one as part of a mixed six. I would go back for a full six. A definite must try."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Pours black with a light ruby edge on it and a beige moderate lasting head. Smooth creamy roasted smell with some chocolatey notes. Kind of candy bar like. Taste is roasty malt, and chocolatey, but not overwhelmingly so at all. Moderate to light body and medium to high carbonation. Good, but I'm not blown away. Pretty balanced and easy drinking and at least doesn't have an artificial ""we added some crazy chemical"" chocolate taste to it."
"This stout is not as robust as other stouts, but this stout is fairly easy to drink. Probably wont go looking for this one again but overall it is not bad. I will happily finish this six pack with no complaints."
"Md-thick body when sloshed in the mouth, likely due to dextrines. Dries in the finish due to the roast contributions and an alcohol that just reaches into my perception (I'm not particularly sensitive to alcohol). I could easily go for another."
"This stout is drinkable but not so much enjoyable. Too washed out and wet."
"Picked up a six pack at Blanchard's in Allston to go along with a chocolate torte that we had for dessert. Pours a jet black color into the pint glass. Large head and no carbonation noticeable. Smell was of roasted barley and licorice. The taste left something to be desired though. As this is a chocolate stout, it would be nice to actually taste some chocolate. All I got was a mouth full of bitter roasted coffee flavor. No sweetness whatsoever. It's a decent beer, but perhaps I just missed it's point. Not too impressed with my first try of Ft. Collin's brews."
"Drinkability - a decent way to support local craft brewing. A good pick with some chili or smoked/grilled meat."
"Pretty well-balanced, smooth and easy to drink."
"Poured thin, with perhaps a bit too much of an orange head. Taste was a bit disappointing, did not seem to match the aroma, which was a decent mix of chocolate and a bit of malt. Kind of reminded me of the Ommegang, with almost a bit of a metalic ""ping", though not as ridiculously overpriced as the Ommegang"
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with some burnt orange highlights. Small head with some light lacing. The smell is immediate and becoming, of chocolate and sweet roasted malts. Tastewise, there aren't any surprises - chocolate, roasted malts and a bit of hops, with a dry finish. This is a pleasant tasting and well-balanced brew. Smooth, as the label claims. It is heavily carbonated for a stout, which is not automatically a bad thing, except that in this case it is to mask a way-too-thin body. This beer is highly drinkable, what with the pleasant flavor, thinness and low ABV."
"D - If bitter, dark chocolate is your thing, this is a good one. Good flavor, but the mouthfeel is a little off. Too light and a little too carbonated, IMO. Overall good, though."
"D- It's drinkable. I finished the first 3/4 rather quickly but saved the last 1/4 for it to warm. I've never had a stout like this where it tasted worse as it warmed. Should have drank it all cold."
"D: Good -- it wasn't heavy bodied, yet had some good flavors going on, so it went down pretty easy."
"An inch of dark tan almost brown head forms with mixed bubbles. Body is a oily blackness like ink from a vintage pen. Nose has shades of smokey malt and coco and maybe even some dill seed. Enters the mouth creamy and smooth with big up front coco and vanilla. Most of the flavor is upfront on this one. You do get a little bit of a burnt malt feel on the back of the tongue. As it warms a little you get notes of dark fruit also. Mouthfeel is chocolatey thickness with a tit of bitter on the finish. Decently drinkable."
"This American Stout is a pleasant treat. It pours a semi-dark color from the bottle. The head is foamy and tan in color. The smell is of roasted malts, with perhaps a hint of chocolate aroma. The taste is simple yet flavorful. As with the smell, there is a somewhat roasted chocolate sweetness upfront with slight bittering for balance. A nice dry finish. For an American stout, and a break from the higher A.B.V .stouts out there, this is certainly worthy of giving a go taste. Enjoy!!!"
"Drinkability: this needs to be a bit heartier on the malt front - it comes across a bit thin for a stout. Decent beer but after having Southern Tier Chokolat, this leaves you wanting a bit more."
"It's well-balanced - almost to a fault for the style. There are nice flavors going on, though I was expecting a bit more chocolate considering the name."
"It's dark but surprisingly red near the edges. Very carbonated for a stout and more light in taste than most chocolate ones I've had. The chocolate is not very overbearing or harsh and is more a background taste than anything. If you want a ""light"" chocolate beer, than this is your man. Overall, I'd say this beer is decent, meh."
"Drinkability: Flavorful, though not overly chocolatey and a bit light in body, but it's still a decent stout."
"D: I didn't enjoy this beer that much for some reason. A greater level of complexity and less carbonation would have helped. I'd have it again, but there are finer choices."
"Black as oil with no head and no real lace to speak of and smelled like strained grains in heavy water, like it was the refuse made when washing grain? Unusual to say the least, but there was nothing else other than a little sweetness from the Chocolate and a little rusty water. Mouth was , well, it formed on the top of the mouth and went down as such with a bitter aftertaste not from the flavor. The sweetness made this seem like swallowing a candy more than a beer. Taste was about Saranac average. Like I've had this stout combo many times, usually in the cheaper types and this was that again. The Chocolate was artifical and sweet and the rounding from the hops did little to help. There was a hole in the finish, leaving sweet and bitter to do battle. There are better Chocolate stouts out there that do the style with more balance and less candy. Okay at best if you like really sweet beers."
"At first it seemed that the brew felt thinner only due to the fact that it was fresh from the fridge and a bit too cold, however as the brew warmed a bit its true character was revealed. Thinner and rather disappointing for a stout in my opinion. Moderate to high carbonation doesn't help the thin texture either. Semidry in the finish. At first this brew seemed it may be fairly impressive but as I continued drinking it became more and more evident that it wasn't quite as interesting and I previously thought. Good, not great."
"I was hoping this would compliment the chocolate raspberry cake I was having but I was left disappointed. I will try it again but I will give it some time come up in temperature."
"d- ok, will not buy this beer again, if it is offered at a party than will def have this other a macro beer"
"D - Pretty good, but doesn't really jump out at me. Overall, not much chocolate in this stout...more of a coffee flavor. If I saw this again, I'd pick up a bottle, but not much more than that."
"D: It's easy to drink, and tastes pretty good. A solid session beer, but I wouldn't really consider it a chocolate stout. More of a straight-up stout, with a nice roasted flavor. Definitely not much in the way of chocolate in this one."
"Overall, good beer to grab if you're in the area."
"Overall not bad, but I think I will pass on this one again. It was just not my cup of tea and I really think they could have done some more to really push this through and make it a really solid offering, oh well you win some you lose some."
"Pretty solid stout. Its not going to overwhelm you with chocolate, but its definitely something I would get as a dessert or night cap treat."
"Pours extremely dark brown. Only when held to light do you see a wee bit of ruby. Even off a firm pour, there is no true head. Nose is dusty. Flavor is so-so. Lack of character. Lack of depth. Mild malt tones. No real strong chocolate character at all. Feel is a bit thin on the liquid, but it does have a strong carbonation. Overall, there isn't much to this one. It just doesn't have any level of punch I'd expect it to."
"Pours an opaque dark brown color with a full finger foamy dark tan head that resists fading. Some lacing present. Through the foam you can smell hints of milk chocolate, but directly off the surface it has an aggressive and strong roasted coffee bean character. Well carbonated, the foam tends to offset the heavily roasted bitter tone. Finishes somewhat dry. The 5.3% ABV isn't a factor. This one isn't grabing my attention."
"A pretty decent chocolate stout that could almost be session able."
"Not bad but not great. I get more coffee than chocolate - kind of like a mild iced coffee."
"D-It is a very drinkable beer that I would buy again.Overall it has a great roased chocolate taste that could make a good session beer."
"On draught at Vintage Estates in Boardman. The beer is a dark brown color with a medium thick and rocky beige head that has decent retention. Rings of lacing on the glass. The aroma is roasted malt with touches of chocolate and sweet fruit. Medium, glassy smooth body that feels thin at times with roasted malt and chocolate flavors over top light coffee and hops. The finish is creamy and roasty and leaves a sweet chocolate aftertaste. Although there isnt really anything wrong with this beer, there are far better Chocolate Stouts out there."
"Was able to give this brew a try the other night. This is the first time that I have had any of the brews from Fort Collins so was not sure what to expect but my love of stouts directed me to it. This brew poured from the bottle to a very dark brown color, hedging on black with a smallish lighter tan head. The retention was pretty good though and left some nice lacing at the upper sections of the glass. The aromas are pretty good, with some roasted and chocolate scents coming to mind from the start. I say that it is pretty good as I would have expected a little more robustness but all being said it is not making me turn away. The taste is also pretty solid, chocolate and roasted malt flavors seem to be the dominant flavors but in a way that it seems light. The feel of the brew is quite smooth as no flavors come across as being harsh. Over all this is a pretty easy drinking brew but feel that this is pretty pedestrian compared with others in the same category, Nice try, just come up short."
"D: Unremarkable either way. I am enjoying the beer but I would not actively seek it out again. Try the Z Lager though. Really unique beer."
"The flavor is mediocre: notes of powdered dark chocolate, some fig, prune, beef, and a bit of hops. Mouthfeel is dry, medium-bodied, and the carbonation is okay. All in all, this isn't that great of a beer, but it's worth a try I suppose. I won't be having it again, though."
"D - I'd enjoy another, but this is a beer that is better enjoyed in small quantities or you'd otherwise get that bloated and heavy feel in your gut. Sip and enjoy."
"I bought this because I figured I need to sample more Colorado beers. Very dark black with a tea colored head. Smells a little roasty and coffee. Taste is nice roasty flavor with some hop bitterness at the end. pretty drinkable but not my favorite stout."
"D - It's my experience that there are just some beers that look and smell amazing and then fall short on the flavor....like a straight A high school student who graduates at the top of his class and then becomes a pot-smoking booze hound and flunks out of college. This is one of those unfortunate beers. It's really not at all bad, I'm giving this a pretty high score. I'm just a little let down by the flavor."
"Boy, a tad more syrup would make this one a forever keeper. Pours a nice tan head and a beautiful looking body and an opaque black color. Smells and tastes of coffee, toffee, and chocolate. Not sweet at all. I like my stouts with a bit more alcohol, but this is a nice session brew. Washes down with nice malts and slight hops. A good overall brew."
"I tried this beer with a chocolate cake that had a raspberry filling. The cake was very sweet compared to this beer. The chocolate stout didn't hold up at all to the sweetness of the chocolate cake. The beer by itself, this might have been a different experience. I suppose this is a dessert beer, but don't try and pair it with anything TOO sweet or it will fail."
"D - This is a pretty good stout. Could use a little more chocolate taste to like up to its name."
"12 ouncer w/o freshnes information. Pours dark and stoutlike, with just a thin dark tan head and leaving just a scant hint of lacing, above a thin tiny bubble film. Dusty dark chocolate nose, dark malts and more dark chocolate up front. Respectable stout, quite dry in the finish, with some lingering chocolate sweetness. Not bad, worth a try for stout/dark beer lovers"
"Poursa somewhat thin black with an okay initial head that fades quickly. Smell is somewhat light, and mostly cocoa and vanilla. Smooth. Chocolate malt and milk chocolate in the mouth. Smooth with a slight roastiness and tiny bit of hop bitterness at the end. Smooth and somewhat thin mouthfeel. Not bad, but a little lacking in body and punch."
"Fort Collins Chocolate Stout pour a pitch black with a small tan head. Its smell is faint, but it does have a slight chocolate aroma that is rather nice. There is a hop bitterness that seems to take presidence in the taste; chocolate and malt flavors as well, but they don't stand out quite as strong. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth, making it very drinkable, especially if you like a bit of bitter taste to your beer."
"Light to medium bodied,a touch of grainyness. Very smooth,pleasing/enjoyable has a very good aftertaste,makes me want another. Not a great stout,but not a bad one either. worth a try."
"Overall, there are stouts out there that prefer over this one, but it's still excellent. Like I said before, I would prefer a thicker body, a bit creamier, but that's just me. Worth checking out."
"I wasn't a big fan of this beer. It looks good but its flavor is pretty short lived and its almost too dry."
"Poured into a glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer poured a dark brown, almost black, forming a very thin mocha head that quickly faded. The aroma is very light for a stout, mainly consisting of roasted malt and dark chocolate. Light, but what is present, is very inviting. The taste is a simple, yet pronounced combination of roasted malt and dark chocolate flavor. Nothing too complex about the taste, and not as chocolately as expected judging from the name, but still a tasty stout. The mouthfeel was very impressive IMO. Extremely smooth mouthfeel for a stout. Light bitterness allowing for a clean easy swallow. This is a highly drinkable and very sessionable stout. Full flavor and low abv. make for an ideal session stout. Overall, not a bad stout. As far as a chocolate stout is concerned, I would prefer Rogues Chocolate stout, but in a sixer form, this one is hard to beat. Yet another beer that I will keep an eye out for on my out-of-state trips. Recommended!!"
"D-I will be moving to something else."
"on tap at the brewery. dark rich ruby in color. very light on the flavor, i thought that this would stand up a little bit more than it did. light on the chocolate flavor, compared to other chocolate stouts. on a positive note, it is a good session chocolate stout."
"Pours a opaque deepest brown/black with a short-lived light tan head. Aromas are faintly of chocolate, black patent and chocolate malts and a slight tinge of low-alpha hops. Not extremely impressed with the aroma but it's not off-putting. It goes downhill from here, as after first sip I can only think of the wierd smokiness that is totally out of place. I did initially sense a bit of chocolate, coffee and roasted malts, but it's completely gone with subsequent sips due to the overwhelming smokiness. This would work well for a smoked stout or even porter. Mouthfeel is medium to thinner bodied with a carbonation level that might be slightly higher than it needs to be. The smoky flavor does not entirely turn me off to this beer, but it seems horribly out-of-place when the label says that what I'm consuming is supposed to be a chocolate stout. I've never tasted smokiness in any chocolate I've ever tasted... I seroiusly doubt I'd ever try this one again."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a mild creaminess to it. Very much like an Irish stout. Goes down very smooth, I could probably put a six pack away easily."
"A little shy of medium bodied, a bit creamy and smooth, easy to drink. Altogether a pleasant brew, a little lighter on taste and body than I'd prefer (kind of a chocolate stout 101) still enjoyable and well worth a try."
"All the initial impressions of this Stout are very promising. But as the procession of flavor and texture march across the surfaces of the mouht, the beer seems to waiver and then eventually fall apart, leaving the beer fractured with grain, astringency, and harshness. So it's a tale of two halves. I guess the key is to keep drinking so that the finish has no chance to make an impression."
"This is another solid brew from Fort Collins. Definitely worth a shot!"
"Drinkability: It was hard for me to put it down."
"D: This was the last bottle of the six pack, and the only one that I had. That doesn't disappoint me too much, this stout seems to fall a little short."
"I like this beer. It's not what I would expect from a beer labeled a chocolate stout. Maybe I got a super fresh batch because there was no sweetness to speak off. I would probably label this a breakfast stout if I were in the marketing department."
"Drinakability is fine, pretty sesionable stuff here, but lacks a certain depth and character that I may be searching for out of a chocolate stout."
"Wow. My first chocolate stout, and I must say, I LOVE IT!!! Let me tell ya first WHY I bought it! (I do like stouts, but never had the choc. variety) This is usually like $35 a case, or so, right? Well, my distributor had it on a ""sale rack"" probably 'cause the sell by date was getting close. SO, I got the damn case for $18.99!!! Miller Lite ain't that cheap friends!! I figured ""what the hell"" and I gave it a shot. SOOO glad I did. This stout is SOOO smooth, and wonderful. Smells of chocolate malt, and tastes much like that, although it has a roasted malt taste at the end.(Almost coffee-like) Very nice. This is SOO much better than Guinness, it's sad. I highly recommend, even if you just have a chance to get just one after dinner somewhere. It's a treat, and a velvety-smooth dance on the tongue! Nice job, Fort Collins. OH, it's not TOO heavy, a bit ""thin", but full of flavor...SO, one could polish off a few of these in a sitting without having to unbuckle your belt! Enjoy...cheers...AND SAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"Prune juice colored beer with a rich chocolate aroma.The taste is chocolate with a toasted aftertaste.Smooth beer that goes down pretty easy.I will buy this beer again and recommend it to my buddies.Overall a decent beer although 2 or 3 at a sitting probably will be plenty."
"12 ounce bottle, served in the new Sam Adams Boston Lager glass the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both low. The aroma is very malty, it smells like chocolate, roasted malt and some coffee. Taste is the same as the aroma, but unfortunately the taste seems a little weak to me. It doesn't taste bad, but I wish the taste was stronger. I figured with it being a ""chocolate stout", the taste would be stronger than it is. Mouthfeel is light/medium, it's a bit thinner than I'd like my stouts to be. With that being said the drinkability is decent, it is smooth and easy to drink. Overall it's an OK beer, but there's certainly a lot of better stouts out there."
"Drinkability: Fair. This is a great beer but chances are your only going to enjoy a couple before becoming overloaded."
"Good chocolate stout from a decent Colorado brewery. Looks nice, kind of a lighter colored stout, almost translucent black/brown with reddish highlights. Decent head, good lacing. Smell is chocolately with coffee and some hop flutters. Taste is bascially the same. Very drinkable for a stout, lackluster overall but decent. You can get so much better in Colorado. Too bad for Ft. Collins brewing."
"Another so-so Fort Collins product. No real regrets about trying it, but would not seek it out again."
"D: It has some really good points but fails to satisfy properly."
"Started out looking good: dark, nicely carbonated with full head. Nose was bland, and the taste was wholly artificial, much like a Sierra Nevada/Saranac dark. Thin, and just hard to drink due to a smoked bitterness. I want a refund. I will trade someone for some Corona."
"D - Smooth and full of chocolate malt taste. The full stout flavor is augmented well by the amount of chocolate tastes. This would go well with chocolate creme brulee. This is one that is definitely worth checking out if you like the flavor of chocolate in beer. I could probably drink at least a case."
"Light bodied, and somewhat fizzy. More body, and less of that artificial flavor would help this a lot."
"Great, easy drinking beer."
"Very easy to drink. A perfect session stout. Nothing outstanding but easy to drink."
"D: I could drink this all night. Perfect session beer for the end of winter."
"Poured a near pitch black with no head to speak of. Smell is rather un-appealing. Some scent of hops and some kind of bad lactose. Taste is pretty much the same, but the hops are more prominent. I think the biggest problem is the flavors dont meld very well together. Theyre both in your face and fighting one another instead of blending together and complimenting one another. Its very thin and watery for a stout. Good thing it is, because Im going to make short work of this thing just to get it over with."
"The chocolate reaches your nose as you raise the glass to your lips. It's authentic, like a chocolate bar, and at just the right level of aroma - it doesn't scream CHOCOLATE!, but it's definitely noticeable. And that's true for the flavor as well. All too often the chocolate is overdone in these kinds of beers, making a big splash at the outset, but then hurting drinkability in the end. That's not the case here. This is more of a stout infused with chocolate, as the stout character remains completely intact, hops and all. The chocolate just gives it a little bit of extra character across the middle, and a bump of sweet chocolate at the swallow. It lingers pleasantly in the finish, and then fades fairly quickly, leaving behind a mild, roasty bitterness. It's very nicely done! Very well balanced. It may or may not be the best chocolate beer I've ever had, but it is without question the most drinkable! Worth seeking out."
"Drinkability - easy to drink, would buy again easily"
"Taste: sweetness, richness, chocolateyness, full-bodied, full-flavored, with a good stretch of cocoa riding it out all the way through. Chunky, chocolatey, and very drinkable. An easy-drinking chocolate stout, not too thick, not too rich, but with plentiful taste. Won't knock anyone off their pedestal, but will bring deliciousness down the throats of any imbiber."
"D - a pleasant american stout. easy drinking - I paired it with indian food and was pleased."
"Not nearly one of my favorite stouts but still a solid one."
"Mouthfeel is ok. Thinner than I would have expected, and the carbonation seems almost too lively, but it's good and quite drinkable. Not a session beer, too sour I think, but a good brew nonetheless."
"Taste is more of roasted malt and coffee, no chocolate to speak of. I rather average stout, but since I like stouts I give a bump in review. Easy drinking, not at all sticky and good finish."
"Got this during my recent Denver trip and had it shipped back. Also tried at the brewery in the tasting room. Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating system into a pint glass. It poured a deep black even when held to the light. It had about a finger of tannish foam that settled to a nice thick constant foam with good lacing. The smell was chocolaty with a nice sweetness. It really reminded of a milk stout instead of an American Stout in smell. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy with a smooth finish. The taste was exceptional! From start to finish and front to back it had a great stout taste that for me nailed it. Some may want a more aggressive stout but this hit the spot for me. If this were available in Texas, I'd have a constant 6ixer around. Oh well, guess my buddy in Denver will be doing a little shipping for me. Highly recommend especially if you like milk/sweet stouts like me. (4.5, HR, T, Y)"
"Poured a very opaque black with almost no head that quickly diminished into a ring. The aroma was of roasted malt followed by some dark chocolate. The beer presented a good chocolate taste that complemented the basic stout roastiness very well. The hops were certainly doing there job in the background, present in a very undertoned way. The carbonation was mild and the beer was not to heavy at all for the style. This is a rather enjoyable beer, not the best, but definitely drinkable."
"Drinkability: Good but this beer is thick and creamy and I'll stick to just one for tonite."
"This was a nice surprise. I wasn't so sure at first, it seemed a little thin in several aspects. By the end of the glass, as it warmed up, it won me over."
"Drinkability is low because the beer falls apart. The carbonation is off, the mouthfeel is odd, and the flavor seemed muted (or at least affected by bottling). The label of this beer has the biggest font I've ever seen for the words ""CHOCOLATE"" and ""STOUT"" on it, and it seemed anything but."
"Taste is all over the place, I taste a definite hop bite first, then the chocolate, and then the malt. A little too ""all over the place"" for me, I prefer my chocolate stouts to be simple and to the point. Very unique brew, but not for me. Not that they sell it around my way anyway..."
"Overall impression: This is a highly drinkable stout with some very nice flavor complexities. A bit lighter bodied than I would expect for the style."
"Pours a three finger brown head that fades to a shallow layer leaving a good lace. Solid black color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Chocolate nose. Starts almost as a sweet chocolate that becomes more roasted, slight bitter aftertaste. Nice stout. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
"A rather tasty and quite drinkable stout. The label would lead you to believe that this would be more ""chocolatey", but that's not so. It's just a nicely done American stout, and I have no complaints about that."
"Overall, a very easy drinking American Stout."
"Mouthfeel is creamy as style should be and nothing cloying or sticky remains...only the hint of light chocolate."
"D - A nice chocolate stout if you like roasty. It could definitely use a boost in mouthfeel but I would try this one again."
"I would drink this again but not more than one in a setting. Worth trying but don't expect something great."
"Taste; in the flavor the coffee and roasted malts stand out much more than I was expecting, with the chocolate being more a complimentary flavor than a dominant one. I don't mind this as I usually prefer a more roasted flavor in my stouts. There's also a bit of a hop bitterness going on. Mouthfeel is very much on the thin side, but the drinkability is very good."
"I hate to be so hard on this ale, but this chocolate stout is awful."
"12 ounce bottle with no label. This one was grabbed out of a sixer and wouldn't you know that I got the one without any label."
"Looks better than it drinks, but doesn't drink that bad."
"Chocolate Stout is a good effort and is one that I have no trouble recommending to those who think they might like a hoppier than usual, full-flavored, light-bodied, session stout. I've only had three Fort Collins beers so far, but this one and Kidd Lager (a schwarzbier) make me think they're on the right track."
"Bottom line: A very nice Chocolate stout worth seeking out and trying."
"Dark Brown. Very aromatic and fairly intense in its nose. Roasted, black and chocolate malt waft up through the glass along with a touch of burnt fruits and smoke. Intensity is haulted once the beer is tasted but the malt flavor is still very complex and well balanced. Roasted and chocolate malts combine with a nice dry, cocoa feel and a touch of burnt dark fruits on the finish. Fairly good, but not great."
"Dark chocolatey black with a dense, soft cushiony head of cocoa brown. Nice retention. Nose is full of rich, sweet chocolate. Chocolate milk and even some bitter dark chocolate are there. Roasted, peaty malts as well. Roasted and toasted flavors up front. Soon turns chocolate milk sweet with a solid roasted bitterness background. Finish is more reminiscent of dark chocolate. Medium-bodied stout with perhaps a bit too much carbonation. Solid, but not great."
"Overall this is a beer worth trying but it isn't anywhere near the top chocolate stout...It's not a horrible beer by any means but it just doesn't grab me like I was hoping"
"Thanks for throwing one my way ZAP."
"Very drinkable despite all the flavors dancing in your mouth. Tasty beer could pass itself off as non chocolate without much trouble IMO"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice roasted, chocolate, and crystal malt scent that is sweet as well as dry and earthy. The taste is decent. It has an earthy chocolate and roasted malt flavor that goes down easy, but finishes slightly sweet and dry in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good brew, but not their best for sure. I think Rogue has the market for this style. I definately prefer sweet to dry and earthy."
"Note on stouts: I've got a lot to learn. I used to think that Guiness was it. Nope - there is a lot more to it than that. I hate Guiness, but am learning that there are many SWEET stouts out there that are just glorius. This is one. If you don't like guiness, but want a rich beer, try this - don't be afraid of the word ""stout""!"
"M&Dr - NIcely carbonated and a good medium body but i liked this brew less than my rating. I would prefer a bit more sweeter or chocolate taste on something called a chocolate stout, but as a stout it was tasty so i had to give it a 4."
"Pours thin but opaque with little to no head. Has a very nice roasty aroma. Flavor is clean and dry, with lots of pleasant roasty toasty goodness in the finish. Big beer snobs take note, this is much more of a dry stout than a big thick impy. I find it to be extremely pleasant and drinkable in the way a good, mellow dry stout should be."
"Re-reviewed 2/11/12-Newly available to our area. $16.99 for a mixed 12pack sampler. Calling a beer a chocolate stout when it contains no chocolate is called a cheap marketing gimmick. I stand by my original review. This is a flimsy stout, more of a porter. It's a bit too acidic and minerally, herbal hops, flimsy body, burnt finish. I have to add, now that it is available in our area, I'm not inclined to buy it again. There are much better porters (and stouts, for that matter) for the same price-point, and it doesn't taste at all like Bells Porter or what it used to be. Hrmmm."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a black color with half an inch of brown head. Roasted malt and chocolate aroma, with some unexpected ham-like smokiness. Roasted malt flavor, but I don't detect any chocolate. More smokiness. Slightly astringent. Some hops in the finish. Medium mouthfeel. Decent drinkability. I was hoping there would be more chocolate in the flavor, but this is a decent beer anyway. The smokiness sort of works."
"A final side note: A little later on, I nursed this while I ate a piece of chocolate cake. The coffee flavors and light hoppiness were a nice match for the sweetness of the cake...maybe this is one to enjoy by association rather than on its own."
"Overall, a fairly decent brew, but a bit thin and sour."
"Better warm. The champagne body is nice and gives the beer more heft. Not hard to drink at all."
"I used to drink HC Berger's beers in college and I'm glad he's back in business. This is a good beer from a good brewer."
"Pours a standard stout black with a disappointing total lack of head, a few tan wisps of foam are all there is to see here. Smell is actually quite nice - rich chocolate and coffee malt aromas with an underlying hop presence. Taste is another let down after the promising nose - some bitter burnt coffee, and a substantial hop bite. Quite a bit hoppier than I would have guessed, and hoppier than I like in a stout, let alone a chocolate stout. Mouthfeel is enjoyably carbonated and smooth. This is by no means a bad stout, but disappointing as chocolate stout. Worth a try if you like a hoppier stout though, just not sweet or matly enough for my tastes."
"First sip reveals a very silky smooth body with fine gentle carbonation. Flavor is deep chocolate sweetness and some roasted malt on the finish. There is a very faint grassy hop that pokes through the chocolate very briefly but is quickly overtaken by the chocolate sweetness. Very easy to drink and smooth. A nice beer. Not quite as thick as I would expect though."
"How a brewery can ace a smoked lager and completely fuck up a basic stout is beyond me."
"Dark brown out of the bottle, with a hint of red. Cocoa foam fades after a few minutes, leaving some lace. Nose is roasted grain, chocolate overtones, yeast and coffee. Initial taste is sweet, but finishes with a semi-sweet chocolate that is interesting. Just enough hops to keep this stout from being cloyingly chocolaty. Finish is nicely dry, leaving a whole wheat bread aftertaste. Carbonation is gentle, just right. Body is slightly thick, but goes down easy. A good comparison would be with the standard: Youngs Double Chocolate Stout  with which Ft. Collins offering compares favorably."
"It's quite easy to drink, but not exactly what I would call flavorful; it's fairly one sided. On the other hand, it's not bad, and this 6 pack will find its place."
"Overall, a pretty good chocolate stout."
"Its got an exploding stout head, tan like the bleached hair on Bacchus temples. The color of the darkest grains in the darkest wood. Nice fruit compote aroma, like a dried fruit wreath; dried pit fruits with the stems and pits and all. Holy shit, tastes like cocoa straight up. A dry hop vapor fills the mouth; dads burnt biscuits. The carbonation turns the malt from any fruitiness to melted bakers chocolate. A caramelized fruit quickly burns up in a smokey malt fire cloud, poof its gone."
