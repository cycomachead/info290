"Foam and coffee bomb. Carried a solid flavor despite the body but falls flat in some areas and the taste feels inconsistent."

"Pours a very dark brown with tan head. Coffee, tons of it on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with some roasted malt, raw cocoa and more coffee. Solid coffee stout."

"I’m drinking the nitro version of this right now. Nice dark appearance, but the beer is very sour. Not tasty at all."
""
""
""
"Very nice coffee flavored beer, but pretty watery and maltless to call a stout. The flavor and appearance are OK, but the palate is weak. Still, a pretty tasty brew which I would buy again."

"On nitro-tap at Bernie's in Waukesha, WI. Pours a dark brown color with a creamy light brown head. The aroma is rich with coffee. The taste is smooth and easy drinking. Robust flavors but not too heavy. Has a smooth, maltly flavor that is well-balanced. Nice find on nitro."
"Great beer, not necessarily an easy beer but definitely not pretentious. Great nose of roasted grains and black coffee. A bit more carbonation than expected but it worked. This is a great choice for the stout fan or coffee lover. Not a quaffer but not a one pint princes. Overall better than average for the style, an overall good choice."

"Pours a rich, creamy looking black with a large creamy deep-tan head. Very good lacing, very good legs. Thick wisps on the surface and medium collar. Aroma and taste are of very deep malt, burnt coffee, and dark chocolate. Full body and low carbonation lend to a great thick, rich mouthfeel."

"and completely satisfying drinking experience. Best beer brewed in the State of Wisconsin. Highly recommended."

""
""
"Id also lump this one in as being ""just for beer geeks"". Its too dark and roasty to be used as a gateway beer, and its aggressive carbiantion would not be helpful either...even for a coffee loving beer-geek initiate, I'm not seeing this one working as their first coffee beer."
""
"Would I buy it again? Absolutely."
""
""
""

"It's coffee with a dark malt backing."

"I was very disappointed in this one. I love coffee and dark chocolate, so I should I like this, but found myself wanting more. There are much better performers in the coffee stout arena, I recommend reaching for those first."

"O - Hinterland's Luna Coffee Stout makes a good first impression with it's aromatic scent of roasted malt and coffee but it's overuse is too much for such a small, light beer, overwhelming in flavor with little body or sweetness to compensate for the acrid bitterness. What I'd love to see in Luna is less roasted malt and more body-building, sweetness adding specialty maltiness such as caramel - it could add really nice balance and body without adding too much alcohol."
""
"I did not have the proper glassware for this stout, all I had was a shaker pint, with that said. A very dark brown to black color. A nice tall tan head that I lost about halfway through. Great lacing to the end. Smells obviously of coffee, dark roast coffee meets chocolate. Not as smooth as I was anticipating, almost lighter feeling than expected. Very good stout, was not disappointed."

"O- A solid stout for the price. Not the most complex beer for the style, but still a flavorful brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The coffee flavor is bitter. The mouthfeel is too thin. It's one of the poorer stouts that I have tried."

"D - Not bad, it is a very drinkable stout. The coffee character is pleasant, especially in the aroma, though it is a bit on the generic side. Overall, a mild, drinkable if unremarkable coffee beer."
"This was a decent stout but not quite what I expected. Somewhat watery but great aroma. There are much better values out there. A disappointment from Green Bay brewery compared to their IPA and Saison."
""

"Luna is a great, bitter coffee stout that pours out a deep brown. Aroma and taste are both coffee, coffee, coffee. Hinterland is new to my area, and I know freshness matters on a coffee stout, and this is one of the better ones I've had. It's seriously got an amazing fresh coffee taste, with a touch of hops on the finish. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"The beer as a stout in itself is pretty solid. Consistent flavor, though it's a bit thin and could have a heavier body. The coffee tones are minimal. On the front I get a push from earthy grinds, it seems, but there is little influence showing after the first second or two. As a stout, this is nice enough. But as a coffee stout, it'd be nice to get a bit more off of the coffee."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours dark black, some foam. Mostly settles but light layer remains. Rich malty nose, nutty, with just a hint of coffee. Dark chocolate too. The taste is much more coffee than not. Full & throughout. Roasted bitter close. Smooth mouthfeel. Need a little more balance."
""
""
""
""
"Not much else to say. Loads of coffee with enough other flavors going on to make it interesting. I'd do this again."
""
""

"Overall: Elements of this beer are excellent, but the taste is really not great and it really takes away from the good elements."

"16 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention is decent, and there's a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like coffee, roasted malt, and some bittersweet chocolate. The taste is the same as the aroma, it's all coffee, roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, and a nice coffee stout. I've been waiting to try this one for a while now, and I wasn't disappointed. I'm a fan of Hinterland's 16 ounce bottles, too. $9.99 a 4-pack."
"Final Thoughts: Be ready for a lot of coffee flavor and just enough malt to back it up. It's a little one-dimentional, but that seems to be true of most American Stouts. Would I drink it again? Probably not, there are too many other stouts I have yet to try before cycling back to this one."
""

"Overall- An enjoyable beverage which effectively combines both coffee and malt. Easily drinkable, could probably have more than one. A good beverage for those who appreciate both beer and coffee."
""
"O= Not overly impressed with this beer by any means. A solid coffee flavor and a pretty easy drinker. Basic beer and it tastes nice."
""
""
""
"O: The lighter-bodied nature of this beer makes it easy to drink, although it feels like a heavier body would make the flavors stand out a little more."
"16oz bottle, pours black with a huge creamy beige head, excellent retention and lacing. Aromas are roasted barley, coffee, chocolate. Tastes are coffee, roasted barley, chocolate, oats, and somewhat nutty. Mouth-feel is creamy, medium bodied, slightly chalky, finishes roasty. Overall, good example of a coffee stout, and better than expected."
"O) If your a lover of beer and coffee, this is a pretty good marriage of the two. It's definitely not in the same class as FBS, but it has good drinkability. Glad to recommend."

"This nitro tap version is better than the bottle, but not by much."
"O: Overall, a solid brew here. Real disappointing nose, but the taste and mouthfeel make up for it. Paired perfectly with a large Sunday brunch of bacon eggs and cinnamon pancakes.   I would drink again.  "
"Pours jet black with a tannish head. In the aroma, a small coffee presence to nothing. In the taste, a bit watery, and a mellow dry coffee flavor. A small bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry coffee in the aftertaste. Quite light across the board, and a bit astringent."
""
"O - Usually by this time of year I've finished off all of my coffee stouts, so it's nice once in a while to pull one out and remind myself what I like about them. This was good but not great; middle of the pack."
""
"O - Close, but falls a little short of being great. Just need to turn the volume up a little bit."
"Overall I think that it is a very good stout. I would have it again and recommend it to friends"
""
"Poure out of the tap with the beautiful nitro cascade that resulted in a super creamy two finger head. Nose was freshly pressed coffee with hints of dry cocoa and dark chocolate. Taste starts off with chocolate notes that is quickly replaced by a really nice bold coffee flavor - coffee is very rich and well accented. The coffee is mixed in with some dark chocolates and bitter cocoa. Really nice coffee beer. Mouth is creamy and smooth. Overall, really enjoyed this one - one of the better coffee beers I have tried."

"A bit one dimensional, but it is advertised as such. Worth trying, a pretty sessionable coffee stout."
"OVERALL: Impressive stout, strong coffee notes, and I can dig it."
""
"Oh bitter. oh so freaking bitter. Upfront with espresso beans and 100% Dark bakers chocolate. The base beer is a bit weak, All i get are the coffee and chocolate. Too bitter and unbalanced."
"Overall, it is an alright coffee stout."
""
""
""
"Maybe I got a bad bottle but this beer was disappointing. I was expecting a nice frothy stout but got a metallic taste instead. Jet black pour with a medium tan head. Smell is coffee and roasted malts. Flavor was not there, metallic and old coffee taste."
""
"Overall- Hinterland has brewed a stout that has coffee, coffee, and then more coffee to spare. I really appreciate this beer for that. However, the nose could be just as big as the palate. After all, one of the best parts of coffee are the aromatics. Lastly, beef up that body so that is not like downing a cold cup o' joe."
""
""
"Pitch black coffee hue with a big frothing tan head forming thick, this beer is pitch black it eats all visible light waves. Head leaves behind even patterned speckled lacing as it dwindles. Aroma dark chocolate, strong espresso dark nearly burnt malts. Black patent malt with some coffee notes. As it warms I get more creamed coffee notes in the nose, than I did initially out of the fridge. Dry roasted malts it's a one note flavor profile with dark nearly burnt old coffee water, the texture is so watery for a stout and the Luna Coffee mentioned on the label is lacking big time hints of dry roasted coffee but nothing like I've tasted in other coffee beers. Mild green fruity character shows up after a few sips even hints of sourdough bread, really a dry roasted malt fest. One pint bottles is pretty nice, a beer out of Green Bay, the Steelers would have won the superbowl if this beer were against any of the dark offerings from East End in the Burgh. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh with astringent dark roasted malts and coffee beans, leaves an unpleasant bitterness on the palate and for a stout this is a dry stout with coffee that is remarkably thin for being a stout. Carbonation is moderate doesn't add or take anything away from the party, this is my second straight coffee beer and I'm wide awake...guess what the coffee infused amber ale I just had sleighed this big brusing pitch black coffee stout from the North."
"Not bad, all in all. Smooth it out, balance it, get that astringent element out, and it's great."
""
"o- our first hinterlands beer. great move to keep it simple. would be a wonderful brunch beer."
""
""
""
"O- ok coffee stout, but needs more body to it."
"O- The big coffee softer stout flavor with is rich but not much depth and is a bit thin in the body with a nice dry finish."
""
"a nicely made stout for sure, but i might not have known this was made with coffee had i tasted it blind. its somewhat hard to determine whether the deep roasted coffee flavors come from the malt or actual coffee. a well made beer nontheless, glad to have tried it."
"Drinkability: It is some pretty sinister stuff, and I would not mind drinking it with that chick from the Aaron Rodgers / Discount Double Check commercials (that is, if she has time away from hanging out at her State Farm office)."
""
"O: This brew is pretty good. I don't know if it lives up to the standards of Great River's Redband Stout, or New Glarus' Coffee Stout, but it's a decent beer. I'm extremely happy to have tried it."

"Poured from a bottle into a stein, the beer is jet black, with a thick, foamy, dense, towering head of tan, big bubbled head. The aroma is bordering on a big bag of coffee grinds, with the slightest hint of dark chocolate hidden in there. Flavors are rich and strong, and heavy in (you guessed it) coffee. Dark roasted and slightly bitter, the coffee profile rides a somewhat creamy and sweet backbone of malt. Flavors are a bit one dimensional. Smooth bodied, but the overt bitterness gives it a somewhat dry feel, as well. Very dynamic on the tongue and in mouth. The head retention is impressive. The aftertaste is a mild version of the taste, with a slowly weening coffee profile. The finish is slightly drying, with a slight linger to the roastiness. Decent, but not amazing."
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is extremely burnt, like from too much black patent malt. It tastes like day old coffee (in a decent way). The body is light with a high carbonation. Very dry and bitter from the overly toasted malts."
""
"Pours almost black as night with a one finger tan head. Consistent lacing that stays on glass. Smells just like a black coffee. Tastes as good as it smells and looks. Coffee right up front with a slight after taste of chocolate. Perfect carbonation and consistency . Not a heavy stout. Can certainly drink more than one. Just a great beer. Glad I tried and will buy more."

"Enjoyable flavor, but thin mouthfeel detracted towards the end."
"let this warm a bit from the fridge. It poured with large, tan, foamy, frothy, sudsy head that soon settled out and some lace. Color is a clear (with a flashlight thru the narrow part of the glass) very deep, dark red. Aroma is cocoa, coffee, malt, roast, bit of fruit. Flavor is like nose plus more sweet than bitter and only a little carbonic tang. Finish is like flavor and has good length. A very drinkable beer - session. Not bad at all."
"Cheers."
"O - appearance and smell were great but the rest was just holding this back from being a world class beer. still its pretty good. (lowered to three cause i felt the taste was really a 3.25)"
"This beer started out strong but the taste and mouthfeel are just a little better than ok. I love the fact that the bottles are a pint, though. I'll have this again now that it's readily available in IL, but there are better choices just as available."
"If you haven't tried this one, go for it."
"Appearance of this beer makes you feel on 1st pour that you are going to get something a little more robust than you do. The malty smell also adds to that feeling. However, the head soon disappears and the feel is a little thin. The taste is good at the front, but for me lacks a little at the tail. Pint bottle poured to a regular pint glass. Not bad, but probably won't search this one out again."
"D - Nice aroma, slightly lacking flavor but still a solid coffee stout."
"Value-However, there are other coffee stouts that are just as good and sell at a lower price point, so I don't know if I would purchase this again."
"Super creamy and rich mouthfeel make this a go-to stout for me. Seek it out."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this isn't bad, but I doubt I would buy it again."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a completely opaque dark brown, almost black. Had a 2 finger head that was a nice mocha brown, that didn't cling at all. Reduced to about a single finger, but had good staying power. Poured exactly to the top of the glass. Aroma was strongly of used coffee grounds with a milky sugar hint. Flavor started off with hints of sour bitter, but as it rested those disappeared. It ended up switching over to a slightly water down coffee ice cream. Had definite lactose undertones. Felt good in the mouth. A bit acidic, but coated fairly well and just a hint of carbonation. Overall, a solid stout. Flavor profile wasn't my normal cup of tea, but I don't see any issues with this as a stout."
"Overall not bad, not great, the body and overall malt profile is too thin, but decent dark malt flavor and nice coffee addition."
"O: A notch below solid for a coffee stout. It's one dimensional with the best attributes being the appearance and smell. It's a bit of a let down after that, but still good enough to enjoy. I might buy again if I'm in the mood for a good coffee stout and there's not too much else around."
"O: Kind of lackluster and bland, unfortunately. Not really something I'd care to have again."
"New Edition to beer in NH, I brought a few bottles home today form a tasting at Bert's. Pours a dark brown almost black color with a decent tan head that has some staying power. Smells of coffee and roasted grains. Hints of chocolate, but the coffee aromas are strong with this one. Taste is again coffee and roasted grains, slightly acridic but overall nicely coffee'd. There are hints of chocolate, caramel, and licorice in here but the coffee overwhelms most of the flavor here. Medium body, light to moderate level of carbonation, slick oily acridic mouthfeel. The coffee is strong in this, but it still has enough other flavors to keep it interesting. I like it."
"D- A very decent beer but the body is a little disappointing while the flavor profile is a little one-note."
"O: good beer"
"Overall: The first one was good enough that I felt inspired to have a second and write a review. Not the season to fully appreciate this beer, but I'm looking forward to having one of these on a cold January evening."
"D - This is a very good example of a coffee stout, and my favorite so far from the Hinterland line. I'll be stocking this in my fridge in the near future!"
"SOLID, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"I'm just gonna chalk it up as ""unimpressed."""
"So overall, this beer is fine. I would probably buy it again but it was not my favorite stout nor even my favorite coffee stout."
"Another gift single, a decent beer but both Hinterland beers I've had are very light in body. This one gives you coffee but not much else."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is a pretty good coffee beer, but I found it to be a little too sweet for my tastes. Worth trying."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but I was expecting a much stronger coffee presence from a beer advertising itself as such."
"This is not viscous or syrupy in any way, in fact it feels a little on the thin side, but this doesn't detract from the fact that I could drink several of these. Not perfect, but I like it a lot."
"d- not bad, not the best coffee stout i've had but it's certainly drinkable, glad to have been able to try this."
"D: This is a very delicious brew. Probably wouldn't want to have more than two a night simply due to size, and this is definitely not a ""I'm gonna tie one on"" beer, but on a cold winter night, you can't ask for a cold beer to warm you up more than this one."
"Mouthfeel/DK: Medium full body. Lightly carbonated. Lightly acidid. Agreeable and enjoyable."
"Picked this up in Onalaska recently. Pour is dark brown, with a tiny bit of light peeking through the edges of the glass. No head or lacing present. Smell is mostly roasted coffee beans and not much else. There's a bit of roasty malt and chocolate in the background, but it's light. Taste is very nice. It's not a super charged up stout, but it's got great flavor, although lacking in body. Coffee is the dominant flavor, with bitterness mostly coming from that and the roasted barley, but it's balanced out by a mellow sweetness. All in all, this is tasty, but it's a bit ""watery"" and could definitely use a little more body. It's very drinkable however, and I could see myself drinking two of these 16oz bottles in a sitting and not getting sick of it like I would with other coffee stouts. Decent stuff!"
"I'd been wary of the bottles due to the lower fill level, but i'm glad to report the beer is perfectly fine."
"Mouth feel is a tad thin and there seems to be a generous amount of carbonation. I would prefer a little less fizz and a little more of a creamy texture, but that is a personal preference. Drinkability is high as long as you are a fan of coffee. Because it isn't as thick as some stouts, it is easy to plow through a bottle in a reasonable amount of time."
"D- Overall, this is a good stout but coca cola comes to mind, big time. I don't think I'd reach for this stout again because of this."
"Solid"
"Thanks again, Andy! You are a gentleman and a scholar. Good beer."
"Black color with one inch of mocha colored head that had decent retention before settling to a thin cap. Just a little lacing is left on the glass. Appetizing aroma of chocolate, coffee, nuts, and a little earthiness. This beer needs to warm sufficiently in order for the coffee flavor to blend into the beer. Otherwise it seems it is not a well intergrated ingredient. After the warming, the chocolate and coffee really come out and show off. A little earthiness from the hops as well. Bitterness seems to come from the coffee. Coffee aftertaste with just a touch of sweetness in the finish. Moderate body and a little overcarbonated. Otherwise this beer has a very good mouthfeel. A pretty good coffee beer and quite drinkable."
"Overall, a decent coffee stout. The other flavors could have been more rich to fill out the body. Decent drinkability."
"(D)- A no nonsense coffee stout with the flavor you would expect. I could see having a few of these around for Fall."
"This was my first beer from Hinterland and I was impressed. This had some rather robust and roasty coffee flavors but stayed well balanced with the sweetness and the nitro-pour and accessible body on this really kicked the drinkibility up a notch. Well done."
"Drinkability: Quite sessionable."
"Overall, a really solid ""local"" that needs to get out into the craft beer world. Thanks Brandon!"
"D: Overall, this is a very enjoyable coffee stout and it's quite easy to drink. Picked up a little too much roasted bitterness in the taste, especially on teh finish. But I would definitely have this again."
"D - I wish this had a bit more heft - it's imperative that you drink this at cellar temp or above, because it's nearly lifeless directly from the refrigerator. All in all, a good beer."
"single sent down south by the dirtman"
"Overall a solid coffee stout. Not world class but very drinkable."
"In all, it's a very nice coffee stout."
"drinkability: good"
"D: Very good. A very good stout. I wasn't expecting this beer to be as good as it turned out to be and it's always nice to be surprised. Would highly recommend this one."
"An excellent effort. A truly easy drinking stout. Going to be tough to find here in Chicago,but worth a look."
"I had this on-tap at the Hinterland location on Erie St in Milwaukee. Hinterland doesn't brew at this location, and the Hinterland beer served there is shipped down from Green Bay (as I understand it)."
"The best of the bunch of the 7 beers they had on tap."
"One of the best coffee stouts I have ever tried. So smooth and tasty. Perfect beer to replace coffee with during dessert at the restaurant."
"Now, if I were thinking, I would have asked if they did growlers, and brought home several pints of this delicious brew, or trade it to spread the word on this masterpiece."
"One of the best stouts Ive had from a Wisconsin brewery. Perhaps the best. Compares to Speedway in many ways."
