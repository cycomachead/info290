"Pours dark with a small head. Smells malty and roasted. Taste like the smell. A bit bitter though on the back end. Picked up some vanilla as it warmed. Love me some Bell's."

"Good chocolate coffee taste but has a subtle bitter aftertaste"

"This is a good coffee beer, it's definitely in the same league as Founder's Breakfast Stout in my opinion. Would have to compare them side by side to say which I like better."
""
""
""
""
"Will not seek our or purchase again."
"Truth in advertising here. The coffee aroma and flavor is HUGE, it's just not a very interesting or complex brew. A sticky-sweet aftertaste lingers. It's priced in line with Bell's Expedition Stout which makes it horrible value in comparison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied but light.  Perfect combo"
""
""
""
"Big coffee aroma and flavor. Nice thick texture. Good stuff."

"O: I really like coffee stouts and this one is great. I have had better, it's a little high on the bitterness, but still really good for my taste. I like it to have a more creamy mouthfeel but overall this is good. This could be a regular in the short winters we have in CA. If you like coffee stouts, this is definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
"Another excellent offering from Bell's."
"Overall: Good brew, and better served with dessert than dinner or better yet make this 12 oz. your dessert. Salud!"
"O - This is a stout made to drink, easy on the tongue, but not one to study.  The elements are clear and present, and yep, coffee is at its core.  Good.  Very good."
""
" - Poured into stemless wine glass on 25-Feb-15"
""
""
"Had one of the best smells of any stout I've smelled. Unfortunately, the taste fell short. Tasted very thin."
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black with a medium creamy head that lingers.  Has a nice malt and coffee smell.  Tastes of coffee with a little burnt chocolate in the background.  Mildly carbonated but very well balanced.  Overall, a nice stout that has a coffee lean to it, but is balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Strong coffee balanced by smooth chocolate.  Tastes better at room temp."
"A pretty good straight forward coffee stout.  Nothing overly complex here.  A bit pricey for a sixer.  Glad I was able to pick up one bottle to try. If you like black coffee give this one a try..."
"Nice hints of coffee aroma"
"The taste is really quite subtle for such a stout. The roasted/coffee flavor lasts a long time on the finish. Not sweet at all, but i have a hard time attributing that to hops, or to coffee, or to overroasted malt. Overall a very good stout, not sure it earns the elite stout price."
""
""
""
""
"The aroma is coffee and roasty, with a definite coffee character. The flavor has a touch of the coffee astringency with a big shot of coffee taste. Sharp and bitter on the finish, with a thinner yet distinct body. I feel like this is a wake up call in a bottle."
""
""
""
"Other than the Expedition stout, Bells has really disappointed me. This beer had a bit of a tinny after taste and was not as full bodied as I expected it to be. I usually love dark beers with choco/coffee notes, but this was a dud."
""
""
""
""
"Hopefully a bad batch/bottle because I poured it out."

"O: A bit too roast-forward for my taste, but definitely a drinkable coffee stout."
""
""
""
""
"If you prefer dark, strong coffee and dark, strong beer you will love this one.  It's like drinking your favorite stout with the smell and reminiscent taste of a deliciously dark roasted coffee."
"Another great beer from Bells.  I had two fantastic coffee stouts in the last week.  This one and the Whole Hog Expresso Stout from Point.  Well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: For the price this is not that good. If this beer was about the same is Two Hearted then I would consider it a better option. But, considering other breweries are putting out better beer in the same category for less money then this beer doesn't get the rating from me. I think price is what kills this one most of all, otherwise its an alright beer."
""
""
"The last two at freezer temp for an hour, not bad overall.  Low carb, bland malt taste and less than average  coffee flavor. Maybe i was unlucky"
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with tan head. Coffee, espresso, raw dark cocoa, and roasted malt on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with a nice lightly sweet chocolate and coffee note."

"Awesome coffee forward stout. Like the rest of bell's offerings, it is great!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is very very coffee forward. If you like coffee this is the beer for you."
"Quality beer, but way too much coffee...for me, at least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This goes dark chocolate and freshly ground coffee for broke! Not particularly complex but really nails the coffee flavors, and the chocolate flavors are a nice backing. If you're a coffee stout fiend, this is something to seek out. If not, grab a bottle anyways, just know what to expect. Very delicious!"

"Bell's Java Stout is a total delight – but only if you like coffee. And even then it's not a beer for wimps; you can appreciate the 7.5% alcohol of this stout even if you can't all its other qualities. This mouth-drying, fully saturated, intensely coffee-toned beer is a demanding ordeal so know that before opening. A caffeine addict's dream - no more needs to be said about it."
""
"Mouthfeel is medium weight. Overall, it's very nice."

"Expedition/Black Note > Java > Special Double Cream/Kalamazoo > Cherry"
""
"O: it's just ok it's another one of those coffee stouts that fresh it just overwhelms with coffee then it's like oh you wanted a beer hmm nope just coffee."
""
""
""
"O- Very nice coffee stout from Bell's. In my opinion, this is a very good coffee stout overall; it delivers very nicely on the coffee intensity with a proper roasted malt backbone to balance out the astringency of the coffee. A must-try for coffee drinking craft beer aficionados. [4.25]"
"Bottle from Maltitude. Pours dark black with brown head. Aroma of espresso, roasted malts, and chocolate. Taste is very strong of coffee and roasted malts. Like drinking warm, alcoholic coffee. Heavy bodied. Very good."

"3.45/5: Nice black coffee bomb"

""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid coffee stout that drinks like a higher ABV beer that'd I'd buy again."
"Overall, really great coffee stout - gives its obvious competitor (FBS) a pretty serious run for its money with its better-developed coffee flavors.  Really, really great."

"Nice deep chocolate color with decent head and lacing. Aroma is of sweet malts, coffee and chcocolate. Taste is a hit of roasted coffee beans right up front, followed by some sweet and bitter malts and then a kick of alcohol. Feels ok on the palate. The bitterness is just a touch too much, but overall, this stout balances pretty good"

"Bell's most underrated beer. Big coffee notes and very enjoyable"
""
""
"OMG such a delicious coffee stout!  Think, pungent aroma.  Heavy, but not gut-wrenching.  Nice balance."
""
""
""
"A winter seasonal pouring black and creamy with a nice tan head. Has a big coffee nose and palate with rich roast flavors accented by the coffee. Perfect balance between the coffee, the roast malts and the alcohol. Chewy with medium low carbonation."

"O- like the smell, taste was somewhat of a let down, didn't care for the bitter acid like finish. Coming from one of my favorite brewerys this was a disappointment. Maybe it sat to long in my beer celler, will get a fresher one and re-review at some point."

"The chocolate certainly is my favorite part of this brew. Malt backbone is rich, and the coffee isn't overwhelming for this non coffee lover."

"O: I would recommend this beer to any coffee enthusiast. I think the price tag is a little steep for what you're getting, but it is certainly worth a try."

"O: Its a decent coffee stout but I would have like to have seen a fuller body and more complexity in the taste and aroma."
""
""
"O: This is my favorite everyday stout. I love the coffee taste so if that is not your thing, this beer is not for you. If you are looking for a good coffee stout, try this beer and you won't be disappointed, it is what it says it is."

"Almost pitch black with a tiny bit of red around the edges and half a finger of khaki head. The nose is a bouquet of coffee shop aromas including coffee beans, vanilla, chocolate, cream, and roasted grains and malts. Coffee comes through big on the taste with a bitterness that is attenuated by a sweetness from unfermented sugars. I also get some milk chocolate and a nutty character. Feels nice and creamy on the palate."
"Overall: This is a good stout for breakfast on a brew day or on a golf course. It's not something to grab every day. There are better coffee stouts out there, this one is just OK."

""
""
""
""

"Overall - Delicious coffee stout. Quite reminiscent of the Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout. I'd buy it if it were available in California, but wouldn't trade for it again, if only because it tastes so close to the aforementioned brew."
""
""
""
"Pours a jet black with minimal head, but excellent lacing.  Smells like fine roasted coffee with dark chocolate.  Taste is similar of coffee and subtle chocolate, very roasty.  The mouthfeel is quite good, very smooth and full bodied.  I had this beer for the first time fresh and only thought it was ok, now having a bottle with over a year on it has really helped it to fill out.  It seems to have become much more smooth and rich, especially in the mouth feel.  I'm changing my rating from a 3.5 to 4.25.  I'm going to have to go find some more to stash away for a year or so."
""
"T/M: unfortunately, the taste misses the richness, being more a stringently bitter and less rich than expected. The tobacco notes are stronger in the taste, and not as smokey. However, I don't think the taste itself is far off, but I was hoping for more body in the feel. The beer feels a bit light on the tongue, although the tobacco and bitter coffee tastes do cling to the mouth in a mildly oily way."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I like this quite a bit better on-tap than out of the bottle. Not one of the best coffee stouts out there but it's worth going for if you've got a hankering for coffee and it's the only one on the list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love this beer... my absolute favorite shelf stout, although I wish it was a bit easier on the wallet. Pours dark brown with little head, great coffee smell. Taste is all coffee, all day... some chocolate and vanilla but coffee dominant. Moderate mouthfeel which suits the flavor appropriately - not too heavy, not too thin.. just right. I love coffee stouts so this beer is amazing and am actually surprised it doesn't have higher review scores. Seek it out if you haven't already tried it, another great Bell's offering."
"Another fantastic beer from the gang at Bell's Brewery! Puts most other coffee-infused beers to shame. Easy to drink (and enjoy). The price-tag might be a bit of a turnoff for some, but I promise that if you like coffee and beer (and you do), this is definitely worth making it rain in the checkout line."

"O- The further along I go the more I like it. Possibly due to temp but I allowed it to warm up a bit from the breezeway. This is good but in direct comparison to Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout it is a close second. Sure don't hate it!"
""
""
""
""

"O - Nice coffee forward stout. For a stout this is a very easy drinker. Recommended."

"Very assertive Stout, if I had to describe with some precision with one word, it would be obviously coffee."

"Overall: solid coffee stout, I was expecting more body which maybe I shouldn't have. You can drink a couple of these in a row. As usual a solid bells beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very pleased by this, and another example of a great stout done by Bell's, who has yet to disappoint me in that category (though I have yet to try the cherry stout). At a decently high 7.5% ABV, the alcohol burn is non-existant, making this one hell of a fun ride for both coffee stout newbies and veterans who are looking for an easy to drink one. Only real complaint is it's expensive at roughly $14.99 a 6 pack, the value compared to Founder's Breakfast Stout isn't quite as great. Still a highly interesting beer though!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very good stout. If you like coffee stouts, this is a very good one. 7.5 abv but doest drink like it. Very smooth, before I know it, the glass is empty. Will defiantly drink again. The only real critique I have is maybe too much coffee, but what do you expect from -java stout- . Bell never seems to dissapoint. Michigan knows how to deliver stouts and porters."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a rather an exceptional coffee beer, one of the better ones available. I'd probably buy it again, but I might think twice considering the 17$ a 6 pack price. This super fresh...I'm imagining a 4.75..."

"O- overall a very very good coffee stout. I love coffee stouts and this one is a perfect example of what one should taste like. Nice coffee taste that isn't over powering but is definitely there, nice sweetness, perfect mouthfeel, 7.5% that I have no idea where they put, I can drink a few of these bad boys. Cheers!"

"Well the label of this beer pretty much says it all. Java, java, java!!! If you like coffee flavored stouts, this is the beer for you. It pours smooth and dark with very little foam, which is a nice deep brown. It smells like drinking a beer in a coffee bar and tastes like a nice chilled cup of dark roast coffee. It leaves your pallet clean without a bitter aftertaste and leaves you wanting for more. A great coffee stout."

"Overall (4.25): Another example of Bell’s hitting something of a standard out of the park (kind of like Two Hearted). It’s just so easy to drink and so approachable for having such good, full, rich flavor and feel. Honestly, this is an underrated beer, without a doubt, and I will most likely be seeking this out again in the future."

"DB- Not sure if this bottle is too old or the batch is messed up. The sour isn't mentioned by many others which makes me determined to find more and taste it again. A very nice coffee aspect, probably only for coffee lovers because of it's strength. Will try again because my faith in Bell's and my love for coffee stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A solid coffee stout that is easy to drink. Really looking forward to Bell's coming to Long Island."
""

""

""
""
""
"O- It's pretty good, but I have been drinking nothing but top notch RIS lately. I am not trying to be a smartass, but it is hard to evaluate"
""
"12oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a pitch black color with a good head and nice lacing. The nose is pure coffee grounds, love it. The taste is also strong on the coffee, almost too much so. I love strong coffee so I enjoy the flavor, but I would prefer it be balanced with something else. The mouthfeel is thick with a lingering coffee bitterness. Overall a good coffee beer that I'd like to see with some additional flavors, like chocolate, smoked malt, or barrel aging."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Heavy and bitter, but almost watered down at the same time. Nevertheless, it is enjoyable, and a great substitute for your morning coffee."
"O: Too much coffee for me."
""
""
"O: A terrific stout that does not disappoint with the coffee flavor! A little too much bitter coffee and not enough roasted malts for me, however still a good representation of a coffee stout."
"O: This is definitely a sipper. It's a tad too sweet for me, as I tend to like bitter coffee stouts, but it's still pretty awesome. This is definitely for those whole prefer sweeter coffee stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, a tasty beer but a bit one dimensional. Still, it delivers on what it promises."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great cold weather beer- really glad I picked up a bottle. It might be a little too straightforward for me to enjoy drinking many back to back, but picking up a sixer to start the winter seems like a good start."
""
"Overall, a tasty coffee beer, but admittedly one-dimensional. Certainly one that I'll probably pick up a bottle or two each season, but nothing mind-blowing. There are other coffee stouts I'd gladly pick up first based on price and taste. Still a solid offering from Bell's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As advertised, plenty of java. This beer is straightforward and in my opinion nails the coffee stout. It is just shy of Imperial status, but on the bigger side of American Stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"SIDE NOTE: just realized the ABV of this is not apparent in the profile of the beer what so ever, drinker be warned this one is sneaky."
""
""
""
"O - A great stout to have on a cold, snowy late afternoon."
""
""
""
""
"It's not really for me, still better than a lot of beverages I've had, but if you're a coffee fanatic this might be one for you. I can't mark it down too much because it still seems like they hit what they were aiming at with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feels soft, and besides a light bristle from a light but coarse carbonation, almost velvety. Easy to drink due to relatively low alcohol presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really solid. I'm glad a gave it a shot. One of the better Coffee stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Reminds me very much of Founder Breakfast Stout but without the complementing sweet chocolate notes and creaminess from the oatmeal. This delivers on the coffee and a great example what midwest brewery stouts are about, big flavors. IMO there aren't many breweries that can hold a candle to Bell's stout lineup. Kinda wish they would swap out the Double Cream stout they put in Black Note with this."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"The feel is rather dry, not astringent, but almost like a coffee without any additives. It has a neutral carbonation level and really moves through the palate easy."

"An extreme coffee stout in my eyes, needs some more flavors to balance it out."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - coffee beers aren't really my thing. I love a few of them, but this thing is what it says. It has a crazy amount of Java character and is more coffee flavored than stout flavored. Still a very well crafted stout that I'm certain a lot of people would enjoy. Definitely one that can be broke out during a big breakfast on a cold winter morning."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- glad I tried, not my favorite by far. Glad I have 5 more to trade away"
"Bottled 8/30/13. Coffee is the predominate flavor with a medium body. A heavier texture and additional malt sweetness (higher malt bill/flaked oats) would improve this beer from very good to outstanding. The coffee needs balanced with sweetness. To taste what I'm talking about, pour a half and half of Java and Expedition - the result is an OUTSTANDING coffee stout."
""
""
""
""
"I for one seek this out every year, it's too good to pass up. Drink it fresh to really enjoy the coffee flavor."

Better than Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout. Maybe not for everyone, but if you like strong coffee flavored beers Bells hit this one spot on."

"O - A very good coffee stout, but was hoping for even more from Bells, probably the best craft brewer out there. It has grown on me as I work my way through it..."

"an extremely pleasurable beer, rather heavy on the coffee. don't be subtle, go for it! the one pours real dark, but looks more like good rootbeer when held to a sunny window. the head is an inch tall, but fades to a thin film in about a minute. plenty of yeast particles settled out on the bottom of my glass. the nose is bitter acidic coffee and burnt barley, super robust. almost like a pot of cold coffee a few hours old, and there is a slight smoke character too. the flavor is balanced coffee until the finish, when its flavors and its acidity take over. normally I don't like acidity in coffee beers, but in this one it provides a nice contrast to the big pillowy soft body and rolling carbonation, its needed. the alcohol is maybe a little higher than it needs to be, burns slightly with the coffee, but this is your hangover maker and killer in one bottle, probably better as a first beer than a last beer in a session. another solid bells brew by all counts."

"O- this is one of the most coffee forward beers that I've tried. Unfortunately I think I overpowers some of the chocolaty roasted malt flavors. Still quite enjoyable and a must for those of you that like to drink your coffee dark roast and black. Coffee flavors are about as strong as a Sumatra coffee."
""

"Holy cow. This is a tasty tasty beer. It's kind of like taking espresso, melt in a chocolate bar, pour in a bada$$ stout. Then take it, boil it down, put it through a strainer. Then take it and throw in some carb tablets or force carbonate it. THEN you pour it in my glass and then I drink it! That's a nice nice nice beer. Yah, it's a big beer but I love that i can find it in a 6 pack."

"Poured this American Coffee Stout from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This poured a black color, produced a thick tan head, excellent retention and tons of lace left on the glass. The aroma of the stout consisted of roasted grain, and fresh roasted coffee. Medium bodied, a foundation of roasted grain, coffee, sweet malt, apple- slight touch of bitter hops. Overall, this is a nice session beer, I have sampled better Coffee Stouts but this one is enjoyable."

"Pours deep brown/black. Nice big kahki head on this one. Spicey coffee wafts off the top like my morning stop for caffeine. Hints of bitter cocoa. Lacing present as the head recedes. Very nice all coffee flavor. Wow this is great. Almost like a cold cup of Joe here. Light to medium mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation. Right on what it should be. Very nice. Could drink this all night. Must pair this with food sometime."
""
"Dark brown, almost black with about three fingers of light brown head. Dense and creamy retention, great lace. Nose of fresh roasted coffee beans, earthy and herbal. Taste has a whole load of roast and more coffee beans. Still some earth notes and chalk. Perhaps even some dark chocolate. Palate is lighter than I'd like, body is disappointingly thin although it appears to full up as it warms. Roast lingers for quite some time. Coffee quite prevalent here, does well for a straight up coffee stout."

Very nice coffee/espresso flavors and smells with a similar bitterness to it. Definitely one that I would come back for again and again. Pretty easy to drink with the well hidden alcohol and the lightness in the body."

"Nice black with with a brown, mahogany tint. Smells like a cup of joe with roasted malts. Taste really coffee like, but not sharp or crisp on the coffee. Bitter and roasted finish.

It only has a little bit of the sweet chocolate and vanilla flavors that can be found in stouts, but it has a ton of roasted malts and coffee.

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 9/10/2012. Pours lightly hazy extremely dark brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big roasted coffee beans, espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malt, light char, caramel, and light herbal. Damn nice aromas with big coffee presence and nice background malt balance. Taste of big roasted coffee, dark chocolate, espresso, roasted malt, light char, toffee, caramel, and light herbal hops. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, light char, caramel, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Nice flavor balance and complexity with plenty of coffee flavor; very nice malt/bitterness balance; zero cloying flavors noticed after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent coffee stout! Plenty of coffee flavor with nice malt flavor balance; very smooth to drink. Really enjoyable offering."

"Note: I had a beer like this last night, Dark Horse’s Perkulator dopplebock. The two were very similar in their presentation of coffee, but I must say, Dark Horse wins this one. I’m not sure I’ll buy Java Stout again."
""
""
""
"This is simply a straight forward coffee stout. It has solid flavor and great drinkability. Ultimately, there is little beyond balance that separates this beer from the other coffee stouts out there, but for anyone who likes the style, this is a must try."
""
"O: I'm not a huge coffee person, but I tried to review this objectively anyway. I think it is really good for a coffee stout. It has a vivid coffee aroma and taste. The beer also looks wonderful in the glass. I was disappointed in the mouthfeel."
""
""
"Pours a rich blackish brown color, with an off white light tan head. Strong nose of perfumy alcohol, roasted malts, and just a touch of coffee. Smells like an aged Russian imperial stout. In the flavor, roasted malts, black acidic coffee and a touch of dark soy sauce. As it warms some vanilla notes come out and the firm maltyness takes over. Cocoa nibs, black coffee , smoky malts and alcohol make up the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is full bodied, well carbonated and smooth. Overall, this coffee stout is pretty good at about a year old, but since its coffee bill is so strong I recommend consuming it fresh , the flavors don't really improve with age."
""
""
""
""

"Medium body, decent carbonation, chewy and lingering on the tongue. Definitely a quality coffee beer that doesn't become too sweet or too bitter. I'd definitely drink this again."

"O - Now this is coffee stout! To me, It is better than the Expedition and Double Cream. All three are good, but this one stands alone... This is what I want in a coffee stout"
"This is a pretty good beer. It pours black as ebony with no head, but some residual lacing. Smell is overwhelming coffee. Mouthfeel is great with a surprising amount of carbonation for a beer of this type. Taste is what a stout should be. I love that strong black coffee taste as it is the dominant flavor. I highly recommend this one if you are a fan of stouts!!"

"Bottled on 9/14/11, so....its basically a ten month old coffee stout. 12 Oz bottle poured into a clear plastic hotel cup. Dark black body with an ugly greyish mocha head. Solid lacing and retention. Smell is roasted malt and black coffee. Taste is roasted malts, light salty smoke and smooth coffee. Its not a dark roast, or an espresso. Its just a basic, run of the mill black coffee. Very light bitterness, finishes cleanly with lingering coffee notes. Its simplistic, but very effective. Mouthfeel is silky and smooth. Even aged, this beer has a solid coffee presence. Damn tasty!"

"Thanks to EgadBananas for this bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Pours dark brown with a two finger length, creamy tan head that dissipates slowly. Some ruby red can be seen along the edges of the glass. Some sticky lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. There are aromas of dark roasted barley malt, strong coffee, and mild chocolate. It smells sweet. The taste follows the nose. There are strong flavors of coffee and roasted barley malt. There's chocolate and molasses. The flavors are full and robust. The alcohol is not present in the flavor. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. The beer is smooth and creamy. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer. While the body is on the lower end for imperial stouts, this is by no means a point against this beer. Try this one if you can find it."
""
""
"I'll just say it: this is not an imperial stout. It kind of approaches territory of an imperial stout, but it doesn't entirely fit the bill. If you go into drinking this thinking that it is going to be a heavy imperial stout, you will be disappointed. If you're expecting a regular American stout with a strong coffee flavor, you'll won't be disappointed. This beer is actually quite sessionable. I sessioned it last night, as a matter of fact."

"12 ounce bottle poured into a wine glass. The label on the bottle has a funny cartoon character. Anyhow, the body of it pours a near black with very little hear, a ring soon sits atop. Smell has dark chocolate and coffee. Taking a sip of this and I taste roasted malts, quite a bit of dark roast coffee and some chocolate. Mouthfeel is velvet-like with a bittersweet finish. This is fine double/coffee stout and I am glad that I picked this up a few weeks ago when I was in Philly."

"Another treat Kevin hooked up! Poured from bottle to a pint glass the beer is dark black with brown edges in the light with a decent 1 finger mocha colored head has decent retention and lacing. The nose is coffee dominated. Behind the coffee is roasted malt, baker's chocolate, and just enough alcohol warmth to remind you this is an Imperial. Similarly the flavor is dominated by coffee from start to finish. The roast, chocolate, and mild bitterness play 2nd fiddle but also provide a nice flavor. Full bodied and well carbonated. Finishes dry with a lingering coffee flavor. Overall, this was a treat. A bit too aggressive with the coffee, in my opinion, but still good!"
"Poured from bottle into snifter at a good temp. Very nice looking beer. Rich deep brown pour with a nice 2+ finger mocca head. Adequate spotting and decent lacing throughout. Head faded pretty quick. Nose is huge coffee upfront and a hint of burnt toast/malts on the finish. A bit of a stale old coffee smell which was distracting. Taste follows the nose with that heavy coffee punch initially and then fading to some butterscotch and dark fruits. Not a huge fan of the big coffee stouts, but this was not too over the top. Burnt taste on the end. Decent hop/malt mix. Feel was nice and creamy. Not too thick, but plenty enough carbonation to get at the tongue. Overall- A nice take on the java/coffee stout style. A little too much burnt/stale coffee for me, but not a bad beer. Would hit another again. A little dry toward the end-"

"One finger slow rising medium brown head, fairly slow dissipation with some lacing over opaque dark brown body, no visible rising carbonation. Big ass coffee hit in the nose, dark roast Sumatra with some Peaberry undertones, chocolate subsumed with a bit of citrus hops far in the background. Taste is coffee up front, big ass dose, faint cocoa nibs in background, some citrus but pushed far back into background. Mouthfeel a bit on the light side of medium, surprisingly light, good effervescence leading to bitter coffee-forward finish, Java the Hut. This isn't one of Pint Please favorite beers, but as far as coffee stouts go, this is pretty damn good."

"O: i find this to be a terrific brew and Bell's has done a nice job of balancing out the chocolate and coffee notes. Those subtle hop and alcohol create a bit more balance and helps draw the taste buds away from the coffee grounds.This one is kind of steep on the price, but I find it worthy of a re-purchase."
""
"Appearance is a pitch black color with a generous tan head. Scents of coffee and cocoa are pleasant and strong, with a stronger lean toward the cocoa scent than coffee. The taste follows the nose, but with a bit more coffee taste than cocoa. Solid mouthfeel. All around, a good stout, especially if you like coffee."
""

""

"The aroma of java is strong and the drink and aftertaste matches it ten-fold, which is not true among most others of this kind. If you like stouts and you like coffee and are interested in breaking into this kind of beer, then this is a good place to start."

"O - Yet another winner from Bell's, and a stand-up coffee stout with a well hidden ABV kick. Easily drinkable and nicely balanced between the bitter and sweet. Highly recommended."
"O- This is the most ""coffee-forward"" beer I have tried. Most other coffee stouts I have tried use the coffee to blend in with roasted malt and other flavors. This one hits you from beginning to end. Not necessarily a bad thing, but different."
""
""
"Overall - A very enjoyable stout which is true to its name as a ""Java stout."" A little more bitter than Founder's and lacking some of the latter's complexity."
"Overall – This is one nice affordable coffee stout. One to try over and over again and have on many of occasions."
""
""
"Taste/mouthfeel; good full flavor of espresso and semi-sweet chocolate in the front before finishing nice and clean the 7.5% abv is not in evidence at all making this an easy drinking stout. Bell's has always been solid when it comes to stout and this does not disappoint."
""
""
"Overall - A Very good coffee stout, better than average but not mind blowing. This beer is damn tasty."

"Pours a midnight black with a one-finger brown head. Goes away without making too much of a fuss. Wow. Has as strong of a coffee nose as any stout I've tried. Pure, strong, espresso and dark roast coffee beans. Coffee tails off in the flavor, but still pronounced and stronge roasted coffee notes...not a sweet coffee like many other coffee flavored beers, but a black, espresso vibe. Nice milk chocolate sweetness to kill some of the bittering coffee at the finish. This is a beer for coffee lovers, not lovers of coffee flavored things. I can see how it might be off-putting to some, and has a one-note flavor profile, but there is definitely room for this coffee specialty stout."

"Overall - I seldom rate coffee stouts very highly. This one was no different. Above average as it had no offensive flavors, but nothing terribly interesting."

"I think I'm finally finished with this beer. I've tried it several times, at different temperatures and after different meals. Now I've let one sit for a while. I have given it every opportunity (since I respect Bell's Brewery so very much) and I am convinced that I just don't think it stands up to some of the other coffee stouts I've had. It's good, but I can't quite put it on my top shelf."

"overall, a very enjoyable stout - more so, obviously, if you love coffee. not the best i've had but i would certainly not be averse to more."

""
""
""
""
"Finally getting down to re-trying this guy and putting my thoughts to words. Posterity? Maybe... Anyway, this stuff pours a very dark black-brown with very deep ruby highlights, all topped by a finger of dusty tan foam. The nose is primarily a playground for nutty coffee, though a touch of roast vainly attempts to peek through the bean-y fog. The taste continues this trend, though the roast, still relatively faint, stands a bit stronger than it once did (nasally speaking). The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Overall, a one-trick pony that has honed his trick decidedly well. Not necessarily top-tier, but close to it."
"O: I gave this beer straight 4's. It has a fantastic coffee flavor that is at once intense, and still lingers very nicely. A well done beer. If you have ever had chocolate covered espresso beans (good ones) that is the closest thing to describe the flavor on this one"

"Java pours deep and dark, 2 finger light tan head, nice to look at. Head was gone quick along with light lacing. Smell is sweet, but all coffee. Taste is all roasted coffee beans, black, earthy. A *touch of maltiness peaking in the back, dry java finish. It's definitely all java here, in and out. No sign of alcohol or hops. Drier, thinner stout body. Overall it's not a bad beer, not my style, though."

"This beer pours a dark brown almost black color with a 1 finger tan head. the smell is coffee loads of it and a little sweetness and roastiness. the taste is a lot of coffee with a little roastiness and sweetness, but not well balanced between beer and coffee. the mouthfeel is sa little thinner than expected and well carbonated. overall this is a good beer, not something i would go after again with the other coffee beers out there."
""
"O- A good coffee beer with a huge coffee flavor, but there are better coffee beers out there. Very happy I got to try this but I wouldn't take the time to hunt it down again. Kind of reminds me of Péché Mortel, but the coffee beans used in Java Stout are not as good."
"O: A very nice beer, not sure that it fits in with the larger RIS, but standing on it's own as a stout I really like it. Not complex, but flavors are rich enough to make up for it."
"This one is opaque and almost completely black, tan head at the corners of the glass. Smells of chocolate and strong java coffee. The smell reminds me of coffee from Starbucks. Tastes of strong coffee, some chocolate, some sweetness, followed by a strong bitter coffee flavor. Mouthfeel is heavy and smooth. Nicely carbonated. I love having coffee stouts on brew day! Although very nicely done, I prefer FBS."

"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Medium-low carbonation. Seems a bit more like beer coffee than coffee beer, but I liked it just the same."
""
""
""
"Massive coffee bomb on the tongue as it rushes to the back of my throat. Espresso galore, lingering bitter coffee as it descends. Surprisingly thin body detracts from the experience. Absolutely imbalanced, but I happen to like it."
""
""
"Pretty sure this wasn't an old bottle so I think Bell's just overdid it on this one. May have gotten a little cocky, ha."
"Overall - Not a fan, the coffee flavor is overboard, and not very flavorful. No balance, just java bomb, and not very good java at that."
"One finger head in a pint glass, this is a near black brew with some retention and little lacing. Smell is coffee and burnt malt and the taste follows the nose. Medium body with little carbonation it is dry and bitter with some vanilla and chocolate notes. A very nice brew."
""
"Overall - Really a nice and balanced java stout, lots of roasted coffee and perfect dryness to keep you sipping."

"Overall: Almost too aggressive on the coffee. I can only imagine what fresh must do. I'm pretty sure it's coffee with a time lapse malt/alcohol tab that dissolves over a 2 week bottle condition. Nice, but definitely a bit overbalanced on the coffee."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is malty and full of coffee. It also has some caramel and vanilla but just a touch. It is robust and reminds me of a heavily roasted bean. Truly enjoyable."
""
"First review for me. Can't get over the overwhelming taste/aroma of generic coffee beans. Seriously, mouth feel appearance etc. are all put aside due to being a coffee snob as well. The taste was like drinking a mixture of some crappy coffee like ""choc full of nuts"" and carbonation. If you like drinking gas station coffee then you might enjoy the heartiness. The texture is actually what I would expect from a full-bodied brew, and low head with slow tracing would all be appealing if I didn't have to deal with aforementioned crap coffee taste and aftertaste."
"D: This is a sipper, I love to examine how this beer changes over the course of an hour or two."

"UPDATE - waited another 4 weeks to try another one of the original 6 pack and time has been good to this brew. The alcohol bite is entirely gone, nice chocolate and lightly bitter coffee notes, medium mouthfee and a scrupteoush beer. This is a definate A brew 	once it has bottle conditioned for a while (5 weeks+ in my case)."
"Overall I really enjoyed this. A lot like Founders Breakfast Stout in my opinion. This should be enjoyed late afternoon or after dinner but if you dare you could surely replace your morning cup of joe with this. A must try for a coffee stout lover."

"O: This beer = pure awesomeness. I love coffee beers, and this beer has what I need. Igredient heavy and well balanced. One of the best coffee stouts out there."

"This is a very decent beer if you love super dark roast coffee and slightly burnt notes in your beer. I prefer other coffee stouts, but I would never turn this one down. It is simple, but it makes up for that by having a robust taste. If you love dark roasted coffee, try this beer out."

"good beer"
"O: I was hoping this beer would taste better fresh, but I was wrong. It tastes like burnt coffee with some faint dark chocolate flavor. I'm not sure what Bell's was trying to do here."
"overall: Not my cup of coffee i guess. Not a bad brew by any means but not up to the aforementioned coffee stouts imo."
"What a nice stout!! Pours black with a nice thickness, creamy espresso-colored head. Smells like roasted malts and spent coffee grinds, in a good way. Taste is smooth and surprisingly not bitter. Earthy hops present. Nice and full, coating and oily. This is good stuff."
"Overall a solid coffee lovers stout. Me thinks they should have put, ""Coffee brewed with beer"" on the lable."
"12oz bottle pours a pitch black heavy looking liquid with coarse finger of mocha head clinging to the snifter. the aroma is a coffee explosion, burnt chocolate, roasted coffee beans, tobacco leaves and a hint of sweetness. the taste is of bold guatemalan coffee bean, a light hop presence, a very bitter, dark, charred chocolate taste finishes up. not a lot of alcohol presence and the body is less filling than what meets the eye but medium to full, overly carbonated which creates a smoothness equivalent to the back of a fat chicks legs, rocky.... like.... mogul. just not very smooth perhaps age could round some things out and calm the coffee down. this beer is not very good and bells continues to disappoint :( thanks for nothin D! ill crush FBS"
"Overall this isn't too bad, but it's surprisingly a little underwhelming and if I could describe the beer with one word it would be ""flat"". Out of the bottle this really didn't deliver, but I could certainly drink this again, but probably not at the price they charge for it."
"Mouthfeel is just above medium bodied, with slightly above average carbonation. Not quite smooth enough for me. Not all that easy to drink either. Overall, a decent stout. I'm going to let a few of these sit for a while and see how they turn out. Another decent stout from Bell's, but still haven't seen the great one. Not worth the $16 a 6'er, but oh well."
"Its called Java for a reason."
"Dark brown color. No light penetrates it. A quarter inch of tan foam floats atop the beer for a moment, then dissipates leaving thin lacing. The nose is coffee and milk chocolate. Taste is big coffee up front followed by silky milk chocolate and a mildly roasty malt profile. More coffee in the finish, which is dry with a slight diactyl aftertaste. Feel is somewhat full bodied with a low but appropriate level of carbonation. A nice example of a coffee stout. Perhaps not as complex as some others, but a solid offering nonetheless. Glad I had the opportunity."
"Of all the coffee stouts I have tried, this one retains its coffee flavors among the best of em and for the longest time which is what ranks it in the upper echelon of the style in my opinion."
"Like chewing on a coffee bean whilst stout beer coats the mouth. And no ordinary coffee bean either ... a deeply roasted bean. It smells delightful ... coffee aromas abound. But the taste is less satisfying. Pungent flavor ... an unbalanced attempt at a java brew."
"Overall: This is great beer, lots of flavor, easy to drink and not hard on the wallet. Bells makes good beer and this is no exception."
"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch dark khaki head that settles to a small cap. Very thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and cocoa powder. Taste is of dark roasted malt and dark chocolate and cocoa dusted coffee/espresso beans. A mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a smooth mouthfeel with a nice light carbonation. Overall, this is a very good coffee stout and probably one of the best I have ever tried. I'm very glad I finally got to try this one."
"O - The 7.5% isn't really noticeable. Pretty easy drinking. Hard to not compare this with FBS. Falls short of FBS in pretty much every category, but still a well made and enjoyable stout."
"O- If you love coffee stouts, this is the place to go. It's one-dimensional, but I love the coffee aspect so I found it to be a tasty beer."
"I rather like this one! When it was cold the roastiness was a little overpowering - almost smelled like burnt coffee - but as it is warming it's developing into something really delicious. Roast coffee, with an almost Kahlua-like richness. Really good."
"Black in body with off white head that dissipates. Aroma of chocolate, coffee with milk, cinnamon and some earth. Tastes of chocolate, dark coffee, some strong cinnamon, cola and booze. Heavy in body with medium carbonation. A mediocre coffee stout with unbalanced flavors."
"This beer is as advertised. I don't know if I can really fault it on the taste for tasting like black coffee... I will say that I thought it was a little one dimensional but definitely not bad tasting. Its spot on as far as coffee goes... The rest of this beer was spot on. Definitely worth trying, especially if you are a coffee lover."
"This is an almost beer. Almost great. It's like an ingredient away. I still recommend it, I will drink it when offered, I will even by it from time to time, but candidly this doesn't even scratch the surface of my great stouts list."
"O: A very solid choice, one I wish I could have again. My only regret is that I have yet to find this on tap, as I believe it would be even better."
"O: A decent coffee stout."
"For me a better than average coffee stout. I cant really pick out any aspect of it that blows me away."
"The mouthfeel is a little thin for an Imperial Stout, but I almost feel like Coffee Stouts are a style unto themselves, with abv's all over the place. So, I won't hold this against Java. I'm a coffee lover so I like this one very much. Hope to get my hands on as many as possible while they're available."
"Pours an opaque dark brown, almost black color with a thin tan head. Oddly enough, I am getting both burnt and sweet notes in the nose. There is definitely no sweet flavor here - it is wholesome stout bitterness with a trace of coffee. The finish is a bit flat, but the overall flavor profile is robust. This fits my general feeling about Bell's beers - they are solid and well above average beers, but none are extraordinary."
"O: The refermentation (or whatever) makes this beer pretty undrinkable. After a few sips, the novelty of a sour coffee beer wears off. I tried this beer for the first time a few months ago and wasn't impressed. Now, the second time around, it's even worse."
"D/O- I feel like Java Stout could benefit in using higher-grade java. Weird thing to say but I think I prefer my coffee stout homebrew better. It's really a like it or leave it, polarizing beer...as can be seen throughout these reviews."
"O- not a bad stout at all, so i gave it a slightly higher overall to pick it up a little. Good brew, but pretty one dimensional"
"O: Reminds me of a stale French Press coffee. I was not crazy about this. I am looking at my past reviews and it looks as if I don't like coffee stouts, but I swear here are quite a few that I do like. This is just not one of them."
"Most beers try to walk the tightrope between one flavor and the next, greatly concerned at the prospect of an overbearing flavor. This is not one of those beers! Although I generally like beers, I had no idea as to just how strong the java flavor of this one would be. I generally like milk and sugar with my coffee, admittedly, but I can tolerate coffee black from time to time. The Bell's Java Stout, however, has a stronger coffee flavor than coffee itself! So my recommendation: if you are a coffee fiend, this may just be your holy grail. If you are beer/stout fiend, though, you may want to give this order a second or third thought..."
"This is a drinkable stout, especially if you love quality coffee. Goes well with desserts."
"Overall, pass just a huge miss as far as coffee beers (or any beer for that matter) goes. I don't plan on finishing this even though it's already mainly gone. Wow, Bells continues to disappoint me beer after beer..."
"Smooth mouthfeels. Reminded me of an oatmeal stout as it warmed. Decent drinkability."
"This stout poured out as a deep rich brown color. The head was light brown on top. The lacing wasn't too great on this one. The smell of the beer had a good amount of coffee on the nose. The coffee was probably the entire aroma that this beer had in my opinion other than the roasted malts. The taste of the beer wasnt too bad but I felt that the coffee flavors were a little weak when comparing the nose. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry. Overall this beer was pretty good, I'd drink it again."
"Overall - Like I said, one of my favorite beers out there right now and easily a top coffee stout. I would recommend this one strongly to anyone looking to try Bells or Coffee Stouts for the first time."
"One of the better Bell's beers I have tried, and a solid coffee stout in general. I have, however received an infect bottle of this before. Worth trying, not something to go out of your way for though."
"O: I really enjoyed this one. I tend to like beers that go along with their genre with maybe a little something extra and though this wouldn't necessarily be a go to beer, it was overall excellent."
"My pour was even more impressive in its result than Bell's Extra Special Stout (the last one I reviewed prior to this)! Two dense fingers of deep-tan head with excellent retention. Color was an ebony black, allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose was REALLY roasty, reminding me why I shied away from it lo, those many years ago. It was somewhere between Colombian and French Roast in its roastiness and both of those are still ones that I add to a simple Original Blend. Either one on their own and I could be hooked up to a generator for the day. That is to give you an idea of intensity, on top of which, we are talking 7.5% ABV. This is not a beer for the faint of heart! Mouthfeel was unbelievably full and creamy and one of us had mellowed in terms of taste. Either it had come down or I have elevated or perhaps both, but it was still pretty intense in terms of its dark-roasted coffee flavor and the difference was that I found it very enjoyable. I think that I was really on a hops kick back then and this just did not taste ""right"" to me at the time. The lacing that was beginning to appear looked like it would take a jackhammer to remove later. Finish was like finishing a demitasse of cappuccino. I kid you not, you had really better like intense coffee, not just simply a cuppa joe or this is not going to be your cup of tea, so to speak. Oh, my heart ..."
"Drinkability: A readily available brew that has the depth and character to hold up the best of them. Great stuff!"
"O - Ump, ok"
"O: This one isn't try to hide what it is, but I think it might be a little confused. As a coffee lover I am obviously drawn to strong coffee flavors. When I choose to drink a coffee stout its my way of combining my love for beer with my love for coffee. In this case I find myself wanting to finish this one off so I can open up a beer..."
"Overall, solid stout but not mind blowing. I let this one warm up thinking I may pull more flavor characteristics, but it remains the same - dark chocolate dominant. Not much complexity, just a really good tasting stout."
"MO- I.m not a great fan of Imperial Stouts but this one really drinkable and not just a cold weather beer."
"O - A very focused coffee beer. Good quality coffee. Tasty beer. Would have this one again for sure."
"O: This is a very good stout that I look forward to every year."
"O: All in all, this one came out of left field for me. Phenomenal coffee stout! So creamy and bold with the flavors, yet all flavors work so well together. Once of the best coffee stouts I have had. If you like stouts with big flavor and coffee, then this is right up your alley. Way to go Bells!"
"Overall: A great coffee stout. Coffee flavor dominates and is very tasty, even for someone who is not much of a coffee drinker like me."
"Pours dark coffee color with about a finger and a half of tan foam. Minimal lacing. Smell is foremost a medium-roast coffee with some nice roasted chocolate malt notes. The coffee comes to dominate the taste, although I still get a hint of malt, with a pretty smooth, slightly bitter, long finish. Alcohol is not noticeable. Carbonation and body are both appropriately medium. Overall, this is an easy drinker, a good coffee stout where the emphasis is on the coffee."
"Cheers!"
"Consumed on 11-07-2010"
"Certainly a full bodied beer. Smooth/syrupy finish that is pretty nice. Ironically sort of a sweet/smooth finish, pretty nice. Pretty drinkable, but more of a slow sipper. Heavier than I expected for the ABV, but it's good. Overall a pretty good beer, didn't hate it, but only go for it if you're in the mood for a coffee beer."
"O- It is a good imperial stout and has a nice coffee flavor as the name suggests and a nice bittereness as well."
"Overall: This guy is a nice after dinner beer. I'm having it as a night cap and am really enjoying it for such an occasion. This one is probably a little too aggressive to try as food pairing, but standing alone, it is a nice, robust brew."
"Would make a great pairing to any dessert."
"O - A good enough beer but lacked complexity."
"O: A solid coffee beer. Like many beers of this nature, you do have to enjoy the coffee flavor, but if you do, this is a winner."
"Overall - I really liked this beer. I was looking for a good solid coffee stout and I found it. Delicious."
"Its a good beer if you like coffee. Interesting brew only had one other of this style and do believe I would buy one again"
"For those who like coffee, you'll love it. For those who don't beyond anything but a nuance, I can't recommend this to you."
"poured into a pint glass, almost pitch black in appearance with a big fluffy khaki colored head. smells of rich roasted coffee with hints of mocha. tastes like a cold cup of not too bitter coffee. has a rich creamy smooth mouthfeel. overall one of my favorite of this style."
"Pours into a snifter dark black with a huge fluffy tan head. Standard for the style. Nose is espresso, cream and roasted dark coffee beans. Taste is actually very smooth and well balanced, the coffee flavour is mild yet remains subtly bitter. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. A decent and well executed coffee stout. One of the better medium roast profiles."
"Overall: I love this beer! :) It has all my favorite qualities of a stout while the bite keeps every sip from getting boring."
"D - very easy drinking and full flavored stout. And even with this being half a year old is remarkable."
"Many coffee stouts that I come across share the same problems with Bell's Java stout, where the coffee is so aggressive it is unpleasant. Too bad, I like Bell's."
"O: Fine coffee stout, especially for 40/raining Opening Day for MLB. Great in-between beer, got enough flavor to sip, but find myself gulping it too."
"Overall: This one is a solid A+...I haven't had a much better beer."
"Drinkability is good. Mouthfeel makes this a slow-drinker but it is tasty and very enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel is very creamy and feels just great going down, and the drinkability is exceptional. I really had a good time drinking this one, this is just a great stout. Bells just has hit after hit with regards to stouts, they're quickly becoming one of my favourite breweries."
"Over all a good beer, far short of beers such as founders breakfast stout, but if you want a bit more espresso this might be the way to go."
"A perfect beer. Pours black. Smells of coffee and chocolate, which is a benefit for those that are coffee and chocolate lovers. Tastes of malts, coffee and chocolate of course. Smooth overall feeling. Drinkability, just like my coffee can't stop at one cup, well this beer I can't stop at one bottle"
"to me, coffee stouts are very hit or miss. this one doesn't quite get it. I'm not going to ding a beer that's in a style that I'm not wild about but this one seems to miss something on the aftertaste."
"O - A nice surprise here. This goes down REALLY easy. And that is on top of an Old Raspy! Very drinkable. It tastes good and the lingering flavors of coffee and chocolate rival many I have had. At 7.5 ABV...it is well hidden."
"O - I was expecting more from this beer. I felt the flavor was lacking for a coffee stout. It could have used a more intense roastiness and although the coffee smells and flavors were definitely there, I would have preferred a fresher taste. Instead I felt as if I was drinking a cold, watered down irish coffee. I will not seek out this beer again."
"Batch #8158. This beer is over 4 years old but there is still a lot of coffee flavors in here. A bit boozy but seriously delicious. i don't drink a lot of coffee but this is a coffee lovers dream Can't speak for it fresh but with four years on it there's still plenty of carbonation and deliciousness in this glass. Bell's always kills it."
"D - Not a session for sure."
"Mouthfeel is full and thick, but strangely a bit watery for brief moments. Drinkability is excellent due to the awesome coffee flavor being well balanced and not too bitter at all. Bell's clearly aims for one thing in this beer, and they achieve it well."
"O: I try this one year after year and I just can't get a taste for it. I want to cheer for it because of my love for the brewery, however, I found this to be a very rough beer session..."
"This is where the beer falters. The flavors needed a bold feel, yet it feels a bit thin. Little creaminess and even a bit oily. Maybe it was an old bottle. Still a decent beer."
"Drinkability - Decent brew, but not very complex in taste."
"It seem the tartness is out of character for this beer and was most unappealing to me."
"D - Drinkability is low. Unfortunately for the look and (first half of) the smell, the taste and infection just destroy this. Didn't even get halfway through before throwing in the towel. I will be looking out for a fresh batch of this, though, as it does seem to have promise."
"Drinkability - If you love coffee in your beer, this one is for you. Nicely balanced as compared to other coffee offerings I've had. Not something I would make a habit of having, due to the intense nature of the coffee addition, but I can appreciate the depth needed to make this more than a ""one-trick-pony""."
"(109th)"
"The flavor sticks strictly to the coffee end of the equation, not even much sweetness to balance. Chocolate does emerge, especially on the finish, but it's heavily balanced toward the Java. Pretty bitter, but not much in the hops direction. Body is middle of the road, could definitely be bigger for my taste. Pretty smooth, but the carbonation works too hard up front. Definitely a coffee stout from top to bottom, and as a daily drinker of black joe, I enjoy it very much. Not for everyone."
"D - I'm drinking this pretty quickly, this is a very tasty coffee stout. If you're a coffee fan this is a must try!"
"Smooth, rich and chewy. Low effervescence with a full body. Some coffee(burnt) shows up in the aftertaste. A thoroughly fine brew in all regards."
"D: This is okay but the roastiness is way over done. It does not come close to FBS or Wake n' Bake."
"Overall, a good beer, since I love coffee. Good sipper, with nothing you would not expect from a coffee stout. Though just like with coffee, one is usually enough in a sitting."
"Drunkability: Great beer but not sure on how many I could drink wihtout switching to something less distinct. Pepper taste gets to me even tho I do love it."
"D- 4 I don't usually want to have multiple stouts in one sitting, but I think I could get there with this one. Its really not all that heavy for its style and I enjoyed its flavor. I'd recommend trying this one to anyone that loves java and brew."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A pretty good coffee stout. I just drank a FBS prior to this, and I prefer it, but this is still pretty good."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good coffee stout. It had all the flavors that I have come to expect from this style but was better balanced then most and the flavors never felt artificial as they sometimes can. After all is said and done I would say this is the second best coffee stout I have had with Founders Breakfast Stout being slightly better, but not by much. I was pretty impressed with this brew and I don't know why it took me so long to try it. This beer has definitely earned a place in my fridge, keep it up Bell's, you guys rock."
"Drinkability: Not something I'd drink more than one of in a sitting, really."
"The feel is extreme smoothness with a hint of carbonation, with a strong taste of coffee (no surprise) and dark chocolate. Because of the almost syrupy feel, the aftertaste lingers for a very long time. This seems to be an excellent after-dinner drink but, because of the heaviness, has limited drinkability. Still, it is an outstanding coffee stout."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - An addictive taste, as coffee often is. Very bitter and tart in your mouth. I'm glad I finally decided to pick this up; it is quite a different stout because of its sour prune notes."
"D - I'd call this highly drinkable. It tastes good and doesnt have any truly objectionable qualities."
"D- The alcohol in this beer is not really the problem. Coffee overload is really what knocks down the drinkability a half notch. This is a nice coffee beer but if you have a couple in a row it will crush your palate in a coffee mess."
"I think Imperial Stout is a wrong declaration of style for the record."
"D - easy going down, nothing super-special but nothing bad, either"
"This one is good save for the ashy/burnt taste. If I could get past that, this would be a fantastic beer. But I can't get past it."
"To compare with coffee, this is an espresso shot straight up, not a caramel mocha-chino latte. There are a lot of intense flavors being thrown around which is fun, but quite trying. The bitter roastiness, the coffee, the sweetness, the booze, it's all there and dancing around in some crazed circus. Overall, a lot of fun for your palate, but not an everyday-er."
"drinks okay. nothing special, unfortunately, though its heavily charred/ash/burnt character sets it apart from some others of the style. pretty good."
"D - This beer drinks pretty good. The flavors are intense though so one is enough to give your buds a ride."
"D - This is a pretty drinkable stout. The flavors aren't too over the top, but the beer is filling. I'll definitely grab some more this winter."
"This beer combines my two loves, beer and coffee...very dark black in color, nice tannish head that stays around, lacing is average. Overall very pleasing in appearence. Wow..nothing pretentious about this beer...the nose is heavenly with tons of strong coffee..mouthfeel is spot on for the style and apv...taste is what I expected and wanted, burnt chocolate,coffee,nice bitterness, great finish..."
"Enjoyable offering from Bell's. If you're looking for a stout that has real coffee flavor that's not over the top, this is a good option."
"Drinkability -Smooth creamy stout with and easy finish, may not be my favorite stout but would definitely drink again."
"Overall, this is a decent coffee-infused stout, but a bit more restraint with the coffee would do this brew much more justice."
"D: One at a time. This is a specific beer. Very nice, appropriate for the style. I can't imagine what it's like completely fresh...."
"Pours as black as coffee with a thin brown head that dissolves into almost nothing except a thin ring around the glass. The smell is almost all coffee: roasted beans, burnt grinds and cold coffee. There is also a little stout aroma in there: dark fruits, some almond and roasted malts. The flavor just accentuates all of these aromas. Espresso, black coffee, roasted malts, some leather, but also a bit of cinnamon and a vague sweetness. The coffee flavor is very strong, but not necessarily the best coffee flavor that I've had in a coffee stout: it tastes a bit like old, cold coffee. The finish is pretty mild with a faint roasted bitterness. However the aftertaste is really nice and creates some nice eructations. It's a pretty good coffee stout, but I've been spoiled on the likes of Breakfast stout and Berkshire Coffeehouse porter and this isn't quite in their league."
"D- Much better than I thought. Not a coffee drinker, but very easy drink. Great for a cold winter's night or early in the morning when standing in line for a beer release!"
"D- Overall a pretty decent brew that gets better as it warms."
"D: its good, but im ready to move on. good example of the style, but i usially want to move on after having one."
"D- Very easy to drink, but it just tastes like coffee."
"EDIT - I always meant to try this again, and thanks to salukialum, I was able to get a bottle since I moved west. On 27 January 2012, almost a year to the date after having this the first time, I can't say I was wrong about it. The body still seems thin and the coffee in the nose just seems stale and musty."
"D - Moderate drinkability - this beer almost needs something to compliment or contrast it, perhaps some ice cream. On its own its just a little too direct. ABV is up there but well hidden."
"D- Great coffee stout"
"I'm not a big fan of coffee, and this one has plenty of it. Very little malt or hop flavor. Rich bodied with a suitable carbonation. The aftertaste is like drinking coffee. Not my cup of tea (pun intended)."
"Definitely worth a try (especially if you love coffee and beer), but its just not for me."
"D- I could and would drink it for breakfast lunch and dinner. Instead of my morning coffee at work just crack one of these. I love iced coffee so this cold works great. Heck it might be worth a try warm."
"I love coffee and that's what this beer is. But it stays safely within drinkable bounds. But for those who sugar up their coffee in the morning, this stout will be too offensive."
"The flavor is big coffee and roasted malt flavor. The coffee flavor is strong and bitter. Hits big up front then mellows considerably into more of a porter like beer. With a high drinkability. The nose is much stronger than the flavor which is nice because the nose is huge on this one and I think too much coffee would be overpowering. All and all a good beer."
"Perhaps my favorite coffee stout, this is truly a benchmark for this style. If you haven't has this, pick it up. And, it cellars well; this review is from a beer that cellared for a year and tasted every bit as good, if not slightly more mellow, than it did a year ago."
"The first time I ever tried this beer I was much earlier on in my ""good beer"" journey, and I have to say I was not a fan. It pretty much just tasted like cold coffee and since I like my coffee to be 99% beer, I did not seek this out to buy it again. Having it now I can reach through and pick out the beer qualities and find it to be a nice complex coffee stout that should please coffee and beer lovers alike."
"D- Easy as pumpkin pie... or is it apple pie? Cherry pie? For a seven a half you don't feel it. I love this beer. I wish I had been drinking this all season long instead of staring at the price tag. Hella worth it.. Lieutenant Worf it even."
"Overall, this is a very good coffee-flavored brew, and I'd drink it again, however, I can't imagine drinking more than a few in a single sitting. I think if the coffee was toned back just a tad it'd be more ideal for drinkability."
"Overall, Java Stout is just another good beer from the guys at Bell's. I would like to see a bit more diversity and complexity in the flavor for this to be a really good stout, but as it is this was a pretty enjoyable bottle."
"D-wow this is quite a heavy beer. it took awhile to get through because of this. picks up no weird tastes but i found no reason why i'd ever want to try this again."
"A coffee lover's beer through and through, possibly my favorite from the brewery thus far. Hopslam is too limited, Oracle is even worse - and too boozy, Expedition is great but not as tasty as this!"
"D-Very balanced for such a big beer which I like very much. Often the sweetness and bitterness fight for control and the coffee can seem like a sideline player. In this brew coffee is the star and she is a diva!"
"Drinkability: As a coffee lover, this has a strong appeal for me, and I find it very easy to drink. People who do not enjoy coffee as much will not like this stout."
"D: Wow! What a good beer; coffee + stout+ Bell's = awesomeness"
"Verdict: One of the boldest most intense stouts that I have ever had, but impressive all around. If you enjoy java, coffee or espresso as much as you enjoy beer, there's no doubt that this will fill your cravings. Everything tastes pure and real and the end result is a well done coffee-heavy beverage. Definitely worth a try for everybody. Bell's Brewery did very well for this one. A- (4.1)"
"This coffee stout appears dark brown in color, with a thin, eighth inch layer of beige head. The aroma is primarily of coffee, with a bit of roasted malt lingering behind. This is a decent brew, but not as full-flavored as I would prefer. The coffee and roasted malt are certainly there, but could be fresher, zestier, more aromatic, flavorful. The feel is medium bodied with adequate carbonation. This was an OK beer, but not among the elite coffee stouts."
"THis is one of the best Coffee Stouts Ive had. The problem is it drinks like coffee. A few cups and your done. If you are thinking about Coffee IS, Give this one a go. You wont regret it."
"D - maybe two before moving on."
"Drinks pretty easily, smooth, tasty, clean and moderately complex. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I'd certainly get it again sometime."
"Will not buy again."
"This is a nice, roasty stout. I don't like coffee but still enjoyed this. The only issue I could find is that the mouthfeel could be a bit heavier and creamier."
"Beer is medium to light in body with some malt leadoff and nice coffee flavors in the late/mid palate regions. The finish is nice and mildly dry and mildly bitter. No lingering aftertaste. Pretty decent beer."
"Notes: A pleasant surprise that I have seen on the shelves for years and finally tried. Due to price and availability I would buy this ahead of Founders Breakfast Stout!"
"It feels about average going down and while it tastes good it's not great. Best part is the label. And the label is nice. Like a big nosed coffee cup."
"drinkability - flavorful and big on coffee, even refreshing for a imperial stout...!"
"The is no doubt this is a coffee stout your sense are assailed by strong coffee the minute the bottle is opened. Over all not a bad beer the coffee is a little stronger than I'd like but it drinks easy. I'd be more impressed if I'd never had Pipeline porter that is made with Kona coffee which was smoothe as silk. Bell's is still one of my favorite even though this is not a home run in my mind."
"M/D-thick and rich. Filling. Unbelievably delicious. Easy to drink, wish I had a 6'er and not a single. Smooth, with a touch of a bite. The coffee in this one is a perfect match for the beer. Bells never disappoints and this one is no exception."
"My verdict here is that it has a great aroma and starts decent enough...but in the end, I'm turned off by what I'd consider to be ""off flavors"" for a stout."
"D: Don't drink this if you don't like coffee! Great beer, but it's heavy heavy. Very good, but I don't see myself drinking more then one or too fast."
"Dark tan 3/4"" head at pour. Dark black color, literally as black as coffee. Powerful coffee aroma. Could be some chocolate hidden in aroma, but smells exactly like wet coffee grinds. Heavy, silky cream texture to mouthfeel, almost syrupy. Huge coffee flavor with some small chocolate notes, bold even if you are a regular coffee drinker. Nice dark lacing on the glass. Warmth brings a nutty note to aroma and a little more sweetness to the already sweet flavor. Dry, roasty bitter finish that lingers in the aftertaste. True to it's name in every form. You definitely have to like or be able to tolerate coffee to drink this one, basically like drinking cold coffee. Coffee being the dominate factor in this one does give much room for anything else."
"D: enjoyable beer...definitely in the top for coffee brews!"
"This beer pours the darkest of browns on the verge of black with the lightest of light khaki heads. It smells of very, very rich roasted coffee beans and has chocolate aromas as well. The flavor essentially mirrors a chocolate influenced java coffee. It is very rich and very chocolaty. The flavor is exceptional. It drinks very smoothly, full bodied and rich. The content creeps up on you. It is very drinkable and a delicious beer. I'd highly recommend it."
"Drinkability: great stout, easy to drink. Not too thick or overwhelming. Great balance. This is one sexy brew."
"I could see getting this once a year and pulling one from the pack on occasion. Great if you are in the mood for it."
"Bell makes some great beers and I think they delivered with this one. If your in the mood to try a good stout, try this one, I don't think you'll regret it."
"D - Good drinkability. As much as I love coffee the flavor is somewhat intense. A great beer for coffee and beer lovers."
"D: with more carbonation this beer would be significantly more interesting."
"D: Sort of an out of whack coffee stout if you ask me. I do fear most that the bottle may be past prime, but I've also encountered other carbonated coffee beverages with this same issue. At any rate, the 7.5% ABV, which carries a bit of a stinging, hard swallow. That combined with the sour coffee flavor doesn't score it very high with me."
"D-Pretty easy, though not in mass amounts due to the added flavors of the coffee. With that, however, this is a very pleasant beer to enjoy when looking for something in the realm of coffee beers."
"The feel of this beer is a bit big and full with both hands. it goes down with a warm, smooth feeling and is a drinkable, flavorful stout that feels like it has my number. A really well built stout."
"D: Drinkability is good, and even upping the ABV of this brew to really give it ""Imperial"" status would be ideal."
"Pours a deep brownish black color with a thick off white head and a good amount of lacing. Smells of coffee and tasty black chocolate. Tastes a little of smoke, caramel, coffee, dark chocolate, sweet malts, a little hops and hints of vanilla. Mouthfeel is medium with a little carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"This beer pours a blackness with a tan foam and good lacing. The smell is clearly really very coffee-like. Perhaps caramel, but really it's just espresso. This beer tastes like coffee with hints of vanilla and for a coffee stout it's rather nice, but I would like more complexity on the palate. The mouthfeel is oddly smooth for coffee being involved. This is a drinkable beer, a great standard coffee stout, but as i said it's just standard. No complexity to make it wonderful."
"First one of these that I've had - been wanting to try this one for a while. Hard pour made for a large head that took about 10 minutes to go away. Very dark with a smell dominated by the coffee. The taste was also dominated with strong coffee, so much so that nothing else made it through at first. But the coffee is slightly off tasting as if the pot sat out a bit too long and oxidized. As the beer warmed the malt and a bit of chocolte barely make their way into the flavor but still mostly slightly stale coffee. The mouthfeel was solid and not overly thick. This is one stout that I could probably have 2 and not be overwhelmed by - I just don't know if I'd want that much coffee flavor (especially when it just seems to have a little missing in the flavor)."
"The flavor is coffee with a hint of tanginess. I don't really like it, i seem to be getting a lot of misses with coffee beers lately."
"Pours out a rich coffee black color with a beige head. Head dissipates into a thin foam (crema?) with some lacing already happening to my glass. Smell is interesting, black coffee, some liquorish, tobacco smoke and bittersweet chocolate. Very complex smelling, you can keep smelling it and picking up other whiffs, other subtleties. It is quite nice, now for the taste....wow, big espresso middle, with some dark roasted chocolate malts and bitter oily aftertaste. The taste of this beer lingers on the palate for quite a long time, like a rich demitasse of espresso. I would rate the mouthfeel as being exactly as it should be, but the rich oilyness affects drinkability a little bit. Overall it is a quite nice although I am thankful it is available in singles at my local liquor store. I could imagine this beer would be a bit much in a full six pack, would take me a while to drink all of them, but would be great sitting in the back of the fridge aging a little. I think Java Stout could also make a great nightcap!"
"Cheers.."
"Pitch black with minimal head and lacing. aromas of strong, bold coffee, sweet chocolate, ripe plums and dates soaked in alcohol. Coffee hits the palate first, followed by roasted malts and blast of sweet chocolate. Very roasty and smokey aftertaste that lingers around for awhile, accents the strong coffee flavor very well. Fairly light mouthfeel with minimal carbonation. Overall a decent beer from bell's, sorta on the light side, I could knock back a few of these no problem though."
"I love beer and I love coffee, so you would think this beer would be perfect, but not so. This java stout features a combination of a weak ""stout"" beer and a coffee that tastes as though it has been sitting in the pot for weeks, and was very weak when brewed. Everyone else seems to love it on here, so maybe a just got a bad bottle."
"D: I hope you like coffee if you bought this. If you didn't...abort!"
"Overall: This beer from Bell's hides the 7.5% ABV very well. As far as American Double/Imperial Stouts go, this one goes down smooth. Definitely a sipper. It's missing that certain ""wow"" factor that would put this beer into an A range, but a solid, very good beer."
"A little thicker than most on the tounge so definately more of a sipper but a really nice beer."
"Bell's knocks another one out of the park. It may not have gone 500 ft. but definately put a run on the board."
"D - Very easy drinking for the style. Low ABV helps in that respect."
"This one is more like a jacked-up Irish stout than the smooth and mellow Imperial stouts and porters that are more akin to barley wines."
"Poured a nice dark dark brown color with a small head that left a little bit of lacing but not much. It smells really good. You can definitely smell the coffee. There are also notes of chocolate, molasses, and a bit of licorice. It tastes great. You can really taste the coffee and it melds well with the dark malts. Chocolate notes are present near the finish and are very nice. Also, there is a hint of sweetness in there somewhere. There is a nice mouthfeel on this beer. Its nice and creamy with a heavier body on it, but deinitely not the heaviest one of the style by any means. Decent carbonation on this beer as well. This was a really drinkable stout. It went down a lot smoother than a lot of coffee stouts I have had before. I really like this beer. I would definitely recommend this beer to anyone that is a fan of the style. Good job Bells. Cheers."
"Drinkability: Good. You can't drink it all night, but one or two while watching hockey games is a good fit."
"Overall, I'm very happy with this beer. I enjoyed my last bottle more than I had in the past."
"Drinkability -- I'm inclined to say that this is the ultimate coffee stout. The coffee flavor is so rich and deep that no others can really compare in that respect. However, this also makes the beer slightly one-dimensional, so you've got to really like coffee for this one to make your day. Fortunately, I'm in this camp."
"D: I like it, and can easily drink a few tonight."
"Dark brown pour, nearly black. Fairly aggressive pour leaves a mere 1/4 inch of creamy head, decent lacing throughout consumption. Strong nose, lots of coffee, roasted malts, chocolate, even a hint of vanilla. Lots of rich coffee flavor, with a nice coffee bitterness with a smooth, creamy finish. Nice coffee stout from Bell's."
"I was really looking forward to this. I'm a huge coffee lover. That being said...I found this disappointing overall. Glad I only grabbed a single."
"Alcohol is apparent and taste is strong. A real sipper."
"The beer pours black, no highlights shining through at all. A 2-3 finger tan head rises up and lingers for a moment. Lacing and head retention are both decent, but overall I've seen a few more impressive looking stouts. Bell's Java Stout has one of the best/most potent aromas I've found on a beer in a long time. After pouring I could smell the coffee from halfway across the room (and we're talking a pretty good sized room to boot). Further olfactory inspection leads to the discovery of a fair amount of dark chocolate sweetness, though rich coffee is definitely still in the driver's seat. Each sip brings exactly what the nose promised, a healthy dose of coffee with dark chocolate making some noise in the background. I'd like to see a little bit more going on before I give it a better score, a dash of caramel, a hint of fruits, just something beyound the coffee/chocolate. I also am picking up on a little bit of a harsh bitterness, it feels like maybe Bell's extracted some unwanted flavors when adding coffee to Java Stout. Not to the point of being a real nuisance, but definitely noticeable. Carbonation is on the low side, but definitely still present. Perfectly suited for the style. Java Stout is impressively rich for a stout of relatively small size, very creamy. Java Stout is another very good offering from Bell's, up there with Terrapin's Coffee Oatmeal Stout and FBS as one of the best coffee stouts around today."
"Notes: good coffee stout. not my favorite and certainly not as good as it was last year if i remember right and my taste hasnt changed too much. seems like they spared some expense on the ingredients. flavor came up a little short just like some of their recent stuff"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Overall it is quite drinkable and a good represenation of the style. Having this at nearly 1 year old has me wanting to go get a fresh one immediately. Give it a try."
"Sounds like a good opportunity for a side-by-side. Maybe with Expo as a 3rd party."
"This is one of those beers that is so full of coffee, I'm sure has as much caffeine as a cup of coffee , so drink it for breakfast, kids!"
"Notes: Definitely a coffee stout. Coffee dominates with not a lot else coming out too strong as it just gets overwhelmed. Went back and forth about how I feel about the taste, deciding that in small doses, it's nice, but I don't really want too much. The smokey tobacco flavors are probably what really probably brings this down. The mouthfeel is excellent though. Worth a try, especially if you're a coffee lover."
"D: Definitely one of the more impressive imperial stouts out there, Bell's is really impressing me more and more with each offering. Perfect flavor and spot on mouthfeel, this one is worth seeking out and I'm looking forward to revisiting it!"
"Pours a vet dark brown with a tan mocha head and a faint bit of lace. Nose consists mostly of coffee and roasted malt with a bit of chocolate. Coffee takes over the flavor win some dy roast. Between the coffee flavor and bitterness, I really like the feel. Not one of the best coffee beers, but a solid offering."
"a decent tasting beer but definitely not an A beer. maybe because I'm not a huge coffee fan, but something like Founder's Breakfast Stout is much better. This is a little too bitter, like it's straight black coffee. doubt I'd have more than 1 at a time. Would definitely have again though, preferably on tap."
"D - Not bad at all. Very easy to handle for most anyone. I'd drink these all the time if I could afford it."
"The beer is medium in body with plentiful carbonation, but as I swallow, it leaves a nice chocolatey coating around my mouth, feeling very similar to eating a piece of chocolate. Not the most drinkable coffee stout I've ever had, but it does go down pretty easy for a 7.5% beer."
"D - This beer is unique and I like it for that. I don't believe this is something I will have often, but when having a craving for it (probably rarely). All together it's a great beer to try, but I recommend getting a single bottle if at all possible."
"a big rocky brown head. Very evident coffee aroma on the nose. Opaque color. Burnt malts on the nose also. The coffee taste is not subtle in this beer. It meshes so nicely in this brew. I am not a coffee drinker, but absolutely love this beer. There's a bit of carbonation in this one. Besides coffee, I get toffee and roasted undertones. A great bitterness present from coffee and Roasted malts rather than hops"
"Much like other people that have had batch 9462, I can confirm that this must be infected. I just bought this beer in Philly at the Foodery after having had this beer earlier from a trade. The one from the trade tasted the exact same way and though i didn't review that beer or make note of the batch, I have to assume it was this same batch. DRINKER BEWARE that if you want to taste acidic rotten brew...this batch is it. The question is will I ever get a proper java stout frm Bells? I hope."
"Batch 9462. Poured a deep dark black. Nice tan head. Smells good, coffee with hints of chocolate. That's where the good traits end. This tasted awful! I usually love stouts. I drink cold espresso and coffee. I've had other Coffee Stouts. This was bitter and putrid. The only beer I ever poured away because I couldn't choke it down. I would be curious to know if this was a bad batch. I did notice one other review which mentioned this batch number and they had the same experience. If so shame on Bells for letting this out of the brewery. This rated a ""D" because out of fairness it did look and small good but It should be a ""F""
"D: The mouthfeel helps this beer and as it warms it develops a little more complexity and balance, but overall this beer needs more malt profile and balance to make it a truly great example. Too much coffe aroma and flavor for me"
"I bought a bottle of this as part of a mix a 6 from Food & Friends on 20th & Spruce in Philadelphia. I must have purchased a bad bottle, it was from batch #9462. The smell was there, it had an awesome coffee aroma to it that I was very excited for. Until I tasted it. It tasted like a sour. I love sours, but not when I'm expecting a coffee stout."
"Notes: Not overly complex but seems well balanced with hop/coffee/not overly sweet and because the espresso isn't in your face strong it's quite drinkable."
"D: I was afraid this beer was going to be so overdone that it would be nearly undrinkable, gladly I was wrong. Very tasty brew that is pretty easy on the palate."
"D - Well I will have to try a fresh one for sure to see if I can get any hops with all this coffee malt I sampled here but for the price it's a very good smooth beer. Nice."
"D: I sipped this beer and thoroughly enjoyed every last drop, especially since i'm on the west coast and don't normally get to drink this stuff. As i was drinking it, i was feeling a nice warming effect, and a nice little buzz. I don't think this is a good session beer. Tastes great though."
"D - Bells definetely created a ""java"" stout. Great pairing of coffee/espresso and roasted malts. I wish I could have one of these in the morning before work. Although the flavor is not as complex, the flavor works great for what its supposed to be."
"D- if you can get past the smell, its not too bad...total dessert beer in my mind."
"D: Extremely well balanced beer makes this one of my favorite breakfast beers."
"Pours a moderishly thick black with no head, thus no lacing. Scent is of fresh brewed iced coffee, full notes of dark fruit and carmel, hints of dark roasted grains and char. Taste is not as aggressive as the scent, but after a bitter char and roasted coffee begining, it ups the dark fruit and carmel charachters, so much so that they are in balance with the coffee notes, making a somewhat strange, yet halfway decent tasting brew. Medium bodied, not oily or sludgy, little aftertaste."
"MF/D: a sizzle of flavor leaves a lasting tingle, carbonation offers a slight buzz on the tongue, though a little too coffee heavy for my liking."
"d-interesting. a bit heavy on the coffee for me. i like mostly beer with coffee notes, but this was the opposite. either way, glad i tried it and worth looking into."
"Bell's Java Stout poured black, with a tan head, that persisted for awhile. It smelt dark and rich, with a strong coffee flavor. The taste contained a very strong coffee flavor. It had a very strong and heavy flavor. Overall a good beer, the coffee flavors may be a bit strong, one to avoid if you dislike cofee."
"D: This is a easy going beer, not too heavy, but not too weak, a nice balance of complexity between coffee and stout."
"D - It is a good one off, but you likely won't want multiples."
"D Pretty easy to drink for a coffee stout. Pretty good beer overall but nothing extraordinary. Would drink again but wouldn't go nuts trying to seek this one out."
"Medium to almost full body and good coffee flavors on the finish. This is a contemplative beer, one to enjoy, but not necessarily a beer to have 2 or 3 in one sitting."
"D: On the heavier side for a stout, so only somewhat drinkable. Probably wouldn't be able to finish a second in succession."
"D - Not sessionable but a good tasting, single beer treat. You could have this for breakfast with your leftover pizza."
"The beer pours dark brown to black with a tan head. The aroma is a mix of coffee and chocolate. You also get some bitter notes, either from the coffee or the roasted malts. The flavor is heavy on the coffee with some chocolate mixed in. There is some low bitterness in the beer and the coffee lingers in the aftertaste. Medium-thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: The mouthfeel helps this beer and as it warms it develops a little more complexity and balance, but overall this beer needs more malt profile and balance to make it a truly great example."
"Beer poured black as night with a bubbly brown head. Nose is sweet mocha and hints of coffee. Taste is heavy on the roasted malts, coffee, sweet mocha, with a bitter coffee hop finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and fairly smooth. Drinkability is pretty good. This is a pretty good beer in which the abv is pretty well hidden, but it is not for the faint of palate as the finish is very strong on the coffee beans-it reminds me of the expresso beans from Trader Joes."
"D - The acridness makes this one a hard beer to drink. The alcohol is hidden, but that sour acridness makes it tough going down."
"d - Not a bad stout. A very strong coffee smell and taste to it. I would have liked a little more but a pretty good beer and definitely worth a shot if you like coffee tasting stouts. Would try again."
"In a pinch, I could drink it, but for the price there are far better stouts to be had."
"D- easy to drink for a stout. not my top pick but definitely id I'm in the mood for a coffee rich flavor dark beer I would choose this one."
"Looks excellent. Smells like ground coffee. Tastes like ground coffee beans. Not getting much else. An acrid aftertaste. Not very drinkable IMO. Very one dimensional for me. I like my beer to taste a little bit like coffee. This is coffee that tastes a little like beer."
"Overall: Another highly enjoyable offering from Bell's. A bit pricey, but it's worth it. Would be a nice desert or after dinner beer. The taste and drinkability really sold me on this one. If you enjoy coffee and American stouts, I'd recommend it."
"drinkability: I would buy again because there's not alot of coffee brews in my area. But, i could have used more balance between bitter and sweet."
"very hearty stout with a strong coffee nose. dark, smooth, malty, with the coffee opening up even further as the beer warms a bit."
"Drinkability - Although I do not imagine I would want to session this, it is a very enjoyable beer and one that I went through a bit faster than expected."
"M/D - Average body, not much residual sweetness which indicates a full fermentation. Nice drink but not sure how many I'd put down."
"It's called a Java Stout and the dancing coffee cup on the front makes it very clear what they were shooting for so I can't really dock them for not being more complex, but I'd really like to see some of the other more traditional stout flavors join the party (caramel, chocolate, dark fruits)."
"D: I like stouts however I don't believe I could drink more than one of these I bet it would taste better on tap"
"D: Yeah! I'd order another and buy a sixer."
"Drinkability - I would certainly seek these out again in the future if I want an after dinner beer. Now that I've been on BA for over a year, and have tried my fair share of great beers...it takes quite a beer to ""blow me away"" and oddly this one totally did it. I really am enjoying this right now and glad I waited until I was in ""the mood"" to have a good stout (instead of forcing a new beer just to try it). Bells grows ever higher on my favorite brewery list!"
"I wouldnt run out and get this again but it didnt hurt to buy a single bottle of it and I will probably try it again to make sure I didnt get a bad bottle."
"D- I could def drink a few. Will I drink it all night...no."
"Overall, if you're a coffee drinker you will enjoy this stout. However, for the price (16 bucks a sixer), I can't help but still feel I paid too much after having tried it. If you got the dough, sip this joe. If you desire something that pushes the envelope, look elsewhere."
"Overall Impression: I DO like coffee, stouts, and coffee stouts, but this was just a bit over-the-top in the coffee department for me"
"D: I like this for a coffee stout, but don't know how many I could have in a sitting. The sweetness noted in the taste discounts the drinkability."
"D: Bells produces some outstanding products. This one is not one of them. Average at best. Full bodied, which I enjoy, but I can't get past the smell and taste of old, soggy, day old coffee grounds."
"Medium to full bodied with a creamy feel and low carbonation. Almost drinks more like a milkshake than a beer. Not particularly big, bold, or complex but there is a good balance of flavors making this a very drinkable and tasty stout."
"D: Maybe 2 or 3 tops, but the abv and body are very coffee-freak friendly. An excellent coffee stout (one of many)."
"Black pour with two fingers of head. The aroma is an assault of coffee beans of a fruity variety. Some milk and creamer as well. This is blistering. The flavor is coffee forward, and it is a gourmet variety. Some chocolate and creamer seem to be at play in the background. Very clean tasting overall and not very bitter despite the huge coffee flavor. The mouthfeel is slightly fuller than medium and the carbonation is on point. This really is a fantastic coffee beer, and probably the first one to impress me in quite a while."
"D - Relatively low ABV for an imperial stout, and more drinkable than other heavy impy stouts. Very good beer."
"Very tasty both cold and room-temp. It's much silkier at room-temp and not as bitter."
"d: Very good, but there are many better coffee stouts out there."
"Overall, I was really impressed with this beer. Bell's makes some fantastic brews and this is another one of them. Lots of stiff, dark, coffee in a well brewed stout. The beer looks beautiful and has a good coffee aroma. This is an excellent pairing of beer and coffee. I wish I had more of this."
"Overall, this one is not bad. I have had more well-rounded coffee stouts than this, but it'll do in a pinch."
"M/D- Medium bodied, low carbonation. very drinkab;e for 7.5% ABV. if i could getthis in CT, this would be one of my go-to's on a regular basis."
"Bottle pours a dark black with a decent amount of foam using the duvel tulip. Smells of dark roasted coffee. The flavour follows suit as you get hit by waves of coffee goodness. Very smooth drink and incredibly easy to drink. Almost wish there was more booze in this one. A decent offering, and way better then the Cup Of Joe from the same state."
"I got this from Dunt in a BIF. I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours an obsidian black with a thin white head. The aroma if full of freshly brewed coffee. The taste follows the nose. The coffee is the dominant flavor, overtaking any beerish flavors. It is a bit thin for a double stout, but not terrible, very well carbonated. A solid coffee beer, but not outstanding."
"This was an enjoyable stout. It's not my favorite as far as coffee beers go, but I thought it was solid. Good drinkability, but not great. I would pour another if I had it."
"D- easy enough to finish. not the greatest coffee beer ive had, but certainly not the worst."
"Overall - very enjoyable beer. I have stopped drinking coffee for the most part, so this is a nice trip down tastebud memory lane for me. It really would get a higher rating if it weren't for the thinness of the body... but then again, that same thinness makes it so it doesn't fill you up. Hmmm. Interesting dilemma."
"Drinkability? Good drinkability for the 1 bottle. Having another back to back wouldn't work for me but that's not a knock on the beer at all. The 7.5%abv, though not obvious, would sneek up on me and I try not to let beers get the better of me. Hey, I'd be posting jibberish in the forums if I did. ;^) Good solid brew."
"Drinkability was good. Overall this was a semi sessionable beer. Very rich and full of coffee goodness. I guess the only downside to this beer was that there was nothing to balance out the strong coffee flavors. My favorite beers in the world Peche Mortel and Espresso Yeti both have some sweetness to round out the beer and make them more complex. Java stout was just slightly rough around the edges but still extremely good, wish it was available in my state"
"Overall, highly recommended. Much better than I was expecting it to be, and much better than 90% of the coffee stouts I've tried (absolutely destroys breakfast stout in my opinion)."
"I drink black coffee all day long, hot or cold. This tastes like I just polished off the last cup of the day. Not the best beer, but not a bad cup of Joe."
"D - Goes down smooth for sure but wouldn't want more than 1 in a night I would be up for hours and hours."
"This beer accomplishes exactly what it seemingly sets out to do. Medium-bodied stout, dark, smooth, creamy. Very one-dimensional flavor profile, but nails it perfectly. Coffee is well-integrated. Nice touches of bitterness and sweetness. Roasted qualities are very soft. A pleasure to drink. Kind of like a mini-Speedway."
"Another one that I'm going to pay more attention to, this is a no brainer if you like coffee, I forsee myself getting six of these very soon, especially this batch, and I may up that to 24. A lot of beers don't open my eyes much, but this one certainly did, and it was not the coffee doing it. This is a great one to go to if you want some stout qualities in your coffee stout."
"I've had this before but haven't appreciated it as much as now. It pours like it may be thin and is black as night with a deep foamy dark tan head that fades to spotty patterns of Belgian lacing. The smell is aggressive and rich with well roasted coffee beans...like a great cup of coffee, then it pans out some and it leaves you with a bitter nose. The mouth feel is smooth and on the oily side that lends to a fine coating texture that i really appreciate in a good double stout. Adds nicely to the rich coffee taste. A really fine drinker!"
"The mouthfeel is smooth for the level of roastiness but it hampers the drinkability for me."
"D: A very good coffee stout from Bell's. Multi-dimensionally chocolatey, much more so than I was anticipating. I like this a lot, but it doesn't quite jump out at me. Anyone who's a fan of the style should dig this one."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium, but nice and smooth."
"mobile review"
"D- It would be more drinkable if the taste was better. There are just a lot better coffee stouts out there IMO. I'm glad I tried it, it's not horrible whatsoever, just an average coffee beer."
"D - This was a very good ""coffee"" stout from Bell's...the coffee flavors are nice and the chocolate pairs well too...but I was hoping for some stronger and fuller flavors...overall a nice drink"
"-this was a good beer, but nothing i am stoked over. i wish there was some more ""beer"" flavors in there. the burnt coffee taste just really dominated"
"Overall this was another fine offering from Bell's and a quality coffee stout. Thanks again Kevin! Highly Recommended."
"Very good stout that is not to heavy in the coffee department. Would love to try again."
"I think this is a fine coffee stout. This is another good job from Bells. I enjoyed this one and am looking forward to the others I have in my stock."
"M/D: Dryish feeling on the palate. Texture is thick and minimally carbonated, but it isn't silky like other beers of this style. I could definitely drink a couple of these in a sitting. The coffee makes this a great beer to enjoy with breakfast! No, seriously."
"The pour is jet back with a creamy tan head and some sticky lacing. Nose is solely roasted coffee beans. The aroma is not very strong and is not complex in any way. Although it is a coffee stout, I would like some chocolate or malt in the nose as well. Taste has a lot of roasted characteristics in it, as well as coffee, coffee, and coffee. The taste is very good but pretty straight forward. Mouthfeel is oily and drinkability is pretty good. I could definitely sip on a few of these for a session. I was just looking for a little more complexity."
"D=3.0"
"Pours a near black with a light brown head that exhibits pretty good retention; nice patches of lace. Aroma is dominated by roasted malts, with touches of chocolate, coffee and an oatmeal sweetness. Taste is of coffee and chocolate frosting, with a hearty, roasty finish. The sweetness makes for a sticky mouthfeel, although its creamy, too. Quite drinkable -"
"The carbonation is not too high, and is perfect for this beer. Medium to full bodied, smooth, and creamy. Has a ""sticky"" finish to it. Nicely drinkable."
"D - I had 2 imperial pints (20 oz. each), and they were both delicious, and then the beer got warm and it went from beer to pure coffee. I'd say stick to one."
"Drinkability: Not as quite as good as Founders Breakfast Stout but damn close. Java Stout is maybe a little sweeter and not quite as smooth."
"D: If you like coffee and like coffee flavored beers, you'll enjoy this. Coffee is all up in it! Goes down easily, not too filling, certainly one that I would sit with for a while."
"if you love FBS but what more coffee then this is the stout for you"
"Good beer, and I would gladly drink it again, but there is a very good field of coffee beers out there and I'd put this in the middle tier."
"This is a good coffee stout, but nowhere near the great ones."
"Both beers are a wonder to behold. If you can find them both, you are a lucky person indeed. And if you're only given the chance to try this one, then that's more than enough too."
"DRINKABILITY: I love coffee and stouts so it's obvious that i'm a fan of coffee stouts. This is very tasty and definitely i could drink a couple of these. I recommend this if you're into this style of beer."
"D - Ignore the label and any preconceived expectations (especially if you're a coffee connoisseur), and it's actually a pretty unique and pleasing beer experience."
"Time to go french press some ethiopian yirgacheffe, to remind myself what good coffee tastes like."
"Overall, I think it's one of the better coffee stouts I've had."
"Leaves very nice frothy/sticky lacing for a long period of time."
"D - quite yummy, the bold flavors just get to be a bit much towards the end. but an outstanding, affordable, and readily available coffee stout. yum."
"D= This beer did impress. The impressive parts were unexpected however. The idea of coffee beer is here. The real highlights were the look and feel of this beer. A well made coffee beer indeed but the look and feel is well above average. Seek out."
"Drinkability is fairly high. I'm a sucker for coffee beers, and this is a very good one."
"F: Finishes bitter from the stout flavors and scorched malts. It dries off a little from the bittersweet start. A little spicy as well. It leaves a coating on the entire mouth, leaving you the rich coffee and roasted flavors for a while. A nice beer, pretty thick and rich, a little difficult to drink, a big sipper."
"Poured black into a pint glass with a short tan head. Smells of used coffee grounds and burnt malts. I was surprised that the was not a stronger nose of warm coffe flavors (and maybe chocolate?)as you would expect for a coffee stout. The taste of burnt day old coffe overwelmed my tongue. The only other flavor I got was a slight alcohol finish. I am a huge fan of coffee stouts but this one just missed. I expected more from the high price tag."
"poured from a 12 oz bottle into a duvel glass. i find most coffee stouts to have too much or too little coffe flavor.this one is well balanced. the aroma was fantastic, and the taste while good was a bit of a letdown from the smell. starts out a stout and finishes with the taste of strong coffee and hint of unexpected-but welcome-smokiness. would definitely drink/buy again if bell's were a little easier to come by around here."
"Picked up a lousy of this at the beer store and wanted to see what I got. Bells, on a whole, has put out good stuff from what I have had. This is a solid beer, but not one that I would pick up a sixer of. Not bad but there are others that I would go for first. I definately plan on trying other stuff from Bells and expect to get good results."
"D- This is a good beer, but not as full-bodied as I hoped. I like coffee and stouts, so I had hoped I would really like this. For the price I think I probably won't buy this very often."
"Mouthfeel was a bit thin I thought. Drinkability was fine but not awesome. The strength of the coffee character was a bit too much."
"D - While I like the taste, the sweetness may preclude me from drinking more than one. Good beer though."
"D: Definitely, a drinkable beer. Very straightforward and powerful."
"Drinkabilit-: all I have to say here is I wish it didn't taste like burnt starbucks :("
"Not high on my list of coffee stout's. The bitter was too much for me."
"I like coffee stouts a lot and had high hopes for this one, but it isn't as good as others I've had. The coffee is very overpowering which hurts the balance, and doesn't smell or taste like the highest quality coffee either. More like day-old Folgers rather than gourmet beans. Granted my bottles are extremely fresh, so I'm hoping a few months of age may help mellow it out a bit. This review is based on my second bottle, about a week after the first one and it is better than initial impressions. The high price doesn't help either..."
"Next review!"
"This is a pretty good stout. Having sampled it once, however, I feel like I dont need to purchase it again. It was just a little too ""coffee'd out"" to make it an extremely good beer."
"Much better than the Cherry Stout by Bell's. Would definitely like to try this one on tap."
"With no real bitterness but a silky texture due to coffee it seemed this was an OK beer. Seemed flat to me. Only problems too much coffee and no enough sweetness. Not very complex, I wasn't impressed."
"Full-bodied beer here. Slight chewy feel. Moderate amount of carbonation. Flavors of coffee, cocoa, coffee, roasted flavors, and more coffee. This is the most coffee-forward beer I've ever had. If you are into that sorta thing, this is the beer for you. I liked it."
"D - It's a good coffee stout to be certain but it lends itself to the sipping category more than anything. Nicely brewed but I'd back off on how roasted the malts are if it were me. It would let the coffee flavor pull through a little more I think."
"D - It's as close to breakfast as any beer I've had. The coffee is the star, so you better be a big coffee fan to enjoy this. In it's current state, I would say one and done. I am interested to see how it would age, perhaps letting some of the intense coffee flavor meld more into the beer. I would have liked it more if I could have tasted more of the beer."
"Nose and taste are both loaded with coffee. Slight hints of cocoa and smokiness. But this brew features first and foremost one thing - coffee. Slightly bitter aftertaste, which is to be expected. Mouthfeel is thick and full and fairly creamy. Carbonation is appropriate. Enjoyable to drink, but quite heavy - you're not chugging this thing."
"Aroma is just like fine coffee with a smoky overtone - hardly like beer at all, but most inviting! It pours a deep opaque sable, nearly black, with a very thick, fine-bubbled tan head. Flavor is rich and very smoky, maybe a wee bit too smoky. It has a tasty chocolate undertone and hints of toffee and molasses. Texture is thick, smooth, fairly tingly, and quite satisfying. Overall, an immensely pleasing stout."
"This is a super-solid coffee stout. I must take umbrage with two things: 1.) this isn't a double/imperial stout, imo and 2.) at $14-$15 a sixpack, this is incredibly, incredibly overpriced. I was tempted to knock the drinkability down because of the outrageous price but then I realized that I never do that with any beer. Those two things said, this is yummy. That's the most important thing. Seek it out if you're a coffee stout fanatic."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good if you like coffee."
"finish: is smooth and leaves a pleasant coffee flavor on the pallet, the bitterness form the coffee and hops blend well together and there is a very pleasant after taste the makes the desire for another sip."
"D: Very drinkable, this would definitely be one that I could drink several of in a sitting if it was distributed to CA."
"Notes: Great beer, but I think that I enjoyed the taste a little more on tap. Unfortunately I wasn't able to write my review down so the bottle will have to do for now."
"D - The drinkability is very high, this is a fantastic stout and has plenty of coffee flavor, definitely recommended for those who like coffee augmented beer"
"A deep, dark brown with a sandy colored head. Could have used a bit more head retention and/or lacing but it was good enough in my estimation. Smells of bitter coffee and dark chocolate. These aromas are present in the flavor profile as well and give the overall impression of chocolate covered espresso beans. The roasted bitterness is present but restrained and balanced to perfection with the hop bitterness. Light-bodied with a good carbonation and a nice mouth-coating malt presence. Definitely one of the best coffee stouts I've had. I'm not usually a huge fan of the style but I could definitely see myself having this one again. Once again, Bell's has lived up to their reputation. This is a definite must-try coffee stout."
"D: I'm not sure what was up with the cigarette thing, but I think it ruins what is otherwise a pretty solid coffee stout. Maybe I'll try it again in the future."
"D - Very good example of style, pretty complex nose and taste. Spot on coffee stout."
"Drinkability: Nice flavors, near perfect for a cool night; rather filling and the ABV is a tad high for more than one though."
"D - If you don't enjoy coffee, look elsewhere. For those of us who do, Java Stout is a must. This is definitely a coffee beer, not just a beer with coffee. Delicious."
"Looked like I poured a cup of coffee into my pint glass other than the noticeably thicker viscosity and the half finger of dark tan head. Really has a coffee aroma along with some bitter chocolate. The taste is much of the same, although I felt there was a hint of chocolate brownies in there as well. Velvety smooth going down. I like strong black coffee (hot and iced) so this was right up my alley. I did notice some alcohol on the back-end, but nothing overt."
"D: This was the first coffee beer I ever had. And it's still one of the best."
"D: True to its name, Java Stout brings together the best of coffee and beer in a classic way. I found this one to be a great example of the style and wish it was readily available. Another good beer from Bell's."
"D: A pretty sessionable coffee stout"
"Drinkability: this coffee stout is a good blend of coffee and beer. the coffee is not too strong that it dominates the rest of the flavors, but compliments them well."
"Drinkability: Terrible - I could barely finish this. I'm so sad I have another one of these in my fridge. I can't stand to pour things down the drain, so I'm already annoyed that I'm going to eventually force myself to drink the second bottle some night."
"For any kind of coffee stout, it's relatively drinkable. Like real coffee, you don't want to guzzle it--and I realize that's not necessarily what drinkability means. Still, this beverage is probably better sampled with friends than poured as a single serving."
"this is hands down one of the best coffee stouts i have ever had. i love every bit of this and then some. this is a coffee stout!"
"J"
"Cheers!"
"D: An easy sipper that I actually enjoy a bit more on the cold side. even though it was a small bottle I would have prefered to share it because the sweetness was a bit more than I usually like"
"D: This beer is great in the first half and a bit of a let down in the second. That is, each sip starts thick, full flavored and complex but finishes a bit dusty, dry and one dimensional. If it were not for the Jeykl and Hyde aspects of this beer it would rank up there with some of the better coffee beers out there."
"Easy enough to drink one of but honestly they priced me right out of ever really going after this one again a solid beer but I have had far better within the style."
"D: A decent coffee stout, but there are better ones out there. This one is a bit one-dimensional and even that dimension isn't all that wonderful. Don't get me wrong, though this is still a pretty good beer, its just not as good as it could be."
"Drinkability: I could have three not six. This has got a near perfect coffee taste and what I envision when I think coffee___stout. Bells knows how to make pleasing stouts."
"D: This beer is pretty drinkable for the abv. The alcohol is not noticeable at all."
"Dry on the palate, which turns slightly chalky, which more or less works with the flavor profile but which I don't care much for. Medium to full in body, but light enough to make it quite drinkable. Very enjoyable."
"Mouth is heavily bodied and viscous. I would say its undercarbonated but the bitterness doesn't allow much more. drinks slowly but it's a damn fine beer."
"The only downfall is the drinkability. It's delicious but the overwhelming coffee taste makes this one to take slow and savor it."
"Dark brown/black poured into a Chimay chalice. Thick with an inch or so of head. Smell is ""musty", and combines bittersweet dark chocolate/cocoa and espresso. A load of coffee in the flavor, very sweet with a bunch of chocolate syrup at the beginning and biting at the finish. This tastes like something you would get from Starbucks if they ever got into the carbonated alcoholic beverage business. Not as strong as you'd probably expect for the style, this is exceptionally drinkable. This is a pleasant surprise."
"One of the better coffee beers out there even though it's not as complex as some others. I could drink a couple of these in a sitting."
"I've taken to using FBS as the standard in my reviews of this style and this one is pale in comparison. Bell's Java Stout is tasty and enjoyable, but too thin and crisp."
"Very drinkable, if you love coffee. If you do not love coffee, chances are you will not like this beer. I for one love coffee, therefore I love this beer."
"overall a very good coffee stout not the best...valdez really heads this category imo..but rated to style a solid contender if it were cleaned up a bit.."
"The pour yielded very little head, even though I poured for maximum head. There was maybe a fingers worth of head that was a dark caramel color, that resided quickly. No lacing on the glass with this beer, sad face. The smell is of strong coffee notes, a bit of caramel and some chocolate - all in all a very nice smelling beer. Just for the smell alone I'm curious in letting this warm-up before I post the review, but I may just go back and update if it makes a noteworthy difference. This tastes so much like the Breakfast Stout, just lacking some of the punch and other ingredients. The coffee flavors are overtly noticeable, balanced well with a hint of caramel and chocolate and roasted malts round out the experience. It's such a balanced and great flavor that - like Founder's Breakfast Stout - I find hard to put down, I just enjoy constantly sipping this. I could very easily see myself buying more of this in the future."
"bought a single of this one and i wish i brought more it pours very dark with a tan head and sticky lacing ..the smell is roasted coffee and toffee and semi sweet chocolate the taste was roasted coffee first then some some roasted malts some sweet caramel and hops this was a great coffee stout nicely carbonated and crisp a pleasure to drink"
"Overall, A great beer and I will definitely be buying some bottles of this one if I have a chance. Very drinkable with an awesome coffee flavor."
"D= I loved this beer and will be grabbing another six pack soon. Very flavorful and easy to drink, with the ABV staying well hidden. Highly recommended."
"(D)- This is for serious coffee drinkers, if you dont like your coffee strong or black then you might not like this as much as I do. Nonetheless, this is fantastic. Well balanced with no fancy frills or a ridiculously high abv, just a well-made beer that I would gladly drink any saturday morning; especially in the dead of winter. Will definitely be picking up more of this."
"D- Full and rewarding. Holds up against some of the better coffee stouts."
"Overall, tastes like a slightly toned down version of Founders Breakfast Stout."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fairly strong bite of carbonation."
"D: Be careful, if you drink more than a few in an evening, you may never get to sleep. This one certainly delivers a caffeine jolt! This is rich, sweet, and awfully tasty...but not suited for a session. A little pricey too."
"I've had this one a bunch of times over the years and always thought the roasty char was too much combined with the acidity of the coffee.. well... I like this and maybe it just needs a bit of time to round out... Had I known it was gonna be this good, I probably would have waited and shared it with the Boise crew... Thanks again David!!"
"Future outlook: If you don't like bold coffee flavor, you won't like this coffee stout. I happen to be a coffee fiend...so I like this stout, and am happy to have nabbed a sixer."
"Great beer one of my new favorites."
"D: Another solid brew from Stouts but not quite up to their high standards. This beer was pretty much just really dark roasted (charred) coffee with a pretty eh aftertaste, no depth or complexity here. I've also enjoyed other Coffee Stouts a lot more (Jahva, Depth Charge) as this just didn't wow me. If you love dark roasted coffee, you'll probably enjoy this brew like me, but don't expect to get your socks knocked off. Still excited for Expedition Stout in a few weeks!"
"Nice to see Bell's bring back this seasonal offering. A very solid coffee stout, even if it is pretty straight forward. Not my favorite, but far from the worst I've had."
"Drinkability is off the charts. Fantastic brew. I am glad to see this back as a rotating seasonal. Mighty tasty and easy to drink."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: Its a stout, so its going to be harder to drink a lot of these. It was very thick but had a good subtle carbonation that I didn't notice at first. Overall, I thought this was the consummate coffee drinkers beer."
"D: Man this is a great beer all around. I am very impressed. I saw this in the store and thought I would try it on a whim, thinking it would be about average, but man it is way better than that!"
"A must for coffee-stout lovers"
"medium body, smooth, w acidity and astringency in the finish. mild to moderate carbonation is tingly upfront, and helps with creaminess."
"Poured a thick, dark brown with a generous head that quickly dissipated to a collar The aroma was coffee with chocolate in the back. The taste was true to the aroma with coffee and chocolate, both bitter and sweet made their presence known. The feed was full bodied and oily, with very little carbonation. Drinkability was good for a big, fat, imperial stout. An excellent stout, more than holding it's own in a very competitive category."
"Overall impression: Too much old coffee flavor, not a beer I'd seek out."
"D: Really liking this beer. It's not a BIG imperial stout, but if you were looking for more of a session imperial stout, I think this would be pretty darn spot on. The flavor is really tasty, there's no alcohol picked up, it's thin enough to drink a lot of, but thick enough to coat your mouth. I will definitely pick some more of this up just to have around if I see it in the future."
"D: This beer pairs wonderfully with breakfast foods...I recommend eggs, potatoes and some toast!"
"This is an stellar stout that sits somewhere just short of an imperial stout, but is extremely tasty and a must-try for the coffee lovers out there...like me. Another great beer from Bell's."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is through the roof! At 7.5% and a coffee stout nonetheless, I could drink a ton of these. I think this is a very good beer. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but all in all quite nice. I wish I had a fresh bottle to compare this to, I think the age has done this a ton of good, after all it is 16 months old. Too bad Bell's has stopped brewing Java Stout, coffee lovers will be depressed. Skal."
"A 12 ounce bottle - batch 8158. Poured into my Imperial pint glass, this stout appears a nearly opaque deep brown color with about two fingers of creamy, dense, lingering ecru foam. The head leaves a thin lace on my glass in it's wake. Nose consists of dark roasted coffee beans, milk chocolate, raisins, and molasses. Flavor is dominated by espresso, dark roasted coffee beans, bitter cocoa, bakers chocolate, a bit smokey, milk/cream, and bitter grassy hops. Medium to full bodied and a tad bit oily in the mouth with ample carbonation. Certainly worth a try if you can still find some."
"Update: In late 2009, Bell's finally released this brew again. The batch I currently have was bottled in mid-November of 2009. I don't think it's as good when fresh, though. The coffee flavor is still strong with a highly roasted/almost burnt taste. There's a bit of chocolate, but there's an even stronger stogie character. In fact, after drinking more than one bottle on a recent evening, I woke up the next morning with an uncanny ""tastes just like I smoked a cigar last night flavor"" burned into my tongue from this new batch. Weird...I wasn't expecting that! I like this fresh version, but I miss the previous ""aged"" and more mellow version. If the new version is anything like the last one, it will improve over the next year and develop a tasty cocoa flavor. The last version was quite good at around a year or so, but then went south in a hurry. Overall, I'm just not as excited about the new version, but hopefully it'll improve with a little age."
" Thank you Bells"
"There's such a glut of coffee beers out there that I see why Bell's stopped bothering with this one. It doesn't really distinguish itself - especially against other Michigan locals (Founders Breakfast, Short's Cup a Joe). It was nice to try it, though."
"Drinkability- Personally, high."
"This is a very nice coffee stout by the folks at Bell's. A must try imperial stout. I feel bad that it had to follow a Peche Mortel."
"Very drinkable and tasty cross between a milk stout and a coffee stout."
"(D) A delicious stout with a great blend of coffee with the brew."
"D: Tasty stout with a nice dry, bitter coffee kick. Could have a few of these."
"D: Maybe not as drinkable as some other stouts, but still a very tasty beer. Hopefully some day Bell's brings this one back."
"Pours jet black with a light head. Nose is molasses, dates, raisins, and vanilla. Body is cranberries, molasses, brown sugar. Coffee doesn't finally appear until the finish of the third sip. A bit weaker than i'd like at 7.5%. Mouthfeel is thin, with a tart aftertaste."
"The color of this one is a very, very dark brown that is nearly black. The head is a creamy brown foam with decent retention, and while the lacing is thin is does remain. The smell is coffee and dark chocolate, complex and simple at the same time. The taste is surprisingly what you would expect. Carbonation is low. It is incredibly accurate in strong coffee taste. There is a slight acidity to it and a flavor that is smoky but not burnt. Dark chocolate flavors linger as well. Not only that, but you get the roasted malts too. My wife thought it was too strong, but I liked it very much. The body is thick and full. It is smooth, though it snaps just a little. This one also has good texture and a nice balance of flavors. If you're looking for a good coffee stout, this is one to try."
"D: I liked this! Very drinkable coffee stout. I'd like to find some more to keep around for a while."
"Bell's needs to expand their distribution, and to please make Oklahoma one of their stops."
"D- Not so much. Only average at best. The coffee just seems to be to overwhelming and after the first one, I had had enough."
"Overall probably my favorite stout from Bell's."
"Taste: More coffee of course. Also has a pleasant smokeyness. The coffee certainly didn't fade at all during the year it spent on store shelves."
"D: It is not a bad beer, but not nearly as good as some of the finer coffee stouts on the market. The coffee is there and not cloying but I was happy to get a chance at one but happy it ended there."
"Big & filling flavors make it a 2 bottle max for me. Although that is no problem. A big flavorful stout I'd buy reguarly if available in California."
"Pours a jet black, but looks a little less dense than I' expected. Aggressive pours yields a little, thin head. Funny, it almost looks like coffee when I pour it in a pint to make ice coffee, so that bodes well for the title. The smell most definitely reinforces that look. It reeks of dark roasted coffee and a strong malt backbone. All of these senses dictate the taste, dark roasted coffee, hints of chocolate, and strong malt character. It is a tasty stout, indeed. The taste is incredible, although, its little light in consistency, I could have another, but this one stands well on its own. Its so strong in character, and that is good for a stout."
"This beer drinks pretty thick & heavy. It's good. This is a high quality beer."
"8/5/8/4/16 (4.1/5)"
"This beer is so thick, you could almost chew it down. That's what I like in an Imperial. It's a bit chilly out here, but it's great a keeping me warm by my fire outside. Had a beautiful thick head on it that thinned out, but still was solid all the way across. The smell had elements of dark chocolate, coffee, and maple syrup. The taste was similar to the smell, but more in the coffee and chocolate area, not too much maple taste. Also had a nice thick coating as it went down the throat, but wasn't something that would make you overly full."
"Great representation of the style, reminds me of an RIS almost, but this is a fantastic beer."
"Wow! There is no mistaking the fact that this is a coffee stout. The nose is absolutely full of it! It smells like dark chocolate covered coffee beans - literally! This stout is packed full of java! I also get some bitter chocolate, some raisinets, and maybe a hint of toffee, but mainly just good, strong coffee. This beer pours a very dark brown, with some nice tan head at the start, but unfortunately the head seems to dissipate a little early. The taste is (as you would guess) very dominated by coffee. I wouldn't say this is the most well balanced beer I've had, but if you're really in the mood for a strong coffee stout, you won't mind that fact. There is a bit of astringency in this one, probably due to the fact that it is so loaded with coffee. I don't know if I could drink a lot of these, but I would definitely enjoy 1 or 2. I think that if you are big on coffee stouts, then this is one to try. It is certainly rich and full of the bean! An interesting specialty brew for sure!"
"M/D - This is like drinking a coffee mixed with soda. Nice flavors throughout, the carbonation was a little more than I expected. I will stick to just one, but will definitely have again."
"A black pour with a solid brown head. Smells like a cup of espresso. Tasted very roasty, malts and coffee with some mocha or bakers chocolate. Coffee bitters linger at the finish, but not too bitter. Alcohol is well hidden, a little warming effect after you get into the beer a bit. Very pleasant, maybe even better than the Beer Geek in my opinion."
"Pours a very dark brown almost black color with mahogany edges and a huge frothy tan head. Roasted malty aroma with lots of coffee as well as some oatmeal, toffee, caramel and hazelnut. Very smooth and quaffable with lots of roasted coffee maltiness, creamy sweet dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, oattmeal and a bitter, hoppy dry finish."
"Full bodied. Quite a tasty beer to be sure, and drinkability is decent. However, the amount of coffee bitterness is a bit too strong in my opinion. It makes it hard to have more than just the one. If you're a coffee nut, this one's right up your alley."
"A rich, robust very coffee-ish stout (almost too coffee-ish). I like coffee and stouts, so expected to like it a bit more, but it's still a nice one. If you like coffee, this one is certainly worth looking out for!"
"HV"
"Notes from 12/22/05"
"D - after spending the last couple of hours working on a paper, this was a welcomed break. If drinking these in succession I am sure they will catch up rather quickly with a 7.5% alcohol; plus the richness of the flavors might tire you out after a while. If you are a coffee drinker then I know that you will enjoy this Bell's offering without a doubt."
"Talk about deja-vu, I tweaked an oatmeal stout recipe last year and brewed up a coffe stout that was extremely similar to this one. Choked down about half the batch and ended up dumping the rest, just too many coffee beans used. This one is much smoother and tastier, but still not to my expected liking. Aroma is intriguing, lots of ground coffee bean to the nose but with a decent amount of dark malt to make it enjoyable. Dark pour, head soon diminishes, and no lacing very sub-par for a stout. Thin mouthfeel even a touch watery, happens more often than I allow myself to admit w/ Bell's beers. Flavor is a solid blend of dark and roated malt with a ton of coffee, again just too much focus on the bean it really detracts from the decency of a good stout. I applaud the effort but not something I'd spend my cash on again."
"Thanks Karl for indroducing me to them over 15 years ago while in Michigan. Went to the original brewery and had sandwiches and a few beers. Still a hole in the wall back then. Now look at them."
"D - drinking one of these is a delicious experience, savour the incredible flavors slowly."
"This one blows away the re-issue of Doubleblack Stout. I'd love to try the Bourbon barrel aged version."
"D - Pretty good for a coffee stout but not something I would always want to drink"
"A very tasty and easy drinking brew. Probably one of the better sessionable stouts I have had. Surprised by the light coffee flavor but overall quality makes up for it in aces. Now I look forward to trying the Expedition stout."
"Flavor is much better than the look and aroma. Very dark, roasted, and properly bitter. I say ""properly"" as it is not overly bitter for it's own sake, yet it has the firm substantial bitterness necessary in a beer of this style. A fresh coffee flavor shines through, and blends with a creamy ghost of sweetness as well as more bitter dark chocolates."
"this one pours black with one finger of dark head. it smells sweet, creamy and coffee like. it has a creamy medium body. the coffee taste is not very strong, although the flavor is more sharp, like black coffee. there is a nice roastiness as it warms and opens up. the aftertaste is like fresh raw coffee beans. well balanced and drinkable."
"Ok on drinkability, and my suggestion to Bell's is to either tone down the beans, or somehow improve the overall smoothness. p.s. I'm a big coffee fan, drinking ""Starbucks-style"" dark coffee every day, so it's not that I'm not used to the acidity."
"Wish I would have picked up a sixer to let sit in the cellar for a couple of years - after 2-3 years these are golden."
"D - Very high, what a smooth brew here."
"Not sure if I ought to have had this sooner, and that is why the taste was funky. Haven't had any other American double stouts although have had a fair share of RIS. Oddly, I am also not a huge fan of Bell's RIS--the Expedition Stout, while I really enjoy most of their other beers."
"Overall I'm glad that I had the opportunity to try this. I would have no problem drinking a few more of these. Definitely worth a shot."
"If you're looking to sample a coffee flavored stout I would say this would be one of the best to try."
"Drinkablity: An interesting brew with strong character. Very enjoyable with a brunch."
"D: I could see myself sneaking this into my coffee mug at my office. No one would ever know! This was great. It was very diverse from what I expected to get from a java stout. It's a shame I heard that they aren't brewing this anymore, or at least for a while. Bell's wins again with this one. I recommend you have some while you still can."
"Drinkability - The Peche Mortel gets all the pub, and while it's good it's a little to harsh for my tastes. This is another triumph for bells. Do they do anything wrong? I'm sad that this beer is no longer brewed as it is my first and maybe last time i'll ever have it."
"D: More please. I'm not a huge fan of coffee this or java that in my beer but this I can do plenty of."
"Drinkability is good. The only other beer in this style that I've liked has been Valdez, and this is kinda a less complex version of that. If its really 7.5% I'd be shocked."
"Couldn't help myself. Made a beer float with the Java Stout and vanilla bean icecream. This is what happy tastes like."
"D: Splitting a 12oz bottle is nice. The bitterness and massive coffee taste cuts down in drinkability. Really nice beer. I will probably be awake for 3 days now."
"Drinkability: Not the most natural or the best coffee stout I've ever had (that honor probably goes to the Peche Mortel, if we're talking purely about pure coffee stouts), but not a bad one."
"D- this is a great beer, but it does taste a little like a cheap coffee bean. Anyway, this is an outstanding breakfast beer. Can you say college football tailgate? I CAN!"
"This beer poured a deep used motor-oil color with a brown head which quickly receded. The aroma is bold with coffee. There are malt and spice notes. I smell what I think is an undertone of cinnamon. The taste is definitely coffee - unmistakable. There are also big malty flavors that balance the coffee bitterness. The mouthfeel is full and lush, which is excellent for this brew. Bell's brews are always a pleasure and I think this ranks up there with their best."
"I enjoyed this stout from Bell's more so than their other stouts."
"I guess the trick is NOT comparing it to Bell's best stout (Expedition), Southern Tier's Jah-va, Peche Mortel, or whatever else this could remind you of. Taken for what it is, it's a total pleasure, and would be one of those rare beers that's drinkable for breakfast. It's 6:40 PM...should I be worried about a caffeine buzz as I hit the hay a few hours from now...???"
"Pours deep dark brown/black, nice tight tan head rises and fades to a thin ring around the beer, not much lacing at all. Absolutely massive coffee aroma on this, like sticking your nose into a sack of freshly roasted coffee beans. Taste delivers with the coffee! Big, bold, and burnt coffee taste, a touch of cocoa in the mix too. Love the mouthfeel on this, creamy, and a quick swish turns this into a frothy coffee milkshake. This is one kick-ass coffee stout! Love this..."
"This was quite impressive. Bell's stouts rock."
"This beers flavors and mouth feel are great, but the aroma leaves a lot to be desired. The aroma is an overwhelming acrid coffee smell that brings the aroma out of balance. The flavor was much better, offering a good malt body to back up the coffee flavors."
"I would not drink this again. I tried hard to like this beer after all the reviews I read I guess I expected a little bit more, but in the end you gotta go with what you like."
" how could you not love this stuff??"
"At almost 8 percent this beer does well to hide the alcohol, however the overwhelming coffee flavor can get old soon. So I would opt for just one of these at a time."
"Darn good."
"I haven't had any coffee stouts before this one, but I definitely enjoyed it. A bit much of a burnt taste, however. I was expecting the coffee to shine a bit more."
"Too light, refreshing, and drinkable to be an 'Imperial Stout', but it tastes and feels great, so... so what?!"
"A nice, relaxing beer to drink on."
"I dont think I'll do this one again, but if I was on a desert island and this was all I had, I'd drink it."
"A little too much coffee for my taste but I'd drink it again."
"Great drinking coffee stout it be a great brunch brew"
"D - Not bad. Some coffee stouts are subtle with their coffee, but this one is in your face. Several coffee flavors are present which makes for a pleasant experience."
"D- since i love this type of beer i could do a sixer of this in a day but not in a couple hours. A lil tough toput down quick but nice to have 2 or 3 during a Pens game!"
"Not a good-drinking beer. I've long been a fan of Bell's & their Expedition Stout is one of my favorites. This was a serious let-down & I won't be trying another one; only the second drain-pour I've every had."
"Poured a thick, viscous black cola-esque body with a solid index-finger, tan, rocky head that lasted a long time and left a lace ring around the head. Mainly picked up coffee in the smell, although there may be some toasted malts as well (and maybe hints of fruit, but I may be imagining things). An intense coffee taste first hit me, almost like drinking coffee w/ alcohol. But there was also some fruit, caramel and hops mixed in to provide a fullish body that went down sweet and smooth, not slimey, with a drying yet tasty backbite. Not the most complex beer, but a nice beer I could session (I did not realize that the ABV was 7% - hidden well)."
"Drinkability is pretty easy, a great brunch beer it washed down my Chicago dog and chili fries quite nicely. Last few sips though made be realize 1 at a time was plenty."
"drinkability - Very tastey, don't taste it cold though, let it warm up a little bit. Taste better."
"Highly drinkable. Java's a full-flavored Stout with enough coffee flavor without being overwhelming. Might be a nice breakfast beer!"
"A very good beer, just not tastes I am a huge fan of. If you like stouts and coffee, this is probably the only beer you will ever need again."
"drinkability is good. this is a very thick and rich brew, but the flavors and aromas provide a pleasant composition. well proportioned and quite smooth, this one is a solid stout. cheers!"
"I enjoyed this. Coffee is hard to work with and this does pull it off rather well. Enjoy on a Sunday morning with some good bakery."
"Pours a thick black color with a decent quarter inch head. Smell is sweet with coffee and chocolates maltiness. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and bitter. The taste has a weird chili oil taste to it, but the roasted coffee and chocolate malts are still in there. I wish the coffee was more pronounced though. I expected a lot more from this stout and especially from Bell's, but I guess I can't like 'em all."
"Pours a nice clean dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, nice sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet roasted malts, slight hops, nice coffee/caramel. The taste is delicious of sweet roasted malts and coffe/caramel, the finish is slightly dry. Medium body."
"D) One of these was enough for me, but I could have had another. It was very good on a chilly evening after a long day, good to lend some fortitude in the winter months but I don't think I'll purchase much of it during the summer."
"D: This is a fantastic brew and it was highly enjoyable. The only reason I dinged it with a '4' is because one of these in a sitting is really plenty. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in an impy stout or a Russian impy."
"Drinkability is moderate, I'd definitely have another but probably wouldn't drink an entire 6-pack in one sitting. I do like that this comes in 12oz bottle instead of a bomber form as I would expect from most beers in this style."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty good brew. It doesn't compare to coffee stouts like Speedway or Peche Mortel, but it is more widely available. It is very easy drinking. I would have it again if I ever come across it, but I won't be actively searching it out. Very solid and tasty brew."
"D: Amazingly drinkable for stout with coffee mixed in. I had almost given up on this style with my dislike for the black coffee flavor that most of this type have. Based on its style I'm giving it high marks in this area."
"D: Limited sessionability, but a very nice one to take the time to enjoy. One of the better (if not best) coffee stouts I've come across. This is truly the beer equivalent to a nice dark roast cup of coffee served with cream...I'm impressed with what they've been able to do with this brew. Coffee lovers seek this one out!"
"D - Easily drinkable. This has an excellent coffee essence without becoming overwhelming in the way that many other coffee stouts tend to be. The roasted character is complex and it exhibits all of the best attributes of good coffee."
"wow. da bomb. extreme coffee stout. sitting at the bar sampling it and talking with another patron and we agree that while it's such a bold coffee stout there are no bad parts; indeed only good. The finish is like espresso. They have acheived a perfect balance for such a beer. Poured opaque black with tan head and good lace. Huge volatile nose of malt and dark roast coffee. Looong finish. Would go great with chocolate."
"D- Dangerous @ 7.5% what a great java stout."
"At best, this is a great coffee beer. Unfortunately, the finish took away from the delicious sweet/bitter combination of the coffee/stout."
"D: Sipper. Something this intense on the coffee requires a caffeine content label somewhere"
"D: It's a bit hefty, so I wouldn't be doing many at a time. I can only go with the coffee taste for so long, too. Decent, but with that ABV, I won't be replacing a Starbucks Frappucino or the like."
"Simply amazing. If you like stouts, try it. If you like coffee, try it. I'll definitely be buying more if I can find it."
"One dimensional and unsessionable, but a decent beer nonetheless. Fails to unseat Alesmith Speedway Stout as the best beer brewed with coffee I've had."
"Bottle code of 7768 indicating a bottling date of Dec 21, 2006. It seems to have held up fairly well. Pours with a milk-chocolate colored head. There didn't seem to be much coffee in the aroma. Just had that kinda standard dark malt smell. THe taste felt roasty, a tad sour, with only the slightest bit of coffee to me, although others in the group described it as being very heavy on coffee. Although I don't think they've had many, if any, beers brewed with coffee before. Not bad and probably even better when it's super fresh."
"The body has a mid carbonation feel to it. Some oily burnt textures. Also some solvent alcohol remnants remain through the finish. Overall I could use more of a coffee presence and less of roasted quality. Some strong alcohol notes that are off setting as well, but ok."
"Aroma is nice roasted coffee malt with notes of licorice, dark fruit essence, and chocolate. Dark ruby/black hue with a nice tan head that left good lace. Flavor is roasted coffee, licorice, chocolate. Nice finish with a good coffee linger. Palate is smooth and medium bodied. Fantastic brew."
"This poured an opaque brown with very little tan head. It smelled strongly of raw coffee beans decently balanced with malt and a bit of hops. It had a dominant taste of black coffee no sugar no cream with some malt flavoring. It was pretty watery, much thinner than I would expect for a stout, with a little bit of carbonation. As expected, it had a bitter coffee aftertaste but it wasn't too strong. Overall this had a fairly unique flavor and was pretty good, but seemed more like a porter than a stout."
"Poured into a snifter, Java Stout gives a rich dark black color with some ruby hints towards the top. Nice rich tan head with a good retention rate. Great lacing. Sweet malty aroma, from which I get cherries. Some slight coffee hints but not overpowering, with a dash of licorice in here as well. Wow! This could be perhaps the best coffee beer I have had yet. The coffee flavors are subtle at first, and then all of a sudden they just take control of the palate. Mouthfeel is very smooth and flavorful. The palate is very complex, yet subtle. The carbonation level is dead on for what this beer needs. Would I drink it again? I just bought a case."
"Nicely drinkable"
"Smelled like dark chocolate, coffee, and burnt malts... like it's roasted. Thin but good medium body for the mouthfeel. Prevalent coffee flavor without being too overpowering. It's a good drinkable coffee beer."
"Dark chocolate color with thick creamy head with a brown tint. Head lasted until my last sip from the quite empty glass. Similiar smells other than the coffee to Kalamazoo, dried fruit, dark chocolate smell at first. First taste was coffee then malted chocolate flavor and then a quick hop flavor. After about 10 minutes out of the cooler this beer was perfect. The alcohol forward threw me for a loop."
"D- I like this beer a lot. I could certainly drink a few of these. Too bad Bell's is so hard to get around here."
"D, notes: Good drinkable/sessionable stout. The coffee flavors are intense but that's what this beer is all about - There's a friggin dancing coffee cup on the label. You should have a good idea what you're getting into."
"Good morning Bell's !!!"
"D- pretty sweet for a imperial stout. never a session style but you like every sip"
"A nice two fingers of rocky, khaki head, with solid lace. Beer is a very, very dark ruby. Of course, coffee is prominent in the nose. Medium carbonation. Coffee (almost burnt) and chocolate slather my buds, the alcohol slightly warming. Goes down easy. I'll have another."
"Taste is big, bold, and backed up by very strong coffee. Huge mouthfeel and finishes dry. There is a residual sweetness that soothes the taste buds. Leaves my mouth with a big malty and burnt taste. Very little hop presence. Coffee is noticable throughout the beer. Very nice stout and it's almost chewy. Really one for those coffee drinkers."
"Mouthfeel, was good, creamy and smooth, and a touch of chewy. This is a great beer, and a nice change for an imperial (this one is hardly an imperiel), not too sweet, and just a damn good beer."
"D: Extremely drinkable for an imperial stout, owing to its nice blend of sweetness and smoothness with distinctive coffee flavors to set it apart. Great job, Bell's (again)."
"It looked very good pouring. It was a dark almost black color with little head. I was very eager to try this one. The aroma did not disappoint. The smell of coffee and a hint of chocolate is present. The coffee and chocolate taste is present but not as plentiful as I imagined after the smell. The taste was disappointing. I have tasted much better coffee stouts. The mouthfeel was decent but seemed to lose the flavor and did not go down as smooth as I thought. It is easy to drink but would rather have others."
"426 reviews as of this writing. I'll forego the usual review and chime in and say this was quite a tasty brew. No question this stout is done wiht coffee. Nice balance of rich malt and coffee flavors with no hint it's 7.5% ABV. Definitely one worth a try!"
"I'm a sucker for coffee beers. This one is a winner in my book."
"D - Surprisingly smooth given the strong flavors present... A very enjoyable session beer..."
"Black pour with a tan head. Smell was of strong roast coffee, wet burnt gritty coffee grounds, and a twinge of metal. Taste was strongly of coffee, but smooth, and very creamy. Again maybe a hint of metal, but not enough to really detract much. Wet charred coffee bean flavor in a good way. Very drinkable, perfectly bitter, and spot on body and carbonation. I loved this beer!"
"Eric"
"Overall a beer I would buy again. I agree with everyone this is definitely one a coffee lover would favor. Bell's is always a good bet."
"D: I find this to be very easy drinking and going down wonderfully. I am a coffee lover so that could explain it. I could easily drink 3-4 four of these but I could see how non coffee drinkers could suffer through one."
"Overall- It's very much a coffee lover's beer. I remember going to the coffee pot at work the next morning and thinking of the beer I had the night before. It's an interesting way to start the morning."
"Overall- An excellent stout to enjoy for dessert or later in the evening."
"This beer pours jet black with a thick tan head. The aroma is moderately roasty, slight chocolate and some burnt coffee. The flavor is initially like a typical roasty stout but is quickly followed by a rush of coffee. The swallow has a prickly bittersweetness a combination acidic bite and hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is very smooth and full bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall an interesting, well crafted brew. Not something I would drink a lot of or drink very often; if you like coffee give it a try."
"D: Very good for a 7.5% abv stout"
"D: It drinks like a lower ABV stout with a jolt of coffee. Definitely something to enjoy over an hour or so."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured an opaque dark brown. Quarter-inch coffee-colored head dissipated in a thin oily slick of beer algae; lacing was non-existent. Strong nose of roasted coffee and lots of it, but something else as well. If I had to describe it the secondary smell was a combination of something vegetal and dirt or sour coffee grounds. Taste similar to nose, with that funky flavor lingering at the end. Mouthfeel was very lively; surprisingly so considering the lack of a head. Drinkability was okay, but overall, I was a bit disappointed."
"D - Very drinkable. One I will be picking up again. The higher alcohol is hidden very well in this one. Goes down very smooth and easy."
"Not a staple of my cellar, but I'd be happy yto give it another try, perhaps with a fresher example!"
"Pours out a dark cola, with minimal head. Nose if a mix of sweet malt and an dark espresso. Taste- sweet milk chocolate, medium roasted coffee and slight bit of lactic sourness on the finish. Hops are also noticeable on the finish. Medium bodied and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is high and overall a very tasty stout."
"D: This is a good coffee stout, but something just seems off to me. A little too sweet for my taste and a little too one dimensional in the coffee taste and not much else. Alcohol is also a little unpleasant in this. Would have this again but wouldn't seek it out. Nowhere near Founder's Breakfast but I think I still prefer this over Wake n Bake"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and well carbonated. I find it pretty drinkable despite the heavy coffee flavor. If you're not a coffee fan, it won't be near as drinkable. Nonetheless, I can't see myself drinking more than 2 in a sitting. Overall, this is a pretty fine beer. Highly recommended for coffee fans."
"D- This is a nice, drinkable stout that I will have again. I was surprised that this wasn't a lower ABV stout-because it hides the alcohol well without being too rich. Job well done by Bell's"
"D- I think i would throw this on the ""Once in a while"" list. Not one of my favs but worth a try for anybody."
"Drinkability - Definitely good! Another solid brew from Bell's. Highly recommended."
"Notes - An awesome beer for people that enjoy coffee, but the coffee character is extremely prevalent. I personally like it."
"This is a good beverage to take camping with you and have with breakfast. I get tired of the coffee flavor real fast and would not like to drink anymore then one."
"D- If I was more into coffee I could probably drink this all day long. As it is, the flavor and smell are complex enough to enjoy quite a bit."
"The flavor was more intense than I had expected. Abundant bitter, chocolatey, coffee notes paired with a boozy, warming alcohol presence that punished the palate. At first, the intensity was enjoyable, but the alcohol and bitterness began to wear on my senses. The body was uber-thick, viscous, and brought on a bitter, alcohol and coffee finish. Carbonation was almost non-existant. I imagine that if you poured a Dark Lord into a pint of Guiness, you'd end up with something close to Bell's Java Stout: thick & creamy, with an assault from the malts. Although I doubt I'll ever reach for one of these again, it would be interesting to see how a bottle of BJS holds up to a year of cellaring."
"All in all it's a very good beer worth the try coffee fans will love this. also recommend the fuel cafe if you like this one"
"Never been a coffee drinker, but if coffee was like this, it'd make me a converter."
"A Strongly crafted coffee stout well worth a try!!!"
"Overall Impression: Another really nice stout from Bell's. Coffee flavor is at a nice level, strong but not bittering or overwhelming the beer. No flaws noted, clean, if a bit simple and straightforward. I'd love a dry hopped Russian Imperial version of this! (oh, it is listed as an Imperial, hmm, a bit weak in that category then)"
"I guess if you're a coffee lover, or a java lover, then you're going to enjoy this one. Solid and complex. Everything in this beer seems to hit a good note. Recommended."
"drank this at cellar temp."
"Usually a huge fan of coffee brews and this one was definitely not one of my favorites, needs to be more mellow, like to taste more beer than java if you know what I mean, not sure if I could recommend this anyone, glad I tried it for myself nevetheless"
"D: Very good. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thoroughly enjoyed the espresso bitterness and I thought that if it weren't for that this might be considered rather pedestrian. A great coffee stout."
"Poured from 12oz bottle (thanks weisguy)...Poured a black cola color with a thick tan head. Smells is an espresso, charred malt aroma with a little chocolate smell. It has a very bitter coffee flavor that not very well balanced. The mouthfeel is great and this beer is certainly drinkable for such a dark style."
"Outside of the heavy handed coffee, it would be an outstanding beer. Even so, it's still pretty good. In the interest of equal time, K (my wife) loves this brew."
"Definately a sipper, and just the thing if you're in a mood for an edge of bitterness."
"Pours a solid black that no light gets through. Average pour almost overflowed my glass with head. We've got some carbonation in suspension here. Aroma is overwhelming with coffee. I also pick up some dried fruits and a bit of chocolate. If there was steam coming out of my glass I would think it was a flavored coffee. Taste is more roasted coffee bitterness with some creamy chocolate mixed into the fold. Creamy mouthfeel with a coffee bitterness in the finish. Solid double stout with coffee added. Another great beer from Bell's."
"Drinkability: Decent enough, but outshone by some of the other coffee stouts available."
"Overall I would have to say this one was not terribly bad at all, and in fact was quite a nice little surprise. I really enjoyed that it was not too big and it was something I actually could enjoy without being overwhelmed. I would probably pick up one of these again sometime; it was definitely a good call."
"This is the first offering from Bell's that I have been dissatisfied with."
"D - After a long day of epic skiing here in Crested Butte, I don't know if I could have picked a better beer. Refreshing for a stout with great flavor and appearance. Another winner from Bell's."
"A good beer with some qualifications, you MUST like coffee or you will hate this. Pretty much the THE coffee beer without any Bourbon in it."
"I'm not sure that I can expound on any of the other reviews already given. Big, strong coffee taste and aroma. Jet black pour, no head though. This is a good coffee stout. I should be receiving a couple of Wake and Bakes in the next few days and want to compare the two."
"Pours opaque with a massive tan head. Nose is a roasted bean kind of thing with an odd perfume edge to it. Flavor is thick with a nice robust character. On the end I get a roasted edge and that odd perfume thing comes out. It is almost like liquid flowers, with leaves and stems along for the ride. At first this seemed nice. Then that weird flowery perfume edge was kicking in way too hard and it just detracted from an otherwise interesting beer. Nice to try for the first half at least."
"Mouthfeel is where it should be for a stout of this nature. I don't care about the 7,5%abv or the heaviness of this stout. I could drink several of these throughout the course of a cold, damp evening/night. This is a truly fantastic stout! Good job, Bell's, and many, many thanks to my friend BA Ding for sharing this gem with me!"
"Deliciousness. These Bell's people sure know how to make a stout."
"Man, this stuff is amazing on-tap! I just had a few from the bottle recently so it was nice to have that to compare it to. Pour was pretty black with a cocoa tan head with not much staying power. Smell was great. Rich, roasty malts abundant here. Taste even topped the smell. Fresh roasted coffee grounds that aren't as big as from the bottle. Chocolate plays a bigger role and also a hint of oatmeal. Also the bitter finish isn't there like it is in a bottle. Unbelievable. Mouthfeel is nice and pretty full. So damn creamy and like velvet on the tongue. Trying this on-tap was definitely a step up from the bottled version. Quite enjoyable."
"I enjoy coffee and coffee stouts. I did not enjoy this stout. It may have been to bitter on the back end for my taste."
"D - I'm not impressed. I poured it out and thought, Oh my god! I was sitting in antisipation. It smelled good. The flavor is definitly coffee but it's more like the grinds left after you brew the coffee not the beans."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a creamy tan head with good lacing. The aroma is dark roasted malts and a good amount of fresh ground coffee. The taste is dark and roasty that begins smooth and malty and finishes with an explosion of bitter roasted coffee flavors. Overall, this is another great brew from Bell's and is definitely one of the better coffee stouts on the market today. Highly Recommended."
"Body is big and very creamy and smooth. Mouthfeel of melted velvet. Filling too, one is enough at a time."
"Medium-bodied with a touch too much carbonation but otherwise just right. You really have to like coffee to find this drinkable. Luckily for me I drink an entire pot every morning. This makes for an incredible bookend to a day for me!"
"D: Very nice stout but, I like their Double Cream Stout better. Definitely worth trying."
"Pours an opaque black color with a creamy, yet frothy dark tan colored head. Nice sparkling body cascades up through the glass. Plenty of lacing clings to the side of the glass with a reddish tint along the side of the foamy goodness. Smell is of sweet malt with a roasted and bitter back to it. Some light coffee aroma with a little sweet chocolate. Taste is of the roasted and dark malt and plenty of dark robust coffee, and slight vanilla sweetness as this one warms up. Mouthfeeling is a creamy, slightly velvety and more creamy, when compared to the FBS which was a much dryer robust mouth feel."
"Great for a first drink after sleeping in real late on a lazy day."
"Taste is a malty, grainy, flinty stout profile with sweetness and some added interest from the coffee, which is prominent but never overpowering. The long finish carries in some hoppy flavors. Mouthfeel is nicely balanced and silky. I could happily make this the first or last beer of the day. Great stuff."
"Smooth, a little creamy and surprisingly drinkable - almost dangerously easy to drink given the ABV. I could have another one no problem."
"This is a great coffee stout for those who like coffee. I think they really need to be big beers to carry the coffee. A bit more alcohol in this would be welcome but it is really just fine the way it is."
"Scott, to the store and buy more! Now!"
"sweet, bitter, coffee. thick, robust, coffee. it's hardly a thick brew; the only thing double, i would argue, is the alcohol. i wouldn't go as far as to call it dry, but it is definitely not the sticky mess that some imperial/double stouts are. the sweetness comes up front, but tails off, framed by a well-designed bitterness"
"The flavor and malts cling well with a slight slight creaminess, nice crispness on the palate and the slight creamienss impress me considering how much black cofee is used."
"This is what a stout should look like. Pitch black, thick bodied and a tan head with ample lacing. The smell is coffee, honey and nuts. The taste is a lot of coffee with roasted oatmeal and maybe a little bitterness. The mouthfeel is good for a higher abv brew. I could drink this beer again. This is a pretty good beer of the style."
"D - Definitely a sipper. I did enjoy it, but I don't think I could do more than one, so the score took a hit here. I'm not a big stout fan, but this was very robust and tasty. Highly recommended if you like stouts, and if you don't, it's definitely worth a try."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This brew is full bodied on the tongue and is very smooth. It feels much the same as a milk/sweet stout-smooth, velvety, and full. Alcohol is hidden pretty well and the finish is definitely not dry, leaves a slick feeling on the tongue. This is a beer that I'd have no problem drinking all day... As a matter of fact I find it to be a great way to start the day, just as with Founder's Breakfast Stout this one can easily be consumed for breakfast, goes well with the meal or as a substitute for it. This is one I'll definitely pick up again."
"I poured this black strong beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was black as tar with the darkest head I have ever seen on a beer. It was great! The beer smelled like strong coffee and indeed it tasted that way. The beer had nice balance of burnt smoked roated coffee with a thick taste to it that let you know you were really getting something with some roots to it. Yes I will buy this brew again."
"Not sure where the 7.5% abv is, i couldnt believe it was that high when i saw it on here, it is VERY well hidden. I wish i had more than one of these, it saddens me to think this was the only one i have... i guess i need to seek out more of these before winter is over.... this is one i will continue to seek out year after year."
"Heavily creamy and thick. Moderate but mellow carbonation that picks of the flavor and sharpens it a bit. Somewhat syrupy and smooth with a nice lingering finish. No real warmth because of the relatively low abv for the style. A must try beer."
"Drinkability- Man this thing is wonderful. It reminds me of Founders Breakfast Stout with a bit less complexity. I dont mean that in a bad way at all either. Its basically a Breakfast Stout with all the rough edges polished out. Man I loved this thing, big thanks tpd975!"
"Mouth on this beer is big, round, thick and creamy. This years seems to be balanced impeccably. That mouthfeel really helps the character and drinkability of this brew. Coffee flavors are rich, roasty chocolatey with hints of scotch flavors. Again dark fruits galore with that pinch of black licorice. An amazing pint of beer that will be in my glass for the night."
"Edit: After about one year of age on this beer, the flavors mellow and meld significantly and this easily becomes a 5."
"M/D: Could use a little more carbonation I think, and the body is not as big as I expected. Still, this is a highly drinkable stout regardless of the 7.50%. Very good."
"D- This is wonderful. I love this so much more than I remember. I have to go back and get what little was left at the store. Highly recommended."
"Pours out black with a chocolate milk head that laces sheets as it dies. Big roasted coffer beans in the nose with a little sweet malt. Taste is very big coffee roasted beans and grounds, also chocolate makes itself knows with a smooth as silk finish with the slightest dry finish. Its not even funny how smooth this is, and its not crazy thick. A delicious coffee stout with a drinkability that rivals all stouts. Try this."
"D: gimme more...great stuff for coffee lovers"
"Black in color with a dark brown head that foams up at the completion of the pour. Halo of a cap leaves some ok lacing. Cap is sustained by a heavy, almost cola like, carbonation level streaming to the top. Smells like a cup of coffee. I'm guessing there is some malt in there but the coffee smell really dominates. Coffee taste is front and center, followed by some bitterness and then a surprisingly smooth finish. Very creamy mouthfeel. Faint trace of the 7.5% ABV as it warms. As expected an excellent stout from Bell's."
"An excellent stout. Nice to drink. For some reason this beer made me smile while I drank it (and it was only my first of the day)"
"Good beer, up to Bells standards. Poured a jet black pint with about an inch of carmal head. Hits hard with expresso in the front and moves to a nutty taste in the middle. The thing I really liked about it was the finish which had just as strong a coffee taste as the front."
"Jet-black pour with a chewy, caramel-colored head and small trace of lacing. The smell is dark, burnt roasted malts. Not surprisingly the smell and taste combine fresh ground coffee with roasted smoky nuts and dark chocolate. What makes it unique is the strength of the coffee flavoring as it does not hold back to have a strong, black coffee ground taste that begins with each sip and remains well after finishing. By being nit-picky I'll note that the mouthfeel could be a bit thicker. Considering just how dark this beer is in taste and substance the drinkability is quite good."
"Drinkability: I could drink several of these in a sitting. Very good beer and something that I will definitely be purchasing again. Highly recommended."
"This was my first experience with a coffee stout, and it was certainly a pleasant one. I would definitely have this again, although I think the style could be done better. Now I'd like to try some of the really highly-rated coffee-infused stouts like Speedway and Breakfast (which, of course, I can't get here). I think this is a good starting point, though. Recommended."
"D: Great stout for this time of year. I'll be having more of this soon."
"i drink coffee (top shelf and usually fresh roasted) all day and beer all night. all year round. no joke. anyone that knows me will attest to this. even if i didn't, this one would still get major points. pours dark as dark gets with a huge head the color of coffee with just a splash of cream. amazing retention. actually the thing never goes away completely, and what does shrink down leaves a beautiful lace. coffee is in the nose for sure, and nice coffee at that. i heard that they use sumatra. also, some roasty malt, a hint of bittersweet chocolate and a super faint hop scent. tastes like a complex coffee does with undertones of chocolate and earthiness. on the lighter side of full body, but nice and creamy/silky. if the body was just a little creamier and full, this one would be off the charts to me. as pleasant as that first cup of joe in the morning, java stout is pure fuel for me."
"A nice winter warmer."
"Inky black with about a finger of brown head. Smells like chocolate covered coffee beans. Also a little vanilla in the flavor, but mostly the same great chocolate covered coffee beans. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Pretty easy to drink, maybe this would be good for breakfast? :)"
"Seems a little out of balance as the additives overtake the actual stout character, but a good beer if you're in the mood for coffee stout."
"Drinkability: Fairly good integration of flavours, but the coffee comes off as a bit stale. It's okay, but not spectacular."
"Pours an incredibly dark mahogany brown, near black with the slightest amber highlights. A finger of off-white head that dissolves fairly fast. Nose is lots of coffee and vegetable like bitterness. Nutty and a little sour. Taste is lots of coffee, bitter roasted malt, and some stronger sourness. Little bitter hops at the end to go along with the coffee bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel with a fairly full body. I liked this one; very unique, flavorful beer."
"D - I'm not a coffee drinker but this is a very tasty beer."
"Drinks good, not a huge fan of coffee stouts, but this one really works for me, once again, another great beer from bell's"
"Black as the ace of spades and I mean BLACK.Small brown ring with some brown patches in there.Smells of roasted malt and chocolate and some coffee.Some fruit in the taste,with some chocolate and some coffee.Very creamy mouthful.Good beer but a bit overpowering with the coffee.My least favorite Bell's beer but solid none the less."
"D - One of the freshest coffee flavors in a beer and this one is 8 months old. The only better version I have tasted is the bourbon java."
"Beer pours a black color with a fingers worth of mocha foam. The smell is intense with coffee, chocolate milk shake, cocoa, slight vanilla, toffee and subtle notes of wood or aged hops. The taste is much like the aroma, a strong coffee and chocolate malt profile upfront and a slightly dry cocoa finish. This is a very well made coffee stout. Mouthfeel and carbonation seem just right for this beer and alcohol, what alcohol? It is very well hidden behind the robust coffee and malt flavors. So far all of the Bells stouts I have had the pleasure to try are winners in my book."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a dry earthy scent that boasts of patent malts and coffee. There is a bit of chocolate malt in there as well to round out the aroma. The taste is good. It has a very dry and earthy black malt taste. It's bitter with coffee and has a bold ""black"" flavor. The alcohol is hidden well in this one. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. These guys know how to brew stouts. It's black and bold with no holding back on the coffee taste. It's dry and earthy like it's supposed to be."
"Mouthfeel is heavier and leaves the kind of lingering mouthfeel of a good dessert."
"Pours a completely opaque black with a nice two finger brown head that quickly dies down to a thin lacing but leaves a lot of stickiness. Smell is huge notes of black coffee and espresso, what else would you expect? Very sweet brown sugar and a hint of alcohol (almost whiskey like) in the nose as well. Wow, taste is amazing. Sweet malt bomb with flavors of chocolate, caramel, and espresso. Starts and finishes extremely smooth with a good hop bite mixed up there in the middle. If you don' like coffee, don't even bother with this beer. Such a smooth and creamy mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. Why doesn't this beer get more recognition? Truly an amazing beer and Bell's continues to prove they have some of the best stouts around."
"Now where's that Batch 8000?"
"Drinkability- Nothing wrong with this one. Good overall flavors and easy to drink. A poor mans breakfast stout."
"I really like this beer. By far, the best coffee beer I have had. They have managed to make it taste like a good cup of strong high quality coffee in beer form. Not over the top, just beautifully balanced, and tastes like fresh brewed coffeee, not coffee grounds. Terrapin, take notes! Pours bloack with a thin dark tan head that fades quickly. Smell is fresh ground coffee beans up front, followed by subtle notes of vanilla, cherry, raspberry, cream, and some faint bitterness. The taste is wonderful. Lingering fresh strong fruity coffee followed by a grainy roastiness, chocolate and vanilla and another hit of stout bitterness at the end. So beautifully balanced. The mouthfeel is creamy and silky but with some good tannins to refresh the palate. Wonderfully drinkable- I know I shouldn't have a lot of this, but like a strong wonderful coffee in the morning, sometimes I just can't help having another cup, er... glass."
"The body here is kinda flimsy for a stout. Carbonation is fine, no alcohol taste. Easy to drink."
"Pours an opaque brown, thick brown head forms, lots of spotty lace, good retention, forms a solid ring. Smell is sweet, very fruity, coffee, light roast, chocolate, bit of caramel, pretty nice. Taste is sweet up front, almost cherry fruitiness, caramel, settles in a roasted chocolate and coffee grind, some roasted bitterness, coffee is nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is thick, full bodied, with low carbonation, nice. Thanks for picking up Lexx!"
"Bells please barrel age some of this, you may have something to rival Founders KY stout."
"Bottle courtesy of Plucier: Poured a deep pitch-black color stout with a nice big foamy head with great retention and great lacing. Aroma of medium dry coffee is well balance with roasted malt and light subtle dark chocolate. Taste of nice coffee without being too overpowering and some nice medium bitter roasted malt. Texture is quite creamy which is appreciated with a quite full body and some adequate carbonation. I thought this was a very well done and well balance example of a coffee stout."
"Taste is mild coffee, but it does overrule all the other flavors in this beer. There is also some burned notes that probably come from the dark malts. Some alcohol is evident, which also gives a warming mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is not smooth, rather sharp maltbitter and not smooth. Body is medium. This beer comes across as being decent, but after having a whole glass the strong coffee notes start to bore me."
"D: Damn. I might have to move to a state where they sell Bell's. Enough said."
"Stouts kinda have a coffee thing going anyway so not sure why there even needs to be a coffee stout, but I gave it a whirl. Looks like most stouts. Smell, whoaa! yes it's coffee, but mostly old coffee grounds, also has a twang. Taste, at first this was a tough one to drink, and I had let it warm. As I drank it the flavors mellowed and I actually started to enjoy it, almost like and Irish coffee, but not as sweet. I would have another sometime, maybe even give to a coffee lover as a gift. I suggest take a couple of good gulps then put it down for 10 min. or so."
"Pours an opaque black with an off-white head that quickly diminishes to a ring. The aroma is strong on fresh roasted coffee with roasted malts not far behind. The taste is dominated by coffee with the usual roasted malt of a stout and just a touch of bitter chocolate right behind it. The beer is medium bodied with the alcohol fairly well hidden but providing a touch of warmth. While this beer is certainly more appropriate for cold weather, it is still very enjoyable even on a warm spring evening."
"D- This beer has a big cold coffee grounds flavor that is a bit to much but it does have good malt supporting the coffee flavors. The coffee flavors are to much off flavors but the malt flavors underneath are pretty nice."
"This beer exhibited a very nice dry-roasted aroma, like nice coffee. Flavor is also very pleasantly coffee-ish with a bit of sweetness and a dry mouthfeel. I thought this beer was very drinkable and delicious. This beer is a beer that is highly sessionable, yet offers up a serious amount of dry roasted coffee-ness. Highly recommended."
"Some coffee beers don't really commit to the java flavor, well this one is balls to the wall.It made it a bit more of a sipper for me and in many ways drinks more like coffee than beer. There's a full mouthfeel behind the dark-roasted coffee flavor from the malt, along with some complimentary bitterness. A coffee lover's dream, sort of reminds me of Surly's Coffee Bender, but a little heavier."
"drinkability is great. balanced and very enjoyable."
"D: A bit ""much"" to drink too much of at a time, but a well-made beer. I'd drink again."
"Very good, but I don't see having more than one at a sitting. The coffee taste was getting a bit overpowering after one."
"Brought back from a recent trip to ohio poured into a snifter. Pours a pitch motor oil black with a fluffy tannish head that leaves some serious lace on the glass. Smell is of exotic coffee very strong coffee smell, also some roasted malt and barley in the nose. Taste is like a strong coffee flavor, boy I am in love with coffee and just found its counterpart in a exotic beer. This stuff is amazing it is so complex and has different layers of coffee in it goes from sweet to bitter to just plain delicous. This is a very fine offering and one of my favorites, Damn Bell's please come to S. Florida."
"Very nice for the style and a fantastic use of coffee."
"My excitement grew as I poured a thick, jet black brew with a huge tan head. Kind of looked like the Southern Tier Jah-Vaa that everyone loves. Unfortunately, the taste did not live up to my expectations. Coffee/espresso flavors were present, but mild. Big alcohol presence. Mild hops. Kind of tasted like burnt malts in there. It wasn't necessarily bad, it just wasn't great. However, I will say that these were pretty cheap, so compared to other great coffee stouts, this isn't a bad option at all."
"Poured out liquid black with no head whatsoever. The nose is big time fresh roasted coffee, some smoke, a bit of malt. There might be other stuff but the coffee is overpowering. The taste is like sucking on cold carbonated coffee. Has a medium bodied mouthfeel, a little slick, with good carbonation. If you like coffee, this is a nice beer with good coffee taste. If like me you don't like coffee, it becomes a less drinkable beer."
"D - Taking this for what it is, it's a pretty tasty beer, but there are much better stouts, even from Bell's, that are just as atainable."
"Will definitely not try this again."
"A good stout to finish out a cold dreary day, but not something i can foresee for a session."
"12 oz. bottle, batch 7768 - packaged 12/21/06, sampled after breakfast on 3/6/07. It's not the official Breakfast Stout, but it's a close enough cousin, so I figured why not. It pours black into the chalice, thins near the edges, and is topped with a 1/4"" brownish head that reduces to a nice collar, leaving little lacing. The bouquet is complex and delightful, with rich, roasted coffee right off the bat, closely followed by charred malts and sweet milk chocolate. There are additional notes of powdery cocoa, sweet cake batter, Oreos?, blackberry, and perhaps some piney hops. Upon tasting, my first impression is that of a milk stout brewed with coffee, balanced by a touch of green hops. To elaborate, there are roasted, coffee, and burnt malts, a big blast of espresso, a medium hoppy/roasted bitterness, a dash of green apple, and maybe some lactic sweetness. The mouthfeel is amazing - smooth and silky (like a milk or oatmeal stout), quite dry, with a medium to light body that has fine, active carbonation due to the conditioning. This is a great beer - it is smooth and refined in both flavor and mouthfeel, and manages to taste strongly of coffee without overwhelming the palate. Will definitely revisit at some point."
"There's some chocolate noted, and the beer is a bit drying in the finish, and could use a bit thicker mouthfeel, but make no mistake - this is mostly about coffee. If ya can't stand coffee, no need to bother. Otherwise, give it a shot."
"Ominously dark in the pour with seemingly little head at first but then a good finger's worth of toffee/bronze-colored bubbles that mostly fall away to a persistent lace. The smell is predictably studded with coffee, though some roasty notes are present as well. Until this one sat and warmed a bit, there was an unpleasant note of cigarette smoke in the mix. The mouthfeel is as smooth and creamy as I remember it being--very drinkable. Coffee and chocolate complement the roasty grains with a nice touch of almost spicy bitterness thrown in. Not too shabby."
"The perfect beer for mornings or evenings when you want a cup of coffee but a beer just seems more appropriate. I'm not sure if it's quite as good as goose island's black cat, but it's close. My only complaints would be that the head was a little thin. I would prefer a thicker, more espresso like crema. I need to try this on tap."
"It poured a straight up (coffee without milk or sugar) coffee ink black with a few murky brown and ruby red highlights here and there. You straight up coffee drinkers will notice the similarities between the color of your coffee and this beer. It had a thin layer of tan colored foam that dissipated away in a matter of a few seconds and into a few tan rings and tan colored bubbles that acted as its lace around the glass. The beer smelled like you've walked into your favorite coffee house while they were brewing a chocolate flavored coffee or espresso. No malt, no hops, just a straight up chocolate flavored coffee or espresso aroma. It tasted like your favorite coffee house has just added a shot hazelnut flavoring to your chocolate flavored coffee or espresso. Like the aroma, no hops, no malt, just a straight up chocolate flavored coffee or espresso with a drop of hazelnut added to it. The label said that it was brewed coffee, but I think it was brewed with way too much coffee. They don't call it a ""Java Stout"" for nothing. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a thick aftertaste that's reminiscent of the aftertaste you get after drinking down a cooled down cup of Joe. I know they call it ""Java Stout," but it's really just a one dimensional beer. I would have liked to taste more than just coffee. While I was drinking this, I questioned if this was really a beer. About half way through, I found myself bored of this beer. I doubt I'll drink this Bell's beer again because it's a tad boring and I already know what black coffee tastes like."
"Mouthfeel is ultra smooth, even carbonation that lasts. Very easy to have several in a sitting. My favorite session coffee stout."
"This is made for a coffee drinker, hence the name, so if you don't like coffee, stay away! Otherwise, this is a nice Java Stout and a fairly solid offering."
"Medium to full bodied, but quite smooth with alcohol completely hidden. It would be hard to drink several of these due to the infusion of coffee, but something I would drink again. I'd even recommend this to coffee-haters thanks to its balance."
"overall this beer is really realyl nice I enjoyed around 55 degrees very nice wow"
"Pours a nice clean dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, nice sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet roasted malts, slight hops, nice coffee/caramel. The taste is delicious of sweet roasted malts and coffe/caramel, the finish is slightly dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an awesome ADS, very tasty indeed."
"Overall: I think this might be one of the most unique stouts I have ever had. I liked it and would drink it again, but definately not all the time. Thanks go out to ggaughan for yet another great Bells beer."
"Overall a very good coffee beer. If you like coffee flavors in your beer, you'll like this."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours very dark brown, with a half inch tan head. Whoa, you can really smell the coffee in this beer. I can also smell some malt and a bit of chocolate, but coffee is the main smell by far. Taste is mostly coffee, with some malt/chocolate sweetness at first. Then the coffee taste kicks in, and finishes with a slight lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit slick, and the body is medium but a little thinner than I expected. Drinkability is good, it's nice and smooth and goes down easy. If you like coffee, you'll like this beer. I think it's pretty decent, but I don't think I could drink more than 2-3 in a sitting, but it's definitely worth trying."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and rounded. Medium to full bodied."
"Black pour. A thick 1"" beige head is gone before you know it. Faint coffee aroma, more about burnt sugar and...band aids? Bleh. Taste is ye olde soy sauce stout with a touch of coffee maybe. Not in your face coffee taste like Speedway, more of a ""it says java on the label, so I must be tasting coffee"" taste. Carbonation is high, mouthfeel is thin. Alcohol is a bit more noticeable than it should be. Not going back to this one."
"As if you couldn't tell from my review heretofore, it is not too particularly drinkable. I will not buy any more of this after my six pack is finished. I knew I should have topped off my case with an additional Hopslam or Expedition... :-/"
"Dark as concentrated coffee with a tan head that leaves some lacing. The smell is of old coffee gone cold with the mix of choclate tones and some pleasent soft sweetness. The flavor comes out strong of coffee but fades to roasty burnt flavors with a lift of malt. The body is a little thinner than most stouts but it works with the coffee premiss. Truly a better option than redbull and vodka to get a little perk in a session."
"Bottle courtesy of JohnnyM2002."
"Full bodied with a creamy but slightly oily mouthfeel."
"D---The ultimate coffee experience. Now this is a beer to start your day off on the right foot."
"Nevermind that. Now open, it pours a deep, rich ruby-black color with a burnt orange head which clings to the glass in a unformulaic webbed pattern. It's bubbly too, with a lot of noticeable carbonation at the bottom of the brew. My premonition, however, did not come true, because the coffee smell here is nice, but not overwhelming; not enough to penetrate the bottle prior to opening. Wishful thinking on my part, perhaps. But there is a coffee/chocolate aroma here, with hints of smoke, wood, and dark fruit. Not an unpleasant aroma, but nothing special. But everything comes together in the taste. The coffee taste is powerful but spot-on. Mellows out with chocolate and some vanilla flavoring. Sweet and malty up front, but finishes with some balancing hops as well. This is kinda like eating a chocolate-covered coffee bean with a patch of dried fruit sitting in your cheek. Sturdy mouthfeel that develops more as the beer rises to room temp. Not everyone is going to like this beer, but if you're a fan of stouts you should give this a try. And especially if you like coffee-flavored stouts. This ranks among the top in that category. Another well-done brew by Bell's."
"Looks like...well, it looks like a stout in a glass. Smells like...cherry/rum pipe tobacco, chocolate and suede. It tastes a little leathery and musty, funky, with notes of coconut infused rum, or is it rum soaked curried nuts?. There is a faint coffee-like roast on the finish, and I'm getting a lot of nuances that one normally finds in a bourbon-barrel stout. I have to say this beer is really commanding my full attention. Medium-full body with sweetness flirting with the bitterness. It goes back and forth before finishing bitter. This is something I only want one of, but not because it's too filling or heavy or rich etc. but just because it delivers so much on my senses all around that one is enough to get the idea. I get it - good idea! I think it's Sumatran coffee which explains the earthy, leathery funkiness. Rad."
"Overall a good niche beer, especially if coffee is your thing."
"This is a really great coffee stout, very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable, just like a decent cup of coffee is enjoyable; but it fails the complexity test"
"I wouldn't advise this for your last beer of the night as I'm pretty sure the coffee is enough to keep you up for at least a bit. I have to wonder how this would taste on tap, I can just imagine the intensity of the flavors would just be off the chart."
"Superb drinkability. Lots of coffee and dark roasted malts. All the flavors work well together and the aroma is really inviting. Pretty easy to put down a few if I wanted to and definately something I would pick up again. I find this somewhat similar to the Terrapin Wake-n-Bake stout I normally get down here. I think I'll try a side-by-side with my remaining bottle of this."
"-Oelergud"
"The beer poured a syrupy black back that had an ever so slight brown head to it which dissipated rather quickly. The aroma was nothing more then just coffee. Well there also was a slight presence of alcohol in the nose but mainly it was an overwhelming aroma of coffee. The taste was to no suprise coffee. All I could figure out in the taste was coffee with some alcohol. If I have a coffee stout I would like the nose and the taste to have at least a little hint of stout. The beer moved slowly over my tounge the way a double stout should, with a slight alcohol warming to it. This beer left me rather unimpressed and not wanting another one."
"Draft at KClingers Tavern, Hanover PA. What a beauty! This emits a perfect coffee aroma and the beer's flavor is like sweet coffee from Starbucks. Even my non-beer drinking friend loved it. Lightly bittered, cold coffee in a glass. Excellent stout, if you like the coffee-flavored variety. (#2654, 1/14/07)"
"The pour into my Sam Smith pint raises a negligible head the color of creamed coffee. It fades to an even smaller glass ring after only a few seconds. Lacing is spotty but stubborn. The body is utterly black. The nose is bursting with rich, bittersweet coffee aroma, and for my nose, that's it. It smells like concentrated cold coffee. Pleasant, though. The taste has more to it than the smell. The coffee flavor is not all-dominant, but still of course a huge portion of the flavor profile. There are definite roasted malt and chocolate flavors hiding behind the coffee. There is a very nice lasting bitter coffee flavor in the back of the throat, too. I feel that the heavy body and lighter carbonation make this beer sit perfectly in the mouth. A fine beer, one that I probably will revisit after this first sixer."
"This isn't as complex as a beer as I expected based on my past experiences with Bells products. Not as much going on, but the coffee, chocolate and roasted flavors are still very tasty."
"Thanks to melbatoast93 for sending this back in October."
"Drinkability is pretty good, I really enjoy coffee beers, I'd love to try this beer with a different roast applied to the coffee beans used or a different bean. It would be cool to see a brewer do a coffee stout series with different beans. Time to fire up the homebrew kit!"
"Medium bodied, an ok stout, but I think they failed to give this beer a really pleasant coffee character."
"D: Its pretty much burnt coffee but with some stout characteristics added to it. Thats what they were going for and thats what they got. It did not wow me in any way, which let me down a bit; I love coffee and thought I would love this beer. Sadly, I did not... Not bad, but a ""pass.."" in my book."
"Wow! I personally found this brew outstanding. It reminds me of being in Miami and ordering a shot of Cuban expresso coffee. Poured a dark brown with a 3 inch mocha brown head that fully lasted throughout the drink. Also, left a excellent amount of sticky lacing. The aroma was an intense expresso coffee with a hint of molasses and licorice. The flavor was long lasting and coffee bitter sweet from start to finish. Felt thck, full body, creamy, softly carbonated with a small hint of alcohol. Overall, I could drink this all day, which I did and I can't wait to get back to Columbus to buy some more."
"Overall, a very interesting beer, I remember it being much more smoother, but then again, I also remember when I could fit into a size 32 waist pair of pants. Quite drinkable considering the ABV, but hardley a session beer."
"Another fantastic stout from Bell's. You've got to be a coffee drinker to like this one though...."
"$1.99 for a single. Pours, well, black, as a stout should. Head retention is lacking though. Aroma is, well, coffee like, roasty, slightly sweet, perhaps as well. Taste is roasted malts and a hint of expresso that shows up stronger in the finish. It's a good beer, it's solid, but lacking alot of character that I have come to expect from big stouts."
"Overall, first off coffee stouts are my thing. This version has monster coffee taste with a chocolate finish, but the strength of the coffee overshadows other tastes. Tasty and drinkable overall."
"D: If you love coffee....this is the brew for you! Drink it with breakfast or for a late night eye opener, it does'nt matter because this beer is good any time of the day. Not a session beer as it is thick and rich but damn good none the less!"
"Bottle received in a trade from hoppymeal -- many thanks! Batch number 7221; I'm assuming this is from last winter. Deep, dark-chocolate brown with a lovely light brown mocha head. No light gets through, but this still retains a definitively ""brown"" hue as opposed to out and out ""black"". Huge dark roasted coffee aroma, earthy and slightly burnt, with a thick Hershey's Dark chocolate syrup backbone and some slight toffee notes. This is getting me pretty excited, as the nose is really reminding me of the heavenly scent of Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout.... Okay, so KYBS it is not, but it is certainly a delicious coffee stout: roasted grounds bite the palate bitterly right away and linger to strafe the tastebuds throughout the swallow. There is a mildly astringent black malt flavor in the middle which approaches the point of sourness until it is overtaken by the dark bitterness of the coffee. I wish it had a bit more of the chocolate I detected in the aroma appearing in the taste. For that reason I'd say that, unless you like rather like coffee (as I do), this may come across as sort of one-dimensional. As it warms, a bit of oak character emerges, but it still doesn't make up for the chocolate the nose led me to expect. Despite this, the flavor is quite tasty, all told. Light in body for the style, and the alcohol is completely hidden, making for a very drinkable coffee stout. Definitely fits the bill when in the mood for a coffee-infused beer, more so at least than any other coffee beer I've tried."
"D - I like the Black Majic better, as this is a little sweet for me, but I will definitely have this again."
"Appears black with a big brown head, some lacing. Smells of fresh brewed coffee. Tastes like straight up black coffee. Very smooth and tangy from the coffee overload. A nice drinkable beer that I won't mind having again, and I don't even like coffee."
"Drinkability can be an adventure. But a fun adventure. Heavy & intense cofee flavors without much sweetness is not for the meak. It will grow hair on your chest. I really enjoyed it. Not sure how many I could drink, but I'd have it during any breakfast!"
"Black with ruby highlights around edges of glass. Creamy tan head dissipates to leave a thin ring around the rim. Huge coffee smell, no surprise there. That taste pretty much overpowers everything else. Heavy and deep, dark roasted coffee with a slight chocolately aftertaste. Followed up with a long and bitter finish. Mouthfeel was on the chalkier side. Tough one for me to get through but is unique for a stout to have this flavor. Respectable for what it is, my least favorite stout so far, but I am not a coffee drinker."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, a little bit filling, this one is a perfect sipper but you can still knock a few back fairly quickly, another excellent Bells product."
"This is a coffee stout that lives up to its billing. This beer pours a deep, dark black with a very substantial and slow fading head. It smells strongly of coffee--and not just any coffee! This brew smells just like a fine espresso and tastes a good bit like one as well. Other coffee brewed beers will have an undernote of coffee, but this one puts its 'beans' up front. The result is a very pleasant beer that drinks a bit heavy but fully satisfies in the flavor department."
"This a great stout from Bell's,it blows away the cherry stout from Bell's that I drank last night. Anybody that loves stout must try this beer."
"Expensive six-pack, but worth it."
"Poured from bottle into a pint glass, beer is black - opaque with a nice two finger sudsy head. The smell is of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. The initial taste is slightly sweet and of coffee, followed by a slightly alcoholic, smooth finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied, with a slight amount of creamy carbonation. The overall drinkability of this beer is actually higher than what I had expected; not a bad brew."
"For better or for worse, this a 'love it or sort of like it' kind of beer. It's the latter for me, a non-coffee drinker. If you have that java monkey on your back when you wake up in the morning, and if you have the day off, I can't imagine a better way to start the day than with a bottle of Bell's Java Stout. I'll stick with Kalamazoo and Expedition though, thanks."
"Cheers!"
"D: The bottom line: if you're a coffee drinker, you'll love this stout. If not, find something else to drink."
"Pours a thick mudd, coffee black/brown that could float a spoon on its oily surface. Good deep brown head with decent retention and strong lacing until about half way through the brew. Good tart coffee brewing aroma mixed with some dark bakers' chocolate and toffee cream. Good presentation of the java juice flavor. Just a peg below from the Founder's Breakfast stout. Just not as thick on the way down. Good chocolate and molasses like sweetness with hints of thick cream and brown sugar in the finish. Oily, yet velvety texture that gives an overall smooth contour."
"D - I recently fell into a small stockpile of Bell's through trades and a beer expedition to Westy's with akorsak...after trying all of them, this is my favorite. I also found it to be a good accompaniment to meals, not just with (or in place of) dessert. If you have the opportunity, pick some up!"
"Verdict: I have now gone through two 6-packs before reviewing this beer, I had no clue it was at 7.5% ABV. I have found one of my new favorites, a great balance of coffee and beer. I like beers that are more coffee than beer, but their drinkablity is greatly reduced because of this. Java Stout goes down so well I keep looking at my glass and going ""Oh crap, I am already more than half done?"""
"D: An excellent choice to start Thanksgiving, big and bold with a nice balance between the coffee intensity and roasted depth of the stout. Sitting on this for year was a good idea."
"if you like coffee and not beer this is you if you like beer but not coffee forget it if you like beer but hate coffee dont even try but i would say this is a definite recommend and also a nice rebound from the ""hell hath no furry"""
"This thing is all coffee, all coffee. It pours black with a nice tan rocky head that sticks around. There is no malt, no hops, just coffee, really, just coffee. It is a nice drinking beer, and was shocked to see it listed with such a high abv, must be sneaky because there is just a slight hint of it in the back. A nice beer, but for me, not one to drink one after another."
"Filled from the growler station at the Party Source in Bellevue, Kentucky. This is absoultely pitch black, with a thick creamy tan head. Great head retention. Aroma is huge on coffee, not quite to espresso, but well roasted and earthy. The first delight is the mouthfeel, this baby is thick and creamy. Coffee and cream flavors play well together. Big and robust, but well balanced. Finishes with mocha flavors. Nice patches of lace coat the sides of the glass as it is drank. This is a gem. If you don't like coffee, you may not like this. I do, and did. Very well made, another solid beer from Bell's."
"Aquired this stout in a trade with BigErn. Served slightly chilled in a pint glass. Poured a deep shiny black that no light could pass through. Came up with about an inch of creamy coffee brown/tan head that had decent retention and left generous amounts of lace on my glass. Smelled strongly of burnt coffee, mocha, and some hints of sweet toffee. Tasted of bitter roasted coffee, chocolate, slight notes of black licorice. nice medium bodied mouthfeel. Rather drinkable. Fours across the board."
"Wow, what a wonderful beer. These have been sitting in my closet a couple of months, and they might even be better fresh. If you get a chance to try this wonderful brew, do so!"
"Good brew for those that like coffee a lot. This is a great brew for those of us that aren't into coffee that much either."
"Can't thank mynie enough for the bottle. i WILL be getting more of this soon, even if I have to drive to Kalamazoo myself."
"I am not a fan of coffee and have only drunk about 5 or 6 cups my entire life. It's not that I don't like it mixed with milk and sugar but my reasoning is why drink something if you have to dilute it and change its whole nature(of course this doesn't apply to beer!!!). I'd much rather just drink a Pepsi (well now a Diet Pepsi). I don't mind it at as an additive or flavoring and thus my like for it in beer. This however is too much. Usually with coffee stouts there is a balance with chocolate and/or smokiness but this is overpowering smoky coffee to the extreme. Not a bad flavor at all just too much of it. Kind of like knocking knickers with a Starbucks expresso machine. Now that you've knocked it up you have to take care of your little java tar baby for the next 18 years. All right that's a bit dramatic...the next 18 seconds. ; )"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle marked batch #7170 into a pint glass. Appearance is a syrupy opaque blackish-brown with a thin dark beige ring of head that quickly fell away to a light tan circle of sticky lacing. Aroma is rich, deep and dark coffee aromas with some strong roasty malt character present. Sweet chocolaty notes finish out the nose. Taste is hard-hitting, huge coffee and espresso, sinfully decadent rich and bold roasty malts and chocolate. Slightly drying bitter aftertaste just like a good cup of coffee. Mouthfeel is heavy, full-bodied profile with a syrupy viscosity that just coats the mouth as it goes. Carbonation is on the lower levels of the spectrum, slight tickle on the tongue is the only noticeable carbonation present. Drinkability is great, very satisifying rich stout, hardly hints towards the 7.5% abv. Would purchase again, I recommend it."
"Fresh roasted coffee, more like espresso (again those Edy's chocolate chips come to mind) overpowers the palate. No cream like taste to this one, just pure caffeinated java, with a touch of sweetness midsip. Finish is exactly like that of coffee, bitter and drying. By far the most intense coffee flavor I've encountered in a beer."
"Pours dark, with a nice tan laced head. You can smell the roasted coffee from the first pour. The first taste is an immediate blast of strong java, then smooths out with the alcohol and co-mingled chocolate. There is a strong roasted java taste left on the palate after every drink. Although the coffee taste kind of kicks you in the mouth, it's quite drinkable. I've had a whole growler of this beer. A nice stout to occasionally drink, but not something I would put in the weekly rotation. If you like coffee stouts this is a must try."
"This is drinkable like desert, but drinkable like a port. It's not a session beer, but is drinkable in its own right. Like having a chocolate mousse and cappucino for desert... yummy. Thank you felonious. I must find more of this one."
"Overall this is very good and I would love another one sometime."
"Pours black, yet still has an unmistakable brown hue to pair with a brown head. Coffee overwhelms the aroma and when you finally take a sip, you think you are drinking a nice cup of joe, just without the caffine and warmth. Burnt flavor doesn't emerge until the end and the mouthfeel is a bit thinner than you might expect for one of Bell's stouts, but a spot on match for a coffee beverage. The thing is that even when you exhale, you still get more coffee flavor. I don't think this is the most drinkable beer on the market, but from the other coffee stouts I have tried, it is delicious and I would not mind having another. Nice effort, it is just that the style begs the question: why don't you simply order a nice warm cup of joe?"
"Drinkability- Very drinkable if you like coffee, and I do. This one is a winner."
"Pours out very dark, with a nice tan head leaving a good lacing and plenty of head stays on top. The name says it all, this one definately smells rich of coffee. If you don't care for coffee, it might be too strong, but to me it smells awesome. Taste starts with a bit of coffee, and then some sort of green flavor comes in, not strong, but I can only seem to describe it as fresh vegetables straight from the garden, then the taste shifts back into a bitter chocolate flavor before joining back up with the coffee for a choco-coffee finish. Med-high carbonation, thin little bubbles bounce around on the tongue, light bodied and pretty dry. Mouthfeel doesn't say Double Stout, says more Irish Dry Stout to me. I imagine this would be nice just about any time during the day, breakfast would fit in well with this, but it becomes a bit cloying by the end, one bottle would be enough. Definately worthy of a try and I could see myself having more, but probably wouldn't break my regular lineup."
"Pours deep, sludgy black with minimal head. The liquid rolls around almost like mercury. Dark chocolates and ground espresso beans on the nose. Some creamy, milky smells in there, too, but the emphasis is on dry and dusty coffee grounds. Sweet-and-bitter up front, but the sweetness fades from its high dextrin level to a faint, faint backdrop to the dry, bitter espresso notes. The finish is all coffee, and it feels like coffee in the mouth. I imagine that hardcore coffee/espresso fans would be big fans of this, but for others, the coffee bitterness is too unattentuated by malt (or other) sweetness to be very drinkable."
"Bell's Java Stout pours a dark black with a brown head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Coffee dominates the aroma. The flavor has a nice coffe aftertaste, some nuttiness, and some strange, green flavor, almost like green pepper (but not). Green coffee perhaps? Definitely worth a try if you like coffee flavored stouts."
"Pours black with a good size, creamy light brown head. Strong smell of roasted coffee beans and a dry smokiness. Most of the sweetness from the malts gets lost in the coffee aroma, however, there is a little chocolate and also a little black licorice sweetness, not overly anise flavored but just a hint. Taste is a tangy milky sweetness up front with a dry, slightly bitter roasted coffee finish. A little acidic-ness/sourness in the coffee aftertaste as well. Medium bodied and creamy, alcohol is hidden completely. Very good breakfast style stout, the coffee flavors and aromas come through well, I'm not sure I could do more than two or three of these before the coffee taste would wear on my palette, not to mention the alcohol content, but a very nice treat."
"Excellent bottle conditioning paste on the bottom! A good swirling brought up all the yeast goodies for a splendid ending."
"Overall a pretty decent beer for the coffee lover."
"no head, very dark and syrupy looking. lots of lacing (enough to comment on at least). looks very dark and think and tasty. whoo! this beer smells more like coffee than any toher i've had. sweet fresh coffee beans with some dark chocolate odors too. super coffee flavor. very sweet too. kind of like a cold expresso with 3 spoonfuls of sugar and some cream. just a tiny bit of bitterness , either from hops or coffee, its hard to tell. vey thick and fun to drink. one of my favorites from Bell's, which is saying something."
"Low carbonation, full body. Very rich and smooth in the mouth. Just as it should be for this beer, very satisfying."
"This is a beer for the coffee lover. Actually this is a beer for anyone since I don't like coffee but I really enjoyed this beer. I think I'll start drinking this in the morning."
"A flavorful and bold blend of roasted goodness. Keeping with the stylings of the Bells stout clan, there is a substantial sweetness, but I find it blends well with the heap o roastedness. A substantial brew"
"Great beer."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is awesome! Silky smooth in the mouth with a slight carbonation in the back of the mouth and in the nose which gives way to a bitter burnt coffee finish. Drinkability is high provided you like the taste of coffee. What a wonderful tasting stout. I could have one of these for breakfast and it would rival an iced coffee."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer has a nearly full body. The beer is almost balanced. The beer has a nice creamy mouthfeel. The beer is a highly drinkable and quaffable beer. I enjoyed this from start to finish."
"D - high, a coffee drinkers beer, if i were a coffee drinker id like this more, as i am not and still like it alot must count for something, well done Bell's"
"Taste: Espresso, black malt, and dark chocolate. This beer does have a strong astringency in my mouth and leaves it feeling very dry. I love the beers made by Bells but I have to say I call the balance of this beer into question. The burnt flavor is almost a little over the top. Next time Ill just pick up two packs of the Expedition Stout."
"Poured as dark as the night with a mocha colored head that was thick and left behind rings of lacing. The high viscosity of the beer was apparent as soon as I poured it; very appealing. Big bold bubbles were scattered about the surface giving it a frothy look. Aromas of slow roasted coffee, brown sugar, fresh bread, and malt seemed evident. The taste was dominated by expresso-like flavors with bitter coffee dominating the initial and end of each sip. In between was a creamy and slighly chewy blast of sweetness. Great depth and flavors; like having a beer and coffee at the same time, but in a good way. Over time, the sweetness became more dominant and near the end of my pint, it was too rich to fully enjoy. I wouldn't be able to have more than an pint or two of this so the drinkability takes a hit."
"Drinkability is ok lots of Java aromas and flavors but overall not a big stout and not much going on except the Java. If in the mood for a coffee stout I would look elsewhere if I could get the good stuff in Tenn."
"Very dark brown with a medium-sized, dark tan, slowly diminishing head. The smell and taste are both dominated by coffee. I know thats the point of a java stout, but I think this was taken just a little too far. Theres an excellent chocolaty, sweet malt presence in there which Id like to be able to see a little more of in this beer. Its still a good beer, just nothing stellar and not my cup of tea. I mean coffee. Very nice mouthfeel though."
"Black with mahogany highlights, the beer looked thick as it poured out of the bottle. Thin, dark brown head even after agitation, spotty lacing. Rich roasted, coffee ground aroma with just a hint of nuttiness peeking through. Coffee flavour and bitterness throughout, there's a bit of milk chocolate sweetness in there as well. Low carbonation, creamy texture, full body - quite luxurious. Very enjoyable, even for someone who doesn't drink coffee (me). Intense coffee character makes this beer less than complex, but it does exactly what it sets out to do - and in fine form!"
"Perfect for after diner or a rainy afternoon, this is more coffee then stout. It pours like an ice coffee with only a thin dark leathery head. Earthy and roasted nut overtones come more from the coffee then the malt. I think I will save a couple bottles for use in the ice cream machine. Yummmm."
"I really recommend giving this a try. ..but make sure it isn't too cold..."
"If you love stouts then you should seek this one out right now. You don't know what you are missing."
"This is a quirky brew. In your face. Unapologetic. It doesn't get my money back guarantee offer, because I don't know if you have the same tastes I do, but I will say that if you dig coffee, seek this one out. It might just be your fetish, like it is for me."
"pours a deep dark brown, almost black, with a medium tan 1 finger head in a snifter glass. head is loose and drops to a thin cap after a couple of minutes. aroma is huge coffee. maybe more coffee aroma here than in any other beer i've experienced. once you get past the coffee there's also a big burned, roasty and woody aroma with a touch of alcohol at random points during the drink. unbelievable fresh coffee bean aroma. if you couldn't have guessed, this also tastes like crazy coffee. there is a decent hop bitterness to balance and a nice chocolatey, malty finish. nice how it's just bitter enough to mimic a coffee bitterness instead of a ris. the mouthfeel is a nice and thick medium body with a low to medium carbonation. the drinkability is good despite this being more of a sipper. alcohol is well masked with some warming kicking in at the end. overall, this is very much like an alcoholic, hopped and carbonated iced coffee. if you like coffee, you'll love this beer, but if you don't like coffee, then you may hate it. excellent example, and excellent from a snifter. give me this over a coffee porter any day."
"overall, this is a coffee lovers dream, i would gladly substitue this beer for coffee along with desserts, i bet a scoop of ice cream would be fabulous in this one. I like this a lot!"
"Combining two favorite beverages does work."
"Drinkability is good. I actually liked this a bit more out of the bottle than on draft. Carbonation, at least, has settled just enough to make it decent."
"i want this year round but it fits best in the cooler seasons."
"drinkability: very drinkable, but I would prefer to drink one a night and spread out the enjoyment"
"Make room for another Bell's that delivers...if you like the style, this is a must try."
"A fairly thick stout with coffee grounds. Wake up and smell the coffee. Java and roast including burnt ground taste, Ok for some, but not my type of stout. Marvellous appearance, with the dark head. Creamy yet mouth numbing. Bitter and roasty aftertaste."
"Pours deep jet black color with a small deep tan head that falls to an almost complete skin over top of the brew. Good looking stuff. The aroma hit me immediately after opening the bottle. Lots of coffee. No doubting that this is a java stout. There is a really nice sweetness in there too, very much chocolatey, but dominated with coffee. It almost smells like a mocha shake. I am a fan. Flavor is all coffee upfront. A little mocha creeps in after swallowing with some lighter chocolate notes, but it is a bit one dimensional. A modest bitter comes through on the finish, thought its not apparent if this is from the coffee or hopping. Don't get me wrong...I like it, but I'd like to see more going on with it. Feel is chewy thick, with a very minimal carbonation. Not too thick where it gets in the way of the brew. I think the feel really compliments the brew. Alcohol is not apparent on this brew. I think this is a nice brew, thought I'd like to see the coffee a bit less with some more malty character coming through to balance. Bell's keeps me coming back."
"Mouthfeel is medium. Just right. This brew is thick enough to inspire love and thin enough to inspire a great drinkability. This is a very worthy pick up that is a fine breakfast stout."
"Very nice stout. Rich but not incredibly heavy. Quite drinkable."
"DSimply great! I love the coffee flavor in this stout. Think I will have a few more. Wonder if it will keep me awake tonight? Perhaps I should have this in the morning instead of coffee?"
"This brew pours an opaque black color. The head is two-and-a-half-fingers in height, creamy, and dark tan in color. This brew simply looks like a solid stout. The aroma screams of java while the beer is still once agitated chocolate bursts through. Java diffinately dominates the flavor, but like the aroma, a chocolaty, malty backbone makes itself very present. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little more carbonation than most other stouts. However, I think that is a good thing, as it doesn't interfere with the beers flavor, and makes it easier to drink. Overall, this is a fine brew. It doesn't seem to complex, but it does a great job of being what it says it is, a java stout."
"All in all, a coffee lovers dream come true, this is a fantastic example of a coffee stout. Bell's has a reputation for a reason."
"Huge concentrated coffee aroma. Deep black with a head that remindmed of those snake firework things youd set on fire on the 4th that just raised up as they burned. This head just flew up once the pour was finished. Wow this actually tastes more like coffee than it does like stout. Huge coffee flavor that is so acidic it actually burns the throat. Ample chocolate and minor notes of roasted barley. Touch of cream sweetness in the finish. I could see how some might be put off by this. I however love the hell out of it."
"I believe that this beer will be much more impressive with a year of bottle age under its belt. I think that the flavors will mellow a bit and this beer will really come into its own."
"Serving suggestion: If this beer has been in your fridge for a while, leave a bottle out for 15 minutes before drinking. It really needs a higher serving temp to be appreciated. That being said, this is a disappointing beer for me, The worst stout I have had from Bells, which produces great stouts (pick up some KalamazooStout!). Pours nice enough, black and thick, deep brown head that is fleeting. Aroma is also great. Rich and complex, coffee grounds, dark chocolate. Great coffee beers smell like fresh espresso, this is a bit stale though. Alcohol is apparent in the aroma. The ale is quite flat. This is typical of a thick stout, but it would have benefitted from more C02. Malty sweet and less dry than I like, the hops are also on the light side. Generally stale tasting and lacking somewhere. Again, more stale grounds than fresh espresso. On the positive side, the smoky toasted malts are nice and a rich fudge flavor emerges as it warms. As much chocolate malts as the base malt would allow are used here. Bravo to that."
"Another great beer from Bells brewing. Great for a coffee and beer lover. I will be definitely picking some more of this up. Keep up the great work!!!!"
"Overall, I was not impressed with the coffee aroma & taste in this java stout. It reminded me of the results I get when I try to coldbrew coffee, which has never worked out well - it's strong on the bitterness and short on the roasty fullness. It's not a bad beer, but if you have access to the Bell's line of stouts, pick a different one."
"Yeah, buddy. This one ranks up there with the likes of Founder's Oatmeal Stout. This is a bad-ass brew. Poured out to a dark black color with a syrupy like delivery into the glass. A big, yummy foam head quickly developed and stood strong at about 3/4 of an inch. Aromas of cocoa and roasted malt mixed perfectly with coffee and sweet cream. Nice. Taste was superb; coffee, roasted malts and chocolate dominate and fill the palate with sweet, sweet flavors. Mouthfeel is very good; thick, with a chewy element, but not so much as to feel like it's sticky or too dense. Drinkability is good. I could hammer this down in no time flat and go for another one in a heart beat."
"A nice dessert treat; I'd happily drink another two or three of these if I didn't think it'd keep me awake all night. Enchanting indeed."
"This offering from Bell's is a superb combination of a distinct coffee note coupled with a rich dark stout. The initial pour was very smooth and did not churn or overhead in the glass. The head was chocolate brown and hung in there for the beer, though much thinner toward the end. The smell was a rich odor of dark coffee, roasted malts, and a slight alcohol nose. The taste was initially that of the roasted and dark malts but not overly sweet. The coffee flavor then came through and was very pleasant and not at all overpowering. The alcohol taste was noticeable on the back of the throat and a nice compliment to the deep, complex flavors of this brew. I really enjoyed this beer; I thought it was complex but well planned. Very enjoyable, not a session beer, but well worth enjoying any time!"
"Taste: the coffee stand out right away, followed by some bitter hops, and a little chocolate. The burned coffee doen't follow through quite as much as I feared it would in the taste, but it's still there. Mouthfeel is nice and thick and creamy, just how I like my stouts. Not my favorite stout, but still glad I gave it a try."
"Damn Sam. Had one of these last night at Mackenzie's with fellow BA's Stubob and Fantome. Deep dark color. Appears almost a dirty oil color in glass. Big brown head looking like oil sludge again. Big coffee and roasted malt nose. THis beer looks thick and follows through on that promise. Heavy lacing down the inside of the glass. Huge coffee taste followed by huge roasted malt taste. Stout is not one of my favorite styles. This is an extreme stout IMO however and deserves to be tried at least once. Has kind of a syrupy heavy mouthfeel. This beer is a little too much for me. Glad I tried it though. Not sure I will again."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out black with half an inch of tan foam. The aroma is mostly coffee, but also nuts, oak, and chocolate. Roasted, chocolatey flavor with lots of coffee. Some fruit in the finish. Tasty hop flavor. Oatmeal too. This beer has an inredible variety of flavors, and they really work well together. The mouthfeel is thick and very smooth. Well carbonated. Alcohol is noticable, but does not take over the flavor. Anyone who is a fan of coffee and stout is certain to love this beer."
"Edit: Just looked up this batch number on Bell's website and realized this was packaged on October 28, 2004. At almost a year old this brew is still amazing. I will have to try one fresh and then get some more to cellar!!"
"I love it when beer exceeds my expectations. Poured this into a tulip and glad I did, as it greatly enhances the appearance, a deep black with a pillowy soft brown head. Upon close inspection, lots of tiny cascading bubbles can be seen rising to the top of this, keeping the small lace head alive, as now the large initial head has faded. Nose has notes of toasted bread, milk chocolate, bakers chocolate and of course coffee. Warming after just a sip, the alcohol is clearly there but gives a nice balance to the rest of the flavors - and there's a lot to pick out. Aside from an odd astringent plastic flavor, which is mild and I think from the coffee, a sweet cream and solid hop bitterness balances the darkness of the chocolate and roastiness of the coffee, making this a pretty nicely flavorful brew. Nice!"
"well balanced carbonation helps the body of this brew. However, the full-body and sweetness of it make it a little tough to drink; definitely a brew that I'd drink one at a time per week maybe. Very tasty with just a touch of alcohol...i really enjoyed this one!!!"
"I could enjoy one of these from time to time, but not on a regular basis. Maybe I just need to start drinking black coffee to truly appreciate this stout."
"I am a coffee lover, but the aftertaste of this beer kind of reminds me of coffee that is made too strong and cooked on a burner for a couple hours. This is a good beer and would love to try on draught. The drinkability suffers a litte from the aftertaste but is still slightly above average."
"Wow. I love this beer."
"Hey, who put a pot of espresso in my beer glass? That is what it looks like, tastes like, and smells like. It has some high gravity sweetness and body, but the espresso flavors and ground bean texture overpowers it all. I don't know if the bittering is from intense flavor hopping or from grain astringency. It even has a bitter nose that is more reminescent of Itallian espresso than a stout yeast. Nicely earthy and nutty. Nicely alcoholic, something to cut through the body. Warming and intensely flavored into the finish. The aftertaste ligers like a fine cigar."
"Full velvet like mouthfeel."
"The easy drinkability and hidden alcohol makes this one quite drinkable. Mmm, I could see this one with a nice chocolate cake. However, if I had the opportunity to get several of these puppies, I wouldn't mind making a nice tira misu with it."
"My second Bell's after their Porter. Love coffee and coffee flavored things, so I had to give this one a try as it says right on the bottle that it's brewed with coffee. Pours jet black with a huge tan head that disappates to a coating that lasts til the final drop cloudy with what appear to be coffee grounds at the end. Looks great. Smell is straight up coffee. Surprised? Good roasted coffee too, not burnt coffee which is nice for a change. Taste follows suit, thank god. I bet this would even be good heated up. Nice and sweet, but not cloying, with enough bitter to balance it out. Mouthfeel is right on, immaculately smooth with good carbonation. Could drink this for days, even in the morning. Highly recommended for any other coffee heads out there."
"Body is dark as night, maybe a hint of light sneaking thourgh the bottom of the chalice. Head is dark tan, fairly large, with good retention. A whole lot of coffee in the nose, not much of a surprise, but very welcome. Like a cup of fresh brew, this will peobably keep me up to 3 in the morning. Taste is brash and bold, a huge amount of coffee in the flavor. Alcohol is also present, which just adds to the spirit of this brew. Original in the sheer amount and interaction of the huge flavors of this beer. Excellent and challenging."
"Seriously, the flavor of this brew is over-the-top. Way more flavorful than I was expecting. Very good, but maybe a little too unbalanced."
"Tastes like a cup of lightly sweetened, dark roast brew mixed with spicy hops. Ends with a bitter, you guessed it, coffee-like finish. As it warms, it's reminiscent of chocolate-covered espresso beans. Mouth is thick and syrupy yet spritzy and tingly on the tongue. It's a real mouthful, practically a meal in itself, albeit a caffeinated one. Amazing stuff... 'specially for the coffee freak."
"In the mouth it felt quite creamy, and a little fizzy. Overall, just fine. The coffee flavor dominated the taste, as well, but it was very enjoyable. Somewhat bitter, as well. Coffee. Lots. I'm not a coffee drinker, so this flavor isn't my favorite, but still, it's good. Relatively thick, and a rich experience, so I couldn't drink a lot of this at once."
"Full bodied, almost totally black and opaque with a thick creamy chestnut colored head that retains well and leaves some decent lace. The aroma is dark roasted malt, espresso coffee and charred wood. The dark roasted malts hit you right up front, with just a touch of caramel to balnce, then the coffee taste comes in with a creamy smooth, slightly fruity, almost cappacino impact with a touch of dark chocolate, finishes dry with a lingering charred wood taste with a little more of the caramel and dark chocolate background. I had to check the bottle to make sure it didn't say ""Starbuck's"". A beer for coffee lovers. Substantial mouthfeel, almost like an oatmeal stout, but still very drinkable. This would be great after dinner, take your time and let it warm up a little, it just gets better."
"Notes: Drinkable, but not for the non-coffee drinker. I've had this one when it was colder and the flavors weren't as noticeable. Drink this one after it's had a chance to warm up from the fridge if you would like the full coffee flavors."
"Pours out an espresso brown with a smallish tan head. Smell is decidedly coffee-like. Smell is, unsurprisingly, of roasted coffee beans but not much else. Taste is smooth, roasted coffee all over the place. Not a lot of definition otherwise, almost no hop feel but overall nice and creamy. If you like coffee, you'll really like this stuff. Otherwise, I'd stick to other stouts. Nice for a change of pace, though.."
"Drinkability: While thick and deliciously complex, this is not a flavor suited for session drinking. It is also not immediately accessible and it took a while for me to aquire a taste for it."
"Overall a fine example of what a coffee stout should be modeled after. Bold, solid and hugely flavorful. Left me with mucho coffee breath. Wonder how this would taste accompanied with some corned beef hash and eggs benedict? hmmm...."
"bottle dated 10.24.13 consumed 12.06.13 - 4/6 in a six-back Bells roots revisit - lots of fantastic coffee aroma and flavor, fridge-cold it was a little minty/citron, but then the coffee beans really rounded out and complimented the moderate, easy drinking roasty stout underneath, delicious, scores left intact"
"The mouthfeel is nice and thick. The flavor is mostly coffee and some fruity esthers from fermentation. In the background there are the typical stout flavors that keep this from being too off the wall. If you are a stout or a coffee fan this is one that is definately worth trying."
"Bottle Served in plastic cup (Hotel Room) Black Brew with a nice beige head. Burnt espresso aroma, faint fruitiness and some fusels. Is the cup dissolving? Nice medium body, black malt dominates the taste ,very dry with a nice roastiness.Finishes with coffee and bitter chocolate. Draft please!"
"My only criticism id the thin mouthfeel. If this beer had more chewiness to it I would have given it '5's across the board."
"Nice coffee stout. I wish I could drink this every morning. A big thanks go out to Feloniousmonk for this choice beer!"
"Overall, this isn't a beer I'd buy again. While I'm glad I tried it, I think in the future, I'll stick to drinking Kalamazoo, Expedition, and Third Coast Old Ale if I want a Bell's brew."
"Mouthfeel is very nice as well, undeniably smooth and just a great beer."
"This brew here is a jet black concoction, brown hues in the light. Dark brown head sits on the top, some lace. The scent is not surprisingly dominated by coffee aroma. The sweet malt roasted malt front is blown away by a rich coffee taste. Hops are there but are dominated as well. Smooth creamy body. Stouts arent my favorite, and i normally dont like coffee, but this beer is done quite right. Especially if you like coffee, this ones worth a shot."
"Final Thought: A little disappointed as high expectations were shattered; however, this beer is still good if you're just into dark roast coffee and chocolate in one -- with that, then this is your beer."
"If you don't like coffee, you might want to skip this. If you do like coffee, embrace it."
"Mouthfeel is thick, silky and smooth. Hard to make the call whether this is a coffee-flavored beer or a beer-flavored iced coffee. Far and away the best coffee beer I've ever tried. Blessings to trbeer for feeding both my addictions."
"Pours opaque black with a healthy tan/brown head. Good lacing and nice head retention. A nice strong aroma of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. The taste is full of chocolate and roasted coffee beans, with a hint of smoke. Strong roasted malts countered with black coffee bitterness make for one hell of a big beer. The finish is dry and roasted, much like a sip of black coffee. The huge coffee flavor may be intimidating for some, as a black coffee lover, I adore this stout."
"Cheers!"
"Dark brown to coffe-black. No light penetrates this black beauty. Thick, big dirty-brown head floats powerfully atop. Laces like a sonofabitch. Outstanding. Smells of freshly-ground, dark roast coffee beans. Coffee aromas mix well with the peaty, smoky, and slightly sweet roasted malt. Mama likes. Wow! They [Bell's brewer(s)] definitely put some coffee in here. Dark, roasty bitterness right up front. Like carbonated coffee. Mid-palate reveals the familiar Kalamazoo stout base. Earthy, peaty, roasty with a hint of sweetness and quite delicious. Finish is sweetish with a roasty coffee bitterness. Full-bodied and chewy, with more carbonation than it needs. Another great Bell's stout. Maybe I should drink this every morning..."
"Drinkability: Pretty heavy stuff so I couldn't see drinking a ton of this. This paired nicely with my wife's fresh baked brownies. This is good but there are better versions out there."
"Smells of over roasted bitter burt coffee (I don't mean that in a bad way). The easiest way to explain the taste is nicely roasted stout mixed with a shot of esspresso. A bit too much roasted bitterness perhaps. Leaves a strong aftertaste so drink this one when you are all done drinking everything else. This is one to keep in the fridge and pull one out every now and again. Not super drinkable, but tastes good every once in a while."
"This came from another gift bottle (Thanks Zac!). It poured a deep brown to black with little head or lace. The malty sweet aroma is accented by the coffee added to this beer. The coffee accents some chocolate malt added to the mixture. The coffee is more subtle in this beer than in others of this style Ive tried. It still dominates the taste, but doesnt mask some of the chocolate and other flavors that come from the malt. Any hops are completely disguised by the addition of the coffee. It has that same silky smooth Bells mouth feel, and has a decent drinakbility. This is a fairly stout stout, and the alcohol would prevent drinking too many of these."
"This pours out the expected pitch black with a quick forming tall dark brown head. The head stays for a while and leaves nice chunks of lace around the glass. As soon as you pop the cap you know this is going to be one coffee intense brew. Without much effort you can smell the huge amounts of coffee that went into this. Aroma is chock full of coffee goodness with a lighter back by chocolate malts and a bit of roastiness. This smells like liquid coffee beans almost. Flavor starts of with a strong bitter coffee followed by chocolate and roasted malts. After taste is a bitter lingering coffee one. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a good amount of carbonation. Quite drinkable to if you like the taste of coffee otherwise the huge coffee flavors would get too much after awhile but for me its great. Taste is a little simple but still good and this can definitely be a replacement for your morning cup of coffee. Many thanks to clvand0 for this one."
"Thanks to Pisskynights and Feloniousmonk for each sending me a bottle. Good stuff."
"Pours a solid & impenetrable black. 2 full inches of head comprised of giant bubbles. The head shows remarkable staying power. Sweat beef, chocolate & of course lots of coffee hit youre nose from several feet away. The coffee aroma has a somewhat odd character too it, one that I guess is typical of coffee stouts, but that maybe is a bit more sour than it should be. Hard to pin down. Flavor is full & roasty, but disappointingly un-unified. An enjoyable, if confusing, blend of the darkest malt & unfinished coffee. The coffee character has the flavor of beans that have been soaked in cool water for a week rather than brewed. A fascinating flavor, but one that sounds better in theory than in execution. Better than the one I had when I bought the 6 last year, but not nearly as good as I had hoped after its time left to it's self."
"Deep opaque brown with a brown head. In the light, the edges appear a nice amber. Good solid lacing. The aroma is initially chocolate, giving way to roasted malts and coffee. The flavor is bitter and malty, chocolate and roasted malts. This is a great stout, not relying too heavily on the coffee for character. It has some body and a slightly astringent aftertaste. I enjoy the balance here, it makes it more drinkable."
"poured dark brown with brown head arma duh coffee, flavor coffe, chocolate. I was a little hesitant about buying this becausse of the java because of past experiences I have had with things with coffee flavor in it but this was differant. the flavor of the coffee ws like the cuban blend that I like to drink strong bout not bitter a very good beer."
"Pours black with a thick creamy tan head. The aroma consists of dark roasted coffee (French roast and expresso combined), chocolate and a touch of fruit (raspberry syrup). The mouthfeel is full-bodied. The front features dark chocolate, expresso and roasted malt. Middle sweetens a bit, almost like chocolate frosting. The finish combines flavors of burnt malt and introduces a slight bite from the hop bitterness. A touch grainy too. Java stout is complex and robust both in flavor and texture. This is a filling stout and although delicious, one all by itself, hits the spot."
"I could sip on this one for a long while. Thanks to Brent for sharing."
"Drinkability - didn't particularly care for this, but if I see it on tap, would be inclined to give it a 2nd chance."
"This is a nice beer. Bells has done it once again. I have found a couple of Bells that I don't like, but this one is nice."
"Drinkablity/Overall: Unbalanced, yet smooth. All that is missing is the caffeine. Not too bad, but It's not something I'd stock up on."
"Comments  One good Bells deserves another. Last night Kalamazoo, this night Java Stout. What a treat. A treat that was made possible by feloniousmonk, so I have to give him props for this killer trade."
"I lowered the drinkability score a half-point because this is one beer that you don't want to drink much of. It's good, but a little goes a long way."
"If you don't like coffee, move along. Otherwise, this is a coffee/beer geeks wet dream! And a very intense marriage of the two. Not the best coffee beer that I've had -- it lacks balance and is a bit overdone -- but it's worth a try for adventurous / coffee lover."
"Thanks to CRJMellor for the bottles."
" This one is pretty rich and thick. It is full bodied with light carbonation, and it is a bit chewy. It is loaded with coffee flavors, and if you don't like a big roasty, burnt beer, this one may be a bit much. I would have liked a bit more balance with some sweet chocolate or some dark fruit, but I am not complaining. This is an intense beer, and I would have to say it seems to be at the level of 4 or 5 shots of espresso. It is unique and it still remains drinkable. I will search for this one again."
"The color of this beer teeters somewhere between dark mahogany brown and midnight black. The small creamy head of tan foam was short lived. Wonderful aroma of freshly ground and roasted coffee, cocoa butter and even a touch of tart caramel sweetness. The taste is rich with bittersweet roasted flavors. Espresso and cocoa blend into a smooth and dark stout. Medium bodied with a roasted bittersweet finish. This is a wonderful example of a beer and coffee blend. Very impressive."
"I thoroughly liked this beer. Aside from the smell, but a little musty tent smell is a small price to pay for this beer."
"Pours black as night, no light or colored hues come through. Huge billowing tan head slowly recedes and leave excellent lace. Deep roasted aroma, coffee and grain, with a hint of dark chocolate. Flavor is pretty much the same. Black coffee, roasted grain, dark chocolate, and a touch of sweetness. Alcohol stays well hidden. Finishes dry with a nuttiness. Full bodied, smooth and creamy. Highly drinkable considering the richness of flavor and higher alcohol content. Goes nice with breakfast or would be good after dinner. I am not coffee drinker, but this I love this stout."
"Pours tar black with a thick dark tan head with abundant lacing. One of the most impressive beers I have ever layed eyes on. The aroma is almost strictly coffee as you can smell it twenty feet across the room. Overpowering to say the least. There is a hint of oreo cookie in the aroma as well as the flavor but coffee grounds again dominate both. I personally think the flavor is better than the aroma but is still too much like stale coffee grounds. The extremely astrigent harsh coffee taste is unpleasant. I had high hopes for this beer as I like both stouts and coffee but this took it too far. It isn't too much that I can't finish the beer but it sure comes close to that threshold. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and creamy. This coffee stout does have some great characteristics but the coffee is taken too far. I can't drink caffeine as it gives me headaches and unfortunately this did give me one. Consequently, drinkability is way down for me. A definite beer to try for stout and coffee fans, and I am glad I did, but I am also glad I only bought a couple of bottles."
" A very solid stout, with a pronounced coffee character, as intended, with the use of fresh roast beans. Well done."
"Hmmmm. Maybe I'll have this again...if it is at about 6:00 a.m."
"Notes: A solid coffee stout with just enough coffee flavor not to get in the way yet add something special to the palate."
"The color was a dark-reddish brown with a beige head. No lacing really. It smells exactly like Starbucks coffee. It had a roasted coffee flavor; the aftertaste was bitter though (not unlike coffee). The mouthfeel was sticky and heavy. This beer was too bitter for my tastes, one was enough for me."
"had this beer on tap on a rainy april afternoon. so enjoyable and perfect for the time, place, date, and circumstance. A William Trevoresque beer for the English major in you. Beautiful dark chocolate color, nice balance of malt and a even mouthfeel made this a silky experience descending down this gullet. My first impression of taste would be ""fudgecicle"" in a glass. Chocalate essence and full body combined with a creamy head made this an exceptional stout. It may be on my list of stouts that can hold a candle to my absolute favorite-Sam Smith's doulbe choccolate stout. a perrenial winner but what I expect from Larry Bell and Kalamazoo brewing comapny. A wonderful libation to get a buzz off life too. Cheers!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a dark brown 1 1/2"" of thick, foamy head, and laced well. Thick, muddy, opaque brown that laughs at my desk lamp's 60 watts efforts to pass through. Deep, dark coffee malts dominate the nose, and I swear I smelled some smoke, but maybe not. Taste is all about the coffee, and works well. The alcohol of this big beer is well hidden by the coffee, and which makes it both dangerously drinkable and just plain dangerous. Not a big coffee fan normally, but if I'm going to have coffee, this is the form I want!"
"Mouthfeel is very smooth, and just the right viscosity. Stays on your tounge like an imperial, but without the big alchol/hop oomph. Very tasty. Very drinkable. I've always seen people say that a stout should be served with ice cream. That always sounded nasty to me. This guy would actually be a great compliment to something like that. Great stuff, and I'm going to have to find some next year."
"Pours a deep brown with a mocha colored thin head,great aroma of chocolate with some nuttiness and a hint of earth.Very rich flavored beer like chocolate devils food with the coffee really coming thru in the finish and aftertaste its like drinking coffee with a nice rich chocolate cake.A great beer will bring some south with me."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black color with two fingers of dark tan head. There is good lacing left on the glass. The smell is chock full of burnt malt and roasted coffee. Smells just like a quality cup of joe. The taste has lots of burnt malt up front and a black coffee bitterness. It has just a touch of sweetness, and the finish contains a small dose of hops. The mouthfeel is very thick, and super smooth. The drinkability is good as well. A coffee lover's dream!"
"Thanks Feloniousmonk!"
"i thought i'd seen black beers before. i was wrong. this baby is the deepest shade of black one might imagine...espresso black, topped with a creamy milk chocolate 1/4"" head that recedes to an ever-present topping. huge aromas of brazillian coffe and roasted oats. it really smells like a cup of coffee...i can't get over it. slight chocolatey undertones. carbonation is just a little bit on the high side...still quite full and chewy in the mouth. big roasted oats and waves and waves of mocha coffe flavors. light blanacing hops in the end with a touch of signature bells sourness. a very full bodied and big beer, but still somewhat drinkable. one hell of an impressive stout, this one will stand out in my mind for quite some time."
" Aroma and Taste is of roasted malt and coffee, lots of coffee. Nicely bittered, dry and smooth, medium to heavy body. A different and well crafted brew."
"Let me just say right off the bat that I love coffee and espresso and I love beer and have tried the hybrid before but I was especially looking forward to trying this one because I've enjoyed everything I've tried from the Kalamazoo Brewery. Poured jet black with a thick brown head at 55 degrees. Obvious notes of coffee and black patent malts in the aroma as well as some dark chocolate. Quite enjoyable, but the coffee portion of the brew tastes a bit like Folger's or Eight o'Clock rather than Gevalia or even Starbuck's. Overall, quite a solid hybrid brew."
"Drinkability: Very smooth beer, but I probably couldn't drink more than one in a night. I like coffee, but even for me the overwhelming coffee flavor in one bottle is enough for me. Can't knock it on drinkability however cause this is one deliciously drinkable beer."
"gds"
"Dark brown hue, dark tan head, sheets of lacing noted throughout. Some coffee, cocoa, roasted malts on the nose. Sweet, roasted malts, extremely thick, perhaps a full based body; definitive coffee beans, espresso notes, a touch carbonated; very creamy and rich texture. A mild bitterness, some chocolate should be noted towards the finish. Enjoyed a bit better when warmed to room temp; flavorful and unique, clearly a sipper to enjoy it's rich, creamy offerings. Bell's has yet to disappoint; once again they go outside the bottle with another fine dark brew!"
"Drinkability: Not my favorite coffee stout. Too much coffee bitterness takes away some enjoyment, but oddly enough grows on me over time. Give this one a try when you can."
"Intense aromas of burnt coffee emanate from my glass, there is a bit of off-putting astringency & acidity, as well as a hint of chocolate as well. A deep dense dark brown color, approaching a deep black color. Fairly low carbonation, but when roused the beer produces a thick brow dense head. A thick creamy body. This beer is far better when it is on the warm side, when it is cold it is far to astringent & out of balance. When allowed to warm the sharp acrid roast coffee notes mellow & meld with the rest of the beer. Has a strong roast component as well as a bit of chocolate in the taste. Finishes with a bit of sharp acidity. Perhaps it could use a bit of malt sweetness to balance the roast component. This beer just seems a bit out of balance."
"Overall, a great big stout - but lacking in the java department for me. I'd have this again, however, its ABV and flavor mesh perfectly for a winter beer."
"I can see how some might not like the Java Stout, but I found it quite tasty. I can't drink it too quickly, but I can still see consuming several in an evening. I wonder - is there actually any caffeine in this???"
"Pours jet black with a small creamy, tan head on top. Smell is mostly pure coffee! But there's a hint of some sort of creamy smell though. Smells great. Taste is of coffee mainly and roasted malts, but the coffee flavor dominates the roasty stout flavor more according to my palate anyway. This stout is fairly bitter, but I think a lot is due to the coffee. The finsish is kind of acidic/ harsh. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy and thick. Very nice. The overall drinkability is good, but not great. This beer seems to be inconsistent, or maybe my palate is, because I bought a case of this and i've had several on different occasions and sometimes it's an amazing coffee stout, and other times it is just too harsh and acidic. Overall, I'd definitely give it a try to see what you think."
"More than any other Bell's offering I'd label this one an acquired taste, many people I know have never been able to finish a bottle of it as the taste is so dominating. If you normally like espresso you'll probably like it, others are urged to buy a bottle before a 6 pack, as it's usually either a home run or a complete strike out in my experience."
"Its been quite sometime since I reviewed this beer, much to long Im afraid. The beer pours a piceous color with the head a chocolate brown crown on that ebony body, the head is creamy in texture and the lace a fine curtain to drape the glass. Deep roasted grain, coffee, sweet malt, fresh and clean to the senses, start is lightly sweet, thickly malted with the top full in its feel. Finish is masterfully hopped, moderately carbonate and the toasted grains leave a bit of bitterness on the palate, dry and a really nice stout, one I enjoy, and wish were more available."
"Deep dark beer with reddish highlights. Dark tan head completes the presentation. The aroma is pretty much all coffe. Maybe a bit of hops, but more likely just some extra roasted grains. But the smell was pleasing. The taste was strong on espresso flavors, with a slight bitterness on the finish. Almost overpowering in it's assetive coffeeness. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, lighter than a cup of cappuccino. Drinkability was OK, but this is not a favorite. A little more chocolate, a little more sweetness, and this would be good. As it is, its coffee for drunks, or those of us that may want an excuse to drink a beer with breakfast."
"This beer poured a dark color with a small tan head and left a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was mostly comprised of a coffee smell. Nothing much else in the aroma. The taste is totally dominated by the coffee - very strong blend of coffee at that. There is a hint of a roasted malt but it is well covered by the strong coffee. Not being a coffee fan, I found this beer to be OK. It is a well made beer if you're a coffee fan."
"Big thanks to Winomark for this one!"
"The name well fits this beer, as dose the label. As soon as its opened the aroma of coffee bean hits you on the nose. The appearance is good. Black as black coffee can get. No light through this beer. The pour, I admit was impressive. Its a thick, full bodied beer so the dark tan head bellows up slowly and cascades as it grows to a very nice frothy top. Lace is ringing, thick and sticky,very cool! The taste is at first, almost sour, but soon the mouth feels a smooth, mellow dark roasted balance of malt and a bitter hop. The mouth is left tart or with a bean bitter aftertaste. The mouth is dry but left with a slight oil feel. A dark, stout, busy beer. Alot going on and abit much for its not an easy drinker."
"Java Stout feels very smooth and full inside the mouth. I must admit however, that for a non-coffee drinker the taste is a bit overpowering. I'm glad I tried one, but it's too roasty and Java-infused for my tastes."
"A wonderful stout. Very rich, well built and the taste is all there. If you can't stand the taste of coffee howevery, you would want to steer clear of this one, but otherwise, you definately should try this one out. Like most any stout, I could only drink a couple of these at a time, there is just so much to them. If you haven't tried this out yet, put it on your list, and enjoy."
"This stout poured a nice brownish black with a tan head. All I could smell was coffee, which didn't bother me one bit, I think that I enjoyed the smell more than tasting the it! The tase was of very strong coffee, just as I had expected. I'm not sure if I could drink more than one of these at a time, but it was pretty decent. I would drink it again, if I was in the mood for coffee."
"I love stouts and porters that feature coffee flavors. I like coffee. I like most of Bell's products. But I did not like this beer. Poured an oily, inky black. Aroma was like cold used coffee grounds. Flavor was that of a pretty good dry stout with a 50/50 mix of extra-strong Columbian coffee. Unlike malt-derived coffee flavors, here the real coffee used in the brewing process imparted a thin, harsh cold coffee flavor. For me, this was like their Cherry Stout - a beer that was an interesting exercise and worth having tried, but not one I care to have again."
"Though not my favorite of the Bell's stouts, this coffee taste appeals so much to the geek in me...personally, I like a little water with my beans, and the jolt of caffiene that follows. I'm just surprised that I'm not feeling that jolt now! Still, a decent beer, and certainly will look forward to it in the future."
"I like coffee and stout so this is a match in heaven.. Super dark, near-black body and a mountainous, rocky, tan head. Silky, rich body. Perfect equilibrium between beer and coffee. No one taste seems to dominate the other. A nice roasted malt taste marries well with a light coffee flavor. A brief bitterness is left in the palate along with the java presence. The typical Bells aftertaste is somewhat masked with the java.."
"Java. Yup."
"Blacker than Black. Your aren't gonna see through this one! It also has a creamy, light bronw head. The aroma is like a freshly brewed pot of coffee with just a slight bit of roastiness. The flavor is like a pot of black coffee, with a burnt coffee flavor upfront, a bit of roastiness in the middle, and a burnt bitterness in the oily, creamy finish. This is definitely the coffee drinkers beer. I would love to have a pot of this at work in the morning. A full-bodied, drinkable stout. I love it."
"A tasty beer but not one I could have more than once in a night. Nevertheless, its easy to see the talent it takes to brew a stout with coffee this well."
"This beer is very dark black with a thick light brown head. The smell is not strong, but chocolate and coffee are evident. The taste of coffee, chocolate, and dark roasted malt is well balanced with the malt sweetness and warming alcohol. There is some slight bitterness but it isn't a hop bitterness, it must be from the coffee, chocolate and dark malt. For a beer this dark, and at 7.5% it is surprisingly drinkable. The only thing keeping this from becoming a favorite of mine is the price."
"Served on tap at the BW-3 in downtown Indianapolis. My glass of Bell's Java arrived at my barstool an extremely dark brown to black coor with a nice thick tan head topping it off. Aroma is very bold coffee and chocolate, these dominate anythign else. Tastes like a dark roasted coffee at first then blends into chocolate and becomes quite sweet through the middle to the finish where just a bit of hop bitterness is detectable. Body is very full and thick, and it's quite smooth. In my opinion this beer is a good beer to finish a meal with or even drink with (or as) dessert. Not a beer you could drink a lot of in one session, but definitely worth enjoying a pint or two."
"Roasty big time coffee grounds nose. Dark black opeque look in the glass with a nice sticky rich off white slightly tan head. The taste is dominated by coffee. If you are not a coffee fan don't even try it... if you are ... man enjoy the ride. It a coffee lovers dream. Inital flavors of bitter coffee and this then mellows into a slight hazelnut, smoke, and slight hops finish on the tongue. The mouth is smooth but seems just a slight bit flat on the tongue. It's drinkability suffers slightly for me just due to the total coffee experience. It is very good.. i just could not imagine more than two of these in a session."
"Appears dark brown basically black without being too technical, nice full thicket of tan foaming head speckled lacing. Aroma consists of fresh grounded coffee beans, chocolate, and nuts brought out by the dark roasts. Tastes like a strong cup o' Joe, with creamy chocolate additives brought on by the combonation of dark roasted malts used here, coffee flavor dominates here so good I could serve this up with breakfast and not feel bad about it. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied very cream textured. Drinkability, like I said I get drink it for breakfast."
"Putting coffee in a stout is a great concept. Especially when Bell's is doing it. This is no coffee flavored stout, this is one wake your ass up and get moving coffee first beer second in my mind. Strong coffee smell and taste, which is awesome. Nice steady carbonation holds the flavors together so well. Definitely roasted with some nutty chocolate mixed in. Finishes slightly acidic (just like coffee does). The only problem is that I couldn't have many of these because I'd get way too wired!"
"This beer is a wonderful offering from Kalamazoo Brewing. They put two of my favorite drinks together in one for me and I cant thank them enough. I cant wait for Bells to finally reach SoCal."
"ng"
"Drinkability: Hell Yeah! I felt like a drunken squirrel! A whole bottle might be a bit hazardous, but I will be fighting my girlfriend for this anyways and sharing is caring. Thank God for beertrading."
"A Big Java Cheers to FeloniousMonk for a F***ing Marvelous beer Sir!"
"The flavor is nicely bitter, but bitter coffee nonetheless. The taste is very much of a dark chocolate blended coffee. This is a very impressive taste. The feel is quite full, creamy, and smooth. One of the best stout mouthfeel dimensions I've experienced. The drinkability is limited by the heavily bitter flavor and the ABV."
"Poured pitch black and opaque. Smells strong of coffee and dark chocolate. Tasted much like a cold, strong, bitter coffee. The bitter notes came from the taste of bitter dark chocolate and the coffee taste is obvious. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than perfect but still nice and heavy. The drinkability is nice and easy, multiple brews can be had. And for an extra treat, enjoy with frozen snack size Snickers."
"Excellent! This stout from bell's pours a lovely opaque black colour with an espresso head. The aromas are all coffee, heavy, roasted malts, chocolate and booze! The taste is a yummy blend of dark coffee flavors and roasted malt flavors. The mouthfeel is just right and the drinkability is excellent, especially for a stout that is 7.5% abv...WOW you could have fooled me!"
"It pours a deliciously dark glass with a toasty tan head. The aroma is basically a strong coffee aroma with some chocolate. The flavor follows suit with the Coffee flavor prevailing over all. Chocolately as well. It has a mild bitterness from either the hops or coffee. Creamy mouthfeel, good carbonation. It has a rich finish. I liked it a lot."
"Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is wet coffee beans. A full bodied stout. Strong coffee flavor dominates over everything else in this beer. There are some roasted malt flavors, choclately and sweet, but they are so blown away by the coffee. Its like drinking a stout that has had some coffee added. I realize that that's the effect they were going for, but it doesn't really work well for me. There is a touch of bitterness, but I can't tell if it's the coffee or the hops. Despite its unbalances it's very smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Vintage 2001. Poured a pure black, witha fair size head and some lacing. Aroma is pure coffee, like an espresso. Taste however, while it has that coffee and roasted barley flavor, it is watery, and lacking body. It was still a good beer, maybe some additional aging will help."
"Wow. Full body, full flavor. An awesome beer. I would like to thank feloniousmonk again (but you're wrong about the ""nippy"" bottles... I want all 12oz of this big boy)."
"This beer poured a brown head with small-medium bubbles. The hue of this beer was black and there was no lacing. The nose was coffee and it had a strong coffee flavor. The mouthfeel of this beer was smooth. Unfortunately, I didn't like this particular stout because I just can't acquire a taste for coffee tasting beers even though this particular stout didn't have as strong of a coffee taste as I have recently tried. But, at least I tried it!!"
"Flavor: It has a very big roasted coffee taste. a very dry mouthfeel"
"This brew poured a very dark black body with a dark brown head full of small to large bubbles. It had a very strong smell of coffee in this one as I eagerly anticipate my first taste. The head is still hanging in there and the lacing becomes apparent on the side of the glass as I raise my glass for my first taste. Its very strong coffee tasted as I expected it to when a hint of ""Oh my God what have I got here"" hit my tongue. Its after bite is just within my range of acceptance. It is pretty smooth for a ""Coffee beer"". Time to sit back and enjoy this great brew as I watch the military bomb Iraq!"
"Aroma contains a nice mix of chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. Quite pleasing. Black with red borders when held in the light. Firm tan head with some lacing present. Taste matches aroma very well. Sweet tones with some fruitiness. Finishes dry and medium long. Maybe a little thin, but nicely carbonated, i.e., not excessive. Best java stout I've had. Better complexity than most. Nice chocolate undertones and not too rich. Just a little thin."
"After being blown away by the Expedition Stout, I was hopeful of another good stout. Looks impressive with its deep brown body and fluffy tan head. Aroma of strong coffee reminded me of coffee ice cream. Crisp and slightly effervescent with medium fullness. Flavor tastes like that time when I accidently drank coffee grounds that were floating in my cup. This is rather unpleasant in my opinion. Like stale wet coffee grounds. I may not even finish this one."
"To me, the aroma didn't appear to be right, lots of ashy roasted coffee beans, and oddly some rotting vegetables? I liked the first part of the aroma i mentioned, but not the second aspect. I dunno if ot was a bad bottle, but the palate didn't suggest it was. Palate is quite smooth, roasty and ashy, decent, with quite pronounced bitterness, interesting and innovative, but I don't think this quite worked. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for this!"
"Overall, i think this would be one i would have around just for the few occasions i think one would would hit the spot."
"Thank you feloniousmonk for this awesome bottle!"
"Color is a super thick black with a large inch tall tan head that crumbled down super slowly leaving a puffy diveted landscape for a top that stays present til about half glass, which then stays as a hazy skim and smaller bubbles. A hefty head for sure. Leaves lace in thickly sticking sheets. Ahhh the smell is just lovely, its all dried espresso coffee, very roasted and very dried and uniquely so, reminds me of true espesso thats served in Eastern world cafes. Dry and roasted, somewhat bittering too in the smell. Taste is crazy espresso, deeply roasted dryish malt tones with all sorts of dry roasted bitterness thats very easy to handle.Finish is nice and levels off nicely leaving lingering espresso dryness, slight hop bitterness and light deep dark chocolatey tones across the palate. Its partially full, quite rich, barring heavyness, and silky smooth and packed with nice espresso flavors that are a bit overpowering at first if your not ready for it, but once it settles in, its fantastic. Makes for a great dessert beer and conversational piece to share with friends. If you like coffee in any form, this is a must try, and if you like highly flavored stouts this is a big must try."
"wow.....black as night with ruby hues. thick, huge, rocky two inch dark tan head. bottle conditioned with lots of black sediment. strong espresso and black malt nose...some dark chocolate and vanilla whiffs. just awesome. the flavor profile is astounding....rich espresso, bitter black malt, chocolate and caramel hints all in the beginning....yeasty middle.....bits of belgian malt, a touch of tart sweetness and a long coffee liquer finish. some well disguised hop juiciness is present as well. full bodied. richly smooth and almost silky sweet for a profoundly bitter beer. all the desirable characteristics for a bitter but smooth coffee stout meld together in an unbelievable drinkability. a great brew and one of the best stouts i've ever had. it's a coffee lover's decadent delight. a scoop of ice cream would be perfect for this stout. absolutely amazing."
"I love coffee, and I love beer. I love beer that tastes like coffee. But this tasted like a beer with coffee grounds dumped in it. I could only take a couple of sips. I actually thought I would love this combination, but, as much as I love strong coffee, if I brewed this I would have dumped it. Tasted just like when you screw up and get grounds in your coffee (and make it far too strong)."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for sending this bottle!"
"Yet another winning stout from Bell's. Dark as night in the glass with next to no head. Aroma is that of very deeply roasted malt and begs you to take another sniff. The roasted malt shines through in the taste and actually nudges the hops to the background, which is something different in a Bell's stout. Delicious."
"Overall a very nice coffee stout. A stout to get your day started and make you ask where the eggs and bacon are. I only wish it was a little bolder in its aroma. Buzz Beer has nothing on this stout. Thank you feloniousmonk for send this most wonderful stout to Maine."
"Pours a deep dark brown, with a tan head. Smells like coffee, and tastes like coffee too. If I could start my day with this stuff I would be a happy camper. Strong coffee flavors with roasted maltiness backing things up. Not the typical bell's malt though. I was kind of skeptical about this beer, but I really think it works. I'd recommend this to coffee and stout lovers alike."
"Very deep brown, w/ a murky crimson hue around the edge of the glass. Beige, dense one fingered head leaves spotty lace. Freshly ground dark roast coffee dominates the aroma, but is supported by notes of brown sugar and dark caramel w/ hints of nutty and mildly buttery malt. Not unlike a rich coffee ice cream shake-- Unique and enticing aromawise. Coffee, while quite assertive in flavor, melds well with chocolate malt and pronounced dark caramel sweetness. When combined with the judicious hop bitterness and mild butterscotch diacetyl, an impression of sweetened mocha and cream bathes the palate. Full bodied, with an agreeably creamy mouthfeel. Subdued hint of black currant like fruitiness emerges late. Finishes with a lingering, balanced mix of residual sweetness and roasted barley bitterness. Java stout is a delightful, flavorful, and unique brew that exhibits well integrated coffee character. I should have saved this one for breakfast. A hearty thanks to Feloniousmonk for the bottle!"
"Massive cocoa puff head that leaves stratums of lace like some sort of high school geology project. Colossal nose of coffee, chocolate and dark, ripe fruits; should have saved this one for breakfast. A creamy smooth malt spine is the vehicle for this tasty roast elixir to make its way across your buds posthaste. I wish more of Bell's stouts were as carbonated. Well done, and probably my favorite of the Kzoo stouts."
"Another unique brew from Kzoo. The late 2004 batch has been particularly better than last years. Highly recommended. I could probably put back 3-4 of these no prob."
"....1-1-05, and I've found that this is utterly sublime when consumed at room temp....don't get it anywhere near a refridgerator. Amazing, really...if you like coffee, and you love stout, damn, but this is surely your idol, bow down before it and beg to be worthy...that bit about the nip bottles? That wasn't me talkin', that was only my concern for those who can't hack this much coffee...and who cares about them? Not me...can't run with this? Stay away, if you must...it's the ultimate sweetness for me, though..."
"Another pitch black baby, but this time one with a nice head. The other November stouts have been a bit sluggish in this department. What starts out as lacing on the glass ends up being sheeting and was a little more difficult than usual to clean. Even left my lips a little sticky. The aroma and flavor are very roasty and fairly dry. The coffee in the beer does more to reinforce and complement the roasty malt than to actually pop in the flavor. A black chocolate is submissive to the bitter roast. The mouthfeel is a bit gritty. The sourness present in a lot of the other November stouts is only a ghost lurking behind the other flavors. This is probably the best of the group's offerings but it would have benefitted from a creamier mouthfeel with or without the grittiness."
"Dark black color, creamy tan head, leaves a lace in my glass, strong coffee aroma and flavor very,very bitter, kind of like chewing on coffee beans, after it warms gets much more flavoful, the most bitter coffee stout I have ever had, and I like it."
"To say this stout is infused with coffee would be an understatement. It pours opaque with a charged up brown head. Leaves some lace down the glass. Nose is dominated by roast coffee, espresso, etc. The taste is rather roasty, as well, with a little malt character seeking through, but the majority of the taste is coffee-based. Pretty good stuff if you are a java head. Mouthfeel is solid, a little carbonated but smooth. Alcohol-wise, it packs a punch. Due to the massive implementation of coffee in this stout, I don't know how much of it I could drink, but overall, it's a solid, unique brew."
"You have to like coffee to like this Stout. I don't drink coffee but I do like a hint of it in many of the Stouts I drink and enjoy. There is much more than a hint here though. Dark brown with a thin light brown head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is pure coffee. Flavor is somewhat bitter but not to the point where it becomes hard to drink. Finish is all roasted coffee with a little malt. I couldn't take this in large doses."
"This is my second Bell's November stout I've tried and can't wait to get to the third. Gotta love a brewer with the guts to pull this off!"
"This beer poured as black as the night and formed a hug foamy cascading style head that speaks of a lot of carbonation present. Circular lace just hangs on the glass with this one as it subsides. An aroma of malt and burnt coffee. A flavor of malt and burnt coffee. A rather light body for a stout. The finish had a touch of bitterness to it. My fourth of the November Stouts line."
"Nose is dark-roasted coffee and malt, with an appetizing bitter note. Rich and oily on the palate, but with a firm acidic backbone which keeps the richness in check. Good bitterness, but its more coffee bitterness than hop bitterness. Very nice."
"Deep... opaque... black... with an impressive light brown head that leaves a lot of lace on the glass. Aroma is very much roasted coffee with a touch of sweetness. Flavor is bitter... not like hops bitterness... like eating spent coffee grinds bitterness... in a very good way. It's also balanced by just a touch of sweetness. Very thick almost oily mouthfeel, with a very smooth finish. This is a wonderful stout... as a matter of fact, I have to end this review, just because it's taking time away from enjoying this beer. Cheers!"
"Nicely done.  A ""kill two birds with one stone"" beer."
"My coffee tasting brain is confused. It smells equally of American roast, tart, strong coffee (Colombian?) and Euro-roast, black, oily beans. There is caramelized fruit there too, and a certain Reggiano cheesiness. Hints of Citrus leaves, roasted tomatoes, chocolate, cumin and black tea appear as well. But without question, this is at least half coffee. I give Larry and crew high marks for making such an interesting beer. It is completely undrinkable."
"Head as stiff as puff pastry, nice and big...sweet and deep aroma.  opaque black color.  Bitter oily expresso taste upfront, almost like coffee beans themselves.  Malts soften taste somewhat.  Just a mild fade in flavor, coffee in the aftertaste as well.  Sweet smells and bitter taste work well on a deep drink.  Nice idea and an interesting take on a bitter Stout.  For coffee lovers, this goes beyond a typical Dry Stout."
"You need to be careful pouring this one.  It's pretty charged up.  You get a big rocky brown head.  Very evident coffee aroma on the nose.  Opaque color.  Burnt malts on the nose also.  The coffee taste is not subtle in this beer.  It meshes so nicely in this brew.  I am not a coffee drinker, but absolutely love this beer.  There's a bit of carbonation in this one.  Besides coffee, I get toffee and roasted undertones.  A great bitterness present from coffee and Roasted malts rather than hops.  I've had coffee stouts from New Glarus, Lakefront and Redhook (Double Black Stout).  While those are all very good, this one is in a class by itself."
"obviously a new favorite.fantastic nose w coffee but not overpowering .it draws you in and then delivers on the promise. well rounded for a brew with  something added(coffee,fruit,etc...) fantastic from first sip to last."
"-Thick creamy head..musty coffee aroma..burnt musty coffee bean flavor..definitely a different taste to this one...nice specialty stout...creamy, tasty, different"
