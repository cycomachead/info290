3.93,-6.7,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"Black beneath a small, bubbly covering leaving some spotty bits of lace on the glass.  Smooth dark cocoa, vanilla, plums, and caramel.  A little more vanilla forward in the flavor, smooth chocolate, soft fruitiness, and dark roasty char. Creamy smooth medium body.  A pleasant, but dry stout.","wedge","Sunday at 09:07 AM"
3.76,-10.7,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Very dark beer with a modest slightly tan colored head. Aroma is surprisingly smokey/meaty with cocoa and, yes some vanilla. Roasty with slight bitterness. Taste is clean with meat seasonsings...hickory maybe, smoke, pine bitterness, and a little bit of vanilla comes through. Pretty decent. Definitely has smokey overtones.","tastybeer","Saturday at 08:13 AM"

Smell: vanilla, high cocoa (but not too high!) chocolate, plum, caramel. Holy balls this smells amazing. Hyped out the b imperial stouts can't touch this. Taste: vanilla, white chocolate, high cocoa chocolat,e black plum (very ripe), mild roast. Wow. Peche Mortel isn't the only world beating stout coming out of Du Ciel. Aphrodite / whatever is intense and incredibly well done.","babaracas","Mar 28, 2015"

Bourbon mid palate, a little nutty, charred and woody towards the back.  Light roasted malts and the char carries through the finish with some bitterness.

4.2,-0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"11.5 oz bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, vanilla, cream, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and vanilla/cocoa spicing; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, vanilla, dark bread, cream, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, vanilla, cream, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and cocoa/vanilla spice flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome spiced stout style. All around great robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and cocoa/vanilla spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 08, 2014"

Gorgeous mix of coffee and chocolate.  As the beer warms the bitter coffee subsides a bit and gives way to more of a smooth chocolate.  The ""tang"" of carbonation seems a little high.  It distracts from the sensory experience and hurts the overall rating.  This tastes similar to Samuel Smith's Chocolate Stout (which is a favorite for me).","fscottkey","Sep 05, 2014"

The first smell was a bit disappointing, though you can pick up bits of vanilla, coffee, and bitter earthy tones. The first sip more than made up for the smell with a burst of chocolate notes followed by red fruits, vanilla, a touch of booze, and a clean bitter finish. The mouthfeel was incredible on this beer. It felt expansive and complex without being too thick. Overall I was really impressed. This and Péché Mortel are among my favorite stouts now.","deakin","Aug 01, 2014"

Smell has vanilla bean, cocoa, roasty malts, some licorice, a bit of a lemon cleaner note as well. Taste is bittersweet, with lots of chocolate, mixed with vanilla and lemon, licorice, fairly nice actually, the vanilla didn't steal the show, it was a bit sweet but still refreshing. Body was moderate, smooth carbonation with a dry noticeably vanilla finish. I was worried this would be too muc a dessert beer, and tho it certainly leans that way it also has the balance and complexity to be a nice solid stout, worth trying if you see it. Very interesting mix of complex flavours, another winner from this outstanding brewery, well constructed with a nice bittersweet combo.","mick303","Mar 19, 2014"

Slight medium brown head that almost immediately faded. Poor legs and lacing. Aroma is first the vanilla and deep malt, then a twinge of coffee, then some sweet oaky bourbon and some dark chocolate. Taste is the chocolate and coffee up front, vanilla in the mid-palate, and vanilla/wood in the aftertaste. Nice low carbonation, and silky mouthfeel. I'd love to do a side by side with Peche Mortel.","mverity","Nov 25, 2013"

This appeals to me by not packing the stout with loads of sweet textures and instead enhancing the aspects of chocolate that I enjoy best - roasted, bitter, full-bodied, and most importantly, very tannic and juicy overall. This is instead rather dry and really gets all of the dark barley flavors with no juiciness to speak of, but the vanilla is a nice addition that makes this heartier without being overwhelming. This is easy to drink, and very rich, so it's a conundrum to figure out how fast to finish. Awesome stuff.","magictacosinus","May 04, 2013"

3.03,-28,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Founders tulip. Beer pours a jet black shade with an extremely thin layer of what can best be simply described as a layer of carbonation. Whatever it is, it definitely does not constitute a ""head"" or a ""crown"". The layer is very bubbly, effervescent, and fleeting. This beer has absolutely no legs whatsoever. It doesn't cling to the glass even a little. The nose is very disappointing. There almost isn't one. The bottle's label mentions cocoa and vanilla beans. I don't detect either. Just some faded coffee. The taste is marginally better than the nose, in that I can actually get a grasp of the coffee element. It's not bold by any means, but it's there. Not a lot else going on. The mouthfeel simply isn't what I'd expect from this. It's thin, and despite the visual lack of carbonation on the pour, manages to give off a very tingly feel. On second thought, it's just astringent. This doesn't coat the mouth, and just leaves bitterness behind. I've got a feeling this is an older bottle. I wonder what it'd have been like fresh. I truly believe coffee beers are best enjoyed fresh, despite everyone's insatiable desire to cellar everything called a stout.","Retail1LO","Dec 24, 2011"

You still get a little of all of that but it very much skirts around the edges of what is mostly a roasted malt center. This beer dreams and teases of being smooth and sweet but instead it's a little coarse and the mouthfeel is somewhat thin and prickly.

Taste is weak vanilla on the forefront and some cola and cocoa nibs, kind of thin in a way that really detracts from my enjoyment. Medium carbonation which has a cola-like synthetic feel, and the thin mouthfeel is really lacking. Overall, this was a disappointment from an otherwise great brewery.

Very sweet and inviting to say the least. The taste amplifies the nose by far. A bitter chocolate hits and settles to a sweeter, milkier taste. There is a good amount of vanilla blended in that isnt cloying or overpowering. Also, a bit of coffee stands out.

You can smell the roast on the coffee beans in this beer. A touch of vanilla adds a velvetiness to the aroma that is always welcome. The taste of this beer is black coffee at it's finest. There is a touch of the vanilla bean, but mostly the dark roast (almost to the point of charring) of the coffee is the star of this show. It does imbue a decent bitterness to this beer that surely doesn't come from hops. Though in spite of the strong bitterness the head retention helps with the mouthfeel's extreme creaminess. It's an interesting contradiction in both flavor and mouthfeel, but I must say that I truly enjoy it. This was a pretty fantastic beer, one of the better coffee stouts on the market. Surely this would be most favorable for those individuals who like their coffee strong, though.","Vdubb86","Mar 12, 2011"

No scent of the chocolate or vanilla that are mentioned on the label. These ingredients do, however, step out in the taste.

First off the drink is much too thin for what I thought would be big-bodied. Coffee characteristics in the flavor with some smokiness and big roasted malt!

There's a bit of coffee in the background, too. The full, round flavor, which leans a little on the sweet with a bit of bitter cocoa, isn't far off from a mocha latte. Seriously, this is close to the perfect damn beer. Imagine your favorite coffee, chocolate or vanilla drink, and you'll have notes of it in the Aphrodite.

This is one aromatic brew. How did they pack so much chocolate and vanilla into the aroma? Dark malt also adds nice compliments. Thankfully the flavor is not overly sweet. The chocolate is bittersweet and the vanilla is more underpowered than in the aroma. Dark malt gives a solid foundation for the chocolate and vanilla to play with your taste buds. This is one finely crafted beer and this was achieved with a relatively low ABV. Many brewers cannot provide this much flavor with twice the ABV. I would of liked a little more body for a dessert beer, but it is fine for a single stout and has nice carbonation. This is by far my favorite beer from Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel.","morimech","Aug 02, 2010"
4.22,0.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Rockin' out to the Moody Blues' ""Forever Autumn"" with this one. Boom! It pours a straight death black topped by a half-finger of light tan foam. As the Moodies bleed into Alice in Chains's ""Bleed the Freak"" (damn, I'm slow), the nose shows itself to be utterly dizzominated by chocolate, both dark and milk, with some roasted malts hanging in the background, biding their time. It's very simple, but very effective nonetheless. The taste goes for a less sweet path, opting instead for a bitter dark chocolate leader. The roast makes itself more known, bringing a hint of leather with it. Again, the formula is simple, but does plenty with the small list of ingredients. The body is a rather light heavy, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, almost chewy feel. Overall, a very nice stout, proving the capability of this Canucklehead brewery.","TMoney2591","Jul 29, 2010"

Aroma is a sweet blend of melting chocolate, malt, caramel, vanilla, and pipe tobacco. Flavor is like that and lots bigger: all qualities are more prominant along with a definite smokieness. Body is very soft and carbonation just where it should be in this case. Finish is like flavor and very slowly tapers in a long finish. Ultimate after dinner beer.","drpimento","Jul 29, 2010"

This finishes with a strong dry and roasty feel, as well as just a smidge of leftover spice from the hops.

The taste is good, much like the smell but a little more vanilla. THe one main difference is that you can actually taste the hops a little which leaves a slightly bitter afteratste. The flavor is dominated by a both sweet and bitter-sweet chocolate and vanilla, it eventually leads to a coffee flavor. The mouthfeel and drinkability are very good.

When I sipped the beer, I immediately tasted creamy chocolate. Bitter mocha flavors moved in and lasted until I swallowed. Overall it was a little sweet and very tasty. It has a medium body a good amount of carbonation. There was some coating that tasted of both bitter and sweet chocolate. I found it to be rather drinkable.

Though the head looks nice has good retention it leaves little to no lacing. The smell has a good roasted malt aroma with coffee and chocolate present. Pretty strong smell, I knew from the smell alone I would like this beer. The taste is roasted malts up front and a nice lingering sweet chocolate. The coffee taste doesn't come for me until later and is strong in the aftertaste. There is a little vanilla but to me it's barely in the smell or taste but it is hidden there. The mouthfeel is great for the style, a little thick but creamy as well. The ABV on this one is good, it's not staggering and that's good with all these high ABV stouts these days. That being said I could drink this one all day. I'll pick it up again but not much of it as it's a bit pricey for a 12oz bottle but I'll pick a couple more up just to have when I want a good stout.","dismal","Apr 22, 2010"

Pours a dark brown, nearly black color, small mocha head with light splatterings of lacing. Aroma has lighter vanilla than I was expecting, but its still there, maybe not in pure vanilla sense, but rather the manufactured (extract) kind. Not bad though. Also has some chocolate cake batter like qualities in the nose back up by a hint of coffee and roast. Very interesting. Taste leaves a little to be desired. A little too much fake vanilla flavor. It's not terrible but could be scaled back some. Bitter chocolate is also there backed up by a surprisingly decent hoppy bitterness that's earthy and somewhat spicy. I'm not really getting too much sweetness, and it's bone dry on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-full, low carbonation. This is not a bad beer by any means, but it's not spectacular like I was hoping it would be. I don't know if it's just me but the vanilla just seemed to be a little much, and it wasn't even great tasting vanilla flavor.

4.9,16.4,5,5,5,4,5,"Second or third time having this one, just deleted my old review to redo this one 8 months later. Pours out pitch black with a very nice dark tan head. The head is pretty large and has great retention. The bubbles on top are very frothy and look very cool. Tons of lacing is left all around my snifter as the head dies down. It leaves behind a large cloud and ring around the sides of the beer. Smell is nice. I notice a lot more vanilla and cocoa this time around, and to my liking. The roasted malts are right behind these two aspects and make for a great nose. I would like a bit more roasted malt. The vanilla aspect of the aroma is outstanding. Taste is probably the best of any non-Imperial Stout I have had, and better than many Imperial Stouts. The malt, cocoa and vanilla combine amazingly to make for a dessert-like taste. There are some earthy hops and they help round out a flavor that is very close to perfection. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low-medium carbonation. There is no warming. The only problem here is the lack of creaminess, the body feels watery more than creamy. A coat of roasty cocoa and malt sticks around on the tongue. If some creaminess was added to this beer, it would probably be flawless IMO. Drinkability is a laugh, I should go to Montreal and bring back a few cases of this stuff! It would be cheaper than buying over priced singles in the US. I love dark beer and this one could be sessioned like there was no tomorrow. This is a near perfect example of a straight up Stout.

Aroma is full of sweet smelling chocolate and burnt grain character with a bit of the vanilla coming through in the backend. Taste is quite full of bittersweet chocolate upfront with a solid burnt grain taste filling out the rest of the body. Finish has a lasting taste of bitter chocolate blended with vanilla. The dark grain flavors are really accented nicely with the addition of the cocoa and vanilla without those additions overpowering the base characteristics of the stout.

Smells pretty mouch like a mexican mole, or cocoa nibs which I guess is good given the ingrediants. Chocolate really overwhelms all other aromas however. Cocoa is the overwhelming flavor on the palate, not to be confused with chocolate. The cocoa is earthy, rich, and slightly bitter. I do find it hard to taste the vanilla in all of this.

It needs to be a little bigger and a little more badass to truly display its best qualities. The nose would also benefit from more strength. Having said all that, it is good beer.

Some roasted malt and light hops. I'm eating strawberry ice cream while drinking it and it tastes like neopolitan ice cream.

3.99,-5.2,3.5,4.5,4,3,4,"Pours a very dark opaque brown/black with a bit of brown head that rapidly fades. Kind of fizzed on the pour, makes me worry that it's over-carbonated for my tastes, but I'll keep an open mind. The aroma on this one is pretty impressive--a complex blend of roasted malts, dark chocolate, and hints of vanilla. Taste follows the nose, but focuses on the roasted malts rather than the chocolate and vanilla. Vanilla is basically just a shadow, and the chocolate is overpowered by the stoutiness of this stout. Not sure that's a bad thing, but I was hoping for a bit more after the description. Oh wait, there's a big whiff of vanilla... damn, now it's gone. In any case, it's a robust beer like Peche Mortel, just not on the same level. Finishes with a bit of a piney hop bitterness, paired with some chocolate bitterness. My fears are somewhat confirmed on the mouthfeel--a bit thin for a stout, and over-carbonated for my taste. It does drink nicely, however, not a bad beer overall. The first offering I had from Dieu Du Ciel was Peche Mortel, so I guess I was expecting a similar caliber brew. Not there, but definitely a good stout.","LordAdmNelson","Beers"

The taste is very nicely balanced between the cocoa powder, the vanilla bean, and some roasted and charred dark malts. There is a chocolate bittering taste in the finish and this interacts quite well with some leafy hop in there too. The bittering chocolate, charred dark malts, cocoa powder, and subtle but very nice creamy vanilla bean, define this beer. It is very good, a bit different, but well worth seeking out.

The vanilla sweetness does get to be a bit much after a while, and the mild cocoa bitterness and roasted malt character doesn't really counter it too well. The base stout characteristics are washed out. The beer finishes pretty well, long with a blend of vanilla sweetness and burnt malt and cocoa bitterness.

This beer is very well balanced and complex with the sweet notes from the chocolate and vanilla bean perfectly balancing out the roasted coffee/espresso bean and burnt toast flavors. Slight alcohol warmth but otherwise the ABV is very well masked. None of these flavors overpower the other, instead they all bounce off of each other and I'm picking up something different on each sip. This is one of the most well-balanced beers I've ever had. I want to slowly drink it and contemplate each sip but I find myself drinking it pretty quickly. Highly recommended!","corby112","Sep 27, 2009"

Beer is jet black with no head, but a small group of bubbles has me confident this baby is carbonated. Smell is utter heaven, wow, probably the best smelling beer I've ever had. Not overly complex but I don't care; vanilla and chocolate combo is great and reminds me of some of the best cappucino's I've ever had . . . but I'm hoping to enjoy this one more. Beer is very well balanced with as some bitterness drives through the entire beer and holds it at bay, was worried it would be too sweet after the smell but that is not the case.

4.1,-2.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"11.5oz. bottle served in my DT tulip. '0' '06' notched on the label. Poured inky black with a half-inch, dense khaki-colored cap that eventually settled into a fairly consistent skim with only a few breaks. Thick slashes of lacing were exposed after each tilt of the glass. Cocoa revealed upfront, as well as a hint of dark fruit and the merest suggestion of hops at the back. Big cocoa character dominates the flavor profile, with a kiss of vaniila in the mix and a little bit of bittering hops at the finish. Mouthfeel was medium/light and a bit fizzy; would have preferred a little less carbonation on this one. Really drinkable, despite the carbonation level. Proof that a beer can be flavorful with a low abv; however, $5.99 a bottle is a bit steep in my opinion.","Jwale73","Sep 03, 2009"
3.9,-7.4,5,5,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer was somewhat of a disappointment. While both the appearance and the aroma were nearly flawless, the flavor and mouthfeel reminded me more of a mediocre Irish dry stout than a well crafted American-style stout.","Damian","Aug 30, 2009"

Taste is the same, very well balanced between the flavors and finishes with a roastyness that is desirable. The mouthfeel to me is a bit of a let down. Kind of watery with an bit to much attack from the carbonation. This is definitely one of the better stouts I've had as of late. Dieu Du Ciel continues to impress.","atremains","Aug 29, 2009"

I think this will age very well also. All the flavors are blended pretty well and I think aging it will just round it off even more. I'll have to cellar a few of them.","jlindros","Aug 22, 2009"

Smell is very nice, quite sweet with obvious chocolate coming on strong. Vanilla hints get stronger as the beer warms. Taste sees much of the vanilla fall away in favour of the aforementioned dark chocolate. Lightly hopped as well. Mouthfeel is full and nicely carbonated, very nice, and drinkability is good. All in all, not as sweet as I'd have thought before breaking in to it, but probably better balanced. Very good stout.","Mandrake","Aug 12, 2009"

Nose is a blast of vanilla and dark chocolate, with roast malts and cocoa nibs. The flavour is great. Lots of dark chocolate with an upfront vanilla profile that really works well with the chocolate aspect. A bit of coffee with roasted malts and some cafe mocha. Creamy and very drinkable. Medium body is missing a little something mid palate, but only a minor detraction to this wonderful stout. Thankfully we have 5 more.","mrmanning","Beers"
