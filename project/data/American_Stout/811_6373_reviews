"Black Mocha Stout pours an almost black color with a nice large head.  There is a weaker oatmeal aroma.  The taste is a bit weak, nice oatmeal flavors, hints of mocha.  Weaker flavors.  Overall its nice, pretty plain, the weaker flavors do take away."
""
""
""
""
""
"A deep brown with a light tan head that leaves nice tight sticky lacing. The aroma tends to the mild, with just hints of dark roasted malt and maybe a little cocoa. The taste is also deep roasted malt, with just a hint of earthy hops but it has a nice simple quality to it. The body is lighter, but with with a nice full finish."
"Very good. Very dark!  Solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great look and smell but that is slightly lacking and not enough body."
"Great stout!"
"Probably the best of the Highland beers"
""
""
"Thin black pour with dark tan head;fruit and chocolate whispers; thin mouthfeel/lite tongue coating;coffee bean and thin malt start; light and easy to drink; I like how the coffee flavor is just barely there; chocolate malt and a little hop bitterness round out the finish; a very drinkable lite stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is easy to drink, which in this case is kind of a negative.  I wanted more bold and strong flavors, and a thick fuller mouth feel.  An OK stout, but for me didn't live up to a mocha stout."
"Lighter side for a stout. Nice session able, well rounded."
""
"Nice solid stout. Slight hint of coffee but it isn't overwhelming."
""
""
""
"o; Not getting an awful lot of ""mocha," but a good if lightish easy drinking stout.  I'd tend to call this a porter based on mouthfeel and ABV."
"Tasted off flavors. Might not have been stored properly."
""

""
""
"Smooth drinking, stout beer with exceptional flavor. A winter time seasonal favorite. This beer is only made for a few months each year& released in the winter season. A must have for the winter season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has a very good aroma of mocha, espresso, light char and toasted oats. The flavor has a creamy mocha, charred oats, smokiness, charcoal embers, bits of coffee roast and a bitter finish. My only complaint is its a tad too watery which takes away from the overall experience."
"Great coffee tones, smooth and sweet."

"Dark in color as are most stouts.  smells and tastes of coffee with some chocolate notes. Flavor is not as strong as I was hoping. easy to drink, but nothing really special about it."

"Highland Black Mocha Stout has a very thick, beige head, a black (with brown highlights) appearance, and some web lacing left behind. The aroma is of sweet, very dark roasted (but, not burned) barley malt, coffee, cream, and chocolate. Taste is of those elements, with a noticeable bitterness, probably coming from the char. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and Highland Black Mocha Stout finishes rich and delicious and semi-wet. RJT"

""
""
"My only complaint is I didn't freeze the glass."
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a very dark, brown-to-black coloring, with a filmy, surface coating of light tan head. Aromas of lightly roasted coffee, crème highlights, and subtle chocolate notes. Very well balanced nose. Flavors are roasted and bittersweet forward, with a blast of coffee, crème, and hints of smoke. Chocolate highlights, with a solid bitter backbone. The body is light and dry, with a tangy sweet and roasted bitter aftertaste. The finish is roasted, dry, and with a slightly bitter linger. Solid, drinkable brew."

"It's a very deep brown/black, that delivers a huge tan foamy head that leaves a good deal of lacing behind. Some streams of bubbles going up the side. It has a slight mocha and metallic scent. Some chocolate malt."
""
""
""
""
"More complex than I anticipated. Most stouts can be overly roasty or bitter, but this is neither. The cherry character is a special treat. If that sourness/metallic note weren't there, it would fare better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this poured out of the bottle into a stout glass. This is probably my favorite beer from these guys. This stout has just the right amount of sweetness backed by the coffee and chocolate notes. The aroma clearly masked these flavors. Dark brown color with a surprisingly mild head. Great dessert beer."

"The first time I had this beer, I was already drunk. As a coffee lover, I'm pretty sure I would have given it 5 stars all around at that time. However, I recently bought this and brought it to a friend's house for a night of drinking games, and it wasn't quite how I remembered it when I was sober. It's still really freaking delicious, don't get me wrong, but it seriously tastes like a mocha latte. There is a lot of complexity left to be desired while drinking this beer, and it can get you really messed up really fast if you aren't careful, because it seriously just tastes like an expensive coffee drink."
"Pours dark as night withcreamy one finger tan head. Smell is roast and some chocolate. The taste is roasted malt, coffee beans and dark chocolate with a thin mouthfeel. Many Souts will improve as the warm, but this one actually loses a little luster. Overall, pretty good, but not a great Stout."

"O - Excellent display of a good coffee stout, could benefit from a little more sweetness and alcohol to make the flavor linger more, cause it is a welcoming taste."
""
""
"this mocha stout isnt opaque- theres a small amount of brown when held to the light- thin tan lacing. the smell is slightly sweet with hints of chocolate. there is plenty of malt in the nose. the taste is malty with with hint of chocolate malts. the taste is pretty bold but there is a great smooth finish. this is a really good stout perfect for this time of year."

"Medium body with mild carbonation, barely there, but enough to move the flavors along. Easy to drink stout, which is nice given how a regular stout seems so uncommon in craft beer nowadays. Nice stout overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent coffee stout. Drinks easy and is a great early day brew."
"Overall: This is a pretty good stout. I've had better and worse. I'll probably buy it from time to time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an above average stout. The head was adequate but unremarkable. Appearance was good. Initial taste was good and spoke of dark chocolate and hickory but seemed to have a contrasting aftertaste to me. The texture was not as creamy as many stouts sampled in the past."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- solid, drinkable American stout. The bigger bottle was easy to finish off in a sitting. Could see drinking another, really. Pretty straight forward. With the hints at chocolate from the name, I might like to see more of its presence. Quite good."
"Looking forward to may another of these, my new favorite! And it's local too!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good coffee beer, the coffee isn't too strong and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very subtle yet flavorful stout with just the right amount of chocolate making for excellent drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This fits into stout territory without being overbearingly heavy or weighty, making it almost infinitely sessionable. It loses a little of the heft and just a touch of crispness comes through, but the creamy feel is constant, even as the finish goes a little drier."
""
""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
""
""

"The pour yielded a dark ebony color with a one finger foamy caramel-colored head with awesome retention and lacing. The smell was dark chocolate and licorice. Taste follows the nose. It is big and sweet up front, kind of milk chocolate with a sour sweetness. The finish builds slowly. At first it doesn't appear to be anything there, but it slowly build to a rich , bitter and satisfying mocha taste. Mouthfeel is very average, leaning toward being a little thick. All in all a nice offering."

"This is a very strange offering from the folks at Highland Brewing. The nose was amazingly complex but did not represent the style well, and the flavor profile contained hardly any mocha character. This seemed like a beer that simply went awry."
""
""
"O - Highland makes some of my favorite go-to beers for various styles, and this is no exception. An easily drinkable stout that still delivers something interesting."
"Not good. Lower than average. Will not waste my money again. I would expect a lot more out of a brew from Asheville, North Carolina. Seemed really plain and pretty sad for a ""craft"" beer.I guess it s par for the course, as I feel the exact same way about the rest of their beers. I would like to try some of their one shots to hopefully redeem them in my mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Happy first taste of Asheville."
""
""
""
"Overall: I could be temped to buy it again. Definitely a worthy contender for the style. People used to drinking slightly sweeter dark ales might find it too imposing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like this. No coffee in it, but it tastes VERY much like it does have it. I wish it was a touch less acidic, and a touch MORE toasted malt."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, this is a solid beer. not sure if it's a seasonal or a year-round, but it's pretty damn good nonetheless. very subtle, but dead on as far as stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Overall A solid beer. Wish it was a bit thicker. Still, not bad though."

""
""
""
""
"O- this aroma of this one was pure chocolate, but the taste seemed to fall a bit short of the expectations from the aroma. It was still very enjoyable, and would be a good choice for those looking for chocolate flavored stouts."
""
""
""
"Very good mocha stout, nice creamy body and lots of flavor for being only 5.6% ABV. You could certainly put a few of these down in a single sitting and be okay, as well as satisfied."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: good but too much bitterness and carbonation than I like in my stouts. Won't go out of my way to get this again."
"This is a dark beer much like one would expect from a stout. Good lacing and a thick head with lots of tiny bubbles. It has relatively no smell but then again I am stuffed up. The taste is very much coffee and roasted dark malts. It is a pleasant change from some of the other stouts that I have had recently. This brewery is making beers that range from mediocre to great in my book."
""
""
"Overall I'd give it more of a 4.3. A pleasant beer, even after sitting to warm for twenty to thirty+ minutes."
""
""
"O - Best Highland brew I have had, by far. Excellent stout! Love it. WIll seek it out again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a drinkable beer but you can do better. I wouldnt turn it down but this is not Highland's best offering."
""
""
"Overall its a good stout that I would drink again, but it would be better if it wasn't so carbonated"
""
"Overall pretty good, lots of coffee, mocha, roast, and very rich and creamy thick for being just 5.6%, although it does bring a bit of acrid burnt flavors from the roast, but not too strong. Overall a nice tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- It was okay. Wasnt a mind blowing hidden gem. Solid offering that I feel would be served to dial down the roast and up the smooth factor. I think this wouldve been better with a food pairing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good beer, would have again."
"Pours a jet black color with off-white head. Smell is of roasted coffee.. delicious. Taste is medium to heavy bodied, very sweet with some great roasted notes. Smooth and clean with great texture and finish to it. Tasty stout and definitely above average for the style, a great addition to the mixed 12 pack."

"Highland's Black Mocha Stout pours a solid black, with about a finger and a half of tan foam capping the beer. Head retention is pretty good, and there's some spotty lacing left around the glass. The nose has a nice, fairly potent coffee aroma. Dark chocolate provides a solid background note. The flavor profile follows that outline exactly. Lots of coffee up front, an impressive amount for a beer of this size, and then dark chocolate creeps in and adds a little depth so that the beer doesn't just taste like cold chocolate. The mouthfeel is just a little disappointing, in that it's a bit watery. I know the beer's not even six percent as far as ABV, but I'd still like the body to be a little bit more sturdy for a stout. The carbonation is nice and understated though. Minor mouthfeel issue aside, Highland's Black Mocha Stout is a really nice beer, I'll be checking out more offerings from the brewery next time I'm down in North Carolina"
"D: This had a nice scent and taste with solid body. The finish was pretty smooth, so it was easy to drink. Nothing special, but an enjoyable brew."
""
"O - Share not with light beer friends, Highland's Black Mocha Stout is as robust as they come, especially at a lower alcohol level. Acrid bitter roast takes hold of the tongue while the smooth body helps even out. This would be a terrific cool fall day beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice balance, not overly sweet. Savory overall, but the aftertaste could be more pleasant."

"-Overall 4.0: Satisfying, but at the same time not pedestrian in any way, shape or form. This stout has a body that is almost too light, but its other elements work together in such a way as to make you just enjoy the taste. One of the few session stouts I can think of. Worth picking up if you see it."
""
"Overall: Good stout, of medium robustness with a dominance of malt and just a little bit of chocolate. Not the best in its category, but above average."
"O - This is an average stout. It looked promising after the pour, but the rest of the beer was only average. The nose did not yield much at all, and the mouthfeel is a little bit too watery for a stout in my opinion. The taste had a little bit more chocolate and coffee than the aroma suggested, but still not enough to make this one anything special. I’m glad I tried this, but I won’t be getting it again."
""
""
"Overall I wasn't too impressed with this beer and I thought it was a slightly bellow average American Stout that claims to be heavy on the mocha, but instead of mocha all I got was flat bitter and over roasted black coffee. This beer doesn't have good drinkability, the bitter astringent finish and the lack of the flavor living up it's name would prevent me from wanting more then one, and it's a little tough to finish this glass. What I liked most about this beer was it's aroma, it was pretty nice and had some nice mocha like aroma to it. What I liked least about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, they were both off for the style and didn't work well with this beer. I wouldn't buy this beer again, and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone, there are lots of better Coffee Stouts around. I was pretty let down with this beer and so far I have yet to be wowed by any beer from this brewery, but I am still willing to give them another chance, better luck next time guys, this one needs a lot of work to compete with the better Coffee Stouts, but if it tasted as good as it smelled it might have had a chance, but that just wasn't the case with this beer."
"Thanks to Illudium for the sample!"
""
""
""
"ehh. there are so many better porters and stouts that I wouldn't seek this out. the ""black mocha"" name is really just a marketing ploy as it doesn't have any more coffee or chocolate flavors than any other decent stout or even many porters."
"Overall, average beer for me. A good drinkable stout, that really didn't stand out anywhere else. C+"
"O: Robust. Very drinkable. Even better as it warms. I'd be interested in trying more from Highland."
"Very dry up front. Its more bitter than i was expecting. Very dark, almost black chocolate. Very full of chocolate. I mean the name is Black Mocha. Light body, finishes very smooth."
""
"If I'm ever in Asheville, I'd love to try this on-tap. I was actually a little more impressed with their Gaelic Ale and I regret not having reviewed it now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a stemmed stout glass. Quarter inch head remained for several minutes leaving some lacing on top. Definite coffee aroma. Fairly strong, bitter coffee flavor. Dry mouth with just a hint of caramel. Full body, nice overall flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Better than average stout, especially for the chocolate fan. Seeing a head from start to finish was also nice. Definitely recommended for the choco stout lovers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: Despite the name, the brewery uses no coffee or chocolate in this beer. The chocolate flavor that they achieve is really impressive. Really nice for a stout that is so low in alcohol. It looks a bit thin initially, but this one surprised me a bit."
"Overall a good stout, however I think it could use some more chocolate and sweet notes to balance out the coffee and hop bitterness and be closer to what Highland describes on their label/website for this brew."
""
""
"Pours straight black with one finger of tan head. Aroma is all roasted malts: chocolate, coffee, tiny bit of burnt food on the pan that you left in the oven that still had some scraps on it, little bit of sweet caramel. Really well balanced on the nose, nothing super intense but well balanced. The taste is more of the same, lots of roastiness balanced with just a touch of hop bitterness. The mouthful is nice, smooth, full and very drinakble. Overall this was a really nice beer, nothing that will blow your mind but a solid choice for any occasion."
"O: A nice stout which delivers as advertised. There is plenty of ""mocha"" presence, along with a nice hop balance and some smokiness that make this a very drinkable stout. A touch too bitter for my taste, but solid."
""
"O-good solid stout that could make an everyday drinker for me if it was available here."
""
"O: Pretty much as the name describes. Tastes like you would expect a mocha stout to taste. Chocolate and coffee mostly with cream in the background."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Nice little stout that is tasty and very easy to drink.  Nothing unexpected, but it held my attention and could probably do so again.  My only complaint would be the thinness of the body and feel.  "
""
""
""
"O/D - This is a pretty nice beer that is very drinkable at the ABV and flavor profile. It's a nice light stout."
""
""
"This is a really good beer, don't get me wrong. I like it a lot and so far I like the brewery. I might like the Oatmeal Porter a little better, but this is a worth second. Nice job Highland."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There's really nothing wrong with this stout. It's a very middle of the road, easy drinking and still enjoyable stout. I would have liked a bit more of a full mouth feel to the beer, as well as more of a show of either the chocolate or coffee - mocha *is* on the label!"
"Pours a dark black like a stout. Thick, foamy mocha colored head upon pouring, but most of it disappears. The smell has a hint of chocolate. It's pleasant but not very strong. The beer is pretty light-bodies and drinkable for a stout. Tastes like a normal stout with chocolate. What I do praise them on is how they used the chocolate. I am not a huge fan of chocolate stouts that are overbearing. This one seems to get a good balance here. I get a good taste of it that supplements the taste of the beer, but not too much to where I can taste it over the beer. Overall a pretty good beer from a pretty good brewery."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, I was very pleased with this beer. I admittedly expected little due to the very low price tag (~$3.75, iirc) but my expectations were exceeded in a dramatic fashion. Not a dramatic stout, but a solid beer in which one could indulge without worrying about poor quality. Sweet, rather than bitter, drinkable and pleasant. My biggest complaint is that it becomes noticeably less exciting with time. I would much rather have a 12 ounce bottle than a 22 ounce."
"O: I normally do not care for anything with a (IMO) noteable tabacco-like finish, but I do like this. I do not get as much mocha out of it as I expected but it is not missing. Would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is what the nose advertised with roasted malt and coffee grounds and a bit of molasses mixed in for good measure. I dont get any hop presence nor ABV. The beer is amazingly easy to drink and I finish the glass much faster than anticipated. Quite an enjoyable beer that I would definitely buy again if it floated around on shelves here. Pick up a bottle in the south and enjoy a well-crafted American stout."
""
""
""
"THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING MISSY AND JOE!!!"
""
"Overall I think this is a decent middle of the road stout. Nothing outstanding but a solid go-to beer when I am in the mood for an easy drinking stout."
""
""
"O: It's definitely a little different than other lower ABV stouts I've had. They go really far with that roasty/char/ash characteristic. As I warmed up to it, it wasn't so bad, but it certainly wasn't desirable. I actually think a bit more sweetness could have balanced this out better. This is all bitter and roast...with barely a touch of chocolate. An average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I tried the Highland Moca Stout at Shakers in Roanoke, VA. the beer can in a classic beer mug and was dark opaque in color. The head was tan and not much in lacing. The smell included roast, espresso, and semi-sweet chocolate. The taste was very similar to the smell. The mouthfeel was medium body which I think is important for a stout. Overall I thought this was a good stout."
"Burnt malt in smell and taste ... they should have stopped the roast before the burn and smoke. It dominates the flavor and hides whatever else might be hiding underneath. I don't even taste the mocha (or coffee or chocolate). I feel like I was tricked into purchasing."
""
""
"Overally, could enjoy a few of these and likely will. Cheers!"
"Taste is full and rich, with coffee and mocha figuring prominently. Drinks smooth and creamy, like a milk stout with oatmeal. Very easy to drink, and a superlative brew. If I lived closer to North Carolina, I'd pick up a 6-pack pronto!"
"O: Well the aroma leads on to a delicious beer, the taste however is a tad lackluster. This beer lacks a backbone."
"O- This is a pretty damn good stout. I've had Highland Oatmeal porter many times and it is my favorite of the Highland lineup to date, but Black Mocha Stout may take the crown. Definitely worth a try."
"It's a little one dimensional, but a solid beer all around. In this area it's a staple in most beer stores, and pretty cheap too. It's a go-to beer on a cold day."
"It's decent, and for the price, I wasn't expecting to be blown away."
"O: a decent stout that failed to deliver in some areas. Nevertheless I was happy to try it since it's not widely available in my area."
"Overall not a great beer but still drinkable."
"Overall an enjoyable stout, worth trying, but not a classic."
"overall - not a bad beer, but not really in my wheelhouse. the smoke is a bit distracting."
"O - A nice stout that isn't available where I live. Glad I got to try it, and I'd probably pick up a sixer if I were to see it."
"This beer was poured for tasting into a pint glass. The beer poured a rich brown with light visible in the middle. The head was a nice rich brown. That dissapated quickly smells a chocolatey caramel like i got from a the milk stout although it doesnt smell as sweet. I definatley get chocolate nibs though not sweet chocolate. The presence of coffee is noticable to but faint. Beer left nice lace as I drank it. I like this beer but not as good as left hand milk stout IMHO."
"Overall: Absolutely solid mocha stout. My only knock is the aroma as for my nose, it seemed too light."
"Overall, this is a nice, dry stout. There are some excellent flavor notes here, and some interesting aromas. I am glad to have tried it."
"I could start every morning with a bottle of this. An awakening coffee brew on the senses."
"3.5 D: Decent beer, but failed to capture what I love about the imperial version."
"Pours black with tan head. Smell is an unassuming blend of dark roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. Flavor too. Fairly dry and slightly bitter. For the low ABV, this is pretty tasty. Body is medium with medium carbonation. Overall, a decent stout, but not something I'd rush to get again. Not sure why this is in a bomber instead of a 12 ounce bottle."
"Overall, I really like the qualities of Black Mocha Stout. Again, it has many characteristics I normally find and like in a great porter and yet it is a stout. I would have to rate it up there with the very best stouts I've tried."
"Overall: a nice beer. Seemed more like a porter to me than a stout, but still very nice. I'll look for it some more next time in in the asheville area."
"Rich, thick and smooth. Overall a very enjoyable sipper."
"O- not bad and goes down fairly easy but its so thick that you dont want to chug it. The coffee flavor could have been brought out more in the nose but it isnt bad."
"Black, with a short lived head and no lace. Faint coffee aroma. Thin body and medium high amount of carbonation. Mild coffee flavor in front that improves on warming. Slight burnt sugar finish with some acidity. Borderline 3/3.5 beer. Flavor is enough to push it over the edge."
"O: The words ""black mocha"" in the name imply a stout full of robust coffee and chocolate flavors. The actual beer doesn't taste anything like mocha. If you put this next to a regular American stout and asked me to pick which one advertised itself as a mocha stout, I wouldn't be able to tell you. It's not a bad beer, but it's very average."
"O: Nice mouthfeel. Not that bad, but not one I'd turn to when I'm in the mood for a stout."
"The name says coffee and the label says chocolate, let's see. Pours an opaque dark reddish brown with two fingers of tan foam, leaves a few thin rings of lace down the glass. Smell: mild roast, caramel, faint baking chocolate. Light smoke note. Taste: caramelized sugar, dark fruit note, slight acidity, even less dark chocolate. Semi-astringent grainy finish. Medium bodied, drying but sweet finish. Decent, but nothing great."
"The body was good, although perhaps a bit light for the style. Drinkability was good, the beer went nicely and didn't leave any lingering coffee taste in the mouth. Overall, a nice enough brew. Nothing special, but worth a shot if you see it."
"Really quite enjoyable. With a body not quite as creamy as expected, I am pleasantly surprised. Roasted flavors start to drain your palate after a while, but the first two are fantastic."
"This is a style that a lot of people get right. Highland is no exception. The beer pours dark mahogany with a medium to small head. The aroma is very good and true to the style with rich chocolate and coffee mixture and malt. Medium body with a watery texture. Green apple notes on the front end, but the taste is quickly overwhelmed by coffee bean and burnt toast. Reservedly sweet. Bitter finish with a slightly tanic aftertaste. A good beer. Refreshing with plenty of flavor without being too heavy."
"Overall just a great session stout with a relatively low abv and great flavor."
"Smell was very robust, deep roasted coffee and dark german chocolate. Hints of a sugary or caramel sweetness as well. Taste was very thick and complex. Big deep roasted flavor, almost a burnt taste to it. Lots of flavors of coffee and german dark chocolate. Cery thick feel, but not syrupy, great carbonation led to a great silk like feel. Nice big hoppy finish left a very long lingering burnt aroma, I could literally taste it for 20 mins after the last sip, very outstanding full flavor. Overall this was awesome, the perfect desset beer as a good stout should always be. I found no hint at all of any alcohol, nothing but great aromas and flavors."
"A good beer, indeed."
"O: Good combination of flavors but a little thin and under-powering. No major complaints but nothing really exceptional going on here."
"O: This is one of my go to stouts for a reason: it's quite good."
"Poured into an Old Rasputin nonic pint. Pours dark brown with creamy tan head of about two fingers. Looks good to me. Smell is subtle with some roast, coffee, bitter dark chocolate, and day old coffee grounds. Taste is similar with slightly old coffee standing out the most. Over all this is a decent American Stout and I would have it again, but this is nothing special."
"Overall, quite a good coffee stout. Doesn't wow on the aroma, but the taste and the feel make it a good experience."
"O- I was very surprised by this beer. I haven't had anything from Highland before, but I will go back and get some others now. I really really liked the earthy hops that shone through and balanced so well with the malt and other flavors. I will be getting this again as this is a great drinkable stout with an interesting but amazing flavor."
"The mouthfeel is just about right, it's highly carbonated and fairly thick. The drinkability is exceptional, this bomber was quite easy to finish off. A great stout from Highland that I recommend, especially for the low price that it commands."
"The beer is very dark brown with a light mocha head (I seem to be drinking a lot of beers that look like this lately). The aroma brings a big wave of coffee beans and roast. The beer is malty, with a moderate amount of roast and coffee in the flavor. The coffee aspect could be a bit fresher and/or higher quality, as fresh, strong coffee can be wonderful in a stout (obviously). The body is a bit thin, but as this is a pretty drinkable, easy going stout at <6%, I suppose that's to be expected, at least to a certain degree. Overall, not a bad beer."
"I liked this offering from Highland. You can certainly taste the coffee and dark chocolate, hence the name, but there is a good bitterness, too, that mixes well with the coffee. It pours like a Guinness Extra Stout, thick with a caramel-colored head."
"B+ (3.95)"
"One of my current favorites from Highland. Pours a deep, nearly opaque chestnut brown color, with a thin beige film of foam on top. Terrifically fragrant, the aroma is packed with a smooth combination chocolate and coffee. The flavor is likewise potent yet mild and smooth at the same time, with notes of creamy milk chocolate, weak coffee, a bit of nuttiness. The creamy smoothness of the texture further acts to complement the flavors. Overall, this one is flavorful but easy, making it quite enjoyable to the end."
"One of my favorite standard Highland products. A solid chocolate style stout. Pours black with a tan lacy head. Smells of roast, coffee and chocolate. Taste is dominated by roasted malts and a blast of chocolate. Very understated hops. Overall a very sweet stout."
"Pretty decent and tasty low ABV stout, good flavors and heavy like a stout should be. A bit rich to session. Would have again though."
"A pretty descent stout but nothing to write home about. Pours almost black with a weak white head. Chocolate and coffee on the nose. Some lacing left on the glass. The taste is fairly bitter with some coffee and chocolate notes. Pretty easy to drink. Don't love it, don't hate it. A descent session stout."
"OVERALL: A quality American stout. Lots of flavor on this one; perhaps more flavor that expected for the style. Better than average for sure, and a pleasant surprise in my beer travels. One I'll have to get ma 'n pa to pick up again. Thanks again for the hookup everyone."
"Poured black with a creamy light brown head that lasted throughout and had excellent lacing. The aroma was of burnt chocolate malts, a leathery yeast and a moderate does of hops with a strong coffee and dark chocolate note with just a hint of molasses. It tasted moderatly bitter with a note of coffee in the beginning and then progressed into a mild bitter chocolate-coffee flavor with a nice hoppiness at the finish. Mouthfeel was full in body and creamy in texture with a nice soft carbonation. Overall a nice, smooth and hoppy chocolate stout, a nice change up from the norm."
"D: Drinkability is high. However the complexity of this beer seems lost behind the coffee and chocolate. Would have again but definitely wouldn't seek this out."
"D-very drinkable. Done in no time"
"Nicely drinkable, but nothing too special going on here."
"D: This brew gets solid marks all the way down. I was expecting more chocolate flavor but it is good none the less."
"Poured deep, dark brown with a light tan head. Lasted throughout the entire experience with scant lace. Decently assertive aroma of coffee and cocoa, light hints of roasted grain and sweetness. This, again, is a rather one-dimensional beer. But the taste makes up for it. Nicely roasted coffee beans, blended mellowly with dark chocolate to yield a creamy, mocha/cappuccino flavor. It's like cappuccino superimposed on Guinness Foreign Export Stout (w/e it's called). Finishes with a rich chocolatey and toasted grain character. Body is a touch thinner than expected but the carbonation makes for a creamy and velvety experience. A nice beer to have after dinner with some cookies or something. I approve."
"Bottle, courtesy of lunch on BA. Pours a dark brown color with a 1 finger tan head of tiny bubbles. Some lace left as it settles. Dark roast notes in the nose along with leather and some dark chocolate. Medium mouthfeel and a little lighter than I thought it would be. Dark roast flavors dominate the flavor but not overly so. For the roasty taste I am a little surprised there isn't a more bitter end to this but rather only very slight and end a little dry. Overall, it a decent beer but not really a huge stand out by any means. At only 5.6% though, its pretty robust without being to boozy."
"DISCLAIMER: I'm a fan of IPAs, but since I'm brewing I'm venturing into other styles to attempt to round out my skills."
"Overall: not very impressive and not very memorable"
"D: The beer goes down quite smoothly but there's nothing really unique in the flavors that would want to make me try this again."
"Pours ruby/black with a foamy tan head. Nose is lightly roasted malt. Flavor is simple, some smokiness but smooth and tasty. Coffee, chocolate, and a little hop presence on the palate. Not a Great brew. as I found out about the 5 brews I tasted from Highland, but a pleasant, easy drinking stout."
"Mouthfeel is very good. Thicker and heavier than I would have thought from the pour. Very creamy and well carbonated."
"D: A night day to day American Stout. Not something I would consider amazing, but I would drink 1-2 of these. There are better ones out there in my opinion, but why not try it if someone hands it to you?"
"M - very smooth; low carbonation; medium body"
"D: A bit light for the style as far as body goes, other than that, a solid stout, be nice to try this on tap."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. it has a bit of creaminess to it as well, which I liked. Drinkability is good, it had some very nice flavors to it but also drank pretty easily for a chocolate flavored beer. Pretty solid beer overall."
"The one thing that is lacking is the mouthfeel. The beer is a tad watery, unlike the Highlands Oatmeal Porter which has a nice creaminess. All-in-all a good beer, though."
"Another good beer from Highland, though I'd prefer their Oatmeal Porter or Gaelic Ale."
"Tastes dry roast, almost acrid. Little sweet tries to fight it off, but the little that's there is countered by a md-strong carbonation (too much for my preference). Has an emptiness I'm not fond of. Like a small beer or a beer made from over-washed grains. Acrid and ashy. Light body and meh drinkability."
"Drinkability: Has the flavor of an imperial stout, but drinks a lot easier. Quite enjoyable."
"d-I really thoroughly enjoyed this brew. I question calling this a stout...seems way more porter like to me, but none-the-less I could easily throw back several of these in an evening. It is light and soft."
" Best of All Asheville, NC is only about an hour and a half drive from where I live so I'm supporting my homestate economy buying this wonderful beer."
"D--This is a very good beer, I would recommend this beer if you are looking for a flavorful stout that is more on the ""sessionable"" side."
"Drinkability - the flavors are well blended and balanced, not a real high abv for a stout which makes it a easy to drink brew."
"Drinkability: Nothing overwhelming, but definitely a great tasting good drinking beer; nice flavors and sweet nose combine for a pleasurable experience, but could be a bit more robust, and the body could be a little thicker."
"true to the style but nothing out worldly, worth checking out if it doesn't cost you and arm and a hooker."
"I think a quick fix for this beer would be more malts. But I hesitate using the word ""fix"" because there isn't much wrong at all with this baby. Another excellent brew from my in-state boys."
"What a nice little stout these fellows! Given the relatively low ABV, and the rather pleasant yet lighter feel of this beer,this baby could be drank all day long during the holidays or just plain chilly weather!"
"D: I am going to set up a trade for an enormous amount of this beer. It is perfectly drinkable."
"D: A good amount of roasted malt balanced with bitter hops, this American stout is slightly above average I'd say. The brew gets more complex and mellow as it warms, but all in all the ""mocha"" seems more like a gimmick than a front-running flavor. Not bad and worth a try if you're in the market for a decent stout."
"A nicely executed American Stout with distinctive, but not overwhelming coffee notes. Poured jet black with a thin mocha head. Up front just a touch of sour before the malt and coffee kick in. Well balanced hops stand slightly off stage and the roasted malt takes center."
"It seems a little heavier than its ABV, but that's only due to its bold flavors and malty backbone. All in all, this is a very nice stout from the Carolinas that I'd love to try again."
"Tried the other bottle I had, and while it wasn't as bad as my first experience, it wasn't remarkable enough for me to change my review from my initial impression. I'd probably give my second chance at it a C or C-.."
"D - Pretty good."
"D- So good. This beer is an interesting sort of cross between a dry stout and an imperial stout, and it works really well. Lovely stout."
"Pours a dark black color with a tan head and some lacing. Smells of deep dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Tastes of chocolate malts, roasted coffee and some caramel. Toffee in there as well. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth. Drinkability is good."
"D - Go for the Imperial version, it is quite outstanding. This beer is merely a notch above decent."
"Easily the best Highland beer I've had to date. I'm looking forward to drinking my other bottle in the next couple of weeks."
"D: A highly drinkable stout with a fantastic mouthfeel. Prost to Highland for crafting such an enjoyable ""everyday"" stout. The subtlety and care in creating this beer are readily apparent."
"D-pretty easy drinking. All in all a good beer. I could drink a few of these."
"D: I don't really know about this beer. I enjoyed the aromas, but the weird smoke/peat character on the palate and the lackluster body were a bit off-putting."
"M- Way, way too carbonated. it makes the thinner body feel worse"
"Poured a black body w/ one-finger tan head that died slowly and some lace. A rich, sweet buttery smell with chocolate, roasted, bread and hints of coffee malt all intwined into the aroma. Smooth, slightly chewey and creamy with a bready feel and minor amounts of sweet caramel and chocolate. Unfortunately not well-balanced as the roasted and coffee malts seem to be more powerful than anything and leave a husky, dry backbite. A very minor fruity hop presence in shadows of the malts leads to a very good but not spectacular stout."
"Pours a pretty solid black with a two finger mocha head that shows some staying power. My nostrils are filled with scents of chocolate, coffee, and pine resin, but heavy on the milk chocolate. The taste is wonderful, kind of like a kicked up dry Irish stout with chocolate added. Enough roast and hops to keep everything balanced. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, moderate level of carbonation, medium body. This is a great sessionable stout. Light enough to quaff, but flavorful enough to stay interesting. If these were more available to me I would buy them, a lot."
"The palate opens with a rather prominent bitterness with moderate acridity. My palate does grow accustomed to it rather quick, and I grow to appreciate the unsweetened cocoa and rather bitter coffee grounds that are present. There's some rather simple sweetness in the mid-palate, and this beer does dry out on the finish with a lingering coffee-grounds bitterness. A touch of grainy astringency is also present. Hops aren't Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, the high bitterness does get taxing after a while. This is among the more intense stouts I've had in recent times, almost worthy of being called Mikkeller Black-lite. Still, this is quite enjoyable."
"D: Tasty, a good stout all around, but not one that stands at the front of a line up."
"On tap poured into a Highland pint glass at the Mellow Mushroom in Asheville. A nice midnight black with a thick beautiful two finger beige head. Beautiful lacing effect throughout to the last drop. Black gourmet cappucino smell. Bittersweet taste of a full box of fine Belgium dark chocolates and nutty truffles. An indulgent work of art. Rather heavy but that's to be expected. It feels like you ate a full meal after you've had a couple. Not a session beer by any means but a nice change up every once in a while. I like it better than most other stouts I've had and I think it's better crafted than most of the other brews by Highland. I highly recommend it."
"This one didn't realy wow me too much. It's right on par with a standard mocha stout and it's good but it does nothing to really stand out from the crowd. Poured a pitch black with a nice foam head of about an inch and a half. Great malt smell. Initial tastes of chocolate with that fading into a nice roasted nut flavor. About 3/4 through this beer I had an Oreo and I gotta say that this beer does go extr"
"Overall a pretty decent brew. I would drink this one again."
"* Have enjoyed on both tap and from bottle."
"Jet black pour with basically no head whatsoever, which is surprising considering how thin & light it feels on the palate as you drink. Aroma is mostly just made up of roasted malts. Flavor is similar but with just a hint of mocha/chocolate in the finish. Glad I tried it, but not really something I would seek out again."
"Served from bottle into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Pours black as can be with a one finger tan head. Maintained nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, coffee, and vanilla. The flavor was of malt, chocolate, and coffee. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a very nice stout. It was not lacking in any aspect but also didn't blow me away either. However, I am glad that I have been shipping these as extras in some of my trades. It is a must try if you get the chance."
"M/D - smooth and light bodied for a stout, great tasting, could have a few with dinner and want more for dessert"
"Not quite as much coffee/chocolate as expected."
"D: Light body keeps it refreshing and easy drinking."
"Mouthfeel was rich and full for a session strength stout. Nice. This is a very easy to dry dry stout. I liked it a lot more than my Smell & Taste ratings would indicate. Very balanced!"
"Overall-- a very run-of-the-mill beer with nothing to seperate it from the pack. Not worth seeking out, but not so bad that you should refuse one if offered."
"Despite being somewhat bitter, this goes down easy and begs you to drink another."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Its a nice easy drinking stout with a pretty good flavor. Nice for a session beer as well. Its not the most complex I've had but I would have it again."
"The flavor is nice and assertive chocolate and coffee malt. The coffee flavor is well balanced and anything but astringent. Bitter chocolate and an earthy floral flavor help keep the coffee in check. The end of the flavor has cola notes and maybe a slight crème taste. The mouth feel is over all fine, but perhaps a bit thin for the style. But certainly not too watery. A good and somewhat special Stout, would be glad to try again."
"D: A very solid stout, well balanced and easy to drink, not super complex. I will happily finish off the six-pack, but I am not sure I would buy again. Worth trying."
"It's solid but nothing overly special. It's worth picking up a single."
"Drinkability is pretty good; I just wish it were a bit more intense. It seems to play it safe."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Wouldn't go out of my way to get this, but wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"This is a nice American Stout but by no means remarkable. It wouldn't be hard to put down more than one and more than two, it's a candidate for a good black and tan too."
"Overall, this was a very good stout that didnt' false advertise at all. Mocha was prevalent, as well as few other flavors, and it made this beer very flavorable and drinkable, moreso than the other beers I've had from Highland so far. Not spectacular, but a very good American Stout with some solid coffee notes included."
"All in all, this started out great but ended on an average note. Very good to try if you like very bitter chocolate / bitter hop flavors. If you like it sweet, try it once if you get the chance, but don't bother hunting down."
"D - This is a pretty good stout. Not overpowering with the coffee."
"I will have it again! So glad it's local!"
"A pretty drinkable stout, with a nice balance of characteristics where nothing is overpowering. And though there is no cocoa used in the brewing, a little more chocolate character would be pleasing in a brew called Black Mocha Stout. Regardless, a nice addition to my American Chocolate Week imbibing."
"D-Solid. A good easy drinking and flavourful brew. I actually prefer their Oatmeal Porter but this is a good second choice."
"Not a bad drink but nothing to set it apart from other american stouts and therefore nothing I will seek out again in the future..."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a completely black color with a decent, frothy light-brown head, lacing throughout. Aroma is chocolate, caramel and roasted malts, oats, dark fruits, and a hint of spicy hops. Flavor is roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, oats, and spicy hops. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy, fairly carbonated, a little dry, with a bitter finish. Very good beer, easy drinker, I really like that one."
" O : Another great winter/early spring brew from Highland Brewing Co. The draft version is awesome. A real treat. Its available in bottle too."
"D - A great stout. The flavors are nicely balanced, and the beer is enjoyable to drink. Would make a great session beer if it was available here."
"+ very enticing, heavy on the flavor. nicely hopped. a finely crafted stout. very sessionable, if only i could find them here in Texas"
"D: A little light for a stout, but that makes it very drinkable and smooth. Nice beer, but drinks a lot more like a porter..."
"This has some very good balance to it. At 5.60%abv it is easy to drink a few of them over an evening and not worry about it."
"D- This beer is retarded in the drinkability! Session beer for sure and even better because it is in the stout style which many other beers fail for drinkability. Everyone should try this one out for size. It might surprise you like it did for me."
"D: Good, solid easy drinking stout."
"Overall, this is a really nice example of a coffee stout and is exceedingly drinkable. I've always been impressed with Highland's beer, and this one is no exception. It's not going to be in your face with flavor, but for a good session beer, Highland Brewing Company got this one spot on."
"Though a bit one dimensional, this is not a bad beer. Would probably prefer a bit more hops in the mix, but really can't get too vocal about that given the style. Overall a decent beer that I would buy again."
"a very easy drinker. fairly balanced overall with no dominant flavors but a very rich blend."
"d- complex but simple. sticks to the basics. easily one of my top 10 favorite stouts ever. not paper thin and not motor oil sludge. easy drinking all the way. great stout for someone who would love to get into the style!!"
"Surely one to pull straight from the cellar without any additional chill, which is exactly what I did. And surely one to savor and not go through too quickly...just like a cup of fine java. I dig."
"drinkability: a sesionable solid stout"
"D-its not a bad light stout. for the alcohol content is has big flavor and would be a solid almost session type ale."
"As usual Highland does not disappoint."
"Highland Black Mocha Stout pours a dark brown with a tan head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma has a fair amount of coffee in it. The flavor is nice, coffee is a strong component, caramel malt too. There are some chocolate notes too. Very drinkable and very reasonably priced. Definitely worth a try."
"goes great with cheesecake"
"This kind of reminds me of a chocolate coke. Not impressed at first, but the flavor really improved as the beer sat. Overall, a fairly approachable example of the style, which seems to be a recurring theme for the Highland beers."
"argock (previous reviewer), i don't know you, but you pretty much hit the nail on the head. the biggest area that is lacking for me is the body of this beer. stout is a tad misleading here, and i think all the characteristics of this one point towards porter. actually reminds me A LOT of rogue's mocha porter. from the roasty malt, iced coffee, and cocoa to the nice, lemony thing going on from the hops in the finish. definitely won't seek this one out."
"D: A great tasting and smelling brew which falls short on feel, but it more than makes up for this with value. A good brew that I would probably pick up again, but I won't expect stout, but more porter-plus, which is fine given it's such a tasty treat."
"Sample at the Most Honorable SuperHappyFun Stout Tasting. Thanks to Rogueone for sharing. This Stout pours black with hints of ruby around the edges. Medium foamy tan head that lasts awhile. Patches of lacing on the glass. Roasted malt, chocolate and touches of dark fruit in the nose. Medium, dry body with a lightly roasted/smoked character. Flavors of coffee beans, malt, caramel and hops. The finish is sweet malt and molasses at first, leading to a lightly bitter coffee aftertaste. Pretty good overall."
"Black! A dark pour into a pint glass providing a mocha hued head that provides nice lacing throughout. The brew is dry with notes of both semisweet chocolate and coffee. The creaminess is a little lacking for the stlye. The tastes of coffee and chocolate are not effectively introduced on the nose, there is also a toastiness in the flavor that is similarly lost in the lack of aromatic foundation. I hate saying anything about beer that tastes fo chocolate and coffee! This is a good winter/fall sipper and I will return for more ASAP."
"Overall: Well made american style stout. The name of the beer says it all. If it claimed to be an IS it would be massacred but for a regular coffee stout it's well made and balanced w/the sweet chocolate and roasty flavors not outweighing each other."
"Want to get more soon. Was on vacation in OBX when I found it."
"This beer has a slightly chewy viscous mouth fell but it is not overpowering with a lot of sweet chocolate and roasted coffee notes.. The ABV is very well masked and even though this beer is pretty complex and rich it is pretty drinkable. Another solid offering from Highland, a very underrated brewery."
"Thanks to klevelandrocks for this great extra in our trade. I'm glad I was able to sample this."
"This is a delicious brew with a very controlled abv, making it easy to enjoy multiple in a sitting without being worn out by either overly intense or lacking flavors or intense alcohol content. Very good beer!"
"A nice stout."
"I picked up a bomber at Knightly Spirits near Universal Studios. Poured into a tumbler, the beer is opaque dark brown with a short tan head. I like mocha/coffee-flavored beer such as this because I feel like they take the best roasted tastes of a coffee drink. This also has a touch of orange peel hops and a dry dark chocolate bitter finish. The beer is thinner than most stouts, but I think that simly makes it more drinkable. This really is a tasty stout, worth a try."
"drinkability is good. a solid coffee stout that hits all the right notes. the coffee sings on the palate and finishes on a supremely dry note close to what was on the palate. cheers!"
"D: Light, yet full-flavored, this would be yet another good session beer from Highland. Quite nice in every category."
"Another great beer from Highlands...."
"Drinkability: easy to drink this one especially if you are in the mood for a coffee focused stout. Give this a try."
"pours dark to black with a slight tan head that rapidly fades. roasted malt and barley on the nose. big chocolate waffs. smells like young's d.c. very nice roasted coffee and chocolate flavors on the front with just enough hop bite to bring you back. a very solid local offering for us here in NC. a good balanced stout with the right amount of carbonation. would be a solid beer in the rotation for the stout fan."
"Nice stout. Good bitter edge with a roasted, chocolate/coffee malt flavor. The beer pours deep and dark with a light tan head. The aroma is composed of roasted malt sugars, cocoa and espresso. The flavor is similar, but neither flavor nor aroma punch hard enough to merit a higher score. There's a bit of fruit in the malt flavors that's itching to get out. A touch of honey also comes through on the palate. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I like, but I might be a bit too used to impy stouts at this point. The aftertaste lingers fairly well. It's better than I was expecting, to be honest, and I'd love to try more from this brewery."
"Drinkability: The beer is a little on the heavy side and leaves very much of a coffee aftertaste, but it's excellent."
"This irish mocha stout has a sweet and roasted malt smell with cocoa. Pours to an opaque black with a stiff carpenter-in-a-can head that laces as it slowly recedes. Taste is mostly roasted malt and a chaulky bitterness that starts in the middle builds and lingers in the finish. The mouthfeel is thin in the start but the carbonation gives some substance as the bitterness kicks in. Not as much mocha as I would expect but it appears to be bittersweet, and doesn't really stand out from behind the roasted malt."
"Mouthfeel is thin, but pretty on target for stout. Would be more drinkable, but there is a lot of roasty coffee that lingers like an impy stout. All that dang flavor and smell."
"The mouth is a bit over carbonated, but otherwise melds the flavors together well with its medium body. Definite drinkability for this one, it goes down easy and it's abv is low enough to enjoy a few."
"-Bye"
"The astringency really comes out at first but then the malt and lactic quality really settle everything down and leaves a smoother texture in the finish. Carbonation is light and would like to see a touch drier in the finish but still a very nice brew. Overall a very good beer with a nice mix of coffee and chocolate."
"Overall an average brew that I won't likely revisit."
"This is a drinkable stout. If you like dark chocolate, this is for you."
"D- Overall, this is a pretty tasty brew that is definitely worth a try."
"I received this in a trade from cbros. Can't wait to see what else North Carolina has to offer!"
"I wish I had 5 more of these!"
"D - A nice coffee stout, with a very realistic coffee flavor. Not overly dark or rich, but it has a reasonable level of complexity and it is quite well balanced."
"Good beer in a style that tends to get lost for me underneath the pile of big bodied stouts that I've been digging. Nice."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a nonic Imperial pint glass. The stout appears a nearly black color with about an inch of lingering, pillowy dark ecru foam. Nose and flavor are of dark roasted grains, bittersweet cocoa, mocha, bakers chocolate, coffee beans and a hint of vanilla. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with ample carbonation. A great version of the style. Worth seeking out."
"Very smooth on the tongue. Initially sweet with a bitter chocolate finish along with the roast flavor that makes for a great ending."
"Keep 'em coming. I had about five of these the first night I tried them. Good thing I took notes after the first..."
"Drinkability: Much better than I remembered, this is a really flavorful stout that packs a wallop for being less than 6%"
"D - Great full flavor, very complex in the taste, along with a nice thick body. This is exactly what a good stout should taste like. Aside from the not-so-great appearance, this beer has all the characteristics of what a stout should be. Definitely an all-nighter sessionable ale."
"Medium body. Very rich and creamy texture. Carbonation might be a little too lively for my liking, but it's not unpleasant. Very smooth drinker. Great finish. This is damn good, and, luckily for me, very readily available in my area."
"I would definitely buy this again if it were available, I'd keep this in my cellar for special situations if it were available in my state. I have to say, I really liked this."
"If you had not had this beer I would check it out. One of the most drinkable coffee stouts out there. That is all."
"Very drinkable, not a session beer but something you could drink through without complication. Not over powering."
"D: It's nice to have another lower ABV, 'non Irish-Dry' to add to the rotation sometimes... I'd be curious to try to the 'imperial version' to see how that compares, as I'd find this one to be just about perfect if only the flavour were a little richer and the mouthfeel a little more weighty."
"D: Good, but lack of flavor inspires me to not drink more of this."
"Black Mocha Stout has surprised me. I really wasn't expecting it to be anywhere near this good. Yeah, a little more strength (and coffee) would go a long way in the nose. A thicker body might improve it a little, as well. But, those are very minor complaints. This is excellent beer. Definitely pick one up if you run across it. Thanks, Chris."
"Is there oats in here? Sure tastes and feels like it. Oh-so silky smooth and creamy. This beer kicks some ass, delicious. Chocolate malts and coffee flavors are the main attraction here as there seems to be a deficiency of hops. Does not taste as big as the nose indicates, could use a bit more body. All things considered, it is a damn fine beer that I would love to have regular access to. Nice pricetag as well."
"22 oz. bottle. Near black pour with a rather white head that did not stick around long. Roasty aromas, malt with some coffee and light chocolate. Taste matches with roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate. Something I can't quite put my finger on like lactose or something. Normally would not bother me but this is not supposed to be a milk stout. Finish is ok but something with the lactose and slight metallic maybe? I've had this several times but this time seemed a bit disappointing. Probably did not help that I followed this with a Founders Breakfast, which was much more commanding of a presence. This still seems thinner than I remember. Worth trying, but this is a little underwhelming."
"Good work Highland"
"D: Nice, smooth, and easy to drink (if you enjoy coffee). I thouroughly enjoyed it and could easily drink my fill of these treats, all night if need be."
"D - a very nice stout"
"12oz bottle courtesy of BrewerB, thanks! nice dark black color which is to be expected with a coffee brown head. Smells roasty and tastes like a roasty stout although I don't taste any mocha or chocolate. Far too easy to drink given the robust flavor and low alcohol, my pint glass was finished in about fifteen minutes."
"D - This is a very good stout. I've been forcing myself to step outside of my natural attraction to west coast IPAs and this beer made me glad I did."
"The aroma is sweet and heavily toasted with chocolate, coffee, molasses, and hops. The alcohol is very much present and more than I was expecting for a beer with only 5.3. The appearance is black with a tan head that develops quite nicely. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is average for the style. Overall a nice stout but not a great stout, I don't like the bitter, acidic finish."
"Very drinkable, reasonable abv, rich tasting. I would drink this one again!!1"
"a bit too winey and sharp tasting to be completely enjoyable, and much better on tap than from the bottle."
"All in all, a solid stout. If it were local, this would probably be one of my standby dark beers. And i'd certainly be up for more. It's a solid stout with some nice coffee and cocoa richness without being an over-the-top coffee or chocolate syrup brew. Definitely would drink a few more if I had 'em."
"D - Growler was a good decision, I can drink this over and over."
"The mouthfeel is sturdy but not full. This beer packs a whole lot for 5.3%. Beers like these make me want to learn to really love malty beers as much as I love hoppy ones."
"Carbonation is just right for this beer and the taste carries on like it should. Very drinkable and probably one of the better mocha stouts I have had."
"Nonetheless, a solid stout that was quite enjoyable."
"Overall-a fine coffee stout, well balanced, good flavor, very drinkable. I enjoyed it."
"Up front, tastes as it smells, coffee, but again, it doesn't taste as strongly of coffee as some others I've had, and is a bit sweeter. The coffee flavor lingers, it seems like it's more of a gradual effect, and not all front loaded. There's a nice balance to be found here as the beer warms. Right away, I get a malty sweetness, but after a second or so the coffee catches up with it. There's also a little bit of a hop kick at the end in the back palate. Mouthfeel is full and chewy /sticky , I think a little more carbonation would help out a bit, keep things a little fresher. I do like that the coffee doesn't completely overpower this brew, making it pretty drinkable. The low alcohol content also helps on this front, there's quite a bit here from such a ""small"" beer."
"Pours a jet black with about an inch's worth of tan head. Good lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, dark fruits, and some alcohol. Creamy mouthfeel. Tastes slightly bitter with bits of cocoa and toffee. Slight sour bite on the finish. A little offputting. Good late night brew that is both warming and pretty tasty. Pretty good stout. Give this one a try if you get the chance."
"D- The low ABV and quality flavor make this a very drinkable brew."
"Drinkability: One at a time. Interesting, but there are better stouts out there. Too much mocha for me. I would have another though."
"Black Mocha Stout is a decent brew. It's dense and sweet, ultimately tough to drink a lot of. Give it a shot and see if it's your bag."
"I could drink this one all the time, and if it was available it would probably be a regular around the house."
"D: This is an excellent example of an American stout. It's not overly heavy, but is certainly flavorful and vibrant."
"Overall I am SHOCKINGLY impressed with the quality of this stout. I had the imperial version not but a few days ago, and i find this one to be much better. The coffee and chocolate profile is very nicely done here. Man. Just a very well made and enjoyable stout. Thanks again to khiasmus. Great beer."
"Tastes exactly as it should and what it says on the bottle. I wouldn't be able to drink alot of this in one sitting but I would actually recommend it to others as a good example of this style."
"Drinkability: I wasn't terribly impressed or disappointed by this beer. It was a decent stout, with coffee and chocolate notes, a dash of sweetness, and a few milky notes. Does everything it's supposed to (and all w/ a low abv%) without being groundbreaking or outstanding."
"a/s/t/m/d - 3.5/4/3.5/4/3.5"
"D- great brew, one of my favorites, the name of this beer describes it perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone. Great beer."
"Thanks to unionturf for the opportunity to try this one. 12oz. bottle served in my SA Sensory pint. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured almost black. Only the feintest light penetration visible at the bottom of the glass. Half inch tan head settled into a thin, broken cap. Some lacing, but weak legs. Nose is consistent with its name. Coffee, chocolate and malt. Taste consistent with nose, but a little more subdued. Coffee and chocolate flavors are very balanced; neither seems to dominate. Mouthfeel is somewhere between light- and medium-bodied with a mild carbonation throughout the mouth. Easy drinking and very flavorful for the style and abv. A little more body would really make this beer exceptional. However, letting the brew warm helps to dissipate the carbonation and bring out a silky character. I'd love to see an RIS come out of this brewery."
"D - Very high for a stout, crisp finish."
"Drinkability - Very high for a stout. Could definitely drink a couple in a sitting. Nice stout that I can enjoy even in the South Carolina summer heat."
"coffiee, dark chocolate, and burnt caramel hit my tung and a kiss of of hops and and sweet alcohol come in in the end, this is a nice rich stout that i would drink often if given the oppertunity to get them, all of highland's products are tasty! try some"
"D- Nice smooth black malt flavor with good roasted bitter notes. The peat hint is just enough to add depth but not enough to taste like band aids."
"The flavor is very robust, and the beer is fairly dry with only hints of roastiness left in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is soft and silky. This is an outstanding stout that is worth seeking out."
"M/D - A little on the thinner side of where I expect my stouts, but I would still call it medium bodied. Also lacking the creaminess. Still, a very good tasting a very drinkable stout. My favorite of the Highland brews that I have had to date."
"Pours black and immediately releases the smell of a strong coffee. Large, tan head and opaque. Smells of strong coffe, chocolate and slight hop aroma. Tastes like coffee grounds at first but then seems to ease up a bit as you swallow. A fairly smooth beer but does have a an acrid taste from the black malt(?) or maybe the mocha. An ok beer but not my favorite as the coffee flavor is a little strong for my taste."
"D-I could drink a few on a cold night"
"This is a nice big flavorful stout. The taste is the best part over the look smell. That's not a bad thing. Look forward to more Highland brews."
"Pours black with mahogany tints around the edges when held up to the light. The tan head was big and fluffy but dissipated very quickly to a few wisps on the surface leaving a bit of delicate lacing. Aroma is roasted malts and a hint of coffee with dark fruits and chocolate. Taste is also dominated by the roasted sweet malts but the coffee is a little more evident than in the aroma. The finish is slightly bitter with bakers chocolate, espresso and some hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly creamy. This is not an exceptionally complex stout but is extremely tasty and drinkable. Highly recommended as an example of an American stout."
"Excellent - highly recommended."
"The balance is also evident in the taste although heavy roasted and coffee take over well into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin but even and not overly carbonated. Slight sour finish. This is an easy drinking, full flavored stout that shout find broad appeal among educated beer drinkers."
"The drinkability is excellent and this beer is an ideal complement to breakfast or brunch, or perhaps as a dessert by itself. I can see it sitting happily alongside hickory-smoked bacon, a couple of over-medium eggs, with grits, orange juice and brown wheat toast."
"Very nicely done. One of the better American Stouts I've had."
"Medium bodied, smooth and creamy with a nice amount of carbonation. Goes down easy with some nice straightforward flavors. A very drinkable stout."
"Thank to MuenchenerKindl for this one. It pours very dark, almost black color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly like most coffee beers do. The aroma is more of milk chocolate than coffee, but there is still some coffee in it. Roaste malt and vanilla round out the aroma. The taste seems to be where the coffee lies. Milk chocolate, vanilla, and roasted malt linger in the finish with more coffee at the end. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with light carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very good beer. I have a soft spot for coffee stouts, and this is one of the more balanced ones I have had. I wish this were available in my area as I would choose this over Bell's Java Stout most of the time."
"Very dark brown body with light brown soapy head. Heavy roast. Mocha in the finish. While some cream in mouth, some astringency in finish as well. Lacey. Bitterness on heavy side. SO neither would I say clean taste nor black, but still worthwhile to try."
"D - goes down easy. Good flavor and low abv make this a very drinkable stout."
"I liked this one overall, but expected to enjoy it a bit more. I would have thrown a bit more sweetness into the mix and beefed up the mouthfeel a bit, but in the end this is still a pretty nice brew."
"Overall, while not ground breaking or even complex, this is a very solid stout that is quite enjoyable."
"Very drinkable and a solid stout."
"Overall: Another clear winner from the good folks at Highland. I've got one more of these with me that I owe it to myself to save and have with my scallops & shrimp. This is an excellent American stout and all-around enjoyable quaff. Bravo."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black, some red in the edges, thick tan head forms, settles to a thin ring, some lace spots on the glass. Smell is nice, coffee - almost mocha, chocolate, dark fruits, some toffee, grains, quite nice. Taste is caramel, chocolate, light coffee roast, some dark fruits, nice graininess, rich flavour, smooth balanced finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, nice to drink. Thanks Russ!"
"Overall pretty solid. Nothing over the top - and I like that."
"pours basically black with slight ruby edges and a big tan head. Smell is rich, creamy roasted coffee beans and very fresh and balanced. Taste is a touch metallic at 1st and noticeably thin bodied. Roasted malt and a medium to strong coffee flavor, but the flavor and body are just too thin, and kill this otherwise nice beer. Smells good, but the rest is average at best."
"D- Not overly drinkable due to the richness of the brew but decent."
"drinkability is good. good balance. very tasty and enjoyable."
"Another good brew from Highland. I wish their beers were available in my area because the few I've tried have been good at the worst and great at the best."
"Finish is smoky and mild without a lingering aftertaste. Living in Asheville I'm a big fan of Highland and this doesn't disappoint at all."
"This one had more hops than I remember it having. I believe this was the first NC beer we had after moving down here and it was enough to convince us that quality beer was being made in this state. Certainly good enough to grab a six-pack every once in a while."
"Not quite as black as I would expect for a beer with Black in the name. There are lighter brown hints around the bottom of the glass and al ight tan head that vanishes quickly. Roasted chocolate malt is the most defining smell but overall the aroma is not as powerful as I expected. The chocolate malt has a sweet, almost milk chocolate smell. Very mild hop taste carries through a milky & malty beverage. The malty flavor and creaminess is fantastically tasty. Smokey flavor like dark roasted cofee makes this a perfect treat for late afternoon. Light and watery mouthfeel from the hops but a milky/malty stout coats the inside of the mouth. I find it just as creamy as a milk stout but with a cleaner mouthfeel. For less than $3 for a tall bottle, I could easily drink this more often."
"Taste is laced with a powdery cocoa presence & roasted, smoky malts. Baker's chocolate and hops pull through on the finish to make for a nice bitter aftertaste. It's a bit watery and undercarbonated to be an upper-tier mouthfeel, though. I would certainly buy this again, however. Highland rarely disappoints, and Black Mocha Stout was no exception."
"Poured into a pint glass (Wasatch) a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little tannish creamy head, not much sticky lacing to follow though. The nose is malty, big notes of toffee/chocolate/caramel. The taste pretty much follows the nose, slight sweetness, and the big dark stuff. Medium body. Drinkable, a pretty tasty American Stout."
"Another beer courtesy of a trade with barefootbrewer. Pours a beautiful black color with decent tan head that dissipated rather quickly and did not leave much in the way of lacing. Aroma was roasted maltiness and chocolate. Flavor was also malty with chocolate and coffee notes. Mouthfeel was good. This was a nice stout."
"Pretty solid stout, I just thought that it would have more chocolate in the taste."
"Wow, this guy packs exactly what I like in my American Stouts. Fantastic full flavors and a low ABV that make this one easy drinking flavorful beer. I'll definitely be seeking out more of this in the future."
"Nicely drinkable beer, with a moderate ABV and excellent balance. Full, but not heavy, I could easily drink a few of these."
"Do North Carolinians know how lucky they are to have Highland Brewing? These guys are immensely talented and deserve much more recognition than they get. As a music critic once said about The Cars first album, 'drop the needle anywhere and prepare to be impressed'. The same can be said about Highland beer."
"Thanks to barefoot brewer for the sample."
"Nice surprise with this one. Will definitely be having this one again when I can find it."
"I admit to being a wee prejudiced in favor of stouts and porters, which is why I tend to rate them high if they're good. However, this one does deserve kudos. Color is a deep sable, almost black, and opaque. Aroma is fairly strong, smoky, with rich roast coffee overtone. Flavor is very smooth, tasting rather like roast coffee with hints of chocolate and just a whisper of hops. I heartily recommend this one to all porter and stout fans."
"M/D: Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is just right to aid the full body and also give a hint of itself on the tongue. Drinkability is fine as well especially at 5.60%. Pretty solid stout."
"D: Excellent brew. I am continually impressed by the quality of NC microbreweries and Highland is surely one of the best. This beer complemented some pumpkin and cream cheese cake very well. Inexpensive and delicious, I will be drinking the Black Mocha Stout again soon."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, slightly filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good and flavorful beer to sit back and relax with. A bomber or two while watching a movie is the perfect role for this beer."
"Pours pitch black with a medium brown head. Very thin lacing that hangs around a little. Smells of dark chocolate and HEAVY malt. Tastes of coffee and dark chocolate with thin hoppy balance. Mouthfeel is heavy in a good way. Very smooth strong coffee palate. This a great dessert beer. I had this in a beerbar/restaurant in Clemson, SC with some cheesecake. Wonderful combo. I will definitely try this beer again when I get the chance."
"Prosit, MK"
"Deep, deep brown-not quite black in color. Heavy roasted aroma with a slight hop bite to it. Burnt and roasted flavor. Slight nuttiness to it. Good hop bitterness. Slight coffee taste. Decent mouthfeel. Good stout-was expecting a bit more mocha/coffee flavor from the name but that could just be me."
"Drinkability is not so high. Not a bad beer, just very assertive in the roastiness and bitterness"
"Tasty treat."
"Hadn't bought this for a couple years so a bomber seemed appropriate. In fact, I had it before Stone's 11th Anniversary...not nearly the same beer but in terms of what it is I feel it was better with ease. A deep dark pour with a nice tan head. Smell was of roasted grains. Chocolate and a little sweet mocha in there. Taste was very nice. Deep roasted chocolate and coffee again with a nice nutty undertone that is quite refreshing. A nice hop presence toward the end. Silky and clean mouthfeel and almost too easy to drink. Highland knows how to make some very sessionable beers, this one included in a quality list."
"D: The skillfully crafted taste of this beer is evident. It's got more balance than a tight-rope walker, and is sure to please anyone who's a fan of the malty stuff. Very easy to drink and even more easy to enjoy."
"Drinkability - This was a decent beer. Had a nice taste to it not too bitter."
"This beer poured a thick black with a huge brown head. The smell is roasted and malty. There are coffee and mocha aromas noticeable as well. The taste is chocolate/mocha initially followed by some roasted flavors and bitterness. The varying flavors seem to meld well. The mouthfeel is full but not chewy  somewhat creamy. Overall, I think this is a tasty and well balanced stout that Id definitely recommend."
"D - Overall the drinkability was great. This was a wonderful stout and delivered on the promise of the style and labeling. It was everything my taste buds were waiting for. I would love to have a six of this on hand any time"
"This beer had a very good appearance, a nice head and aroma. However, it was rather strong on the taste side of things which I guess should be expected from a mocha stout. It is just not as smooth as some famous irish stouts such as guiness and murphy's."
"This one grew on me, at first it didn't seem like it was gonna knock my socks off but as it went along it became a very inticingly fun brew to drink. I think the overall subtle tones in flavor and body really worked well together and made for a very approachable drinker of a stout! Thanks to mjgardner for the hookup of Highland!"
"D: The low abv and nice mocha finish redeem the beer, creating a decent flavor that, while it won't transcend the stout style, it won't turn you off from stouts either."
"Very fine low ABV stout. Not as impressive as the nose would suggest, but impressive nonetheless. Main knock I have is the mouthfeel. Which seems to be way to thin and watery and leaves nay a finish. Flavors are much like the nose without the amount of melted caramel. Mocha, vanilla, dark chocolate, blueberry, blackberry, mollasses, black cherry, caramel with a cream brulee wondering. Some roasty notes as well. Could have been higher on drinkability if not for the lackluster mouthfeel."
"D - A tasty stout that is a little on the thin side but that probably just adds to the drinkability. I would like to see this one a little more ""stout"" like and it would be great."
"I certainly will try it again when once I again encountered and will happily update this review with those results."
"Pours a deep opaque black with a decent frothy head that leaves good lacing on the glass. The aroma was strong of coffee, cocoa and roasted barley. The taste was slightly dominated by dark chocolate, with espresso and roasted malt not far behind. The beer is not at all heavy on the palate and the carbonation is just right. This beer is great for a cold night, but even now as it's getting warmer out, I still love this beer."
"Not a bad stout. I got it in a trade and don't know if I'd trade for it again but if I could buy it in a store near me regularly I probably would."
"D: The flavors are well balanced for this stout. Not overly sweet or bitter with a subtle dryness. Very drinkable."
"D: I really like the 'coffee-flavored' stout style and found this to be a terrific example. I'd gladly have this again. Excellent flavor and good balance."
"Pours a dark coffee brown with a rich tan head that goes away slowly leaving some heavy lacing. The smell is dominated by roasted coffee, which is a good thing. There's a slight bit of chocolate in the nose as well. The taste is where the chocolate shines. There is strong coffee flavors up front with some dark chocolate throughout & a bit of a sry hop finish. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, just like a good stout should be - could be a little richer though. As my dessert tonight, I could drink another bomber. I wish I had some more of these. High Recommendation."
"Pours black with ruby highlights and no head, no lacing. The smellis fairly faint,but has notes of light chocolate, some sweet malt, and a touch of roastiness. The taste is of pleasant dark malt, some milk chocolate, and a slight roasty bitterness. The mouthfeel is light but smooth, and fairly creamy. Pleasant, and pretty drinkable, but not a lot going on here."
"Overall a superior stout. Very complex and very sessionable. Need to score some more. Thanks to brentk56."
"Slight astringency on the finish is the only drawback to what is a solid, highly drinkable American stout."
"D - wow. drank the 22oz bottle and was very happy with the experience. Tempting to pop a second bottle to and quaff another."
"Thanks for sending this my way Loki."
"Run of the mill stout. That's good, cus I like the stouts, but this isn't exactly worth searching out."
"Overall good beer with only hints of mocha. Pretty much your average American Stout, but a very good edition of it. Recommended."
"A dark brown/black beer with ruby highlights. Has a big foamy tan head. The aroma starts with a strong chocolate note. With a nice coffee character coming in behind it and a little piney hop note in the background. The taste is dominated by a rich roasted malt character. With the chocolate notes hitting the front of your tongue and the coffee lingering on the back."
"I am always impressed with Highland's brews. This beer even surpasses my expectations. Looks a viscous, malty, roasty brew with tan head retention, lacing and everything else that is good in the world. Smells very chocolatey, syrupy, with hints of espresso, nuts, and dark fruits (fruit cake). Tastes even better. Best described as a Young's Double Chocolate Stout, but bolder. Hopped for balance and that's all. Allows the roasted grain and coffee flavors to round out the bitter flavors. Feels rich and smooth with a long lingering chocolate / coffee mix. Tough to find a better stout."
"Pours black with brown edges. Some carbonation, but essentially no head and little lace. Smells quite grainy; lots of sweet chocolate malt with a bit of coffee and herbal hop balance. Flavor is sweet with powdery cocoa at the forefront. Becomes toasty with coffee malt in the center before finishing with burnt bread and late hop dryness. Body is somewhat thin and overly carbonated for a stout. Somewhat unbalanced, though saved by decent flavor."
"Thanks to SilentSabre for this one!"
"This is a well done, flavorful stout that avoids being over the top on any one front. A: Deep dark opaque black with a nice but thin creamy tan head S: Strong hints of coffee, chocolate and caramel with a touch of almonds. T: Very chocolateywith slightly burnt coffee finish M: Thick, chewy and robust. Nicely viscous. D: This beer despite the body and flavor drinks surprisingly smoothly. A session of this beer might leave one full, but very satisfied. A nice stout among the stable of excellent Highland beers."
"Went great with my home made from scratch chocolate chip cookies."
"Mouthfeel is a little watery for the style, but still nice. Drinkability is very good, not at all filling, I could have a few of these."
"A good local brew."
"The 12 oz. brown bottle was adorned with the typical Highland Brewing Company motif with a Scottish theme. The pour appeared reddish brown and clear out of the bottle, but in the glass it was very dark brown and nearly opaque. The head was khaki in color and one finger thick. The aroma was that of a dark roasted espresso, with a smattering of chocolate. The taste was drier than I was expecting, as the dark coffee and roasted grain flavors supplanted any residual sweetness. Not much chocolate coming through in the taste to justify the mocha in the name. But despite that, this was a very delicious stout with a pleasing palette. A little hint of tobacco juice in the finish was followed by a brief hop flourish. Prickly and granular mouthfeel stopped just short of being chewy. This turned out to be a solid stout all around the board, so I am glad I bought the sixpack instead of a single bomber."
"While not pitch black, this beer is rather opaque. Poured a two-and-a-half finger head. The head dissipated in a moderate amount of time, only leaving a small amount of delicate lacing. The smell is of chocolate and coffee -- definitely inviting. Roasted malt comes through in the taste as well. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, not overly heavy. This beer is exceptionally drinkable, which is not a bad thing. I rarely drink more than a beer or two, but I might make an exception for the Black Mocha Stout. IMO, this beer compares favorably to most American Stouts."
"D- I paired this beer with brownies that my wife had made and I think that that pairing proved a success. Obviously since this is a mocha stout they should go well together. But what I liked most about it was not that both had chocolate in them but that the subtle nature of ths stout didn't overpower the taste of the dessert. It simply added to the experience. I would pair this beer again with a chocolate dessert that, even though on the heavier side, does work well."
"Drinks really easy, nice quaffable stout!"
"Sampled at the brewery during a tour. This beer poured nearly black with a 2 inch creamy head that left a layer of lace on the glass. Aroma was of coffee, chocolate and flowery hops. Taste was very roasty and coffeeish with a good bitter kick of hops. Mouthfeel was fairly smooth and made the beer easy to drink. Body was medium. This beer reminded me of a slightly lighter version of Sierra Nevada stout. Very tasty and worth picking up a bomber or 2."
"Damn this beer was a let down; the smell had so much promise. This is a beer that shows how appealing to everyone satisfies no one."
"drinkability is fair and its a little thin for the self-proclaimed 'most robust' beer in the highland lineup. ok coffee beer. just ok. not really recommended, but i might have had a bad bottle with all the sourness i experienced."
"The beer poured blakc with a finger of tan head that didn't retain very well or leave any lacing down the side of the glass. The beer smelled incredibly of darkly roasted malts with dark coffee undertones. The beer's flavor was of chocolate, burnt malts, and a lightly hopped finish. This is a tasty brew that's super drinkable. If I could get my hands on this one more often, I would definintely reach for it more often."
"22 oz bomber. Pours a very deep brown, almost black, color with a small light tan head that settles to full coat over top. A medium cascade of bubbles can be seen working up the sides. Aroma is a good combination between roast and chocolate. There is a kiss of sweet coffee in there as well. It has good balance between the sweet and the sharper roasted notes. Flavor is nice as well. Solid roasted notes that are mellowed by the lightly sweet chocolate, finishing with a mild coffee. It has a very creamy character to it that really rounds out all the flavors, keeping them all a little ligher than I would like. This one could use a little more forcefullness. This carries over into the mouthfeel, as it is somewhat creamy, with a light carbonation. It's moderate in body. I enjoy this one, but it just seems to lack anything that makes it stand out. It's tasty, just a little unlively."
"Overall, this was very drinkable. I'd drink it again, but at $5 for a bomber it was a little on the pricey side."
"Stout pours an opaque black with a generous head. The head stuck around and laced nicely around my glass tankard mug. Malty aroma, nice roasty flavor up front with notes of chocolate and coffee. Brief bitter finish and mouthfeel was a little watery for the style. A little too drinkable for my taste but the stout was very flavorful."
"poured from a 12 oz bottle. pours dark black color with brown around the edges. heads is there when poured but makes a quick exit. smell is of bittesweet chocolate with some hints of coffee. taste is very close to how it smells. the mocha flavors of this beer is very noticable.mouthfeel is pretty solid, not creamy but not either. overall, a very drinkable beer that is not heavy on the abv but has a lot of good chocolate/coffee flavor."
"-SS"
"Quite drinkable... another winner from Highland... I wish this stuff was easier to find, although I have heard that this problem will be remedied in the near future."
"Overall this is an extremely well done beer. Delivers stoutness, smooth, rich, and delightful mouthfeel, and, perhaps most importantly, flavors upon flavors. It's complex, it's tasty, it's overall a very drinkable beer, and I'll readily buy this again. As with any stout, you might not want to sit down for more than four of these, as I have a feeling they'd sour eventually. Apart from that though, there's no reason not to snuggle up to one of these."
"Chocolate and mild coffee aromas. Black in color. Head is odd...bubbly on the sides, but creamy across the top. Flavor is a touch metallic in the fore. Some decent roastiness in the middle, but there is an odd rancid sweetness, like of old chocolate in the finish. It is not intense, but the flavor is there none the less and it hurts the beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" dark brown head above the almost opaque dark brown brew. Head fades slowly, with heavy sticky brown lacing. Aroma is dark chocolate and light coffee. Taste is as the nose indicates, with the mocha very nicely balanced. Mouthfeel seems a bit thin, but it is definitely smooth, and drinkability is excellent for the same reasons. A brew I would be glad to revisit, if the occasion arises."
"Drinkability is high for a somewhat complex brew. Highland continues to impress as it develops and expands its offerings."
"I'm very thankful to NClifestyle exposing me to some of the great beers coming out of North Carolina these days, with Black Mocha Stout certainly among them."
"This is quite a drinkable stout, if you're in the mood for some coffee."
"Drinkability - a top selection from Highland, a big shout out to merlin for bringing this one along for trade."
"Perfect mouthfeel. Very smooth and clean. A great beer in my opinion."
"cheers..."
"I love a good stout, and this is definately a good stout. One of the better American stouts that I've encountered."
"Poured a 22 ounce bottle at Thanksgiving dinner. A wonderfully dark beer, almost black with very dark brown tones. An extremely rich foamy, tan head was present after pouring. Good retention too which after awhile became very good lacing around the glass. Right from the beginning, you can smell the roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and a hint of toasted bread. The smells clearly prepare one for the taste, rich dark malts, chocolate, and coffee. There is a very mild hoppy undertone that creates a certain crispness to the beer. Some stouts can be overpowering being sipping beers at best, but this one has a nice clean finish. This is definitely a keeper from Highland! Went very well with a turkey dinner, too."
"Pours from the 22oz bottle a deep black with dark brown highlights. No light has a chance of passing through. Head is a good two fingers of coffee-colored, big-bubble creamy foam and has some staying power. Aroma of rich, roasted dark malt with a hint of chocolate and a touch of molasses sweetness. Palate is more of the same - rich roasted malt, chocolate, and espresso, accented by the faintest hoppy bitterness. Body is a bit thin for the style, but still nice and creamy. A good offering that hearkens back to the best of the pre-popped cap days here in North Carolina."
"Dark black with a nice head of tan froth. Good retention. Smells like burnt chocolate. Tastes like an awesome chocolate coffee or espresso. Full of charred goodness. Is much lighter in body than I expect, but it is still a medium bodied stout. Very drinkable. An enjoyable well balanced delicious malt. Another great beer from highland."
"Last swigs: Liquid burnt pumpernickel toast. An average stout. While in Charlotte, I was lucky to find and try some Highland brews. This one didn't disapoint, just didn't go anywhere new either. Pretty cheap deal: $3.49 for a bomber at Brawley's."
"This beer is dark but not the darkest I've had. It is mostly black with a faint hint of burgundy. It has a slight smell of coffee. It has a taste that is similar to a chocolate beer. A fairly bitter beer. Little head. I could drink these a lot. According to Highlands website, this beer will now be offered in 12 oz. bottles. Highland is a good brewery. I intend to sample each of their beers. I would try this one again."
"Find some. Treasure it."
"[thanks to mntlover for this nice brew - Highland makes some nice stuff!]"
"Mouthfeel is medium, not really creamy, but more of a thin oil consistancy on the tounge. Feels somewhat crisp too. Drinkability is superb, not a crushing abv level and plenty of refreshing taste and you have a winner in the drinkability department. Highly recommended."
"A very drinkable stout that brings Highland's uniqueness to the style. I hate that this beer is a bit harder to find than their other brews. Can't wait to have it again!"
"Notes: Some beers look real pretty and disapoint the tastebuds. This beer is the opposite. Looks nothing special, but is a very solid stout."
"Drinkability- If the carbonation were toned down and smoothed out this would really be a top notch stout. The soda texture kinda ruined the whole experience for me. Even though, it's still not that bad if you can put that behind you."
"drinkability: quite drinkable, interested in seeing if a bigger version of this beer will be on the way in the post pop the cap era of NC beer"
"Drinkability: Easily a session beer for me. It borders dangerously close to a porter in my book. The lighter roasty flavor and mouthfeel profile make me think porter but I'll respect the brewers call for the style on this one. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is of velvet, and slightly roasted malt in this full bodied brew."
"Taste: simply a wonderful thing going on in the mouth. All those flavors mentioned in the nose combine beautifully for a dark, delectable symphony on the palate. Rich and sweet, chocolatey, but still enough bitter to keep the thing in check. Immaculate integration, exquisite balance, almost flawless. I could drink this forever...damnably good. It feels great to meet once in a while such a fantastic creation as this, and know that stupendous stouts aren't just conceived once in a while,from the usual suspects, but are cropping up all over the place, created by a host of talented brewers across the U.S.A!"
"Overall, I could really see myself having more than one of these beers in a sitting. At 5.3% abv, it's a great session beer, and the flavors in this are downright amazing. A top notch beer."
"Medium to large body with very light carbonation and a slick and silky mouthfeel. It definately has an oily texture that really coats your palete. It finishes with a mouthfull of semi-sweet dark chocolate flavors and a hint of bitter coffee. Delish. I think Shakespear Stout has a new nemesis."
"An translucent black body displays ruby-mahogany hilghlights below a full head of frothy dark tan foam that holds quite well and leaves thin rings of craggy lace about the pint. The nose is mocha-like and caramelish. It's medium bodied and smooth across the palate with a mild caress on the tongue from its restrained carbonation. The flavor is fairly rich and complex with notes of dark malt acidity, yeasty fruitiness, caramel, coffee and chocolate. It's well-balanced by a firm bitterness, and it finishes dry with a lingering note of yeasty fruitiness and some lightly roasty mocha. Very well done!"
"Taste: strong roasted malt taste at first, then a fine coffe and dark bittersweet chocolate ending with a dry, bitter finish. A fine american stout, makes me proud to live in NC with a beer like this made here. Complex, tasty and smooth with a creamy, latte like mouthfeel that makes it go down easy. A great session stout if there ever was one thought slightly filling. It's probably fairly rare to find, especially outside NC but if you ever see one grab it, it may be the last and is a great value at $3.49 a 22oz bomber"
"This is Highlands' best offering, other than the very limited release, Cold Mountain Winter Ale. Black Mocha seems to be somewhat of a rarity, itself, based on my repeated failures to find it in the North Carolina mountains. I'm looking forward to this brewery's move to expanded quarters, so they can brew more of their top shelf offerings like this one."
"Pour black with hints of red brown head that falls quickly. Smells a little subdued roasted malt and coffee with light citrus hints. Tastes much larger then smell roasted malt with hints of coffee, chocolate with light hop kicker near the end. This beer is just a pinch light for a stout but the drinkability is awsome ever drink has my mouth wanting more. I have found a good warm weather stout here not overly heavy just right. Only had 2 bomers wishing I had more."
"Yum, yum, yum! Had this one at Biltmore House in Asheville. I saw mocha, I saw stout, knew I had to have it. Waiter seemed impressed. ""Excellent choice"" he said. I grinned. (Beer snob!) It came in a glass, duh, thick dark color. Nice caramel head. Didn't last throughout, but did lace the sides. Smelled like mocha java coffee. Tasted like it too, with a thick feel. I really enjoyed this one. Next to youngs dbl chocolate, I'm thrilled. Guess what, I can't find this one in a store either....waaah!"
"Pint glass at Barley's Taproom in Knoxville, TN."
"Shazaam!!!! No, not the ""awesome"" Shaq movie. I am talking about how great this beer is! This is one great brew from Highland brewing that I am going to try to get more of, even though it's hard as hell to find in these parts. It was a black color with a dark tan head. The head was thick and frothy for a little while, and then died down to a spotty laceing. The different smells detected were chocolate, espresso, and little hints of alcohol, as well as faint hints of citrus. The biggest smell that stood out was the espresso though. The taste was similar to the smell, but also had a creaminess to it. Once again, the espresso was the stronger taste of the whole group. Overall this was a very smooth beer that ranks very high with me against it peers. If you ever have the chance to try this one, don't let it go."
"Had a nice traditional color black with maybe a slight red hue in there,appetizing in the pour with nice caramel colored head.I do agree with other guy who reviewed this one not much smell,a little chocolaty/earthy smell but not much.Taste was nice and chocalty and earth with that smokey tinge coming through in the end.Pretty good velvety body.Another good one from Highland."
