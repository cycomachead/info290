3.12,-6.3,3,3.5,3,3,3,"On tap at Ford’s Fish Shack in South Riding and served in a small snifter. The beer is a dark brown that’s nearly opaque, but shows some cola highlights when held to the lamp. Minimal head once it got to the table which settled to a sheen. Clearly a barrel aged beer from the aroma which is deep with vanilla and oak. There are roasted malt, molasses, and char notes as well. Taste is not exciting and leads off watery. It is moderately sweet with vanilla, molasses, and a dusting of cocoa. It is also moderately bitter on the finish with espresso, oak, char, and roasted malt flavors. A weak medium body, thin texture, moderate carbonation, and a sweet woody finish.","SierraFlight","Jan 24, 2015"

The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, wood, sweet alcohol, subtle caramel, and smoke. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. I saw this one on the menu and that it was bourbon barrel aged and had to try it. However, while the barrel was definitely there in this one it really made me wonder how good the actual base beer really is as the barrel was pretty much the dominate factor on this one. While being okay to drink it did leave a little to be desired. Worth trying at least once if you can, but I would leave it at that.","thagr81us","Jul 12, 2012"

Also presenting in the aroma are notes chocolate. Tastes good with the bourbon vanilla and smokiness of the malt still present. Bitter chocolates are also apparent in the taste. Feel is very smooth, not quite as carbonated as I would like, some oiliness in the feel as well. Full bodied. Overall I very much enjoyed the beer, a good representation of the American Stout style.

Barrel is almost comically absent given the title of the beer. Distinctly average. Mouthfeel is good carbonation with a sugary finish and a fairly light body.

There is a great deal of vanilla on the nose with oak portions. Hints of coffee waft into the aroma as well, surprisingly I can smell no bourbon as of yet. The palate is rather woodsy upfront, but the vanilla helps it to fade back and go down easy. The aftertaste has some bitterness due to the late arrival of the coffee flavor to my palate. I wish I'd gotten a little touch of bourbon in this beer, but I am sadly out of luck. This is a good beer to sit down and drink and enjoy.

3.18,-4.5,4,3.5,3,3,3,"D: Just doesn't have the girth to even approach the 2nd tier for this style. Middle of the road.","argock","Jul 29, 2010"
1.96,-41.1,3,2,2,2,1.5,"D: Another piece of evidence that -bals do not always make a beer better/good.","womencantsail","Jul 19, 2010"
3.35,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"D- I didn't really know what to think but this was a little bit of a letdown. I was hoping for more of a bourbon flavor and just a tad bit thicker.","Wisconsinality","Beers"
3.28,-1.5,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"D: One and done. Easy to drink but the mouth feel is off. Way too thin and watery. Flavor is weak and needs more behind it. Not that great at all.","rwf08","0"
3.17,-4.8,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,"This is a very confusing beer because the little information we have from the label was misleading. No clue on the ABV but I would guess it to be on the lower-side","zachary80","Jul 11, 2010"
3.92,17.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall a very decent barrel aged stout. I might seek this out again.","beerwolf77","Jul 07, 2010"
3.3,-0.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"D - Meh. Too thin and something seems a little bit off otherwise it's a fair bourbon barrel stout.","BeerFMAndy","Jun 27, 2010"
4.07,22.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This is drinkable for sure...not as complex or strongly flavored as other BA stouts, but worth a try.","mgbickel","Jun 15, 2010"
4.03,21,4,3.5,4,3.5,5,"Over all a great beer. Nice to try a ba brew that you can drink nice and easy.","pastradul","Jun 06, 2010"
2.6,-21.9,3,3,2,2,3.5,"The beer pours from the bottle but with a lack of head and the dark coffee lacing you would expect. This follows through on the smell which has little in common with Bourbon other than place of birth, the mouthfeel is thin as reported above but the taste has enough malt to hang in there as a drinkable dark beer, its just a disappointment as a Bourbon Stout.","cilldalua","Jun 02, 2010"
1.6,-52,1,3.5,1,1,1,"If you have any, don't drink it. Just pour it out.","AleWatcher","May 19, 2010"
3.62,8.7,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"D: In all, it isn't a bad beer. I'll pay more for a more substantial stout any day, though.","mondegreen","May 05, 2010"
4.12,23.7,4,4.5,4.5,3,3.5,"D: This is a pretty tasty beer, but I don't foresee me drinking more than one of these at a time. Highly recommended.","AgentMunky","Beers"
4,20.1,4,4,4,4,4,"D-Probably one of the easier drinking barrel aged stouts around. I'm not sure of the ABV but there is really very little alcohol presence detected. Overall a well done Bourbon barrel stout from Bluegrass.","CaptinRedBeard","0"
