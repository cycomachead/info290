"Surprisingly lacking from the BA version."

"Pours a thick black with little mocha head. The smell is sweet with heavy chocolate and coffee notes, with a few hints of cinnamon as well. The taste starts sweet and heavy, with the spices coming on then finishing very spicy with some heat. Almost like a chili pepper beer. It has a heavy thick mouthfeel, smooth, with very little carbonation. Overall a drinkable beer but the spicy finish deters me from liking it."
"A subpar stout infused with excessive heat to compensate."

"There is definitely a habenero kick to it, which lingers. The other components work against each othe, IMO. The mouthfeel is oddly smooth for a beer with this type of bite on the back end."
""
"3.53/5: Good chocolate, really good hot peppers...not-so-good mouthfeel"
""
"Thick head, definitely got some habaneros in there. Not overwhelming which i am glad of. A good beer, not thick, lingering flavor which i also like. I am not disappointed that i got a six pack."

"Had this on tap. After reading other reviews, I think some people must have very delicate palates when it comes to heat. Strong initial coffee & chocolate taste finishes in a smooth yummy tingle on the back of the tongue, with just a hint of pepper taste itself. I'm a big fan of Odd Side's unique combinations and I LOVED this."

"Nice smell. Not a fan of the habanero. The heat of the habanero on the tonsils detracts the taste of the cinnamon, nutmeg and coffee."

"Solid black color with a smallish tan head that dissipates almost instantly. Aromas of cinnamon and nutmeg with a whole lot of chocolate and some light earth and roast to round us out. The flavor is spices up front with chocolate coming in next, nutmeg pops out again before the spicy heat settles into the back of the throat and just lingers there. Medium body with a light level of carbonation. That is a tasty beer. could use a hint more carbonation, but I still enjoyed the hell out of it ."

"t/m/o - not as full bodied as i expected, but the flavor is there.  a wonderful blend of chocolate, spice, coffee, cinnamon and nutmeg.  super silky, super smooth...a bit on the thin side, but then again this isn't an imperial stout.  great great great beer...definitely seek this out."

"I like spicy beers and was very curious how a coffee, spice and Habanero pepper flavored beer would come together... overall a good beer, definitely drinkable, but you must like spicy things to enjoy... I could see myself drinking 1-2 at a time, but no more than that in single evening."
"My first review so this will be brief and echo others....pours with a thin head which was a little surprising. Great chocolate and spice flavors with a perfect amount, for me, of Habanero on the back end. Very interesting drink that grows on you. Only negative, as others have noted, is the watery mouthfeel.  Maybe not a go to beer that you always have on hand but certainly one to try and to savor on occasion."

"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but this is a delicious and drinkable stout that gets better as it goes."

"The flavor on this beer is great. I found the spice from the habanero was hiding on the bottom with the settled yeast. The only thing holding this beer back was the mouthfeel. I found it very watery."
""
"finally starting to get some habanero on the back end..... really nice..... pretty good stuff!"
""
""
"Overall, this beer was an experience to drink! Odd Side really balanced all the ingredients well and produced one of the more interesting beers I have ever drank."

"Dark brown beer with a brown head. Smells like chocolate and coffee. Has a strong coffee flavor, with a hint of nutmeg and cinnamon, and has a nice burn from the habanero at the end. A little harsh, but still enjoyable. Surprisingly, the bourbon barrel aged version seems a little sweeter and has less of a bite than this. I really enjoy the concept, and beers like this is the reason I admire Odd Side Ales for their creativity."

"I've had this on tap at Oddside, on tap at other places, and in the bottle. I seem to remember that about a year ago, I thought it was with too little body. It seems this has improved since then, however it could still bear a bit more (5%) base malt and a bit less (5%) roasted malt. As it stands, however, this is a very unique beer in which you can really taste all the ingredients and they are all in balance with each other. A testament to the brewers, as this is a tricky recipe."

"Overall- The smell got me interested, flavour kept me interested but the mouthfeel absolutely derailed this beer. It wouldn't hurt to get some more body in there."
"Overall - Nice adjuncts, even if they overpower the beer."
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and cinnamon aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, cinnamon, and pepper flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with nice cocoa and cinnamon qualities all around."

"It's ironic that I realized this beer's true power after it disappeared from shelves. $12 for a sixer isn't the best price, but still pretty fair. It's not quite in the same league, but this tastes like a satisfying little brother of Prairie Bomb! Definitely get it if you see it on the shelf."

"O - Overall, this is a delicious beer. Wish the appearance was better, and think this would be better as a richer, fuller imperial stout. Still, really really enjoyed this beer!"

"O: this is a great pass at the spicy stouts, the flavours all blend together quite well"

"Overall: I dont know what it is, but I am really getting into these mexican style stouts lately. This beer is honestly just as good as Prairie Bomb! The only difference is that Prairie Bomb has a thick full mouthfeel that is just way better. I am pleasantly surprised and I honestly did not expect this beer to be this good! Its my first introduction Odd Sides Ales, but this beer has won me over, I am a fan of this Michigan brewery!"

"O - This is a very unique stout with some heat in the back end. Very impressive look to this along with an inviting smell that works into a really solid tasting brew. Loses points with a bad aftertaste and mouthfeel. I will not get this again."
""
""
"Smells like chocolate and the taste follows up front, some coffee and creamy smoothness in the middle. It then leaves you with mild lingering pepper. By far the best pepper infused beer I have tried, the pepper is there but never overbearing. I will definitely buy this again."
""
""
""
"I really can't believe that this isn't rated higher. I was originally thinking that this is one of those perfect beervana moments, but the more I keep drinking this beer, the more I really like it. Appearance is like any other stout-dark and opaque with a small amount of head. Smells of chocolate, light coffee roast, and a hint of cinnamon. Tastes of chocolate, cinnamon and on the back end, the perfect amount of heat. Mouthfeel is moderate. Overall, I love this beer. I wish it would have more body and little bit more sweetness, but this is a terrific beer as it stands. Must get more."

"Man, this sucker packs some real heat! Not for the timid but if you're a fan of spicy foods, this will fit right in with ya. Lovely brew."

"Revisiting from the bottle on 1/7/14 from a free beer contest from MikeM. Thanks! Pours pitch black with a finger and a half of appropriately mocha colored head. Huge fudgy coffee aroma with hints of cinnamon and spice. This smells awesome. Flavor follows with rich fudge, earthy espresso, and just a small bit of zest from the peppers and cinnamon. Lingering spicy coffe chocolate cinnamon flavor left on the palate with a small bit of heat left in the throat. Medium plus body with medium carbonation and very smooth. I have had both Bomb and Pirate Bomb and find this to be better than both of those, with more pepper kick than Hunahpu. Awesome and underrated brew!"

"Mayan Mocha Stout is an all around good beer. The spices are appropriate and the underlying stout is good as well. It's supremely drinkable for a spiced beer and a stout worth searching out. Odd Side does a good job putting odd twists on already good beers."
""
"O - Needs more body but dig the hot pepper burn."
""

"O: Chocolatey, coffee with a rnice ound bitterness. The beer definatly came alive as it warmed up."

"Verdict: An ambitious beer that really misses the mark. I do have to say that I appreciate that all the adjuncts are notably represented in the beer, and that the haba√±ero isn't too overpowering. However, the balance is poor, the body lacks any substance and it just all around fails to redeem in any way."
"Overall I thought this was very nice beer and very nice example of the style, all the aspects seem to work pretty well with each other and they make for one flavorful and unique stout. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth and the taste did a great job at holding my attention but I think the warming heat would start to wear on me after a couple so that would be my limit. What I liked the most about this beer was how well all the different aspects in this beer worked together in the flavor and aroma. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, I thought it was a little too thin. I would for sure buy this beer again, and I wouldn't mind keeping some in the fridge for when I'm in the mood for a beer a like this. I would recommend this to anyone who likes coffee beers and doesn't mind some spice to go along with it, I pretty much recommend it to all my friends. All in all I enjoyed this beer, I thought it was a little different then the draft version since the nutmeg and cinnamon seemed a little toned done, but other than that it was pretty much just how it remember. It would put it up there with citra and bean flicker as my favorite bottled beers by them so far, good job Odd side Ales, keep up the good work and interestingly unique beers."
"O: If you're going to put mocha in the name of your beer, you need to have coffee and CHOCOLATE. Having chocolate in this beer would improve it by leaps and bounds, as it would compliment the coffee and pepper very well and keep the spices from being too cloying. Hopefully we will see another version of this from Oddside with chocolate. That would be a great beer."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, cinnamon, nuttiness, cream, light pepper, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt with coffee and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, cream, light pepper, and roasted earthiness. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, cream, light pepper, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with coffee and spices; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Some light pepper heat builds up on the finish near the end of the glass, but it is pleasant. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice spiced stout! All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt, coffee, and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Mayan Mocha Stout is a pretty good beer, but I'd appreciate it more if it were winter. Sorry, but I don't like much (especially THIS much) cinnamon/nutmeg and/or similar tastes in my stouts during the summer. For what it's worth, I'd only bump my score *slightly* either way. Definitely a unique stout, so give it a whirl."
