2.58,-17,2.75,2.75,2.5,2.5,2.5,"O - A very neutral and forgettable beer. It does not seem to have gained any significant character from being brewed to this high alcohol content.","Radome","Oct 24, 2012"

2.73,-12.2,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"330ml bottle from local bar in Calabria, Italy. Pours a deep crystal clear golden copper with a medium lasting white head, some lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, some dark fruit notes, dates as it warms up, with some yeast and alcohol esters. Taste same as aroma with some sweet bitter flavors, and a bit of spicy notes as well. Palate is a medium body with good carbonation. Finishes with some sweet caramel malt, dark fruit, yeast, dates and a lingering sweet alcohol and nutty flavor. Overall nothing really stand out for this brew, an average ale.","Samp01","Sep 24, 2012"

2.68,-13.8,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Had this one in Torino, Italy. Medium airy white head on top of a clear yellow golden colored beer. Smell of hops, malts, card board and a hint of hay. Taste hops, iron, malts, medium bitter, light sweet, hint of something light fruity. Sharp bitter herby aftertaste. Low carbonation, medium body, tingly mouthfeel and a light watery texture. Not too well balanced and very average at best.","stoutman","Jul 11, 2011"
2.99,-3.9,4,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Pale golden yellow colour, just over one finger of dense white head, sticky with some pretty good lace. Smell is malty and bready, fairly earthy with some alcohol, not a whole lot going on here really, smells like euro lager. Taste is biscuity and malty, fairly fruity, under ripe fruit in the finish, some alcohol heat here and there. Light-med carbonation, medium body, decent feel. This isn't a bad beer really, I found the bottle to be to big (660ml) I wouldn't seek this out but would drink it again if it were given to me.","peensteen","Jun 11, 2011"
3.06,-1.6,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"O- A very easy drink and overall a decently enjoyable beer","Cozzatoad","May 17, 2011"
2.3,-26,2.5,2.5,2,1.5,3,"Dr: High ABV, and a very low price especially for an import. That said, it's barely drinkable and wouldn't even make a good beer for getting bollocksed with the lads on a night in. Leave her on the shelf, lads, and get some proper beer.","kojevergas","Dec 16, 2010"
2.85,-8.4,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Overal: it had too much alcohol for it's depth of flavours and body feel, the sort of beer that gives you a cracking headache if large amounts were to be consummed.","BlackHaddock","Oct 12, 2010"

1.63,-47.6,2,1.5,2,1.5,1,"Notes: Ughhh This is a high alcohol flamer at its finest. This is an adjunct lager that has tons of alcohol. Crisp, Clean, Refreshing, Interesting? forget about it. I see they have changed the style to Euro Strong Lager which is exactly where I""d put it as well. Avoid.","DogFood11","Jun 11, 2005"
2.91,-6.4,4,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Opinion: Needless to say that I am a bit disappointed in this beer. There is too much corn flavor and aroma for my taste, and it tastes like they were just trying to crank the gravity up. Oh well...I'll just have to keep trying to find the ""holy grail"" of beer. Heck of a job I MUST say. Oh! I see you are doing it too! ;-)","SkeeterHawk","Sep 07, 2004"
2.5,-19.6,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Belgian strong dark ale this is not. More of a Euro strong lager. Anyway, medium-yellow body with a small, sticky, off-white head. Nose is stale-ish cereal malts, light alcohol; not much going on here. Taste is one-dimensional, with hearty cereal malts dipped in cheap honey. Gets sweeter and a little warming. Minor hop presence is uninspiring. Medium-bodied, kinda sticky. Not as kerosene-like as I expected and actually was pretty smooth for the abv.","alexgash","Nov 13, 2003"
3.06,-1.6,4,3,3,3,3,"like everyone else i tried this in italy, in rome. the villa borghese was across the street from my hotel and i'd buy a few bottles from a vendor in the park and throw them in my back pack for later that night. the appearance is good. it has a good head. color is boring transparent gold. taste has some bite to it but you get use to it soon enough. an ok beer that does the job in a pinch. i.e.... your on vacation in rome and good beer is very, very, very hard to find.","flaminghomer","Jun 22, 2002"
3.23,3.9,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bought in Italy in a green bottle. Light to medium golden color, crystal clear. Thin head that didn't last too long. little carbonation. Smell was sort of a skunky maltiness. Starts like a mild lager with a bit of skunkiness and finishes with a stronger maltiness (slightly fruity) and alcohol bite on the middle to back of the tongue. Starts sort of light and finishes strong.","canoehornpoint","Beers"
3.38,8.7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"From my notes 6/11/07 pours a one-finger white head that quickly to a ring, leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Malty hoppy nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is slight maltiness and slightly cidery, smooth. Â€2.80 ($3.84) for a 330ml green bottle from Autogrill Badia Al Pino Ouest, Italy.","jdhilt","0"
