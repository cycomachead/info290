Strong alcohol content and a sweet taste. Enjoyed this beverage at many establishments in Legnica Poland. Does anyone know where I can order this from in the U.S.?","Michael1979","Jun 21, 2013"

2.44,-23.8,3,1.5,2.5,3,3,"Overall, after the initial bad smell, this is not that bad for what it offers. I am now already down to half the glass, drinking it rather quickly and I already find it better than when I opened the can. Either it gets better once it warms up, which I doubt, or the 7% ABV has gotten me.","Douberd","Nov 19, 2012"

2.99,-6.6,3.5,2,3,3,4,"This beer was fairly bland and slightly watery, no real aroma. I consider 7% abv quite strong but the beer hides this very well, i was expecting a drain cleaner for taste but it's a very drinkable lager just don't expect too much taste(hops/malt etc). Blandish macro, was a good price, would buy again.","az77","Jun 04, 2010"
2.33,-27.2,4,3.5,2,2.5,1,"This beer had been reduced to Â£1 as it was slightly over its BBE date, I bought the last bottle and this WILL be my last bottle of this beer. Debowe Mocne could be even 'gassier' than San Miguel and that is some statement from me as I thought nothing could be as bad as that which is why I have only given it 1 for drinkability.","AEK","Beers"

3.16,-1.3,3,2,3.5,3,4,"pleasant taste, kind of malty and bready with some light fruity notes...quite pleasing for a strong lager, lacking the usual sweet nasty syruppy taste - a very drinkable brew","benclimbs","Feb 17, 2007"
2.38,-25.6,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"This beer reminds me of malt liquor from the states and it's for the same purpose. I am disappointed and I was expecting more from a 7% beer.","weissbierdrinker","Jul 03, 2006"
3.68,15,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Poured a light amber color with a medium-sized white head. The head dissipated but left some mild lacing. Mellow aromas of malt, metallic grain, and mild hops. Taste is sweet and bitter malt, light hops with a fruity quality. Some light spice notes in there too. Pleasant carbonation. A nice and drinkable lager, went well with some Polish meats and cheese at a picnic in Warsaw. Certainly a pick over the Zywiec lager everyone was drinking.","lehows","Apr 30, 2006"
3.58,11.9,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall - An OK beer - nothing groundbreaking... Better than the initial aroma indicated... worth a try...","mdagnew","Jun 14, 2005"
3.15,-1.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"500 ml can, bought in Poland. Golden to amber colour, large head. Fairly strong sweetish musty and fruity aroma. Flavour is fairly malty and sweet with evident alcoholic notes, partially balanced by tolerable hops. I had it on its own at cellar temperature, would probably prefer it cold with a solid Polish meal.","Sigmund","Beers"
