"decent brew that packs a punch"
""
"Overall : I'm going to just Echo what I've heard and that's to just try it yourself. It's unlike any beer I've ever had and that's both a good and a bad thing."
""
""
"Typical Russian malt lager. Over here it comes in pop bottles. I detect a faint taste of raisins to go with the alcohol in all honesty. Sounds bad, looks average, but the taste is unique. Worth it to try and see if you like it."
""
""
"Pours a clear golden amber with a typical off-white head. Not impressive, but this is a pale lager. Aroma is crisp and malty, and has a hint of fruit. Flavor is malty, just a touch fruity - not much more. Texture has decent fizz, but body leaves something to be desired. Fair to middlin’, leaning towards fair."

"It's a Russian classic that everyone should try once."

"Poor hate tht crap don't buy"
"This beer came it a handsome can which led me to believe it would be better than it is.  I would probably rate it lower if I were more familiar with Euro Strong Lager style beer."

"A bit too strong for my taste."
"500 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 12/6/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, apple, white grape, cracker, bread, honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Okay aromas with decent balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. A bit too fruity/estery on the nose. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and slightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a pretty solid pale lager style. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Slightly bready smell, taste was somewhat bitter and ultimately unredeeming. This beer, even with a high ABV is pretty disappointing. Large bottle does well for sharing (if you're into that thing). Not really worth the time."
""
""
"I don’t really care for this beer because of the weak taste paired with high alcohol content.  It’s OK, but I probably won’t be buying more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Surprised the general rating is low.  Somewhat sweet taste and the ABV balance is nice.   Light color but bold taste."
""
"O: There is some crispness, but the higher ABV reduces the lightness of the lager style."
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Well, nothing thrilling here. Toasted biscuit malts. sweet caramel, some hop notes but generally pretty boring, Definitely not the kind of ""strong ale"" I prefer to drink. Although I do feel like listening to to Anya Muzafaroza ""Music of the Rain"" as I drink it."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 51 oz plastic bottle (yes you read that correctly. Pours murky gold with thin white head. The nose is sweet and grainy with notes of musty grapes. The taste is sugary sweet with light grain and more sweetness. Mouthfeel is well carbed with thick body. Overall, this brew is an experience... Not necessarily good."
""

"Unfortunately, I've found nothing but skunked excuses for this beer in the occasional bottle I find on the shelf. After three or four tries, I've all but given up. Maybe it's just guaranteed to be fresher at a bar."

"Pours a medium light amber with a strong head. Lots of carbonation. Slightly sweet aroma and an even sweeter taste. Lots of carbonation and quite frankly, not bad. It's got a nice medium flavor that goes down pretty good. Not sure what the negative reviews are about but I thought this was a decent beer."
""
""
""
"O: Other than being a strong beer, it really does not have much going on for it."

"Ok first off, this came in a PLASTIC bottle, dead giveaway that its gonna be hairy. By ""extra strong", I'm assuming it meant extra malt. The aroma was acrid. Imagine malt vinegar you put on boardwalk fries, but on crack&steroids. Yes, its THAT overpowering. The appearance was that of malt vinegar. I could barely get over the disgusting smell before I took a swig. After I swallowed it, the fumes were just too much&it came right back out. I don't mean to bash this product, this is just my firsthand experience when I drank it. Judging by the bottle itself, I'm assuming this is the Russian equivalent to a 40 oz of malt liquor here in the States. To wrap this up, if you wanna say ""I drank a Russian 40"" and are feeling frisky, by all means try it. If not, its no loss. Just an oddity more or less."
"Baltika # 9 had the taste of malt vinegar. A real strong taste real bitter. The color was a dark brown. Mouth Feel was the same as the taste. I was not impressed with this brew. I will not be buying this brew any more. This had to be the roughest brew I ever had. If you like your brew with a ton of malt this is for you. I is not for me overall I give it a 2."
"The nose is very pleasant. A warm, nutty overture with grassy textures. Complex but not overpowering. The appearance in the glass is very nice. A darker, richer, yellow colour with well adjusted head. Not a large head, but thick, creamy and firm. The taste is at first a fruity, earthy combination of sour and tart. Very mild and tender though, with a slight sweetness reminiscent of honey for a nice balance. As it travels over the tongue it becomes milder, feeling almost watery with a slight grassy, tart flavour as if it were tea. The finish is bold but now overpowering. Nutty, sweet and savory with the honey backing it. The flavours don't necessarily harmonize but do compliment one another well. This a well adjusted, flavorful lager. Though not the cream of the crop in terms of flavour and texture it does deserve respect and a solid 3.5."

"It's actually crisp and for all the alcohol and the fairly light body, it's not too thin and fairly smooth, not perfectly clean but more than expected. It fights the fusel slickness by giving slight powdery dryness into the finish."
""
"Notes: This is proof that ""fizzy yellow beers"" from pretty much anywhere else in the world are at least decent. This is not bad beer, it's an example of cheap international beer."
"Overall: This is not your light lager. It starts slightly sweet. The alcohol comes out toward the finish. Place this beer in the freezer and serve very cold. With its high percent ABV, you don't have worry about it freezing"

"Decent beer overall. If I were in Russia and this was cheap, I would buy it more often. But otherwise, you can get better beers for the money."

"50 cl. bottle procured in that quaint (in the same way as all of these kinds of stores are) Russian/East-European store behind the library. Brown bottle was a bit odd considering the colour of the others when this one didn’t pour all too dark. Also don’t really see much if any Russian on.the label – it is hard to read the text – is this meant for export or? Bottled on 29.11.2012. Pours a bright, ligher shade darker golden with little synthetic head. Smells of malt and caramel syrup and additives cover a light, cheap industrial vodka-style alcohol coming through, pure cheap alcohol, citrus and cheap malts. Taste is sweet malty syrup / caramel additives attempting to cover an industrial strength lager, cheap alcohol is all over the place here, medicinal style, cleaning agent, dark sugar, cheap malts, highly processed grains, solvent, citrus. Light with a touch of syrup here. This is some serious industrial swill they tried masking here, harsh bro."

"There's not many beers I won't finish, but I had to toss this one."
"This is easily the worst beer I have had in decades/"
""
""
""
"Pours to a creamy white head that leaves bits of foam behind. Color is pale gold. Aroma is grainy adjuncts and alcohol. Flavor is clean, crisp and totally grainy and alcoholic. ""is there vodka in there?"" my wife asks. Might as well be, the EtOH afterburner on this shit is very strong and goes straight to your brain. Mouthfeel is slick, tingly and light. Easy to quaff and gets you drunk fast. If only American HG malt liquors were this smooth and slammable."

"Poured into a pint glass"

"Overall- Below average to almost poor. I really wouldn't recommend it and certainly will not be repurchasing this beer."
""
""
""
""
"How can I have extra when I haven't had any to begin with? Dammit, Smalls... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear golden-straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises sweet corn, light flowers, light grass, very light white bread, and hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, with a vague sweetness hanging pall-like over the proceedings. The body is a rather lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a slick feel, and a drying finish. Overall, I think of this stuff as a Russian version of an approachable malt liquor, like an Earthquake. It's boring, it'll get ya drunk. 'Nuff said."

"O- well what can I say, first beer in 9 months and it has to be one of the worst beers I've ever had, if not the worst. Metallic aftertaste that lingers. This is a beer that I will never drink again."
"Avoid the large plastic bottles as they skunk easily -- sort of the Russian equivalent of Colt 45. The cans and 12 oz bottles are drinkable but not something I would seek out. Might be a decent pour if available on tap, but that's highly unlikely outside Mother Country (and taps are unlikely in Mother Country, period). Better beer available for the price in the same style, but few approach the alcohol content (other than Baltic regional brews)."

"Overall though not bad for what it is I guess, not having any problem drinking it that's for sure surprisingly."
""
""
"Right at the front it did not feel right to me. Too sweet with a non-harmonic booze giving a low drinkability, especially for a 500 ml bottle. I seemed that it would never finish."
"Had this one at a fair in Yerevan, Armenia. It was about $2.50 and I was just looking for something that packed some high alcohol content. The smell was pretty off-putting, it smelled almost like someone just dumped some hard liquor into a non-alcoholic beer. The taste pretty much followed the nose. Can't speak for the appearance as I had it in a bottle and I don't know enough Russian to ask for a cup. I don't think I'd ever drink this again unless I'm really in a beer drinking bind somewhere in the ex-Soviet Union again."
""
"I just take the loss, full responsibility, I need a BMC to bring my taste buds back."
""
"From that point of view, it's not that bad. If I were down on my luck and needed cheap booze, I would pick Number 9 before a 40 ounce of malt liquor any day."
""
"Medium to full bodied and overly carbonated. Not much to say about this beer other than it sucks. Definitely recommend avoiding this train wreck."
"Nice sweetness in a strong lager. It looks and acts a little weak on the pour. There is no huge billowy head or lacing. The aroma is nice but I enjoyed drinking this beer immensely with my meal. It went down very good with some Russian Jazz by the Ganelin Trio Poco a Poco playing in the background. This is a must try beer in my book. Good sweet stuff."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice import malt liquor, packs a good punch, one of my go to beers for if I want to get drunk. Could be dangerous due to the relatively light mouth feel and 8.0% ABV. I enjoy the bite very much though."
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Never."
""
""
""
""
"The appearance is yellowish gold with very little head. Next the smell, slightly fruity and grainy with hints of caramel, and almost a smokey leather with the alcohol coming through in force! The taste is strong with notes of a porter. Again the alcohol comes through as a major player. The finish is rather fast with only a slight linger on the tongue. Fairly smooth texture. Overall this beer reminds me of a cold Russian winter night. When the only thing on ones mind is staying warm and enjoying the company of ballerinas and comrades past."
"Overall, as far as beer goes, it is not that great. But if you want a quick buzz on the cheap it is not half bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with a slightly fruity flavor on the finish. There is an alcohol kick and a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a poor beer that is strong and pretty much undrinkable."
""

"Overall - Very malt liquor like, only with a much better flavor. The bright honey character is simple, but effective. All in all, not a bad beer. Would I ever buy it again? Eh, maybe... but probably not."
""
"O-Expected much better,but this time i got not so good beer."
""
"O-okay, this isn't terrible. Reviews make it seem like its going to be undrinkable, but it's really okay. It definitely doesn't go down too easily. It's a cheap beer, and it's okay considering. It has a certain taste to it that makes it fairly interesting "
""
"Overall, not a good beer. It is pretty hard for me to choke down and definitely not something I would buy again."
""
""
""
""
"With a high ABV it gets the job done. Nothing else to see here folks."
""
"Taste sadly is not to the same standard as every other euro strong I've had. It's quite sweet as it should be, but it's quite lacking in flavour of higher alcohols. I can hardly detect any at all. It's as if there may not even be any present. Apparently, they didn't rush the brew on this one. There is also some cheap hops to balance, giving it sort of a pilsner-like taste. There's fruity, yeastiness present too. It's not as clean as other euro strongs. Tastes less like a chemistry project and more like a beer. This would probably be top notch to a beer snob within this particular category. However, I like that higher alcohol taste and am sad to see it lacking in this beer. However, it's still a decent lager and unique from anything else you can buy in America, so I will probably be getting it again. I'm very glad someone decided to import this and I think I'll look into some of Baltika's other beers as well."
""
""
"Got me good and buzzed, but I want my beer to taste like beer."
"I recommend the number 7 over this one. The only real reason to pick it up is to review the style."
""
"O= This beer is unique to say the least. Well worth trying for the comical bottle type and worth trying again if you wanna get fucked up. It was cheap, came in a large bottle, and high in alcohol. Everything you could want in a Russian Lager."
"Not too bad. Very sweet and the alcohol wasn't that noticeable. Good mouthfeel as well."
"Served in a branded pilsner glass, poured like apple juice. It was a very sweet and heavy beer for the colour. Heavily malty finish, reminiscent of a quad style, almost chewy in effect. Light sweet citrus and pear on the tongue. Low carbonation, and very full body."
""
""
"O: Not easy to drink, sessionable, or very enjoyable. I could best describe this one as apple juice that has spoiled (really badly) with grain alcohol added to it. Alcohol is far too present in this beer. I will not be getting another of these."
"O: I’m glad I found this beer in a tall boy can because it was much easier to drink compared to a large plastic soda bottle of this. The drinkability isn’t that good due to the alcohol in the finish."
"Out of a bomber bottle this beer was a slightly hazy golden color with one finger of off-white head. The retention was not bad and it left spots of lacing throughout my sample. The aroma was of macro grains, booze, a little metal, crystal malt and some bread. The flavors were actually not bad, given how strong this beer was. I tasted the cereal grains first and foremost but behind that was a more subtle note of pilsner malt and bread. However, these distinctions did have to be made by ignoring the undeniable punch of booze that left no doubt this was a Euro Strong Lager. My Russian gf used to get hammered drinking this with her friends when she was younger and I can see how that easily could have gone down. I actually didn’t mind the flavors, including the punch, but I’m sure many would not be impressed. The mouthfeel however was nice, the body medium and the carbonation light. A big Russian beer and not for the faint of heart (or palate)."
""
"500ml bottle.Pokal glass.Enjoyed on mar´12.Golden color.Off white, close, crown.Retention is good.Mildy malty aromas, craspberrie & honey notes. Floral touches.Sweet malty upfront. Fruity tea-like flavor too.Slightly dry bitter in the middle with some apple skin astringency. Light body, medium-high carbonation.ABV well hidden as esters masking hoppiness results in a very pleasant drinkability.Fruty malty finish. Suggested pairing: salty grilled T-bone steaks."

"Overall: I eventually noticed that each mouthful was getting progressively smaller till they became teensy pained sips. That’s when I decided to call it quits with Baltika 9 and swap to a tall glass of water."
""
""
"Overall - If I wanted to drink malt liquor, I would've bought a 40 of Mickey's for $1.89, not $2.99 for what I paid for this. In fact, I actually PREFER Mickey's over this. It's got too much of an unbalanced & alcoholic flavor and it just feels unpleasant on the palette, so stay away from this!"
""
""
""
"O: This is just a basic boring lager. I am not a huge fan of lagers, but I have had much better lagers."
""
"O- This is not a good beer."
"500 ml bottle, label says production date of 24.04.11, best before 24.04.12. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear golden color with about an inch white head. Head retention is decent, and there's a small amount of lacing. The brew smells like corn/grain, sweet malt and some alcohol. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma. There's a strong corny/grainy sweetness, with some alcohol noticeable too. The sweetness was a little much after a while. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with a good amount of carbonation. Well, this beer isn't awful, but it's not exactly good either. I guess it's close enough to average overall, maybe a little below."
"Overall: Since this is a euro equivalent of a malt liquor, it holds to style. Nothing great here."
""
""
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a small white head. In the aroma, small alcohol notes and very faint fruitiness. In the taste, same as the smell, small alcohol burn and a small fruitiness. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry candy sugar like aftertaste. A big lager, a bit dry and a small alcohol presence all the way through."
""
""
"Gotta be good for that Russian winter."
"Pours light yellow. Crystal clear, nose is werther's, grain and something else that doesn't seem right. Taste is okay, nothing too off putting, sweet caramel malts. Doesn't actually taste that much like a lager, more like a high gravity ale. The 8% tastes more like 13%, not great not good, price is right and better than most high grav swill."
""
"o - Overall just a bad beer. Overcarbonated, doesn't look very good, and the taste is pretty bad; couldn't finish the botte. The nose isn't too bad but based on everything else, I wouldn't buy this one again."
""
""
""
"I bought this because I don't think I've reviewed a beer from Russia. So I guess this did what I wanted it to do."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - very interesting brew. I'd not tried anything quite like it before and enjoyed the experience."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Appearance has a golden amber color with a fair head dissipating leaving nill lace. Smell of young wine not matured, malt, adjunct grain and alchohol. Taste is grainy, alchohol, darker fruit notes having mild hop flavor. Mouthfeel is light/medium with good carbonation. You can taste the alchohol, but it doesn't take over like in some strong American lagers."
"Baltika #9, or grade 9 rather, is an extra lager. It would seem that that extra means extra alcohol in this case. This brew seems stronger than the 8% ABV written on the bottle. The lagerish dark yellow color belies its strength. The aroma and flavor do nothing to hide it, though. Those sweet malty grains morph into a biting alcohol presence which dominates. The heaviness in the flavor makes it hard to finish the entire the half-liter bottle. There is a distilled spirit quality to this thing even though it has no spirit. Out of vodka? Go for the Baltika #9, Extra Lager."
"The cpj"
"O: Not too bad actually. Not something I am stocking my fridge with, but better than I expected it to be."
"O: If you like beer mixed with whiskey, give this a shot. Otherwise, just go have a lot more fun doing shots."
"Drink- It was still a lager but not too too bad but could've been better. I don’t know its just my evolution but I don’t think I am a lager fan."
"Pours a light yellow color w/ a big three finger white head. Decent carbonation and big time lacing. Very clear and easy to see through. The nose of this beer is not impressive at all. I get grain, malt, and some alcohol. That's really about it. Not something I particularly want to drink after smelling it. Well, here goes nothing. Taste is that of ethanol, grain, and malt. Truly disgusting, and that's being diplomatic. This tastes like malt liquor to me. Not really a fan of that. Feel is super thin, w/o much going on at all. Overall, this is a fairly disappointing beer- I thought this would be much better. Oh well, you win some, you lose some. Not recommended, and I will not seek this out again."
"I don't know if my sample was a bit old or mistreated or what but my first taste impression was of horseshit. Seriously. Like when you step into a horse stall in moist weather with a fresh, uh, load on the floor. How that smell has a hint of a taste to it... Yes, I was just as surprised as you probably are. Lightstruck? Whatever, it was thankfully limited to the first hit. The rest is what you would expect from a beer in this line with an ABV like this. A bit sweet, a bit thick feeling, a bit heavy on the palate. Good but not great. Probably won't try it again."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"Some people I know really dig this stuff - I am on the fence about it. It is decent, but it is still just a pale lager with not all that much going for it. Relative to Butt- I mean Bud-weiser, it has more sweet malt, more hop bitterness, and more alcohol. Mouthfeel is a little more lively. All good things, but still just average."
"I think the balance in this one is a little off. There's not enough malt character to mask all the alcohol, and it's a little too sweet for me."
"I've been in Russia for 3 months now, and have had this beer A LOT since being here, mainly, because it's cheap and not much else is offered. The appearence is rather bland, lots of carbonation, foam head disappears in seconds, golden-pale yellow in color. The smell is mostly booze, some corn and wood notes in the nose. First sip your mouth is taken over by booze. You really taste the 8% in this beer. The flavor is very grainy, not too much else. For the price you pay for it, it's not too bad."
"Pour starts out with a head, then it disappears *completely.* Looks lite-golden, very clear, and innocent. Smell is heavy white sugar and green apple, kinda like my first batch of Mr. Beer - on 'roids. Also, a rather pleasant, toasty malt scent. But then some rubbing alcohol has to come spoil the party. Taste is a lot of phenols and bitterness. A good deal of those malts, but with bitter-beer face to follow. Possibly alcohol-face as well. Finishes strong, like a punch to the liver. A sickeningly sweet aftertaste that you just have to wash down with more Baltika #9. Speaking of, will this pass Magic Hat in the beer lexicon popularity of said number? I doubt it. And I don't think there's any damn way I can finish this behemoth mutant of a bottle on my own.."
"The beer is medium bodied and over-carbonated with a very dry and warming finish. This beer was way too boozy, that is all."
"The smell is horrid. It smells of the kind of plastic that action figures are made of. You also get some corn and Saaz hops (I think, it's hard to tell). I certainly hope this tastes better than it smells. It doesn't...if at all possible it tastes worse. Take the above and add rubbing alcohol (or acetone) and you'll get the taste. The mouthfeel is even bad...oily with a chemical astringency tearing at the back of your throat. I cannot finish this...it may be only the second or third beer ever that I've poured. I fear that if I do finish this that it will be a sign of alcoholism and that I'll be standing up in the backroom of a church introducing myself. No thank you."
"O: Definitely not on my recommended list. However, if you want to get wasted quickly, this will get you there."
"Cheers..."
"Round two of the Russian lager Sunday afternoon. Luckily this one is not out of code, expires 9/2011. Pours a deep straw color that borders on golden with a bubbly white head that dissipates almost instantly. Smells of sweet grainy malt with hints of corn drenched in vodka. The alcohol nose on this is quite harsh. Hints of apricot and apple in the nose as well. Taste is sweet with grainy bready malts. The same fruits in the nose make their way into the taste, but are drenched in higher alcohols. Tastes like someone literally took a malt liquor and added some vodka to it. Medium to light body, crisp carbonation, sweet sticky mouthfeel. Not my favorite lager by a long stretch. Harsh and alcoholic this is one and done for this guy."
"The Crack & Glug created a finger of foamy, bone-white head with low retention. It was falling as fast as I could type and was soon just a memory. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and next to me, King Midas began to drool in envy. Nose smelled like it had been made in Monroe, WI, not St. Petersburg, Russian Federation. This had Minhas-stink all over it, from the bubble gum sweetness to the plastics factory interior and even a little gasoline thrown in for good measure. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was Russian for ""Cyberman"". Oh, kill me now! It was the all-too-familiar taste of overworked yeast, adjuncts and fusel alcohol. It pains me that one of the primary tenents of The CANQuest (TM) states that ""In order to qualify for inclusion, the entirety of the CAN's CANtents MUST be CANsumed. If a drain pour occurs, the quester MUST open a new CAN and drink its CANtents."" I really hate whoever wrote these rules ... Finish was gaspingly dry and I was looking around to make sure that there were no open flames in the house. This is dangerous beer, to say the least. I generally like Baltika's beers and they evoke a sense of nostalgia for me, from when the late owner of the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern, Stosh, and I would drink Baltika # 8 like it was going out of style. # 9 needs to go out of production!"
"Well at least it was cheap. This pours a light yellow color with a white head which seemed to quickly go away. The smell isn't anything special, maybe a little sugary, no detectable hops. The mouthfeel is thin with a little carbonation. The taste is terrible, I tried a sample first at the store and i don't remember it being this bad, (in all fairness I tried it right after a sample of Arrogant Bastard so the bitterness of that one much have hid the sweetness of this one). Its sweet malty, corn sugary, zero bitterness to balance it out, yeah this isn't my type of drink. Heck, I'd rather be drink Pabts instead of this if I want a cheap buzz. Not at all my type of beer, but I'm sure it gets the job done, I was told it sells pretty well. I won't be buying again and the second half of the bottle is going down the drain."
"Overall: don’t want to spend more words on this one"
"O - Drain-pour to the max. This beer only has two places in the world; 1) a greasy, popped-collar frat boy's embracing clutches and/or 2) a greasy bum."
"O: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style which is not much of a compliment, flat out just not a good beer."
"Not a great beer. If you're after getting drunk fast, try a shot of vodka before a beer of some other sort."
"до свидания, товарищ"
"O: I did actually like this beer, but it's hard to say why. It's nice and smooth, but the qualities that I like in a great beer just weren't there. The 3.5 for overall is sort of a ""correction"" for the way I feel about this one."
"(D)- Again, its like drinking an alcohol driven, dry sugar water. Almost flavorless and downright almost undrinkable for me."
"Alright beer, nothing unique or special. Enjoyable enough for the time, and I would be willing to try one of the other #'s. But I won't be coming back for another."
"O: Yep pretty much where I expected it to be. Harsh and nasty. It is what it is though. Style TICK."
"Mouthfeel: Thin and light with medium carbonation."
"D: Jesus Christ."
"I'd drink it again based off the price in the US versus the overall quality. It's good, but it's not crazy good."
"Pours yellow with a fully receding white head. Aroma of exudes the sweetness, sweet bready grains, sweet musky lager aroma. Taste is no different, sweetness, a bit harsh, but the alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel is full bodied and sticky with lively carbonation. Not impressive, but not terrible."
"Final Notes: This beer would be a lot better if it had at least some hops to balance it out. As it is, all you taste is sweet, and I'm not digging that."
"Overall: It's an excellent strong ale. It's not perfect, but no beer is. There are better ales out there, but for the price, I really can't complain at all. 4.5/5"
"The 8% alcohol shows up in the flavor almost immediately with a veggie-rich ethanol note that's both sweet and slightly abrasive. Harsh fusels linger into the finish, blowing past creamed corn and floral hop notes mid-palate. Aside from the booziness, the mouthfeel is actually quite agreeable with its peppery carbonation level and medium-thin body. I'd probably pick up Baltika #9 over most others in the Euro Strong Lager style, but then again, that's not saying a whole lot."
"D: I didn't dislike the beer, per se, but I'm in no hurry to have it again."
"wrote ""average"" for appearance and smell because i drank it straight out of the (dark tinted) bottle, so i hardly saw it, and my nose is stuffed. what little i saw through the bottle, i couldn't tell what color the beer was, but it laced the bottle decently when i opened it. drinkability is, like you'd expect from a high abv beer, not as easy as your typical pale lager, but i got it down easily enough. taste was interesting, it started out strong and finished tasting more like a fruity wine. i liked it, and i'd be happy to have it again, but next time i'll have it with a sit-down meal."
"I have never tasted beer like this. Kinda flowery or perfume-laden. Just not right for me. Very pale yellow and clear. One sip was enough for me."
"Tastes like grain, grass, alcohol is not hidden. Finishes like sweet corn. The lingering aftertaste is sweet corn. Not good overall. corn, sweet, and alcohol? Really?"
"Drinkability is just average. Average taste and high abv keeps this from being a good lawnmower beer or session beer. Worth trying once."
"D: high alcohol warmth, might be nice on a cold night in Russia. Only tried it because very common in this part of Chicago, large Russian population. It's ok, but don't go looking for it."
"Drinkability is really high. This beer has a good flavor, but it leaves a light touch, which just puts the glass right back into my hand. :)"
"Honestly having a little trouble making it go down. I did get sick on Baltika years ago, I'm wondering if I'm having a Pavlovian response to it. Not a bad beer. I think I paid 2 dollars for this ""1 Pint .9FL. OZ."" bottle. Worth a try."
"A surprisingly decent beer. Was kind of expecting quite a bit less, so this is a pleasant surprise, especially considering the low price. Drinks quite well, especially for a beer at eight percent. I don't know that I would have it again, but it's not one that I would say I definitely wouldn't either."
"Baltika #9 Extra has a unimpressive yellow colour and a decent head that subsides into good lacing. The smell is of honey and some piney hops. Like a tree. The taste is very interesting and mostly of honey and piney hops. The alcohol is noticable at the end. In the mouth it is medium bodied. This is a very nice beer."
"Poured a darkish gold w/ well-carb'd but quickly dying head on top of a grainy, veggie-like hops smell w/ hints of citric and sweet malts. Taste is a bit strange as it mixes that sour hoppiness/pils taste along w/ a touch of sticky sweet malt. Light-bodied and mostly bitter and w/ a dry finish, the sweet tastes make it interesting and not too bad to drink. ABC is well-hidden b/c I didn't think it was even close to 8%."
"A pleasant surprise!"
"D: This could certainly be worse. I didn't care for the boozy influence and ricola cough drop similarities."
"It's not so much cloudy as it is just a little off. It's has a real clarity to it. A very translucent watery yellow color. The thin pure white head doesn't hang out at all. Just a little bitter and sour notes are present on the nose. The taste is bitter and tart followed by a sour and skunky taste. If the other taste I get are hops then I've never had a beer with those hops before. A real earthy grain and grit linger in every corner of my mouth. Something just seems a bit off."
"A few of these would probably be welcome after skiing in the Urals."
"Drinkability- Goes great with burgers. That's all I can say. Poundable, not pleasurable."
"Tried to get this down, but only got 1/3 way in. Might be alright if fresh. But it's a medicinal malt liquor all the same."
"I poured into a pint glass to two inches of white head. It is yellow in color. The aroma is sweet and grainy. The taste is sweet and boozy. This beer kind of reminds me of malt liquor. It is really not a good beer. The only redeeming quality is the 8% ABV."
"overall this was an interesting one, definitely different and hard to put my finger on the full profile, i would actually say this may be worth a try."
"The beer pours a clear straw yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grassy, bready malt and a lot of grain. The flavor is grass, grain, sweet malt and alcohol. The sweetness is the predominant flavor component. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not a great beer, but for the style, it is not bad."
"Drinkability: it is drinkable, but I'm not going to seek it out. I can see a rough night (not to mention following morning) on the streets of Moscow starting out with one or two of these. Nazdrovia!"
"I poured this beer into a Sam Smith nonic. The appearance was a pleasant golden color, though the lacing and head kinda were subpar (ie: fizzy). There wasn't much to the smell, except some booziness, and the taste was basically maple syrup and booziness. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and its not something I'd consume on a daily basis."
"Clear pale yellow brew gives a good thick and stable layer of sticky off-white foam that leaves thick lacing on the glass. Smell is moderately malty, a bit sweet. Straw, grass, silage, raw starchy grains, a little lemon and maybe some floral notes. A unique and appealing nose, like standing in a hay field. On the tongue it has a fake syrupy sweetness and a bit of alcohol burn that mostly covers up anything else. Feel is moderate, sweet on the tongue but fades to a dry finish. Easily drinkable but not particularly tasty."
"Taste/mouthfeel/drinkability: OK, this is pretty much the end of this one -- it literally tastes like perfume and hay... I couldn't keep this in my mouth. I'd continue on to talk about the mouthfeel, but the taste was so bad I couldn't keep it in long enough to make any strong determinations about this. Based upon everything else about this beer, the drinkability is awful. I never want to be near this drink again."
"I only got through about a quarter of this bottle, which has never happened before."
"Pale straw yellow color with just a hint of haze. What little white head my aggressive pour yielded quickly faded into nothing. The smell is overtly sweet with grain and a touch of honey. There's also a slight metallic note. The taste is just short of awful. This must be the Russian equivalent of Laser. It's terribly sweet with no hops note and truly no redeeming qualities about it. One of my generous gulps actually had me thinking it might come right back up. No way I will ever have this one again."
"Drinkiability: This beer is actually a bit more complex than I expected- very much like a champagne in both taste and mouthfeel. Also, its low price is a huge plus, and makes this one worth a taste."
"I actually found it easy to drink, I must have a sweeter tooth than I thought. There was very little about the beer, depth or flavour wise, just too sweet for normal people."
"This was a bigger bottle, and while it wasn't a struggle to get down, I sipped it because I was only half-digging it. I know alot of this is the style, but this just doesn't offer much in unique flavor. Existing flavors are appropriate in strength, but just very uninspiring. This was kinda ok. Didn't hate it, but won't chase this again."
"As far as drinkability goes, this tastes like cardboard and glue... if I was drinking this again I would want it to come in either a 40 or be higher in alcohol because this is for peasants to get drunk off of."
"D: I feel that somehow someone has dropped a few sugar cubes in each bottle. I guess things are not all that bad as it does go down the hatch, as my knees get weaker. I find myself making the occasional unpleasant beer face...a bit rough and shall never grace my fridge walls again"
"The body was thin and, after the smell and taste, expectedly sticky. Drinkability wasn't bad, but I didn't enjoy this beer as I drank it. This is not a bad beer, just very different from what most of us are used to, I suspect. I got a 16.9oz bottle for about $2.50, so giving this brew a shot ain't gonna break ya, might as well give it pop."
"Notes: The beer does not look like an 8% beer, nor does it drink like one. You can just barely tell in the aroma, and you can definitely tell in the taste. It is sweet, but feels a little heavy on the alcohol side. Not a bad beer, and it definitely drinks like a lower alcohol beer. It is pretty much just a typical lager but stronger, however, there aren't many faults here."
"Although this might not quite be a balanced or complex brew, it's definitely drinkable, even despite the 8% alcohol by volume, so be cautious with this Russian beer."
"D: I'm not sure why this beer got a bad rap on this page; I actually enjoyed it quite much."
"D: I had low expectations for this beer as I figured this one would just be one to get drunk off of. Surprisingly it didn't suck nearly as much as I was expecting and was actually quite respectable. Not something I would drink on a regular basis, but if they could ferment out some more of the sweetness and add a bit more hop character to it, it would be a very good beer."
"Hmmm...this is way better tasting than I expected. It is sweet (kind of) and has some fruitiness to it. Beer is medium bodied and finishes nicely with almost no aftertaste. Drinkability high. Second taste, slightly bitter this time. This beer is really good. Very enjoyable."
"This is a beer that completely surprised me. I thought it was going to completely suck but it actually turned out to be very delightful. I loved the sweetness of it. It almost seemed like a mead. This is a beer that you can drink endlessly on a warm summer day. I loved it and will continue to buy it when ever I can."
"D- Too much cornfeed flavors and booziness for my liking. Not a drain pour quite yet (I'm halfway through the bottle), but I'll be surprised if I finish this bottle..."
"Drinkability: It does taste like a high alcohol Euro light beer or Budweiser. The taste I find a bit too sweet and alcoholic. I think I am fine with the first pour into my pint glass but have no desire to finish the whole bottle."
"this was my first Russian beer and i hope there are some otherr beers out there from Russia that aren't so ...blah."
"Drinkability: Not very tasty. I paired it with pizza for 3 minutes. Drain pour for me, but its a much better version of an amped up budweiser."
"A pretty pour for sure, but is there any substance? No, not really. A mild grain alcohol scent awaits beneath the frothy cap of foam. The notes alluded to in the nose show up in the taste as well, leaving something to be desired. Not a bad beer, but I've seen cheaper malt liquors that taste just as good if not better."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: Thick bodied, with low carbonation. Oily mouthfeel. One bottle is enough for me due to the high ABV%."
"D: Not a bad malt liquor type beer, certainly better than a lot of the American ones that I have had. Good price as all the Baltika beers have."
"Drank this out of the 51 oz bottle it came in. 51 oz is an interesting amount to come in. Smells sweet somewhat like a malt liquor. Taste is very similar to a malt liquor. Sickeningly sweet, somewhat malty. I've had friends who weren't BA's describe it as budweiser as a malt liquor. Not sure if I'll finish this 51 oz'er."
"Needs a rich dessert or butter/cream sauce."
"Got this again because I thought I hadn't had it before... oddly this one smells a bit rubbery and doesn't taste that great. Very tart, almost bittersweet with alcohol definitely present. Not sure if I got a bad bottle or I was smoking something during my other review, but it definitely isn't hitting the spot."
"This beer reminds me more of a malt liquour then a beer. It pours out a nice golden color with some good head and retention. Smells mostly of grass and malts. Not overly pleasant tasting, but there is a certain almost charming sweetness to go with the vegital flavors. Mouthfeel and Drinkability are good, not great. I was expecting better after trying the #6..."
"Smell is strong alcohol and sweetness... Strange beer and reminds me of a weaker Grand 95."
"Another one from overseas that is quite different but still good in its own right. Clocking in a 8% this beer has alot of clout to it, but I would gladly drink it again sometime."
"Drinkability - While you really can't go wrong with a Baltika, I do prefer #4 over this one."
"Drinkability on this one is fairly high. However it is too sweet for me to call a session beer. It falls short of Baltika 7 and 8 for me and can probably be lumped in with Baltika's Porter offering. If you're a sweet beer person, you might be able to do more of this than me."
"ive loved this beer since the first time i tried it. very affordable and it gets the job done. fairly full flavored also."
"Crystal clear gold colour with a thick, bright white cap that fell over the course of a few minutes. Sticky lace. Floral, sulfury hops with a little fruitiness in the nose, sweet malts. Low bitterness, quite sweet with a little bit of spicy alcohol in the finish. Slightly fruity with mild hop flavour. Not very well balanced. Alcohol was well hidden. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Fair, but not something I'll go back to. I like others in the Baltika line much better."
"Poured a crystal clear, straw color with a modest head that quickly dissipated to a skin. The aroma was a little musty. The taste was very sweet, too sweet in fact, for my taste. Mouth feel was light bodied with mild carbonation. Drinkability was good, but the syrupy sweetness will turn some off. Overall, the definition of average."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit malty, slightly sweet. Taste is mainly of alcohol, some hints of corn. Feels light in the mouth. Definatly not a beer I could spend the evening drinking. Overall this is a mediocre effort."
"Very odd and sadly mediocre."
"Poured from a 0.5 liter bottle into a pilsener glass revealed a light colored brew with little head and carbonation. Smell, taste and mouthfeel were as expected for a regular lager. However, there was an excessive sweetness that was not pleasing. One of the ingredients is maltose syrup. Maybe that accounts for the sweetness. Other than that, this is a good beer and held up well on the shelf -- the production date was ll months before I bought it for $2.99 in a grocery store. It may be cheaper if bought in a liquor store. I would recommend it to anyone who likes sweet beer, but I don't have any friends in that category. Even my daughter turned her nose up on this one."
"Feel guilty for drinking this one. Like I should be down on the corner mooching smokey treats and coins. This poured with a medium to small white head and a little lace. Aroma was fairly mild and a little beery. Flavor is massively sweet and just a hint of beer and I guess malt. Lots of booze. Finish is a little like circus peanuts. And I wish, more forgettable."
"Ehh. It's okay."
"Taste: The alcohol taste is there but not as bad as in the smell, but still more then should be there. The rest is a slight corn taste that leads into what almost seems like a sweetness that fades quickly."
"medium mouthfeel that plays off as crispy and clean."
"This beer poured a light pale yellow with a big three-finger head that settled quickly and a ton of visible carbonation. The smell is mostly malt with a bit of alcohol and just a touch of floral hops. The taste starts off with some malt that reminds me very much of an American Malt Liquor, possibly some corn malt that gives way to some big alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a ton of carbonation visible all the way through drinking the glass. Not an entirely unpleasant beer to drink, I just couldn't shake the feeling that I was drinking a Hurricane."
"Atmosphere is pretty decent. Really solid appearance (except maybe a little too much carbonation. Nose is not all that prominent, and pretty typical of this style. Flavor is not my favorite. Has a strange palette, and unusually strong whiskey-like taste. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
"Drinkability- For the price, I think this is a pretty excellent lager. Vastly better than any macro, and actually a bit cheaper. High abv should be a downside... unless that's what you're looking for."
"Not awful, and actually better than a lot of more popular imported lagers. In a weird kind of way, I'd recommend it."
"Flavors of ""rusty"" banana and ""rusty"" oranges. Orange soda flavors, character and body. Short all around and a bit thin. A sweet pine resin finish; also short. Conclusion: soda pop character all around."
"Drinkability - a little too strong for my taste. This is very Euro-Lager. I probably won't try this beer again. But it is an OK beer."
"D - Easy to drink, especially at the ABV."
"drinkability - not good since i dont like malt euro"
"500ml bottle. Pours a completely clear pale gold with a towering white head. Nice pillowy consistency. Smells faintly of pilsener malt. Sweet and grassy and quite straightforward. Taste is quite sugary sweet and a bit metallic. Little malt or hop character; akin to simple syrup. Feel is light and carbonation is too low. Bland, characterless, and unenjoyable. At least it masks the alcohol well."
"The foam was very light wheat/white in color, somewhat puffy foam and dissapated a little quickly. The color was a light honey pils. The smell was that of a typical lager with a hops overtone. It had a deep lager taste with a bit more hops. Mouthfeel - med-bodied with a rich thickness. Drinkability - it would be alright except for the very heavy feel."
"Great pour, classic lager color with a perfect 3 finger head. Looks delicious. Able to pick up a good amount of hops with a deep wiff, otherwise standard. Extra super smooth. Actually masking the crispness I come to expect from a lager with how smooth it is. Really exceptional. All that smoothness feels mildly heavy on the pallet. Very easy to drink, would definitely recommend it as a very good strong lager."
"The taste is good at first with strong raisiny alcohol/sweet wine with burnt fruit hint, grain, and a nice, full, oily feel. It is sweet but with light bitternmess, tasty, and very drinkable. However, it steadily degrades, becoming rougher, more sharply alcoholic and with a medicinal aftertaste. Its' stll pretty good, though. Overall, it's a lot like a good American malt liquor."
"Overall - I drank a lot of this overseas in 2003 and remember it to be smooth for the ABV it contains. I will not dispute that now. Since that time the only #9 I have had was from a mail order retailer and it was not good. I was happy to find this relatively locally and fresh."
"Interesting enough for anyone to try once. A must for malt liquor fans or frat boys looking to class things up a bit."
"D: This is a malt liquor...if you consider it in those terms, it's fine. Any other way, this has serious issues. Rough, adjuncty, blatantly boozy. It's like a half-shot of bad vodka dropped into a High Life. That should speak for itself."
"Doesnt finish well. The mouthfeel pushes for a lager consistency, but doesnt achieve it."
"Final thoughts - Overall the beer has some redeeming qualities. For being a beer found in a plastic bottle (51 oz. for $2.38) Baltika strong lager is not that bad. It was definitely a great beer to have with friends over. You can pour 4 solid beers, and let them sample a beer that might not usually try. Recommended for a sampling, but definitely not a regular choice for me."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer feels heavier on the palate than it should with a lot of residual sugars left over in the brew. The beer has a very clean finish. Carbonation is high, which nicely offsets the heavy and sugary body of the brew. This is one that I'm sure I'll not readily go back to, yet I can see myself drinking it again if I want to get messed up for cheap. Not the greatest beer, but for the buy...I mean if you want to get fucked up, how many other brews are there that you can get 51oz of for $4-5? Drinkability is pretty low, but I do think that they did a good job with the mouthfeel, sure its heavier, way heavier than it should be. Too much sugar, but still the idea to give it some high carbonation was smart. It makes it easier to drink."
"Pours a very pale yellow colored body, with a small white head, very quickly diminishing. Grapey, malty aroma. Effervescent. Grainy smelling. Grainy malty taste, somewhat watery. A little hot. Very malty tasting. Flavorful."
"poured from a 16.9 oz bottle a nice clear golden color, short white head that did hold for a while with a spotty power like lace. fresh corn husk, malt grain and floral nose although slightly weak. has a nice taste to it sweet malt grain, just a hint of spice and dry finish. beats a bud hands down would be a easy session beer."
"Clear, golden yellow appearance with no real head or lacing. Aromas were incredibly faint. What could be sensed were almost burnt floral hints. The taste had a really off aftertaste. Unbalance combination of malts and what does taste like a vodka finish. Mouthfeel does help this drink with a relatively crisp, good body. Overall, really bad taste to a below average looking beer."
"Had this at Whistle Binkies, just because. Best before date of 4-20-09. Pours a crystal clear golden color with a decent white head that fell quickly leaving behind some light lacing. Aroma is very sweet and grainy with no trace of hops. Taste is very sweet for a lager. The flavor bounces back and forth between table sugar and green apples with hints of grainy malts mixed in. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the 8% ABV could barely be detected under the sweetness. One of these was more than enough for me. Can't see ever drinking this again. Just too sweet for a lager IMO."
"A dull golden pour stirs up a foamy bleach white cap that retains like a solid styro-foam mass. As it slowly recedes it leaves big lacing that looks like a big snow drift clinging to the side of my glass. Cascading carbonation completes a pretty nice looking drink. The nose smells like cream corn and not fresh cream corn if I might add. Wow, this is not what I expected at all,after my last Baltika experience I was looking forward to something a bit smoother and enjoyable,this is neither. Barely drinkable, I do not blame others for pouring this out. This is garbage,must be Russia's version of Shlitz Bull Ice. Slightly malty, but mostly corn and offensive alcohol, zero hop presence that I can taste. I have never had the pleasure of tasting gasoline, but this is what I would imagine it tastes like. Give it a try, maybe you like?"
"Baltika #9 is a dense, clear, sparkling, light golden lager with a thin white head that dissipates slowly. It smells of alcohol, lemon rind and black pepper. There is, perhaps, a slight fusel note. It is medium bodied-- a little bubbly and syrupy, with a sticky finish. It tastes sweet. It's like... barley pop. It pretty much tastes like malt extract. There is the slightest green bitterness, but it's mostly just that sweet malt flavor. It's almost like it wasn't fully fermented. It's a simple flavor, but I must say it beats the heck out of any malt liquor I've had."
"D - Not a beer I'd have more than one of. I like the overall fruity taste even if it is one dimensional, but the big alcohol presence pushes this one over the line for me."
"mouthfeel and drinkability are average, its definitely a decent beer, and was pretty cheap, like 2 bucks for a pint"
"D: average, nothing really that would make you seek out more, but really no good reason not to finish."
"By far the least impressive of the Baltika brews that I have tried. Tastes just like your garden variety high gravity malt liquor. I won't be having this again by choice."
"Absolutely horrible, a straight drainpour."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Body is medium/light but loses its CO2 quickly and once that happens the beer loses its crispness. Quite drinkable, good hot weather beer."
"Overall, not bad for the price (<$2), worth giving a try, but just an ok beer."
"D - This is a slightly better than average malt liquor, which means it is still pretty unpleasant."
"To much alcohol. This one can be used to wash down anything spicy. Balance is a bit off. This one should be passed on by all but the curious."
"D: The flavors are strong and the alcohol is heavy. One bottle is more than enough."
"This was not an awful beer, but also not one I'd care to revisit again. An average if somewhat strange taste coupled with a very greasy mouthfeel. Nowhere near the best beer of this type out there."
"D - No thanks. This is just a really expensive cheapo malt liquor IMO. Save your dough and pick up a man sized can of Hurricane High Gravity or Steel reserve 211. It's about the same thing. Decent looking beer though...just stare at it, don't drink it."
"Drinkability - the selling ad for this beer could be 'the one to have when you're only having one...' ;-) I mean, come on, it's 51 ounces at 8%. Pretty tasty for a pseudo-wine, that's what I thought of it anyway. Two glasses in and the headache is forming... Still interesting and definitely a re-buy."
"Lots of nice carbonation, pretty much no head at all. Color is very good, not much different from your average lager, maybe a little darker gold. Some decent lacing for a lager. Smell is mild, but pleasant, a touch of alcohol. Kind of sweet. Taste is extremely sweet and malty followed by a dry and bready alcohol aftertaste. Not too bad for 8%. Mouthfeel is heavy for a lager with plenty of carbonation. Baltika continues to impress me with decent beer for reasonable prices at 2 bucks a pop for all of their single bottles. It should also be noted that this is a sipping lager, which kind of defeats the purpose."
"This is my first review of a high gravity euro lager. I tried Carlsberg Elephant a few years ago among a bunch of other beers. This is not the style for me."
"D - Very sweet, great dessert beer to enjoy with some bitter cheese. Too sweet to sip and enjoy several beers."
"D- Not too great not too shabby. Its an average macro tasting beer with an above average ABV and less than average price so if your aim is too knock a few back and get snookered than this is your brew."
"The first drink from my glass and my goodness, I paid too much....or so I thought. I let this beer warm up and air out a little bit and it got much better, that's not to say it was a great beer experience. The color looks like your typical american pale lager, better head, and great lacing though. The aroma smelled of corn sweet, and a bit bitter to the nose. The taste like I said wasn't good at first but it did get better. Very metallic flavor especially in the aftertaste. You can detect the sturdy alcohol content but it is not overwhelming. Now I can see why the Russians pride themselves on their vodka and not their beer."
"D - This is better than I expected. The main drawback is that it seemed to become increasingly heavy to drink."
"D - put it this way... i feel bad for my sink because I have to dump 49 of the original 51oz down the drain because this is so terrible. If you like vodka and would for some reason like the taste of it mixed with a cheap malt liquor then be my guest, but I will use this only to pull pranks on others... just plain horrible"
""
"Baltika 9 Extra Lager is a little lighter in body than I expected, but its overall flavor is good enough to make it worthy of a try. It's nothing special, but it does offer enough good taste to make it acceptable."
"This was a fun beer to try once, as all beers are, but I won't be drinking it again. I only made it halfway through this bottle before pouring it out."
"As with the other Baltika's I samples, this was drunk straight from the bottle. So there's no telling how it looked or even smelled. Aside from that, this was easy to drink, and had a pretty strong flavor. Mouthfeel and was similar to Baltika 7, and despite its higher potency, it still maintained rather good drinkability."
"D - Not what I was expecting, I was hoping for a well crafted and interesting Russian brew, but perhaps I should've done my research. I see now that this is closer to malt liquor than anything. If you like sweet brews or malt liquors, go for it, just beware if you are planning to drive."
"Overall not a bad selection for the style but nothing great either"
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Strong Lager (too strong !), I continue to try to find the Porter version."
"Blech."
"D-Not great, but pleasant. Alcohol is bold and warming, and flavors are light and tantalizing."
"D- I couldnt have a session with these. Not that it tasted bad, its just that the alcohol was very evident. It gave you a buzz in a hurry. But I could drink one now and then when I get in the mood."
"So I bought this on a whim for a beer tasting that I was having. The reason I bought this is because for 3 bones I was able to get 75 oz of beer in a large brown textured plastic bottle. The bottle has been textured so it reminds me of bad plaster work. The kicker about this beer is that it was exactly 1 year out of date when I bought it. I went up to the front of the store to ask about it and was informed that they had just received it (no dust on the bottle) and everything they get from that brewer comes that old. On to the review. Poured the first glass into my Chimay Chalice. This beer looks like someone fermented dirty dishwater. Slightly murky with no carbonation. I definitely think that the plastic bottle made it impossible to hold the carbonation for this long. Aroma is really sweet, like unrefined sugar and bananas. Taste is mildly interesting. Much of the same but the mildly interesting thing about it is it feels like there is an analgesic in the beer. Something is making my tongue numb. This is definitely the first experience I've had like this with a beer. Mouthfeel is numbing. Its drinkable but not great. Definitely if you need a beer to buy as a joke look for the big brown plastic bottle that says 9 Extra Lager. It looks like a bull's-eye. Pick it up."
"Not an amazing sample by far, but for the small price I paid, worth a shot..."
"D- It is drinkable, not the best around pretty average a very typical lager with slightly more flavor."
"Drinkability - will pass if offered this one again."
"D - Theres not much that is good about this beer if anything I'd just call it a Russian malt liquor"
"Light medium gold yellow pour with little white head. Smell is an odd mix of Alcohol, yeastiness, and a chemically smell, so in other words, not great. Taste was similar with a bit of bitterness, sort of malty sweetness I guess, and a cheap, hot alcoholic. Not very good, and wouldn't get again."
"Has a bit of a odd taste. Grain with a lot of unfermented sugars with a shot of alcohol. The beer also suffers from a lack of carbonation. It is a combination that makes this a hard drinking beer. This definately needs a stronger malt base. Not a good beer but I bet it would be good for getting a buzz fast."
"All in all, this is a decent beer, drinkable and with good elements. But with several imbalanced elements, this requires a makeover. More hops + less maltose syrup = better strong lager."
"I bought this beer in a 51 ounce plastic bottle mostly because I had never seen such a creature and partially because I wanted to reuse the bottle to bottle homebrew. It's got a hazy yellow-brown appearance with barely any head at all. It smells weird. It smells like old peaches and hay. Or perhaps an 11-year-old Jolly Rancher that nobody wanted to eat because it was apricot. It tastes sickeningly sweet and coats my tounge with an unpleasant chemical-like fruity, dry, hatred. Uuhhhh... I don't know how I'm going to finish this crap..."
"drinkability is o.k kinda reminds me of an American Malt Liquor, it's alright, is about all I can say..."
"This is pretty much your average Russian strong lager."
"Served from a 16.9 oz. can. Can opens with what seems like no carbonation. The pour shows there is a good bit of carbonation resulting in a three finger off white head with crackling bubbles. Body is a very pale bright gold. Nose is soft with wheat and yeasty vanilla notes, very crisp and resembling a german pilsner. A soured malt hop mix is first to reach the tongue. Slightly sweet and syrupy long on the palate. A rich bitter hue stay on to make up the mouthfeel. By time it hits the belly the warming starts, thats the only thing that tells of the 8% alchol. Nothing bad to say about this one. Nicely drinkable."
"this one had a 8-11-07 use by date on it (no wonder they're 0.97 USD each !! ); pours a golden colour w/ a fluffy white head which immediatly dissapates minimal lacing low co2; mostly alcoholic nose, maybe a hint of a toasted/caramel malt; not much for taste, adjuncts mostly, reminds me of a Steel Reserve Am. malt liquor, only w/ a faint hop presence; a syrupy sweet med-full body w/ no carb. flattish finish; not really looking forward to finishing this one, another strike for Baltika, their beers are either really good...or really bad...."
"It's readily available here in WA and cheap only $2 for a 16.9 fl. oz. bottle. Would buy again."
"I had no idea what to expect except for the alcohol content on the label. When poured into a glass this beer looks like normal lager, deep golden color maybe a little skunky smelling. The first sip was a little reminiscent of Ballentine Ale, if that's still around anywhere, but much better. Tastes sweet and a little grassy. There really isn't anything special about the mouth feel, but it is harmless tasting like an everyday lager, but watch out! Better drink this one cold as it is damn strong. Strong beers tastes a little rough when warm in my opinion. At 8% two bottles should do the trick, if that's what you're looking for. Its a pretty good bang for the buck at $1.49 each. I'd certainly buy it again if it remains available."
"Not bad - certainly ""strong"". There's enough to make it easy enough to drink one of these, but I wouldn't go for a second. Cleaner and crisper than some others I've had within this style."
"Who knew Russians made beer? Don't wanna act ignorant, but you certainly don't hear much about them in the states and the stereotype is that they're more 'hard liquor' types. But I was definitely proven wrong here. Got a huge plastic (?) bottle of this stuff, which made me guess this was probably a malt liquor type experience. Poured clear and golden. Nose was lots of solvent and malt. Not so great. Flavor was even worse - toffee malt, plastic, spicy solvent. Sort of felt like it bit into your mouth as you were going. Body is medium. No good, but it'll get you drunk."
"¡Salud!"
"This was my first sink pour in a long time. This beer poured a piss yellow color with a big head. It smelled sweet, but mostly of alcohol. The flavor was the same. The alcohol was way to strong and overpowered everything. Mouthfeel was good with adequate carbonation. Well with the sink pour I think that pretty much sums up the drinkability."
"Im not big on the sweet, malt liquor type beers, but this one isnt too bad. I dont think I will buy another, but one try was okay. ABV keeps the drinkability to a minimum; well, average at best. Sweet and sticky mouthfeel, yet finishes fairly dry with minimal aftertaste. This one is best served COLD."
"~ My first Russian brew and I'm impressed. I will recommend this to friends."
"Drinkability: This is my 1st Russian lager i've had and I'm relatively pleased w/ the drink. Not my favorite Lager but for the amount of alcohol in it and the price you can't complain to much if the taste is a little off due to lemon like taste"
"For 1.50 a bottle, I'd buy a sixer."
"I was very surprised to find a Russian beer that was tasty as this. It's a clean, dry lager, but it's a very strong beer. It goes down fairly easy, but I had a 16 oz bottle, so it's not for the weak of heart. The beer has a nice golden color, and a reasonably good smell. It's not too bad once you get some in your mouth either. Definately worth a try."
"Presentation: Packaged in a one liter brown plastic bottle, with a plastic screw cap. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"(I love the price!!!!)"
"this beer pours a nice golden amber with a rich foam at first that dissipates into a persistant lace. it smells like a flat hop tire with a little malt bed under it. it tastes like a russian industrial lager. i expect what this is, or it's a really dumbed down american import of a russian beer. it says it's 8.0% abv but i don't believe them. it feels okay to drink and it is certainly an easily drinkable beer but it is hardly anything interesting. i've tasted more character in a cold pbr. the abv overweighs it's limitations on taste. the russians at least know how to brew a heavy as fuck beer that goes down easy without being a malt liquor like big bear or 211 or olde english."
"Pours a golden color and has light carbonation. Head is minimal and mostly just a lace on the edge of the glass. After smelling it I thought it was just gonna be a generic macro lager. Fortunately the taste is decent and quite strong. You can definitely taste the 8% alcohol. Bitterness is at a minimum. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and somewhat smooth. Overall this beer is nothing special unless you want a beer to get you tanked and have a little more flavor to go with it."
"Eric"
"Drinkability? Well, I can't give it a 1, because I am actually able to finish it. But it isn't good, that is for sure! I wouldn't buy this beer again, even if I just wanted a cheap vehicle for getting drunk -- there are better options out there."
"The consistency was nice, not too watery but it didnt coat the mouth either. The beer leaves a bitter after taste."
"I only had 1 bottle as a sample, but if I had another I would have drank it!"
"Drinkability: Not bad, but not good. Needs more flavor to contend with what's out there."
"I have to say, this is a very weird beer in my opinion. The light body is oddly paired with a high amount of alcohol. It's surprisingly drinkable, but it doesn't seem like a revisitable beer for me."
"This is sort of like a slightly better than average macrolager, but not really anything special."
"Cheers2beers"
"Working on my Baltika Extra 9 Lager as I speak, right here at the keyboard. First beer review for me! Not a bad balance on this one in my eyes, hints of sweetness in there, but with enough hops present to keep it interesting. The head was thick at first, but it was not a creamy one and had very little staying power. I could see buying it again at two bucks for a single; not a bad value at all. Three quarters of the way through the drink I can definitely feel the warming effects of the eight percent alcohol content. Not a bad beer, would not mind recommending it to someone for a try."
"buy it again."
"D: this is one of those beers that you say, ""well, you can't taste it after about 4 beers, anyway..."". I'd probably choose to keep drinking this over just going sober at a party, but only if there were no other beers available."
"Mouthfeel was medium, body and carbonation. This is not one I will have again, too sweet."
"the ""loser"" of our Baltika Challenge. this is a clear beer with a white head that pours almost like a spirit. doesn't smell strongly, which i wasn't expecting....kind of corny like baltika's #2 and #3. some alcohol on the nose too. Taste had too much on the ethanol/rubbing alcohol side of things and too little on the beer-ness. way to go, you created alcohol. thinner than expected and off-putting overall. Vlad says that in Russia its much better and popular (likely due to the ABV)."
"The last beer of the Baltika challenge. A very clear, mildly yellow beer with a white foamy head. Way too clear. Nose is sweet alcohol, mild hops, and some corn. Taste is grainy with strong alcohol and more alcohol. Mouthfeel is ok. Drinkability is hurt by the alcoholic taste."
"Drinkability: If you happen to like light beers with little flavor that are supposed to be relatively strong, then you better pick this cheap import up. I had it and I don't hink I'd pick this one up again."
"Hops are a bit more pronounced in the taste but there's a good amount of alcohol heat here too. Keeps the beer on the dry side although there is considerable sweetness from the malt. Mouth is semi-sweet with a dry herbal aftertaste. Warming alcohol in the belly. A good drinker. Decent malt liquor style beer."
"Poured well, though distinct strong malt aroma was present. Taste was as advertised- strong alcohol with a rice cereal-like sweetness, most definately from the added maltose. The Extra 9 must be the eastern European answer to the Steel Reserve, if not a little more sophisticated."
"Poured very clear golden , with a frothy white head that stuck around. Alot of nice bands of lacing were left on the glass. Very grainy malt in the nose , slight hop , and definate bit of alcohol. The taste is also a grainy ride with a noticable spirit like alcohol throughout. Some sweet cereal like malt , probably from the maltose syrup. The carbonation and alcohol bites the back of the tongue , as well as just a touch of hop bitterness to round out the mildly sweet malt profile."
"Enough is enough and I can't finish this pint."
"Not sure if Im rating the same beer as everyone else. This one has a red label, and says ""#9 Strong Lager"". Since I found no others to match. Ill rate this. I was actually impressed with this beer, much more so than the Baltika #6 Porter. The flavor, while not real recognizable, was smooth and left a good finish. If this really is the same beer, it was a far cry above the Schlitz (Bull) Malt Liquor I drank as a kid, and I must say I actually enjoyed this beer."
"Perhaps a bit atypical of Euro Lagers. It didn't have a dead skunk in it! Actually the flavors were quite malty and sweet, with a noble hop earthyness and pungentcy. A grain aroma persisted under the heavy malts and (corn) adjuncts, which transpired through to the flavors. The grain 'bitey-ness' was light and overshadowed by pilner malt flavors and textures, and sugary sweetness. Hops were regulated to offsetting the sweetness, and adds an herbal quality to the beer. Tastes dangerously close to a malt-liquor with the residual sweetness and abrasive alcohols."
"Poured a pale gold with a very thin, quickly disappearing head. A sweet smell of malt and syrup is noted. A very sweet taste that lingers long after it goes down. It tastes like it is too low on the hops and needs a better balance with bitterness and carbonation. A light, mouthfeel that is unremarkable and consists of nothing exceptional. If this beer has been preceeded by several others, it's drinkable otherwise probably not the first drink of choice."
"Not very drinkable. If I hadn't already had a couple of beers tonight, I'd finish it. Given that I have, this ones a drain pour."
"A medium body - slightly dextrinous mouthfeel - with moderate carbonation provides a creamy middle that finishes nearly dry with help of moderate hop IBUs and almost hidden alcohol. Been putting this off thinking it would taste much more harsh. Although the aromma and taste became slightly fusel with warming, drinking this was not that big of chore."
"Not a fun drink to have. Avoid if you can and try the brewery's #6 instead."
"D: I have to admit that this is more drinkable than I expected. I bought this out of curiousity and probably won't buy it again, but at $1.72 for a 500ml, it's not bad."
"In the aftertaste, again malt and honey. Too much. In the end, boring. Again light camomile notes."
"Drinkability: This beer is nightmarish. Maybe it would be passable if you drink it ice cold, but otherwise... ugh!"
"Malt Liquor at its worst, an awful beer that gained a vast popularity in the skid rows all over Old World. Generally, it's possible to brew a really strong pale lager, and there are some very successful examples of the style. In St. Petersburg the brewers (or, more likely, managers) were busy only with packing their product with alcohol. Well, they succeeded and offered us a horrible brew. Thanx, no!"
"Here it is: the Russian version of Camo malt liquor. The beer looks like a Budweiser, but has a a half inch head that it retains for a minute or so. The taste is unpleasant, and is very similar to a strong American malt liquor. It does get a bit better as you drink it, but I expected more from it than what I got. If you really want that malt liqour taste, then buy an American malt liquor; you can get 2 for the price of a single Baltika 9."
"Creamy feel, did not go down smooth. Alcohol bites a bit, but nothing 'extra strong'."
"Not a very drinkable beer. I did not enjoy this one."
"The beer dispenses from the 500ml brown bottle an archetypal clear gold lager color, the head modest in size, frothy in texture, and the color bright white, after its erosion the lace a velum like sheet to cover the glass. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, fresh and crisp; the start is sweet, the grain profile adequate and the top light to moderate in feel. Finish is sternly acidic, the hop apropos to the style, the high ABV, does show through at the very dry finish, not a good beer, but not as bad as I remember."
" Not neccesarily good but I could see buying it again under the right conditions."
"Drinkability is average. Goes down easy, but with a heavy abv that would deter me from making a session out of this."
"Pours crystal-clear golden yellow with a big white head that disappears all too soon. Not much in the way of an aroma save for a slight tartness and evidence of alcohol. The flavor is for the most part neutral, with some malt and adjunct in there. The finish is moderately bitter -- surprisingly so -- and quite dry. The hefty alcohol (8%) finally perks up a bit in the aftertaste, and its warming effect stirs gently in the gut. For a basic, mostly flavorless lager, Baltika 9 could be a lot worse, and it's pretty cheap taboot. Worth a crack if you don't have any real expectations."
"Thanks to Pegasus for the sample."
"I was disappointed by this beer, it is not bad, but it lacks identitiy."
"D- This beer is too light and there is really no taste and aroma only faint hints of malt and hops. It is interesting that they can hide 8% abv in this beer with little flavor."
"Overall, it has an added rarity factor (at least stateside) and the minimal requisite degree of taste present to not be entirely out of place in my fridge."
"Poured a pale amber color with white puffy head that quickly fades. Smell is minimal with only a slight sweetness to be found. Taste is also minimal, but not unpleasant, with slight sweetness present. Finishes very light with little if any flavor. Way too easy to drink for an 8% beer. Alcohol is completely hidden.Almost seems as if it should be a malt liquor."
"Worth a try drinkable for the the heft. Not sure I'd stay for more than one"
"This beer came in a 16.9 ounce brown bottle with a best before date of 18.04.06. Pours a pale yellow with fluffy head. This beer definitely smells like alcohol, and alcohol is defintely noticeable in the taste. Definitely tastes kind of like a malt liquor, but more drinkable than your typical forty in my opinion. I think this is pretty drinkable for an 8 percent lager. I don't think I'd go looking for this, but I wouldn't pour it drown the drain either."
"The mouth is average but the drinkabilty suffers from the taste. I cant believe this is the same brewery that makes the tasty porter. Perhaps this is the Russian version of a cheap malt liquor?"
"16.9 ounce bottle. Baltika 9 pours out a clear yellowish color with a white head. It leaves an intricate pattern of lacing on my glass. Cloyingly sweet grain aroma with some corn. Decent grain flavor. Very simple, with little off flavor. Alcohol is very noticable, and hides any flavor there may be. Mouthfeel is a little bit thick. I wasn't a big fan of this beer, but I suppose it could be worse. Drinkability is poor. It's no easy task to finish a bottle of this stuff."
"A clear yellow colorunremarkable, with a moderate, fluffy head. The aroma is alcohol and sugary-sweetness. Theres a cereal and grainy quality of the aroma as well, but the alcohol smell is unshakable. Despite the initial smell, the beer is actually drier than expected. Moderate to heavy body. The finish is bitter, with a serious alcohol quality. Threes really not a lot else going on with this one. Ive been impressed with other beers from this brewery, but this one is simply uninspiring."
"Nothing here that would appeal to another sample, but if you feel the urge to get tipsy on a couple bottles of Russian beer, this would do it."
"My best experience with this is bringing a case to a NYE party and seeing that it was the right call! We all wanted that big ass bottle and it drinks really well in a party atmosphere. That's Baltika in a nutshell, good at parties. In fact it was my favorite brew in Santigao, Chile, where parties ran long and late into the night."
"I found most of this exchange ironic as he was sharing some fine red-wines including Pinot Noir, Shiraz and some bold Cabernets...yet he was drinking Bud and was unable to identify anything in the flavor profile that he liked or disliked apart from wet and cold..."
"Overall kinda bland."
"Pours a pale gold color with not much head. First thing you notice with this brew is the malt sweetness followed by a not so lovely corn flavor. Wasn't expecting much from this brew and I wasn't suprised by the outcome. The only saving grace of this beer is the 8% alc. Probably won't be picking this up again in the near future."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color ale with a big bubbly white head with average retention. Aroma of sweet malt with a dose of cough medicine. Taste is more enjoyable then I was expecting with a nice base of sweet malt, limited amount of corn or adjunct is detectable and then cough medicine appears at the end to ruin it all. Could have been worse but could have been a lot better."
"Head is big, white, noisy, fluffy. Beer is very clear gold. Pretty. Sweet fruit and some spice share the nose with a little barbershop. The beer starts fruity sweet with some alcohol. Middle is thick and fruity: a little cherry syrupy. Finishes sweet with peanuts and anise. Alcohol sours the mix a little. Again, not really bad. Some decent spice, sweet fruit. But alcohol and some syrupy cloy detract."
"Prior to today, my assigning of scores to Baltika products was directly proportional to the number on the label. From #2 and #3 on the low end to #8 (wheat) on the high end. Baltika #9 shoots that relationship all to hell. This is an ethanolic mess of a beer that I can't recommend under any circumstances. Homies in Red Square would be better served by a mass importation of Steel Reserve High Gravity."
"Mouthfeel is a little heavy, not surprising. I would definitely characterize this as a malt liquor, although a shade better than the US brands. Interesting, possibly worth a second look, not sessionable though."
"Pours with a creamy large white head that settled over unusually bright yellow/gold liquid with just a touch of haziness. The nose is sweet sugary maltiness mixing with sharp bitter smelling hops. The taste is pretty much as the nose was described...very sweet malt, almost saccharine sweet followed by strong hop bitters and some palpable alcohol in the throat. Finishes long and bitter with a sweet flourish...nice to enjoy as a one-off, but not as a session brew."
"I'm really disappointed, because i guess i was hoping there was something like a Russian doppelbock and this was it. Nope. Bleh."
"Corn, corn, corn! It smelled like corn, taste like corn. Poured light golden, like corn. Tasted some stale hops. I got the impression that they were doing their best to cover the high alcohol content, but I could definitely taste the alcohol. Of course, the first thing I tasted was corn, then the alcohol would poke through. Not a bad mouthfeel, lots of bubbles. Russians are known for vodka, not beer, so I guess this is a notable try at brewing. Reminded me of Budweiser with lots more alcohol."
"crispy up front with some biscuity,wheat taste that fades rapidly into a slight slight hop finish. An odd drying spicyness in the middle slammed together with a massive carbonation smacks the palate around abit. This one could get you crocked fast at 8% and the bonus is that this beer is fairly cheap for an import and has maximum warming without the coarse feel of some local malts. I kinda wish there was one more ranking category ""price vs quality"""
"Clear, pale yellow body, fizzy and active carbonation, and an inch thick head combine to form an attractive looking lager. The larger than average size of 500 ml. necessitated poring into an imperial pint glass, which also aided in the appearance. Aroma was lemony, perfumey, alcoholic, and slightly vegetal, but overall not a bad smell for the style. Taste was rather simplistic due to the excessively sweet and underattenuated body. The hops were present, and evident, but not in a quantity sufficient to offset the sweetness. Unlike the domestic malt liquors, I could not detect any harsh adjunct flavors. There was a nice lemon twist sourness imparted by the clean lager yeast strain. Alcohol was not too obtrusive either. The bottle had a best before date of 4 September 05, so I guess the ageing on the shelves of Greens did this beer some good. Either that, or I just like this one better than most of you."
"Opinion: Well, this is an OK beer. I would put it in with the American lager category. It has a good bit of adjuncts, but manages to retain some flavor while still reaching 8%ABV. You have to give it credit for that. It's not one that I would seek out, but it's worth a shot someday."
"Well, I made it through the entire 500ml bottle, no drain pour for me! Well, only paid $2 for it (plus shipping), so not much of a loss. Now if I can keep it down past an hour without batching, Ill be OK."
"The body is thin and this beer is not very drinkable IMO. I have had and enjoyed their wheat (very nice and I will have it again) and their dark beer (good, much like an oktoberfest) in the last few weeks but this one, no thank you comrade!!"
"This was pretty much your run of the mill storng euro lager. Fizzy gold color, almost headless, with visible carbonation. Smell was grass and alcohol, not vvery well concealed. Bland, but very strong alcohol. Mouthfeel is well carbonated but that neither helps nor hurts this beer. This is a very skippable beer."
"I don't like this beer, and don't plan on having it again. Bought it at Strong Bros. without having read the reviews on BA, and regretted the purchase ever since. It's been sitting in my fridge for a month or so -- I'm glad I tried it (if nothing else than to get a taste of what people are drinking in Russia) but this is much worse than what I'd normally buy. I'd take a Budweiser over this any day."
"Pured a slightly hazy strawish golden color with very little head. Smell was a little weak but there was hints of hops and alchol. Tasted nice clean and crisp. It had hints of very sweet hops and malts. Slightly bitter and its higher alchol content makes it a very strong beer. Personally I enjoyed it and would reccomend it highly."
"This isn't bad. I have certainly had worse, and its one of the few beers that I have tried that actually got less appealing as it warmed - most of the beer genres I enjoy get better as they warm. I would drink this again if offered, and it would be a very good cold one to slake a thirst on a hot day, or with some simple foods. If you can get this cold, give it a try."
"Baltika #9 is a weak pale yellow in color with an average-sized, bright white head. Carbonation levels are decent. The aroma is lightly sweet and grassy. An adjunct smell is all over here. Taste is sweet with plenty of adjunct flavor. A touch of alcohol astringency is tasted in the finish. The overall character of the beer is very similar to an American malt liquor, however this is a little better than most because of a higher amount of malt flavor. I can't really recommend #9, try it if you have a thing for lagers with higher alcohol content."
"Why does the label now say ""Pale Ale", are they insane or was this a really bad translation? Light yellow with an overly aggressive frothy white head that laced, looked like it'd be a refreshing advertisment. Very very light cornbread on the nose but perhaps the head was masking everything. The alcohol and carbonation attack your tongue and overwhelm any taste but I get a bit of grain, cashews, and I'm almost certain they put some grain alcohol in this at some point (silly but feels that way). Finish is sharp. Toward the end of the glass I got a distinctly different beer but at that point I wasn't paying enough attention. Not something I'll buy again."
"Smell was grainy. Tasted initially like an average macro or even a malt liquor and as it warmed slightly taste was dominated by alcohol from start to finish. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't, at least for me, a deterrent to my enjoyment of this brew. Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Not one of the better Baltikas I've had but I'd probably give it another go at my next backyard BBQ."
"I can already feel a headache coming on this one!!!! I feel like I am drinking 40 oz's of Hurricane Malt Liquor again back in my high school days. The gross alcohol is all that makes up this beer. If you are looking to get blitzed, cheap, at a frat party, but still want to look cultured, go get yourself a few of these. There is nothing to this beer other than a massive alcohol backbone, and a nice pretty golden color."
"Very disappointing beer, the worst so far from this brewery."
"(16.9 oz) (Ron)"
"If you like malt liquor, then you cant miss this one! But, if you dont, you might want to steer clear of it. While there is some mildly decent maltiness (really, though, its only barely adequate) and the mouthfeel is ok, this beer fails to impress thanks to the total lack of hop aroma or flavor and the strong alcohol taste (at 8%, theres not really THAT much alcohol in this one, just nothing else to mellow it out). In fact, I might have some trouble finishing it off. Not recommended."
"It pours a very clear yellow color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of lemon character in it as well as a little corn-like graininess. The flavor was terrible. Cardboard and chemicals, as kmpitz2 said. I had to pour this one out."
"This brew pours an ultra pale yellow color with a small head that sits nicely over top. The nose is grainey, slightly sweet and lemony, wtih a whiff of alcohol. The flavor is awful. I don't think it is oxidized, but it has this cardboard and chemical flavor to it that just really is offensive. The feel is moderate with an active carb. I don't think I will be finishing this one. The flavor is just not all that great and keeps it from being worth any more sips."
"Didn't really know what this was until I brought it home and looked up some reviews. Seems to be a Russian malt liquor. 500 mL bottle, best before Nov. 13, 2005 - served in a pilsner glass. It actually looks OK. Kind of a pale yellow with lots of carbonation and a 1 finger head that leaves a decent amount of lace. Smells of sweet, metallic corn with a bit of alcohol - very macroish. The taste isn't very pleasant. It's thick, tastes the same as the smell and has no hops to speak of. Mouthfeel isn't impressive and as far as drinkability, it's the closest I've come to dumping a beer I'm reviewing down the drain."
"Taste is macroswill with a definite touch of booze. Unbalanced and really pretty unpleasant to drink. More stank, more minerals, strip-mined from the malts. Lightly sweet in the after."
"Drinkability  This went down a litter rougher than the #3. I can enjoy and appreciate a stiff, boozy brew but this was a bit harsh for my preferences."
"A clean light yellow/straw colored beer. Has big tightly bubbeled bright white head. The aroma is light malt /biscuit with a hint of grassiness in the background. Almost no real flavor at all. Some hints of a biscuity malt in there (very light) and also the hops are only hinted at in the finish. It doesn't taste bad and if you want a buzz this will give you one."
"I think curiosity is an inherent trait of all BA's and this curiosity led me to pick up a bottle of this brew. Upon opening the bottle I immediately smell a strong sweet maltiness that is a tad over the top, almost like a concentrated macro lager. Appearance is straw yellow with a large soapy looking white head which leaves large bubbles on the sides of my glass instead of a gentle lacing. Taste is initially grainy before finishing super super sweet, a floral type of sweetness. No alcohol is detectable. Not very pleasing to me. I'd like to try other beers from Baltika as this one will not be a repeat buy for me."
"Ghastly. Essentially, this is imported bad malt liquor. Cidery malt, with an overwhelming fusel alcohol presence. Phenolic medicinal notes. A strong lager can be done well, or, as this demonstrates, very, very badly. I've had a couple of beers from this brewery that weren't too bad, so I wonder how they can crank this stuff out - perhaps this works with the local taste."
"i could drink this one for a while, but the ABV could slow me down."
"But the taste is very apple-y and sweet, like I was trying a radler for some reason. There is a late taste of the alcohol, but it's pretty smooth. Maybe it can be passed off as a wine cooler. >:-)"
"Okay, trying it again after having the bottled version, the alcohol warmth is kind of welcoming. There's still a big sugary taste, but for some reason it doesn't bother me as much. Still, there's an undeniable attraction to being able to buy this from a kiosk on almost any residential corner in Russia and to drink it just while walking around!"
"This beer has it's niche in the market of those who enjoy drinking swillish beers that look more sophisticated than Budweiser or Coors. I personally couldn't tell the difference and would rather have kept this one in the bottle."
"Beer is good. Happy Ruskie beering."
"Baltika CAN make a decent beer; their #6 Baltic Porter is quite tasty and a steal at @ $1.75. Don't waste your time with the 9."
"Pours a transparent rich yellow with a white frothy head. The head dips down within a minute to leave lacing on the sides of the glass and Belgian lace across the top of the beer. The aroma has a big musty graininess to it, with a bit of medicinal herbal hops. Hint of alcohol, and hint creamed corn tossed in for good measure. Very aggressive carbonation rips across the tongue, barely giving anything a chance to be sampled. Herbal raw bitterness leads the second advance moving to a mild alcohol bite wrapped in residual sweetness. Simplest way to describe this would be malt liquor with hops, and not quite as thick. Mouthfeel is mildly coating, and the carbonation really works the palate over like Ivan Drago. All in all, not a bad brew, and undeserving of the low rating it seems to have garnered for itself."
"Just say ""nyet""!"
"It pours a clear straw golden color with a decent white head that doesn't last too long, musty grainy and flowery aromas. Bready and grainy flavors, medium bodied, nice crisp and carbonated mouthfeel, finishes sweet yet clean, a decent malt liquor, I had no problem finishing the bottle."
"I got three from this brewery, and I find myself praying the others are better than this."
"Not that great of a beer. It wasn't horrible but not really worth it."
"This is no Hevelius Kaper! Thin, sweet, and it certainly has some adjuncts. Not terrible, but only worth it if you want the alcohol ""bang for your buck"". If your looking for a good, high ABV Baltic lager, get the Kaper. This one is a little hard to swallow!"
"I think high alcohol beers have a challenge justifying their existence in terms of flavor. This one doesn't quite rise to it."
"Of the order of other strong crap lagers, say, Bavaria's 12.3, this beer is dull as a lager (a bit more orangey but hey, nothing out of the order), excessively sweet, bad in hops, perceivable alcohol....etc. There's really nothing great to it aside from where it comes from (hehe but that's personal now)."
"Drinkability? This is REALLY just a very smooth malt liquor."
"Taste is pretty clear and weak. There are hops in the end of the flavor and hints of pear left on the tongue, but it is otherwise very flavorless."
"This beer has a nice clear gold color with a small head that vanished quickly. There was no lace to speak of. The aroma was grainy and slightly metallic with traces of alcohol. The taste was that of sweet, grainy malt and alcohol coupled with a decent hop bite. The mouthfeel was smooth and mellow and seemed a little doughy towards a sweet, dryish finish. The high alcohol level gives you a good relaxing buzz."
"Sorry comrades, to me beer is about the taste not the alcohol content!"
"As has been noted previously, a basic Baltic malt likka...who needs it...learn from my sad experience...avoid like the bubonic plague!!!"
"Pours a clear yellow with large carbonation bubbles and a thick creamy head. The aroma is weak, some sweetness and grass are detected. There is a sweet and creamy mouthfeel. The malt is the strongest towards flavor and only a hint of hops is detected. Very smooth aftertaste. Not terrible, but not too exciting either."
"This one poured a light golden colour almost like a Reposado style Tequila. It began with a lovely, thick snow white head approximately 2 centimetres in thickness (that's a bit less than an inch). It left quite nice lacing in my glass, but the head soon dissipated to about half its original thickness, and then soon after, all but faded into a light, white haze. The smell is quite unusual in that, it doesn't really smell quite like any other beer or ale that I've had before. One can smell a wee bit of yeast, but other characteristics seem to me, unidentifiable. The taste, like the smell, is peculiar. Not bad or dis-satisfying, just peculiar. It goes down easy (the 8,0abv is evident when it hits bottom; to one who is used to quite mild beers and ales) but all in all, there's nothing terribly wrong with this one. It isn't the greatest brew I've ever had, likewise it isn't the worst. Carbonation was right where it needed to be. Not absent, yet not like Sprite. Just beneath the middle of those two. I'd probably drink one of these again."
"Pale gold and crystal clear, light puffy fine-bubbled head and crystalline lace. Distinct raisiny grape aroma, lots of fusels. Malt is honeyish but masked by an astringent pruney grape and cheap table wine-like character. Finishes lighter but still vinous with a speck of hop that's a bit clove-like. Low carbonation and medium mouthfeel, harsh alcohol without fun or redeeming flavors that make it worth it. Has a real Malt Liquor style and flush to it, and overall, its a little weird and on the sour side. Harsh and worsens as it warms, I can't say this is at all worth keeping stocked."
"ΤНΪЅ ЅЦCЌS БАD ЌЮМЯДDЄЅ !!!!"
"Something I might try again when it's a little more Ukrainian outside..."
"The beer pours a golden color with a bone white lacey head. The aroma is quite plain, but maintains all the traditional lager qualities. The taste is really good. I'm not usually a fan of lagers, but this one is smooth and refreshing. Also the elevated abv. (8%) is not noticable. There is very little bitterness and the taste, although plain, is good. The mouthfeel is a little rough. There is way too much carbonation. The beer is light bodied and a pleasure to drink."
"Like a premium vodka, this beer only succeeds in hiding its ABV. Rather tasteless. Malt liquor drinkers should buy this, considering I paid $1.49 for 16.9oz. And I could drink it warm. Light yellow color, with just the hint of hops. Overall, a good beer to tie one on."
"Light straw color with a fizzy white head that disappears quickly, but leaves some chunky lacing randomly around the glass. Smell is grassy, with hints of pine and citrus. No alcohol smell for such a strong beer. Taste is bitter upfront, hot hoppy, just bitter. A pine and lemon flavor rolls to the back of the tongue, and then an alcohol bitter warmth settles in. A little skunk creeps in afterward. All right, it's not a kick ass beer, but it's better than most malt liquors and doesn't leave that furry phlegm ball in the back of your throat."
"Very light gold color. Small head. Aroma is slightly malty and sweet. Its very sweet, lots of corn added?. The corn flavor is balanced by a strong alcohol flavor. No hops to speak of, yet there is some bitterness whose origin I don't really want to know. This stuff is really awful. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is chemical and bitter."
"As it pours into the glass, you think light lager - yellow color, white fizzy head with big bubbles, next to no lace. The smell is light, with just a touch of malt. The mouth tingles, and you can feel the hops starting to come out as the liquid flows over the tongue. Next thing you notice is the alcohol content, which is just slightly reminiscent of a very watered down whiskey. The aftertaste is hoppy bitter, but with a metallic bite that leaves a most unpleasant impression. I've had much worse Russian ""strong"" beers, but I won't be having another one of these, either!"
"Clear golden color with a white head that diminishes to a ring. The aroma is grainy wit a slight fruity hop aroma. The flavor is of sweet malt with a bit of grain and fruit hop flavors. It is a medium-full bodied beer with a sweet finish. It is easy drinking for its strength; not a bad beer."
"The Russian guy I bought this from seemed very excited that someone was actually buying this.He reccomended it highly several times.I couldnt believe it was 8% because it looked so light.The pour and appearance were horrible.I swear it looked like water when i was pouring it.I had to really stir things up with the pour or I doubt any head at all would of resulted.Poured 3/4 of an inch head that died to nothing leaving a soapy and sticky white lace.The color is a cloudy straw yellow.The smell reminds me of that budweiser macro crap shit.Light bodied with a strong alcohol taste and finish.Aroma is of corn with a skunky and light malt smell.A slight crispness with a lingering bitterness that wont leave the back of my throat.Freshness date expired two months ago,but that doesnt really concern me.They must of added vodka to this because I cant figure out how they made this 8% and so light tasting.I give them credit for that.I am already feeling this beer after only half of it.There must be some hops in it because of the bitter finish.I wouldnt buy this again unless i was broke and wanted a quick buzz.Budweiser fans should switch to this stuff and they wouldnt need a 30pack to get drunk.Overall interesting."
"The bottle is fresh, and was well-sealed. I hate to do it, but I guess I'm not really rating this beer with its style in mind. Granted, it's much tastier than most American malt liquors, but that's not enough of a redeeming characteristic for me to rate this beer any higher than I am."
"From a fresh bottle that's just a few months old. It pours a hazy yellowish (and almost green-tinted) body that's capped by a foamy bright-white head which holds well and maintains a thin surface covering throughout most of the glass. unfortunately, it leaves only minor lace. The nose expresses sweet malt that's grainy and bready alongside some limited grassy hops. It's surprisingly nice compared with most strong Russian Lagers which incorporate high levels of adjunct! However, in typical Russian-style, the medium body is coupled with a fine-bubbled but moderate carbonation that leaves it more smooth & creamy than crisp. Still, it's fairly nice and doesn't work against the beer. The flavor is mainly of sweet grainy malt with a light touch of hop flavor and a supportive bitterness. The alcohol is almost completely hidden and it finishes clean, but only semi-dry with some lingering sweet malt. It's well done and surprisingly drinkable considering its strength."
"A malt liquor that masks the alcohol very well.  Slightly sweet with a hint of bitterness.  Everything about it was average, except for mouthfeel, which was rather like having cotton in your mouth...go figrue that one out, I haven't.  Put this in a 40 and market it as a high-class malt liquor import, which it is..."
"Light golden in hue w/ a slight haze.  Thick, fluffy, white head with decent retention.  Attractive lace is left. Somewhat pilsner like in appearance.  Trace grassy hop along w/ light bready sweetness in aroma.  Not much else there aromawise.  Any similarities to a pilsner immediately end with a brash of grainy sweetness on the palate which persists throughout the taste.  Once the graininess fades, sweetness becomes sugary, and reminescent of underattenuated wort.  Hop bitterness is virtually nonexistant.  Lightly bodied, and smooth enough in mouthfeel to facilitate easy drinking copious quaffing to acheive a buzz.  Finishes, sweet, clean and bland.  Baltika Strong is not a good beer, but is a notch above the typical malt liquor flavorwise (and pricewise)  It's reminescent of King Cobra without the adjuncts."
"At first taste, not bad. But, after the second and third sip, it had just a slight bitterness, but not much in the way of a flavor I could my finger on. One more sip and I was turned off and deposited it down the drain. First, no, second brew I ever poured down the drain!"
"Notes: Do they sell this one in 40’s down in their hood? Spot on for the American Malt Liquor Style though this is probably not what they were going for. Careful with this one meaning don’t make this one of your last beers of the night."
"Never having tasted a Russain beer, I did not know what to expect.  A friend of mine gave it to me, thinking I would like to try it.  I did like trying it, but I would never drink it again. Tased like a sweet version of a malt liquor.  Cold, it was drinkable.  When it warmed just slighlty, I had trouble getting it down."
"By the way in Russia ""Baltika #9 Extra"" is on the second place on popularity after ""Baltika #3 Classic""."
