"Alcohol plays a big role here, but adds flavor more than detracts. There are better and worse high-alcohol beers from Eastern Europe. I would take this over typical American Malt Liquors. Not bad for what it is. It does have some character to it."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a hazy dark golden color with some tangerine highlights. The head was a finger of slightly yellow foam that retained well at first as a cap and then as a collar. The aroma was of… booze. Additionally there was some skunky notes and generic malt along with a hint of sweet malt. The flavors were more pleasant than the aroma suggested but it still was dominated by booze in tandem with the generic malt and a touch of citrusy hops lurking behind it all. Totally Euro-malt liquor. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation delicate. As a beer, it reminded me of my college girlfriend in Colorado; it felt good and looked good, but I wouldn’t want to be stuck with it."
"Gotta love the random Ukrainian ticks, amiright? This one pours a clear straw topped by a short finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises slightly sour wheat, light grass, light sweet flowers, and a few drops of lemon juice. The taste holds notes of cloyingly sweet corn syrup, straight chlorophyll, powdered sugar, and light wheat. Wow, this stuff almost comes across as an American malt lickah (one of the crappier ones...) in terms of flavor. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly watery feel. Overall, I could not stand much of this beer at all. It seriously hurt me a little bit to drink. Boo this."
"This one was not horrible...but I won't remember the name of this beer in two weeks. Just so-so."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and alcohol. Taste is crisp, slightly sweet, malts and alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall I was fairly impressed with this beer."
"I was VERY surprised by the nice mouthfeel and abundant malt flavor in this beer. Sadly I will say I was expecting much worse. Not great, but not horrible like some American Malt Liquor that makes me want to retch."
"As if you couldn't already infer, this beer's alcohol content (7.2% ABV) seems to define most aspects of the finished product. It's more malty, so I think it lacks balance, but I suppose you should expect that for such a cheap beer. There is hardly any English on the label and it cost me about ~$1.50 for 0.5 L. I think some other reviewers have commented on this below me, but I suppose you could think of it as a ""glorified 40."" For the price it's alright, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try this beer again unless I'm looking to get really, really drunk."
"As an import it is very cheap. But it is better than average; a good value. I'd buy it again."
"D: I've always liked this beer. Having spent an extended time in Ukraine, I believe this beer is one of their best offerings to the rest of the free world. (Too bad I can't buy it for $0.45 like there.)"
"Overall, this is a pretty decent yet unremarkable Ukranian brew. This brewery seems to have a couple solid lagers in their stable...others from this region haven't been so good. Recommended if you are into German & Polish beer."
"OK I might be in the minority here but I actually like this stuff. Might be because I like Russian brown bread a lot and this tastes exactly like that to me."
"The one thing I can say about this beer is drink it if you want to get drunk. Similar to Molson XXX but better made. Smoother, a little more flavor and body along with the tongue-numbing alcohol."
"Ho hum..."
"Sinkability  This could give a horse gingivitis."
"Drinkability: Skip it."
"The mouth is nothing special. I could order another, maybe two before moving on."
"This lager poured a hazy, golden/light amber color with tall, creamy, slightly off-white foam that slowly settled. The smell was slightly sweetish malty with a touch of biscuit and hops. There was also a bit of a corn-like aroma. The taste was sweet like corn syrup with some malt. It was decently hoppy, especially in the finish. There was the lightest hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel was slick and smooth with medium body and good carbonation. The sticky adjunct(?) sweetness lingered. This beer was not horrible, but it was not very good, and I would rather not drink another."
"Just slightly chill-hazed gold appearance, white milky head that holds well at 1/2 an inch for a minute, then turns to nothing. Laces in strings and dots, but they are gone from the glass by the third sip. Sweet fruit cocktail aroma, a bare sense of cardammon. Medium mouthfeel, carbonation is light and underdone. Sweet malty start, apples and pears, mellons, residual sugar. Mid mouth transition to an overall bitter tone that's different from a normal hop balance, fusels, Three-in-One oil. Broad bitterness that counters the persisting sweetness all the way to the considerable aftertaste. Not that bad, but strange. Alcohol is noticeable. A decent beginning and an odd finish."
"For a mass produced beer this one isn't too bad. It's very smooth and the flavor doesn't seem to have the adjuct flavors of other similar beers."
"Smooth and rich, though I almost wish it wasn't. Carbonation is light and easy. Overall feel is lightly caustic. I'll pass on this one if I ever see it again. The things I do for my country..."
"A mild lemon and lime citrusy flavor and light herbal background taste make way for the dominant alcohol kick. A waxy cardboard like quality is noticed later in the glass. This is an oddball brew!"
"Pale gold with an average level of carbonation; head is big at first but vanishes quickly. Smell is musty and alcoholic, no hop aroma detectable. Wet paint is not too far out. Malty, sweetish taste; quite one-dimensional. A cloying bitterness comes through in the end for the aftertaste - but not before coarse, grainy notes prevail. Not an impressive beer, the underlying sweetness at first sip is its best feature. Avoid."
"The liquid is a clear deep gold. A hard pour induced a two fingered white head wiht some body and a bit of staying power, leaving a few traces of lace along the glass. The nose is harsh and metallic, a sign of things to come. The mouth is heavy and quite prickly. The flavor is basically sweet corn syrup, followed by a harsh metallic bitterness that is most unpleasant. Alcohol states its presence quite insistently, and there is little to cloak and tame the beast. You'd probably be better off just drinking diluted grain alcohol. The aftertaste is a pretty darn unpleasant mix of sweet corn and harsh tinny metal. Swill? Did someone say ""swill""? Of the one liter in my bottle, 4/5 ended up down the drain."
"The beer pours the prototypical pilsner clear gold color with a mountainous head that is bright white in color, frothy in its texture and the lace a white satin veil to conceal the glass. Nose the archetypal pilsner fresh, crisp, and malt sweet as is the start with a fair to middling top. Finish is peaceful in its acidity and the hops apropos to the style, sweet and dry aftertaste, just a common pilsner with a 7.2 percent ABV."
"Blech!"
"Pours a hazy golden body with a short but creamy bright-white head that drops to a decent collar but leaves no lace. The nose expresses a mild grainy malt and some noticeable alcohol. A firm, medium body is leveled by its crisp carbonation. The flavor displays a dryish, grainy malt with some clear alcohol; backed by a firm bitterness. It finishes short and dry with just a drop of lightly sweet, grainy malt. Although adjuncts are clearly being used, there is a fuller graininess than offered by some other examples; but there's also a stronger alcohol as well. Overall, an average Eastern European strong lager."
"Pale golden straw - belies the weight of the flavor. Tons of fruity esters in the aroma - very German weizen. Flavor is chock full of fruity, bubblegum and Juicyfruit gum flavors. What there is of English on the label indicates this is an ""ale beer"" - not much insight into the style. I don't think I've run across something so full of fruity esters that wasn't some sort of weizen or Belgian variation. Defies easy classification. Alcohol is a fairly noteworthy flavoring component, but not too distracting. An interesting beer."
"Notes: Hmm, can you say “imported malt liquor”? Not bad hooch at all. Big alcohol kick with a decent drinkability. Sorry does not come in 40 oz bottles. They probably were not thinking about boys in the hood drinking their four o’s but this stuff is pretty damn close to it."
