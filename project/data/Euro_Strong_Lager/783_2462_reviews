"The moral of this story...before you buy a beer, take a look at the list of ingredients. I should have been tipped off by the 'glucose syrup' and 'maize' as to the quality of this beer. Faxe sells for $3.35 per 500 ml...a premium price for non-premium quality."

"For getting drunk this thing will do the trick in a pinch, just like a malt liquor in the states. And like a malt liquor, it does what it sets out to do very well. Sitting here buzzed I can say that it worked. Outside of that, nothing special. Get a couple of regular beers to achieve the same effect without the taste..."

"Quick fading slightly off white head settles quickly over clear gold with light amber highlights. Sweet sharp/perfumy nose, I get a light whiff of fruit too...very slight adjuncty note. Taste is lightly fruity at first then you get a sharp metallic hop attack that tastes kinda 'off', semi full bodied, lingering sharpness and as it warms you get some adjunct flavor and then cheap alcohol. Ends sharp and none too appealing. Drink it cold or pass lol"

"O- Unless you find pleasure in unpleasant experiences or view the taste of urine as a worthy venture I would advise everyone to avoid this beer."

"I have to be honest, I'm presently drinking a 500 ml can of Faxe 10% Extra Strong Beer, that I won in a bet over the Stanley Cup playoffs (go Blackhawks!). I am a Viking at heart, so the logo's kind of cool. I like the color as it resembles someone else's clear healthy urine specimen on the nurses station counter top. The aroma is reminiscent of the bed pads I wash in the long term care facility laundry room that I currently work in, so it is familiar and quite nutty, i might add. The taste is somewhat marmaladish, leaving me with a comforting tingly sensation on my palate, satisfying my desire for the bold, pungent flavor I was expecting in a beer of this strength. It is perfectly carbonated, boasting 43 tiny bubbles (no, 44...there's 45, 46, ..47, 48) that ascend into a beautiful 2 finger head with an eyelet lace. As i sip again, I am noticing something else... ..I think it is a hint of cabbage (or perhaps rhubarb) that seems to settle into a delightfully smooth aftertaste that lingers on. I actually really like this beer and don't mind the intensity as it becomes closer to room temperature. The ABV is high but the price is low ($3.35) so it is perfect for anyone who wants a good beer buzz early in the morning before going to their McJob. Don't get me wrong, I would definitely drink Faxe 10 again, especially knowing that I only need one can to forget about the bad day I may have had washing the linens in a nursing home. Ok, so here's the bottom of the can. ...last drop..alrighty then, there you have it. Faxe 10 is ok, if you ask me. Now i'm ready to tuck in."

"Overall: An assault on good taste. Could barely finish 1/4 of it before drain pouring it."

"Overall- A decent attempt at a strong lager from Faxe. Although this is high in ABV it was quite drinkable. Could be better balanced but decent job overall. Not too crazy about this one but it was good to try. Worth another try in the future for something different."
""
"O - This brings me back to my high school days of drinking Old English before the dance. Anything to get a buzz on with no care for taste. I'm surprised there's a customer base for this brew, because it's terrible."
""
"What a fucking mess - why there isn't a European category of cheap (is there any other kind) malt liquors, I'll never know. Overall, this is sickly, pandering, and barely less than gag-inducing. A whole bloody liter of this dreck is way more than wishful thinking, my Danish friends - I respectfully request my kroner back."
"starts with bitterness than quickly turns into the taste of ethanol. all i taste in this beer is alcohol. it is awful. not going to finish this crap. blech"
"Overall: I don't think I want to finish this liter can of very bad beer. The metallic twang is quite strong, and the adjunct character is off-putting. My advice: This is one for lying down and avoiding."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the wide range of aromas and flavorings. For such a strong beer it provided a wide range of grainy flavors to work with. Among these there was a surprising ester character to soften up the beginning, while a more biting hop presence took up the final legs. This is a perfect beer if you’re wandering around the streets of Rome looking for a party, but nothing you would want to sit back with and relax."
"O: Well, a poor product; unbalanced. I guess this is brewed for those who likes to get drunk at a low cost."
"Overall: Unbalanced, artificial, watery chemical beer. Don’t even bother to try"
"O: This is probably going to be the worst rating I’ve ever produced on this site. Avoid this stuff at all costs, unless you like pain and want to melt your mouth and gut. Scary stuff."
"Colt 45 is much better than Faxe 10%"
"Drinkability: Yes I am a college student and as any good student I do enjoy a periodic booze-up. But even if I was very well intoxicated and this was all that there was, I wouldn't drink it."
"Drain pour."
"Can: Poured a golden yellow color beer with a quite large frothy pure white head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of alcoholic phenols with some grossly sweet adjunct. Taste is also dominated by grossly sweetened adjunct with some very apparent alcohol. Body has an oily texture with good carbonation. I wasn't' expected much but this is a lot worse then I had expected with loads of alcohol and adjunct easily detectable -drain pour."
"lets face it this is a vikings drink, or wanna be vikings drink. from the appearance of the can you know your in for it. its scary. i still will drink faxe extra strong just because im cheap and for $3.15 at the beer store im in."
"Well, nothing extra in this beer... just a simple beer. Nothing more nothing less."
"Ingredients listed: Water, malt, glucose syrup, corn, and finally hops."
"This is the ultimate beer for a cheap buzz, get one down and its smooth sailing."
"lets just slam the ones that make us shart!"
"Overall, okay, but not great. I would expect more from the Faxe Brewery!"
"500mL Can. This beer serves one purpose, quick intoxication on a tight budget. Excellent for those college students who are looking for just that. However, for a beer of higher ABV, it remains decently drinkable and does make an excellent night cap. All in all, great fro college students, decent as a single serving night closer."
"It's malt liquor. From Europe. So it's classy malt liquor. Light yellow, with a small amount of head that quickly disappears. Smell reminded me of cheap wine, oddly. Sweet. I guess it's malty sweet, but I've never detected malts that were so winelike. Alcohol smell as well. Like one would find in... Cheap wine. Taste wasn't too bad. Very sweet, but not sickly sweet. Slight metallic twang as well. Mouthfeel was, oddly enough, very smooth. Slight bitter aftertaste, more from the alcohol than any hops used. If any hops were used at all. It's one of the better malt liquors I've had, but it's still malt liquor. Cheap, high alcohol beer meant to get you drunk. Not meant to be enjoyed."
"To be honest. I'm afraid to try this beer again."
"Worst beer ever."
"A can or two of this can get you a really good buzz, which is probably the only reason to drink it. If your looking to get super drunk super fast then I would recommend this, otherwise, why not get some fine scotch?"
"Pours a thick amber with a white head that fades quickly. Smells strongly of alcohol, grain, and hops. The taste is rather overwhelmed by the alcohol, and is quite bitter. The beer is sticky in the mouth, and difficult to drink, which is probably good, because I had a decent buzz after finishing the pint. More than two or three of these and I'd be pretty loaded, which is pretty much the point I think, and the reason that my college town liquor store has so much in stock."
"This brew is only worth buying if you want to get wasted and want a beer that I'm sure has just been mixed with wood alcohol"
"Minimum aroma and flavour, raw hard alcohol mouth feel. No sublety, no dimension. And not even really much of a skullcrusher when it's all said and done."
"Drinkability: Quite strange for a beer. Ok, that's a strong lager, but it's like an alcohoolic soda. It could be ok to get loaded fast, but for quality drinking, I would choose something else. In the strong beers category, it seems that Unibroue products are much better..."
"Thanks to trbeer for this one (no, seriously!). Well, it's not terrible, but not exactly great either. A definite vegetable flavor mixed with the higher alcohol....if I was looking for super malt liquor, this might be it, but other than that, I tried it but seriously doubt I'd look for this again. Well, at least I didn't have to support the evil Carlsburg empire to get a review from Denmark"
"Pours an attractive clear amber with a rapidly dissipating white head. Aroma of hops and whoa! Too much alcohol! Taste was very strong bitter nasty alcohol and a bit of hops. Mouthfeel was stingy and awkward. I used to love this stuff, but now I don't know, I think they changed it. This brew has degraded into a ""choke it down and get drunk fast"" beer... What a shame."
"This beer pours a surprisingly deep gold color with a decent off white head and plenty of lace streaks. Strangely, I only saw about five bubble while looking into the glass for a while. Maybe I got a poorly packaged can. The smell is of caustic overwhelming alcohol and some slight saltyness. The taste begins with a massive hit of alcohol fire then trails of into some alcohol spicyness and German malts. The hops are very weak and only detectable in their bittering potential. The mouthfeel is pretty nasty, it makes me think of an 'aluminum aged' beer for some reason. The alcohol is noticeable though this beer is pretty cheap (though I think Kasteel Brune is still a little cheaper, and a far better beer). Its subpar, though strong."
"One would expect something boasting a 10% ABV to have the appearance other than that of Budweiser. Sadly, such is not the case from this brew from Denmark. It poured a clear, fizzy yellow in color with a crackling short-lived white head. Aromas are sweet...not a malty sweet but a candy factory sweetness. Flavor is nasty. A grainy-corny front that is quickly shoved aside by a sickly sweetness that gets worse as it warmed up. Finishes with a most unpleasant alcohol burn, much like wood feels when paint remover is applied to it. Syrupy mouthfeel and virtually no drinkability. On the plus side, I've now tried a beer from Denmark."
"Yaaaughhhhashuuhhhg...muuuwaaghrg...gakkk/ Now to fill the 75 character requirement is a rendition of the London philharmonics last rendering of Mozarts Salzberg jam at the yakking bird as transposed for the hummer...yaaaammmm...da da da..yas hummm yackghtchhhh...and YES as long as you ask....I DID pour it down the sink after only 3 ""hits""...corn doesn't even taste this bad in ""shine""."
"Pours a pale sick yellow colour with a thick foamy head that dissapates into a skeleton of itself. Smells like corn, cut grass, musty urine (oh, what a plus.... ha ha). Has a slick mouthfeel with average carbonation. The taste is one of high alcohol and horrible syrupy badness. It's a bit like a medicine. I could detect a faint grape tart to it. This beer is very sticky. No thanks."
"A pretty pour with a high ABV that you can definetly taste. This is a brew that opens your eyes and is not for the timid!!! Unfortunately is not for me either....Wrap a brown paper bag around this one."
"Another flavorful, but powerful Extra Strong Lager from Denmark. Tasty and refreshing, with no objectionable after tastes or smells."
