"O - Nothing really special. Usual lager, which will probably be good when you feel thirsty."

"Easy drinking and nice foreign brew that's a fun talking point."
"Makes me want to travel Lithuania to get more."
"A friend recently gave me some Lithuanian beers to try, and this was the second one I tried. Poured into a tall pilsener glass. It's a brown bottle, but pours with a very pale yellow color for a 7.3% beer. Lots of champagne-like carbonation. Decent sized head, and moderate amounts of lacing. Smell was boozy. Taste was like a macro lager, with lots of corn and malt. There was a lot more alcohol ester up front on this one. Also, this beer was sticky sweet on the palate. The combination of the sweetness and the alcohol were not overly pleasurable. This beer is drinkable, but I would not opt for a second bottle in a row. I preferred the Kalnapilis Grand over this one."
"On a side note: I wrote this review while having a bottle of it right next to me (just a few sips left) so all the experiences are refreshed (actually they are just as I remember them). Also I want to say that I drank it straight from the bottle so I can't confirm what it looks like poured"
"Overall - I find it interesting this beer won a gold medal in the world beer cup (according to the bottle). It's not completely terrible, but it's not so good either. It was cheap though. Finishable, but I wouldn't buy it again. I'd honestly take a marco-lager over this. Not recommended."
"At first I was about ready to write this one off - but after a few more sips I found myself liking it a bit more. Poured with a nice off white medium head that quickly subsides to a thin cover and no lace. Color is a clear straw yellow. Aroma is malty sweet with a hint of hop. Flavor at first is like aroma, but then gives way to a slight bitterness in the end. Mouth is decent and so is carbonation. Finsih is on the short side, clean, and fair. I could drink a few more with no problems if there wasn't something with a little more character available."
"A good beer as long as you don't get offended by style definitions."
"D: It would make a lovely gift to your alcoholic uncle, if you can wrest that bottle of Steel Reserve from his soused clutches."
"Pours out in a light yellow color with a thin head. Has a slight tin taste and a mild but lingering after taste. I chose this beer because I enjoy lagers and have not had a Lithuanian. Was not impressed, but it was cold and crisp. Could use a more difinitive taste that doesn't hang around as long."
"Light bodied beer that taste cheap, I'm not really impressed with this beer but it is cold and does quench my thirst, although it leaves some unpleasant aftertaste."
"There is nothing special in drinkability and mouthfeel."
"D: If I stuck with this beer all night long. I'd suffer through the worst hangover in the history of mankind tomorrow. I'll be thankful that this is my only bottle and I'll pray that my Lithuanian brothers embrace the craft movement."
"This is simply a terrible, terrible beer."
"D: This beer started out OK. The odd metal and veggie flavors aren't that present while this beer is cold. As it warms; however, the beer becomes rather unpleasant. It's not wince inducing, but it's still not enjoyable. In the end, this is another mediocre Euro Lager."
"Drinkability: Not bad for a beer thats 7.3% abv."
"Hopefully Lithuania keeps the good stuff to themselves because this export is mediocre at best."
"D: Average drinkability, and definitely one of the better beers out of Lithuania, though wouldn't rush out and buy a sixer. Won gold in the world beer cup 2004."
"Kalnapilis Original is a better beer, but this one is worth at least a try."
"Notes: This is a very basic or average strong Euro Lager."
"D: For what it is it is a very drinkable beer. Not sure I would ever buy it again but I would totally house this during an open bar. Much better options out there."
"Eastern European Malt Liquor , its a wonderful thing."
"D - An average strong Euro lager, not bad, not good. I would probably choose to not drink this again."
"16.9 oz brown bottle ($1.99) poured a deeper gold color into glass mug but rest of appearance similar to other US macrobrews - large white bubbles make up a one inch head that quickly dissipates. Smell is nonspecific malty smell with a harsh undertone. Taste follows smell in this one and flavor is malty with a background bitterness that hangs around too long on the palate and alcohol seems to come through too much due to lack of competing flavors. With the amount of medium-low amount of carbonation and the flavor, i agree with past reviews that this should be served cold. Overall, this beer drinks easily cold and gives you more ounce per ounce alcohol, but the bland malty flavor and bitter aftertaste will not have me returning."
"Kalnapilis 7.30 is roughly equivalent to a better than average American malt liquor in terms of quality and drinkability. Even though I'll never be a fan of this style, I can see how Lithuanians looking to get blitzed might find this to be a better alcohol delivery system than most."
"Kalnapilis 7.30 pours a pale yellow with a very minimal white head from a brown half liter bottle. The aroma is inoffensive, a bit malty I'd say. The taste is on the malty side, alcohol is strongly noticeable. This is on par with an American malt liquor. There really is no reason to recommend this beer, your money would be better spent elsewhere. Average at best."
"Honestly, this is about what I was expecting from this beer: drinkable but not real good."
"Pours a medium golden straw with medocire bubbling and a sub-par head. The aroma is like adjuncty corn on the cob with some hints of rice and some pale malts. A little earthy overall. The flavor was mostly pale malt, sunflower, adjuncts, and alcohol. Not brow furrowing at all. Just pretty run of the mill."
" I don't really know my Euro Strong Lagers too well, I can only hope the others are better than this offering from our Lithuanian friends."
"Sticky mouthfeel with little carbonation. I drank just enough (about 6oz) to do this review; and now I will dump the rest. If I were drunk and needed to get drunker, this may work. Otherwise, no thanks Kalnapilis."
"Actually drinks okay despite all that, worse beers out there, Keep this ice cold it will hold up for a few, better cheap baltic beers out there! But who knows? if you get this fresher like globetrotter; might be a different animal. Just didn't migrae to CO very well..."
"D- This is a very smooth light beer. It really lacks good flavors of malt and hops. There is no character or depth to this beer. The label says it is a 2004 World Beer Cup Gold mentalist but I can't get excited about any of the flavors or more specific the lack of flavor."
"Sinkability  I hate to pour the 2004 World Beer Cup Gold Award winner down the pipes, but I just couldnt finish it."
"Pours an attractive clear deep copper-tinted gold under a one finger white head with very good retention and some pretty nice lacing. The nose is all sweet barley. The mouth is medium-bodied and quite prickly. The tongue is greeted by a good smooth malt opening, followed by a pleasant if slightly metallic hoppy bite and just a hint of alcohol. The finish emphasizes the bitter, which has already mellowed considerably. The aftertaste consists of a slight bite at the back of the jowls. Not harsh, not overly alcoholic, not sour - this is a very good rendition of the style."
