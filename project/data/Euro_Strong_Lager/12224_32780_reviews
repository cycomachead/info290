"I will congratulate you if you could finish this one. I do not like it and finishing it is really tough."

"O: Very easy drinking, this beer does well at hiding the 9.5% alcohol. Not overly complex, but a good enjoyable lager. This doesn't get much love on BA but I can recommend it."

"Overall – not a bad brew, really. Not quite what I was expecting, but that led to a pleasant surprise."
"Overall: Strong lager with some deceptiveness and good character."
"Slightly murky butterscotch with blonde highlights on the edges of the glass and a fluffy eggshell head that leaves scraps of lace on the glass. The nose is pure candy, maybe banana Airheads or something with fruity esters and a touch of grain alcohol. Sweet and fruity with some juicy-fruit and a touch of herbal hops but not really enough to balance, this is a high alcohol malt bomb for sure with a distinct caramel apple finish. Medium bodied and with sharp carbonation and alcoholic heat. Better than some of these crazy high octane Euro Malt Liquors and not entirely unpleasant, but don't ever drink more than one in a sitting."
"Overall: In spite of my earlier trepidation I am enjoying this strong lager. This is a malty alcoholic monster that will reappear in place of malt liquor."
"Poured with a thick foamy, frothy, cream colored, sudsy head and some lace. Color is a clear medium amber with some chunky bit of sediment. Aroma is beery, sweet malt, and a bit of soap. Flavor is heavy malt, sweet, with a little hop bitterness. Body is malt heavy and good carbonation; good for the style. Finish is like flavor and like boozer's beer. Not for me."
"Drinkability: Drain-pour."
"Contained in 0.5 liter brown bottle. Pours as a urine colored yellow with a minimal head which melts away to nothing. Aroma is sweet, almost floral, with a hint of adjuncts and hops. Taste is light and mildly sweet and hoppy. The light body is without merit and leaves little trace of anything. At a cost of $2.49 a bottle, I expected more but this brew does not deliver anything that would induce me to recommend it to others."
"An interesting and enjoyable beer (for some). Deep-gold/amber body beneath a creamy head of gently off-white. Fair head retention, and average lacing. The aroma is floral and fruity with a waft of alcohol over a sweetish malt base, and it at times seems a bit fruit-candy-ish. That carries over into the finish, and it ends with a sweet note of fruit candy, as well as a bit of grassy, gently spicy, and mildly herbal hops that fade to leave behind a note of sweet licorice. There's a pretty good deal of malt to it as well, and it's like candy-coated caramel. Full bodied, but also strong (9.5%), and backed by a stiff bitterness that cuts through the middle but just can't hold on. Sweetish? Yes! But not too unlike many Russian/eastern European strong ales. It's done in that vein. The difference is that there's a bit more caramel malt here, and the hops are not as herbal as usual. So, OK, onwards to drinkability. Well, for this style it's pretty good. The beers from this part of the world are pretty 'different', but at the same time, we're not all from there, and to a lot of us it seems sweetish-malty. It actually tastes a little like there was some propylene glycol added to it to give it a little bit of a kick! Yeah, I guess it's got a hint of a medicinal edge too. Not enough to kill you though ;) If you're familiar with beers done in this vein you'll know what you're getting into. If you're not, and you're used to more focused and balanced beers stay away."

"True to the scent, it had a very malty taste. Solid is about the best way I can describe it. Much better than an American Macro Lager, but leaves a strange taste in the back of the mouth. While it has many of the elements of a Macro, the malts separate this beer."
"Appearance: An amber hue with little to no head. The nose is hops, malt and yeast. The taste is a very strong version of bud. A very well balanced and very tasty beer. You can taste the malt and a bit of hops. The finish is clean with a bit of a bitterness."
"D--I'll pass. Ok...maybe as a mid-party 3am desperation beer."
"Dinkability is not really awful, so I finished it, but I will not buy another. It is maybe two points above being a sink pour. Glad for the experience. Be warned. If you have an extra couple of bucks to experiment on new beer, try something else first."
"It comes from my homeland, but the truth is, I kind of wish it stayed there. It's thin, with little true character, and it seems to be the equivalent of a Lithuanian macro. It is drinkable? Well, sure, you could say that, but so is brackish water, in a pinch. So I'll finish this bottle and consider it a lesson learned."
"Always looking for new beers to try, I found this beer recently at my fav liquor store, grouped with Russian beers as this is surely the only Lithuanian beer marketed in the US. This beer came with a special hard to miss tag advertising the alcohol content as 9.5% ... it showed. I was surprised upon pouring the beer that it poured a nice copper colour, I guess I was expecting something much darker. The beer certainly smelled of alcohol, but not nearly what I was expecting. The initial mouthfeel was decent considering the alcohol content ... but the aftertaste was excessively strong malt and alcohol, with the sweetness of honey. Sorry, but I would advise against this beer, perhaps fine for those Lithuanian winters when one runs out of vodka, but just too much of an alcohol taste for my likes."
"Drinkability is not great, a good beer to try and expand your palate, but not a brew I would like to have more than a small glass of."
"For $1.70 a 500ml, put one in your tasting club, theyll be surprised with it. I was."
"I don't hate it but I won't buy this again."
"Mouthfeel is average, I suppose. I do not see myself drinking many of these. I have another warm on in storage, and I will be in no big hurry to get it."
"Aiko pours a light orange color with a white head from a half liter brown bottle. The aroma is quite malty in a typical Eastern European way. Also quite malty in the flavor which is on the sweet end. There is a bit of fruitiness in the flavor. Alcohol is fairly well concealed. Not bad for what it is. Worth a try if you like Eastern European lagers."
"Upon pouring from the bottle, the glass was filled with an amber color with very little head. The first smell I detected was that of malt and barley, this was later verified upon first taste. On the tongue and in the mouth, the beer was crisp and refreshing. As mentioned before, there was a good amount of malts and barley which gave the beer a sweet taste that did an excellent job of masking the 9.5 abv. I was very impressed with this find."
"Kept this one around for awhile before drinking - Kept thinking of some of the other strong European lagers that I have had and figuring it would be the same - Not quite the case - Poured a nice clear amber with little head - Aroma was quite bready with hints of bubble gum - Taste was quite similar with maybe a bit of banana thrown in - Tended toward the sweet which covered the alcohol well - Not sessionable but quite worth the effort"
"Pours a golden amber with semi-light sudsy foam which dissipates quickly. First taste is that of grape kool-aid, a hint of root beer, malt and barley. A bit on the sweeter side but brought back into balance with a good dose of malted barley. Lists a 9.5%abv but it is covered extremely well. Only a slight note of alcohol is detected."
