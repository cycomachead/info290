"O - This is better than I imagined. To me it has a similar flavor profile to a barrel aged wee heavy. Wolverine State does a fantastic job brewing lagers. The more I try from them, the more I like them."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 10/2014. Pours nearly opaque very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big chocolate, caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, brown bread, vanilla, coconut, oak, bourbon, and oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big chocolate, caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, brown bread, vanilla, coconut, oak, bourbon, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light tannic oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, brown bread, vanilla, coconut, oak, bourbon, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged doppelbock style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Wow I was pretty far off. This is Massacre, an Imperial Dark lager aged in bourbon barrels from Wolverine State Brewing Co. So yeah… wow. Knowing what this is, as I’m drinking it, maybe I can get bourbon in place of the fruity/maple sweetness? I get essentially zero vanilla though. I don’t have much experience with infection, but maybe there’s some acetaldedehyde involved here that led me to green apples? I’ve had a few bourbon barrel-aged lagers from Jack’s Abby, but this doesn’t resemble any of them, and one was a barrel-aged doppelbock (which is close enough to this style). Maybe it’s just really heavy on the fusel alcohols and not very good… Thanks for the interesting beer Abraxel."
"Mouthfeel is fine, maybe a bit thin."

"O: I like this beer. I’m a fan. It’s not the most jam packed full of crazy type beer, but it has great barrel flavor and it’s smooth. I’d drink this again, no problem at all. I really enjoyed this beer. It’s not overly packed with packed a ton of different flavors, but if I was in the mood for a BA beer. I’d grab one of these. Solid stuff. I’m happy to have tried it."
