review_text
"This beer was poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass and inebriated me at apx 55F."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Almost clear, amber color.  Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight grassy nose and flavor is a lot of caramel sweetness hiding the very high ABV. Strange, sweet bitter aftertaste.  $4.80 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"They are who they thought it would be."
"So everyone of us who are rating this beer are doing so because we bought it because of the high ABV.  At 15% this is almost as high as it gets but that's where the positives pretty much end.  This beer has a putrid aroma.  It smells rotten, I had to check the dates to make sure it was still drinkable.  It poured a nice golden color, had way too much carbonation and a decent amount of lace.  It is too sweet to enjoy and very acidic and pungent.  Has a very strong and bitter taste similar to sulfur.  While it is still better than a Bud Light, I would only recommend getting this for the novelty factory."

"3 sips and had to dump it down the drain.  The worst beer I've ever tasted!"

"O: 1/5 -- $3 at 15% piqued my interest. Hadn't heard of brewery, and the label seemed promising. I was swindled. It's possibly one of the worst beverages I've ever had. I struggled through half of a 16.9oz bottle before finally dumping it, which I always try to avoid. I wonder if this is brewed as some kind of cruel joke. If I could go back and un-purchase it, I would. It's definitely crazy, so I guess mission accomplished."
