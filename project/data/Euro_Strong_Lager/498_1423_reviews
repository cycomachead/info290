"today I had this beer. First impression is soft, but last taste was little bitter. Just exactly same taste with So-Mac(usually drink soju+beer in Korea). but more soft better than So-Mac."

"Poured a tall 500 ml can into a pint glass. ""Why am I drinking this?"" crosses my mind. A bright yellow hue with a crazy amount of beige foam ... Looks a lot like ginger ale. Smell is almost non-existent with the exception of a corn sugar sweetness accompanied by a twinge of wet grain. Tastes like vodka-harsh boiled grains, chalky grape juice or sour hard candy, and anemic grassy hops. Less sweet and perhaps just a smidgen more refined than American malt liquors but the same basic idea. A notable industrial alcohol warmth emerges and I am thinking that this is reminiscent of a very low-rent imperial pilsener. Watery body is coupled with the expected aggressive carbonation, and there's a hint of peppery spice that you don't get in North American brewed cheap beers. Finishes crisp but with more residual sweetness than a Euro pale lager, grainy with an echo of saccharine fruitiness. Basically the intent of such a beer is to provide a cheap intoxicant, a la North American malt liquors. It probably suits this purpose admirably and tastes marginally better than its New World cousins. That's the best that can be said."
"Could be worse..."

"Golden color with an one finger head with low retention but leaving some laces. Light aroma of pale malt, bread and vanilla. Malty flavor with notes of apple juice. Hints of minerals, vodka and syrup. Light body with good carbonation. Relatively smooth body given wheat addition and 7.9% ABV is surprisingly well hidden. I was expecting a blunt Malt Liquor with unpleasant flavors, but although plain and lacking hops, it is relatively decent for the style."

"Final Grade: 2.3, an embarrassing D+. The thing that impresses me most about Bavaria 8.6 is probably the drinkability; it basically just tastes sweet and wet, and even though you can tell the alcohol is there (and it will hit you eventually), this is definitely not an especially raunchy-tasting lager considering the abv. Reminds me a little of Boxer Ice, with its weird, fruity, funky off-tastes. I worked at a liquor store in Alberta that sold these; the only customers I ever saw purchase them were homeless people and 'regulars' (alcoholics). Two of these might give you a decent buzz for 4-5 bucks, but Warka Strong can do the same while allowing you to retain your self-respect for the rest of the night. I'd only drink this again if I were pretty desperate."

"Pale golden colour, 1.5 fingers of white head, decent amount of retention and lace. Smell is grainy with apple juice like scents, malty followed immediately by alcohol, dirty water like scents come in, earthy and muddy as well. Taste is grainy and metallic, more of that muddy earth that was in the nose, apple juice, light alcohol but surprisingly well hidden. Medium carbonation, med-full body, decent enough feel. This was pretty bad but I finished the can off without a problem, I would probably never buy this again but I didn't mind drinking it once."

"Overall â€“ I had very low expectations for this beer but ti actually turned out to be fairly decent. The alcohol isn't as noticeable as I thought it would be, and the beer had a fantastic appearance ion the glass. not sure I'd buy it again, but I'm glad I gave it a shot."
"Overall I was a bit underimpressed with this as a specialty beer, but as a macro lager, I was quite pleased."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the boldness of the flavor. While there was not much there to pick apart, the flavors presented came through with a surprising strength. Where it started to become unpleasant was when, at the tail end of the middle, the alcoholic burn took over the entire flavor, turning it into straight liquor."
"Overall, this is a cheap and powerful beer for those who are embarrassed with buying malt liquor. When it comes to strong beer, it's a little to thick and sweet for my taste."
"Dr: I'd have it again to get drunk. At this price range, its high ABV is quite welcome. I appreciate beers that experiment, but this one is a failure."
"D - I would definitely not recommend anyone pick up a can, but it wasn't a drain pour, and I was easily able to take down the can. Taste is a bit of a turn off, and all other characteristics were lacking, with the only respectable category being appearance."
"Well, it is a cheap beer, so what should you expect. And it is nearly 8% ABV. Pours a medium golden clear color into my pint glass. Actually gave me alot of head that did stick to the glass. Not much in the smell arena, can barely smell anything. Tast is warming, kinda like a bud with a shot of vodka in it. Mouth feelis light to medium bodied. Drinkability is average. Due to the high ABV, stop at one and get something better to drink."
"Musty smell of old cellar and the old nose with ripe fruit and macerated in alcohol too. A very hot mouth with alcohol in abundance in the aftertaste which is reminiscent of the liquor or white wine rich in sugars and highly concentrated. Easily digestible and easy to drink little, even if it sits right in terms of tasting."
"An average Euro Strong Lager. I didn't find it very enjoyable, but it is pretty par for the course in comparison to others of the style I have tried."
"D-Medium-low drinkability. There are clearly more drinkable macro lager brews available down in Mexico, but this one certainly takes the cake for size of flavors. Regretably, the flavors are shadowed by the harshness of the moderately high ABV."
"looks great but it makes you gag as you swallow and that's a trait I don't like in my beer"
"The Beer Store find. This is a pale Euro lager with extra diesel fuel alcohol. Pours light with generous white bubbled head. Some alcohol in aroma. Thin mouthfeel, not much in taste, just enough malt, and some apple juice to swallow a decent sample. Rest drain poured."
"As is by now probably blindingly obvious, the elevated ABV here isn't very well integrated, rendering a pretty hot lager beer experience - not a good thing. This is a favourite, from what I can tell, even at my local bottleshop, amongst the more shabbily attired, single brand purchasers of note. I can see why, given its relatively inexpensive shelf tag, and overall oomph - all fine, as long as your taste buds take a sick day. Oh - and this is still markedly better than anything Minhas puts out around here."
"It's not completely without merit, but it's the last one I'll ever have."
"Summary- If the frat is looking to get wild this weekend without the typical 40oz of malt liquor or the kegs of iced beer. This is the brew for you. Its a little strong, but hey for tailgating grab a few and you will not be any more disappoint then your other offerings. C for so-so and a + for the style of high gravity lager"
"This is clearly the worst beer I have had in quite some time. The only point I can see to this beer is to get lager louts smashed."
"Plus: I fear this beer could give you a headache before the end of the evening, if you try more than 1 bottle."
"Overall, if not for the bad taste, the beer could be quite ok."
"This beer is not a chore, but a far cry from a pleasure to drink. I will avoid, and recommend you do the same."
"Drinkability : a not impressed beer in the style strong lager (too strong 7.9 ABV)."
"Worst beer I've had in years."
"Now, in the mouth is watery, sweet and some citruses and spices, it tastes very artificial. Yes, I can drink it again, but why bother?"
"It poured with a rocky two fingers' of bone-white head with low retention. The nose had a sweetish, metallic quality which was undesirable. The color was a deep-golden shade with NE-quality clarity, The mouthfeel was medium with a taste like corn and metal. Not what I was after! The finish was mildly sweet, lager-like, but mostly verboten."
"For a strong beer, this isn't too bad in the way of drinkability. It still retains crisp freshness, but a little to strong to make this a session beer."
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a decent amount of bubbly white head that sticks around for a while. Smells like an empty glass. Tastes fairly sweet, but not malty. Hard to describe, nondescript sweetness, I guess. No hop flavor to speak of. There is some alcohol burn there, but that's to be expected. Mouthfeel is watery and... that's about it. I swear, budweiser has more flavor than this beer. There's nothing to it at all. Overall, it's drinkable, because there's no flavor to object to. I prefer my beer to taste like beer, though. This seems to be for pretentious college kids that want to get hammered fast."
"i dont know about this in a can though..."
"Drinkability: Not bad. Rochefort beats this of course. Didn't detect any chemical overtones. Perhaps they have process control issues."
"This is somewhat of a mixed review. I love certain aspects of this beer whilst I dislike others. Overall appearance is great, even the can feels like good quality...LOL. Great tasting beer and very sweet, however, I dislike the strong aftertaste, which is probably so overpowering due to the higher alcohol content. Personally I have never been able to consume more than two cans at one sitting. Overall, a respectable beer, but IMHO, not everybodys cup of tea."
"Overall: too sweet for my taste. No hops to help balance it. Probably my last one."
"Another example of a mass-produced strong lager. It's a golden-yellow colored brew, with a puffy white head. Clear and simple in appearance. Not much of an aroma. A little grain and a lot of alcohol. Almost no hop aroma, and no real malt smell. The taste is pretty unimpressive. Lots of sweetness up front, followed by a serious harshness. A lot of warming and rough alcohol is the center of the experience with this beer. Between that and the sweetness, which occurs without any real flavor, this beer is a real disappointment."
"Drinkability: Although it proclaims itself a ""blond," Bavaria 8.6 is a malt liquor all the way. Taking that into consideration, the taste performs pretty well for the style. Filling, as would be expect, and not that easy to get down after awhile, but not altogether bad."
"Overall not very good. But for Euro 1.30 not a bad bag."
"Bavaria 8.6 is just plain raunchy and vulgar."
"D - Bad. I doubt I'll finish this bomber."
"Oh yeah, the bottled version of this beer definitely makes a difference. Avoid the cans altogether."
"This is a beer designed to get you drunk fast. It is drinkable though not as good as Faxe Extrastrong. The beer has a definite alcohol presence that makes the going down a little harsh. The main body is almost malt liqour mixed with Euro lager. Only just drinkable and if you want strong cheap lager try the Faxe."
"Drinkable? Hell no! Usually a headache arrives after sleeping your beer off. This thing gives an instant headache, halfway through. If you don't like yourself, this is your beer."
"650ml bomber bottle. This is a second revisiting of this beer. This time around I can see some value if a big smooth beer like this. It does fill a niche'....for those times you may want a strong warming beer without the heaviness of dopplebocks or the alki-burn of malt liquor. This is really not a badly constructed beer....lots of malt give it a frothy cap, good lacing and a good bready-malt presense in the taste and the hops are light yet herbal and understated....together they hide the alcohol well....smooth mouth feel, mellow malty taste and the alcohols only show up at the end where a pronounced banana taste betrays the phenol alcohol. Very much like a sweet hight test Grolsch....one of the better strong pilsners from europe."
"500 ml can with best before date stamped on bottom. Pretty much know what to expect when the label is a huge ""8.6"" announcing it's strong alcohol content. Clear yellow/pale gold with big bubbly head that quickly dissipates. I think there was some corn aroma but the alcohol smell overpowered it. TAste was somewhat smooth in the middle but there was quite an alcohol aftertaste. Nothing really special - best compared to American malt liquor. Best to follow the directions on the can and ""serve cool""."
"Drinkable. sort of, but it is merely a small step up from some U.S. renditions of completely adjuncted, cheapo piss...errr...malt liquor.."
"pours a pale golden color with a big bubbly head that dissappears quickly but leaves lots of lace behind. The smell is of straw, biscuity malts and solvent-like alcohol. The taste is chock full of corn and alcohol with some pleasant bread and noble hop notes (believe it or not). The mouthfeel is pretty smooth. The aftertaste is too alcoholly, ruining the drinkability. This beer doesnt hide its ABV one bit, in fact it projects it."
"Strong lagers like this are generally cheap and for getting as pissed as quickly as possible, not very nice but not terrible"
"This would make a great beer to threaten someone with, or to get back at them (simply offer them one). Poured from a 500 ml can, freshness date on the bottom. It looks harmless enough, nice clear golden body, good head that forms a cap and some decent lacing. Smells like cotton candy however. Flavour is indescribably bad, really, I lack the vocabulary to even begin, as I've never had anything quite this awful, no sounding board to compare it to. I'm honestly going to have to pour this one out, I feel dirty on the inside already. Beware of Bavaria 8.6, consider yourself warned."
"The taste, hummmm, this is controversial. It could've been much better had it properly hidden the alcohol in the beer. It's too present and spoils much of the other tastes as well as the mouth (and hey, nose) feel. Of course, the other tastes are nothing great either. The beer is waaaay too sweet and doesn't properly balance the hops which are very slightly felt at the end. Its not a great beer, really...the combination gets me thinking on a Cuba Libre! how not beer wise."
"Drinkability....poor."
"Yikes, way too sweet and the alcohol shows too much, bloody god damn awful, i took about 2 sips, before ouring the rest down the sink, one of the worst beers you'll ever have, no joke."
"Strong, but a lousy example from Holland.  This brew's flavor is typical of a cheap US malt liquor."
