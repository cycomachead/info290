"Good beer with thin taste"

"Pours a crystal clear amber with a fizzy white head,  aroma was stronger than expected and got to me even as I poured.  That being said, the aroma is nothing spectacular, just prevalent.  I can't even really pick out a certain scent, not that I have the best nose for it anyways, but it smells like any AAL you might bother pouring in a glass.  Taste is equally unspectacular.  Anyone that has had the bad luck to try a regular Cruzcampo would recognize the lack of taste outside of a metallic, coppery finish, there is a hint of a sweet malt profile trying to sneak through.  The increased alcohol brings some body that is welcomed.  Overall, not great, but much more palatable than its humble cousin and hey it's super cheap and 6.4%."

"330ml can. Stange glass. Deep golden color, crystal clear appearance. Close crown, white froth. Honey, herbal & alcoholic aromas. As expected, it shows cloying flavors & intense alcoholic heat. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Watery texture. Grainy flavor & harsh herbal bitterness linger in long sweety alcoholic finish & aftertaste. Unbalanced."

"Smell is mostly from yeast, herbal, and something that reminds me of detergent. In mouth you can feel that, but also some maltiness, caramel and citrus, with a toasted feeling too. Better than the usual Cruzcampo (the one nowadays, it used to be better long ago), but not a great thing."
"O - This is a fairly typical European lager, with not much to recommend it, other than the higher body and alcohol content than usual. It's a decent beer for Spain, but that is not saying much."
"o: decent for Spain, quite boozy and metallic. certainly better than the standard Cruzcampo, but that is expected."
"An all malt beer. Do I need to go on? 6.4 ABV I guess is the sticking point. Spain is starting to catch on slowly to the craft beer thing but bnot quick enough. This beer pouts a light golden into my chalice with some decent rocky head but quickly down to nil. Smell is malty not much else. Tstebis slightly mettlic Malta and some alcohol. Mouthfeel is light Bodied. Overall a below average beer but I guess us drink one more if it was presented tome in a social setting."

"It 'a more structured and alcoholic than a Cruzcampo standard, but we can't talk to who knows what wonders."
