"I saw the can among the other polish lagers, the logo is nice with the bison and the name so I bought it. Has nothing special I won't repeat much, looks ok orange browned few gas, smells boozy like rotten beer, no taste at all, a bit of alcohol a bit malt... Aftertaste is like wooden flavour. Not bad option for a can at home, is cheap."

"Probably won't buy again."

"My mark out of one hundred would be 75."
"Overall - Not a whole lot to say here, it's nothing fantastic that is definitely quaffable, but if you're looking for something different or unique look elsewhere. Would choose others in the style before Zubr Bison, but would drink it if offered."

"NOW. For what it's worth, my 650 ml bottle poured quite clear, a shade darker than the familiar pilsner straw, effervescent but not foamy. A bit of flower and field in the nose, grassy, plus yeast smells, a little toast, a bit of orange pith. Sweet up front in the mouth, surprisingly, caramel malt flavor, buttered toast, orange marmalade (but not THAT sweet). A flick of hops that seems less bitter, maybe a bit of citrus zest, just rounding things off. A bit sticky feeling in the mouth, substantial, but more-ish. Pleasantly beating mundane expectations."

"O - Nothing fancy here, standard flavour profile and fitting for the style. I wouldn't turn one down if offered, but I wouldn't buy it."

"Bottle. It pours a clear, golden body under a finger-thick white head. Fruityness, grains and malty sweetness on the nose. Yellow apples and some pears. A hint of cooked vegetables. The flavor is on the fruity side, with some bitterness showing up towards the very end. A decent one, but not very interesting in any way"

"Final Grade: 3.33, a B-."
"D: Meh, wouldn't go for this if I had the choice."
"Overall â€“ Another average euro beer.. It would benefit from some more hop bitterness to balance out the taste a little bit. I wouldn't buy this beer again."
"Sweeter than most Eastern Block pilsners, in both smell and taste, almost pleasant! Certainly better than a few I've tasted over the years. I expected bog stanard Euro Fizz, but this a whole lot better than that, in all aspects."
"A traditional European lager: grainy, sweet and never been anywhere close to a hop (either wet or dry), but easy to drink and with more flavour than a typical macro ""pils"". Recognize Zubr is Polish, but it brings back memories of German lagers and I'd certainly drink another one in a pinch!"
"Dr: Wouldn't have it again even at this price range."
"Drinkability - i enjoyed this beer, will 100% commit to buying it again. Overall it is a nice drinking beer, i guess i may have a preference to beer in bottles, find them to be cleaner tasting."
"Average EPL. Best part of the beer is the lovely green hue of the can!"
"D-not much off here in flavor but overall very non-descript. I would not want this beer again."
"worth trying perhaps, but not worth looking for"
"Slightly darker amber than your average Polish pilsner-type, with a solid, marshmallowy white head with decent retention. The aroma is just one shade past nonexistent in the direction of dishwatery, with a soapy lemon background and some faint stale grain. The flavor is significantly bolder but no less delicious, corny and citric, not bad but tremendously average. However I must say it has a nice, lingering finish of sweet grain and tangy hops, and the somewhat high alcohol is well hidden. Effervescent carbonation that doesn't get too sharp also helps keep this nice and drinkable."
"An agreeable plain-ass Euro-lager, if a bit lacking in balancing bitterness, but easy enough to put back, the so-called strong ABV not really a concern. Apparently 'zubr' means 'bison' in Polish, so isn't this then actually called 'Bison Bison' here on BA?"
"Poured a clear golden color, with about a 1"" head, that went down pretty quick. I sensed a bit of sweetness to it, as well as some bitterness. Pretty good easy drinking beer. A bit stronger that others but overall not too bad."
"Good beer and worth a drink."
"Mouthfeel - while watery and refreshing it has a medium body and creamy texture. Good carbonation level."
"Meh, It was decent, but as one reviewer stated, I expected more from a Czech brewer."
"The appearance is clear gold with nice head and lacing. The smell was earthy with scents of grain and malts, even some vegetation smell. The taste was earthy as well with a very grainy and grassy taste. The mouthfeel was ok but didnt strike me as memorable. It is drinkable but there are better beers out there."
"Won't be a return customer on this one, although it's a bit more palatable than many of the Eastern European lagers on the local shelves these days."
"This is a very pleasant lager. Well balanced and lacking in any off flavors. Perhaps some more hops would benefit this beer, but its quite quaffable as it is. Try it it if you come across it."
"A bit grainy for a Czech pivo, but at this ABV I think it is for the Polish and Russian market. Won't buy again but there are worse beer evils in the world."
"Overall a very mediocre beer, was not impressed by the dry vegetable aftertaste and there are better beers in this category."
"This beer doesn't have a whole lot going for it. A sub par strong lager."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" white head above the clear bright golden brew. Head dwindles slowly, with acceptable lacing. Aroma is effervescent and sweet, in a adjunct sort of way. Taste is the same sweetness upfront, with a malt liquorish lack of hops character. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both about what you expect for the style, for better or worse. A reasonable example of what they are trying to be."
"First taste is full of Nutty malts and alcohol. A bit too sweet for me perhaps, but there's a decent hop back to counteract. A metallic acidity is in evidence as well, but it's not dreadful. Mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated. Creamy and full bodied at first, leading to a slight dryness in the back of the throat. Drinkable to be sure, but a solidly average beer. Everything about it says ""3.0"" :-)"
"Light copper in colour with high carbonation. Aromas of sweet pale malts, spicy hops, and a bit of black pepper. Sweet and lightly toasted malts on the palate, followed up by some grassy and herbal hops, and a bit of caramel. Medium bodied with some corse bitterness to balance things out. A very average Eastern European lager, although it did finish fairly clean for its strength."
"Clear gold with a bright, fluffy, white head that dissipates quickly. Some lace. Aromas of sweet malt, a bit of DMS/cooked veggies, very light floral/grassy hops. There's a slight bitterness, but there's more sweetness up front. Herbal and lightly citric hop flavour starts at the mid and grows into the finish. Too bad there's a bit of vegetal flavour throughout. Light body, moderate to high carbonation, drying on the palate. A pretty basic sweet lager."
"Appearance starts off alright. Big, fluffy head and a golden/orange colour. But, the head quickly disipates to nothing. And the colour is basically a shade too orange to be urine. Smells of stale, overcooked veggies and straw. If their is any hop profile, I can't smell it. All I smell is veggies, straw and corn. Okay, their is a bit of hops. I can taste some lemon in the aftertaste. Starts out corn syrup sweet, with some grassy dryness. Leaves with a lemon flavour and overcooked veggies. Mouthfeel is the best part of the beer. Crisp and a bit sharp. Drinkable in that I don't gag when I drink it, but otherwise, don't bother."
"Just another anonymous Euro-lager to me."
" Sweet and malty up front... light citrus hopping sits in the background in the medium body makes this a malt biased lager, with a wet biscuity finish only slightly attenuated by light hopping...normally I'd be in malt head's bliss with this beer except for one thing...an annoying funky vegital taste that lurks just below the malt profile...my thinking is there was a little corn ( 10%?) in the mash to get the ABV up to 5.8%. Too bad, that ruins an otherwise malty lager."
