The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, corn, floral, grain, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, corn, fruit, alcohol, grain, and floral. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty below average brew. I bought this to amuse beeruser and funkydelic at GBX as they laughed when they suggest that I tick it. Phew! I now know why... The manager at Trappe Door described it as 'hot trash'. Not only does this thing not appeal to the palate, it does not do so for the eye either. I didn't know what to expect going into this one and there was honestly no way I could have prepared myself short of pounding a few 40's prior to this one. Just so harsh in flavors like nails on the chalkboard. Yeah guys, you got me good. Based on this one Lithuania should stick to whatever they are good at and leave beer alone in my opinion...","thagr81us","Aug 07, 2012"
2.89,0,4,2.5,3,2.5,3,"The beer pours like crisp apple juice or piss with a quick firecracker head that disappears as fast as it appears leaving nothing. The beer smells very light with damp pils-like malts. There is some slight fruity character in the smell as well but it is very faint. The beer tastes very sweet with a candy-apple bite and a very light sweet finish. There is also a very strong butter-flavor traveling throughout this beer which is probably why it is called “Lobster Lovers” and is strange and smooth upon the mouth. The mouthfeel is super dry after it passes through the mouth but is very clean and slightly watery as it passes through with a light hint of sharp bubbles and a gelling feeling in the mouth. This is my first strong lager and I am quite interested with it. The heavier malt bill seems to give the lager a more ale-like than any lager I have consumed. The mouthfeel is the major downside of this beer, leaving you thirstier than before the sip, but the taste is quite intriguing though a little too sweet for my palate. This is an intriguing beer to say the least, but I’m not sure I’ll have it again.","Maxwell","Aug 03, 2012"

This beer didn't have good drinkability, it went down a little rough and it was boozy, I am glad I am splitting this bottle, I don't think I could drink it all by myself. What I liked most about this beer was the way it looked, it looked pretty nice in a Pilsener glass, the only flaw was the head retention. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma and taste, they wen't that good and were overly sweet and boozy. I wouldn't buy this beer again, if I wanted a beer that tasted like this I would save some money and just a buy a shitty can of Malt Liquor, I don't recommend this beer to anyone even Lithuanians. This was my first beer from this brewery and I wasn't a fan which didn't make for a good first impression. I have yet to find a decent tasting Lithuanian beer, but I haven't given up hope just yet... the search continues.","StoutHunter","Apr 23, 2012"

Super cloying mess of a beer, just not acceptable. More green apple with honey bursts of gag reflux sweetness, cooked veggies and a bit of rust or penny sucking sensations.

2.99,3.5,2,3,3,2.5,3.5,"So if this is the Lithuanian equivalent of malt liquor it's good in the sense that it's cheap, alcoholic and could lead to questionable desicion making at social gatherings. Sucess!","donkeyrunner","Aug 23, 2009"
2.75,-4.8,3,3,2.5,2.5,3," Palate is sweet with fruity, adjunct malt, and a very slight hoppy bitterness. Finish leaves a lingering sweetness, with a touch of warmth. A mild chalky character is not particularly pleasant. While the alcohol is well-integrated, this is not exactly a beer I'd like to try again. Try again, Lithuania.","ElGordo","Aug 20, 2009"

3.06,5.9,4,3,3,3,3,"Drinkability: Very average, even for the style, which I'm trying to rate to very hard here. Just not a terribly good beer, with a lot of strange, yeasty, ""off"" note, and a little too much alcohol to be too terribly drinkable.","CrellMoset","Mar 12, 2009"

3.51,21.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"OK. Another Lithuanian oddity found in Topsham, Maine, this one being 9.5%. Seriously? Madness. Out of the bottle this Euro Strong Lager was a deep gold color with a thin, off-white head. The retention was decent but the lacing was actually quite good in thin sheets. The aroma was of musty and earthy malt with some sweetness of adjunct grain mash and a light spiciness. The flavors were at first quite spicy and rather sweet from the caramel and toffee-like malt along with some artificial tasting sweetener probably being used to cover up the alcohol. The middle of the beer was grainy and after a while I began to taste the ALC in that part. The finish was a little musty. The mouthfeel was smooth but a bit slick, the carbonation soft and the body medium. I didn't really care for the taste but it was almost exactly like their blue label, only twice as strong. If you're not going to enjoy the flavors you might as well enjoy the buzz...","thekevlarkid","Feb 02, 2009"
3.9,34.9,3,3,4.5,4,4,"Gotta give it to this one, the flavor is completely enjoyable. I've always liked this idea of this style but never found a decent representative until now. It may not look the business, and the smell is dull, but it performs where it matters most. Euro Strong Lagers could be the next thing for U.S. brewers to mess with--I'd love to see it. The strange name and weirdly sexy/disturbing label probably don't do it justice. I'd buy it again, as $2.99 a bottle seems fair.","Metalmonk","Dec 31, 2008"
3.95,36.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Crystal clear, amber color. Malty nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is sweet malty, caramel finish. The high ABV is hidden. Decent strong lager, big improvement over their 5% version. $4.50 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me.","jdhilt","Dec 17, 2008"

3.47,20.1,2.5,3,3.5,3,4.5,"D: There were four reasons I picked up this beer: the country, the price, the huge red tag that said 9.5% ABV, and the intriguing, arousing, and yet disturbing label. As someone who loves both lobster and the female form I can't complain about the bottle graphics while strange, even for me. I would drink more of this beer and maybe even give it a spin with lobster.","erikm25","Oct 18, 2008"
3.03,4.8,3.5,3,3,3,3,"I tried both this and its 5% ABV brother, and didn't like either of them. This beer was a gold color with a small white head that disappeared quickly. It had an aroma of grain, and that was pretty much it. I thought the alcohol was very noticeable, but despite that, the beer was pretty bland. I finished this 500ml bottle and couldn't imagine having another one.","lordofthewiens","Sep 02, 2008"
3.08,6.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Lobster Lovers Beer has one of the strangest names and one of the strangest labels that I've ever seen.

2.8,-3.1,3,3,3,3,2,"This beer is not as clean as the last one I had from this brewery; though both are extremely similar. It packs a punch, and despite the subtle flavor, the alcohol is pretty well hidden. It gets tough to finish this one when it warms up","IPAcraig","Jul 06, 2008"

2.94,1.7,3,4,3,2,2,"Overall: This beer comes off as a thin-bodied Maibock. Ultimately, this beer shows what happens when you brew a Maibock without a nice, malty backbone, and in the process shows why a nice, malty backbone is essential to a Maibock. Still, it's not a horrible beer and is worth it for the bottle alone.","Windigstadt","Apr 05, 2008"
3.66,26.6,4,3,4,3,4,"16.9 oz bottle. Pours golden with 1.5 cm white, mostly diminishing head. Aroma is sweet, mostly apple, a little yeasty. Initial flavor is sweet, balanced citrus and apple. Flavor ends on slight yeasty and apple notes and the alcohol catches up at this point. The aftertaste is dominated by the alcohol content. A thinner body, moderate carbonation, alcohol is noticeable as it warms. The flavor of cherry cola only comes out for the aftertaste once the beer warms. Stronger alcohol aroma when the beer warms. Drinkable beer and a nice change of pace from other beers I generally take home.","joekfsu","Dec 22, 2007"
4.2,45.3,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Clean but with a nice lingering buttery texture. The booze it well hidden and palatable. Moderate carbonation mellows the whole experience out a bit. Slick and a bit creamy in the finish. Extremely well crafted. I am impressed.","letsgopens","Dec 21, 2007"
