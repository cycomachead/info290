Not complex by any means, but as a higher abv brew that's meant to taste like a fizzy yellow beer, it's not bad at all. I like to think of this style as the Euro style of American malt liquor. With that outlook, this is actually a half-decent brew. I wouldn't risk multiple purchases just because of the green bottle and high risk of skunkiness, but I have no shame in rating this with a score that is quite a bit higher than average","BEERMILER12","Oct 28, 2014"

Keep in mind this brew was pours out of a green bottle. The smell is skunky with some grains and hops. The taste is smooth with some skunkiness. For having an ABV of 7.2% it is really smooth. I'm not big on the taste of this brew.  The mouthfeel is ok but it has some skunkyness.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 3 out of 5.  Not the best but far from the worst. I may by this brew again.

On the Strong side is correct especially for someone who's just getting into beers. This brew was yellow in color, it looked like a Becks, Smelled and Tasted like one too.

A little spicy, vanilla cream or orange cream flavors. More malty than hoppy. Sweetness comes through nicely, similar to some Belgian ales I've tried. The booze quotient is high, but I hardly notice it. In fact it's pretty refreshing and I can happily down a few of these without getting tired of the flavor. The downside to the taste is a bit of an astringent bite, but the overall positive taste wins me over. I buy this on occasion and I'm never let down.

Semi-dryng aftertaste, with a saaz/tettnanger hop flavor and bitterness that fails to balance out the strong adjunct taste. Medium body, and lighter carbonation allow a creamy smooth mouthfeel. However, a highly crisp carbonation might have softened the blow of the cloyingly sweet adjunct better.

A fluffy, stark white head that held it's retention rather well. Smells sweetly malty (pilsner malt) and hopped particularly high. The malts take on fruity characters of peach, pears, apples, and a light corn sugar flavor. Hops start off a little musks, and almost light-striken, but balances well to contribute a well balanced bittering and an earthy flavor. Full and creamy (almost thick) to the mouth. Would finish very clean and crisp if not for such bold sweetness. Alcohols contribute a warmth and drying quality from midpoint into the finish. Surprised the corn flavors never become dominant or distracting. One of my favorite lagers.","BEERchitect","Mar 19, 2006"

Smell was very grainy and a bit salty as well, giving it a less then inviting nose. Taste wasn't much better, lots and lots of malt on the tongue and cereal grain, but not a whole lot more.

The 7.2% alcohol was not evident at all in this strong lager. I hate that malt liquor label crap! It conjures up immediate visions of Mickeys or Colt .45. This is not in that category. I would put this up against Checkvar or Pilsner Urquell anyday. I know they are not exactly the same style but as far as an imported lager goes they are close.

Light toasted cereal in there too. Hops even out some of the sweetness with some skunky bitterness.

The body is medium/full with a very fine and mild carbonation. The mouthfeel starts lightly crisp at first, and then becomes creamy as it warms. The flavor reveals much more hop flavor than the aroma indicates, and the bitterness is quite bold as well. Were it not for the solid, sweetly grainy malt underneath, this could be an IPA. It's well balanced with the malt and hops tasting seperately, but also playing against each other. Quite lively and interesting. The alcohol is well cloaked, but becomes more apparent towards the end of the glass. It finishes drying with a lingering combination of malty sweetness and bitter hop character.
