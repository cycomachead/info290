While I can find one or two things to enjoy about the flavor, and I'm able to finish the bottle (only had one or two ""drainpours"" in my life), this is at best a novelty beer, and a worst a headache in a bottle. Avoid.","augustgarage","Jan 20, 2014"

There's not much of an after-taste. I can't believe this beer is rated so low, it's very smooth and delicious. I recommend it.","BrandonStout","Nov 23, 2013"

2.33,-9.7,3.25,2,2.25,3,2.25,"500 ml bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a mostly clear dark gold/amber color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is decent, and there isn't much lacing at all. The brew smells like bready/grainy malt, sugar and booze. Unfortunately the taste is similar to the aroma. I think it tastes mostly like sugary booze, with some grainy malt noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's syrupy and coating with low/moderate carbonation. This certainly wasn't one of the better brews I've had lately. But I also finished the bottle without a problem so it wasn't exactly awful either. $2.49 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Sep 30, 2013"

The taste was much too sweet, like fake candy, way too boozy and the aftertaste was like vomit. Almost zero carbonation and a very strange mirky orange color.

A kind of caramel flavor in the middle, but it is overwhelmed by alcohol and an acidic, estery flavor. Not very good. Hopefully won't give me a headache.","LiquidAmber","Jun 14, 2012"

I have another bottle which of course I will drink when I'm looking for a cheap drunk. However, if you're only looking for a cheap drunk off of beer, your average Euro-Strong lager is a better option. Or, just get some Black Boss Porter or Zweic Porter. At least those beers have some character to it.","Derranged","Feb 16, 2012"

1.55,-39.9,2,2,1,2.5,1.5,"I purchased this bottle lured in by the cool optical illusion label and the promise of 12% ALC. Unfortunately, these turned out to be the only highlights of the experience. Out of the bottle the beer was a dark golden color with a very short lived head of tan foam. Minimal lacing. The aroma was of booze, ethanol and some skunked malt. The flavors were about the same, dominated by the booze and ethanol with hints of something fishy and an acidic bite. Pure unadulterated garbage. The mouthfeel was slick, the body medium and the carbonation average. Not worth it and sadly one of the worst beers Iâ€™ve had in a while.","thekevlarkid","Jan 19, 2012"

3.57,38.4,3,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,"Very cool bottle... the whole reason I bought it. Very thin head which immediately dissipated. Clear with bubbles rising. Smell is of rich full caramel malt and well straw actually. The taste is of fruity esters in a rich caramel brew... alcohol flavor is not prevalent despite 12%ABV.

I expected this beer to be terrible, but for less than $3 I was very happy. It went down way too fast for how strong it was. Probably why I'm feeling it so much today. Will seek out more.","abriggs1","Jan 04, 2011"
3.35,29.8,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a one, three-finger white head that vanishes leaving no lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied (thinner than I expected). Light alcohol and caramel nose, flavor has hints of alcohol, caramel, hops are in background, not cloying. Not as bad as the ratings suggest. $4.50 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me.","jdhilt","Dec 30, 2010"

3.01,16.7,3,2,3.5,3.5,3,"Thankfully, taste and feel are a lot better. It is malty and overall like the aroma, but more pleasant. It has a spicey-sweet, faintly meaty, raisiny character with a hint of dough and rather like cheap, fortified wine with a hint of basic blended American whisky. It is one-dimensional, devoid of complexity, but nevertheless fairly pleasant. Alcohol is evident, but amazingly smooth, with a strong warming quality and not rough or unpleasant. It is surprisingly drinkable for all of this and for the high abv, but rather boring.","Offa","0"
2.28,-11.6,3,2.5,2,3,2,"Poured with a small, short lived, off white head and no lace. Color is a clear amber. As soon as I opened the bottle I got a whiff of the malt. Aroma also has lots of grain, caramel and circus peanuts. Flavor's about the same and very sweet. Body is like I'd expect from a beer this sweet, full and thankfully there's enough carbonation to cut through it. Finish is like flavor and has some length. Probably won't finish it.","drpimento","Jul 14, 2010"
